DON'T put your daughter on the stage was once a common warning to
parents, but still the lure of the spotlight attracts many young people
who dream of a career in acting. Just how realistic an ambition is that
for a young school-leaver today? Can the dream come true? What would
life be like if it did? To answer these questions, we went to Hamilton,
where a new episode of Taggart was being filmed, to speak to two of
Scotland's most successful young actors -- Blythe Duff and James
McPherson. First we spoke to . . .
BLYTHE
* How did you get into acting?
* I did drama at school. I had a drama teacher. Then I left and went
to a Youth Opportunities Drama company in Glasgow for two years. I also
went to the Scottish Youth Theatre during the summer. When I finished
that, I got my Equity card in 1983. I didn't go to college to train: I
applied but didn't get in, so I decided to go through community and
youth theatre.
* Was it a struggle to gain recognition?
* Not really, but if you want to live in Scotland you have to get into
the circuit and get to know people, so you tend to do quite a lot with
the theatre companies. I spent seven years in theatre before I did
Taggart. I worked with TAG, then Wildcat and Borderline.
Working in theatre doesn't always get you a lot of recognition, so
when you do something like TV, which is wider than Scotland, you get a
different type of recognition. If you want people in the street to know
you, you've got to do TV. It took a while for the Taggart audience to
recognise me (though I've been doing it for over four years) since I was
in uniform at first.
* Which actors do you most admire?
* When I was younger I always liked Phyllis Logan because she was a
Scot. I always felt she was accepted within the profession at that time.
I've never really been a keen film buff, because when I was working in
the theatre I would go there at night and generally didn't get the
chance to see films; it's only been in the last couple of years that
I've managed that. But I haven't really thought certain people wonderful
and needed to do what they do.
When I was younger and went to the Citizens I found the productions
very avant-garde -- people walking about with no clothes on. I thought,
''Oh, that's what actresses have to do. I won't be doing that!''
* Can you shop without fans bothering you?
* I think there's a way of handling it. If you want attention you can
draw it, but if you want to just get on, most people let you do that.
You can't go to Safeway without one or two people talking to you, but
that's fine because you know that's just part of it all and you find a
way of handling it. You don't have to be rude. You can be nice to people
but keep it short so you can still get on and do things.
But there are times when it's annoying. The other night I went to see
Elvis Costello at the Barrowlands. He was singing his new version of
Alison, my all-time favourite song, and it was really lovely and no-one
had spoken to me all night, but suddenly this guy decides to come up and
say ''Blythe . . .'' And I say, ''Stop. I'm really sorry but I'll speak
to you in a minute. May I just hear this last bit?'' I didn't want
anyone to speak to me. Even if it was my mother or father, I would have
said ''Please, I just want to listen to this.'' I think people accept
that.
If you live in Glasgow and work in Taggart, you're going to get
recognised and that's all there is to it.
* In the last episode (Hellfire) you played a different role from
normal. Was it hard?
* It was hard because it was a different story-line. The idea of
somebody going undercover could be a bit naff. I was wanting to keep it
realistic, and because we only had two episodes to tell the story, it
all happened a bit quickly. Therefore when she met this guy she fell in
love within the space of a day; but it had to be condensed.
That was difficult as you had to make it believable. But it was really
nice to still be rooted with your character, because you know what she
thinks and how she reacts to things.
It was a challenge then to go one step beyond that and almost act
Jackie Reid acting -- your character playing somebody else. How good
would she be at acting? That was difficult. Would she be able to speak
about a subject and still sound knowledgeable?
Probably, if you asked a policewoman, she might be able to do it; but
another might not. It's different for an actress who can pretend, and
turn her hand to anything; but for a policewoman it might be difficult.
But it was nice to get a change of appearance. I don't change my look
very much!
Next we spoke to the man who plays the part of Jardine . . .
JAMES
* How did you get into acting?
* I used to work in a laboratory between 17 and 22 and the job got
boring, so I decided to do something outside that I liked. I joined an
amateur dramatics group called Easter Egg in Motherwell. They did a show
at the end of the year, and I really enjoyed that. But people in this
area don't become actors, that happens to other people, like in Glasgow.
Then somebody said, ''By the way there's a drama school in Glasgow'' --
and I went, ''Uh, oh, right.'' I kind of stumbled on it, very late. I
was 22. Luckily, I got in, and that was it.
* Was it a struggle to gain recognition?
* I never sought to gain it, so I suppose it was no struggle. All I
have ever done is to try to do good work. There were years when I didn't
work much, when I worked in my mate's engineering factory pressing out
metal parts. If you call that a struggle. I didn't. At least I was out
of the house and there were people I would be working with who would be
there for for the rest of their lives. At least I had the hope of a call
from my agent or a letter through the post, which eventually happened.
* Which actors do you most admire?
* It depends. My favourite is Harrison Ford because he is so good. As
an actor, watching him you think, ''God! He's done nothing there.'' He
is also in two of my favourite films, Witness and Bladerunner. Plus he
was in the brilliant Star Wars. And also he was in a film I saw when I
was 14, American Graffiti. I kind of grew up with him and think he's
super.
* Have you done any other work for TV?
* I've done a few short films and I have done Mr Boom. I have not done
any other TV series because I have never had any time. Taggart takes up
to 42 weeks. But I have done radio plays and a Radio 4 soap opera called
Citizens.
* How long does it take to film one episode of Taggart?
* We do an eight-week shoot for three hours worth, but it's not three
hours worth on TV because of the ads. It probably takes about 3[1/2]
weeks to do an episode.
* Can you shop without fans bothering you?
* You don't get mobbed, but they watch what you put in your basket. I
don't mind people coming up and saying ''Hello, love your show'' or even
''hate your show''. Asking for an autograph is fine. It's teenagers who
follow you around. They only speak in whispers -- they think you're deaf
as well as blind.
* How has being in Taggart affected you?
* You lose your privacy, the fact that you can walk down the street
unnoticed. I plan my journey, if I'm going to Sauchiehall Street from
Argyle Street I know the quickest route. It stops the window shopping.
So there you have it -- How two top actors made it and how it has
affected their lives. One thing we must say is that, despite their fame,
Blythe and James are incredibly nice, patient, normal people.

Manchester United have put on sale their new blue-and-white replica
kit. That may surprise you. They still play in the famous red shirt, but
their away strip is black and they also have a third outfit -- yellow
and green -- for cup matches.
To be more exact, they HAD a yellow and green outfit. For the last few
weeks, it has been blue and white. The new gear costs #65 -- more if you
want a player's name and squad number printed on it.
This is Man U's sixth kit in less than three years. The yellow and
green one, which was on sale for Christmas, is already obsolete. That's
one way to pay for Andy Cole, isn't it?
Umbro, which holds the contract for Manchester United's strips, has no
doubts that the new outfit can be justified. Its promotions manager says
that any youngsters who own the yellow and green strip ''would probably
have outgrown it by now.'' Since Christmas?
Manchester United are not alone. Other leading clubs, like Rangers,
introduce regular changes of strip as part of their marketing strategy.
Labour leader Tony Blair, a keen follower of the game, is critical of
the trend, complaining that ''fashion cannot justify the constant change
of strips which parents are then pressurised to buy.''
What do you think? Are clubs guilty of placing unfair commercial
pressure on those who already support them at the turnstiles? Do your
parents buy the latest Rangers, Celtic or whatever other strips for you?
Or do you buy them yourself? If so, how do you raise the money and do
you think it's fair to be expected to do it so often? Write to Fair
Play, Schools Herald, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow G1 1QP. The writers of
the three best letters will each win a Herald sweatshirt -- and have
their letters published!
TV and radio programmes like ''Only an Excuse'' and ''Off the Ball''
have fun lampooning the Scottish football authorities. Let's give the
SFA credit for speaking out for fair play in its pursuit of the Duncan
Ferguson head-butting incident and the Tommy Burns/Billy Stark saga.
South of the Border, life seems much murkier. Words like sleaze, muck
and mire are common currency -- one journalist even talks of noxious
emissions rising from the sewer -- as claims of financial corruption
spread like the plague.
It is a sorry catalogue. The report of a Premier League commission of
enquiry has led Arsenal to dismiss their manager George Graham for
accepting #420,000 from a company run by Norwegian agent Rune Hauge,
though Graham later repaid the money. The same commission, set up to
explore one solitary transfer --that of Teddy Sheringham from Notts
Forest to Spurs -- is now probing 23, mainly involving Scandinavians.
One of them, Kare Ingebrigtsen, sold by Rosenborg to Manchester City
through Hauge, has apparently admitted receiving a ''bung'' of #50,000.
Two of the 23 cases - the transfers of Torben Piechnik and Stig Inge
Bjornebye - involved Graham Souness as manager of Liverpool.
The business affairs of Terry Venables have been officially
investigated. Spurs faced charges of financial malpractice and were
originally to have six points deducted and be eliminated from the FA
Cup. Bruce Grobbelaar stands accused of fixing matches. Paul Merson and
Frank McAvennie have admitted experimenting with drugs, and Merson
seemingly negotiated a fat payment for his tabloid confession.
Managers such as Mike Walker, Brian Little and George Burley have
absconded to new clubs without staying to honour their contracts. No
manager should be able to move on like this, except by mutual agreement.
Leaders should lead by example. The troops cannot be expected to show
more morality than the brigadier.
Not all the allegations will stick -- but some will. They all have one
potent element in common -- sheer unadulterated greed. The more money is
poured into sport, the more it seems to spawn avarice and temptation.
However, when temptation degenerates into corruption, the customer
could well revolt. English football could face a loss of patronage if
supporters begin to suspect that their idols inhabit a grimy
nether-world where seamy deals are set up surreptitiously by shady
fixers. The implications for clubs could be graver still if sponsors,
such as banks, decide they cannot afford to have their names linked to a
sullied commodity.
It would be enormously sad if it came to that. The odds are that it
will not, since the English authorities are under enormous pressure to
take strenuous action.
The game's governing body, FIFA, is implementing plans to regulate and
license football agents, who will need to furnish a deposit of #100,000
before they can practise. The breathtaking amount of the deposit tells
its own story.
That master of sports writers, Hugh McIlvanney, maintains that English
football must now demonstrate its decency as never before. ''Romance and
honesty and fair play,'' he insists, ''are not quaint, outmoded concepts
but the basic apparatus of its survival.''

FIFA INTERNATIONAL
SOCCER '95
Oh no! I hear you cry, not another sequel. But this is one of the few
sequels ever made that actually varies slightly from its original. Okay
so there's not really all that much you can change about a football
game, there's a ball and you kick it! Right? Wrong! this is one football
game that actually gives you the feeling that you're in control. With
the original FIFA, passing was about as common as kangaroos in Glasgow,
to say nothing of headers! But fortunately, our friendly programmers
down at Park Place have totally revamped this game to create a very
playable, enjoyable soccer game. With a lot more headers from punts and
corners some goals that seemed impossible in FIFA are no longer a long
shot (if you'll excuse the pun!) And the passing system has been
completely re-thought. so that you can now whip that Cantona-esque cross
into the box like, well, Cantona! There's also a whole new host of teams
to choose from including club teams from countries like Spain, Brazil,
Italy and even England (sorry no Scottish teams). And there's also the
national teams to choose from as well.
So you match up your European favourites alongside the likes of our
own Giggsy down in Manchester! There's also a whole load of other
options such as weather, team strategy etc...Apart from the fact that we
can't watch the likes of Rangers play Celtic, a brilliant sequel and a
cracking game in its own right. Raid the local bank and BUY IT NOW!

GOLF III
This is the third in a long-running saga of golf simulations by
Electronic Arts, and it is by far the best.
With four new courses to choose from and digitised player sprites the
game definitely looks the part, and it also plays like a dream. You can
now add draw or fade to your shots giving you that extra feeling of
control. And the new options involve skins games, (each hole's worth
money) tournaments, and tours all around the new courses. There are also
some pro's for you to pit your wits against. All in all this is an
absolutely fantastic game and is well worth purchasing even if you own
the previous two outings.

This is the sequel to one of the most talked about games in recent
times. And it's a lot BIGGER and BETTER. With a whole new host of
characters such as Baraka, Mileena and Jax, to name a few, and also a
lot more new moves it really is terrific. There's also babalities and
friendship moves to be used as well as the traditional fatalities. The
graphics are also a lot better which makes this conversion virtually
ARCADE PERFECT.

Reviews by Andrew Barr, Uddingston Grammar
SENSIBLE SOCCER
The graphics may be tiny and the sound terrible but this is one of the
finest footie games you will ever play. The difference between this and
the droves of other, inferior SNES football games is that it has been
programmed by people who know something about football. It is
playability, not flashy graphics that make a good game.
The game is viewed from a zoomed out, top down perspective with the
emphasis being put on passing rather than taking turns to run down the
pitch and takes shots at goal. This leads to a very enjoyable, realistic
game of football and with three skill levels, a wealth of options and a
choice of both club and national teams you can be assured of playing for
months to come.
Sensible Soccer is easily the best football game on the Super NES and
you'd be mad to miss it. Buy it now!

SUPER STREET FIGHTER II
In the beginning there was Street Fighter 2, people were amazed at its
unique in-depth gameplay, special moves and unrivalled two-player action
not to mention the incredible graphics and sound. The game
revolutionised the beat 'em up, and has influenced many poorer
imitations. Since then there has been numerous sequels and Super Street
Fighter 2 is the latest one to hit the Super NES.
The main difference between this and the last Super NES Street fighter
game, Street Fighter 2 Turbo, is the addition of four new characters,
Cammy, Thunderhawk, Fei Long and Dee Jay now join the previous 12
characters to give a total of 16 fighters to choose from. As well as the
new characters some of the original ones have received some new moves,
for example Ken can now perform a Flaming Dragon punch and Blanka a
deadly Beast Roll. The game's lastability has also been improved with
five different modes of play and all this leads to an excellent beat 'em
up package.
I wouldn't say Super Street Fighter 2 is different enough to justify
its cost for people who already own a street Fighter game but for those
who don't this is the one for you!

DOOM II: HELL ON EARTH
Less than a year after the original was released the sequel to one of
the most impressive, addictive and goriest games of all time is here and
it's great. The reason for Doom's success was its unique blend of
strategy and ''search and kill'' gameplay, the game also oozed in
atmosphere and had that feeling of never knowing what was waiting around
the next corner. Doom 2 somehow manages to capitalise on all these
points and improve on them. It's noticeable right from the first couple
of levels that Doom 2 is a much harder challenge than before, the maze
like levels are more complicated and there are a lot more puzzles to be
solved. The graphics have been improved and although the music isn't
that great the sound effects are brilliant.
All this leads to Doom being an excellent title and essential for all
PC owners, even if you already have the original Doom.

DONKEY KONG COUNTRY
This has to be one of the most hyped games ever released with
advertisements of the game being seen all over the place. Thankfully the
game has lived up to its reputation unlike so many other ''Big''
releases.
The first thing that hits you when playing this game is the graphics,
they really are amazing and easily the best yet on the Super Nintendo,
the animation of the characters is superb too and the sound's not bad
either. Although the looks of the game are special the gameplay's really
quite ordinary, it's based on the usual platform idea of going through
different Worlds and stages and killing enemies by jumping on their
heads. To help you on your way there are ropes to swing on, cannon like
barrels and you can even hitch a lift on a variety of animals which come
along.
Donkey Kong Country is a huge game with well over a hundred levels.
This and the many secret rooms ensure that once you start playing you'll
find it hard to stop. My only complaint is that the game is too easy and
it's all over too soon. But despite this it's still a great game and if
you're at all into platformers you really must give this one a go!

STUNT RACE FX
Every game Nintendo has released so far on the Super Nintendo has been
brilliant but at a first glance Stunt Race FX looks like their first
dud, the 3D graphics take a while to get used to and the control system
is at first awkward. But if given time you will find that Stunt Race FX
is one of the most playable and enjoyable racers out there.
There are four modes of play in the game Speed Trax, Stunt Trax,
Battle Trax and free Trax. The one player game sees you competing
against three other computer controlled cars in a race over three laps
of a circuit. To progress to the next circuit you must finish within a
time limit and come ranked third place or higher. There are three skill
levels to race in, with each level consisting of four circuits and a
bonus track. In two player mode there are four tracks to race round.
Unfortunately this is a bit poor as the game window for each player is
far too small and the game also runs a lot slower.
As far as 3D racers go this is a great game, but because of the amount
of time needed to be spent before getting anything out of the game I
would only recommend it to serious race freaks.

Questions from pupils at Dumfries Academy:
If you were writing today, would you write in English or Scots? (Sarah
Flockhart, 15)
Both. I always did. My so-called Kilmarnock Edition was actually
called Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect so please note the
''chiefly''. I included English poems in that substantial volume --
''Man Was Made to Mourn'' and all that. When my poems first appeared,
most of the critics advised me to write exclusively in English in order
to reach a wide audience but I could never abandon Scots. My best poems
are bilingual, Scots and English with the emphasis on Scots. In ''Tam o'
Shanter'', for instance, I switch from Scots to the bit about ''But
pleasures are like poppies spread.'' Excellent English in my opinion but
not as good as the surrounding Scots.
Who was the love of your life? (Sylvia Nash, 15)
I suppose I should say my own and only wife, Jean Armour, who said I
should have had twa wives. I could mention more than two women I might
have married. Nelly Kilpatrick, the subject of my first song, for one.
Peggy Thomson, the charming Fillette I met in Kirkoswald, for two.
Alison Begbie, who turned down my proposal of marriage, for three. Betty
Paton, mother of my ''Dear-bought Bess''. Mary Campbell, my ''Highland
Mary''. Margaret Chalmers, ''Her face so truly heavenly fair. Mrs
McLehose, my Clarinda: ''Naething could resist my Nancy!'' What might
have been! Anyway, I had no choice but to settle for Jean who was a good
singer and a good sort. Of all the women in my life, Jean was the most
genial.
What do you think of the National Lottery? (Grahame Burgess, 15)
Not a lot. I lived most of my life in honest poverty and did not need
a lot of money so could do without a lottery of cash. I gave away my
songs for a song. Even with my penny-pinching publisher I found it
difficult to mention the matter of money though, alas, money matters and
now more than ever. I remember writing my lines on a bank-note and
calling it a ''cursed leaf''. I never thought I'd live to see the day
when my own head appeared on a bank-note but you have lived to see my
face featured on the Clydesdale Bank fiver. Some cheek!
Do you think there is still a place today for your poems? (Nicola
Fraser, 15)
Yes. Your place and beyond. I wrote my poems to last a lifetime and
beyond and they have given me a life after death. Otherwise I would not
still be speaking to you and you and you and singing to Scotland and
beyond. I live through your love.
Your 200th anniversary is coming up. How would you like to see it
celebrated? (Pippa Watson, 15)
In style. Chronologically, 1996 will be a celebration of my death but
I hope it will be a celebration of my life. I don't want to be
worshipped as a plaster saint or as a sinner who was often plastered. I
want to be remembered as a man who tried his best to make creative sense
of a senselessly destructive world. Make a song and dance about me.
Questions from Garnock Academy, Kilbirnie, Ayrshire:
Why did you want to go to Jamaica? (Fraser McLean and Mark McQuarrie)
I'll let you into a secret. I didn't. I wanted to stay in Scotland and
I did. I put about the story of emigrating as a ploy to play on the
sympathies of Scotland. I reckoned that if I promoted myself as the
authentic voice of Scotland -- ''O never, never Scotia's realm desert''
-- Scots would do what they could to keep that voice at home. And they
did.
If Mary Campbell had not died, do you think you would have stayed with
her, even though Jean's father had allowed you to marry her? (Linda
Smith, Jacqueline Smith, and Elizabeth Howatson)
Mary, the mistress I turned into a muse, remains a mystery to me. I
know I sang about going to the Indies with my Mary but don't believe
everything you read in books: ''Some books are lies frae end to end.'' I
have confessed I was not serious about going to Jamaica so obviously I
was not serious about running, or sailing, away with her. I might have
married her here but I'm not sure if she would have married me as I've
not had a chance to talk to Mary in Heaven, worse luck.
How did your stay in Edinburgh change your outlook on life? (Fraser
McLean and Mark McQuarrie)
I was a poet who became a pet in Edinburgh. A pet literary lion tamed
by the Edinburgh establishment. I foolishly allowed myself to be
patronised and matronised by lords and ladies who paraded me as their
pet but did little to help me as a poet. Edinburgh was an experience I
could have done without. My ''Address in Edinburgh'', now I look back on
it, is probably my worst poem. It's too obviously insincere.
What were the main influences on you as a poet? (Susan McTaggart and
Lynn Currie)
Everything I experienced and everything I read and that's saying a lot
though I say it myself. I loved the English poems of Milton and Pope and
Shenstone, the Scots poems of Ramsay and Fergusson -- ''Ill-fated
Genius! Heaven-taught Fergusson.'' Fergusson was shamefully treated in
Edinburgh so I suppose I should have known better than to advertise my
adoration for his work in Edinburgh. Without the spark of Fergusson,
there would be no Burns.
What religious views do you hold, and in what ways did they influence
your work? (Robert Milne)
As I wrote to a mate of mine: ''of all Nonsense, Religious Nonsense is
the most nonsensical.'' I detest religious dogma though I would never
describe myself as an atheist. I regularly attended church and I believe
in a Great Being. I was brought up on sermons and prayers and they
undoubtedly affected what I wrote. Tam o' Shanter ends up as a mock
sermon complete with moralistic message denouncing drink and bewitching
women in short skirts. My song about brotherly love ends up as a prayer:
''Then let us pray that come it may''.
Who do you admire in modern Scottish poetry, and why? (Ryan Gibb and
Iain Dickson)
Hugh MacDiarmid because he wrote so much about me. In his prose he
criticised my verse as anti-intellectual and xenophobic which is absurd
as is evident when you consider my range of reference and international
appeal. In his finest verse, significantly, he appealed to me . His
immortal Drunk Man says: ''Rabbie, wad'st thou wert here -- the warld
hath need,/And Scotland mair sae, o' the likes o' thee!'' MacDiarmid
savagely condemned the Burns Cult as I did before him when I wrote: ''I
see with frequent wringings of the heart, that the novelty of my
character and the honest, national prejudice of Scotchmen have borne me
to a height altogether untenable to my abilities.'' Most Scots remember
me as a saviour and forget I was a poet. MacDiarmid never forgot I was a
poet. Don't forget him.
What problems and issues would you write about if you were writing
today? (Andrew Beagrie and Antony McQuarrie)
Same old stuff, as the problems are much the same. Love and death and
man's inhumanity to man, woman and child.
If you had the chance to live your life again, would you change
anything, and if so, what? (Robert Milne)
My clothes. I always felt uncomfortable in breeches and boots. I can
see myself in loose-fitting suits.
Questions from Castle Douglas High, Castle Douglas:
In Address to the Deil you seem to have a fondness for ''Auld Nick.''
If he invited you to afternoon tea, would you accept? (Kathleen
Kirkpatrick, 16)
I don't know about tea. If he invited me to sup the demon drink with
him I'd be tempted. I'm supposed to be a bit of a devil after all,
heaven knows.
Which of your poems would you most like to be remembered for, and why?
(Kirsty MacConnochie, 16)
Tam o' Shanter. I always wanted to write an epic but never had enough
time to tether so I wrote a mock epic, an alcoholic odyssey that still
makes folk merry.
Were you critical of the Church because it disapproved of your
lifestyle? (Sara Proudfoot, 16)
Because it was inimical to individuality. At its worst the kirk, in my
time, tried to make every man, and woman, conform to a Calvinist
mentality and my mind rebelled against that. I helped the church to see
itself in a new light.
Did you consider Holy Willie's feelings? (Evan Finnegan, 16)
Of course, that being one of the points of the poem. Yet ''Holy
Willie's Prayer'' never appeared in print under my name in my lifetime.
My Holy Willie is not merely a self-portrait of one man, Willie Fisher,
but an account of an attitude.
What are your views on the monarchy? (Carole Jaszewski, 16)
I don't have views so much as a vision of a king or queen coming among
the common people. If the monarchy is to work, the monarch must work. In
my time I described the House of Hanover as ''An idiot race, to honour
lost'' and expressed republican views after the French Revolution.
However, I was both Jacobin and Jacobite as I always loved a loser and
lamented the fate of Bonnie Prince Charlie, that ''poor, friendless
wand'rer''. The present Prince Charlie seems, if you can believe the
press, another poor, friendless wanderer so he has my sympathy. He just
might have the common sense to have more of the common touch than his
mum and dad.
Were you impressed with Walter Scott when you met him? (Stephen
Barbour, 16)
Yes. He was only 15 when I met him in Edinburgh but he impressed me
with his good memory -- he correctly identified an obscure poem for me
-- and his intelligent manner and excellent manners. He couldn't hold a
candle to me as a poet for my best work burns intensely -- ''I burn, I
burn, as when thro' ripened corn/By driving winds the crackling flames
are borne'' -- and he could only manage light verse. As a novelist he
was the man who put the Tory into Story but he did a great job in
selling Scotland as Scott-land. A great gift to the Scottish tourist
industry. A literary industrialist.
At what time were you happiest, and most satisfied with your work?
(Julie Gowans, 16)
I was never a conventionally happy man as I lived a hard life:
''There's nought but care on ev'ry han',/In every hour that passes, O''.
I was happiest at home, seeing visions in the flames of my own fire: ''I
sat and ey'd the spewing reek''.
Questions from sixth year pupils at Liberton High, Edinburgh:
What is your biggest regret? (Darren Higgins)
I never met James Boswell. I tried to. I wrote to his cousin and asked
for an introduction but I was a poor man's son and Bozzy was a rich
man's son so that was that. Bozzy was a Tory and a toady and I had a
reputation as a radical and a rank outsider. Still, we both loved drink
and driving women wild and I reckon we would have got on famously. If
Bozzy had met me and written my biography that would have been the last
word on the subject of myself but he didn't so people are still
searching for a key to my character. A shame about Bozzy.
Do you ever speak to Holy Willie these days? What's he up to? (Craig
Dixon)
Holy Willie is still alive and well and living in Scotland. Like you,
I see him everywhere.
Did you really love all the women who mothered your children, or did
you just say you did to get them into bed? (Stephanie McMillan)
I loved them all though I was not in love with them all.
Are any of the Tam O' Shanter characters based on anyone you know, or
did you make them up? (Stephanie McMillan)
I did recollect some characters I met when I went to school in
Kirkoswald in 1775 so Tam is loosely based on Douglas Graham of Shanter
farm, Souter Johnie on John Davidson, a shoemaker who lived near Shanter
farm, and so on. But my poem is more than portraiture so you can forget
my models and just remember to read the poem as an imaginative
adventure.
Questions from St Joseph's College, Dumfries:
What inspired your poetry? (Glen Sherman)
Nature's fire. Think of me as Burns by nature as well as name.
Why did you drink so much? (Emma Clow)
Drink is an oral culture in Scotland and a popular culture at that. I
started drinking seriously at the age of 16 and drank until I died, so
much so that some folk say I drank myself to death. I lifted my spirits
with claret, port, rum, gin and whisky -- usquabae -- and enjoyed myself
when drunk. Mind you, I had my unfair share of horrific mornings after,
suffering in mind and body and soul. Drink was a good friend to me but I
also feared the demon drink: ''Wi' usquabae, we'll face the Devil!''
Remember Tam!
How's Elvis? (Marcus Card)
I'm glad you asked after Elvis who has a lot in common with me. I, who
celebrated the common man as ''king o' men'', am regarded as royalty in
Scotland and Elvis, of course, was called The King. We were both humbly
born, both sported sideburns, both loved songs and the lasses, both
played stringed instruments -- I could, as my wife said, ''step a tune''
on the fiddle, he could strum the guitar. The only time Elvis set foot
in Scotland was at Prestwick, in Burns Country. He's fine and dandy. As
immortal as myself.
Questions from Ardrossan Academy, Ayrshire.
How would you vote in the next General Election? (John Seal, sixth
year)
I was a voteless versifier in my lifetime so this would be a new
experience. I deplored the loss of Scottish independence in the
parliamentary union of 1707 -- when a parcel of rogues reduced the
Scottish nation to the region of North Briton -- and would be tempted to
vote for the Scottish Nationalists though I find them a trifle too Tory.
I like the red, red rose of the Labour Party though I find Labour's
Scottish establishment a trifle too Tory. I'll tell you when the time
comes but you can be sure I won't be telling you to vote Tory even
though the Tory story supposedly goes along the lines constructed by
Adam Smith, a great Scot who greatly admired my verse. I can see Adam
and he supports me.
Why do you prefer to use animals to show the mistakes that humans
make? (Stuart Forrest)
I had a natural empathy with animals. My father was a farmer and I
followed in his footsteps and when I mangled a mouse's nest in 1785 I
thought of my father who had died the year before after being tormented
by insensitive souls. I also thought of myself. I suffered agonies from
panic attacks and could easily identify with a creature driven to
distraction: ''Wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim'rous beastie,/O, what a panic's
in thy breastie!'' I was speaking for myself in the first two lines of
the poem.
How many letters have you received from the Child Support Agency? What
do you think of it? (Kate Ashton, fifth year)
Burns only knows how many bairns I had. I did what I could for the
bairns I recognised as mine but no doubt I missed some. So far the Child
Support Agency has left me alone. I don't think the Agency has addressed
itself to fathers who art in heaven.
At what age did you write your first poem? (Catherine Smith, first
year)
I wrote my first song when I was 15: ''Oh, once I lov'd a bonie
lass,/Ay and I love her still!'' Thus with me began Love and Poesy.
Burns was ghosted by Alan Bold, author of A Burns Companion
(Macmillan, 1991) and editor of Rhymer Rab: An Anthology of Poems and
Prose by Robert Burns (Black Swan, 1993).

THE businessman behind a radical plan to buy a Scottish rugby club
wants to stem the drain of Scotland's top players to wealthy English
clubs.
John Connor, who runs the wastepaper re-cycling operation Stirling
Fibres from the former British Steel plant at Gartcosh, is advertising
in the next issue of Scottish Rugby magazine seeking takers for his
unique venture.
He heads the consortium -- which does not identify itself but provides
only a box number for replies -- that wants to take over control of a
first or second division club.
Yesterday Connor, a former president of the Forrester FP club in
Edinburgh, conceded that he was the moving force behind the plan.
He has already had a hand in one of the most innovative rugby ventures
in recent years. The River Series knock-out cup competition, taken over
more recently by Alloa Breweries, was his brainchild.
Despite the fact that it did not attract support from the Border
clubs, and had only lukewarm backing from the Scottish Rugby Union, it
will be seen as the forerunner to an official cup competition which is
likely to get under way next year.
''A lot of rugby people are concerned at the way in which wealthy
English clubs can attract our top players south of the Border. Just now
we have Derrick Patterson and Rob Wainwright at West Hartlepool. Have
you ever seen West Hartlepool?
''I think we have to face reality and be honest. The reason why
players are attracted to places like that is because these clubs have
wealthy backers and they can offer attractive job packages and all the
rest of it.''
The exodus of Scotland's star rugby players to clubs in England is
something which is concerning the Scottish Rugby Union as well and
currently plans are afoot to provide career assistance for players who
might be attracted south but, if the right jobs materialised, could be
persuaded to remain in Scotland.
Only last week the Scotland centre Gregor Townsend said that when he
graduates from university this summer then, in his quest for a suitable
job, he would be likely to enlist with Ian McGeechan's Northampton side.
Townsend is just one of a dozen top Scotsmen who have signed provisional
forms for English sides.
Yesterday, Connor said: ''At the moment this is just a case of casting
a fly on the water and seeing if anything takes. We have to keep our
best players in Scotland and this is as good a way of doing it as any,''
he said.
Connor and his, as yet, unnamed colleagues maintain that they don't
want to become involved with a rugby club in order to make money.
At the weekend SRU international board member Freddie McLeod warned
any clubs which might be interested to be careful. He feared that the
then unidentified businessmen might be after a quick killing with a
hidden agenda of selling a rugby ground for supermarket development.
Yesterday Connor said: ''We're not in this to make money. We want to
become involved because we care about Scottish rugby. Of course we don't
want to make a loss but anybody who takes this kind of thing on with the
intention of making money out of it can just forget it. That isn't what
we are about at all.
''This is at a very early stage just now and, once we have determined
the level of support, we would have to put together a business plan and
find out whether it is feasible. We are, though, quite serious and know
of one or two clubs that have already expressed an initial interest,''
he said.

IN 1994, the band of the year was without a doubt Manchester rockers
Oasis.
They had consecutive hits with singles 'Supersonic', 'Shakermaker',
'Live Forever' and 'Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol' from their debut album,
Definitely Maybe, and rounded off the year with with Chistmas No.3
position for their latest offering, 'Whatever'.
They also enjoyed four sell-out tours of the UK, the last of which
featured a date at the Barrowlands in Glasgow. Due to reasons which will
be explained later, the concert was a disaster and they decided to
replay the gig on the 27th of December.
Shortly before the second Barrowlands concert, I met up with guitarist
Bonehead, aka Paul Arthur, who explained what happened at the disastrous
first show.
''We've been touring, like, for the last 15 months, and in between
we've been doing TV and radio, so it's been non-stop all over the place
and it just got to that point where there was too much strain on Liam's
(Gallagher) voice. So he's a couple of songs into the set and his voice
left him, you know. He was gutted. He didn't want to go off but he had
to 'cause he couldn't sing.''
After the departure of singer Liam, his elder brother Noel, the Oasis
guitarist and songwriter, managed to avert a riot by taking control of
the show.
''There was a bit of a panic at first 'cause he went off with this
problem in his voice -- later on he had to see a specialist in London
for it -- so it's like, 'what do we do? We could cancel the show now and
arrange it for another day but there's 2000 kids out there who are gonna
go mad, so we've gotta do something,' so Noel says, 'Forget it, I'll go
on and do an acoustic.'''
Fortunately, this is not an unusual thing, as on most Oasis B-sides
you will find one of Noel's acoustic tracks, and a short Noel-only
acoustic stint is now a regular pre-encore treat at Oasis gigs.
A short while before they embarked on their last UK dates, Oasis
toured Japan for a couple of weeks which was the band's first real
encounter with total hysteria.
''Japan was unbelievable. It was a big shock because we didn't know
what to expect. Noel had been there before a few years ago when he was
working as a roadie, but when he went the audiences were all sat down
and polite, just clapping at the end of each song. So he said to us
'don't expect a wild crowd when you get there, it's gonna be pretty laid
back, 'cause that's just the way the Japanese are.' So we went there
thinking, you know, 'what's it gonna be like?..it's gonna be dead weird,
with a little polite audience.'
''We got there and we were mobbed ... at the airport, at the hotel, at
the gig. We couldn't even go shopping. And the gig was just wild. I've
never seen kids go mad like that. They were just totally mad for it.''
Having now played all over the place, how does Bonehead compare the
crowds around the world?
''Well they're all different. I mean, in Japan they all go mad ...
they follow you down the street screaming, and they're at your hotel,
and they all bring you presents. By the end of the tour, we had like a
bus full of presents. They bring everything from rare Beatles records to
clothes and computer games, and it's totally weird. Every single person
in the audience must have brought us a present every night.
''In that respect then, the Americans are, like, a bit reserved and a
bit scared to let themselves go loose, but we did go down well there ...
It was a result. We'd never been there before, and we'd just released
our first single, so a lot of the gigs we were doing were small venues.
But every night was sold out and there were people locked out. As we
moved up the East Coast, we did New York, Washington, places like that
and we were playing to 800 or 1000-strong crowds. Every night was sold
out. It was a result.''
Japan and the US may both have been results, but where Oasis have done
best is here in Britain, where they have been hailed as everything from
the saviours of Rock 'n' Roll, to the New Beatles, the Fab Five. Either
way they are currently the hottest band in the country and the best
measure of their success is the success of their album, Definitely
Maybe. It was released last August, just as they had broken into the top
ten with the single Live Forever, and were adorning the front cover of
every music magazine in the country.
The album is the biggest-selling debut album of all time and went
platinum at the end of last year. Were the band surprised by its
success? Bonehead certainly wasn't.
''We totally expected it. Well, we had the three singles out as well
before it. So, with each one charting higher and higher as they came
out, it soon became pretty obvious that Definitely Maybe was gonna go
No. 1. Going gold was a result, but I for one didn't expect it to go
platinum, at least so soon.''
And finally, how good do Oasis think they are?
''Well, without a doubt, we're the best band in Britain right now.
''Look around, who else is there? I could count on one hand the decent
bands in this country right now, and that's including us. There's us,
there's Paul Weller, there's Verve and there's Portishead.
''Good music. Oasis is a good band playing good music.''
Definitely.

CELTIC -- and Paul McStay -- packed up their troubles yesterday and
headed for Malaga on the Costa del Sol. The idea is to distance the
players from their woes, but it might not work out that way.
Tommy Burns took a mixture of experienced and younger players
numbering 18 to Malaga where they will meet Real Madrid tonight in a
match arranged for the benefit of Spanish television, and there are two
ways of looking at the trip.
On the one hand, it could provide Celtic with the lift their spirits
require right now, but, on the other, Real could make the premier
division side feel even more inadequate. Naturally, Burns believes the
break will do his players the world of good and, so far as his club
captain is concerned, he might be correct.
McStay, who has had to watch Celtic's past three matches from a seat
in the stand, will start against the leaders of the Spanish first
division and, while he could have wished for an easier game in which to
re-establish his credentials, he is prepared to grasp his opportunity.
''It has felt like a long time,'' he said of his brief spell on the
outside, ''but I'm ready to come back in and play.
''The longer a player sits out, the greater the chance his fitness and
touch will desert him and I'll be happy to get this game even though
Real Madrid are a top quality side.''
The midfield player, whose contract expires at the end of the season,
was dropped because Burns was unhappy with the creative side of his
game, but if Celtic are to protect their credibility tonight McStay and
John Collins, in particular, will have to perform.
The club don't need another humiliating experience like the one
inflicted when they played Liverpool in Ian Rush's testimonial game in
December.
Liverpool won 6-0 and Burns has to hope that kind of defensive
haemorrhaging is an illness of his team's past. Celtic will receive
something like #20,000 from playing in Malaga, but that would seem an
insignificant amount if the roof should fall in again.
''There are always positive and negative sides to anything you do and
we must make sure we get as much as possible from this game,'' Burns
said.
''We have not been in Europe for a while and this game will give us a
taste again. Also, it will give the players a chance to learn and that
is important.
''The younger players will see how others play this game and they will
also be given an idea of the standards required. That will not be a bad
thing for any of them.''
Burns added McStay, Jim Slaven, Stuart Gray, and Charlie Nicholas to
the squad which drew 1-1 at Tynecastle on Saturday, and the chances are
Nicholas, who has been a longer time in exile from the first team than
McStay, could also feature in the game. His legs may have gone, but
Nicholas remains sharp upstairs and speed of thought could be vital
against the Spaniards, who have exceptional talents in Michael Laudrup
and Zamorano.
''Apart from bringing McStay in, I might make one or two other
changes,'' said Burns, who will be looking for Phil O'Donnell to make
more of the penetrating runs which are supposed to be a feature of his
play and which prompted Celtic to pay Motherwell #1.75m for the midfield
player.
O'Donnell's progress since his transfer has been hampered by injuries,
but he feels ready now to exert an influence on the side. He scored a
wonderful goal against Hearts, a sight which gladdened Burns.
''Phil could be our top scorer by now but he has not taken all the
chances which have come his way,'' Burns said.
The manager once again dismissed the speculation that McStay will be
leaving the club and pointed out that there will always be a place for
him with Celtic provided he regains full form. Burns also suggested that
McStay may have become a victim of his own success.
''In the first six years of his career here Paul was outstanding, but
it is impossible to sustain such standards over a period twice that
long,'' Burns said.

THE referee in the Benn-McClellan fight insisted yesterday that he was
not to blame for not stopping the fight before the 10th-round knockout.
''It was a violent fight, but it was close and nothing allowed me to
stop it,'' Frenchman Alfred Asaro said.
''Until the 10th round, McClellan never gave the impression that he
was in trouble. He was leading for two judges and the third had it a
draw.
''If I had felt that one boxer was in trouble I would have stopped the
match,'' said Asaro, who had previously refereed only one world
championship bout.
''None of them complained to me about anything.''
Asaro said McClellan's cornermen could have called the doctor if they
had felt their boxer was unwell.
''He had difficulties breathing and he couldn't hold his gumshield. He
told them he had headaches,'' Asaro said.
''When a boxer is tired and says so, his cornermen can react. They can
ask one of the three doctors to take a look at their boxer during the
minute's rest.
''Only the referee can stop the bout, but the minute's rest belongs to
the cornermen.''
However, promoter Frank Warren criticised the selection of Azaro. ''It
would help to have an English-speaking referee when you have two English
speaking boxers.''
Warren continued: ''I don't think the referee could speak English. And
I don't think he could understand it either.''
He was concerned that McClellan may have tried to communicate his
distress to Azaro in the ninth round after an accidental head-butt, but
the referee didn't understand him.
McClellan's camp also criticised Azaro, saying he should have counted
out Benn when he was knocked through the ropes in the first round.
''I think the referee is a jerk and should not be allowed to referee a
dogfight,'' said trainer Stan Johnson.

KIRSTY Young was strolling along a corridor in The High School of
Stirling when an eager group of youngsters approached her.
''Can Hazel get your autograph?''
Hazel produced a stub of paper, Kirsty obligingly signed.
''Where are you lot going?'' asked Mr Angus Leitch, assistant head
teacher.
''Science,'' came the reply.
''This is a funny way to go to science.''
''Yes, but we wanted to have a look at Kirsty.''
So did everybody else who could find an excuse. Boys and girls alike,
they gazed admiringly at the charismatic Scottish TV personality who,
just over eight years ago, was still a pupil at the school. She now
presents, twice a week, the live discussion show Kirsty. What a role
model for young ambitions!
She left the High School at the end of 1986. ''I had five O-grades and
two Highers -- an A in art and a B in English. I worked in a restaurant
till the summer, then spent a year as an au pair in Geneva and
Barcelona.
''A weekend's work as a cameraman's assistant led to a job as a runner
(doing all sorts of mundane things), then production assistant with a
small advertising company, then to joining the BBC as a continuity
assistant. I branched out into radio broadcasting, after which came the
offer from Scottish TV.''
Kirsty ''really enjoyed'' going back to Stirling High. Her older
sister Laura -- a freelance producer with an independent company -- and
younger brother Ian -- taking a college course in camera studies and
direction -- were also pupils there.
''My first boyfriend,'' she recalled, ''was Liam McLeod, captain of
the rugby team. His mum taught art in the school. I wanted the head
teacher of the time to start a girls' rugby team, but he wasn't having
it.''
She regarded the school as strict. ''I never got detention,'' she
explained, ''but there were a few bawlings out in the corridor. A music
teacher, Mr Melville, gave me a terrible row once.''
''You must have been a real bad one,'' Mr Leitch interjected in
amazement. ''I never heard wee Mr Melville bawl out a living soul.''
The fragrances wafting through the home economics corridors struck a
chord with Kirsty. ''That smell was there in my day,'' she reminisced.
''The memories -- measuring out flour, making blancmange and finding
lumps of flour in it.''
Teachers had vivid recollections of her. Her form teacher, Mrs Fay
Morrison, administering the Standard Grade PE prelim, still found time
to greet her with obvious affection. ''You and your pal Jenny used to
sit at the front. You already had that lovely deep voice. The pair of
you were so mature and your chat was wonderful.''
''But you weren't so keen on my basketball -- you said I wasn't
aggressive enough,'' Kirsty reminded her.
And so to the modern languages area. Mr Gordon Smith taught Kirsty
Russian for two years. Why Russian? ''I thought I was being terribly
avant-garde and displaying two fingers to the world.''
Mr Smith remembered her deep interest in drama. ''That seemed to be
where her ambitions lay,'' he said. ''As for Russian, she was average,
perhaps a little above. Her accent was superb. Grammar? Let's just say
Russian grammar is very difficult.''
Time for Kirsty's only concession to pride. ''I was in the BBC
newsroom three years ago. There was a panic to find a volunteer to speak
to somebody in Moscow. I did it. It worked.''
Her last visit was to her art teacher, John Carberry. ''He was a great
teacher, and very funny,'' she enthused. ''Such originality -- you never
knew what to expect.''
''Kirsty was bright and mature,'' Mr Carberry recalled. ''She wasn't
so keen on art as such, but she enjoyed the interaction in the art room.
She was good at drawing and painting, but she fancied watercolours and
it's not that easy.''
At school, Kirsty was very much her own person. As Gordon Smith
explained, ''She was always one for expressing her own opinions. If it
wasn't frowned upon at the time, it wasn't exactly encouraged either.''
Now that Kirsty has soared so high so soon, what does the future hold?
''I would like to stay in front of camera and try a variety of formats.
The trick in every case is getting the balance right -- remembering that
everything doesn't revolve around you -- asking the questions the
viewers would ask.''
At the end of her nostalgic visit the head teacher, Mr Greig Ingram,
presented Kirsty with a polo shirt bearing the school logo, a house
badge and an honorary prefect's badge.
She hadn't been a prefect and was touched by the gesture -- ''I'll
wear it all night,'' she promised. Even to celebrities, roots are
important.
James Nisbett (1st year): At what age did you decide to get into
television?
I never really decided as such. At school I was interested in drama,
so that was a start. Then I came to realise that there was a whole world
both in front of, and behind, the cameras. I was about 18 before I knew
the direction I was going.
Gillian Seale (1st year): What was your favourite subject at school?
Did your teachers influence you?
English when I started, art by the time I left. Though teachers did
influence me, it tended to relate to how good I was at a subject. But
nothing would have made me good at chemistry.
Carolyn Murray (3rd year): How did you actually get into television?
By a circuitous route. I didn't go to college. I did unglamorous jobs,
not staying in one place for long until I got into the BBC. That's the
best place to learn the trade.
Jonathan Savage (3rd year): What ambitions did you have at school?
''To get out. Seriously, I was one of those people who want to do
something but don't know exactly what. Being into drama and debating --
though I was a poor debater -- at least pointed me in the right
direction.''
Alison Hancock (4th year): Do you ever have difficulty thinking of
questions to ask guests? Is it difficult to control the audience?
No, I've never dried up or gone bright red. There are always fallback
questions like 'What happened next?' I love live TV, the flow of
adrenalin puts you into overdrive. I don't mind if I have to quieten the
audience -- it makes for a good programme. But I always talk to them
beforehand.
Jenny McPhail (4th year): Were you involved with our school newspaper,
High Times? Is appearance important in your work?
I wrote some articles, but they were pompous and badly constructed.
Appearance matters -- on radio you need to sound confident, on TV you
have to look good. You learn by trial and error. I had my hair cut
short. I choose my clothes to suit myself. Of course, if I turned up in
leather mini-skirt and thigh-length boots, I would probably hear about
it.
Neil Hutchison (6th year): What was the biggest influence on your
present career and what would you have done if you hadn't gone into TV?
I worked as a runner on Grandstand, watching presenters like Murray
Walker and thinking, 'I could do this'. If it hadn't worked out, I think
I would have gone to college for A-levels and then to university.
James Nisbett: Are you into health and fitness?
Very much so. At school I was keen on basketball, now I work out at
8.15 in the morning and go running. I need lots of energy in my work and
it pays off -- I am easy to fit with clothes.
Jonathan Savage: Do you ever feel for your guests?
Yes. Some have very distressing, harrowing stories. You can't always
say to them what you want to, and you can't always expect them to tell
their personal stories to a mass audience.
Neil Hutchison: Do you have much say in choosing the topics?
There's an executive producer, other producers and researchers and
myself. We sit round a table and discuss ideas for the series, then the
researchers go off and invesigate the feasibility. The final say rests
with the executive producer.

BOXER Gerald McClellan is showing ''some improvement'', neurosurgeon
John Sutcliffe reported last night.
Mr Sutcliffe, who operated to remove a huge blood clot from McLellan's
brain, said the next 24 hours would be crucial if the 27-year-old
American was to make a full recovery.
The Royal London Hospital surgeon added that McClellan's condition
remained ''critical but stable'' throughout the course of yesterday.
He added: ''Luckily there has been some improvement.''
One or two problems concerned with the pressure inside the boxer's
head had been controlled, he said.
But the 35-year-old surgeon added that if his condition remained
stable for the next 24 hours, with no complications, he was probably
over the worst.
''All the time that passes is time in his favour,'' Mr Sutcliffe said.
However, he added that it was possible McClellan had lost more brain
cells since the operation on Saturday night.
The surgeon also warned that the injuries McClellan received could
lead to a change in personality or problems with concentrating in the
future.
''Almost any long-term effect can happen, but if everything is dealt
with quickly, then the effects can be minimal. We would hope he would
make a good recovery,'' he said.
Mr Sutcliffe said McClellan's family, including Angela Brown, his
girlfriend and mother of his eight-month-old daughter Forrest, were
''clearly distressed'' and remained at the boxer's bedside.
A spokesman for the hospital said that the family -- who flew into
London on Sunday night on Concorde -- were unwilling to comment on
McClellan's condition or their feelings ''for the time being''.
Dr Sutcliffe had said earlier of his patient: ''I think he will never
fight again.''
And he went on: ''It was quite a vicious fight. I am surprised it went
as far as it did.''.
Pressed for his views on boxing as a sport, the surgeon said that
although it was ''obviously dangerous'', more brain injuries were
sustained nationally through other sports including motor racing,
horse-riding, mountain climbing, and hang-gliding.
''The whole boxing debate will continue and will be fuelled every time
something like this happens,'' he said. ''It is devastating for the
boxer involved and terrible for the family.
''But boxers know the risks they are taking when they enter the ring,
and I imagine a lot of boxers will be watching what happens here with
great interest.''

BRITISH Board secretary John Morris called yesterday for a ''FIFA of
boxing'' to standardise safety in the wake of the Nigel Benn-Gerald
McLellan fight.
Morris will have many supporters -- notably promoter Don King -- when
he insists that British is best when it comes to action on medical
procedures and precautions in the hardest game of all.
And Morris wants that level of supervision spread across the world in
one overall body instead of four ruling organisations -- the WBC, WBA,
IBF, and more recently and less recognised, the WBO.
While American McClellan lay on a life support system in the Royal
London Hospital following Saturday's savage WBC super-middleweight title
fight, Morris said:
''I think the need is now highlighted for one world boxing commission
to control the basic elements of regulations, particularly medical ones.
''Boxing needs a FIFA. I've suggested this before, but have been a
lone voice in the wilderness because, obviously, a lot of the world
organisations don't want it.
''But I believe the commissions of the world should get together and
issue the same safety regulations.
''And I hope we would have an input in that, and I hope we lead the
way. If not, I want to meet the others and find out what they do.
''I'm doing that all the time. I'll be speaking to the Americans about
this when I'm in Las Vegas shortly, to find out what is going on in the
US.
''I'd like to see the same regulations, safety procedures, and rules.
I'd like to see that blossom, not only for championship fights, but that
no boxer, even in a 10-rounder, will be allowed to fight unless he is
fit to do so.''
King witnessed first hand the swift action that ensured McClellan
gained that ''golden hour'' and gave surgeon John Sutcliffe extra time
to perform his crucial operation.
Flamboyant showman King wants America to follow the British example,
saying: ''I'm going to be the driving force to make certain it does. I'm
going to emphasise what I saw here.
''Gerald had the best of care, and now we can all collectively pray
that this young man will have a speedy recovery and move on in his life.
''I'm impressed by all the action displayed by the British Board. It
should be conditional in boxing. It could be lifesaving.
''This is a high risk business, this is a hurt business. Benn and
McClellan were gladiators, warriors, and in the fight Benn's courage was
exemplary.''
Benn's manager, Peter DeFreitas, believes the WBC champion --
suffering with a painful jaw and sore shoulder -- will fight on, but
there will be no decision or announcement while McClellan is still
staging his fightback from his 10th round defeat.
Meanwhile, the tragedy triggered fresh demands for boxing to be
banned, a campaign that has been led for years by the British Medical
Association.
But the British boxing community called a news conference ysterday to
defend the sport and it's safety procedures.
''Yuy'll never silence the critics,'' said John Morris, ''I think the
sport has to go on the front foot. I just want boxing to be treated as
another risk sport.''
Fight promoter Frank Warren said: ''The bottom line is boxing is a
dangerous sport. The fighters are aware of the dangers of boxing. They
are aware of the risk.''
Added Don King: ''If you followed those people who say if one bad
thing happens in a sport you ban it, then we wouldn't have any sport at
all.''
Morris and Warren said the sport had improved its medical safeguards,
noting that an anaesthetist, four doctors, two sets of paramedics and
two ambulances were on site for Saturday's fight at the London Arena.
The immediate treatment McClellan received was credited with saving his
life.
''What happened Saturday night and the measures we had at ringside is
probably the best you could get other than having an operating theater
at ringside,'' Warren said.
''We were satisfied that everything that should have been done was
done,'' Morris said. ''If there are improvements that should be made, we
will make them. It is our duty to do as much as we can.''

THE HERALD SEVEN-A-SIDES UPDATE . . . . . . DICK LOUDEN REPORTING
IT would be wonderful to possess Eric Cantona's skills without his
excesses. There is no better platform for young footballers to display
talent and good character than The Herald Seven-a-Sides, which have now
reached their final stages, to be played at Hampden Park on the evening
of Tuesday, March 7, along with the under-15 international between
Scotland and Brazil.
Many congratulations to the four schools which have reached the
ultimate stage. John Ogilvie High School of Hamilton will play St
Bride's High of East Kilbride and Peebles High will meet Our Lady and St
Patrick's High of Dumbarton, both matches taking place before the
under-15 international starts.
The winners will contest the final match during the half-time
interval. We shall tell you all about their great day in the next issue
of Schools Herald.
In the semi-finals, held at the Ibrox Community Complex, these four
teams were joined by four others -- Dumfries High, Holy Cross High
(Hamilton), Kirkcaldy High and Lornshill Academy (Alloa). Against the
backdrop of Ibrox Stadium, two mini-leagues were held. The skills and
enjoyment were there for all to admire, as was the emphasis on sporting
behaviour.
The organiser, Mr Tom Greene, put it succinctly: ''We do not want
parents, nor indeed teachers, dancing up and down sidelines like madmen.
Taking part and enjoying it is the important thing.''
Only one girl had survived to this stage -- Nicola Conroy from Our
Lady and St Patrick's, who took up football at the age of four ''because
all the boys in the street played''. She hadn't scored in the
tournament, but her teacher, Charles McGarvey, was adamant that ''she's
here on merit; she's an excellent passer, with a strong shot.''
How true! In the next match she scored two of the most spectacular
goals of the afternoon.
The referees were all senior pupils. Damian Black, who had come all
the way from Invergordon Academy, has been refereeing for several years.
''Seven-a-sides offer pupils a great chance,'' he said. ''It requires
greater skill, and there are fewer physical demands.''
I caught up with Mr Craig Brown, Scotland's team coach and the SFA's
director of coaching, at Firhill Sports Complex in Glasgow, where
primary seven-a-sides were taking place. He was accompanied by SFA
colleagues -- Jim Sinclair, Eric Black and Tommy Wilson -- in a
high-level demonstration of support for the seven-a-side principle,
enshrined in the SFA's Children's Development Plan.
Mr Brown recalled his years as a primary teacher. ''In Macalpine
Primary in Dundee, two football personalities -- Terry Christie (now
there's a topical name!) and Doug Houston -- and I ran full-sided teams.
I now realise the folly -- there weren't even substitutes in those days.
It would have been better to take a hundred kids in groups of seven.''
Later, he taught in Bellshill and was secretary of the Lanarkshire
Association. ''I had one really good player,'' he said. ''Andy Ritchie,
later of Celtic and Morton, ran games on his own. There was little
benefit for other boys.''
Mr Brown maintains that ''the small-sided game is the way forward --
for girls and boys. My predecessor, Andy Roxburgh, launched a new
strategy, but it failed because of entrenched attitudes, and the
shortage of facilities.''
The SFA is determined to succeed this time. ''The Football Trust and
the Sports Council are providing massive injections of finance and
expertise. With matching funding from the SFA -- and, we hope, income
from the National Lottery -- we are putting together an exciting player
development programme.''
Mr Brown pointed out that there will be 1,200 sets of the new
goalposts in use shortly. ''There have been fatalities in England and
Canada involving other goalposts -- these are the only ones bearing the
British Standard kitemark.''
Ross Mathie, the SFA's Youth Programme Director, explained: ''Schools
and clubs needn't pay the full price. With grant aid from the SFA, the
cost is #250 plus VAT and it may be possible to reclaim VAT. In
addition, some schools have received help from their education
authorities.''
Some sets of the new goalposts are still available from the SFA's
Technical Department.
* Semi-final results

WHAT in
the name
of Zordon
just
happened?
Why, we
just sat
through
a mad fad
in which
we saw . . .
'Everyone has heard the debate about children's TV; whether
or not this sort of 'fantasy' violence is ultimately
harmful to young and impressionable minds. In fact,
many of us may have become desensitised to the issue'
Beep beep ba-weep beeb beep!
SIX impossibly well-muscled young adults, apparently still in high
school, are hanging out in a juice bar (yeah, right). Their seemingly
wholesome PC banter actually involves sniggering at two other kids, one
under, the other overweight.
Suddenly they are transported to a mountain-top retreat where a huge
disembodied head and the world's first Jewish robot inform them that
their home town of Angel Grove (which, despite the fact that the whole
metropolis is made out of cardboard and plywood, is a really important
place) is being menaced by a giant man in a rubber suit.
What happens next is hard to explain. Everyone starts moving at twice
the speed they should. Gaudily-coloured Lycra is much in evidence.
Speech no longer corresponds to lip movement. A baffling array of
ridiculous-looking weapons and bestial vehicles, seemingly sent straight
from God, are noisily stuck together into an even bigger metallic
object, and the behemoth is soundly beaten.
Back at the juice bar, our heroes are once again laughing at someone
else's expense . . .
Beep beep ba-weep beep beep!
* WHAT in the name of Zordon just happened? Why, you just sat through
an episode of ''The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers'', everyone's
favourite hot media potato. Remember all the hubbub just before
Christmas? Camp sites outside Toys 'R' Us? The copycat killing of a
12-year-old girl in a Norwegian playground? Accusations of human rights
violations in Bangkok toy factories? No? Ah, the joys of society's
collective memory.
All that nastiness forgotten, we can look to a brighter future; the
White Ranger walks among mortal men!
Everyone has heard the debate about children's TV; whether or not this
sort of ''fantasy'' violence is ultimately harmful to young and
impressionable minds, and whether or not it is right to essentially
advertise toys and such within the plot of favourite shows. In fact,
many of us may have become desensitised to the issue.
However, I fear there may be even more concerning traces running
through these Rangers. Sickening schmaltz and vile politics.
The show itself. Cobbled together by Saban International, it consists
of American and Japanese sequences, spliced together into a 25-minute
whole. The American bits, usually at the start and end of these
adventures, offer the ''soap'' element. Tommy, Jason, Trini, Zack,
Kimberly and Billy, our rapidly ageing Californian teenagers indulge in
a sex, drug and rock 'n' roll free lifestyle that simply screams ''Hey,
kids! America may be a country facing more moral crises and
constitutional problems than you can count, but our ego's still huge,
God Bless Us!''
The Japanese segment, the meat in the sandwich and the advert for the
toys, harks back to Godzilla cinema and shows us that, despite its
power, the nation of Japan is still suffering from the same old
hang-ups, ie ''Our country may be tiny, heck, we may be tiny, but when
some really big enemy comes along (the West) we can whip it with out
technology! Ha Ha!''
The plot is formulaic, the special effects appalling and the
sentiments as plastic as the monsters. The theme tune is annoying in the
extreme, its release as a single some sort of twisted genius.
And then there are the toys, Bandai's current darling. They're the
same people who brought us Ninja/Hero Turtles, and ''couldn't keep up
with the demand'' for them either. Coincidence? The genuine articles are
actually quite well constructed, but beside them on the shelves are
gaggles of shoddy toys made to look and sound as similar to the real
thing without breaching copyright.
Misinformed grannies motivated into frenzied buying by screaming weans
who will just die if they don't get a Red Ranger, luxuriantly lined the
con artists' pockets in the weeks before Christmas. Cleverly, the Power
Rangers never do anything by themselves, and their dinosaur-like Zords
all combine into bigger and better robots. Therefore, there is no point
owning only the ones you like, you have to have them ALL!
And guess what? Those toys parents drew blood for have just become
obsolete. The Rangers now have all new Thunderzords, and the Green
Ranger has changed colour. More collectables, please! This watch the
show-see the characters-buy the characters-watch the show again to
confirm ownership of characters-see new characters cycle is a carefully
constructed ploy, only made possible by the decidedly blurry lines that
exist between Mr Saban and Mr Bandai. Maybe the same person?
Worst of all is the real reason why the Power Rangers bother me so
much more than any previous phenomenon. I've lost my youth. I can't join
in. My days of mindless consumption and dancing puppet style to the
conglomerates' tune are officially over. And that is what a modern
childhood is all about, right?

Does racism show its
ugly face at your school?
If so, it is reflecting
one of our society's
deepest problems. Here,
CAITLIN WATTS
(16) of St Kentigern's
Academy, Blackburn,
West Lothian, looks
back into the history
of people's divisions to
try to understand them
RACIAL prejudice is probably as old as mankind but racism as a serious
problem began in Britain with the slave trade in the eighteenth century
-- not through hatred, but because it was economically useful.
Once the foundation of economic profit had been laid it seemed easy
and useful to regard African slaves as inferior. This attempt at
justification soon began rumours which then became beliefs, not only
''justifying'' but advocating the slave trade and empire building.
The rulers of British and other Empires stressed how noble it was to
control less advanced or ''civilised'' peoples and that white supremacy
was necessary for human progress. This led to the near-elimination of
Indians in North and South America, and of Aborigines in Tasmania and
Australia.
When a child is born he/she does not pay attention to the colour of
someone's skin but to the love and kindness of their personality.
However, as children grow they are susceptible to major influences,
first through parents' attitudes and behaviour, then through relations,
friends, teachers, the media, clubs and peer groups.
With all this bombarding of children, it is hardly surprising to see
their attitudes shaped in the same mould. What we hear and see, we
become. With so much conditioned racism interwoven in our society, a
child is in danger of growing up, perhaps unconsciously, imbibing racist
attitudes. Is this a vicious circle that society has created for itself?
Many people have a naive, narrow view of race, whereas it covers a
great deal. The dictionary definition of ''race'' is ''a group of
persons having, or supposed to have, common ancestors and with similar
physical characteristics''.
It touches on factors such as skin colour, ethnic background,
nationality and culture.
The Race Issue is deep and complex. It is not merely a case of Black
and White. It can take many forms -- prejudice, discrimination and
racism -- which, though linked, are subtly different.
Prejudice usually comes from a lack of knowledge about someone or
something but still forming strong attitudes about it.
Discrimination occurs when people are treated less favourably because
of their racial, ethnic or national origins, and is shown through
people's actions rather than thoughts.
Racism has been defined as prejudice with power.
All three are based on the belief that some ''races'' are superior to
others; that different physical characteristics place some people above
others. However, scientists have long discredited the idea that people
can be separated into four basic ''races''. Psychologists claim the real
factors contributing to racial prejudice are grouping, scapegoating and
fear!
More than 5% of the British population are from ethnic minorities,
almost half of these born in Britain, nearly three-quarters British
citizens. Yet our society is still not free from negative racial
attitudes and there are overtly racist organisations like the National
Front and the British Movement.
Not everyone from an ethnic minority will be physically attacked
during their lives. However, many will experience ''conditioned'' racism
at some time. This type of racism, although deeply hurtful and
demoralising, often goes unchecked and unnoticed.
Officially racism is banned in Britain. The Race Relations Act of 1976
made racial discrimination or inciting racial hatred a criminal offence.
In 1991 the Prime Minister said: ''There should be no barriers of
background, no barriers of religion, no barriers of race. I want a
society that encourages each and every one to fulfil his or her
potential to the utmost.''
Yet racial discrimination is still rampant, as the table below
demonstrates:
..............................1991.....................1987-1989
.........................Unemployment................Bad Housing
White......................8%..........................6%
West Indian...............15%.........................12%
Indian....................12%.........................22%
Pakistani/Bangladeshi.....25%........................ 43%
Other.....................14%........................ 21%
Violent racism is on the increase. In 1988 there were 299 attacks and
in 1990 there were 636. However, it is estimated that only 4 in 100
attacks are ever reported.
In Scotland we should not assume that racial discrimination is an
English problem. We have our own ''home brew'' of ethnic and religious
bigotry.
Legislation can reduce but not wipe out racial inequality. The only
hope is a change of attitude. To rid ourselves of racism, in the
broadest sense, we must first acknowledge, then eliminate, the in-bred,
conditioned racism which runs throughout society. This cannot be done
overnight or by one means.
One way of contributing is through education, starting at a young age,
as respect and regard can be achieved through understanding rather than
ignorance. These attitudes would then be carried into adulthood and in
time form a new ''in-bred'' feeling -- one of equality.
* If you have views on the Race Issue or have witnessed or been
subject to racial harassment, let us know at Schools Herald.

CHELSEA are bracing themselves for another troubled episode of their
ill-starred season as up to 1700 ''renegade'' supporters follow the
London team to Bruges for tonight's European Cup Winners' Cup
quarter-final tie.
Belgian police have already expelled about 120 English fans after many
were involved in fights and disturbances.
A total of 27 were detained in the port of Ostend yesterday and more
than 30 in Bruges itself, some 15 miles inland, after brawls and
confrontations with authorities.
The remainder were being put back on ferries as soon as they arrived
because they had no tickets for tonight's game, a police spokesman said.
An angry Chelsea chief executive, Colin Hutchinson, said as he arrived
to be greeted by news of the first, predictable arrests: ''It's not
going to be good for Chelsea or the game in general if a few mindless
idiots go off like loose cannons.
''I don't believe we could have done more. We have appealed time and
again for fans without tickets not to travel.''
Chelsea expect few problems from their official party of 2100 fans,
who will travel under strict restrictions, hoping a late inspection will
allow the game to go ahead on the rain-soaked pitch.
A postponement to Thursday will heighten the nightmare for the
security forces, featuring 500 mounted and riot police, who are trying
to deal with parties of ticketless fans and those who have bought on the
black market.
A reported 1000 forgeries add to their problems.
As Belgium prepares for the tenth anniversary of the Heysel disaster,
the latest trouble is a stinging reminder of how a nagging disease has
yet to be healed.
Chelsea has already found itself caught up in the ''hooligan revival''
by the pitch invasion after a recent home cup tie against Millwall.
And there was the forced abandonment of England's game in Dublin
earlier this month.
''It's already been established that quite a few of the people in
Dublin were not football supporters and were organised,'' Hutchinson
said.
''We've just completed our report into the Millwall game. We brought
in Alan Beek, an ex-chief inspector, and he quickly established that,
prior to the invasion, mobile phones were being used.
''There seems to be political motivation.
''We had 350 police and 500 stewards; outside of Wembley, it was the
biggest operation for a football operation in recent times.''
Chelsea have already banned five supporters ejected from that game and
plan action against 31 others when court cases are completed. They will
similarly punish any fans in trouble in Belgium.
Large quantities of tickets are known to have been sold to Chelsea
fans for tonight's match, and Hutchinson admitted: ''There is a black
market throughout Europe.''
It will be up to the Belgian authorities to deal with breaches of
segregation.
Although ticketless fans were let into the 44,000 Prater Stadium in
Vienna in the last round, that will not be possible in the sold-out
18,000 Olympiastadion.

RANGERS manager Walter Smith will not be following up his interest in
Czech striker Tomas Skuhravy, of Genoa, whom he watched in the Guiseppe
Meazza Stadium on Sunday against Napoli. Smith insisted yesterday that
he had only gone to see the internationalist on a recommendation but,
whatever his reasons, it is certain that the Ibrox leader is not about
to bring the Genoa front player to Scotland.
''There is a lot of hysteria about us going out to buy a player just
now,'' he said, ''but it is only part of my job to go and look at
players who have been recommended. That is all I was doing yesterday.''
Clearly, however, the Czech did not perform well enough to have
kindled further interest and, as Smith pointed out that 99% of the
players he watches are not signed for Rangers, Skuhravy is not now a
front-runner for a job alongside Gordon Durie.
Smith went on to talk about the difficulties all managers face at this
time of the year when it comes to finding new players. ''People say I
should go out and strengthen the squad for Europe, if we are faced with
an early tie. This would get them accustomed to our ways in plenty of
time. That is true, but let me make two points.
''First, which Scottish player would they recommend who is available
and second, in Europe, teams are usually in the situation where they are
unable to sign any new players until the end of the season.
''Therefore, they are not eager to sell any of their own when they are
involved in cups or leagues or even relegation battles.''
Smith also reminded his listeners that Rangers have rarely been able
to sign players at this stage of the season for the aforesaid reasons.
The Ibrox manager will continue his screening of possible targets around
the Continent and at home but has accepted the probability that there
will be no new faces in the side until the work of this seaosn has been
completed.
''We know that after cutting down the size of the staff we have to
build it up again in different areas but it would be unusual if we got
someone we really want at this time of the year.''
He cited the transfer of Andy Cole to Manchester United as the only
major transfer of real significance in recent weeks. ''It is easy to say
'Go out and sign someone' but it is not so easy to do it.''
Skuhravy, who was also sized up by Smith's assistant, Archie Knox, did
not shine in the game which the Scottish pair found of a poor quality
and his team were beaten 1-0.
Although Rangers have lost Ally McCoist and Mark Hateley through
injury, Smith is quite willing to let the present staff get on with the
job of securing the championship in which they hold a long lead.
With Durie fit and playing again, the urgency up front is not the same
as earlier in the season when he was without Durie as well as the other
two.
Any further injury problems in that area would change that situation
radically, of course, but, so far, Smith has every intention of seeing
the league campaign through with the men currently in the dressing-room.
He has a couple of minor worries before the next hurdle, against Hibs
at Easter Road on Saturday, but Brian Laudrup, who has flu, and David
Robertson, who has a foot knock, should be fine by then.

By Joanne Storrar, a fourth year pupil at Denny High, Stirlingshire
AT Selhurst Park, on January 25, the hero Eric Cantona turned villain,
bringing shame to English football. He brought the game into disrepute,
turning many a young fan's dream to disappointment with his alleged
assault on a Crystal Palace ''fan''. The hero in the No.7 shirt had let
them down, ruined the dream, and, for many Cantona's actions will never
be forgiven.
His moment of madness has left the talented Frenchman's career and
English football's image in tatters. Can his actions be justified in any
way? How bad an effect will they have on younger supporters?
Periodically the media has whipped up speculation on what route
Cantona's career will take now, as noone can dispute the unique gift he
is blessed with. Cantona is an influential figure in the United team and
although he will not be a part of it this season, his passion for
football has always been evident. Sadly this passion has, too
frequently, been expressed in his fiery, often uncontrollable temper.
The main concern of the footballing authorities however, should not be
how best to deal with Cantona. It should be how to prevent a similar
incident recurring.
If footballers are permitted to behave badly during games, the paying
spectators are going to go elsewhere. Youngsters in particular seem to
have been affected greatly by the incident. But just how fairly and
accurately do these images represent the whole picture?
Although we should not try to excuse Cantona's actions, the blame is
not solely his and some consideration should be given to the underlying
causes.
Week in, week out, players are subjected to intolerable treatment.
Abusive and offensive language is continually hurled in their direction
yet, because they are professional footballers living in the public eye,
they must tolerate verbal insults and obscene gestures. There can be
little doubt that players have suffered prolonged provocation from adult
spectators.
This is the example that youngsters are getting every week at football
matches. Although their heroes' actions must inevitably influence them
to some extent, the behaviour of the older generation of supporters
seems to be influencing youngsters substantially more.
Not only is it adults who are hurling abuse at the footballers and,
more often than not, the officials too, but children as young as 10 are
copying the abusive behaviour of their elders, behaviour which they
obviously consider to be the norm.
Taking this into consideration, Matthew Simmons, the ''fan'' in the
incident, has failed every bit as much as Cantona has. Everyone seems to
forget he was no innocent by-stander.
If Cantona is forced to leave England his departure would be
football's loss. He is an extremely talented player with much still to
contribute to the game. English football would greatly miss him.
One thing, however, seems to be clear. The young fans were an element
in the love affair between the volatile Frenchman and English football.
Cantona has tainted this relationship. Is that not enough for everyone
involved?

Scotland have been given the draw they did not want for the men's
Spring Cup Volleyball Championships in Portugal in May. The Scots are
returning to the event after a two-year absence and face a tough opening
group which also includes England, Lithuania, and Italy Juniors.
Having had a close working relationship with England in recent years
as part of the development of the Great Britain side, Scotland coach
Tommy Dowens was keen to avoid his neighbours.
Dowens was hoping for matches against the likes of Norway or Austria
which would have given Scotland a better measure of where they currently
stand.
''It is not the ideal draw for us,'' admitted Dowens, ''As we are due
to face England and Lithuania in the Pan-European Cup in Oxford next
month. ''But we have spent two years preparing for this and we are
committed to travelling to the event.''
Dowens will not select his squad for the Spring Cup until after the
Pan-European Cup. With Dowens looking to Europe, two Scottish players
have their sights set further afield this week.
The London-based Audrey Cooper and Claire Paterson, who has lived in
Holland in recent years, will both play in the World Beach Championships
in Rio, which begin on Thursday.
Cooper and Glover, who have taken on a coach, are currently ranked
number one pairing in Europe and number 13 in the world. ''I feel
confident we can get into the Olympics if we continue to progress the
way have been,'' said Cooper.

A NEW COLUMN BY GERARD SEENAN THAT TACKLES THE MAJOR
MATTERS OF THE MOMENT: TODAY, THE ARRANGED MARRIAGE
ARRANGED marriages are anathema to Western culture. In a society where
everything from adverts to pop songs revolves around sex and, more
loftily, falling in love, they appear completely out of place. Yet,
statistically, arranged marriages have a better chance of survival than
those that result from meeting in a club.
However, a major qualification must be put on that kind of statement.
Divorce still carries an enormous stigma within Asian communities and
mismatched couples may be reluctant to consider it, particularly since
both partners' families will be heavily involved, not just the couple
themselves. Generally an arranged marriage is for life.
For many Asian youths the pressures to have an arranged marriage are
immense. If they refuse, they can be cut off from their family and
community, leaving them isolated.
Below, two women from the Glasgow area narrate their experiences of
arranged marriage -- showing that, for some, it can be wonderfully
successful, while for others, it can be wholly inappropriate.
AGAINST: CASE STUDY 1:
MIRA is 24 and of Muslim, Bangladeshi, descent. She has lived, unknown
to her parents, with her white, non-Muslim, partner Charlie for five
years and has been introduced to many prospective partners. She is
finding it progressively more difficult to hide the truth from her
family.
''The pressure is emotional and is beginning to build,'' she says.
''My parents wouldn't force me into a marriage but they get more anxious
and disappointed each time I turn down another offer.
''The worst scenario is that they'll stop speaking to me altogether.
It has happened to people I know -- one woman is even considered to be
dead by her father. I don't think my parents would come to terms with it
for a very long time, if ever,'' she says.
Mira lives eight miles from her parents and has daily contact with
them. Each day she goes through an elaborate system of precautions to
prevent the truth being discovered. ''We have all kinds of security
measures, like Charlie never answers the phone and if the doorbell rings
unexpectedly we always ignore it,'' says Mira.
The situation places strain on the couple's relationship, as Charlie
finds it difficult to understand her parents' attitude. ''This makes the
subject very difficult to discuss, which in turn causes a rift in our
relationship,'' she says. ''He can't believe their reaction would be so
severe, but I am certain it would.''
Mira is confident that an arranged marriage would be unsuitable for
her. She says: ''I don't want an arranged marriage for all sorts of
reasons. I have had a very good education and I now have quite a good
job and I feel an arranged marriage would take my independence away.
''I was also brought up as a Muslim and my parents' reasons for
wanting me to have an arranged marriage include religion. I can't
believe in most of the Islamic rules and don't live my life according to
them: an arranged marriage would put me back in that straitjacket.''
Mira knows that one day she must make a decision. ''I've put off
telling my parents because I love my family and can't bear the thought
of losing them. I'm trying to talk to them about it, but the subject is
so emotive and the issues so huge that it's impossible to even start.
''One day it will come down to making a choice between Charlie and my
family and I have no idea what I will do.''
FOR: CASE STUDY 2:
WHEN Shameem Afzal approached her early twenties, she felt it was time
to think about getting married. She is a practising Muslim of Pakistani
descent and had only ever considered an arranged marriage.
A family friend acted as intermediary, introducing her to Mohammed,
her husband of seven years. ''Although the marriage was arranged, I did
get a choice of partner. Mohammed came up with his parents to see me and
we got the chance to get to know each other.
''I had a lot of information about Mohammed before he came up, so I
knew all the background about him,'' says Shameem. ''When you meet the
person it's really just to see if you are attracted. What a girl looks
for in a boy is that he's hard-working, smart and of good background.
That's really what counts.''
This was not the first arranged marriage Shameem had been involved in.
Previously, her parents had arranged a marriage to someone from
Pakistan, ''but he didn't get a visa so that was the end of the story''.
Shameem concedes that the prospect of marrying a stranger from a
different country and culture was intimidating, but says: ''I just went
along with what my parents wanted. I saw a photograph of the person and
he seemed fine. In a way it was adventurous as well.''
This confidence in parental decisions is characteristic of Shameem's
attitude towards arranged marriages. She says: ''Your mum and dad try to
choose the best person for you. They want a good future for you, so we
trust in our parents to choose our partners.''
There was a two-month gap between Shameem and Mohammed's first meeting
and their marriage. ''We started getting in touch and tried getting to
know each other in those two months but we wouldn't have dreamt of going
out alone,'' says Shameem. ''That's not permitted; there were always
people around.''
After their wedding, Shameem and Mohammed were nervous of being left
alone together for the first time. ''It was scary. But you just have to
get on with it, and then the love grows.''
Shameem is confident that an arranged marriage was the correct
decision for her and would like her daughter, Samia, to marry this way
when the time comes. ''I wouldn't like her just to come home one night
and say she was getting married, but the most important thing is that
she's happy.''

IT IS never wise to presume anything about Partick Thistle, other than
that they are unpredictable, and that adjective now applies to their
chances of getting a game on at their own ground, as much as how they
will perform, writes Ian Paul. Dundee United have been trying patiently
to play them in a league game since December 10 but five postponements
later they are still waiting.
Motherwell have not been quite so harshly treated by the Firhill pitch
which has a distinct aversion to water, not the easiest of allergies to
cope with in Glasgow, and they plan to travel to Maryhill tonight for
the match postponed from February 11.
No inspection had been planned by the end of yesterday afternoon but
all will depend on the weather today. If there is a break in the clouds,
the contest between teams at opposite ends of the table will be keen,
and maybe better than that.
Motherwell believe they have come out of their shaky phase after two
wins in succession have taken them back into second place. Thistle may
be stranded in bottom spot but they will compete as ferociously as ever
until the premier division trap door is shut in their face.
No-one appreciates that more than the Fir Park manager, Alex McLeish,
who has a genuine respect for the inspirational powers of his rival at
Firhill, John Lambie.
''He is one of the shrewdest in the business,'' said McLeish. ''He is
an experienced campaigner, especially when it comes to fighting to get
out of trouble. There is no way anyone can take Partick Thistle for
granted.''
None the less, the incentive for Motherwell is the chance to open up a
five-point lead in the race for second place and a UEFA Cup spot. ''That
has to be a big attraction for us,'' said McLeish, whose players perhaps
put up their best show of the season when they went down by a single
goal in the first leg of their UEFA Cup tie with Borussia Dortmund back
in September.
The quality of that show can be gauged by the fact that Dortmund are
clear of the pack in the Bundesliga but what it did for McLeish and his
men was give them a taste of the good life which they rather enjoyed.
They will, therefore, go for the UEFA Cup place with a great deal of
enthusiasm.
Brian Martin will be available again after suspension but Tommy Coyne
and Shaun McSkimming are doubtful because of injury. Thistle wait on a
fitness test on goalkeeper Nicky Walker. He injured a calf playing for
Scotland B against Northern Ireland at Easter Road last Tuesday and
deputy Mark Cairns took over against Dundee United at Tannadice on
Saturday. Alan Dinnie is suspended after having been sent off in that
match.

RELEGATION-threatened GHK have been hit by a double injury blow in
their battle to stay in the top flight.
New Zealand back Steve Hirini yesterday underwent surgery to repair
his cheekbone, which was smashed during the relegation game against Gala
at the weekend, and full back George Breckenridge is nursing a suspected
wrist fracture following a collision in the same game.
Both are almost certain to be out for the rest of the season.
The Old Anniesland side had been strong tips for the title after
romping to victory in their first five matches, but the wheels came off
against bogey-team Currie in mid-October -- and they haven't won since.
However, coach Brian Gilbert insisted GHK can beat the drop. He said:
''All I want from my players is the same application and hunger for
success that they showed at the start of the campaign.
''I was a very unhappy man after Saturday's defeat by Gala -- not
because was lost, but because of how we lost. Both teams were in exactly
the same position and it was a classic four-pointer, but they wanted it
much more than we did.''
GHK must win their two remaining games against Stewart's-Melville and
County to have a chance of a Premier League place next season.

Lothian Schools 58,

LOTHIAN, having already defeated Midlands and Glasgow this season,
completed their Bank of Scotland schools under-18 programme with a big
win over North at Preston Lodge yesterday. Lothian ran in eight tries in
a one-sided match played in a strong wind.
Lothian's full back Danny Mallinson immediately harnessed the elements
with a couple of long range penalty goals in the opening spell, and from
then on it was a case of piling up the points.
Two tries by lock forward Eddie Emerson and a hat trick by centre
Hamish Allan -- four of these converted by Mallinson -- gave Lothians a
39-0 half-time lead.
Even with their entire bench brought on for the second half and with
the wind in their faces, Lothian added tries by flanker Neil Taylor and
winger Alistair Donaldson (2).
However, it was not all despair for North, whose under-16 side
defeated Lothians by 15-13.

THE Rugby Football Union claimed yesterday that they were the innocent
party in the row which has blown up over the venue for the 1999 Rugby
World Cup.
At the weekend the Scottish Rugby Union International Board
representative Freddie McLeod said that he had ''put a pistol to
England's head'' over RFU demands that, in return for their supporting a
Welsh bid to stage the 1999 tournament, the two semi-finals should be
staged at Twickenham.
Scotland and Ireland have now formed an alliance in an attempt to
undermine the English-Welsh bid with the IRFU supporting Scotland's
claim for one semi-final in addition to the offered pool games. In
return, Ireland are content to stage the third-place play-off and their
pool games at Lansdowne Road.
The International Board will make a final decision on the location of
the 1999 tournament at its annual meeting in a fortnight. The Australian
RFU has also lodged a bid with a plan to stage the tournament in
Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.
This year the tournament is to be staged in South Africa and,
logically, the venue for the 1999 event would have been expected to be
in the northern hemisphere. Unless the home unions can patch up their
differences then, when it comes to the IB vote, then the southern
hemisphere nations could win again, almost by default.
Yesterday RFU secretary Dudley Wood said: ''Freddie is obviously very
upset but I'm really not quite sure why. Let us be quite clear about
what we are talking about here. This is a Welsh bid and it really is all
down to them.''
Wood declined to confirm that the price of England's support for the
Welsh RFU was that Twickenham should host the two glamour semi-finals.
McLeod had said that England's demands had to be resisted and that
they continually sought more and more for themselves. Sooner or later,
he said, someone would have to take them on.
Wood declared: ''How dare he says this. This is just Freddie being
Freddie. I'm saddened by the situation that we appear to have got
ourselves into. I can see Scotland being upset if some accommodation had
been agreed, but if Wales had said that they had wanted to stage all of
the games in Wales, which they could quite easily have done, then that
would have been their entitlement.''
He added: ''I don't think that we could have behaved better than we
have done and I'm not sure if Scotland's quarrel is with us at all.
''Of course we would be disappointed if this all meant that the 1999
tournament went to Australia. We want to see the tournament staged
within these islands but I don't think that we have done anything wrong.
In fact I think that we have behaved rather well in withdrawing our bid
in deference to Wales.''
Yesterday, Welsh RU president Vernon Pugh QC was unavailable for
comment.
Meanwhile, a political row within President Nelson Mandela's
government of national unity is threatening one of this summer's World
Cup venues.
The Inkatha Freedom Party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi walked out of
parliament last week demanding international mediation in autonomy
discussions for KwaZulu-Natal province, whose biggest city, Durban, is
one of the main World Cup venues.
The region has long been a focus of rivalry between Inkatha and
Mandela's African National Congress.

JOHN Regis is set to miss the world indoor championships in Barcelona
next week after falling in the 200 metres at a meeting in Stockholm last
night.
Regis, favourite for the title, damaged a thigh muscle, which doctors
said could sideline him for more than three weeks.
The incident happened approaching the finish as he was battling for
the lead with Norway's Geir Moen, who won the race.
It was a cruel twist of fate for Regis, who had been disqualified in
his two previous races for running out of his lane.
Last summer, an Achilles tendon injury prevented him defending the
European title in Helsinki -- and Moen took advantage of his absence to
win the gold medal.
Linford Christie, beaten by Darren Braithwaite in Birmingham on
Saturday, suffered another 60m defeat.
Christie again lost by one-hundredth of a second, this time to
Canadian Donovan Bailey, who ran 6.57sec, with Braithwaite third on
6.65.
Bailey had finished fourth on Saturday in a race which gave
Braithwaite the best win of his career.
Tony Jarrett scored his second 60m hurdles victory in three days in
7.57, while Matthew Yates was second in the 1000m behind the exciting
young Burundi runner, Venuste Niyongabo.

Britain's athletes clear of some of the drug-taking controversies which
scarred the sport last year.
Gunnell has written to nearly 500 internationalists urging them to
ensure that over-the-counter products they take do not contain banned
substances.
Sprinter Solomon Wariso and javelin thrower Colin Mackenzie were both
banned for three months in 1994 after taking what they thought were
harmless products.
Gunnell, the British women's team captain, said: ''If you don't check

ALISTAIR Connell, of Cawder, will join the European Tour next week,
but there's no point in looking for his name among the leading scorers.
The only cuts you'll find him trying to make are to the grass to achieve
his ideal of firm, fast greens.
Connell, aged 46, has been appointed course manager at Collingtree
Park, near Northampton, which belongs to PGA European Golf Courses (IMG)
Ltd, the company owned jointly by the Tour and Mark McCormack's
International Management Group,
The course there, designed by American Johnny Miller, the 1976 Open
champion, has as its flagship event the Collingtree Park Seniors Open,
whose first winner was Neil Coles, now chairman of the whole Tour. It
also hosts various other pro events including pre-qualifying for the
Tour school, and otherwise caters for around 40,000 rounds a year, many
of them through company days and society outings.
Connell's work in preparation for three Challenge Tour events at
Cawder a few years ago led to his move on the recommendation of former
Tour player Andy Stubbs, who headed the Challenge Tour then and is now
managing director of the Seniors Tour.
After 13 years at Cawder, Connell's move is further evidence of the
career opportunities available in greenkeeping which have improved out
of all recognition since he set out as a 15-year-old under John Campbell
at his home town of St Andrews.
Working on the hallowed links at the home of golf has left its mark on
the one-time scratch left-hander who now plays off five and is a former
winner of that hard school, the Scottish Greenkeeper's championship.
''I think most people would agree that what we are trying to achieve
on inland courses is seaside environments,'' he said. ''Courses are
obviously going to drain much more efficiently through a sandy soil,
especially in the west where there is heavy rainfall.''
Over the two courses at Cawder and its extensive practice area, he
estimates that 2600 tons of sand have been spread during his term there,
and if this was made into one big pile its height would be greater than
that of the substantial clubhouse itself.
Of course, there's more to it than the ancient dictum of the father of
all grenkeepers Old Tom Morris of St Andrews: ''Mair saun and nae Sunday
play. The course needs a rest even if the gowfers don't.''
Connell, who also has worked at Redcar in England, Ralston, Moray and
Crow Wood, said: ''When I started out in the mid-60s golf tended to be
played between March and October. Now it is all year round.
''That means grass is put under different stress. So greenkeeping has
become more scientific and equipment has changed drastically. Nowadays
you will often find a 17-year-old in charge of a #25,000 machine.''
He has played his part in this evolution as a former president of the
Scottish region of the greenkeepers' association and a lecturer at the
Elmwood and Langside colleges. Now he himself is stepping up a gear.
PGA European Tour Golf Courses was set up just over two years ago with
the twin aims of operating courses which can be prepared specifically
for Tour events and to give visiting golfers the chance to play on top
courses.
The company also has interests at Stockley Park, near Heathrow
Airport, and courses in Sweden and Germany. A further course near
Barcelona is in the pipeline.
However, things have not gone to plan since Collingtree Park was
bought from receivers around the time the company was formed.
Michael Friend, company director, said: ''It was built to USGA
specifications with sand-based greens and penncross grass which has
suffered in the cool, damp weather of recent years, hence Alistair, who
is well used to such conditions, entering the scene.
''It is no secret that we approached him. The job was not
advertised.''
Connell's main task at Cawder has been to oversee the growing in of 10
new holes on the Cawder course -- the fourth to the eleventh plus the
sixteenth -- following redesign by architect Donald Steel, and he
regards the course as having risen in status within the Glasgow area to
a similar level as Haggs Castle having hosted two Scottish Women's
Professional opens as well as three Challenge Tour events.
Perhaps not co-incidentally, his colleague Chris Kennedy, who was
until a few years ago course manager at Haggs -- which formerly staged
the Glasgow Classic and Scottish Open -- also landed the plum job at
Wentworth.

THE Scottish Hockey Union, arguably one of the most progressive of
Scottish sports, yesterday took a significant step in raising its
profile while at the same time strengthening its foundation by
appointing Australian Brent Deans as its first Director of Hockey.
40-year-old Deans, a former miner from the Blue Mountains in New South
Wales, has been making a name for himself back home over the past four
years with his work with the Austrialian Institute of Sport and as
executive director with the Austrialian Capital Territory Hockey
Association in Canberra where he is respsonsible for organising hockey
for some 4,000 participants.
Deans had played, coached and administered hockey at state and
inter-state level and he is confident that ''the programmes I have
applied in Canberra will fit in well here and help lift Scotland on to
the world stage''.
Deans also sees indoor hockey a means to success and he will be
wanting to work closely with Gill Messenger of Team Sport to encourage
more primary schoolchildren to get involved.
The Australian also sees his remit as working in harmony with the
organisers of the various programmes already in place including the
elite athletic programme presently being run by former Scottish
international Dougie Potter.
Deans however will be helping to take it a stage further by
establishing regional centres as an avenue towards centralisation of a
hockey centre of excellence which maybe in the long term will bear a
strong resemblance to the Australian Institute of Sport.
With his experience of the Australian environment Deans should be a
tremendous asset to hockey in Scotland.
His appointment will undoubtedly have far reaching effects on hockey.
For a start he will have executive power for decision-making but the
fact that he will be working in harmony with the competitions comittee
and all other committees will be an added bonus. Deans is very much a
man of vision and with the board having the confidence to select him
ahead of the 40 other applicants from as far apart as Germany, Spain,
Canada, South Africa, Argentina, Australia as well as the UK, hockey
here is about to encounter a new beginning.

SCOTLAND must reach for an even higher grade performance as in Paris
if they are to take a further step against Wales on Saturday towards a
Grand Slam shootout with England. The Welsh are a stronger outfit than
their two championship defeats would suggest and they will ask different
questions of Scottish tactics.
0 The lineout is one area in which quick wits and anticipation will be
at a premium. Certainly, against England the Welsh barely called one
orthodox full-length line in contrast to the French, who barely
shortened a line against Scotland in Paris. Wales clearly reasoned that
they will be badly outgunned by England's impressive legions in full
length lines, so they cut frequently to just their two big men, Derwyn
Jones and Gareth Llewellyn, except at close-range defensive situations.
The aim was to afford space for manoeuvre to those two big lads with the
split-second advantage of knowing exactly whether the throw would be
short, long, fast, lobbed or held back.
Those shortened lines disguised Welsh vulnerability in the absence of
a genuine lineout specialist with the requisite physical dimension among
their loose forwards who seem to have been chosen with tackle and wide
support as priorities. Whether Wales will feel the need to thus
virtually eliminate their seven-man line at Murrayfield remains to be
seen, but it certainly sets a different examination in that ball
accurately deflected is of prime quality. There is the option of a catch
and burst through thinly guarded areas and the withdrawn opposition
forwards have to be carefully monitored as to their role and intent.
Scotland will be hoping for good conditions so as to utilise their
bigger men at the tail whilst seeking to curb the effectiveness of
Jones, a 6ft 10ins police officer who, if not exactly a Martin Bayfield,
stillhas gone some way towards giving Wales a lineout dimension sadly
lacking since the days of their current team manager, Robert Norster.
Controlled lineout ball can prove a fertile launch platform and it
will not have been lost on Scotland's coaches Douglas Morgan and Richie
Dixon that this Welsh side seems keen to hold to the traditional Welsh
style of shifting the ball by hand whenever they feel that is on.
Perhaps they might be more successful with a stand-off more from a
typical twinkling Welsh mould than Neil Jenkins, but Scotland must be
prepared for ball being run at them from set and broken play with wings
actively seeking participation and with a 14st full back, Matthew Back,
liable to erupt out of the deep and in line augmentation as he does with
such frequency for his club Bridgend. Perhaps it was as well for England
that eventually they proved more productive in lineout play and also won
the subsequent phases in a ratio of 38-12.
With more ball than that those sharp Welsh backs, who boast an
impressive 207 caps, could prove hard to pin down especially their key
playmaker, Nigel Davies, at inside centre, who, it will be recalled, set
up the Ieuan Evans try against Scotland last season with a perfect
diagonal and who is one of three Llanlelli players in the threequarter
line.
The Scots also will want to react quicker to emergency stations in
their narrow side defence. Three of the tries they have conceded this
season have carried an element of open sesame about the blind-side
patrol. There was that embarrassing first try by the South African scrum
half, Joost van der Westhuizen when he was afforded the freedom of the
east stand route in scoring a try quite incredible in its simplicity.
On that occasion all of Scotland except Doddie Weir wrongly
anticipated an open-side threat so that the blind was virtually
uninhabited prairie, and van der Westhuizen is fractionally quicker into
his running than the willing Weir. Later, there was that Rudolf Straeuli
try when the oceans parted down the west wing. That French try by
Jean-Luc Sadourny carried an open invitation to investigate the narrower
lane.
When the French scrum half probed off rucked ball there was a distinct
initial shortage of navy jerseys and the French had a four-to-one on
offer. Of course, French creation was almost copybook and underlined
also the value of a charging forward taking out opposing backs. Flanker
Laurent Cabannes burst on to loose ball at the lineout tail and, in
making a deep inroad, he put Bryan Redpath off balance and sucked Craig
Chalmers into the tackle.
So Scotland immediately were short of two key markers and the speed of
ruck delivery did give the French an ideal secondary launch. So thinking
on the feet and interchanging roles might be necessary if the narrow
channels are to be securely policed, especially as there aren't many
scrum halves with more acutely developed perception of what might be
available than Robert Jones, who could represent the key threat to
Scottish ambition.
There are those who reckon it should be a Scottish dawdle. Wales,
after all, have had to play their third choice full back, their second
choice left wing, their second choice props, one a debutant and just 21.
They have lost the last four matches at Murrayfield, they have
registered only two tries in their last seven internationals. But as
with Scotland in Paris the Welsh have nothing to lose, they will be
prepared to die, or near enough, for Wales and they are, after all, the
reigning champions, proud and resilient.
And, of course, they have that productive boot of Neil Jenkins. In 31
internationals he has amassed 338 points, averaging 10.9 per game. This
places him just behind Grant Fox (14), Michael Lynagh (12.2) and Naas
Botha (11.1) in world rankings -- a menace to Scottish aspiration.

SCOTS super-middleweight Stephen Wilson moves a step closer his
British title dream when he fights a final eliminator next month. He
will square-up to England's Glenn Campbell in Glasgow on March 20 -- 10
days before his twenty-fourth birthday.
Wilson, from Wallyford, West Lothian, has been sidelined by injury
since claiming his tenth victory in 11 pro fights in Glasgow in October.
Five-year pro Campbell, 24, scored a points decision over
Blackpool-based light-heavyweight Simon McDougall in his home town of
Bury last week and boasts a 14-wins-in-16-fights record with one drawn.
His only defeat came in a WBO Penta-Continental scrap with Argentinian
Juan Scaglia.
Wilson's Glasgow manager Tommy Gilmour said: ''Stephen will rise to
the occasion despite him being out of the ring since October.
''He has been really unlucky with cuts in training and that's why we
pulled him out of a recent contest in Glasgow -- not because of any
other problem.
''Stephen has been working hard in the gym and is in great shape. I'm
confident he can get over this hurdle and take the British title.''
The winner would square-up to London-born powerhouse Ali Forbes, and
Gilmour said: ''I believe Campbell is a better fighter than Forbes, and
if Stephen comes through this test he can go all the way.''

GLASGOW has been confirmed as one of the new venues for the expanding
Converse NBA three-on-three tour which will stage events in 28 European
cities this year.
In its first two years more than 70,000 participants have been
attracted to these outdoor events all over Europe and this year the
target for the tour, which opens in Athens on April 1 and 2, is for
another 50,000.
But the designated dates of October 7 and 8 for the only Scottish
venue for this mass participation festival may raise a few eyebrows.
Even in mid-summer there is a high risk of rain disrupting the
proceedings but being so late in the year it is also likely to be cold.
The only later dates are those for Valencia and Tenerife in Spain.
The tour organisers, whose local co-ordinator is the former MIM and
England player Alton Byrd, have proposed closing the Kelvin Way for the
event in which players of all ages and abilities play half-court games.
The target will be to top the 300 teams which took part in the Adidas
three-on-three event at Glasgow Green last July.
The biggest number at any one venue on the Converse NBA Tour last year
was in Madrid where 1506 teams took part in a city-centre spectacular.
Other first time venues this year are Copenhagen, Manchester and
Munich, while London, one of the successes last time, will again feature
-- on June 3 and 4.
There is no doubt that the NBA, the governing body of the professional
sport in the USA which is already giving the game in Britain a huge
boost by bringing the McDonalds Open to the London Arena from October 19
to 21, is throwing its weight behind the development as part of a
world-wide marketing strategy.
''The NBA continues to expand its efforts to develop the sport of
basketball through local particpation programmes such as the Converse
NBA Tour,'' said NBA Commissioner David Stern on a visit to Geneva.

Each of the five contributions
printed below wins a #10 book
token -- with the compliments
of booksellers John Smith
&amp; Son, St Vincent Street, Glasgow
It's about greed
* IN the week of the #18m lottery jackpot I had to fight my way
through a queue of people which stretched the length of a shop. Nobody
would let me past, fearing I was trying to steal their place. Why? The
reason was greed.
Is the National Lottery good? Yes and no. It can help people in
financial trouble if they win and it also helps charities. But the
Government gets a huge amount of money and the lottery now seems to be a
voluntary tax.
The issue recently has been the Church of England's complaints
regarding the element of greed and gambling involved in the lottery.
These complaints, however, could be open to the charge of hypocrisy as
the Church has not refused any of the money donated to it by the
Lottery.
Some people believe the prizes are too great. The jackpot should be
#1m or #2m, but not #18m! Surely this money would be better spent if it
were given to charity. Most or all of the money which the Government
receives should be given to the arts or charities.
A potential problem could be the effect the lottery has on the
unemployed or those on a pension. A few pounds a week that they could
have saved is now spent on a few tickets in the vain hope that they will
win millions.
The chances of winning are very small, 57 to one that you could win
#10. So, in theory you could spend #57 and win only #10. The chances of
winning the jackpot are 14,000,000 to one!
The National Lottery could have been a good thing which helped
struggling charities, but in truth only large charities are helped. So
now money which would have been put into these small charities is given
to the lottery by people who think they are helping.
My view is that the National Lottery could have been a good thing
which didn't work out. I think it should be changed so that more money
is given to charities and less to the Government and the organisers,
Camelot.
-- Neil Davidson Kelly, third year, Glasgow Academy.
Just a bit of fun
* MY family was one of the unfortunate ones to be flooded during last
month's floods. As a result, we had to move out and stay at my cousin's.
On the way there, we stopped to buy a lottery ticket. Why? Because our
luck couldn't get much worse. Because it was just a bit of fun, and, no
matter how small, there was the chance we might win something. Maybe it
would pay for the damage to our house.
This is what the National Lottery is all about: people taking the
chance, even if it is 14,000,000 to one! We buy tickets for a laugh,
just to see how many numbers we can get. And while we're doing this,
we're giving millions to charities, and helping the aged, the disabled,
and the terminally ill, as well as others.
Even though, as far as I'm concerned, the lottery is an excellent
idea, there is one small drawback: the obscene amounts of money that can
be won. Okay, this is probably the main attraction, but #17.8m is a bit
excessive. It would be better if the jackpot were limited to #5m or #6m.
It would certainly be enough for me!
There are also some people who say it's all just a ploy by the
Government to weasel lots of money out of us, and the rest of us are
being naive to think otherwise. This is just cynicism. True, the
Government is getting some money, but the largest percentages by far are
going to the prize pool and charitable organisations.
The pessimists should just accept that the lottery is entirely
voluntary -- no one is being forced to buy a ticket. You are perfectly
entitled not to buy one; but if you don't, just think what you could be
missing . . .
-- Lesley Bloomer, third year, Glasgow Academy.
Hope for the jobless
* I AM writing in response to the letter in the last issue about the
National Lottery. Playing the lottery does not suggest you are greedy.
There are so many unemployed people today, especially in Scotland, that
it brings a little bit of hope in life.
The lottery gives people a chance of some extra money. Even just #10
can make a difference. The anxiety of waiting to know whether you have
won or not can also be enjoyable, so I don't think it is that bad.
-- Heather Sinclair, second year, Chryston High.
Don't kick Eric
* I AM writing on behalf of myself and lots of people in my school and
all over Britain about Eric Cantona. I think it's terrible that he has
to be banned.
The Crystal Palace fan surely knew what was coming and, after all,
everyone knows what Cantona is like. He has a very short temper, but I
think it was mostly the fan's fault.
I know that a lot of people say that if you get paid that amount of
money you should be able to take taunts, but personally I think that no
matter what amount of money you get paid you still get hurt and have
feelings.
I know I wouldn't take taunts and I don't see why Cantona has to be
different.
-- Catriona Marshall, first year, Chryston High, Glasgow.

LAURIE Boschman jets into Britain this week to make his debut for Fife
Flyers -- and bring an end of the Kirkcaldy club's two-month nightmare.
The former National Hockey league centre will become the most
experienced player from the world's top league ever to play in this
country when he plays against league pace-setters Nottingham Panthers at
Kirkcaldy on Saturday.
Rink manager John Brady last night confirmed receipt of Boschman's
long-awaited work permit from the Department of Employment, and he said:
''We're trying to get Laurie on the first available flight and he'll ice
on Saturday jet-lagged or not.''
Boschman, 34, has made 1009 appearances for top NHL sides, and has
been training hard since signing for Flyers before the January 31
deadline.
He teams up with his former Winnipeg and Ottawa colleague Doug Smail,
38, who helped fix up Boschman after Flyers' American hit-man Tony Szabo
walked out.
Meanwhile, work will start in May on a #100,000 roof repair at
Kirkcaldy -- the first since the rink was built in 1938.

This hideous creature
Has three main features
It devours books you said you took
But the teacher says you lost.
The next main feature of this creature
Is that it clings to your back
Disguised as a sack
And sends brainwaves to your head
That make you reluctant to get out of bed!
So there are three features
Of this creature we call a bag
But its real name is a drag!

SCOTTISH Pride chairman Lord Sanderson yesterday confirmed that there
were no plans to close any of the company's creamery operations, but all
are to be run and operated much more efficiently.
Speaking to milk producers in Rothesay following the announcement that
two island creameries on Bute and Arran and a third in Campbeltown were
to shut for one month starting on Wednesday, Lord Sanderson said that
the measures were necessary because of a glut of cheddar cheese
currently on the market.
This, he said, followed Scottish Pride's loss of the Galloway brand, a
matter which is subject of on-going court action. He said: ''We are in
the cheese manufacturing business and I am not in the business of
closing down any of our plants.''
Scottish Pride chief executive Jim Hosea, who accompanied Lord
Sanderson to Bute, also met with the 18 staff at Rothesay Creamery to
discuss the closure. He said: ''There will be no job losses at any of
our creameries. However, we shall be making changes in production
techniques in order to improve efficiency.
Scottish Pride sells the bulk of its cheddar cheese production to
supermarkets throughout the UK.
Alastair McFarlane, president of the Bute Branch of the National
Farmers' Union, said farmers were encouraged by what Lord Sanderson had
to say: ''The rumours have all disappeared and we have been reassured by
Scottish Pride's plans for the future.
Scottish Pride executives plan to meet with creamery staff in
Campbeltown and on Arran later.

IN the great scheme of things the outcome of the inaugural Alfred
Dunhill Challenge was irrelevant other than to the contestants and the
five countries they represented. The main significance is that it took
place at all at Johannesburg's Houghton Club.
In years to come the match between Southern Africa and Australasia
might well be looked back upon and regarded as a genuine watershed. The
golfing nations south of the equator have regularly produced magnificent
champions such as Bobby Locke, Kel Nagle, Peter Thomson, Gary Player and
in the modern era Greg Norman, Nick Price, Wayne Grady and young Ernie
Els who might prove to be the greatest of them all.
However, the main professional golf circuits have been in the northern
hemisphere. America ruled for many years and since the early 1980s
European strength has increased with Seve Ballesteros, Sandy Lyle, Nick
Faldo, Jose Maria Olazabal, and Bernhard Langer all winning majors. The
tours in the States and Europe are not only well established but highly
lucrative for the best players.
In order to grab their slice of the riches available on either side of
the North Atlantic, golfers from the southern hemisphere have been
forced to travel vast distances.
Last week's Alfred Dunhill Challenge underlined the strength in depth
of golf in the Antipodes, not forgetting Fiji and Vijay Singh, and
Africa. The best are among the most skilful exponents of the Royal and
Ancient game in the world.
So surely the world tour mooted by Greg Norman cannot be far away.
Sunday's singles matches between Norman and Open champion Price, and
between US Open champion Els and Singh would have been star attractions
anywhere round the globe.
Despite one Southern African player claiming he felt the need of new
underpants on at least eight occasions and Norman insisting he had never
been so nervous in his life, all 18 players relished their first taste
of Ryder Cup-style golf. Without exception all 18 would welcome a world
tour and the prospect of the best players in the world meeting each
other on a much more regular basis.
Greg Norman was reviled for putting his name to a suggested new
circuit but surely it can only be a matter of time. The Alfred Dunhill
Challenge might well prove to have been the catalyst for a wind of
change to blow through golf.
A World Tour of Golf will come much sooner with or without the
involvement of Greg Norman.

SEA temperatures off the west coast of South America are a factor not
normally connected with sheep farming but, according to a leading
Scottish expert, El Nino -- the major current in the Pacific -- has
brought a succession of wet and difficult lambing seasons to Scottish
farmers which should perhaps make them think of looking at their normal
dates for lambing.
Dr John Vipond, the senior sheep expert with SAC, has been looking at
the optimum lambing dates over the past few years and has conducted
several trials in South-west Scotland.
The perceived thinking among many sheep farmers that putting rams out
later, beyond the conventional late autumn dates, results in reduced
conception has not been borne out by the initial SAC trials. These point
to much lower feeding costs during the winter months, an acceptable
lambing percentage and a much easier time for farmers and shepherds.
Even the fear of many traditional sheep farmers that ewes lambing this
late will be too fat has not been proved. Essentially lambing at a later
date presents opportunities for more organised marketing and better use
of grassland.
Commenting on the more general prospects for the forthcoming lambing
season, Dr Vipond said: ''I think in the west ewes will be leaner on
account of the rain. There is also another potential problem in that the
hills have been greener this winter and sheep have tended to graze on
grass in preference to heather. This could well result in a greater
incidence of swayback.''
This is a chronic condition which causes major dysfunction of the
spinal column of the young lamb and is closely related to a reduced
intake of copper. Traditionally farmers on land where this disease is
prevalent would inject their ewe flocks with an appropriate supplement,
but speaking of those farmers new to the situation, Dr Vipond commented:
''It's now getting almost too late for that.''
The senior veterinary investigation officer for SAC, George Caldow,
took a similar view: ''Most of the sheep we have seen so far -- and in
my own situation that has largely been from the eastern side -- are in
decent order. We have seen virtually no cases of pregnancy toxaemia
(twin lamb disease).''
Mr Caldow advises farmers to approach the next few vital weeks with
precision: ''Fine tuning of feeding is essential, based on the feeds
available on the farm, and that should be done on the condition score of
the sheep.
''I would also suggest that anyone in doubt about his flock should
speak to his local vet and get him to blood test them for energy levels.
This is an extremely accurate test and can be a vital tool.''

FARMERS' unions on both sides of the Border have linked forces with
the British Pig Association to seek a fair deal for this sector in the
face of unilateral welfare legislation that could force many of them out
of business.
They say this legislation, ending the use of sow stalls and tethers by
the end of 1998 -- seven years ahead of any near-equivalent legislation
in the rest of Europe -- will result in the loss of one in every eight
breeding sows, cost thousands of jobs throughout the industry and add
over #230m to Britain's balance of payments deficit.
Given the support of the retail sector, they say they can partly
offset this by being more market responsive. But they also need state
aid to help the industry reinvest in new plant and meet higher
production costs estimated at #74m a year -- or #2.70p per pig produced
-- in perpetuity.
Industry leaders point out the Government has already accepted the
principle of aid through agreement to EU grants of up to #7500 per unit
to pig farmers in Northern Ireland to help them convert. But mainland
farmers would be content with taxation changes, such as profits
averaging and 100% capital allowances on rehousing costs.
''We have suffered sustained losses over recent years so there is not
the capacity to invest at this point,'' said Grenville Welsh, chief
executive of the British Pig Association, at a London news briefing.
''And the other issue, twinned with this, is the way confidence has
been eroded. No-one wants to invest because they see the future quite
dimly.
''Given these two shackles on us, there really needs to be quite an
input into the industry to prevent it from declining,'' he added.
Both Dafydd Owen, the English NFU's pigs committee specialist, and
David Whiteford, the Scottish NFU's pigs committee convener, say that if
the Government has accepted the principle of assistance for welfare
conversions in Northern Ireland there is no reason why this cannot be
extended.
Mr Whiteford commented: ''Scottish pig producers also suffer cost
disadvantages which come from remoteness from markets.''
Mr Owen said: ''This welfare legislation was brought in as a result of
widespread political pressure so we are now trying to match that
pressure from the pig industry. We will be making the point that welfare
is not a straight black and white issue.''
Pig farmers are being urged to apply pressure on MPs and other opinion
formers. But the industry is also intent on showing that it is not just
''whingeing'' and -- with the backing of the Meat and Livestock
Commission -- is attempting to reduce costs, improve efficiency, develop
new products and new markets.

YOU might say that Sterling Marlin is anything but a winner. In fact,
so far in his auto racing career Marlin has notched up 309 losses. None
the less, he has won when it counts, most noticeably in the last two
Daytona 500s, the Blue Ribbon event of the North American Stock Car
Racing Circuit.
Watched by his father, Coo Coo who had also been a car racer, Marlin
claimed his victory and a prize purse of $300,460.
''I never made half that much in my whole life,'' Coo Coo exclaimed.
''I didn't believe it last year (following his son's first Daytona win).
Now I believe it.''
Marlin's racing successes threaten to make Daytona the most popular
spectator sport in his home town of Columbia, Tennessee where, at the
moment, the calendar's biggest event is something called Mule Day.
Farmers and politicians flood into town to show and trade their mules
and compete for Blue Ribbons.
''It's so busy in town, I don't leave the farm,'' explained Coo Coo.
The younger Marlin evidently had no choice. ''I told him he'd better
learn to race,'' said the father, ''because he's not good enough to be a
farmer. The farm wasn't big enough for him and me.''
* EVEN the prestigious Daytona 500 appears to have been victim of
tough economic times.
Tyres at this year's race were in such short supply that drivers who
had been eliminated in qualifying were asked to turn their tyres back in
for use by other drivers. One of them, Dave Marcis, refused.
''They're my tyres,'' he said. ''I'll give them to whom I choose.''
He chose Dale Earnhardt. The owner of Earnhardt's car, Richard
Childress, had given Marcis an engine for use in the car in which he was
eliminated. One assumes the tyres Marcis gave Earnhardt were bald.
* IF you really want to attend the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta in
style, now is your opportunity.
For just $50,000 you can be part of the Olympic Patron programme which
offers prime seats at most of the game's glamour events.
The Patron programme will be sold via a mailing to 150,000 big
businesses which, for their money, will receive 64 event tickets,
parking passes, access to housing in private homes and official ''Patron
credentials'' which, according to a games spokesperson, do little more
than ''let everybody know you are a patron''.
If that programme doesn't appeal to you, you could hand over $10,500
to rent a six-seat luxury suite at the soccer venue, or $1.32m for a
more lavish 54-seat facility in the main stadium.
Of course, you could just bring a packed lunch and buy an ordinary
games ticket which will set you back in the region of $40.
* FOR more than 30 years, the City of Memphis, Tennessee, courted the
National Football League in the hope of getting its own American
football team.
Finally, the city gave up, switched its allegiance to the Canadian
Football League and has now brought the Memphis Mad Dogs into being.
American teams have long been accepted in the Canadian Leagues, and vice
versa.
Although everybody in town is happy that pro-football has finally
arrived, some feel that the Memphis Hound Dogs would have been a more
appropriate name, honouring the city's most famous resident, Elvis
Presley. Pepper Rodgers, managing general partner of the team, offered
explanation.
Referring to the constant rejection by the NFL, he said: ''You
shouldn't have made our Hound Dogs mad.''

Paris, Monday -- European Union Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said
today he hoped a farm ministers' meeting next month would settle a
public row over the treatment and transport of live cattle and sheep.
And he warned Europe's farmers it was in their collective interest to
come to a solution at the March 27-28 meeting because public controversy
over the live animal trade was showing in lower beef consumption.
''A decision is needed at the next Farm Council. If it is postponed
once again, it will not be a good solution,'' Fischler told a news
conference at the SIMA agribusiness show.
EU farm ministers' meeting on February 20-21 failed to bridge
differences between northern and southern states over the maximum
journey times for animals transported to slaughter.
Fischler said the European Commission backed a proposal by France,
which holds the EU chair, for flexible journey times according to the
type and age of each animal.
''We need to find a solution rather quickly. Beef consumption is
dropping partly because of the controversy,'' he said.
At another farm show in Paris yesterday, former screen star and animal
rights crusader Brigitte Bardot urged France to impose a unilateral
journey limit of eight hours and branded its farm minister a ''coward''
for failing to do more on the issue. -- Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Shares suspended as talks with bankers continue Pentos is on the brink</HEADLINE>

SHARES in Pentos, the troubled specialist retailer which owns Dillons
bookshops and Rymans stationers, were ''temporarily'' suspended at
4[1/2]p yesterday, down 3[1/2]p from Friday.
The company is continuing talks with its bankers and other parties,
including possible rescuers, about refinancing and the injection of
fresh capital. The suspension follows considerable weekend speculation
that the banks -- Barclays and Midland -- were poised to call in the
receivers.
Just after Christmas, Pentos itself had called in the receivers to its
Athena poster and greeting cards chain -- the majority of whose
franchises were later sold to a consortium of the franchise operators --
in an effort to stem debts and protect its other activities.
However, the company has gone deeper into the mire and the banks are
believed to indicated that they were not prepared to raise the loan
facilities. These are due to expire today.
However, yesterday's statement would appear to indicate that something
could still be cobbled together. Aside from the Barclay and Midland
banks, the company is believed to be in talks with two venture capital
firms, Schroder Ventures and Electra Investment Trust, about rolling
over #50m of debts and securing #20m of new cash.
Pentos, which made losses of #36m in the first half of 1994-95, has
been trying to sell its Pentos Office Furniture and its Rymans
stationery chain. But this seems to have had little appeal. More
interest has been shown in the flagship Dillons bookshop chain and there
has been speculation that Mr Terry Maher, the former chairman of the
group, would be interested in Dillons.
Its sale, though, would effectively mean the end of Pentos with
approaching 80% of turnover derived from this bookshop source.
Mr Bill McGrath, the company's chief executive, has been struggling
for some while to get a new deal with the banks and at one time appeared
confident that the talks would be successful. However, the banks would
appear to have become more recalcitrant, hence the suspension.
The group chairman (non-executive) is Sir Kit McMahon, no stranger to
banking procedures and attitudes as former head of the Midland Bank and
a former deputy governor of the Bank of England. But this has apparently
not stopped the banks from taking a harder line than Pentos had
expected.
Pentos said that a further announcement would be made as soon as
practicable later this week. Meanwhile, it looks to be just about as
near the brink as possible without actually being over it.

TWO of golf's better-known oldies added to their celebrity at the
weekend.
The 72-year-old actor, Christopher Lee, chose for his Desert Island
Disc programme luxury item a set of clubs to play on the course he would
design to while away the days before rescue, and the Prestwick club's
professional, Frank Rennie, qualified by the skin of his teeth for the
PGA European Seniors Tour.
Only eight cards were available to the contestants who squared up to
the challenge at La Manga and Rennie gained the last of them, but only
after a play-off. At the first extra hole an Irishman, Bobby Browne,
obliged by taking three putts for a bogey 5 so that Rennie's par proved
enough for his survival.
''I was getting a bit excited near the end,'' confessed Rennie, who is
58 and has been attached for 33 years to the Ayrshire club, which in
1987 recognised his services to it by making him an honorary member.
''But I was optimistic of winning a place because I'd been playing quite
well in Ayrshire alliances.''
Rennie, who won the Northern Open in 1971, plans to play in nine or 10
tournaments this season -- ''all I need, really,'' he added. ''After
all, I've got a job of work to do here. But I'm glad to say that the
members are pleased I made it.''
Now Rennie will be able to enjoy a renewed competitive life, the bonus
of a sport whose players' shelf-life is made to last longer than most.
Tournament opportunities will not be difficult to find. The 1995
programme will consist of a minimum of 12 events, worth prize-money in
excess of #1.1m, compared with 1994's final schedule of 12 tournaments
which carried a total of #951,000.
And yesterday, Andy Stubbs, the seniors tour's managing director, was
bullish over both the short and long-term prospects.
''Discussions are on-going with a number of sponsors and venues for
additional events to be played this year,'' he said. ''News of these
will be announced in due course and we are optimistic of achieving our
goal of 24 tournaments by 1997.''
As on the equivalent US Tour the regular transfusion of familiar names
from the past into the bloodstream will sustain interest.
Stubbs added: ''Last year Tony Jacklin, Antonio Garrido, Graham Marsh,
David Huish, and Michael Ingham, among others, became eligible and this
season such as Brian Barnes, Maurice Bembridge, John Bland, and Clive
Clark will be able to join. Peter Townsend, Hugh Baiocchi, and Vicente
Fernandez will be later recruits.''
This season's centrepiece will be the British Open championship in
July at Royal Portrush, and the schedule will include four new
tournaments, two of which will be held in Britain.
They are the De Vere Hotels Seniors Classic at Belton Woods, Grantham,
and the London Masters on the International course at the London Golf
Club, Kent. The scope of the tour, rather like that of its regular
counterpart, knows no boundaries.
The programme will begin in Kenya with the Windsor Seniors Masters, to
be played from March 30 to April 1 at the Windsor Golf and Country Club,
Nairobi, and the other of the new events will be the International
German Masters Championship at Bad Griesbach.

NORTH Sea output hit an all-time high last month, in the face of
storms which severely hampered oil production.
The colder winter weather saw gas production rise 25% from December,
more than offsetting the drop in oil output.
Combined oil and gas production was up 6% to the equivalent of nearly
4.5 million barrels of oil per day. The Royal Bank of Scotland Oil and
Gas Index, which measures overall output, rose to a record high of
199.4, from 187.6 in December and 180.9 a year earlier.
With a 4% increase in the dollar price of Brent crude cushioning the
fall in oil output, gas and oil revenues were up 10% at #47.8m per day,
the highest level since 1985.
Average daily gas revenues rose to an estimated #20m per day, a record
high. Daily output was up more than 2000 million cubic feet per day, to
10,611 mmcfd, and the gas index rose to 312.2. Seasonally-adjusted gas
output was up nearly 2%.
With severe weather taking its toll at the beginning of the month, oil
output fell by more than 100,000 bpd to average slightly more than 2.6
million bpd. The oil index fell to 158.4.
Shell's Brent Alpha was shut down at the start of the year because of
storm damage to Brent Bravo, already closed as part of a redevelopment
programme. Brent's output was consequently down 15% or 31,000 bpd.
At Enterprise's Nelson, production fell 11% or 18,000 bpd. A power
failure at Shell's Kittiwake led to a controlled shutdown and an output
drop of 57% or 17,000 bpd. Output fell 10% or 16,000 bpd at BP's Magnus
field.
The most significant rise in gas output came from BP's Bruce field,
which upped production by 708 mmcfd.

WHILE the number of elderly people in the UK population is increasing
rapidly, providing a ready customer base for private nursing homes, what
is often not widely taken on board is the increasing level of dependancy
of those taken into care.
In 1979, the Government spent just #10m funding long-term care beds
but by 1992 this had risen to #2500m.
This is largely due to the closure of long-stay mental homes and
geriatric wards in NHS hospitals. This has resulted in the average
length of stay dropping by six months to less than 18 months but greater
staff numbers are required in homes if a sufficiently high quality of
care is to be provided.
This need for specialist medical services is what Crestacare,
Britain's third-largest private provider of long-term healthcare hopes
to tap into. In 1992, just 4.5% of its patients required specialist
medical care, by the end of last year this had risen to 18%.
Examples of the types of service on offer include specialist treatment
for alcohol-related dementia in one of its Glasgow homes. It also has a
brain injury rehabilitation unit in Glasgow which costs about #1000 per
patient per week which is much less than it would cost to keep such
patients in a traditional NHS hospital.
Increasingly, in its homes it offers specially-designed indoor
circular racetracks for dementia patients to get rid of their excess
energy.
Crestacare is hoping to extract more money from local authorities in
recognition of its greater medical skills but this is likely to be an
uphill task given the budget contraints which local authorities operate
under.
Currently it operates 3000 beds in 48 homes, 95% of which are purpose
built. Its homes are concentrated in Scotland, Ireland and northern
England. Its most recent openings included a 90-bed home at
Kirkintilloch.
Its move into Scotland came with the acquisition last July of
ScotCare, Scotland's largest private nursing home group, for #12.5m.
This helped the group to increase its annual profits substantially from
just #300,000 to #6m.
Its occupancy rate stayed at around 93% with just 15.4% privately
funded, a figure which Crestacare hopes to increase by moving into more
prosperous areas such as Central Edinburgh and South-west England.
However, CrestaCare is not abandoning its existing markets believing
there are attractive further growth opportunities in the Scottish
long-term healthcare market.
Crestacare -- one of many companies whose financial adviser is Barings
-- saw its shares dip a penny to 33p.

<TEXT>
Tokyo, Monday -- The stock market, battered by the collapse of
Barings, ended at a 15-month low and some brokers warned of worse to
follow.
The 225-share Nikkei average tumbled 664.24 points (3.80%) to
16,808.70, its lowest level since December 8, 1993, when it closed at
16,507.95.
The Nikkei fell as low as 16,518.46 -- almost 5% -- mainly on selling
by dealers and individual investors amid an absence of buyers.
Institutional and foreign investors stayed away from the market.
Traders said a late-afternoon rebound in Simex futures fuelled a
marginal recovery in Osaka-traded futures, triggering index-linked
buying in the cash market. They said that overall falls were exacerbated
by the thin market turnover, estimated at just 300 million shares.
''It could take two to three days for the dust to settle. Clients are
staying back, taking orders off. The concern is that Barings' positions
have got to be unwound and this will put short-term pressure on the
market,'' said Tim Shanagher, head of sales at Schroders.
Shuji Yasuma, general manager at Kankaku Securities, said uncertainty
over what will happen with Barings' huge open position discouraged
active trade. ''It's very difficult to take a position, because nobody
knows the extent of the losses,'' he said.
The Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) struggled to calculate how much
money Barings may have lost on long positions in Osaka Nikkei 225
futures.
Nobuo Araki, director of the OSE's futures and options department
which is investigating Barings' collapse, said that the bank stands to
lose 16 billion yen (#103m) on its outstanding Osaka Nikkei 225 futures
positions for every 1000-point slip in the Nikkei average.
Barings already owed the OSE 10 billion yen (#66m) to cover losses
incurred on long positions on Friday, Araki added.
He said there was enough money in Barings' trading account with the
OSE to cover that loss. ''What's unclear, however, is how much money
Barings will lose on its long positions in Osaka Nikkei 225 futures,''
Araki said.
''The size of the loss depends on how much the contracts can be sold
for,'' he said, adding that Barings had long positions in about 16,000
Osaka Nikkei 225 futures.
Japan's Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura said the turmoil was not a
sign of mistrust in Japan's own economy. ''I don't think it will hamper
public trust in Japan's economy since it took place in Singapore,'' said
Takemura.
The news of Barings' loss knocked sterling to an all-time low of
DM2.3010 in afternoon Tokyo trade. ''Sterling was double-punched because
the falls to new lows were triggered by news on Barings, but sterling
was already sold heavily last week on concerns over the Major cabinet,''
said a currency dealer at a European bank.
Cash and futures US Treasuries were also sensitive to the Barings
news. The 7[5/8]% key 30-year bond rose to a high of 101[5/8] but then
fell back to 101[1/4] on dealer profit-taking.
''Dealers' heavy purchases of the March contract were triggered by the
Barings news, but they are also quite willing to take profits, resulting
in the high volatility,'' said one US broker.
* Singapore -- Shares calmed down in afternoon trade, with the Straits
Times Industrial Index ending 20.42 points (0.97%) lower at 2094.10.
The index had plunged as much as 4.4% in the morning, reeling from the
Barings shock. Brokers said they would be watching the reaction of the
US and UK markets.
* Hong Kong -- Stocks finished 1.12% lower but light bargain-hunting
helped the blue-chip Hang Seng index recover from a 210-point loss
shortly after the opening.
The Hang Seng gave up 92.30 points to 8126.65.
''Everybody was surprised by the news and people will continue to
monitor Barings' developments in the next few days,'' said Samuel Lau at
Seapower Securities.
* Sydney -- The Australian stock market finished weaker on light
volume following news of the Barings collapse.
The All-Ordinaries index slipped 17.9 points to 1893.2.
The share price index futures March contract fell 24 points to close
at a 17.8-point premium over the physical market.
Dealers attributed most of the negative sentiment to market concerns
that other major institutions may also be unaware of exposures they have
in derivative markets.
* Frankfurt -- As other bourses reeled from the collapse of Barings,
firm German bond prices helped domestic shares pare losses.
The 30-share DAX index closed 19.39 points down at 2099.25.

THE narrow measure of the money supply, M0, whose main component is
notes and coins in ciculation, picked up in February, according to Bank
of England figures published yesterday.
The figures could herald a rebound in retail sales which dropped by
0.9% in January. M0 increased by a seasonally-adjusted 0.5% last month
after a 0.2% fall previously. The City consensus had been an increase of
0.3%.
However, the annual growth rate slowed for the fourth month in a row
to 6.2% from 6.5%, still well above the 0% to 4% monitoring range. The
gradual deceleration in M0 is consistent with a slowdown in retail sales
growth in recent months and the three increases in interest rates since
September.
David Walton, senior UK economist at the US investment bank Goldman
Sachs, said: ''M0 is quite a good forward-looking indicator of
inflation.
''I think these figures are going to help encourage the authorities to
believe that it was right to raise interest rates when they did but also
that we may be getting to the point where policy has already been
tightened enough.''
Last week detailed figures for gross domestic product in the fourth
quarter showed that consumer spending increased by 0.6%, slightly more
than in the previous two quarters, despite a rise of just 0.2% in retail
sales. The figure was all the more surprising because mild weather
depressed demand for gas and electricity.
Consumers seem to be diverting spending away from the High Streets,
possibly to items such as travel and eating out, which are more likely
to be settled by credit card or cheque than paid for in cash.
This would help to explain the slowdown in M0 at a time when consumer
spending was picking up. Consumer credit figures for January, due on
Friday, may help to clarify the situation.

PHARMACEUTICALS distribution group AAH has rejected as ''opportunistic
and worthless'' a #377m takeover bid from the German group Gehe AG,
Europe's largest drugs wholesaler.
The bid, worth 420p a share in cash, boosted AAH's share price 122p to
431p and prompted 8p and 7p respective rises in both Lloyds Chemists
(290p) and Unichem (253p).
AAH, whose first-half profits to the end of September fell from #19.1m
to #16.4m before tax, recently issued a profit warning after a further
downturn in trading at its environmental services division. This
prompted stockbroker Smith New Court to cut its full-year profit
forecast from #36.5m to #30m.
The company's reaction to Gehe, though, was to say that it could
resolve its recent trading problems by itself and had no need of any
outside bidder.
''We are confident we can work it out right by ourselves,'' commented
chairman John Padovan. Shareholders are advised to take no action.
Gehe expressed surprise at AAH's immediate rejection of the bid with
chairman Dieter Kaemmerer stating: ''It wasn't expected, at least not to
this extent.'' He described the terms as fair and generous but would not
comment on any possibility of it being raised.
If the bid is successful Gehe plans to review the non-wholesaling
operations of AAH which, aside from environmental services (waste
management services), includes a large chemists chain, and vehicle hire
and contract distribution. The Gehe chairman said it was too early to
say if such a process would involve the sell-off of any assets or a
restructuring within the group.
When issuing its trading warning earlier this month, AAH stressed that
core wholesale and retail healthcare operations continued to perform
soundly and that it intended to pay a maintained final dividend of
11.9p.

GLASGOW Investment Managers has boosted funds under management by more
than one-third, with the award of a #60m-plus investment mandate by
Tunbridge Wells Equitable Friendly Society.
The investment management group, which already oversees #11m for
Tunbridge Wells, beat off competition from Kleinwort Benson, Schroders
and Phillips &amp; Drew.
Glasgow Investment Managers will be responsible for all of the
society's unit-linked funds, after taking over the management of its
Capital &amp; Income, Dominion, Beehive and Pension Managed funds.
The group, which started from scratch in 1986, now has #215m under
management, and has a sound track record of investment in UK equities,
with particular expertise in relation to smaller companies.
The new business fits well within the current operations of Glasgow
Investment Managers, which operates the #100m Shires Investment, #15m
Glasgow Income, and #30m Shires High-Yielding Smaller Companies Trust.
Tunbridge Wells's Capital &amp; Income and Dominion Growth funds focus on
UK equities, with the former having a smaller company emphasis.

STERLING (and the Japanese stock market) have borne the brunt of the
fallout from the collapse of Barings merchant bank, whose capital and
reserves were nowhere near sufficient to meet the unquantifiable losses
from derivatives trading in Osaka of one 28-year-old trader in its
Singapore office.
UK equities and gilts withstood the crisis much better than had been
feared with the merchant banking sector bearing the worst of the losses.
The ancient firm of Barings has paid the price for not having risk
management systems in place to identify the rogue's activities until it
was too late. Inside and outside the financial community there is
incredulity that this should have been so, tempered by humility that,
maybe, it could have happened to any one of the players on the world's
burgeoning markets in financial futures.
The situation was too grave for the Bank of England to mount an
immediate rescue operation without unlimited recourse to public funds.
Major players fought shy of committing themselves to the unknown.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, has ordered a review
of the regulatory system, but the problem of oversight is ultimately a
matter for the international financial community, both the central
bankers and their private sector counterparts. Every bank around the
world will be checking its own procedures to limit its exposure to
unauthorised trading.
If, as a result, trade in financial futures diminishes it will be no
great loss. Cash markets have increasingly played second fiddle to
futures trading, an enormously profitable, if ultimately dangerous,
business that has grown up in the aftermath of Black Monday 7[1/2] years
ago.
As soon as markets opened in the Far East on Sunday night sterling was
in trouble posting a succession of fresh lows against the German mark,
which was enjoying enhanced attractions in its familar safe haven role.
After breaching its previous low of DM2.3150 (recorded in February
1993) the pound continued to plummet all the way to DM2.2950 before
recovering to DM2.3065, a loss of 2.25 pfennigs since Friday night. The
drop against the dollar, which itself took a beating from the
Deutschmark, was confined to 0.30 cents at $1.5835.
The trade-weighted index, closely monitored by the Bank of England,
dropped from Friday night's 87.1 to 86.5 at 9am, but managed to clamber
back to 86.8, only just its lowest closing level this year.
The Barings debacle provided foreign exchange traders with another
excuse to shoot at sterling, which has been seriously weakened by the
Government's political difficulties over Europe and Northern Ireland and
by the strength of the mark, which has also been hurting the usually
solid Continental currencies.
Tomorrow night's vote on Europe was too close for comfort. Moreover,
the Bank of England's room for manoeuvre was constrained by the need to
allow short-term interest rates to ease to combat liquidity shortages
that could have arisen from the collapse of Barings.
By the end of the day financial markets were discounting a less rapid
tightening of monetary policy. Gilts, a refuge from riskier financial
instruments, recovered from earlier losses as sterling fought back from
its morning lows and ended trading in positive trading.
But the big surprise was the resilience of the equity market, which
began the day confronting a loss of 664 points, equal to 3.8%, on the
Nikkei Dow Jones index.
At one point the Japanese market, which has to cope with Barings
losses, was sporting a fall of nearly 1000 points.
Overnight there had been speculation that the Footsie could lose up to
100 points. But the prognostications of the super-bears were not borne
out by events.
The FTSE-100 share index opening less than 40 points down at 2998.2,
but was soon back above the 3000 mark. As the City regained its nerves
equities continued to recover, and by the close of trading the index was
only 12.4 points lower at 3025.3. Wall Street, too, was taking the
Barings affair in its stride.
The Bank of England had apparently been successful in persuading the
City that it had been able to confine the damage. Barings was not going
to drag bigger players down with it.
The City, too, is seldom slow to spot value in financial markets. With
the FTSE index almost 1000 points adrift from the Dow Jones in New York,
UK shares seem undervalued on fundamental grounds.
But it would be wrong to assume that the crisis is over. Japanese
stocks are bound to remain vulnerable, at least until the Barings
contracts have been closed. Other victims may yet emerge. Sterling
remains a politically suspect currency, and the long-term damage to the
City of London cannot be quantified.
There was, however, reassurance for the 50,000 investors in Barings'
#30bn clutch of offshore funds, investment trusts and unit trusts.
Barings Asset Management, which invests the funds on behalf of its
clients, was thought to be ring-fenced from the calamity overtaking its
parent.
Clients would only be exposed if spare cash had been deposited with
Barings bank. Most of the funds appear to have been fairly fully
invested.
Barings manages four investment trusts -- shares in the largest
Barings Tribune dropped 13p to 302p yesterday -- and 19 unit trusts, and
the asset management business could have a value of #300m on its own if
it was sold off separately from the rest of the bank.
Meanwhile Britain's independent merchant bank sector looks
increasingly exposed. Warburgs, whose shares fell 35p to 683p, has
already had one unsuccessful attempt to find a larger merger partner,
Morgan Stanley.
Barings was an extreme example in an under-capitalised sector, whose
constituents are likely to have to find more powerful allies or develop
niche roles with limited exposure to risk.

ALBRIGHT &amp; Wilson, the old-established UK chemicals company which is
being floated by US parent Tenneco, its owner since 1978, looks set to
make a buoyant start when share dealings begin on March 8.
The public offer of the shares, which closed on Friday, has been
oversubscribed 3.6 times. Representing just 15% of the total float, the
rest is being placed with institutional and other investors. The company
has received applications for 216.5 million Ordinary shares at the
flotation price of 150p a share.
The company said: ''It will not be possible to satisfy all this
demand.'' The allocations have been changed to meet the high demand and
investors applying to buy more than 400 shares face a cut.
The success of the issue does not come as any real surprise. Tenneco,
which will raise some #520m gross from the offer, including #50m of
dividend, had originally hoped to rate some #600m but the price was
pitched much lower because of uncertainty in the new issue market.
The shares are being offered at about 10 times current year earnings,
around a 20% discount against the market generally and about 30% against
the chemicals sector.

BARINGS was the oldest British merchant bank, tracing its origins back
to 1762. That ethos seemed to pervade its headquarters building, an ugly
20-storey brownish block in London's Bishopsgate shared with Deutsche
Bank, which owns Barings' merchant-banking rival, Morgan Grenfell.
Besides being family controlled, it always seemed to be so gentlemanly
but also rather supercilious -- after all, some directors have been
seen, indeed on more than one occasion, to wipe their hands after
meeting the press.
Barings' corporate finance department also considered itself somewhat
above hoi polloi of the likes of Warburg.
Its history has passed into folklore, as to how what was a simple
commodities house had, by 1800 or so, become the major supplier of funds
to fight the Napoleonic Wars, to purchase the State of Louisiana in
1803, and in the forefront of providing entrepreneurial finance for the
building of railways in South America. Defaulting Argentina in 1890
brought it to its knees, and on that occasion the Bank of England was
successful in saving the remnants of the business.
The shares are owned by the Baring Foundation which is a charitable
trust distributing #13.7m last year, of which all but #2m came from the
bank. The chairman is Peter Baring, 59, who was paid #1,242,000 in 1993,
when the bank achieved profits of #100m.
However, that conceals the other, Essex-culture side of Barings with
the its willingness to be aggressive in developing the overseas
businesses, initially equities and then derivatives. That is a market
where extremely rapid thinking on one's feet in the London International
Financial Futures Exchange open-cry market is light years away from
corporate finance and fund management -- there are some #31 billion in
its control.
The move into the Far East and having the ability to second guess
local operators in Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore resulted in 1993 in
some #46m of profits coming from that region.
Barings jumped into the public gaze in 1986 when Mr Christopher Heath
astounded the world when it was revealed that he had earned #2.3m
because of the success of the Far East operations which he had set up.
He resigned in 1993 after a tiff with the rest of the board over the
derivatives market.

Andrew Wilson discovers feelings of schadenfreude in the High Street
AFTER Barings, who is next? The problems cannot be confined to just
one bank and after all aren't the Swiss banks great traders as are the
Japanese?
But in some banking halls today, there is grim satisfaction over the
Barings disaster and the smugness that the well-paid and in some cases
extremely well-rewarded merchant bankers have received a bloody nose.
These smirks come from some staff at the clearing or high-street banks
whose rewards are usually somewhat pedestrian and where excitement and
the thrill of making a significant contribution to the organisation
through a personal risk-taking decision is a rarity if it happens at
all.
The cultural differences between the clearing and merchant banks are
so extreme that the transition between the two is very difficult.
There have been those crossing the divide but the success rate is
remarkably low because of the constraints inherent in the clearing bank
where the first rule is to protect oneself, then look after the bank,
and then comes the interest of the customer where few individual ones
matter very much in terms of profitability.
That is reflected by the problems that some clearers have had in
assimilating merchant banks, as the canny manager finds the risk
exposures taken by the merchant banker extremely uncomfortable.
That partly reflects the different types of competition, with the
high-street bankers trying to take advantage of each other, but as they
are very much the same creatures the gains are fairly limited. In
contrast, the merchant bankers face international competition while
providing a much wider range of services where innovation and being
ahead of the pack are crucial.
The problem is that the derivatives market is huge, with turnover now
approaching $100 billion a year. But it is zero sum. That is, for every
profit, there is a compensating loss -- where else does the money come
from, as someone has to write the deal for the option taker to buy it?
It has grown out of the traditional options where one had the right to
buy or sell a share or commodity at a predetermined time in the future
at a stipulated price by paying a small premium for the privilege. That
was to protect an existing investment against any untoward change. The
premium varies as to the level of demand for these forward deals when
set against the cash or current price.
These progressed into currency and then interest-rate futures where an
element of gearing was introduced so that one paid only perhaps 10% of
the value of the contract so that one could have a better run for one's
money. The understanding is that if the contract, whether it be for a
stock, currency, or commodity such as gold or cocoa, or if an index sees
the underlying value move down sharply, then the investor has to make
immediate payment to cover the loss.
The system has developed to such an extent that there are now products
on the market so complex that very few people can understand them,
involving perhaps a mixture of interest rates and currencies gelling
together at certain predetermined times.
Because the bank selling the option frequently stands to make huge
profits, staff are commensurately rewarded. But there is a conflict of
interest for the bank in that it may well be acting both for clients and
running its own proprietary trading book where it takes the risk.
Ideally it should not run naked. Instead, if it sells a derivative off
its own book, it should cover itself elsewhere. But that does cost money
and reduces potential rewards and so traders are well remunerated for
skilful trading.
The challenge is that these traders' books have to be constantly
monitored with the sums at risk well within the bank's routine financial
resources.
But some traders can mark the book when the deal goes wrong and the
bank takes the loss, and they arrange through a friend in the
back-office or in another bank to take the occasional profit.
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation chief executive John Bond
conceded yesterday that it was impossible to stop fraud completely and
that the bank had reduced the risk by having about 90% of its dealing
turnover for clients only and having reduced the size of the proprietary
book.
However, more unpleasantness seems certain to crawl out from under
stones over the next few months.

A wholesale abuse of the system is on trial along with O J Simpson,
discovers ROS DAVIDSON
OVER the next few months, jurors in the O J Simpson trial will
struggle with the accusations that the handsome former sports,
advertising and movie hero is a chronic domestic abuser who resorted to
murder rather than lose control of his ex-wife Nicole.
The world has been riveted by chilling testimony of Simpson's alleged
rages, brutal abuse and humiliation of the 35-year-old mother of two of
his children.
Simpson denies killing his ex-wife and her friend Ron Goldman on June
12 last year. But it is known that he pled no contest to spousal
battering in 1989, and that the police intervened in their relationship
more than once on behalf of Nicole.
Whatever the jury's view of the alleged abuse, few are more familiar
with such behaviour than Hamish Sinclair, a former social activist who
now concentrates on halting spousal abuse. ''O J sounds typical,'' he
sighs, seated outside a San Fransisco cafe a couple of miles north of
where Simpson was raised. ''It's not a crime of passion that's being
prosecuted here. It's domestic violence.''
Sinclair, originally from Kinlochleven, is a man at the cutting edge
of what US Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala has called
America's ''dirty little secret''. Abuse by partners is the single
leading cause of injuries to women aged 15 to 44 in America, the US
surgeon-general announced in 1992.
As the Simpson trial unfolds, the programme developed by the
62-year-old Scot is being watched closely. Since last summer, when a
major domestic violence bill was passed in California after Nicole
Simpson's murder, Sinclair's methods have been officially adopted as the
model for treating batterers.
Sinclair sees domestic abuse as a ''political'' problem, the logical
outcome of how a sexist culture defines sex roles, not aberrant
behaviour. At root is male coercion and control, he says. ''It has
nothing to do with neurosis, psychosis or a question of anger, it's
ordinary everyday business.''
Those attending his Manalive weekly all-male groups must take
responsibility and respect their partners. During the second of two
years in the programme, they are encouraged to spread the word about
non-violence. One third to a half of the several hundred men in Manalive
programmes have been ordered to attend by the courts.
Never before has domestic abuse been at the core of a celebrity
prosecution like Simpson's, says Sinclair, who has been involved with
domestic violence projects in Stirling and Edinburgh.
Many aspects of Simpson's alleged behaviour are familiar to him. But
when the subject is first raised, he changes the focus by saying it is
not about O J Simpson, it is about Nicole Simpson. ''You have to punch
someone in the face to know you're superior, like O J kicking a woman
out of the house,'' he says, referring to a recent prosecution witness
testifying that Simpson threw Nicole against the wall and later threw
her out of the house.
Also familiar is the prosecution's contention, in its opening
argument, that Simpson murdered Nicole after she tried to sever all
contact. The woman is in most danger when she tries to leave, he says.
Sinclair adds that Simpson and his lawyers' arguments are typical of
batterers. ''The whole defence is denial, minimisation, blame and
collusion.'' Simpson denies he was abusive, has expressed self-pity, and
said he was the abused one.
Sinclair's involvement in this field is a long way from his early
years in Scotland. His father -- senior elder at the kirk and a
well-known Mason -- worked at the aluminium factory. His mother stressed
service as the highest achievement. Sinclair attended a school
co-founded by the educator A S Neill, Bryanston in Dorest, on a company
scholarship. For three years, he excelled at painting, pottery,
sculpture and sports but not academic subjects. His subsequent arts
scholarship with Sanderson wallpaper was interrupted by national
service.
He volunteered for Malaysia but was instead attached to the Royal Army
Service Corps as a mapmaker. On night watch while stationed at Edinburgh
Castle, he wrote poetry. And he says he and others used to dress up in
suits of armour secretly at night for laughs. ''I learned a total lack
of deference for the whole male trip -- all the pomp and circumstance,''
he says. ''It seemed so stupid and inhuman.''
In the early 1950s he moved to London to study art history but instead
became a painter, working in coffee shops and mingling with other
beatnicks.
After getting married, he and his English wife Janet ran the
Craigrannoch Hotel in Ballachulish for a summer. But he became so
intrigued after meeting an American movie-maker, he was soon working on
a film with him on Clydeside shipbuilding. Not long after, came the move
to New York.
After getting involved in radical film-makers linked with the peace
movement, he even directed a short used to train those protesting
against the Polaris base at Holy Loch. But Sinclair also became aware,
unlike many of his middle-class colleagues, that shipyard workers needed
jobs even if it meant building military vessels.
After his marriage broke up, he moved to south-east Kentucky as
rank-and-file organiser in mining villages so marginal, the union had
deserted them. It was a militant time. After eight men were accused of
dynamiting a railway, Sinclair organised the defence.
But it was not until he returned to organising working class people in
Detroit that he became aware of women's issues. ''If the women wanted to
go to community meetings, the guys got furious. They wanted them at
home.''
Since Sinclair did not side with only the men, he was seen as a
betrayer promoting feminism. The issue became so heated, he says, he
received death threats. He resigned and for a year, read feminism and
travelled through America. ''I came to completely understand why women
were so afraid of batterers -- I went underground because three of them
were after me.''
For two years in radical Berkeley in California, he immersed himself
in the human potential (''I'm OK, You're OK'') movement and feminism. He
says he became aware of how he had treated women, including his wife.
''I had no regard for her in that whole nine years. I lived with her as
if she were an encumbrance attached to me.''
While working for four years in an experimental psychology residential
unit with schizophrenics, he began to adopt a ''political approach'' to
group therapy. ''I was testing the premise that powerlessness makes you
crazy,'' he says. But he also found that violent men were drawn to him
and his team.
By 1980 Sinclair had been hired to head a men's programme at Marin
Abused Women's Services, across the Golden Gate Bridge from San
Francisco. ''I realised that if I could get a bunch of guys together, I
could change their belief system,'' he says. ''The whole shibboleth of
denial is a peer pressure denial.''
Manalive is not the usual soft-pedal therapy, where men learn to
control anger or emote about a childhood often itself shattered and
moulded by violence. Men learn responsibility, and not to objectify
their partners even in ordinary ways, for example by saying ''the wife''
and not using her name.
The drop-out rate seems high. Only about 50% will show up for the
second week, and by the end of 32 weeks, about a quarter are left. But
of those, Sinclair says that fully 80% stop the violence. ''It's the end
of denial,'' says Sinclair. ''Most men, when they hear another man is
being straight with them, even if they are under a court shadow, are
willing to stay.''

HSBC played down the impact of the Barings collapse, with chief
executive John Bond saying that the group -- Britain's biggest bank --
had only a modest exposure to the Barings derivatives contracts as a
counter-party.
He added that HSBC had been involved with all the other major UK banks
in discussions with the Bank of England over a possible rescue. They had
been prepared to contribute to any refinancing but not to write a blank
cheque.
He was speaking after the group revealed 1994 pre-tax profits up 23%
at #3166m, with the Midland Bank subsidiary contributing #61m more at
#905m. After an increased tax charge, earnings per share were 12%
higher.
The dividend total has been raised 15%, with a 19p final bringing the
total up to 27p, which gives the shares, down 6p at 660p, a yield of
5.1%.
Market sentiment was affected by the Barings problem, which underlined
HSBC's own difficulties earlier in the year when the shakeout in fixed
interest markets brought a #123m loss on bond trading. This prompted
HSBC to withdraw from own-account dealing in these markets.
The profits advance stemmed largely from a sharp fall in bad-debt
provisions, which tumbled from #1158m to #275m. This was partly offset
by a fall in dealing profits from #1089m to #261m, reflecting difficult
markets worldwide.
Interest income was just 4% ahead at #4597m, while fees and
commissions were #331m higher at #2331m. Disposals made #366m against
#287m.
Chairman Sir William Purves said the 1994 result was satisfactory
given difficult conditions in the treasury and capital markets, coupled
with increased competition generally.
Prospects are considered no better, with Sir William calling the
outlook ''challenging'' though the group was well positioned for future
growth.
Midland Bank had bad-debt charges down from #670m to just #98m. Chief
executive Keith Whitson said they had seen the benefits of the improving
UK economy and the results of prudent provisioning in previous years.
Dealing profits were also well down, though the second half was
considerably better than the first. Mr Whitson said it was difficult to
say whether or not the markets had turned.
Midland claims enhanced market share across a broad range of products.
First Direct, the telephone banking service, added 200,000 customers to
700,000. Staff cuts kept the rise in costs to 1% but Midland's headcount
was slightly higher overall at 45,900, nearly half the group total,
because of the growth of First Direct, personal financial services and
credit card business.
HSBC is aiming to grow organically and Mr Whitson commented that as
far as major acquisitions were concerned they had ''nothing specific in
mind''.
He added that they would not be queuing up to buy parts of Barings.

Nicola Reeves reports that on an international scale controls can be
circumvented as easily as in any High Street bank
LOOKING from outside the City, people could be forgiven for thinking
how can a 28-year-old have the capacity to run up losses in excess of
#500m over a period of a few weeks with apparently few, if any,
controls.
Controls exist in the form of regulatory supervision by banking
authorities such as the Bank of England and internal audit positions
within each bank which monitor the day-to-day positions taken by
traders. However, it is possible, as Nick Leeson appears to have done,
to circumvent these controls, but then similar action could be taken by
any bank clerk working in a traditional High Street bank.
The difference which the Barings case has highlighted is the
potentially huge scale of the monies involved in derivative financial
transactions. It is not unusual for senior heads of trading desks to
take a punt on financial markets with hundreds of millions of pounds.
In a trading environment such as that operating in dealing rooms
across the world, you have to speculate to accumulate. Otherwise, the
argument goes, why not put your money on deposit in a building society?
If this deal had not gone horribly wrong Barings would have been looking
at a potentially large profit on the position and the trader would have
been rewarded with a generous bonus.
Derivatives are a relatively new phenomenon and remain, at least in
the UK, the preserve of the specialist financial community. What they
are and how they work is a mystery to large numbers of people even
within the financial community itself, engaged in more traditional
activities such as stockbroking and corporate finance. Thelanguage of
the market -- its ''calls'', ''puts'', ''spreads'', and ''delta
sensitivity'' -- is certain to confuse novices.
The pace of innovation in derivatives markets, coupled with ever more
powerful new technology, means that people working in the field will
invariably be under 35. Banks and investment houses send their young
bloods to battle it out in the financial whirlpool of the derivatives
market. The average age of teams of traders employed by groups such as
Nomura International and Deutsche Bank on the London International
Financial Futures Exchange is 25. They tend to change jobs frequently.
Increasingly their skills will be in more esoteric financial
instruments because that is potentially where most money can be made. In
the past so-called ''barrow boys'', brash young men from East London,
used to be the mainstay of the derivatives market. However, increasingly
these days postgraduate mathematicians, statisticians, and computer
whiz-kids, so-called ''rocket scientists'', are being employed to devise
highly complex computer programmes identifying possible lucrative
trading strategies.
The relative scarcity of people with such skills enables them to
command salaries ahead of even many of their fellow City employees. An
annual figure of #250,000 upwards including bonus would not be
considered unusual for a derivatives trader.
However, despite the cheque-book salaries it is not a job that people
can do for any great length of time given the high pressure they work
under and long hours. The markets never sleep and therefore sleep is not
a high priority on the list of derivative traders who often stay in
touch with the world's financial markets around the clock. This plays
havoc with any family life and accounts for the relatively few women
traders in what remains one of the few remaining bastions of neanderthal
man.
As in many high-pressure jobs, it is often difficult for traders to
switch off from work when they leave their desks. Many traders prefer to
spend their free time with colleagues.
They typically play as hard as they work, often abusing various
substances both alcoholic and narcotic, splashing out on flash cars and
minimalist designer flats, and many prefer the company of prostitutes to
establishing a relationship.
The generally aggressive and uncouth nature of such traders sets them
apart from gentler souls employed elsewhere in the markets.
Of course, looking at the situation from the point of view of what
nurses or teachers get paid the sums involved seem obscene, but at the
end of the day the free market dictates what people earn. It so happens
that society chooses to place a higher monetary value on the people with
the skills that the City requires.
Financial futures are a relatively new idea. Chicago saw its first
financial futures contract only in 1972. The London International
Financial Futures Exchange did not open for business until 1982 years
later.
Two years ago, Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, warned that
growth of derivatives markets could endanger the stability of the world
financial system.
Trading derivatives can get a grip on investors as powerful as any
other gambling addiction. But, unlike share deals, the trader in
derivatives can lose the total investment if the price moves the wrong
way.
One of the victims of the fever was Scottish worm breeder Alexander
McLennan whose independent dealing was brought to grief by the Black
Monday Stock Market crash in October 1987. His debts amounted to #3m.
At the end of the day derivatives trading is another form of gambling
where you win some, you lose some. Until now the number of losers has
been relatively small but it is growing. The danger must be that sooner
or later the whole pack of cards will come tumbling down and plunge the
world's financial establishment into crisis.

* Late January: The timing of the first fatal deals is uncertain but
at this date, Nick Leeson, a 28-year-old dealer working for Barings in
Singapore, starts to buy derivative contracts ultimately totalling
40,000 and nominally worth some #5000m, though he requires only a small
fraction of this sum to establish the trading position. He is betting
that the Nikkei 225 share index in Japan will rise. His reasoning is
unclear because the market is showing no clear trend and has lately been
unsettled by the Osaka earthquake.
* Mid-February: His error is compounded when he effectively sells
derivative instruments he hasn't got to fund losses on his earlier
transactions. This increases his already huge gamble further.
* Late February: The hoped for rally in Tokyo shares fails to
materialise.
* Thursday, February 23: The disaster starts to come to light as the
Tokyo stock market falls. Barings in Singapore is called upon to put up
cash to offset the losses the contracts are sustaining. It fails to do
so and at this point the bank's senior managers in the City of London
learn of the situation. The huge scale of the disaster gradually comes
to light. Mr Neeson disappears.
* Friday, February 24: The Bank of England is informed of what has
happened and its Governor Eddie George cancels a planned holiday to try
to organise a rescue. The Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke is
advised of the catastrophe. Banking authorities in Tokyo and Singapore
are consulted.
* Saturday, February 25: The desperate search for a way out begins in
earnest. Senior bankers like TSB chairman Sir Nicholas Goodison are
called in from their weekend retreats to discuss possible action with
the Bank. Other central banks are informed.
* Sunday, February 26: All parties realise they have to have a full
rescue in place by the time the Tokyo stock market opens at midnight UK
time. Everyone is fully aware of the damage the affair will do to
financial markets and the City's reputation. There is willingness to
find an answer, and a package to pump #700m into Barings is tentatively
agreed by clearing banks, securities houses, and even some overseas
banks. But there is one stumbling-block -- the size of Barings' losses
cannot be quantified. No-one is prepared to shoulder even part of an
unlimited liability and Mr George rejects a Government bail-out.
* 9.25 Sunday evening: Mr George concludes no rescue is possible and
leaves for home. Accountants Ernst &amp; Young are appointed administrators
of Barings and all the bank's assets are frozen.
* Midnight: Tokyo stock markets open with steep falls, followed by
other Far Eastern markets. Tokyo loses 5.5% though recoups some of this
drop, closing 3.8% down at a 15-month low. Sterling plunges in these
markets.
* Early Monday morning, February 27: Eddie George interviewed on the
radio reassures listeners that the disaster is limited to Barings and
will not affect other banks.
* 8.30 Monday morning: London stock-market dealers take their places
expecting the worst but after a sharp fall in the share indices at the
opening no selling materialises and they subsequently rally. But
sterling falls to a new low of 2.2950 to the German mark on lack of
confidence.

Continuing her series on relationships that overcome the odds, Anvar
Khan encounters a triumph of hope over despair
WHEN Helen Rose, 40, no longer saw herself first and foremost as a
woman, but as a sufferer of Parkinson's Disease, she cut off her hair.
''She had beautiful, long, dark hair,'' remembers her husband Peter, 47,
when he talks of what attracted him to his wife in the first place.
Helen adds: ''It just wasn't practical any more.''
They met at a dance in Leeds at the end of 1972. Peter was then in the
army. He had been stationed in the Persian Gulf, one of 40 British
soldiers and about 2,000 Arabs. He worked a 26-hour week; spent the rest
scuba-diving, water-skiing and generally hanging out in the sun. He
proposed to a smart young woman, who sewed and designed her own suits,
wore huge floppy hats, and had ''big eyes''. Three years later, Helen
developed a temperamental cramp in her foot. Soon, he had a wife who
thought that asking him to brush and wash her hair would be an
additional burden on his life.
Peter describes having Parkinson's Disease as skidding in a car. You
can see what you're going to hit but you can't stop. The disease is a
communication gap between the brain and the body. Helen's so wonky, that
when she tries to walk without her wheelchair, she uses random cracks in
the pavement as a graph of where she might aim her feet.
The Roses have a bungalow in Edinburgh. Theirs is a bright corner of
the world. They have a dog called Heidi and two children, Ashleigh, 24,
from Helen's previous relationship, and Stuart, 18. Stuart has always
been very protective of his mum, coming home from school to check on her
when his father was doing night shift at the brewery where he works as a
warehouseman.
Peter tries to do as many night shifts as possible, so he can be at
home during the day. He has a set routine. At 9.30am, he washes and
dresses his wife, organises her drugs, then prepares the tea so that
it's ready before he goes out to work. He's a man of simple tastes. As
long as he's got his cigarettes and his coffee, and can go and see his
beloved team, Hearts, when they play, he can put up with anything.
It wasn't until Helen was pregnant with her son, and opened the
confidential ante-natal card her GP asked her to deliver to a clinic,
that she understood she wasn't imagining an illness. He suspected she
had multiple sclerosis. It took a long time; a series of hospital stays
and gruesome tests, to establish that Helen had Parkinson's disease.
Then it took a long time, with the same format, to establish there was
nothing anyone could do to help her. She was 22.
Helen Rose is the youngest person in Britain to have developed
Parkinson's disease. The usual age is 50. People with terrible problems
try to justify why they, particularly, have been chosen to suffer. Helen
too, believed that she was being singled out. She says: ''I had a child
at 16. I thought I was being punished for being a naughty girl.'' Helen
had a hysterectomy at 29; the side-effects of the various drugs which
aimed to minimise her discomfort were ruining her internal organs. She
remembers where she was when Elvis died; curled up into a ball on Ward
28 of Astley Ainslie Hospital after having sample fluid taken from her
spine. When Peter told her the King was dead she didn't believe him.
There are no explanations as to why Parkinson's disease occurs. In an
attempt to sound hard, Helen ''blames the operator on the assembly line
for letting me slip though quality control''.
The Roses have the comfort of their tranquil semi with an aviary in
the back garden. Peter breeds budgies. Single bulbs of horizon blue and
banana yellow zoot about behind the wooden and chicken wire mesh. But in
the early years the couple weren't surrounded by natural beauty. There
isn't much of it in Niddrie Marshall. When they left a three-floor
tenement with a young baby and a pram and moved into a ground-floor
flat, Helen's stooped, apologetic hobble was viciously aped by
neighbour's kids. She found an empty match-box on the floor under the
letter-box. And it wasn't until the family went to their GP, covered in
red spots, that they realised it contained fleas.
Ignorance seems to be at a premium, nowadays, though there was an
incident, the other day, when Helen ordered a taxi after taking her
drugs, not so much a cocktail as a bomb. They produce frenetic
convulsions. She finished exhausted and in a sweat. The driver told her
she shouldn't be out, that she should be kept in. All she needed to
hear, after coming out of hiding. Peter adds that when it comes to
taking Helen out in her wheelchair, going out to see a performer or a
band, it's amazing how many places are fully-booked.
Peter used to be criticised by hospital staff and patients for being
cruel, for putting his wife over his shoulder when he collected her. ''I
wanted a fifty-fifty relationship,'' he said, ''as equals. But as Helen
became more ill I had to make all the decisions.'' Helen gets short
thrift if she tries to take the easy way out. But Peter's hard to live
with too. He snores. And, Helen complains, when she tells him what she
wants to eat he always retorts with a ''Are you sure?'' It bugs her. ''I
just want to make sure she's remembered what she's said,'' he explains.
Helen rolls her eyes, frustrated at why Peter can't realise she can take
care of herself.

KEVIN Swingler is a man of undeniable talents. He's an innovator,
entrepreneur, computer software designer, and now award winner.
The undoubted skills and knowledge of the Stirling-based computer
expert are also in great demand as major multi-national companies vie to
secure his advice and services.
He moved north from Exeter some four years ago, having completed his
degree at the local university, and began work on a project for British
Telecom involving speech recognition.
It has now been successfully incorporated in a number of different
schemes but, in particular, within the banking world where customers can
now phone up to receive their bank balance.
Along with three colleagues who had studied a variety of aspects
surrounding computing at Stirling University, Kevin began exploring
technology whereby computers can actually learn about problems from
studying the data alone -- rather than having to be continually
programmed, often by specialists.
Called neural network technology, the product recently secured
25-year-old Kevin a #10,000 prize after he won the much coveted title of
Best Innovative Project by an Entrepreneur at the John Logie Baird
Awards for Innovation.
Widely recognised as a practical way of identifying the best
innovative ideas in the country, and helping turn them into commercial
success, the awards were co-sponsored by Scottish Enterprise and Touche
Ross.
Having established that there are no software packages currently
available on the shelves offering neural network technology to solve
problems without requiring specialist programming skills, the group is
hopeful of providing this unique service shortly.
The initiative has already been incorporated by Kevin while working on
a project for a major car maker. He was approached by Ford to establish
a programme on driver alertness.
He explained: ''We have, in fact, established a programme that can
recognise the way a car behaves when a driver falls asleep at the wheel
-- and wake the person up.
''Whether Ford introduce the concept to the market remains to be seen.
It is now out of my control. I have simply established that the basic
concept works.
''Ford may consider that some drivers push themselves and drive longer
believing that they will be wakened if there are any problems. It is a
difficult one,'' Kevin admitted.
Nevertheless, the computer designer continued: ''This is simply one of
the ways neural technology can help business.
''There are obviously many other ways that it can prove highly
beneficial, and these will become clearer when the software package is
available.''
Having successfully completed this task, Kevin has now turned his
attention towards a programme at Stirling University to assist several
bakery companies -- rising prospects indeed.

Key Scots agencies are involved in training and vocational education
revolution, as Bill Magee reports
SCOTLAND is in the midst of a revolution in training and vocational
education. A key area involves Local Enterprise Companies (LECs) and
represents an initiative to deliver a national quality framework leading
to the award of SVQ-related qualifications.
In 1991, Scottish Enterprise, Highland and Islands Enterprise, and the
Scottish Vocational Education Council published a joint statement of
intent to co-operate closely towards achieving such a structure.
To realise this, SE initiated and funded development of SQMS,
shorthand for Scottish Quality Management System, to develop a
harmonised framework in Scotland.
SQMS is built as a composite of existing systems with currency in
Scotland, drawing on and bringing together criteria operated by key
agencies plus the Scottish Office Education Department.
It relates to the BS5750 quality assurance interests and requirements
along with Investors in People Scotland.
SQMS was developed by the Scottish Further Education Unit, working in
collaboration with SE management, a project management group involving
the Scotvec council, SOID, and Highlands &amp; Islands. Other LECs have been
involved in steering group work.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said the new system is now fundamentally
supporting development of autonomous, self-regulating projects, making a
major contribution to delivery of high quality education and training.
Among the first recipients of SQMS is Lothian Management Centre, where
hundreds of senior managers have passed through LMS hands, with four out
of five finding new jobs.
One of Scotland's leading training providers is behind this work.
Quirk and Company partner Lesley Quirk, a director of LMC, said the
award represented a partnership effort also involving Queen Margaret
College business development centre and Scottish Enterprise Foundation
at Stirling University.
''SQMS accreditation represents a hallmark placing the management
centre at the leading edge of vocational education and training in
Scotland,'' she added.
Bill Leslie, training and management director of the LEC involved,
Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Limited (LEEL), said:
''LMS consistently delivers an exceptionally high standard of work and
is the first in Lothian to receive what is a vitally important training
award.''
Quirk &amp; Co majors in business development, management resourcing,
training, personal management, marketing, and finance and business
skills for women.
In tandem with its LEC work, it has worked with the Bank of Scotland,
PA Consulting Group, and Edinburgh, Stirling, and Motherwell district
councils.
There is a Motherwell connection also with another top provider, JCS
Training Services, one of the biggest firms in the sector which also has
bases in Glasgow, Greenock, and Airdrie.
JCS works closely with the LECs covering construction, electronics,
computers, and mechanical engineering -- even equestrian training.
It seems that east-to-west Scotland is in good training hands as the
workforce of tomorrow learns new skills.

AFTER almost five years of constant litigation, there was an almost
palpable feeling of shock at Strathclyde Region's social work department
when the original finding of sexual abuse was reversed.
No-one will say so in so many words, but there remains a sense that
the department believes its members were acting from the best of motives
to protect children they believed had suffered abuse.
There is also disappointment that Sheriff Miller appears to have given
so much weight to the evidence produced by the experts representing the
parents -- especially after two other judgments did not dispute Sheriff
Neil Gow's original finding.
On top of that, every children's panel hearing in the past
four-and-a-half years has been appealed. The legal scrutiny of this case
has been immense and has proved extremely stressful, not only for the
parents and children concerned, but also for the social workers and care
workers.
At various points during the whole saga, there have been claims made
that social workers were being harassed. It is understood that these
claims persist.
Miss Mary Hartnoll, Strathclyde's director of social work who
inherited this case from her predecessor, Professor Fred Edwards, said
yesterday that it was very difficult to decide if there really had been
abuse in this ''highly complicated case''.
''Even in today's judgement, Sheriff Miller has concluded that he
cannot 'with any certainty come to a view as to the truth of this whole
complex, complicated and disturbing case','' she said.
But she does admit that, in the light of current knowledge, the
investigations would have been done differently.
The department's involvement in the affair may not yet have ended. Now
that an officer has been appointed by the court to look after the
interests of the children, the process will now start of gradually
building up shattered, and in some cases, non-existent family
relationships.
Although the eldest of the eight children, a 15-year-old girl, has
maintained contact with her parents and was yesterday returned to their
care, some of the younger children do not know their parents at all. Two
are believed to have become so upset at the prospect of seeing their
mother again a couple of years ago that they threatened to run under a
bus.
Miss Hartnoll accepts that the parents will be suspicious of social
work involvement.
''But the children themselves may need help, and we will see what we
can do to arrange help that is acceptable to all concerned if they need
it,'' she said.
The children have reacted differently to their ordeal. Brothers and
sisters have been kept together to minimise disruption to their
relationships.
''The reports we have from schools suggest that they have done well,''
said Miss Hartnoll.
The social work department is anxious to place the case in context --
before the Orkney abuse scandal, but after the Cleveland report.
''But although Cleveland was referred to in Scottish Office guidance,
it was not formally taken forward in Scotland so it is not part of
Scottish guidelines,'' said Miss Hartnoll.
''This was one of the first cases where there was apparently multiple
abuse. Social workers were working in a difficult area without
guidelines specifically to help them. The judgment that has now been
made has been made with the benefit of hindsight,'' she said.
Since 1990, the department has developed its own practice guidelines
which were approved by the council in 1993. Miss Hartnoll says that in
the light of current knowledge and training, staff would now act
differently.
There have been two main programmes of training -- the first, jointly
with police, on investigative interviewing of children, and the second,
specifically for social workers, on the recording of evidence.
Care workers were criticised in the sheriff's report for their
recording of evidence while the children were in residential care.
But, said Miss Hartnoll, after Sheriff Gow's finding in August 1990
that there had been sexual abuse, care workers did not believe their job
was to collect evidence, as there had already been a finding of proof.
''Residential care staff's first job is looking after children. As
part of that, they do not write down everything that children say. The
normal pattern in a residential situation is that staff would recount at
the end of the day what had happened and record issues of significance.
After August, they were not doing that for the purpose of evidence, but
collecting observations of the children, perhaps for a children's
hearing,'' she said.
Miss Hartnoll admitted yesterday that Sheriff Miller's criticism of
her department was ''devastating''.
''I think the damage is wider than the department -- there is also
damage to social work. This problem happened five years ago over a short
period of time when we were at an early stage in understanding problems
of sexual abuse. It is unprecedented in my experience that there has
been any decision like this overturned five years later,'' she said.
''Social workers in their role of pursuing the interests of children
and in their duty to investigate were in the front line of these
investigations.
''There is no doubt now that with the increased knowledge of practice,
training, and the criticisms of other cases the interviewing would be
done differently,'' she said.
''If the staff concerned had had the benefit of that training, it
would have helped them enormously. But it is partly the fact that people
like them have tried to help children, tried to find out what has
happened to them, and have made the kind of mistakes that they have,
that has led us to improve both interviewing and recording,'' she added.

SHELL Expro was given the go-ahead yesterday for a #500m plan to
develop three North Sea oil fields -- Teal, Teal South, and Guillemot A
-- using a Floating Production Storage and Offtake (FPSO) facility.
The FPSO development will be the largest yet undertaken in the North
Sea.
Shell has so far awarded #300m of contracts for the development, with
more than half going to UK industry.
Mr Heinz Rothermund, managing director of Shell Expro, said: ''This is
the first time Shell Expro has adopted the FPSO approach for a full
field development in the central North Sea.
''The FPSO system will provide higher profitability than any
alternative options and offers the potential for the economic
development of other North Sea fields in the future.''
Energy Minister Tim Eggar said yesterday: ''This will add
significantly to domestic production of oil and gas.''
Combined reserves are estimated at approximately 90 million barrels of
oil and 45 billion cubic feet of gas. Production is scheduled to start
at the end of next year.
The FPSO will be a new turret-moored vessel with storage capacity of
about 850,000 barrels of oil.
Approval was also granted yesterday for the development of the
Phillips' Dawn Gas Field in the southern North Sea.

LORD Hope said that the removal of the children in the Ayrshire sex
abuse case was 'a tragedy of immense proportions.' BRUCE McKAIN, Law
Correspondent, reports on the study by Sheriff Colin Miller that
prompted the emotive remark from Scotland's most senior judge.
AFTER nearly five years, two major inquiries costing millions of
pounds and spanning 169 days, we are no nearer discovering whether eight
Ayrshire children were subjected to satanic sexual abuse.
In his 433-page judgment issued yesterday, Sheriff Colin Miller
expressed his frustration in concluding: ''I cannot with any certainty
come to a view as to the truth of this whole complex, complicated and
disturbing case.
''Evidence that might have filled the gap and eased the frustration
was not brought before me, but I can do no more than issue my findings
on the basis of what evidence I have seen and heard.''
He was referring in particular to the fact that Mrs F, the mother of
three of the children involved and the woman who sparked off the whole
inquiry, had not been called as a witness.
''Mrs F must be the key to the whole matter,'' he said.
The sheriff conceded the possibility that the children had in fact
been abused but damned the evidence put forward to back up the
allegations as ''ineptly collected and contaminated''.
His criticism of social workers, carers and police was tempered by his
acknowledgment that only the ''foot soldiers'' had appeared before him,
and none of the ''officers or higher ranks'' had explained their
position.
His basis for deciding that the four boys and four girls from three
families, aged from five to 15, should at last be allowed to return home
was that the Reporter for Strathclyde region had failed to prove the
existence of sexual abuse.
After hearing 152 days of evidence and four days of legal submissions,
Sheriff Miller issued a total of 57 different facts which he had found
proved, on a balance of probabilities.
The most important was number 57: ''None of the children has been
subjected to sexual or physical abuse.''
This was in stark contrast to the earlier findings of Sheriff Neil
Gow, QC, who ruled that the allegations of abuse had been proved. One
boy was said to have had the enamel prised off his teeth with scissors
and Sheriff Gow found that the most sinister aspect of the whole case,
suggesting elements of sadism, ritualism and torture.
Sheriff Miller has ruled that the child, now eight, was in fact
suffering from natural tooth decay.
He stated that it was not for him to comment on the findings of
Sheriff Gow (who gave evidence before Sheriff Miller), but was satisfied
that the information placed before him entitled and indeed obliged him
to reach a different decision.
The Court of Session referred the case to Sheriff Miller after the
parents claimed that additional medical and dental evidence and doubts
about the interviewing techniques adopted by social workers cast serious
doubt on Sheriff Gow's findings.
Sheriff Miller also found that:
* People who interviewed the children pursued one hypothesis to the
exclusion of all other possibilities.
* There was no medical evidence to support claims of physical or
sexual abuse of any of the children.
* The interviewing with the children was defective and excessive,
putting pressure on the children, with biased interviewers introducing
''facts'' as if they had come from the child.
* The methods and techniques of three particular care workers were so
inadequate that their hearsay evidence about what children had said or
done was worthless.
* The instuctions to care workers, social workers and police officers
with regard to the method and practice of recording interviews was
inadequate.
* Police constables involved lacked effective training.
* The experience, instruction and expertise of social workers and care
workers was inadequate.
* There was no joint planning of interviews or reviews of progress.
Sheriff Miller recounts how the whole saga began when Mrs F, the
mother of three of the children, found one of them lying in bed with his
pyjama trousers pulled down to expose his buttocks. This was after her
husband had fallen on the children's bed in a drunken state.
Mrs F reported her concerns to a GP in Ayr and repeated them to social
workers. She mentioned other people as being involved.
A case discussion was held at Ayr Social Work Department on May 29,
1990, and the word ''occult'' was used for the first time in connection
with the allegations.
By June, there was clear concern about satanic abuse being involved
and the first of the children were taken from their homes under place of
safety orders.
The three families whose children were taken into care are related and
most of them are travelling people.
Although she was the key to the whole case, Mrs F did not give
evidence before Sheriff Miller. The sheriff commented: ''She was never
brought forward as a witness. I know not why.
''From the evidence before me it is apparent that she is a very
important witness in this matter and I have not had the benefit of any
tested evidence from her, save insofar as I have hearsay of what she
said to Sheriff Gow.
''The absence of such evidence inevitably leaves a very large gap in
the whole story of this protracted saga.
''Why the Reporter did not call her in spite of her being on his list
of witnesses I know not. Why her own counsel did not call her to give
evidence I know not.
''I cannot speculate, but I have to observe that the absence of her
being available to be tested has considerably hampered my task in
determining where the truth of the matter lies.''
Sheriff Miller said it was easy, with hindsight, to be critical of
witnesses in the case. While the report into child sex abuse in
Cleveland had been published before 1990, most of the witnesses for the
Reporter who might have been expected to have knowledge of it did not,
or, if they did, failed to comply with its recommendations.
''I do not intend to be over-critical of the care workers or the
social workers for their ethos or credo as it was in 1990. It has been
recognised that the approach taken then towards the investigation of
child abuse cases was a flawed approach.
''Procedures and methods have been changed to obviate, so far as it is
humanly possible to do so, any of the difficulties which arose under the
former methods.
''Strathclyde Regional Council has recognised the change of direction
in the new guidelines in relation to sexual abuse cases, which date from
October 1993.
''The care workers and social workers who appeared before me were only
the foot soldiers. None of the officers or higher ranks appeared to
explain their position to me and these foot soldiers inevitably have
been left to be the butt of criticism.
''I do not seek to over-criticise them, save insofar as I have drawn
attention to the actings of those who in my view have gone beyond the
bounds of proper investigation and have strayed into the bounds of
impropriety in their dealings with and reporting the purported actings
and sayings of the children.
''I am also conscious that at the time in 1990 there is evidence to
the effect that there was a fashion to seek out sexual abuse, in
particular of a ritual or satanic nature.
''I am aware that nearly five years later the climate has reversed and
it is now fashionable to find there is nothing at all to justify
allegations of such a nature in the vast majority of cases.''
The sheriff said he had consistently kept in mind his duty to take a
balanced view and adopt neither of these positions, relying solely on
the evidence placed before him.
At the end of all the evidence, he was not satisfied that Strathclyde
Report had discharged the burden of establishing the allegations of
abuse, which had resulted in the children being taken into care and the
case referred to a Children's Hearing.
''If anything, the balance is either level, in which case the Reporter
fails, or tilted slightly towards the petitoners (the parents) in which
case the Reporter also fails.
''Suspicions and possibilities, even high possibilities, do not
translate into probabilities.''
Sheriff Miller referred to the evidence of one expert witness.
''I am left with the same feeling as that witness expressed to me from
her expert position that it is possible that this has been a case of
child sexual abuse.
''But any evidence of it has been so ineptly collected and so
contaminated for all the reasons I have accepted from the experts . . .
with the end result that it is not possible for me to conclude whether
or not the statements of fact which the Reporter prays in aid . . . have
been proved on a balance of probabilities.''

SHERIFF Colin Miller's judgment suggests that there is still no middle
ground in the controversy.
Either the children were systematically and regularly tortured in
front of adult witnesses -- or the tragic affair is a product of fevered
imaginations.
In 1992, Sheriff Neil Gow supported the children's panel decision to
take the four girls and four boys into care in 1990 when aged 10 months
to 11 years.
Sheriff Gow was satisfied an evil ring of vice was operating among
several families -- based on claims which amounted to extreme and
sadistic sexual abuse made by two of the eight children during
disclosure sessions with social workers.
In a 60-page judgment, he said some allegations were almost too
extraordinary to believe, but there was medical corroboration of some of
them.
He concluded there had been systematic sexual abuse and corruption of
the children by several male and female adults. In one incident
involving extreme sadism and the ritualistic abuse and torture of a
three-year-old, the sheriff said the child could have died of shock.
His judgment disclosed sex games at the root of allegations. They
included the white hat game which involved putting naked children in a
long narrow box, telling them to pretend to be dead.
A social worker related an account given to her by a child who spoke
of a three-year-old having teeth extracted with long scissors. The
sheriff said: ''This part of the case is so distressing and terrifying
that it is almost too extraordinary to be believed.''
But he went on to note that he found adequate corroboration for it in
the medical evidence he heard from Dr James Reid, a senior lecturer at
the Children's Dental Hospital, Glasgow, who said the crowns of two
molar teeth were lost -- ''highly unusual'' injuries which could have
resulted from a blow to the jaw or an instrument inserted and the crowns
levered off.
Other games included naked versions of hide and seek which culminated
with ''tickling'' of the children's private parts, and the ghost train
game in which children were made to sit in a box and pretend it was a
carriage. Adults were either naked or partly clothed and sometimes wore
costumes resembling skeletons.
The sheriff noted that during these games some of the children -- two
boys in particular -- were given ''wee white tablets'' and a white
powder which was put in their soft drinks. The substances made the boys
''feel good''.
While in the care unit, two of the boys showed aspects of sexual
precocity. A five-year-old openly masturbated in front of one woman
social worker while a three-year-old tried to put his hand up her skirt
and suck her breasts.
Medical examinations of two girls aged 10 and eight, carried out at
the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Yorkhill, Glasgow, appeared to
confirm sexual abuse. The eight-year-old, the medical report stated,
could have been abused for a year or more.
Sheriff Gow heard 11 days of evidence behind closed doors in a case
brought by the Reporter for Strathclyde Regional Council. He concluded:
''I am bound to say that in the whole of my professional life, covering
33 years in practice as an advocate and 15 years on the bench, I have
never come across a case so distressing and appalling as this.''

A SMALL Scottish district council yesterday staked its claim to have
the lowest council rents in Britain.
Midlothian, based in Dalkeith, also believes that in 1995-96 it will
have the lowest rents in Scotland for the sixth year running.
It has opted for a rents freeze for 1995-96, leaving its average
weekly charge at #21.08p a week, #10.50p lower than the Scottish
average.
Councillor Sam Campbell, the housing services committee's Labour
chairman, insisted that, despite the low charges, the council had always
appreciated the need for continued investment in its housing stock of
8700 homes.
He claimed Midlothian had set standards for others to follow by
completing modernisation programmes and introducing home improvement
schemes offering unique levels of tenant choice.
Midlothian's 1995-96 average rent of #21.08p compares with a figure of
#21.46p set for 1994-95 by Angus District Council.

THE award of a #15,000, three-month contract to a former Labour leader
of Lothian Regional Council, to research poverty, was yesterday attacked
as ''a prime example of jobs for the boys''.
Councillor Tom Ponton, leader of the opposition Tory group, criticised
the appointment by the local authority of Mr John Mulvey, its leader up
to 1990, to develop a poverty forum for the region.
He said Mr Mulvey's selection had never been put publicly to
councillors and had been made privately by senior officials. His tender
was #3000 more expensive than the lowest of three tenders.
Mr Mulvey had since made his first report and recommended the council
should set up a poverty forum at a cost of #47,000.
Councillor Keith Geddes, leader of Lothian's Labour administration,
said last night: ''Everything is above board.''
He was satisfied all had been done properly and the appointment had
been made of someone who had a first-class record in his subject.
Councillor Geddes said there had been no instruction to take the
lowest tender. Mr Mulvey's bid was the lowest in terms of his
consultancy fee -- #9500 -- and the balance was for administration and
organisation of the forum.
Mr Mulvey said last night that, in practice, his work on the contract
would last four months instead of three, so his return would be less
than the #5000 a month which was being claimed.

UNIONS representing 34,000 employees of the textile and clothing
multi-national Coats Viyella have negotiated a European works council
agreement, the first within the European textile industry and only the
second such agreement in the UK.
The first, last November, involved unions and United Biscuits which,
in common with Coats Viyella, has extensive Scottish interests and
several thousand employees. There are many more in various degrees of
negotiation. A new study suggests that up to 326 UK-based companies may
have to establish works councils to inform and consult their employees.
Under the EU works council directive which came into force last
September, companies employing more than 1000 workers and more than 150
in at least two EU members states must set up works councils by
September 1996 or face having them imposed.
An increasing number of British companies are realising that the UK
Government's ''opt out'' of the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty
provides no protection from this obligation and are entering into
negotiations with their unions.
Mr Peter Booth, national textile group secretary of the Transport and
General Workers Union, said yesterday that the agreement was the
culmination of nine months' of negotiations with Coats Viyella. The
company and the TGWU had already signed and the other main UK unions
would do so today.

<HEADLINE>Campaign intensifies for more research in to illnesses blamed on Gulf War innoculations Veterans voice chorus of complaint</HEADLINE>

GULF War veterans yesterday stepped up their campaign for more
research into the cause of illnesses which have blighted their lives
since the end of the conflict.
They queued at a packed Westminister press conference to describe how
their health had deteriorated since they were innoculated before the
conflict.
Backed by the British Legion, they are campaigning for more Government
research into the after effects, dubbed by some ''Gulf War syndrome''.
Mr Richard Turnball, 43, who supervised the construction of warfare
shelters, said he has had 24 infections, including anthrax, meningitis,
and whooping cough, since being given two batches of innoculations.
He said he became ill within 20 minutes of the first set and was given
two paracetamol by an orderly, who told him the symptoms would clear up
after a couple of hours.
''They never did,'' said Mr Turnball, of Deeside, North Wales.
He said he now suffers from shortness of breath, extreme fatigue,
memory loss, coughing, bouts of lethargy, and irrational mood swings.
Mr Ian Hill, 48, a retired major who served as a nurse, said he took
nerve agent protection tablets during the conflict.
He was sent home with bronchial pneumonia and said he now has
extremely poor memory, explosive temper outbursts, permanent headaches,
and pain behind the eyes.
Describing how he was given a large number of innoculations, including
those against anthrax, meningitis, and whooping cough, he rejected a
suggestion that servicemen and women had been able to choose whether to
take them.
Mr Ben Gunn, 47, who was called up as a nurse and now suffers mental
health, bowel, and urinary problems, claimed there had been a cover-up
by the authorities.
''There is hush-hush for some unknown reason,'' he claimed.
Mrs Edwina Currie, Tory MP for Derbyshire South, who chaired the press
conference, called on the Ministry of Defence to collect and analyse
details about illnesses in the wake of the war.
Meanwhile, ex-servicewomen who claim they suffered a premature
menopause because of ''Gulf War syndrome'' are calling for an inquiry.
They claim their condition is linked to anti-chemical warfare drugs
and vaccinations they were given while serving in the front line.
The women -- whose allegations are denied by the Ministry of Defence
-- lobbied Parliament yesterday.
Ms Ann Simpson, 33, a nurse who worked at a field hospital during the
Gulf War, suspects her condition is linked to a vaccination given to
British forces but reportedly withdrawn from American troops.
She was told she would never have another child because she had her
menopause 20 years early.
In an interview with GMTV, she said: ''There were absolutely no
warnings about any possible side effects of these drugs. In the Army,
you just think the injections you are given are going to protect you.
''I just want to have another baby and it is heart-breaking that that
choice has been taken away from me.''
Dr Val Godfree, director of the Amarant Trust menopause clinic, backed
the women's call for an investigation.
She said: ''Early menopause affects about one in a hundred women in
the general population.
''Certainly there is a link between toxic agents and early menopause,
any exposure to toxic agents in a war situation does need further
investigation.''
However, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said there was no evidence of
a link between the women's condition and the Gulf War.

FIGURES released yesterday confirm that, despite the best efforts of
politicians and planners, Glasgow still suffers major deprivation,
poverty, and decay.
A study by the Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde University
reveals that the city's high-profile rebirth since the 80s did not reach
the city's poor -- and claims that people from outwith Glasgow grabbed
the lion's share of new jobs.
The revelations touched a raw nerve with council and development
agency leaders, who have spent the past decade trying to reverse
Glasgow's negative image through major international events, including
the garden festival and City of Culture celebrations.
Councillor Pat Lally, leader of Glasgow District Council, said: ''This
doesn't tell us anything we didn't already know. We all know there are
substantial problems and are doing what we can.
''What we have never been prepared to accept is that if a thing is not
going to benefit everybody it is not worth doing at all.
''It is also simply not true to say the city was made more attractive
and successful only for some people. That can't possibly be true.
''If the city was made more attractive, it has been made more
attractive for everybody.
''As for jobs going to people outwith the city, the people who live in
Eastwood, Bearsden, and Milngavie work and play in Glasgow but live just
across the boundary and don't count for these figures. We have been
arguing for years for a larger Glasgow.''
Mr Jim Stevens, chief economic forecaster for the institute and the
report's author, was at pains to point out yesterday that the position
would have been much worse without the Garden Festival, Year of Culture,
and the rejuvenation of businesses and hotels.
However, he said future developments must make efforts to include
people at the lowest levels of society.
He added: ''The fact is that considerable numbers of people in Glasgow
have been left behind and are unable to take part.
''They are not getting on the first rung of the ladder.''
Mr Stevens's report, based on census figures from 1981 and 1991, was
prepared for Glasgow Development Agency.
A GDA spokesman said: ''Obviously, the comparisons make for
interesting reading and give a clear indication of the kind of problems
the agency faced when it came into existence in 1991, coincidentally the
end point for this particular set of figures.
''Our own draft Strategy Document, which has gone out for consultation
to a wide range of public and private organisations, recognises that
Glasgow has problems and clearly sets out ways in which the agency, as
the principal agent for economic regeneration in Glasgow is improving
the situation.''

A CAMPAIGN to crack down on vehicles causing excessive pollution was
launched yesterday by the Government.
Transport Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney announced a series of measures,
including fines of up to #2500 for offenders, which will be applied
throughout the UK.
Over the next two months, police and vehicle inspectors will carry out
checks in 23 cities and towns, including some in Scotland.
Dr Mawhinney said: ''Motorists will get no advance notice. Roadside
checkpoints manned by the police and the Vehicle Inspectorate will pull
offending vehicles to one side.
''Vehicles which are in serious breach of the limits will face an
immediate ban from the road and the owners of vehicles which have not
been properly serviced will be prosecuted.''
Other measures include:
* Tighter MoT test emission standards planned to come in in January
1996 will be brought into effect in September this year;
* Fines of up to #2500 for offending vehicles;
* Automatic prosecution for motorists and operators who exceed limits
by neglecting vehicle maintenance;
* An urgent study into the possibility of roadside checks to spot
engines which burn too much oil.
A pre-Christmas roadside check of 5200 vehicles in nine cities showed
that light goods vehicles and taxis were the worst polluters, followed
by private cars.
Dr Mawhinney said these types of vehicles would be particularly
targeted in the new measures but lorries, buses, and coaches would not
be excluded.
The new MoT regulations will call for a 20-25% reduction in standard
carbon monoxide emissions. The initiative will also halve the period of
grace for owners of offending vehicles, who will now have only 14 days
instead of 28 days to take remedial action.
Dr Richard Dixon, head of research for Friends of the Earth Scotland,
yesterday welcomed the measures but warned that the Transport Secretary
must also address the fundamental issue of road-building and the problem
of too much traffic.
''If this is the Government's attempt to address the issue of
transport and the environment, then it is not going far enough,'' said
Dr Dixon.
A spokesman for the RAC also welcomed the announcement.
''We have done a lot of research in the past and it is a minority of
vehicles that cause the majority of pollution -- 10% of vehicles cause
50% of pollution. We welcome the fact that these vehicles will be a
target. It can also be taxis, buses, and lorries that are the offending
vehicles and Dr Mawhinney has recognised that, which is a step in the
right direction.
''We just hope that the resources are there to make sure that these
tests can be carried out. The vast majority of sensible motorists have
absolutely nothing to fear from these measures. If your car is regularly
serviced it will not be pumping out illegal emissions,'' he said.
The initiative is part of Dr Mawhinney's attempt to adopt a greener
approach to transport policies. It follows calls for less-pollutive
vehicles, made in the report of the Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution last year.

FOUR workers and a firefighter were taken to hospital yesterday after
inhaling fumes when a chemical experiment went wrong at a Borders
spinning mill.
Fumes from two tanks of chlorine and sodium chlorite started to react
in the extraction system of the dying room at Clough Mill, Waverley
Road, Innerleithen.
As the reaction intensified, staff were unable to get to the tanks in
order to empty them into the mill's neutralising system.
The mill, which employs 60 people, was evacuated for five hours as
firefighting units from Edinburgh, Galashiels, Innerleithen, and Peebles
attended the scene. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus finally
reached the tanks and opened the stop taps.
The chief dyer, two members of his staff, and a firefighter were taken
to Borders General Hospital but later allowed away.
One member of the mill's safety team, who tried to tackle the
emergency in its early stages, was being detained in hospital overnight
for observation.
The mill's managing director, Mr Peter Fuchs, said yesterday: ''We
still don't know exactly why this happened. We were about to try a new
bleaching process when the fumes started to react. This was a one off
and I don't think we will be trying it again.''
Safety Inspectorate officials will be carrying out their own
investigation.

THE son of a convicted murderer yesterday admitted the savage killing
and sexual mutilation of an elderly couple against whom he bore a
grudge.
Milton Wheeler, 24, denied murdering 82-year-old Mr Madhavji Ambasna
and his wife Raliat, 72, last April, but admitted manslaughter on the
grounds of diminished responsibility.
He also admitted the rape and indecent assault of two girls he forced
at knifepoint to the flat where the bodies lay.
Mr John Nutting, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey that the pleas were
acceptable because three doctors agreed on Wheeler's psychopathic
disorder and ''his significant degree of sexual sadism''.
Wheeler sat expressionless as Mr Nutting described how he repeatedly
stabbed the couple then mutilated them with a Stanley knife.
Wheeler, who will be sentenced today, was born in Lancashire and his
family name was Gainford.
He changed it to Wheeler in 1988 after he was convicted of attempting
to rape a young woman.
He was detained for four years. During his sentence, signs of
psychotic illness were first spotted but, after his release, he
''defaulted from treatment''.
Mr Nutting said that, when Wheeler was six, his father, Russell
Gainford, was jailed for life for murdering a 77-year-old woman. His son
was taken into care three years later.
The court heard how Wheeler had lived in a flat opposite the elderly
couple in Hounslow, west London.
He was later to tell a cellmate how he intended to ''wreak vengeance
on Mrs Ambasna for having the cheek to suggest he had stolen some
milk'', said Mr Nutting.
Wheeler recounted to his cellmate how he killed Mr and Mrs Ambasna.
He also sexually mutilated their bodies before leaving the flat,
taking jewellery and cash.
That evening, he met two girls aged 14 and 18, lured them to a
friend's house nearby, and locked them in.
He raped the 14-year-old and then forced her to commit an indecent
act.
Wheeler then forced the terrified girls at knifepoint to his friend's
flat opposite the Ambasna's home, where he committed further indecent
assaults on both of them.
After taking their money, he forced the pair to walk naked across the
landing into the Ambasna's flat.
As they went inside, the 14-year-old saw the dead man's body.
He tied the girls to separate beds and said he planned to kill one of
them.
Before leaving, Wheeler bit both girls so hard that he left
identifiable teeth marks on their bodies.
Once he had gone, the younger girl managed to free herself and seek
help. Wheeler was arrested when he returned to the scene two hours
later.
Mr Nutting said three psychiatrists agreed Wheeler presented a grave
danger to the public. Doctors also agreed that his personality disorder
was so severe that it reduced his responsibility for his actions.

RELATIONS between Highland Regional Council and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise appear to be deteriorating rapidly, with each viewing the
other's activities with increasing suspicion.
Yesterday, a senior councillor, Dr Michael Foxley (Lochaber), called
for HIE and its local enterprise network to open up their books, hold
their meetings in public, and publish their minutes.
Earlier, parliamentary questions were tabled by the Inverness, Nairn,
and Lochaber MP, Sir Russell Johnston, on persistent speculation that
HIE has a multi-million pound underspend in its budget this year.
Dr Foxley said: ''The easy way for HIE and the Lecs to dispel rumours
of their massive underspend is to do what the regional council does
every month -- publish how much they are spending.''
He said more and more money was falling into the hands of quangos and
the public were less and less aware how their money was being spent.
His comments were dismissed last night by HIE as ''election-time
statements'' and ''simply nonsense''. A spokesman said: ''The HIE
network is committed to maximum accountability to the taxpayer. Uniquely
in Scotland, our local enterprise companies publish monthly lists of
financial assistance approved through their development programmes.
''As a Lochaber councillor, Dr Foxley should know this. He receives
such a list from his own Lec, Lochaber Ltd, every four weeks.''
The issue which has ostensibly brought this to a head is whether HIE,
with a core function to develop the infrastructure for learning and
training, should bail out the Jobs Enterprise and Training (Jet) scheme,
which has received #1.4m from the council.
Jet employs 110 and caters for 1000 trainees but the council is having
to make savings of #12.9m to avoid being capped.
Senior HIE officials have suggested on more than one occasion that the
council should continue to fund Jet and instead make #1m plus savings by
abandoning its economic development brief.
The region's development function appears to irritate HIE at times.
Indeed, in its submission to the Scottish Office in February 1993 on
local government reform, the agency argued that councils should
sub-contract development to local enterprise companies.

Music
THE closing five minutes of John Maxwell Geddes's Oboe Concerto,
premiered on Sunday night, contain the most ravishing music ever written
by the composer.
The entire concerto, exquisitely performed by its dedicatee, Jonathan
Small, is intoxicating to the ear and fascinating to unravel. Through a
variety of shifting orchestral landscapes, Geddes's soloist picks a
solitary course. Essentially a lonely voice, the oboe is occasionally
buffeted by surrounding orchestral activity, but always reverts to its
introspective, expressive, long-breathed musings. It's a metaphor:
ultimately we are alone.
Then, towards the end, after some dramatic activity, the music shifts
skywards and the shimmering starscape to which the composer refers
begins to emerge -- magically glinting effects on vibes and strings,
underpinned by rich, soft, tonal chords on brass -- and the soloist
spirals heavenwards. A gloriously crafted, eye-dampening composition,
spellbindingly played by Jonathan Small with sensitive accompaniment by
Paragon and conductor David Davies.
The new work was surrounded by a feast of Scottish concertos, Judith
Weir's brilliantly conceived Several Concertos, dashingly played by
Philip Norris (cello) Alison Mitchell (piano) and the ever-impressive
Lynda Cochrane (piano) and Thomas Wilson's Chamber Concerto, an
imaginative study in stasis and energy.
The only non-concerto in this first-rate programme was John Maxwell
Geddes's superior Cello Sonata, a big-boned and eloquent work whose
contrasts of stateliness and dramatic activity were clearly defined in a
commanding performance by Philip Norris and Lynda Cochrane. All good
stuff, but oh, let us hear that Oboe Concerto again soon.

BASEL is sorely in need of Walter Weller. This dreary town on the
northern edge of Switzerland has persuaded the Royal Scottish National
Orchestra's principal conductor to take charge of its orchestra and
opera house, and about time too. With any luck Weller should inject a
bit of life into the place.
No, I was not influenced by the unceasing rain, high prices, and empty
streets. Switzerland's popularity with bankers is no coincidence. And
for all its claims to medieval charm, Basel is the sort of soulless
Legoland that could do with an extra-large dose of the kind of
exuberance and vitality Weller specialises in.
On Friday night le tout Basel turned out for Walter Weller's debut as
Basel Theatre's music director with a production of Richard Strauss and
Hugo von Hofmannsthal's Die frau ohne schatten. Strauss may be popular
but this is not a widely known opera. Its great strength is in the
score, but it is a highly demanding piece, offering both a challenge to
Weller and a chance to show off what he can do with an excellent
orchestra.
He has tackled it with firmness, and it shows. The sound coming out of
the pit on Friday was controlled. None of the detail was lost, and the
volume never overwhelmed the hall or the singers. Afterwards, Weller
admitted it was an intimidating first project: ''This is the biggest
piece, the hardest one. It is a force in our life. It was for me a great
force with which to start my stay here, the most difficult piece for us
in the world.''
Die frau ohne schatten is an odd opera. The title translates as ''the
woman without a shadow''. At a touch over four hours, albeit with two
intervals, this is a long piece. The score requires a furious commitment
from all sections of a big orchestra. Weller calls it musically extreme.
Its weakness is the bizarre, tortured, and to my mind at least, largely
unappealing plot.
The opening premise is one of those non sequiturs which make a lousy
foundation for a story. The daughter of the King of Spirits,
masquerading as a gazelle, is seduced by the Emperor of the Southeastern
Isles. She hasn't got a shadow, which means she can't have children.
Then it gets complicated.
Director Hans Peter Lehmann's production is bitty, its overworked
modernism too inconsistent with the story's fantastical theme. There is
too much of a 1970s East German feel to the sets, big angular structures
in a bureaucratically inspired world of glass and mirrors. The costumes
look as if they were designed by a committee (Canadian tenor Alan
Woodrow as the Emperor looks particularly silly in a shell-suit kimono
and sweatband, like a Samurai on his way to an aerobics class).
The singing is uniformly good, but little of it stands out. The
much-heralded Vera Baniewicz, a Polish mezzo protegee of Weller's,
doesn't quite gel in the role. Though powerful, her voice fails to match
the emotion coming from the orchestra. Her manic gesturing suggests that
a session or two with a movement coach might not go amiss. A strong
Vivian Tierney and a confident, rich-sounding Pavlo Hunka as her
dyer-husband Barak, provide the only credible emotional tension between
characters.
Weller stresses that his new relationship with Basel in no way
threatens his commitment to Scotland. ''For me Scotland is a very old
love. Nobody can break it.'' Basel, however, has given him an enormously
powerful position, consolidating the artistic control of three different
fiefdoms and orchestras into his hands.
''The best thing was to make a general music director for
everything,'' he says, which means he is general director of the opera
house, artistic director of Basel's Allgemeine Musikgesellschaft, and
principal conductor of the Basel Symphony Orchestra. All of it is funded
by the city to the tune of #25m a year. Not enough for Pavarotti, he
says, but enough to develop budding talents from the East. Basel, after
all, is where the likes of Van Otter and Caballe made their debuts.
He is committed to two productions a year in Basel. Next season will
open with The Magic Flute. After that there are plans for big projects,
including Wagner and a possible Ring. In April the RSNO will tour
Switzerland and Weller will lead it in Basel. It is fair to hope that in
exchange Scotland will soon have a chance to hear and see some of the
excitement Weller is injecting into this city.

Mark Fisher considers the plight of children's theatre and sees some
hopeful signs for the future.
IF I told you that one of the most internationally successful Scottish
theatre companies of recent years was Visible Fictions, you could be
forgiven for looking blank. For while we're very good at keeping track
of any number of grown-up companies, we have a terrible tendency to
overlook the work of specialists in children's theatre. And that's why
Visible Fictions is not a household name.
Visible Fictions might be Scotland's leading children's theatre
company but children's theatre, we generally assume, cannot be worthy of
serious attention.
If this is indeed the way we feel, then our thinking is woefully
behind that of audiences and practitioners elsewhere. In Canada, for
example, it's not unknown for a children's company to spend 18 months
developing a show, while in Russia anyone wanting to work in children's
theatre has to round off a five-year stint at drama school with another
two years of specialist training.
Here, theatre for children is too often the poor relation, but with
the ever more ambitious work of TAG Theatre Company, the advent in 1990
of the Scottish International Children's Festival (which last year alone
played to an audience of 35,000 -- considerably more than a sell-out
week at the Edinburgh Playhouse), and the announcement of several new
initiatives at the MacRobert Arts Centre, Stirling, things are starting
to look more healthy.
The Scottish Arts Council made a particular effort to increase its
support of work for young people in its recent round of grant
allocations. With more than #168,000 to spend in the next financial
year, TAG is at the head of the brat pack, being Scotland's only
revenue-funded company for young people, but the SAC made important
gestures to both Visible Fictions and the Children's Festival by
promising them minimum levels of funding for the next three years. At
#25,000 and #30,000 respectively, these figures do not represent massive
amounts or significant increases, but the certainty of longer-term
funding will play a crucial role in their ability to plan ahead.
Arguably more significant for Visible Fictions is the company's recent
relocation from Glasgow to the MacRobert Arts Centre. Although no money
will change hands, the deal provides the company with office and
rehearsal space plus the administrative back-up of an established arts
organisation. It's all part of a concerted move by the MacRobert to
become more closely involved in production and to provide a bigger
service to young audiences.
''We have a commitment to provide higher quality children's theatre,''
says Liz Moran, the MacRobert's artistic director. ''The product that is
available in Scotland is not great and we identified Visible Fictions as
a company that is excellent and has great potential.''
Other developments at the MacRobert include the appointment of Ann
Wood, previously of the Citizens' and TAG, as a drama
artist-in-residence with a remit to produce work with and for young
people. A youth theatre and children's theatre company are to follow
shortly and, with the help of Visible Fictions, there are plans afoot
for a youth project involving a Danish theatre director and the tales of
Hans Christian Andersen.
''Rather than just being a touring venue we're trying to encourage
more creation within the building,'' says Moran, who believes strongly
that the status of children's theatre needs to be raised. ''That's why
we're collaborating with countries such as Denmark, where it has a very
high status. We want to present work such as Stuart Paterson's which is
not patronising to children, and to encourage more people to write and
perform for children.''
For Visible Fictions, an increasingly secure footing will allow it to
pitch its work more precisely at its target audience. The company has
always refused to play to a whole school at once, recognising that what
appeals to a seven-year-old is not the same as what appeals to a
13-year-old, but now it can afford more time to develop shows in
consultation with the children it is aiming at.
''We try to work in an artistic group that includes a writer, a
designer, and the core members of Visible Fictions,'' says administrator
Tony Reekie, explaining that the next show, Giant Steps, a
rites-of-passage drama devised in conjunction with playwright Stephen
Greenhorn, has been in development since last October and won't be
produced until May.
''We workshop a piece with schoolchildren and then build it up from
that. That doesn't fit in with your three-week rehearsal period, just
slapping something on. We wanted to tie in with an organisation that
could offer us support in terms of administration, marketing and
sponsorship, and let us concentrate more on producing the work.''
The company is already cementing stronger ties with teachers in the
Stirling area, but its new location should not affect its national and
international ambitions. ''We certainly don't want to lose the
opportunity to practice our work abroad,'' says Reekie.
''That's simply because it gives us the chance to work with the best
people in children's theatre. In Scotland we are still fairly limited in
the amount of children's work that is going on and we have a huge amount
to learn. The best places to learn are abroad. Some of the best work
I've seen over the past couple of years has been at the Edinburgh
Children's Festival from places like Italy and Canada -- you go beyond
the realms of saying this is good children's theatre, it's just great
theatre.''

Comedy
HER physical appearance having been dramatically re-shaped and
re-modelled, Lynn Ferguson has chosen to re-route the entire course of
her stand-up career, too. There seemed less of Lynn in a corporeal sense
on Sunday night -- not, I hasten to add in an anti-sizeist caveat, that
there was ever too much of her.
What there often was too much of, however, was a brutal aggression at
the core of Lynn's on-stage persona, an urge to shock for shock's sake.
This confrontational quality has been modified. Softened fizzog-wise by
a fetching fringe, Lynn has similarly made her performance more relaxed
and user-friendly, becoming a chattily-amiable story-teller.
Suddenly Lynn is winning over an audience through transparent
reasonableness rather than bludgeoning them into submission.
Some of Lynn's material hasn't quite been fully teased out to its
illogical, and therefore funniest conclusion. Neither as yet does she
have enough material. But by the time her Edinburgh Fringe solo show
comes round in August, you should wager a few crates of Perrier on her
success in the comedy stakes.
Sunday's show, the first in a new Tron season, was nimbly compered by
the ever-improving Kenny Harris. In support, Jill Peacock seemed undone
by nerves, but her gnomic bad-taste poetry still possessed a gruesome
allure.

THE latest funding boost to children's theatre is announced today -- a
#10,000 commission for a new piece of work funded by the Bank of
Scotland and to be staged at the 1996 Scottish International Children's
Festival in Edinburgh.
The Bank of Scotland Young People's Theatre Award is part of the
bank's celebrations of its tercentenary and of a total of #30,000 of
sponsorship of the festival. It is the first award of its kind in
Britain and is open to Scottish companies specialising in work for young
people. They are invited to submit proposals for a new piece of work
before April 5.
Mr Eric Scott, the bank's sponsorship manager, said: ''We know that
there is a lot of good quality theatre for children, but there is still
a need for new works and new companies.''
Among the international companies in this year's festival programme
are the Quebecois Theatre Sans Fils, whose Clown of Destiny is a
co-production with the festival and tours (with Bank of Scotland
support) to Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen, and Stirling immediately after
the festival.
The MacRobert Arts Centre's programme also includes Australia's
Victoria State Opera with the ''cybergraphic opera'' Software, and TAG
Theatre Company's The Magic Island, an adaptation of The Tempest by Liz
Lochhead.

THE Compagnia d'Opera Italiana di Milano is not the same as La Scala.
It is an unsubsidised touring company that claims to have given 2500
performances in 12 European countries in 46 years without a
cancellation. In Glasgow last night it added to its achievement with a
Tosca of which the Carl Rosa might have been proud, even if the
accompanying Hungarian Symphonic Orchestra of Budapest was a bit small.
With no fewer than five Toscas and five Scarpias listed in the
programme, you could see why performances are never cancelled. Manami
Hama, yesterday's choice, seemed an omni-purpose Puccini soprano, but
rose to the title-role, though the Scarpia (Piero Marin) and Cavaradossi
(Constantin Nico) sounded never so good as they looked.
Still, as touring Toscas go, it was all quite presentable in an
old-fashioned sort of way..
Tamas Bolberitz, who conducted, seemed intent on making his handful of
players sound as loud as possible, which was a pity, but on the whole it
was an evening that justified the company's simple aim, which is to
bring budget opera of acceptable standard to the people.

ANY day now they're going to slap a new photo on top of this column.
Sharp readers will already have noticed the demise of Smug-Know-It-All,
the knowing and bewaistcoated image of moi which had adorned this slot
for some three years. Instead there has been a return (by unpopular
demand) of Smarmy Git, a cocky and besuited snap done a long time ago,
as I waltzed out of a convivial luncheon laden with press awards.
Smarmy Git is not popular at this address. So pressure has been
brought to bear on the due authorities to give me a new image. And a
very nice man turned up at my doorstep, three weeks ago, to recapture my
chiselled features for all you dear readers.
So I brushed my teeth. I polished my glasses. I donned a heavy jersey
and tried to look rugged. Some 20 frames later, and just as my
fashionable skull was beginning to give me a headache, he finished and
left.
But the weeks have gone by. One Tuesday and two Tuesdays, and Smarmy
Git beams on, replete with crinkled chin and Chinese suit. Something is
wrong, terribly wrong. All duty editors are unavailable for comment. And
then it hit me. Can it be that I look . . . balder?
You see, dear fans, part of my role in Herald mystique is this careful
image of reckless youth. I am not yet 30. I scarcely remember Watergate,
Labour governments, punk rock, old money, student grants, or John Toye.
And yet I am losing my hair. In handfuls.
This cruel fate of genetics I blame on my mother's father. My own
father, creaking towards a stately 55, is disgustingly hirsute. His
heavy silver locks shine tauntingly in the lights as he leads his three
blushing, mortified, bare-pated sprogs into church of a Sabbath.
My mother's father was bald, if comely, from an early age. Likewise I.
These youthful locks were visibly thinning when I was 19. I had a pink,
clean top by the time I was 23. Over the past five years, its acreage
has grown. Meantime, two other bald patches have formed above my
temples. They are now rushing happily inwards, all poised -- like
Channel tunnellers -- for a ceremonial handshake in the middle by the
end of 1996.
There was a day when this grievous phenomenon could be ignored. (Until
security video camera became universal in banks, and you couldn't cash a
cheque without being haunted for nights after by the image of your naked
dome on the monitor.)
There was a day when the situation could be kept under control.
Parting my surviving hair on the left covered the outrage for some time.
Then, as this became less fashionable than forlorn, I tried a centre
parting, a la early Brian Wilson. But there ain't no hair to part no
more.
I must say, to my credit, that I never succumbed to the temptation of
professional intervention. A hair transplant was out -- I hate needles.
I hate Elton John even more. A hair weave, of the sort you used to see
advertised in the back of cheap papers, was both expensive and gross.
Where I come from, you make tweed on looms, not brain boxes.
Regaine is a much-hyped hair restorative based on high-blood-pressure
medication. My blood pressure rocketed when I saw the price. And a wig
was out. I know a good man in Lewis who lost all his hair early in life
and promptly invested in a bright red wig that seemed to be made from
polyester. The trouble is, he is now 85, and still wearing a bright red
wig made from polyester.
There is only one way to cope with depleted glory. A policy of total,
in-your-face defiance. If you've got it, flaunt it. So these days I cut
my surviving hair as short as possible, embalm it in shiny gel, and comb
the lot backwards.
Until now. The new photo. The shame of it. I can see them gathered in
a room, aghast editors, trying to identify this new huge gleaming
Churchillian head. I can hear their sympathetic sighs. Doubtless their
minds wrestle with that terrible dilemma: how do they tell me?
The new photo has died. No doubt it is locked in a special safe with a
large file containing sexy crits of royalty and Cabinet ministers.
No-one must ever know that my youth is no more. That my hair has gone
the way of Jack McLean's hat.
Smarmy Git writes again. I am off to sob on Brian Meek's shoulder.

THIS talk of spies revives memories of Misha. We met at the Soda
Fountain in Fortnum &amp; Mason -- the year is immaterial now. He was
wearing a loden coat bought in Berlin, he said. I was the one in the
fedora. Misha had expensive tastes that did not run to cigarettes. Out
of some warped sentiment for communism he smoked those preposterous
Russian weeds which seemed to be fragranced with the congealed body
odours of a work camp.
He was skinny and ashen-faced with the look of an unlucky whippet. A
man with the beaten air of unfriendly domesticity about him. His wife,
he muttered, had not taken to London: too much traffic, not enough
bortsch, so she stayed in the kitchen all day slaving over nothing,
stirring her anger to keep it warm.
We didn't talk about espionage, of course, and on each of our meetings
there was no real reason to believe Misha was a spy. He was simply the
delegated Russian organising details of my forthcoming assignment in
Moscow. In his office at the top of a steep South Kensington house, he
lived surrounded by pamphlets and boxes containing the once-sacred texts
of international communism, and now he was throwing himself into a grand
and futile engagement with glasnost. ''I cannot understand it,'' he
would moan. ''I take people to lunch, I buy them alcohol, and in return
they tell me nothing. In this new climate of openness the British are
not being helpful.''
That, I suppose, was the clue. Not finding the quiver of treachery he
needed in the small patter of acquaintance, Misha, locked in the low
ranks of the KGB, went on the prowl. He travelled the country addressing
groups of agitated old commies on the merits of perestroika while
activating a little industrial espionage on the quiet. He came to
Glasgow once, appearing in the office like a small-town detective,
drawing on his cigarettes as if they were the opium of boredom. ''Yes,
yes, yes; if you insist I will visit the Burrell,'' he said during
lunch. ''But only for half an hour . . .''
There was something almost quarrelsome about him although he spoke
like a ventriloquist, the words clicking in the back of his throat, the
lips only moving to exhale. ''Afterwards,'' he said in a manner that
would brook no contradiction, ''I shall wander alone through your
beautiful city to see what I can see.'' The day's driving rain did not
deter him. Misha was all set to disappear in his blur of smoke.
And that was it, really. The trip to Moscow was perfectly and
legitimately arranged. But six months later Misha was among a batch of
Russians evicted from Britain for espionage. On television that night we
caught a glimpse of him at the airport. Paler than ever, he had a woman
on his arm, whose sullen gaze confirmed this must have been his wife. He
was going home and not even that appeared to please her. Perhaps
something terrible lay ahead. Would Misha now be lost from view
entirely? How do you tell what happens to people who are never in the
phone book?
It is a funny thing, secrecy. Very often it hides absolutely nothing
but a talent to conceal the cold desolation of an empty life. Yet, just
when you begin to believe that there can't be too much left to leak, up
sidles one more individual disclosing furtively from the side of his
mouth that he thinks he is being followed. Of course, the days and
nights when spies appeared dingier than a private eye's raincoat, walked
with a limp, and had one finger missing are over.
Even in Moscow before communism's fall, the KGB's flat-foot heavies
were already being edged aside by agents as suave as Gorbachev himself.
This immaculate breed now forms one strand in Russia's new millionaire
elite, having long ago lined its pockets with fat pickings from a
corrupt ideology.
The fact is steel in the soul and the will to kill are one thing but
an effective agent today must be armed with all-round couth; manicured
fingernails, the kind of short, meticulous haircut which requires a trip
to the barber every week, and absolutely no trace of halitosis . . .
These are the new attributes of the perfect spy. As they say, a really
good traitor never gets too friendly but that should not mean he stints
on dental floss.
It was probably in the execution of such delicate habits that Misha
failed. But only 18 months ago a strange thing happened at Heathrow. I
was in Terminal Two and suddenly there at the Aeroflot desk was Misha
standing next to a man built with so many muscles he seemed to have half
a dozen lemons down each sleeve. ''Misha,'' I pried, ''what are you
doing here?'' He looked at me with expressionless eyes and said: ''I am
not Misha. I am Sergei, the twin of Misha.'' And then, with an
unmistakable nicotine grin, he turned towards Departures, and vanished.

NEW universities are popping up all over the place. Glasgow, for
instance, now boasts Partick University and St Enoch University.
These new seats of higher learning appear on a map of the city which
was produced for the recent Special Needs Conference held at the SECC.
Ruth Stewart, the Canadian lady based in London who organised the
conference, says yes she knows now there are no such yoonies.
But she swears the information was passed to her by the people at the
SECC. Partick University? St Enoch? Next they'll be saying there's one
called Glasgow Caledonian.
Drawing a blank
WE are v. impressed by the leaflet which the Labour Party has produced
for the upcoming elections to the new unitary Glasgow City Council. It
has an illustration on the front, where the candidate, should be of a
faceless woman. Which is accurate on at least one count.
But it is the text of the manifesto which particularly appealed. It
reads: ''The quick blue Tory jumped over the dead Prime Minister. The
quick blue Tory jumped over the dead Prime Minister. The quick blue Tory
jumped over the dead Prime Minister . . .'' A touch repetitive but not
uninteresting.
It was with sadness that we learned this leaflet was something called
a template and that the real thing would be all about roads, drains, and
playgrounds for weans.
Fairbairns
galore
WE decided last week that the word fairbairn should be preserved in
the Scottish lexicon as a tribute, or otherwise, to Sir Nicky of that
ilk. (And him, barely cauld in his grave.)
Jim Palmer of Garrioch Quadrant, Glasgow, was quick to respond. He
says a fairbairn could be a disgraceful slur (political or otherwise) or
a drink you get served after the last bell.
Continuing the drink theme he suggests a fairbairn could be a generous
non-EC measure of spirits, as in: ''Say when.'' ''Oh, just make it a
fairbairn.'' Or it could simply mean a florid complexion.
Then we have the man as fashion victim, as in: ''Check the tank top on
that fairbairn.'' Sir Nicky could simply be remembered as the word for a
harmless stumble: ''Looked like a fairbairn to me, Archie, but the ref
pointed to the spot.''
Mr Palmer, who is obviously after a job here at the Diary, also
ventures some comment on Sir Nicky's habit of proferring alliterative
lists of hobbies for insertion in Who's Who (you know, like ''bunking
and debunking''). His new pursuits, wherever he might be, could well be
''plea copping, bed hopping and clog popping''.
* Sir Nicky would no doubt be perplexed to discover that, in death, he
is featuring on the information superhighway. The Internet contains this
farewell poem by one Louise Yeoman, to be found in the category
Scotland/general:
Noo famous Fairbairn's deid and gone,
Wha'll cairry on his cairry on?
Wha'll cairry oot his cairry oots?
And dress up in thae famous cloots?
Nae cowerin, timorous
merchant banker
Could follow such a famous w****r.
In with the boot
THE re-Scottishing of the Manchester Daily Express has a way to go.
Last Saturday's edition carried a story about fears of 1000 job losses
at the Rolls-Royce aero-engine plant in East Kilbride. But under the
heading ''1000 car jobs face axe''.
Hearts in the
Highlands?
THE Wall Street Journal knows a thing or two about Scottish football.
The august US business newspaper, previewing world sport, last week put
the Hearts-Rangers tie at the top of their list of games to look out
for. Unfortunately, the Wall Street Journal's grasp of Scottish
geography is not quite so firm. ''A great week of football kicks off in
Scotland. Glasgow Rangers cross the Highlands to play the Edinburgh's
Heart of Midlothian . . .'' No doubt, via Harthill, the gateway to the
Highlands.
You can always bank on Lostbarings
THE Lostbarings Merchant Bank (Auld Reekie) plc acted yesterday to
reassure customers in the wake of financial tremors.
Lostbarings announced a new code of conduct to which their dealers on
the international money markets must strictly adhere:
* Any dealer in the Far East derivatives market turning up for work
without his lucky rabbit's foot will be immediately sent home.
* No member of staff will be allowed to visit Singapore, even with
their parents' credit cards.
* All bets above #100m in futures markets must be placed each way.
* Fund managers have been instructed to construct more balanced
portfolios. A suggested investment profile would be #10 a week on the
National Lottery, #50 on the nose of the first favourite at the 3.15 at
Wincanton, and the rest in a sock under the bed.
* Anyone caught putting the entire company into liquidation will lose
their monthly bonus.
Lostbarings also announced a series of pro-active structural
imperatives to optimise the bank's crisis management capability. A
spokesperson said: ''Our architects have been working over the weekend
to redesign the window ledges at our South Gyle HQ. Each ledge can now
accommodate up to six dealers within the health and safety regulations.
''On the financial side, we have managed to arrange a line of credit
for up to #500m. This is a private deal with Mr David Jeffreys, chairman
of the National Grid, through his number three account at the Bradford
and Bingley.''

IN her after-dinner speech at Gleneagles on Thursday, to the Scottish
Council Forum, Frances Cairncross, media editor of The Economist, struck
a decidedly upbeat tone about the future of work.
Echoing many of the optimistic lines of reasoning in a recent issue of
the magazine she works for, Cairncross argued that, throughout history,
large areas of employment have come and then gone, only to be replaced
by new opportunities for work. There is, she was telling us, no
substantive reason to believe things will be any different this time
around.
As The Economist put it earlier, in typically acerbic style, current
worries about the future of work are misplaced panics got about by
latter-day Luddites who seek to preserve the present in aspic.
The Cairncross/Economist line runs very close to the official
Government gloss on the subject, as related to that same Scottish
Council Forum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Jonathan Aitken. He
urged us to recognise that current employment change is an extraordinary
opportunity to be grasped with both hands.
''Patterns of work and prosperity are likely to change for the better.
New industries mean new skills and new opportunities for workers and new
patterns of working offer individuals the chance to make more of their
lives and of their talents . . . Workers now have more opportunity than
ever before to choose the jobs that suit them and fit in with their
chosen way of life and the incentives are there for them to improve
their skills and be less dependent on paternalistic, dominant
employers,'' he predicted.
Much of this is familiar. Jobs on the land gave way to jobs in
manufacturing, many of them in our cities. More recently, as jobs in
manufacturing have contracted, compensating jobs in service industries
have mushroomed. As technology destroys old jobs, who knows what new
technologies lie just around the corner and what fresh work they, in
turn, will generate?
Ms Cairncross illustrated her main point by listing, approvingly, some
of the new jobs which did not exist when she herself left university at
the end of the sixties. She had put together her list on the flight
north. It ran: video store assistants, pizza delivery boys, leisure club
attendants, people who fit cellular phones into cars, and fish farmers.
I was astonished by the sheer poverty of most of that vision. Fish
farming is a genuinely new indigenous industry, posing significant
technical and marketing challenges and offering some prospect -- if
product dumping and environmental pressures can be overcome and new
farmed species can be bred successfully -- of generating new wealth and
with it, fresh employment. But most of the other new jobs on the
Cairncross list must have brought a wry smile to the face of the
business studies graduate who was waiting on our table.
I don't intend to demean him or the jobs concerned. Delivering a
competitive service better than the next guy can form the basis of major
new businesses, significant wealth generation and jobs. Witness a Kwik
Fit or a Direct Line. But we will never maintain, far less improve, our
national competitiveness in an increasingly global economy, on the back
of a ''two days for a pound'' video rental deal or the promise of a
12-inch Margherita on your doorstep before you can say: hold the olives.
We cannot consume our way back up the OECD growth league. We cannot
even do it by attracting assembly work from elsewhere, if corporate
strategy, design authority and, increasingly, control of parts
procurement remain back at headquarters in Chicago or Osaka.
I'm not against inward investment. Far from it. IT has an important
role to play. But we cannot build a resilient economy by turning
ourselves into a workshop for other people's ideas. We can only do it by
gaining a competitive edge of our own in more of tomorrow's
manufacturing and knowledge-based industries and tradeable services.
One of the most striking things about the Cairncross jobs list is how
many of them come well down the hierarchy of achievement in their
particular sector. Take the video rental store. It only exists because
other people make the films, the video tape, and cassettes, and the
machines, the VCRs and televisions, through which we can consume that
home entertainment.
We have people in the UK who assemble some of these other items. But
they are usually doing it in foreign-owned plants, to someone else's
grand design. It's the same story in cellular phones where Scotland now
has a strong assembly and sub-assembly presence, but much of the
technology is generated and owned in the Far East, America, or
Scandanavia. As for pizzas, who designs and makes the ovens? As with
much of the hardware in the rest of the food-processing industry, it
certainly ain't us.
A well-stocked video store or the fastest and best pizza delivery
service in the neighbourhood may be vital to the quality of life in NW1,
or Byres Road for that matter. But it certainly isn't going to make the
crucial difference between economic success and failure in the future.
The new jobs cited by Frances Cairncross at Gleneagles echoed a
shorter list in The Economist itself. It consisted of aerobics teachers,
software engineers, and derivatives traders. Again jobs which simply
didn't exist in 1970. Given the stunning impact of 28-year-old Nick
Leeson, the trader at Baring's Singapore office responsible for pulling
the entire bank down through betting the wrong way on movements in a
Nikkei index, we should perhaps suspend judgment on whether such
derivatives trading is a blessing or a curse.
But software engineering certainly holds out the promise of new work
in abundance. After home health workers it is forecast to be the biggest
provider of new jobs in the US through to 2005. Can the UK match that
growth? We have many small, vibrant software ventures. But few major
players. Even in one of the industries we can already identify as a
major growth area, we are falling off the pace.
Still, if they don't want to emigrate, surplus IT graduates can always
get a job in a pizza parlour or a video store.

AS soon as Belinda Carlisle takes to the stage kick-boxing in feather
boa and silver spandex it's clear that her recent ascension into
saccharine pop stardom has no place on tonight's nostalgic new-wave
agenda. On the contrary, the reunion with her feisty, guitar-slinging
sisters of yore has transformed the west coast warbler from lip-glossed
corporate doll into manically frugging vamp.
There was a seductively breathy rendering of Our Lips are Sealed and a
pugnacious Skidmarks on my Heart which was an authentic rekindling of
1978 era geek-rock but as the second hour ticked on, the mood slid from
celebratory to shambolic with the otherwise redoubtable drummer Gina
Schock ruining introductions with hammy snare drum-rolls while the band
fell about laughing and the audience became voyeurs at an anarchic
high-school reunion.
Nevertheless parting shots of the Ramones' I Want to be Sedated and
the girl's own chart-friendly Has the Whole World Lost its Head made a
suitably frenzied climax to a night of tongue-in-cheek punk revanchism.

IT COMES as no great surprise that the Jacobites feature strongly in
the schedules of Scotland's educational broadcasters this year.
The 250th anniversary of the '45 Rising provides a perfect opportunity
for reflection, which has already been taken by BBC Radio Scotland. Now
Channel 4 enters the arena with a five-part series for senior primary
and early secondary pupils.
Quite apart from the anniversary landmark, the legend of the Jacobites
has a natural and enduring appeal for Scots: it offers blood, action,
the swirl of the kilt and the skirl of the pipes, and no end of
anti-English sentiment.
However, as Alan Clements, the producer of the television series
argues elsewhere on this page, that simplistic legend belies a more
complex truth.
The teachers' notes for The Jacobites say: ''The aim of the series is
to examine the historical facts of this period of history and dispel
some of the myths surrounding Prince Charlie.
''To help to do this, there is considerable emphasis on the
interpretation of historical information. Throughout the series, the
questions asked are: 'How do we know?' and 'Is it true?'''
With this in mind, Clements's choice of on-screen narrator is an
inspired one. Gerard Kelly plays the big daft laddie to perfection, the
modern-day Scot struggling to understand his heritage, but cracking
enough jokes to keep the subject interesting for a young audience.
The four protagonists -- a Jacobite child, a soldier from each side of
the military divide, and a Presbyterian opponent of Charlie -- are given
an episode each to state their case, their version of history, before
Kelly sums up what he has learned in the final programme.
Like previous Wark Clements production company ventures into
educational broadcasting, the production style of The Jacobites
acknowledges that today's youngster is a sophisticated viewer.
A distinctive feature of the series is the way it moves from the
twentieth century back to 1745, and then back into modern times. There
we are offered mini-documentaries on such diverse, but essentially
Scottish, subjects as fish-processing, Gaelic-medium education, women
ministers, and tourism.
This helps underline the differences between past and present, and the
curricular spin-offs are manifold, with opportunities to tie in
geography, language, literature, art, and science.
But then Alan Clements would probably argue that all these subjects
are part of a living history, and the story of the Jacobites is
essential to understanding present-day Scotland.
* The Jacobites is on Channel 4 at 10.18am tomorrow, and on March 8,
15, 22, and 29.

A 'kist' of Scottish prose, poetrie, and drama is being compiled for
use in primary and secondary schools but not without debate.
DAVID PURVES reports.
BY the beginning of 1993 all Scottish education authorities had agreed
to take part in The Scottish Language Project in co-operation with the
Scottish Consultative Council on the Curriculum. This project is to be
founded on an anthology (or kist) of passages covering prose, poetrie
and drama in both Scots and Gaelic, for use in primary and secondary
schools. The education authorities have gathered the material for the
kist largely in their own parts of Scotland. It is expected to be
published later this year. The Scottish Language Project should gather
momentum as soon as it becomes generally available.
Robbie Robertson, assistant director of the Scottish CCC, has said:
''The kist will contain audio tape readings of all the print texts in
the anthology made by native speakers of Gaelic and each dialect of
Scots.'' What this means is that the contents of the kist will be
dialect material collected locally. The intention seems to be to teach a
standard kind of Gaelic but surviving local dialects of Scots, where
they are still spoken, will apparently be taught on a local basis.
Such a resource will be welcome, but Mr Robertson's statement gives
the impression that within this scheme, Scots is regarded as a
clamjamfrie, or rabble, of dialects, while Gaelic is seen as a language.
Scots is really a great deal more than a collection of differentially
eroded dialects. However, I understand the kist will include some
material from the substantial body of literature in Scots which is not
associated with any particular locality.
Now nobody who is interested in Scots would argue that what is still
left of spoken Scots in areas like Caithness, or what is spoken in
Glasgow by Rab C Nesbitt, is not important. But such dialects cannot be
taught to any extent, either in their own areas or all over Scotland.
For one thing, many teachers were not brought up where they work, and
for another, apart from Buchan (now often referred to as Doric) and
Shetland, the dialects have no literature to speak of for teaching
programmes.
It is now sometimes asserted that there is no such thing as standard
Scots, and while this may be true of contemporary colloquial speech, the
body of literature in Scots is not far off being a standard that
everybody can understand. The language used in traditional Scots songs
such as those written by Burns and Lady Nairn is a standard kind of
Scots, and the same can be said of the ballads and proverbs. The
language of the poems in Scots in the literature from Allan Ramsay to
William Soutar is remarkably consistent. Such phrases as, Wha'll buy
caller herrin/They're bonnie fish an halesome farin, are not in any
localised Scots dialect. The main respect in which this language varies
in the literature is in the extent to which it has been anglicised.
This literary Scots is the only language that could be used for
teaching all over Scotland. It is well understood everywhere. Yet it is
far from perfect. Much of what has been written in this medium has taken
little account of native grammar and syntax. Some common features of
Scots grammar are seldom found, for example, in the writing of Hugh
MacDiarmid, who had little time for what he saw as the language of
hinds, yokels and chawbacons. If he had paid more attention to the
patterns of his own native speech, he would never have written a line
like: Yin canna thow the cockles o yin's hert. This is more like the
speech of Buckingham Palace translated into what is imagined to be
Scots, than anything anybody would ever say in Scotland.
Although literary Scots is the only kind that could be taught in
schools all over Scotland it is deficient in many respects. Although an
abundance of poetry and a fair number of plays have been written in this
language, there is a dearth of satisfactory prose models which could
serve as useful examples for teaching purposes. Outside poetry, the
literary language is largely confined to narrative prose, such as Robert
McLellan's Linmill Stories.
No grammar of Scots has been published within living memory, and Grant
and Dixon's Manual of Modern Scots from the early 1920s, is as modern as
can be found in print. In this respect, the Shetland dialect of Scots is
better served than the language as a whole.
Moreover, there is no generally recognised system of spelling Scots
words, and sometimes several alternative spellings can be found in the
dictionaries for the same word. Some of the spellings often used by
contemporary writers, such as, fer, fir or fur, to replace for, or fu
for fou, cause confusion and mislead readers about pronunciation.
The standardisation of Scots spelling is long overdue. In 1947, a
group of makkars, among them Douglas Young, Sydney Goodsir Smith and
Albert Mackie, met to address this problem in an Edinburgh hostelry. The
Scots Style Sheet, which was published the same year, was the result of
their deliberations. This was little more than a single page of
proposals concerning the spelling of Scots, but considering the venue,
perhaps it is surprising they got as far as they did! Most of the
proposals were sensible.
However, the Style Sheet was hardly adequate for a language which had
once been the state language of Scotland, and in 1985, the Scots
Language Society convened a meeting of writers using Scots. This group
reached agreement on 26 recommendations for writers in Scots which were
subsequently published by the society. Without some rational ground
standards, Scots cannot be taught effectively at any level, and the
evolution of a standard orthography is one of the most important steps
necessary before Scots can take its rightful place in Scottish
education.
It is important in Scottish education to repudiate the notion that
Scots is simply a corrupt form of English and several difficult problems
of definition will have to be tackled before the language can be taught
effectively either at school or university level.
Nevertheless, a serious start has now been made and opportunities for
public debate will present themselves as the Scottish Language Project
develops. The Scottish CCC is to be congratulated in launching the
project. The importance of this recognition of the educational relevance
of our two native languages as part of our cultural heritage can hardly
be overestimated.

I LOVE history. I think it is the most stimulating, challenging and
thought-provoking of all the disciplines. It teaches, in equal measure,
lessons about the world of the past and the world of the present.
I studied history in universities in Scotland and the USA for six
years -- indeed at one point I had studied so much Russian history I
felt I could have offered guided tours to the Winter Palace in 1917!
And yet, probably like most Scots of my generation, despite all that
study I have only the vaguest notion of what the Scots were fighting for
at Flodden and why they lost. That is inexcusable. No other European
nation does -- or would -- allow this situation to exist.
At Stranraer Academy, I had a wonderful and inspiring history teacher
but the demands of the curriculum meant that sustained Scottish history
at school effectively ended with the building of Hadrian's Wall, with
patches of the agricultural and industrial revolutions slotting in
later. At Glasgow University I took a history degree without turning a
page of Scottish history.
That situation was disgraceful but it is now being tackled
enthusiastically by education authorities and broadcasters alike. There
appears to be an educational consensus that Scottish history matters and
Scottish children should know it. This is a vital process and one in
which I hope our new five-part series The Jacobites for Channel 4 will
play a small part.
But this raises the problem of what history and whose history?
Scotland's story is so rich and complex it is exceptionally difficult to
tell the story simply and truthfully. And, in this nation without a
state, any interpretation is automatically a political statement.
Indeed, James Joyce could easily have had Scotland in mind when he
wrote, ''history is a nightmare from which I am trying to escape''.
For example, many Scots regard Bonnie Prince Charlie as a
proto-Scottish nationalist and the Jacobites as tragic heroes, yet the
prevailing view across much of the Lowlands of Scotland in 1746 was this
-- the only tragedy was that the Duke of Cumberland hadn't killed enough
Highlanders at Culloden. How do you teach 10 year-olds a history as
complex -- and as painful -- as that?
I believe the most important factor is honesty. If you want to teach
the true history of the Jacobites, as opposed to the shortbread tin
myths of Bonnie Prince Charlie, you need to face the Scots with some
unpleasant truths about themselves.
The Jacobite rising of 1745-46 was not exclusively an English against
Scottish conflict, it was also a Scottish civil war and the conflict
divided Scotland along lines still familiar in the 1990s, namely
Highland versus Lowland and Catholic versus Protestant. Unless we can
honestly examine why these divisions happened then we will never
understand how they prevent Scots acting in common cause to this day.
The incredible bravery and fortitude of the Jacobite army cannot mask
the fact that they fought for a man who cared little for the throne of
Scotland and desired deeply only to rule Britain.
In our series Gerald Kelly played the part of a Scot naive about his
history -- which, he assured me, required no rehearsal! During his
search for the truth about the Jacobites he conjures up four time
travellers each of whom give him his or her version of events and
reflect on how the world has changed. They are Jean MacDonald, an
11-year-old Highland girl, Alexander Stewart, footman to Prince Charles,
Michael Hughes, a private in the Hanoverian army, and Charlotte Hill,
wife of a leading Glasgow Presbyterian minister.
Through both our drama and Gerard's humour we wanted to bring the
Jacobites alive for primary pupils. We wanted them to believe every
character. To do this we had each character offering Gerard a passionate
and convincing opinion on the Jacobite rising, leaving him more confused
than ever. In the fifth programme, after visiting the pupils of Duncan
Forbes primary school at Culloden, who had been working on a Jacobites
project, Gerard realises that they are all right. Each of the characters
holds part of the truth.
We want pupils to realise that history is about passion and
commitment, an issue often of life and death which informs the way we
live today. If they take nothing else, they should take from the series
that history is as much about opinion as fact. If that happens, we will
have succeeded.
And if The Jacobites fires just one pupil with the same passion for
history that has been such a wonderful companion to me over the years
then I will have succeeded beyond my hopes.
Alan Clements is the producer of The Jacobites.

THE Scottish Vocational Education Council (Scotvec) will hit our
television screens next week when an advertising campaign invites
companies to ''imagine an information system that thinks for itself . .
. an industrial appliance that learns as it operates.''
The system or appliance is the company's staff and the products being
marketed are Scottish Vocational Qualifications (SVQs).
There are more than 600 SVQs covering nearly every occupation. They
are based on standards developed by employers themselves, and offer the
guarantee that staff can carry out their jobs to national standards.
They cover competence at every level, from the ability to execute
predictable and routine tasks to the attainment of skills in more
advanced technical areas, planning and problem solving, right through to
management.
SVQs offer these important advantages to employers:
* They are flexible -- staff can train at work, through day release or
part-time study.
* They can be assessed in the workplace.
* Since they measure skills output rather than training input,
employers are free to decide the amount and nature of training required.
Indeed, each unit awarded is entered on the candidate's Record of
Education and Training, so that those not wishing to complete a full SVQ
have recognition for their achievements.
Experienced employees may be able to gain their award quickly, others
may need more training and development before they are ready to be
assessed.
Endorsed by Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise,
and recognised throughout the UK and beyond, SVQs attract Government and
European funding in some circumstances.
They are regularly reviewed to ensure that they take account of
changing work practices and new technology. They also purport to achieve
increased competitiveness, higher productivity, improved staff
motivation, and reduced absenteeism and turnover.
They are compatible with National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) in
England and Wales, although they allow for Scotland's specific
employment needs and separate legal system.
An organisation interested in entering the SVQ structure can form a
consortium with others; or can become an approved centre offering
training; or can ask an approved centre to deliver the SVQs.
Approval entails satisfying Scotvec that it has the quality systems
for managing training, and the personnel and resources to develop staff
and assess them against national standards.
Bearing in mind the potential benefits, the cost to a company of
offering SVQ training appears modest. Employers delivering SVQs in-house
will have these direct costs to meet:
* A fee for each candidate (#34 on average).
* A fee for approval as a Scotvec centre (about #100 per year).
In addition, there will be indirect costs, depending on the company,
for any training required, assessment in the workplace, and recording
systems.
Companies which have embarked upon SVQ initiatives are enthusiastic.
The Scottish Co-op, intent on discarding its traditional image and
developing as a modern marketing force, was among the earliest SCOTVEC
approved centres for SVQs in Retail Distribution.
The third largest retailer in Scotland, behind Safeway and Asda, it is
now aware of better service and increased productivity. All 20 of its
most recent batch of SVQ candidates are still with the Co-op, well above
the average retention rate in the retail trade.
Quarrier's Homes in Bridge of Weir provides a wide range of caring
services for disabled children and adults. It is now implementing a
strategic plan of staff development and hopes, by the end of the decade,
to take as many as 50% of all staff to the SVQ in Care at level three.
Zara Ross, director of human resources, says: ''Because they are so
appropriate to day-to-day care worker duties, SVQs open a new,
cost-effective route to broadening the base of qualified staff.''
Bairdwear Racke of Renfrweshire, a division of Baird Textile Holdings,
trained a group of 12 line supervisors to serve as assessors for their
in-house SVQ scheme.
At any time, they will have up to 60 sewing machinists working towards
the SVQ in Manufacturing Products from Textiles.
The award fits admirably into their daily operation and, according to
training coordinator Debbie Docherty: ''We've been surprised how much
satisfaction the scheme has brought -- both for ourselves and for the
candidates.''
Next week's TV adverts feature the box on the box. A large packing
case, bearing the words ''Handle with Care'', bursts open to reveal the
SVQ logo.
The audio message will be that ''SVQs help release the potential in
your business by bringing out the best in your most important asset.
Your people.'' Let's hope those who can empower the people will watch
and take heed.

AN iceberg the size of Scotland's central belt has broken free from
Antarctica and is heading north into the Pacific. Warming of the climate
over the last half century has sliced the iceberg off the Larsen Ice
Shelf south of New Zealand. It measures 48 miles by 23 miles and is
650ft thick.
The British Antarctic Survey said the break made James Ross Island
navigable for the first time. Scientists who saw it from the air said
that a dense plume of ice fragments trailed several hundred miles into
the sea. The discovery comes hard on the heels of the disintegration of
another ice shelf, the scientists said. ''The retreat of these ice
shelves is, in the short-term, irreversible. The retreat is a result of
a warming of the regional climate by 2.5[0]C since the 1940s.'' --

Moscow, Monday
RUSSIA today unveiled an exhibition of priceless paintings which were
seized by Soviet forces as war booty from the Nazis and hidden in vaults
for half a century.
Germany immediately dropped a heavy hint that it wants the paintings
back.
Soviet troops plundered the masterpieces from the ruins of Nazi
Germany at the end of the Second World War and spirited them back to
Moscow.
''What the troops did was a real act of salvation,'' said Irina
Antonova, director of Moscow's Pushkin Museum of Fine Art, at the start
of a five-month exhibition commemorating the Soviet role in the victory
over Germany.
Next month, St Petersburg's Hermitage Museum will unveil 74 paintings
by Vincent Van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, and Edgar Degas and other
impressionist masters which were taken in similar circumstances.
Antonova said the 63 works on show at the Pushkin, including pieces by
Spanish classicists Francisco de Goya and El Greco and French
impressionist Auguste Renoir, represented only one-sixth of its spoils
of war and that more exhibitions would follow.
The directors of the Pushkin Museum have billed the exhibition as a
memorial to the 50th anniversary of the ''great victory'' over Germany
which Russia celebrates on May 9.
The German embassy said Bonn expected all the paintings to be returned
by Moscow under the terms of bilateral accords.
''The German side confirms its legal position, that the original
owners of cultural treasures or their descendants have not lost their
right of ownership,'' an embassy statement said.
German diplomat Rainhold Frickhinger said Bonn had returned 24,000
works plundered by Nazis while Russia had sent back only some of its war
spoils to East Berlin.
The two sides agreed during talks in Dresden in February 1993 to try
to return the treasures taken from each other.
''Especially now, when Russia has lost face in the West because of the
campaign in Chechnya . . . Russia must have a strong interest in winning
back its international credibility and respectability,'' said
Frickhinger.--Reuter.

Quetta, Monday
METHANE gas caused an explosion deep inside a coalmine in the
south-western Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killing at least 27
miners.
A labour leader said 30 miners were killed by the explosion last night
at Sinjadi mine, 50 miles east of the provincial capital of Quetta.
However the chief inspector of mines, Mian Mohammad Abbas, put the
toll at 27 in what he called the worst coalmine explosion in the
province.
The provincial government ordered a judicial inquiry, and Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto asked authorities to take measures to prevent
similar accidents in the coalmines.
Eighteen bodies had been recovered from the mine by late afternoon,
Abbas said. Nine men were still inside the mine, 2500ft below the
surface, but there was no hope that any were still alive.
Provincial authorities have announced compensation of 100,000 rupees
(#3000) each to the families of the victims, most of whom were from the
north-western district of Swat.--Reuter.

Sarajevo, Monday
INTERNATIONAL negotiators will make a fresh effort to persuade Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic to unblock stalled peace talks in former
Yugoslavia, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said today.
Diplomatic sources said Big Power envoys had failed to shift Mr
Milosevic in talks last week.
However Mr Hurd told reporters in Vienna that the meeting ''wasn't
decisive, either positive or negative'', and that they would return to
Belgrade on Wednesday for another round of discussions with the Serbian
leader.
A Big Power contact group -- the United States, Russia, France,
Germany, and Britain -- proposed lifting UN sanctions against rump
Yugoslavia if Mr Milosevic would recognise Croatia and Bosnia.
Such a move would further isolate Bosnian and Croatian Serbs, who are
resisting Big Power peace efforts.
Mr Milosevic wants the sanctions lifted without conditions. His
government has stuck to its insistence that a political settlement must
be reached with the Bosnian and Croatian Serbs before the Zagreb and
Sarajevo governments can be recognised.
The contact group is anxious to make progress before a four month
ceasefire in Bosnia expires at the end of April.
''There is not a great deal of time and that is why we will continue
to be extremely active to find a way to peace before once again the
illusion of military victory comes to the combatants,'' said Mr Hurd.
* Turkish President Suleyman Demirel was prevented from visiting
Sarajevo today when the UN, alarmed by an outbreak of sniping, refused
to provide a plane to fly him to the Bosnian capital.--Reuter.

Sydney, Monday
ALAN BOND, one of Australia's most colourful and high-flying 1980s
entrepreneurs, is back in business after being freed from bankruptcy
today by personal creditors who accepted a pay-out of less than half a
cent on the dollar.
''I'm very pleased to see this annulled, now I can get on and do some
consultancy work,'' said a smiling Bond, who only eight months ago told
an Australian court he was suffering brain damage and could not even tie
his shoe laces.
Bond declined to detail his future business plans, except to say he
intended to ''try and do anything I can to encourage investment in
Australia''.
Bond was freed from almost three years of bankruptcy when his
creditors meeting in Sydney accepted his offer of A$3.25m (#1.6m) over
three years to settle debts totalling about A$600m (#296m).
Bond's corporate creditors have already accepted an offer of A$7.0m
(#3.4m) for debts of A$519m (#254m).
''The composition has been accepted, the bankruptcy has been
annulled,'' said Bond's bankruptcy trustee, Robert Ramsay.
Bond's deal saw him immediately pay A$1.0m (#493,000) to creditors,
with a further A$750,000 (#369,000) due annually to creditors for the
next three years.
One big creditor, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd, said
last week that it was reluctant to continue the paper chase with little
guarantee of further returns.
Ramsay had wanted to extend Bond's bankruptcy for five years as he had
not completed his inquiries and believed he was only months away from
uncovering Bond's real financial position.
''I know where the money was, I know it is not there now, and I
suspect I know its present location,'' he said last week.
Ramsay believes Bond has ''secreted'' millions of dollars in a complex
web of offshore accounts.
The Hongkong Bank said if further Bond assets are uncovered by police
or anyone else, then creditors could apply for Bond to be placed back
into bankruptcy.
''He is not actually off the hook -- it is a conditional release,''
Rezos said.
Bond declared bankruptcy in 1992, two years after his A$10bn (#5000m)
flagship Bond Corporation Holdings Ltd, a beer, property, media, and
resource empire, collapsed under a mountain of debt.
However Bond still faces fraud and conspiracy charges over a A$1bn
(#506m) business deal in the late 1980s and a criminal charge over the
sale of a painting by French impressionist Monet.
Bond's escape from bankruptcy will only add to his folklore status in
Australia.
Born in Essex in 1938, Bond sailed with his parents to the port town
of Fremantle in Western Australia in 1950.
Once in Australia, the young Bond showed entrepreneurial skills,
employing local children to sell newspapers and magazines along the
Fremantle wharves.
After marrying the daughter of a prominent businessman and politician
at 18, however, Bond plunged into the construction businesses, becoming
a millionaire at 21.
In 1974, he nearly crashed to earth when the bottom fell out of the
property business, but he won time from creditors with a plan to sell
off #30m of assets and survived.
Bond became a national hero in 1983 when his consortium wrested the
America's Cup, yachting's premier trophy, from the United States for the
first time in 132 years in a victory he claimed made him the
best-recognised Australian.
In 1987 Bond, an avid collector of Impressionist paintings, secretly
bought Vincent Van Gogh's ''Irises'' for a world record $49m to hang in
his Perth penthouse office.
He also bought a country estate in Britain, containing a whole
village, an island off Western Australia, and a number of
yachts.--Reuter.

<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979632337</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Los Angeles, Monday
MOMENTS before O J Simpson's possible alibi witness was to give
evidence in his double murder trial today, the prosecution convinced the
judge that Rosa Lopez should be questioned in front of a camera rather
than the jury.
Lopez has claimed she saw Simpson's white Ford Bronco outside his home
at the time his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron
Goldman were murdered on June 12.
Footballer turned film star Simpson has denied both killings.
Lopez has complained that the mass of publicity surrounding the trial
has ruined her life and says she wants to return to her native El
Salvador. Simpson's lawyers said that in order to honour her wishes she
should give her evidence now -- in the middle of the prosecution's case.
However, prosecutor Marcia Clark said today that this would have
interfered with the prosecution and blunted the impact of the story it
is trying to tell.
Defence lawyer Johnnie Cochran was amazed. ''It's the usual thing,
your Honour,'' he told the judge in Los Angeles. ''The court has ruled
on this. They have agreed to it. It's the honourable and fair thing to
do.''
However Superior Court Judge Lance Ito said his latest decision to
permit recorded evidence will allow 'the rights of both sides'' to be
protected.
In a victory for the prosecutors, Lopez's evidence on videotape will
be shown to the jury after the defence starts its case.
Ito ruled that having a defence witness testify before the prosecution
finishes its case would disrupt the prosecution's presentation and would
be distracting for the jury.
Lopez's testimony could put Simpson where prosecutors say he was not,
as well as further sully the reputation of Detective Mark Fuhrman, whom
the defence may try to paint as a racist bent on framing Simpson for the
murders.
The prosecution claims Simpson drove from his estate to his ex-wife's
home two miles away in his Bronco, committed the murders at about
10.15pm, then drove back home in time to meet a limousine driver who was
taking him to the airport.
But Lopez, who was a live-in housekeeper at Simpson's neighbour's home
at the time, has stated she saw the Bronco parked outside his estate
between 10.15pm and 10.20pm.
Lopez also claimed to have given this information to Fuhrman the day
after the killings, yet no-one ever followed this up with her.
Defence lawyers say Fuhrman, whom they have labelled a ''racist cop'',
did nothing with the information and failed to report it to his
superiors.
Fuhrman says he found a blood-stained glove on Simpson's estate the
day after the murders and the defence has suggested he may have planted
it to incriminate Simpson for racial motives.--AP/Reuter.

Paris, Monday
A TEENAGER of Russian origin shot dead his father and stepmother,
grandparents, and two family friends, sparing only his baby sister in a
killing spree at his home in an affluent suburb in the west of Paris.
Justice sources said 17-year-old Alexei Polevoi used guns from his
father's collection to kill the six, all of Russian nationality, after a
family quarrel.
He spared his two-year-old sister, asleep upstairs at the luxury
rented home in Louveciennes.
The boy alerted police to the killing, saying he found the bodies upon
returning home at 3am. Under police questioning, however, he cracked and
confessed to the killings.
''There was a total lack of understanding,'' said prosecutor Herve
Garrigues. ''The father treated him harshly and considered him a
good-for-nothing.''
The father's remarriage and the boy's poor relationship with his
grandparents may have been contributing factors, he added.
The six victims, aged between 50 and 70, were apparently killed as
they prepared to go to bed. Four of the bodies were in the living room,
another in a corridor and the sixth upstairs.
* A Russian man went on trial in Berlin today, accused of killing a
compatriot and stealing 65 icons worth #660,000 from the victim's
gallery.
The defendant, a 44-year-old architect named only as Vladimir S, is
also alleged to have taken part in the murder of another icon dealer.
Moscow authorities are also investigating whether the man may have
killed a ballet dancer missing since 1991 and used her credit cards to
buy antique books.--Reuter.

Mogadishu, Tuesday
US Marines swept ashore today on the beaches of Mogadishu, this time
not to save starving Somalis, but to protect UN peacekeepers retreating
from the country's chaos.
The first amphibious wave was met on the beach at one minute after
midnight by its own commanding general and about 150 Pakistani
peacekeepers backed by tanks.
About 18 hours earlier, a vanguard force of about 150 Marines landed
by helicopter and Helicat air cushion vessels on a beach at the seaside
airport to set up a command headquarters and landing routes.
''The first wave has hit the beach,'' Lieutenant Colonel Mike Sovacool
announced in the command centre. ''Everything is quiet out there.
Everything is going to plan.''
Although staged with the precision of a combat invasion, the Marines
did not land on a hostile beach and were greeted by friends, not foes.
The airport and nearby sea port were controlled by UN peacekeepers,
who have been keeping away children, scavengers, and the curious for
days.
Although they prepared for the possibility, commanders of the
seven-nation US-led forces did not expect a direct confrontation with
Somali militia.
Instead, the biggest threat may be from stray bullets, mortars, and
rocket-propelled grenades fired by the rival militias warring among
themselves.
The United States and its British, Italian, French, and Malaysian
allies put together a force of 14,000 troops to protect the withdrawal
of the last 2400 Pakistani and Bangladeshi peacekeepers. The force had
been on 32 ships off Somalia for more than a week.
The Pakistani and Bangladeshi peacekeepers are the last of a UN force
that once numbered 38,000 from 21 nations.
American Marines first came to Somalia in 1992 as part of a military
coalition sent to save the Horn of Africa nation from war and famine.
An estimated 350,000 Somalis had died, and the United Nations said a
million more could perish if banditry and militia fighting were not
halted so that food could be delivered to the starving. The United
States and its allies largely completed that task, saving tens of
thousands of lives.
However, US and foreign troops became embroiled in the violent
struggle for power among Somalia's warlords. In October 1993, 18
Americans were killed in a firefight with the militia of General Mohamed
Farrah Aideed, and the body of a dead American soldier was dragged
through the streets of Mogadishu.
More than 100 peacekeepers from other countries also died, among them
24 Pakistani soldiers in a June 1993 ambush.
Washington turned over the humanitarian mission to the UN in March
1994 and the emphasis shifted to reconstruction, with the hope of
setting up a democratic government.
That effort failed, mired in mismanagement and the intransigence of
Somali warlords. The humanitarian effort degenerated into a low-grade
war between clan militias and UN forces.
The United Nations leaves Somalia no closer to democracy than when it
arrived. The country has had no government since former dictator Mohamed
Siad Barre was overthrown in January 1991.--AP.

Ankara, Monday
A POWERFUL car bomb exploded in a crowded market street in the
Kurdish-controlled Iraqi city of Zakho today, killing or wounding more
than 100 people.
Hoshyar Zebari, a London-based spokesman for the Kurdistan Democratic
Party, said that 73 people had died and 141 were wounded. Barham Saleh
of the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan said 80 were killed and dozens
injured.
''The blast occurred at the part of Zakho called the financial
district at 8.18am,'' reported US Lieutenant Christopher Leist from
Incirlik air base, home to the Western allied force protecting Kurds in
northern Iraq from a possible attack by Baghdad.
He confirmed at least 54 deaths. It was not immediately clear who was
behind the blast, which follows renewed tensions between the rival
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and the Kurdish Democratic Party
(KDP), the area's dominant factions.
A PUK statement pointed at Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, whose
forces have been shut out of the region by Western air power.
''Those powers seeking to perpetuate the in-fighting among the Kurds,
and in particular the Saddam Hussein regime, are prime suspects behind
this atrocity,'' the statement said.
Relief workers reported from the region that the blast struck a
crowded commercial street lined with traders, many from neighbouring
Turkey.
A Turkish Foreign Ministry official confirmed the explosion and said
he feared that Turkish lorry drivers who regularly pass through Zakho
could be among the casualties.
Incirlik, in southern Turkey, is the centre of Operation Provide
Comfort, the allied effort to shield Iraq's Kurds. The operation keeps a
liaison office in Zakho.
Northern Iraq has been locked in factional fighting since mid-December
between the forces of the KDP, led by Masoud Barzani, and the PUK of
Jalal Talabani.
Turkey and the United States have recently warned both leaders that
their fratricidal fight could endanger the flow of aid to the region.
Turkey supports the truck trade into Iraq. Turkish trucks haul in food
and medicine, which are allowed under the UN Gulf War sanctions, and
bring back diesel fuel.
In another development, Iraqi Vice-President Taha Yassin Ramadan today
denounced the US ambassador to the UN, Madeleine Albright, for trying to
block moves to ease sanctions on Iraq.
In the first official Iraqi comment on Albright's tour, Ramadan said
it showed that the US was ''bankrupt and isolated''.
* Iraq has failed to account for 20-30 tonnes of so-called ''growth
media'' that could be used to produce two to three tons of bacteria for
biological weapons, a UN official said.
Rolf Ekeus, in charge of ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction,
said millions of pounds worth of ''growth media'', in which germs can
grow, had been imported in 1988-89.
''We want to know why was this material imported? Where is it now? Has
it been destroyed? Or has it been used and turned into bacteria?
''If it has been turned into bacteria then we have a problem,'' Ekeus
said after briefing the Security Council about a trip to Baghdad in
which, he said, he had made progress in all weapons areas except
biological arms.--Reuter/AP.

Study break launched student on a new career in trees. Sue Coutts
reports on a flourishing business.
A SUMMER break from college has opened up a new career path for Mark
Collins.
He now fronts a tree surgery operation, based in Edinburgh, which is
in demand throughout central Scotland, and has taken on another partner
to cope with increasing business.
Working through the breaks in his university studies, Collins built up
an all-round insight into the business, from accounts to tree rope work.
A new approach to caring for trees has brought his company thinning
contracts from the Forestry Commission, Smiths Gore, and the Church of
Scotland.
Cash from this growth, says Collins, is all going back into a business
where winches and tackle can cost around #1000 an item.
His success is mirrored throughout Scotland: there are already
hundreds of companies, including 27 in the Edinburgh area, with
competition for training courses proving intense.
Collins said: ''When I do a job, nothing is destroyed -- 60% of my
present work is won by driving around looking at trees, talking to
owners, and pointing out faults.''
He also has a tie-in with Fountain Tree Surgeons, doing line-clearance
work.
Collins's next move is to sell such wood, along with selling the good
wood to sculptures and art colleges.
''It is really hard to get into,'' said Collins. ''Simply to get the
necessary experience is hard, and it is experience that counts.''
And there's more to the business than meets the eye. Collins and his
partner, Davie Sprott, have rescued cats and also tackled a number of
difficult contracts.
His most dangerous job involved half a tree, a large Scots Pine
perched on top of a garage roof, blown over in the recent gales.
Collins suspended himself in a giant V-formation, hovering just above
the tree, so being trapped under it or inside was a strong probability.
On the plus side, he added: ''It is a real skill, and to do it
properly is something developed over the years.
''However, it still has a bad image from cowboy operators -- anyone
can go out and buy a chainsaw and call themselves a tree surgeon.''
But the image is changing, with many more courses now in the offing
for both tree surgery and forestry careers.
The umbrella organisation providing a quality bench mark is the Forest
Contractors Association, which also takes in planters, extraction
specialists, and anyone doing work with trees.
Meanwhile, the Forestry Commission in Edinburgh handles courses in
chainsaw techniques and safety administration.
There are a number of courses to choose from, and a good start for
information is the Arboricultural Association.
Arboriculture can be defined as the production and management of trees
and shrubs in both urban and rural environments where amenity is a
primary objective.
Forestry, on the other hand, usually has the primary objective of
economic timber production.
On the career front, opportunities exist for people with many skills
including management in both commercial enterprises and local
government.
The range of expertise required, combined with the comparative
youthfulness of the industry, is still evolving across the broad areas
of education and training.
In addition to one and three-year residental courses, short training
courses are available, usually arranged on an ad hoc basis by colleges,
training groups, and employers.
Although specific courses are not on offer for amenity woodlands, the
practical skills are mainly those of commercial forestry, which can be
taken at Cumbria College of Agriculture and Forestry and Inverness
College.
On a general arboriculture note, packed courses of three years for the
national Diploma (BTEC) and a one year NCH are available at Aberdeen
University, which also offers arboriculture as an option in forestry
degree courses.
Most of these courses include tree surgery, and offer the chance to
gain the City and Guilds special certificate in tree surgery for
craftsmen.
* For more information on a career in arboriculture, contact the
Forestry Training Council, Room 413, 231 Corstorphine Road, Edinburgh
(0131 334 80830), or the Arboricultural Association (0794 68717).

MR William Sanderson's complaint about an ''inaccurate, unsettling and
grossly misleading'' reference to his company, Lithgow Electronics, is
itself inaccurate and misleading (February 21).
The article said Lithgow workers received a 5.8% pay increase this
year while Mr Sanderson states that ''in the year ended December 31,
1994, Lithgow Electronics reached a 3% pay settlement'', ie, last year.
As pointed out in the article, the 5.8% figure came from a survey
conducted by Incomes Data Services, probably Britain's most
authoritative pay research organisation.
A subsequent more detailed report from IDS shows that the January 1,
1995 -- ie, this year's settlement -- at Lithgow Electronics actually
increased basic pay by 6.2%. Any further queries should perhaps be
directed to IDS, 193 St John Street, London EC1 4LS.

NURSES are demoralised. I wonder why? Their unions tell us it is due
to problems with wages, unemployment, and service.
Since 1979 average nurse's pay has increased by 65% after inflation.
There are 18,000 more nurses and many of the new administrators in the
NHS are nurses who have been promoted into the administration of their
hospitals.
As for service, I should have thought the nursing profession, being a
vocation rather than a job, would have been delighted to learn that
since hospital trusts began three years ago the number of patients being
treated has increased.
More than 3000 extra patients are treated every day and the
satisfaction level being expressed by patients is even better than
before.

AS one who in the course of his professional life has had a certain
amount to do with the very real concern expressed by John Macleod in his
article, ''The killer we ignore'' (February 21), I endorse every word he
says.
In addition to the instances he names, one of whom was known to me
personally, there is another who, were it not for this same problem,
might well have become the best Prime Minister we ever had. His innate
wisdom and political acumen, as well as his unimpeachable professional
and personal integrity, made his counsel invaluable in the highest
quarters.
Were it not for his eventual retirement from the House of Commons and
the high office which would undoubtedly have come to him, the state of
his party -- and I believe, this country -- would have been very
different from what it is today.
The final task which I had been engaged upon -- sadly uncompleted
before illness led to my own premature retirement from a very different
sphere -- was a report to a central church body on teenage alcoholism.
In it I would have paid tribute to the outstanding work of Dr Ian Glen
of the Alcoholism Unit at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, as well as to
that of the Iona Community, to whom I was indebted for much invaluable
information.
They had just hosted a high-level medical consultation which had
identified a vital clinical factor which is still not sufficiently
recognised in many quarters, namely the particular effect which drinking
has on the hormone system of the young, impelling them to commit violent
criminal acts quite out of character, leading to punitive sentencing
normally dealt out to hardened criminals.
The high incidence of suicide among young men, exacerbated by
alcoholism, is of more recent concern. Dr Glen has identified an all too
common factor of unemployment as being an underlying one. It is in fact
recognised among counsellors that there is in nearly every case of
confirmed alcoholism such an underlying factor.
Personal tragedy and stress abound, and the existence or absence of
certain core values deep in the persona often determines the ability or
inability to cope, and alcohol is for so many the fatal crutch on which
they rely.
There is, too, the factor of drug addiction which might well be
similarly attributed. In all of this pool of human tragedy, as John
Macleod perceives, the conspiracy of silence can hardly help the
sufferer.

THE Rowntree Foundation investigation is remarkable for the degree of
consensus between representatives of the TUC and the CBI over the extent
of inequality in 1990s Britain. Your leader comment (February 11) hints
at some of the policy strategies that could be employed to tackle the
causes of unprecedented inequality.
It is being driven by the trend in earnings, not just by the tax and
benefit systems: the appropriate role of a minimum wage now needs to be
debated.
The recent report of the Commission on Social Justice proposed a
national minimum wage for a number of reasons. In an increasingly
flexible labour market, the benefits system is inflexible and
out-of-date. A modern form of full employment including part-time as
well as full-time jobs, for women as well as men, will require flexible
benefits and investment in high quality pre-school education and
childcare.
But in the absence of a floor beneath low wages, no amount of benefit
changes will build effective bridges back to work if people end up
hardly better off than being out of employment.
Secondly, there is an important training argument for a minimum wage.
One of the reasons for market failure in skills training is the rate of
turnover in low-paid jobs. People being paid far below the value of
their work tend not to stay in such jobs if they can find better ones.
Few employers in that position are willing to invest in training if
they are unlikely to gain any benefit. A minimum wage will help reduce
the speed of turnover and begin to build incentives for both employees
and employers to invest in training.
There is a third argument in favour of a minimum wage. The
Government's willingness to pay family credit to low-earning families
with children sends a green light to some employers simply to drop low
wages still further, secure in the knowledge that the state will top-up
the difference through means-tested benefits.
It is ironic that a Government committed to lowering dependence on
benefits is prepared passively to subsidise poor employment practice. A
more active strategy -- a minimum wage -- could also save money on
means-tested benefits.
Those in favour of a minimum wage will strengthen their case by
linking it to other long-term strategies which aim to put welfare back
to work. They will also carry more conviction by accepting that a level
set too high will cost jobs and that a level set too low will not be
worth having.

DR LIBBY WILSON, in her letter about our book, Reader's Digest Touring
Guide to Britain, claims that the Burrell Collection and Pollok House
have been omitted from the guide (February 1). This is not the case.
The relevant entry is on page 240 and the Burrell Collection is marked
on the map (page 241 in square Cb). There is also a gazetteer entry on
page 292.
As the book is designed to give a feel for each area and is clearly
not a definitive guide, details for each entry are strictly limited.
Thus, the entry on the Hunterian Art Gallery (page 242) states that
the ''main gallery includes Scottish paintings from the eighteenth
century to the present day, and Old Masters''. At no point do we claim
to give an exhaustive list of exhibits.
I hope this has answered the questions raised by Dr Wilson.

WHAT Robert Grigor's article (Weekender, February 11) about The
Gentleman Host totally failed to do was to tell us anything about what
gentleman hosts are required to do. The article was a lengthy travelogue
about film crews, eating, and other unrelated matters.
Having myself looked into being a gentleman host, corresponding with
and speaking to Lauretta Blake who telephoned me straight from the
States, I found it sad that Mr Grigor did not enlighten readers about
the subject in hand.
My involvement in applying revealed that the hosts must be prepared,
for example, to dance every dance and be virtually dance-instructor
standard. Dancing consists of two four-hour sessions every day. Lauretta
Blake confirmed, specifically, that every dance must be undertaken as
there may be 80 ladies and four hosts.
You must have a full wardrobe including white tuxedo, etc, and pay
#100 per week and have funds to fly yourself home should you not fulfil
all your obligations. I declined an invitation for an interview.
It would surely be of interest to know about all the requirements of
the gentleman hosts and the age groups of the ladies involved. The
article could have saved them from having to dig a little deeper.
Do you know anyone who could or would want to dance for eight hours
with a different partner each time? This sounds more like a nightmare
than Mr Grigor's dream. I note he did not do it.

I WAS concerned when I read Nancy Wylie's article on bus travel in
which she described her perceptions of a journey from her home in
Glenrothes to Johnstone via Buchanan bus station (February 11).
Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive, while being responsible for
the operations of the bus station, has no control over timetables or
journey times of the operators' buses or for that matter the intervening
time between services.
SPTE, authorised by Strathclyde Regional Council, has, since securing
the lease of the bus station and with funds from both the regional
council and the European Union through the Strathclyde Integrated
Development Fund, embarked on a programme designed to transform an old
deteriorating bus station into one that would be worthy of the City of
Architecture and Design 1999.
The work is now almost complete but it is recognised that passengers,
staff, and operators have, by necessity, had to coexist with
construction activities so that the refurbishment work could be
undertaken. Care has however been taken to minimise passenger
inconvenience.
Up-to-date information now is shown on a bank of TV monitors in the
main concourse complementing the staffed Travel Centre which provides
travel information and tickets. In addition, staff around the bus
station ensure the safe movement of vehicles and are happy to assist
passengers with travel inquiries.
Other amenities for passengers include a manned left-luggage and
lost-property section, and fully refurbished toilets with a disabled and
baby-changing facility, all of which are overseen by an attendant.
Retail services such as a cafe/restaurant and kiosks together with
telephones are all available.
It is unfortunate that Nancy Wylie experienced difficulties but we are
confident that anyone using the completed bus station will be impressed
by the general appearance, convenience, and information provision.

THE ''environmental activists'' of Earth First may be the only people
chaining themselves to bulldozers and scuffling with security guards in
protest at the M77 Ayr road route, but there are many others who are
wholeheartedly against this new motorway for very sound social,
economic, and environmental reasons.
Respectable, mainstream organisations such as the Scottish Wildlife
Trust, World Wide Fund for Nature, and Friends of the Earth are all
committed to stopping this ridiculous scheme, even if we are not
involved in the theatrical confrontations.
We are supported by local MPs, MEPs, community councils, and the
Strathclyde Labour Party. Glasgow District Council is opposed to the
road and so are many thousands of ordinary, sensible, thinking Scots.
Strathclyde Regional Council's victory at the 1988 public inquiry does
not mean that it would still win in 1995. Recent evidence says they
would not. Even the UK Government has recently recognised that radial
urban motorways which encourage commuting by car into crowded urban
centres are environmentally and economically obsolete.
The world changes. We still hope that the council will face facts and
change its decision, too, before it is too late.

PROPERTY consultants and retail chains are not known for their concern
for town centres and so it is not surprising that they are opposed to
the new planning guidelines which are designed to protect Scotland's
town centres from out-of-town retail developments.
For too long they have had things their own way at the cost of
thousands of town-centre businesses and jobs. Now the pendulum swings
the other way, they don't like it.
Property consultants Smith Newiss are reported by you as saying: ''No
amount of Government protection can save a town centre that is dying on
its feet -- artificial protection only prolongs the agony.''
So remove the life-support tubes and give the blood transfusion to the
over-healthy retail hypermarkets on the periphery. This will result in
what is known in the US as the ''doughnut effect'': the dead centre and
the live periphery.
Is that really what people want?
That is the understandable view of those who see every green field as
a potential development, the community near it as only a potential
market, and the historic centre of a town as an irrelevance.
Not for them consideration of the tourist or the business owner whose
livelihood is invested in a business or in his or her employee.
The retail multiple sees such developments as a means of extracting
money from the local economy and exporting it as fast as possible to its
multinational head office elsewhere.
Our reputation as an organisation is as one voice that has constantly
warned about the dozens of out-of-town developments. We have placed
these arguments before councils (many of whom have agreed with us) and
given evidence to dozens of public inquiries.
We were dogged by the edict that concern about the effect on existing
businesses cannot be a planning consideration.
Thank God, at long last, the pendulum is swinging the other way.

PIGS don't fly in Paras Over the Barras. All the same it is a small
miracle of a little book. With luck it could become a Glasgow classic.
Already it may be one. Readers best able to enjoy a tale of the twilight
of the city's tenement life have seized on it like the last potato scone
on the cake-stand.
The characters have become instant old friends. Published at the start
of this month, the book might have been around for half of this century.
In a way so it has. To pick it up, though, took the enthusiasm of
James Barclay, a former newspaper writer of gnarled experience. Add his
shy notion to revive city folklore. Top off with persistence to see his
memories into print. Finally, ice with laughter.
Like the author, much of the humour is quiet and dark. His ear for the
patois is keen. And, yes, he gets a pig into it.
Part of a condensed epic of a sub-plot involves a deid pig that's
wheeched out an upstairs window. It lands at the feet of a young mother
with a pram. Fresh from the chapel, she has prayed for some decent grub
to give her man a proper ham-and-egg breakfast.
She's Irish. She cries: ''Oh, Mother of Mercy. You didn't waste any
time. I only put a penny in the box and I only asked ye for a wee bit
extra ham . . . and you've went and gone the whole hog.''
Out of context and wrapped in newsprint such fun can look pallid.
Let's risk it. For another quickie it is necessary to meet two of the
book's people and know about briquettes.
Once upon a time coal dust got compressed into a cube. That was a
briquette; it may still be. Probably not, however, in an East End grown
pretty posh compared with during the Hitler war, the period of Paras
Over the Barras (dire title). Now new houses have patios; people kept
coal in the kitchen then.
Sometimes they were reduced to briquettes which burned slowly with a
sullen glow.
Keeping her home fire burning is Annie, an unobtrusive central
character of Jim Barclay's book. Away at the war is her husband, Big
Sammy, described as a dependable bloke who laughed a lot when he had his
teeth in.
In the book Annie stays at the same address in downtown Calton as Jim
Barclay did in his childhood, except the house is not there any more and
the street where he lived has been razed. He recalled: ''There was an
Annie in every street. She was the one who knew how to deliver babies
and what to do if a wean took green spots. There was always an Annie.''
He creates a scene with Annie at home to Ina McLatchie, a large
spinster lady from across the landing. ''I like big women,'' Jim Barclay
said. ''I think they all have lovely faces.'' In his book he describes
Ina as moon-faced, like the Creamola custard advertisement.
Another visitor is young Curdy McVey with whom Annie and Ina are
talking about death, or Curdy is talking, being an undertaker's
apprentice. He tells how his dad died in the street, waiting for the
coalman's cart to come.
''Did he have a heart attack, son?'' Annie asks.
''Naw, he got knocked doon by the hoarse,'' Curdy says. ''It stamped
a' ower ma da's face. It was called Dainty.''
''Whit did yer maw dae?'' Annie asks softly.
''Luckily she had some briquettes,'' Curdy replies.
In harsher and truer tones are echoes of the McFlannels, a radio show
that once held the nation in thrall, with the singular exception of Jim
Barclay. Before his book he had not heard of the McFlannel family. He
never listened to the wireless for the adequate reason there wasn't a
set until he was 14.
Age divides his readership. For his tale is of two cities --
accessible as yesterday if you remember that the big Odeon pictures used
to be called the Paramount; remote as a foreign country to a generation
that doesn't know about briquettes.
Serialisation last summer in the Sunday Post helped close the gap.
They made a big fuss about Jim Barclay's first published book,
advertising it on hoardings. Booksellers have displayed it by the
windowful.
His work was not always so welcomed. In the beginning it was a
television script. When BBC Scotland kept it, Jim Barclay waited for
exactly a year to the day before he asked what they thought. In three
more days he had his play back.
''Because I'd run out of things to write about, I turned it into a wee
book,'' he recalled. Two publishers then rejected it. Then one day he
bumped into an old newspaper mate who had started a small press. And the
rest is Glasgow history as it has seldom been written before.
Jim Barclay demurred: ''Wait a minute. I just set out to make people
laugh. It is just a wee nostalgic book. Still, it might encourage young
budding authors to keep trying -- or even decrepit old ones,'' he added.
He's 58.

TRUTH may be an absolute, but that doesn't mean it is always easy to
find. This is a problem which our legal system (indeed, any legal
system) has always wrestled with, but it is at its most difficult and
most distressing in cases of alleged child sex abuse. The sorry affair
of the eight Ayrshire children taken into care in 1990 and ordered to be
returned to their parents by the Court of Session yesterday illustrates
the agonising nature of the problem perfectly. There have been two
hearings into the case over the years, four senior counsel have been
involved, and the cost could reach several million pounds. Yet at the
end of it all the result is far from satisfactory in the sense of any
perception of truth established. Sheriff Miller, who has conducted the
review of the case which has led to the Court of Session's decision,
confesses himself frustrated. In reviewing the evidence he finds himself
unconvinced of the Reporter to the Children's Panel's case, but is
similarly uncertain of the truth of what is undoubtedly a horribly
complex and disturbing affair.
This failure to arrive at the truth matters a great deal, not least to
the children who may have been separated from their parents without
justification, but also to the parents who have not been convicted of
any offence but who have not been cleared in sufficiently explicit
terms. This is a deplorable situation and Lord Hope, the Lord President
of the Court of Session, and all of those involved clearly find it so.
It could be prevented from happening if the proof advanced in such cases
were capable of being assessed on an objective basis leading to a firm
and objective opinion. Unfortunately, this rarely happens because the
nature of the evidence is almost always capable of holding different
interpretations. Physical evidence of sexual abuse is a case in point.
The basic physical evidence given to Sheriff Miller, who has rejected
it, is largely the same evidence as was given earlier to Sheriff Gow,
who accepted it. The evidence has not changed to all intents and
purposes, but the interpretation drawn from it most certainly has.
Similarly, the testimonies given by the children is capable, as is any
child's narrative, of being understood in different ways.
If the parents of the Ayrshire children are left with feelings of
distress and anger, it must be said with some hope that a case of this
sort would be unlikely to develop in the same way again. The allegations
of abuse were placed five years ago at a time when the undercurrent of
sexual abuse of children, which had always existed in society, was
beginning to surface. Training in interviewing children and recording
their evidence in cases of this sort was almost unknown. Since then the
procedures and guidelines which have been established are far more
stringent and the supervision, recording, and processing of cases is
immeasurably better detailed and established. Nevertheless, there is no
room for complacency. Lord Hope believes that a tragedy of immeasurable
proportions has occurred in this case and he is right. His call for
enhanced powers for senior courts which would allow the revision of
doubtful cases as an established procedure is only sensible and should
form part of the Children (Scotland) Bill. Nevertheless, like Sheriff
Miller, we are left with a feeling of frustration. Whether we like it or
not, doubt is a frequent fellow traveller in the search for the truth
about sexual abuse.

BY the end of trading yesterday the world's stockmarkets had absorbed
the Barings disaster rather well. Their traders accepted the view of the
Bank of England's Governor, Eddie George, that the affair was a one-off
event, in spite of its scale. Sterling was hit hard, reflecting the fact
that the real loss falls on this country and the assets tied up in
Barings Bank. The losses cannot yet be fully quantified for they are
open-ended, being in futures contracts on the Tokyo stock exchange which
have yet to expire. That fact prevented Barings from being saved. Many
other British and foreign banks did indeed want to try to rescue it, for
its name is famous and respected, but understandably none was willing to
take on an open-ended commitment. Neither the Governor of the Bank of
England nor the Chancellor was willing to deploy public money to saving
the bank in such circumstances either. Their prudence is justified. Many
of the bank's businesses will eventually be saved -- and sold -- and
fears of redundancies may be exaggerated. The same hope does not extend
so widely to those British charities which were major beneficiaries of
the bank's earnings, though even there perhaps not all has been lost.
It remains astonishing that one person, in a relatively short space of
time, could establish a huge financial exposure with such devastating
consequences. It seems obvious that the bank's control systems were
either lacking or easily capable of being circumvented. Every
institution trading in derivatives will be examining its own structures
and their monitoring; and the Chancellor has promised a thorough
examination of existing procedures to see how they can be improved. It
certainly looks as if the Singapore and Osaka stock exchanges, where the
deals were done, were deficient; though the main responsibility falls on
Barings itself. When all is said and done, however, it will remain
possible for traders, in what are now global markets, to get their
businesses into serious trouble when dealing on any scale in highly
geared financial instruments. The exact nature of what transpired at
Barings awaits a formal report of the internal investigation into the
transactions, or a detailed statement from the trader, who has
disappeared.
Inevitably, there will be a call to prevent trading in derivatives
altogether. That would be like blaming horses for the faults of their
riders. Derivatives are old established instruments -- often used as
prudent ways of containing, or hedging, possible losses. Their variety
has multiplied in recent years and the, so-called, globalisation of
international markets has encouraged this trend. Any attempt to regulate
their trading will have to be international, as can be seen at once from
Barings, a British company operating, in this case, out of Singapore in
Japanese stock markets. Three sets of regulatory authorities are
involved. This experience is now commonplace. It may easily have led to
lax control, but what it requires is more rigorous oversight.
Derivatives, however, of their nature can also be riskier than normal
securities and should compel closer scrutiny. That will sound like
wisdom after the event, as it partly is, but the House of Commons
Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee had anticipated it, though
its report has yet to be published.

THE circumstances are so exceptional that reuniting the children with
their parents will have to be phased, with the time-scale still to be
agreed. The process could take months. For now, both parents and
children will have to make do with increased residential access.
The court was told of the extreme difficulties caused by the
children's removal under place of safety orders:
* One child was seven months old when removed along with three others
from the one family -- and it is not known if she can even remember her
parents;
* The parents of three have been denied access since 1992;
* In one case, visits were ruled out because they had proved so
traumatic for the child when her parents were forced to leave, and;
* Only the 15-year-old girl was with a foster mother, who acknowledged
it was in the child's best interests to be with her natural parents
because ''I cannot replace her mother''.
Seven of the children have remained together in a special unit but
have not been allowed to mix with others in care since 1990.
They were formally told yesterday of the ruling that they must be
reunited with their parents. They were also informed that contact would
be re-established as soon as possible and that the court would send them
home once satisfied that no more damage could be caused.
The news was broken by a curator appointed more than a year ago to act
in the children's best interests.
The court agreed that she was the best person for the job, especially
because it would allow her to fulfil a promise to the children that they
would be fully appraised of the judges' decisions.
Much of the work leading up to reunions will be done by Dr John
Powell, a consultant child psychologist based at Crichton Royal
Infirmary, Dumfries, and by clinical psychologist Christine Puckering.
Dr Powell is respected for his experience in dealing with such
sensitive matters and the integration in particular of families which
have been broken up by the authorities. He was appointed by Lord Clyde
to interview all the children involved in the Orkney child sex scandal
and report his findings to the public inquiry.
Dr Puckering, a lecturer at Glasgow University, is also an expert in
coping with the mental anguish caused when children have been torn from
their parents without justification in the end.
Both will have to explain the events surrounding such a distressing
and appalling case which bears remarkable similarities to Orkney, only
worse -- if such a concept is possible.
In particular, they will have to explain the zeal of those supposed to
have been acting in their best interests even after strenuous denials of
abuse.
This zeal included swoops in which a four-year-old boy was taken from
a nursery and a nine-year-old girl from school.
Almost five years of their lives have been scarred despite solicitors
ridiculing the evidence and their parents' struggle for justice.
Their parents allege that social workers were on a power trip and that
the system was terribly wrong. They now want to be left alone to rebuild
their lives.
At one point, up to 70 adults and children were reputedly involved in
the inquiry into allegations of a ring of vice involving extreme sadism,
ritualistic abuse, and torture.

Anne Simpson meets Glenys Kinnock in Brussels where already the new
MEP is trying to break down barriers.
INSIDE her small Brussels office, Glenys Kinnock moves with svelt,
efficiency and charm through a morning crammed with lobbyists and
appointments. By 11am German Television, the Wildlife Trust and the
Tibet Support Group have been and gone, each one impressed with her
practical grasp of complex issues, her commitment to children's rights,
and the developing world.
On the outer side of her door there is a poster proclaiming: Welsh is
Wondrous. But even against the big battalions, Glenys need scarcely
assert her national pride. She arrived as an MEP after last year's
European Elections with two potent credentials: a British
record-breaking majority of 120,000 votes -- in fact 74% of her South
Wales East constituency; and a high international profile etched as much
with Welshness as Labour politics.
Today, she has no time for the type of confrontational posturing that
so much defines British parliamentary debate. ''I would never go back to
that system, even if the Labour Party allowed MEPs to do so. There is
simply nothing about the cut-and-thrust of Westminster that I miss.''
Nevertheless, in 1992 no-one felt the pain of Labour's loss in the
General Election more acutely than Glenys. Since 1983, when Neil Kinnock
gained the leadership of the party and began his battle to revive its
flagging spirit, Glenys had been a very visible and influential consort,
the couple's ''conscience'', according to many, and ''Glenys the
Menace'' to those who resented her unelected authority.
And, as Hillary Clinton was later to discover at the hands of
Republicans, Glenys was the target for Tory rubbishing. Bossy and
ambitious were the two words most often hurled in her direction by
Conservatives, but what they didn't realise was that this daughter of an
Anglesey signalman had never been frightened off from expressing her
opinions, even at her own expense.
At Cardiff University, where she and her husband met, Glenys and Neil
were respectively dubbed the Power and the Glory. And now that they are
both in Brussels, he as Transport Commissioner, the label resides again
in the vocabulary of every Euro pundit.
For Glenys especially a period of self-imposed purdah from publicity
followed the '92 defeat, although she continued her work as a teacher
and for the Third World. But there is no doubt now that Glenys in Europe
commands attention in her own right.
Even before she was sworn in at the European Parliament's inaugural
plenary she had captured a prize role; that of senior vice-president in
the ACP. A considerable force in the developing world, the ACP consists
of 66 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries associated with the EU by
the Lome Convention which sends parliamentarians to formal sessions with
MEPs.
Among her duties is the monitoring of Commission funds earmarked for
the Third World, and although she has been heartened recently by the
support given to her call for multi-million pound increases in
overseas-aid spending, Glenys Kinnock fears that already we have
forgotten the horrific scale of Rwanda's legacy from war.
''Africa's poverty continues to increase and we just can't walk
away,'' she says. ''But are people listening? I'm not so sure they are.
I've just been in Rwanda and there the Red Cross showed me a mass grave
where they buried 67,000 victims with their own hands. There are refugee
camps there the size of Birmingham.
''Smaller countries like Scotland and Ireland have always been most
responsive in providing aid, along with the Dutch, Austrians and Swedes.
But if I can't convince more people in the EU of the need to take a
moral stand on the issue of world poverty, then I tell them the problem
is like a boomerang and it will visit them too with the rise of
fundamentalism, increased drugs trafficking and the movement of
refugees.''
Her other specific areas of concern revolve around the rights of women
and children, and she points out that whatever the meagre improvements
in Britain none has been initiated by the Tory Government but is the
result of European pressure.
''On the matter of paternity leave, for instance, Mr Portillo came
here and led everyone to believe it would be all right. Then he stamped
his foot against what was a minimal gesture in supporting family life.
Yet if you have a Government so keen on family values you would think
that a policy allowing fathers some time with their new-born babies
would be easy to accommodate. It's just embarrassing, really.''
Twenty-five per cent of the European Parliament is composed of women,
compared with only 9% at Westminster. There is also a women's rights
committee to ensure that issues such as maternity care, etc, are central
to any agenda.
''You simply can't imagine that at home. MPs would just be crawling
about laughing, which is why women politicians find Brussels a much more
conducive atmosphere to get things done. It's not a case of facing your
enemy across a barrier as in the House of Commons. We work for a
consensus, a compromise across committees.''
To be part of such a movement, she says, ''to be going forward,
developing ideas and increasing powers for the only democratic aspect of
the European institutuon'', is both vital and exciting. ''I really see
the future here. Of course, there are things wrong. We've got to work
for more openness and accountability and to stop the wasteful elements
of the EU. But I invited John Hume to address a visitors' group in
Strasbourg before Christmas and he asked them to remember what had been
going on in that French town near the German border 50 years ago.
''He spoke so movingly about how different nationalities, which had
been killing one another in the most monstrous ways, were now working
together. The people listening had tears streaming down their faces, and
he said he would never have believed what had been achieved recently in
Northern Ireland if his working in the EU had not given him hope. I
found that very evocative.''
What she seeks is a fruitful exchange of information between the home
and European parliaments rather than obstruction all the way. ''My
preference would be for a much closer relationship in the style of
Denmark whose scrutiny committees examine legislation before it goes
from Brussels to the national parliament, so that politicians can follow
things through at every stage.
''I don't believe the British people want to paddle in sewage and
drink dirty water, and when the Tories say that a clean-up will cost too
much . . . well, people aren't daft. They say how-come the bosses of the
utilities are paid so lavishly and make such profits if that's the
situation.''
Such is the graceless nature of Britain's official position in the
European Union today that it would hardly surprise anyone if the other
members of the club suddenly ran every Union-Jacked begrudger out of
Brussels. It would never happen so brazenly, of course, but the other
day the former Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe, felt compelled to warn
that if Britain makes the EU ''unworkable'' then France, Germany and
their friends ''will find other solutions to exclude us''.
During recent weeks the EU's forbearance has struck many British
Europhiles as a symptom of political maturity. But Glenys Kinnock
suspects there may also be an element of drop-jawed astonishment mixed
in with the tolerance.
In Brussels a stunned composure has met Lord Tebbit's harangue that
European laws are ''unjust, odious, obnoxious, and unfair''. Had any
other country stoked the coals of xenophobia with such language against
Britain, would our response have been so patient? Glenys Kinnock thinks
not: ''It's just a terrible shame that as soon as the British Government
has a problem in its own party, it allows people to wrap themselves in
the Union Jack and talk of Brussels meddling.''
At 50 Glenys Kinnock is not untypical of many professional women who
are enjoying their own role, their own identity in a manner unknown to
them before. Even so there are still those who cannot tell one
Euro-Kinnock from the other. Her phone rings frequently with callers
requesting the Commissioner, and he, in turn, receives a share of
inquiries seeking Glenys, the MEP.
In Brussels, where their son also works as a party researcher, the
couple live in a purposely unexceptional terrace house, about five
minutes' walk from the Commission and the Parliament buildings. In fact
their new home's only real distinction lies in the piquancy of the
previous owner's political persuasion: it belonged to Daily Telegraph's
Boris Johnson, known in his day, as the most piratical anti-European in
town.

THE decision yesterday by the Court of Session, to return eight
Ayrshire children to their parents, coincided with the fourth
anniversary of the ''dawn raids'' on the Orkney Island of South
Ronaldsay.
At about 7am on that day, police and social workers arrived at four
houses on the island and removed nine children and took them into care
because of allegations of organised abuse.
Last night, one of the South Ronaldsay mothers told The Herald: ''We
are delighted for the Ayrshire families. Five years, it really is
appalling.
''We knew them to be innocent and we know the trauma they have
suffered.''
She asked when it would be realised that the same names of officials
kept cropping up. ''When will they have to account for their actions?''
she added.
Four years ago, the Church of Scotland minister in St Margaret's Hope,
New Zealand-born Morris McKenzie, was being questioned over allegations
of ''lewd and libidinous practices''.
The following day, the Thursday, the news was broken to stunned
islanders by local newspaper The Orcadian. By Friday, there was open
talk of ritualistic abuse, satanic rites, and of police taking away a
number of curious articles -- a hooded cloak, a gas lamp, a
shepherd-style crook, a detective novel with a goat on the front cover.
The social work department and the police said they had been acting on
information received.
It subsequently emerged in the Court of Session that the information
had come from three other children taken into care from Orkney, whose
father was in prison for physical and sexual abuse. These were members
of what became known as the W family.
Their father had been jailed in January 1987, but the authorities were
concerned by allegations of inter-sibling sexual abuse. By November
1990, eight of the W family were in care. Six remain in care to this
day. The case of one, a 13-yeard-old boy, is due to be heard in Kirkwall
Sheriff Court in April. A vociferous campaign continues for the
children's return.
On March 5, 1991, a Children's Hearing in Kirkwall agreed that the
nine South Ronaldsay children should remain in care as inquries
continued. The following day the parents appealed against the ruling in
Kirkwall Sheriff Court, but Sheriff Principal Ronald Ireland refused the
appeal.
However, On April 4, Sheriff David Kelbie dismissed a proof hearing of
the case, ridiculing the allegations. Within hours Orkney social work
department had organised a plane and that night the nine children, who
had been in care on the mainland, were re-united with their parents. Two
weeks later, the Secretary of State announced a judicial inquiry under
Lord Clyde.
On June 12, Scotland's senior judge, Lord Hope, upheld an appeal
against Sheriff Kelbie's ruling and censured him. Lord Hope said that
Sheriff Kelbie had clearly breached the laws of natural justice and
disqualified him from taking any further part in the proceedings. He had
failed in his duty to the parents, children, and the Reporter to the
Children's Panel.
Seven days later, Mr Lang announced the remit of Lord Clyde's inquiry.
It was wide-ranging, but what Lord Clyde was not asked to explore was
whether there was any truth in the allegations of organised sexual
abuse, or whether any of the nine children had been abused. That has
never been examined in any court.
Lord Clyde's inquiry began in Kirkwall on September 26, 1991, and sat
for eight months, during which time a reported #6m of public money was
spent. In October of the following year, Lord Clyde reported.
He said social workers and police ''acted too precipitately and failed
to take time to think.'' There had been many mistakes made, but Lord
Clyde said they had been made in good faith.
He also stressed that the parents of the nine children had to be
presumed innocent. Last night one of the parents told the Herald: ''The
presumption of innocence has not been enough.
''We have never been able to clear our names. A case currently in the
House of Lords will decide whether an individual can sue an authority.
Once that is clear, we will sue the council for damages as the only way
we can clear ourselves.''

After Saturday night's fight, claims that throwing punches is sport
have a hollow ring.
SOME humans derive pleasure from killing other creatures and make
sport of the slaughter. Such perversity is rare or unknown among other
forms of animal life which means, in this respect, we are sub-animal.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not an animal nut, but to kill for fun seems
to me an obscenity. Such cruelty and insensitivity to the pain and
suffering of others, including lesser animals, are the dark side of the
human psyche.
We also ritualise cruelty to each other and call it sport. We've
banned cock-fighting and dog-fights but man-fights are legal. Young men
are paid to injure, damage, maim, and even kill one another in a boxing
ring for the titillation of those who enjoy the spectacle.
On Saturday nights, courtesy of ITV you can see from the comfort of
your home young brains being scrambled. Young faces being repaired so
that they might continue being battered for another three minutes.
Last Saturday night the nation could watch as two superbly fit young
blacks punched one another on the head for more than half an hour until
one succumbed and ended up on a life-support machine in the
intensive-care unit of a London hospital.
I mention their colour because boxers are always the sons of the poor,
for nobody would choose boxing as a career except those for whom it was
the only way out of the ghetto. In our society today blacks are at the
bottom of the pile and professional boxing, already a moral cesspit, has
acquired a new sick racial dimension.
It is now largely a matter of whites watching blacks damage each
other. If punches aren't being traded the referee will stop the fight on
the grounds that the boxers aren't trying. Purses can then be withheld.
This is seldom needed, for the boxers know what's expected of them.
They've got to take punishment and dish it out. On Saturday night there
were no complaints. Scores of heavy punches to the heads were greeted
with delirious acclamation by spectators. The commentators were
ecstatic.
After the torrid violence was over Nigel Benn was being feted in the
ring by the usual throng of chancers and hangers on while Gerald
McClellan, the young American, was lying prostrate in his corner
receiving medical attention and with an oxygen mask covering the lower
part of his face.
A commentator opined that the loser had lost heart and had packed it
in rather than fight on. The ITV producers who could see what was
happening on their monitors allowed one of their men to clamber into the
ring for an interview with the winner who spewed out the customary
triumphalist machismo crap that is an essential part of the fight hype.
All the while the young American was manifestly fighting for his life.
Nobody asked for the ring to be cleared. The frenzied jubilation
continued as people skirted past the stricken McClellan. The absence of
compassion or even concern was brutally chilling. Nigel Benn's first
response when told of McClellan's serious plight was: ''Better him than
me.''
Watching all this from the ringside, confined to a wheel-chair, was
Michael Watson, who had been permanently brain-damaged in a fight with
Chris Eubank.
The apologists for the fight game were quick off the mark. A
Department of Health spokesman said: ''If we banned boxing it would go
underground and it would not be regulated as it is now.'' If this is
true then it's an argument for legalising drugs, political sleaze, child
prostitution, and under-age drinking.
Virginia Bottomley's solution ''discussions to make sure that the
proper precautions are being taken''. Like banning punches? Labour's Tom
Pendry added his tuppenceworth, demanding reassurances that boxing's
governing body was doing everything it could to minimise the risk of
injury. But it's the inevitability of injury that draws the crowds and
the money for it appeals to the sadistic streak that clearly resides in
many humans.
All of this evades the moral argument. People can be injured and
killed in leisure and sporting activities or crossing a road. BUT when
this happens it's either an accident or violation of rules or laws.
In boxing damage is integral to the aims and objectives of the
contest. A knock-out almost by definition is an assault on the brain of
such severity as to render your opponent unconscious for at least 10
seconds. Death is an implicit possibility in such an exercise and when
it occurs cannot be called an accident.
As someone who believes that human progress should be measured by
whether we are less cruel and more sensitive, to me boxing is an
obscenity. There is no evidence to suggest that we're irrevocably and
genetically programmed to be vicious. The human brain is the wonder of
the universe. We have consciences. Humans have sacrificed their lives
for fellow human beings. We have the capacity to love and therefore
shouldn't pander to humanity's baser elements.
We belong to the same species as Aristotle, Michelangelo, Da Vinci,
Galileo, Thomas Muir, Shakespeare, Goethe, Descartes, Rembrandt,
Beethoven, Burns, Mozart, Newton, Christ, Mahatma Ghandi, Mohammed,
Einstein, Martin Luther King, Pope John XXIII. The Rev George McLeod,
and millions more men and women who have shown the heights to which
humans can aspire both individually and collectively. Boxing in essence
is barbaric and has no place in a civilised society which honours all
that is good in our heritage.

AT the High Court in Glasgow yesterday, Edward Currie, 25, of
Dundasvale Court, Cowcaddens, Glasgow, was jailed for four years after
admitting drug dealing in Possilpark, Glasgow, between March and
November last year. When arrested, Currie confessed to police he had
ingested 30 deals of heroin and believed one had burst. He was rushed to
hospital where a balloon packed with 15 half gramme bags of heroin worth
#600 was recovered.

THE number of place of safety orders for children in Scotland has
dropped significantly, from 1373 in 1990 to 866 in 1993, despite a
continuing rise in the number of children referred as in need of care
and protection.
That is seen in some quarters as evidence of the chastening effect of
the public row over the removal and the subsequent return of nine
children from Orkney. The Ayrshire case of eight children has been
rumbling on in the background for longer than that.
Yesterday's ruling, however, comes in the wake of the widely-approved
report by Lord Clyde into the Orkney case and the incorporation of many
of his recommendations into the long-awaited Children (Scotland) Bill,
which returns to committee stage today.
Its most radical provision (not yet discussed by the committee) is for
the exclusion of an alleged abuser from the family home instead of the
removal of the child or children.
The measure -- originally proposed by the Scottish Office in the White
Paper Scotland's Children -- has wide support from child welfare
organisations.
Significantly, it is also backed by the British Association of Social
Workers, which is consistently condemned as the villains of the piece
when grounds for referral are disputed.
In cases where one member of a household has been alleged to have
abused a child, the exclusion order has the obvious merits of keeping
the child in her own home and with the rest of her family.
The working party set up by the British Association of Social Workers
to consider the proposal recognised that such orders will have
repercussions both for the alleged abuser and the rest of the family.
They duck the question of cases where the allegations are of organised
abuse involving a number of people -- as in both Orkney and Ayrshire.
''These cases are extremely difficult and the Government should issue
detailed guidance of best practice,'' says the association.
It acknowledges that considerable personal hardship could be suffered
by an alleged abuser whose exclusion becomes public knowledge, and says
that exclusion orders should be without prejudice to any subsequent
action in relation to criminal or other proceedings.
In other words, they could help to reduce the trauma suffered by the
child but still leave the thorny problem at the centre of all these
cases: how to establish whether abuse has taken place and by whom.
The initial guidance to social workers -- when in doubt, err on the
side of protecting the child -- has been shown to be simplistic. The
question yet to be answered is how to take unprejudiced evidence from
children.
Most people will be shocked to learn that our vaunted Children's
Hearings system does not offer children the same protection as witnesses
in criminal cases. Alan Miller, Reporter for Dumfries and Galloway, who
will be Principal Reporter under the re-organisation of local
government, sees an opportunity for improvement in practice.
''There is now a battery of protection available in criminal
proceedings for children giving evidence, but children's hearings have
no provision for live TV links or a child's evidence taken by commission
and we would like to see these included in the Children (Scotland) Bill.
A number of MPs have expressed interest in putting forward amendements
on these lines.
''There are other protection measures specifically for criminal
proceedings, for example the protection of victims from questions about
their sexual behaviour which is not extended to children in hearings and
children have been asked detailed and intrusive questions which would
not have been allowed in a criminal trial. There is a general proposal
to improve the protection of child witnesses and great deal can be done
by borrowing what is already available in other spheres,'' he said.
The four-and-a-half years of family life lost to the Ayrshire children
and their parents is the irredeemable tragedy of this case. It is also a
painful lesson in how even the most carefully-designed system can
self-destruct.

It has been absolute hell on earth for the parents. It is hard to
imagine a worse tragedy for them. Nobody who has not spoken to them can
imagine how hellish it has been.
Lawyer Paul Burns
PARENTS wept in court as the Lord President, Lord Hope, told them
their children will be sent home as soon as possible without causing
further damage to the children's welfare.
Some of the parents were so frightened they might only be ''dreaming''
that they later refused to say anything in case the ''nightmare'' which
has lasted since June 1990 returned.
Even in victory, smiles were few and far between. Their loathing of
social workers and others involved in the original allegations of
satanic-style paedophile orgies was clear -- and underlined when counsel
for the Reporter to the Children's Panel announced an appeal will be
lodged.
His turgid legal arguments in support of the appeal were in stark
contrast to the emotional drama which had just unfolded in the Court of
Session.
The circumstances in which the eight children have been kept since
their unjustified removal brought gasps of horror.
However, the three families were also told that only one of the eight
children would be released immediately from care.
Her parents raced from the court, en route to a 3pm reunion at a
Renfrewshire school. The girl was aged 10 when taken into care. Now aged
15, she has consistently demanded she be allowed to return home.
Her mother, in tears, said: ''I am very happy, so delighted. I cannot
believe it is happening. It's just so good.''
Asked for her views of those who took her daughter into care, she
replied: ''What can I say? I just don't like them. I just hope what
happened to us never happens to anyone else, ever.''
The reunited family may now go on holiday. However, it was too early
to say precisely what they will do because events had moved so swiftly.
One father said: ''It's like a dream after all these years,'' while
another commented: ''The last four or five years have been hell. I could
not believe it can happen to anyone.''
He added: ''There are no words to explain it. I could not believe that
what we went through could happen to anybody.
''I handed my girl into these people for tests or whatever it was.
They said I would get her back in two or three days -- and it was five
years.''
One mother broke down, unable to speak, but another described the last
five years as ''torture'' and declared: ''It has been terrible. I would
not want any other family to go through what me and my husband have been
through.''
She blamed social workers for the tragedy.
Lawyer Paul Burns was delighted at the court's decisions. He said:
''It confirmed what we have said all along, but the parents' lives have
been completely shattered. As Lord Hope said, it is a tragedy of immense
proportions.''
Mr Burns said the affair was ''in many ways a bigger miscarriage of
justice than the Birmingham Six'' and added: ''It will now take a great
deal of work to put these families together again, and that's what we
will now be getting on with.
''It has been absolute hell on earth for the parents. It is hard to
imagine a worse tragedy for them.
''Nobody who has not spoken to them can imagine how hellish it has
been.''
Lawyer Gerry Brown said the appeal will have no bearing on the
children's phased, but speedy, return home, and added: ''It is to be
hoped that procedures are set up within the Children (Scotland) Bill to
prevent anything like this happening again.''
The three judges who considered Sheriff Miller's report have called a
hearing for Monday when it is hoped recommendations will be in place to
have the children returned to their families.
Two families were granted permission to name special safeguarders who
will have the task of ensuring no more damage is caused.
However, they failed -- for the moment -- to have social workers
connected with the case banned from any future contact with the
children.
According to Mr Gordon Jackson and other Queen's Counsel, the families
remain uneasy about social workers criticised by Sheriff Miller still
having responsibility for the day-to-day care of the children.
That situation is likely to change within days as the complex process
of reuniting the families takes shape and new supervisory arrangements
are put in place.

SCOTTISH Liberal Democrats are to challenge the Government over the
financial cost of running Motorail and the Fort William sleeper
services.
They have instructed party officials to investigate the calculations
behind the decision to withdraw the rail links.
In the House of Commons today Liberal Democrat MP for Ross, Cromarty
and Skye Charles Kennedy will ask John Major about the economic impact
of rail privatisation on the economy of the Highlands and Islands.
Liberal Democrat chiefs claim the Government believes the Motorail and
Fort William sleeper services are losing around #9m a year, a figure
described by Sir Russell Johnston (Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber) as
''quite unbelievable''.
Speaking after handing in a 3000-name petition against rail
privatisation to the Scottish Office Sir Russell, the party's transport
spokesman said: ''The calculations are just ridiculous.
''The Government's argument against retaining Motorail and the Fort
William sleeper hinges on the amount they claim these services cost.
''The figures which they have conjured up thus far are quite
unbelievable. They take no account of the cost of scrapping the rolling
stock or the potential for expansion within the services.
''We are undertaking an investigation to work out the true cost of
running these services.
''The deep confusion which exists is yet another reason for the
Government to redeem its pledge of a formal consultation on the future
of these services before they are closed.''
Sir Russell said the Government should be learning from the experience
of other European countries who were expanding Motorail services.
''The increased use of Motorail across Europe casts further doubt on
the wisdom of closing our services,'' said Sir Russell.
''Inquiries with the European Commission are under way to try to
establish why the rail services which the Government is cutting as part
of the privatisation proposals continue to expand on the Continent.''
He went on to describe the Fort William sleeper service as a ''ghost
train'' because it had never been properly marketed to the public.
A Department of Transport spokesman said she had no hard and fast
figure for the amount of money the services were losing.
However, she added that a subsidy of #453 per passenger was needed on
the Fort William sleeper service and that the line was not heavily used.
A spokesman for InterCity said it had been made clear a major subsidy
was already in place for the service.
ScotRail confirmed yesterday that it has withdrawn proposals to
transfer eight Fort William-based railmen to Mallaig, where the depot
was to have been upgraded and staff doubled to 18.
The four drivers and four conductors will remain instead at Fort
William, with the Mallaig workforce staying at nine.
Talks are continuing over the proposed 12 redundancies at Fort William
which will result from the depot's downgrading and the threatened loss
of the sleeper and Motorail services.
The latest moves follow negotiations between ScotRail management and
the railmen's union, the RMT. There had been calls for a ballot for
industrial action among the Fort William employees.

FORMER Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart, who resigned recently
after a clash with motorway protesters, urged the Government during the
debate to act against ''illegal'' anti-road demonstrations.
''It's not about trees, it's not about roads,'' he told the Commons.
''It's about whether or not people can act illegally against the law
that this House passes.''
Mr Stewart resigned his Ministerial post earlier this month after he
seized a pickaxe in a confrontation in his Eastwood constituency with
protesters against the M77, which would link Ayrshire with the Glasgow
motorway system.
During the debate he raised the anti-motorway rally attended by some
1500 people in Glasgow on Saturday claiming the crowd had made an
illegal six-mile march to the Pollok Free State camp set up in the path
of the road.
In his first speech from the back benches on the M77 plans, Mr Stewart
told MPs: ''Irrespective of our democratic views, there is a challenge
to the law of Scotland about the Pollok Free State and the illegal
march.
''I hope Ministers tonight will make it unequivocally clear that this
House passes legislation about the laws of the UK and that this
Government, or any other government, is thereby committed to
implementing these laws . . .'' 0

SEVEN directors of National Grid hold share options worth #6m at
current share prices, Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown claimed yesterday
in his latest attack on pay excesses in the boardroom.
Mr Brown described National Grid chairman David Jeffries as ''the
first #2m utility boss'' because of his compensation package, based on a
#350,000 salary and share options worth a notional #1.8m.
He promised Labour would introduce additional powers for the
electricity regulator not only to cut consumer prices in the light of
pay and share option abuses but also to hold public hearings into the
running of privatised utilities.
He said: ''The Government says pay and share-option abuses are a
matter for shareholders. But today they must tell us what is to be done
when the shareholders are people who themselves are guilty of some of
the worst pay and share-option abuses.
''It is time to sweep away the secretive and unaccountable practices
of the privatised utilities and make the running of the companies
transparent and accountable.''
National Grid, owned by the 12 regional electricity companies, is
valued by the City at about #5bn. It is expected to be floated on the
stock market this summer once approval is granted by the Department of
Trade and Industry.
Labour's researchers have produced what Mr Brown called ''scandalous''
figures which claim to show that the finance director of National Grid
will become a millionaire under flotation and two retired directors will
share #1.5m.
The seven directors who stand to profit, Mr Brown said, have had their
remuneration set by the 12 heads of the regional electricity companies,
who themselves have ''made millions from privatisation''. It amounted to
''a magic circle of self-serving utilities bosses, helping each other to
their millions''.
The pay deal for Mr Jefferies, who joined the utility in 1990, is the
largest in a long series involving executives in the privatised
utilities.
Mr Brown said Government claims that shareholders should curb
excessive pay awards were worthless, as the shareholders in this case --
the chairmen of the regional electricity companies -- had themselves
made millions from privatisation.
A spokesman for National Grid said: ''Share options are a matter
between the individual and the company and are divulged each year in the
annual report.''
Labour meanwhile was publishing its own proposals to curb pay in the
utilities, with official regulators being required to hold
American-style public hearings, where the chairmen would be called to
account.
Labour also wants share options to be taxed as income and regulations
to ensure there is an independent representative on companies'
remuneration committees which set executive pay.

NATIONAL Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell yesterday defended
Baroness Thatcher's former Press Secretary Sir Bernard Ingham as a
candidate for the Press Complaints Commission saying that his views
would be ''irrelevant'' to the job.
No one could deny that Sir Bernard was ''effective'' and effectiveness
was the criterion that should be applied to potential candidates to the
PCC, Mr Dorrell told the Commons.
The issue was raised at question time by Shadow National Heritage
Secretary Chris Smith after reports that Sir Bernard's appointment to
the newspaper industry's self-regulatory watchdog is being being sought
by its new chairman, Lord Wakeham, once one of Lady Thatcher's most
trusted Ministers.
Mr Smith said that what was needed above all else from the PCC was ''a
fair-minded and impartial weighing up of sensitive evidence''.
He demanded: ''How can this possibly happen when a man as rudely
opinionated and irrational as Sir Bernard Ingham is proposed for
membership?''
Mr Dorrell replied: ''The Government has made it clear that we would
prefer a model for regulation of the press built on the principles of
self-regulation.''

SCOTS holidaymakers have been caught out by a change in the Spanish
passport laws.
Many people are booking their holidays, unaware of rules to be brought
in making it impossible to travel to Spain on a one-year visitors
passport after September 30 of this year.
Instead, 10-year passports will have to be used to get to mainland
Spain, Majorca, Minorca, Tenerife, Lanzarote, Gran Canaria,
Fuerteventura, and Ibiza.
The passport office in Glasgow, which covers Scotland and the north of
England, is having to introduce extra staff and new shift rotas to try
to cover the expected rush of applications.
The Association of British Travel Agents is worried that some people
may book their holiday unaware that they hold the wrong type of
passport.
All British Visitors Passports are being abolished from January 1,
1996, but the change in Spanish law is the one causing the difficulties
for holiday-makers.
Spanish authorities outlawed the one-year passport after many were
forged by drug smugglers or lager louts trying to keep ahead of the law.
There are about two million visitors passports in circulation, around
800,000 of them used by young holidaymakers going to Spain and the
Spanish islands.
Mr Alex Woolfall, of ABTA, said: ''We are concerned that some people
travelling to Spain in October are still unaware of the situation.
''This is a very busy booking time for the holiday trade and although
we will ask people about what passports they have, some may not be aware
of the changes.''
Mr Robert Wilson, of the passport office in Glasgow, said: ''We have
had calls from people who have just booked their holidays to Spain but
were unaware of the change in the law.
''They have been looking for information about the changes. We will be
working with travel agents to make sure that the need for a 10-year
passport to go to Spain is mentioned when people book their holidays.''

THE Lords last night supported back bench legislation to ''reform and
modernise'' Scottish laws that require particular types of writing to be
used for contracts.
The Conservative Earl of Balfour's Requirements of Writing (Scotland)
Bill, which follows recommendations from the Scottish Law Commission,
gained a second reading without a vote.
It stands a good chance of becoming law with the backing of the
Government.
The Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, declaring Ministers'
support for the measure, told peers it would enable those who cannot
write to sign legal documents.
''What we are concerned with is people who cannot subscribe and cannot
write for one reason or another,'' he said.
''The provisions of the Bill are almost exclusively technical and not
controversial in nature. It should lead to savings in time and money for
companies, firms, solicitors and other bodies.
''It is a much needed and long overdue simplification and
clarification of the law of Scotland.''

THE BBC Radio Helpline, a 24-hour, all-year-round telephone service
linked to specific items and programmes, was launched in Glasgow
yesterday.
Based in the city, it will cost #5m a year to run and will employ 86
people.
Ms Liz Forgan, managing director of Network Radio, thanked Glasgow
District Council and Glasgow Development Agency for their support in
bringing the helpline to the city.
She said Glasgow had been chosen because it was a recognised centre
for telephone inquiries, had a high calibre workforce, offered an
excellent working environment and good choice of office space, and
fitted in with the BBC's policy of regional proportionality.
The helpline will offer a service to listeners of Radio 1, 2, 3, 4,
and Radio 5 Live, and will be free and confidential. Listeners will be
given the helpline numbers on air after programmes or special social
action projects, for example initiatives on unemployment.
The helpline will be run by Broadcasting Support Services, an
independent charity originally established by the BBC in 1975 to support
On The Move, an adult literacy campaign.

THE way the Chancellor told it brought back memories of Kipling and
Maugham. It is doubtful though whether either of the masters would have
chanced a plot that sounded as improbable -- one of the great banking
houses of England brought down by what Mr Clarke colourfully called ''a
rogue trader in Singapore'' which, he helpfully explained, was ''on the
far side of the world''.
Still, the story of a humbly-born lad from a Watford council estate
making good in the Orient and then shaking the pillars of the City
Establishment with a #700m or so gamble, might have appealed to both.
What probably would not was having to explain what ''derivatives''
are. The Chancellor wisely chose a broad brush in outlining what he knew
to the Commons which was, largely, how little he knew of how it had been
done.
Broadly, and with one striking exception, the Tory City chaps thought
it was a dashed bad show but over-regulation would be worse. Mr Peter
Brooke, appropriately representing the City of London and Westminster
South, intoned that it was ''skilful acceptance of risk'' that had made
the City pre-eminent in the financial world. ''Skilful'' hardly seemed
the right word.
The Shadow Chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, had dug up a quotation about
the derivatives market that Mr Eddie George must now wish he had left
unsaid. ''These people know what they are doing whether it is at
director level or the chaps on the desk.'' His expert team at the Bank
of England, he said, were ''getting better every time'' and monitoring
derivatives. But not quickly enough it seems.
Mr Brown contented himself with a soundbite -- ''a culture of
complacency'' -- but to those on his left it marked the return of an old
favourite -- the crisis of capitalism.
Mr Tony Benn, having crammed every scandal involving money he could
think of into one sentence, fiercely denounced speculation bringing a
shocked gasp of ''Communist'' from a susceptible Tory.
Mr Dennis Skinner invited the Chancellor to ''call a spade a spade''.
A ''bloody shovel'' man himself he did concisely describe what Mr Leeson
was up to as betting on what the Japanese Stock Exchange would do in 12
months' time. ''What wealth-creation is there in that?'' he asked with
rhetorical contempt.
The admirable Mr Ian Duncan-Smith (Chingford -- Con) reminded him and
the House that most productive work on any scale requires investment and
that is what markets are about.
However, the patrician stockbroker, Sir Peter Tapsell, whom no one
could describe as a neo-Marxist, said dealing in derivatives deserved
the description of gambling and should be banned by international law as
impossible to police.
Mr Dale Campbell-Savours (Workington -- Lab) who brings a whiff of
mystery and conspiracy uncovered to many of his questions, suggested
that ''Mr Leeson may have a very different story to tell,'' from what
was being put about by ''people with a clear motive for blaming him''.
His life could be in danger and he should give himself up to some body
he could trust.
Mr Clarke, had he been Chancellor then, might have remained his
persistently jaunty self even during the Wall Street Crash and he would
doubtless have stayed quite cheerful had he been at No. 11 the day we
got chucked out of the ERM. Mr Campbell-Savours was, he hoped, being
over dramatic.
Mr Brown, getting a touch of the Maughams himself, had earlier asked
about ''warning signals in the Far East'' which had been disregarded.
The Chancellor dismissed this but almost as an afterthought later
disclosed that Barings had been sufficiently worried by, if not
''warning signals from the Far East'', something, to send someone out
from London on Monday of last week and by Wednesday ''it was obvious
there was a serious problem''.
On that scenario it looks as though it may not just be the rogue
trader of Singapore who has some explaining to do.

THOUSANDS of people in remote areas will have the chance to enjoy the
multiplex cinema experience without leaving home if a scheme to purchase
two hi-tech mobile units is approved.
Two arts organisations, one in the Highlands and one in South-west
Scotland, want to buy and operate the filmhouses-on-wheels after a
successful trial run with a French CineMobile in Dumfriesshire last
year.
Five British coach-builders, including one in Dumfriesshire, are
liaising with the Scottish Film Council over the technical
specifications with a view to tendering bids to build such a mobile
cinema.
The French example costs more than #500,000 but it is understood that
a British version could be considerably cheaper to produce and would be
preferred as it would be built for the demands of the Scottish rural
road system.
The Cinemobile is based on a standard 40ft articulated trailer. It
opens out into a 100-seat cinema with a 10ft screen, stereo sound, and
35mm projection facilities.
Dumfries and Galloway Arts Association and Hi-Arts Ltd, a development
agency for the Highlands and Islands, are in the process of jointly
applying to the National Lottery and the Foundation for Sports and the
Arts for capital to buy the vehicles, which would concentrate on showing
the latest releases.
Private sources of funding and the European Union will also be
approached for backing. Organisers expect that the Highland Cinemobile
will qualify for Objective One funding.
Mr Robert Livingston, of Hi-Arts, said yesterday that the popularity
of the Highlands as a film location strengthened the case for a mobile
picture-house serving a circuit of 24 population clusters.
''The Highlands has recently become a mecca for film-makers, with a
number of recent Hollywood films shot there.
''People actually living there have to wait for months or years for
the films to come out on video, and then they miss out on the communal,
community activity that is going to the pictures.
''Ideally, I'd like to see Rob Roy (a film starring Liam Neeson as the
legendary Scots figure) premiered in our own Cinemobile, in the areas it
was shot in, but unfortunately that won't happen.''
Ms Jenny Wilson, of the Dumfries and Galloway Arts Association, said
the closest cinema to people living west of Dumfries might well be in
Belfast.
The facilities would need about #40,000 subsidy a year each to
operate, a sum which Ms Wilson described as ''peanuts'' in comparison to
the support received by sports centres and swimming pools.
The partnership accepted that uncertainty created by local government
reorganisation might create difficulties in obtaining support, but were
confident that the new authorities would back the joint venture.
They would be able to court the funding authorities further in April,
when a Cinemobile will be at the Celtic Film and TV Festival in Fort
William to screen part of the programme. The vehicle will then be driven
south to Dumfriesshire, for a further demonstration.
If their efforts prove successful, the arts partnership hope to have
their mobile movie machines on the road next year.
This would be appropriate, said the Scottish Film Council's new
director, Ms Maxine Baker, as putting film on the road was the way
cinema started off.
Ms Baker said: ''Next year is the centenary year of cinema in Scotland
and it would be brilliant if we could turn full circle and have mobile
cinemas once again bringing film to rural areas.''

A FOURTEEN-year old girl was arrested yesterday for alleged disorderly
conduct after children from a local secondary school carried out their
threat to strike and joined protesters against the M77 extension.
The girl was released into the custody of her parents following an
incident yesterday morning at Wimpey's Boydstone Road compound.
A report is to be submitted to the Reporter to the Children's Hearing.
Yesterday morning, a number of children gathered round a fence
surrounding tree fellers who were clearing an area opposite the
so-called Pollok Free State.
They claimed they were striking after their headteacher refused their
demand for two hours a day off to join the protesters. A spokesperson
from Strathclyde region's education department implored parents to
ensure their children go to school.
A spokesman from Pollok Free State last night said: ''We are very
concerned for the children's safety and would like to appeal to the
kids, if they do want to be involved, as is their democratic right, they
must act responsibly.''

COMMUNITY groups yesterday accused Glasgow District Council of
conducting a sham consultation exercise over the future of the city's
parks.
They complained that their ideas for regenerating the parks have been
ignored.
The department published a draft strategy in December last year and
asked for comments. The council is expected to take a final decision in
April.
Dr Nina Baker, of Knightswood North/Templar community council, said:
''They have ignored many ideas put forward by community groups and are
even blocking our rights to see other groups' comments. The whole
so-called consultation has been a total sham.''
She branded the draft document a ''seller's charter'', saying that the
council planned to sell off under-used parkland to subsidise the large
''tourist'' parks. Small, local play parks would have to seek their own
funding and find local volunteers to undertake regular maintenance and
improvements, she said.
''At the Rio Summit (the global environmental conference held in
1992), the UK signed up for Local Agenda 21, which is supposed to give
ordinary people control over improving their environment.
''I do not see any hint of this here. When are we really going to
'Green for Glasgow' instead of going for selling Glasgow Green?''
The North West Area Forum on Kelvingrove Park, which has been
campaigning against proposals to lease part of that park to a private
developer for a pub complex, has also criticised the draft document.
A spokeswoman for the forum said there was no evidence in the document
of any intention to change policies which had ''caused so much distress
to the local communities of Glasgow in recent years''.
She said: ''There is no point in the council saying it must involve
the communities after all the decisions have been taken by the city
politicians in secret.''
The forum is asking all the city's community councils to back a call
for ''full and genuine public consultation'' on any proposals involving
alcohol licences in parks or the leasing or selling of parkland.
The parks department yesterday declined to comment.

THE Scottish Office was yesterday accused of encouraging open-cast
mining developers to trample over the rights of whole communities
throughout central Scotland.
The attack was made by Mr John Home Robertson, Labour MP for East
Lothian, and the Scottish Open-cast Action Group, and came on the day
the group launched a guide to help threatened communities to fight back.
The launch took place at Ormiston in East Lothian, where an action
group was formed recently to respond to the threat of two open-cast
operations on the edge of the village.
The publication is aimed at helping local groups to mount their own
campaigns and to build up a national movement strong enough to force
Government intervention.
Mr Home Robertson said protesters were not just fighting developers
but also Government guidelines weighted unfairly against them.
He pledged to press Scottish Secretary Ian Lang to take up the action
group's call for an urgent re-think.
The action group's convener, Ms Claudia Beamish, said that the guide
was needed by dozens of communities under threat from ''horrific''
open-cast proposals.
The Ormiston group claims that open-cast coal mines would encroach to
within 200 metres of the nearest homes, and the community would also
would have to contend with fleets of heavy lorries, noise, and dust.

THE battle to take over the VSEL shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness could
put thousands of jobs at risk north of the Border, the Scottish National
Party warned yesterday.
In its submission to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the party
said the rival bids by GEC and British Aerospace involved issues
affecting not only vital areas of defence procurement but also the
survival of industries important to Scotland's industrial base.
Mr Dick Douglas, SNP spokesman on trade and industry, warned that if
either or both bids were allowed to proceed, the resultant merger of the
activities of VSEL and the creation of a larger group would have an
impact on the Yarrow shipyard, which is a GEC subsidiary, the Kvaerner
Govan shipyard, and the British Aerospace-owned Jetstream aircraft
factory at Prestwick.
''It is completely unsatisfactory to leave the future of more than
4000 people employed in Scotland to the vagaries of the market,
especially when the market is so defence-related and subject to
expenditure decisions of the Government.
''The public interest in Scotland will not be satisfied if, in
addition to the uncertainties of Government decisions, future employment
opportunities are constrained by decisions made to concentrate research
and development and manufacturing facilities south of the Border, at the
expense of Scottish jobs, by companies controlled outwith Scotland.''
No bids for VSEL by either GEC or British Aerospace should be allowed
without the continuance and strengthening of the Government's existing
''golden share'' in VSEL, in any subsequent enterprise.
''A strengthening of the golden share would include an ability to
obtain direct knowledge of decisions which affect the continuance of
employment in areas and facilities, as a result of orders placed by
Government, in order to ensure that no curtailment of shipbuilding or
aircraft manufacturing in Scotland could arise as a result of accounting
and costing procedure.''

THE Chancellor moved to calm the markets yesterday by announcing an
immediate investigation into the spectacular collapse with
''unquantifiable losses'' of Barings, the City's oldest merchant bank.
In a Commons statement Mr Kenneth Clarke said he had asked the Board
of Banking Supervision to investigate all aspects of the case. But he
warned that the bank remained liable to all its creditors, including the
Queen, charities, and local councils.
''I am determined to address that question rigorously and to review
the regulatory system thoroughly in the light of this collapse,'' he
told MPs. All appropriate lessons would be learned.
The bank called in the receivers on Sunday night after it became
apparent that no limit could be set on the losses -- already at #600m --
incurred in unauthorised dealings by the bank's 28-year-old senior
trader in Singapore.
As the pound fell to an all-time low, Mr Clarke sought to ease fears
of a knock-on effect on international financial markets and the leading
position of the City of London. ''It appears to be a specific incident
unique to Barings centred on one rogue trader in Singapore,'' he said.
Global markets should be ''quite strong enough to absorb it without
lasting damage,'' he said. ''I would stress that these circumstances are
unique to Barings and should not apply to other banks operating in
London.''
Barings faced losses of at least #600m in contracts on three stock
exchanges in Singapore, Osaka and Tokyo, he said, but ''further
unquantifiable losses'' were expected.
Its assets worth #2000m have been frozen by administrators, but Mr
Clarke said the bank did not appear to have small retail depositors in
great numbers.
The Board of Banking Supervision's investigation will be chaired by
Bank of England Governor Eddie George and will look at the circumstances
which allowed Mr Nick Leeson, the trader at the centre of the collapse,
to take unauthorised risk and expose the bank to such liabilities
without informing his managers. Finding the truth would take time, Mr
Clarke said.
However, he added that protection from risk in a free market was
impossible. ''No system of regulation can ever guarantee total
security.'' Fraudulent or incompetent dealing was always a possibility.
''Every regulatory authority and every bank must now be considering
what further steps it can take to protect itself against this sort of
risk,'' he added.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said the investigation would have to
examine the need for further controls on banking. In particular, it
should look into suggestions that ''warning signals'' of an impending
collapse were received as long as 10 days ago.
''The weekend's events demonstrate clear public interest in better
supervision, stronger safeguards and more adequate investor protection,
in the UK and through international co-operation, so we can maintain
confidence in the integrity of the financial system,'' he said.
Tory Sir Peter Tapsell (Lindsey East) surprised fellow back benchers
by suggesting that derivatives, the type of trading that caught out the
bank, should be banned under international law. Mr Clarke said: ''Most
banks engage in some trading of this kind. We have to ensure the
regulations stop pure gambling -- purely taking positions of a highly
speculative, impossibly risky kind -- and make sure we do not
over-regulate.''
Motherwell South Labour MP Dr Jeremy Bray said the problem was the
mathematical ignorance of those handling derivatives. Would the
Chancellor consider appointing a committee of academics to advise on the
technicalities of derivatives? Mr Clarke said it was up to each bank to
ensure that their staff was informed and experienced.
Dennis Skinner (Lab, Bolsover) challenged Mr Clarke to ''call a spade
a spade'' and admit that derivatives speculation amounted to gambling.
Mr Clarke said Mr Skinner had no idea how derivatives and the
financial markets worked. ''I don't think his advice should be heeded.''

SINN FEIN leader Gerry Adams last night welcomed what he called ''a
more sensible'' approach by Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew towards
possible early talks between his party and Ministers.
Britain and Sinn Fein appeared deadlocked on the talks issue on
Sunday, when Sir Patrick insisted on ''substantial progress'' towards
the decommissioning of IRA arms before any such meetings.
The comment prompted angry reactions from Sinn Fein leaders as they
ended their party's annual conference in Dublin.
Speaking in Craigavon, County Armagh yesterday, Sir Patrick indicated
that moves towards exploratory exchanges might be possible.
He told journalists: ''If there is an indication that movement is now
on the cards towards substantial decommissioning of arms, then
Ministers, if that is the case, would certainly give careful
consideration to meeting Sinn Fein in this exploratory round of talks.''
Mr Adams said afterwards: ''I welcome what appears to be a more
sensible approach by Patrick Mayhew . . .
''The ban on Ministerial contact with our party is a nonsense.
''It is a bizarre situation, when he quite rightly meets us about
local matters, but refuses to do so over the single most important issue
facing the people of these islands, peace in our country.
''The ban should be ended with all speed.''
The Sinn Fein leader said Britain had to recognise his party's mandate
and the rights of its voters, adding: ''Of course, we recognise the
importance of the decommissioning of weapons issue.
''Our commitment on this is clear -- the whole question of arms and
the decommissioning of arms will have to be dealt with as part of the
peace process.''
It was understood that the Government and Sinn Fein are currently
trying to re-arrange an exploratory meeting between civil servants and
the party's delegates.
It was called off last month when Sinn Fein said it had detected a
bugging device in the Belfast venue for the talks.
Sinn Fein sees that meeting as the last ahead of contact with British
Ministers.
The Democratic Unionist Party MP and party leader, the Rev Ian
Paisley, attacked Sir Patrick's remarks. The policy of ''surrender and
betrayal'' by the Government was building up to full speed, he claimed.
He added: ''Once again the Government has capitulated to the demands
of the IRA. Within 24 hours of the Sinn Fein conference, the Government
has danced to the tune set up the republicans.
''This announcement is one short step away from the announcement of
full blown talks between the Government and the IRA and any of those
parties who will sell out Ulster to the Provos.''
The position of the Ulster Unionists remained uncertain.But the party
leader, Mr James Molyneaux, who was thought to have been under pressure
since the publication of the framework document for Northern Ireland,
was given unanimous support at a meeting of party officers and chairmen
of constituency associations in Belfast.
A party statement said: ''Complete support was unanimously expressed
in the firm stance of the leader and Parliamentary party in defence of
the Union'' dispelling any doubts as to his immediate future.
* A NEW #140m European Union aid package for Northern Ireland and the
Republic's border regions was announced yesterday. Around #126m has been
set aside for North-South projects and #13.5m will go to help train
young adults in deprived areas of Belfast and Londonderry.

GLASGOW district and Strathclyde regional councils have intervened in
the Bell's Bridge row which threatens the future of the Waverley, the
world's last sea-going paddle steamer.
As The Herald has revealed, the steamer is trapped at her berth at
Glasgow's Anderston Quay, upriver of the bridge, while Glasgow
Development Agency and management of the Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre deliberate about what can be done to repair the swing
bridge and its access.
It emerged yesterday that both councils, who together own 92% of SEC
Ltd, the SECC's management company, have met company representatives to
urge a quick conclusion to the row over repairing the bridge, damaged by
December's heavy flooding.
It is understood Mr Tom Monaghan, chief executive of Glasgow District
Council, has written to Mr Mike Closier, chief executive of SEC Ltd,
indicating that the council wants the company to do as much as possible
to allow the Waverley to sail downriver as closely as possible to the
planned departure date.
Sources have indicated that the letter suggested allowing the GDA
immediate access to the bridge, although Mr Monaghan would confirm
yesterday only that he had written to Mr Closier expressing the
council's concern over the future of the Waverley.
The paddle steamer is due to pass through the bridge -- which was
erected as a temporary structure for the 1988 Garden Festival -- on
March 6, prior to entering the Garvel drydock in Greenock for the final
stages of a #350,000 refit.
The GDA has claimed the necessary repairs could be completed within
two weeks at a cost of #20,000 but the SECC management, which owns the
north quayside, also damaged by the floods, maintains it must wait for
its insurers to complete an assessment of the damage to its property
before allowing any access to the bridge.
A regional council spokesperson confirmed last night that the region
had met SEC Ltd officials to discuss the situation but was unable to
provide any information as to what was said.
Both Mr Robert Gould and Mr Pat Lally, leaders respectively of the
Labour regional and district administrations, sit on the board of SEC
Ltd.
Mr Gould expressed sympathy for the Waverley's plight last night, and
added: ''While not familiar with the engineering technicalities of the
damage done to the bridge, we will be pushing the appropriate people to
bring this matter to a quick conclusion.''
Mr Lally was not available for comment.

FOOTBALL fan Matthew Simmons was yesterday charged with two public
order offences in relation to the incident involving Manchester United
star Eric Cantona last month, Scotland Yard said.
Mr Simmons, 20, a double glazing fitter, has been bailed to appear
before Croydon magistrates on March 24.
The maximum penalty is six months in prison and a #6000 fine if he is
convicted.
The Crystal Palace fan is charged with using threatening, abusive or
insulting words or behaviour likely to cause immediate unlawful violence
by another person, and he is also charged with using threatening,
abusive or insulting words or behaviour within the hearing or sight of a
person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress.
Both charges are under the Public Order Act 1986.
Mr Simmons is alleged to have taunted Cantona after the French star
was sent off during the match against Crystal Palace on January 25.

HEALTH boards in Scotland are to receive an additional #1m from the
Government in the coming year to combat drugs misuse, Lord Fraser, the
Home Affairs Minister, announced yesterday.
The Scottish Office is considering bids for resources from boards but,
said Lord Fraser, he was keen to fund the development of innovative,
community-based schemes.
''Unusually, I am prepared to say in advance I will fund experimental,
pilot projects of this kind and I look to the new drug action teams to
encourage bold and imaginative thinking in this whole area,'' he told
Scottish Drugs Forum's annual conference.
In the last year, health boards received #7m for drugs misuse. Lord
Fraser said he believed a watershed had been reached in the response to
drugs misuse in Scotland.
A comprehensive assessment of need had to underly future service
development, he added. The new crisis intervention centres in Glasgow
and Edinburgh were invaluable assets and similar centres are planned for
Aberdeen and Dundee.
He regarded substitute prescribing -- methadone given out under
controlled circumstances -- as important in any range of services but
said it was a sensitive area in which they had to proceed carefully.
Referring to the increasing problem of recreational drugs and in
particular to the Ayrshire rave ecstasy deaths, Lord Fraser said a
pragmatic approach which alerted rave organisers and rave goers to the
dangers was necessary.
The Scottish Office was preparing guidelines for local authorities and
licensing boards who deal with rave organisers.

PUBLIC-sector pay pressure is building, with leaders of British Rail
employees tomorrow arguing for a substantial increase, with train
drivers threatening industrial action if necessary, and health unions
meeting today to discuss their tactics after being offered a
''derisory'' 1% national award.
In what is almost certain to be the final central wage bargaining
before privatisation, the rail unions are demanding ''a substantial
percentage increase over and above inflation'' for 115,000 workers.
As revealed in The Herald last month, the train drivers' union Aslef
has already carried out a ballot of its 15,000 members -- who are
understood to have voted overwhelmingly in favour of a campaign of
strikes and sanctions.
They are only too well aware that, with privatisation in the offing,
BR and the Government will be eager to avoid a dispute. Meanwhile, angry
rank and file members of the 750,000 NHS workers represented by Unison,
the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal College of Midwives, the Health
Visitors Association, and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP),
want an improvement on their national 1% award.

A FORMER Army information chief in Northern Ireland, has been granted
an appeal against a manslaughter conviction, it was disclosed yesterday.
Mr Colin Wallace, 50, from Arundel, west Sussex, has been trying to
clear his name since his arrest for the manslaughter of antiques dealer
Jonathan Lewis, 29, who drowned in the River Arun after being knocked
unconscious by a karate-style blow to the nose.
Mr Wallace was jailed for 10 years in March 1981 after being found
guilty of the manslaughter.
He protested his innocence, claiming he was a victim of a dirty tricks
campaign.
He was released from prison in 1986 and in 1991 was awarded #30,000
compensation after an investigation by Sir David Calcutt ruled that he
had been unfairly sacked from his job with the Ministry of Defence.

CHARITIES and voluntary organisations in Scotland were warned
yesterday that the collapse of Barings could cost them millions of
pounds in future grants.
The bank's charitable arm, one of the UK's largest supporters of good
causes, confirmed yesterday that it had suspended its grant-giving
operation, although existing pledges will be honoured.
The decision was met with particular disappointment in Scotland, since
the Baring Foundation agreed only last year to begin funding national
Scottish groups.
Mr Martin Sime, director of the Scottish Council for Voluntary
Organisations, said that the foundation had committed #535,000 through
21 grants in Scotland within the last year.
Those funds were safe, along with up to #200,000 promised to the
council itself for a new initiative to help disadvantaged people, said
Mr Sime.
However, he added: ''This suspension could prove a heavy blow to
Scotland. Baring has wide social welfare objectives, and we had been
delighted by its new policy of supporting Scottish-wide groups.
''Strategic support for the work of charities is so difficult to find,
which is why today's news brings such concern and disappointment for the
future.''
Among the groups which had received recent grants from the foundation
were Alzheimer Scotland-Action on Dementia, and the dementia services
development centre at Stirling University.
The foundation is the Baring family's charitable trust and owns all of
the bank's non-voting shares. It handed out #13.7m last year.
Mr David Carrington, the foundation's director, yesterday called the
bank's collapse ''devastating'' and said income would be reduced to #2m,
from sources other than Barings.
He said: ''We have made commitments to all charities to which we have
pledged grants and they will be honoured.
''Grants we have already agreed to pay in future will be paid. As far
as future pledges go, there are a number of options as to how we may
proceed, and these will be discussed at a full meeting of trustees on
March 15.
''But there are a lot of charities for whom we have become a regular
source of income. I can't be confident that we will be able to maintain
some of these grants.''
Arts bodies anxiously awaiting news of the future of the Baring
Foundation include Scottish Ballet, whose education projects are
supported by the charity.
Scottish Ballet has received about #16,000 in funding from the
foundation in the current year and had hoped to bid for a much larger
sum in the coming year.
The Prince's Trust, a youth charity set up by the Prince of Wales,
stands to lose #1m.
The loss, which represents one-seventh (14%) of the trust's annual
spending, would hit the charity hard.
But trust director Tom Shebbeare said he was determined to keep the
charity afloat and maintain grants to young people in need.
The Prince of Wales was being kept informed about the financial
crisis, he said.
Mr Shebbeare said: ''Fortunately we took out #150,000 on Thursday and
with other funds from sponsors we are determined to keep going -- kids
come first.
''We don't yet know how this will affect us but our commitment to the
grant-making mechanism is an absolute priority and will continue.''
The Royal Jubilee Trusts had been associated with Barings for 60 years
and the Prince's Trust since it was set up in 1976.
''Barings has always been thought of as rock solid -- it was never
regarded as too risky,'' said Mr Shebbeare.

PROTESTERS opposing the closure of Lenzie Hospital yesterday took
their campaign to the doorstep of Greater Glasgow Health Board.
Representatives of hospital staff and the local community gathered
with banners outside the board's headquarters in Ingram Street.
Earlier this month, more than 5000 people signed a petition against
the board's plan to close the hospital and transfer patients to
Stobhill. A Lenzie action group has been formed to fight the proposal.
The Lenzie Hospital provides day care facilities for respite care,
occupational therapy, and rehabilitation for patients.

TORY rebels meet tonight Tues to decide whether to support the Prime
Minister in his key vote on Europe tomorrow Wed. Ulster Unionists are
also meeting to decide whether this is the time to help Labour to bring
the Government down.
Last night at the Commons the Government's business managers were
confident that the Government will survive tomorrow night's vote with a
majority of between 12 and three.
They met the Prime Minister yesterday to assess the situation and
whether it might lead to another confidence vote. Should it come to
this, they are optimistic that the Government will survive.
Euro-rebel criticism of a single currency surfaced later in a Commons
debate, but MPs backed a Government assessment of the economy produced
for the EU, by 279 votes to 183, Government majority 96.
In the debate one of the nine whipless Tory rebels whose votes will be
crucial on Wednesday night, Mr John Wilkinson (Ruislip-Northwood), told
the House that Britain was doing better than Italy, Spain, Greece and
Belgium in meeting the convergence criteria.
''The UK has a far, far tougher fiscal stance and maintains a far
lower level of Government borrowing than those countries,'' he said.
''But it is the very fact that we are so very much better which
demonstrates the difficulties of achieving convergence and the quantity
of funds which will have to be tranferred from well-performing economies
like ours, and Germany's and France's, to address these imbalances.''
He warned: ''These transfers of resources will be costly to our
people.''
Mr Wilkinson gave notice that he would be looking for an explanation
from the Prime Minister when he spoke in Wednesday's debate.
When the Prime Minister writes his speech tonight he has the chance to
woo back the rebels depending on the phrases he uses.

A GROUP of Strathclyde workers may lose up to #1m in pension money
because of the Barings Bank collapse.
Strathclyde Buses pension fund, amounting to #37m, is operated by
Strathclyde Regional Council but fund investments are managed by Barings
Asset Management.
A senior official of the region's finance department said the #37m
fund, invested as it was in stocks and shares, was safe.
However, there was a problem with a sum of #1m awaiting investment
which had been deposited with Barings Bank.
''That money could be at risk but we are awaiting clarification,''
said deputy director of finance, Mr Geoffrey Singleton.
He explained: ''Unfortunately, all that we have is a bank statement
which is a week out of date. That's where the mention of #1m comes in.
There will have been transactions since then.''
There are two parts of Barings that concern the Strathclyde Buses
pension fund. Barings Asset Management manages the fund for the regional
council. When it has cash that's not invested, it will deposit that cash
up to certain limits with Barings Bank.
The mainstream Strathclyde Regional Council pension fund is not
affected by the Barings collapse.
While the buses are no longer part of Strathclyde region, having been
subject to a management buy-out, the council still operates the pension
fund.
A spokesperson for Strathclyde Buses said the company was aware of a
possible problem but was awaiting written confirmation about the
situation from the regional council.

THREE armed robbers who left a have-a-go member of the public dead
after a bank raid were described as callous and greedy yesterday at the
High Court in Edinburgh.
Retired mining engineer David Dunn, 63, from Bonnyrigg, in Midlothian,
was shot on October 19 last year.
Three men, Gulf War veteran Robert Smith, 33, Mr Gerald McQuade, 40,
and Mr Paul Bootland, 25, are on trial, charged with his murder.
Advocate-depute Michael O'Grady told the jury in his closing speech
yesterday that the three were greedy and dishonest enough to rob a bank
of a small fortune.
They were also ruthless enough to carry guns in the raid and they were
callous enough to use the weapons, he contended.
Mr Smith, of no fixed abode, Mr McQuade, formerly of Prospecthill
Road, in Glasgow, and Mr Bootland, of Greenend Grove, Edinburgh, have
all denied the murder.
They are also accused of attempting to murder off-duty detective John
Duffy, 42, and two other men and of robbing a branch of the Bank of
Scotland in Bonnyrigg High Street of #185,000.
Mr O'Grady told the court: ''These are not three men who tried to
snatch an old lady's handbag. These are men who are determined to
succeed and determined to get away with it.
''These men planned this carefully and ruthlessly,'' he argued. In
every detail, it was a professional scheme.
He claimed that when Mr Smith, who was armed with a Glock pistol he
smuggled back from the Gulf conflict, said the fatal shots were neither
intentional nor expected he was lying.
''He may not have panicked in the face of Saddam Hussein but he
panicked in the face of a 63-year-old man with a bag of messages who got
between him and his escape,'' said the Advocate-depute.
The trial continues.

MINISTERS' strategy for tackling crime in Scotland provided the tinder
yesterday for a fresh row between Scottish Secretary Ian Lang and his
Labour Shadow, Mr George Robertson.
Against the background of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, which
came up for its second reading in the Commons, Mr Lang claimed no-one
could be in any doubt that the Government was in the forefront in the
fight against crime, and he accused Labour of having a misconceived
strategy.
Mr Robertson, however, said that while there were many worthy reforms
in the Bill, it hardly amounted to a major assault on crime and its
underlying causes.
His line was that the Bill, which has already been through the Lords,
was not an acceptable or effective measure to tackle crime because it
failed adequately to address levels of crime in Scotland, particularly
the rising trends in violence, vandalism, robberies and drugs offences.
Included in the Bill's main provisions are reform to bail legislation,
a new system aimed at reducing the number of trials adjourned and
cancelled at a late stage, and what the Government describes as
''improvements'' to the procedures for the selection of juries.
In addition, the system of fiscal fines would be extended -- to cover,
for example, minor drugs offences -- existing procedures for judicial
examination of accused people before trial would be extended, the ''not
proven'' verdict will be retained and there would be changes to the
rules governing an accused's right to silence.
Mr Lang told the House that the Bill would mark a watershed in the
operation of the criminal justice system in Scotland.
Mr Lang drew particular attention to short-cutting procedures in both
summary and sheriff and jury cases, which he said had the potential to
cut by half the number of people who attend court unnecessarily.
On the ''not proven'' verdict, Mr Lang said: ''We reviewed the three
verdict system very thoroughly. We set out the arguments for and against
three verdicts impartially and consulted widely before reaching a
decision.
''The responses to that consultation made it clear that the three
verdict system continues to be valued in Scotland, and that although
there are strong views on both sides, there is considerably more support
for the retention of the not proven verdict than for its abolition.''
For Labour Mr Robertson said: ''There are some in Scotland, sickened
and let down by the rise in crime and the consequent fear of crime, who
will think this Bill will give them some comfort, will have within it
some contribution to allaying their distress. They will be deeply
disappointed.''
Mr Robertson said there were some disturbing trends within the crime
figures: the rise in violent crime, the ''explosion'' in drugs offences
and the increase in vandalism, robberies and car thefts. What was
needed, he said, was ''a root and branch attack'' on crime and the
causes of crime and, by any standards, the Bill could not be said to
have met that task.
The Shadow Scottish Secretary also commented on the ''not proven''
verdict, in which he has taken a special interest because of a
constituency case. He told the House: ''It is a bad and unnecessary
verdict . . . and should be consigned to the dustbin of history.''
For the Liberal Democrats, Menzies Campbell said: ''Scotland has the
only domestic system of law in Europe which lacks its own domestic
legislation.
''That is a compelling argument in favour of those who argue for a
Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.''
Mr Campbell, a barrister, also backed the not proven verdict saying it
was ''a sophisticated verdict. It is a verdict where the jury expresses
itself as being unwilling to give a certificate of credibility to the
accused.''
Mr Andrew Welsh (Angus E -- SNP), who attacked the Bill's provisions
on the right to silence as ''an attack on civil liberties'', said some
of the measure's proposals made good practical sense but others appeared
to be ''a trade-off of civilised justice provision for cheap political
ends''.
Labour forced a technical vote on the Bill which the Government won by
282 votes to 207, a majority of 75. Labour's strategy will be to try to
seek improvements and changes to the legislation during its Commons
committee stage.

THE administrators of the collapsed Barings bank yesterday froze its
bank deposits until the full extent of its liabilities are known after
losses of #625m due to the dealings by a 28-year-old trader in
Singapore.
Among those affected by a #17,500m gamble that went wrong are the
Queen, several local councils, fund managers, and bank depositors. The
maximum they would be entitled to under the Bank Deposit Protection Fund
is #15,000 and the overall scheme cost should not exceed about #40m.
However, repayment of deposits could take a considerable time, as was
the case with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International -- although
its overall losses were much larger than those at Barings.
Governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, said that he
believed a senior trader on January 26 started on an increasingly
massive scale to take open positions which eventually amounted to $7000m
in equities in the form of the Nikkei 225 Index traded in Osaka and
Tokyo, but at the same time selling forward both Japanese government
securities and yen amounting in all to about $20,000m
Instead he should have been selling the Nikkei in Singapore.
Barings discovered the position on Thursday and Mr George was
contacted in Switzerland where he had just arrived for a skiing holiday
at midday. Throughout the weekend, he grappled with the problem of
trying to get other banks to come to the rescue.
Many British banks were prepared to inject capital and provide against
some of the loss on the open positions; but they refused to do anything
unless there was a cap on their liabilities.
''That was the killer,'' he said.
Japanese institutions were approached through the Bank of Japan but to
no avail as they would have had to sell equities to cover their books.
That was underlined yesterday morning when the 4% fall in the Nikkei as
a result of the Barings disaster reduced the value of the bank's
portfolio by $280m.
Mr George went out of his way to emphasise that this was not a problem
due to derivatives but it could be of supervision.
However, it is important for people to recognise that supervision will
not give a guarantee that an institution will not fail, he added.
The money markets in London took the matter calmly and, although the
Bank had said on Sunday evening that it was standing by to provide
liquidity as required, in the event there was little disturbance and
nothing other than routine help was provided.
Several financial institutions have already shown interest in buying
various parts of Barings which employs 4000 people worldwide.
The most valuable asset will be the fund management side, which
handles about #31,000m and could be worth perhaps #300m. Other banks are
interested in picking up the corporate clients for which Barings
provides advice and which is a major money spinner when there are
takeovers -- it is still helping Wellcome in trying to fend off the
hostile #9000m bid fronm fellow pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo.
One client said yesterday that he was waiting for the dust to settle
but would follow the people he has trusted in the past.
Mr George was at his ''Steady Eddie'' best and said he was reassured
that the market reactions were so muted because they recognised that the
problems were Baring specific rather than market systemic.

SCOTTISH inward investment agency officials last night declined to
comment on speculation that the Government encouraged Scotland to pull
out of a battle for a #100m computer plant in the belief that it would
then go to Northern Ireland.
The Irish Industrial Development Authority in Dublin is celebrating
winning the investment by Hewlett-Packard, a project which will create
1150 jobs over the next four years, in direct competition with the
Northern Ireland Development Board and the Dutch authorities.
However, it has been suggested that Scottish Enterprise was a
contender and that it opted out of the race before the final stage, a
decision which has apparently baffled Irish officials accustomed to
tough battles with Scotland for international investment.
A spokesman for Scottish Enterprise's inward investment arm, Locate in
Scotland, last night declined to comment.
Some officials in Dublin are suggesting, off the record, that British
efforts to win the project for Northern Ireland may not have been
unconnected with last week's launch of the UK-Irish framework document
aimed at securing a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.
The announcement of a 1150-job project, they say, could have done much
to assuage Unionist anger over the document's proposals.

THE brother of a fisherman who was lost at sea after his boat collided
with a supply vessel told yesterday how he heard of the tragedy as he
fished from another ship in the North Sea.
Mr Joe Smith, 38, was keeping watch on the June Rose when he heard
that his brother Gordon, 40, of Rossie Street, Arbroath, was missing
after the Arbroath-registered Sharridale sank 30 miles east off
Peterhead on Sunday afternoon.
His younger brother James, 34, was among five crew members plucked to
safety after the 72-foot boat collided with the 2300-tonne supply ship,
Huntetor.
Coastguards did not renew their search for Gordon yesterday.
Mr Smith said: ''It came over the radio that the Sharridale had been
sunk and a crew member was missing. I had two brothers on board the boat
and you just think the worst.''
Mr Sith was taken to Peterhead by his vessel and made his way to
Aberdeen in time to see the supply boat bringing the survivors ashore.
He said Gordon, a married man with an eight-year-old daughter and
three-year-old son, had been ''in the fishing all his life'' with spells
in the Merchant Navy and on supply boats.
Mr James Smith was recovering at home yesterday.
Mr Peter Donald, manager of Arbroath Fisherman's Association, said
yesterday: ''It's a shock to the town and a blow to the fishing
community.''
The Department of Transport's marine accident investigation branch is
to hold an inquiry. Coastguards said they did not know how the accident
happened.
Mr Brian Cotton, of naval architects Napier and Company in Arbroath,
said: ''You can't put it down to a malfunction of the vessel or bad
weather. Both vessels would have good navigational aids and the seas
were reasonably good as far as I'm concerned.''

THE staff at Scotland's biggest children's casualty department watch
them come in every day with broken bones, gaping wounds, and horrific
burns, and wonder what on earth's going on out there.
The man in charge of accident and emergency at the Royal Hospital for
Sick Children in Glasgow has some first-hand knowledge. At the age of
seven, Dr Dori Doraiswamy was happily chopping away when he took the tip
off his thumb.
Now he and his colleagues are pioneering a research programme to chart
methodically how, where, and why their young patients become hospital
cases. Parents who bring children in are being asked to fill in a form
giving details of the accident which will be fed into CHIRPP -- the
Children's Hospital Injury Research and Prevention Programme.
Eventually, using software from Canada, they will be able to highlight
accident blackspots with which to back up targeted prevention campaigns.
Yorkhill is believed to be the first hospital in Europe to mount such
a surveillance programme, which was launched yesterday as part of a
two-pronged attack on domestic and road accidents.
The other prong is a series of panels on the walls of the casualty
department pointing out some of the obvious hazards and how to avoid
them.
Dr Doraiswamy said that falls were the most common cause of home
accidents, followed by cuts from knives or glass and scalding through
spilt kettles or saucepans; swallowing other people's medicines was also
a major cause for concern.
Recalling his own childhood mishap, he said: ''I was lucky -- it was
only a small sliver of flesh and it healed up. But we get children in
who have jammed their fingers in doors and they are in great pain. We
have had them in carrying severed fingers but usually it is too late for
anything to be done.
''In Australia, they have the right idea -- the gap between the inside
edge of the door and the doorpost is jammed with rubber. Children can't
get their fingers in, and it gives enough to let the door close.
''I think we under-estimate children's intelligence when they are very
young -- they are naturally curious and they are always a step ahead of
their parents when it comes to getting into something they shouldn't.''
About 800 children die each year from accidents and 10,000 are
permanently disabled, and it is estimated that one child in six attends
Accident and Energency each year.
Dr Carol Tannahill, Health Promotion Director for Greater Glasgow
Health Board, said: ''For half the lifetime of males and a third of
females, the likeliest cause of death is an accident.
''They are not random events -- childhood accidents in the home are
more likely to happen in times of stress, in an unsafe environment, in
conditions of overcrowding, and of poverty -- and they are more likely
to happen to boys.''
Dr David Stone, a paediatric epidemiologist at Glasgow University who
is working on the CHIRPP project, said: ''Yorkhill is the pioneer in
this field. It is the first hospital to introduce an injury surveillance
system.''

THE SNP candidate who ran the Tories to within 2000 votes in Perth and
Kinross at the General Election last night withdrew from the contest to
fight the seat at the forthcoming by-election.
Ms Roseanna Cunningham is one of her party's brightest talents but
close friends last night claimed she had been the victim of an internal
whispering campaign involving unfounded personal smears, which had
robbed her of the chance to win the seat.
After the death of Sir Nicholas Fairbairn QC, she became the front
runner to fight the seat. She too is a QC and it was felt she had earned
the right to see through the job of winning a constituency she had
cultivated.
However, at Sunday's initial selection meeting, the candidate was
stunned when veteran MEP Mrs Winnie Ewing raised the question of a
relationship Ms Cunningham had 18 years ago with Mr Donald Bain, then
the estranged husband of Mrs Margaret Ewing, the party parliamentary
leader, who is now married to Mr Fergus Ewing, Winnie's son and the
party's business spokesman.
Last night, Mrs Margaret Ewing, MP for Moray, rebuffed her
mother-in-law, saying: ''It is with great regret that I have heard of
Roseanna's withdrawal from the list of names under consideration for the
Perth and Kinross by-election. Roseanna and I have worked well together
over the years and there is no personal difficulty between us.
''Press interest in events almost 20 years old is foolish and prurient
and will not be allowed to drive wedges between hard-working and
dedicated SNP members. Certainly such stories are of no present
relevance to me.''
Before this storm broke, some thought Ms Cunningham's profile as a
Glasgow advocate and party radical -- she has republican, anti-Royalist
views -- was wrong for such a conservative, rural seat.
Close friends claimed last night that as a 42-year-old single woman,
her past was being subjected to unfair scrutiny concerning a long-past
personal relationship with a male partner -- the kind of thing which
would never have been held against a male candidate.
Ms Cunningham is refusing to discuss personal issues but said last
night: ''It is with great regret that I have decided to withdraw my name
from the list of candidates under consideration.
''I don't believe that pursuing my nomination at this stage would be
in the best interests of the by-election or the party.''

SCOTLAND'S longest-running satanic and ritual child sex abuse case
ended yesterday after four years and eight months with three judges
ordering that the eight children from three Ayrshire families be
returned home as soon as possible.
The judges upheld a finding by Sheriff Colin Miller that the
children's removal into care in June 1990 was ''not justified''.
The first of the children returned home yesterday but it will be some
time before the judges' orders to return the seven other children can be
carried out in full.
Complex arrangements are being drawn up to ensure that they can face
the sudden change in circumstances after being held in care for so long.
One girl was just 10 months old when removed and it is not known if
she can now even remember her parents. At least one other child has no
parental memories and will have to be reacquainted.
Scotland's most senior judge, Lord Hope, described the case as ''a
tragedy of immense proportions''.
In his 430-page report, Sheriff Miller, who had carried out a fresh
investigation into the allegations on behalf of the Court of Session,
also found that there was no medical evidence of physical or sexual
abuse.
However, social workers remain unconvinced that the allegations of
paedophile orgies and extreme, systematic, and sadistic corruption of
children did not take place.
Even Sheriff Miller, after 152 days of evidence and four days of
submissions, admitted that large gaps in the evidence still existed.
He said it was ''possible'' this had been a case of sexual abuse but
any evidence of it had been ineptly collected and so ''contaminated''
that it was not possible to prove one way or another on a balance of
probability.
Strathclyde's social work director, Miss Mary Hartnoll, leaped upon
his ''sense of frustration'' when he concluded in his report: ''I cannot
with any certainty come to a view as to the truth of this whole complex,
complicated, and disturbing case.''
Miss Hartnoll also stressed that in August, 1990, another sheriff,
Neil Gow, had found that the children had been sexually abused.
She admitted Sheriff Miller's criticisms of her department were
devastating but also implied that yesterday's result could have been
changed had social work investigations been done differently.
Miss Hartnoll said: ''The first concern of social workers and care
workers is the best interests of the children. In this case, they acted
in difficult and trying circumstances. I will now have to consider the
points raised by Sheriff Miller.
''In 1990, our staff were working in a sensitive area where experience
was limited and guidelines were at an early stage. Certainly, with our
knowledge now, the investigations would have been done differently.''
Following their ruling, the judges then took the unprecedented step of
ordering a 15-year-old girl's immediate release, instantly ending social
workers' control of her life.
Lord Hope, sitting with Lords Allanbridge and Mayfield, was not
prepared to await the return from abroad of Sheriff Miller to dispose
personally of the extraordinary case.
The girl was reunited with her parents yesterday afternoon but it is
likely to be many weeks before all the other the seven children can go
home.
The judges said they were conscious that speed may now be even more
damaging to the children's welfare.
Apart from the two young children, who probably can not even remember
their parents, three others have had no parental contact for three
years.
The judges fully accepted Sheriff Miller's key finding that
''additional evidence has now demonstrated that their removal was not
justified''.
He also found that none of the children had been subjected to sexual
or physical abuse, despite previous clinical evidence to the contrary,
and that none of the drawings and writings of the children could be
relied upon as evidence of abuse.
The sheriff especially condemned the interviewing techniques of three
social workers -- Ms Janis Littlejohn, Ms June Kennedy, and Ms Dawn
Levan -- as so inadequate as to be worthless as evidence.
He criticised their blinkered approach in pursuing a single hypothesis
to the exclusion of all other possible explanations. The sheriff also
criticised the interviewing techniques of care workers and added that
the police constables who were involved lacked effective training.
An appeal is to be lodged on behalf of Mr Frederick Kennedy, Reporter
to Strathclyde Children's Panel. His counsel, Mr Graham Bell, QC,
insisted the sheriff had misdirected himself in law. The appeal will not
prevent the children from going home.
Strathclyde's social work department also defended its conduct in a
case which involved bizarre stories of extreme, systematic, and sadistic
corruption of the children -- including a party game in which naked
children were put in coffin-style boxes or a child had teeth extracted.
Miss Hartnoll stressed that throughout the department's involvement,
social workers always abided by the decisions of the courts and the
children's panel during their dealings with the eight youngsters.
''It is the court that decides on proof -- not social workers,'' she
argued, then added: ''Eighteen months ago, Strathclyde, after
consideration of the Clyde inquiry, introduced new guidelines and
training programmes on recording and interviewing of children. We still
have not received any Scottish guidelines.''
Miss Hartnoll said there had been constant legal battles since the
original judgment and it was unprecedented, and a matter of concern,
that a sheriff's decision should be reversed after almost five years.
The children, from three related families, were taken into care in
June, 1990. Two months later, Sheriff Gow, QC, ruled they had been
victims of sex abuse and that the public must be alerted to ''extreme
depravities and appalling practices''.
Sheriff Miller's report was ordered by the Court of Session as the
only remedy open to the parents after they cast grave doubts on the
grounds of referral upheld by Sheriff Gow.
Lord Hope yesterday called for legislation in the Children (Scotland)
Bill now before Parliament to ensure a similar situation never arose
again.
He also said: ''It is clear from what the sheriff has told us, that a
tragedy of immense proportions has occurred in this case . . . more than
four and a half years have gone by since the children were removed from
their families in circumstances which the additional evidence has now
demonstrated did not justify their removal.
''They must now be reunited with their families and we are anxious
that this should be achieved without any further lapse of time than can
be shown to be necessary.''
Curators, including two clinical psychologists, will be appointed to
advise the court on how soon the children can go home.
One is Dr John Powell, called in by Lord Clyde after the Orkney sex
scandal, and the other is Dr Christine Puckering, of Glasgow University,
who has formed a close relationship with some of the children.
Dr Puckering told Sheriff Miller that social workers simply wanted
their opinions confirmed when interviewing them. She said there had been
massive pressure on some of the children to talk about sex games, and
interviews had been ''most improperly conducted''.
In his report, Sheriff Miller said: ''Her conclusion was that she was
horrified with the interviewing and the procedures, and could not regard
what was produced as a true account of what the children said and
believed.''
One of the mothers described the last five years as ''torture'', and
claimed social workers were responsible for the tragedy. ''It has been
terrible,'' she said. ''I would not want any other family to go through
what me and my husband have been through.''
A lawyer for the families, Mr Paul Burns, said the affair was ''in
many ways a bigger miscarriage of justice than the Birmingham Six''. It
had been absolute hell on earth for the parents.
The investigation had begun when one mother asked her doctor to check
if her three young sons -- then aged six months, three, and five -- had
been sexually abused. The children were taken into care, although it was
claimed no conclusive evidence of abuse had been found or that the
mother was mentally ill at the time. Others followed as inquiries
progressed.
Last night, a child law expert said the years of living hell for the
Ayrshire families had uncanny parallels with the Rochdale ritual abuse
controversy. In both cases, children were removed after allegations of
satanic abuse, which were then criticised.
Mr Allan Levy, QC, who represented some families in Rochdale and
chaired the inquiry into ''pindown-punishment'' which involved locking
children in solitary confinement for long periods, said: ''This is
Rochdale revisited but much worse. I think there are a lot of parallels.
There is a flawed investigation and an unreasoning belief in satanic
abuse.
''At least in Rochdale it was put right within 15 months. These
children have been in care for five years.''
It is not certain whether the families will be able to sue Strathclyde
Regional Council for compensation for their lost years.
The Court of Appeal has ruled local authorities should be immune from
any actions over negligence in investigations of alleged child abuse.
The Law Lords are due to make a judgment on the decision shortly but
it is not known whether it will extend to Scotland.

THE schoolboy who sparked a huge search by running away to Malaysia
enjoyed a swim in a British High Commission pool yesterday after telling
his mother he ''did not know what all the fuss was about''.
Peter Kerry, 14, was found on Sunday night near the border with
Thailand, five days after leaving his home in Harrow, northwest London,
following a family argument over spilt spaghetti.
He went swimming yesterday at the High Commission in Kuala Lumpur.
Later, he was put on a flight home. A Scotland Yard spokesman said he
was due to arrive at Heathrow on a Malaysian Airlines flight at 5.40am
today.
Police, diplomats, and the media launched a massive search for the boy
after he used his father's passport and credit cards to make the
13,000-kilometre journey to Malaysia last Tuesday night.
His mother Pat said yesterday she was too happy that her son had been
found safe to have any feelings of anger about him running away.
She told BBC1's Good Morning programme that she had spoken to him
earlier yesterday.
''He is amazed that people are interested and doesn't know what all
the fuss is about,'' she said.
The boy told her that local people had been very kind to him, giving
him help and money to travel several hundred miles along the length of
the peninsula.
His father, 59-year-old John Kerry, said the argument had started when
Peter thought he was being blamed for spaghetti being spilt on the
floor.
Asked how much money their son had used on the credit cards, Mr and
Mrs Kerry said they did not know and did not want to think about it.
Peter used his father's passport after his own had been locked away
following a previous attempt to flee to Paris.
He was found after being sighted in the town of Kota Baru following
pictures and lengthy pieces about him in local papers.
Mr Kerry said when news was relayed to him that his son had been
traced: ''I just thought all of a sudden it was a lovely day.''
Malaysia's deputy home minister Megat Junid Megat Ayob said the boy
was being allowed to leave ''on humanitarian grounds''.
''It's a small issue. Let the British High Commission and (Malaysian)
immigration work out the matter,'' he said. ''The boy is a minor. Let's
send him back as soon as possible.''
Mr Hans Crakauer, a director of the International Air Passengers'
Association, said he would be calling for a full inquiry into the
affair.
''It upsets us because we see a systems failure,'' he said.
''The first failure was when the boy was able to buy a ticket without
properly identifying himself. The second was at the check-in desk, where
it seems the handling agent was only interested in the validation time
of the passport.''
Mr Crakauer told Radio 4's The World At One: ''The implications are:
what happens if a child does not identify himself? You have a missing
child running around the air system which is going to create havoc
everywhere.
''Then there are parents of rather enterprising children, who are now
going to think, 'Well, my young man is likely to try something like this
also'. And then, of course, you have a security issue.''
Dr Alan Robinson, headmaster of Peter's school, Langley Grammar, near
Slough, said his teachers and classmates would be glad to see him safely
back.
''There was some amusement among his fellow pupils but also a great
deal of concern for his safety,'' he said.
He described the boy as a good, conscientious pupil who had never
misbehaved at school. His teachers would not be treating him any
differently when he returned.

A SPECIAL care baby unit was closed yesterday after a baby died and
three others became ill from infection.
Doctors revealed last night that one baby girl had died, two other
babies are ''very unwell'', and a fourth is ''stable''.
The unit, at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, has been closed to prevent
the spread of bacterial infection. An investigation is to be launched.
The decision to close the unit was taken yesterday following the death
of the two-week-old girl on Sunday night.
The baby, who had been admitted to the unit suffering from breathing
difficulties, died after contracting a bacterial lung infection called
klebsiella.
Two other babies are being treated for different strains of the same
infection. A fourth baby is under treatment and is suspected to be
suffering from infection by the E-coli virus.
They were among 13 babies in the unit.
0 Medical staff have discovered a ''higher than normal cluster of
different types of bacterial infection'' in the unit, which treats
premature and very ill babies.
A spokesman said that, for such babies, ''any additional source of
infection immediately becomes a matter of considerable concern''.
Scientists from the hospital's medical microbiology department are
working with medical and nursing staff to trace the source of the
infection.

NOISY neighbours are no laughing matter but Edinburgh District Council
is to use a cartoon to get that message across.
Housing convener Mary Mulligan yesterday introduced the Rammy Street
Neighbours, a comic strip featuring families no-one would want living
next door. The cartoons will run in free papers, tenants' magazines, and
form the basis of a poster campaign.
The district council housing department deals with around 2500
complaints every year and the complaints are increasing.
''Noise is the number one problem our tenants experience with their
neighbours,'' said Councillor Mulligan. ''Most people don't mind
occasional parties if they are warned in advance but parties every
night, screaming arguments, and persistently barking dogs can make the
lives of surrounding families a nightmare.''
Councillor Mulligan said council tenants could complain to the housing
department, the Environmental Services duty officer or the police.
Lothian and Borders Police deal with thousands of noise complaints
every year -- the majority connected with house or car alarms. A
spokesman said that, last year, 55 people had been reported to the
procurator-fiscal under the Civic Government Scotland Act.

A MAN murdered his estranged wife in a frenzied stabbing attack after
being led to her new address by information legitimately revealed to him
by the Children's Panel Office involved in the couple's custody battle
over their two young sons, a High Court judge was told yesterday.
As a result, the Reporter to the Central Region Panel, Mr John Harris,
plans to seek a review at national level of legislation covering the
disclosure of sensitive information, in an attempt to strengthen the
protection of parents and children involved in such cases.
Home Office Minister, Mr Michael Forsyth, who was in Stirling on
constituency business yesterday, expressed extreme concern about the
case and said he would be raising the matter with Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang.
The apparent loophole in existing law was highlighted at the High
Court in Edinburgh, when a former social worker, aged 34, of Aberdeen,
was jailed for life for the murder of his 33-year-old wife, at the house
she had been provided with in Stirling after she took refuge in a
Women's Aid hostel.
The man admitted stabbing her repeatedly in Stirling, on November 5
last year.
Lord Abernethy was told the woman suffered 16 stab wounds, one of them
in the heart, and five cuts in the attack, and that one of their
children was hiding in a cupboard as it happened. The court was told the
couple split in June, 1993.
Defending, Mr Donald Findlay, QC, said the couple had reached a
position where they were ''at war'' with each other about the continuing
welfare of the children, and had become ''totally entrenched''. There
was no middle ground.
He stressed he was not criticising any individual over the policy
which revealed the victim's address, but added: ''It is a practice which
is a little lacking in wisdom if applied broadly, and it may be
something that ought to be looked at more carefully in the light of each
individual case.''
Mr Findlay, who described it as ''a case of utter tragedy'', said he
hoped someone would look at the policy on the release of information and
decide if it was ''a wise and sound practice''. The man's main concern
now was whether he would lose contact with his children.
Jailing him for life, Lord Abernethy said the circumstances were ''a
history that is terrible and tragic in its consequences''.
Mr Harris last night spoke of his, and his staff's, shock and sadness
at the woman's death. ''Our aim is to protect the welfare and care needs
of any child referred to us, and as this particular case is still under
way, we cannot give any details surrounding the children.''
He added: ''By law, parents have an absolute right of attendance at
all stages of any Children's Hearing discussing their child's case, so
we do have to get in touch to keep them informed. This is not a question
of procedure, but one of legislation.
''However, in the light of recent events, we will be calling for a
review of this legislation at national level, to strengthen the level of
protection for children and parents.''
Stirling Women's Aid claimed the Reporter's Office was repeatedly
warned that the woman's life was at risk, but had twice allowed her
''murderous'' husband to track her down.
A spokeswoman said the organisation complained after the Reporter's
Office released the address of its refuge to the man, who had turned up
when his wife was out and was aggressive and abusive to staff.
Calling for an inquiry, she said: ''Here was a woman murdered by a
man, and even though it was very well known that this was liable to
happen, society was unable to protect her.''

OPPOSING views of the money trader who broke the Barings merchant bank
emerged yesterday. A member of the Baring family called him ''a young
idiot of a boy''. A member of his own family said he was ''no jack the
lad''.
Mr Julian Baring, of Bradley, near Winchester, Hampshire, first heard
about the crisis when he was tipped off by a manager at the bank over
the weekend. Administrators have since frozen the assets.
Mr Baring's wife -- who referred to herself as Mrs Julian Baring --
said: ''This has all been caused by a young idiot of a boy. The family
is trying to work something out but it is still early days. It is all a
bit shattering but there is nothing you can do. We are still trying to
come to terms with it.
''The whole family is rallying around. We just hope there will be a
rescue operation.''
The bank's chairman said last night he believed the bank may have been
ruined deliberately by the trader in Singapore who intended to make
money for himself.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Peter Baring said
28-year-old Nick Leeson, now on the run in south-east Asia, could have
had an accomplice in the alleged fraud.
He emphasised that what actually occurred would only come to light
with a detailed inquiry.
''We simply cannot yet know exactly what happened. It is difficult to
get a fix on the motivation of this fellow,'' he told the FT.
Mr Baring's hypothesis is at odds with what has been assumed so far --
that Mr Leeson gambled more money in a desperate and genuine attempt to
try to cover his massive losses.
A spokesman for the Bank of England said: ''Plainly the losses that
Barings suffered were caused by the actions of a single trader, but we
have no direct knowledge or evidence about what motivated him.''
Mr Leeson could have been ''receiving inducements'', but equally he
could have been simply gambling and then having to ''double and redouble
to try to cover and recoup his losses''.
The existence of a partner for Mr Leeson would be one of the questions
looked at by the investigation announced by the Board of Banking
Supervisors, he said.
Sterling fell to its lowest level yet against the German mark as the
collapse of the bank, one of the oldest institutions in the City,
exposed it to fresh selling.
However, shares prices held up much better than had been feared and
losses were limited.
The missing dealer, it emerged, failed his A-level maths exam but
still got a job with the bankers Coutts. He managed only an F grade in
his exam, Mr Brian Coulshed, his headmaster at Parmiter's School,
Watford, said. ''I think he was a good mathematician. It may be that he
did not work as hard in the sixth form as he did in his O-levels.''
Until last Thursday, he worked in the Singapore office of Barings. He
has not been seen since running up debts of around #600m and is being
hunted by Malaysian police after apparently slipping over the border
from Singapore, where he rented a #4000-a-month flat.
Colleagues in Singapore variously described the futures trader with
slightly thinning hair and an open smile as brilliant, friendly, and
quietly confident.
An urgent inquiry was ordered yesterday by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke
into the collapse. Later, Mr Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of
England, revealed that Mr Leeson had taken unauthorised trading
positions totalling #17,000m.
He told a news conference at the Bank that Mr Leeson had bought
Japanese equities contracts to the tune of about #4000m and had also
taken a ''short'' position in Japanese interest-rate contracts --
selling financial instruments he did not own in the hope of being able
to buy them back more cheaply -- worth about #12,000m at face value.
Mr George said the Bank's desperate efforts over the weekend to rescue
Barings had came close to succeeding but failed because it had not been
possible to put a cap on the extent of the bank's potential losses.
The father of Mr Leeson's wife said yesterday he was proud to call the
missing trader his son-in-law.
Mr Alex Sims, a printer, said Mr Leeson was ''no jack the lad''.
Mr Leeson married Miss Lisa Sims, 23, in March 1992 in West Kingsdown,
Kent.
Mr Sims insisted: ''He is a genuinely nice guy and I'm proud to call
him a son-in-law.
''However, I am very, very concerned for his well-being now as well as
Lisa's.
''He is not the sort who would do anything silly but I don't know why
they haven't got in touch. I just wish they would call to tell me they
are safe.''
Mrs Leeson worked at Barings as a stockbrokers' clerk and is now
unemployed.
At his four-bedroomed house in West Kingsdown, Mr Sims said: ''I can't
believe this is happening.
''Nick is such a quiet lad, and I mean really quiet. He worked for
Barings in Indonesia before moving to Singapore after he married Lisa.
''He doesn't have any hobbies as such, he is dedicated to his work.
''I don't believe for a moment he is the only one involved in this. It
seems he is being made some sort of scapegoat and having everything
blamed on him.
''I know Nick is innocent and that all this will work out in the end.
He has been painted as a council house yuppie but that's not really
him.''
A futures trader at a Japanese house working in the Singapore
International Monetary Exchange said: ''Before this thing happened, we
thought he was very brilliant, the most confident trader around town.
''He seems to be able to move markets. Every day, we would monitor
what he's doing.''
Rumours in the market were that last year his bonus was at least #1m
-- and as high as #2.5m.

LABOUR last night suspended four constituency parties in Birmingham as
it launched an inquiry into claims that up to #2m of taxpayers' money
was being used to buy the support of party members.
The suspended parties, which will now be unable to meet or operate,
are Ladywood, Perry Barr, Small Heath, and Sparkbrook.
Concern focuses on the distribution of housing renovation grants in
inner city wards across Birmingham.
An internal party inquiry will investigate claims that a few
councillors are allowing thousands of Labour Party members to jump
queues, as long as four years, for the grants.
The Observer newspaper estimated in a report on Sunday that about 9000
people have been offered grants of up to #20,000.
The immediate focus of the allegations is said to be Sparkbrook, the
seat represented by former deputy Labour leader Roy Hattersley, who is
stepping down at the next election.
Allegedly, the grants were given to Labour Party members in return for
their support for one of the factions fighting to win the safe seat.
Small Heath is said to be the focus of concern, because half the
applicants for the grants there are allegedly party members.
Labour's Small Heath MP Roger Godsiff is believed to be looking for a
new seat because his own will disappear at the next election in boundary
changes.
He can either try to win Sparkbrook, or the Ladywood stronghold of
Clare Short.
Mr Godsiff was at the centre of a row over his original selection
battle for Small Heath before the last election, amid allegations that
the GMB, his union, had funded membership subscriptions.
Last night, Mr Godsiff denied he had done anything illegal and urged
the police to investigate.
He told the BBC: ''Whatever Tony Blair (Labour leader) or anybody else
says, it is going to the chief constable and he will investigate it
because they are serious allegations and the people of Birmingham need
to be reassured that their Members of Parliament and their councillors
and their city council are clean.''
Ms Theresa Stewart, leader of Labour-run Birmingham City Council, has
asked the council's chief executive and the district auditor to check
all applications.
She has pledged to take immediate action if any impropriety is
discovered.
