POLICE in Glasgow and Edinburgh are investigating new incidents
involving bogus social workers who demanded access to young children.
In Glasgow, a man in his mid-thirties called at Ms Mary Lochrie's home
in a block of flats in Charles Street and said he had come to take her
two young children away under the day-release scheme.
She became suspicious and asked the man to wait on the doorstep before
calling the social services. By the time she had made the call, the man
had disappeared. Yesterday, speaking from her home, she said she was too
distraught to talk about the incident.
In Edinburgh, a well-spoken woman called at a flat at Hermiston Court,
Sighthill, on Tuesday, claimed to be a social worker and said she needed
to see eight-week-old Danielle Hardie.
The baby's father, Mr Mark Hardie, later said the woman involved was
''sick''. She had concealed part of an ID card with her finger but then
looked nervously towards a stair door and left abruptly when told
Danielle and her mother were out.
Mr Hardie, 21, said he became more anxious after telling the woman his
wife Irene, 23, and their other daughter Nicola, 2, were at a nearby
post office.
When the woman left, saying she did not know they had another child,
he became suspicious and frightened, realising he had indicated his
family's whereabouts. He called the police and went to the post office,
where he found them unharmed.
''A next-door neighbour told me there was a woman at the door three
weeks ago asking for Irene by name and we still don't know who it was.''
The woman is said to be 6ft, with ginger hair, and in her late 30s.
She wore a black hat and bright red lipstick.
Detective Chief Inspector George Brown said: ''Nothing happened on
this occasion but one has to be concerned about the motive for this call
and the others in the past.''
Yesterday, Lothian detectives said they could not rule out the
possibility of a link to similar incidents.
Last March, a special squad was formed by Lothian and Borders Police
to co-ordinate inquiries into a spate of incidents where a woman acting
alone and, on other occasions, a couple, asked to see young children.It
was disbanded earlier this year.
* A bogus workman stole a television set from a 72-year-old woman
after tricking his way into her home in Charles Street, Glasgow.
A police spokesman said: ''The man produced some sort of
identification card, entered the woman's house, and engaged her in
conversation regarding a fault in her TV. The man then proceeded to
remove the television for repair. The woman was unable to prevent it.''

THE NEL Technology Park in East Kilbride is to move into a new era
with a new name -- the Scottish Enterprise Technology Park.
Lanarkshire Development Agency chief executive Archie Bethel took the
wraps off new signs at the park, which revealed its new identity.
The 77-acre park is now owned by Scottish Enterprise and Lanarkshire
Development Agency following the transfer of the site from the
Department of Trade and Industry last year.
LDA has already spent more than #800,000 in revamping facilities,
creating new development opportunities and offering business development
support. Now LDA is working with its partners to bring forward a further
major investment package for the park later this year.
The former National Engineering Laboratory remains an integral part of
the park and is unaffected by the change of ownership.
Explaining the name-change, LDA chief executive Archie Bethel said:
''The Scottish Enterprise Technology Park has a huge potential to
attract new industry and investment from Scotland, the UK and overseas.
''While the NEL name is known within Scotland as a centre of
excellence, we want to give the park itself a wider profile throughout
the UK and abroad, if possible. The new name and the new property
opportunities coming through will boost our efforts to promote the park
both at home and abroad as a location for technology-based business.
''At the moment, the park has huge untapped potential. With a new
direction, we believe it can make a major contribution towards
continuing the economic success of East Kilbride.''
LDA has already contributed more than #200,000 for a major
refurbishment of the James Watt Business Centre to create new facilities
and self-contained office suites.
In addition, the agency has invested more than #36,000 in the new
Strathclyde Software Innovation Centre, based in the James Watt
Building, which is also home to LDA's flagship new venture initiative,
the Entrepreneurship Programme.
LDA has spent more than #500,000 demolishing obsolete buildings to
create development sites and refurbishing redundant property for light
industrial use.
The agency has also succeeded in attracting inward investment
companies to the park.
Last year, LDA assisted the Arizona-based Cerprobe Corporation to
establish a new $1m manufacturing, repair and administration centre at
the park. The company will make probe cards and other products used in
the testing of integrated circuits and microelectronics components.
Electronics giant Motorola has also moved into vacant space at the park.
Archie Bethel added: ''We hope to bring forward further development
plans later this year to enhance the park and develop its potential to
attract new industry, jobs and investment.''

LESLEY Garrett has been called the people's soprano -- the sensuous
woman who put sex into opera. She is also the woman who took an art form
perceived as elitist and made it accessible and popular. One of the few
opera singers to have appeared on TV shows where she has been seen doing
everything, from trampling tomatoes in a bucket, to posing in a bath,
and receiving a ''Gotcha Oscar'' from Noel Edmonds -- not something you
expect from the Dames Joan, Kiri, and Janet -- Garrett has performed on
everything from Last Night of the Proms to The Word, as well as singing
her heart out in the classics.
All this fame and fortune and burgeoning creativity she puts down to
her marital status. After a failed first marriage (the fact that it
foundered still makes her sad), she had virtually resigned herself to
the single lifestyle. ''But I was invited out on a blind date by the
pianist Imogen Cooper and her other half, who are great friends of mine,
and as soon as I saw Peter across the dressing-room when they brought
him round after a performance, I thought, 'there's the man I want to
live with'. He asked me out to lunch -- and I moved in!''
Peter is a North London doctor and when I ask Garrett what the good
doctor's surname is, she laughs and replies: ''Do you mind very much if
I don't tell you? You see, when his patients read who his wife is, they
go in for their appointments, spend 15 minutes talking about opera, and
then on the way out, they say, 'Oh, about this rash . . . ' I don't want
to intrude in any way on his career in that sense.''
Since that fateful meeting, she says she has gone ''creatively
berserk'', making records, travelling, giving concerts, appearing on
television, doing interviews, and having children. The couple now have
two, Jeremy, who is two, and Chloe, 20 months. Garrett does not think
there will be any more -- ''it's pretty idyllic as it is and I don't
want to push my luck''. Being pregnant rounded out and expanded her
voice, she claims, to a point where she is now, as she enters her
forties, actively looking at other roles to sing.
Not that she will have any difficulty at all in persuading the major
opera companies to employ her. Lesley Garrett is undeniably a hot
property. Her albums (a new one, of operettas, is due out later this
year) sell in hundreds of thousands. Diva has sold 60,000 copies since
its release in 1991 and was in the UK classical chart for more than two
years while Prima Donna entered the British classical artists' chart at
No 2 in 1992. At Christmas, 1993, she got to No 16 in the general hit
parade with the single of Ave Maria.
When we met, she was just off to America on a 10-day recital tour.
Recently she finished a run of Janacek's The Cunning Little Vixen at the
Coliseum in London, for which she won rave reviews.
''I read them all,'' she admits. ''I'm not a luvvie,'' she laughs,
doing a mock swoon, hand to head, ''who protests that the critics are
outwith their orbit. One notice was so good that I think I shall kiss
the critic next time I see him.''
And she probably will, too.
Garrett has also just made an hour-long Easter show for BBC2, Viva La
Diva, and she will have her own TV series later this year. So far she
has persuaded cellist Julian Lloyd Webber and rising baritone star Jason
Howard to join her in what will certainly be compelling viewing and
listening.
''When you do these things, you have to do them properly,'' she
insists. She told the BBC that she did not want to be just another
singer warbling in front of an orchestra.
''The audience has to know what is going on, and the music has to be
put in context. But, above all, it has to appeal,''she said.
The show will therefore have a full symphony orchestra to provide the
backing and Garrett will be in frocks by David Emmanuel -- ''he is
designing something for me that will be very versatile . . . I can take
bits off, put bits on. I think it will be rather spectacular.''
The down-to-earth, working-class Yorkshire lass (the eldest of three
girls, she was born in her grandmother's bed in a council house in the
small town of Thorne near Doncaster in 1955) is looking elegantly
stylish today in rehearsal gear of green top, scarf, and dark jeans worn
with high-heeled boots.
Her earrings are so amazing they look as if they might have once
belonged to Lucrezia Borgia. As we talk she runs her fingers through her
mane of dark, reddish-brown hair, which looks ever more rumpled as the
conversation goes on.
Garrett first found fame and notoriety in Richard Jones's ENO
production of Die Fledermaus (1988), in which she denies she ever did a
strip-tease. It was apparently ''a very fleeting moment of artistic
nudity, which was just part of a show that was full of extraordinary
visual moments. It was a crazy, wonderful, visually extravagant evening
of which my bottom was the sensation. I completely upstaged the whole
thing''.
So it comes as no suprise to learn that her mission in life is to
convince people that opera can be fun and stimulating -- ''opera is full
of passion and passion is part of all our lives''. If people buy a
record or CD by her and it shows a photograph of wild passion on the
sleeve, then she maintains that's what they will hear on the record.
She loves having her photograph taken and has been snapped in some
very slinky poses indeed, draped sexily over pianos in designer
creations, all of which, she says, shows her love of fantasy. She
actually likes meeting the public, unlike some performers, and
thoroughly relishes signing sessions for her CDs -- ''How else can you
talk to people and find out what they like and think?'' she asks.
There was always music in the family. Mum plays the piano and dad, who
worked for British Rail before becoming a teacher and finally a
headmaster, is an enthusiastic singer.
''It never occurred to me that opera was supposed to be elitist, out
of the normal ken,'' she says. ''It was only when I went to music
college that I discovered that not everyone had it so richly entwined in
their lives. But I have to tell you that it wasn't all heady, highbrow
stuff. We sang pop, ballads, anything that came to hand at home.''
In fact, Garrett is an avid viewer of Top of the Pops.
''Not that I like all the music -- far from it -- but I do think that
we can learn from the techniques of others. You have to remember that
opera stars at the turn of the century and onwards, Caruso, Melba,
Tetrazini, were all treated like pop stars are today. They had no
problems with singing material that wasn't from the operatic repertoire,
so I am not sure that this crossover thing is anything new.
''Already, Jeremy and Chloe are showing signs of appreciating all
sorts of music. They bounce up and down, beating double time.''
Her husband and young family are important to her, so she doesn't like
to be away from them for long.
''I did some concerts which took me away for a few days abroad and I
ached to be home. I was weeping every night, missing the kids. When I
got back, Jeremy just said: 'Oh hello, Mummy' and he clearly hadn't even
noticed I'd been away!
''We have a daytime nanny, which is a blessing. But I want to be with
them as much as I can while they are growing up. If I got an offer from
the Met in New York, say, or Sydney Opera House, I'd love to do it, but
the kids would have to come with me. Peter fully understands that.''
And is the doctor musical?
''He hums all around the house,'' says Garrett. ''Snatches of hum
here, there and everywhere. It drives me BARMY!''
Plans for the future include a new ENO production of Weill's The Rise
and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, in which she will play the lead part
of Jenny and . . . ''Whew! my operetta album in the summer. I just hope
I can keep up with myself.''
Her life is so full, says Garrett, that she does it all ''on adrenalin
and some sort of natural energy tap''.
To get away from it all -- ''it sounds dreadfully corny but music is
my life, my career, and my hobby and I live for that and my family'' --
the family is off to Italy in August to a location where there are no
opera houses, no phones, and no faxes.
They also have a home in Yorkshire, near Epworth on the Isle of
Axholme, which Garrett bought before her marriage when she was still a
bachelor girl. She loves to return to Yorkshire and the Garrett family
-- ''a right Yorkshire mafia'', she declares.
* Viva La Diva -- A Night at the Opera with Lesley Garrett is on BBC2
tomorrow at 9.30pm.

LAWRENCE Stove saw many wonderful sights when he sailed around the
world as a professional crewman, but the memory that stayed with him was
-- ostriches.
He returned to the UK last year and decided to settle in Glasgow and
launched Caledonian Ostriches Limited!
''I first saw an ostrich farm in the United States in 1991, then two
years later I saw more in Australia, then when I visited South Africa I
discovered it was big business,'' he explained.
The ostrich farm industry in the United Kingdom is very small with
only around 4000 ostriches being farmed.
''The present stock in this country is being used for breeding
purposes until there are enough birds here to supply ostrich meat to the
food industry,'' said Mr Stove.
This shortage of birds gave him the idea of investing in breeding
ostriches and he went along to a Scottish Business Shop with the idea
where he met David Deane of Henderson Boyd Jackson who liked the idea
and introduced the budding entrepreneur to the Bank of Scotland.
''At first I thought of starting a farm,'' said Mr Stove, ''but it was
too expensive and I decided to invest in breeding stock and pay a farmer
to look after my ostriches for me.''
Now Caledonian Ostriches is offering investors the opportunity to
invest in ostriches by buying a pair of chicks, and then when the young
ostriches start breeding selling them on.
''The cost of buying two young chicks, and then having them liveried
on a farm costs around #8500 over two years with the purchase price of
the chicks being #4500 of this figure.
''The birds start breeding after two years and a fertile breeding pair
of ostriches can produce between 20 and 30 chicks a year over a period
of 40 years,'' explained Mr Stove but investors take the risk that their
pair might not produce fertile eggs.
''There is an obvious risk involved,'' he said, ''but if people have
money to invest which they can afford to take a risk with then I believe
it is a worthwhile investment.''
In order to supply even 1% of the British meat market 250,000
ostriches would have to be slaughtered each year and this will require a
huge increase in the present breeding stock.

SCOTLAND'S retail industry has suffered a further slump in sales even
after reporting its bleakest figures for four years in the run-up to
Christmas.
Geoff Runcie, chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, said
yesterday that the ongoing fall in demand was ''very worrying''.
He said that chamber members, often running medium-sized retail
businesses, are almost without exception ''very depressed'' about the
continuing lack of custom.
Mr Runcie added that the public's reluctance to spend was having a
serious impact on retailers, and acknowledged a lack of the elusive
''feel-good'' factor may be to blame: ''It is a fact of life that a
feel-good factor influences expenditure levels.''
Cliff Lockyer, senior lecturer at the Fraser of Allander Institute,
confirmed that one reason for the slump experienced before -- and well
after -- Christmas may be a sense of insecurity among shoppers.
He suspected the insecurity was based on concerns about growing trends
towards part-time rather than full-time employment, even at a time when
unemployment figures are again falling.
Mr Runcie warned retailers are virtually powerless to boost income,
having already tried all sorts of schemes to encourage sales.
However, there were signs that the fall in demand has slowed down
since December, and that sales will begin to pick up over the next few
months.
The comments came on release of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce
latest quarterly business survey, involving 1018 firms.
The report, compiled by Fraser of Allander, was at least upbeat in
finding that sales have risen again in manufacturing and construction,
with demand also increasing in tourism.
Forecasts were for further growth in these sectors over the next
quarter, although the chambers are concerned it may not result in
full-time jobs growth.  They remain worried at shifts towards part-time
or temporary employment, and also predict a continuing low level of
demand for labour. Downward trends in employment were reported by
members in oil, manufacturing, retail and finance.
Mr Lockyer said the survey suggested that, overall, steady progress
was being made in economic recovery, with manufacturing, construction
and wholesale showing increases in sales or orders.

Interest in alternative therapies has increased since the sixties.
ELIZABETH WESTCOTT reports on the nature of a school of thinking which
goes beyond those prescriptions accepted in traditional circles
HOLISTIC healing, with its laying on of hands, its language of
crystals, auras and meditation, does not consort easily with our
objective, empirical mentality. Yet since the 1960s, when the so-called
New Age was ushered in, our interest in alternative therapies has
definitely increased.
Already in Scotland there are several schools in reflexology and
aromatherapy, and in May the Scottish School of Holistic Healing will
open at Stirling University. Alternative therapist Brigid Gallagher, the
school's principal, says there is a great demand for this kind of
knowledge.
''This is the first school of its kind in Scotland. During my years as
a therapist I've become more aware of the need for a school like this,''
she said.
The school will offer a two-year course in hands-on healing, with
colour and crystal healing available as options. Aromatherapy and
reflexology will not be covered, as they are taught elsewhere. Students
undertaking the course will also be trained in the practicalities: how
to deal with the financial and promotional aspects of setting up a
business.
''A person could be a good healer, but could also be quiet and
reserved -- many people are in this business. People have to learn how
to promote themselves,'' says Gallagher.
Hands-on healing may sound like a mysterious process to the
uninitiated, but according to Gallagher it is a therapy that can be
taught like any other. The difference lies in what is actually being
healed: the laying on of hands aims to mend the emotions, mind and
spirit, as well as the physical body.
''I always compare the laying on of hands to being like a catalyst. We
attempt to kickstart the body into healing itself,'' explains Gallagher.
''Sometimes illness is a learning process. Very often it comes from
feelings people have had for a long time, like resentment, fear or
anger. I think the medical profession is beginning to recognise that a
high percentage of illnesses have emotional causes.''
Scientific? Unscientific? Gallagher says the question is not really
relevant to holistic healing. What is important is the patient's
experience of the treatment.
''I don't think it needs to be proved. Very often people are ill and
they don't know why. Healing reveals the reason. It doesn't matter what
Joe Bloggs thinks, so long as the patients know what they experienced. I
don't have a problem with cynics in my workshops -- quite often it's the
cynical people who have something proved to them who turn out to be the
best allies.''
Like many alternative therapies, the mechanics of exactly what happens
are difficult to pin down, but the nature of hands-on healing certainly
begs the question: Is there some sort of transfer of energy from healer
to patient?
''That's what I don't know,'' says Gallagher. ''Some scientists have
looked into it. It is certainly very easy to give away your own energy
and become depleted, but healers are trained not to do that. Instead, we
act as a channel for outside energy to flow through.
''There are lots of theories, but you don't have to have any
particular sort of spiritual belief for it to work. The second thing
that happens is some kind of re-balancing. As the healer tunes into the
patient, they're sussing out where the imbalance is.''
Another fascinating aspect of the course will be learning how to see
people's auras and how to use that information in healing. ''An aura is
a sea of energy that surrounds everyone. If you train yourself you can
actually see colours around people. Sometimes it will tell you what's
happening in the physical body, like an inflammation or lack of energy.
You can also tune into the emotions, or what gifts people have. The
majority of people in my night class can already see colours around
people,'' reveals Gallagher.
''Meditation and relaxation can open up your intuition and your
awareness -- in fact, meditation aids all these gifts. We'll also be
looking at healing ourselves. If you can't deal with the bad bits in
yourself, you can't possibly heal others.''
Much of the knowledge for holistic healing, including the use of
crystals and colours, has existed in other cultures for aeons, as
Gallagher points out. ''American Indians and Australian Aborigines have
always been clued into this. It is only now that we're getting on the
bandwagon.''
* The course will start in May, with a second intake in autumn. If you
are interested please send your enquiries to Brigid Gallagher, Ardsonas,
Sauchieburn, Bannockburn, FK7 9PZ.

TOTAL returns on Scottish commercial property continue their downward
trend, according to the Richard Ellis Scottish Monthly Index prepared
exclusively for The Herald.
All Property fell from 18.3% in February to 14.7% for the year to
March. Offices held up well, falling from 19.8% to 17.9% in March, while
annual rates of return for the retail and industrial sectors fell to
11.6% and 14.6% respectively.
The annual rate of capital growth continued to slow across all
sectors. However, the month-on-month figure reflected a different
pattern. The retail sector, having experienced negative month-on-month
capital growth in February, improved to 0.0% ie stable capital values.
Industrial values fell slightly from 0.0% to -0.2%, while capital
growth in the office sector remained unchanged at 0.2%. As a result, the
All Property rate improved from -0.1% in February to 0.1% this month.
Rental growth over the past 12 months has remained stable at -1.4%
within the office sector but has fallen in the industrial sector to 0.3%
this month. The retail sector has experienced an improvement in rental
growth from 0.7% to 1.4% in March.
Overall rental growth for All Property has remained at 0.2%
year-on-year and has improved to 0.2% on the month, so that rental
growth has returned to the market for the first time since May, 1994.

THE forthcoming two-day LAN '95 network computing conference and
exhibition at Edinburgh's International Conference Centre has been
described as the most influential of its kind of event held anywhere to
date.
The words came from Mr Bob Downes, Director of Industry and Skills for
Scottish Enterprise, and he should know being one of the country's
leading experts in computer-led developments and an advocate of what
represents a rapidly-emerging new breed of global network users.
LAN '95 -- standing for Local Area Network -- aims to reflect what
organisers describe as the exponential growth and reach of networks into
the smallest branch office and nomadic network users.
The latest big name international computing company to signal its
participation in the conference is Spider Systems, from Edinburgh,
taking the total of top companies who will apear to 15.
The event, with 400 delegates and 4000 exhibition visitors expected,
is timely in an era of personal banking, home shopping, entertainment
education, video, television and radio on demand, together with various
other on-line services.
There is no escape from the reaches of the extended network at a time
when thousands of people are desperate to understand more about the
much-vaunted Information Superhigway, especially businesses who need to
know how they can gain that much needed competitive advantage in the
marketplace.
Some of the world's largest IT companies have already ''bought'' into
the concept and are committed to support the Edinburgh event. These
include Novell, the main sponsors who attended the official launch in
Edinburgh, IBM, Microsoft, Intel, Apple, Bay Networks, Sony, Lotus and
Anixter, together with the newly-formed Scottish Telecom and of course
Scottish Enterprise.
Scotland has been chosen for LAN '95 because it is internationally
regarded as a centre for innovation, and the conference will provide the
country with an opportunity to take a leading role in an information
revolution.
All the major advanced and emerging network computing technologies
will be switched on live in an internetworked exercise. Meanwhile a
panel of the foremost experts in networking will be flown over from all
over the world to take part in a LAN '95 forum.
Mr Downes, who lectures at both Styrathclyde and Glasgow universities
and also finds time to be director of a UK training company, said: ''As
well as being the most influential event of its kind to date, it is
fitting it is being staged in Scotland where there is a total of 400
software companies already in existance.
''They are vital to the Scottish economy and collectively represented
a bewildering kaleidoscope of opportunity open to everyone involved,''
he added.
Mr Ian Fraser, Novell vice-president for Europe, the Middle East and
Africa, said at the launch: ''Lan '95 is of vital significance not only
to the decision makers but also to small to medium-sized businesses and
the home-based small networks.
Mr Bruce Thomson, Director of LAN Media the specialist IT marketing
events company, said: ''Leading networking players will give strategic
messages, present technology foundation studies and there will be
educational hands-on interactive demonstrations.''

Janet Reid finds a theatre company which is feeling the benefits of
smiling in the face of adversity
VALUE for money: a worthy slogan. But not the sort of battle-cry to
ignite the emotions, not the sort of script to foster visionary spirit,
imagination or excitement -- all essential elements which underpin the
work of an arts-based company.
Nonetheless, the past 10 years have seen an ever-more thrifty and
careful approach to the distribution of local, regional and central
government funds to the arts: value for money is paramount.
And contrary to all expectations, this frugality has provided one arts
company with enormous opportunities. So says Liz Gardiner, the artistic
director of Fablevision. A professional theatre company based in Govan,
Fablevision aims to make theatre, and the process of theatre
accessibility, available to people of all ages and abilities.
In the context of shrinking funding from central bodies Fablevision's
position as a private limited company with charitable status has, she
says, concentrated the minds of its directors so well that it is now
more in touch with the real needs of its clients, and therefore able to
respond all the more effectively.
And so while this year sees Fablevision celebrating its 10th birthday,
and while these 10 years have seen a decline in the generosity of grant
aid, the company has, nonetheless, continued to grow and establish
itself firmly as a powerful force in educational and community projects
all over Scotland. And Liz Gardiner, who at first resented Government
parsimony, feeling that Fablevision's artistic integrity would be
undermined by financial constraints, now welcomes the challenge of
providing useful skills which are of real value to the community.
Though the bulk of the company's income still comes from Government
bodies, most now comes in the form of payments for services rendered,
rather than as grants. And, paradoxically, this more business-like and
less self-indulgent attitude to its paymasters and to its work has, she
says, made Fablevision's achievements all the more exciting and more
worthwhile.
Fablevision was founded by Gardiner and two fellow thespians in 1985.
Its mission was to involve people of all ages and capacities in theatre,
and, through theatre, to arouse their interest in and concern for
current social, historical and cultural issues. The company achieves
this in a variety of ways: sometimes working with mixed ability groups
enabling them to mount their own theatre; sometimes touring professional
shows with teacher packs and workshop programmes.
One of Fablevision's first projects was Chrysalis -- a touring show
without words. This was a very visual show designed to make an impact on
deaf and mentally handicapped people throughout Scotland.
Another was helping in the establishment of Paisley Youth Theatre --
now one of the most successful theatres in Britain. And when Glasgow had
its year as City of Culture in 1990, Fablevision was instrumental in the
foundation of Birds of Paradise, a fully-integrated, mixed-ability
theatre company, which has continued to put on shows to critical
acclaim.
Since then Fablevision has but up a large body of very successful
community and education-based productions, each time bringing in a
number of different people for the individual project -- freelance
actors, designers, writers and musicians -- and co-ordinating all the
variety of skills required.
Currently it is involved in several different productions. One which
Gardiner is particularly excited about because of its relevance and
usefulness the Theatre in Education Drugs Awareness Project. This is an
unique collaboration between the Govan Addiction Services Project and
Fablevision. It draws on the skills and expertise of both organisations
and creates an informative, sensitive and dramatic piece of educational
theatre which is fast-moving, highly visual and, she says, totally
accessible to young people.
This project involved the services of two actors, a musician, and
Gardiner. It was funded by the Argyll and Clyde Health Board and the
Argyll and Bute Education Authority; and it was also given generous
assistance by Rotary International.
Another area where Fablevision is deploying its skills, this time
commissioned by Strathclyde region, Edinburgh District Council, the
Educational Institute of Scotland, and Children in Need, is in the
opening up and exploration of the concerns of the Asian community in
Scotland.
With the help and advice of the Muslim and Pakistani Women's Welfare
Societies, rehearsals have just begun for a theatrical dramatisation of
the true story of a Scottish Asian family -- from the father's arrival
from New Delhi, full of hope and ambition, to the second generation of
mixed-race children and their struggle for cultural identity in Glasgow.
Present day Scottish life is also a crucial ingredient in the
forthcoming Eastwood Festival programme. Once again Fablevision is
closely involved, employing around a dozen different artists in schools
and community groups throughout Eastwood district.
The wide scale of Fablevision's projects mean that Gardiner's workload
is heavy. Apart from being closely involved in the writing and directing
of a large number of productions, she also spends a great deal of time
up and down the country, exploring local community needs, generating
dramatic ideas to explore these needs, and discussing the benefits of
sponsorship with local commercial interests and businesses.
Fablevision's success in such a wide range of projects has meant
recognition in Europe. Gardiner looks forward with enthusiasm to the
still-wider stage that collaboration with similar community theatre
companies there will afford.
But at the end of the day, it's her contribution to the dramatic
presentation of everyday problems which she finds most worthwhile and
exciting -- to feel that Fablevision's work really does make a
difference to people's outlook and lives in the family and the
community; and all the more satisfactory that the company provides such
excellent value for money as well.

THE Offshore Supplies Office has tapped itself into Glasgow's Tay
House in a rental deal which further depletes the city's dwindling
reservoir of good quality space.
The government agency has leased the 20,000sqft 6th floor on a 20-year
lease at an initial rental of #263,000 per annum. The Criminal Injuries
Compensation Board took 50,000sqft last year, which means that the
controversial Charing Cross building is now 44% occupied and is the only
building left in the city which can offer floorplates for immediate
occupation of between 20,000sqft and 30,000sqft.
The building, made famous by its ''bridge to nowhere'' over the M8,
has some 90,000sqft remaining on four levels.
According to Robert Young, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's agency partner,
several other potential occupiers declared their interest in the
building during the past few months. ''We are now looking at the
possibility of leasing the remaining space in the building during the
course of the next six months or so and this will be done on a
first-come, first-served basis,'' he said.
Asked whether the shortage of quality accommodation in the city centre
would trigger rent increases, Young gave a guarded response and hinted
that long-term commitment from tenants could be as important as the
rental achieved.
''I don't think the imminent supply shortage for buildings of this
quality will be the only factor to influence the rental expectations of
Tay House's owners,'' he said. ''The emphasis will be on securing
further good-quality tenants on long-term leases.''
Property Holdings Scotland, on behalf of Offshore Supplies Office,
were advised throughout the negotiations by Montagu Evans. The landlords
(Svenska Handelsbanken) were represented by joint agents Richard Ellis
and Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.

IN one of the West of Scotland's most significant business park moves
this year, some 25,600sqft of space in Greenock's enterprise zone has
been taken by Cigna Employee Benefits at a rental of #10 per sq ft per
annum.
US financial services group Cigna has relocated its entire employee
benefits operation to Scott House, part of the Cartsburn Maritime
development. The building is to be renamed Cigna House and is
immediately adjacent to the company's existing waterfront premises at
Britannia House.
Cartsburn Maritime is a new development by Wilson (UK) Developments in
association with Renfrewshire Enterprise. The move consolidates Cigna's
position as one of Greenock's major employers.
Cigna was represented by Grimley in the transaction while Wilson (UK)
Developments and Renfrewshire Enterprise were represented by Richard

WITH only a few weeks left until the closing date for entries to the
1995 Renfrewshire Business Awards, one company looking to add to its
already well-stocked trophy cabinet is Peak Scientific, an industrial
air compressor distributor based in Paisley on a trading estate off the
M8.
In only two years its 30-year-old managing director, Robin MacGeachy,
has turned the family business into the third largest distributor of
high-purity gas generators in the world.
When Robin MacGeachy was handed the reins of the company by his father
he foresaw an explosion of activity within the field of laboratory
gases, and steered Peak Scientific into pole position to take advantage
of the ensuing scramble to have gases supplied in generator form rather
than from cylinders.
He explains: ''We realised that the market could become large and to
that end we embarked on a mission to appoint distributors of our product
throughout the world. The response was amazing and we were in the
fortunate position of having to decide which distributor to appoint from
11 companies in Taiwan, three in India, five in Korea and many more in
Europe.
''It was vital to ensure distributors of our product were good quality
companies and we did a lot of groundwork with them before taking them on
board. To date we have appointed 62 distributors world-wide.''
The company's balance sheet reflects the vast expansion in its
business. During the two-year period with MacGeachy at the helm, Peak
Scientific increased its turnover from #150,000 to the present #2m per
annum. The projection for the millennium is that the Paisley company
will continue this growth.
Peak Scientific has already enjoyed considerable success in a number
of business competitions, including runner-up in the Scottish Marketing
Awards and has indicated its desire to enter two categories in the
up-and-coming Renfrewshire Business Awards on May 25 in Paisley.
The local enterprise company has a close relationship with Peak
Scientific and is currently seconding a business development executive
to provide management support. Renfrewshire Enterprise has also
engineered the placement of four graduates within the company, three of
whom have gone on to become full-time members of staff.
However, the next three months will record a period of even greater
change when Peak Scientific begins production of its own hydrogen
generators.
Robin MacGeachy adds: ''For some time we have been working towards
establishing a manufacturing base at Paisley. We see this as a logical
development of the distribution side of our business and will allow us
to provide a better quality product, cheaper than that of our
competitors, to our customers.''
The move into manufacturing will see the 20-strong workforce increase
by four initially, and also herald a move to a bigger facility.
For Robin MacGeachy, the man driving the company through the
transition, it'll be a case of keeping his passport at the ready. Last
year he spent around five months out of the country. This year's diary
looks pretty hectic as well.

ONE Renfrewshire precision engineering company has been quietly
blazing a very profitable trail for years. And its recent investment in
a #200,000 lathe, a sophisticated Japanese piece of state-of-the-art
equipment and its largest single investment, will ensure that the
family-run Tercet group of companies remains at the forefront of its
specialised field for some time to come.
Tercet Scotland Limited is a market-led specialist manufacturer of
repetition components for the computer and office automation industries.
And the company, whose main production plant is located in Paisley, has
been bucking the national trend of engineering decline so successfully
that, over the last 10 years, its turnover has risen by 20% per annum.
Two years ago the company saw a total production of #4.3m of its
specialised components.
These components are required by all the big multi-national
manufacturers of computers, photocopiers, printers, bank cash machines,
and other similar machines: an expanding market which managing director,
Alex Burns, has assiduously and determinedly opened up and exploited.
Maintaining the impressive record of continuous growth over the years
has meant, first of all, being constantly alert in the search for and
indentification of potential customers and then, secondly, responding
positively to them.
The company has had to be ready to take risks by backing its
assessment of the market and investing. Burns has done this by investing
10% of his turnover every year, even when the recession caused his
accountants to encourage caution.
His perseverence has been vindicated. By constantly upgrading his
machinery he has been able to maintain a competitive and technological
edge over other specialised component suppliers which has been
invaluable.
This year Tercet has invested over #400,000 in new machinery; and this
year the company also took delivery of its 23rd Star machine over 10
years.
This leading-edge plant and technological equipment utilises
multi-function CNC sliding-head lathes and is capable of completely
machining components in a single operation. The company's other
specialist capabilities include the machining of precision components on
multi-pallet CNC machining centres and precision sheet metal
manufacturing.
Because the machinery is being used 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
after three or four years Tercet is ready to replace and upgrade. The
result is an ever-rising level of capital efficiency as well as of
quality in its production of slender shafts for paper movement.
Both factors, says Burns, are absolutely crucial when the company is
competing in a world market. For there is great competition from the Far
East as well as from within Europe. In consequence, Tercet's employment
of advances in technology to competitive advantage, in terms of both the
quality and price of its products, is as vital as its effective response
to customer needs.
About 15% of Tercet's output goes directly overseas. But because the
remaining 85% goes to large exporting companies such as AT&amp;T, OKI,
Ricoh, Hewlett Packard, IBM, and Polaroid, over 90% of Tercet's
production is ultimately exported. And of their total output, some 50%
is now attributable to sub-assembly work for these companies .
Tercet has a workforce of 95. Eightyfive of these operate in the
30,000 square foot Paisley production plant, while 10 are employed in
the metal finishing plant in Kilwinning. This latter was established six
years ago in order to eliminate the need to sub-contract the
electroplating finishing process, thus increasing efficiency as well as
speed of response to urgent customer requests.
It was at roughly the same time that the company also refurbished its
Paisley factory. It had originally be founded by Burns' father in 1966
as a toolmaking engineering business. And just as today, the company has
always been ready to move forwards. Its gradual evolution from machine
tool-making to precision production engineering began in the seventies:
as the market for heavy capital equipment declined, Tercet exploited the
emerging precision product opportunities.
Maintaining forward momentum remains Burns' chief pre-occupation. As
managing director he aims to leave a skilled home team to take
day-to-day decisions, while he keeps a constant overview of every aspect
of the business and its world-wide connections.

By CHRISTOPHER SIMS
FORTE'S trading experience is what you would expect -- the luxury
London hotels are doing well as the business traveller has come back
with a bang while the hotels more orientated towards the leisure market
remain flat.
But margins benefit quickly from an upturn in business occupancy rates
and Forte's profits responded accordingly, rising 65% to #127m excluding
exceptionals in the year to January. This was in line with market
expectations and the shares eased 5p to 235p.
Profits are still well behind the level achieved in 1992-93, let alone
1990, so it not surprising that dividends are pegged at 7.5p after a
final of 4.75p. Even this payout is only covered 1.3 times.
Forte reassures shareholders that it will pursue a ''progressive''
dividend policy when it can.
But with the acquisition of Meridien, Forte is more confident these
days and chairman Sir Rocco Forte said the results demonstrated that the
group was able to improve its trading performance in spite of prevailing
market conditions.
In the UK conditions outside London were certainly not exciting,
though Sir Rocco professed himself quite satisfied with the performance
of the Scottish hotels overall. The Edinburgh hotels such as the
Posthouse and Balmoral had done well but Sir Rocco said the Glasgow
properties were affected by a general over-capacity in the city,
reflecting new openings in recent years. This will take time to be
absorbed and meanwhile room rates are under pressure.
The opposite is the case in London, where Forte's 20 hotels (not
counting its interest in the Savoy group) achieved a 14% rise in sales
to #232m, while profits jumped 30% to #69m. Rising room rates took over
from volume growth in the second half as the main driver, pushing up
margins.
For the UK as a whole profits were 20% up at #148m, 85% of the group
total. Across the group, occupancy increased six percentage points and
room rates rose 2%.
Meridien was included only briefly but it will make a significant
contribution this year. It increased Forte's international spread to 100
hotels and its integration is apparently going well, with sales and
marketing the priority area. The Meridien name will gradually supplant
the Forte Grand brand for the group's top hotels, though full
integration will clearly take time.
Significant cost savings will result from eliminating head office
structures and lower overheads generally.
The UK hotels outside London are more dependent on the leisure market
which was depressed. Nevertheless profits were still 16% ahead at #81m,
on the back of a good showing from the budget chains, Posthouse and
Travelodge. The Grand and Crest units were mixed, according to location.
Forte is now considering how best to use the properties. The three-star
Posthouse chain benefited from refurbishment and was the best performing
brand. The Glasgow Posthouse was the best performer of the lot and the
new Traders restaurant is proving very popular with the city's diners.
Travelodge is being rapidly expanded and new openings and an
acquisition boosted capacity by 30%, with 120 sites now in operation.
Occupancies remain high.
Forte's restaurant chains raised profits by 22% to #82m, with margins
widening from 10.8% to 12.5%. Little Chef saw a higher average spend as
menus were improved. The development programme was resumed with the
opening of 25 new units and others were refurbished. The group includes
Welcome Break and Relais motorway service areas in France with which
motorised English holidaymakers will be familiar. It is trading well
under Forte's management though in a difficult market.
With economic recovery continuing apace in the UK and US, and Europe
also picking up, Forte's hotels towards the top end of the market should
continue to do well this year, though the leisure market will depend on
how consumer spending develops.
Generally, Forte is well positioned to benefit from the continuation
of the business cycle, though the shares are discounting at least part
of this.
Sir Rocco Forte . . . the results demonstrated that the group was able
to improve its trading performance in spite of prevailing market
conditions

A SOLID set of results from textile group S Jerome underpins a company
set on both organic and acquisitive growth.
There was a swing round from losses last year of #335,000 to a
#725,000 surplus with the 1993 deficit relating to the #750,000 terminal
costs of the unhappy diversification into electronic surveillance.
The on-going textile operations showed a 75% improvement because of a
6% rise in turnover to #26.9m and good performances in some individual
activities. These included worsted weaving which is experiencing high
demand at present for colour-woven fancies which has encouraged chairman
Alan Jerome to invest #600,000 in new equipment to boost capacity by an
eighth.
Likewise woollen yarn saw demand for tweed from Gardiners of Selkirk
reach record levels and a #575,000 machine replacement programme is
under way to improve product quality. Other activities were generally on
an upward trend.
Exports now account for 22% of sales with Chinese requirements for
wool products better than expected -- Jerome sells into over 50
countries with its competitive position helped partly by the weakness of
sterling but more so its cloth quality. That is helped in the UK by 20%
of output eventually finding its way to Marks &amp; Spencer.
It has been trawling the industry for acquisitions but nothing
suitable has yet been netted -- the family holding of 40% would be
willingly diluted if need be. There is excess capacity in the textile
industry which does need to be eliminated and Jerome should be able to
play a constructive part.
Profits should reach about #1m this year which would leave the shares
at 68p, up 4p, trading at just eight times probable earnings -- which
does seem cheap. Dividend restoration continues with a 1p final for a
1.5p total and a 2.75% yield.

SMITHS Industries preserved a strong cash position through the
recession in order to make acquisitions and these are now helping to
push profits higher.
In the six months to January profits advanced by 26% to #58m. As all
the acquisitions were for cash, this increase came straight through to
earnings per share. The interim dividend goes up by a tenth to 5.05p.
The trend is expected to continue in the second half and further
acquisitions are planned. Cash flow is strong and borrowings modest at
#14.5m, so the group has plenty of ammunition. Smiths shares gined 13p
to 484p as the market scaled up full-year earning forecasts which would
leave them selling at about 14 times earnings.
Purchases contributed half the first-half profits growth, with medical
systems the front-runner. Its trading profits jumped 40% to #26.1m, with
the Deltec purchase making a big contribution. Even though Smiths is
categorised as an aerospace company, the medical division is easily the
bigger earner.
It makes engineered products, many disposable, for medical use, in the
UK and US. Each business is a brand leader in its specialist niche and
so margins are high. Exports were strong from the UK and now with the
weakness of the dollar US exports have great potential.
''The UK is a superb base to export from at the moment,'' observed
group chairman and chief executive Roger Hurn. There is currently a
roaring trade to Japan.
Aerospace is showing signs of a recovery in its markets as airlines at
last start thinking about ordering again. US military sales were strong.
Smiths makes various systems and cockpit instruments such as electrical
power management systems and fuel gauges. Nevertheless, a further 250
jobs went and a smaller number will go this year. Profits edged ahead 8%
to #16.3m.
The industrial division is composed of niche businesses mainly
comprising tubing for air conditioning, Vent-Axia fans and various
engineering companies, including one making Smiths' only consumer
product, electronic timers. The division's profits were 38% higher at
#16.1m.

RECOVERY in the UK, allied to the continuing strength of the
construction industry in Germany as well as recovery in some other
European countries, boosted profits of building products group RMC, the
world's biggest producer of concrete, by almost 60% last year from
#177.8m to #283.3m before tax. Turnover rose 18.5% to #4156.2m.
Earnings per share accelerated 74.1% to 68.6p, influenced by a higher
rate of recovery in profits after taxation in those areas where the
group owns a high percentage of the operations.
The dividend total is up 9.5% to 23p with payment of a 16p final.
RMC's aim is to achieve sustainable dividend cover of around three times
in both the good and bad times.
Also contributing to the profit advance was a drop in net interest
charges from #39.9m to #33.7m, reflecting strong cash flow up from
#325.6m to #481.9m. Net borrowing fell from #452.8m to #344.1m with
gearing down to 27% from 41%.
RMC does not expect the same level of profits growth in the current
year which is scarcely surprising. But it says that although the
recovery in the UK is showing signs of levelling out, and the growth in
Germany and the US will probably be at a somewhat lower level than was
the case in 1994, it anticipates further improvement in overall
performance in the current year.
Last year, trading conditions in the UK operations continued to show
an improvement in the housing, commercial and industrial sectors and
profits more than doubles ahead of interest and tax from #34m to #71.6m.
Germany, where RMC has a dominating share of the ready-mixed market,
continued to power ahead, lifting profits from #145.8m to #172.9m.
The shares dipped 22p to 1024p, partly on profit-taking after their
rising trend. At this level the company selling at around 15 times
historic earnings and yield around 3%.

ALEXANDRA Workwear cheered the City for the first time for quite a
period yesterday with the combination of results for the year to
end-January being not as bad as feared, a 7% rise in the dividend total
and a moderately optimistic statement. The shares rose 7p to 124p where
they yield 6% on the 6p dividend.
The rate of turnover increased as the year progressed to show an
overall rise of 5.6% at #61.8m. However, while there was margin pressure
in the second half from rising raw material costs, these are now being
recovered from customers. These have increased both in number and by
activity.
Pre-tax profits fell from #4.6m to #4.3m, although the earlier year
benefited from #200,000 of regional development grants.
The efficiency of the Scottish factory improved after problems in the
first six months associated with training 50 new machinists.
Retailing was better generally despite closure of three shops.

THE battle for control of AAH has hotted up with Gehe, Europe's
biggest drugs wholesaler, making an increased final offer for the group
which was promptly rejected.
Gehe raised its offer to 445p a share from its original offer of 420p.
A spokesman for AAH said that the company remained convinced that the
bid was still inadequate and urged shareholders to reject.

FIGURES released this week by KPMG show that for some companies in
Scotland, particularly many smaller ones, the hard years of recession
continue to take their toll.
In the first quarter of this year 32 companies called in receivers, an
increase of more than 50 per cent on the previous three months, bringing
the quarterly figure up to the levels which were last experienced back
in 1993 when 31 companies failed during the same period.
The increase is relatively sudden and quite marked, and is set against
an annual trend which, for Scotland looked set on a downward spiral --
from a high in 1992 of 202, down to 120 in 1993 and just 83 last year.
So is there cause for concern? Some figures quoted recently, in fact,
paint an even blacker picture than that drawn by KPMG's statistics but
according to Blair Nimmo, some of these larger estimates can be called
into question.
''Other statistics tend to be confused by the inclusion of personal
bankruptcies and a failure to appreciate the differences between English
and Scottish insolvency legislation,'' he said.
''It is fair to record receiverships and perhaps liquidations but a
considerable proportion of the bankruptcy figures are still individuals
and therefore not business failures.''
''I believe that this sudden upturn may well be simply a one-off as
all the trends, in Scotland and the rest of the UK, have been steadily
falling and this is perhaps too small a sample on which to start judging
the future.''
But are there any common grounds within these latest figures that
could spell out a warning to other companies?
Most of the victims are in the lower end of the smaller company
spectrum turning over #500,000 to #3m and the geography of Scottish
failures is quite evenly spread -- the latest 32 in the first quarter
containing 16 from the West of Scotland and 16 from the rest of
Scotland.
From such a small sample it is difficult to identify particular
sectors.
As there is no geographic trend to failure, so the reasons behind the
failures very enormously but some of the messages still coming through
are inadequate management skills, inability or unwillingness to
regularly reassess and if necessary change the business strategy, poor
management information systems and under capitalisation.
''To be fair however, most markets are extremely competitive and
companies are finding it very difficult to pass on price increases and
therefore improve or maintain margins,'' continued Mr Nimmo.
A lot of the credit for the fall in receivership trends over the last
four years has to go to the often-criticised Scottish lending community.
It is now prepared to add considerable support to clients, often in very
difficult situations.
The brighter side to the market however is that while some at the
smaller end of the company range may be struggling, it is becoming more
and more obvious that there is a ''middle ground'' who have managed
themselves through recession, have come out leaner and better run and
are now very acquisitive.
''In recent cases where we have been appointed and there is a good
core business to be saved by receivership, (which after all can actually
be the ultimate reconstruction tool!) we have been surprised by the very
high levels of interest,'' said Mr Nimmo.
''Within the last few weeks we've helped three businesses, all in very
different industry sectors and at the end of the day there have been six
or seven serious bids for each of them. That's actually something that
we as a profession haven't seen for some time.
''It's also something backed up strongly by our experience of property
which we are dealing with as a consequence of receivership.
''It is beginning to move, and very quickly too. We have had some
commercial properties on our books since the early nineties and now
suddenly all types and in all locations are being snapped up by
developers and companies looking to expand their interests.''
This is a very encouraging sign for, while the domestic property
market is still stagnant, a growth in commercial property interest shows
that the business community have perhaps decided to start investing
again.
So while the message from a sudden increase in failures could be seen
as a negative one, the underlying feeling is that there are the first
signs of a resurgence among some of the stronger companies and it
remains to be seen how this develops over the next three months.

Harry Conroy reports on moves to transform a former factory in
Bridgeton into a production base for the increasing number of films made
in Glasgow
The accent is off putting. It drifts between Glasgow and some other
faint dialect which, although distinctive, is difficult to place. You
are not sure if you are talking to a Glaswegian who has been away for a
while and returned home, or someone who is in the midst of losing their
home tongue.
It turns out to be the latter, Len Crooks, producer of The Near Room,
originated from Belfast but has been around Glasgow for the past 20
years.
The origins may be Northern Ireland but Len's commitment to developing
his adopted city as a major film centre cannot be questioned. And he is
entitled to be satisfied with the progress he has made so far.
The Near Room is likely to hit our screens next spring, and Len is
quietly confident of its success.
It has taken him eight years to get to this point. He formed a film
development and production company in 1987 named Inverclyde Productions.
At his first attempt British Screen Finance gave #30,000 towards
developing the script of a proposed film to be called Shipbuilding.
''It was a post-Falkland War film drama, and was a big education for
us,'' explains Len. ''We put it all together then discovered the cruel
reality of the red light. We had developed the script, and everything
else up to the production stage, then discovered we could not put the
final finance package together.''
He adds wryly: ''The simple fact is a lot of people get development
finance but that does not mean a film will be made.''
The ''red light'' for Shipbuilding came in 1990 after three years of
hard work. Len spent six months licking his wounds before joining forces
with film screen writer Robert Murphy to came up with the idea of The
Near Room, an urban thriller set in Glasgow.
In 1991 the Scottish Film Production Fund agreed to finance the
development of the script by putting up #10,000.
A year later in 1992, British Screen Finance chipped in #5000 to allow
the script to be developed to the second draft stage, and Len Crooks was
then able to start trying to put together the elements necessary to
attract finance for the film.
David Hayman, who had such productions as Silent Screen which had won
awards and the TV success Black and Blue, agreed to direct the film.
Inverclyde Productions now had in place the three components required
to attract financial backing -- producer, script writer, and director.
''David Hayman has experience and respect within the industry,'' says
Len ''but there was no financial base we could go to in Scotland to seek
funds. In 1993 the financial institutions were not disposed to support
an industry which was seen as people making art.''
At this point in the interview Len digressed slightly to point out
that the film industry is the US's second largest export earner, and
remarked that we had the choice of being mere recipients of US films or
we could decide to create our own industry.
At this crucial period in the development of The Near Room, says the
film producer, they were blessed by the existence of three ''very
creative personages'' in Glasgow's public institutions.
He named the trio as Kevin Kane of the GDA, Steve Inch of Glasgow City
Council and Robert Paton of Strathclyde Regional Council.
''They could see the potential of providing the seed finance for an
industry which was labour intensive, and had high export potential.''
The three public bodies took soundings within the film industry and
eventually the Glasgow Film Fund was created with back-up finance from
the European Regional Development Fund.
''Suddenly,'' says Len, ''we had a fund that could finance films in
this part of the world''.
The newly-created fund's first financial commitment was not to The
Near Room but to Shallow Grave, which was recently released and has
already pulled in around #5m in box office receipts in the UK and around
#2m in the US.
The Glasgow Film Fund, however, agreed to invest #50,000 in The Near
Room. This proved to be enough support to allow Crooks and his
colleagues to approach others for further finance.
The fund then put additional finance into the package at the end of
last year which allowed the film to move into production.
Actor Adrian Dunbar had agreed to take the lead role during 1994, and
this helped to convince potential investors that they should participate
in the financing package.
At the start of this year The Near Room moved into full production
with a cast of 37 and a crew of 70 working out of the former Anderson
Strathclyde factory in Broad Street, Bridgeton.
''The space in Broad Street,'' says Len, ''could become a production
base for films made in Glasgow. Easterhouse, another film being made in
the city has now moved into the premises as we have completed filming.''
He believes that if the proper steps are taken Glasgow could be
established as a permanent film production base.
''We don't want what is now happening to be just a passing fashion.
''I believe the local authority should appoint a film officer just as
most of the big cities in America have,'' he explains, ''such an officer
would smooth the way for film companies coming to the city. Glasgow has
as much right to make films as London, Paris, New York, or Berlin.''
He stresses that it is a myth that the elements are unfriendly towards
film making in Scotland. ''We did not lose a day's shooting because of
the weather.''
The Near Room, says Len, will have a universal appeal but will portray
Glasgow humour and irony. And there was a touch of irony in that this
statement was delivered with just a slight touch of a Belfast accent,
but came from a man obviously at home in Glasgow.

EVERY season there is at least one must-have item for every woman's
wardrobe and this time around it is the short, sassy raincoat.
In keeping with the general trend, the springtime raincoat is not only
short and cut for a shapely figure, it is also wildly flirty in the
current vogue hues of baby pink and blue.
Aside from these essential shades, the keynote to look for is a
sixties slant on the styling with A-line skirt panels. The flirty
raincoat will also have a nipped-in waist but you can create your own
with the season's bright slim belts, providing the perfect outer
complement to this spring's curvaceous clothes. Labels which will cope
with raindrops without being a wash-out on the chic stakes range from
Gil Bret to Paul Costelloe and even Burberry.
Gil Bret offers long and short raincoats, but it is the short versions
which really swing, with slightly flared shapes which a girl can whisk
round whatever the weather. Burberry -- the home of the traditional
grown-up raincoat -- is offering the definitive little pink number with
all the right styling notes for 1995.
Raincoats with a silky sheen will be the scene-stealers, but there are
also some fetching light wool versions for days when there is more wind
chill than water about.

LEGS are stepping out this summer in either the most violent of
colours or the sheerest vanilla shades, as the hosiery industry vies to
cover all the angles for a season combining high glamour with pastel or
acid tones.
Either approach will highlight legs in a dramatically sexy way, unseen
in recent years, as eyes were drawn to hemlines and not calves by the up
and down trends.
Skirts are varying a few inches from the new sharp-look tight on the
knee, through to the A-line pelmet swingers which will go out flirting
again this summer, but the focus in each case will be on a shapely pair
of pins to accentuate the season's emphasis on womanly curves.
Hue, one of the brightest and freshest hosiery labels around, will
have a good core range of colours and a fair spread of fashion tones
this spring. Over and above those, it is also producing a range of
brights which have to be seen to be believed but offer fantastic
possibilities for head-to-toe dressing in acid pastels. Colours in this
palette include saffron, tangerine, raspberry, kiwi, turquoise, vivid
pink and African violet.
Apart from this high voltage colour, the company is also offering
straightforward glam with its new range of lustre opaque tights, which
should successfully take winter-pale legs into the light.
Over-the-knees which were popular throughout winter, will not
disappear with the onset of milder weather, but there will be a
departure from black. Trading on the standard acceptance of the
previously wayward fishnet, Hue is delving into crochet to deliver a new
texture.
Sheer comfort is available from Aristoc which again has its Legtoners
range providing support for active legs, but sheer glamour is not far
away in a wide number of its ranges in various deniers.
The sheer see-through appeal which is complemented with natural
colours provides women, who have yet to feel the sun or at least the
effects of a sunbed on their legs, with the perfect antidote to fashion
mag's push for the bare leg unadorned; a sight which is OK on the beach
or the beach bar but not quite so attractive on the cold streets of
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee or Aberdeen.

PINK power is part and parcel of the return to girly glamour. Among
the splashes of colour to be draped over curves this spring and summer,
pink will be the one to catch the eye.
It is a marriage made in a white trash heaven straight out of the
fifties and the awakening of sexuality among white picket fences. It is
the promise of pouting adolescence -- a Rebel Without A Cause babe
running with a teenage crowd.
As a colour, you can't get more light-hearted than pink . . . the one
to make the boys wink. It provides an instant lift to run-of-the-mill
suits, dresses or shirts. A garment can be straightforward or even
classic in its tailoring, but put it in pink and it will be fetching in
a provocatively, non-politically correct manner.
Pink of course -- particularly of the baby hue -- is in the pigment
vanguard of the backlash against PC. Dressing grown women in the colour
long discarded for infants is a sign of the reverse of the times or
perhaps an indication that women have reached a point where they can
play with their sexual standing.
We know this kind of pink is Doris Day cast as Pretty Woman, which in
turn is dressed up as a kitchen-sink drama but if you have a strong
persona, good career and your own healthy bank blance; well that is
someone else's hang up.
Nor is unripened pink the only hue in town. The resurgence of pink is
spread across the shade spectrum from demure rose tea to pastel pink
with a few in between for good measure. Spiced rose shades are not only
perfect for afternoon tea, but they are quietly and coolly feminine.
They spell calm in the middle of a crisis and do not compromise a
woman's professional standing while their effervescent cousins radiate
fun living and nights falling off the tiles.
The whole gamut is available in suits, shirts, dresses, bags, suits
and even shoes this summer for females who want the world to understand
in no uncertain terms that they are women.

ONCE upon a time it seemed as if whole wardrobes of clothes were
junked with the arrival of the new season and its connected fads, which
always lay in direct contrast to what had gone before.
The big design houses have now realised that their products are not
cheap and therefore cannot merely be discarded after a few wearings but
must evolve to fit in with new lines coming through year after year.
One year's directions are never entirely overturned by a new move in
the fashion world but remain acceptable if subtly updated and cleverly
altered. As a result the current sexy and sassy look may be the keynote
of the season, but last year's loose ethnicity is hanging out in 1995
and will provide wholesome staple wear for another few years.
It will just move on a pace with a little adjustment here and there
but without straying too far from the established highway. This year's
prints have mellowed and colours are not quite so visually pungent --
new additions can therefore be mixed and matched easily with old
favourites from '94 which may have lost their sharp edge. Colour tones
for easy living in summer '95 are washed-out spices, saffron, burnt
orange, mustard, rosewood and denim blues which appear to have tussled a
time or two with the suds.
Colours in fact, which tend to look so bleached out that they almost
fade away altogether in many instances to the weakest of watercolours
such as rose-tea and taupe. Florals have been resurrected but they line
up alongside African-influenced block prints which again are not so much
beating the drum for ethnicity as sending out billowing smoke signals.
As a radical alternative to sharp glam dressing, restrictions have
slipped away almost entirely this time around with the emphasis on big,
loose-flowing pants and long, big shifts of shirts in the lightest of
linens and cottons, playing up femininity rather than sexuality.
Skirts billow, crinkled or pleated with the lightest of irons, while
trousers just billow and colours take their cues from the music of the
blues.
Last year Mondi had some of the brightest ethnic-inspired items around
and the label has kept in line with the spirit of this multi-lingual
evolution by softening its colours and tailoring. Inspiration comes from
Madagascar and the Far East, but again there is no slavish attention to
authenticity, only easy-going outlines in which to drift.
The long and the short of it is investigated by PTA, who this season,
plays with the colours of Morocco; short and long layers in floaty
fabrics to recreating the slow-cooking heat of the desert sand. Long
spice-coloured jackets are teamed with short tops and crinkled floral
print voile skirts -- a lazy take on co-ordination, which side-steps the
season's call for strict top-to-toe dressing.
Laurel, which has become a powerhouse of seasonal staples over the
past couple of years, dips into a stress-free life with its Java range
redolent of the old colonial days when a girl could call on the servants
to deliver a glass of lemonade. Active women will enjoy the safari-style
jackets which are teamed with wide-flowing pants but there are also
sarongs for lazy days, in materials ranging from silk to cotton, Irish
linen and crepe de Chine, all in ivory, coconut, bamboo and sisal
shades.
Another take this is offered by the Louis Feraud Set, younger sister
of the widely stocked Louis Feraud label. Its Sandrift Naturals range
goes for sun-bleached colours but also offsets them with checks and
casual prints on both sarong skirts and bermuda shorts. These can be
toughened up for work by adding a natty little short-sleeved jacket.
KS -- or to give it its full title, the Klaus Stielmann Selection --
uses cotton and linen jackets to give a sense of quiet tranquility over
flowing trousers and long skirts. Natural fibres such as linens and
silks feature strongly in the collection but there are also clever
interwoven combinations to provide the authenticity of the natural with
the hard-wearing properties of the man-made.
A delicate transparency and fluidity of movement is a hallmark of this
summer's collection fom Betty Barclay. Ethnic prints are either subsumed
or celebrated -- according to the wearer's mood -- alongside easy-going
blocks of colour in silk, linen and cotton in a design mash that takes
threads of inspiration of India, Indonesia and the Orient.
Not widely stocked in Scotland, but certainly an emerging label to
look for is Miss Britt. Its range of easy-going clothes from crinkle
skirts to pyjama trousers, jeans and separates combines the loose with
the tailored for the ''go-anywhere'' style favoured by physical women
who also like to chill out.
For floaty dresses, look out for Nougat. Light, easy going carefree
clothes are the hallmark of the Nougat collection for spring with
garments which are youthfully effervescent and untroubled.

THE Leckies have been around Crieff Hydro ever since it was
established as the Strathearn Hydropathic Establishment in 1868.
Dr. Henry Meickle who was responsible for the construction of the
hotel was the great-granduncle of John Leckie, the present managing
director.
John Leckie was appointed manager of Crieff Hydro following the death
of his father, Gordon, in 1960, and since his elevation to managing
director his son, Stephen, has become general manager.
''I have a diploma in agriculture, and the hotel at that time had a
farm which I ran,'' smiles John Leckie, adding ''but Stephen is actually
qualified in hotel management''.
The Leckies are steeped in the tradition of Crieff Hydro where,
although time does not quite stand still, it moves very slowly.
The Hydro was a temperance establishment for the first 112 years of
its history, after which it only had a table licence until five years
ago when it applied for and received a full liquor license.
''But we don't have a cocktail bar,'' stresses John Leckie.
Anticipating the next question he says: ''So many of our guests like
it that way.''
This fact is endorsed by the 80 per cent occupancy rate Crieff enjoys,
which in guest figures means that last year 112,000 customers stayed in
the grand Victorian building.
Among these guests were 1000 Church of Scotland ministers and workers,
who enjoy the luxury surroundings at a much reduced rate thanks to two
trusts who have a stake in the hotel.
''But the continuing tradition of Crieff Hydro, including an organ
which would not be out of place in any church, does not mean,'' says
Stephen Leckie forcibly, ''that the hotel is in any way old-fashioned''.
The management, (aka the Leckie family) have managed to retain a sense
of unchanging times while providing up-to-the-minute facilities.
At present a new #2.5m wing is being built adding further conference
facilities to the hotel which already caters for gatherings of up to 350
people.
Indoor facilities already provided include a 20-metre, indoor heated
swimming pool, fitness room, and sports hall. Outdoors you can enjoy a
nine-hole golf course, five tennis courts, an all-weather bowling green
and croquet lawn.
But the present generation of the Leckies are conscious of the family
tradition of their ''holiday resort''. Mrs Janet Leckie, who is the
hotel's housekeeper, says: ''We must comply with the requirements of the
1989 Children's Act because we supervise children for more than two
hours a day. We could have reduced the hours we offer to look after the
children but we didn't want to do that.''
To continue offering this facility, Crieff Hydro had to meet the Act's
requirements regarding trained staff, floor space, and toilet facilities
for the children.
Up to 100 children at peak school holiday times can attend the hotel's
Children Club including Fun Time between seven and 9pm.
Crieff Hydro has 250 mainly individual shareholders, and says John
Leckie. ''Our family are shareholders but it is a minority stake we have
in the business. No one has a controlling interest. Even if the trusts
got together they could not impose their will on the other
shareholders.''
The independence of the establishment, along with the Leckie family's
involvement, appears to be secure for many years to come as John Leckie
points out, ''any transfer of shares has to be approved by the
company''.

In this 16-page Herald fashion supplement, Hilda McLean looks at
what's going on this spring and summer.
SPRING 1995 is wide open for all shapes and ages of women, because we
have refused to be button-holed by the design houses into grasping at
each new fashion as it comes along. The result is that the marketplace
is putting increasing emphasis on creating long-term classics.
This is great news in terms of investment buying but the lack of
security of the part of buyers is also being reflected in a slowing
arena of choice. If women -- and that means 30 and fortysomethings and
not just the inherently young and adventurous -- don't grab some new
trends by the horns in the next few years, we could be left with a
marketplace which is all classics and nothing but classics.
Admittedly the idea of classics has been stretched from the
traditional blazer and some natty nautical pieces to include items such
as sarongs and linen trouser suits and floaty dresses, but there will
come a time when we want to gee up our wardrobes and go beyond good
taste, live a little and have some fun. And where will we be then.
One exciting direction which will take no prisoners this spring is the
re-emergence of sex on legs and glamour in all its provocative
tackiness. A hard look to wear and a hard look to carry off if taken to
its extremes, this new mood does offer up interesting possibilities
particularly for women who are sick of letting it all hang out and want
to get dressed up again.
This dabbling with sexuality stretches from daytime and pinks to make
the boys wink to night-time allure of the highest campest order, which
all reeks of the girls grabbing back femininity from those boys who have
been stealing our limelight in television adverts and films recently.
It will not be everywhere or for everyone and the biggest wave of glam
clothes will undoubtedly be in the High Street youth sector but its
knock-on effect will ripple out widely in suits which are tightly
waisted to the general re-acceptance of stiletto heels and the
knee-length tight skirt and the ever so short summer A-line.
Grunge has all but gone but clothes which do let the wearer hang out
will of course still be out in force and with the general evolution of
the market, which is currently being demanded by the consumers, will
make good buys for years to come for days when the mayhem of life is put
on the backburner.
But again, even in those days on the beach, glamour will be raising
its head. Swimwear this year is vying to be seen not only in its use of
bright colours but with intricate patterns which will certainly make one
costume stand out from another.
Another ripple will be felt in the workwear sector with a
reinforcement of the smart is good ethos in suits which will now be able
to go into the office, do lunch and emerge for a night on the tiles,
stylishly.

On Sunset Boulevard the starlets have gone for glamour.
A BARRAGE of sensuality will be evident on our streets this summer if
women take up the new vogue for glamour, which is being touted as the
way forward for the fashion industry. Glamour with a capital G --
reclaimed from the more unsavoury side of modelling -- was evident in
every top name collection in Paris and Milan.
It strode down the catwalks with feline precision and is now set to be
unleashed on the streets and cafe bars of the western world. Sharp and
tightly tailored on fulsome curves, this is continental glamour via
Hollywood -- glamour that walked off the streets of Rome barefoot and
then teetered along Sunset Boulevard in stilettoes.
Occasionally on an eventful evening, it will be acceptable to dabble
in the 1930s glamour of Jean Harlow in satin bias cut dresses, but the
mood really belongs to the sultry sirens of Italy who brought
Mediterranean passion to the screen in the fifties and sixties and let
the sexual heat build up through their hourglass figures. This is Gina
Lollobrigida, tiny-waisted and cantilevered bosoms, and Sophia Loren,
even larger cantilevered bosoms and child-bearing hips, who is proving
all over again that she can still turn it on with just the cool blink of
an eye in Robert Altman's Pret-a-Porter.
More than a few design houses have missed the boat or may have just
decided to forego this trip, but there are others who have revelled in
the challenge of a journey over rollercoaster curves. Across the board,
however, there is the feeling of a return from the brink of grunge and
sloppy dressing to fifties standards and pristine skirts and blouses; an
uptight sexy sassiness from the days when passions were kept in check
but strained against tight tailoring rather than let it all hang loose
and seem abundantly available.
The hallmarks of this look are pencil skirts tight on the knee, small
waists adorned by smaller belts and sharp rocket-style breasts poised
for destruction of the male of the species. Too sexual and too
definitive of form to be classic, these styles challenge females to
dress up and ''stand up'' as being all-woman. The generally natural
inclination of men to look has been ever so slightly subverted by
political correctness, but we admit it can be tolerated if practised
with moderation boys.
Moderation may of course be difficult with the truly white trash
element of this trend which completely forsakes any demurity of the
fifties knee-length skirts. The shortest of short A-line pelmets stop at
the top of the thighs and are teamed with too tight T-shirts, which
allows thin girls the chance to have their curves exaggerated as much
they can against material restraints.
Colours at the sharp end this season are particularly trashy with
pastels that overdosed on acid leading the way with sky blue, fuchsia
pinks and even lime greens. Thankfully the look is also available in
watered-down varieties of pastels enlivened with a touch of the babygro
hues -- yellow, pink and blue.
Names delivering this slice of sartorial sensuality include Louis
Feraud, which as a label is certainly countenancing white trash but is
turning up the heat with undulating outlines and unadulterated glamour,
and Philosophy which does not hold back from being mad, bad and
dangerous to know with a sexual voltage charged by taking curves better
than any stunt driver on winding mountain paths.
Separates can do the trick, but when it comes to glamour you can't
beat a dress and there are plenty little curvy numbers around to choose
from. The simplest and best are shift dresses which have been brought
upbeat with baby doll styling to flounce out in gossamer and chiffon
with A-line hems. Labels which travel in this sphere of flirtiness range
from Naf Naf to Paul Costelloe, recalling the danger of Lolita.
Within all this there is the obvious word of warning of playing with
fire. A return to old-style sex and glamour may call for further
re-education of the boys to accept women as people whatever they are
wearing and even more seriously for women to go at the tummy trimmers
with a vengeance. After all in the fifties, fabulous figures which owed
little to designers' penchant for boy-like lanky shapes were relatively
thick on the ground. Since then the statistics reveal we have all got
bigger round the bust, which is good news for those contemplating this
look. . . and bigger round the waist, which isn't, with few of us now
natural possessors of the kind of hourglass that held sway in the
fifties.

Who wants to look like an air stewardess? Not the working woman with
smart money.
ORDINARY office wear stands a half-decent chance of looking reasonably
in tune with the season as the new sharper tailored silhouette becomes
the vogue for spring and summer.
Unlike the past few seasons, where grunge has dominated and workwear
has fallen behind in the style stakes with its demand for neatness, the
new look will ''do nicely Miss Jones'' for the office. Suddenly before
our eyes, it will be stylistically de rigueur to wear little feminine
suits with skirts on the knee and jackets pinched at the waist. Even
natty little shirts get a look in.
Where others grunged, smart money invested in loose baggy suits --
particularly of the trouser variety -- in which to see through the
unpredictability of the Scottish summer weather and office political
life.
Well-crafted loose suits became a working woman's shorthand for
capable and stylish in one package. Anyone with any sense, and that does
include a few gracious design houses, such as the Grace Collection, will
of course realise the message still stands.
Shape is all important, with womanly curves accentuated for the
season. The hint of an outline can simmer successfully with a toning
striped shirt or matching waistcoast, taking the sting out of the wasped
waist. If following these directions, the trick will be not to look like
an air stewardess.
Ouiset openly admits that its new season slim pencil skirts look a
treat when topped by their air hostess styled pique shirts and
coordinating jackets, but they also invite their customers to flirt with
more seductive possibilities by teaming these tight skirts with a
sweater or cardigan clinched in at the waist -- take off your jacket as
you leave work behind and become a fun-loving sweater girl.
Pre-ordained as it sounds, the natty little feminine suit can and does
have infinite variety within its tailored form. At one time a douce and
demure house, the Windsmoor Group has put a bit of zip into its designs
in recent years and the result is a collection which zings along with
something for everyone from 25 to 75.
Elsewhere trouser suits are riding high, particularily in linen. The
definitive '95 look is the straight tailored suit, but many houses are
still hanging loose for the woman who commands her own personal space.
Teamed with a matching waistcoat, as per various design houses such as
Planet, trouser suits are talking about a classic for all time -- or for
the next few years at least, which represents an investment of tidy
proportions.
When talking about suits, extras are important. The linen trouser suit
can be worn with a waistcoat alone, but generally speaking for work
purposes most of us will require a shirt. Tight-in shirts are the trade
line, but there are so many good big shirts out there this spring that
it would be unwise to dismiss them.
Where shirts won't go into waistbands that are just too tightly
waisted, bodies are here to save the day. Again colours which work are
washed-out reflections of outerwear or neutrals such as white and cream,
but olive will also do a turn, adding a more sultry note to sensible
suits everywhere.

This year's hot beach items are bold, bright and bubbling with new
ideas.
TO say that popular beaches are going to be busy this summer is
probably stating the obvious, but they are going to be buzzing, not just
in terms of bronzing bodies, but in sartorial terms.
The hot news on swimwear is that it is going to be jazzier than ever
before, not just brought to sizzling point with last year's tropical
colours but boiling over with wild and vibrant patterns.
Bolder than last year, the spread of patterns available takes its lead
from no particular direction. There are florals, Regency stripes,
geometrics and even Egyptian-style hieroglyphics.
The reason for this change in direction, as one prominent Scottish
retailer noted, is that people are realising it does not make sartorial
sense to wear dull, dowdy costumes on hot beaches. The white sand of Goa
can cope more than admirably with bouquets of diverse colour splashes
and what may look classic on colder shores looks merely stuffy against
burning sand.
In terms of the florals, some of the costumes could be said to be
reminiscent of wallpaper but they are not for wallflowers nor will they
let the wearer fade into the background. The new swimwear patterns are
all about standing out in the crowd with something different.
To effect this, the new patterns are a lot more complex than just
straight blocks of colour. Where in the past few years, design efforts
have concentrated on the upholstery and control, this time round an
equal measure of emphasis has been laid on the pattern with the result
that many are extremely intricate and diverse.
Paisley is a pattern which tends to have winter associations but it
makes an emergence in some of this spring's swimwear. Gottex have taken
it on a tour of India and the result is redolent of the Raj days and the
best of the British Empire. For example, its Maharajah range is a
delicate self-coloured Paisley with the heat turned up by the addition
of flame red and floral borders. It also has an Indian nights selection
with sultry midnight blue and teal interwoven.
Underlining the complexity of the patterns available is its
Egyptomania 27-colour signature print which combines a shadowy
background with bold colours, enhanced by gold outline, echoing
Cleopatra in all her bejewelled majesty. In contrast there are softly
feminine Jeans Blue tie-dye prints with pastel on pastel hibiscus
flowers.
Flowers are definitely taking the heat from Slix this year. Some of
the biggest, blowsiest and fun florals are to be found under this label,
which includes blooms from bold-as-brass red roseheads to poppies and
washed-out pastel flora.
The names of the ranges are spot-on -- Havana which is big hot heads
of flowers on a black background, pulsating with Spanish passion;
Castaway which is easy-on-the-eye colours with simply sketched poppies
and daisies; and Aloha which is a welcome mix of a sea-blue body
obliquely crossed by a band of flowers. As names, Tropical and Romance
need even less spelling out in terms of what they deliver in one and two
pieces.
Gideon Oberson -- a name which has rapidly worked its way into the top
end of the Scottish swimwear market -- dares to deliver last year's
innovative mesh in patterns. Striking in white, its Elysia range is bold
enough to go with a visual treat for the eye, with see-through patterned
mesh sections but also cries out to be touched with colour-backed
sections putting the accent on the texture.
Elsewhere in the Gideon Oberson collection for 1995 there are a
surfeit of good pattern ideas from florals to abstracts. Its gold, black
and white range, which revels in the name of Infinity is particularly
striking, while decidely hothouse colours can be found in its Pitango
range. An interesting variation of the Gideon Oberson collection is its
use of patterned sections to project a sculpted body shape with patterns
drawn on plain backgrounds at strategic points such as the tops of
breasts or at the hips to create an image of curves.
Livia is a swimwear range which indubitably spells out its French
heritage with sophisticated but simple good taste. It has also dabbled
with pattern designs this spring with influences ranging from Aztec to
snakeskin; a direction, which from the likes of Livia, underlines the
prevalence of patterns in this season's swimwear.
In terms of shape, bikinis and one-pieces are equally in favour
although last year's string bikini has thankfully been strung out and
left to dry elsewhere.

DAVID Kaye has no doubt how he established his reputation as a
solicitor -- he won good settlements for individual clients who found
''foreign matter'' in their food.
The nature of his clients have changed somewhat over the years and
David now finds himself working for major tour operators such as Thomson
or travel agents Going Places.
But David still takes the practice of law, which often projects a
pompous image to outsiders, back to basics by recalling that ''we became
involved in the tour operator business when my partner's sister had a
nightmare of a holiday. She was so angry with what happened while she
was away that she signed up the entire plane to take their complaints
further, and we raised an action.''
David realised that there was good business to be done in this field
and hot-footed it down to travel seminars in London, and convinced the
travel firms that they did not need to go through English solicitors to
engage a Scots law firm.
''We established direct links with the travel companies themselves,
and now act north of the border for a number of companies in this
field.''
David is the senior partner in the Glasgow firm of Clairmonts --
formed last week when Maitlands, which had offices in Glasgow and
Greenock, divided in two.
''Maitlands was formed in Greenock 71 years ago,'' explains David
Kaye, ''but after I joined them in 1981 I convinced them they should
open in Glasgow.
''We developed into the commercial market in Glasgow, and Greenock
continued as a local solicitors' office. They will continue to use the
Maitlands name in Greenock and we took our new name from our address
which is Clairmont Gardens.''

GAEL Quality, a young Scottish specialist computer company, has landed
a top European contract to help create a quality assurance framework for
small to medium-sized firms within Europe, writes BILL MAGEE.
Gael operates within the Scottish Enterprise Technology Park and was
created following a management buy-out from the ashes of Motherwell
Bridge.
It had hardly completed its first business quarter before being told
it was in the running to get the Euro call as the only Scots firm to
join an elite group of IT specialists.
With its new windows software package Q-pulse, the firm has already
attracted clients like Unisys, the Defence Research Agency, Walter
Alexander Coachbuilders, Du Pont (UK) and Clyde River Purification
Board.
Now Gael is joining the EC ITAQUA programme to provide Q-pulse as a
quality ''tool'' within a computer toolset of six components for the
European business quality Esprit project.
Just returned from trade missions in Portugal and Cork, Michael Slade,
Gael's marketing partner, said: ''As we speak a new revision of Q-pulse
is undergoing its final trials and is scheduled for release soon.''
Gael joins firms from France, Dublin and England for the Euro SMEs
quality model project work, he added.
Esprit is based on a fully-integrated package to help companies
throughout the community improve their efficiency and of equal
importance productivity.
The contract reflects Gael's rapid development of leader status in a
niche market. This has been achieved by producing and marketing
user-friendly software solutions to business together with linked
consultancy and training services.

STRIPES are running the length and breadth of this season's nattiest
jackets, skirts, trousers, shorts and beachwear.
Always chic in monotone navy or black and white, broad or narrow
stripes will of course accentuate a curvy figure.
They will be appearing on a dress near you shortly from labels such as
Escada, Laurel and Dranella.
The advantage of little striped dress is that it can instantly put
some zest into last year's blazer and it is nautical enough to look
military-smart without going too far down the nautical line.
But those who enjoy the crisp, sea-faring look are well catered for by
labels such as Verse and Emreco Knitwear who will provide the deckwear
for those who like to dress for the call of the ocean wave.

NO longer are waistcoats the exclusive property of stuffy city gents.
They have long been wrestled from that grasp, cut into a range of
different shapes from every conceivable texture and rapidly transformed
into one of the most flattering and essential additions to the basics in
any woman's wardrobe.
The standard fitted waistcoat shape still applies for workwear,
snuggling tidily under this year's version of the loose-fitting trouser
suit. It adds a touch of Wall Street chic to some of the more natural
fabrics that are sure to be a hit again this year.
Over a white or pale-striped shirt, the fitted waistcoat is also a
perfect warmer when the bright spring mornings aren't quite as warm they
look. Soft greys and beiges can blend well with summery blues and pinks
for those offices where smart doesn't necessarily mean navy blue.
It is in that precious time out of the office, however, that
waistcoats can be worn to their best advantage.
The basic shape lends itself to so many interpretations that whether
you choose to spend the summer lazing in cream linen or want to dazzle
in bright metallics, there will be a waistcoat to drape loosely over
wide-cut trousers or hug your curves for hot nights on the town.
When the long hot summer arrives, waistcoats can also provide an
alternative to T-shirts and vest tops for holiday wear. Wear it casually
with shorts during the day for sight-seeing or jazzed up with some
well-chosen jewellery and a flowing skirt for a night on the tiles --
the whole look is always effective.
It is also encouraging to see that each design house is taking its own
path with waistcoats, leading to a greater choice. Miss Britt has short
patterned waistcoats that take the ''sameness'' away from a
self-coloured suit. Worn on its own with a simple piece of jewellery at
the neck, it can have the same steamy effect as any of the
figure-hugging dresses and skirts that promise to restrict our breathing
this summer.
Waistcoats which form part of a slimming one-colour outfit come from
Gerry Weber, who has incorporated tasty raspberry and welcoming mocha
into the shades of cream. Even stronger colours can found throughout the
Lucia range which offers well-cut knitwear in a range of bright colours,
some which should be avoided by shrinking violets.
Colours transcend the seasons, however, with Gil Bret bringing a warm
rust to cool linen trousers and a crisp white shirt. Planet, part of the
Windsmoor Group, has also brought autumnal colours forward to team up
with the creams and blacks which form the basis of ''The Spirit Of
Adventure'' look. This appears to be inspired by a great unmade film
which starred Rita Hayworth as aglamorous explorer who unearthed the
tombs of the Pharaohs. Even she wore a waistcoat.

Menswear is determined by ''how the mood takes you'' this summer.
MENSWEAR used to be a dull mixture of suits, slacks and a certain make
of sweater, but over the past few years there has been a relaxation,
with men's clothing becoming less rigid and more inventive.
Skirts, as worn by Jonathon Ross, may not be commonplace but smash and
grab sartorial raids of that nature have not only meant more women
toying with boys' suits but a lessening of the regulations which used to
surround the male versions.
Rediscovered by the women's sector, dressing up will continue to
remain important for menswear, with suits enjoying echoes of sexy
Italian styling on single-breasted jackets. Where it is not lightly
pin-striped, this summer's suit can dare to be shiny, recalling not only
the Italian mood but moped magic and the flash mods of the sixties.
Classic striped suits are available on Jasper Conran's label while
distinctive three-button grey versions with the accent on cool can be
found from Louis Feraud.
Linen, which has decimated rigid tailoring over the past couple of
years, will again be popular with men who like to crease up with
laughter and folds rather than suffocate in straight suits. Ever fresh
for spring and summer are the natural linen shades of ecru and
off-white, but there will also be warm earth tones such as reddish brown
and shades of red from brick to cinnamon, available from labels such as
Hugo Boss.
Waistcoats have become a hallmark of the menswear market and this year
there is a definite trend towards soft, less structured looks which will
not rein their wearer in, but let them hang out with greater grace.
The collarless grandpa shirt will undergo a resurgence of
acceptability, encouraged by the ever-dominant sportswear section and
its demand for easy-living garments with no restraints. Meant to be worn
casually and not crisply ironed, the new grandpa shirt should be grained
or striped for extra-crumpled chic.
A look which will be particularly strong for younger men this spring
has shades of the military with tight T-shirts and trews in khaki.
Essential to this look is an almost dirty, sweaty feel of clothes which
have been out and seen service in the jungle rather than on the parade
ground.
Jackets have to hang loose and long to be in keeping with this
Army-style, draping purposefully, if a tad unkempt, over straight
trousers. Generally speaking blousons are not cutting it in 1995, with
jackets hanging towards the mid-thigh, whether they are sealed against
the weather or in softest suede for a spot of cafe mingling.
Soft nappa suede has all the right connotations for relaxed dressing
and colours are redolent of the natural linen hues. Ready for the
vagaries of the Scottish summer, it's not exactly practical for
downpours. A label which typifies this relaxed approach to summer is
Arnold Zimberg.
Spring is supposed to be the season when a young man's fancy turns to
love, but when it comes to sartorial trends for men or women, it is the
time when design houses tend to think our aspirations are all at sea.
Every spring and summer brings a rash of nautical-inspired clothes. For
men in 1995, the look is not so much smartly blazered as loosely
jacketed in wind-cheaters -- the look is very much in keeping with the
yachting fraternity who get to grips with the rigging rather than
gentlemen sailors.
This year's nautical menswear from names such as Mulberry is loose and
comfortable. It is all about being on board in deck shoes and leaving
one's cares behind on shore with the smart suit.

Quiet supporters will help you shape up
DEFINED curves are the essence of the season as spring and summer
moods reflect the fabulous fifties, when contours were squeezed into
tight-fitting outfits that proved it wasn't the clothes that maketh the
woman.
This season's full-bodied glamour is of course underlined by the
lingerie, which embodies the curvy woman.
Not only deeply glamorous, lingerie is about holding curves in place
to present an outline of contours and seductive heat. It is not enough
just to be up and at 'em, bras have to be smooth and controlled.
It is not a look for women who model themselves on Kate Moss, but
equally it is not so easy on overly full figures. It is a look for real
women's figures rather than girls made pneumatic by lycra.
But there is hope for us all, little or large. The designers have also
gone all-out for constructions which work to give voluptuous curves
without drumming out rolls of flesh at the side.
Exquisite Form, which has its base in Glasgow, has two main brands --
''Fully'' for larger figures and ''Elegance'' which is aimed at a
younger market. The Fully range obviously offers strict control with the
company's patented underarm X seam, which provides added capacity to the
cups, if and when required, preventing unsightly overspill.
But its Elegance customers are also being offered the season's deft
but tightly controlled curves with a combination of stretch lace and
satin top cups which sculpt a classically feminine outline of the
breasts. This full but graceful shaping is also reflected in Gossard's
new Elyse range, which brings together continental styling with textured
plisse.
In a dramatic departure from sweet florals, Elyse is a Lycra and
Tactel Jacquard with a subdued lustre to emphasise a raised pin-tuck
effect and is contrasted with stretch Leavers Lace from France in a
geometric abstract design.
Lovable is a name which is also synonymous with structured support and
this spring it is staying true to form, albeit with a new innovation in
its range of bras and bodies. Its research department has whipped out
underwiring and fitted its range of bras with a new development which
Lovable calls the new continuous cup-strap band; a development so new
the spring brochures still carry its notification of patent application.
Charnos have stepped in to accommodate the new all-woman shape with
its Superfit Exclusives range, which has been specially adapted for
women who require large cups but do not necessarily have fuller figures.
While girls with larger busts have had occasion to forego pretty
lacing for fit and comfort, Charnos hopes to rectify this by retaining
pretty and lacey looks in tandem with good construction. The Concerto
range, with its corsetry styling, uses stretch fabrics for comfort.
Glamour, however, delivers its impact through more than an outline and
while this season's lingerie may be under control it is not always
content to be under wraps. The look is still very much lingerie at its
lacey best but this season it is also screaming to be seen in wild
colours. Charnos give little for convention with the introduction of a
new raspberry shade for 1995 while Lovable play with hot pinks,
strawberry and turquoise.
The Ultrabra from Gossard is stopping at nothing when it comes to
grabbing attention with the issue of shocking pink and electric blue to
peep a little less than coyly from leather jackets or chiffon tops.
Cacherel also lightens the effect by incorporating colours and hues
which can go outdoors -- French navy, gingham, grey with patchwork and
broderie anglaise in a range of three new looks for summer. Choose from
St Tropez, Biarritz or Provence for a Bardot take on curves.

Enticement comes on strong as the light fades
GLAMOUR -- with red talons, stiletto heels and wild femininity -- is
back. Not only is it creating Loren look-alikes on the daytime streets,
it has also reclaimed the night from smart trouser suits and subtle
allure.
Dresses are where it is at for evenings, the more vampish the better
with no holding back on camp details such as split skirts, tulle,
glitter and satin. This is Marlene Dietrich when she wasn't seeing what
the boys in the back room would have, or sexually confusing the
audience.
This is girls grabbing back the high ground of glamour from pretty
boys who have overdosed on make up. Women are coming out fighting to
prove that it is hard to beat the genuine article. Having seen the
long-lashed lads strut their stuff in the cinema and in the adverts, the
look remains long and lean and essentially decadent in tribute to the
old days of Berlin.
But it is all woman, with skirts which flounce and strappy necklines
in which females can parade their credentials -- real or otherwise -- to
an admiring audience. The first siren call in this backlash was
undoubtedly from Elizabeth Hurley in that dress. Her ''pin-up'' Versace
side-splitter may not exactly be what most women would opt for, but it
has undoubtedly set the tone for the summer with a surfeit of strapping
around to create diversion and interest in necklines and elsewhere.
This new verve in the evening market fits in well with a fashion
producer such as Frank Usher, which has stuck with glamour throughout
the thick and thin of the grunge years. Now is the time of Frank Usher's
revenge and the label is revelling in it with a wash of materials such
as crepe, satin, lace and chiffon -- a world away from mire.
Lengths vary from calf to ankle, but they are all generally
figure-skimming, underlining womanly curves either with tailoring or
flounce. There are also a number of interesting details such as
criss-cross straps at the front of dresses.
Little figure-hugging numbers are also being delivered by Vera Mont.
Its chic cocktail outfits and evening dresses are enlivened not only by
intricate designs but also by lacing and high-slits to give tantalising
hints of shapely pins.
Dusk is a label catering to young sophisticates. It has gone for a
range of flighty dresses, which should be arrested for flouncing with
intent, with essentially feminine furls of chiffon at the hemline and
straps at the shoulder.
Black being the colour of the femme fatale's soul, there are a lot of
noirish shades around, but glamour can also be fun in white and acid
greens, pinks and even purples.

SCOTS have long been noted for inventiveness. It is one of the totems
of our heritage and conjures in the mind the great names of John Logie
Baird, John McAdam, Sir Alexander Fleming and many others.
In today's fast moving technology-oriented world, it is impossible to
be first to the marketplace with absolutely everything but not
impossible to derive business benefit from those in pole position.
If ever there were a precedent on a subject, then it is Japan and its
industrial success since the Second World War. The Japanese didn't
somehow crawl out of the radioactive dust of 1945 and design their way
into being world leaders in electronics, robotics and the like. Instead,
they leapfrogged into the second half of the twentieth century with a
cheque book and pen -- and licensed capability from the West.
The licensing of product and service technology -- intellectual
property, to use the buzz phrase -- presents an immense opportunity
which, to date, our business community has been slow to fully embrace.
It works in two ways: first, licensing out your own excellence for
others to produce at an agreed fee and, secondly, licensing in to that
''property'' in order to profit from somebody else's development time.
Naturally, both require professional expertise in the negotiation and
drafting of appropriate agreements. The former is the more obvious
route, so I will concentrate the focus upon the latter.
Without ignoring the need to innovate indigenously it is my view that
if more effort were made by Scottish businesses , including the SME
sector, in assessing licensing-in opportunities it would bring a dynamic
new element to our economy.
Let's briefly examine the business case. Licensing-in is an approach
for buying time; it can result in faster commercial production and
market entry and can be significantly less expensive than internal
development and, consequently, less financial risk.
Specialised knowledge and skills usually come with a license-in
agreement. These could be beyond the capability of the licensee to
develop or, at least, to develop within a reasonable time scale relative
to the pace of market movement.
A further bonus in this regard is the likelihood of continuing
technical assistance from the licensor through the licensing agreement.
Putting to the side the prestige of solely developing a product or
process, which may be difficult to justify in the balance sheet at the
end of a year anyway, involvement in a licensing-in deal may allow a
company to avoid a patent or trade secret dispute, or indeed a costly
effort to circumvent existing patents. That is the sort of hassle every
business can do without. Expense is only one element to be considered in
that scenario. Of more importance may be the loss of apparent integrity,
and maybe customers.
Everybody knows that you don't have to have your own name up there in
lights to do well in business. Let's face it, vanity is seldom a useful
tool in the pursuit of success and profitability. The licensor's name or
product identiy could be a highly useful part of the deal, perhaps
allowing use of an established trade mark which carries with it positive
and immediate market recognition. Response to highly regarded
credentials such as these, even with a fresh product, is usually warm.
Not surprisingly, given the lower overall risks involved in a credible
licensing-in deal, those in larger companies whose job it is to ''sell''
the boardroom on new propositions, will probably have an easier task
persuading the top dogs that their money is, in the short and medium
term at least, generally safer if put into proven technology than if
placed in their own prototype shop.
Many may think that licensing applies only to high technology. That is
simply not the case. It can be appropriate to any market sector, whether
it be electronics or food, engineering or clothing, bio-technology or
toy manufacturing.
Notable too, is that a licensing-in agreement doesn't have to mean
that you've given up on your own development capabilities. It is not
necessarily an admission of lack of calibre in a particular field. If
anything, it is more a mark of business acumen relative to grasping the
opportunities of the moment in a cost-effective manner. As testimony,
witness the number of big name international operators involved in such
deals.
Agreements of this type frequently lead to future longer-term
business, which must mean growth and growing strength in the
marketplace. If that is not a good reason to dump the ''not invented''
here attitude, I don't know what is.
Scotland's famous sons and daughters may have been responsible for
giving the world some particularly useful innovations. We should rightly
be proud of that. Today, though, our economic interests might be best
served by both a continued application of our intellectual resource, and
a realisation that the wheel shouldn't always require re-invention.

talking to Yvonne Wightman.

SCOTLAND have made three changes to the side that played against
England at Twickenham in the Grand Slam decider last month for the match
against Romania at Murrayfield on Saturday week. Of these, one was
enforced by the injury to Gregor Townsend giving Tony Stanger the chance
to prove himself as an outside centre under what team manager Duncan
Paterson described yesterday as ''Five Nations conditions.''
Stanger is paired at centre with Graham Shiel, who comes in for Scott
Hastings, to renew a partnership forged earlier this season when the two
played together in the centre for South of Scotland.
This will be the first cap at centre for Stanger, whose 36 previous
appearances for Scotland have been as a wing. The other change is at
hooker where Kevin McKenzie, having sat on the bench for the past six
international matches, is given a reprieve from sedentary duties to take
over from Ken Milne.
Given that this is a warm-up game for the World Cup, the number of
changes does seem rather small but, clearly, the selectors were, as
Paterson suggested, compromised by the decision to award caps and, thus,
avoid devaluing this honour.
Paterson also argued that the strength of the opposition had
influenced the selection of the side. ''Romania's result against France
(a 24-15 win for the French in Bucharest) shows that they are a useful
side,'' said the Scotland team manager.
All the same, one might have wanted to see Cameron Glasgow given a run
and further international tests for Jeremy Richardson and John Manson.
However, Paterson confirmed that every player in the World Cup squad
would be given a game in Spain where the party will train at altitude
and play two games in Madrid.
There may also have been a case for playing West Hartlepool scrum half
Derrick Patterson, who the Scotland team manager admitted had been ''a
bit unfortunate.'' Clearly, the Scotland World Cup squad management are
pinning their hopes on Andy Nicol being able to demonstrate his
readiness to play in South Africa.
Nicol, who reportedly has had two good games for Bath's third side, is
expected to play for his club's reserve side against Leicester seconds
on Saturday. According to John Quinn, the Bath secretary, Nicol now has
''every chance to get a run in the first XV'' which could mean the
former Dundee HS FP scrum half being tested against Harlequins a week on
Saturday.
Paterson also stated that Peter Walton will be in action for
Northampton in their away match against Gloucester on Saturday and that
Paul Burnell would be playing for London Scottish against Nottingham at
Richmond. Team:
A G Hastings (Watsonians) captain; C A Joiner (Melrose), A G Stanger
(Hawick), A G Shiel (Melrose), K M Logan (Stirling County); C M Chalmers
(Melrose), B W Redpath (Melrose); D I W Hilton (Bath), K D McKenzie
(Stirling County), P H Wright (Boroughmuir), G W Weir (Melrose), S J
Campbell (Dundee HS FP), R I Wainwright (West Hartlepool), E W Peters
(Bath), I R Morrison (London Scottish). Replacements -- I C Glasgow
(Heriot's FP), S Hastings (Watsonians), D W Patterson (West Hartlepool),
J F Richardson (Edinburgh Academicals), J J Manson (Dundee HS FP), K S
Milne (Heriot's FP).

THERE was a different feel about Celtic Park yesterday. It was as if
everyone associated with the club realised that they were on the brink
of something big after the Scottish Cup semi-final replay victory over
Hibernian at Ibrox.
Manager Tommy Burns probably summed it up best when he said: ''This is
a happy place to be today. It's the way it used to be when I was a
player after you came to the park after having won a trophy or an
important match. There was that extra something which told you that
Parkhead was a good place to be.
''I knew that when I played here and that atmosphere is back today
after the way we beat Hibs. We know that we have something to look
forward to with the cup final at the end of next month. That is the
climax to the season for this club. There is a cup waiting to be won and
European competition beyond that. It is what this club has always been
about.''
Indeed, happy days are here again so far as Burns and his players are
concerned. The displays against Hibs in the two semi-final clashes must
have convinced even the most sceptical supporter that there is a growing
self-belief among the players.
What is more, there is a change in attitude which Burns himself has
detected over the past few games.
''I think it began in the last half-hour of the match against
Motherwell,'' he said. ''We played the kind of football that I want the
team to play. There was an abandon about our performance which appealed
to me.
''Since then, the players have given the same kind of performance
against Hibs in each of the semi-final games. That is what we have been
aiming for, playing with a lot of style and attacking as much as
possible.
''The games against Hibs have underlined our commitment to that type
of football and that's the way we will continue.''
Burns has watched Airdrie twice this season and will watch them again
before the cup final but he insists that the Parkhead club will not
under-estimate the first-division opposition.
Nor will they worry too much that this could be a repeat of the
Coca-Cola Cup final when Celtic lost to another first-division side,
Raith Rovers.
Yesterday, there were signs from Burns that he was getting his team in
order, not only to win the cup and end the trophy famine which has
haunted Celtic for so long, but to the possibility of playing in Europe
again.
He believes now that he has a settled back four, a part of his team
where he has allied athleticism to skill. The Albanian, Rudi Vata, has
proved so successful at right back that he will be offered a new
contract to remain with the club.
Tommy Boyd has moved to his original position in the heart of the
defence -- ''He played there with Motherwell when he started out,''
Burns recalled -- and will remain there.
''I think Tommy is back in his best position. At full back he was
being asked to do too much. In this area he is perfect. He is an ideal
partner for Brian O'Neil and no-one will ever run away from him.
''I'm sure Tommy is as happy as I am that he is playing in that
central defensive area. But, he would play in goal for this club if you
asked him.
''There were lots of good things for us in the two games against Hibs.
The attitude of the players demonstrated just how much they wanted to
win the semi-final. And some of the individual performances were
important to us.
''Phil O'Donnell will get a lift from his goal but he should not worry
about the fact that he is our record buy. That has nothing to do with
him. I decided on his value and I stick by that valuation because I know
how important a player he will be for this club.''
As to the chance of playing in Europe, Burns said: ''We want to make
some kind of impact if we do qualify for the Cup-winners' Cup. We don't
want to get stuck in a revolving door and find ourselves out of the
competition almost as soon as we are in. That's not what this club is
accustomed to and what we want is to be prepared for Europe if we do get
there.''
First though, there is Airdrie and all the hang-ups that a cup final
against another first-division side will bring.
Against Hibs, the pressures were handled superbly. Now, Burns is
looking for an action replay on May 27 and, at the end of the day, a
trophy which will put him and his players into the history books as the
men who ended one of the gloomiest runs Celtic have endured.

''YE shall hear of wars and rumours of wars'' (Matthew 24:6). Wrong
again. What we hear now is of sleaze and rumours of sleaze, and it's
reached the point where the writers of novels and screenplay fiction
about political chicanery are liable to go out of business.
But for us, consumers of sleaze in the market-place, the picture has
become totally confusing. There is far too much to choose from. No
sooner have we bought a sleaze fact or a sleaze rumour than it is
rendered out of date by a new, improved model. It's like buying a PC or
a modem. One week after you've parted with the cash, what you've bought
is superseded by something newer, faster and flashier: your own version
is cut to half-price, and you're left for years to play with what is now
an ''inferior product''.
Another product is this. You will find plenty of magazines and pundits
able to advise you on trends and developments in electronic design. You
can be warned in advance and take your chances. But there's no such
magazine as Sleaze Monthly -- and, let's be honest, it would have to be
Sleaze Hourly to keep up with progress.
At our coffee break yesterday in the Nerd House commissariat, we
wrestled with the problem. How to predict new developments in sleaze
facts and sleaze rumours so that the buying public is protected?
The best idea came from The Braces. ''We should write the headlines,
then wait for the politicians to come along and fill in the bit
underneath.'' So we started off:
Tory MP in Seven-in-a-Bed Scandal. This one is self-explanatory,
although the MP in question is more ambitious than average. The three
other males involved, managers of unit trusts etc, said they hadn't
suspected their bedfellow was an MP, although they'd wondered at the
time why he couldn't supply his own girlfriend.
Cash-for-Noises Rumpus. In the run-up to the English local elections,
unnamed MPs have accepted payments for making noises during debates on
the following scale: baying, #1000; screeching, #1500; ordering-off by
Madam Speaker, #2000. They were entrapped by a man in a rugby shirt
posing as a TV producer.
Kiss-and-Tell Journalist of the Year Missing. The winner of this
accolade in the Press Awards failed to collect his prize at last night's
glittering ceremony in the Savoy. Outside the hotel, he was met by a
scrambling press of MPs and junior ministers but was not seen to emerge
at the other side.
''So far so good,'' said The Braces. ''Now let's start on next week's
. . . ''
* So it was Back to the 50s on Tuesday at New St Andrew's House in
Edinburgh, when an electricity fault disempowered electric typewriters,
fax machines, computers and telephones and, of course, the governing of
Scotland. Only one phone line into the building was working.
We learned about this at McSonachan's when Fabian the Factotum turned
up unusually early. He's a senior civil servant: well, anyway, he's 59.
He commutes from Glasgow: he usually reaches McSonachan's on the stroke
of eight, but this time he was at the bar even before the Nerd House
regulars.
We asked how the day had gone. ''Terribly,'' he sighed, ''an absolute
disaster.''
This was a surprising reaction. We thought he would have loved it. No
demands for Scottish Office reaction on the Rolls-Royce board's 27%
rise? No bitter complaints about Dornoch Academy's opt-out budget? No
nightmares over the Scottish-London sleeper trains? Complete cessation
of ''in'', ''pending'' and ''out''? It sounded like a perfct day at the
office.
Fabian the Factotum sipped his pint lachrymosely. ''You've forgotten
something,'' he said. ''The situation played absolute hell with the tea
trolley.'' Of course, we said. How silly of us.

Kilmarnock 3, Hearts 2
KILMARNOCK'S bright new Chadwick stand, to be opened against Rangers
next week, looks certain to be in use in the premier division against
next season after the Ayrshire side's hard won three points, which takes
them into sixth place in the table.
Hearts' miserable end to the season continues and, unless they halt
their recent depressing run, they could be hauled into the relegation
contest again.
Manager Alex Totten considered the three points collected ''very
important,'' but would not allow any talk of safety yet. His rival,
Tommy McLean, saw a great deal of ''character'' in his side's
performance, but added: ''The timing of their goals killed us -- they
were bad goals to lose.''
He revealed that Dave McPherson, who was carried off, had twisted a
knee and would need to be assessed in the morning.
If Hearts' moral was at a low after their Scottish Cup defeat, it did
not get much help from the way Killie hurried into business. Within two
minutes the Tynecastle side were a goal down.
They had nothing else to blame other than their own failure to mark
Neil Whitworth, who was given plenty space to send in a powerful header
from an Ally Mitchell corner. There were claims of final touches from
others, but the header seemed to me good enough by itself.
In 17 minutes the Ayrshire lads went two up. The Hearts defence was
split by a clever lay-off from Wright, whose flick left Henry racing
through on Nelson. The midfield player showed excellent composure to
send a right-foot shot high into the net.
Kilmarnock relaxed for a spell and were punished by Cramb, who ran on
to a free kick from Miller and jumped with delight when his shot was
slightly deflected past Lekovic.
No team ever gets the best of help from fortune when they are in the
dumps and in 34 minutes Hearts suffered another setback when Dave
McPherson was carried off after he fell heavily following a headed
clearance.
In 60 minutes Killie went two clear again. Whitworth added more icing
to his twenty-third birthday celebrations by outjumping the Hearts
defence to head in a corner from Connor.
Whitworth became the third man to have his name taken, following his
team-mate MacPherson in the first half and Hearts' John Millar early in
the second, but there was nothing malicious about the play.
Hearts had still not given up and with five minutes left they caused
great alarm among the 7239 watchers when Jamieson headed in their second
goal.
KILMARNOCK -- Lekovic, MacPherson, Black, Findlay, Whitworth,
Anderson, Mitchell, Henry, Wright, Connor, Maskrey. Substitutes --
Montgomerie, Brown, Geddes.
HEARTS -- Nelson, Wishart, Miller, Levein, Berry, McPherson,
Colquhoun, Mackay, Cramb, Millar, Johnston. Substitutes -- Jamieson,
Locke, Smith.
Referee -- E Martindale (Newlands).

MANCHESTER United captain Steve Bruce and Gary Pallister took the FA
Cup holders back to Wembley with first-half goals which destroyed
Crystal Palace 2-0 in last night's semi-final replay at Villa Park,
Birmingham, as both sides were reduced to 10 men after the break.
Bruce marked his return from suspension by heading United in front
after 30 minutes and his central defensive partner, Pallister, added a
similar goal four minutes before the interval.
The second-half erupted into violence as United's Roy Keane and Darren
Patterson, of Palace, both were sent off for violent conduct after 53
minutes in a game watched by the smallest post-war semi-final crowd of
just 17,987.
Robbie Fowler left it late to score his thirtieth goal of the season
as fifth-placed Liverpool pinched a last-minute 1-0 win at Arsenal.
The PFA's young player of the year only had to tap in following a
storming run down the left by Steve McManaman which stripped the
Highbury side's defence bare.
Nottingham Forest were also grateful to a late strike by Steve Stone
five minutes from time for their victory at Carrow Road, a result which
thrust Norwich deeper into relegation trouble.
Matt Le Tissier's twenty-fifth goal of the season helped Southampton
to a 2-0 win to lift them to fourteenth, level on points with hosts
Chelsea who stay just four points above the relegation zone.
* JURGEN Klinsmann is set to disappoint a clutch of overseas clubs and
stay with Tottenham Hotspur next season. The German has been a top
target for Bayern Munich while Italians AC Milan have also been linked
with the striker.
But Spurs manager Gerry Francis said: ''Jurgen has told myself and
Alan Sugar that he will stay here next season. As far as know, that is
how it will be.''
* AC Milan and Genoa yesterday lost an appeal against the two-match
closure of their stadia, imposed after crowd clashes in January led to
the death of a fan.
* THE following premier division matches have been arranged for next
midweek:
Tuesday -- Motherwell v Aberdeen, Partick Thistle v Dundee United.
Wednesday -- Celtic v Hearts, Hibernian v Falkirk (5.0). Thursday --
Kilmarnock v Rangers (7.45).

THIS season's shoes are pretty obvious, teetering in glaring colours
on six-inch stiletto heels, but behind the headline story there is
always another side-bar story waiting to get out.
Stilettoes will undoubtedly be clicking across streets and wittering
around tables in night clubs, but they remain too much a figment of male
fantasy -- too tarty and too slight -- for many women. A modicum of
support is available for those who want to wear stilettoes but need some
reassurance that they will not fall out of them and those who do not
want to wear stilettoes but would like to look reasonably fashionable.
For those who are going to teeter, the feeling of vertigo can partly
be assuaged by stilettoes with straps. Perhaps it is a purely
psychological need, but it is surely not surprising that a good number
of this year's six-inch heels are fronted by at least one single strap
around the ankle if not more.
Strappy sandals are right on course with the glamour asserting itself
in the international fashion stakes. They denote starlets and tarty
chic. It is just by good fortune that they also help a girl feel that
she is not about to fall flat on her face from a gradient that would
strain Chris Bonnington.
This current fixation with straps also lends a right-on air to lower
and chunkier heels. Low shoes with plenty of strappy additions will look
in training with the glam brigade, at least from the front.

IF Jean-Marc Bosman had been quietly transferred from Standard Liege
to Dunkirk four years ago, then it seems reasonably certain that his
anonymity on the international footballing stage would have remained
intact.
Now, however, he is poised to take his place in the history of
European football as the man who blew apart the transfer system, and
transformed the structures of the game. At the same time, he could win
the plaudits of clubs like Rangers and Manchester United by sidelining
the ''three foreigners'' rule.
After four years in the courts, there is just one more step to go
before this explosion occurs under the authoritarian structures of
European -- and indeed world -- football.
The multi-million-dollar question is whether Bosman will take that
step or if, before June 20 when his case is due to be heard in the
European Court of Justice, he will succumb to the blandishments of UEFA
and other ruling bodies.
No figures can be mentioned, but it might safely be assumed that
Bosman will become a rich man if he decides to abandon the case at this
eleventh hour. The size of the vested interests involved would make sure
of that.
There is little doubt that the football transfer system has been in
breach of the Treaty of Rome for the past 40 years. It inhibits every
right enshrined in that Treaty, and subsequently expanded in others,
concerning the free movement of labour.
For a variety of reasons, however, the issue has never been contested
in the courts to the point at which a formal ruling was produced. UEFA
has used its substantial influence to ensure that the European
Commission kepts its distance from the internal affairs of football.
At the same time, UEFA has haughtily ignored the existence of players'
organisations, particularly FIFPRO which has been in existence as a
federation of European players' unions for the past 25 years. If there
was no recognition, there need be no negotiation.
From time to time, particularly as cross-border transfers became more
common, someone has thought of challenging the system and the legal
machinery has been cranked up. But footloose footballers are not natural
litigants. Each time, the challenge petered out and UEFA carried on as
before.
Two of the more recent potential causes celebre had strong Scottish
connections. For a while, meetings of FIFPRO would reverberate to the
name of Danny Diver -- now of Alloa -- who was being frustrated in his
desire to transfer from a Belgian club to Albion Rovers. Then Hans
Gillhaus was in the same position when Aberdeen put a price on his head.
But Bosman has been by far the most persistent. He was out of contract
with Liege, who retained his registration until another club paid up,
paying him substantially less money which would not have been allowed to
happen in this country.
Bosman, who has not played since, has already won his case in the
Belgian courts. There is a strong expectation that will do so at the
European Court of Justice, if he takes that final step. Throughout
Europe, clubs which deal in vast transfer fees are waking up to the
implications.
It seems unlikely that the Court would simply declare open season and
complete freedom of movement. More probably, they would recognise that
while the transfer system is against European law, there are special
circumstances which require a system which is based on consent.
For UEFA, that would mean a major culture shock. Instead of laying
down the law on transfers, the ''foreigners'' restrictions and many
other contentious issues, they would be obliged to do what they have
steadfastly refused to do for the past 25 years -- negotiate with
FIFPRO.
The national players' organisations themselves are not, in general,
enthusiastic about a complete free-for-all. They recognise that many
clubs are dependent on transfer fees for revenue, and could not be
weaned off that source of income in the short-term. They also know that
the abolition of transfer fees would remove the incentive to raise
home-grown talent.
On the issue of the number of foreign players which a club can sign or
field, there are also different views among both clubs and players'
unions. Some want a complete removal of barriers; others, like the
English, are much more cautious. But the important point is that a
consensus would require to be negotiated, and that would be a change
with enormous implications.
It may be that the change is happening anyway. The imminence and
significance of the Bosman case has helped to transform FIFPRO into a
much more effective organisation. A record 13 countries were represented
when it met in Strasbourg this week, and held discussions with Bosman
and his lawyers. The appointment of Gordon Taylor, chief executive of
English PFA, as its chairman is an indicator that it means serious
business.
Earlier this year, the board of FIFPRO led by Taylor had its first
ever meeting with UEFA which is now talking about ''informal
recognition''. Whatever happens to the Bosman case, the days seem to be
numbered for the idea that football can operate indefinitely outside of
European law and without recognition of players' rights.
Very few of them are millionaires, as popularly portrayed, but an
increasing number of them will want to pursue their trade protected by
the same rights as any other set of workers, and without prices being
placed on their heads.

DEREK DOUGLAS, Chief rugby writer, in Bucharest
THREE Russian players have been suspended by FIRA following the
disgraceful scenes of violence which erupted during Scotland's Junior
World Cup opening tie on Tuesday.
After a night of deliberation, and after what FIRA vice-president Jose
Epalza, of Spain, called a sad day for rugby, the FIRA disciplinary
committee handed down a one-year ban on Alexei Vareonkine, the Russian
substitute who ran on to the field to kick a Scot who was lying on the
ground.
Two other players, Sergei Novosselov and Alexei Spirink, were
suspended for six months and three months for, respectively, kicking and
persistent fighting.
In a harsh decision, the committee also decreed that both captains
should be warned about the ''bad spirit'' shown by both teams during the
game.
Scotland Under-19 team manager David Sole said he was happy that FIRA
had been seen to take strong action but was disappointed at the decision
to warn Scottish captain Russell Kennedy along with his Russian
counterpart.
''I'm disappointed because we were trying to maintain discipline in
extraordinarily difficult circumstances. However, the decision has been
taken and we have to live with it.
''I spoke to the players last night and they are being very positive.
It has pulled the boys closer together. However, I would not wish them
to have to go through anything like that again in their entire
careers,'' said Sole.
Epalza said that the Russians had accepted the decision to suspend
Vareonkine but had been displeased with the other suspensions. They had
argued that both teams had been fighting.
''We considered sending the entire Russian team home but we have
decided that it is better to punish the guilty ones,'' he said.
''The Russians do not understand the concept of rucking and there was
also a problem with them communicating with the South African referee.
''The philosophy of FIRA is that we have young boys playing in our
tournament and we want to educate them in rugby and to have them enjoy
the company of boys from other countries. If things go wrong then we
have to put them right and that is what we have done.''
Yesterday, the Scottish Rugby Union released a copy of the letter of
complaint which had been sent to FIRA by senior committee man Graham
Young, who is accompanying the party in Romania.
Young wrote: ''We witnessed the worst display of indiscipline that any
of us had ever seen.
''The worst outbreak of violence came in the second half and two or
three of the Russians started to kick members of the Scottish team. One
player was kicked on the head while lying on the ground. One of the
Russian replacement players even came 20 metres from a bench to punch
one of our players.
''The incident was the worst possible advertisement for rugby and I am
glad that no parents of the Scottish team were there to witness it.''

JUST about the only people in the town of Airdrie who are not excited
about the prospect of a joust with Celtic at Hampden on May 27 are the
players themselves. And yesterday club captain Jimmy Sandison, who had
the heartbreak of missing the Scottish Cup final against Rangers three
years ago because of suspension, summed up the feeling of the squad.
''I know there was all sort of talk before the Celtic-Hibs replay
about who we would prefer to meet in the final,'' said Sandison, who led
the first division side to victory over his old club Hearts in
Saturday's semi-final at Hampden. ''I can tell you, we weren't
interested. All that concerned us was that we were already in the final
and it didn't matter who won the other semi.''
Now, of course, Airdrie, who have become cup specialists under manager
Alex MacDonald, will be going all out to complete a first division
double over Celtic, who earlier in the season lost the Coca-Cola Cup
final to Raith Rovers in a penalty decider. All the pressure will be on
Celtic, says Sandison.
He added: ''If you compare the set-up, the players and the clubs then,
obviously, Celtic are odds-on favourites to win the cup. Surely that's
pressure on them for a start. They have gone so long without winning a
trophy, and that's added pressure.
''Now, having lost one final to Raith Rovers, they are facing another
first division side. If they were to lose this one to lowly Airdrie --
we're often described that way -- their fans will slaughter them. Celtic
have so much to lose, and that could get to them.
''It was the same in our semi against Hearts. They have been starved
of success for so long and they had so much to lose. Their fans were
desperate for them to beat us, but it didn't happen. We won because we
were the better side, but maybe the pressure got to them, for they just
didn't perform on the day.''
According to the Airdrie captain, there will be no chance of his side
freezing on the big day. Six of the current squad played in the final
against Rangers, pushing them all the way, while Sandison and Kenny
Black, who were both suspended, know what the big occasion is all about.
''We've got more men who have experienced this particular occasion
than Celtic,'' he said. ''We've been over the course before and there is
no way we will be over-awed by either the big Celtic crowd or the media
attention beforehand. We're going to enjoy the occasion.''
Manager MacDonald is another who believes the heat is on for Tommy
Burns and company. ''The pressure will all be on Celtic when it comes to
cup final day,'' he said.
''They have gone so long without a trophy win and they will have the
huge majority of the fans at Hampden, so the pressure will be on. But
we've risen to the occasion in all our cup-ties this season.''
The only cloud for Airdrie and Sandison is the fact that he is just
one yellow card away from a two-match suspension, but the Airdrie
captain is determined not to be shut out this time. ''I'll be keeping
out of trouble,'' he said. ''Nothing is going to keep me out of the side
next month.
''I still remember 1992 and sitting in the stand going through the
agonies. It was a dreadful feeling. The team was out on the pitch and I
was in the stand, perfectly fit. The only thing that kept me out was an
SFA ban and I don't want to experience that again.
''I remember Sandy Stewart leading out the side and thinking what a
great occasion it must be for him and his family. Now it's my turn. I'll
be leading the side out on May 27 and I aim to enjoy every minute of
it.''
Incidentally, Celtic or Airdrie could remain the only unbeaten cup
teams in Britain this season . . . and win nothing.
The clubs were both unbeaten in the Coca-Cola Cup earlier this season,
both losing out on penalty-kicks to Raith Rovers, and if there is still
a stalemate at Hampden after extra time next month the game will be
decided by a penalty shoot-out. That would mean one of the clubs missing
out on glory, and a European spot, without losing a cup-tie.

Remoteness is no handicap to a Stornoway arts centre.
IF art is illusion then one of the most bewildering aspects of An
Lanntair's tenth anniversary must be that Roddy Murray doesn't look a
day older than when he first took charge of the Stornoway gallery.
An Lanntair (it translates as the lantern) began in 1984 when a local
photographer, an art teacher, and an architect got together on the idea.
In a small town where the only opening for aesthetics was a
well-subscribed but temporary annual exhibition of local artists, they
recognised a clear need.
Malcolm MacLean, Sam Maynard, and Andy Bruce -- the gallery founders
-- caught a wave, secured Scottish Arts Council funding, valuable
back-up through the Manpower Services Commission, and, that essential
ingredient, a space with the potential to be a gallery on the upper
floor of Stornoway Town Hall.
Roddy Murray -- unemployed in Lewis after graduating from Glasgow
School of Art -- had to get special dispensation from the MSC to take up
the post as gallery director. He'd previously been on a government work
scheme erecting fences -- too soon, under the rules -- to be on another
project running a gallery.
The poet Iain Crichton Smith opened the first show -- a photographic
exhibition of work by Murdo MacLeod and Paul Strand's Tir a Mhurain
collection -- on March 8, 1985, and maybe An Lanntair could have bumbled
through life as a quaint little gallery selling watercolours to
tourists. But its parents had other ideas.
The first major show was ''As an Fhearann'' -- from the land -- an
eclectic collection of images, essays, and installations to mark a
milestone in Highland history: the passing of the 1886 Crofting Act.
''The impact it had was quite remarkable,'' said Murray. ''Before then
everyone would have been within their rights to think that our work was
something produced by a bunch of teuchters. But not after that.
''The exhibition encapsulated the ingredients of a good An Lanntair
show -- local relevance with a less than parochial outlook. It toured
successfully all over Scotland and in Canada.
''We make a virtue of our isolation,'' says Murray. ''If you look at
the international image of Scotland, it's almost all Highland. The whole
angle of the crofting exhibition was that it was from the Highlands,
rather than about the Highlands. Whenever we do anything we try to
maintain that same integrity.
''Paintings on walls is not everything for the gallery. Developing as
an arts centre, it has acted as a social dynamo dynamic -- sometimes
esoteric, always fun.''
Ali Farke Toure, guitarist extraordinaire from Mali, played his first
Scottish gig at An Lanntair. He nearly didn't make it.
Reaching Ullapool and facing a four-hour ferry journey, Farke Toure
revealed that in his landlocked country the ocean is where the spirits
of the dead are consigned. It was the first time he had stood next to
the sea, and he did not want to face his ancestors. Not an unusual
feeling for those about to embark the Lewis ferry, so his companions
cajoled him and a prayerful four hours followed. He played a blinder.
''The gallery's tenth anniversary show on the theme of the Callanish
stones, the island's most enduring symbol, opens tomorrow. It is
Murray's biggest project to date, with 24 artists, a CD and a book
presenting what he describes as ''subjective responses to a great
mystery''.
He adds: ''We didn't want to be retrospective, we wanted it to be what
we do best: a major thematic exhibition on an indigenous theme which has
relevance locally, nationally and internationally.''
Once a dream boy . . .
AN LANNTAIR'S TOP TEN
TEN of the best -- the director's choice from 10 years (in no
particular order):
* As an Fhearann -- Crofting Act centenary exhibition, a Highland
touchstone and an artistic success.
* Acts of Faith -- Steve Dilworth, exhibition which marked the arrival
of the Harris-based artist on the international arts scene.
* Tir nan Og -- the gallery tribute to Ewen Bain, the creator of the
Angus Og cartoon strip, which featured the original work, memorabilia,
and a giant blow-up Angus Og.
* The Letterbox Project -- letterbox designs by five artists which
became part of the Hebridean landscape. George Wylie's pillar-box red
palm tree in the middle of a Lewis village ranking as the most surreal
letterbox ever.
* Eric Hoffman -- German artist, creator of perfect tempera portraits,
''discovered'' working in an old coastguard station on Barra.
* Iain Brady -- witty, irreverent, papier-mache sculptor. Maker of
bizarre but accessible art on island themes.
* Ali Farke Toure -- all the way from Mali to Stornoway. Now legendary
world guitarist, you know where you heard him first.
* The Living paintings -- painted, suspended, real-life models pulled
3000 people through the gallery doors in two days.
* Togail Time/marking time -- the map of the Hebrides. History,
geography, and art in the cartography of the mind.
* Wolfstone gig at New Year 1992 -- unforgettable, if you can remember
it.

THE opening race at Worcester yesterday, the Cromwell Selling Hurdle,
was declared void in the interests of safety. The race was the second in
as many days to be ruled void, hot on the heels of a similar incident at
Kelso on Tuesday.
Jockey Mark Perrett was knocked unconscious when unseated from Storm
Heights at the first hurdle and was still prostrate, but receiving
medical attention, as the field made their way back into the home
straight.
The flight was dolled off and the remaining runners by-passed the
hurdle. Six of the runners then jumped the final hurdle, while the
remainder pulled up, with Persian Bud, partnered by Martin Bosley,
passing the post in front. The stewards immediately ordered an inquiry,
which resulted in the race being declared void.
Perrett, who was taken to hospital for treatment of head injuries, was
unconscious for five minutes.
Malcolm Wallace, Jockey Club director of regulations, was at the track
and said: ''We are bringing in a new rule on June 8 under which the race
would not have been declared void as hurdles and fences can then be
by-passed in the interests of safety.''

EMMA Carrick-Anderson proved both her outstanding slalom technique and
her ability to draw on her last reserves of grit and determination to
win the women's slalom at the Scottish FIS championships on Nevis Range
yesterday.
Despite a demanding month of constant races, she yesterday silenced
any critics with a superb second run to overshadow both the visiting
Swedish girls Kristina Andersson and Titti Rodling.
Andersson, ranked second in slalom on the Swedish World Cup team,
already has six years of top-class racing to her credit. She showed her
class with an inspirational first run to take a lead of 1.46 seconds
over Carrick-Anderson. She in turn had more than a second in hand over
her British team-mate Sandra Wilson.
Although Andersson faltered yards from the finish line of the second
run, losing valuable time, Carrick-Anderson's second heat matched both
Swedes for speed, leading Rodling, who headed this year's Europa Cup, by
half a second to win.
Alain Baxter (Aviemore) made sure all yesterday's Scottish and FIS
titles stayed in Scotland after opening a first run margin of nearly one
second over James Ormond.
Women's slalom -- 1, E Carrick-Anderson (Dunblane), 48.25, 48.33 =
136.58; 2, K Andersson (Sweden), 46.79, 50.45 = 137.24; 3, T Rodling
(Sweden) 49.6, 48.83 = 138.43; 4, S Wilson (Glasgow) 48.74, 49.71 =
138.45; 5, M Adam (Stirling University) 48.74, 49.71 = 138.45.
Men's slalom -- 1, A Baxter (Aviemore) 46.41, 49.30 = 135.71; 2, J
Ormond (Grand Bornand) 47.34, 49.84 = 137.18; 3, R Green (Falkirk)
47.49, 50.34 = 137.83; 4, A Pilarksi (Falkirk) 47.57, 51.04 = 138.61; 5,
M Pilarski (Falkirk) 40.92, 50.35 = 139.27.

FRASER Walker is among the group of Scottish swimmers who have gained
little benefit from last month's sunshine training camp in Lanzarote. In
fact, it may have been better if he had stayed at home.
The Commonwealth Games bronze medallist returned suffering from a
heavy cold, and his training has been severely hampered in the build-up
to a vital 10 days of swimming that start tomorrow with the Edinburgh
World Challenge at the Commonwealth Pool.
''I have missed a lot of training over the past couple of weeks,''
admitted the City of Glasgow 21-year-old, ''but I've been on a course of
antibiotics and I am now feeling better.''
However, he will be treating tomorrow's event and the weekend's
Multi-Nations Tournament as little more than a chance to get
competitively fit before the vital European championship trials start in
Sheffield a week today.
Nothing less than victory will be needed to secure his second European
appearance in Vienna in August.
Angela Pendrich is another Lanzarote casualty. She has been forced to
pull out of the Multi-Nations team, but is hopeful of being fit for
Sheffield.
The World Challenge, meanwhile, continues to throw up star names.
Norbert Rosza, Hungary's double world breast-stroke champion, and
Belgium's world bronze medallists, Fred Deburghreave and Brigette Becue,
are among the latest names to join the star-studded line-up.

ARRANGEMENTS for the Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup semi-final tie between
Kingussie and Fort William, due at Inverness on April 29, have been
thrown into disarray following the discovery that the Bught Park was not
available.
The Camanachd Association's executive council met last Friday night to
settle on the venues for the two semi-finals, pending the outcome of
Fort William's match with Glenurquhart last Saturday.
When the Fort secured victory it was clear that Inverness was to be
the venue, and clubs, media and other interested parties were informed
that Inverness had been confirmed.
The BBC, however, on a reconnaissance trip to check facilities,
discovered that the field would in fact be covered in water pipes
leading to a group of caravan enthusiasts who had booked one of the
Bught's outside facilities.
The up-shot is that the match, which should be played on a neutral
venue, will now be played in Newtonmore, just three miles from
Kingussie.
Camanachd Association officials have claimed that the indications they
had from the District Council were that the pitch was available if
needed.
However, a District Council member of staff claimed that they had not
been contacted by the association regarding this date, and that if they
had been, they would have told the officials that the date had been set
aside for the caravanners three years ago.

THERE is a growing expectation that the proposed acquisition of
Courage by Scottish &amp; Newcastle will be agreed before the end of this
month with the Edinburgh based company paying around #500m.
The deal with the Courage parent, Foster's Brewing Group of Australia,
will be complicated by the extent to which brewing and distribution
licences are transferred and particularly for those for Foster's in
Britain and Europe.
Yesterday Courage formed a joint venture company with Anheuser-Busch
European to formalise the arrangement to brew Budweiser at the Courage
owned Stag Brewery at Mortlake on the Thames.
It is intended that Anheuser, which is the world's biggest brewer with
43% of the US market and 8% of the world's, will invest #15m on plant to
produce one million barrels of Budweiser annually for the British market
or 288 million pints.
Current ''Bud'' output is 900,000 barrels with the brand the top
selling premium bottled beer having a 2% overall market share.
This is a permanent agreement but either party can sell its share with
the other's agreement. So it would seem probable that S&amp;N would end up
with a half share in Mortlake.
Meanwhile, beer from France is swamping British pubs and off-licences
at the rate of 1.1 million pints a day and is now equivalent to 4% of
the UK beer market and a sixth of the take home trade, much of it for
illegal re-sale.
According to research from the Brewers and Licensed Retailers
Association, formerly the Brewers Society, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer lost #181m in duty last year while his French counterpart
probably gained #33m of additional duty on beer sold to the UK.
It says in 'A Smuggler's Charter' that when UK beer duty is seven
times that of France it is hardly surprising that British consumers are
flocking across the Channel in search of a bargain. Nor is it surprising
that there are now over 30 cash and carry hypermarkets in Calais alone.
Tesco is only the latest to open there.
Until the British Government takes action to reduce excise duty, pubs,
breweries, off-licences and thousands of jobs are at risk. And it must
start lowering the duty soon, BLRA says.

STEVE Waugh's twenty-sixth Test half-century yesterday put Australia
in sight of the 250-run lead they were seeking on a rain-affected fourth
day of the second Test against the West Indies in St John's, Antigua.
Waugh's patient, unbeaten 52 lifted Australia to 273 for seven in
their second innings and left them 229 ahead by tea.
But a downpour during the interval forced umpires David Shepherd and
Steve Bucknor to call off the rest of the day's play.
Earlier, Waugh's brother, Mark, and David Boon had carried their
third-wicket partnership to 106, the highest of the match, after the
Australians had resumed at 134 for two.
But both were victims of Winston Benjamin in the first hour, Boon
ending the century stand when he failed to offer a shot and was leg
before for 67.
Waugh was bowled by a beautiful yorker for 61 in the fifth over of the
day and Australia had lost two wickets for the addition of only 28 runs.
Steve Waugh was suitably dour, intent on dragging Australia to a
respectable lead.
He lost Greg Blewett at 196 when the youngster played a lazy shot to a
Carl Hooper off-spinner, guiding the ball to Stuart Williams at slip.
But wicketkeeper Ian Healy, who curbed his natural aggression, proved
to be a reliable partner in a 58-run stand for the sixth wicket -- the
pair working hard for every single.
''It was tough and in the context of the game we couldn't afford to
play many shots,'' said Waugh, who faced 130 balls for his runs and at
one stage hit 14 consecutive singles.''

arts with an exciting Easter festival centred in Rouken Glen.
WHEN the new East Renfrewshire unitary council completes the
horsetrading made necessary by the hung result of last week's ballot and
opens for business, it is likely that the future of its predecessor
administration's first substantial venture into the promotion of the
arts will not be top of the first agenda.
But if the new councillors do not get around to committing some
realistic level of resources to the second Artsfeast (tentatively
scheduled for 1997) fairly promptly it will be little short of a
tragedy.
This Easter's inaugural programme cleverly balances accessible
performance -- this weekend's programme includes an SCO fireworks
concert which includes Nessun Dorma and the 1812 Overture and a show by
jazz singer Carol Kidd -- with an adventurous visual arts dimension that
recalls the work done for the 1988 garden festival, which the city of
Glasgow has failed to build upon.
Julia Radcliffe, one of those behind the visual arts content of that
event, has -- on a shoestring budget -- brought 10 projects to Rouken
Glen park, which will be complemented by an exhibition of new painting
at the Gatehouse Gallery in the park (the area's only permanent visual
arts venue), a sound sculpture by Nicky Hinds in the National Trust's
Greenbank Gardens, and extensive work on three of the district's main
roundabouts.
''It has been a discipline for the artists to do something for a
week-long festival. Something that is built to last weeks will probably
last for years,'' says Radcliffe. The project neither called for, nor
could afford a lot of substantial work.
Not that what is currently being put in place in Rouken Glen is in any
way slight. Potential purchasers are welcome and interest has already
been expressed in the piece by the best-known name of the 10 -- David
Mach.
Mach's Lowdown Skunk -- a beast wielding a chainsaw atop a dead tree
-- makes a clear reference to the confrontation in a park just a few
miles up the A77 towards Glasgow with the sculptor's usual sense of
humour, even if it is on a somewhat smaller scale than some of the rest
of his work.
Another piece that will have another life is Michaela Huber's
loveseat, ultimately destined, touchingly, for a sheltered housing
development.
Some artists have been asked to take the size of their work in the
opposite direction from Mach. Lara Scobie usually makes small,
obsessively detailed porcelain objects -- for Rouken Glen she has
adapted her techniques for five-foot high urns.
Silversmith Lynn Park has been working in very experimental way,
making kinetic jewellery to be worn by trees. Both of them are part of a
link with craftspeople that accessed a further #3000 of Scottish Arts
Council funding to add to #6000 from the visual arts budget.
Kenny Hunter's Churchill's Dogs -- a reference to the statesman's name
for his black moods -- are, for Radcliffe, the quintessential pieces of
the show. Easily part of a general popular arts festival, there is a
rigour in the questions about security and the use of the park raised by
their size and posture.
''Artists are very suspicious of suburbia, because they normally
produce work like this for an urban context. But Rouken Glen is an
institution in the city and we are hoping that this arts festival will
draw on that memory of a Glasgow Sunday afternoon out.''
That excursion can include a boating trip, where you may be lucky
enough to hired the lake's new fluorescent yellow boat, fitted with
transparent panels and oars, the better to view Ruth Stirling's
ambitious analysis of the emigration of the Jewish community from
Glasgow, down from 25,000 some 20 years ago to 500 now, many of them
living in the Eastwood area. Bringing together, sculpture, text,
photography and sound, she has used the existing islands and created a
new one and bonded pieces on to concrete so that they float just beneath
the surface of the water.
A visit to the flicks is also on the itinerary, with an inventive work
by Matthew Dalziel and Louise Scullion which projects film of the sea
off Scotland's North-east coast and champion synchronised swimmers on to
a glass screen with a etched circle in the middle. The result is that
the image appears to float in mid air in the park.
Radcliffe's longer-term aim to commission 10 pieces of architecture as
art in 10 city parks as part of the celebrations of architecture and
design in 1999 finds a prototype in Henry McKeown and Ian Alexander's
''meditative sound chamber'', a timber and cellular plastic structure in
a glade at the straightest part of the Auldhouse Burn.
Its #5000 cost was found despite its conception falling firmly between
funders -- the Scottish Arts Council having no direct responsibility for
architecture and architectural trusts not being geared up to cope with
what is ''a folly of sorts''. That gap -- if not addressed -- will
surely have implications for Glasgow's year of glory in 1999.
Radcliffe is, however, full of praise for the support she has had:
''The sponsorship 'in kind' from local businesses is in many respects as
valuable as cash. It forges links and makes the work more accessible,
even if it's only for the people who build it. Engineers and tradesmen
break their backs when they're involved. Bearing in mind the lack of
visual art activity in the area, they have never batted an eyelid at any
of the things I've proposed.''
Eastwood District Council's own investment is #20,000, with the cost
of the work on the Speirsbridge roundabout, and Eastwood and Clarkston
Tolls on top of that, where council labour and expertise has been
particularly important.
''I was determined not to commit any public art crimes by dumping a
piece of sculpture on them -- but some artists are fazed by the really
big opportunity,'' says Radcliffe.
Not so Wendy Hardie, who came to Glasgow to work with architects Page
and Park and created the landscaping around the Royal Infirmary, and
whose design uses a huge block of plants in a very limited palette of
varieties. It is one part of Artsbeast -- as the visual arts side of
Artsfeast has been named -- that will not be at its best this year, but
should be right for the next Eastwood festival.
''I would like there to be some legacy of this year's event in
addition to the roundabouts. There is a sophistication in working in a
community with no single focus and if I do it over again I'd want more
permanent pieces,'' says Radcliffe.
She hopes that the people of Eastwood will share her enthusiasm, and
is refreshingly straightforward about creating public work that will be
seen by a more well-off public.
''This is a gallery-going audience and they are visually aware, I'm
hoping, but until now they've had little on their doorstep.''

A project is underway to relaunch the famous Paisley teardrop pattern
for the international fashion industry. Initial discussions with
designers in Japan and America indicate there will be keen demand to
purchase copyright of the thousands of individual patterns which feature
on a collection of shawls maintained by Paisley Museum.
The idea has been developed by Bob Saunders, Director of Paisley
Museum and Art Galleries and the local enterprise company, Renfrewshire
Enterprise. He believes fashion houses will seize the opportunity to use
authentic Paisley patterns created over 100 years ago, instead of
featuring modern copies.
He says: ''The Japanese and the Americans have already expressed a
keen interest in our project as they believe their customers will much
prefer to buy a garment which carries an official mark showing the
design is an original Paisley pattern.
''The town will once again be associated on a world stage with expert
craftmanship and quality.''
In the 1800s thousands of Paisley buddies were employed as weavers in
the town's mills producing beautifully crafted shawls to be worn by the
likes of Queen Victoria and well dressed women throughout the world.
Tony Cassidy, the chief executive of Renfrewshire Enterprise says:
''We are confident the relaunch of the Paisley pattern will in turn
create new businesses within Paisley to produce and manufacture the
designs. The initial discussions we have had with key players in the
fashion industry, from Tokyo to Milan, indicates the project will
stimulate demand for the product to be made locally.''
To help relaunch the pattern for the 1990s one of Scotland's leading
designers, Joyce Young, the woman behind the successful By Storm label,
has been commissioned by Paisley Museum to produce a Paisley Originals
collection.
She says: ''Most people associate Paisley pattern with strong, dark
colours. In fact some of the earliest designs, those from the 1830s,
were made in lovely, muted tones which I believe are more suited to the
type of clothes people are wearing in the 1990s.''
Her Paisley Originals will be unveiled to the world's fashion press at
the Clothes Show Exhibition hosted by Glasgow for the first time, at the
SECC from the 17-20 June. Several Japanese buyers are expected to fly in
for the event.

<HEADLINE>Billionaire Kerkorian makes his move.    $20bn bid for Chrysler rocks Wall St</HEADLINE>

New York, Wednesday --
Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian shocked Detroit and Wall Street,
offering more than $20bn for Chrysler in what would be the
second-largest takeover in US corporate history.
The offer of $55 a share from Kerkorian's Tracinda Corporation, which
already owns 10% of America's number three car maker, was a 40% premium
to Chrysler's closing stock price on Tuesday and valued it at $22.8bn.
A Chrysler takeover would be second only to the $25bn buyout of RJR
Nabisco by Wall Street specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 1989.
Chrysler said its board and legal and financial advisers would review
the bid, but said that Tracinda had no financing commitments to complete
the deal and had no investment banking adviser. It also said it had not
received a formal offer, but added that Tracinda said it would send a
letter proposing a negotiated transaction.
Tracinda, the former owner of the MGM Grand Air luxury airline and a
developer of Las Vegas casino hotels, said former Chrysler chairman Lee
Iacocca would join as a substantial investor but would take no
management role.
The group is ready to pay $55 a share for the Chrysler stock it does
not own. The shares soared $10.375 to $49.50 in New York. Based on
Chrysler's 415 million outstanding shares, the offer values the
automaker at $22.8bn.
Chrysler vice-president AC Liebler said at the New York Motor Show
that Chrysler chairman Robert Eaton, who was scheduled to speak at the
show, would not appear as he was dealing with the Tracinda proposal.
''As Chrysler's largest shareholder, our goal over the last five years
has been to seek to enhance value for all Chrysler shareholders,''
Tracinda executive Alex Yemenidjian said in a statement announcing the
offer.
''We continue to believe that Chrysler's board of directors and Bob
Eaton and his management team have done an excellent job of managing the
company's operations. However, despite the efforts of Chrysler's board
and management to enhance the market value of the company, the market
continues to undervalue Chrysler stock.''
Mr Yemenidjian said Tracinda foresees no fundamental changes in
Chrysler, its business prospects or its management. He added that a
buy-out would not be a highly leveraged transaction.
''This is not a leveraged buy-out, where assets need to be sold to
help finance the transaction,'' he said. ''The buyers are principals who
are investing their own money.''
Mr Kerkorian's offer was greeted with scepticism on Wall Street, where
experts said Chrysler was worth more than $55 a share.
''If you want to work through the fundamental analysis and look at the
kind of multiple that this company deserves -- looking at its total
financial footings -- it's worth more than $55 in the longer term as a
going concern,'' said Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi.
A Wall Street arbitrager said one of the biggest holes in the offer
was its failure to give any details of how it would be financed. ''This
is clearly just an attempt to put a little pressure on Chrysler to buy
back Kerkorian's shares,'' he said.
Multibillionaire Kirk Kerkorian's $22.8bn offer is the culmination of
an investment that began in 1990, when the car giant's shares were
trading at just $12.
Kerkorian gradually increased his stake, becoming Chrysler's largest
shareholder. In January, Kerkorian paid between $46 to $50 a share for 4
million additional shares, putting his stake at 10.16%.
The 77-year-old tycoon, whose personal fortune has been estimated at
more than $3000m, made his money as the one-time owner of the MGM film
studio. He is the majority owner of MGM Grand, the biggest gaming-hotel
company in Las Vegas, and owns a small stake in Viacom, an entertainment
conglomerate that owns the Paramount film studeo.

FURTHER evidence emerged yesterday that the rate at which unemployment
is declining has slowed down since the sharp falls recorded in the final
quarter of last year.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment dropped by 20,500 last month to
2,346,200, equivalent to 8.4% of the workforce.
It was the third month in a row when unemployment fell by less than
30,000. The average monthly decline in the first quarter of this year
was 24,100, almost half the 47,900 monthly drop between October and
December last year.
James Capel's Adam Cole said that the anomalous period seemed to be
the fourth quarter of last year when the rate of decline in unemployment
accelerated markedly, despite a decline in the pace of growth in
activity.
In the first three months of last year unemployment fell by an average
of 19,400 a month. This rose to 25,500 in the second quarter and 27,700
in the third. The latest figures are more in line with those for the
first nine months of last year.
Cole added, ''The rate of decline in unemployment is consistent with
above trend growth in GDP, although the first quarter will probably see
a temporary pause.''
The unemployment figures were slightly disappointing, but the average
earnings data for February were bang in line with City expectations.
For the second month in a row average earnings growth came in at 3.5%
after seven months when it was stuck on 3.75%.
The recent decline in the average earnings rate is something of a
statistical freak. Pay increases are continuing to pick up, but bonuses
are lower than in the first quarter of last year when large payments in
the financial services sector distorted the picture.
Average earnings figures are expected to remain weak in March, but
thereafter a sharp pick-up is expected with the growth rate jumping to
4% in April. Capel is forecasting 5% by the end of the year.
Despite the slowdown in average earnings growth this year unit labour
costs have accelerated strongly reflecting a drop in productivity.
In the year to the end of February manufacturing unit labour costs
rose by 2.5%, an acceleration from January's 1.6%.

THE SUCCESS of Glasgow's Hilton hotel is putting pressure on the
city's other top hoteliers, with Forte claiming that its Crest (the
former Albany) and Carrick hotels were suffering from excess capacity in
the market.
The Hilton is achieving an occupancy rate of 70%, against 62% a year
ago, while its room rates have also increased and are #10 above
competitors' rates, claimed John Dobbs, UK divisional director of Hilton
International, which is owned by the Ladbroke gaming group.
''We have the only five-star hotel in Glasgow and the other top hotels
in the city just cannot compete with us. Our success is down to having
the right product and we are very confident our better performance will
continue. Our forward bookings are very strong,'' he said.
Sir Rocco Forte, chairman of the group which bears his name,
maintained that Glasgow had a little too much capacity which had pushed
down room rates of their hotels in the city. Sir Rocco was speaking on
publication of the group's results which show a sharp recovery in
profits.
Capacity in Glasgow was increased before the recession with the
opening of the Queens Moat hotel adjacent to the Exhibition Centre.
The 319-roomed Hilton opened in November 1992 when the recession was
hitting the market. The hotel is pitched at the top business traveller
and a single room costs #115 a night, though there are various discounts
available.
Mr Dobbs said business people accounted for up to three-quarters of
the hotel's customers, attracted partly by its conference facilities.
Hilton had decided to build a new #40m hotel in Glasgow because it
wanted to benefit from the city's continuing revival and its improved
communications links which business people depend on.
A Forte spokesman observed that the Glasgow market was starting to
improve and he was confident the capacity would be absorbed in due
course. The Glasgow Airport Crest performed better and is in the middle
of a #3m refurbishment which will include extensive sound-proofing.
Forte says its Edinburgh hotels are doing well, with the flagship
Balmoral returning to profit. The group only manages this hotel, which
is actually owned by the Bank of Scotland following the collapse of the
previous owner.
The three-star Posthouse hotels are trading strongly, particularly the
120-roomed Edinburgh unit which was the 66-strong chain's top performer.

IT is quite amazing what a taste, or even a glimpse, of success can do
for a footballer.
Yesterday the three goal-scorers in Celtic's comprehensive Scottish
Cup semi-final victory over Hibs spoke of their futures with the club --
and all doubts over two of them were swept away in the euphoria which
followed the Ibrox victory.
Midfielder John Collins dismissed suggestions that he could be ready
to leave the club he joined five years ago. Earlier in the season it
seemed that Collins, dogged by disappointment after disappointment,
could be ready to quit the Glasgow side.
But less than 24 hours after that stunning goal against Hibs Collins
insisted: ''I have another year of my contract remaining and as far as I
am concerned I want to stay. Obviously, I came here to win trophies and
that has not happened yet, and so I have been disappointed.
''But we have a chance to change things, and the way we have been
playing lately suggests that we can now win the Scottish Cup. That would
mean a lot to me. If the manager says something different then that is
up to him. I can't do anything about that.
''But right now I don't want to leave. I came here looking for success
and maybe now is the time to get that. It is an exciting thought that if
we win the cup we will be in Europe and we will be playing at Parkhead
in a new stadium.''
Striker Willie Falconer, linked with moves away from Celtic, was on
the same wavelength as he looked back towards his opening goal against
Hibs.
''The first goal is always very important in a semi-final,'' he
maintained. ''I think it helped take the pressure off the team.
''There was a time when I thought I would be leaving. When a new
manager comes in, then players signed by a previous manager are often on
the way out. I thought that might happen to me. But, here I am, and I
want to play in that final.''
Falconer was in the team as a replacement for injured Dutchman Pierre
van Hooydonk, but after the game Burns said that he had played his best
ever match for the Glasgow club.
Falconer admitted: ''The manager is probably right. I do think it's
the best I have played, and I enjoyed it. I am very happy here and I
don't want to go anywhere else. I'm ready to fight for my place. If I
didn't have that attitude then I would not last very long at this club.
I want to help this team win the Scottish Cup.''
As for Phil O'Donnell, whose third goal clinched the place in the
final, he is the only one of the scorers who can boast a Scottish Cup
winner's medal. He won that playing with Motherwell and now he wants to
add to his collection.
He admits: ''There has been more pressure here than I ever knew at
Motherwell. Other teams lift their game when they come to play Celtic
and I have had to adjust to that.
''Now I hope I can do enough to get a permanent place in the team and
help Celtic win the Cup. I had to sit out the Coca-Cola Cup games
because I was cup-tied with Motherwell, so this tournament means a lot
to me.''

KIRSTY Hay and her Scottish women's team kept their semi-final hopes
alive in Brandon, Manitoba, yesterday with a 7-4 victory over
Switzerland.
At the same time, Scottish hopes were further increased by results on
the adjacent rinks, where Denmark beat the USA, and Norway defeated
Germany after an extra end.
Hay's team made a good start, following up a single in the first end
with a single steal at the second.
However, the Swiss hung on until the ninth end, when Hay delivered the
match-winning blow.
Good early play put Scottish stones on both sides of the house and
eventually, with the last stone of the end, Hay faced one Swiss and two
Scottish stones nestling in the four-foot ring. Her delicately weighted
shot removed the Swiss stone and there was an added bonus when her
shooter came to rest biting the 12-foot ring.
They now face Sweden and the USA in their remaining games. While
victory in both matches is essential, the Scots still need other results
to go their way if they are to reach a semi-final play-off.
Meanwhile, the Scottish men went down 8-5 to Sweden with all the
damage being done in the first two ends.
Later, the men lost their seventh-round game against Canada by 8-3 and
they, too, face strong pressure in their last two games -- against
Switzerland and England -- if they are to make the semi-finals. Results:
MEN: Sixth round -- Wales 5, USA 10; Scotland 5, Sweden 8; Australia
5, Canada 10; Switzerland 5, Norway 9; Germany 6, England 9.
Seventh round -- Canada 8, Scotland 3; Wales 2, Germany 7; USA 7,
Switzerland 3; England 6, Australia 4; Sweden 10, Norway 3.
Standings -- Canada won 7, lost 0; Germany 5-2; Scotland 4-3; USA 4-3;
Australia 3-4; Norway 3-4; Sweden 3-4; Switzerland 3-4; England 2-5;
Wales 1-6.
WOMEN: Seventh round -- France 1, Sweden 11; USA 4, Denmark 7;
Switzerland 4, Scotland 7; Japan 2, Canada 5, Norway 5, Germany 4 (extra
end).
Standings: Canada won 7, lost 0; Norway 7-0; Sweden 5-2; Germany 4-3;
Scotland 3-4; USA 3-4; Denmark 2-5; Japan 2-5; Switzerland 2-5; France
0-7.

STEVE Waugh's twenty-sixth Test half-century yesterday put Australia
in sight of the 250-run lead they were seeking on a rain-affected fourth
day of the second Test against the West Indies in St John's, Antigua.
Waugh's patient, unbeaten 52 lifted Australia to 273 for seven in
their second innings and left them 229 ahead by tea.
But a downpour during the interval forced umpires David Shepherd and
Steve Bucknor to call off the rest of the day's play.
Earlier, Waugh's brother, Mark, and David Boon had carried their
third-wicket partnership to 106, the highest of the match, after the
Australians had resumed at 134 for two.
But both were victims of Winston Benjamin in the first hour, Boon
ending the century stand when he failed to offer a shot and was leg
before for 67.
Waugh was bowled by a beautiful yorker for 61 in the fifth over of the
day and Australia had lost two wickets for the addition of only 28 runs.
Steve Waugh was suitably dour, intent on dragging Australia to a
respectable lead.
He lost Greg Blewett at 196 when the youngster played a lazy shot to a
Carl Hooper off-spinner, guiding the ball to Stuart Williams at slip.
But wicketkeeper Ian Healy, who curbed his natural aggression, proved
to be a reliable partner in a 58-run stand for the sixth wicket -- the
pair working hard for every single.
''It was tough and in the context of the game we could not afford to
play many shots,'' said Waugh, who faced 130 balls for his runs and at
one stage hit 14 consecutive singles.

A GROUP of youngsters this week made a big push for rugby (right) at
St Ambrose High School, Coatbridge, during one of a series of Scottish
Life Young Scotland Rugby Squad World Cup Coaching Clinics.
Clinics have also been held at Aberdeen, Hawick, and Glasgow, and next
month it will be the turn of Dumfries and Inverness.
Jim Hay, squad co-ordinator, said: ''The clinics give young players
the chance to develop their rugby sills in a fun environment and,
perhaps, take their first steps to ultimate fame in the world of
rugby.''

LIZ McColgan's plan for frequent short road and track races to
recapture her pace will almost certainly lead to a revival of clashes
with her Scottish arch rival, Yvonne Murray, this summer.
Murray, who picked up the mantle of Commonwealth 10,000 metres
champion which McColgan had worn for the previous eight years, is set to
make her first outing in a 5000-metre road event at Portsmouth in May,
confirms coach Tom Boyle.
McColgan, currently in Florida for post-marathon treatment from the
therapist who saved her career, is working towards the 10,000m at the
World track championships in Gothenburg this summer. But not having
raced on the track since 1992, she needs a qualifying time. She must
prove herself all over again, with no favours from selectors.
Murray also wishes to run the World championship 10,000m, which would
be the pair's first meeting at that track distance, but the Portsmouth
road 5000m looks like the venue for the first of many clashes.
''I would be happy to do the 10,000m in the Europa Cup for Britain,''
says McColgan, ''but have not raced that distance on the track since the
Barcelona Olympics. I realise Yvonne is the UK first choice now, and if
she wants to do that at the Europa Cup, she has first claim on it.
''But if she does not want it, and I can convince the selectors I am
fit without racing a 10k on the track, then I would love to do the
Europa Cup final.''
Boyle indicated that McColgan's offer would sit well with Murray's
plans. ''Yvonne does not wish to run a 10,000 before the World
championships,'' says Boyle. ''She hopes to be selected on the basis of
her Commonwealth gold and her form over shorter distances this summer.
It would probably suit Yvonne to do the 5000 metres in the Europa Cup.''
A feast of racing between the pair could be in store -- stark contrast
to the reign of Coe and Ovett, who studiously avoided each other during
their prime. But McColgan and Murray recall that their best 1500m
performances came when racing each other in Oslo.
Each loves racing the other, and though Murray's too-close attention
has in the past annoyed McColgan, there will be no shirking one another.
* A REVOLUTIONARY series of races, with prize money paid in US
dollars, is being planned for Northumberland next month. A group of
athletes, male and female, will compete on a different surface on each
of six successive days from May 3 to 8 with some $52,000 at stake.
There will be prize money each day, ranging from $500 for victory,
down to $50 for tenth, for both sexes. Points will be awarded for each
place, and the overall winners will pocket a further $5000 in addition
to their individual race earnings, with $3000 for second and $2000 for
third, down to $400 for tenth.
The series will begin with a 5000m track race, followed on successive
days by contests on road (4 miles), forest track (6 miles),
cross-country (5 miles), hill (4 miles), and road (4 miles). The last
event will be at Warkworth, venue for one of the Northumberland Castle
series of races which this new event is replacing.
Entry is by invitation only, but the identity of contestants is as yet
unknown.

A PROPOSAL to limit numbers of non-English players in rugby south of
the Border has upset a number of league clubs.
The RU are debating the feasibility of a rule change which will force
first division clubs to field predominantly English teams, but Frank
Gibbon, chairman of the Senior Clubs' Association, has written to RU
secretary Dudley Wood expressing his concern and is anxious to prevent
changes being rushed through before next season.
Gibbon said: ''I would like the RU committee to know of the deep
resentment clubs feel in being told what players they may or may not
pick and what clubs those players may or may not join -- for that is the
effect of the proposals.''
Reigning champions Bath currently have four Scottish internationalists
and an Irish internationalist in their first-team squad, while West
Hartlepool are also intending to expand their batch of Scots next term.
One idea being examined is to limit clubs to only two players who are
not eligible to play for England next season, with that number being
reduced to one in 1996.
But Gibbon added: ''The clubs need more time to discuss the proposals.
Why is there this indecent haste to bring these regulations into effect?
We have lived perfectly happily with these players in our clubs and in
our competitions until now.''

DEREK DOUGLAS in Bucharest
Scotland Under-19 3, Argentina Under-19 43
SCOTLAND travelled to Romania for their first appearance in the FIRA
Junior World Cup on a voyage of discovery.
On Tuesday, they came face to face with a rabid Russian bear, yet
still managed to win. Yesterday, at the Steaua Ground in Bucharest, the
Pumas of Argentina proved to be too sleek, too strong and too
technically proficient for the young Scots.
They were handed a salutary lesson in what it takes to bridge the
yawning chasm between schoolboy rugby and that which manager David Sole
-- who said that their performance had been at times spineless -- has
maintained from the outset is played in the real, grown-up world.
The young Scots played well in patches, but were invariably on the
back foot, made too many unforced errors and took too many wrong options
to give themselves any chance of scoring a half-decent result.
Scotland did not do themselves justice and the downcast mood within
the Scottish camp merely underlined the fact that they know it.
They conceded five goals, a try, and a penalty, two of the tries being
soft in the extreme. They had, however, done enough in the first half
still to be hanging on in there at 7-3. Scotland's only points came from
a seventeenth-minute penalty goal by Watsonian's Graeme Hay.
The crucial psychological moment came less than a minute after the
interval, when Scotland were still by no means out of it.
The Argentinian re-start kick did not appear to have crossed the
10-metre line. The Scots paused momentarily and, in a flash, the
Argentinians were deep within Scottish territory. From the scrum which
followed Hay fumbled on his own line and Juan Frugoli pounced for the
try. Nicoles Gomez converted and the Argentinians had doubled their
lead.
Thereafter, Scotland buckled under intense Argentinian pressure, the
brawny South American pack rumbling down the park like a runaway
dump-truck.
Later, Sole did not spare the rod. Perhaps harshly, and in the
immediate aftermath of a crushing defeat, he said that the Scottish
performance had been, at times, spineless.
''The boys didn't do themselves justice. They were playing against a
bigger side, but that is nothing new for Scotland. We have been doing
that for years. That does not stop you tackling or winning the ball or
winning matches,'' he said.
Coach Alastair Christie added: ''Argentina were a useful side, but we
made their job easy. We could have put in a lot more first-time
tackles.''
Christie did not think that the rough-house game against Russia just
24 hours before had taken its toll on the Scots. ''We just made a lot of
unforced errors,'' he said.
Scotland were under extreme pressure in the scrummage despite Chris
Docherty nicking one against the head first time down. And in the loose,
too, the Scots invariably produced slow ruck-ball or lost possession in
the tackle.
Graeme Beveridge, the Peebles scrum half, beavered away and Geoff
Caldwell, who came on for Danny Bull, had a couple of testing runs, but
more often than not the ball carrier was isolated and possession would
be lost in the turnover.
All in all, a bad day in Bucharest for young Scotland, who now play
Spain tomorrow.
Romania, who beat Wales 22-15 on Tuesday but who drew with France and
have the same pool points classification as the French side, have been
placed in second position in their pool as punishment for a couple of
biting incidents in the game against the Welsh.
Scotland Under-19 -- S Tomlinson (Selkirk); A McLean (Boroughmuir), A
Bulloch (Hutchieson GS), R Kennedy (Stirling County), D Bull (Stewart's
Melville FP); G Hay (Watsonians), G Beveridge (Peebles); M Smith
(Watsonians), C Docherty (GHK), G Lambie (Edinburgh Wanderers), C Hunter
(Currie), I Fullerton (Kelso), S Murray (Edinburgh Academicals), I
Sinclair (Dundee HS FP), S McNeill (Ross High). Replacements -- J Kelly
(Harlequins) for Lambie, G Caldwell (Ayr) for Bull (39min).
Referee -- G Morandin (Italy).
Other results
South Africa 36, Spain 14; Italy 14, Uruguay 0; France 36, Wales 10.
Pool placings: Pool A -- 1, South Africa; 2, Spain; 3, Polland. Pool B

POINT-TO-POINT
THE current leaders of the Northern Area point-to-point championships,
Kevin Anderson and Pauline Robson, will clash in the confined race at
Morpeth on Monday.
At the Dumfriesshire meeting last Tuesday, Robson won the Antartex
confined race on Sharp Opinion with Anderson third on Border Folly.
Robson also came out top rider at the meeting with four winners to
Anderson's two.
On Monday, Anderson will again partner Border Folly and Robson will
ride No Joker, an easy winner at Friars Haugh on Sunday. Border Folly
looked as if he needed the race at Lockerbie and should win this time.
Robson is well clear in the women's championship with 42 points, a
lead of 26 over Kirsty Barnett.
Anderson, who drew a blank at the Jedforest meeting on Sunday, is on
43 points, five ahead of Andrew Parker, who won a maiden race on
Staxigoe for Miss Helen Hamilton of Peaty Sandy fame.
With two meetings to chose from over Easter Anderson has decided to
concentrate on Morpeth, where he will have three rides, including Jimmy
River, while Parker favours the Percy meeting at Alnwick on Saturday,
where he has King Spring in the confined and Qualitair Son in the
maiden.
An interesting innovation at this meeting is the combining of the
men's and women's open in one race. Among the 30 entries for this
four-mile test of stamina are Generals Boy, Sharp Opinion, Ready Steady,
Buckle it Up, and Mr Diplomatic, who have all won recently.
* CELTIC Swing will make his eagerly-anticipated reappearance in the
Greenham Stakes at Newbury a week on Saturday.
The colt, favourite for the 2000 Guineas and Derby, will have his
warm-up in the classic trial because he gets into the race without a
Group One penalty.

MIKE Ware remembers his first visit to the spiritual home of ice
hockey for all the wrong reasons.
Cardiff Devils humiliated Edinburgh Racers before a capacity 10,000
crowd at Wembley Arena in the 1993 British championship semi-finals, and
on Saturday, the 6ft 5in, 16-stone powerhouse makes a return trip to
Wembley determined to exorcise the memory of that 9-0 defeat.
This time it is Nottingham Panthers who provide the semi-final
opposition -- and they defeated the Racers 25-11 over two legs in the
Benson &amp; Hedges Cup semi-final earlier this year.
Ware said: ''We were clobbered 19-2 at Nottingham and it hurt, but we
showed our character by bouncing back 24 hours later to beat them 9-6 on
our own pond.''
Defending champions Cardiff Devils, or newly-crowned Premier Division
champions Sheffield Steelers await the winners on Sunday.
The former Edmonton Oiler, who was in the 1990 Stanley Cup winning
squad, but was one of four players who did not see action, has battled
back from career-threatening cruciate ligament damage to help Racers
climb back to the top.
If Scotland's last hopes do claim the silverware it will be Racers
first triumph at Wembley since 1986, when they beat the now defunct
Dundee Rockets 4-2 with teenager Tony Hand, now the club's captain,
scoring the winner.

JIM Farmer will travel from his St Andrews home to Royal Aberdeen
today to fulfill his role as one of the Scottish Golf Union's area
coaches. He perhaps would be advised to take a look at son Jamie in a
professional capacity.
The 5ft 5ins tall 13-year-old started the week as the youngest
competitor in the 256-strong field, but while strapping six-foot-tall,
moustache-bearing hulks have fallen, lemming-like, by the wayside, the
pocket dynamo keeps on going.
Two fine wins yesterday put the Madras College pupil into the last 32
and, as he admitted, even though he should go no further today, he still
has another five years left to try and get to the final. ''I thought I
might get through the first round, but I didn't think I'd get this
far,'' he said.
His lack of distance from the tee is more than compensated by deadly
iron play, especially around the greens, which led the onlooking Paul
Lawrie -- taking a break from the European Tour to await the birth of
his first child -- to admit: ''I wish I had a short game like that.''
Meanwhile, at the other end of the age spectrum, defending champion
Steven Young resumed normal service with an 8 and 7 win over Ross
Fleming of Hawick, after his scare of having been taken to the
seventeenth green in Tuesday's second round.
The Inverallochy 18-year-old settled himself down by winning the first
four holes in par and he never looked back. Highlight of the round was a
second consecutive eagle 3 at the 486-yard sixth, the hole conquered via
a drive, No.6 iron, and 10-foot putt.
Young looks odds-on for a quarter-final clash with his Scottish
team-mate Grant Campbell, of Airdrie, who brushed aside Borderer Norman
Burns by 7 and 6.
''It helps having the other international team members around because
you concentrate more, not wanting to be the one who drops out first,''
said Grant.
Campbell's words had a sadly prophetic ring for Downfield's Paul
Cunningham, who became exactly that an hour later at the hands of
Lundin's Stewart Whiteford, the Fifer winning 3 and 1.
Elsewhere in the draw, another Fifer Brian Mason -- who is 17 today --
gave himself the ideal early birthday present with a stunning 9 and 8
win over David Connolly, of West Kilbride, the biggest win of the
tournament to date.
But yesterday signalled the end of the Gallacher challenge for the
title, Bernard's son Jamie falling 4 and 3 to Kirkcaldy's Mark
Donaldson, whose forceful play gave an indication of why he was a part
of the recent Scotland Boys B squad coaching session at Inverclyde.
* RALSTON'S Alastair Forsyth and East Kilbride's Craig Heap represent
Scotland in the French Junior Nations Cup at Saint-Nom-La-Breteche which
gets underway today with the first qualifying stroke-play round. Only 32
leading qualifiers progress to the match-play stages after 36-holes.
* AYRSHIRE Ladies County Golf Champisonship was won yesterday at Troon
Portland by Rosalyn Kennedy (Troon Ladies), who beat Alison Gemmill
(Kilmarnock Barassie) by 1 hole in teh 18-hole final.
Gemmill was three up after six holes, but Kennedy wiped out that
deficit by the twelfth and went ahead. Gemmill then got a 2 at the
fourteenth to square the match, but Kennedy finished with two pars to
win on the last green.
Semi-finals: Gemmill beat C Malcolm (Prestwick St Cuthbert), 2 and 1;
Kennedy beat M Wilson (Girvan), 2 and 1.
* RESULTS of Renfrewshire Ladies Meeting, at Erskine:

WHEN the chairman of the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland,
David Webster, made a surprisingly outspoken attack in Victoria last
August on the 'Old Boys' Club' which was running the sport, he was
referring to the Games Federation, for which he had stood unsuccessfully
for election.
His remarks could equally have applied to the body of which he is
chairman and of which the annual general meeting takes place in
Edinburgh tonight.
Webster has instigated a management review of the council's activities
which may have far-reaching implications for the roles of long-serving
amateur officials. But the report, which is part of a #24,000 package
agreed with the Scottish Sports Council, is being prepared by an
independent consultant, and will not be available until the summer.
A former director of recreation for Cunninghame District, Webster, a
prominent weightlifting official who also gained a reputation for the
promotion of traditional Highland Games, has brought a welcome wind of
change to the dusty corridors of the Scottish Games Council. But he is
concerned that he will not be allowed to see the process through.
He is being opposed for the chair by the current vice-chairman, Colin
McEachran, an Edinburgh advocate who won a shooting silver medal in full
bore in Christchurch in 1974.
''I've worked hard to promote open government, but I still feel
there's a lot to be done,'' said Webster, who is willing to eschew the
customary right of chairman to the position of overall Scottish team
manager in Malaysia next time if he is re-elected for another four
years.
''I'd like to see things through, but I genuinely want the best for
the Scottish team -- that's why I'd put my own position on the line so
that we can get the best manager. It should not be the case of chairmen
becoming team managers.''
Webster also deplores the politicking which has been going on for the
various elections to the council. ''Lobbying is for party politics and
should have no place in sport,'' he said naively.
McEachran insists he is not opposing Webster on any kind of joint
ticket. ''There's no package, there's just people wanting to come
forward and help -- that's healthy,'' he said. ''I'm slightly perturbed
that David is standing again when it's traditionally a four-year
stint,'' he adds.
McEachran's sport, shooting, have given their support to the
nomination of another veteran official, George Hunter, the secretary for
the last 16 years and a council member for 26 years.
Hunter, who claims the support of athletics, badminton, men's bowling,
shooting and his own sport rowing, faces a contest for the secretaryship
from Louise Martin from gymnastics.
One man seem certain to survive another night of the long knives.
Stewart Coghill, the treasurer, is unopposed.

KINGS Links professional David Thomson led the Scottish contingent in
the first ever professional golf tournament to be staged in China,
finishing in joint thirty-fourth position in the Volvo Open at the
Shenzhen Golf Club in demanding conditions.
With humidity at 95%, it was China's top-ranked professional Zhang
Lian Wei who triumphed with a one-under-par, two-round aggregate of 143,
providing a fitting start to the paid game in the country.
The four-strong Scottish squad competing fared badly, however,
struggling in high temperatures and on grainy greens.
Out of a field of 109, comprising 14 countries, Simon Yates was tied
with Garry Harvey, of Grangemouth, in forty-fourth position on 155, two
behind Thomson, and just outside the top-50 was Easter Moffat's Brian
Dunbar on 163.
Dunbar had been winner of the Volvo charity pro-am with his three
Chinese partners and round in an excellent two-under-par, but collapsed
in the heat to an opening 84.
* STEPHANIE Hewit, of Liberton, won the gold medal at the LGU medal
finals yesterday at Cawder. Details:
Gold medal: 76 -- S Hewit (Liberton, 10). 77 -- K Burns (Clydebank and
District, 4). 78 -- F Glass (Buchanan Castle, 13). Silver medal: 71 -- S
Warwick (Dumfries and County, 24). 72 -- C Auld (Kilmarnock Barassie,

ALLY Donaldson, the Currie stand-off and captain, will lead Edinburgh
for the first time when the district team take on a Dumfries XV in the
Octocentenary Cup match at Park Farm on Monday (3pm).
None of Edinburgh's six World Cup squad could be included, but it is a
team mainly well versed in district rugby. Six of Scotlands Zimbabwe
tour squad will be playing, and Campbell Aitken, Heriot's full back,
will be the only newcomer to senior district rugby.
North and Midlands are already preparing for their match against
Western Samoa in November with a series of games for an A team this
month. It started with a 27-25 win over East Lothian on Monday at
Kirkcaldy, and it continues with a match against the Glasgow Development
XV at Stirling on Wednesday (7pm).
These matches are an opportunity for the North and Midlands selectors
to look around for players who could justify being called into the
district team to meet the Pacific islanders. The selectors appreciate
that they may have to dig deep into limited resources as they expect to
be short of full strength against the Samoans, with that match falling
in the midweek between the Scotland A teams match against the tourists
and the Murrayfield international.
In continuing their search after the narow win on Monday the selectors
have made six changes in personnel for the Stirling match. Not even the
impressive showing by Stuart Hannah, the Dunfermline No.8, was enough
cause for the selectors to deviate from their plan to spread the net.
Martin Waite, Edinburgh Academicals No.8, will take over from Hannah.
Three Scotland under-21 caps, Bryan Easson, Alan Featherstone, and
Stuart Grimes, also have been called in, as have Stewart Morman, the
Dunfermline wing, and Alex Carruthers, Kirkcaldy's experienced district
centre.
Mark McKenzie, Stirling County's stand-off, and Stuart Simmers,
Glasgow Academicals captain, are being tried out in a new half-back
partnership in the Glasgow Development XV. John Shaw, the West of
Scotland wing forward, also has been called in, but the 12 others in the
team played for at least part of the game in which Glasgow beat Dumfries
and Galloway at Castle Douglas on Tuesday night. Teams:
Edinburgh (v Dumfries XV, Park Farm, Monday, 3.0) -- C Aitken; H
Gilmour, G Lawrie (all Heriot's FP), P Flockhart (Stewart's Melville
FP), D Stark (Boroughmuir); A Donaldson (Currie), captain, G Burns
(Stewart's Melville FP); G Wilson (Boroughmuir), P Haslett (Edinburgh
Academicals), S Paul (Heriot's FP), D G Burns, P T Jennings, G J
Drummond (all Boroughmuir), B Ward (Currie), G Dall (Heriot's FP).
Replacements -- D Macrae (Boroughmuir), J Kerr (Watsonians), F MacMillan
(Musselburgh), T McVie (Edinburgh Academicals), R McNulty (Stewart's
Melville FP), G Ellis (Currie).
Glasgow Development XV (v North and Midlands A, Bridgehaugh, 7.0) -- G
M Breckenridge (GHK), captain; M Craig (West of Scotland), C Sangster
(Stirling), H Bassi, G Hawkes (both GHK); M McKenzie (Stirling County),

McIlwham, D Mellor (both GHK), G Perrett (West of Scotland), M Norval
(Stirling County), S Simcox (Clarkston), J Shaw (West of Scotland).
Replacements -- J Adams (Kilmarnock), D Robertson (Clarkston), A Hogarth
(West of Scotland), K Pattie (Kilmarnock), E Logan (Ayr), A Mason
(Glasgow Academicals).
North and Midlands A -- J Mitchell; N Renton, A Carruthers (all
Kirkcaldy), R MacFarlane (Dundee HS FP), S Morman (Dunfermline); B
Easson (Boroughmuir), A Featherstone (Morgan Academy FP); W Anderson
(Kirkcaldy), G Scott (Dundee HS FP), A Penman, J Norval (both

Waite (Edinburgh Academicals), A Henderson (Kirkcaldy), captain.
Replacements -- C Maguire (Aberdeen GS FP), G Tosh (Dundee HS FP), M
Thomson (Edinburgh Wanderers), J Whyte (Perthshire), A Black
(Kirkcaldy).
* EXPERIMENTAL laws will be tried out in a match between teams drawn
from the North and South of Glasgow at Braidholm a week tomorrow. It is
the second successive year that the fixture, part of Clarkston's annual
rugby festival, has been utilised as a test-bed, though the Scottish
Rugby Union have yet to define which law variations will go on trial.
The North v South match will open the festival, which last until the
end of the month, with competition for all ages and interests. Festival
programme:
April 19 -- Glasgow North v Glasgow South; 21 -- South Clyde sevens;
22 -- Under-19 tournament; 23 -- Mini-rugby tournament; 26 -- Presidents
School XV v Clarkston Under-19; 28 -- Womens tens; 29 -- S1 and S2 midi
tournament; 30 -- S3 and under-16 midi tournament.
* GARNOCK, the club without a home, are the McEwan's 70/- Club of the
Month for March.
The Ayrshire side have won Division 7 of the National League with a

AUSTRALIAN calls for rugby union to become professional intensified
yesterday with New South Wales and Queensland Rugby unions calling on
the Australian Rugby Football Union to admit the sport is no longer
amateur.
Both state bodies issued statements calling on their national union to
convey this message to the International Rugby Board (IRB).
The IRB has been reluctant to change the laws on amateurism, despite
widespread evidence that players in many countries receive financial
benefits from playing.
New South Wales rugby chairman Ian Ferrier said it was obvious to the
most casual of observers that rugby was no longer amateur. ''Amateurism
as a concept is outmoded and should be dispensed with in the modern
game,'' he said.
The risk of Australian rugby union's best players being lured across
to media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's rebel Super League prompted the unions'
formal stand.
Australian lock Rod McCall called yesterday for pay-for-play contracts
to stop defections to Super League, which centre Jason Little said had
accelerated rugby's inevitable professionalism.
Over the past week Murdoch's Australian subsidiary, News Limited, has
engaged in a bitter bidding war to entice top rugby league players away
from the established Australian Rugby League to its Super League, which
it hopes to kick-off in 1997.

We're all being positive as can be -- but as for preparing for the
worst -- I don't know where to start
A telephone call takes Frances Campbell on a mission to give her
sister at least hope of survival.
WHEN my sister phoned last Easter, I said: ''I had been expecting the
call.'' I had two sisters living in Australia and it was in the nature
of things that bad news would one day come from there.
''Leukaemia,'' said Ann. ''My only chance is a bone marrow
transplant.''
''And the success rate?''
''Sixty per cent''.
But even that depended on finding a suitable donor. ''There's a one in
four chance of siblings being compatible,'' said Ann. She considered
herself lucky, at 44, being the eldest of five. And her disease was
chronic so she didn't need the transplant for a year.
We siblings went for blood tests and one by one the results came
through. Jean, in Perth, Australia, was out. Colin and Ewan in Glasgow
were incompatible too. Then Ann phoned one night. ''You're a match,''
she said, and we breathed deep with relief.
The transplant was pencilled in for Easter '95.
''Will you have to fly over?'' my husband said.
''I don't know. The doctors here can freeze my marrow and send it
across. But I'd like to see Ann.''
Then in October Ann rang again. ''They need to bring the transplant
forward. Can you come in a month? The government will pay your fare.''
''How long do you want me for?''
Her voice grew anxious: ''I have to live in hospital accommodation for
100 days. It would be good if you could look after me.''
A hundred days -- for a life. How could I refuse? And I'd never been
to Oz before.
Ann looked surprisingly well when she met me off the plane in
Queensland. I hadn't seen her for four years but, despite the reason for
my visit, we slipped back into gear as if it were yesterday.
Next afternoon her husband, Chris, took me upriver on his boat.
Pelicans floated feet away, mangroves grew along the banks and in the
wharfside cafes blonde beauties dined on steak and ice cold beer. I had
wondered why Ann wasn't doing the adult equivalent of taking a trip to
Disneyland, but the reason was clear -- she was already there.
Continuing as normal, mothering four children, teaching full-time,
moving house the week I arrived and even buying a dog -- it was all part
of Ann's survival plan: to be positive.
''We'd already decided to have the house built,'' she explained.
''Cancelling our plans after the diagnosis would have been so
negative.''
Finally, after two false starts, the day of Ann's admission arrived.
As the Royal Brisbane Hospital loomed ahead she mouthed: ''Oh shit! I
want to turn back. I don't want to go on.'' But the countdown had
started. There was a conditioning phase of chemotherapy to destroy her
own marrow. Conditioning days were given negative numbers (-8 to -1).
Transplant day was to be day zero and each day after that would have a
positive number. Ann was put in an isolation room.
I was admitted to the chemotherapy ward on Day -1. A registrar came
and prodded my liver. ''Your counts are high,'' he explained. ''That may
mean you have the same disease as your sister.''
''Could you say that again?'' I asked, swaying. Siblings, it appears,
have a four times higher risk of developing leukaemia than the rest of
the population. However, I had no symptoms, and the reason for the high
blood count could have been due to the blood taken during tests.
The next morning, under general anaesthetic, five needles were
inserted in my pelvis. When I came round I felt as if I'd been kicked by
a horse.
Ann received the marrow in her room -- the liquid flowing through a
drip while she chatted to her family and drank a cup of tea.
I was let out on Day +1 with a bruise like a stormy sunset on my back.
Ann carried on with a diet of light entertainment -- TV, magazines and
chit-chat with the hospital staff. Sometimes I worried we were being too
light. Were we side-stepping the issue? Refusing to face up to her
possible death?
''My motto has been 'Hope for the best and prepare for the worst'.'' I
appealed to a pastor. ''Now, we're all being positive as can be -- but
as for preparing for the worst -- I don't know where to start.''
''You're already preparing,'' he said, ''just by being here, doing
what you can. But you should discuss the practical aspects; it will be a
relief to all of you.''
Day +12 and Ann's condition was progressing according to plan. But the
plan was grim. She lost her hair and threw up every time she ate. She
stopped seeing her children because of the risk of infection they
carried. For two days we heard David, the man in the next room,
groaning, then all went quiet and the charge nurse told us he had died.
''It's not easy being positive,'' said Ann.
Not when positive means unrealistic. Picking my words carefully, I
told her what the pastor said.
She looked at me, eyes fierce and steady. ''I'm not worried about the
children -- they'll survive. We did.''
Yes. We had lost our mother in our teens.
''And I'd rather be cremated than buried. But I don't know what the
Garden of Remembrance is like.''
''So we'd need to check it out?''
''Yes.''
There was a silence while I worked up to a question: ''Given the worst
scenario, how long should I hang about?''
She looked surprised then said: ''Just go, after the funeral. Just
go.''
We were quiet. ''Is that enough?'' I said. ''Shall we go back to being
positive again?''
She nodded: ''Yes''.
Ann is home now. She's doing well. Positivism has become our habitual
outlook and we have to remind ourselves not to let it become
complacency. If the transplant works it works immediately, but she won't
be declared ''cured'' until she's had five symptomless years.
Once, in hospital, she told me about a vision she had.
''All this is over and I'm walking along the beach with Chris and the
children and the dog.''
''And where am I?''
''Oh,'' she said, ''you'll have flown home.''
And now her vision has come true.

* THE newly opened Centre for Women's Health at 6 Sandyford Place,
Glasgow (next to the Eye Infirmary), offers an ongoing series of
discussions, free and open to all, to stimulate debate on issues of
relevance to women. The next one is on Eating Disorders led by Annette
Welsh of the Eating Disorders Association on Tuesday, April 25, from
1.30-3.30pm. The centre is open Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday from 10am -
4.30pm. Further information on 0141 211 6700.
Preventing piles
* IF you have ever suffered from piles you will know it's no laughing
matter. Now Anusol is available over the counter, making it the only
haemorrhoid treatment containing hydrocortisone that you can buy without
prescription and offering sufferers a self-treatment option. To find out
more on how to treat this painful condition, write to the Anusol
Advisory Bureau, 17-19 Castle Street, Hertford SG14 1ER, for a free
leaflet which explains causes, symptoms, treatment, and prevention.
Please enclose sae no smaller than A5 size.
Nut guide
* ABERDEEN Environmental Health is taking peanut allergies seriously.
It has just produced a Nut Allergy Guide leaflet for manufacturers,
caterers, chefs, and service staff. It calls for accurate labelling of
all dishes and warns chefs to take care when making new recipes that
call for nuts. Also it warns: ''Remember any nut oil previously used to
cook food can contain traces of nut protein. This will have the same
effect as nut oil.'' The leaflet is available from Environmental
Development Division, City of Aberdeen District Council, St Nicholas
House, Broad Street, Aberdeen AB9 1BX.
Easing arthritis
* MANY sufferers from arthritis, both osteo and rheumatoid, find
nutritional supplements help, according to a recent survey. Those who
used Joint Nutritional Complex, a supplement containing natural
ingredients including shark cartilage noted a ''70% improvement''. Made
by Larkhall, a bottle containing 60 tablets costs #13.95 from selected
health food shops and chemists. If you have difficulty finding a
supplier, call Larkhall Green Farm on 0181 874 5631.
Helping hand
* COULD nurses do some of the routine work in general practice? An
interesting experiment carried out in the North-east of England found
that the answer was yes. Cleveland GP Geoffrey Marsh's practice nurse
performed 692 consultations in six months and only needed to refer to
the GP in 14% of the cases.
The nurse handled minor chest infections, asthma, skin problems, and
family planning problems, says a recent report in the British Medical
Journal. In all, 549 patients did not return with their illness while
half were given advice on self-care only. But first the nurse had
undergone a year's training and then she spent two hours a day seeing
patients, thus saving one hour of GP time per clinic.
Dr Marsh said the effort involved in training the nurse was worth
while because ''the duty doctors were able to go home an hour earlier
than they would have done. All the GPs benefited by being able to
concentrate on more serious complaints.''

There are many ways of avoiding of illness, but as Dr Elizabeth Scott
reports, common sense is the key to countering the possibility of high
blood pressure endangering your life.
STROKES don't just change individual lives, they also affect everyone
within the family unit, since no matter how gallantly those afflicted
fight it, they will need looking after.
It is the third most common cause of death in developed countries,
coming after heart disease and cancer. The risk of death rises with age
-- from 10 in every 100,000 at 40-years-old to 1000 in every 100,000
after the age of 75.
Spending money to prevent strokes would appear to be a less costly
option than providing aftercare. But so far this has not been encouraged
on the NHS, partly because treatment for high blood pressure -- the most
common cause of strokes -- is life-long and expensive and partly because
established medicines have side-effects.
But this may no longer be the case.
In an Australian trial for a new drug 3500 men and women, aged from 30
to 69, with mild hypertension were offered treatment or a placebo over
four years. There was a two-thirds reduction of strokes in the treated
group. The medication clearly helped.
But regardless of what drugs might or might not be available, there
are other things which can be done to reduce the risk of having a
stroke.
Stroke-incidence is directly related to high blood pressure. Both are
more common among smokers. Cutting out cigarettes and exercising more
will reduce blood pressure and the risk of having a stroke.
Caffeine raises blood pressure and a cup of coffee may put your
pressure up for a couple of hours. Those of you who keep going all day
with a mug of coffee beside you might consider changing to a
caffeine-free drink. Always remember that coffee is not the only drink
with caffeine in it. Tea has some; many fizzy drinks also. It is worth
reading the contents listed on the tin or bottle before you buy.
The effect of stress on blood pressure is harder to gauge. That it has
an effect, I am in no doubt. Some people seem able to cope and avoid the
hypertension that accompanies badly managed stress.
Those who can't cope suffer transient increased blood pressure which
becomes chronic, and is worsened by recourse to coffee, cigarettes and
alcohol.
Weight reduction may also help reduce the risk of strokes, though the
benefit of diet restriction is harder to prove. Too much salt and fat;
too little calcium, magnesium, or potassium are all highlighted by one
or other trial as contributing to strokes.
So long as you have a normal body structure and your doctor has not
ordered you a definite diet, as can happen if you have diabetes or high
blood-fat levels, it seems more rational to eat a well-balanced diet
with as much variety as possible.
Taking a regular low dose of aspirin to thin the blood may be
beneficial but, taken to excess, it can cause gastric bleeding,
especially in the elderly. None the less it is often recommended
following a transient ischaemic attack.
It takes about five minutes to have your blood pressure checked. If it
is too high, there are positive steps that can be taken to reduce the
risk of strokes. It might be the most important five minutes of your
life.

IT SEEMS that the way the unemployment statistics are calculated may
be changed yet again. This time at least it is at the behest of the
Royal Statistical Society which is urging the Government to make the
jobless-count more consistent with international definitions. Since the
Tories came to power in 1979 there have been no fewer than 30 changes
made to the way in which the seasonally adjusted uemployment total is
counted, all but one of them have led to the total being reduced.
Perhaps not surprisingly, even now, when there are tangible signs of
economic recovery, there is still some scepticism among the public about
the true level of unemployment, as opposed to the numbers claiming
benefit.
Despite what the statistics say about a decline in the number of
people unemployed, to my mind there are still too many unemployed
graduates considering that we are supposed to be experiencing a strong
economic recovery. There can be few other countries in the world which
would adopt such a relaxed attitude to such a high level of graduate
unemployment. Among non-graduates, youth unemployment also remains a
serious problem.
Rather than concentrating on the precise numbers of unemployed, the
key question which needs to be addressed is why unemployment throughout
Europe has remained so high for so long. There is no clear consensus
among policy makers on why this should be the case. Various factors are
blamed, including competition from developing countries, rapid
technological change, and rigidities in the labour market.
According to a recent report from the Centre for Economic Policy
Research (CEPR), the notion that developing countries have in some sense
''stolen our jobs'' is just plain wrong. Access to a cheaper source of
some goods should allow Europe to shift resources into other lines of
production in which it has a comparative advantage.
On the question of new technology the CEPR report suggests that if
anything the rate of technological change has been too slow in Europe.
Historical evidence appears to refute the idea that jobs are permanently
destroyed by new technology. Productivity today is 10 times higher than
in 1900 but the unemployment rate is not that different. The reason is
that technical progress also opens up possibilities for new jobs
elsewhere in the economy. For example, the fledgling cable industry in
the UK is expected to create 25,000 jobs in the long term.
ON THE question of greater labour-market flexibility, there is
evidence that the European labour market is already very flexible.
(Indeed some would argue that in the UK in particular the pendulum has
swung too far in favour of employers.) One in every six or seven jobs is
created or destroyed each year, a rate which is only slightly lower than
in the US and Canada.
The US is often held up as a good example of what can be done in the
labour market. While it has undoubtedly been more successful than Europe
in generating jobs over the past 20 years, it has also produced more
poverty. This is because of larger pay differentials between jobs in the
US, less employment security, and less generous unemployment benefits.
While the UK has tended to follow socially much of what has happened
in the US, the recent backlash in the UK against naked greed and
unfairness at the top of some of our privatised companies suggests that
an entirely free market does not rule OK in the UK. As to the possible
remedies for unemployment, what is depressing is that research suggests
that training, greater investment in which is much favoured by the
Labour Party, may not have much impact in reducing unemployment. Indeed
its usefulness appears to be mostly in allowing unscrupulous employers
to exploit a constant pool of cheap labour. However, such schemes do at
least keep potential workers in touch with the labour market.
There are some who believe that many of the reforms which could reduce
European unemployment may be politically difficult to implement. This is
because a significant fraction of the electorate may be worse off after
reform, and there may be no practical means of compensating these
losers. The fact is that despite the high level of unemployment, the
majority of the electorate are employed and policy is in practice
determined by their interests.
Many of the rigidities that are thought to contribute to Europe's high
unemployment (such as minimum wages, generous unemployment benefits,
high firing costs, and strong unions) actually benefit some of the
employed and are therefore difficult to remove.
If the social problems already evident in Europe are not to grow out
of hand then firm Europe-wide action needs to be taken to tackle
unemployment. However the history of European co-operation to date does
not augur well for the future in this regard.

THE agricultural industry can expect further legislation controlling
the levels of water pollution in the countryside.
That was made clear when international experts on diffuse pollution
met in Edinburgh at the start of a major two-day conference examining
what controls can be brought in to reduce the amounts of plant
nutrients, pesticides and farm wastes that reach existing water systems.
Professor Phillip Thomas, principal of the Scottish Agricultural
College, said: ''This is a hot topic, a real area of concern. We cannot
ignore the pollution debate and we have to provide the information and
advice that will be needed. This is a public education need which at
present we fail to address.''
He said that part of the problem stemmed from the rapid expansion of
agricultural production in Europe over the past two decades which, while
leading to self-sufficiency, had also caused consumer concern about food
safety, healthier diets and environmental pollution of the countryside.
Brian Darcy of the Forth River Purification Board told delegates that
one of the biggest problems was the run-off of silt due in part to soil
erosion. Nitrogen use on farms had increased eight-fold since the
fifties and that was only one chemical effect on waterways.
''We need to have more grassroots contact with land users and that
involves the SAC and FWAG (the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group) with
more effort in monitoring,'' he said.
Dov Weitman of the US Environmental Protection Agency said that in
North America one-third of rivers, lakes and streams were impaired by
pollution and 72% of that stemmed from agriculture. The US is currently
spending $100m a year to combat pollution involving farming and
forestry, and one of the biggest problems is soil erosion and sediment
contamination of waterways. Farmers are being urged to adopt non-tilling
or minimum-tilling husbandry practices to reduce this.
Keith Bruce of the Scottish Office Agriculture Department said the
industry produced polluting wastes from slurries, silage effluent and so
on but also used a range of chemicals.
Traditional farming systems were generally extensive and the wastes
created did not exert a great pressure on the environment but
intensification has progressed farm-based pollution from being a minor
irritant to the subject of national concern.
He said: ''Intensive farming is good for filling supermarket shelves,
but without a high level of good agri-environment management it is less
good at harmonising with nature.''
He added that there was increasing pressure for farm land to be used
for the dumping of sewage. ''It is important to ensure that the
application of such wastes to land avoids risks to water suplies, to the
food chain or to creating nuisances such as unpleasant odours. Above
all, we must safeguard our scarce natural resource of land.''

HAVING children changes your life in so many ways, and maintaining a
social life is hardly one of the big priorities in the lives of new
parents. But what happens when the baby is old enough to accompany mum
and dad on a visit to their favourite restaurant?
The past few years have seen a mushrooming of burger bars and pizza
restaurants that openly embrace young children with free toys, colouring
books and waiters who are not afraid to get down on their knees and make
conversation with little ones.
But how have more mainstream restaurants reacted? I decided to
''borrow'' some children to find out if there are restaurants which can
please the whole family.
Rachel Reid is a determined young lady who knows what she likes. And
if there is nothing she likes on the menu, she simply demands her
favourite -- sausage and chips. Rachel, who is 21 months old, found
herself stranded in a high chair in The Church on the Hill, on Glasgow's
south side. The waitresses gushed over her as she lapped up the
attention and made her choice.
The portion was huge and Rachel seemed satisfied, although I was
unhappy about the fork, which was too big for a little mouth.
Unfortunately they did not have anything smaller, so we watched
nervously as Rachel insisted on feeding herself.
As dinner progressed, Rachel was by turn interested in the cappuccino
maker which emitted strange noises, but also a little disturbed by the
loud music -- restaurants must be strange places for people. The
waitresses were very friendly, talking more to the baby at the table
than the adults, and if it had not been for that fork and limited supply
of babychairs, the restaurant would have scored highly.
Lynsey and Craig Murray, six and eight respectively, are not fussy
eaters, their mother assured me -- they eat what their parents eat. To
test the theory, I joined them for lunch at Vitelli &amp; Vitelli, in
Glasgow's Italian Centre. Lynsey assured me that she liked pasta a lot,
Craig was not so sure about pasta, but said he ate most things so he
would find something he liked.
The menu consisted of pizza, pasta, liver, scrambled eggs and
steakburger. We spent a long time going through the menu, explaining
what everything was, and trying to break it all down to food they could
understand, for example, explaining the steakburger as a Big Mac with a
boring name!
Lynsey wanted pasta, but it had to be penne, there was no way she was
going to eat bow-shaped pasta. Craig thought he might like the scrambled
eggs, but when he heard about the smoked salmon he screwed up his face
in disgust.
The steakburger sounded tempting, buthe would prefer the pizza, if
they could take off the Italian meat and top it with onions. And, of
course, they both wanted fries. The waitress looked bemused but happily
took our order. When the food was served, they were both impressed with
the size of the portions. Lynsey would have Parmesan, but not black
pepper, and Craig wasn't so sure about those onions, although the chips
were good.
After only a few mouthfuls, Lynsey stopped and in a very small voice
said: ''I don't like this pasta, it's not like the penne my mum makes,
the tubes are too big.''
Craig, meanwhile, was happy with the pizza, although he did complain
that there was too much cheese on it, so he was prepared to share it
with his sister.
Dessert was easier to manage. It was a limited choice, but the huge
slab of chocolate fudge cake stole Craig's heart and the dainty caramel
shortcake was just enough for Lynsey. Craig's eyes lit up when the
waiter arrived with a small jug of cream. ''Can I pour the whole lot
over it?'' he asked, and took great pleasure in drenching the cake.
When the meal was finished, these two perfectly-behaved children began
running around and laughing in loud voices. Considering that they were
on a mission to find unfriendly restaurants, they could not have been
commanded to do better.
There were a couple of high chairs available, and the kitchen was
happy to make something more simple if the children wanted it. However,
there were no toys, play area or paper for doodling in Vitelli &amp;
Vitelli, which means children will end up running around. Both children
said they would happily return -- if the menu were improved.
Menus make eating out a problem, and as most parents will know,
children's menus are limited to fish fingers, chicken nuggets and
burgers, and everything with chips and beans.
Lynda Dalgleish, whose son Adam is 14 months old, does not
particularly like children's menus and points out that, since she had
her son, eating out needs precision planning. ''My husband and I still
like to eat out, but it is not as simple any more, we can't just act on
impulse and go for a bar lunch unless we know the place can accommodate
Adam.
''This means that everything has to be planned. We phone in advance to
make sure there is something he can eat, that there are high chairs,
maybe a play area, and baby-changing facilities.''
She adds: ''More restaurants have to realise how important it is to
cater for people with babies. Most of them probably do not intend to be
hostile, it is just that they have not thought about it carefully
enough.''
It is often the simple things that are overlooked, like having
somewhere to put a pram. Baby-changing facilities are also very
important, and the ladies' toilets are not always the best location.
Janet Findlay, mother of one-year-old Louise and three-year-old
Alexander, explains: ''I have found myself in the horrible predicament
of having to change the baby's nappy on the floor of the ladies' room
because there was nowhere else -- it was awful.
''What I now tend to do is find out where I can go that has good
baby-changing facilities -- I now know the right department stores to
visit.''
Most parents I spoke to agree that it is not all bleak and that things
have improved a great deal over the past few years. But all argued that,
as well as improving facilities, restaurants have to become more
tolerant of children being seen and heard.

AS PAUL ILES, the Festival Theatre's general manager, stated in the
printed programme: ''I hope you enjoy Figaro tonight, in the new opera
house''. The italics carried a coded message. Iles regards opera as a
major part of his planning, and wants to remind Scottish Opera that he
would like to be free to choose whatever companies he likes.
Midsummer Opera's production of Figaro, being in no sense a threat to
Scottish Opera, achieved an unimpeded one-night stand in Edinburgh
yesterday, along with a promise of more of the same sort of thing to
come. It drew a full house, and provided rather a good evening of its
kind, with attractive young singers, an inventive concept involving
large gilt picture frames, and some sense of pace and style.
Its flaws were orchestral and structural. Without trumpets and drums
to underpin the rhythms, the sound that David Roblou drew from his
players was too often feeble and slithery. Acts three and four were
crudely merged by way of some deplorable cuts, including the loss of
Barbarina's aria (the loss of Barbarina altogether in fact).
But with Sandra Ford's bright-toned Countess and Kathleen Tynan's
nimble Susanna leading a personable cast, all was not lost. The picture
frames underlined the fact that Figaro is the greatest of all musical
portrait galleries, but served also as useful doors and windows with an
occasional touch of Magritte-like surrealism. Alan Privett's production
used them to advantage, not least in the intricacy of the garden scene.

THE chanting on the sound-score is fast, insistent. Over and over, one
word: kabbadi. You can hear the rasping hoarseness as the breath runs
out. On stage, the dancers are whirling and kicking, feinting and
weaving in a bid to outsmart their opponent -- to touch first, avoid
being touched. Only there's no absolutely marking out of sides here. In
this game, identity shifts between defender and attacker -- they are,
after all, two sides of one coin -- and the true battle lies in keeping
control, whatever the situation.
Raid -- Shobana Jeyasingh's newest work -- has its beginnings in a
popular Indian street game. It reaches out, however, in several
directions, conjuring swift images of, for instance, warlike
confrontation, playground competitiveness, artistic exploration, and the
very nature of performing itself -- again, that element of possessing a
space, controlling the watchers' reactions, dazzling them with the
brilliance of your display.
Choreographically it is bold, imaginative, refreshingly so. Jeyasingh
deftly draws in movement from a fine array of sources. Gestures and
steps from the classical vocabulary of Bharata Natyam look marvellously
at home among sharp martial kicks and lunges, soft contemporary
counterbalances, and strong, clean lifts. The latter are particularly
striking, a celebration of the new strengths and directions she is
encouraging within her all-female company, as well as a testimony to the
trust they have in her artistic vision: for while they all retain a
lovely purity and poise in the execution of familiar Indian techniques,
they also have moved with real assurance towards the movements she has
introduced from other dance vocabularies.
Like Siobhan Davies, Jeyasingh presents dance works that are
meticulously conceived down to the last detail of costume, stage
setting, and sound-score. She really is a vital, innovative force in
contemporary choreography. Making of Maps, a previous piece included in
this double bill, points up the territory she has chosen to explore.
Raid simply reaffirms the appeal of her approach, her flair for seeing
new ways and new contexts for steps that are familiar to different
cultures.

Paul Newman is back to prove as a screen actor he is second to none.
PAUL Newman is Hollywood's reigning star actor, the king. Even Clint
would probably agree. He is now 70 and his career has slowed down of
late. His most recent appearance was playing against type in a
supporting role as the scheming corporation man in Hudsucker Proxy. But,
in Robert Benton's Nobody's Fool, Newman is back in the lead, playing a
man 10 years younger than he is in real life, demonstrating that as a
screen actor he is second to none and carrying the burden of the
picture. He was once again nominated for a best actor Oscar.
Benton wrote Bonnie and Clyde, and Superman, won an Oscar as best
director and screenwriter for Kramer vs Kramer, and a third Oscar as
screenwriter for Places in the Heart. This film, based on a book by
Richard Russo, is about a smalltown handyman in upstate New York whose
world is collapsing around him, but who gradually picks up the pieces
and the role allows Newman to display all the qualities which have made
him a star.
He also gets to have a tentative romance with Melanie Griffiths which
could have been an embarrassing combination of age and beauty in its
prime, but works wonderfully well.
Benton said that when he read the book Newman came to mind for the
role almost at once. ''I first began to work with Paul 20 years ago as a
screen writer on a script called the Tin Lizzie Troop, which he wanted
to do as a director,'' he said. ''It was never made. When they gave me
Russo's book to read I realised it had this remarkable character called
Donald Sullivan and within 30 pages the image of Paul Newman as Solly
came to mind. The man was the Newman I knew both as a friend, and as a
member of the audience of films like Hud, The Hustler, Cool Hand Luke
and Butch Cassidy. It was that character getting older.''
How did he handle actors, especially star players like in this film?
The director, Hal Prince, said once that nine tenths of a director's
work was in casting, he said. You made sure first that you were in
agreement with the actor about his interpretation of the role. There
were those moments when actors trusted themselves and, if they were
right, what they did could be wonderful, but if it was wrong, it was for
the director to show them you thought it a nice try, but the line of the
character you had agreed with them must be maintained.
The director's job was to keep ''the dramatic arc of the picture in
line''.
He had worried when he cast Melanie Griffiths that she might prove
''too erotic'' as Toby, the unhappy wife of a house builder, who once
employed Solly, to whom he is attracted. The attraction is mutual. His
solution was simple. ''I explained to her she was really one of the
guys, a bit like Jean Arthur in Only Angels have Wings, and on the first
day of rehearsals Paul read Toby's part and she read Donald. She then
understood that the roles were interchangeable and it made an enormous
difference to how she played the part. She got the idea, and she got it
to perfection.''
The builder, with whom Solly has fallen out, is played by an
uncredited Bruce Willis. He refused billing on the grounds that it was
''Paul's film''. Benton told a story which illustrates just how long
Newman's career has been. On the first day of rehearsal Willis told him
this was the second time they had worked together in a film. ''I had a
two shot with you once, '' he said. Newman could not for the life of him
remember when.
The next day Willis turned up with a video of Sidney Lumet's 1982
film, The Verdict, for which Newman received an Oscar nomination for his
role as an ageing alcoholic lawyer, a failure, whose career suddenly is
saved by a medical malpractice case. In the trial scene in the
background as an extra was Bruce Willis.
He said he had been able to get the starry cast -- it includes Jessica
Tandy in her second-last screen role as Sullivan's autocratic landlady
-- because they wanted to work with Newman. ''He is not only a great
actor, but an incredibly generous one,'' he said. ''Paul is someone to
come up against. Athletes want to come up against the best, because it
brings out the best in them, and it is the same with actors. Paul brings
out the best in other people.
Tandy, who died earlier this year, was very ill while making the film,
but nobody had understood quite how ill, he said. ''I had arranged for
her to have her camper very close to the set so she would always have a
place to lie down, and for someone to be with her at all times. It is my
custom to sit with the actors at the end of the day and talk about the
next day's scenes, and then the next morning to rehearse on set with
them. When I am satisfied I bring the camera crew and the stand-ins on
and set out the scene and give the actors an hour or so to relax.
''I said she could go back to her camper but she would stay on the
set, talk to people and knit and we all of us forgot how seriously ill
she was. It was a fine performance. She never asked for any kind of
special treatment. I think her performance in the film is brilliant, but
the one she gave on the set to make people think she was healthier than
she really was, was a better performance.''
* Nobody's Fool opens tomorrow

Dear Mr Hurd,
LOOKING for something just that little bit different this year? Tired
of sun, sea, sand, and the same dreary routine of peace, perfect peace,
where-ever you turn? We may have the answer.
Nato is a small, personally-supervised company with an enthusiastic
staff and, though we do say so ourselves, quite a reputation for finding
that destination with a difference. At Nato Tours we aim to give
friendly and professional service, no frills, and some of the very
cheapest apologies in the business. After over 50 years in the trade,
our motto is: Never make a promise you might want to keep.
In our enclosed economy brochure, Let's Go to Beautiful Bosnia!,
you'll find full details of just a few of the thrill-a-minute packages
we've put together to suit all blood types and defence budgets. On a
Nato Tours holiday highly trained couriers are available at all times to
provide emergency airlifts, glib consolation, draft treaties, sticking
plaster, and grovelling apologies to psychotic militiamen. If you've
time on your hands and questions in the House to answer, don't hesitate:
book your all-in humanitarian disaster now! At Nato Tours we have a
range of options to suit every taste.
Naturally, since we have only your comfort in mind, nothing we offer
is too taxing, but as inactivity holidays go, three entire years spent
just pretending to be doing something is surely a vacation with a
difference, don't you agree? In any case, industry analysts predict that
this year could be something very special for the Costa Bosnia, even by
our matchless standards. With that glorious Caucasian sunshine not so
very far off, there's every prospect of a return to good old-fashioned
all-out war, a vintage diplomatic tourist season, and more of those
picturesque corpses than you could shake an order paper at.
Wouldn't you just love to be at the bustling heart of it all? So why
not choose one of our two-centre holidays? A week in Sarajevo
(complimentary five days of fuel and ammunition per customer) is the
experience of a lifetime, as all our clients past and present agree. Why
not combine a few nights in a cosy cellar in one of Europe's finest
cities with full authentic Serbian siege conditions and all the fun of
traditional genocide, mass rape, mortar attacks, and so forth in some
defenceless village?
Or perhaps your secret dream is of the perfect rural idyll, of a
countryside so serene you would think no-one had ever lived there? Nato
is the answer you've been looking for. With our vast experience of the
international armed travel trade, we can guarantee to find you a spot
unspoilt by people (landmine damage waiver necessary) and free of
unsightly houses, schools, hospitals, and mosques. Bosnia isn't just
unspoiled, it's fully refurbished to the highest modern standards,
ethnically-speaking.
The Nato Tours Guarantee: We inspect each concentration camp and bomb
site personally to ensure your total satisfaction. Most of our
quaintly-devastated properties are run by the locals themselves, yet
offer a very warm welcome to outsiders. The food is simple but highly
scarce, the atmosphere unforgettable, and the night-life (don't miss
those famous shrapnel displays) always lively!
Or why not take advantage of our very reasonable 1995 Peace Process
Package? See the world-famous Dance of the UNPROFOR Sitting Ducks; waltz
with the Contact Group around some of the finest negotiating tables in
the world; get a ringside seat while local sportsmen try to bag that
rare souvenir UN aid plane; laugh at the hilarious traditional trade
sanctions mime play! Nato's rates, particularly for large groups of
casualties, are second to none.
Each client receives a complimentary gift pack of diplomatic
initiatives, and armoured personnnel carrier hire can be arranged if
fact-finding is your hobby. With Nato Tours you can't miss -- and, take
our word for it, your hosts try not to!
Booking with Nato you can relax secure in the knowledge that yours is
a holiday other people would die for, and the guarantee that our staff
are doing their very best to make sure it stays that way. Trust Nato;
the World's Favourite Paper Tiger.
One suggestion. If this is the first time you've given serious
consideration to Bosnia as potential leisure destination of choice, you
may find some of the following words and phrases useful when trying to
get the most out of your Nato Tours holiday. These handy expressions are
all in Serbo-Croat, but we find most locals can be persuaded to
understand them sooner or later: Dobro jutro: ''Good morning''.
Da li ste Vi gospodin Hurd?: ''Are you Mr Hurd?'' Molim Vas, da li
mozete da mi pomognete?: ''Can you help me, please?'' Da li imate hleba:
''Have you got any bread? Gde je voda za pice: ''Where is the drinking
water?'' Dogodio se nesrecan slucaj: ''There has been an accident.''
Povredjen sam: ''I am hurt.''
Hitno potrazite pomoc!: ''Fetch help quickly!'' Ne moze da dise: ''He
can't breathe.''
Pokrite ga: ''Cover him up.''
Happy holidays, Mr Hurd, and bon voyage!

QUITE the best news of the week is that Senator Robert Dole will
challenge for the US presidency in 1996. It will be even better if, when
the great day comes, he sends Bill Clinton -- was I wrong about him! --
back to the oblivion he so richly deserves. Bob Dole, the Republican
leader in the Senate, is not a person to be packaged like a bar of soap.
He is a spin doctor's nightmare, a man who spits it out as he sees it.
''Stop telling lies about me,'' he snarled at George Bush, and is given
to telling reporters what he really thinks of their stories.
He will not, unlike Bush, allow himself to become the prisoner of the
religious right, and he has a good lady wife, Elizabeth, who is a
formidable politician in her own right.
In 1996 Bob Dole will be 73 years old. So what? I am tired of
baby-faced politicians, those with no recollection of anything before
the Beatles, those with convictions as bland as Blair. We are obsessed
by age in this country -- even more than class -- and are constantly
condemning to the scrap-heap those who have hardly completed a half
century.
Dole was gravely wounded while serving as a second lieutenant in Italy
50 years ago, and still has only partial use of one arm. ''My friends,''
he told a rally, ''I am tempered by adversity, seasoned by experience.
''I have the experience, I've been tested in many ways. I am not
afraid of leading and I know the way.'' You're the man.
Sadly, a 73-year-old in British politics would be told to go to sleep
in the House of Lords or be asked to be the Father of the Commons. I am
far from sure that Edward Heath is not still the best leader of the Tory
Party.
We Brits would never have sent for de Gaulle, Adenauer may have
re-built Germany but he would probably have been considered too old for
a seat on our new unitary councils, Chairman Mao would have been locked
up in an institution, Tito, the only man ever to unite Yugoslavia, would
no doubt have been offered early retirement.
Yet there seems no logical reason why we should adopt such a churlish
policy. People are not only living longer, they are living better
longer.
Go to any golf club and you will find a large senior section that will
include players who are as competitive as the club champion. They will
also play a lot faster than him.
If I was seeking to find the solution to a complicated moral problem I
would much rather discuss it with my 79-year-old mother-in-law than some
philosophy student. Wisdom and judgment have to be acquired.
When we were in America on holiday a couple of years ago we stayed at
a hotel where all the front-of-house staff were pensioners. ''They are
much more reliable, are polite to the customers, and they don't get
pregnant,'' the manager informed me.
There is definitely a case to be made for having more elderly
politicians, especially if you are a Tory. In general, not only do they
not get themselves, or others, in the family way, they are less likely
to engage in three-in-the-bed romps and/or horizontal jogging. It is a
pity Alec Douglas-Home is not quite fit enough to be fielded by our side
again in Perthshire.
My most recent electoral experience merely confirmed what I already
knew -- that the over-60s are the most reliable voters of them all. Two
doctors, both in their nineties, made their own way to the polls in
Colinton.
Another lively octogenarian marched in, voted, and was then asked by
my agent if she would like a lift home. ''No,'' she replied, ''but you
can run me to the GPO.''
Mind you, we were hoist by own own petard when, out canvassing with
the Doc, a child answered my knock on the door. Always beware of
ankle-biters, they are much more dangerous than dogs in my opinion.
''Can I speak to your mummy?'' I inquired sweetly. The kid looked
extremely doubtful.
A female voice floated out from the kitchen. ''Who is it, darling?''
''Two old men,'' replied the brat.
I tell you, I would raise the age at which folk were allowed to vote,
not reduce it. What do they know at 18 and what experience or maturity
do the duxes of the nursery schools bring to our political life?
Bob Dole spelled out what he saw as his mandate. ''I would rein in the
federal government in order to set free the spirit of the American
people, reconnect our government with the commonsense values of our
citizens and reassert America's interests wherever and whenever they are
challenged around the world.''
No-one has spoken like that since Ronnie Reagan, another old boy who
served his country better than any whiz-kid ever did. If some
Conservatives would occcasionaly talk such sense our party would not be
in the parlous state it is today.
When I first entered Edinburgh Corporation there was a delightful lady
councillor called Barbara Woodburn, then in her late seventies. Her
husband Arthur had been Secretary of State for Scotland.
I came into a committee meeting one day and discovered her sitting on
the Conservative side of the table. ''I'm sorry,'' I spluttered, ''I
didn't know you were a Tory.''
''I am not,'' she shot back, ''I am just a bit deaf in one ear.'' That
she may have been, but she never missed a trick.
Yesterday, in the centre of town, one of my voters, clad in track suit
and trainers, trotted up to me at the traffic lights. ''Just off to get
my bus pass, was 65 this week,'' he informed me and dashed off. Age need
not weary them.

Far from the milieu of such as Forrest Gump, the latest films, in
William Russell's view, examine striking issues of social concern.
MOVING and very violent -- be warned, there is much which will shock
-- Lee Tamahori's Once Were Warriors should not be missed by anybody who
wants to see a new directing talent explode on the screen.
His first feature film is an incredibly powerful affair, and Tamahori
has extracted from the cast, particularly Temuera Morrison and Rena Owen
as the warring parents, performances which are almost beyond praise.
Do not expect a cheerful night out. This is not the world of Gump, but
the real world, and it is a nasty place. Expect instead a challenging,
deeply disturbing experience from which you will emerge sadder, wiser
and very angry.
The action is set in an Auckland suburb, home to a Maori community,
but the film is not about the plight of the Maoris in present-day New
Zealand. This could be any housing estate, any place where jobs are
scarce, people drink too much and the men believe they have the right to
do what they wish with their women.
It is a world of cheap houses set in a landscape littered with
rusting, abandoned cars, flyblown rubbish dumps, concrete flyovers, and
graffiti-covered walls where hope is in short supply. There are enough
places and men like that in Scotland, in the world (for the brute male
is no preserve of Scots) for the film to have a universal message.
Jake (Morrison) has been married to Beth (Owen) for 18 years. They
have five children. He is a drunk and a wife abuser, but Beth, imbued by
Owen with great strength, resilience and emotional power, still loves
him, still hopes next time will be different. One can see why.
Morrison's Jake is a virile, handsome, sexual animal who, when not
taken with the drink, can be a loving husband. The trouble is, having
lost yet another job, Jake has opted for life on welfare -- it pays
almost as much as working -- and the bottle. His days with his cronies
at the pub are one long round of beers and battles followed by late
night parties at his home.
Beth, no pushover, puts up with it -- some of the time. A woman of
spirit who married beneath her, she has not learned, even after 18years,
that the worst thing to do is answer back when he is drunk. Her refusal
to do as she is told one drunken night leads to a truly terrifying
on-screen beating which literally chills the blood.
The family is disintegrating. Beth, with no help from Jake, struggles
to keep it together. Their eldest son, Nig (Julian Arahanga), who
regards his father with contempt, but shares his machismo, has joined
the local gang, where the initiation rite is providing proof of one's
ability to withstand being beaten up.
Boogie (Taungaroa Emile), their middle son, Beth's favourite, has been
sent to reform school. Their teenage daughter, Grace (Anita Kerr-Bell),
gentle and shy, ill equipped to cope with the harsh world of the estate,
spends her time writing essays about the mythical Maori past which she
reads to the two younger children: helpless onlookers as the adults
brawl. Grace is to be the victim, Beth the survivor of events which
follow remorselessly from Jake's egocentric behaviour.
The sheer raw sense of working class life the film exudes makes
Nobody's Fool, Robert Benton's polished fable, based on a book by
Richard Russo, seem positively trivial. Set in New Bath, a rundown
little town in upstate New York, it is, nevertheless, a story of
relationships being painfully rebuilt which has much to recommend it,
including a performance from Paul Newman which is the best he has given
in years.
He is Donald Sullivan, the town ne'er do well. Like Beth, Sully finds
his world also in disarray, but it is a fairytale world far removed from
the harsh one in which Beth is trapped. Benton does make clear, however,
that the little town is dying on its feet and hope is in short supply,
but the glossy production values tend to work against him.
A jobbing builder injured in an accident, Sully is at odds with his
former employer, Bruce Willis. He hankers after Willis's estranged wife,
Melanie Griffith, and is forced to rebuild his relationship with his
long lost son, Dylan Walsh, who has returned to visit his mother,
Sully's ex wife, for Thanksgiving.
Jessica Tandy, in one of her last roles, is Sully's landlady, watching
his behaviour with a fond eye -- she was once his teacher -- and
providing the dignified dea ex machina who brings the gently rambling
story to its conclusion.
Griffith is very good as the sort of good natured woman who is one of
the boys, Willis demonstrates that he is really a good character actor
star, and Newman makes Sully a charmer: no mean feat because in real
life, ne'er do wells are invariably pains in the neck to be avoided at
all costs. Nobody's Fool is funny, well written and beautifully
photographed, but in spite of all that, remains pure candy floss.
In Blue Sky, directed by Tony Richardson, his last film before his
death from Aids, Jessica Lange gives a glittering performance as a
military wife who strays, which deservedly won her an Oscar.
But the film, set in the 1960s, is a case of the part being greater
than the whole. Lange, married to Tommy Lee Jones, a military scientist,
lives in a fantasy world -- at one moment she is Bardot, the next
Monroe, then Hayworth -- but for all her wantonness their marriage
endures until he is posted to a new base in Alabama and she decides to
seduce the commander, Powers Boothe.
Lange, sparkles as a good-time girl who can't help it, and gets
admirable support from Lee Jones. The plot, about yet another wicked
military-industrial complex, becomes a distraction, however, and
eventually the film judders to a halt amid some evidence of frantic
re-editing.
For Lange alone it is worth catching, although as a memorial to
Richardson it is not up to much.
John Singleton's Poetic Justice, A Street Romance, stars Janet Jackson
as Justice, a girl who writes dreadful poetry, actually provided by Maya
Angelou, but clearly rejects culled from Patience Strong's wastebasket.
She falls in love with Lucky (Tupac Shakur) a postman with a small
daughter, and with another couple, Iesha (Regina King) and Lucky's mate
Angel (Crystal A. Rogers), they go on a trip to Oakland to deliver some
mail.
The scenery is gorgeous, the performances frenetic, and the limited
vocabulary employed in what passes for conversation, deeply depressing.
Ms Jackson is by nobody's standards a phenomenal woman, and the film a
sad comedown for the man who made Boyz N The Hood.
Steve James' documentary, Hoop Dreams, lasts nearly three hours, is
about two young black boys whose only means of escaping the ghetto is to
become basketball stars. Will they achieve their ambition? It is well
worth finding out. This is the American dream as it is lived today and
it is so well done that it passes in a flash.

THE gamekeepers are turning poachers in the Labour movement in
Scotland. Jimmy Allison, the indomitable former Scottish organiser of
the Labour Party in Scotland, has embarked upon an Indian summer of a
career as a political consultant.
Jimmy, best-known for his robust and down-to-earth approach in
smoke-filled Labour committee rooms, is now available for hire to write
political briefings, to arrange meetings with MPs and MEPs, and give
background advice on campaigning strategies. Presumably in his new role
as a go-between, Jimmy will have to gang a bit mair warily than was his
wont in earlier days.
It is an interesting concept to think of Jimmy glad-handing, for
instance, Donald Dewar, the former Shadow Scottish Secretary with whom
he has had something of a stormy relationship.
In his new job as a lobbyist Jimmy has joined Conroy Associates, run
by the eponymous Harry. Harry Conroy, who can equally be described as
indomitable, is a former Daily Record financial journalist and general
secretary of the National Union of Journalists.
Harry has never looked back since he became a businessman and bought
himself a wardrobe of pin-stripe suits. But will he be able to persuade
Jimmy Allison to buy a pin-stripe anorak?
Head that rolled
A LARGE envelope was delivered to the City Chambers in Edinburgh from
a firm of consultants offering their services to the new Embra unitary
council. What they specialised in was helping new councils head-hunt the
very best in talent, including chief executives, from the pool available
through the restructuring of local government.
The submission certainly caught the eye. Not, unfortunately, because
of its detail and quality. More that it had been addressed to one Paul
Lowenberg, the diminutive American who parted company as chief executive
with Edinburgh District Council two years ago after a spectacular and
very public falling-out.
Confusing
smoke signals
A WATERING-HOLE called Bleiker's Smoke House at Pately Bridge,
Nidderdale, in darkest England, advertises itself as offering
''exceptional country house accommodation with working smoke house
producing the finest smoked salmon . . . in delightful, unspoilt,
peaceful countryside; spacious en suite rooms; four-poster bed; log
fire; no smoking''.
Spewrious claims
ARCANE is the word for some of the information which comes the way of
the Diary. Like the following extract from the Government guide to
employers on National Insurance, specifically the subject of sick pay:
''If your employee becomes sick in, or travels through, Liechtenstein
while getting statutory sick pay, please contact the Contributions
Agency at your local Social Security office.'' What is particularly
sick-making about Liechtenstein? Have any readers ever been sick in
Liechtenstein? Have any readers ever blown their entire sick pay on a
night out in Liechtenstein? We really need to know.
No butts it's got
to be bigger
READERS with not much better to do may recall a Diary story about
left-handed underpants. We now hear, via a publication called For Him
Magazine, of Super Shaper briefs manufactured by Rush Industries of
Albertson, New York.
Research shows that 79% of women consider a chap's bum to be the
sexiest part of the anatomy but ''unfortunately, not every butt has the
requisite cheekiness''. Which is where the Super Shaper briefs come in:
''These wonder pants, made of the softest Lycra spandex fabric, use
discreet padding to provide a 'pumped-up, muscular buns' effect which
together with clever centre seams for 'eye-popping cleavage' leave even
the saggiest wearer with a dream harris.''
What is a ''dream harris'' we hear you ask? What has a beautiful
Hebridean island got to do with padded underpants? We don't know. We
looked up harris in Webster's, the American dictionary, but the closest
we could get in this context was a reference to Harris's woodpecker, a
hairy version of the bird.
The Super Shaper briefs come with an optional ''snap-in, fly-front
endowment pad, especially contoured to show off one's manhood in the
most exciting detail''. Which no doubt will give rise to such bits of
conversation as: ''Are you wearing those stupid underpants again or are
you just pleased to see me?''
Slipway to peace
THE peace process in Northern Ireland inches along, but this entirely
apocryphal tale of a job interview involving an enthusiastic engineer at
an unnamed shipyard is worth remembering.
The interview goes roughly along these lines:
Personnel: And your qualifications are . . ?
Engineer: Well, I'm an honours graduate. I spent two years working on
the mainland, then five in America with a leading aircraft company,
where I controlled experimental projects. But I've decided I want to
come home.
Personnel: Excellent, excellent. Now what school did you go to?
Engineer: Now look, I'll have no truck with that. I know what you're
up to. But my . . .
Personnel: Please, please, I understand. It's not what you think. It's
simply for the records, and for an equal opportunity programme, actually
landed on us at American insistence.
Engineer: That's all right. This 'what school did you go to' business
was one of the reasons I left in the first place. As it happens my
father is a Catholic and my mother Protestant. But I was brought up in a
strictly secular manner.
Personnel: Of course, of course. Anything else?
Engineer: I would like to add that I've specialised in engine design
and fuel-saving concepts. And I'm sure I could be an asset in this
capacity.
Personnel: Well, everything seems in order. Can your mum start on
Monday?

THE reduction in salmon fishing on the River Dee in Aberdeenshire
could lead to more recognition for Scottish artist Joseph Farquharson
(1846-1935).
The proprietors of Banchory Lodge Hotel, who own the largest private
collection of his works, aim to create new business by offering holiday
breaks centred on the artist and the area where he lived and painted.
Visitors will be able to attend a lecture, see and even paint the
almost unchanged landscapes used by Farquharson. They will also visit
Finzean House, home to the Farquharson clan since 1579, which the artist
made internationally famous through his paintings.
The shorter salmon-fishing season, caused by recent changes in
regulations in order to conserve stocks, has also led the hotel
proprietors, Dugald and Maggie Jaffray, to diversify by offering
organised garden visits and golfing and fly-tying breaks.
Mr Jaffray said they had had to come up with new holiday ideas for
their hotel and as they were always being asked about Joseph Farquharson
they decided to include a break linked to the artist.
Launching the initiative yesterday, Mr Derek Reid, chief executive of
the Scottish Tourist Board, said: ''We want to see more of this kind of
creative thinking and for some time diversification is a message we have
been driving home.
''It allows businesses to expand on an already established trading
base and this sort of venture has to increase as we move towards the
millennium.''

The sound of bagpipes
and the roar of a cannon marked the official opening of a
multi-million pound, upmarket store in the Highlands yesterday.
The House of Bruar, near the Falls of Bruar, a Perthshire tourist
attraction, includes a countrywear hall, gift shop, restaurant, garden
centre, and cloth and cashmere rooms.
It is believed the complex is one of the largest private investments
in Scottish tourism in recent years.
The Duke of Atholl and troops from his Atholl Highlanders, a private
army, performed the opening ceremony at the complex yesterday.
Pipers from the regiment played as a cannon was fired in the grounds
to signal the official opening.
Situated off the A9 near Blair Atholl, the House of Bruar already has
had around 10,000 visitors since it opened last week.
The majority of employees are local people and eventually there is
expected to be a staff of 90.
Husband and wife team Mark and Linda Birkbeck are the driving force
behind the House of Bruar.
Mr Birkbeck founded the Jumpers knitwear chain and the couple have
invested ''several millions'' of their own fortune in the Bruar
development.
Mr Birkbeck said, ''It has been unbelievable so far. This has
certainly been what I hoped for.''
He added: ''We are very confident of the future. We are promoting the
best through our enterprise.''
They hope the House of Bruar will attract 190,000 visitors a year.
The development has been designed in the style of a Victorian hunting
lodge and is intended as a showcase for the best of Scottish produce and
textiles.

A FATHER told yesterday how his schoolgirl daughter almost died after
having her nose pierced, and said: ''We hope her case will serve as a
warning to other youngsters.''
Fourteen-year-old Jane Clark, of Glebe Street, Dumfries, spent more
than two months in hospital after paying #3 in a local shop to have the
small gold stud inserted in her nose.
Doctors discovered that rare bacteria had entered her bloodstream and
affected her heart.
It was two days after the piercing that Jane began to have blinding
headaches. She also felt sick, had no appetite, and began to lose the
power in her legs.
Her father, Mr George Clark, 39, said: ''We called the doctor, who
thought that it was a virus and that she would be better in a week. But
she got worse.''
Jane was taken to Dumfries Infirmary. Doctors there were at first
puzzled by her condition. They removed her appendix in case that was the
cause but she continued to deteriorate. Then she reported seeing black
spots in front of her eyes and was given a scan.
Mr Clark, a car salesman, said: ''It revealed a rare form of bacteria
in her heart valve. It was growing and, if it had reached her brain, it
would have killed her.''
Jane, by this time very seriously ill, was taken by ambulance to the
Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, in Glasgow. Over the next
six weeks, she was given courses of antibiotics and then, after one
setback, began slowly to improve.
Mr Clark and his wife, Gail, 39 -- who also have two sons, George, 15,
and Allan, nine -- visited Jane in hospital every day and took her home
this week.
Mr Clark said: ''The doctors both in Dumfries and at Yorkhill were
quite definite that the illness was caused by the nose piercing.
''They say that her heart is still affected but believe she will
eventually make a full recovery. We've been told she's the luckiest girl
in Scotland. They told us that, if this had happened four or five years
ago, they would not have had the cure.''
He added: ''I am looking into possible further action over what
happened to my daughter.''
Mrs Clark said: ''We thought we were going to lose her. It was a
terrible time for all of us. Now she is resting at home and will have to
be off school for a while yet.''

WORKERS at the Terex plant in Lanarkshire have agreed a 3% wage deal,
further enhanced by a performance and productivity-related scheme.
The sophisticated agreement takes last year's settlement, based on
profit-sharing, another step forward.
The workforce of 600 at the Newhouse plant is producing more than 600
earth-moving vehicles a year. In 1990, around 950 workers produced fewer
than 500 machines.
Sales director Ken Coughlan yesterday predicted that Terex Equipment
would go from strength to strength.
It has just sold three vehicles in Japan, worth #600,000, and has high
hopes of strong growth, especially in the Far East.
However, it is unlikely that many more jobs would result from an
increased order book because of new technology introduced at Newhouse.
The factory -- forced into four-day working in 1992 because of
recession in the construction industry and strong foreign competition --
made profits of #3.6m last year, up from #2.5m in 1993.
Mr Coughlan yesterday praised the workforce for effectively competing
with rivals in America, Europe, and Japan.
Although returns from each vehicle are down on 1989, efficiency and
productivity have more than made up the plant's bottom line profits.
Newhouse is the only UK plant of US-based Terex, which has factories
in Germany and at home. The Lanarkshire works has a joint venture in
China, aiming to take advantage of major construction projects.

CELTIC Football Club is suing an advertising company for more than
#74,000 in a dispute over the proceeds from trackside hoardings.
The club said yesterday it is to sever all links with Moreton Sports
Media, which was handling the perimeter advertising for this season's
matches at Hampden, and had done the job for several seasons previously.
A club statement alleged that Moreton had failed to keep its side of
an agreement to pay more than #90,000 to the club by instalments.
The statement continued: ''Moreton currently owes Celtic #74,666,
which we obviously intend to collect. Court proceedings for payment have
been raised by our solicitors and all previous contracts have now been
terminated.''
The club's chief executive, Mr Fergus McCann, said they would do
everything possible to honour existing contracts for hoardings for the
remainder of the season, while Trainer Outdoor Advertising Limited will
take over new contracts for matches at Hampden and Celtic Park next
year.
Meanwhile, former Celtic director Michael Kelly yesterday launched a
#10,000 damages action against the club, claiming he was defamed in an
article in its official newspaper, Celtic View.
Also named in the action, which was called at Glasgow Sheriff Court,
was Mr McCann, the paper's publisher, and Mr Andrew Smith, the
journalist whose name appeared on the story.
The article, published almost a year ago, was the View's first major
interview with Mr McCann after he took control at Parkhead.
The case was raised briefly at an options hearing and adjourned for 28
days by Sheriff James Murphy.

<TEXT>
THE family of an 83-year-old retired bank manager, which was refused
permission to have the words ''dad'' and ''grandad'' on his gravestone,
won a ruling yesterday to have his body exhumed.
A judge at a Church of England court hearing ruled Charles and Wendy
Brown could move the body of Mr Brown's father Frederick from Holy
Trinity churchyard in Freckleton, Lancashire, and bury it in a civic
cemetery five miles away.
The vicar, the Rev Stephen Brian, told the Browns two years ago they
could not have the inscription ''beloved husband, dad, and grandad'' on
the tombstone. He was supported by a church Consistory Court.
However, another Consistory Court yesterday ruled the couple, of
Clayton-le-Woods, Lancashire, had been ''inadvertently misled'' by the
fact that other gravestones in the country churchyard bore the words.
Judge George Spafford, Chancellor of the Church of England's
Manchester Diocese, ruled that Mr Brown would not have buried his father
there if he had known the inscription would be banned. ''If this
exhumation is allowed, it will mitigate to some degree the harm caused
by them being unintentionally misled,'' said the judge.
The vicar and the church authorities had not opposed the Browns'
application to exhume the body of Mr Brown, who died in December 1992,
and bury him in Lytham St Annes.
Mr Brown, a 39-year-old dentist, said he was delighted, and his wife
added: ''We could not think of any inscription that would communicate
the close relationship which dad and grandad express.''

IT'S perhaps ironic that if the Tories had embraced Edward Heath's
advice in his Declaration of Perth in 1968 and introduced an assembly
for Scotland instead of the era of Thatcherism, they might not now be
languishing in the political doldrums in Scotland, and may fare no
better in their traditional areas of support in England in a month's
time.
Presentation of their policies is not the problem. The problem is they
no longer have palatable policies to project that people can support.
It's a pity they don't even take the advice of their own party
activists, the people who do the hard physical graft and spadework. The
Tories claim to be supporters of small businesses but there is not much
evidence of this in places like Dunoon, where shops lie empty and others
languish on the fringes of profitability, bled dry by innovative forms
of taxation by the party which claims to support low taxation.
Make no mistake, before the General Election the Government will
mysteriously conjure up money from some source for tax cuts to blackmail
enough people into voting them back into office.
As for Labour's intrepid George Robertson, one would have thought in
his euphoria with Labour's successes he would have had some semblance of
humility in his rhetoric, but true to form he indulged in his usual
tirade against Alex Salmond by which he certainly managed to demean his
stature as a serious politician.
Unionist politicians have got to face up to the fact that, no matter
how unpalatable it might be for them, colonialism is a spent and
discredited relic of the past.
Until Scotland, like so many other nations with infinitely less
resources and less skilled workforce, takes over the reins of
self-government again, our fortunes will continue to remain in the
doldrums.

I AM deeply worried about the one-sided attitude of the press over the
recent controversy about the Panorama broadcast prior to the local
elections in Scotland.
While the usual ''impartial'' journalists such as Ruth Wishart and the
rest clamoured about bias and unfair publicity by No 10 Downing Street,
it was interesting to note that absolutely no complaint was made about
the publishing of the propaganda sheet, The Bulletin, issued by Glasgow
District Council, which, surprise, surprise, was put out just before the
same election.
It was also interesting to note that the Strathclyder was also issued
just before the election. As usual it contained the normal left-wing
propaganda to persuade the masses to continue to re-elect their masters.
I have become aware over the past few years of a creeping infestation
of a left-wing bias in your paper and regret that you have seen fit to
abandon your previous impartial reporting of the facts. At least Brian
Meek manages to put forward a balanced outlook while making his
loyalties known.
I trust that some effort will be made to correct this problem before
your paper becomes the Daily Herald which at least was honest about its
Socialist roots.

I WAS most interested in your coverage of the interview with John
Major. Some of your correspondents -- and indeed BBC employees at Queen
Margaret Drive -- seem to be under the impression that the BBC in London
was unaware of the local elections in Scotland.
As your own reporter Anne Johnstone makes clear, this must be untrue
because the elections are specifically mentioned in the leaked memo from
Panorama's deputy editor (April 5).
As a former Panorama producer I was appalled at your publication of
Sandra Liddell's letter (April 5). The clear implication was that
because the Panorama reporter Jane Corbyn is married to John Maples, the
Conservative Party chairman, she influenced the decision to invite John
Major and no other party leader on to Panorama.
The first point and a minor one is that a reporter's opinions are very
unlikely to be sought, let alone acted upon, in such a matter.
The second point is that the letter implies that Jane Corbyn is biased
on the programme. This is untrue and an extremely damaging implication.
She has never been scared to make programmes which have proved
embarrassing to the Government. I could give a number of examples but
one will suffice.
Jane Corbyn has made a number of programmes on the Arms for Iraq or
Iraqi supergun affair. Indeed, she has been one of the foremost
reporters on the subject. These programmes will have caused considerable
embarrassment to the Government. Lord Justice Scott's report will show
whether these programmes were accurate.

JOHN MAJOR blames disunity in the Conservative Party for its dismal
performance in the local council elections. I suggest that the reason is
more fundamental and of greater concern to us all.
In a developed society the provision of good quality health care and
education is essential. Those entering the nursing and teaching
professions have long accepted that they will not earn high salaries,
but expect there to be rewards of a different kind.
Job satisfaction and the knowledge that society has a high regard for
their professional skill and expertise help to maintain morale in these
demanding and stressful careers.
The Government has created a climate of frustration and insecurity in
both the National Health Service and in education, making professional
staff feel undervalued and resentful.
Responsible citizens are aware of the importance to society of health
care and education. Unless the Government shows that it too values those
who work in these essential professions it will not have the respect of
the electorate and will surely be defeated in the next General Election.

WHEN Robbie Dinwoodie and Nic Outterside say the local election
results bore out recent System Three polls for The Herald (April 8),
they are in danger of mimicking some politicians by believing their own
propaganda.
My recollection is that such opinion polls have often put Labour
support at around 53% or 54%, an exaggerated figure significantly
different from their actual share of the vote at 43.7%. Scottish
political commentators rarely, if ever, highlight this point.

A few months after the February, 1974, parliamentary breakthrough the

A few months later in October, 1974, the SNP achieved 30% of the vote

Things have changed when an SNP national vote of 27% can be described

MICHAEL FRY'S analysis of the current parlous state of Conservatism in
Scotland was interesting if not penetrating (April 8). His use of
Prestwick and its International Airport as a metaphor for Tory decline,
however, was woefully misguided.
To suggest that the Conservatives somehow protected Prestwick Airport
in a manner that was inconsistent with their own free-market philosophy
is ludicrous at a time when the Tories are still denying ''open skies''
on freight to the detriment of Scottish business growth.
The truth is that far from cosseting Prestwick Airport, the Tories
have consistently failed seriously to address the challenge of providing
infrastructure which would facilitate the development of a national
integrated transport policy.
This policy failure includes an inability to think strategically about
the operation of all Scotland's airports. It is this national failure
which has led to all the Prestwicks returning Labour councillors all
over the country.
Michael Fry has also failed to do his homework since Prestwick has had
a majority of Labour councillors for a significant part of the last 10
years. Each of these councillors have been active in fighting for a role
for the airport, fettered as it so obviously was by the privatised BAA
plc.
I was actively involved with colleagues at district and regional
council level in forging a public/private sector initiative which
wrested control of the airport from BAA plc and which has ensured that
the international airport remains a significant economic generator
within the Scottish economy.
This kind of development is one which the new Labour Party is pursuing
the length and breadth of Britain. Jurassic Tories like Michael Fry,
meanwhile, continue to demonise Labour and berate an ungrateful
electorate. When will they understand that all of us are hurtling
towards the 21st century while they are pandering about in the 1950s?
Finally, I've got news for Michael Fry. Prestwick is not now nor ever
was ''privileged in its futility''. It has a proud history of wartime
endeavour and continued peacetime success, It continues to send people
and freight around the world and it deserves better than to become the
latest of Michael Fry's fallacies.

IAN BELL'S article on Bob Dylan was an intelligent and compassionate
portrait of a truly great artist (April 10).
More than anyone else in contemporary music Dylan continues on a quest
to dignify the popular song, steadfastly refusing to patronise an
audience who are often several years behind him, or to be distracted by
the limited imagination of music journalists and critics.
Any admirer of Bob Dylan's recorded output in the 1980s will recall
reading vicious review after review and wondering if they were talking
about the same records.
This is a man whose concerns are firstly and foremost to be an artist,
a man with more integrity than we can know.
Who says so? Try Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, and Neil
Young for starters.

IAN BELL's article on Bob Dylan was as lucid as any I have ever read
on Dylan and his art. That Dylan can take his old songs and re-invent
them so beautifully is a source of wonder to me.
Unfortunately many of the audience at the SECC were, in Bell's phrase,
''emotional embalmers'' who insisted on singing along to something that
Dylan was not singing on stage.
Despite the efforts of these ''Gaun yersel' Bob'' chanters, the
concert was a joy. Dylan was in fine voice, the band were tight and
restrained (unlike the 1990 concert), and the sound was almost perfect.
How did it feel? It felt great, once again, to be in the presence of a
great songwriter, a lyricist of real depth and, dare I say it, a genius.
On form like this, Dylan paints a new masterpiece with every
performance, but if you want to hear the hits as they were, stay home
and listen to the albums, and let the rest of us hear Bob singing his
songs.

REGARDING the appearance of siskins in Drumchapel, we have had siskins
at our bird feeders for the past three years. We have also had
infrequent visits from a fieldfare and a redwing.
Recently we saw the arrival of a sparrow-hawk which had flown against
our window. However, after resting a while it recovered and took off.
We have not seen many thrushes over the past years, but magpies are
definitely on the increase.

SISKINS visit my garden daily and have done for many winters (April
10). They vie with greenfinches, great tits, blue tits, and coal tits on
the nut feeders. Siskins are particularly attracted to red-mesh nut
bags.
Less common visitors in my garden are long-tailed tits and bramblings.
The bramblings, having already cleaned out the beech masts, now sit
below the nut feeders waiting for carelessly dropped morsels.

I ENJOYED immensely Gavin Bell's article, Living under a cloud (April
11), about the Knoydart Peninsula.
I first visited Knoydart in 1971 to climb its three splendid Munros.
Within the past five years my wife and I were able to return to Knoydart
on two occasions to walk the superb rights of way which cross the
peninsula. We stayed at the excellent guesthouse at Inverie Pier run by
David and Jan Marriot.
It is indeed a Shangri-La, a mainland place without road access.
The widow of Aeneas MacDonell sold the estate not to an English coal
merchant but to James Baird, the ironmaster of Gartsherrie, Coatbridge.
Indeed, the initials J B and the date 1855 can be seen on the door

UNEMPLOYMENT fell again last month, the nineteenth consecutive fall.
The rate of the fall is, however, slowing so that for the first quarter
of this year it was only half the rate of 1994's last quarter. As with
so much statistical data these figures can be interpreted various ways.
The fall is consistent with the economy slowing down to a sustainable
rate of expansion, but still growing -- the Government's intended
objective through its monetary policy. If that view is taken, it
reinforces the case for doing nothing quickly about lending rates. The
fact that earnings have remained static for a year confirms the
impression that inflationary pressures are still gentle, although the
slowdown in productivity is more worrying.
A more pessimistic view would identify the trend as already presaging
a return to increasing unemployment by next winter. With the present
levels showing that over 8% of the workforce are looking for a job, any
acute slowdown would be extremely unfortunate since it would suggest
that even a well-established recovery cannot bring us back to anything
like full employment (even on Beveridge's famous calculation, which
assumed that 3% unemployment was, in effect, full employment).
The pessimists should take heart from other data about job creation.
Official statistics show that employment (new jobs, that is) grew by
159,000 last year. Although they dismiss such creations as low-quality
and part-time work, many sceptics also regard the actual figures with
marked suspicion (a legacy from the way in which the figures were
constantly ''refined'' during the Thatcher years). Other evidence from
the Labour Force Survey -- based on polling, in this case of a very
large sample, where the normal small margin of error is even slighter --
suggests that job creation last year was double that suggested by the
official figures. If that experience is right, and persists, the present
levels of unemployment, which are still unacceptably high, may well
continue to fall steadily.
How far that will help the Government politically remains to be seen.
Unemployment may have ceased to have the significant power it once
exerted on the public mind. In that respect it has probably been
replaced by fear of unemployment, by a sense of insecurity at the
workplace which can just as easily be a bank, a Civil Service
department, or a retail outlet as a manufacturing business. The mood in
the service economy as well as in the manufacturing one has become
marked by apprehension. Even enhanced productivity and profitability are
no guarantees of job security.
A sense of security has also deserted the housing market, where the
latest evidence is of continuing stagnation. Negative equity, the
position where the likely market price of a house is less than its
mortgage, up to six years, is disappearing, but about one million
households are still affected. It ought to be reducing all the time, at
least for those with capital repayment mortgages, which are still the
most common, for there the outstanding debt reduces steadily, if slowly.
There has been a creeping improvement in house prices (although even
that may have ended or reversed marginally according to some building
societies' findings). But it is anyhow certain to be a long process, and
one not helped by the steady cuts in mortgage interest relief imposed by
the Government and endorsed by housing experts and the Opposition.
There seems little hope that the housing market will revive enough to
help Tory fortunes, but there may yet be public benefits from blighted
hopes and burned fingers if we all reduce the size of our savings
committed to housing and consider placing them elsewhere. The
combination of high inflation and tax relief made home ownership almost
too attractive. If that era has gone, and that is not yet clear, then we
may more readily fund the productive investment (now beginning to take
place, incidentally) that politicians of all parties insistently call
for. Again, that is a long process whose consequences will be apparent
only at the millennium, if even then.
The net effect of these movements may be collectively beneficial, and
the Chancellor may even receive congratulations, to the extent that he
is perceived to have helped, but the one certain thing about such
developments is that they belong well into the future.

IT WOULD be interesting to plot the social status of a sun tan against
the demand for package holidays. Sun tans were certainly not fashionable
in Jane Austen's day, when parasols were regarded as vital. A century
later, when poet Laurence Hope (in real life, the wife of a general)
wrote of the pale hands he loved beside the Shalimar, the only British
women with brown complexions were field workers. It was probably
sea-bathing that brought the change. When Victorians at last took to the
water, a fashion book of the 1870s recommended 10 yards of heavy flannel
for a lady's swimsuit. Even Mack Sennett's bathing beauties wore
protective hats and rolled stockings. American women began to bare their
backs in the 1940s, but when the bikini arrived in 1946, named after the
Pacific island of the US nuclear tests, it still caused a sensation.
For our own young ladies, alas, the problem was the weather. Bikinis
are admirable garments, but not at their best when worn with
goose-pimples. It was the bikini, and its all-over sun tan, that became
the despair of the British Tourist Authority. The latest figures show
that, whereas in 1955 93% of British family holidays were spent in the
UK, this had fallen to 70% 10 years ago and is now running at slightly
less than half. The 400,000 foreigners who take summer holidays in
Blackpool even include 10,000 Arabs, yet British holiday-makers want to
spend more and more of their time in the sun.
The best hope for the holiday industry seems to be that what is
fashionable for one generation is usually rejected by the next. If
today's tourists court sunburn, their children may well seek frostbite.
Among the more expensive holidays already on offer is a 29-day
semi-circumnavigation of Antarctica, in the middle of winter, from #7995
a person. At the other end of the world, the Russian Navy is offering
cruises on its Murmansk ice-breakers and nuclear submarines. The key to
success seems to be the human desire to be different. In sweltering New
Delhi, where a thin sari was once the height of elegance, the best
hotels now have their air-conditioning set low so that lady guests can
wear fur coats.

LIFE must seem dark indeed -- the tunnel ahead must look not just
gloomy but interminable. There will be no more local elections in
Scotland till 1999. But is there even a glimmer of light at the end of
the tunnel? The answer to that must surely depend on whether you are
able to use this setback as an opportunity to listen, to take real
stock, to be honest to your own best traditions and to the people of
Scotland, and to be ready for change. The Christian view has always been
that times of darkness offer the best chance of honest self-examination,
a degree of repentance, and conversion.
I am not a member of any party, and I have no difficulty in
recognising the real contribution Conservatives have made historically,
both as individuals and as a party, in local government and in your past
commitment to real devolution. It is not all that long since a
Conservative Prime Minister promised us that, if the last attempt to
secure a Scottish Assembly was defeated, he would rapidly offer us a
better scheme. The descent from that promise to the insults of ''teenage
madness'' is a measure of your decline. Those who sow the wind will reap
the whirlwind.
If I admit to being delighted with the results of elections just held,
it is not because I oppose your party but because the people of Scotland
have spoken, with unmistakable clarity, on an issue which is both local
and national, and is crucial for all of us -- the issue of democracy
itself, and our right to be governed with consent.
The first thing you must do is to face the truth, and scotch the
myths. We know -- and you know -- that your dilemma had nothing whatever
to do with divisions at Westminster or over Europe -- questions that
leave most Scots agog with apathy.
We know -- and you know -- that this was not the result of any failure
to get your policies across. We are not stupid: we understand them only
too well.
We know -- and I hope you know -- that the real reasons for Scotland's
outrage go much deeper into our psyche and our history than these glib
excuses allow.
At one level, it is the simple message: ''We will no longer be pushed
around.'' Scotland's chronic problem is not the lack of a ''feel-good''
factor so much as that of a ''feel-heard'' factor. All the gut issues
that were raised on the doorsteps -- water, education, quangos, health,
and the further weakening of local government itself -- flow together to
make one mighty river of protest at a system that seems deaf to what we
say and blind to what we need. That river is what has swept you away.
That river has even deeper sources. It rises in our historic
constitutional traditions as a nation. The three ''Claims of Right'' in
Scottish history, including that which founded the Constitutional
Convention in 1989, all upheld the sovereign right of the people to
determine their future, and denied the idolatrous claim of the Crown in
Parliament to absolute power. As one Commissioner colourfully described
it in the Kirk's General Assembly in 1989, ''In the Declaration of
Arbroath, they said to Robert the Bruce 'You may be the king, but you
dae as ye're telt, or ye're on the burroo'.''
On April 6, the people of Scotland said: ''You may be the Government,
but you listen to the people, or you're out.'' They proved again -- if
any further proof were needed -- that a Scottish Parliament is now, as
the late John Smith said, ''the settled will of the people''. The debate
on the third option is over; the status quo of the most centralised
unitary state in Europe is no longer sustainable. The debate is between
those who want a renewed, healthier, and more democratic Union (which
most of Scotland's people seem to want) and those who choose the way of
an independent nation state.
That is the real choice -- for you too! It is time for you to return
to your own roots -- to go back to your traditional support for the
devolution of real power. It is time for you to tell your colleagues in
Government that the principles of self-determination and consent, which
they recognise in Northern Ireland, are inadvisable. They apply to
Scotland too.
The temptation to say ''I told you so'' is too strong for me to
resist, for I did, again and again. In Scotland on several occasions,
and in Brussels, I am on record as warning the Conservatives that their
decline would continue in Scotland, until they recognise the need for
constitutional change -- and probably only in a Scottish Parliament
itself. Paradoxically, the Scottish legislature you have so vehemently
opposed offers you the best chance of a future.
Not only will its election by a more proportional system give you fair
representation, but the taint of your identification with a party which
seems to be veering ever further in the direction of a narrow English
nationalism will be overcome.
You probably cannot persuade the Prime Minister to change course on
this issue. He has committed himself too completely, and very unwisely,
to the unsustainable theory that any move towards self-government will
be the slippery slope to the end of civilisation as we have known it. To
call the Constitutional Convention's proposals for Scotland's future
''one of the most dangerous propositions ever put before the British
nation'' is evidence of a leader who has lost touch not just with the
people, but with reality.
What you might be able to do, however, is to raise the tone of the
debate. Tell your friends in the south to replace the insults with
arguments, and to replace the myths with facts.
Our scheme is well thought out, and detailed -- but I can accept that
there is a case to be made against it. What I cannot accept is the
resort to misrepresentation and mendacity: the grotesque myth that
Scotland's Parliament will add 20p to Income Tax, or drive business
away, or that it will draw power away from local government. By all
means, debate with us -- but please do so, and ensure your colleagues do
so, with integrity and honesty and face to face, rather than shouting
political abuse through megaphones from the barricades.
Conservatives have played a legitimate role in our past. I believe you
can do so again -- in Scotland's democratic Parliament.

AS Alice Somerville resignedly puts it she and her husband, Jacob,
will be ''tied and quartered'' after the introduction today of the new
incapacity benefit scheme. For the past 16 years Jacob, 56, has been
unable to work because of chronic heart trouble, Meniere's disease,
asthma, and series of strokes. Three years ago Alice fell victim to ME
and no longer has the strength even to cook.
Even so, under the new scheme that tots up incapacity points and rolls
up millions in savings for the Social Security budget, the couple from
Mount Vernon fear that what state benefits they currently enjoy will be
withdrawn. Bleak though their situation already is, it could yet be
worse.
''If I am one of the unfortunate ones who fails to tot up sufficient
points we could lose the lot,'' says Alice. ''The house would go. We
would have no food and who would pay for our electricity? My stomach is
churning at the thought.''
Alice, 54, does not reckon that she will score well under the new
system. It is, she says, a Catch-22 situation. ''They tell you to try
and help yourself but that is a fallacy. Stress is not good for either
of us and I try not to worry, but . . .''
The Somervilles' plight is this: 16 years ago Jacob, an engineer
working in the food-machinery industry and then a sales manager, fell
ill, his condition linked to a bout of rheumatic fever as a boy. As his
medical difficulties mounted he was deemed to be entitled to long-term
invalidity benefit under the sickness and invalidity benefits scheme
that operated until midnight last night.
Currently he receives #66.65 a week invalidity benefit, a further
#31.50 for what is termed ''middle-rate'' care allowance and, in
addition, #32.50 a week mobility allowance . . . #130.35 in all to pay
his way and run that essential car. Says Alice: ''The prognosis for
Jacob is very poor. He has had three open-heart operations and four
strokes. The doctors will not operate further because of his condition.
He needs help during the night.''
Alice is scarcely in a position to give it. With Jacob forced to stay
at home by ill health, she strove to make up the family budget, working
until three years ago for a firm of quantity surveyors as an
administrator and personal assistant. She was 16 years with the same
firm. Then she was struck down by ME.
''I was literally flattened. People spoke to me about ME making me
feel tired but I could not relate what I had to tiredness. I could not
write. I could not move. I try to pick myself up but even yet I cannot
go out and shop and I cannot cook,'' she says.
The Somervilles have one child, a daughter, Alison, who works as a
nurse. Last August she married and moved away from home, keeping in
daily contact by telephoning if she cannot come round to help which she
does, her mother says, practically every day.
''I have to say that we are not really managing now since our daughter
married and moved. I cannot vacuum, do the garden or clean the windows.
All these activities now have to be paid for and we are thinking about
getting a home-help -- for which we would also have to pay.''
Alice, still very dependent as a result of her ME, receives #88.18 a
week invalidity benefit . . . a greater sum that her husband simply
because he had insufficient payments to SERPS, having had to give up
work 16 years ago.
Says Alice: ''That money is all I receive from the state but there are
other sums -- and that's the difficulty. I was enrolled in a personal
health scheme at work and, in addition, took out a mortgage protection
policy. Both of these operate because of my invalidity allowance. But
if, under the new scheme, I do not measure up, I would no longer get
state aid. The two private schemes -- the personal health and morgage
protection policies -- would also cease to pay out. That is why we would
lose the lot. We would be homeless. Government urges you to stand on
your own feet, to help yourself, and that is what we have done. But now,
because the rules have been changed, there is nothing we can do . . .
we have not much choice.''
Mrs Somerville has written to the office administering the disability
living allowance to ask for a higher grade of care allowance for her
husband. The top rate is #44 a week and, believes Alice Somerville, if
that can be achieved the threat posed by the incapacity benefit measure
of points would be removed. So far she has had no reply.
Meantime she and her husband dread having to get to grips with the
20-page questionnaire that seeks to establish their incapacity to work
and the  point-scoring schedule that goes with it. The professional
opinion of the Somervilles' GP will no longer be sufficient to ensure
that they do not have to win their daily bread back in the workplace. It
will be the points that count.
As Alice Somerville, MS sufferer and wife of a man now so frail that
further operations on his heart are ruled out, puts it: ''We will both
be tied and quartered.''
They tell you to try and help yourself but that is a fallacy.

The Government's new incapacity benefits scheme, which came into force
at midnight, could have a devastating effect for those in
ill health
IF you are suffering terminal illness or dementia, are in a persistent
vegetative state or are registered blind, this article does not concern
you. Under the new incapacity benefit scheme that came into force this
morning, you will not have to undergo a rigorous test to ascertain your
need for financial support from the state. You will get the cash -- less
of it, mark you, and taxable if you are a new claimant -- but some cash
none the less.
Should you not, however, be counted among the above categories of
suffering -- and a number of others such as severe and progressive
neurological or muscle-wasting disease, dense paralysis of the upper
limb, severe learning difficulties or paraplegia -- brace yourself for
the cold blast of Government parsimony in the shape of a points scoring
system operated by Civil Service clerks and the rule that if you can do
a job, any job, you must get off the incapacity register, get on your
bike, and put your name down at the job shop.
No matter that, a labourer before ill health struck, you are no longer
fit for heavy manual work. Just polish up your skills as a pastry cook.
Formerly a seamstress who can no longer focus on the fine detail? No
problem, there may be a job for you out there humping coal.
Oddly, given that the points tests have not yet been carried out, the
Government is able to estimate that eventually fully 200,000 people --
that is around one in five claimants -- will be excluded from the new
incapacity benefit and will be expected to sign on as unemployed . . .
job seekers with a handicap. Savings to the public purse, say Government
spokesmen, will run to #550m in the first year with a further #1450m
being won back for other Government schemes in the second year of the
new points-driven scheme.
How does it work? The reduction in numbers eligible to claim
incapacity benefit -- hitherto sickness and invalidity benefit -- will
be achieved largely through the operation of a new, tougher, test of
incapacity which focuses exclusively on functional limitations. Under
the system that faded into oblivion at midnight an assessment of
incapacity also took into account other relevant factors such as age and
education, stress and strain, severity of illness, employment history,
and work skills. No longer.
And no longer room for the role of the general practitioner who,
hitherto, certified his or her patient's unfitness to follow their own
occupation. Now it will be Benefits Agency staff who will make the
ruling and that on the basis of a person's fitness for any type of work.
Thus is the GP's role as a custodian of the patient's health bypassed in
favour of a clerk with a score sheet, calculator, and the imperative to
trim the claimant's roll.
Let us look at the point-scoring system. It deals wholly and solely
with categories of functional limitation -- walking, the ability to
climb stairs, sitting, standing, lifting and carrying, vision, hearing,
manual dexterity and so on, and apparently out there on its own,
continence.
The incapacity for work questionnaire, which runs to 20 pages, has to
be filled in by the claimants themselves and sent in. The points table
has 105 separate headings. Part 2, which deals with walking up and down
stairs, gives a good general impression of the style of the document as
a whole -- and gives a fascinating insight into the collective
Government and Civil Service mind behind its composition.
Question 2 (a) asks for a tick, or not, against ''cannot walk up and
down one stair'', question 2 (b) asks ''cannot walk up and down a flight
of 12 stairs'' -- the interrogation going on through various
permutations involving ''holding on and taking a rest'' to ''can only
walk up and down a flight of 12 stairs if he goes sideways or one step
at a time''. There is, presumably, Government knowledge of a job where
just such a handicap is a qualification.
Even those who manage to score sufficiently to satisfy a Benefits
Agency clerk will find that things ain't what they used to be. The level
of benefit payments will be reduced in a number of ways -- notably
abolishing for new claimants the earnings-related pension; limiting the
age allowance to people under 45 rather than up to age 60 as before;
abolishing increases for dependants except where the partner is over age
60 or looking after children.
People already on invalidity benefit or sickness benfit will
automatically be transferred on to the new incapacity benefit which will
have three levels of payment. The old sickness benefit has become
''short-term incapacity benefit -- lower rate'' which, after the
recipient has been 28 weeks on the roll, is transformed into
''short-term incapacity benefit -- higher rate''. The final step, after
a total of 52 weeks in receipt of state funds is ''long-term incapacity
benefit''. Benefit for current recipients will continue to be tax-free
but new claimants will pay tax on what they receive.
What this will mean in cash terms has been worked out by the
Disablement Income Group Scotland which has been to the fore in opposing
the new scheme. Their example is of a 49-year-old married man (wife
under 60) with no children. Under the old scheme he would have received
#99.70 a week plus earnings-related additional pension -- tax free. Now
a claimant in these circumstances would receive after the 28-week period
-- that is to say ''short-term incapacity benefit -- higher rate'' --
just #52.50 a week, taxable. The net loss exceeds #31 a week.
A guide to incapacity benefit issued earlier this year by the Benefits
Agency -- described on the front page without apparent irony as an
Executive Agency of the Department of Social Security -- runs to 26
pages. It states: ''You will be tested for incapacity for work over the
next three years unless you are in an exempt category. Benefit will
continue to be paid until you are tested and will stop if you are
capable of working.'' Explaining changes in the way incapacity for work
will be tested, the guide introduces the phrase ''the all work test''.
''The all work test'' lies at the heart of the new regime -- targeted,
the Government claims, at confounding those who swing the lead and claim
on the state when they are well able to get by on their own account. The
disabled, sloughed from the unemployment register when slimmed-down
figures were politically expedient and sent to survive on the sickness
and invalidity benefits scheme are now being forced back on the labour
market following the introduction of a new and tougher regime to cope
with the unemployed . . . now job seekers.
But with incapacity benefit, a blunt instrument likely to come down
hard on the genuinely sick, disabled and vulnerable, there are already
signs that the new scheme, like that of the embattled Child Support
Agency, could yet prove to be an unwieldly sledgehammer wielded to crack
an insignificant nut.

Pretoria, Wednesday
SOUTH African President Nelson Mandela said today he was reinstating
his estranged wife Winnie as deputy Arts Minister because her sacking
two weeks ago was invalid.
Mandela, who is visiting the Gulf, said in a statement issued on his
behalf by his deputy Thabo Mbeki in Pretoria that Mrs Mandela's
dismissal should be treated ''as technically and procedurally invalid''.
She had been informed she was still the deputy Minister of Arts,
Culture, Science, and Technology.
''The president, upon his return, will reconsider her position as
deputy Minister afresh,'' said Mbeki.
He added that when Mandela sacked his wife on March 27, the president
''believed, in good faith, that all the requisite persons had been
informed as required by the constitution''.However there was uncertainty
over whether the consultation was adequate.
Mbeki said the president wished to spare the government and the nation
the uncertainties which might follow protracted ligitation and had
decided to reinstate Mrs Mandela, reversing the appointment of her
succcessor Brigitte Mabandla.
Mrs Mandela, separated from her husband since 1992, launched a court
action on Monday to declare her dismissal from his government of
national unity unlawful and unconstitutional.
Mandela's main black political opponent, Inkatha Freedom Party leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who is the president's partner in the national
unity government, had complained he should have been consulted on the
sacking in terms of the constitution.
Mrs Mandela, a frequent critic of her husband's government, said her
rights had been violated by her sacking and demanded to know the grounds
for her dismissal.
A government source said Mrs Mandela's successor was told today she
would have to step aside until the president could properly complete the
formality of sacking his wife.
University of Cape Town political scientist Robert Schrire said the
incident would seriously dent the president's credibility.
''It makes him look very amateurish and stupid and it's a great moral
victory for Mrs Mandela,'' he said.
Mrs Mandela, one of a so-called gang of five radical leaders in the
African National Congress, claims wide support among young blacks in
South Africa's poor townships.
Mandela has not said why he fired her last mmonths of majority rule,
but ANC and government sources have said the main reason was her
defiance of an instruction to cancel a visit to West Africa earlier this
year.
Mrs Mandela, who has not commented publicly on her sacking or
reinstatement, has been dogged by controversy for the past few years.
Mandela, 76, and his wife, 60, parted after she was convicted in 1992
of the kidnapping and assault of black children during the
anti-apartheid struggle.--Reuter.

John Linklater examines the latest theory.
WAS Hitler murdered? The latest claim has a weary inevitability about
it, because history has tried just about every other means to get its
most universally reviled subject into his grave, without even managing
to keep him there. Hitler, as his first biography unintentionally
prophesised, has had more final days, more different theories of his
death, than the century can afford.
If historian Hugh Thomas was simply working the permutations to kindle
a new controversy with his Hitler murder theory he could rightly be
dismissed as an irresponsible opportunist. But in a book to be published
on April 24 he has gathered together an impressive weight of forensic
evidence, piecing together material that has been held separately in
Soviet, American and British archives. As a consulting surgeon, with
considerable forensic expertise, he has greater authority than any
Western historian confronting the question of how Hitler met his death.
He has worked by process of elimination, because not one of the
various Hitler suicide scenarios makes any sense, when set alongside
detailed Soviet records of the two extensive post-mortems carried out on
the charred, but by no means obliterated, remains of Hitler retrieved
from the Berlin Bunker in May 1945. Thomas claims to have uncovered
evidence of several layers of forensic fraud.
The various versions of Hitler's alleged suicide should already have
aroused the greatest suspicion. The consensus version since the 1960s
has been that Hitler died by shooting himself through the mouth and
simultaneously biting on a glass capsule of cyanide. This has a
staggering implausibility, not least in terms of the superfluousness of
the double method.
Blowing one's brains out is usually sufficient to guarantee
termination. So is a single lethal dose of cyanide, a capsule of
Zyankali in this case, the same as established the cyanide poisonings of
Josef Goebbels, his wife Magda, and their six children (with attendant
bruising, a gruesome indication of their struggle) in the Soviet
post-mortem records.
The logistical absurdity confronting this version is how would Hitler
have thrust the barrel of the pistol in his mouth (allegedly a 7.65
Walther revolver) and still manage to bite down on the cyanide capsule?
To meet this objection, a modified version (recycled in a recent
newspaper serialisation) attempts to demonstrate that Hitler shot
himself from under his chin while biting the capsule. Thomas ridicules
it as the ''shoot-and-bite technique''.
It faces another problem. There is no supporting evidence in the
Soviet post-mortem records of the massive damage to the lower skull and
jaw that would follow such a method, unless the bullet travelled by as
miraculous a flight as that single bullet alleged to have killed
President John Kennedy.
In fact, the available evidence resists co-operation with any of the
Hitler suicide theories. Evidence of cyanide was found in the mouth, but
not in any of the organs or tissues. This was not the case with the
bodies of the Goebbels family, or with the examined body of Hitler's
alsatian bitch, Blondi, poisoned as a test for the cyanide capsules. The
Soviet pathologists found the familiar bitter-almond pungency rising
under the scalpels, and tests confirmed cyanide.
The conclusion, avoided for some reason, was that a cyanide capsule
was placed in the mouth of Hitler after his death to simulate poisoning.
Had his body been consumed to ashes in the hastily organised pyre in the
Bunker garden on the night of April 30, 1945, this fraud would have been
better concealed. But why was any fraud carried out?
Before answering this question, it is necessary to confront another
disconcerting fact: the absence of blood. It has puzzled examiners why
the Bunker sitting room, where the bodies of Hitler and Eva Braun were
found, should reveal no traces of blood spattering or brains. A small
patch of blood was found on the sofa arm rest, inconsistent with a gun
wound, and another patch of blood was found on the mattress and bedframe
in Hitler's bedroom.
Traces failed to connect the blood with either of the bodies found
buried in the Bunker garden. Yet the testimonies of the witnesses who
found the bodies insist that a shot was fired and Eva Braun was found
poisoned.
These testimonies present the biggest problem of all, because they are
hopelessly contradictory. The eye-witnesses just could not agree where
their Fuhrer had pointed the gun when he shot himself. It is a detail
one might have hoped the witnesses would have managed to agree. They
might have eventually, but for a habit of continually changing their
stories.
Thus it was that SS Sturmbannfuhrer Erich Kempka, personal chauffeur
to Hitler, gave the first account on record, in an interview with Life
magazine. He had it that Hitler shot himself through the right temple
and Eva Braun shot herself through the heart. He changed this to Hitler
shooting himself through the mouth and Eva Braun taking a cyanide
capsule.
This was in an interview with Hugh Trevor-Roper, then acting as a
British intelligence officer, and this version went into Trevor-Roper's
immediate post-war study, The Last Days of Hitler, still regarded as an
authoritative account. Kempka admitted in the 1970s that he had told all
of his interrogators exactly what he thought they wanted to hear. He
also suddenly remembered that he had not, in fact, been present in the
Bunker when Hitler's body was found.
Hans Baur, Hitler's pilot, popped up in 1955 after his release from
Soviet captivity with the unpromising version that Hitler and Eva Braun
both shot themselves. Another witness released at the same time was
Heinz Linge, Hitler's personal valet.
His story, told to the News of The World, was that he heard no shot,
but saw a ''whiff of smoke'' coming from the sitting-room door of the
Bunker. He went in and found Hitler sitting upright with a small blood
mark on his left temple, the 7.65 revolver on the floor at his right
hand side and Eva Braun dead beside him on the sofa.
He modified this slightly later to talk about a slightly larger wound
to the right temple, and ''strong fumes'' coming from the door. Smoke or
fumes, it was an odd claim since Linge was discussing a smoke-resistant
fire door.
The Soviets, it emerged in the release of records obtained by Thomas
in 1992, had been highly suspicious of Linge. He had been interrogated
during 1945 and 1946 in sessions of up to nine hours at night, and
denied sleep. He told his cell mate, a Soviet plant, a German called
''Bemen'', that he would never crack. Only he and Martin Bormann,
Hitler's private secretary, knew the truth.
That truth, according to Thomas, is that Linge murdered Hitler and
immediately reported to Bormann with the words, ''It's done, Minister''.
The phrase had already been given in testimony by Linge, but not the
context. He admitted using these words to confirm the completion of the
suicides. The SS personnel in the Bunker had been waiting since the
early hours of April 30, 1945, for Hitler to finish the job and let them
get on with preparing their escapes as the Soviets advanced from two
blocks away.
There is an incongruous note in Trevor-Roper's book when he describes
the dance and party that started spontaneously in the canteen of the
Chancellery when it was learned that Hitler was preparing his suicide.
Other accounts note that the mood changed when, more than 12 hours
later, Hitler was conducting repeat rounds of farewells. The implication
was obvious. Had the Fuhrer got cold feet?
Thomas admits that his reconstruction of the events which followed is
speculation. He presents his murder scenario as an exasperated response
of the SS personnel to Hitler's apparent prevarication.
He argues: ''I defend this exercise on the grounds that, as it is at
least based on a background of forensic data, as an alternative it
cannot be less truthful or less accurate than the story accepted to
date.'' Thomas accepts that it is based on ''supposed logic'' and is
liable to ridicule, but adds: ''I am nevertheless convinced that even a
ridiculed alternative is better than a discredited historical fiction.''
His thesis is that Linge strangled Hitler when he failed to use either
the cyanide capsule offered him, or the Army revolver. It was an act of
desperation as time was running out. The decrepit, prematurely-aged
Fuhrer, was too ill with Parkinson's Disease to offer much resistance,
is overcome. The cyanide capsule was inserted by forceps into the mouth
and broken to simulate poisoning. The body was taken above for
cremation. The SS personnel tried to make their various escapes through
the capitulating city, some successfully.
A final sting is in the tail. The body cremated alongside Hitler was
not that of Eva Braun, according to Thomas. It was a woman who had
already died of shrapnel wounds, and who was prepared as a double. This
body also had a cyanide capsule broken in the mouth to simulate
poisoning, but the forensic records show that nothing of the poison was
ingested.
She also had dental bridgework that had been prepared for Eva Braun,
and which accorded with Braun's genuine dental records, inserted in her
mouth. Confusingly, Eva Braun had already staged an attention-seeking
suicide demonstration by slitting her wrists, hence the traces of blood
in the sitting room and bedroom of the Bunker. What the real Eva Braun's
fate was, Thomas does not speculate. He does not believe she had
sufficient instinct to survive after the fraud.
This is not entirely new ground for Thomas. It was he who claimed that
the man who died in Spandau was not Rudolf Hess but another
doppelganger, prompting a Scotland Yard inquiry, with the findings never
released.
A combative historian, he attacks establishment consensus, with an
intelligent scepticism and a forensic expertise gained with the Royal
Army Medical Corps in Belfast and Berlin, where he came upon the alleged
Hess fraud which he argued in two books in 1979 and 1988.
He is happy to call himself ''Thomas the doubter''. Ironically, it was
Stalin who contributed to the mystery over Hitler's death, because he
continually rejected the evidence presented after two extensive
post-mortem inquiries. Stalin was obsessed that Hitler had escaped, and
there is evidence in the Soviet records of further layers of fraud to
produce more conclusive findings of the suicide to appease Uncle Joe.
Similarly, Trevor-Roper was under considerable pressure from the British
side to present conclusive evidence that Hitler was safely dead.
The consequence on both sides was to create a suicide scenario based
on shaky evidence, ignoring forensic findings if they did not support
the conclusion that had become a political imperative. This, after all,
was a battle against the creation of the Hitler myth. Only the day after
Hitler was found dead, Admiral Donitz was broadcasting over the radio to
the German people that Hitler had been killed leading his troops in the
battle to defend Berlin. In the face of this, evidence had to be made
secondary to expediency. Fifty years later the suspicion of a Hitler
murder has some potency.

Los Angeles, Wednesday
THE judge in the O J Simpson murder trial was not impressed with an
ousted juror's claim that a white juror kicked her and stamped on
another black juror's foot, according to court documents.
Superior Court Judge Lance Ito told lawyers he would interview
dismissed juror Jeanette Harris and the two other jurors and might talk
to each juror individually in private.
''That people being outraged and offended by somebody perhaps crossing
over them and inadvertently hitting them -- I mean, this initially
struck me as something so trivial to be unbelievable,'' Ito said.
Harris was subpoenaed to meet privately with the judge after further
testimony by police criminalist Dennis Fung.
Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark also played down Harris's
allegation and made a dig at her.
''Let's not forget, this is also the woman who claimed that another
juror pushed her,'' she said.
Harris was dismissed April 5 because she failed to disclose during
jury selection that she had been involved in a marital abuse case,
claiming her husband pushed her.
Yesterday the defence filed a motion seeking an investigation into
whether prosecutors are trying to ''engineer a mistrial'' through the
dismissal of jurors. The prosecution denied the allegation.
The motion said Simpson should be released if the number of jurors
falls below 12 and prosecutors should be barred from trying him again.
In court today, defence lawyer Barry Scheck resumed a vigorous
cross-examination of Fung, the criminalist who directed the collection
of evidence at the scene of the killings, and at Simpson's estate.
Simpson, a former football star who remained in the spotlight after
leaving the game by working an actor and TV sports commentator, denies
killing his ex-wife and one of her friends.--AP.

Paris, Wednesday
A NEW wave of union unrest swept France today as workers frustrated by
wage freezes, high unemployment, and broken political promises
manoeuvred to take advantage of coming presidential elections to win
concessions.
Among the targets were Michelin, the tyre-maker, which was hit by
protests after reporting a return to profitability yesterday, carmaker
Renault, and the oil giant Elf Aquitaine, which has announced plans to
sack 300 workers and shut down unprofitable petrol stations.
Worse disruption was expected tomorrow when Paris public transport
workers will strike on the Metro, suburban train, and bus services, and
France Telecom public telephone employees stage a one-day strike.
Analysts see the strikes as most damaging to conservative Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur ahead of the two-stage April 23-May 7
election. As Prime Minister for two years, he is the main focus of
workers' anger.
For his conservative rival, front-runner and Paris mayor Jacques
Chirac, the unrest has become an opportunity to drive home his message
that pay rises are not the enemy of jobs.--Reuter.

Jerusalem, Wednesday
PALESTINIAN police arrested more Islamic militants today as Hamas and
Islamic Jihad members vowed to defy the PLO's crackdown in the Gaza
Strip.
Diab Al-Louh, Palestinian self-rule authority spokesman, said up to
300 militants had been arrested.
Palestinians said many supporters of the radical Hamas and Islamic
Jihad groups, which oppose the 1993 PLO-Israeli peace accord, stayed
away from their homes to avoid detention.
Tonight the authority took its campaign against the militants abroad,
issuing a statement saying Hamas's ''practical leadership'' was in
Jordan.
It took exception to a Hamas leaflet criticising the crackdown issued
in Amman yesterday and said: ''We complained to the official channels in
Jordan more than once on the highest levels, and every time we get
promises and assurances to stop them (leaflets) and to charge the people
behind them.''
The crackdown in Gaza followed an attack on Sunday by Islamist suicide
bombers which killed seven Israeli soldiers and one US citizen.
The bombings have piled more pressure on Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, who rejected hard-liners' charges that the Israeli-PLO
accord had encouraged the suicide missions.
''To attribute the suicide attacks to the Oslo agreement (between
Israel and the PLO) is a lie,'' Rabin told members of his Labour party
faction in a special briefing.
Rabin has said until PLO head Yasser Arafat curbs militants, there
will be no movement on next stages of their peace deal.
Arafat's administration, saying it would partially disarm the militant
opposition, announced locations where Gazans should bring their weapons
for registration.
However Israel Radio reported at midday today that no-one had showed
up.
''The weapons are not present in stores, they are present in the hands
of true fighters. They will not give up their weapons,'' said Hamas
leader Mahmoud al-Zahhar.
PLO and Islamic officials rejected claims that Arafat's most intensive
crackdown of his 10-month-old rule in Gaza would lead to civil war, but
some militants warned that confrontation loomed.
''We are not seeking that, but we are afraid that things will get out
of hand. These arrests have begun to take a serious and dangerous
form,'' Zahhar said.
Speaking later at a memorial service at Gaza's Shati refugee camp for
one of Sunday's suicide bombers, Zahhar demanded Arafat end arrests,
drop the disarmament campaign, stop negotiations with Israel, and begin
talks with Palestinian factions.
He said Hamas had sent Arafat a letter and awaited a reply.
Israel Police Minister Moshe Shahal said all Palestinian entry would
be barred from tomorrow until Sunday, the start of the seven-day Jewish
holiday of Passover.--Reuter.

Frankfurt, Wednesday
THE trader at the centre of the Barings Bank collapse, Nick Leeson,
seems likely to remain in a German jail until later this year as he
fights to avoid extradition to Singapore, according to a German
prosecutor.
The prosecutor, Hans-Hermann Eckert, said Leeson's lawyers have stated
they will fight the formal extradition request from Singapore, due by
May 2 before a Hesse high court in Frankfurt.
''The end of June is the earliest date that he could be extradited,
and that is only if the request were not challenged and not
complicated,'' Eckert said. ''But I am sure that it will take much
longer, likely until autumn, because he will fight the request.''
Leeson, 28, blamed for risky Japanese stock futures trading from
Singapore, derivatives, which lost the bank millions, told officials he
would resist being returned to Singapore.
By refusing the initial extradition request, Leeson will force
Singapore to try him only for charges in the extradition request
approved by the German court.
Leeson's German lawyer, Eberhard Kempf, has indicated he will fight
the extradition request on human-rights grounds, alleging Leeson would
face an ''absurd'' prison term if returned to Singapore and convicted.
Leeson has been hoping for a rival extradition request from Britain,
where probes are under way into the London bank. But Britain has
inidicated it will not seek his extradition.
Until a decision is made on Singapore's request, Leeson will stay in a
German jail in the Frankfurt suburb of Hoechst where he has been since
being held at Frankfurt airport on March 2.--REUTER.

THE Safeway poisoner, Dr Paul Agutter, is to appeal against his
conviction and 12-year jail sentence.
The former university lecturer's grounds for appeal were lodged at the
Justiciary Office at the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday, but no date
has yet been fixed for a hearing.
Agutter, 48, who lectured in biochemistry at Napier University in
Edinburgh, was convicted by a High Court jury in February this year of
an ''evil and ingenious'' plot to murder his wife, Alex, 39, at their
home at Kilduff Lodge, Athelstaneford, East Lothian, on August 28 last
year.
He put a large dose of the deadly poison, atropine, in her gin and
tonic and tried to cover his tracks by placing contaminated bottles of
tonic on the shelves of a Safeway supermarket at Hunter's Tryst in
Edinburgh.
Several Safeway customers became seriously ill after drinking the
poisoned tonic and shelves had to be cleared in a nationwide safety
alert.
Trial judge Lord Morison told Agutter: ''This was an evil and
cunningly-devised crime which was not only designed to bring about the
death of your wife but also caused great alarm, danger, and injury to
the public.''

A PETROL station assistant who was accused of passing forged banknotes
has been awarded #4850 compensation for her unfair sacking.
Mrs Margaret Law, 28, of Loch Leven Terrace, Kelty, Fife, denied that
she had knowingly passed two forged #20 notes and a #50 note at petrol
stations run by OCTO Petroleum Services Ltd of Brechin.
An industrial tribunal in Dundee heard that she had worked at Black
Douglas Filling Station, at Rumbling Well, Dunfermline.
She was sacked after she had paid for goods at Kelty Filling Station,
while she was off duty, with a #20 note which it was later claimed was
counterfeit.
At the tribunal, she strongly denied any knowledge of these banknotes
being counterfeit.
The tribunal heard that she had been charged by police but was found
not guilty.
In their findings, the tribunal said the company had carried out
little in the way of any investigation.
There was no evidence before the company that she was guilty of
passing forged banknotes. Her position was that she was simply an
innocent bystander and the company had made no attempt to put the
allegations to her or to get her version of events.
The tribunal ruled that her sacking was unfair and awarded her a total
of #4850 compensation for loss of earnings.

<RECORDNO>978911531</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A THIRD significant annual reduction of recorded crime, and record
clear-up rates, were reported yesterday by Mr William Wilson, chief
constable of Central Scotland Police.
Mr Wilson became the second senior police officer to reject claims
that Scottish police forces were recording crime inaccurately and
over-estimating clear-up rates. His dismissal of a report in an
Edinburgh newspaper, which stated that the conduct of the police forces
was forcing the Government to ''press for stricter national rules on
recording statistics'', was endorsed by Mr John Boyd, HM Chief Inspector
of Constabulary in Scotland.
Speaking to The Herald, Mr Boyd described the report as ''an insult to
the integrity of honest Scottish policemen who are doing their best to
combat crime''.
What had happened, Mr Boyd said, was that small differences between
forces in the interpretation of guidelines on recording some crimes, had
been spotted during inspections and these had been pointed out to police
forces.
The working party allegedly set up to investigate was in fact part of
the Criminal Justice Statistics Committee, a middle-management body
drawn from Crown Office, Scottish Office, and the police forces, which
kept these matters under review and which was currently undertaking a
normal review of the Criminal Statistics Handbook.
Mr Boyd emphasised that it was important that media treatment of the
police role should not be measured simply in terms of recorded crime or
clear-up rates which diverted attention from some very real successes
being scored by Scottish forces.
After presenting his annual report at Stirling, an angry Mr Wilson
stated: ''Our good detection rate is down to good investigation and our
partnership with the community. People in this region are now standing
up and being counted. More are quite happy to come forward and give
evidence. It is particularly important that people continue to have
trust, faith, and understanding in the police.
''I can state categorically that there has been no massaging of
figures and I speak after experience both in Fife Constabulary and here.
Each reported crime is recorded by the computer and generates a crime
report, which is what goes to the Scottish Office statistics department.
''The article in question is not properly sourced. There is nothing to
indicate where it came from and that is distressing to me. Is this
another media attack without justification?''
Mr Wilson said reported crime in the region fell by 9% last year,
which followed falls of 5% and 8% the previous two years. The force
detection rate rose to 57% of reported crimes cleared up, 2% up on the
previous figure. The average Scottish clear-up rate is 37%.
He attributed much of the success to 170 partnerships with
organisations and groups in Central Region. He was also quick to point
to the spectacular successes being seen after the introduction of
closed-circuit television cameras in town centres. Crime in the centre
of Falkirk has tumbled by 60% since the cameras took effect and, said Mr
Wilson, the overall fall of 16.5% of reported crime in the burgh was
proof that the crime was not simply being displaced.
Mr Wilson is exploring the possibility with manufacturers of creating
a portable system of CCTV cameras which could be moved quickly to deal
with crime outbreaks. It could be a first in Britain.

AN ELDERLY woman has won #1000 damages after she was knocked down by a
reversing car as she was about to cross a street.
Mrs Margaret Ward, 71, was walking with her five-year-old
grand-daughter when she was hit by the car in Balmwell Avenue,
Edinburgh.
Sheriff James Farrell made the award after deciding the car driver,
Neil McIntosh, 22, a chef, should have spotted her before reversing.
Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Mrs Ward suffered a cut to the back
of the head and an ankle injury in the incident, which happened in
November 1992.
She suffered from nausea and dizziness for about two months afterwards
as a result of the head injury.
In his judgment, issued yesterday, Sheriff Farrell stated that
McIntosh would have been able to see Mrs Ward behind him if he had
checked his rear-view mirror or looked over his shoulder.
She was waiting to cross the road and was standing just two feet
behind the car, which belonged to McIntosh's mother, when he started
moving backwards.
Mrs Ward had checked that there was no traffic and had sent her
granddaughter across the road first.
She suffers from angina, so is unable to run and is also slightly
deaf.
Sheriff Farrell said that there was no question of Mrs Ward ''suddenly
dashing out behind an already reversing car''.
He found that the accident was caused by Mr McIntosh failing to keep a
proper lookout when he reversed.

SCOTLAND, because of its culture, is not yet ready for mixed prisons,
according to Prison Inspectorate chiefs.
Mr Clive Fairweather, HM chief inspector of prisons in Scotland, said
he did not get any impression people were pressing for mixed prisons.
Mr Fairweather and Mr Ron Kite, deputy chief inspector, were reporting
on a new Prison Inspectorate study into the custody and training of
female and young offenders in Scotland.
In ruling out any recommendation for the introduction of mixed
prisons, they accepted that a public debate on the issue could be a good
thing.
Mr Kite said in Edinburgh: ''If people think this is the way forward,
that will come through and the Scottish Prison Service will then have to
make a decision. We are not in the business of making policy decisions
for the SPS.''
Last month, Mr Edward Frizzell, the SPS chief executive, announced
changes to where certain groups of female offenders would now be
located.
Greater use of existing remand units at Aberdeen, Inverness, and
Dumfries penal establishments would be made.
However, the report states: ''Basically the decision is one in
relation to the culture of the country concerned. In our view, the
cultural position in Scotland today -- and likely to be so for some time
to come -- is not conducive to the concept of mixed prisons.''
It also feels there should be improvements at Scotland's only women
prison, Cornton Vale, near Stirling, particularly relating to visits.

TWO robbers who subjected a 63-year-old man to a terrifying ordeal
after breaking into his house were each ordered by a judge yesterday to
pay #1500 compensation to their victim.
They beat up the man and forced him into his cellar before robbing him
of more than #300.
William Anderson, 31, of Johnstone Street, Annan, Dumfriess-shire, was
ordered to pay #1500 to Mr John Herbert, of Carlyles Place, Annan, and
was allowed to pay it in instalments of #35 a week. He was also ordered
to do 150 hours' community service.
His co-accused, James Carlyle, 34, of McMurdo Road, Annan, was ordered
to pay Mr Herbert #1500 at #50 a week. Carlyle was also jailed for 18
months for his part in the attack.
The men appeared for sentence before Lord Clyde at the High Court in
Edinburgh yesterday. The case had been continued from last month for the
two to try to raise compensation.
Both were earlier convicted of breaking into Mr Herbert's home on
October 28, 1994, and assaulting and robbing him. They threw a quilt
over his head, struggled with him, restricted his breathing, repeatedly
demanded money from him, pushed him about, and repeatedly punched him on
the head. They then forced him into his cellar and robbed him of more
than #300, his diary, spectacles, and other items.
Allegations that they repeatedly burned him on the hand with a lit
cigarette and threatened to burn his house down were dropped from the
indictment.
Lord Clyde said yesterday he would make a distinction between the two
men and jail Carlyle, because he had a worse criminal record than his
co-accused.
The judge said: ''The crime is one of the utmost seriousness and must
have caused serious alarm to your victim.''

A PRISONER serving 11 years is suing the Chief Constable of
Strathclyde for #50,000, alleging police attacked him with a
sledge-hammer and pick-axe handles during a drugs raid.
The claim by William Dennison, 38, is being defended by Chief
Constable Leslie Sharp, who alleges Dennison resisted arrest and
threatened his officers with a craft knife.
In his action at the Court of Session, Dennison, who is in Shotts
prison, alleges that on the evening of October 31, 1990, he was naked in
the bathroom of a friend's flat in Glasgow after taking a bath, when
four or five policemen burst in.
He claims the plain-clothes officers struck him repeatedly, some using
pick-axe handles and one a sledge-hammer.
Dennison also says he was punched and kicked and that the attacks
continued even after he was handcuffed. He claims he was unarmed and
offered no resistance.
He was later taken to the casualty department at Stobhill Hospital,
Glasgow, where he was treated for cuts and bruises.
The chief constable disputes this version.
He says his officers held a warrant for the arrest of Dennison on
drugs charges at a flat in Spiers Wharf, Port Dundas, Glasgow. His men
were aware that Dennison had a history of serious crimes of violence.
According to Mr Sharp, after his officers forced their way into the
flat, they found Dennison trying to jettison a large amount of drugs by
throwing them from a balcony into a canal and by flushing them down the
toilet, washhand basin, and bath.
The chief constable claims Dennison was using a knife to open a bag of
drugs and threatened the officers with it. He resisted arrest and some
force was used to handcuff and detain him.
Dennison was convicted of four charges of being in possession of a
controlled drug and obstructing police.
He admits the conviction and sentence but says he was acquitted, by
the direction of the trial judge, of obstructing police by failing to
open the door of the flat. The obstruction conviction related to
throwing bags of drugs out of the window.
He also says he was cleared of a charge of assaulting two of the
policemen.
A further hearing will take place later.

SCHIZOPHRENIA or manic depression hits 1% of the population at some
time in their lives and often runs in families, a medical expert said
yesterday.
Dr Douglas Blackwood of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital said research had
shown a proven genetic factor in the illnesses by examining sufferer's
family trees. People had a greater chance of experiencing either
condition if close relatives had been affected.
Speaking at the Edinburgh Science Festival, Dr Blackwood said genetics
could be important for psychiatry.
He said medical research had led to the identification of the gene
which caused Alzheimer's Disease but not in schizophrenia or manic
depression.
''These are diseases which are horrendous in their effects. Treatment
is partial but not perfect. If you can understand the genes, it opens up
all sorts of possibilities,'' he said.
Later, Dr Dorothy Bishop of the Medical Research Council's applied
psychology unit in Cambridge revealed speech and language difficulties
in children may be genetic.
She claimed that research had dispelled the myth that ''baby talk''
helped children to learn how to speak. Cross-cultural studies show that
some parents did not speak to their children, or spoke to them as
adults, but youngsters still achieved fluency.

The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in Scotland hopes the
birds may produce some Easter eggs. However, it is taking no chances
that they will be disturbed and for the moment is not allowing the
public to view the nest from the usual observation spot.
However, twitchers can watch from a distance. For the first time, the
camera set up opposite the nest has been linked to a monitor at the
roadside, allowing members of the public to watch the ospreys.

A FORMER Army second lieutenant who blamed his mental breakdown on
''humiliating'' bullying at the hands of fellow officers yesterday lost
on almost every point of his High Court damages claim against them.
Mr Alastair Green ended up with just #750 damages against one former
major, Mr John Murphy, in respect of a single incident of sexual
assault. That award will be clawed back by the legal aid authorities
which funded his case.
Mr Green had turned down an out-of-court offer of #32,500 from the
officers and the Ministry of Defence to settle the case.
The court action cost an estimated #500,000, most of which will fall
on the public purse.
Mr Green, now 29 and teaching English in Japan where he lives with his
Japanese wife and their son, was not in court for the judgment.
He served only four months of his short service commission with the
7th Royal Horse Artillery at Aldershot, Hampshire, in 1985 before
suffering the first of a series of mental breakdowns brought on, he
said, by assaults and sexual abuse.

UNEMPLOYMENT and poverty are behind a worrying rise in tuberculosis in
Britain, two new health studies have revealed.
Research by three London doctors, due to be published in the British
Medical Journal on Saturday, shows that a marked increase in the disease
cannot be attributed to either HIV infection or to Asian immigrants but
to a ''failure to improve socio-economic conditions''.
Although the research was conducted in England and Wales, Scottish
experts say the link between poverty and TB is also evident in Scotland.
The incidence of tuberculosis has been falling steadily since
vaccination became routine for schoolchildren and thousands of adults
were persuaded during the 1950s to have chest X-rays.
However, an increase in cases of TB from 5086 in 1987 to 6166 in 1993
highlighted a worrying reversal and over the past five years the
incidence has increased by 12%.
''Anyone can catch tuberculosis but it is more likely to spread from
person to person in overcrowded conditions, and individuals who are
badly nourished or otherwise in poor health are less able to fight off
the infection,'' says the British Medical Association.
Dr John Moore-Gillon and Dr Malcolm Law, of St Bartholomew's Hospital,
London, have now discovered that TB is 10 times more common in the
poorest tenth of the population than the richest tenth.
They also show the increase in tuberculosis over the past few years is
concentrated in these poorer areas, where incidents of TB went up by a
third, while there was no increase in the upper seventh tenths of the
population.
Dr Law told The Herald that a natural conclusion from the studies
would be that TB would also be common in poor areas of Glasgow and other
Scottish cities. ''There is no reason to believe that the trends would
be different in Scotland,'' he added.
A small area study in the London borough of Hackney undertaken by the
two doctors also found that, despite previous conceptions that TB was
being introduced into Britain by Asian immigrants, ''the arrival of new
immigrants and refugees did not seem to be a major factor behind the
increase''.
Dr Moore-Gillon and Dr Law say: ''Poverty, including the decrease in
the real income of the poorest people in the population, is playing a
major role in the increase in tuberculosis.''
A separate study, also to be published in the British Medical Journal,
by Dr Punam Mangtani, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine, has concluded that a link exists between levels of
unemployment and tuberculosis.
After studying TB notifications in 32 London boroughs during the past
10 years, Dr Mangtani says: ''Those boroughs that experienced the
greatest increases in unemployment also saw the greatest change in their
notification rates.''
The doctors also conclude that although a link between HIV infection
and TB has been established in parts of the USA, the AIDS-related virus
has made ''a small impact on tuberculosis'' in this country.
Dr Stevenson, of the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, and a member of the
Scottish TB monitoring group, said it was true that in Scotland the
problem of tuberculosis was not related to HIV and AIDS.
''My own feeling is that the rise we are seeing is due to the
dissolution of the fabric of our society and the rising numbers of
homeless people who are also alcoholic,'' he said.
Dr Kanti Patel, a respiratory infection specialist at Glasgow's
Western Infirmary, said the increase in TB in Scotland had been small
but more worrying was that a decline in notifications of the disease had
reverted to an increase.
He agreed with Dr Stevenson's conclusions, adding: ''I have found that
TB is especially high amongst the single homeless, which leads to a
conclusion that social deprivation is a major contributory factor.''
Last night, Labour's Scottish health spokesman John McAllion hit out
at the findings of the new reports, saying they confirmed the
devastating effects of poverty and unemployment on the weakest in our
society.
Mr McAllion says he has now written to Scottish Office Health Minister
Lord Fraser of Carmyllie demanding a full investigation into the causes
of TB in Scotland.

THE event that was planned as a grand finale to this year's Glasgow
Mayfest will now not take place during the festival, because of
''timescale and cash flow''.
Stormy Waters -- a piece of contemporary theatre on a vast scale
involving musicians, cinematic projections, and computers, staged on and
around Meadowside Quay on the Clyde -- will now be put on during the
Glasgow Fair holidays on July 21 and 22.
Mr Angus Farquhar, artistic director of the city-based NVA
organisation and director of the Stormy Waters project, said last night:
''Obviously we are disappointed not to do it in Mayfest but we are
funded to do big events and we want to deliver what we set out to do,
and we won't be compromised.
''We will carry right through and bring in a big international market.
It was a tough decision but moving it by six weeks is not a big deal.
Glasgow's reputation stands on our getting it right.''
Mr Farquhar said that all the bands and performers for the project
were in place but the postponement had been necessitated because of
''timescale and cash flow''.
He added: ''It is due to a major part of our funding not being
finalised until May. There are overdrafts and overdrafts and, in this
case, the risk was so big we had no leeway. Mayfest understands our
position.''
The cancellation, none the less, leaves the festival without one of
its few large-scale events at a time when it has been under criticism
for the lack of an international dimension.
The festival's administrator, Ms Barbara Zealey, said last night: ''We
are very disappointed but we wish the event every success. We will now
have to consider our position about a big finale but we won't do
something on the Clyde.''

Beijing, Wednesday
HUMAN foetuses are being sold as food in China, with one state-run
clinic giving them to women who consider they have medicinal value, it
was reported today.
Foetuses, typically a few months old, are the result of abortions
conducted in Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong, the Eastern
Express newspaper said in a report based on investigations by its
Eastweek magazine.
The Shenzhen Health Centre told an Eastweek reporter that, being a
state hospital, it gave away aborted foetuses free of charge.
''Normally we doctors take them home to eat'', a female doctor said.
At the city's main People's Hospital, which conducted more than 7000
abortions last year, foetuses have been sold illicitly for about 80p
each, the report alleged, but elsewhere clinics charge as much as #25.
Dr Warren Lee, of the Hong Kong Nutritional Association, told the
newspaper that eating foetuses was ''a kind of traditional medicine''.
But he added: ''There are people out there who just want to make
money.'' -- Reuter

Singapore, Wednesday
MEN holding top office jobs have a higher sperm count than factory
workers, but that does not necessarily mean managers or accountants are
more fertile, according to a new study.
The joint study by the National University of Singapore and the
Singapore General Hospital found that exposure to heat might cause low
sperm count in factory workers, the Straits Times newspaper said today.
But if bosses think this means they have more of what it takes to make
babies than their workers, think again, says Chia Sin Eng, head of the
study team.
''I don't want them to go around with their egos inflated. It does not
automatically mean they have greater fertility, as other factors such as
the condition of the sperm need to be considered,'' the lecturer said.
The team examined sperm of more than 600 men, who were slotted into
eight broad job categories.
The differences emerged even after several factors known to lower
sperm count -- such as smoking, alcohol drinking and medical history --
were considered.
''There is no need for plant workers to give up hope even if they are
found to have lower sperm counts. You only need one sperm to
fertilise,'' Chia said.

THE rudeness of waiters, the expense, and a lack of cleanliness and
are three major reasons why French people are deserting the traditional
cafe in favour of British style wine-bars, fast-food restaurants, or
simply staying at home to eat and drink. As a consequence, the number of
cafes in France has dropped from 200,000 in 1960 to only 60,000 today.
According to an opinion poll commissioned by mineral-water producer
Perrier, half of French people never go into a cafe. And of those who
do, 50% only frequent a bar once a month, or less.
Many women questioned in the Perrier poll said they felt cafes were
not a woman's place. Older men were less keen on cafes than younger men.
Fifty-five per cent of people said prices were too high. Improvements in
cafe management which people judged necessary included: greater
cleanliness; respect for non-smoking areas, and friendlier waiter
service.
The decline of the cafe is a major cause of concern for Perrier. In
France it sells 30% of its bottled water in cafes. It commissioned the
opinion poll to help with the launch of a new, larger bottle -- 33cl
instead of 20cl for its water.
Also worried are French brewers, who sell 40% of their beer in cafes.
Two years ago, an association of French breweries established a
''charter of quality'' for cafe owners, aimed at encouraging better
service and more attractive cafes. Even more worryingly, however, only
2% of cafe owners have bothered to adhere.

Moscow, Wednesday
SECRET files on the death of Adolf Hitler will be released next month
by a Russian publishing house, officials said today.
The Progress publishing group said that its multi-media computer
programme would prove beyond doubt that the Nazi leader committed
suicide in 1945 and that Soviet authorities burned the remains and
dumped the ashes 25 years later.
Progress official Sergei Zavyalov said that the documents, seized by
the KGB after the Second World War or received as evidence from Nazi
officials imprisoned in Soviet camps, covered the period from the rise
of Nazism in 1930s to the destruction of Hitler's remains 25 years after
his death.
''This really is the final page in Hitler's story,'' said Progress
official Sergei Zavyalov.
Official Soviet historians had long insisted that there was no direct
evidence that Hitler had committed suicide on April 30, 1945, as the Red
Army stormed Berlin.
Some suggested that Hitler, as well as other senior Nazis, might have
escaped and gone into hiding.
However, earlier this month Russian and German media published
documents proving that Hitler died in 1945 and was buried on a Soviet
army base in the East German city of Magdeburg.
They also displayed a 1970 order, from the then-KGB chief Yuri
Andropov, that the remains be burned and the ashes dumped.
The one-page report by a KGB special squad forms part of the
English-language computer archive, called simply Hitler.
It says that the remains of Hitler, his wife Eva Braun, Hitler's
propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels, and Goebbels' wife and six children
had been burnt to ashes on April 5, 1970.
''This certificate that the burning actually took place ends guesses
and reports of previous decades,'' Zavyalov said.
The documents, seized by the KGB after the Second World War or
received as evidence from Nazi officials imprisoned in Soviet labour
camps, cover the period from the rise of Nazism to the final fate of
Hitler's body 25 years after his death.
The English-language computer programme is part of a planned series
''Unknown pages of the history of the Second World War: Documents from
the secret archives of the KGB''.
Stored on a laser disc, it comprises 170 pages of documents, hundreds
of photographs, and more than 30 minutes of documentary film.
Progress officials were coy about how much it would cost, but Zavyalov
said: ''Most of the documents, pictures, and films, as well as pieces of
evidence by Nazi officials have never been published before.'' --Reuter

Kigali, Wednesday
GUNMEN slaughtered 31 Rwandan refugees and wounded 54 near Rwanda's
eastern border last night in the first such attack on a camp in Zaire
since the exodus a year ago.
Chris Bowers, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), said the gunmen invaded Birava camp, on the edge of Lake Kivu,
which is the border with Rwanda.
Moving around the camp of 9000 refugees, gunmen opened fire and threw
grenades, killing 29 refugees and wounding 54, including 12 seriously,
in a 90-minute assault. The dead included women and children. Two of the
wounded later died.
Bowers quoted refugee survivors as saying the attackers were wearing
uniforms and came from the direction of Rwanda. There was no immediate
comment available from the Rwandan Government.
The refugees in Zaire are all from Rwanda's Hutu majority and poured
across the border between April and July last year, fearing being killed
in revenge for the genocide of up to one million Tutsis and Hutu
moderates by Hutu troops and militiamen.
Earlier yesterday, gunmen attacked Zaireans on an island in Lake Kivu,
aid workers said. Survivors said the attackers asked residents where
they could find members of Rwanda's Interahamwe militia, responsible for
the genocide in Rwanda. They were told they could find them in Birava.
Bowers said UNHCR was investigating the attack and trying to speed up
deployment of Zairean troops to police the Zaire camps. Zairean soldiers
were expected to arrive at Birava tomorrow.
''It shows the inherent instability of having refugee camps so close
to the border,'' he said. Birava is six miles east of the border.
The Rwandan Government has been pressing for refugee camps for more
than one million Rwandan refugees in Zaire to be moved deeper into
Zaire. International conventions require refugee camps to be at least 30
miles from frontiers.
Aid workers recently reported attacks in the Bukavu area, near Lake
Kivu, by Rwandan Tutsi forces, apparently in reaction to incursions into
Rwanda by Hutu militias exiled in Zaire.
The Rwandan Government says it will decide next week whether to stop
all UN relief supplies passing through its frontier to the refugee camps
in Zaire because they harbour hard-line Hutu rebels.
However the UN World Food Programme (WFP) says 80% of its food was
going to innocent women and children and another 5% was for the elderly
in Zaire camps. It argues that closing the border to aid would only
cause more suffering.
Since last week, 53 WFP trucks have been prevented from crossing the
border to Zaire at the south-western town of Cyangugu. Since early this
year, Rwandan authorities have effectively closed the border at Gisenyi
to humanitarian aid lorries by lengthy searches and by causing other
problems.
Meanwhile, in neighbouring Burundi, where ethnic bloodletting by Hutus
and Tutsis has claimed hundreds of lives in recent weeks, the government
has asked the Organisation of African Unity to expand its monitoring
mission in the country and pledged to work seriously for peace.--Reuter.

POLICE hope the results of a post-mortem examination today will
determine what caused the death of a 12-year-old boy found with the rope
of a home-made swing around his neck in his parents' garden at
Fishcross, near Alloa, in Clackmannanshire.
Dennis Law died in the intensive care unit of Stirling Royal Infirmary
early yesterday after the accident at the rear of his parents' bungalow
at Burnee, Fishcross, early on Tuesday evening.
Dennis, a pupil at Lornshill Academy, Alloa, was found entangled in
the swing by his seven-year-old sister Elise, who ran to fetch their
grandmother who was also in the house.
Inspector David Moore of Central Scotland Police said an ambulance
crew had managed to resuscitate the boy but he died in the infirmary
about 14 hours later.
He said: ''It was a tragic accident but we wouldn't speculate on the
cause of death until we know the results of the post mortem. His parents
are obviously very distressed.''
Inspector Moore said there was no question of anything suspicious
about the death.
Police think it is most likely that Dennis was accidentally hanged but
have not discounted other causes of death.
The swing, two ropes with a wooden slat rigged from a tree, was taken
away by police for examination.
The boy's parents, Mr George Law and his wife Jean, run two local
bookmakers shops. Mr Law, who was at work at the time of the accident,
has requested that the family's privacy be respected.
A police report was being sent to the procurator-fiscal at Alloa
today.

UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland has fallen for the eighth consecutive month
and is now at its lowest level in more than four years, according to
figures released by the Government yesterday.
The seasonally adjusted figures, which are regarded as the best
long-term guide, show that Scottish unemployment decreased by 2400 to
205,600 in March -- the lowest level since January 1991, when 201,900
were registered as out of work.
The figures, which also show that the unemployment rate last month
fell to 8.2% of the workforce, mean the number of jobless has continued
to drop since the last peak of 249,600 in December 1992, apart from a
brief rise last July.
In the United Kingdom as a whole, the number of people out of work and
claiming benefit fell for the 19th consecutive month by 20,500 last
month to a total of 2,346,200.
The Employment Department said this was equivalent to 8.4% of the
workforce, the lowest level since July 1991.
The figures mean the jobless total throughout Britain has fallen by
more than 600,000 since its peak of just less than three million, also
in December 1992.
The Government, which has claimed that Britain's economy is booming,
again used the figures to support its argument that the economic growth
was continuing.
However, its political opponents highlighted that the 20,500 reduction
in unemployment was the lowest monthly fall since last July and warned
that the labour market recovery was slowing down.
Mr James Paice, the Employment Minister, predicted that: ''Britain,
after three years of economic growth feeding through into more jobs and
fewer people out of work, is about to start its fourth consecutive year
of growth with unemployment already well below the European average and
falling.''
Mr George Kynoch, the Scottish Industry Minister, said he was
delighted that unemployment, and the winter 1994/95 Labour Force Survey
issued yesterday by the Department of Employment, both pointed to
continued recovery in the labour market.
Professor Donald MacKay, chairman of Scottish Enterprise, was
similarly upbeat and forecast that Scottish unemployment would fall
below 200,000 and go as low as 190,000 by the end of this year.
Mr Lex Gold, CBI Scotland director, also welcomed the latest figures
and said there was a clear need ''to maintain and increase business
optimism and expansion within a stable economic framework''.
The TUC was predictably less positive and general secretary Mr John
Monks said the figures provided further evidence of a slow-down in the
labour market recovery.
Mr Campbell Christie, the STUC general secretary, said the fact there
were still more than 200,000 unemployed people in Scotland made a
mockery of the Prime Minister's claim that the economy was at its
strongest for 40 years.
Mr John McFall, Labour's Scottish employment spokesman, said: ''Even
the Government's own statisticians don't believe their figures. With the
new incapacity benefit coming on board, the Tories will now have to find
yet another ruse to massage the jobless figures.''
Ms Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP's employment spokesperson, said:
''Analysis shows that in Scotland the supposed gain in jobs since the
start of the recovery in fact hides the true picture. Though many
part-time jobs have been created, almost as many full-time jobs have
been lost.''
Mr Jim Wallace, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said
that although the figures gave some cause for optimism, the recovery was
by no means universal.

Berlin, Wednesday
THE United States and communist North Korea ended two rounds of
nuclear talks today which Pyongyang opened with a warning that US
demands could destroy an agreement to divert it from making an atomic
bomb.
US and Korean representatives will meet again tomorrow for more talks
at the United States mission in eastern Berlin.
Today's talks opened with a warning from Pyongyang that US insistence
that Pyongyang accepts nuclear reactors from South Korea, its sworn
enemy, could destroy an agreement to divert it from making an atomic
bomb.
''If the US attempts to test our will, forcing us to accede to its
unreasonable stand even at this juncture, this cannot be construed
otherwise than an attempt to totally drive us away from the negotiating
table,'' said the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
The two sides had had a two-week break from negotiations.
The US chief negotiator is Gary Samore, a senior aide to Assistant
Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, who is Washington's top negotiator
with Pyongyang. The North Korean team is headed by chief foreign trade
official Kim Jong-u.
Their last round of talks in Berlin broke up on March 27 when both
sides decided to consult their governments on new proposals to clear up
a disagreement over the supply of modern light-water nuclear reactors to
the communist state.
The provision of the reactors is key to an overall nuclear agreement
signed by the United States and North Korea in Geneva last October. That
accord averted a growing crisis over the way Pyongyang was conducting
its nuclear programme.
The United States and its allies believed they had evidence that North
Korea was using its civil nuclear industry as a cover for developing
nuclear weapons.
Under the Geneva agreement, Pyongyang agreed to freeze and eventually
dismantle its plutonium-producing nuclear reactors.
The United States pledged to provide North Korea with light-water
models and enough oil to drive its generators until they are built,
possibly in six years, in a deal worth #3000m.
Diplomatic sources said Pyongyang may have signalled in March that it
could agree to South Korea's involvement in the supply of reactors, but
only if strictly controlled by a US main contractor.
Gallucci said on Monday that Washington would press for United Nations
sanctions if Pyongyang acted on threats to ignore the deal and revive
its reactors.--Reuter.

SHANKS &amp; McEwan yesterday announced the sale of its loss-making
Glasgow-based construction division for #1 -- leaving the industry it
began in more than a century ago.
Meanwhile, another construction firm, Taylor Woodrow, said it was
axing its Scottish contracting division with the loss of between 30 and
40 jobs.
However, Jarvis, the minnow in the sector which purchased Shanks &amp;
McEwan (Contractors) and Shanks &amp; McEwan Construction, pledged to keep
on the entire workforce and hopes eventually to create more jobs.
Between 150 and 175 people are employed in the operations, depending
on the firm's workload.
Jarvis, which has itself been hammered by the state of the
construction industry in recent years, will continue the businesses from
their existing base at Shanks &amp; McEwan's (SME's) Scottish waste
management headquarters at Carnbroe.
The sale announcement came as no surprise to the City -- nor did the
nominal purchase price. Most companies in the sector have enough
headaches of their own, without taking on other people's problems.
For its #1, Jarvis, based in Romford, Essex, will receive about
#250,000 worth of fixed assets, comprising computers, portacabins, and
engineering equipment. Most of the equipment used by the construction
division is hired.
Although Jarvis will inherit cash balances of at least #1.35m, the
overall net assets of what it is acquiring, taking account of
liabilities, have nil value. Effectively, it is the ongoing business
which is being bought.
During the last two years, SME has restructured the construction
division, which lost #1.4m in the year to March 26, 1994. It still made
losses, albeit lesser ones, in the year just ended.
However, Jarvis, which has seen its pre-tax position slump from a
profit of #2.01m in 1989 to losses of #3.72m and #3.15m in 1992 and
1993, believes it can turn the construction division into a
profit-making concern.
In the 1980s, SME, which now has its head office in Buckinghamshire,
chose to move away from construction, which ultimately accounted for
less than 10% of group sales.
It made a string of acquisitions in what is now its core business of
waste management.
Referring to SME's exit from construction, Mr David Downes, its
finance director, said: ''It was the genesis of the group and we are
very sad that we have reached this decision. However, it is based on
financial grounds.''
Jarvis, with a market capitalisation of only #3.65m, is one of the
tiddlers in the property and construction sector. It has no existing
presence in Scotland but covers most of England and Wales and has an
office in the Isle of Man.
Shares in SME put on 1p to 87p, with those in Jarvis unchanged at 9p.
Taylor Woodrow would finish contracts currently under way but would
not be bidding for any further business in the foreseeable future,
spokesman Mr Andrew Wadstead said yesterday.
The decision to axe the Scottish regional contracting operation was
taken as a part of programme involving the shedding of between two to
three hundred jobs throughout the UK, which was ordered after the UK
construction division sustained #4m losses in 1994.
Tight market conditions and falling margins were blamed for the job
losses.
The conglomerate's other Scottish-based businesses, which include the
housing division Taywood Homes, their civil engineering section, and the
maintenance arm, Taymech, are unaffected by the pull-out.

Sarajevo, Wednesday
BIG power peace envoys cancelled their trip to Sarajevo after the
Bosnian Serb army refused to guarantee the safety of their plane.
''It was not possible to obtain security guarantees from Bosnian Serb
military liason officers this morning,'' said the UN said. Sarajevo
airport has been shut since Saturday when Serb gunners raked a US cargo
plane with small arms fire.
The cancellation was a blow to the five-nation Contact Group's plans
to persuade a reluctant Bosnian government to extend a battered
four-month truce due to expire on May 1.
It was unclear when the envoys, from Britain, France, Germany, Russia,
and the United States, would make another attempt to reach Sarajevo.
Their tour of Balkan capitals to try to restart the stalled peace
process comes against a background of deteriorating security in Sarajevo
and ceasefire breaches across Bosnia.
The Bosnian Government launched a twin-pronged offensive last month
that won strategic high ground in the north and centre of the country.
The enraged Bosnian Serbs have responded by shelling civilians in
UN-declared ''safe areas''.
Serb forces fired more than 20 heavy artillery shells into the eastern
Muslim enclave of Gorazde yesterday and another today.
The attack came after three days of shelling of Sarajevo which killed
four civilians and saw the UN ask Nato jets to mark targets for possible
retaliatory air strikes. A mortar round hit Sarajevo today, injuring
seven.
Western powers fear the pattern of small-scale offensives and
harassment will escalate into all-out war in Bosnia in the summer months
and wants some progress in peace diplomacy to help push the Bosnian
government to accept a truce extension.
The peace envoys hoped that moves by Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic to recognise Bosnia's independence might prove useful to show
the Sarajevo government that progress could be made to regain land
elsewhere than on the battlefield.
However at a meeting in Belgrade yesterday, Milosevic rebuffed the
Contact Group plan to offer him some relief from crippling trade
sanctions in exchange for accepting the independence of his neighbours.
Milosevic says he wants all sanctions ended permanently before he will
recognise his neighbours, a demand the West is reluctant to grant,
fearful of losing the only bargaining chip it has.--Reuter.

CHANNEL Tunnel rail services were plunged into chaos yesterday after
one of the #24m Eurostar trains became entangled in overhead power
wires, stranding hundreds of passengers.
The accident -- involving a Paris-London train one-and-a-half miles
from the tunnel near Saltwood in Kent -- halted all Eurostar services
for more than three hours.
Two hundred and fifty passengers on the train were stranded for more
than four hours until engineers freed its current-carrying arm.
The passengers finally arrived at London's Waterloo station in
mid-afternoon, more than nine hours after leaving Paris on what should
have been a three-hour journey.
Mr Michael MacDonald, from Ottawa, Canada, who is spending four days
in Britain after two weeks in France, said: ''We are here and happy to
be here. The staff were very nice -- I just wish they'd had more food.''
Three other Eurostar trains also came to a halt. On one, also from
Paris to London, a choir from New College, Oxford, entertained
passengers with Cole Porter songs.
The incident was another unwelcome problem for Eurotunnel, which on
Monday warned that it could be ''overwhelmed'' by debt service costs
following a net loss of #387m in 1994.

Moscow, Wednesday
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin today ordered an investigation into the
Russian activities of a Japanese doomsday sect suspected of links to the
deadly nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway.
The inquiry would be conducted by the general prosecutor's office, the
Federal Security Service (FSB) and a government commission on religious
groups, co-ordinating with Japanese authorities.
The Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth) sect, which says it has 30,000
members in Russia, is suspected of staging the March 20 nerve gas
attack, which killed 10 people and left thousands ill.
A former member of the sect testified in court that the sect tested an
unidentified nerve gas on its Russian followers.
Marina Romandina, 19, appeared in Moscow court yesterday on behalf of
a parents' group that is suing the Aum Shinri Kyo sect for corrupting
Russian youth.
Romandina said a nerve gas was used on fellow sect members to ''help
the believers better penetrate other worlds'', said Japanese NTV
reporter Sergei Kotsuba, who attended the trial.
Romandina told the court that the gas was not used on her, however.
Japanese police are looking into the group's possible links to the
March 20 nerve gas attacks in the Tokyo subway, which left 11 people
dead and 5500 others ill.
Romandina said many sect members fell sick after the nerve gas tests,
suffering stomach problems, headaches, vomiting, and nosebleeds.
The sect, whose name means Sublime Truth, has about 35,000 followers
across Russia, and about 10,000 followers in Japan. It also has branches
in United States and Germany.
Two weeks ago, a Moscow court suspended the work of the sect's six
Moscow branches, and seized its premises and bank accounts in the
capital.
One of the main motivations of the ruling was sect leader Shoko
Asahara's alleged call on his followers to commit suicide. Asahara also
predicted today that a devastating earthquake would hit Tokyo on
Saturday.--Reuter/AP.

<TEXT>
A 14-YEAR-OLD schoolboy who raped an 11-year-old girl at knife-point,
devastating her life, was sentenced to four-and-a-half years' detention
yesterday at the Old Bailey.
Six-foot-tall Patrick Djima -- described by police as ''a mini crime
wave'' -- was on bail for a knife-point robbery at the time of the
attack last summer.
Judge George Bathurst Norman said the consequences for the little girl
and her family had been ''quite, quite devastating''.
Detective Inspector Stephen Condon said afterwards the girl had
''undergone a personality change. She used to be a bubbly little
character, she is now quiet and introverted. She is reluctant to go out
on her own and her family don't like letting her out of their sight''.
Djima, now 15, went ''completely berserk'' for seven weeks last
summer, according to his counsel, Mr Jerome Lynch. As well as raping the
schoolgirl he robbed two women, one disabled, at knife-point and
threatened a group of children with a knife.
Djima admitted rape and the robberies last month after he was
acquitted by a jury of attempting to rape an 18-year-old at knife-point.
He was remanded until yesterday for reports.
As he passed sentence the judge lifted an order he made earlier
banning the identification of Djima.
In the attack the boy forced the girl into an alleyway in Harlesden,
west London, threatened to kill her and raped her. Afterwards he warned
she would be killed if she told anyone, and walked home with her so he
knew where she lived.
The girl was too frightened to tell her parents, and pretended she had
been robbed. But she broke down and revealed the truth. Two days later
Djima called at her home and she recognised his voice. While her father
kept him talking, police were alerted.
The boy had gone to the house to apologise, said Mr Lynch, because he
at the time had no conception of how serious the offence was and how
devastating the affect on the victim.
He said Djima, from Willesden, north west London, had a very disrupted
upbringing living in Ghana with relatives until he joined his parents in
Britain when he was 10.
The boy had found difficulty adjusting and by the time of the attack
was beyond the control of his parents, who had asked social services for
help in controlling him. When he was arrested, said Mr Lynch, he was ''a
nightmare'', but since then has matured considerably so he presented far
less risk to the public.
* In another case a boy of 14 who raped a ten-year-old girl was led
smiling from the dock yesterday after a judge ordered him to be detained
for six years. The boy -- now 15 -- had admitted the attack last July in
Folkestone, Kent, at an earlier hearing at Lewes Crown Court.
Mr Justice Hidden said that the boy could not be named.

A #10M development at the former Armitage Shanks factory site in
Barrhead has been given a cautious welcome by residents.
A public exhibition of the plans opened in the Renfrewshire town
yesterday. The Berkshire-based developers, Blue Circle Industries, said
their proposals included 90 new houses, a 50-bed nursing home,
industrial units, an access road through the site, and some
environmental improvements.
Residents who turned up at the exhibition supported the plans on the
condition that the new access road to Blackbyres Road, on the other side
of the site, was built before anything else.
They said heavy traffic was already a serious problem on Victoria Road
and that could only worsen if lorries and vans used the street during
the construction period.
Renfrew district councillor Walter McCready said the access road was a
pre-condition to any future development work.
He said: ''Everyone is keen to see the development progress if it can
create jobs but the access road is crucial -- there are a lot of elderly
people and children in this area.
''The traffic is already a problem 24 hours a day and a residential
home and new houses would at least double the number of vehicles on the
roads. We've got to get the access road before anything else.''
An outline planning application has been submitted to the district
council and further consultation will now take place.
Ms Margaret Docherty, of Victoria Road, agreed that the access road
was crucial if the development plan was to succeed.
She said: ''I, like the majority of people around here, want to see
the road in first.''
Retired service engineer Dan Wade worked at Shanks for 50 years. He
said: ''The main aspect of this is that they are talking about an access
road across the back which should take heavy vehicles away from the
residential area.''
Blue Circle land development manager Mr Chris Hall said the views of
all local people would be taken into account.
He said: ''These comprehensive proposals are the result of three years
detailed research and consultation. Most people are keen to see the
project go ahead because they want to see an end to the heavy traffic on
the road and the dereliction of the site.
''Our aim is to support Renfrew district's policy of stimulating
economic growth and development. At the same time, we want to provide
social and environmental benefits that will revitalise this urban
area.''
Around 200 people currently work at the Shanks Industrial Park, mainly
in small business units. The former factory was closed down in 1992
after 141 years at the 55-acre site.

<HEADLINE>Fish talks stall as Scots are wooed by Canada</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978911565</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
EUROPE called Canada's bluff last night by refusing to rush into a
fisheries deal despite an ultimatum from Ottawa.
Canadian Fisheries Minister Mr Brian Tobin had threatened further
action if agreement on fish quotas was not reached last night in
Brussels.
But EU ambassadors did not even consider the question of carving up
the contested Greenland halibut catch.
During talks lasting about 30 minutes, they agreed with the European
Commission that there was still no acceptable deal to consider.
The impasse came as the Canadian Deputy High Commissioner for the UK
paid a visit to Peterhead Harbour yesterday to thank Scottish fishermen
for their support in the fish war.
Mr Serge April was welcomed by a flotilla of local trawlers flying the
Canadian flag. He told fishermen at the harbour, one of Europe's biggest
white-fish ports: ''Scottish fishermen have been at the vanguard of
support for our campaign.''
Fishermen's leaders have threatened to campaign to take the UK out of
the European Common Fisheries Policy if the dispute is not settled,
sharing Canada's hostility to Spanish incursions.
Mr George Forman of Peterhead Harbour Board said: ''We are honoured at
the Deputy High Comissioner coming here to thank the Peterhead fishermen
for their support.
''I don't think there was any doubt the Canadians would get 100%
support from the fisherman of Peterhead and also from other harbour
users.''
Last night Spain increased the tension by sending another boat into
the disputed waters off Newfoundland opening the way for more clashes
with Canada over Easter.
Despite this the EU talks concentrated on the issues of compensation
for the Spanish trawler Estai, whose catch was seized by the Canadians
last month, and getting any EU-Canada quota deal ratified by the North
Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (Nafo).
The EU said compensation was integral to any deal, but Canada says it
is a separate matter. Canada also disputes that ratification of any
agreement by Nafo is required.
However hopes remain that a last-minute settlement will be reached.
''The gap is very close, but we are not there yet,'' said one
diplomat.
The two sides are still separated by 3500 tonnes of fish. Canada wants
parity with the EU, each taking 10,000 tonnes, with the remaining 7000
tonnes shared between Japan, Russia and the Baltic states.
But Spain, which trawls virtually all the EU quota, wants half the
total -- 13,500 tonnes.
The solution could involve Japan and Russia giving up some of their
proposed allocation to top up Canada and Spain's share.
* IRISH police last night were questioning the skipper of the Spanish
trawler Roade in Galway after it was arrested for illegal fishing.
The boat was detained on Tuesday 140 miles off the Blasket Islands,
County Kerry, by the Irish Naval Service fishery protection vessel Emer,
and escorted to port.

<HEADLINE>Labour calls for an inquiry over new Aitken allegations</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>2</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978911566</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday called for a Commons committee to probe fresh claims
about the company directorships of Chief Secretary to the Treasury
Jonathan Aitken.
The Independent newspaper ignored Mr Aitken's threat to take legal
action against the press by publishing new allegations.
It says he failed to declare shareholdings in two companies, and
directorships in a further three, while he was a backbench MP.
Mr Aitken defended himself in a statement to the newspaper saying he
had not broken any Commons rules and was ''absolutely correct to act as
I did''.
Labour called for the new allegations to be the subject of a probe by
the Commons Select Committee on Members Interests ''to get the whole
picture sorted out once and for all''.
Mr Aitken has issued writs for libel against the Guardian and is
considering action against Granada TV's World In Action programme and
The Independent and other newspapers.
The editor of the Independent defended his newspaper's story but Tory
MPs have lined up to support Mr Aitken's crusade against ''the cancer of
bent and twisted journalism''.
They are putting pressure on National Heritage Secretary Stephen
Dorrell to consider a privacy law.
Lord Wakeham, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, spoke
against a privacy law.
''The question is, which is the best way of protecting the freedom of
the press and also the rights of individuals? My view very strongly is
that it is self regulation rather than statutory control,'' he said.
''Politicians are quite able to defend themselves, quite able to go to
law. A privacy law would be an additional help to the rich and the
powerful,'' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Labour's industry spokesman Brian Wilson said: ''As far as Mr Aitken
is concerned, the call for a privacy law is a smokescreen.
''The day newspapers cannot conduct this kind of inquiry into the
relevant business activities of MPs or Ministers, there will be
something deeply wrong and dangerous taking place.
''Bedroom privacy and boardroom privacy are two different issues and
anybody who tries to confuse them is ludicrous.''
Independent editor Ian Hargreaves said: ''It certainly shouldn't stoke
up pressure for a privacy law. These are not private matters.
''The story that we published is based upon records in Companies House
which are public records.
''We're not accusing him of having broken the rules on the listing in
the register of MPs' interests.
''What we're questioning is whether he was right -- even though he
wasn't required to list them -- not to list them.''

LIVESTOCK exports last night looked set to claw their way back from
the brink of collapse following a High Court test case in which official
bans on the controversial trade at key ports were ruled unlawful.
Two judges said the bans amounted to giving way to ''mob rule''.
While jubilant farmers celebrated the court ruling, ''disgusted''
animal rights activists cried ''shame on British justice'' and vowed to
fight on, believing that the majority of people -- if not ''out of
touch'' judges -- backed their campaign.
Many were stung by the court judgment, which strongly condemned the
ban on the ''legal'' live trade at Dover harbour and Coventry airport
earlier this year and an attempt to block it at Plymouth.
Ms Dawn Potter, spokeswoman for Action for Animals, whose group was
involved in the protests, said that campaigners were disappointed by the
court's decision and took issue with the judgment's reference to ''mob
rule''.
The animal rights lobby would now concentrate efforts on Dover, she
said.
The authorities said that they had acted because of fears of further
violent and disruptive protests of the kind which have already brought
trouble to many ports.
However, Lord Justice Simon Brown, sitting with Mr Justice Popplewell,
said that it was a question of ''the rule of law'' against ''mob rule''.
He rejected the authorities' claim that, following the voluntary ferry
ban which halted much of the livestock trade in November last year, they
had the legal right to take similar action to protect the smooth running
of port facilities and the safety of the public and the majority of
their customers.
The judge said: ''If ever there were cases demanding the courts'
intervention in support of the rule of law, these are they.''
The bans ''brought small credit'' to the port authority at Dover,
which had traditionally handled the bulk of animals destined for
slaughter and the veal trade on the Continent, the judge said.
Mr Jonathan Sloggett, Dover harbour board managing director, said that
when the trade restarted -- probably after Easter -- he feared there
would be disruption for 99% of the port's customers for the sake of the
1% of animal traffic.
Plymouth city council, which wanted the live trade halted at Millbay
docks after costly and violent protests, was also said to have shown
''narrow self-interest'' -- as had Coventry city council, owners of
Coventry airport, where animal rights protester Jill Phipps, 31, was
crushed to death during a demonstration earlier this year. A High Court
injunction prevented the Coventry ban being implemented.
The judges ruled that the authorities had no discretion in law to bar
the export of live animals for slaughter or veal production, though many
members of the public thought it immoral.
None had appeared to consider the ruin facing thousands of farmers in
England and Wales and the fact that ''the protests will not cease --
rather they will intensify elsewhere'' if the bans were allowed to
stand.
Plymouth was ''open to grave criticism'' as it wanted its port
authority, Associated British Ports, ''to surrender to mob rule''.
Plymouth city council spokesman Ian Blackhouse said later that it was
''disappointed'' with the court's ''mob rule'' reference, and the
authority was considering whether to appeal.
Mr Ben Gill, the National Farmers' Union deputy president, who was in
court to hear the judgment, said: ''It is a clear statement that further
protest at ports is futile, because it is not in their discretion to
take action banning livestock exports.''
Mr Gwillym Thomas, spokesman for the Aberystwyth-based Farmers' Union
of Wales, which with the NFU helped fund the legal action against Dover
harbour authority, said: ''This Dover ban was having a crippling effect
on our industry. At last the impasse has been broken.''
Mr Peter Gilder, an exporter who challenged the Dover ban, said it was
a ''brilliant, fantastic'' judgment and he hoped to start operations
from Dover ''as soon as we can come up with some amicable agreement with
the local authorities''.
However Mr Peter Stevenson, of Compassion in World Farming, said that
his group was ''deeply disappointed''.
Livestock exporters Phoenix Aviation, which operates four
calf-carrying flights a day from Coventry airport, said: ''We welcome
the judgment as it gets Coventry council off our backs.''
The Scottish NFU welcomed the ruling which they described as an
''impediment to a perfectly legal trade''.
Prestwick International Airport, which was the focus of angry protests
last December when two flights carrying calves left the Ayrshire airport
bound for Europe, yesterday insisted that it would maintain its
self-imposed ban on such flights.
That ban was introduced after consultation with the SSPCA and members
of the public, concerned at the ''cruelty'' of the trade in live animals
for export.

<HEADLINE>Scientists to trace islanders' origins</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978911568</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE genes of a group of Scottish islanders are being put under the
microscope -- to try to discover the origin of the species.
Scientists are analysing blood samples from 100 Shetlanders who traced
their ancestry back three generations or more.
They hope to shed light on the long-running debate about the
islanders' origins.
Some Shetlanders believe they are descended from Vikings who colonised
the islands in 800AD and wiped out the local Celtic population.
Others, who believe they have a Scots heritage, claim Pictish people
survived in isolated areas.
The study is part of a worldwide project which aims to compare the
origins of distinct populations -- including the Bubi population of
Equatorial Guinea and the Kasteland islanders of Croatia.
The project itself is linked to the #2000m Human Genome Project,
designed to map and analyse every gene in the human body.
Scientists are using a technique known as human leukocyte
antigens-typing -- a form of DNA-typing -- to analyse the tissue.
''The HLA-typing may give a few pointers as to Shetlanders' origins,''
said Mary Inskip, of the Blood Transfusion Service in Aberdeen, which is
co-ordinating the study.
According to geographer Dr James Coull, an expert on Shetland based at
the University of Aberdeen, there was a small population on the islands
as long as 5000 years ago.
''Just how many there were until the coming of the Vikings is a big
question,'' he said.
''Older chroniclers thought the original population was swamped. But
it is more likely that they were absorbed through inter-marriage or that
they survived in remote spots.''
The last wave of colonisation occurred when the lairds moved north
just before and just after 1469, when Shetland was given to Scotland by
Norway and Denmark.
''It is conceivable that the islanders have unique genetic
characteristics which would be traceable in their descendants around the
world,'' said Mrs Inskip.
However, critics of the study claimed yesterday it was impossible to
determine the origins of Shetlanders.
Shetland Islands Council archivist Brian Smith dismissed the project
as nonsense and questioned its methods.
''It would be quite impossible to determine the true origins of the
Shetlander,'' he said.
''And to try to do it using people who can only trace their ancestry
back three generations must make it even more difficult.
''The only way to find out such a thing is through documents but they
fail us when it comes to periods as far back as 800AD.''
The final conclusions about the study are expected to be revealed in
June next year.

THE Government's attempt to cut back on Invalidity Benefit will
produce huge extra tribunal costs.
Its insistence that many people claiming the benefit are really fit to
work and its attempt to police the situation look likely to require an
annual bill of at least #13m for doctors' fees alone.
The scheme by Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley to weed out
non-genuine cases, which involves the introduction of a new Incapacity
Benefit as from today, has resulted in the recruitment of a small army
of doctors. They will act as medical assessors, advising social security
tribunals hearing appeals against refusal of the new benefit.
Most of the 350 doctors required have already been appointed to sit
alongside tribunal members.
Doctors will be paid #180.50 for a day-long sitting, plus subsistence
and mileage allowance.
The Shadow Social Security Secretary, Mr Donald Dewar, said he was
carrying out his own investigation. ''This underlines the expense and
the administrative problems that are going to arise.
''Last year, there were just over 23,000 appeals against refusal of
Invalidity Benefit. Next year, Ministers are working on the assumption
that there will be 140,000 appeals, mainly against refusal of the new
benefit.''
He feared the new scheme would lead to ''chaos and breakdown in the
system''.
The annual wages bill for the medical assessors, who will undergo
training in the way the tribunals work, would amount -- even on the
modest basis of 140,000 half-day-long appeals -- to almost #13m.
Under the new system, after initial tests by GPs, borderline claimants
will be examined by Benefits Agency doctors.
A person who disagrees with a finding will have the right of appeal to
the local tribunal.
The doctor's role as medical assessor will be to provide factual
medical advice to the members and will not be involved in the decision
for or against the appellant.
Official figures show that, over the past 10 years, the number of
people claiming Invalidity Benefit doubled to 1,600,000 and that,
despite an improvement in people's health over recent years, the costs
of Invalidity Benefit climbed steeply from #3100m in 1983-84 to #7000m
in 1983-94.
Last month, Mr Lilley said: ''Over time, the definition of incapacity
for work has become blurred. Some people who are getting Invalidity
Benefit may well be capable of working -- even if it is not their normal
occupation.''
He added: ''People who are genuinely sick or disabled will not be
affected by the changes.''
The object of the new benefit, the Government has said, is to try to
ensure that cash reaches those who are genuinely unable to work because
of sickness or disability.
A recent social security press release stated: ''Research has shown
that some people are getting benefit who are not incapable of work.''

INDEPENDENTS and Liberal Democrats joined forces yesterday to prevent
Labour from gaining power in the new Dumfries and Galloway Council.
Mr Allan Baldwick (Ind) was elected as convener and Mr Dennis Male
(SLD) as vice-convener. They hold the same posts in the regional
council.
Mr Baldwick won by 47 votes to 22 against Labour contender Mr John
Forteath while Mr Male beat off Labour and SNP rivals.
Labour, which has 22 members on the council -- the biggest single
group -- was also unsuccessful in its bid to get a bigger representation
on the 17-strong interim executive committee which will draw up a
shortleet for the post of chief executive from the 30 applicants. Those
on the list will be interviewed by the full council.
After the meeting, Mr Baldwick said: ''I am absolutely delighted that
members have placed their confidence in me. I will have a total
commitment to the council and will ensure the public know what we are
doing and why.''
Mr Baldwick said he would decide in three months whether to give up
his post as regional council convener.
Mr Male said he had intended to give up the regional vice-convenership
as soon as possible but because of reservations expressed about this
course of action he would now consult the Liberal Democrats before
deciding.

* The civic head of the new Dumbarton and Clydebank unitary authority
will be the present Dumbarton provost, Mr Pat O'Neill, who represents
Dumbarton West.
His deputy will be Councillor George Cairney, of Duntocher, a meeting
of the ruling Labour group in Dumbarton has decided.
The council will be led by Councillor Mary Campbell who represents the
Dalmuir and Clydebank Central ward on the council. Her deputy will be Mr
Danny McCafferty, who represents Mountblow in Dalmuir, and who has been
a long-time vociferous opponent of the establishment of the HCI private
hospital at Dalmuir.
A Labour spokesman said that to avoid confusion during the run-up to
the new authority taking over next year, the civic head would take the
interim title of convener but would revert to the traditional Scottish
title of provost thereafter.
Labour took control of Dumbarton and Clydebank by winning 14 of the 22
seats on the new council at last week's election. The SNP won seven
seats and Independent Mr Billy Kemp was elected in Old Kilpatrick.

FORMER Government Minister Allan Stewart has been charged with
committing a criminal offence during an incident with anti-motorway
protesters near Glasgow earlier this year.
Mr Stewart resigned as Scottish Industry Minister ''to save the
Government embarrassment'' after an alleged fracas with protesters
against the M77 motorway extension, in which he was said to have picked
up a pick-axe.
The Crown Office in Edinburgh confirmed yesterday that Mr Stewart, the
Conservative MP for Eastwood, has been charged with committing a breach
of the peace at Pollok Castle Estate, in Stewarton Road, Newton Mearns,
on February 5.
A spokesman said Crown counsel had instructed summary proceedings
before the sheriff at Paisley, after consideration of a Strathclyde
Police report on the incident in Mr Stewart's constituency. Mr Stewart
had been informed of the charges at the weekend.
Mr Stewart's 16-year-old son, Jack, and a friend of the same age, who
were with him at the time, have also been charged with contraventions of
the Firearms Act (1968) during the incident at Pollok Castle Estate on
February 5.
His son has been charged with two contraventions of the Act, by
allegedly having a loaded air weapon in a public place without lawful
authority or reasonable excuse and by allegedly buying an air weapon
when he was under the age of 17.
His son's friend, David Clow, is also charged with contravening the
Act by allegedly possessing a loaded air weapon in a public place
without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.
A pleading diet for the three has been fixed for May 23 at Paisley
Sheriff Court.
Mr Stewart is on a visit to Tripoli, in Libya, to meet Colonel Gaddafi
in an effort to help resolve the stalemate over bringing the two
Lockerbie suspects to trial in the West.

SCOTTISH mothers and their premature babies are being flown to Belfast
and Newcastle because of a lack of special care baby cots in Scotland.
Labour's health spokesman has called the situation an outrage, while
Lothian Health Council has demanded to know why the Scottish Office has
failed to publish a two-year-old study into special baby care provision.
On a number of occasions during the past two years, mothers and their
new-born babies have undergone emergency flights from Edinburgh to
receive special attention at Belfast and Newcastle hospitals.
In other cases, mothers and babies endured 70-mile helicopter flights
between Glasgow and Dundee, because of the same lack of facilities.
The Herald has found there are currently 247 special baby cots in
Scotland but these include only 70 intensive care cots.
Ms Michelle Hegarty, a spokeswoman for Lothian Health Council, said
the Scottish lack of neo-natal provision was a problem which ''is
getting worse and causing increasing concern''.
She added: ''There is a genuine lack of facilities for women who have
gone into premature labour and we know of at least five cases in the
last two years where mothers and their new babies have been flown to
Belfast or Newcastle because no cots were available in Scotland.
''But these cases are only those where someone has complained. There
must be many more, which the hospitals are unwilling to admit to.''
A senior spokesman at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary Hospitals said he was
unable to comment on either the incidents or the cost of the flights.
In 1991, two high-profile cases in Glasgow led to an increase in the
city's special care provision.
The first involved triplets from Milngavie, when the babies were born
eight weeks premature. Parents Janette and Gordon Henry were given three
choices: have the babies in Dundee, Newcastle, or Belfast -- there were
no beds in Glasgow. Mrs Henry chose a 70-mile flight to Ninewells
Hospital in Dundee.
In June, another Glasgow woman, Mrs Gwen Adams, endured a harrowing
trip to Dundee to give birth to triplets.
Greater Glasgow Health Board then provided three extra cots almost
immediately and the health board now has 98 special care cots, including
26 intensive care cots.
Last night, Ms Heggarty said Lothian Health Council had hoped that a
Scottish Office inquiry into special baby care provision launched in
1993 would have rectified the situation, but the report had yet to be
published.
''There has also been no increase in provision at Edinburgh's main
maternity unit at the Simpson and the fear now is that it will take
something drastic to happen before anything is done,'' she said.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said he was unable to comment on
why the report had not been published or on the council's concerns on
the use of baby-care beds in Belfast and Newcastle.
Labour's Scottish health spokesman, Mr John McAllion MP, said the
situation was an outrage.
''While we have planners making statements on the number of beds we
need based on obscure Government-inspired models, we have a situation
which does not meet up with reality,'' he said.

STRONG viewing figures for BBC Scotland's offbeat drama, Hamish
Macbeth, has ensured a commission for another series. It was confirmed
from London yesterday that the programme, which attracts about 10
million viewers a week, is to be given another run of six episodes.
The series, made for BBC Scotland by the independent Zenith/Skyline
Productions, is currently running at peak-viewing time on a Sunday
evening and stars Robert Carlyle as a Highland village policeman.
The second series, to be filmed again in Plockton, will start shooting
in the summer. Ms Andrea Calderwood, Head of Drama at BBC Scotland,
said: ''I'm delighted that the audience has responded so warmly to the
originality of Hamish Macbeth.''

<HEADLINE>Scientists criticise Sellafield A-waste testing</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978911576</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH scientists claim that levels of radioactive waste from
Sellafield washed up on the Solway Firth are higher than experts
previously believed.
A team of researchers from Glasgow University has discovered that
methods of testing contamination from the nuclear plant were flawed.
Dr Robert Allan, who headed the university research team, said the new
tests revealed higher concentrations of radioactive particles buried
underground. He criticised earlier research by government scientists for
relying on surface readings which he claimed were ''inappropriate''.
Dr Allan stressed there was no evidence that any radioactive waste had
passed into the food chain. He said the higher contamination levels
found at the site were still within government safety guidelines.
He was speaking on the second day of the 13th European conference of
the Society for Environmental Geochemistry and Health at Aberdeen's
Robert Gordon University.
The new testing method involved boring narrow holes in the mudflats
and salt marshes at intervals over a wide area of land on the RSPB's
Mersehead Farm reserve near Dumfries.
Dr Allan said wardens at the reserve had been given hand-held
monitoring equipment by the Scottish Office to take regular surface
readings of radiation.
''It's quite clear from the results obtained by the new techniques
that we need to rethink our testing procedures in this type of complex
environment,'' he said.
He added that airborne surveys of the type used by scientists at
Chernobyl could not accurately measure the deposits of radioactive
material which had built up in the silt since the Cumbrian power station
began operating in the 1950s.
Meanwhile nuclear waste has been found on an open-air dump at Dounreay
which is supposed to be used only for building site debris.
The activity was found during a routine radiation scan carried out by
health physics surveyors at the plant.
North anti-nuclear campaigner Mrs Lorraine Mann said last night that
the discovery was the latest example of sloppy work practices at the
Caithness site, adding: ''Dounreay is beginning to look as if it's got
more perforations than a tea-bag.''
The dump, on the seaward side of the site, was found two years ago to
have spots of contamination embedded in it.
Dounreay spokesman Mr Derrick Milnes confirmed yesterday that further
activity has been detected. The contamination, he said, was very minor,
with the material having been taken away and disposed of in the site's
low-level waste pits.
Mr Milnes said: ''It's a non-active dump for builders' rubble and
we're still investigating how this material got there.'' All the
contamination had now been cleaned up, he said.

THE first adverts to be shown on television for whisky could be
screened during the rugby world cup.
The Herald can reveal that United Distillers has approached Scottish
Television with a view to air an advert for Bell's whisky during the
competition.
The Scottish rugby team which will be playing in the world cup in
South Africa is sponsored by Bell's competitor, The Famous Grouse.
Border Television and Grampian TV are also believed to have been
approached to show a series of advertisements during the tournament
which runs from May 25 to June 24.
Adverts for spirits have not appeared on independent television since
it started in the 1950s. At the time, liquor companies voluntarily
agreed not to advertise spirits until it had been proved that other
alcohol advertising on TV could be handled responsibly.
Liqueurs, lagers, and beers are currently advertised, and there is a
growing feeling among alcohol companies that it is time to lift the ban
on spirits.
One industry source said: ''United Distillers are testing the water
with the plans. Other companies will be watching with interest the
reaction to their ads.''
A spokeswoman for United Distillers, which is owned by Guinness,
refused to comment on the approach to television companies. However, she
said the company backed any plans which ended discrimination between one
form of alcohol product and another.
Scottish Television's head of public affairs, Mr David Whitton,
confirmed talks had taken place. He said: ''We have been approached and
we are of the attitude that we are prepared to show the whisky
adverts.''
It is likely these would be shown after the 9pm watershed.
A spokesman for Channel Four, which is also believed to have been
approached by United Distillers, said it would have to wait to see if
the whisky advert would be passed as suitable for screening.
Alcohol watchdogs and leading Church officials last night criticised
the proposal. The Rev Bill Wallace, the Kirk's social responsibility
convener, said it would be a retrograde step: ''This is not a good move
and one which we will be opposing.''
A spokesman for Alcohol Concern said: ''There would certainly be a
risk of increasing the danger from alcohol-related products. We would
fight this move and do everything we could to keep spirits' advertising
off television.''
Mr Brian Marjoribanks, of the Independent Television Commission in
Scotland, said any scripts for whisky advertisements would be
scrutinised by the Broadcasting Advertising Clearance Centre.
Mr Marjoribanks said he had been aware of plans for a whisky advert
and added: ''The company behind the advert and the BACC would work
closely together on the formulation of it.''
''We at the ITC are in regular contact with Scottish Television on a
number of issues.
''We have a tried and tested formula for dealing with adverts when
they are screened which has worked remarkably well in the past and
gauges reaction to adverts.''

Washington, Wednesday
DISAVOWAL of the Vietnam War by one of its chief architects, former
Defence Secretary Robert McNamara, has reignited debate over the war.
President Bill Clinton and millions of others stigmatised by either
opposing the war or avoiding the draft during the 60s and early 70s may
benefit from the resulting dilution of the war as a touchstone for
morality and patriotism, observers say.
McNamara said in a book this week that he and other advisers to
presidents John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were ''terribly wrong'' in
their handling of the conflict, which killed up to three million
Vietnamese and 58,000 Americans.
Breaking a 27-year silence, McNamara said he had secretly believed
that US involvement was futile and that the United States should have
withdrawn from South Vietnam as early as 1963 -- 12 years before the war
ended.
George McGovern, who ran for president against Richard Nixon in 1972
on a pledge to end the war immediately, said McNamara's branding of the
war as a tragic mistake was a ''bombshell'' that could alter the
political landscape.
''It's like the Pope coming out against Christianity,'' the former
South Dakota Democrat said in a telephone interview. ''It just
demolishes the entire case for our involvement there from a man who saw
it from the inside.''
Clinton's avoidance of military service haunted him during the 1992
presidential campaign.
''It could very well let Clinton and others off the hook for not
having served,'' said Pulitzer prize-winning Vietnam historian Stanley
Karnow.
McNamara's disclosure came as a disappointment to many Vietnam
veterans. Jan Scruggs, founder of the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial in
Washington, said: ''I feel very hurt. Now we find that he knew all along
the effort was doomed.''--Reuter.

POLICE are investigating an incident in which an 80-year-old former
soldier allegedly punched South Wales Labour MP, Mr Ray Powell.
Mr Jim O'Brien, a former Royal Hussar and Army boxer, is said to have
landed a series of punches on Mr Powell, the MP for Ogmore and a senior
party Whip, at his surgery in council offices at Maesteg, Mid Glamorgan.
Mr O'Brien said yesterday: ''The only thing I apologise for is not
hitting him harder or more often. He provoked me so I just let him have
it.''
He said he had gone to tackle Mr Powell, 66, at a constituency surgery
while campaigning for better treatment for his war widow sister-in-law.
A letter he had sent to be forwarded to the Ombudsman had not been
acknowledged by the MP, Mr O'Brien alleged.
''He told me I was a liar if I said I hadn't received the
acknowledgement. I clenched my fist and told him if he said that again I
would put it straight between his eyes.
''He repeated it -- and I carried out my threat by belting him three
or four times in the face. I hit him twice with my left hand and twice
with my right.
''It was all over in seconds and he didn't retaliate. I wish I was 18
and not 80, then I could have hit him harder.''
Mr O'Brien a widower from Garth, near Maesteg, marched out of the
council offices after the incident.
Mr Powell, who was not thought to be injured, has referred the matter
to his solicitors.
Mr O'Brien claims his sister-in-law Mrs Molly O'Brien, 87, is owed
18-years' war pension. Her husband, Mr O'Brien's brother, Robert, died
in the 1944 D-day landings. A South Wales police spokesman confirmed
they had received a complaint but Mr Powell refused to comment.

North Bay, Ontario, Wednesday
THREE of the Dionne sisters, the world's first surviving quintuplets,
are seeking #6m in compensation from the Ontario government for
exploiting them as children.
The surviving sisters, Cecile, Annette, and Yvonne Dionne, live in
Montreal. Emilie and Marie died as adults.
Their birth in May 1934, in the northern Ontario hamlet of Corbeil,
created a sensation that ended up tearing the family apart. Not only
were they the first quintuplets on record to survive more than a few
days, they were also identical, still a rarity.
Their father signed a contract 48 hours after their birth to display
them at the Chicago World's Fair. Ontario Province intervened and set up
a board of guardians and a $1m trust fund.
The government gave the doctor who delivered the girls control over
their welfare and, as their health was initially precarious, built a
hospital nursery near the farmhouse called Quintland.
They were not allowed to play with their other sisters and brothers.
The Dionnes had 13 children.
The parents were almost completely excluded from decisions about how
to raise the sisters, who became Canada's biggest tourist attraction,
drawing as many as 6000 people daily.
Their mother won a nine-year legal battle to regain custody but too
late to rebuild the family. Their father died in 1979 and their mother
in 1986.
The Dionne sisters were identical because they were conceived from a
single egg that later divided into five parts. Multiple births that are
conceived from separate eggs are more common.--AP.

Warm Springs, Wednesday
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton, celebrating the legacy of Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, said today that FDR would have been on his side in fighting
efforts to cut aid for the needy or to retreat from obligations abroad.
At ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of Roosevelt's death,
Clinton said the way to raise Americans' stagnant wages was through
education. He warned Republicans he would sign no tax-cutting Bill that
did not help to pay education costs.
If Roosevelt were alive today, ''he would . . . say, let's not forget
that what really works in life is when people get a hand up and not a
hand-out'', Clinton said of the only US president to serve four terms.
''He led us from the depths of economic despair through a Depression,
to victory in the war, to the threshold of the promise of the postwar
America he unfortunately never lived to see,'' Clinton said.
Roosevelt died aged 63 at his beloved ''Little White House'' in Warm
Springs, Georgia, where ceremonies include rededication of the restored
therapeutic pools where he swam for relief from the paralysis of
polio.--AP/Reuter.

Boston, Wednesday
A GUATEMALAN general running for president was ordered by a US judge
today to pay $47.5m to eight Guatemalans and an American nun who were
victims of atrocities committed by his soldiers in the 1980s.
The judge held General Hector Alejandro Gramajo responsible for the
torture and murder of thousands of civilians in the Central American
nation while he was vice chief of staff and director of the army general
staff in the early 1980s and defense Minister from 1987 to 1990.
Eight Kanjobal Indians who fled Guatemala after soldiers ransacked
their villages and killed their relatives, and Sister Dianna Ortiz, who
was kidnapped, raped and tortured while working in Guatemala, accused
him of being personally responsible for the campaign of terror.
Gramajo was found liable by default, meaning the judge ruled against
him because he did not contest the lawsuit.
Human-rights lawyers acknowledged it will be extremely difficult for
the victims to collect from the general.
Gramajo denied any role in the crimes and said he had not defended
himself because he did not have the money.
''At last, one person will be held accountable for the crimes the
military has committed,'' Ortiz said in a statement. ''At the same time,
my heart is heavy because I know that the cries of thousands of
Guatemalans remain unheard, as the abuses continue.''

A WOMAN was awarded #50,000 damages yesterday by a jury who decided
she was raped by her former boss.
Ms Linda Griffiths, 32, who said she wanted her name made public,
brought the civil claim after the Crown Prosecution Service refused to
prosecute Arthur Williams, 48, following a police investigation.
The four men and four women who heard the six-day case at Truro County
Court decided that Williams did rape her and ordered him to pay the
damages.
Williams's counsel Jonathan Marks said there would be an appeal
against liability and damages.
Williams, part-owner of the Green Lawns Hotel in Falmouth would have
to sell his house and business to meet the award, he said.
Ms Griffiths, a former part-time dishwasher at the hotel, alleged she
was attacked in February 1991 by Williams.
Williams said the incident happened a month after he laid her off.
He claimed he went to check the lock and she put her arms round him
and kissed him, before they partly undressed each other and had
sex.''She had shown no reluctance to have sex whatsoever,'' said
Williams.
In a statement after the case, Ms Griffiths said: ''I feel justice has
been done, and it proves the value of the jury system.''
A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said there was no realistic
prospect of a conviction in the case because there were two different
standards of proof to be considered.
In a civil case, the jury had to decide the case on the balance of
probabilities -- whether it was more probable that the plaintiff's
version was correct or the defendant's.
In a criminal version, the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt that the defendant was guilty of an offence.

LIBERAL Democrats' leader Paddy Ashdown has been warned that the
''Blair'' factor could rob him of significant gains in local elections
south of the border on May 4. Tory dissidents are likely to go straight
over to Labour, a leaked confidential document states.
Mr Ashdown, launching his election campaign yesterday, reacted by
highlighting education as his major plank to steal seats off the Tories
next month. ''These elections will be a referendum on Britain's future.
In the same way that people said 'No' to the poll tax in 1991, we are
asking them to say 'No' to education cuts on May 4,'' he said.
The leaked election briefing, authored by Lib Dem local councillors,
warns Mr Ashdown that ''two years of easy pickings are over, though we
still have clout'' and that ''Labour is currently the natural home of
dissident Tories''.
At stake in the May 4 elections are 12,000 seats. Just less than half
of the Lib Dems' 4600 councillors are up for re-election. The
confidential briefing by Mr Andrew Stunell, political secretary to the
association of Liberal Democrat councillors, states: ''The election will
be fought at a time when the Conservatives are increasingly desperate
about their electoral prospects and will be seen as the first wholesale
test of the 'Blair Effect'.
''Faced by intense media interest in these two, the Liberal Democrats
will find it hard to maintain a high-profile positive national impact
over the next six months.'' The briefing, written last December,
correctly predicted there would be slim hopes for the Lib Dems in the
Scottish local elections.
The document was publicised by Labour yesterday. Mr Frank Dobson,
Shadow Environment Secretary, claimed: ''This document shows that the
Liberal Democrats believe the game is up in the battle with Labour.
Since Tony Blair became leader of the Labour Party the Lib Dems have
been in a tail spin.''

NURSE Janet Brown did not appear to have put up a struggle with the
intruder who clubbed her to death, detectives disclosed yesterday.
The body of Mrs Brown, 51, the wife of a company executive, was found
naked and handcuffed in the living room of her luxury #500,000 farmhouse
in the Chilterns village of Radnage on Tuesday.
Detective Superintendent Michael Short told a news conference
yesterday that the murder weapon had not been recovered and nothing
appeared to have been stolen from her Hall Farm house.
He refused to speculate on whether Mrs Brown may have known the
killer.
''My policeman's mind makes sure I keep an open mind,'' he said. ''We
will explore every possibility.''
Her husband, Dr Graham Brown, a senior executive with drugs company
Ciba-Geigy, formally identified his wife's body yesterday after flying
back from business in Switzerland.
Neighbours said Dr Brown had been seen at the family home at the
weekend and was thought to have flown back to Basle on Monday.
Neither he nor any of the couple's three children, Zara, 22, Ben, 21,
or Roxanne, 19, were at yesterday's news conference.
Mr Short said: ''I have spent one-and-a-half hours with Dr Brown and
he is not in any condition to come and speak at the moment. He is
extremely upset. The whole family is extremely upset.''
He confirmed ''as far as we know'' there was no sexual attack on Mrs
Brown but he could not explain the state in which her body was found --
unclothed and her hands manacled.
Mr Short said nothing appeared to have been stolen from the
four-bedroomed Hall Farm, although police would not know for certain
until Dr Brown had had a chance to check the house.
Police believe that Neighbourhood Watch organiser Mrs Brown was awoken
by the sound of breaking glass and went to investigate.
Mrs Brown, whose passion for law and order spurred her into organising
neighbours, was discovered lying at the bottom of a staircase just
inside the living room when builders arrived at the house on Tuesday to
the sound of the burglar alarm ringing.
Mr Short said the point of entry for the intruder was a double-glazed
patio door at the side of the house.
He could not say at this stage if the smashed glass had activated the
alarm or if the victim managed to press one of two panic buttons in the
house.
She is thought to have died sometime between 8.30pm on Monday night
and the early hours of Tuesday morning.
Neighbours have described Dr and Mrs Brown as a happy couple who were
popular in the area.
The couple's home is surrounded by paddocks and stables and overlooks
the rambling Wormsley estate owned by multi-millionaire John Paul Getty.
Detective Mr Short told the news conference that Mrs Brown had
received ''a minimum'' of five blows to the head.
Detectives are appealing for help from anyone who might have seen a
''small car -- something like a Fiesta, Golf or Metro'' parked 200 yards
from the house in the area known locally as The Triangle at 9.50pm on
Monday evening.
They also want to hear from anyone who heard a motorbike ''drive off
quite loudly'' through the village between 6am and 6.30am on Tuesday
morning.
''There is no evidence that either of the people in these vehicles is
involved in the crime but they could be important witnesses and we ask
that they come forward and help us with our inquiries,'' Mr Short said.
The detective stressed that the murder was an isolated incident and he
did not want to alarm neighbours in the rural community.

SCHOOLBOY Martin Johnstone, 17, of Kingussie, Inverness-shire,
yesterday won a national award for an invention to help road safety.
Called Tail Lit, his invention won the award for the most commercially
viable product at a contest at London's Science Museum.
Last night, as Prince Andrew presented him with the Young Electronic
Designer Award, Martin said he hoped it would create jobs in the North
of Scotland.
Tail Lit is an electronic device for cars and trailers which does not
need expensive wiring.
Martin invented a switch which connects to a plastic board that clips
on to the back of cars or trailers.
The switch is plugged in to the vehicle's cigarette lighter and
photo-sensitive cells work the indicator and hazard lights on the board.
Yesterday, industrialist Mr George Martin said he was talking to
Martin and his father, Mark, about mass producing Tail Lit at his
Highland Lighting Industries factory in Forres, Moray-shire.
Yesterday, Mr Martin said: ''It is a super idea and we are very
interested in manufacturing it here. I am very pleased that young Martin
has won national recognition for it.''
The idea came to the schoolboy one year ago, while out in his father's
car on the A9 near his home.
He spotted a line of cars carrying mountain bikes which were obscuring
the rear lights of the cars.
Then he heard a police warning on the radio that this was illegal and
could mean the vehicle was not covered by insurance.
When he discovered there was no portable device on the market, Martin
decided to invent one.
Through Kingussie High School, who receive #2500 because of Martin's
award, he received a temporary placement at GEC-Marconi, in Edinburgh.
Scientists at the electronics factory gave him advice about converting
his idea to a prototype.
Martin expects to start studying engineering and product design at
Strathclyde University in October.
Yesterday, he said: ''I am obviously over the moon at winning this
prize, particularly as it is open to all UK students aged under 25.
''I firmly believe there is a good future for my invention. I have
thought for some time that it could be made as a commercial product. The
award has really underlined my confidence in it.''
The Young Electronic Designer Award was judged by a panel of experts,
Tomorrow's World TV presenter Kate Bellingham.
It is co-sponsored by telephone firm Mercury Communications and US
electronics company Texas Instruments and is open to all students aged
between 12 and 25.
The contest challenged young designers to invent and produce a novel
electronic device that meets an everyday need.
Another Scots schoolboy, David Wilson, 16, from Merchiston Castle,
Edinburgh, won second prize in the 15-17 years category for his Remotely
Activated Power Points.

GLASGOW'S Labour leader, Councillor Pat Lally, has suffered a bitter
setback in his bid to become the first Lord Provost of the new
single-tier city council following reorganisation.
In a night of the long knives at the faction-ridden City Chambers, his
old rival, Councillor Jean McFadden, beat him by 39 votes to 37 to
become convener of the shadow authority which assumes full powers next
April.
But the real victor of the evening was the current Strathclyde Labour
leader, Councillor Robert Gould. He was elected unopposed as Labour
group leader, then proceeded to neutralise the rival Lallyite and
McFaddenite factions by using talent from both to fill group positions.
Both sides thought they had a deal with him but he outfoxed them and
drove through his own agenda of imposing peace in the strife-torn City
Chambers.
Complaints of double dealing were rife as both sides suffered damage
in Councillor Gould's crusade for peace.
At the end of the two-hour meeting, Mr Gould claimed: ''The factions
have been conquered.''
He also made it clear he would not tolerate any caucus meetings in the
City Chambers. Such activity would be a matter of group discipline.
Standing beside him, Councillor Jean McFadden hailed a ''new
beginning'' in city politics which she felt sure would provide much
needed stability.
Under new Labour Party rules, she will chair the new authority and the
Labour group, but Councillor Gould will be group leader responsible for
driving through policy.
The party would prefer the positions to be voted on again in a year's
time when the new council assumes power, but in the interests of
stability, Councillor Gould may push for bi-annual group elections. This
would ensure that Councillor McFadden would become the first Lord
Provost of the new authority.
Mr Lally, clearly disappointed, said afterwards: ''A year is a long
time in politics.'' This could indicate more trouble ahead in the Labour
group.
Asked about his much-vaunted deal with Councillor Gould, he added
cryptically: ''Some deals don't deliver.''
Ironically, his current deputy, city treasurer Mr Gordon Macdiarmid,
was elected deputy group leader, beating McFaddenite lieutenant,
Councillor Bill Butler, 41-34.
In the battle for the vice-convenership, Councillor Gerry Carroll,
beat his regional colleague, Councillor Gerry McGrath, 42-34.
Another senior regional councillor, Mr Des McNulty, defeated the
district's Audrey Strain 46-30 for the crucial position of group
secretary.
Other group positions and executive places were shared out equitably
between regional and district councillors. Care was also taken to make
sure that of the district appointees, both Lallyite and McFaddenite
camps were equally represented.
The first meeting of the shadow authority is expected in two weeks.
* The civic head of the new Dumbarton and Clydebank unitary authority
will be the present Dumbarton provost, Mr Pat O'Neill, who represents
Dumbarton West.
His deputy will be Councillor George Cairney, of Duntocher, a meeting
of the ruling Labour group in Dumbarton has decided.
The council will be led by Councillor Mary Campbell who represents the
Dalmuir and Clydebank Central ward. Her deputy will be Mr Danny
McCafferty, who represents Mountblow in Dalmuir, and who has been a
long-time vociferous opponent of the establishment of the HCI private
hospital at Dalmuir.
A Labour spokesman said that to avoid confusion during the run-up to
the new authority taking over next year, the civic head would take the
interim title of convener but would revert to the traditional Scottish
title of provost thereafter.
Labour took control of Dumbarton and Clydebank by winning 14 of the 22
seats on the new council at last week's election. The SNP won seven
seats and Independent Billy Kemp was elected in Old Kilpatrick.
* Labour's Mr Tom McCabe and Mr Sam Casserly, who fill the roles of
Labour group leader and provost on Hamilton District Council, have been
voted in as leaders of South Lanarkshire at a special meeting of all
shadow Labour councillors.
Mr McCabe becomes leader of the council, while Mr Casserly will be the
new convener.
* Midlothian single-tier council had its first meeting yesterday in
Dalkeith and elected Councillor Danny Molloy as convener and Councillor
George Purcell as vice-convener. Both hold the same offices in the
present Midlothian District Council.

<HEADLINE>Farmer views video of lame cattle</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A FARMER accused of causing unnecessary suffering to cattle in his
dairy herd watched a video in court yesterday, taken by the Scottish
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA), of lame cows
on his property.
Paisley Sheriff Court has heard how at least two of the animals shown
had to be destroyed by vets due to their poor condition.
Yesterday, however, farmer John Harper, 53, of Barrodger Farm, Beith
Road, Lochwinnoch, said he did not think the animals were suffering pain
''terribly''.
Mr Harper denies several charges relating to conditions at the
property and the health and welfare of his stock. He also denies breach
of the peace. He has admitted failing to dispose of animal by-product by
proper burial.
He has told the court that when any of his herd fell ill or suffered
an injury he would administer treatment using drugs supplied by a vet.
A post-mortem examination report on one of the cows which was put down
revealed the presence of salmonella. The report described the animal's
condition as poor and revealed it had a ''marked loss of muscle'' on its
right hind-quarter.
Viewing video footage of the beast before it had been destroyed, Mr
Harper denied it showed any signs of muscle wastage and, under
cross-examination from fiscal Margo Addison-Scott, added: ''I don't know
what muscle wastage is. I'm not a vet.''
He conceded the Fresian cow looked ill but said he did not think it
was suffering.
Mr Harper insisted he checked all 130 animals in his herd in the
morning as a matter of course. It was only when he encountered health
problem that he could not cope with that he would call his vet.
Referring to a brown bullock which was suffering severe hair loss from
ringworm, lice and mange, and was lame due to an infection, he claimed
he had been giving the animal injections for a foot disorder and feeding
supplements to assist the skin complaint.
Asked why he did not call the vet out to examine the animal, which was
subsequently destroyed following a raid by police and SSPCA officers, he
said: ''I treated it to the best of my ability.
''If I thought the vet could have done a better job than me, I'd have
called the vet out.''
Earlier, police animal health inspector Gordon Caskie told how one
Fresian cow was in such a distressed state, an independent vet called in
by the SSPCA ordered her to be destroyed. The animal got a stay of
execution when the farmer asked for time to have it treated by his own
vet.
They left firm instructions that the beast was to be bedded down in a
quiet shed away from other animals and not be moved under any
circumstances.
When they returned a few days later, the cow had been moved almost two
miles away to a field behind Lochwinnoch railway station. Its ear had
been slit and an identification tag ripped off.
0 The animal had to be humanely destroyed.
The trial continues.

<HEADLINE>BBC admits Panorama blunder</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978911590</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE BBC has admitted it made a mistake in failing to consult with
Scottish management over attempts to screen a Panorama interview with
the Prime Minister three days before the local elections.
A statement by chairman Marmaduke Hussey, issued yesterday on behalf
of the board of governors, said the corporation had shown ''insufficient
regard to the Scottish dimension''.
Opposition parties welcomed the climbdown by the BBC, which has
consistently defended the attempt to screen the programme.
The Scottish Labour and Liberal Democrat parties sought a ban on the
40-minute interview on the ground it could have given the Tories an
unfair advantange in last week's polls for the new single tier councils.
Management at BBC Scotland was not told about the interview until
details were disclosed in the press.
The BBC had argued that the interview did not affect the corporation's
impartiality.
The Court of Session ruled that transmission would be in breach of the
BBC's duty to be fair to all sides in the local election campaign. An
interim interdict was granted and a BBC appeal failed shortly before the
programme was due to go out. The corporation was then refused permission
to take the case to the House of Lords.
The BBC statement yesterday said: ''Decisions about the interview with
the Prime Minister were finely balanced. The governors are satisfied
that the executives involved did consider how best to balance the
interview with other programme material in both the Scottish and UK
context.
''However, we regret that overall the BBC showed insufficient regard
to the Scottish dimension and that there was inadequate consultation
with Scottish management.
''We will strengthen processes of management consultation throughout
the United Kingdom on issues such as this.''
It added that the BBC, not the courts, had responsibility for ensuring
fair and impartial coverage.
It went on: ''The BBC's management is reviewing its approach to
ensuring fairness in all election contexts -- European, general, local
and by-elections -- weighing the need to cover continuing events and
issues on the one hand, and to achieve balance between the parties on
the other.
''The governors' chief concern is to safeguard the independence of the
BBC from political pressure and to ensure that impartial coverage is
maintained.
''Independence will not be achieved by constant resort to the courts.
Broadcasters must not become shuttlecocks between political parties
vying to influence programmes or, alternatively, to stop their
transmission.''
Deputy Shadow Scottish Secretary John McFall said: ''From these
comments it is clear a mistake has been made. I'm alarmed at the lack of
contact between the BBC Scottish management and their network
colleagues.''
The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Jim Wallace, said BBC chiefs,
such as the director-general, Mr John Birt, and the director of news and
current affairs, Mr Tony Hall, should consider their positions.
He said: ''This totally vindicates the action we took last week. The
BBC management in London must be truly chastened by the governors'
statement, and long term lessons must be learned from these events.
''Indeed, those who so arrogantly insisted that they were right last
week must surely now consider their position, having been knocked back
first by the Scottish courts and now by the board of governors.''
The Scottish National Party, which was seeking a judicial review to
investigate the impartiality of the BBC's broadcasting, welcomed the
statement but said it may not go far enough. SNP chief executive Michael
Russell said party leaders would now have to sit down and consider the
implications of the statement.
He added: ''The BBC's board of governors have not shown the
belligerent attitude towards Scotland as John Birt and his team of
managers have.
''In their statement, the governors are clearly attempting to defuse
the problem which the BBC has created in Scotland. They acknowledge what
we have been arguing for a long time.
''BBC Scotland must have autonomy in all matters to do with Scotland,
even if those matters are sourced in London.''
The Rev Norman Drummond, BBC governor and chairman of the National
Broadcasting Council for Scotland, welcomed both the admission that
Scotland had been neglected and that management consultation processes
would now be strengthened.

A MINKE whale was seen in George Square, Glasgow, yesterday. The 26ft
model is part of a travelling Greenpeace exhibition against Norway's
continued hunting of the protected species.
The exhibition, which drew large crowds yesterday, visits Perth today
and Edinburgh tomorrow.
Norway is defying the International Whaling Commission's world-wide
ban on commercial whaling for the third consecutive year. Since the ban
was introduced in 1986, 15,000 whales have been killed.
This year, they plan to kill 301 whales but the Norwegian Government
has said that a kill of up to 4000 a year in future would be acceptable.
Greenpeace, however, argues that this is the level of hunt responsible
for the devastation of the population in the 60 years before the ban.
Numbers of Minke in the north Atlantic have recently been the subject
of much debate and numbers have recently been revised downwards from
87,000 to 60,000.
A Greenpeace spokesperson said: ''In 1986, with the global ban, it
seemed that at last the whales were saved. Norway's commercial hunt is
in defiance of both the ban and public opinion.
''They claim to base their 'quota' on existing numbers but we now know
there are far fewer whales than claimed -- and Norway have tried to
cover up this fact.''
The International Whaling Commission, which has 40 member countries
world wide, including USA, Russia, and Japan, is holding its annual
meeting in Dublin from May 29. Japan also continues to kill Minke,
exploiting a loophole in the guidelines permitting killing for
''scientific research''.

FOREIGN Secretary Douglas Hurd next week will indicate a change of
heart by the Government when he indicates a willingness to enter talks
about reducing the UK's nuclear arsenal.
In an address to the non-proliferation treaty conference in New York
on Tuesday, Mr Hurd will signal a significant change in Britain's stance
against talks leading to cuts in its nuclear warheads.
When the treaty was first signed 25 years ago, it was assumed that, by
2000AD, between 25 and 30 countries would have acquired the bomb.
However, Britain had opposed cuts in its nuclear deterrent, in a period
when the arms race between America and Russia had continued unabated.
With the collapse of Soviet communism, the proliferation issue again
takes centre stage.
At the last count, 175 states will participate in the conference
beginning next week. The three major nations not taking part are Israel,
India, and Pakistan, because they are said to have created their own
nuclear arsenals, breaching the treaty.

A GANG of teenage girls were ordered to be detained yesterday for the
knife-point mugging of actress and model Elizabeth Hurley.
The four, who were each sentenced to 12 months in a young offenders'
institution, surrounded Ms Hurley and threatened to thrust a six-inch
steel blade into her stomach.
Ms Hurley, who was not in Southwark Crown Court to see her attackers
sentenced, managed to escape with the help of a passing motorist.
Judge Gerald Butler, QC, told Christina Guerrine, Carlene Irving, both
18, and 17-year-olds Tamara Flowers and Helen Danso, all of London, that
the robbery they had carried out was of a ''thoroughly nasty kind''.

A JUDGE yesterday praised a caring and unselfish mother who gave up
custody of her son after constant pressure from her husband.
Lord Gill said the decision to hand over the boy, then three, should
not be held against Mrs Terry Shishodia because it demonstrated her
willingness to put her son's interests before her own.
The judge ruled that Kieran Shishodia should now be in the care of his
mother and criticised the father, Mr Prem Shishodia, for his ''selfish
disregard'' of his wife's rights.
The judge also granted Mrs Shishodia a divorce from her husband, who
is now unemployed after being suspended from practice by the Law Society
of Scotland for breaches of the solicitors' accounts rules.
Lord Gill said Kieran was not yet seven but ''his custody has been
under litigation for most of his life''.
He had been with his father since about July 1991, since when there
had been continual trouble over access, for all of which, as far as the
judge could see, the father was responsible.
The judge said the couple had split up in September 1990 and Mrs
Shishodia was granted interim custody.
By 1991, however, she was in considerable emotional distress and
living a council flat in a high-rise block in Sighthill, Edinburgh,
furnished with an emergency DSS grant.
By contrast, Mr Shishodia was prospering, working as a solicitor with
his own practice in Edinburgh.
''He was putting continual pressure on Mrs Shishodia to give him
custody of Kieran. He indicated that if she were to, there would be no
difficulty over access.''
In about July 1991, Mrs Shishodia decided it would be better for
Kieran that he lived with his father but, after September, Mr Shishodia
withdrew all access.
Arrangements for Mrs Shishodia to see her son were agreed after she
went to court but her husband had continually placed obstacles in her
way.
In April 1994, Mr Shishodia was suspended from practice by the Law
Society and, in July that year, he was sequestrated. The accountant in
bankruptcy assessed his liabilities at #110,652, excluding debts to the
Law Society and other solicitors, a figure disputed by Mr Shishodia.
He was now out of work, receiving income support and child benefit of
#86 a week. ''His prospects of obtaining remunerative employment are
nebulous,'' added the judge.
The wife's circumstances had also changed. In January 1992, she began
a nursing training course and would qualify at the end of this year. She
has also now formed a stable relationship with a man who appeared to
have a genuine interest in Kieran's welfare.
Lord Gill said he was not impressed by the father's behaviour and was
in no doubt that it was in Kieran's best interests to be with his
mother.
''Throughout the history of this case, he has shown a selfish
disregard of Mrs Shishodia's rights. He has caused needless difficulties
over access.
''Mrs Shishodia impressed me as an honest and straightforward witness.
She appeared to me to have a good sense of judgment and to have Kieran's
best interests at heart.''
In the judge's opinion, the fact the mother had handed over custody of
her son in 1991 should not be held against her.
''At that date, she was only 21. She had undergone considerable
stress. She was living alone. She had no family in Edinburgh. She was at
a considerable disadvantage to her husband.
''He was then 30 and was putting her under constant pressure. I
consider that her willingness to give custody to the husband in 1991 is
to her credit. It demonstrates her willingness to put Kieran's interests
before her own.
''She is now in a much better position to care for the child. She is
25. She will soon be a qualified nurse. She is in a stable relationship.
''I am satisfied that she is a good and responsible mother who will
stimulate Kieran's interests and look after him well.''

A BOSNIAN girl is to return to her war-torn home town of Mostar after
open-heart surgery at Glasgow's Yorkhill Hospital.
Still recovering from a five- hour operation carried out more than a
week ago, Menira Drace, 12, must go back to a devastated city in which
she witnessed the shooting of her father and the destruction of her
home.
Yesterday, consultant paediatric cardiologist, Dr Bill Doig, said
surgeon Mr Kenneth McArthur had closed the hole in her heart and
repaired a leaking valve. Although giving her a clean bill of health, he
added that she would need to take diuretics for the foreseeable future
and could need further hospital treatment.
The 12-year-old is one of around a dozen seriously ill Bosnian
children selected for treatment by medical staff in the former
Yugoslavia and being operated on in British hospitals. All have been
allowed into the UK on the condition that they return home immediately
after treatment.
When Menira's congenital heart condition began to deteriorate, she was
driven by UN soldiers through Croatian lines before being flown to
Britain in mid-March. She was brought to Yorkhill Hospital by Dr David
Southall of Keele University, who paid the #2000 cost. After securing
Menira's visa, he appealed for funds to help scores of other children.
Sitting close to her mother, Edina, Menira whispered to an interpreter
that she was pleased to be going home as she was anxious to see her
younger brother, Mithad, 9. She said she was taking home a teddy bear
and a truck for her brother.
Mladen Grbin, chairman of the Scottish-based charity SOS, said a
Menira Drace Trust Fund had been set up in conjuction with Yorkhill to
provide any follow-up support.

<HEADLINE>Jury hears tape of murder charge</HEADLINE>

A JURY yesterday heard a recording of a youth being charged with
murdering student Gary Talbot.
As the charge was read out, Paul Simpson, 18, wept as he replied: ''It
was an accident -- it was an accident.''
Detective Constable James Hendrick, 34, told the High Court in Glasgow
that, before being interviewed on tape, Simpson said: ''I'm not taking
the blame for everything. We were all into him. We all had knives.''
Simpson, of Cardross Street, Dennistoun, Glasgow, denies that on
December 25 last he stabbed and murdered 18-year-old Mr Talbot near the
students' union in the city's Cathedral Street.
He also denies assaulting and robbing students John McHugh and Anthony
Muldoon, both 19, in nearby John Street, minutes earlier.
Detective Constable Hendrick said he was called in to help the murder
inquiry and told that Simpson and four other youths were in custody in
connection with the assault and robbery charge.
He took Simpson to an interview room, and it was there, he said, that
Simpson said he was not going to take the blame for everything.
During the taped interview, the detective said, he was going to ask
questions about an incident in Cathedral Street about 3am in which a
young man attacked by a number of youths had died from his injuries.
Simpson said they ''saw a guy'' across the road, shouting at them. He
said they all pulled out knives and were going to fight him.
During the interview Simpson said he tried to slash Mr Talbot, of
Carlisle Street, Springburn, Glasgow. Asked if he stabbed him, he
replied: ''If I did stab him, I didn't mean it.''
Simpson also told detectives he was present in John Street, minutes
earlier when the two other students were assaulted and robbed.
0 A fingerprint expert said that a print on the handle of a knife
found at the scene matched that of Simpson's left ring finger.
Earlier the court heard that Mr Talbot had an eight-inch deep stab
wound to his left side which had cut a rib, his left kidney, two main
veins and his liver.
Consultant surgeon Peter Stanton, 37, said that, to stop the bleeding,
his left kidney was removed and the aorta was clamped. But Mr Talbot
died before the damage could be repaired.
The trial continues.
