TORY Party divisions on Europe re-opened last night as Europhile MPs
demanded Ministers publicly stand up for Britain's membership of the
Community.
A statement by the Positive European Group signed by 52 MPs called on
the Government to take action to counter the ''relentlessly negative''
attitudes of the Euro-scpetics.
The move comes as a clear show of strength by the pro-Europeans amid
growing concern at the increasingly Euro-sceptic drift of ministerial
pronouncements.
There are fears that the debate within the party has been hijacked by
the Euro-sceptics since the nine rebel MPs lost the whip.
The group's statement strongly denounced the rebels' policies saying
they would alienate Britain's allies and warning of the ''serious''
economic consequences if Britain was forced to leave the EU.
It said Ministers must make clear that compromise is an essential part
of working together in a community of 15 nations.
''They must also be much more willing to remind the electorate of the
advantage to Britain of Union membership and counter the relentlessly
negative attitudes, often based on misrepresentations, of the media and
the Euro-sceptics,'' it said.
It warned that it would be ''folly'' for Britain, as a trading nation
and financial centre, to rule out now joining a future European single
currency.
Any decision -- when it arose -- must take full account of Britian's
national interests and the impact on the economy.
The statement emphasised the growing support for Britain's vision of a
community of nation states and backed the ''positive but pragmatic''
approach adopted by successive Conservative Prime Ministers from Sir
Edward Heath, through Margaret Thatcher to John Major.
''We can still be 'at the heart of Europe' provided we have enough
belief in ourselves to understand that co-operation does not mean
centralisation ... It is time for us to press forward with confidence,''
it added.
The group chairman Ray Whitney said that they wanted to ensure that
the ''tenor and tone of the debate relating to Europe becomes more
positive.''
They received an early indication of support last night in the form of
a letter released by Energy Minister Tim Eggar to his constituency party
chairman strongly emphasising the benefits of EU membership.
''Our economic self-interest is plain -- we are inextricably bound to
the European Union,'' Mr Eggar wrote.
''The tide of arguement and events is with us. An economically
stronger Europe -- our sort of Europe -- is within our grasp. Yet many
in our party are too bogged down in internal debate over what might
never be to recognise the opportunities that are there to be grasped.''
At Prime Minister's Questions yesterday, Mr Major stoutly defended
Britain's membership of the EU and the UK's opt-out from the Maastricht
Treaty's Social Cchapter which lays down general working conditions.
Mr James Couchman (Gillingham -- Con.) suggested: ''The 40% of
American and Japanese investment in Europe that comes to the UK is
essentially dependent on our membership of the EU.
''If we ceased to be at the heart of Europe, those investors will
rethink their European operations locations.''
Mr Major replied: ''It depends on two points, both our membership of
the EU and the conditions of our membership of the EU.
''Certainly the fact that we are members has helped attract a great
deal of investment into this country.
''But it would be lost if the conditions of our membership were to
include the Social Chapter.''
He referred to the recent threat by the chairman of Daimler-Benz to
move out of Germany because of the cost of the social chapter provisions
in force there.

ONLY 50% of North Sea workers feel safe on the helicopter journeys to
and from their platforms, according to the first study to be carried out
on the perception and feelings of the UK offshore workforce.
The findings of the study were presented at a seminar in Aberdeen
yesterday when its authors, Professor Rhona Flin and Dr Kathryn Mearns,
also revealed it was still seen as ''politically incorrect'' for workers
to complain about safety issues.
The research was carried out by The Offshore Management Centre of The
Robert Gordon University, which organised yesterday's conference.
The background to its research, which involved 622 employees working
on six production platforms, was the need of those who promote and
regulate health and safety to understand how people think about and
respond to risk.
The Health and Safety Executive has indicated that risk perceptions
and attitudes form a special problem and that people are bad at judging
probability and particularly at judging risk.
''Typically, they are too frightened of strange situations and too
casual about familiar ones,'' it stated.
''They also underestimate risks they choose to take compared with
those imposed upon them.''
The UK study was modelled on Norwegian research and 40% of 1550
carefully developed questionnaires were returned. The average age of the
respondents was 40, and 98% were male. On average, they had worked
offshore for 10 years and on the same platform for the previous five.
The survey covered all occupations and included contractor and operator
personnel.
The research suggested that those who responded to the questionnaire
tended to feel safe working offshore but were aware of the hazards.
''The majority of respondents indicated they generally felt safe when
carrying out their work tasks. However, working with radioactive
materials, completing a task started by others, and when drilling is
taking place, only produced feelings of safety in about half the
sample,'' they told the conference.
''Similarly, only 50% of the respondents reported feeling safe in
relation to helicopter travel. This may be an accurate judgment of the
relative risks as helicopter flight is one of the most hazardous aspects
of offshore life for a number of installations across the North Sea.''
The findings showed that 44% agreed with the statement ''there is
sometimes pressure to put production before safety'' and 48% felt
''rules and instructions relating to safety sometimes make it difficult
to keep up with production targets'', with only 25% disagreeing with
these statements.
Professor Terence Lee, of St Andrews University, said that inquiries
into highly publicised accidents in recent years like Flixborough,
Bhopal, Kings Cross, Herald of Free Enterprise, Clapham Junction and
Piper Alpha had all come up with the same verdict -- that despite the
full range of engineering and technical safeguards complex systems broke
down disastrously because people running them failed to do what they
were supposed to.
He said these were not simple individual errors but malpractices which
corrupted large parts of the social system which made an industrial or
service organisation function.

BOTH the principal prizes in the domestic men's indoor hockey season,
the league and the cup, will be decided within 24 hours this weekend
with Menzieshill again likely to figure prominently.
Already they have a two-point lead over Indespension, Western, and MIM
in the League. The Taysiders would have to drop three points in their
last two matches to miss taking the title for the fourth time in five
years.
Menzieshill are desperate to get back into Europe, and it's difficult
to envisage them failing at this late stage.
Menzieshill meet MIM in the final game at the Bell's Sports Centre,
Perth, tomorrow, but the leaders' clash with local rivals Torbrex
Wanderers could decide the issue.
A win for the favourites would almost certainly seal the fate of their
contenders, whose goal difference is inferior.
* EDINBURGH Ladies' target of winning the indoor women's hockey
league-and-cup double for the first time is looking forlorn.
Three of their key players Diane Renilson, Janet Jack, and Pauline
Robertson have spent the last two weeks in San Diego with the Great
Britain squad. If the tension, emotional stress, and pressure of
competition at times in extreme heat against the USA has not taken the
edge off their game, the fact that they don't return home until 24 hours
before Sunday's finals of the cup most certainly will.
The players, however, are keen to get involved and they have a
semi-final tie against Clydesdale in which to make the adjustments.
Western Klick Photopoint, the defending champions will have a more
difficult semi against Bonagrass Grove, and they should pick up their
first trophy of the season now that Wendy Fraser is fast becoming an
influence again after injury.

A WAR hero died on Christmas Day as a result of wounds he received
more than 50 years ago in North Africa, a coroner decided yesterday.
Captain Leslie Farmiloe, 79, was wounded during the siege of Tobruk in
1942 defending a gun emplacement.
Portsmouth coroner James Kenroy recorded a verdict of ''death by enemy
action while on active service'' -- which is extremely rare in
peacetime.
The acting captain was the only man left alive in his unit when a
German shell landed near him. He was wounded by fragments of exploding
ammunition boxes.
Captain Farmiloe was awarded the Military Cross but unknown to him the
shrapnel in his body from the ammunition boxes contained asbestos which
eventually killed him.
A family friend, Dr Richard Nainby-Luxmoore, of Southwick, Hampshire,
said that Mr Farmiloe kept his bravery a secret until a few days before
his death.
Doctors did not discover asbestos poisoning until Mr Farmiloe, of
Castle Gardens, Petersfield, Hampshire, who served with the 25th Light
Royal Artillery, became ill last year.
Pathologist Dr Margaret Jeffrey said he died of an asbestos-related
disease.
Mr Farmiloe is survived by his wife Hazel and two sons.

Cairo, Thursday
THE leaders of Israel and its three Arab peace partners met in Cairo
today for a historic summit to speed up the Middle East peace process.
Tonight, after five hours of talks, they were said to have agreed on a
joint communique.
Egyptian newspapers described the meeting of the leaders of Israel,
Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinians ''a summit to save the peace''.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said he expected the talks to
redraw the political map of the Middle East and build a ''coalition for
peace''.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, and King Hussein of Jordan have their
own domestic agendas. However all share a desire to see more rapid
progress towards peace between Israel and the Palestinians, who are
anxiously awaiting the extension of self-rule to parts of the West Bank
now under occupation.
Before leaving Israel, Rabin said he would demand that the PLO do more
to stop Palestinian attacks on Israelis.
He told veterans of his Labour Party in Tel Aviv: ''We have a demand
of the Palestinian Authority -- and we will present it at every meeting
-- that the people under its authority do not carry out murderous
attacks.''
At the same time, Israeli Police Minister Moshe Shahal said Israel
could consider as early as tomorrow easing the closure it imposed on the
occupied West Bank and self-ruled Gaza Strip after the last Palestinian
attack.
However Islamic Jihad, the militant organisation which has rocked
Israel with suicide bombings, denounced the summit, saying the Arab
leaders were just trying to improve Rabin's image.
Egyptian and Israeli officials were drafting a communique calling for
an end to political violence, perseverance with PLO-Israeli agreements,
and more international funding for the Palestinian Authority.
Palestinian officials said they were unhappy with the proposed
emphasis on terrorism, saying it diverted attention from their main
concern of extending Palestinian authority over the Israeli occupied
territories.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had separate meetings with the three
visitors before all four came together for iftar, the meal which opens
the festival of Ramadan.
Ramadan is a month of peace for Muslims and Rabin's presence at the
meal is widely seen as a sign of acceptance by his Muslim neighbours, a
gesture that would have been unthinkable only two years ago.
Deep worries lay behind the gestures, however. Israeli and PLO
officials said they feared the summit might be little more than a
''photo opportunity'' for leaders trying to polish images at home.
Syria and Lebanon, the main Arab parties holding out against peace on
what they see as Israeli terms, will not attend.
Peres told Israeli army radio that Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
would have been welcome. ''We aren't leaving Assad out. Assad is leaving
himself out,'' he said.
''Assad has divorced himself from the process of war and he has yet to
marry the peace process. He is at a stage of political bachelorhood.''
The current Middle East peace process was launched at a conference in
Madrid more than three years ago and has taken shape in agreements
signed by Israel to end almost 50 years of hostility with Jordan and the
Palestinians.
However the march towards peace has stumbled over Arab-Jewish
violence, mainly by Muslim militants opposed to peace with the Jewish
state, Israel's sharp reaction to this violence, and deadlock in talks
with Syria.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher, whose country has been the
prime mover behind peace, welcomed the summit as a powerful statement
that enemies of peace will not win: ''The United States applauds and
endorses President Mubarak's bold initiative,'' he said.
Arafat told reporters as he left for Cairo: ''It's a very important
meeting and we hope to solve all the problems.''
An Israeli official in Cairo played down expectations: ''We expect
little from the summit, but the fact it is taking place sends a message
that the peace process continues.''
Israeli and PLO officials said the urgent problem was to find a way
forward in deadlocked Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, challenged by
such anti-Israeli violence as the Muslim militant bombing that killed 21
Israelis last week.--Reuter.

handcuffed and shot in the head. Sergei Skorochkin, 33, seized on
Wednesday by four gunmen posing as police officers, was the third
Russian MP to be killed in 10 months. Skorochkin shocked Parliament last
summer when he shot and killed an alleged Mafia attacker. A passer-by
was also killed in the shoot-out. Yesterday Skorochkin was reported to
have been hiding in London until recently.

SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown returned from Moscow yesterday to reveal
that his side would be facing Russia in the European Championship in a
stadium which has horrendous facilities.
Because of a new roof being erected at the national stadium in Moscow
-- the work is not expected to be completed in time for the visit of the
Scots -- Brown's men will play at the Lokomotiv ground, and will face
problems.
Said Brown: ''Honestly, I've never seen dressing-rooms like them. We
will be taking along bottles of Dettol to use in them.
''The showers are ancient, there are no hooks for the players to hang
their clothes, and we are going to have to disinfect the area before the
lads train and play.
''I was a little taken aback at the state of the stadium. The seating
is simply benches laid along concrete blocks on the terracing and some
of them are rotting.
''Neither that stadium nor the Torpedo ground, where the under-21 side
will play, would pass inspection in Scotland.''
However, there was a bonus for Brown when he had a look around the
hotel where the Scottish party will be staying. ''The hotel and the food
are excellent,'' he said.

GARY Jacobs, the former undefeated European welterweight boxing
champion from Glasgow, was last night given the name of his opponent for
his fight in Atlantic City on March 4.
The Scot, who will be having his last bout before challenging Pernell
Whitaker for the World Boxing Council welterweight championship in the
summer, will meet Tom Alexander, from Pittsburgh, on the same bill as
Whitaker challenges Jorge Vasquez for the light-middlweight crown.
If successful, Whitaker would immediately give up that title to
concentrate on a big-money showdown with Jacobs. The Scot has for some
time been rated as the official No.1 challenger for the welterweight
crown and has waited patiently for his chance.
Alexander is a tough fighter who has a record of 25 contests, 18 wins
and seven losses. He has been in with good class opposition, such as
former world lightweight champion Hector ''Macho'' Camacho, and was
beaten on cuts in the seventh round in that bout.
The trip will give the Scot a chance to have a close look at Whitaker.
''I keep hearing how good he is,'' Jacobs said. ''He is good, but I'm
convinced that when we finally get into the ring, I'll beat him.''

TOP referee David Elleray, who sent off two Everton players and showed
the yellow card a dozen times in a stormy Premiership clash at
Newcastle, insisted yesterday that he and his fellow officials still
have the respect of the top players.
The Harrow schoolmaster, who is the designated spokesman for the 22
elite referees on the Premiership list, said: ''Overall, relationships
between players and referees this season are better than ever.
''I think players are becoming aware of the way in which referees have
to do their jobs. We are on first name-terms with a lot of them.
''But it seems that scapegoats are always needed in football and
referees are the easiest targets.
''Everybody else takes their turn at being a winner or loser, but we
can never win.
On Wednesday night Everton manager Joe Royle described Elleray's
refereeing performance at Newcastle as the most insensitive he had seen
in 30 years.
Royle's comments followed hot on the heels this week of Paul Danson
having to cancel a red card against West Ham's Alvin Martin when the FA
presented the Leicester referee with irrefutable video evidence of his
mistake.

ALLY McCoist could be set to make a dramatic return in an
international jersey for the first time in almost two years when
Scotland travel to Moscow next month for their European Championship
qualifier against Russia -- a match from which they must take something
if they are to boost their hopes of reaching the finals in England next
summer.
The Rangers striker, despite having started only four matches for his
club this season and making another five appearances as a substitute, is
very much in the mind of Scotland manager Craig Brown, who has just
returned from a fact-finding mission to Russia.
McCoist made his last appearance for Scotland in the 5-0 defeat
against Portugal in Lisbon in April, 1993, when it was later diagnosed
he had broken a leg, and since then the man who has proved himself the
most prolific scorer in the country in recent years has been dogged by
one injury after another.
However, he continued his build-up to match fitness in a reserve match
at Easter Road on Wednesday night, where he scored twice, and Brown is
keeping in close touch with the situation.
Yesterday Rangers manager Walter Smith confirmed that McCoist had come
through the reserve match unscathed and said: ''He is fit and ready to
play against Dundee United at Ibrox on Saturday -- if selected. I'm very
pleased with his progress.''
Brown was delighted with that assessment. He said: ''I'll be going to
Ibrox next week to have a talk with Ally and Walter. It was in my mind
to give Ally a run in the B international against Northern Ireland at
Easter Road later this month, but that may not happen.
''There would be no point in overloading him with matches too soon,
but, if Ally and Walter feel that he needs an extra game, then he might
play at Easter Road.''
Scotland do not have an embarrassment of fit or in-form strikers at
the moment, and Brown is keeping all his options open. That, obviously,
includes McCoist.
''Really, I just want him back scoring goals and ready to face the
Russians,'' said the national manager. ''I would have no worries pushing
him straight back into the international side, even though he may manage
only half-a-dozen matches by that time.
''It was the best possible news I could get when I returned from
Russia, to find that he was ready for action. It would be even better
news if he continued the progress and played in Moscow.''
Meantime, Rangers' only problem, apart from long-term injuries to Andy
Goram and Alexei Mikhailichenko, for tomorrow's match against Dundee
United is midfield man Ian Ferguson, who lasted only 10 minutes of the
reserve match at Easter Road.
Ferguson has suffered a recurrence of a groin injury and, as well as
missing tomorrow's match, he is almost certain to miss out on Monday
night's Scottish Cup tie against Hamilton at Firhill.
Dundee United have a big worry over central defender defender Brian
Welsh for the trip to Ibrox. He missed training again yesterday, because
of flu and a throat infection, and a more realistic target for him may
be next Tuesday's Scottish Cup replay against Clyde at Broadwood.
Motherwell, who have recently stumbled after their commendable effort
to push Rangers in the championship, would probably see Celtic as the
main dangers for second place and will be determined to extend their
advantage when the teams meet at Fir Park tomorrow.
Looking towards that match yesterday, manager Alex McLeish asked his
players to prove Celtic's manager right in his assessment of the
Lanarkshire side.
Explained McLeish: ''We have had two hard matches against Celtic this
season, both ending in draws, and after the last one at Hampden Tommy
Burns was saying some nice things about us, saying how good we were.
It's now up to my players to go out and prove they deserve those kind of
comments.
''There could be various excuses used to explain our poor run, but I'm
not going to list them, except to say that this is a learning experience
for me as a manager. When you are on a winning run, that can hide
certain flaws and, hopefully, in defeat I have learned something. For
example, I should maybe use the horses for courses philosophy, or maybe
change our style now and again.
''Celtic are going reasonably well at the moment and the signing of
Hooydonk and the form of Falconer have given them a lift. But I won't
need to motivate my players for this one, and we have everyone available
to play.''
Notts County, who last year signed Rangers front man Gary McSwegan,
are the latest club to be linked with Celtic striker Andy Walker, who
has had to sit on the bench in recent matches. Burnley are also reported
to be keen on taking Walker, who rejoined Celtic from Bolton last
summer, back south.

SCOTLAND A go for the hat trick of wins over their Irish counterparts
at Myreside today and what a tantalising feast of rugby is in store as a
fair old sprinkling of Scots with points to prove set about staking Five
Nations' and World Cup claims.
This is not to downplay the importance of the match itself -- as coach
David Johnston's side seek to get back on the winning trail after defeat
by France last time out -- but with a queue of Scotsmen seeking to force
their way back into full international contention it has all the
hallmarks of a gripping afternoon's sport.
At the head of the queue is out-of-favour Scott Hastings. Dropped from
the full side after his fifty-first outing against South Africa,
Hastings has until now kept his own counsel.
However, yesterday he told me: ''It's a different experience in the A
team compared to the build-up to a full international, but this time
around with six full caps in the team it's not just myself with a point
to prove.
''There's Derek Stark, Tony Stanger, Jeremy Richardson, and Ian Smith
for starters. There's a lot of talent there and a lot of guys who have
played and toured for Scotland. After the disappointment of losing
against France, when we could have won, the onus is on us to perform to
a higher standard and to take our changes this time around.
''After the Scotland game against South Africa the selectors
considered that I had a played poorly and I now have to prove them
wrong. I have to prove to them that I can still play full international
rugby.''
For Hastings's midfield partner Tony Stanger, too, today's game
represents a golden opportunity to show that he can cope with the
entirely different questions posed in the centre.
Stanger, who regularly plays in that berth for Hawick, decided after
36 caps on the international wing that he fancied a change. No matter
that with 16 international touchdowns he is Scotland's second top
try-scorer. Today's outing, when he will play outside Hastings,
represents the ideal forum in which to display his worth in a fresh
positional environment.
Also in the queue is Boroughmuir's Derek Stark. With his confidence on
a fresh high, the four-times capped Kilmarnock chef is out to prove that
the selectors were wrong to leave him out of the patchwork of teams
which faced the South Africans last November.
Yesterday, coach David Johnston looked back on that last defeat by
France as a game which the Scots could have won. ''I say 'could' because
I'm not sure that we should have won it,'' he said. ''But it was
definitely there to be won. We had the opportunities to do so but we
didn't take them. However, good players should get better, so from that
start we'll be looking for a better all-round performance.''
Skipper Jeremy Richardson, who is another hoping to fight his way back
into full international reckoning after a single outing against South
Africa, said: ''Against the French I wouldn't necessarily agree that we
had done enough in terms of possesion to win the game but we didn't make
the most of our chances.
''Against the French you have to play for the full 80 minutes. Against
the Irish we would be hoping to control the game from start to finish if
we can. But players are human beings and it's unlikely, in my
experience, that they can stay on top all of the time.''
Ireland field a strong side, containing five full caps, against the
Scots so they will be no pushovers. Last time out the Irish lost 21-20
to England A, but their final preparations were upset midweek when
Maurice Field, of Malone, dropped out for family reasons. His place in
the centre goes to Laurence Boyle of Harlequins.
The A game kicks-off at 2.30. As a curtain-raiser under-21s meet at
1pm.

THE Baxi Partnership yesterday announced that it had taken control of
Barrhead Sanitary Ware, the ceramic company bought from Armitage Shanks
by its employees.
The company had been in financial difficulties for more than a year.
There had been fears that Baxi's ambitions would be thwarted by the
Barrhead co-operative's constitution.
However, Baxi has agreed to buy without changing the legal articles of
the company.
Mr Lawrence King, Group Finance Director of the Baxi Partnership,
said: ''We have taken control of the company without the ability to
change its articles.
''We have saved the company and given it a secure and proud future,
but we have compromised on our original objective.''
0 Under the articles of the Barrhead company 75% of all shareholders,
including those who have not voted, had to agree for a sale to go ahead.
Baxi's takeover had the unanimous support of the voting Ordinary
shareholders, in effect the workers who invested their own money into
company when it was bought over, who had agreed to accept Baxi's offer
of 40p for their #1 shares.
It also had 100% backing from its Preference shareholders who had
agreed Baxi's offer of #1 per #1 share.
However, only 53% of non-voting Ordinary shareholders supported the
deal. This category of shareholders consists mainly of local small
investors who backed the company with some of their savings. They had
been urged by Sir Albert McQuarrie, a former Barrhead chairman, to
reject the offer.
Baxi still hopes to increase its shareholding so that it can change
the articles of the company, and has therefore kept open its offer to
buy shares until the end of February.
Barrhead first approached Baxi for help at the end of 1993, and when
Baxi's bid to acquire the company failed in March 1994, Baxi gave it a
secured loan for #450,000.
Mr Ray Peedle, chief executive of Barrhead, said: ''Everyone here is
very pleased that the uncertainty is now over and that we can get on
with the business of manufacturing sanitary ware in Scotland.''

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang has announced that a White Paper on rural
Scotland will be published in the autumn. In a Parliamentary answer, he
said the time was right to review rural policies.
It is almost three years since the publication of The Scottish Office
Rural Framework, which outlined a new approach to the development of
rural policy in Scotland. Mr Lang recalled that the report emphasised
the Government's commitment to ensuring that the needs of rural
communities were met in a way which reflected their distinctive and
diverse character.
''It is now an appropriate moment to review our rural policies, and
the machinery we have in place for delivering them. I intend to report
the outcome of that review in a White Paper to the published in the
autumn,'' he said.

The half-point increase in interest rates to 6[3/4]% yesterday was the
third rise in five months as Chancellor Kennneth Clarke made yet another
pre-emptive strike to curb future inflationary pressures.
The move was greeted comfortably in financial markets, where it had
been largely discounted, but disappointed the building societies
although, for the time being anyway, they are holding back from lifting
their own lending rates.
The Halifax, Britain's biggest society, which led a recent round of
mortgage increases in response to the December base rate rise, expressed
its disappointment, but said it saw no immediate need change interest
rates though it will have to keep the situation under review.
Abbey National, the second-largest mortage lender, said it was
reluctant to increase mortgage rates and the Nationwide Building Society
said it was reviewing the situation. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, which held
its rates steady after previous increases, said it would not be
reviewing its rates until April, that there is no possible rise before
May 1 and that will depend on other lenders.
The trend in interest rates still looks to be up and at some stage
mortgage lenders are bound to follow suit which does not do the housing
market any favours.
Yesterday's rise, which followed the regular monthly monetary meeting
between the Chancellor and Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George,
comes hard on the heels of a similar increase in US short-term rates. It
was not only the building societies, which are influenced by the current
state of the housing market, that thought the increase in rates was
uneccessary.
Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British
Industry, commented: ''In our view domestic conditions did not require a
further rise in rates. Taking full account of recent CBI surveys and
information from the housing market and the behaviour of monetary
aggregates, our judgment is that inflation remains under control.''
He admitted that the decision was finely balanced, and the US move
certainly put pressure on the authorities here.
The general view in financial markets was probably expressed by the
Royal Bank of Scotland's chief economist Jeremy Peat as the clearing
banks hoisted their base rates.
He commented: ''The further increase is not unexpected, given the
evidence of continued strong growth of GDP and signs of some capacity
constraints emerging. The markets' expectation of such a move was
reinforced by Thursday's half-point increase in US interest rates.''
But Mr Peat also pointed to inevitable downside implications,
particularly when some aspects of the economy -- such as the housing
market -- remain weak. Even so, he regards the Chancellor's action as
prudent at this stage, aimed at enhancing the prospects of stable low
inflation growth over the next two or three years.
''It is better for the Chancellor and Governor to act pre-emptively,
rather than being seen to act reluctantly and belatedly.''
In making his move, Mr Clarke said that on the balance of risks, a
further increase in interest rates will help to keep inflation under
control. He also said that the UK's economic recovery was ''healthy and
well balanced'', founded on a remarkable improvement in competitiveness
across British industry, with growth generated by exports.
The Chancellor also emphasised, as has Mr George on several occasions,
that market perceptions through futures tend to exaggerate the risk of
sharply higher interest rates.
Further evidence, though, of the fragility of the housing market comes
with the latest Halifax House Price Index. This shows house prices fell
by 0.1% in January, less that the decline reported on Wednesday by the
Nationwide, and that the underlying trend in house prices shows a very
flat picture with no evidence of recovery.
However, recent movements in house prices remain consistent with the
Society's view that prices will rise by 2% to 3% during the course of
the year. The Nationwide is predicting much the same but both societies
had started 1994 looking for reasonable increases which fell away as the
year progressed.
The Treasury's monthly monetary report, also released yesterday, said
monthly indicators were mixed. Some pointed to a moderation in the pace
of growth, while others showed a more buoyant picture.
Retail sales continued on an upward trend although this has flattened
off recently. The report said that moderately lower output growth in the
second half of 1994 may have been concentrated in the manufacturing
sector but it also points to CBI survey data suggests an acceleration in
manufacturing output in the final quarter of last year.
Share markets ignored the rate increase with the FTSE-100 Share Index
closing up 17.4 at 3034.7. It was up 22 points at one stage but
succumbed to light profit-taking.
Government securities, which had suffered early falls, recovered on
the rate increase which was regarded as positive while in foreign
exchange markets the rise was already discounted and made little impact
on sterling.

PARANOIA has always been one of the great players in Scottish
football. Old Perse Complex has been there, done it all, and worn the
shirt of just about every club in the land, but we didn't think the day
would come when he made it all the way to the top of the hill mob. Yet
there he was in midweek sharing a desk with the chief executive of the
SFA, peering over his shoulder as the Man On High rolled a few tablets
of fury down the mountain.
Whatever else he has been accused of over the years in his role as
guardian of the football proprieties, Jim Farry has never been
considered unintelligent. Pompous he can be, yes; Rigid, yes; and, yes,
he does give pronouncements from above in a kind of Farryese which only
those who compile insurance policies would comprehend. Nor is he one to
tolerate what he sees as incompetence. But foolish? No.
That is why his mass condemnation of the football writing brigade of
Scotland was so unexpected. His distaste for much of the excesses of
modern football reporting has been well known for some time and he would
find many empathetic ears in the football world when he makes that
point. He would even find a fair number of those directly employed in
that end of the business who would go along with him some of the way.
But when the man at the heart of the game insists that ''everyone''
who writes about the game in this country is ''doom laden'' and
collectively ''the worst in the world for being negative'', he has
clearly opened the door to our old pal, Perse.
The diatribe was bizarre enough in itself, but in response to a survey
of fans carried out by another newspaper, it seemed positively
eccentric. However much influence the hacks around the country may have,
it does not stretch to lobbying 1000 citizens to condemn football for
the benefit of a rival blatt.
Farry is right when he says that there is a general Scottish disease
which entails destroying something that is praiseworthy. It is a
peculiar Celtic trait which allows us to cheer ''Scots Wha' Hae'' and
then throw the singers out of the pub (Wha', indeed , is like us?). But
in terms of the standard of our football, Farry himself has expressed
his concern about the poorer quality and what it might do to our
standing in Eurrope.
It is true that he and his association have put in a lot of work and
organisation, at which he is expert, in trying to redress the balance,
to restructure the game from its grass roots. And maybe the SFA does not
get enough credit for that aspect of its duties.
They are, after all, the paid employees of the football clubs and, if
the great minds who people the board rooms of the game have better ideas
on how to bring football back to a better level, they are free to knock
on the Farry door any time.
The chief executive has every right to have a go at those who have a
go at him -- there is nothing like a good old barney to stimulate
interest -- but he did not give his usual meticulous attention to
accuracy this time. In fact, he sounded a bit sensationalist to me.
Tabloid, even.

AMBITIOUS Fife Flyers last night confirmed the signing of former
National Hockey League hit-man Laurie Bochman, who has more than 1000
games under his belt in the world's top league.
Kirkcaldy rink manager John Brady said: ''This is the signing coup of
the season.''
The 34-year-old Bochman spent eight years with Winnipeg, two with New
Jersey, and a year each at Edmonton and Ottawa, logging 2020 sin bin
minutes in 1009 games.
Doug Smail, who makes his comeback for the club tomorrow after a
five-month lay-off caused by business committments, is a friend of
Bochman and helped clinch the deal.
Bochman hung up his skates in the NHL in 1993, but has kept in trim
playing recreational hockey. The 6ft 1in, 185lb powerhouse will jet in
at the end of this month, and Brady added: ''We've had a tremendous crop
of injuries and need cover until the end of the season.
''Laurie is a quality player and will strengthen our bid to win the
British championship for the first time in nine years.''

<HEADLINE>Drug abusers hit by Operation Rumble</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980041889</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCORES of drug abusers have been caught in a police operation in
Dumfries and Galloway, it was revealed yesterday.
The police launched Operation Rumble one month ago, and so far 83
people have been detained and searched and 78 offences reported to the
procurator-fiscal.
Some 48 premises have been searched, and controlled drugs with a
street value of thousands of pounds have been recovered, including
cannabis, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamine, and temazepam. Police
said they were surprised by the quantity of drugs recovered.
A unit of 13 CID, drugs squad and uniformed officers, was formed to
carry out the operation, which is continuing.
Detective Superintendent Fred Newton, head of the CID, said yesterday:
''The initiative reflects our commitment to address the problem of drug
misuse in this region.
''Potential targets are being identified through intelligence and
information from local sources.''
He said the campaign would touch almost every community in Dumfries
and Galloway and added: ''The message is simple: if you are involved in
using or supplying controlled drugs, you could be the next target for
Operation Rumble. You have to ask yourself if it is worth the risk.''
The number of recorded drugs offences has increased in the region
during the past few years, in line with the national trend, a police
report on the operation states.
''While much speculation exists as to the extent of the problem in
thisarea, it would be foolish simply to ignore it and its impact on
local communities and families,'' it adds.
The recently published findings of the Ministerial Drugs Task Force
described drug abuse in Scotland as ''a serious and escalating
problem''.
They identified the need for more effective community action by
bringing together voluntary and statutory agencies in a co-ordinated and
positive manner to tackle the problem, the police report says.

MINISTERS should be quarantined for two years after relinquishing
office and before taking up jobs with firms with which their departments
might have had dealings, two former Tory Cabinet members proposed
yesterday.
Speaking at the Nolan inquiry investigating standards in public life,
Lord Younger of Prestwick, the former Secretary of State in the Scottish
Office and at the Ministry of Defence, and Sir Norman Fowler, a former
chairman of the Tory party, both came up with the almost identical
suggestion about a two-year rule, similar to one enforced on senior
civil servants
Both of them made it clear that they were not criticising former
colleagues, but were instead were suggesting a new way forward.
They also proposed that any former Minister would require the approval
of an independent committee before joining a company that had dealings
with their former department within the two year period.
Had such a ruling been in force Conservative Governments might have
been spared embarrassment, following the publicity which has been
critical of former Ministers on their departure from office.
Both former Ministers have now embarked on new careers outside of
politics. Lord Younger is the chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Sir Norman said that there were certain outside jobs that should be
barred to back-bench MPs. Top of the list was a paid consultancy with a
parliamentary lobbying company, he told the Nolan inquiry team.
Lord Younger also gave evidence on remunerations to back benchers. He
had no doubt that they should be free take up such opportunities.
However, he was clear that MPs should not accept payment for answering
questions in the House of Commons.
Lord Younger said he would never have considered moving directly from
the Ministry of Defence to take up a directorship with a major
contractor in the defence industry. ''That would have been pretty
foolish and one would expect to be criticised,'' he told the committee.
Discussing the difference between Ministers and civil servants --
Ministers might have to leave office overnight whereas civil servants
might have a pension to fall back on -- Lord Younger said that Ministers
had to take the rough with the smooth. It was a phrase later echoed by
Sir Norman when he gave evidence.
Lord Armstrong, the former secretary to the Cabinet Office told the
committee that the Child Support Agency should never have been set up,
and certainly not in its current form.
The agency has involved civil servants chasing absent parents in an
unfair position, the former head of the Home Civil Service said.
He also took pains to defend former Ministers over allegations of a
misuse of powers -- not least the recent appointment of Lord Wakeham as
a non-executive director of N M Rothschild and Sons Ltd. Lord Armstrong
is also a director of the company.

A SENSE of injustice is powerful fuel for motivating the mind and
driving the legs, so visitors to Birmingham's National Arena this
weekend should be prepared for some aggressive Scottish running.
The AAA indoor championships, being staged there tonight and tomorrow,
will largely determine the contenders for the world indoor championships
in Barcelona next month, as well as the British team to face France next
weekend in Glasgow's Kelvin Hall.
Among those who believe they should be included are Glen Stewart and
Ian Campbell, both overlooked for the Great Britain international
against Russia last weekend, despite being ranked fastest in the UK this
year in their respective events.
Stewart, in winning the Scottish West district 3000 metres title last
month, clocked 8min 09.4sec, which put him more than a second ahead of
his nearest UK rival. Campbell was even more harshly treated. A Scottish
native record of 3-45.26 for 1500m put him more than five seconds clear
of his UK opponents. Neither made the team. Nor did Aileen McGillivray,
fastest woman in the country over 60m at the time the team was chosen.
''I'm really displeased at being overlooked,'' said Stewart, the
Scottish outdoor 1500m champion. ''The world indoor 3000m qualifying
time is 7-56, and I believe I am capable of that in the right race. I
think I can win this weekend, and that might help me get a quality race
where the time would be more readily achieved.
''I was surprised not to be in the Russia team. Phil Mowbray, who has
never beaten me on a running track was chosen -- yet has never run
indoors. Then Tony Whiteman, who is slower than me over 1500m, was
called in as a reserve.
''If I had set my sights particularly on the indoors, I would be
raging. Fortunately, it's only a means to an end. Outdoors is my main
target.''
His father, Lachie, the former Commonwealth 10,000m champion, has
heated views on the treatment meted out to Scots. ''They should remember
it is a British Athletic Federation, not an English one,'' he said.
''Even if it costs more to get Scots to meaningful races, they have an
obligation to do so.''
Likely rivals in tomorrow's final include Darius Burrows and Steffan
White, third and fourth against Russia last weekend, so Stewart has
every opportunity to make his point.
Campbell, runner-up to Tom McKean for the Scottish 800m title, also
reckons he can make it to Barcelona, but as last year, when he was
initially passed over for the European championships despite being first
Briton in the AAAs, he is having to do it the hard way. His 1500m heats
are tonight, and he looks forward tomorrow to facing Tony Morrell, who,
though slower, won the Scottish title in his absence and a reserve run
against Russia.
City of Glasgow's Mel Neef and teenage Scot Alison Curbishley go in
tonight's women's 400m heats -- Commonwealth and European finalist
Neef's first individual 400m of the winter after eight Scottish records
at shorter distances, while Brian Whittle contests the men's 400m.

Mary Brennan speaks to Michael Mayhew about the shadow of death that
has permeated his work
OF late, Michael Mayhew has been wondering just how strongly he
resembles the men in his family. His father, for instance. His father's
father. And cousin Tony. It's no use looking at photographs. They don't
give away what he wants to know. The clue to his wondering lies in their
death certificates. All three committed suicide. The thought has already
been planted from boyhood, from before he fully understood what it
meant: will he die the same way?
Death and dying have permeated Mayhew's performance work for as long
as either of us can remember. Even when the subject has publicly
declared itself as something else -- sex, religion, love -- the prospect
of death has shadowed the stage. There is, he says, with a skewed grin
crossing his gaunt features: ''No life without it''.
Now, with the latest piece, Die by Suicide, death comes centre-stage.
But a kind of death that carries with it a whole tangle of taboos. Since
the age of 15 -- from 1978, when he had to deal with his father's
suicide -- Mayhew has stalked these taboos, been haunted by them.
Instability, genetic disorder, hereditary disposition . . . You can
almost hear his brain boiling as he leans across the table, talking
rapidly, fiercely, about the medical theories that seem to label him a
likely candidate for self-inflicted death.
And yet, as he goes over the events surrounding his father's suicide,
what he remembers most is how carefully calculated, how considered, this
last act was. ''Frankly, whatever the coroner said, there didn't seem
anything unbalanced about it. His note -- 'sorry son, things didn't work
out . . .' -- was as if he'd weighed things up, decided he'd had enough,
and made his choice. If I've inherited anything, it's not some mental
illness. It's the knowledge that I can make that choice. I can take my
own life.''
That choice, in a world where individual choices seem more and more
constrained by outside agencies is, for him, empowerment. The ultimate
means of self-expression, undertaken with as much reverence, as much
thought and preparation as a work of art.
Only, of course, that's not always how it is. He agrees that, for too
many people, it's a desperate waste. A panic measure, carried out
without any real understanding of the consequences.
''People feel isolated, confused, unhappy -- and there's nowhere,
no-one to turn to. It's another taboo. We just don't open up in this
society. We don't talk about the things that really affect our lives,
the things that drive us to our deaths. And we don't talk about those
deaths either. We just shroud everything in silence and in myth.'' This
attitude obviously angers and distresses him. It compels him to take
issue with it in his work. Together with his partner, Becky Edmonds,
Mayhew has gone about exposing both the myth and the silence.
For months now they've been gathering together historical fact and
personal stories, images from lives that have been touched by suicide
(some famous, some completely unknown), statistics from reports that
itemise gender, age, method, time, and place -- but ultimately do
nothing to help us understand why. Some of this research -- including
material from their recent Glasgow residency -- will feature in an
exhibition called The Clarity of Self-Execution that can be seen while
they are performing at the CCA in early February.
''Meeting people, talking through their experiences -- and we've had a
really powerful response to this -- makes you realise how much suicide
figures in everyone's thoughts. And how hard it is to have any kind of
dispassionate conversation about it.''
Though the subject is so close to his own life, he won't actually
appear in the show itself. ''We've made it a solo for Becky. Yes, I
suppose you could say she's the melting pot for my experiences and for
the other histories we've researched. And maybe, as I'm getting older,
into my thirties, I feel I can stand back from it a bit. I can watch and
say, 'Yeah, I know that feeling. I've got some of that darkness inside
me'. I can, in a way, really claim my own life because I know that I can
end it . . .''
* Mayhew and Edmonds are appearing at the CCA, Glasgow, tonight and
tomorrow as part of the Bad Times season.

The weekend snow -- and the forecast of another few days of freezing
temperatures -- brought a reminder that January and February is the time
for thermal underwear in Scotland. But is it worth paying top prices or
should you head for the chain store? We put several garments to the test
in icy Braemar in a week when the official morning temperature readings
did not rise above freezing point and reached a low of
-10C on Monday morning. Three people whose jobs involve spending a
large amount of time outside each tried three readily-available
garments.
Anti-freeze action: the long and short of it
CATHERINE Bagan and her family are experiencing their first winter in
Braemar since taking over the village garage after five years in
Australia.
''We've gone from one extreme to the other. I really was not prepared
for this degree of coldness. It is well below freezing when we open up
the garage in the morning and scrape the ice off the windows.
''People kept telling me I would need thermals in the winter, but I
thought that was a bit of an exaggeration, because we had a garage
before in Burntisland and I did not wear them then. Since I have tried
these, however, I have realised that they do make a difference. I have
tried some men's ones because they are thicker and my husband wears them
in the workshop, but the ladies' are much more comfortable.
She tried sleeveless vests from Damart and Littlewoods and a
long-sleeved one from Marks &amp; Spencer. The long-sleeved version proved
the warmest, but she thought that a long-sleeved version of the Damart
one would have rated the same on warmth. The Littlewoods version's only
plus point was the price. It was considerably shorter than the other
two, was skimpier and generally thinner. ''You just would not have known
you had on an extra layer,'' said Catherine, who usually wears a polo
neck topped by a cardigan but found that with a thermal vest she did not
always need to add her down bodywarmer when she went to the petrol
pumps.
The overall winner was the Marks &amp; Spencer vest which Catherine rated
higher than Damart on the soft feel of the material and on the prettier,
more feminine styling. ''You would not expect style to matter, but up
here it is so cold you have to wear trousers and woollies all the time
and it is nice to have something more feminine.''
Mrs Bagan's 16-year-old daughter, Bernadette, also tried out the vests
-- after a scornful initial reaction -- and also rated M&amp;S top.
Thermal factor on top at 15 below
GORDON Rattray, who spends the winter months teaching primary school
children to ski and taking them on hillwalking expeditions, realised a
20-year ambition to live and work in the mountains two years ago when he
and his wife set up the Braemar Heritage Centre.
He has always dismissed thermal underwear as unnecessary and has worn
cotton T-shirts as his bottom layer. After testing three vests, he says
all are warmer than a T-shirt. In a week when the temperature on the
hills reached -15C taking wind chill into account, he found he was
''toasting'' in both Damart and Marks &amp; Spencer.
The Littlewoods version was slightly less warm but was rated lowest
because it was the least comfortable. ''The neck was cut too high and
the edge rolled in, making it very uncomfortable under a polo neck.''
Damart also lost out on the comfort factor. ''It was beautifully made,
but because it had heavy stitching round the neck and arms, it was also
slightly uncomfortable.''
Marks &amp; Spencer took top place for comfort, warmth and fit -- and
Gordon also liked the feel of the cloth. He will buy more.
How to home in on comfort
MOUNTAINEER and Nordic ski instructor Malcolm MacIntyre wears thermal
underwear for a large part of his life -- often the ranges designed
specifically for sports, which can be very expensive. He reckons the
best value specialist range is North Cape at #25 for a long-sleeved,
zip-neck version.
He tested a short-sleeved vest from Damart, Marks &amp; Spencer and
British Home Stores and found the best performance from the cheapest. He
rated the #8.99 BHS version best for both warmth and the ability of the
material to wick sweat away from the body. By that test, Marks &amp; Spencer
performed worst with a material which trapped moisture although it was
otherwise very comfortable.
''It would be fine for someone just wearing it for going about in cold
weather, but not for winter sports,'' he said. ''On comfort alone, I
would rate BHS best, Marks &amp; Spencer second, and Damart third, but for
warmth and wicking it would be 1, BHS; 2, Damart; and 3, Marks &amp;
Spencer.'' His advice to anyone looking particularly for warmth is to
choose a fabric with a high level of viscose.

EVEN after 47 years as a band leader, Humphrey Lyttelton still bounces
on stage with the energy of a man half his age, and still presents his
audience with a programme of classily arranged tunes and a group of
world-class musicians.
Hyper Humph excelled himself on trumpet and
bopping-around-in-the-background duties, and the rest of his merry band
turned out equally creditable performances. But with the exception of
two numbers (Porgy and One Day I Met an African), it was all a little
flat -- until the arrival of special guest Joe Temperley, the New
York-based Scots-born baritone saxophonist.
It may have been Humph's band, but it was Joe's show. We knew we were
in for a treat from note one of Temperley's first featured number --
Prelude to a Kiss. Deliciously slow (and succulent), if this was just
the prelude, it must have been a helluva kiss. The undoubted highlight
of the evening was a tantalisingly short set by Temperley and a rhythm
section of Stan Greig (piano), Paul Bridge (bass), and Adrian MacIntosh
(drums).
Temperley proved why he is one of the most sought after baritone
players in the world: his sax was sophisticated and swinging.
Switching to soprano sax, Temperley gave us a magnificent version of
Jeep's Blues -- a masterpiece of majestic moaning and elegant wailing --
which was only matched in the knock-out stakes by his unaccompanied duet
with tenor saxist Kathy Stobart on There Will Never Be Another You (aka
The Sheep's Song).
Catch Joe and Humph tonight in Edinburgh's Queen's Hall and tomorrow
in Glasgow City Hall.

LABOUR'S lead over the Tories has slipped in the past few weeks, but
they remain a huge 36 points ahead, according to the latest poll.
The party party is down 2.5 points from last month, after suffering
internal rows over Clause 4 and education, in addition to the attack on
their devolution plans led by the Prime Minister.
Labour is now on 59.5%, the Tories on 23.5%, the Liberal Democrats on
13% and others on 4%, according to a Gallup poll for today's's Daily
Telegraph. Asked how they would react to the election of Labour under Mr
Blair, 31% of voters said they ''would be delighted'', 54% said they
''wouldn't mind'' and only 14% said they ''would be dismayed''.

CONDUCTOR Michael Stern brought a generously proportioned programme to
Edinburgh last night, but it was Nikolai Demidenko who galvanised it
with a high-profile performance of Schumann's Piano Concerto and, as an
encore, an electrifying Erlkonig.
Nobody could accuse Demidenko of lightness of touch, and there were
moments in the first movement of the Schumann when he seemed intent on
disrupting the flow of the music with bouts of heavy expressiveness. But
when he let fly, the effect was startling, especially in so small a
concert hall.
This was power-steering of an exhilarating kind, with passage-work so
vividly articulated and so rhythmically alive that the finale crackled
like Prokofiev.
Earlier there had been Mozart's ''little'' G minor symphony, No 25, in
which the SCO sounded over-tense. But the tensions of Shostakovich's
Chamber Symphony Op 110 -- which, in Rudolf Barshai's arrangement, is an
inflation of his eighth string quartet -- were keenly captured with
strong, clear string sonorities, even if its most memorable moments were
provided by Ruth Crouch's ghostly strands of violin tone in the first
movement.
After this, at the end of a long evening, Kodaly's Galanta Dances
could only seem redundant, though they were played with considerable
verve and with pungent timbres, crisp detail, and the deftest of tempo
changes.
Concert sponsored by Caledonian Bank plc.
The programme will be repeated this evening at the Music Hall,
Aberdeen.

Scottish executives vote on leader characteristics
SIR Ian Wood, one of the few local success stories in the North East's
oil service industry, is considered by his peers to be the best example
of a business leader in Scotland, a survey published today reveals.
Self-made businessman Tom Farmer, whose Kwik-Fit motor repair business
mushroomed from humble beginnings, and Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden,
executive chairman of packaging company Macfarlane Group (Clansman), are
also held in high esteem.
Sir Ian is the driving force behind Aberdeen-based John Wood Group. He
is the epitome of a business leader to nearly 17% of main board
directors in Scotland's top 500 companies.
The survey of more than 100 senior Scottish executives, conducted by
MORI for accountancy major KPMG, revealed that turning visions into
reality (45%) and the ability to motivate (39%) were considered the most
important leadership characteristics.
Meanwhile, Mr Farmer, whose Kwik-Fit chain now has nearly 800 outlets
and employs 5500 people, believes the key to leadership success is to
''make sure you surround yourself with the best people''.
On the thorny issue of executive pay levels, the survey reveals 59% of
Scots believe UK business leaders are well paid.
However, 73% of those interviewed felt the UK was short of good
business leaders, with particular admiration expressed for US captains
of industry. Failure to communicate effectively or to take risks, as
well as a lack of creativity and strong sense of purpose, were seen as
the main shortcomings in the UK business world.
Bosses in Scotland, in line with their counterparts elsewhere in
Britain, rate Virgin's Richard Branson as UK number one, in light of his
innovative approach, ability to motivate, sense of purpose,
communication skills and personality.

EXCLUSIVE
Dublin
BRITISH and Irish civil servants have moved signicantly closer to
agreement between London and Dublin on future political structures in
the North, according to informed political sources in Dublin last night.
However, the draft text of a Framework Document, or White Paper, will
be subject to political agreement at a ministerial meeting scheduled for
February 14 between Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish Republic's Foreign
Minister.
In spite of rapid Ulster Unionist opposition fuelled by a leak in the
Times, ''substantial progress'' was reported to have been made at
yesterday's meeting in the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs.
However, officials last night acknowledged that the final political
decisions by the two Governments would have to be taken in the light of
their assessment of Unionist reactions in Northern Ireland to what is
meant to be a basis for all-party political talks in the Province rather
than a blueprint for Irish unification.
Last night, informed sources told the Herald that a formula will be
put to the two Governments on how the Irish Government intends to modify
its territorial claims on Northern Ireland -- expressed in articles two
and three of the Republic's constitution, and enacted in 1937.
This formula, which will commit the Irish Government to a
constitutional referendum, is regarded as crucial by London to balance
proposals for an all-Ireland executive body and for a devolved
parliamentary assembly in Belfast.
Last night, Irish Prime Minister John Bruton insisted that an
All-Ireland body with executive powers should be an essential part of
the proposals.
Earlier, further pressure on the two Governments to press ahead with
the completion of the framework document came from the Fianna Fail
leader, Bertie Ahern.
Addressing the Irish Association in Dublin Mr Ahern urged the two
Governments to publish the document as early as possible. ''Neither
Government should be deflected in any way from completing the document
in the manner in which they intended,''he said.
The Minister for Social Welfare, Mr Proinsias de Rossa, said he did
not think that the Irish Government should water-down the document
because of the Ulster Unionist objections over the leak. Mr Major's
response to the threat to the Northern Ireland peace process was praised
by Opposition leaders in the Dublin parliament.
Mr Ahern said Mr Major had adopted ''a statesmanlike approach'', and
Mary Harney, head of the Progressive Democrats, said he had reacted
positively.
She added: ''It might have been easier for Mr Major to take a
different approach -- given his domestic political difficulties.''
Meanwhile, Irish President Mary Robinson yesterday emphasised the
importance of maintaining the peace process in Ireland when she
addressed a joint session of the two houses of the Dublin parliament.
She told the Dail and Senate of the 70 million people worldwide who
could claim Irish descent.
''The truest way of cherishing our diaspora is to offer them at all
times the reality of this island as a place of peace where the many
diverse traditions are bound together in tolerance and understanding,''
she said.
Mrs Robinson was making her second joint address to parliament since
being elected president in 1990.
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams yesterday called on the Irish
Government to press London to start all-party talks. He said Irish
Premier John Bruton should ''be putting it to London that London and
Dublin lead the rest of us into all-party talks''.
Unionist opposition to the framework document reflected their desire
to retain the status quo, but there would have to be political and
constitutional change and the talks were needed now, he said.
''The framework document has been two-and-a-half years in the making.
How much longer should we wait, how much longer can we wait? How much
longer will the British delay?''

ARAGON Ayr, owned by a group of 35 members, will not lack vocal
support from his big Borders following in the Pat's Jester Morebattle
Hurdle at Kelso today.
Peter Monteith's seven-year-old was a winner six days ago at Ayr but
faces a stiff task in taking on Large Action, who won the Bula Hurdle at
Cheltenham and is second favourite for the Champion Hurdle, as well as
Mrs Mary Reveley's pair, Batabanoo and Surrey Dancer.
Although Aragon Ayr won three times last season and is an improving
type, he is 2st 8lb out of the handicap.
Batabanoo's seven victories include the Fighting Fifth Hurdle at
Newcastle, where he beat Surrey Dancer by three-and-a-half lengths.
The line-up of eight for the first prize of #7000 includes Borders
horses Coqui Lane and the lowly-rated Daphnis -- 5st 10lb out of the
handicap.
The race has been named in honour of Pat's Jester, owned by Kelso
director Geoff Adam. A former Scottish Champion Hurdler and second to
The Fellow in the King George two years ago, Pat's Jester -- winner of
#120,000 -- was retired after having broken down at Wetherby in
December.
Clay County, another Kelso favourite, will be well supported in the
Carlsberg Rutherford Handicap Chase despite carrying top weight. He has
has most to fear from Sherwood's Leotard and Mrs Reveley's triple
course-winner Terrible Gel.
Kelso hosts the season's first hunter chase, in which Norman
Dalgetty's Davy Blake will be a warm favourite to repeat last year's
success.

<HEADLINE>Wood warns of Irish backlash.  New hero is 'just a rookie'</HEADLINE>

RATHER like ourselves, the Irish have been in a state of flux for a
few seasons, and in such times rugby heroes are quickly built up and
knocked down.
Simon Geoghegan may be the current darling of Lansdowne Road. But in
terms of ''world class'' -- a term too often thrown around in sport --
the Irish reckon they've got at least three guys in that category.
Ireland's front row of Nick Popplewell, Keith Wood, and Peter Clohessy
are promoted by some experts to be as good as any other unit in world
rugby. Certainly, they starred in the Barbarians' win over the
Springboks in Dublin last year.
But for Wood, the junior member of that triumvirate, there is still a
lot to prove before they start believing the gossip.
''The idea of us being the best in the world,'' the Garryowen hooker
mused. ''Well, I've heard that and it's nice of people to say it.
''But I still just see myself as a rookie. Twenty caps down the line
I'll be in a position to pass comment and assess where I, and those
around me, stand. Just now, I'm still trying to establish myself.''
The 22-year-old Limerick building society official has been receiving
extensive treatment on a neck injury all week to guarantee him a second
Five Nations' Championship appearance and only his fifth cap.
Following in the footsteps of dad Gordon, who played in the famous
green jersey during the 50s and 60s, Wood Jr learned his trade fast,
growing up quickly Down Under during last summer's Test series against
world champions Australia.
The 20-8 defeat by England a fortnight ago dented Irish pride. But,
says Wood, Scotland may feel the backlash.
''The Five Nations' Championship is still on offer to Ireland,''
believes Wood, even after that defeat. ''Obviously, we now need others
to do us a favour. But there are three games to be won, and we'll be
taking the lessons learned from the England experience into the game
against Scotland.''
Ireland tomorrow will be chasing their first victory in Edinburgh
since 1985, and it is a challenge Wood sees as vital to a much bigger
test this summer.
''We need a booster -- just one match to get us up and going in the
lead up to the World Cup in South Africa. We've spoken about that and we
have identified the game in Edinburgh as the one to win.''

* SOUTH Africa will not support New Zealand proposals to repeal rugby
union's current amateur provisions, according to their chairman.
New Zealand chairman Eddie Tonks claimed last weekend that he favoured
performance-based contracts and added that the NZRFU would argue the
case for professionalism at next month's International Rugby Board
meeting in Bristol.
But the chairman of the South African Rugby Football Union's
disciplinary and amateur status committee, Lex Mpati, said his union
supported the current amateur regulations.
''I foresee the dangers of players striking for better pay,'' he said.
''It's a dangerous precedent and I would argue against that.''
SARFU general manager Arie Oberholzer added: ''We haven't seen New
Zealand's proposals. We think the present system should be changed, but
at the same time there is a need to protect the ethos of the game.''

WELLCOME, battling to remain out of the clutches of Glaxo, published
annual results at the top end of City expectations yesterday, showing a
19% increase in pre-tax profits to #738m, excluding exceptional items.
Underlying group sales grew by 13% to #2276m and there is a final
dividend of 16p a share, taking the total shareholders' payment for the
year to 30.4p. A combination of cost efficiency and volume growth,
rather than price rises, was behind the increase in operating margin
from 29.5% to a record 31.5%.
Commenting on the figures John Robb, Wellcome's chairman and chief
executive, said: ''These record-breaking results for 1994 show in very
clear terms the strength of Wellcome's business and prospects''.
The results were originally scheduled for 1 March but were brought
forward to reinforce Wellcome's claim that Glaxo is trying to buy a
growth company on the cheap. Sales growth was achieved in all geographic
territories but government healthcare reforms limited growth in Europe.
Within the drug portfolio, sales of its best-selling drug Zovirax,
used to treat herpes, continued to grow. In the 12 months to December
1994, Zovirax sales were 16% higher at #858m, with a notably strong
performance in Japan.
However, Retrovir, marketed as AZT and used in the treatment of HIV
infection, showed a drop of 7% to #206m. This was attributed to lower
usage by asymptomatic patients.
Spending on research and development rose by 5% to #346m. The company
is focusing on three therapeutic areas: antiviral, central nervous
system, and oncology. During the course of 1994, filings in 27 countries
were made for Valtrex, the successor product to Zovirax for the
treatment of shingles.
The first approvals for this were granted last month in the UK and
Ireland. Wellcome's anti-depressant drug Wellbutrin is being clinically
tested as a product to help people stop smoking. The studies are
expected to be completed by April 1995.
Wellcome's balance sheet strengthened considerably during the year
with net cash rising by #163m to #781m.
Now that Wellcome's results have been published, potential white
knights may emerge from the shadows but the City is not betting on it.
Earlier this week, Hoechst, the big German chemical and pharmaceutical
group, appeared to rule itself out. This followed news that it was close
to securing a controlling stake in Marion Merrill Dow in the US.
Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceuticals, nutrition and chemicals group, is
out of the bidding and so Wellcome's hopes of a rescue rest in America
with such companies as Bristol Myers-Squibb, Johnson and Johnson, and
Merck. A Wellcome spokesman confirmed that a rival bidder was actively
being sought. ''Our directors and advisers are travelling extensively,''
he said.
Glaxo, currently bidding #9000m for Wellcome, is expected to dispatch
its final offer document next week along with half-year results brought
forward from February 16.
Responding to the Wellcome announcement, Sir Richard Sykes, chief
executive of Glaxo, said the commercial logic of his company's bid was
still clear.
He reiterated his claim that key success factors going forward in the
pharmaceutical industry included a strong position in a consolidating
global industry, critical mass in research and development, and an
infrastructure and resources to maximise product efficiency and ensure
rapid penetration of products on an international scale.
''We remain convinced that a merged Glaxo Wellcome is the right way
forward to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing environment in the
pharmaceutical industry and to maintain a British company at the
forefront of this market,'' said Sir Richard.
Time does appear to be running out for Wellcome as an independent
entity. City analysts believe that the price Glaxo has agreed to pay for
Wellcome is probably too high for any US firm to beat.
Glaxo looks likely to win the battle for Wellcome although it may have
to pay more money to secure a recommendation from the board.
Yesterday Wellcome added 7p to 1005p while Glaxo gained 20p to 646p.

NOW in its 50th anniversary year, the Citizens' Theatre across the
Clyde springs into action from February to May with a packed programme
encompassing everything from Jacobean tragedy to the effects of the
Holocaust on the new Europe.
Music and comedy play their necessary parts in the overall scheme of
things and Scotland's rival cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow enjoy their
own cameos, courtesy of The Citizens' Company. Thomas Middleton, Harold
Pinter and Virginia Woolf have their words made flesh while tear-jerking
Terry Neason and thought-provoking Wildcat leap into performance with
brand-new productions. But who is Sir Christopher Vainwean?
The new season opens with Thomas Middleton's powerful play of lust,
incest, jealousy, and power politics from a bygone age, Women Beware
from February 3 to 25 in the main theatre. With a Citizens' company
which includes rising star Anne Lambton, Gerard McArthur in Strindberg's
The Father last year and Anne Myatt from lochside TV soap Take The High
Road, this taut tale of Jacobean jiggery pokery is a key production in
every sense.
It will certainly unlock a voucher entitling patrons to a free ticket
for any one of the five Citizens' company productions later in the
season providing two tickets, either #6 or #2 have been purchased. Phone
the Box Office on 0141 429 0022 to reserve seats.
Citizens' stalwarts Giles Havergal, Robert David MacDonald and Philip
Prowse contribute to what promises to be one of the theatre's most
exciting seasons in its history. Philip Prowse has directed and designed
Women Beware, Giles Havergal has adapted and will direct The Citizens'
Company production of Jeff Torrington's award-winning Glasgow novel
Swing Hammer Swing from March 10 until April 1 and Robert David
MacDonald has written and will direct the company's persons unknown with
a haunting Casper Hauser theme from May 3 to 20.
Other Citizens' company productions are the acclaimed Edinburgh drugs
drama Train Spotting from February 23 until March 18, Harold Pinter's
incisive comedy of sexual manners Betrayal from March 30 until April 22
and Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Double from March 29 until April 22.
Among the visiting companies in the months ahead are 7:84 Theatre
Company Scotland in Born Guilty which explores the impact of the Second
World War on the new Europeans from April 27 until May 13 and Wildcat in
the two Davys -- Anderson and MacLennan's musical political farce,
Bedfellows, from April 26 until May 13.
Comic character Sir Christopher Vainwean bears a fleeting resemblance
to what some crossword addicts might loosely describe as ''a weel kent
Scots Tory MP of fair pedigree not in the nick''. The ayes have it, full
houses all round.

ENGLAND v FRANCE
RECALLED France lock Olivier Brouzet fears tomorrow's Five Nations'
Championship match with England at Twickenham could turn into a brawl.
''There are many things I don't like in English rugby, starting with
their aggressive style based on rucking,'' said Brouzet, brought back
for Olivier Merle, who was dropped for butting Wales prop Ricky Evans in
Paris last month.
''I don't know if they will provoke us or if they will play rugby. It
will be physically tough, but we will not bow.''
The Merle incident sparked a number of inflammatory articles in the
English press and Brouzet hopes they will not affect tomorrow's match,
already dubbed ''le crunch'' as a possible decider for the Five Nations'
title.
Brouzet, 23, who wins his third cap on Saturday, is not worried at the
prospect of facing one of the toughest packs in the world.
''I don't know what the atmosphere will be like on the pitch,'' he
said. ''But after colliding with two or three English players in the
first three minutes, I will get an idea.''
Brouzet was a member of the French team who had a historic 2-0 series
winover New Zealand last year, but played only four minutes of Test
rugby as a replacement.
''It was a bit frustrating, but I will never forget those four
minutes,'' he said. ''I know I was called up this time because Merle was
dropped, but I want to prove what I'm really worth. It's not easy to win
a place in the team.''
England captain Will Carling refused, as always, to become involved in
the now-routine war of words that precedes Anglo-French matches.
''France are the side that I admire most and my respect has increased
since they won a Test series in New Zealand last year.
''That was a great achievement and I simply don't go along with these
anti-French feelings. In the last couple of fixtures their discipline
has been very strong, but their magic bothers me.
''We see them as the side to beat, because we have so much admiration
and respect for them.''

SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown yesterday praised Aberdeen for pioneering
a Dutch-style youth programme to improve standards.
He said that the initiative by the Pittodrie club, which clinched a
major sponsorship deal with Hydro-Electric, was an example other clubs
must follow.
Brown said: ''Involving youngsters in smaller-sided games is the way
to develop skills.''
Aberdeen have set up a network of 113 coaches throughout the
north-east to operate the seven-a-side football programme and already
1400 youngsters are involved.
Dons manager Willie Miller said: ''The concept comes from Holland
where some truly magnificent players have been produced.''

Ayr 5, GHK 17.
ON A rain-lashed and sodden Millbrae pitch, both sides contrived to
serve up a remarkably entertaining first half, GHK's surety in the pass
and their ability to mop up any aerial threat from Ayr giving them the
edge.
A George Breckenridge penalty gave the visitors the lead in the
seventh minute but the threats to Ayr's line foundered on solid defence
until 31 minutes, when Gerry Hawkes was impeded as he went for a
delicate Bassi chip to the line. Breckenridge converted the resultant
penalty try.
It was Hawkes, again running back a loose clearance, who set up the
move which led to Bassi, Sanderson, and Hirini putting Brown clear to
give Dom Mellor the scoring pass. Breckenridge's conversion took the
visitors to a 17-0 half-time lead.
The elements eased in the second half, but there was no more scoring,
despite the efforts of Andy Kerr and Jason Barbarich in the lineout and
some powerful Ayr scrummaging, until replacement Craig Dunlop shot
through the GHK midfield defence to put Stewart Magorian in for a
well-earned try. Etheridge's kick was wide.

Gala 43, Haddington 18,
GALA coach Johnny Brown was the first to pay tribute to second
division Haddington, who never gave up in the Netherdale rain last night
and came back with two late tries from Paul Lees and Neville Ross.
Earlier, Gala had made life difficult for them on a greasy pitch,
scoring seven tries, and it could have been more.
The driving play of John Amos, and Robert Hogg's vital lineout takes,
proved the main difference.
Haddington had only a Bryan Craig drop goal and penalty to show for
their earlier efforts.
Gala's first-half tries came from prop Gary Isaac (two), Mark
Moncrieff, and Brian Swan. Later, flanker Mark Ballantyne went over
twice and Tom Weir once, and Changleng converted two tries in each half.

ZIMBABWE teenager Henry Olonga became the first bowler for more than
30 years to be called for throwing in a Test match on the third day of
the first Test against Pakistan.
Olonga, the first black cricketer to play for his country, is only the
sixth specialist bowler to be called for ''chucking'' and the first
since Australian paceman Ian Meckiff against South Africa in 1963.
The 18-year-old, who was called four times while playing for a
President's XI against the tourists last weekend, was no-balled once in
his fifth over yesterday morning.
That was one of the few low points for Zimbabwe as their bowlers, even
without Olonga, who spent a lengthy period off the field with a side
strain, reduced Pakistan to 151 for six at one stage.
A seventh-wicket stand of 120 between Ijaz Ahmed and Inzamam-ul-Haq
took them to 271 for seven at the close, but they still need 74 to avoid
the follow-on.

MURRAY Johnstone has underlined its growing commitment to the venture
capital sector with the purchase of SUMIT Equity Ventures, a small
Birmingham-based fund management company.
No financial details were released about the transaction though Murray
Johnstone is thought to have paid just under #500,000 for SEV which
manages the SUMIT investment trust and two venture capital funds.
SEV holds about #40m in funds under management and its absorption will
take the funds of Murray Johnstone Private Equity, the group's
specialist sector subsidiary, up to around #240m.
The acquisition also adds a final touch to the UK-wide network of MJPE
with Birmingham being added to its existing offices in Glasgow,
Manchester, and London.
''We are confident that they will complement our expanding venture
capital business with their important Birmingham presence,'' Murray
Johnstone's David MacLellan said yesterday.
The Glasgow-based company has built up a good reputation for venture
capital management and the latest acquisition takes Mr McLellan's
specialist managers team up to 20-strong.
SUMIT's injection of business capacity and deal flow will also boost
Murray Johnstone's plans for the imminent launch of a venture capital
trust under the terms of legislation being debated in the wake of the
last Budget.
In the past two years alone Murray Johnstone, which has #4500m under
management overall, took over the venture capital portfolio of Allied
Irish Bank and launched a #40m buy-out fund.

INDEPENDENT airline Air UK increased pre-tax trading profits from a
lowly #15,000 to #2.65m in 1994, prompting an unprecedented public
showing of the private company's results.
Stansted-based Air UK, which flies out of Glasgow, Edinburgh, and
Aberdeen, increased its passenger revenue by 20% to #206.1m during the
year to end-December.
An increase of 28% took the number of Air UK customers passing through
Stansted to one million for the first time, with new routes and more
frequent flights producing economies of scale.
The airline, which recorded a 19% increase in passengers on its
Amsterdam flights to more than 700,000, achieved respective increases of
6% and 20% on its flights from Scotland to Gatwick and Stansted. It
carried a total of 2.6 million passengers.
However, managing director Andrew Gray, who put the profits surge down
to volume growth and cost control, pointed out the pre-tax return was
still only #1 per passenger.
The airline, formed in 1980 through a merger of Air Anglia, British
Island Airways, Air West and Air Wales, employs more than 500 people in
its Scottish operations. Air UK Group is 85% owned by British Air
Transport Holdings, with Dutch partner KLM holding a 14.9% stake.

ILYA Kulik soared to the European men's figure skating title on his
first attempt with a sensational display of nine triple jumps in
Dortmund last night.
Though two were slightly flawed, the Moscow sports student confirmed
the immense promise he showed when he beat a hugely talented field in
the short programme on Wednesday.
Kulik, who won the world junior title two months ago, became only the
second skater outside the pairs since the second world war to capture a
European title on his first attempt.
The first was 1993 champion, Ukraine's Dmitry Dmitrenko, who was
seventh yesterday.
Outstanding though he was, Kulik was surpassed on the night by Olympic
champion Alexei Urmanov, his Russian compatriot, who leaped from sixth
place before the final to snatch the silver medal with a perfect score.
Ukrainian Viacheslav Zagorodniuk secured the bronze medal with
Frenchman Philippe Candeloro, second in the world last year, fourth
after a 'Godfather' routine marred by two jumping mistakes.
Meanwhile, Natalia Mishkutienok and Artur Dmitriev, the 1992 Russian
Olympic pairs champions, have decided to split up.
They also won the 1991 and 1992 European and world titles.

RICHARD Branson has finally secured the official go-ahead for his deal
with Delta Airlines of the US which secures the position of his Virgin
Atlantic Airways in the key transatlantic market.
Virgin will receive revenue of about $150m a year from Delta
bulk-buying a fixed proportion of Virgin's seats for resale in the US.
Mr Branson said the approval from the US Department of Transportation
was so important that it ''basically guarantees Virgin's future.''
''It gives Virgin all the benefits of a big airline without losing any
of the benefits of being a small airline,'' he declared.
The deal will feed passengers from around 400 US cities on to Virgin's
transatlantic flights. A link of the sort negotiated with Delta was
vital to maintain a competitive position. Virgin's arch enemy, British
Airways, has a hub and spoke arrangement with USAir, though
unfortunately for BA the latter is losing money heavily.
The agreement was actually signed last April but the official green
light was held back while the US Department of Transportation put
pressure on the UK Government to give American airlines greater access
to Heathrow.

Ross Finlay finds old virtues in the Volvo 960
THERE are cars which can get you into tight corners, and other cars
which can get you out of them. It is unusual to find a big saloon which
will do both, at least in terms of manoeuvring in confined spaces. At
home, when driving a vehicle into my parking area and turning to face
again towards the road, I have found many cars which simply cannot make
it in a single three-point turn.
This particular movement has shown me what a rotten turning circle
most 4x4s have. Large-size saloons and estates usually need at least one
extra ''cut'', and it is surprising that some quite compact hatchbacks
cannot manage it either. On the other hand, one of the longest cars I
have manoeuvred there recently -- a Volvo 960 -- wheeched round easily.
I have never understood why nobody else has followed Volvo's lead in
providing its substantially proportioned cars with such excellent
turning circles.
The 960 is the biggest Volvo, and an older basic design than the
highly regarded 850. Some subtle restyling at the front end of the
latest version has taken away the previous massive look, but there is no
doubt, from any angle, that the 960 is a solid, upright and bulky piece
of work. It still struggles against wind resistance and wind noise.
Inside it is roomy without being as well packaged as the 850. As
always, though, you can stow plenty of luggage in that generous Volvo
boot. The interior stylists are cagily bringing the 960 ever so closer
to mid-1990s ideas, but I wish they would go further faster, and get rid
of the angularity which, while it may match the general exterior theme,
does make the 960, from the inside, look rather clumsy.
The 2.5-litre GLE I was driving was fitted with the splendid new
engine, a reduced-size version of the full three-litre six-cylinder.
This is a 170bhp 24-valve design which has first-class throttle
response, and a level of refinement which is not just the best Volvo has
achieved. It puts this 960 level with the best of its opposition for
smooth running and flexibility.
I might well go for the extra-cost four-speed automatic transmission,
rather than the five-speed manual which still calls for rather ponderous
movements, but the manual version puts this heavy car through its paces
well. It sprints to 60mph in just over nine seconds, and tops out at a
likely test-track maximum around 125mph. Official fuel returns for the
manual car are about 35mpg at 56mph, 29 at 75 and down to 19mpg around
town.
The GLE stands in the showroom at #22,495, while the price range for
these 2.5-litre saloons runs from #19,500 to #23,795. Volvo has recently
changed the way it prices and specifies its cars. While there are four
equipment levels in this range, all with clearly defined attractions, a
long list of extra-cost options and upgrades is also in the catalogue.
The biggest Volvos have never been the most agile, but front and rear
suspension details have been substantially modified. I thought that body
roll was much reduced, that cornering grip was really good, and that the
960 coped better than previously with mid-corner bumps. However, the
much firmer suspension does reduce the ride quality on ill-maintained
urban roads.
It remains a bulky-feeling car on the swerves, and a sports-handling
contest between the 960 and the 850 would be no real contest at all. Of
course, the 960 is bought as an executive rather than sports saloon.
Basically, the 960 is a very secure feeling car, not just in its safe
handling but also in the amount of engineering which has gone into the
robustness of its structure. The brakes are also powerful and
progressive.
In other words, all the old Volvo features are there, enhanced by an
inspired engine design. Some critics mark down the 960 because it feels
less lively at speed than its direct German rivals, but those familiar
Volvo virtues still have their own special appeal.

BSKYB has contracted out its news-gathering to Reuters, the
international news agency in a deal which is expected to yield
significant savings for the satellite broadcaster.
Reuters will supply and manage UK and global news gathering for the
24-hour Sky News channel, though the latter will retain editorial
control. Reuters will also produce several programmes tailor-made for
Sky News.
No value was put on the deal but analysts predicted savings for BSkyB
in its #27m operating costs of Sky News, with one suggesting around #7m.
It will also mean more resources for Reuters. Maintaining correspondents
around the world is an expensive exercise.
The company has been supplying news on a more limited basis since Sky
News began five years ago and its chief executive Mark Wood commented:
''This agreement will lead to a significant increase in the
news-gathering resources we now commit to Sky News and provides a new
opportunity for us to develop our programme-making expertise.''
Reuters has more than 70 bureaux worldwide, providing coverage for 650
broadcasters in 80 countries, while Sky News can be seen by 70 million
people in four million homes in the UK and 19 million in Europe.
''Sky News is recognised internationally for the high quality of its
news and current affairs programming,'' said chief executive Sam
Chisholm. ''This strength coupled with Reuters' enormous international
infrastructure and facilities, will provide a platform for the global
expansion of Sky News.''
BSkyB is 40% owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, with Pearson
having 14% and Granada 11%. A deal with Reuters for Sky News has been
considered likely following a similar agreement with another company in
the Murdoch empire, Fox Broadcasting. The Murdoch Asian satellite
broadcaster Star TV may well follow.
Reuters is keen to do ''as many deals with as many different people as
possible'', according to its TV director David Kogan.
The latest news helped both shares, with BSkyB up 2[1/2]p at 258p and
Reuters 1[1/2]p firmer at 453[1/2]p.

Madeira
THE centre of attention, so far as the Scottish challenge for the
Madeira Island Open was concerned, shifted to Paul Lawrie yesterday when
he led the contingent of eight with a score of 68, four under par, after
the first round played mainly in bright, cool, and sometimes breezy
weather.
Andrew Coltart, who had a vintage 1994, and Brian Marchbank, who
decidedly did not, were on 69 and Brian Barnes, approaching his golfing
seniority with every evidence of relish, was satisfied with 71, also
below par. The four other Scots were all over par leaving them to
contemplate a harder struggle to survive the cut.
Andrew Sherborne looked likely to lead on his own when he reached the
sixteenth six under par. But bogeys at the last two holes bestowed the
lead on the 32-year-old Spaniard Santiago Luna, without a victory in 11
seasons on the European Tour.
Lawrie, who holed in one during the tournament last year, returned
with enthusiasm renewed after having slipped some 20 places down the
order of merit. After a seven week lay-off, during which he had keyhole
surgery to allow him to straighten his right knee, he missed the cut in
Dubai, but only by a stroke.
Having turned in the par of 36, Lawrie, soon to be a father for the
first time, made his score with four successive birdies from there.
Coltart's 69, his best score in seven rounds over the 6606-yard
precipitous course high above the Atlantic Ocean, beat Gordon Brand Jr,
his World Cup partner and in his company again, by four strokes. The
four long holes did them no favours, for both made a birdie at only one
of them.
Marchbank, who almost lost his card last autumn after a year of dismal
form, returned to the fray refreshed enough to turn in 33, three under,
and hold that figure solidly over the inward half. For his part, Barnes
looked as relieved to be off the course after five hours on it as with
his score.
Of the others who bettered 70, probably the most gratified was the
39-year-old American Bill Malley. He almost turned a nostalgic
expedition into a plundering experience when he returned to the

ANDERSON Group, the Motherwell-based mining equipment specialist, has
been sold by its parent, the Charter group, to a private US company,
Marmon, as part of a $46m cash deal.
The move to Chicago-based Marmon, which has significant mining
equipment interests already, was described by Anderson's chief executive
Alasdair MacLauchlan as ''an excellent marriage'' and good news for the
group's 800 employees, 500 of whom are based in Scotland.
Anderson has been through a tough time, because of the contraction and
rationalisation of the UK coal industry. But there is, Mr MacLauchlan
points out, no product overlap with Marmon's existing mining interests.
Having an American parent should give Anderson better access to the
near billion-tonne-a-year US market for mined coal. Equally Anderson's
existing subsidiaries in Australia and South Africa, and its fledgling
presence in Poland, will give Marmon's coal-mining subsidiary, Long
Airdox, valuable exposure in new overseas coal markets.
''I believe that, of all the companies you could have chosen for
Anderson to link up with, this has to be one of the best,'' added Mr
MacLauchlan, although he did admit that employees would be feeling the
same sense of uncertainty which accompanies any such change of
ownership.
The deal takes Charter, which acquired what was Anderson Strathclyde
in the early 1980s, out of the coal sector altogether. ''We have decided
our future doesn't lie in coal,'' a spokeswoman said.
Marmon, a diversified group with sales of around $5000m and interests
in transport equipment, distribution, and minerals as well as coal
equipment, has, by contrast, decided to play an active role in the
global rationalisation of the coal sector.
It recently bought another mining equipment business, Becorit, in the
English Midlands, from NEI. Anderson is being sold along with the
National Mine Service Company, which distributes and services mining
equipment.
The assets and liabilities being sold had a net book value last March
of #49.8m. Operating profits in the year to last March were #1.9m,
representing less than 4% of Charter's overall pre-tax profits.
Almost all of Anderson Group's Scottish operations are consolidated at
Motherwell. There is a small satellite operation still in Bridgeton,
making idlers and rollers for conveyor systems, employing 16 people. The
main Motherwell plant concentrates on new mining machines and
refurbishing existing cutting equipment for the UK coal-mining industry.
There is also a service facility in Sheffield.
Anderson's Australian and South African subsidiaries are complemented
by a Pittsburgh-based arm in the US, which manufactures hydraulic
equipment and repairs and rebuilds mining machines.
Currently the UK accounts for less than half Anderson's sales, with
American buyers taking up to a third of the new machines the group
makes. Long Airdox is based in West Virginia.

<TEXT>
EDINBURGH Java Trust, the only UK investment trust specialising in the
Indonesian market, saw its value drop by almost one-third as the local
stock market was hit by a range of factors.
Rising interest rates, labour unrest, high inflation, and financial
scandals all conspired to depress the once-booming Djakarta exchange
which fell by 23% in local currency terms last year.
The decline, however, was magnified by a weaker rupiah and in sterling
terms the local market virtually mirrored the 30.7% decline in Java's
net asset value per share to 42.5p.
Run by Edinburgh Fund Managers, the #13m trust generated #285,000 in
revenue, leaving a slight shortfall after #325,000 expenses were taken
into account.
Loss per share thus widened over the year from just under 0.1p to
0.27p, though the managers rightly pointed out that the trust is geared
towards capital growth rather than income. As with previous years, no
dividend is to be paid.
Java favours consumer stocks because they are non-cyclical and
infrastructure-related companies which stand to benefit from Indonesia's
on-going development.
Looking on the positive side, the managers said the latest government
budget showed solid fiscal discipline in order to encourage the private
sector and underlying growth in corporate earnings were running at 30%.

WHOLECROP wheat handled in a similar fashion to grass silage is fast
catching on as a cost effective alternative to straight grass as a
winter feed judging from the reaction of almost 200 farmers who
yesterday attended a conference in Stirling.
The concept of harvesting a cereal crop prior to full ripening is not
new but it is only during the last five years that the idea of using
wheat as a major constituent of the rations for dairy cattle has caught
on.
Basically the wheat can be harvested while it is primarily green with
a dry matter of around 40% and conserved like silage or alternatively
left until it becomes almost yellow with a dry matter approaching 60%.
With the latter option urea has to be applied.
Detailing the benefits nutritionist David Jacklin commented: ''It's
reliable in cold areas. It's flexible with only one harvest while the
nutritional benefits include higher dry matter intake and improvement in
milk production.''
The financial aspect was covered by John Bax of the SAC's grassland
and ruminant department at the Crichton Royal Farm at Dumfries. Mr Bax
said: ''The whole business of making grass silage is becoming extremely
expensive. For example you might conserve 10 tonnes of material but
actually only feed eight. And it is now costing #1.80 per tonne for dry
matter to make grass silage whereas using wholecrop wheat the figure is
nearer #50 and if arable aid payments can be included another #10-#15
can be knocked off that.''
Costings from SAC show that grass comes out as the most expensive
winter fodder with a total of #637 per hectare while wholecrop wheat
comes in at #602 with maize at #562.
The practical advantages of wholecrop have, however, not been
demonstrated conclusively in trials where yield improvements from dairy
cows have so far not been statistically conclusive.
Nonetheless John Owen, who farms 900 acres with 600 cattle near
Kirkintilloch is totally convinced that mixing grass silage and
wholecrop wheat is mthe right recipe.
He said: ''I know there are no strong proven advantages but you get a
feel that something is right. Inevitably it feeds better than it
analyses and besides one crop of this is a lot easier to harvest than
two or three crops of grass in our climate.''
Significantly almost every dairy farmer at the conference who has used
wholecrop cereals reported a marked improvement in herd health.

FEARS were voiced yesterday that the Government was attempting to
ditch its long-standing obligation towards providing vital funding and
facilities to help the growing numbers of Scottish homeless.
If the plan to deny aid to the homeless succeeded, it was claimed,
even more people, particularly the young, would end up begging on the
streets.
Under current law, the Government must provide or fund facilities for
the homeless. However, Mr Ian Blackwood, vice president of the National
Union of Civil and Public Servants, said attempts were being made to
slip a clause through Parliament which would leave this to the Social
Security Minister's discretion.
Campaigners for the homeless argued that such a move would spell
disaster and was liable to be used to attack the ''weakest in society''.
Mr Blackwood said: ''Given this Government's scandalous attitude to
the homelessness problem, it is essential that we get this pernicious
clause amended to retain the responsibility upon the Minister to fund
services to the single homeless.''
His comments came ahead of a conference in Edinburgh today at which a
major campaign will be launched to protect services for single homeless
people. The fight is being spearheaded by trade unionists, local
authorities, and MPs who are united in outrage over a Government plan to
axe the resettlement unit at Bishopbriggs next year.
The unit is unique in Scotland and, in the past 30 years, has provided
accommodation for nearly 80 men each night who, in most circumstances,
would otherwise sleep rough.
Ms Angela Palmer, vice-president of the NUCPS, said: ''This decision
proves that this Government do not care about homeless people and are
quite prepared to condemn them to the scrapheap. We have written
promises from John Major -- all of which have been broken by this
heartless decision.''
Mr Michael Donohoe, housing convener of Strathkelvin District Council,
said his authority had drawn up proposals which would save the unit and
also millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.

Those who qualify for the 1994 scheme year include farmers whose

resulted in a reduction in numbers that year.
Other categories are:- a producer taking over land from a tenant who
has taken the quota with him; those entering an ''arable reversion''

first-time claimants under the 1994 scheme and producers taking over
land formerly used for suckler cow production but temporarily under

SCOTTISH farmers, whose incomes were reported on Tuesday to have
reached a ten-year high, have been warned not to be lulled into
believing that the good times will last for ever.
The cautionary advice came from Mr Sean Rickard, former chief
economist with the national Farmers' Union of England and Wales, and a
member of UK farm minister William Waldegrave's ''think-tank'' on the
future of agriculture following CAP reform.
''The reason that incomes are high today is because of the 20%
devaluation of the pound in 1992 along with zero inflation,'' he told a
standing-room only meeting organised by the North-East of Scotland Farm
Management Association.
''The great mistake you could make is to believe that all the
pressures involved in the build up to 1992 have been ameliorated,'' he
said. ''They have not gone away -- just been glossed over.''
His advice to farmers was to recognise that the pre-1992 pressures
could return in a few years and there was now no mechanism in the Common
Agricultural Policy system to raise prices or payments to farmers. ''If
inflation takes off in this country you are in trouble. If you intend to
farm and believe you have a future in farming you must use your profits
to make your businesses more efficient.
''Prepare yourself for a tougher future,'' he warned. ''If I am wrong,
you will do even better. If I am right, and you have not prepared
yourself -- goodbye.''
Looking at the future for the CAP Mr Rickard said that as a result of
the GATT agreement the European Union would be forced to reduce steadily
the amount of protection it gave to farming. Current protection was at
the rate of 40% above ruling market prices.
That same 40% tariff figure had applied to industry in general when
GATT began in 1947. The level of protection was now down to three per
cent and a similar scenario could apply to farming, he suggested.
''There is a new mood abroad which says that markets have to be more
open because that is the way other parts of the world will develop.
Agriculture will be subject to the same pressures that have fallen on
other sectors.'' There was, he said, a fundamental conflict looming,
with the agriculture industry increasingly dependent on public funds and
politicians beginning to pay more and more attention to what these funds
were spent on.
Further conflicts would arise with the eastwards expansion of the EU,
he forecast. Past experience suggested that no action would be taken to
deal with such pressures until crisis point was reached. The most
favoured solution at present appeared to be ''de-coupling'' which would
involve prices being determined by the market and farmers being
compensated for income loss by direct payments. The problem with that
solution was that it would put severe strains on the agriculture budget.
National Farmers' Union of Scotland president John Ross told the
meeting that he did not subscribe to Mr Rickards ''very gloomy picture''
on the survival of the CAP. He pointed out that forecasts could be
wrong.
''We were told that 15% set-aside would not do the job in controlling
cereal output but in fact we now discover that 12% will actually balance
supply and demand in Europe in the short term. We were given dire
warnings about a substantial increase in stickpiles of beef -- and the
reverse has been the case.''
The major difference between industry and farming was that food was an
absolute basic, he said. That was why in the last round of GATT
negotiations a nine-year peace clause had been accepted, allowing
Europeam agriculture to be subsidised provided it did not over produce.
The NFUS supported the principles of the CAP reform, taking into account
the needs of farmers, consumers and the countryside.

Ken Smith examines why the Chancellor is prepared to inflict some pain
on his natural allies, homeowners and industrialists, for the longer
term aim of low inflation.
THE collective groans could be heard across the housing estates of
Scotland last night as the news of the third interest rate rise in six
months sank in.
If the Conservatives appeal to the property-owning classes as their
natural supporters, they have a funny way of showing their appreciation,
was the obvious reaction.
Assuming the Chancellor is not involved in a particularly complicated
political suicide, why is he risking the wrath of potential voters by
pushing up interest rates?
First, it is not automatic that building society rates will follow the
half per cent increase in bank base rates announced yesterday. Building
societies say they are sensitive to the housing market being subdued,
and will resist a rise as long as possible. But even if there is an
increase in the next few weeks, mortgage payers appear to have selective
memory loss, forgetting they are still paying far less than even just a
few years ago.
The mortgage base rate, which is higher than the bank base rate, stood
at 8.1% at the end of 1994. Certainly it is higher than the 7.7% in
place for the most part of last year, but that figure is far lower than
people have experienced for years. As recently as the end of 1992 it was
in double figures, and in fact peaked at 15.4% in only April 1990 --
nearly double the current rate.
Putting it in financial terms, mortgage payers with the Nationwide
will be repaying #365.40 a month on a #50,000 mortgage from March -- due
to the last interest rate rise. But in March 1990, the monthly figure
was #565.07, so they are still some #200 a month better off, although
no-one will believe it.
It is not just houseowners who are complaining, however. The
Government's natural allies at the Confederation of British Industry say
they do not believe the rise is justified. But they will concede it is a
fine judgment. An increase in American interest rates would have put
pressure on the pound, and that may have forced the Chancellor's hand.
Although business leaders may disagree with the Chancellor's move,
they do not disagree with his motives of keeping inflation down.
Industrialists say they do not wish to return to inflationary days when
wage increases pushed up prices, which pushed up wages, and which
latterly made business uncompetitive with foreign rivals.
The CBI's own most recent industrial trends survey revealed that
manufacturers were anticipating an increase in unit costs, which would
have fed through from the wholesaler to the retailer, and increased
inflation. Pushing up interest rates will mean a restriction on money in
circulation, people will think twice about borrowing to buy goods, and
retailers, no matter how hard pushed they are, will have to think again
about putting up prices.
So it will be tough on houseowners, tough on retailers. Is it all
worth it then? Is inflation such a bogey?
Industrialists say that if inflation remains low, they can feel more
confident about investing in the long term as there will be more price
stability. More investment will mean more goods produced at competitive
prices, and benefits for the economy. It is following the German example
of low inflation which helped their industries so much in the eighties.
While too high an interest rate will force companies to cut back,
small half-per-cent rises should not stall investment plans.
As Lex Gold, director of the CBI Scotland, put it: ''What business
wants, above everything else, is stability. We don't want to return to
boom or bust.''
Scotland, it can be argued, will suffer less from interest rate rises
than elsewhere. Both corporate and personal debt is lower than the
average in England, so while the rate of economic growth may be slowed
by the latest interest rate rise, it should not be damaged.
The Scottish National Party will argue that the medicine we are all
having to swallow has more to do with inflationary pressures in the
South-east, and while taking medicine is bad enough, having to take it
when you're not the patient leaves an even more bitter taste in the
mouth.
Ultimately there will be some gainers, in that savers, particularly
pensioners living on their investments, will receive a slightly better
return for their money. But again, if mortgage-payers have forgotten the
days of high interest rates, savers have not. Any slight increase in
savings returns will not console them when they think of the heady days
of 15% returns.
So while the Chancellor believes he is acting for the good of the
country, he gets little thanks for it. Indeed the feel-good factor
everyone talks about as being missing, was largely dependent upon
inflation pushing up house prices and wages. Low inflation means little
or no wage rises.
While it may be judged good for the country, the increase will do
little for the Chancellor in the popularity stakes. But then, if he
wanted to be popular, he wouldn't have become a politician, would he?

NORTHERN Ireland's Unionists react to the word ''betrayal'' the way an
eager hound obeys the horn. The ears prick up, instinct takes over, and
the pack, oblivious to all but its quarry, bays for blood.
It has a lot to do with political traditions in the province. For
decades such transactions as there have been between the two communities
have turned on the belief that one side's gain must always be the
other's loss; what's good for Nationalists must, in all circumstances,
be bad for Unionists. Even peace is not a neutral condition.
That said, this week's crisis should have come as no surprise.
Unionist politicians have been signalling their growing
discontentment, as only they can, for months. They hold John Major's
spectral Commons majority by the delicate extremities, they do not trust
a word the Government says, and every ancestral voice warns them against
treachery and sell-out.
So we have Dr Paisley returned, vindicated and in triumph, to the
comforting warmth of the television studios when it seemed he was
thoroughly marginalised at last. So we have his allies muttering about
forcing a General Election (would Tony Blair really deal on those
terms?). And so we have -- a peculiar humiliation, this -- the Prime
Minister broadcasting a bathetic, grovelling plea for trust. This is
Honest John talking; who could doubt him? So far, so predictable. The
Unionists flex their muscles and the stakes are raised.
The spectre, in Loyalist minds, of cross-border powers, with Dublin
having any sort of say in the province, is banished for a while longer.
The party hacks of the Ulster Unionists and the Democratic Unionists,
who have most to lose from the birth of real politics in the north of
Ireland, can sleep easy in their beds.
But the sight of Unionists fighting their corner is nothing new. It is
what they were elected to do, after all, and London and Dublin knew they
had to cross this bridge sooner or later. What is more interesting --
and much more alarming -- is to look at the other participants in the
publicity coup. Since when, and for what reasons, did the once-august
Times of London have a ''selfish interest'' in screwing the Irish peace
process? By a simple process of elimination it's easy to conclude that
the paper got its leak from Loyalist sources, from the security
services, or from disgruntled civil servants (of the Crown, never
forget) whose Unionism is literal and sectarian.
The idea that it originated in Dublin is laughable. As Dr Garret
FitzGerald, former Irish Prime Minister and no friend of Sinn Fein, said
yesterday: ''This article was deliberately devised in order to
destabilise the Unionists who obviously were at a very sensitive moment
awaiting the publication of the document.''
If nothing else, Dr FitzGerald knows how these things work. A
27-year-old leader writer close to the wilder Unionist politicians, a
participant in a right-wing debating club of hacks, flakes and
professional patriots, and author, to boot, of a fervently pro-Loyalist
pamphlet, is handed (or so we are supposed to believe) the leaked draft
by his editor.
Young Winston is then expected to turn in a neutral account of its
contents at a time when the most important issue in British politics is
at its most delicate stage. If the Times is the innocent messenger of
truth in all this, I'm Ian Paisley's father confessor.
We haven't seen the Orange card played quite so ineptly in years.
Nevertheless, this is as good a time as any to ask just who the Times
thinks it represents. Hitherto, Ireland's Unionists have seemed isolated
and embattled figures. Now it becomes clear that one of the heavyweights
of the English establishment is prepared to come out on their side, not
through argument or debate, but by means of a calculated intervention in
the political process.
For columnists accustomed to accusations of bias, this is oddly
comforting, but we can draw wider conclusions. It is a fair bet, for
example, that the Times has its supporters both within and outwith the
Government. From this we can deduce that partisans of the cause of
Unionism -- of the cause of the United Kingdom -- are more determined
than we had guessed. John Major's recent, melodramatic remarks on
Scotland's future, never mind that of Ireland, take on a new complexion.
How far will these types really go to hold the Union together? What
hope does an enfeebled Prime Minister, already mired in the connected
issue of sovereignty within Europe, have of restraining them? In any
other context the exclusive published in the Times would have been
damned as dirty tricks, plain and simple. But with Ireland, Europe, and
Scottish home rule each touching raw Establishment nerves, we can expect
much more of the same.
Having rejected a plea from Major not to publish, what did the Times
hope to achieve? If the document exists, it is plainly relevant, but the
paper's handling of the story left little doubt of the sensation it
aimed to cause. To what end? The peace process wrecked, armed conflict
resumed, and the Union preserved? Speaking as a seasoned practitioner of
irresponsible journalism, this doesn't sound, at first hearing, like a
price worth paying.
Yet there has been no suggestion, thus far, that Major really intends
to expel Northern Ireland from the Union. In Scotland, however, we talk
freely and daily (if abstractly) of the chances of quitting the UK.
Some are for, some against, but we debate the matter as though it is
our own affair. That happy state cannot be taken for granted any longer.
Ireland first, Scotland next. Some play dirty in these patriot games.

FOUR junior doctors have lost their fight for higher pay rates for
working long overtime hours at two Scottish hospitals.
The doctors claimed their overtime rate, half their hourly rate, was
too low when the hard-pressed nature of their extra duties and lack of
sufficient rest were taken into account.
An Edinburgh industrial tribunal dismissed the complaints under the
Wages Act against Fife and Forth Valley Health Boards.
The disputes arose following the Government's introduction of the
''New Deal'' for junior doctors to reduce their long hours. A new system
of 50% pay for on-call hours, 70% for working a partial shift, and 100%
for working a full shift, was introduced.
In the Edinburgh case, Dr Kerry Matthewson from Edinburgh and Dr
Stuart Mair from Kirkcaldy told the tribunal they were on short-term
contracts as senior house officers in obstetrics and gynaecology with
Fife Health Board.
Dr Matthewson said he had a heavy workload covering clinics, wards,
admissions and deliveries and seldom got eight hours rest in 32 hours of
duty. He could be up all night on call.
Dr Mair's experience was similar but both were paid the lowest rate of
overtime. He claimed it should have been a higher category, 70% of their
normal pay, because of the intensity of the work.
The tribunal heard the situation was now under review by the Kirkcaldy
Acute NHS Trust: the maximum on-call hours had been reduced from 83 to
72 in hard-pressed posts, but the pay rate was the same.
Dr Meryl Peat from Edinburgh and Dr Ruth Crowe from Stenhousemuir, had
similar experiences in their year-long appointments in geriatrics and
general medicine at Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary.
The tribunal, however, did not find the health boards acted
unreasonably in classifying the senior house officer posts as on-call
rota posts in a fluctuating and developing situation, and found the
posts properly assessed and renumerated .
The British Medical Association, which supported the junior doctors,
said it would likely appeal and would be pressing ahead with other cases
''with confidence''. Junior doctors are involved in a similar case at an
industrial tribunal in Glasgow against the Royal Alexandra Hospital
Trust in Paisley. Their hearing continues in June.

I would suggest that as the only quality newspaper representing the
West of Scotland you owe the duty of accuracy to your Glasgow
readership, including the 44,000 or so who spend every second Saturday
supporting the efforts of Rangers FC.
On this basis it was insulting to the memory of Messrs Lafferty,
McCallum, Dunbar, Tutty, Kyle, Kivlichan, McGhie, Mainds, Murray, Brown,
Jackson, Donnachie, Blyth, Kitchenbrand, and O'Neill to suggest that
John Spencer was the first Catholic footballer to be signed by Rangers
(January 28).
Worse was to follow in the suggestion that Spencer's career at Ibrox
was blighted by his religion: what of the #4m paid for Messrs Johnston
and Boli, not to mention Kuznetsov and Mikhailichenko. Still, don't let
the facts get in the way of a good stereotype.

With the recent successful campaign to save Stobhill and the launch of
the current one to save Lenzie Hospital, the silence is deafening for
support for Lennox Castle. Which politician is speaking up for residents
there?
For most of the residents Lennox Castle is their home, safe, secure,
and warm, but not for much longer the way things are going.
A once-beautiful estate and ideal, spacious site for the mentally
handicapped is rapidly running down through lack of maintenance and
neglect despite millions of pounds poured in a few years ago. Behind the
facelift lies decay and apathy. The once-splendid grounds are
disgraceful and a favourite dump for fly-tippers.
This rape of a once-fine hospital is being carried out under the
banner of Community Care, but have the residents any say before being
discharged into the community? Split up from their friends and the
social activities of Lennox Castle, for many it is a lonely, hostile
world out there.
Is there anyone out there with political muscle who will take up the
cudgels for Lennox Castle and its residents?

Mr Marsh from Glasgow for People claims the support of local MPs,
councillors, residents, and business people in criticising the choice of
station locations for the Strathclyde CrossRail scheme (January 18).
This is hardly surprising if he has described the scheme to them in the
inaccurate terms used in your columns.
He states that Glasgow Cross station will be ''isolated, unattractive,
and comprise two platforms plus bus shelters''. In fact the station will
be located on Saltmarket, adjacent to Glasgow Cross, and will be
designed to complement and, where possible, utilise existing buildings.
The platforms will be well lit and will indeed provide shelter for
passengers.
He criticises the fact that the station will not be capable of being
conveniently linked to a possible future low-level station on the Argyle
Line. In fact the location chosen facilitates any such interchange
should it be built in the future as easily as any other location.
He criticises the proposed travelator link from Glasgow Cross station
to Argyle Street station and the St Enoch Centre. The need for this will
be assessed as the scheme progresses in the context of local area
development but I would imagine that if a covered travelator walkway
were provided, many people, especially the elderly, would welcome it.
Finally he criticises the decision to relocate High Street station
into the ''remote, unattractive wastelands'' of a goods yard. In fact
the station entrance to High Street will remain where it is, although
the platforms will be moved back 80 metres to accommodate the CrossRail
junction. The short connecting path will be well lit and will be much
easier to use for many less mobile passengers than the existing stairs.
His preferred option west of High Street would cost many millions of
pounds more to construct and would involve closing the existing Airdrie
line for many months with extensive passenger disruption.
Glasgow for People acknowledges the benefit of the CrossRail scheme to
the people of Glasgow and Strathclyde in further enhancing the extensive
local network supported by Strathclyde Regional Council. It is
unfortunate that misleading information has been used to denigrate the
council's proposals.

Could the sentiment, ''Ou est Cantona?'', (Ken Smith's Diary, January
27) be applied to James Traynor in relation to the successful Celtic
share issue?
James Traynor has been one of the main critics of Fergus McCann's
business plan, particularly his comments in the aftermath of the
Coca-Cola Cup final. He now seems to have no comment to make. Is this
because, like most sports writers, he is still chewing on his own words?

Your editorial, Degrees of Guilt, relating as it does to the fiftieth
anniversary of both the bombing of Dresden and the liberation of the
concentration camp at Auschwitz, warrants further comment (January 27).
The bombs fell on Dresden as part of Britain's response in a war that
Germany invited through a programme of ruthless military expansion in
which the invasion of Poland was ''the last straw''.
Auschwitz operated in wartime but the unspeakable campaign against the
Jews cannot be dignified by calling it part of the war. (Among those
destroyed were German Jews who had fought for Germany.) The campaign
against Jews which led to the Final Solution had begun long before the
war and, unthinkable though it may seem, would undoubtedly have
continued after the war if the Allies had been defeated.
The statement that, ''Of the Holocaust, of which Auschwitz is the main
symbol, little new can be said'', fills me with foreboding because what
has been said has made such little difference (witness Bosnia, Rwanda,
and Chechnya).
That is why what is known has to be studied, remembered, and taught.
Dresden is now safe but anti-Semitism has signed no armistice. It is
re-emerging, for instance, in Germany and France. In Britain,
well-funded glossy magazines circulate widely which exist to perpetuate
Nazi hate while denying the Holocaust.

The Herald has done better than most other papers in drawing our
attention to Robin Cook's welcome revelation that he has ''reversed his
earlier opposition to Blair's strategy'' of modernising the Labour
Party.
But I think Mr Cook must go further than he has done in his article
(January 26).
I welcome his statement: ''The foundation of Labour's ideology should
rest not on state ownership but on social solidarity.'' But I would have
much preferred to see the dropping of the Marxism-inspired name
''Labour'' and its replacement with a sign that Mr Cook now proposes to
be ''radical'' enough to become a classless democrat and perhaps inspire
merging with the Liberals.
As a believer in the urgency and absolute necessity of being
''radical'' enough to embrace a vision of ultimate global democratic
integration may I advise members of both the main opposition parties to
form a ''common ground'' (eg, social solidarity) Opposition to the
Anglo-British Tories so that, as in the US, we can have a bipartisan
approach to politics instead of a tripartisan approach.
Let nobody think or suppose that it is not the tri-party or
multi-party kind of politics in Britain that has produced the long
domination by the Tories. There can be no doubt that a split opposition
is a gift to the dinosaurish Conservatives who are now pandering to the
mega-wealthy by raising interest rates and restricting Government
spending on projects which could cut the dole queues dramatically if the
highest rates of income tax, only, were raised.
If members of the two main British parties can be brought to see the
need for a single British political Opposition, firmly founded on
''social solidarity'' (ie, democratic unionism) we can defeat Mr Major
and his band of ''anti-integration in the EU'' supporters.

Your coverage of the latest mountain accident (in Torridon) is
welcome, concentrating as it does on how increased information about
snow and avalanche conditions could have prevented it rather than
suggesting that the only solution is for people to stay off the hill.
If more resources are needed for the Scottish Avalanche Information
Service, then this is even more so for other areas of mountain safety.
In 1993, for example, 11 people died from slips and falls while
hillwalking in winter conditions compared with two in avalanches. Too
many people are still going to the hill in winter either without
appropriate equipment or without knowing how to use it. Yet there is no
government money allocated directly to deal with this problem.
Last year, at a seminar organised by the Scottish Mountain Safety
Group, Sir Hector Munro hinted that more government money might be made
available to try to reduce accidents in the mountains. The
Mountaineering Council of Scotland has been working on a job remit for a
Scottish Mountain Safety Officer, the aim of which would be to tackle
other causes of accidents and co-ordinate the efforts of existing
bodies, only to be told recently that no new money appears to be
available from the Scottish Office.
Surely, given the concern about mountain accidents, it is time to fund
other safety initiatives. Initiatives such as a Mountain Safety Officer
would cost even less than the Scottish Avalanche Information Service and
would have the potential to save more lives.

I am sorry, but that's it! The absolute limit!
The straw that has broken this camel's back is the revelation that,
according to Europe, Britain must now compensate deliberate criminals,
poll tax dodgers, to the tune of #20,000 each. As this compensation
comes from the tax-payers' pockets -- yours and mine -- I am, I believe
justifiably, very angry.
We have been conned over the Europe question. No mention has been made
at past elections of the federalist route being taken and now we are
being denied the chance to have our say. This and previous
administrations have pooh-poohed complaints about the ever-increasing
restrictions being foisted on us by Europe.
Now enough is enough. It must be made clear to Messrs Major, Blair,
and Ashdown that most of us do not want any closer ties with Europe and,
if that cannot be, the tightening knot (noose?) must be cut.

THE Nolan Committee proceeds apace with its investigation of sleaze
and jobs for the retired Tory Cabinet boys. At yesterday's hearing it
was suggested a committee be set up to monitor such appointments.
Who would be on this committee? it was asked. Lord Thomson of
Monifieth -- former Labour Cabinet Minister, European Commissioner, and
caption writer for the Beano -- had a beezer of an idea. Why not his pal
and fellow committee member, that fine, upstanding chap Lord Nolan?

WE have to report an outbreak of humour on the part of Crawford
Beveridge, chief executive of Scottish Enterprise. During an address at
the University of Paisley, where he is visiting prof, he related how a
determined inventor laid siege to the Bothwell Street offices of the
enterprise body.
Encamped in the foyer, he was adamant that he had to speak to a senior
director. The junior person given the task of dealing with the situation
was finally able to elicit the nature of his request.
The inventor had perfected a time machine and all he needed was some
enterprise funding. The message was relayed upstairs and the answer came
back from the director that he didn't have time to see the inventor that
day. But if the inventor could come back last week, the director would
have time to see him.

YOUR average local pub could be an interesting place as we celebrate
the 50th anniversary of VE-Day later this year.
To help recapture the flavour of the great day, the Brewers and
Licensed Retailers Association is issuing a special kit to pubs. It
contains a Union Flag to hang out, portraits of the old king and queen
for the wall, and a Glenn Miller tape for suitable background music.
Also in the kit are sundry period hats, including an air raid warden's
tin helmet. The piece de resistance is an inflatable Spitfire airplane.
Unfortunately there are no inflatable Fokkers to make it more
interesting in an aerial combat sense.
Not even Fokkers in Messerschmitts. That joke, we believe, predates
VE-Day.
Nasty blow
ITV NETWORK sport has invested a substantial amount of money into the
career of a boxer called Prince Naseem Hamed. He has been chosen as the
successor to Chris Eubank in ITV's efforts to gain ratings for their
fight programme.
Although the chap is from Sheffield, Scotland was chosen as the venue
for his last fight, in the SECC in Glasgow. His next fight is scheduled
for Livingston in March.
The Scottish sporting press has given Naseem a reasonably warm
welcome. One notable exception was Gerry McNee in his Sunday Mail column
who wrote: ''Having nothing better to do, I watched the boxing mis-match
involving Naseem whatshisname on TV. Looking at the goings-on in and out
of the ring, I couldn't help but think that had I been daft enough to
attend, I would have wanted to rush home and take a very long, cleansing
shower . . .''
This criticism so incensed one ITV sport high heid yin that he
telephoned Scottish TV to ask just who is this guy McNee. ''Scottish
TV's sports editor, actually,'' was the embarrassed reply.

HEALTH Secretary Virginia Bottomley has given a personal pledge to the
father of a young doctor, whose family claim he was worked to death,
that the lives of junior doctors will be improved.
Mrs Bottomley, whose daughter is a junior doctor at London's St
Thomas's Hospital, has spoken of her personal sorrow over the death of
Dr Alan Massie, 26, who collapsed and died at Warrington General
Hospital after working an 86-hour week in January last year.
In a four-page letter to his father, George, of Macclesfield,
Cheshire, Mrs Bottomley set out in detail her plans to cut doctors'
hours.
''I want to reassure you that our determination to improve the working
lives of junior doctors is far more than just a paper commitment. I
accepted in 1990 that their workload was becoming increasingly intense
and we took action to tackle the problem.''
But Mrs Bottomley said it was not realistic to change the working
patterns of more than 25,000 junior doctors in England alone in a matter
of weeks or months.
The New Deal launched in 1991 was a practical programme of action to
tackle the problem long term. She said the 83-hour ceiling of hours
imposed on all contracts at that stage was still too high to be a
lasting solution.
The next step was a lower ceiling for hard-pressed posts where out of
hours calls were heaviest. ''We are now aiming to cap contracted hours
in those posts at 72 a week and within that limit to see that no junior
doctor works on average for more than 56 hours a week,'' she said.
Mr Massie wrote to Mrs Bottomley after the inquest on his son which
ruled he died of ''sudden adult death syndrome'' -- a natural cause.

SHADOW Health Secretary Margaret Beckett yesterday condemned the
crisis over recruitment of junior doctors for accident and emergency
departments.
Shortages throughout the UK had prompted desperate measures by NHS
trusts and managers to maintain a service, she said. Peterborough
Hospitals NHS Trust, as revealed by The Herald, had offered #50 an hour
to doctors to provide cover.
Peterborough served constituents both of Transport Secretary and
former Health Minister Dr Brian Mawhinney and of the Prime Minister, she
added.
Mrs Beckett said the incident highlighted the Government's failure to
keep its promise to provide adequate provision to meet the New Deal for
reducing junior doctors' hours.
''This is further proof of the problems in Virginia Bottomley's NHS,''
she said. ''It is absolutely appalling she is allowing vital casualty
services to reach such a stage.''
Dr Brian Potter, Scottish secretary of the British Medical
Association, said: ''It is a complex problem but it does throw into
focus the Government's health reforms.
''It is one of the direct effects of the reforms where you have got
hospitals competing against hospitals for a limited supply of labour. It
also forces them into having to make unacceptable decisions, because if
you put more money into this area you have got to take it from somewhere
else.''
The New Deal has resulted in a substantial rise in house officer posts
to cope with the reduction in working hours. However, it takes five
years to train a doctor. There has been no corresponding increase in
numbers graduating from medical schools and those coming out have been
more selective in the posts they choose.
Dr Keith Little, accident and emergency consultant at Edinburgh Royal
Infirmary, said the issue had been taken up by the British Association
for Accident and Emergency Medicine.
''It may be a failure on the Government's part to understand the
consequences of a lot of different factors coming together. I do not
know of any instant solution at all,'' he said.
Dr Little said accident and emergency departments in the UK absorbed
2800 junior staff every year, the highest of any speciality.
''We are feeling the brunt of the New Deal and a number of other
factors at the same time, but this will impact on other specialties,''
he added.
Scottish Health Minister, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, said: ''It is
vitally important there is proper cover across Scotland and not just in
a few centres, however excellent they may be.
''There is no issue of funding here. If junior doctors with the
appropriate qualifications apply for the posts, they can be employed
immediately.''
Lord Fraser said the problem had been caused by changes in career
patterns and requirements from the Royal Colleges. ''I am meeting with
senior medical advisers to discuss the issue which is affecting the
whole of the UK,'' he added.
Neither Dr Mawhinney nor the Prime Minister's office could offer any
comment yesterday.
Mr Bryan Harty, operations director for the Peterborough NHS Trust,
said the enhanced pay, five times the usual #10 an hour rate, had
attracted interest.
''We have had a very positive response from local GPs because of their
desire to keep the accident and emergency unit open 24 hours a day,
seven days a week. The rotas for February and March are now filled,'' he
added.

THE case for raising British interest rates again was evenly balanced
but the American decision to nudge theirs upwards was probably decisive
in forcing the hands of the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of
England. The worsening inflationary pressures identifiable in the
economy were balanced by other evidence which might have supported
waiting for another month, but the pre-emptive strategy adopted by the
Governor has prevailed and a third modest increase in less than six
months has come into action. Various bodies have protested: they are all
correct in claiming that the additional burden imposed is damaging but
the Government's defence is unassailable if one assumes that resurgent
inflation would be more damaging still, and that action before rather
than after a fresh surge is the better response. The Liberal Democrat
view that a succession of increases does not amount to a strategy is
mistaken -- it is akin to pumping on the brakes of a car so as to avoid
an abrupt halt or a skid -- but the strategy itself could be mistaken,
though it does allow the reverse process to be implemented should later
trends confound the pessimism to which Mr George is addicted.
The economy remains growing at around 4% per annum, a high rate
historically and one certainly above the post-war trend line. The
recovery which that figure exposes is real enough (and is confirmed by
the employment statistics), but the benefits are mostly going into areas
which are not obvious to popular opinion and seldom welcome where they
are. In that fact lies much of the Government's political difficulties
in the opinion polls. The recovery is fuelled by a very good export
performance but the reverse of that coin is that it is not fuelled by
that domestic demand which would help to make spenders feel better. The
jobs being created do not make enough people feel better either, since
they have to be weighed against the mood of insecurity which affects the
even larger numbers who worry about the permanency of their own jobs.
Increased mortgage charges are resented by all who have to pay them: the
amounts are far more than suggested by half-percentage point increases
and are increased by the relentless ratcheting down of the tax
concession embodied in Miras (mortgage interest rate relief). Such
changes are desirable in that we need to switch national savings away
from house purchase, but try telling that to those struggling to meet
mortgage payments. They feel hard pressed -- no wonder their lenders are
anxious to postpone passing the new rates on, at least for a bit.
The political consequence of all this is bad news for the Government.
It is not the stuff of electoral success, and as more tax rises will
pump out of the pipeline in April, it would be a brave man who would
forecast any early significant change in the political climate.
Ministers will say that they are being virtuous, putting country above
party, and so on. An electorate made cynical by disappointment (and
well-deployed Opposition skills) will not be convinced, and not least
because the virtue was imposed by our ejection from the ERM, and
therefore contrary to all the Government's original hopes. Politicians
have to work with what they have, but Ministers may be forgiven if they
suspect that popular opinion is not as hostile to inflation as they, and
their advisers, are. Will Ministers panic and settle for ''a little''
inflation? All their predecessors have done so. It may be a matter of
time but, for the moment, virtue prevails, at considerable political
cost.

IT'S the not knowing that aches more than anything. Are they alive?
Injured? Did they die with dignity? Were there moments of heroism,
comfort, reassurance from another, fear?
The family of Christopher Mannion can understand precisely the torment
that Lesley Bilinda has gone through.
The 43-year-old British monk disappeared shortly after arriving in
Rwanda to try and secure the release of a kidnapped Tutsi colleague. His
body has never been found, but his elderly parents in Darlington were
told that he had been killed and most probably buried somewhere near the
shell of his burnt-out car.
I was one of the last people to see him. We met in June as he crossed
the border into Rwanda, driving in convoy past the militia roadblocks to
the Catholic mission in Butare.
In the relative safety of the mission grounds, we sat on a windowsill
and chatted about Glasgow, where he had worked with his order, the
Marist Brothers, and about the task ahead of him. He was quiet and pale
and admitted to being a little nervous. His colleague had been held by
the militia for some time and they had managed to persuade the group
holding him to discuss his release.
''They know someone is coming for him but they don't know who or
when,'' he said. ''I don't know how long it's going to take me to get
him out.'' We said our goodbyes over dinner and left before he did the
following morning.
Not long after that he disappeared. He managed to free his colleague,
then heard about two others and negotiated their freedom as well.
Somewhere, on one of the narrow Rwandan roadways his car apparently was
hijacked. The body of his colleague, Joseph Rushigayiki, was found in
the vehicle but there was no sign of Chris.
Like Charles Bilinda, the rumours about his disappearance grew and
shrank as the weeks passed. Eventually, at the end of August, the new
prime minister, Faustin Twagiramungu, sent a fax to his order in Rome
telling them that he could confirm that Chris had been killed. It's
thought he was maybe the victim of a random mugging.
Speaking yesterday, a family friend said that his relatives are still
not satisfied that they have heard the full story, and are still
unsettled by that lingering doubt that maybe somewhere he is being held
captive.
''I think mentally they have said, yes, he's dead, but there is still
that question mark and it will remain there.''

Heavy staff cuts at Inland Revenue offices could mean that in future
taxpayers will have to make their own assessments, with strict deadlines
and heavy penalties for those caught trying to beat the system. Just how
difficult will DIY taxation be, and with fewer taxmen will the cheats be
caught?
Margaret Vaughan reports.
YOU may not know this yet -- you may not want to know this -- but one
day you could regret the passing of your tax inspector. They may not be
your favourite people. They may even be the sad objects of skilled
avoidance techniques, practised especially at parties. But soon you may
miss them. You may, but then again you might be too busy wrestling with
tax tables, mortgage interest relief, married couples allowance, too
anxious about filling in the form and avoiding a hefty fine, to worry
about it.
The confirmation yesterday that 6000 jobs will be axed at the Inland
Revenue over the next three years with another 6000 to be shed by the
turn of the century is further evidence of the move to do-it-yourself
taxation, called self-assessment. The onus will shift to taxpayers
working out their own bill with strict deadlines to pay.
Will do-it-yourself taxation be a dodger's charter? Only to the extent
that, like fare dodging on a bus, the risk of the inspector jumping
aboard to check your ticket is an ever-present reality, according to the
Inland Revenue.
Others, notably the unions and Opposition politicians, argue that
#4.7billion was raked in last year by inspectors pursuing those who
evaded tax, intentionally or by mistake. John McFall, a Labour front
bencher, claimed yesterday that the job losses could lead to an extra 9p
on basic income rates through tax non-compliance.
Mr McFall quoted the 1994 Report of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's
Inland Revenue, presented to Parliament last October, which said that
the yield from action against non-compliance was #4.7b. That was the
equivalent to 2.5p in the basic rate of income tax.
The figure did not take into account the indirect yield, including the
''corrective'' effect on taxpayers on cases investigated by inspectors,
which was estimated to be a further #4.5b over five years, or the
deterrent effect of tax investigation which was said to be
unquantifiable.
Professor Alex McDougall, of Edinburgh University, a practising
accountant, believes the changes will mean more emphasis on catching tax
dodgers. He said self-assessment for companies, called Pay and File, was
already in operation.
Other factors given for the job cuts include the move to electronic
lodgment for companies, where tax practitioners will send everything to
the Inland Revenue through computer lines.
''I've no doubt these changes are behind the job losses, along with
the wish to reduce public spending,'' said Professor McDougall. He
believes most of the tax jobs to be lost will be in the clerical grades
with the emphasis switching to more sophisticated tax-raising
approaches: ''This should mean more skilled people deployed to search
for evaders.''
There are 29 million taxpayers in the UK. Of these, 20 million pay tax
through their employers in the PAYE scheme and usually will be sent a
tax return only every four or five years.
The other nine million have to fill in a return every year, because
they are self-employed or have other sources of income on top of PAYE,
perhaps investment income or capital gains.
From the end of next year, they will not only have to fill in the form
but work out what they are due in allowances, and tot up their own tax.
There will be spot checks made on tax returns and heavy penalties for
those trying to beat the system.
Alan Barr, a tax specialist who heads the Legal Practice Unit at
Edinburgh University's law faculty, says self-assessment may in the long
term justify the reduction in jobs. But, he fears, in the short to
medium term, it will mean more rather than less work in the tax offices:
''There will, inevitably, have to be a big checking exercise and big
educational exercises to explain to people how to work out their own
tax.''
The scheme is being phased in, starting in the tax year 1996/97 and
should be fully in effect the following year.
Mr Barr believes there is scope for evasion under the do-it-yourself
scheme: ''It is possible, although self-assessment will be subject to
stringent checks. The revenue will have less work to do in the sense of
shifting assessments, so in theory they should have more time to do more
in catching evaders.''
Estimates of how much tax is already lost through evasion vary.
Professor Brian Hogwood of Strathclyde University says that while #57b
was paid in income tax in 1993, another 10% was reckoned to be lost
through tax dodges.
Fiddling is the illegal way. The legal way is called tax avoidance and
involves paying professional advisers to find loopholes and ways of not
paying tax, such as setting up offshore companies and trusts.
Then there is the ''hidden economy'', estimated to be worth between
#41b and #54b a year. That involves such things as tradesmen doing
homers, working for an employer by day and painting your living room by
night. Some liberal economists claim the hidden economy oils the wheels
of the economy as a whole. An article in an edition of the Inland
Revenue magazine ReveNews last year hinted that Ministers have decided
to turn a blind eye to moonlighting.
But an opinion poll carried out for the Inland Revenue showed that
nine out of 10 taxpayers wanted more action to ensure people paid their
fair share of tax.
Alan Barr believes the move to shift the burden of tax compliance on
to the taxpayer will mean many more people needing help to sort out
their tax affairs. In America street-corner booths tout for business by
offering an instant service to fill in your tax return form.
He says the Government's stated aim of simplifying the tax system, by
moving away from complex allowances to a flat tax rate, simply has not
happened. The past three finance Acts have introduced enormously complex
changes. Last year's Budget, derided as boring, will, he says, actually
introduce another tranche of intricacies into the tax system.
He believes the move to self-assessment will bring even greater
confusion: ''It will make it more worrying and difficult for a lot of
people. It may mean that they are more likely to get it wrong, and will
end up needing expensive help to get it right.''
Much like getting on to a bus with no conductor, where you are
expected to have the right change, you risk losing out if you don't know
the fare. Maybe the redundant species of bus conductor and the vanishing
breed of tax collectors have more in common, after all, than a simple
imperative to extract money from you.
'The revenue will have less work to do, so they should have more time
to catch evaders'

MR MAJOR, still struggling to keep the Northern Ireland peace process
afloat, had to take time off to defend the half-per-cent interest rate
rise of more immediate concern to most voters in Great Britain,
The Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, had earlier done the same in his
best cheeky-chappie manner, saying that the average Briton would still
be a fiver a week better off this year and warning that Labour
insouciance on inflation would throw away the economic recovery.
Labour maintains a healthy scepticism about the welfare or indeed the
existence of this recovery, which appears to be shared by most of the
electors.
Messrs Blair and Brown performed their home owners' friend routine
with which they are increasingly comfortable while not actually saying
the rise was wrong or unnecessary.
There was some intriguing European fencing on the Tory back benches
which took the form of questions to Ministers.
Mrs Anne Winterton asked Mr Clarke to declare that a single currency
was as much anathema to him as to her.
Mr Clarke, probably the keenest single currrency man in the Cabinet,
meekly referred her to an interesting speech by his morning coffee
companion Mr Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England.
The accepted view that Euro scepticism is in the ascendant was
confirmed when Mr Alan Duncan outlined a nightmare scenario in which
some EU members set up a single currency because their economic
performances had suitably converged only for them to diverge with
catastrophic results once the wretched system had been set up.
In Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, he had a Treasury Minister happy to agree
but the Prime Minister was very right to be cautious about the whole
thing.
Some Europhiles sought to make their case to Mr Major himself but with
indifferent success.
Mr James Couchman asked if EU membership was not a very good thing, Mr
Major said it was but swiftly added that the conditions of membership
were vital. The advantage would be lost if the conditions were to
include involvement in the Social Chapter, a quote that might be worth
filing away in case some inventive member of the Commission staff finds
a way of imposing it on us.
Sir Michael Marshall suggested the time was ripe for the Commons to
have a great debate on Europe. No doubt he was thinking of the majority
of MPs who are still keen or fairly keen on the EU.
Mr Major, doubtless thinking of Mrs Teresa Gorman at Sir Edward
Heath's throat -- just one of a number of contests he could envisage --
must have shuddered.
But he bravely said it would take too long to debate Labour's
divisions on the subject.
He had earlier accused Mr Blair of ''cheek'' on interest rates and now
paid him back with interest.
He was right, of course, but apart from Mr Peter Shore, Mr Austin
Mitchell and the perpetual youthful Mr Dennis Skinner, most of Labour's
Euro sceptics are keeping their heads below the parapet thankful that
their Tory comrades-in-arms are doing such a good job.
Mrs Gorman, indeed, made Mr Major laugh as she hoped the news that the
Treasury building is to be partially privatised had nothing to do with
Mr Jacques Santer's call for ''the abolition of our national currency.''
Mr John Home-Robertson (East Lothian -- Lab.) said angrily that he and
others were getting fed up with the continuous refrain ''Ulster says
No'' being parroted by some Unionists.
Mr Major, whose need for the Unionists on Ireland and for tricky
Commons votes is extreme, said he did not doubt the sincerity of all of
them in seeking a way to permanently end the horrors their Province has
experienced for the past 25 years.
There is no need for anyone to doubt it. In Ireland and Europe, this
Parliament confronts issues on which, certainly, there is political
manoeuvring aplenty, but what ultimately matters is that real passionate
conviction which day to day politics often only simulates.
Despite the interest rate rise, the Chancellor still found something
to smile

One voice has been conspicuous by its absence in Westminster. Sir
Nicholas Fairbairn is ill. But his provocative nature is as robust as
ever, ROBBIE DINWOODIE discovers
I have not been sent
to Parliament to
wink just because
John Major says wink
Benn is extremely well
read but deluded -- like
Tam Dalyell. I adore
Tam, but he's dotty
Scottish independence
in Europe would be
disastrous . . .
a frightful fantasy
At a time of unprecendented turmoil at Westminster, when his colourful
and strident voice would surely have been one of the most contentious,
Sir Nicholas Fairbairn QC has been forced by ill health to languish in
his lair at Fordell Castle in Fife. But while he has already announced
his retirement from parliamentary politics at the next General Election,
the unconventional Tory MP for Perth and Kinross has not -- as this
exclusive interview proves -- switched off his passion for controversy.
ON EUROPE
* IN STYLE and posture Fairbairn is of a different time. Defying
''political correctness'' to the last degree, capable of statements that
many would take as proof of outrageous bigotry, he refuses to conform to
norms that represent for him a dead, grey hand on individual conviction.
Talking at Fordell Castle, he is characteristically unrepentant. ''If
I had kept my nose clean and brushed my hair and wiped my bottom and
sucked up I would I no doubt have got a lot further in politics,'' he
says, ''but since the price of getting further would have been alien to
my nature, I don't regret that.''
He has made brilliant, if erratic, contributions to three different
careers since, as an adolescent, he used a catapult to smash windows of
a local Co-op bakery in protest at Labour's post-war election victory.
For that he was ''profoundly beaten'' but he has never learned a lesson.
As an advocate, MP and Government law officer, he has rarely been out of
the public eye.
A celebrated bon vivant only just past his sixty-first birthday, he is
gravely ill but without regrets, blasting at colourless conformity, and
making clear that had he been able to attend Westminster he would have
fought the Government on European policy.
''Certainly! I would not regard it as defying the leadership. I would
be doing what I was elected to Parliament to do, to exercise my judgment
if I consider something to be an unprincipled folly. I have not been
sent there to wink just because John Major says wink.
''I you had told any British subjects 20 years ago that they would
lose their currency, their flag, their foreign policy, and control over
their own army, they would have said you were insane. Anyone who says
that now is a rebel.
''Europe is a fantasy of illusion for do-gooder imaginists like Hurd
-- as if we will all speak one language, have the same thoughts. Tell
that to Russia. I have been to Pakistan and India and this idea that we
all love one another is a nonsense. There wouldn't be divorce courts if
humans were like that.
''It's a fatuous concept to have some kind of United States of Europe.
It's totally misconceived. Europe is a complex, historically diverse,
war-ridden, peace-ridden, rival-ridden, friend-ridden, battle-worn
place. You only have to look at the First and Second World Wars.''
ON OTHERS
* SIR NICKY'S distaste for slavish following of the party line led him
into an astonishing attack on the candidate selected to succeed him,
London-based merchant banker John Godfrey.
''When I stood for Kinross and West Perthshire there seemed to be
about 600 candidates and I thought I would come 599th but I won it. I
held it for 22 years and will now leave it in the strange hands of what
is to come.''
Meaning your successor as candidate? Can John Godfrey retain the seat?
''Not a chance! He is a clone. I don't think he knows anything about
about Perthshire or Scotland.
''I have had innumerable telephone calls and letters from local Tory
supporters who agree that he is totally irrelevant. I wrote to the
chairman yesterday and said, it's nothing to do with me now because I'm
offski, but I think you should know that the constituents fear he will
be an absentee -- and unelectable.
''It might not matter to Perth and Kinross whether he is electable or
not, but it might just matter as to who forms the next Government.''
This talk is reminiscent of his outburst last year when he announced he
would not be standing again, and condemned the faceless lobby fodder
which increasingly permeated the Westminster scene.
''That's the trouble, Tory Central Office in Scotland and in England
have been ordered to have only clones. What did John Major call them,
the classless society? It's his term, not mine. The classless society is
saying this is nobody and that is nobody.
''When I first went into Westminster we had dukes and dustmen,
coal-miners and lecturers. I don't care if someone is a duke or a
dustman. He is a person. I am afraid on both sides of the House people
are now selected for their non-existence. There are identical clones on
both sides. I think it's a very dangerous trend. I mean, Blair is such a
humbug.''
Is there no-one he rates as better than cloned party-fodder? ''I'm
very fond of Gordon Brown. I think he is astute and wise. And Dear Old
Benn, there's a real character, whether you agree or disagree with him.
He's got a bloody good mind, is extremely well read and knows about the
world, but completely deluded -- like Tam Dalyell. I adore Tam, but he's
dotty.''
So there are fewer and fewer MPs with an individualist streak,
prepared to stand by their convictions, show a character of their own?
Will the few who remain be driven out by the next century? ''I would
have that fear. It isn't just in politics.
''I am afraid it's a dangerous trend, not just at Westminster but in
many manifestations of human life. Look at judges and advocates and
those sort of people. They are just squashed into identicality, which I
find infuriating.
''Look at the great people who use to strut the world's stage,
Cockburn, or Churchill or Curzon. Take Curzon. He walked all over China
and India, was Governor General of India, came home and became Foreign
Secretary, bloody nearly Prime Minister. How do you fit all that into
one life?
''Churchill was the same. I look at the likes of Churchill and Curzon
and say, 'Jesus, how did they do all that?' Who is going to write a book
in the present House of Commons? They have never been to half the world,
these people. I mean, Malcolm Rifkind has actually been to Bosnia. How
decent of him!
Fairbairn has no regrets about his time at Westminster: ''Parliament I
have found absolutely fascinating as an object of human scrutiny. My
father was a psychoanalyst, so I suppose I was brought up to judge
people and dissect them. That's politics. Being a law officer in the
Government I found very fulfilling, even if it meant you had to deal
with arse-licking civil servants and their despicable sycophancy.''
But his legal career, during which he defended people facing the death
sentence 17 times and never lost one, is seen as his best of times. ''I
loved the law. It was a great challenge to do for somebody what they
can't do for themselves, and to argue your way out of the pit. Even in
divorce courts you have the responsibility of saving them from what to
them is a massive trauma. In the courts there was always to be found a
bit of humanity.
''In law, I suppose the low points were losing when I thought I should
have won. I never regretted winning when I should have lost. But losing
when I should have won got to me -- Meehan was a very good example. I
was was desperately upset when I didn't get him off.''
ON DEVOLUTION
* THE HOSTILITY of Sir Nicky to devolution in any form is tangible.
''A Scottish assembly is dotty. It means another effing Government,
another million bloody civil servants and more hangers-on. Now these
people say there should be some for England, for Rutland, for North
Wales, for South Derbyshire. Sheer madness.
''Scottish Independence in Europe would be absolutely disastrous. It
would vastly increase our expenses and our civil service and it would
involve us in a frightful fantasy.
''I remember Winnie Ewing saying . . .'' (at this point he breaks into
an alarmingly realistic impersonation of Madame Ecosse) ''. . . When
Scotland sits proudly between Saudi Arabia and Senegal at the United
Nations there will never be war any more. We will run the world.
''We don't need all that fantasy. We are a dignified, wonderful,
historic country. We are remarkably fortunate to be a little vineyard on
our own.''
But in his own profession of the law many who would not consider
themselves Nationalists still see a paradox inherent in a legal system
without a legislature.
''I agree it is a paradox, but it is a paradox that has existed since
1707, I suppose. But the Scots legal system has survived and thrived in
all its individuality and principle, which is more than can be said for
the law of England.
''One thing that infuriates me is when a radio broadcaster or someone
in a newspaper article talks about this law and that law when it is
nothing to do with Scotland and is all about English law.''
ON DRINK
* SANCTIMONY and perceived puritanism has always raised Fairbairn's
hackles, nowhere more so than in hypocrisy on drinking. ''If you look at
the history of the world, alcohol has always played its part. Take all
this crap just now about being allowed to drink in England from seven
till seven! Jesus Christ, look at any continental country, if you are
thirsty you go in and buy a drink of wine.
''This concept that it should be licensed as a poison is utterly
ridiculous. It is natural for 98% of the people. The idea that it is
some sort of permitted sin is fatuous. What are all those pubs there
for? It's a form of puritanism and self satisfied intolerance.''
Now he is taking life a few weeks at a time, setting targets a month
or two away: ''I have got an exhibition of paintings coming up in March
at in Edinburgh. That's the next hurdle to jump,'' he says. ''Then we're
looking at the second volume of my autobiography coming out. It's been
at the publisher for months. I have also written a novel called Murder
Most Manifest which is with publishers in Edinburgh.''
One goal at a time, no regrets. Sir Nicholas turns his painter's gaze
to the windows and a stunning view across Fife, savouring the clear
Scottish air.
''Isn't it lovely this winter? This sun and light and straggles of
snow. We have had it for months now. It is absolutely wonderful.''

THE Middle East peace process is in the deepest trouble and the
Ramadan summit held last night will not of itself bring about
resuscitation. This is not for want of trying. The United States has
been hyperactive behind the scenes in promoting the idea of the summit
and ensuring that everyone attends. The measure of Washington's success
is the fact that Prime Minister Rabin of Israel sat down for the first
time with three key Arab leaders to discuss the process face-to-face.
Almost as important was the presence of Mr Rabin at the sunset meal with
which Muslims end a day of Ramadan fasting. Inviting him was a gesture
of acceptance by the Arab leaders which has heartening implications
which go far beyond the simple breaking of bread. That should take care
of the symbolism of the affair. The substance is quite a different
matter.
In their own way each of the four leaders faces domestic difficulty.
President Mubarak of Egypt is struggling against violent Islamic
militants and King Hussein and Yasser Arafat have similar trouble and a
lack of progress on the peace process with which to beguile their
people. Mr Rabin is losing credibility with every terrorist outrage and
Israel's inability to do much about it. To this extent their interests
meet; each would welcome a meaningful resumption of the peace process
but must carefully guard his constituency at home against the attacks of
the malign and discontent. This is reflected in the conclusions reached
at the summit which call for an end to political violence, more progress
in implementing agreements already established between Israel and the
Palestinians, and a good deal more speed and flexibility in passing
promised international aid to the Palestinians.
Mr Arafat and the Palestinians are unhappy with the stress put on
terrorism and would like to see greater importance given to extending
Palestinian control over the occupied territories. Frankly, they will
have to put up with this. The appalling terrorism of recent weeks has
drastically slowed a process which was already limping. The terrorists
are not winning but it is tempting to say that at the moment they are
ahead on points. The saddest fact underpinning that equally sad
admission is that there is little that either Mr Arafat or Mr Rabin can
do to stop the terrorism. The man who could do a great deal, and who the
latest Israeli intelligence indicates is serious in his desire to
achieve peace with Israel, is missing. President Assad of Syria was not
asked because he would only have refused. Persuading this cautious and
deeply enigmatic man to join the peace process is rapidly becoming the
key to success, as he no doubt intends. It must be managed, however it
is done. In the meantime symbolism must suffice, and the extension of
the message of Ramadan, which is peace, is still the most worthwhile aim
of all.

THE Scottish National Party has called on Scottish Secretary Ian Lang
to elaborate on the Scottish Office's contact with English water
companies who have expressed an interest in operating contracts for new
water authorities north of the Border.
Following the disclosure in Wednesday's Herald that Northumbrian Water
has signed a deal with John Brown Engineering to co-operate in a bid for
the contracts, SNP water spokesman Mr Andrew Welsh has tabled questions
on the deal.
Mr Welsh, MP for Angus East, said: ''It is important that people in
Scotland are kept informed about what is happening to the water industry
in Scotland. The Scottish Office must know of enquiries made by these
private companies.
''The fact that a private water company in England is interested in
investing in Scottish water will be cause for some concern.''
Northumbrian and John Brown will bid for contracts under the
Government's BOO initiative -- Build, Own, and Operate -- aimed at
passing on major capital projects to the private sector. The Scottish
Office have identified 15 such schemes.

Lesley Bilinda prayed for the return of her missing husband. She has
been told he was killed.
THERE IS one particularly poignant series of photographs in Lesley
Bilinda's collection. They show her and her husband, Charles, shortly
after their wedding, walking, arms linked, through the doors of their
new home. Behind them, the lush and tranquil Rwandan countryside. Around
them, groups of smiling friends.
Less than 18 months after they were taken Lesley walked on her own
across a mass grave near her former home, found her pet dog grown fat on
human flesh, and tried to make some sense of the madness that had
apparently killed Charles and slaughtered hundreds of thousands of
others.
Rwanda has become, for most of us, the definition of horror. The
source of countless blurred and bloody nightmarish images. The gaping
slice left by a machete. A carpet of half-clothed bones on a church
floor. The ancient, agonised faces of young refugees. How many dead?
Maybe one million? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, keep
counting, nine, 10, 11.
For Lesley Bilinda, Rwanda had been home since she was sent there in
1989 by the Tear Fund, a Christian relief and development organisation,
to work in a preventive-medicine project in the small town of Gahini,
near Kigali.
Born in Montrose and trained as a nurse and midwife in London, she
embodies the best of her stock and her profession -- a no-nonsense
north-east realism and a calm, compassionate and capable nature.
The community of Gahini took her to its heart. She made many close
friends but says she can't remember the first time she met Charles, the
young Tutsi pastor, who had been sent to the region to oversee an
environmental-health project. He was lively and outgoing and spoke
impeccable English, and they eventually came together through mutual
friends.
The Rwandan wedding is a complex and drawn-out affair, so they decided
to limit their own to a traditional ceremony in Gahini and a more formal
one in a Kigali church.
Sitting in her sister's flat in Edinburgh with Charles's face smiling
up from the photographs in her album, she says that even the riotous and
colourful rejoicing of the wedding snaps is a little misleading. There
was disquiet in Rwanda even then.
''We nearly didn't get to Kigali for the second ceremony, because
there had been a number of political rallies and they had been getting
more and more violent . . . things were certainly brewing.''
In the spring of the following year, she left for Nairobi to meet her
sister for a two-week holiday. ''Charles had other commitments and was
not able to come at that stage. It was just a two-week holiday. I had a
rucksack packed with summer clothes.''
That was March 29. Eight days later, the plane carrying the presidents
of Rwanda and Burundi was shot down and the country slipped into
anarchy.
For two days Lesley was unaware what had happened. Her sister had
taken ill and the pair were stranded in Mombasa. ''I had called in a
doctor and when he found out I was from Rwanda he said: 'Oh, that's
where the president was killed'. I thought he was confusing it with the
Burundian president who was killed last year. He said: 'No, no, they
were both killed on Wednesday'. It was the first I heard of it. I
switched on the radio and listened hour by hour. I couldn't believe what
I was hearing. By that time the killings had spread all over the
country. It was absolute madness.''
She managed to make it back to Nairobi and tried feverishly to get
information about Charles and her friends. Her home had no telephone and
she eventually reached an ex-pat in Kigali. The woman warned her that
everyone who could was leaving.
''I could not get in touch with Charles and I knew people were being
evacuated. I guess I thought that he's the husband of a British citizen
and perhaps he will be able to be evacuated.''
The next few hours and days were almost unbearable. ''I was just
frantically trying anything and everything that we possible could. It
was an awful, awful time.'' She pauses and looks away for a second,
fingers knitting, brow creasing.
Eventually Lesley realised that there was absolutely nothing she could
do. ''Then I saw that I needed not to trust in what governments can do
but to trust in what God can do.'' She turned to prayer and, in the
middle of April, returned to Scotland to be with her family.
A month later she received a call from Rwanda saying that Charles had
made it to the town of Butare in the south and had been killed there. It
was the first of several such rumours.
''To begin with I was completely knocked flat by it. I was believing
very strongly that he was going to be kept safe. Why, why should this
happen if we were praying . . . I was going up and down and not really
knowing what to believe.''
As she was gradually coming to accept that Charles might be dead, and
was preparing to go back out to Rwanda, a British friend brought word
that Charles had been staying with the bishop in Butare when the
military had come and taken him away.
''I was grateful that it was the military that had taken him and not
the militia. At least it would have been a quick death. However there
was still this tiny hope that he might be in hiding somewhere.''
Just before she left Scotland in October, she managed to get through
by phone to Charles's sister and her husband in Kigali. Out of an
extended family of 200, three of them had survived. They had no news of
Charles.
The trip back took an enormous emotional toll on her and talking about
it is clearly painful. She met friends who had survived and learned of
the deaths of others, including an infant relative clubbed to death on
her mother's back. ''I was also told about those who did the killing.
They were people I had known well, people that I would never have
suspected could have done this.''
The house she shared with Charles had been commandeered by a Rwandan
Patriotic Front official and her attempts to return and remove some of
her belongings were chillingly rebuffed. She eventually gained access to
the house but left feeling her life was in danger. ''I was walking up
the path thinking, any moment now there will be a gun in my back.''
A second home where she had lived before her marriage was now occupied
by a group of nuns and as she sat chatting with them, a dog appeared at
her side. Lesley asked if they had seen another dog, her own pet
mongrel, Isla, and the nuns motioned her to the bottom of the garden
where a dog like Isla had just given birth.
Walking over what used to be her vegetable patch, one of the sisters
turned to her and whispered: ''So many have been buried here.''
''I looked down. There were bones and bits of clothing and bits of
skull all over the garden, just buried in shallow graves. I was
absolutely gutted. I was walking in the midst of it. In what used to be
my garden.''
The dog turned out to be Isla and Lesley broke down. ''It seems stupid
when I think about it to cry over a dog when there was so much human
suffering around. It was the symbolism of it . . . she represented my
life. It was so gutting and so moving.'' The nuns told her that Isla,
now skinny and flea-ridden, had grown fat after eating the human remains
littering the land.
In Butare she learned that Charles had been arrested by the army in
Gahini shortly after the crisis started in April but had been given a
lift to Butare by an army official he knew well. At the time the
university town was quiet and the murderous Interahamwe militia kept in
check. It didn't last long and the soldiers finally came for Charles in
the church guesthouse.
''They came right to his room,'' said Lesley. ''Someone must have told
them he was there. We visited the room where he was,'' she stops herself
and takes a deep breath, ''where he had been. That was very, very sad,
very, very moving. I stood in the room on my own. There was a mat on the
floor and I knelt on the floor and prayed and wept.''
She has no idea where his body lies, but expects it to be in one of
the countless mass graves around the town. With no burial and no marked
resting place, she is keeping his name alive with the Charles Bilinda
Memorial Trust -- a fund set up to provide educational opportunities for
Rwandans in the UK.
She herself is writing a book and, at 35, is still uncertain about her
own future. She will not return to Rwanda to live.
The events of the past eight months have forced her to question but
not doubt her religious faith. Asked if she can forgive those who
murdered her husband, she looks long and hard at the floor.
''Forgiveness is not an option for a Christian. It is a command,'' she
says finally and firmly. ''There is no point in harbouring bitterness
and resentment against them. They have done wrong and they will have to
answer to God.'' There is another long pause before she lifts her head
and says quietly: ''I do not hold it against them.''
* Lesley Bilinda's experiences will be the subject of a BBC2
documentary Moment of Truth next Wednesday at 8pm. Information on the
Charles Bilinda Memorial Trust can be obtained from 3 Millerfield Place,
Edinburgh, EH9 1LW.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke provoked a fresh row at Westminster last
night over the level of expenditure on Scotland.
Mr Clarke said that Government expenditure per head in 1993-94 was
#3458 in England, #3913 in Wales, #4185 in Scotland and #4781 in
Northern Ireland.
The issue was raised by Tory MP Peter Viggers, who said: ''Although we
English are happy, in present circumstances to support the Scots, do you
not agree that the substantial subsidy for Scots and others might be
different if there were a tax-raising parliament in Scotland?.
''Do you agree that the Scots may face the double jeopardy of a
Scottish tax from Edinburgh and relutance from London to pay the present
20% subsidy to Scotland?''
Mr Clarke said: ''Scotland receives a considerable subsidy from
England, but that is based on the Government's judgment of needs in the
various countries, and we judge that to be the correct level of
spending.
Mr Viggers was right to say it was proposed that the Scots should have
a parliament with the ability to raise 3p in the pound on income tax.
The Chancellor told the House: ''Why one should be taxed more heavily
for working in Scotland than for working in England I am not sure, nor
am I sure what advantage it would bring to the Scots.
''The English taxpayer might ask why, if the Scots have 3p in the
pound to spare, he should continue to shift so much money north of the
Border.''
Mr Clarke said: ''Scotland receives more by way of expenditure than it
pays in taxation, but that is entirely right if a United Kingdom
Govermment and a United Kingdom parliament decide that it reflects the
needs of the population in certain areas.
''I cannot understand why it is proposed by some that if one works in
Scotland one should pay 3p more in the pound in income tax than if one
does the same job in England. I can only imagine that that is likely to
be damaging to the Scottish economy.''

<TEXT>
THE Government yesterday launched a major inquiry into the leak that
threw the Northern Ireland peace process into jeopardy.
The Prime Minister ordered the Northern Ireland Office to investigate
the source of highly damaging disclosures about UK-Irish proposals for a
political settlement.
Downing Street said the investigation would be conducted internally by
the NIO with findings reported to Cabinet Secretary Sir Robin Butler.
Irish Premier John Bruton has ordered a similar inquiry in Dublin --
but is insisting that there is no evidence to link the leak to his
government.
Downing Street yesterday refused to be drawn on the claim by deputy
Irish Premier Dick Spring that the long-delayed framework document might
be ready for publication by the end of the month.
A senior official said: ''We have never set a time limit in any event
other than to say that we would like to have the framework document
agreed as soon as possible.''
Leak inquiries in Whitehall are renowned for failing to identify
culprits, but are launched to underline ministerial disapproval.
The Northern Ireland Office was unable to give further details about
the scope of the inquiry, but it will centre on Ministers and officials
who are kept informed of UK-Irish contacts.
It was not known how many people would be involved -- the issue has
come before a Cabinet sub-committee involving non-Northern Ireland
Ministers -- or whether people outside the Government would be
questioned.
Senior Tories yesterday kept up their criticism of the the Times'
story on the leak.
The party's ex-chairman Sir Norman Fowler (Sutton Coldfield) -- a
former journalist on the paper -- said: ''It is certainly the role of
newspapers to expose the truth.''
However, he added during during exchanges on coming parliamentary
business: ''It is a matter of public concern that the Times may have
allowed itself to be used as a vehicle for propaganda in an attempt to
wreck the talks that have been going on.''
Leader of the Commons Tony Newton, noting Sir Norman's journalistic
background, said: ''I give great weight to your remarks.''
Tory Patrick Cormack (Staffordshire South) said: ''A free responsible
press is essential to the functioning of a demacracy. But an
irresponsible press can undermine democracy.''
He urged: ''Can we have a debate on the general issue of the freedom
and ethics of the press?''
Mr Newton said he would bear the request in mind and added: ''I would
hope the points you have made will be firmly registered by those
responsible for printing this story.''
He later told the House the Government will seek to renew the
Prevention of Terrorism Act.
''The Act is due for renewal by March 22 and I expect to bring forward
the necessary motion in due course.''
The legislation, renewed each year, allows terrorist suspects to be
detained for seven days without charge

THE Government was defeated in the Lords last night as peers backed --
by eight votes -- a move to effectively ban noisy sports, like power
boat racing and motorcycle riding, from National Parks.
Voting was 129 to 121 for an amendment during the Environment Bill's
committee stage. It calls for promotion of opportunities for the ''quiet
enjoyment and understanding'' of the parks' special qualities.
An Environment Department spokesman said the Government would reflect
on the issues raised and look at the matter again when the Bill reaches
the Commons.
The Bill includes measures to establish new independent authorities
for the 10 National Parks in England and Wales.
Tory Lord Norrie, a member of the Council of National Parks, moved the
amendment saying activities in the parks should not ''intrude on the
enjoyment of others''. Pursuits should involve ''muscle power and not
motor power'', he said.
However, Environment Minister of State Viscount Ullswater opposed a
''blanket ban''.
Lord Williams of Elvel, for Labour, urged the Government to enshrine
the principle of quiet enjoyment in the Bill.

<HEADLINE>Cannabis dealer to learn fate in 'exceptional case'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980041954</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A MUSICIAN will be sentenced at the High Court in Inverness today for
dealing in drugs.
David Bremner, 43, of Tain, a former nurse, has admitted being
concerned in the supply of more than 600 grammes of cannabis, as well as
four previous convictions -- three for petty theft and another
drugs-related offence.
Defence advocate, Mr Ian Duguid, told Lord MacLean yesterday that
Bremner was an ''exceptional case'' because so many people depended upon
him.
He said Bremner, who has two children, gave up a musical career in
Edinburgh to return north to look after his ailing parents and later
care for his brother's two children.
Mr Duguid revealed the brother lost his first wife in a road accident
and committed suicide after learning that his second wife was pregnant
to another man.
However, Advocate-depute Iain Bonomy, QC, painted a picture of
Bremner, of Ivy Lane, St Duthus Street, Tain, as a major player in a
commercial drug dealing operation.
Mr Bonomy said a police raid on Bremner's house discovered the haul of
cannabis, with a street value of more than #3000, and #770 cash, the
proceeds of some of his sales.
An address book detailing other drug deals worth hundreds of pounds
was also found. Mr Bonomy said Bremner confessed to police he had bought
the drug for #2900 in Edinburgh and had sold almost #1000 of it.
However, Mr Duguid said his client now maintainted some of that
confession was lies, and that the drugs had been delivered to him in
Tain. Bremner also claimed some of the figures listed in his address
book did not refer to drugs transactions.
Mr Duguid explained Bremner's route into drugs was down to his concern
for the welfare of his family.
''Because he spent so much time looking after his family, he was
unable to fulfil as many musical engagements and the debts mounted up,
leading to his drugs involvement.
''Shortly after his arrest, his mother died and Bremner has devoted
all his days and nights to his father, who was taken into hospital
yesterday, still not knowing his son is facing this serious charge.
''His wife is also so physically and mentally ill, she cannot face
attending court today. He is also devoted to her and his two children.
Who knows what will happen to them if he is sent to jail?
''I am not suggesting that anyone dealing in drugs should escape a
lengthy custodial sentence, but Mr Bremner is an exceptional case and
may deserve an exceptional disposal.''
Deferring sentence, Lord MacLean said Bremner ''was only exceptional
because so many people around him depend upon him. I don't find this at
all easy. It is an unusual, if not an exceptional, case and I will
consider it overnight''.

David Belcher charts the rise of Shooglenifty
SHOOGLENIFTY is an apt name for a band who shake things up in a sharp,
spruce, pretty, and agile fashion. Shooglenifty's physical roots are
all-encompassing, stretching from Orkney, Inverness, and Edinburgh to
Spanish hillsides. Similarly wide-ranging, their musical inputs boast a
multiplicity of arcane labels -- ethno-ambient trance-dance, dub,
hardbag -- as well as Scottish traditional music in its many and varied
forms.
And Shooglenifty have blended this variety into a splendid pulsing,
lilting whole, one that is thoroughly contemporary and completely
timeless, too. That can simultaneously charm the hand-knitted wholemeal
beards of the folk traditionalist as well as rouse the sophisticated
young metropolitan clubber whose perceptions have been formed by Chicago
house and the mechanistic blare of techno.
How else can you explain why in 1995, the busiest year in
Shooglenifty's two-year existence, the band are likely to be undertaking
diverse gigs in far-flung lands and disparate settings. Hip London
niteries. The Shetland Folk Festival. Glastonbury Festival. Austria.
Poland. Bracknell Festival, supporting Jah Wobble. Sidmouth Festival in
Devon, supporting Ali Farka Toure. Plus shows in Britain and Spain
during WOMAD, that annual touring celebration of global culture.
But to find out where they're going, you have to know where
Shooglenifty are coming from and where they're at.
Malcolm Crosbie, Garry Finlayson, James Mackintosh and Conrad Ivitsky
share a single Edinburgh origin in Swamptrash. ''As Swamptrash, we
pretended to be Louisiana cajun cotton-pickers,'' says Orcadian Garry.
''I think we're happier now being our Scottish selves.''
Elsewhere in Scottish music circles, Inverness-born Mackintosh
regularly thumps his tubs with trademark gusto for Capercaillie and
Mouth Music. Angus Grant's CV takes in Chou Pahrot, an early Glaswegian
Beefheartian ensemble. Songwriting mandolin-man Iain Macleod was once a
Little Red Duffle Coat and a Clumsy Lover.
Following Swamptrash's demise in 1990, informal mix'n' match sessions
in Edinburgh pubs kept everyone together until Shooglenifty was adopted
as a collective monicker during a Spanish busking holiday in mountain
villages outside Madrid. Edinburgh residencies followed, the most
crucial one being at a somewhat malodorous nightclub.
''The way you play is changed by the environment you play in, and our
six months in a place that smelt like the inside of an old training-shoe
definitely gave our music a raw cutting-edge,'' opines Garry Finlayson,
whose humble acoustic banjo has mutated, courtesy of digital electronic
technology, into a mighty banjax.
Similarly startling transformations were effected when Shooglenifty
entered the recording studio at the behest of mainstream traditional
label Greentrax, and with renowned folkie Jim Sutherland as their
producer. ''We were known for being a high-energy live dance act rather
than a recording act, and it was a real gamble for Ian Green to take us
on.
''We had to do a lot of talking about our music for the first time,
and take a major jump in sophistication in terms of arrangements, which
had always been fluid and flexible, something that simply happened on
stage. Yet in the same way, our music's shape has been due to our never
having rejected any style, rather than our deliberately having adopted
one.
''But Jim Sutherland was an excellent ideas man in the studio, and in
the way that Walt Disney seemed to, he'll allow an idea to take a
physical form before he wheels out his critic's heavy artillery.''
Venus In Tweeds was the album which resulted from this process, and
following Shooglenifty's two triumphant Celtic Connections' performances
last month, it was voted LP of the year by Radio Scotland's folk-roots
fraternity. Moving their music out into the wider world, Shooglenifty
supported Runrig in Edinburgh's Princes Street Gardens at Hogmanay, and
then played in a happening London danceteria, the SW1 Club.
Additionally, they have a new, club-oriented single in the pipeline,
while Garry and his banjax have been invited to play live in the mix
alongside the DJs who run the Clockwork club-night at Glasgow's Arches
on the last Saturday of every month.
''Ah yes, the banjax,'' Garry says with a messianic glint in his eye.
''I can get a longer sustain, a longer ring on the notes now. I can
drive into some strange new places.''
Aye, when it comes to sustained and wondrous new strangeness,
Shooglenifty's the only word.

TWO years after Cardinal Winning announced that the Archdiocese of
Glasgow was #9.2m in the red, the debt has been cut by more than #2m.
Spending cuts, sales of surplus Church assets, and weekly collections
appear to be working.
Last year, weekly collections raised #950,000, bringing the total
donated since the cardinal's appeal to #2m. However, the Church urges
that the high level of donations continues.
A spokesman said: ''At this rate, we are very confident that we will
be able to reduce the debt to #4m by the end of this year.''
Since the debt was announced, the Archdiocese has undertaken a
rigorous cost-cutting operation, which involved redundancies and strict
budget cuts.
Twelve acres of land in Bearsden has been sold for #2.25m. The lion's
share will go to Glasgow but parts will be distributed to the dioceses
of Motherwell and Paisley.
The archdiocese has sold the former Pastoral Centre at Briar Road,
Newlands, for #2.1m, but will retain part of the eight-acre site.

A PRIMARY in Dunblane is set to become the second school in Scotland
to opt out of local authority control after a dispute about the sale of
the building was resolved.
The board of the 150-year-old St Mary's Episcopalian school began
moves to secure self-governing status more than two years ago, a move
opposed by Central Region.
In a ballot more than 75% of parents voted for opting out, but this
was delayed when the then Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld, and Dunblane,
the Rt Rev Michael Hare Duke -- the Episcopalian-owned school's only
remaining trustee -- asked for guarantees about St Mary's future before
he would agree its sale.
Scottish Office school inspectors could not act on the opt out vote
until the sale issue was settled.
With Bishop Hare Duke's retiral, this has been resolved. The new
temporary trustee, the Very Rev Ian Watt, Dean of St Andrews, Dunkeld,
and Dunblane, confirmed last night that he had agreed to approve the
sale.
The school board chairman, Mr Alan Bateman, said he was ''quite
pleased'' by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang's announcement that he would
approve the board's proposals, subject to further consultation.
Mr Bateman said: ''It has been a long slog. After the Bishop retired
last October the Dean took over as trustee until a new Bishop is in
place. We had discussions with Mr Watt and we have agreed that we can
now go ahead.
''The school will be valued by the district valuer. If the board,
Scottish Office, and church agree a figure the Secretary of State will
provide funds to buy the school.''
But Central Region last night attacked Mr Lang's decision. Its leader,
Councillor Corrie McChord, said: ''We are very disappointed that common
sense has not prevailed. We have great concerns about the viability of
such a small school going it alone . . . a planning application is
sitting with Stirling district for a brand-new school just a quarter of
a mile away.''
Mr Lang said the board would need to change its proposals for
admissions because they favoured Episcopalian children.
But Mr Bateman, who has two children at the school but who is not
Episcopalian, said the board knew the admissions' policy would have to
be changed.
Under opting out the school will be funded directly by the Scottish
Office and run by a board of management with an in-built parental
majority.
Mr Lang said the school could be self-governing in the next school
session, which begins in August.
Central Region planned to build a new school to replace St Mary's and
cope with an expected influx of children from new housing developments
but parents fought to keep St Mary's.
The only other opted out school in Scotland is Dornoch Academy, a
two-year secondary in the Highlands.

MY art teacher, the legendary Ralph Cowan, once gave our class a title
and a theme for a figure composition. It was ''The Demonstration''. We
had to have at least three people and one of the figures had to be in
front of another one and the composition had to have a structure which
could be analysed in terms of Rembrandt. Ralph has awfully high
standards, believe me.
This was the mid-fifties. Mr Cowan was a well-kent chap who had
designed much of the wonderful glass work in the Queen Elizabeth the
first (the ship that is), and his work can be seen to this day, albeit
only in America. He sported lovat-coloured suits and waistcoats and
splendidly artistic woven ties, and wore his hair, proudly, long and
distinguished. It was he, who following an outrage upon my person by the
science department of my school, or at least an especially psychotic
representative of it, for my abject failure in some examination . . . it
was Ralph Cowan who drew me aside and commiserated with me. ''My boy,
they are nothing but Philistines,'' he informed me, ignorant as I was of
the tribe save for rather basic scriptural knowledge, ''but We Shall Win
in The End''.
I am not sure We ever do, but it was nice to have this awesome and
elegant dominie and artist tell me convincing and heart-warming lies at
that, even if the hands were dropping off me. And Ralph gave us this
title and theme: ''The Demonstrators''.
The mid to late fifties saw, suddenly, lots of demonstrations. By
people. They were then, and probably quite rightly too, regarded as a
touch crankish. More than that, it seemed to a generation who had seen a
deal too much public disorder during the Depression years, and too much
overheated nonsense over Spain, for instance, and too many Communist
Party members dissenting about fighting the Nazis -- and too much public
shows from the great dictatorships of the world. Crowds of demonstrators
were to be found not merely in Europe, from Soviet Russia to Hitler's
Rhinelands: the United States crowds would assemble for anything from
support for the German bunds to weeping hordes for Father Coughlan; from
evangelists to lynch mobs.
The average British citizen felt uneasy about large groups of people
gathering together to make a collective point and they were right and
wrong about it. Wrong because legitimate protest is legitimate -- if
there are elderly, for they must be by now, men and women who ever stood
in decency and a vigil outside a prison in which some unfortunate was to
be hanged in the early hours of the morning, if there are those out
there I applaud you. For the equally elderly who still get together at a
centopaph, I feel grateful to you for your display. There are, I am
sure, many worthy shows of concern and solidarity. Not the least of them
being political demos.
I yet remember the surge of concern over Vietnam, and over Ireland
when the peace people in both concerns impressed, but not enough. Or the
civil rights marches throughout the US, or even the student demos for
decent grants. I harbour a faint admiration for the frisson created by
the mass action of French students in 1968, or for the American students
who hit the Chicago Convention. But at the end of it all, I still worry
about demonstrations.
Why a group of utterly unelected people should exert so much influence
-- if they do, and sometimes it is so -- is hardly right. The churches,
for instance, have contrived to stop me from having a drink in a hotel
bar on a Sunday before half-past midday, simply because they insist on
such a process. Regular churchgoers make up less than 4% of the Scottish
population. They once had even larger powers of control over the
remaining 96% of the Scottish people. And you should worry about that.
Just as you should about the largely silly people who have been
attempting to stop the export of veal calves. One poor demonstrator has
been killed through an excess of zeal, not veal. Do not believe for one
minute that, should the demonstrators get their way and close down this
industry, they will stop there. I ate veal last night, in the splended
Idries Hotel in Forfar. A Marsala sauce it was. I eat this rather
tasteless, but beautifully textured cut often. When in Italy I eat
vitellone, which is the calf slaughtered before it stops suckling.
Dressed and dredged in flour and breadcrumbs, it is delicious. Even
better in the Hungarian style with hot cherry paprikas and noodles and a
wine vinegar sauce. Poor little calves with their big eyes, the
four-footed version of Leslie Caron. They would not even be bred if we
did not eat them.
But the demonstrators are out there, demanding, well, just demanding.
And they will not stop there at all. They will eventually try to stop
meat. Or fish. Or eggs. The oceans will be overflowing with floating
corpses of fish. Animals will not be bred at all. The farmers will kill
the animals they cannot support. They will breed no further progeny.
Vegans will have no butter or milk or cream or cheese. A sports
colleague of mine from a sister paper tells me he is going to eat
nothing but veal for a fortnight just out of badness. I think he is
being a touch cowardly. I'm thinking of eating vegans myself, sauced and
marinated. A demonstration, if you like, with a lot of style at that. I
learned it from Ralphie Cowan, my old art teacher.

THE Prime Minister yesterday urged MPs to wait for the publication of
the controversial framework document on Northern Ireland, study it in
its entirety and recognise it was for consultation.
He told the Commons nothing would be imposed on the people of Northern
Ireland and reinforced his assurances to Unionists that they had nothing
to fear from the peace process.
His comments to MPs followed his televised appeal on Wednesday night
for people in the Province to give him time and trust, in a bid to
defuse the row over a leaked draft of the document.
Mr Major earlier yesterday ordered the Northern Ireland Office to
investigate the source of the highly damaging disclosures about
Anglo-Irish proposals for a political settlement.
At Question Time, Labour leader Tony Blair offered the Prime Minister
his party's full and continued support for the peace process.
In exchanges, Mr Major said: ''There is a communal will not to be
distracted from the goal of a peaceful and permanent and agreed
settlement in Northern Ireland.''
He later added: ''The end is very straightforward and a very simple
one: to end the horrors of the last 25 years, and to make sure that
never again do people get killed month after month after month after
month, as they have in the last 25 years.''
Raising the issue, Labour's John Home Robertson said the Ulster
Unionist Party's William Ross (Londonderry East) had claimed Mr Major's
Northern Ireland initiative was now dead and buried.
Mr Home Robertson, MP for East Lothian, demanded: ''Would it not be an
affront to all the soldiers and the civilians who have been killed and
buried over the last 25 years if this initiative were to be jeopardised
as a result of a malicious, partial leak of a draft framework document?
''All our constituents are getting very weary of the ancient refrain
of 'Ulster says no', which is still being parroted by some Unionist
Members -- but thankfully only some Unionist Members.''
Mr Major replied: ''I believe there is a wish right across the House,
including those Members who represent Northern Ireland, to find a
satisfactory way forward. I have not a shred of doubt about that.
''We have all watched with dismay the activities of the last 25 years.
''Members who represent Ulster have lived through that in a way you
and I haven't.
''I've no doubt from my contact with Members in Northern Ireland -- on
points on which we agree and on points on which we do not agree -- about
their sincerity in seeking to bring to a conclusion the miseries of the
last 25 years.''
Mr Nigel Waterson (Eastbourne -- Con.) told Mr Major: ''The goal of a
peaceful settlement in Ulster is worthy of the courage and patience you
have demonstrated.
''Will you continue to assure the people of that Province that any
final decision will always rest with them?''
Mr Major replied: ''There is a communal will not to be distracted from
the goal of a peaceful and permanent and agreed settlement in Northern
Ireland.
''I am happy to repeat the assurance that I've given on occasions in
the past: the outcome of the political talks -- after the main
constiutional parties have met and agreed the outcome -- that outcome
will be put to people in a referendum before further action is taken.
''It is they who will decide, and nothing will be imposed upon them.''
After Mr Blair told him: ''On Northern Ireland, you have our full and
continued support,'' Mr Major replied: ''I appreciate the support of
Labour and other parties as far as Northern Ireland is concerned, and I
think it is a strength of the process that there is such widespread
support for it.''
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, who as an officer once saw
service in Northern Ireland, told him: ''For as long as you put the
peace of Ireland first, you will command the overwhelming majority of
this House and the country.
''Those who would put in jeopardy the peace of Ireland to pursue
either narrow sectarian agendas, or internal party power struggles, will
meet the opposition of this House and earn the contempt of the
country.''
Mr Major said: ''I'm grateful for your support. Let me say: there is
nothing in the peace process which any party in this House need fear.
''There can be no slippery slope in any process which firstly requires
the agreement of all the parties and then, after the agreement of the
parties has been obtained, subsequently requires the agreement of the
people of Northern Ireland themselves.''
Responding to barracking from Labour left-winger Dennis Skinner
(Bolsover), the Prime Minister said: ''The end is very straightforward
and a very simple one: to end the horrors of the last 25 years, and to
make sure that never again do people get killed month after month after
month after month, as they have in the last 25 years.''
He told Mr Skinner: ''I would have hoped even you would have supported
that enterprise.''

ON the evidence of this very lacklustre production by Irresistible
Flood the promise which young playwright Lara Jane Bunting has
previously shown would appear to be waning. It's debatable whether her
choice of subject -- pit closures in Ayrshire -- is either tired and
unimaginative or bold and defiantly unfashionable but her treatment is
vapid.
The theme is unoriginal: a crisis exposing cracks in a seemingly happy
family unit. Sanny and his son Lex, both miners, are divided in their
reaction to imminent pit closure. Sanny, emotionally diminished by the
eighties strike, sees no option but redundancy. Lex wants to fight. His
mother Nell fails to conceal her relief that the mine is to close,
thereby irritating Lex's fiance, Ellen, who discerns Nell's
disappointment that her son chose a small-town life. The resultant
domestic tensions are predictable and humdrum, with Bunting failing to
mesh the strained exchanges into any kind of dramatic climax.
She hints at more interesting dynamics but fails to focus on them,
with the result that the character's dilemmas are completely
uninvolving. There is also a heavy-handed use of symbolism; a large
wedding cake onstage is slowly stripped of decoration as the betrothed
couple's life becomes austere. Most irritating is Nell's incessant
invocation of a twee poem To My Child, the concluding line of which
inspired the play's title.
The experienced Mary McCluskey's direction is surprisingly turgid and
the lighting is appalling. The only consolation is in the performances,
with Kirsty Wells, Diane Sobolewska, David Fehilly, and David McGowan
struggling admirably to inject the proceedings with some passion and
verve.

THE Labour hierarchy has unleashed ''the dogs of war'' on union leader
Bill Morris (above) over his opposition to redrafting Clause 4 of the
party constitution on public ownership, Mr Morris claimed yesterday.
Within hours of the Transport and General Workers' Union leader making
his position clear, anonymous senior Labour sources were briefing the
press insultingly about his ''confused, muddled and pusillanimous''
behaviour, he told the Spectator magazine.
''The dogs of war were unleashed against me but I am not bothered. My
street credibility rises every time they attack me,'' he said.
The comments will come as a bitter blow to Labour leader Tony Blair,
who is conducting a nationwide campaign to secure universal backing for
his call for the end of Clause 4.
Mr Morris said he had been waiting for ''men in white coats to take me
away because I was diagnosed as muddled and confused.''
He added: ''For them (Blair's advisers), it's got to be total victory
over people who dare contribute to the debate . . . we have got to be
trampled, crushed, annihilated and humiliated''.

PEOPLE should overcome their awe of the hi-tech nature of microwave
ovens and trust their common sense as they do with conventional ovens, a
food engineer warned yesterday in the wake of fears that a voltage
reduction in mains electricity throughout the UK will affect the
performance of some microwave ovens.
Steve James, a research engineer who has been working with microwave
ovens for 15 years at Bristol University's food refrigeration and
process engineering research centre, said that only two of the five
ovens they tested remained stable down to the new minimum permissible
level of 216 volts.
The electricity companies, including Scottish Power, say that the
change from 240 volts to 230 to bring Britain into line with the rest of
Europe should have no noticeable effect on domestic appliances, although
they acknowledge that microwaves will be the most sensitive to a
reduction.
Since ordinary consumers have no way of telling which ovens are
susceptible or when the voltage is particularly low, they should apply
the obvious test of whether the food is piping hot and remember that Mr
James also found that longer cooking at a slightly lower temperature
resulted in better-tasting food.

MARKS and Spencers' prestige Princes Street store is spearheading a
back-to-basics initiative that could see a return of ''corner shop''
service for millions of customers.
Along with the branches at Kensington and Marble Arch, Princes Street
is launching a food-delivery service from next Monday. For just #5 food
can be stored and delivered to homes and businesses in a wide area of
Edinburgh -- with punctuality guaranteed.
The service has been welcomed by Edinburgh District Council as an
imaginative contribution to its campaign to improve the environment in
the city centre.
''It should encourage more people to leave their cars at home,
relieving them about worries of where to park and the city of added
congestion,'' said the store's deputy general manager, Mr Paul
Stephenson, last night.
''We are proud to have been chosen from nearly 300 Marks and Spencers
stores to trial this service -- it's a return to old-fashioned values
and we are confident it will be popular with our customers.
''As fas as the #5 charge is concerned, this should be quickly
recouped on savings in petrol and parking fees -- you may also benefit
from being able to order a larger wine pack with a free extra bottle!''

STAFF at the Rolls-Royce design plant in East Kilbride faced with
redundancy will take their case to Germany and the United States in an
attempt to persuade the company's business partners of the damage the
decision to transfer 600 highly-skilled jobs to Derby will cause.
Trade union representatives told MPs at Westminster yesterday that
they have approached BRR, the German-based BMW-Rolls Royce consortium
designing the next generation of jet engine, to warn that the British
job losses will harm their project.
Mr Owen Thomas, chairman of the joint staff unions, said: ''We are
contacting partner companies in joint ventures and letting them know
what the effect will be. We know they are concerned about this.''
The transfer of the jobs, which shocked Scottish manufacturing
industry circles when it was announced last month, will have a knock-on
effect by delaying the completion of current work.
Trade unions believe BRR, and airframe manufacturer McDonnell-Douglas
in the United States, will be concerned at the implications of delays
for their own production and marketing schedules, as they are dependent
on the delivery of new engines designs from East Kilbride.
Mr Larry Brooke, national officer of the MSF science union, said:
''Highly skilled jobs are being wasted by this decision of Rolls Royce.
Slimming down has reached the point where it is becoming anorexia.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said the workforce would be
receiving strong support from Labour. ''It is at the cutting edge of
aerospace technology. Its highly skilled workforce has been cut back in
some blind attempt to rationalise.
''No doubt that proposal poses a real danger to those vital BRR
projects for new engines. All the indications coming back from Germany
show huge nervousness at the fact that people are going to be
dismayed.''
The trade unions, who hope to travel to Germany to meet BRR
representatives in the coming weeks, will also be seeking to enlist the
support of Mr Ken Collins, MEP for Strathclyde East and chairman of the
influential chairmens' committee in the European Parliament.

WHETHER by word, deed or garb Sir Nicholas Fairbairn has always gone
out of his way to cultivate a richly colourful image, not least in his
many self-penned entries for Who's Who.
''Author, painter, poet, TV and radio broadcaster, dress-designer,
landscape gardener, bon viveur and wit'' was his most literal
self-descrption. Others have been more eliptical, as he has regularly
changed the list of his recreations. At one time he suggested his spare
time was spent seeking ''the cure and eradication of British tick
fever''.
On other occasions he has alluded to his affection for the opposite
sex, describing his interests as ''philanthropy and philogyny'' or
''loving beauty and beautifying love''. More obscure was ''growling,
prowling, scowling and owling'', and most recently ''drawing ships,
making quips, confounding Whips, scuttling drips''. At least there could
be no argument about confounding the Whips.
No-one has ever accused him of mincing his words or hiding his
opinions, and among those he laid into or praised during his interview
with The Herald were:
* Robert Burns -- ''a false hero, a drunken, fornicating, roustabout
and social creep. What's heroic about a lot of shit-awful poetry?
* Hugh MacDiarmid -- ''a better poet, and certainly much more of a
character.''
* Former judge Lord Grant -- ''a frightful man who used to say: 'Mr
Fairbairn, please don't be even more stupid than you can help and do not
keep misleading the jury!'''
* Former judge Lord Clyde -- ''Although he was a frightful,
unprincipled rogue, I was rather fond of Clyde.''
* Former judge Lord Wheatley -- ''that puritan fanatic, a Catholic
aesthete.''
* His son, the current Sheriff -- ''a delight, extremely amusing and
charming and very good on the Bench.''
* The current Lord President, Lord Hope -- ''To say Lord Hope is grey
is being rude to porridge.''
* The former Soviet Union -- ''It is breaking up and you will be left
with these dozens of mini-states which will be very difficult to
control. I went into a shed in Russia and there were these atomic
rockets just lying around the floor. I said: 'Please remember to close
the door after I am gone.' Terrifying!''
* Africa -- ''This vast continent, of innumerable people, ruled over
by totally corrupt dicators of one kind and another, all with millions
stashed in offshore banks.
* Britain -- ''The Commonwealth is a an extremely outmoded piece of
sentimental British left-overs. That's our dilemma really, I suppose.
The Commonwealth is irrelevant. We're left spooning around pretending to
love Europe when we don't.''

A BUILDER appeared in court yesterday accused of kidnapping a cat and
demanding #10,000 for its release.
The Persian cat was reunited with its owner on Tuesday at a meeting at
London's Hilton Hotel in Mayfair, almost a week after it was allegedly
taken.
''Are cats allowed at the Hilton?'' asked the magistrate, Mr Geoffrey
Breen, at Horseferry Road Court. ''Evidently, yes,'' replied the
prosecutor.
The case is believed to be the first of its kind in Britain.
Nigel Bass, 32, of Shepherd's Bush, was granted bail at #5000. He was
charged with demanding #10,000 with menaces from Miss Ilona Szekeres, a
property developer, for the return of her valuable and much-loved cat.
He was also charged with stealing the cat from her home in Clapham,
south London, on January 25.
Miss Szekeres accompanied undercover detectives to collect her cat at
the Hilton.
Two men who made alleged telephone threats to harm the cat are still
being sought.
The prosecution asked for Mr Bass, a former business associate of the
cat's owner, to be remanded in custody. However the magistrate bailed
him after a plea from his solicitor, who said Mr Bass would live with
his wife and two children at the family home in Devon if freed.
Mr Bass was banned from London as a condition of bail, and ordered not
to contact Miss Szekeres, 35.
Mr Bass's wife stood as a #1000 surety, but he is being kept in
custody until his mother comes forward as a second surety of #4000.

THE weekly attempts of punters to strike it rich in the National
Lottery, could help Scotland to display the evidence of its human and
natural history.
The trustees of the National Museums of Scotland have submitted a bid
to the Heritage Lottery Fund for a #7.25m grant towards installing the
exhibitions in the Museum of Scotland being built in Edinburgh.
The printed proposal, arguing the project's case, was flown to the
Heritage Lottery Fund in London earlier this week.
It said: ''With your support, the new museum will open to
international acclaim in 1998 and provide a continuing asset of
incalculable value for generations yet to come.''
A spokeswoman for the trustees said yesterday they were optimistic
about the outcome of the application.
The grant would be equally matched with funds raised from the private
sector for the installation of the 10,000 items in the exhibitions.
The Government has already committed #30m to pay for the construction
of the building in Chambers Street and the NMS is financing expenditure
of around #17m over eight years.
The application said: ''This long cherished and deeply felt national
ambition can only be realised by a partnership between the private
sector and the Heritage Lottery Fund.''

DUNNET in Caithness seemed sufficiently remote to the occupant of the
old lighthouse there to justify the risk of setting up a
cannabis-growing operation.
John Sutherland, 50, eventually had 192 growing plants and the
necessary lighting equipment in a cellar under lighthouse's former
engine room.
Sutherland, a musician who performs under the stage name Johnny Fats,
also had smaller amounts of the drug in the former keeper's cottage
where he lived.
At the High Court in Inverness yesterday Sutherland admitted producing
cannabis, possessing the drug, and possession with intent to supply. The
offences took place between January and July 1993 at the Dunnet
lighthouse keeper's cottages.
Advocate-depute Iain Bonomy said police who arrived for a search found
Sutherland with two friends and two bags of herbal cannabis.
They found other small amounts of the drug in Sutherland's cottage and
the one next door, then brought in a sniffer dog which took them to the
lighthouse's former engine room.
They opened a trap-door leading to the cellar and found 152 plants and
growing equipment. Then another trap-door leading to another part of the
cellar was opened to reveal 40 larger plants.
Sutherland told officers at the time: ''You have got me cold. I am
against the other drugs the same as you are, but they should legalise
cannabis.''
Mr Bonomy said it was not easy to calculate the value of the 1338g of
cannabis found, but it was estimated to be #6690. He accepted that
Sutherland was not putting the drugs on the market.
Defence advocate Ian Duguid said Sutherland, who had previous
convictions for drugs offences, had been a cannabis user for 26 years.
He said Sutherland had no intention to sell the drugs commercially.
Instead he used the cannabis himself and provided it socially for
friends who visited. He said their value to a user was closer to #1500.
''His is purely a social supply which might be the equivalent of
providing a drink at a cocktail party.''
Mr Duguid added: ''He considers himself a connoisseur because of his
experience and his use.''
Lord MacLean said Sutherland was ''something of a campaigner'' after
hearing he had used the drug for half his life and believed it should be
legalised.
He deferred sentence until February 23 in Edinburgh for a community
service report.

THE future of an #8m research and development drilling facility in
Aberdeen looks to have been secured following European Commission
approval for debts totalling almost #2m to be written off.
The EC backed a proposal by Scottish Enterprise to convert loans from
Scottish Enterprise and Grampian Regional Council totalling #1,825,000
into a grant to help save and financially restructure the International
Drilling and Downhole Technology Centre (IDDTC).
It employs 13 staff full-time and during special projects hires up to
six more to run its 182ft onshore rig and associated facilities.
A peculiarity of the IDDTC is that the research and development work
is conducted by the clients and not by the centre itself.
The Herald understands that talks are already at an advanced stage on
the possibility of either a joint venture agreement or a management
contract covering the centre's future operation.
Last night Mr Hamish Dingwall of Scottish Enterprise's energy group
welcomed the decision. He said: ''It is our view that the reduction of
the financial burden on the centre will encourage more private sector
participation, thereby securing its long term future to provide open
access research, development and testing facilities to the international
oil and gas industry.''
The IDDTC is a non-profit making organisation which provides an
independent facility for companies to develop drilling equipment and
techniques without the risks and costs associated with testing on live
wells.
It was conceived during the oil slump of 1986 and seemed assured of
success -- since one day's lost drilling offshore could pay for up to 20
days of testing at the centre, but loan commitments have prevented it
taking off.
When in 1990 then Industry and Education Minister Ian Lang ''spudded''
the first well just a few hundred yards from Aberdeen beach at the
Bridge of Don it was expected the IDDTC might generate 1000 jobs for
Scotland.
In spite of its anticipated potential, the turnover has never exceeded
#500,000 in the past three years' of operation.
The EC heard that the Scottish Enterprise plan was a one-off measure,
necessary to save the centre because its turnover was too small to
generate enough profits to repay its debts.
The EC was also told that the IDDTC had taken steps to assure its
future viability including the reduction of costs and the implementation
of new projects.
The Scottish Enterprise proposal had been approved by the Scottish
Office but required EC approval to ensure it did not distort European
competition.
The EC decided the conversion of the loans into grants would not
threaten or distort competition.

FRED Perry was a people's champion, rising from workingclass, Northern
English roots to win a hat-trick of Wimbledon titles between 1934-36.
His background was a world away from the privilege and patronage which
typified tennis between the wars, and it was once said that the
Stockport-raised son of a Labour MP was born with a wooden spoon in his
mouth.
''It didn't help to have a heavy eh-bah-goom accent and a dad who was
storming the hustings as one of those dangerous new-fangled Labour and
Trade Union candidates. They didn't like me,'' he once declared.
Perry was virtually ostracised by the tennis establishment when he
dared to turn professional shortly after completing the third of his
centre court singles triumphs.
Frederick John Perry was born on May 18, 1909. He was 25-years-old
when he beat Australian Jack Crawford in 1934 to capture the first leg
of his Wimbledon triple crown.
The following year he beat German Baron, Gottfried Von Cramm, to
retain his title and completed the hat-trick in 1936, when he demolished
Von Cramm again -- 6-1 6-1 6-0 -- in a 40-minute final, the shortest
this century.
In his teens Perry flirted for a while with table tennis, becoming
world champion in 1929, before concentrating on tennis.
His game was built on his running forehand, fitness and stamina,
something he worked on tirelessly after losing a series of five-set
finals, training at Highbury with the then great Arsenal football team.
His hard work was rewarded not only by success at Wimbledon, but with
a hat-trick of US singles titles -- in 1933, 1934 and 1936 -- and one
each at the French (1935) and Australian (1934) championships.
In 1933 he clinched the decisive fifth match victory over Andre Merlin
to bring the Davis Cup back to Britain for the first time since 1911.
Perry joined the pioneer professional ranks at the age of 27 in the US
in 1936.
Newspaper headlines had it that Perry had swapped ''Glory for Gold'',
while Wimbledon showed its disapproval by withdrawing his honorary
membership and asking for the return of its tie.
Perry became a US citizen in 1939, served as a staff sergeant in the
US Army, owned a tennis club in Hollywood, and later became director and
professional coach at a Florida hotel.
He was married for the first time in 1935 to American actress Helen
Vinson, ''on a sudden impulse'', but they were divorced five years
later.
Subsequent marriages to fashion model Sandra Breaux and to Lorraine
Pidgeon, sister of actor Walter Pidgeon, ended in divorce after four and
six years respectively.
Perry finally found happiness with fourth wife Barbara ''Bobby''
Friedman, the sister of British actress Patricia Roc. They were married
in 1953 and had two children, Penny and David.
The festering wounds inflicted by the tennis establishment ran deep --
''I can still get angry when I think of the shabby way I was treated,''
he said recently -- but Perry still felt a great attachment to Britain
and kept a home in Rottingdean, Sussex. He was also a regular tennis
commentator for BBC radio.
Shortly before his death he admitted: ''If someone said, 'Fred, you've
got one more set left before you die', I would choose the Centre Court
at Wimbledon. That would be lovely.''

NEWS of a further drop in crime figures and an urgent cash crisis
which threatens police cover produced a bitter-sweet day for law
enforcement in Strathclyde yesterday.
While members of Strathclyde Regional Council's police and fire
committee were delighted to hear of a 5% reduction in crime last year,
they were alarmed when Chief Constable Leslie Sharp revealed a #750,000
gap in his current budget that would lead to his force being ''fully
stretched'' from now until the start of the new financial year in April.
The Chief Constable said: ''I just hope I don't get a series of
murders between now and the first of April because there's no way I can
react to them.''
The situation has arisen out of the latest pay settlement in which
inspectors and chief inspectors are no longer entitled to overtime,
although they have been given an enhanced pay award to compensate --
something in the region of #3600 per annum.
The argument is that the savings in overtime will off-set the salary
enhancement. However, it will take two years of operation to achieve the
level of savings required.
An anxious Chief Constable said: ''I'm left with #750,000 to find from
this year's current budget by the end of the financial year which is
rapidly coming upon us.
''We've been told to find that from our resources. We'll save it in
two years, but it doesn't help me in January 1995. The only option I've
got at this late stage of the financial year is to cut overtime. I'm
going to have to take policemen off the beat and use ordinary time for
things like policing football matches.''
Liberal Democrat member Keith Moody stated: ''We've been short-changed
by the Scottish Office.''
However, the Chief Constable said his forthcoming annual report would
show a further decline in the crime rate. He was particularly pleased
with the dramatic success rate in detecting housebreakings which he said
was due to Operation Turnkey.
He stated: ''In my next annual report you'll see that crime over the
year has dropped another 5% in 1994. There were over 14,000 fewer crimes
in Strathclyde last year than there were the year previously. This is
quite remarkable, because the previous year itself showed a 10.8%
reduction.''

<HEADLINE>Tax policy is solid, says Robertson</HEADLINE>

LABOUR moved yesterday to damp down any suggestion that its policy on
tax-raising powers for a Scottish parliament was being reopened for
debate.
The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, predicted that the
issue would not even be discussed at conference in Inverness next month.
He said the policy was absolutely solid and there was no pressure to
change it. It gives a Scottish parliament the power to raise or lower
income tax by up to 3p in the pound to supplement the block grant from
the Exchequer, and was agreed with the party's Liberal Democrat partners
on the Scottish Constitutional Convention.
Mr Robertson said that even if an amendment referring the question
back to the Scottish Labour Party's national policy forum for fresh
consideration was accepted, it was unlikely that the conference would
find time to debate it.
Scottish Labour Action, a strongly pro-home rule grouping, has been
pushing resolutions to conference stressing the party's commitment to a
parliament with strong economic powers.
This prompted one amendment, essentially more cautious, from Mr Jim
Stevens, an economist at the Fraser of Allender Institute and member of
the party's Scottish executive.
Mr Jim Wallace, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, welcomed Mr
Robertson's rejection of any softening on the issue. He felt the power
to set tax rates was essential for proper accountability. ''This is the
settled and strongly held view of the SLD and the agreed policy of the
Scottish Constitutional Convention.''
Mrs Margaret Ewing, the SNP's parliamentary leader, seized on Labour's
situation as evidence that its devolution scheme was ''unravelling
before our eyes''.
She said: ''After coming under scrutiny in England, the Labour
leadership is worried about reaction to their proposals for English
regional assemblies and could well be considering trimming and hedging
on the whole package, including the Scottish assembly.''
Labour's front-bench spokesman on constitutional change, Mr Kim
Howells, said that with Scotland having separate legal and educational
systems the Scottish parliament was bound to have a greater workload
than Welsh or English regional assemblies, and therefore required
different powers.
He denied the suggestion made in some quarters that as an
anti-devolutionist in the past he had been put in to slow the pace of
change this time.
He said: ''I deny that totally,'' but added: ''I have always been know
as someone who cannot abide nationalism and that is still my attitude. I
am not interested in creating statelets. I did not join the Labour Party
to Balkanise the United Kingdom.''

HE was master of the sinister sneer, an arch villain of the cinema
whose pale blue eyes could send shudders down the spine. But Donald
Pleasence was a much more substantial actor than any resume of his
celluloid career would suggest.
For some reason he never quite achieved the heights of his profession
in the theatre, in spite of the fact that in 1960 he created one of the
great roles of post-war drama, the malevolent tramp, Davies, in Harold
Pinter's play The Caretaker.
He was never a leading member of the National Theatre or the Royal
Shakespeare Theatre companies and, for that reason, some of the great
classic stage roles eluded him. This was in spite of the fact that the
quality of his theatre work in 1958 made him a star in the UK and on
Broadway where he won a Tony.
In the cinema, he created memorable villains, including one of James
Bond's most evil foes, Ernst Stavro Blofeld in You Only Live Twice, the
film which probably most people remember.
Oddly, he was a last minute addition to the cast after the Czech
actor, Jan Werich, fell ill. Written by Roald Dahl, it was the first
time Bond confronted the arch villain face to face.
Pleasence, who died yesterday at his home in France aged 75, was born
in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, where his father was a station master. He
started acting as a child and auditioned for the Royal Academy of
Dramatic Art when he left school, but was told to come back when he was
bigger. His size was always a factor in his career.
He turned instead to repertory, starting as an assistant stage manager
in 1939 at the Playhouse, Jersey, and made his first London appearance
three years later at the Arts theatre in Twelfth Night. He registered as
a conscientious objector, but ended up serving in the Royal Air Force
and flew 60 bomber missions over France until he was shot down in 1944,
spending the last year of the war in a German prison camp.
After the war he returned to the theatre and the usual round of
repertory companies in Bristol and Birmingham, at the Royal Court, and
Stratford. It was not until the end of the 1950s that he began to
achieve recognition.
Several small parts in British films, the first being The Beachcomber
in 1954, followed before he established himself as a notable screen
villain in 1962 as Dr Crippen opposite Coral Browne. His screen career
took off from there and he made over 130 films -- at one point in the
1970s he was making up to four a year.
His last film to go on release in Britain was Hour of the Pig, a
medieval drama in which he played a corrupt priest. His first Hollywood
film was The Great Escape, which starred Steve McQueen, made in 1963,
the same year in which he repeated the role of Davies in the screen
version of The Caretaker.
He starred in the first of the Hallowe'en films, made in 1978, as the
psychiatrist who solved the murders, and appeared in all the sequels
except Hallowe'en Three. He was doing post-production work on Hallowe'en
Six at the time of his death.
However, it would do him an injustice if he were remembered only for
roles like these, and certainly for that series, because it declined in
quality as each one appeared.
He denied being a film star, insisting, probably with some justice,
that he was a feature player who sometimes got star billing. As a
supporting player who could lend distinction to a film, he was second to
none.
His close friend, David Giles, who directed him in the BBC classic
series, The Barchester Chronicles, said he had been undervalued as an
actor, probably because his height was against him or because of the
fact he never played any of the great classic roles.
''He was a perfectionist,'' he said.
Some of his more notable films, none of them horror movies, were
Soldier Blue, Night of the Generals -- he specialised in rather nasty
Nazis -- Cul de Sac, The Black Windmill, and Woody Allen's Shadows and
Fog. On television he starred in many productions, including Blade on
the Feather, Witness for the Prosecution, and Scoop.
He repeated his role of Davies in the 1990 West End revival of the
play and reaffirmed that he had made it his own. In the London theatre
he also gave memorable performances in The Lark, The Rules of the Game,
The Man in the Glass Booth, Poor Bitos, and in New York in the
production of Wise Child.
He is survived by his fourth wife, Linda Woollan, and five daughters,
two from his first marriage, two from his second, and one from his
third. Three of them are actresses.

<HEADLINE>Axe set to fall on 15,000 tax jobs</HEADLINE>

ABOUT 15,000 tax jobs, at least 1000 of them in Scotland, are to be
cut over the next seven years.
They are the Inland Revenue's share of Government-demanded
efficiencies, expected to result in more than 50,000 job losses across
the Civil Service.
Already 10,000 revenue jobs have been shed over the past three years ,
some 500 of them in Scotland, where the revenue currently employees
around 4800. A further 500 Scottish jobs are expected to go in the next
wave of losses.
In a special announcement to the department's 54,000 staff, Inland
Revenue chairman Sir Anthony Battishill said yesterday that 6000 posts
would be cut over the next three years.
He said the aim, however, was to reduce the workforce to between
42,000 to 44,000 by the year 2002 and around 3000 other jobs could also
be axed from the revenue's valuation departments. Sir Anthony said: ''We
shall see a significantly smaller but increasingly efficient and
professional department.''
The union warned the measures would lead to a reduction in the amount
of taxes collected, although it was heartened by a Government decision
to restrict planned self-assessment to the self employed and higher-rate
tax payers and would not now be extended to the bulk of those on Pay As
You Earn.
This decision to retain the bulk of PAYE in-house will mean the
purchase of new computer software and safeguard many of the jobs at PAYE
offices including the new #24m Centre One in East Kilbride, which was
occupied only last month, and the London Provincial collection offices
in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Livingston.
Tax collectors, white collar staff, and middle managers are to bear
the brunt of the job losses, which will lead to huge savings for the
Government. Only 90 top rank jobs are believed to be involved.
Workers were told the job losses would mainly be achieved through
natural wastage and voluntary redundancy, although management refuses to
rule out compulsory lay-offs. There have been about 80 compulsory
redundancies to date.
The Inland Revenue Staff Federation, which represents tax workers,
said it was ''angry'' at the news especially as some #2000m of tax went
uncollected last year and that if redundant staff were diverted to
collection duties they could soon justify their existence by bringing in
additional revenue for the Treasury. Members might be balloted on
industrial action.
The federation general secretary, Mr Clive Brooke, met the Chancellor
on Wednesday to try to win a pledge of no compulsory redundancies, but
Mr Kenneth Clarke refused to give that guarantee.
Deputy general secretary Jim McAuslan said he believed the number of
jobs to go would top 15,000 over the next seven years through a
combination of efficiency improvements, market testing, and ''stripping
out'' an entire level of middle management.
Mr McAuslan said union members would now have to decide whether to
accept an agreement worked out between the IRSF and the Inland Revenue
to manage the cutbacks, or to take industrial action. An initial ballot
on the redundancies will be held later this month and could be followed
by a ballot for industrial action.
The Inland Revenue cuts come under the Fundamental Expenditure Review
being demanded of every Civil Service department. Under this process,
Civil Service manpower has fallen from 530,000 last year to about
500,000 and is expected to fall to about 475,000 over the next few
years.
Civil Service unions fear that without a Labour election victory their
numbers could plummet to as low as 50,000, with that core Civil Service
buying-in most of its services.
One Labour MP has already expressed concern about the possibility of
job losses in his constituency.
In a letter to Treasury Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken, the
Cumbernauld and Kilsyth MP, Mr Norman Hogg, said: ''I am informed that
there have been a number of innovations involving new technology and a
self-assessment scheme which could have a serious impact on employment
levels at Cumbernauld.
''It seems to me that at the very least, the Government should make
clear that there shall not be any compulsory redundancies as a result of
this announcement and that any efficiencies made should be redirected
into achieving compliance with the tax laws and even more effective tax
collection.''
Shadow Employment Secretary Harriet Harman said the huge job losses
would make worse the epidemic of insecurity at work which had swept
through the public sector as well as the private sector.
Labour claims the tax compliance efforts of the inspectors facing
redundancy are worth the equivalent of #9000m a year in revenue to the
Treasury. Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ''We'll be
working along with the Inland Revenue staff unions to impress upon
Government the folly of their actions in this case.''
* A Mori poll of IRSF members conducted last weekend showed that just
13% would now vote Conservative as opposed to 31% who cast their votes
for the Tories in the last election. Seventy-two per cent said they
would vote Labour.

IT might be a tiny facial blemish, barely visible to anyone else, but
for some people it can be a matter of life and death.
They are sufferers from Body Dysmorphic Disorder, a morbid obsession
with a trivial or even imaginary physical defect. According to
psychiatrist Anne Boocock, 16 out of a group of 43 patients she is
treating had attempted suicide.
Others become reclusive, their chances of employment, social life, or
romance blighted.
''The prevalence is not known but it is likely to be much more
widespread than realised,'' Dr Boocock told the Royal College of
Psychiatrists' winter meeting in Glasgow yesterday.
First identified in the last century, BDD is probably more common now
as a result of the perfectionist images portrayed, and often enhanced
with airbrushes or digital techniques, in the media.
''Sexual stereotyping also contributes to some women's obsession that
their breasts -- or, in the case of men, their genitals -- are too
small,'' she added.
Dr Boocock, who works in the Royal Free Hospital in London, said 70%
of the patients were entirely normal; where there was a defect at all,
it was well within the bounds of normality.
Dr Boocock and her colleagues are now conducting a trial of cognitive
therapy on some of their patients, many of whom had been driven to seek
the help of plastic and ENT surgeons or dermatologists. However, many
BDD sufferers were too embarrassed to seek the help of their GP, let
alone a psychiatrist.
What kind of person develops such an obsession? The average age of Dr
Boocock's patients was 33, but their problem had started at about 17;
most were female (77%) and single or separated (75%); and 42% were
unemployed.
Dr Boocock's group has now developed links with Changing Faces, an
organisation which helps people with genuine disfigurements, to find out
how they learn to cope with them.

COLLEAGUES of 14 South Yorkshire police officers who are to receive
compensation because of the effects of the Hillsborough stadium disaster
were said yesterday to be ''sickened'' at the pay-outs.
And relatives of the 96 soccer fans who died in the 1989 tragedy --
many of whom have still not received any compensation -- expressed
disgustat the cash awards for the trauma the officers had suffered.
Lawyers for the Municipal Mutual Insurance Company have conceded
liability in 14 out of a total of 34 cases being brought by the Police
Federation, and out-of-court settlements are to be negotiated.
But both sides yesterday dismissed as ''completely speculative''
claims that compensation would range from #10,000 to #250,000, saying
that talks on the size of payments had not yet begun.
The insurance company, which covers all three defendants in the case
-- South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and its
engineers Eastwood and Partners -- has conceded liability in the cases
of 14 officers who went into the pens of the Lepping Lane terrace in the
aftermath of the crush, hauling out the dead and injured.
Another 23 cases, on behalf of officers who did not go into the pens,
are to be contested at the High Court in Sheffield on March 27.
Confirming the settlement yesterday, Gillian Radcliffe, head of press
and public relations for South Yorkshire Police, said: ''It is
understandable that relatives and other people on Merseyside will be
shocked by this development.
''Many members of the South Yorkshire Police service are equally
shocked. I've had quite a lot of calls from officers who were part of
the disaster and haven't felt it necessary to make claims, and the words
they have used are that they are sickened.
''There were hundreds of officers involved in the rescue and those
pursuing these actions are a tiny minority. A lot of them have retired
as a result of the stress and their main aim is to get compensation for
the loss of earnings from losing their jobs.''
Mrs Anne Williams, whose 15-year-old son Kevin died in the disaster,
said she was ''disgusted'' at the development.
''Lord Justice Taylor blamed the police because they lost control --
my son died because they lost control,'' she said.
''Now they are getting compensation for post-traumatic stress
disorder. What about the poor families? We've lost our children and they
don't seem to care about us.''
Mr Trevor Hicks, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group
which represents over half the families, said the decision represented a
''double standard''. He lost his two teenage daughters in the tragedy,
and has received no compensation and is heavily out of pocket on legal
expenses.

A DRUGS wholesaler licensed by the Home Office was in jail last night
after a jury convicted him of supplying the Scottish black market with
#5m worth of the drug Temazepam.
Sundeep Amin, 36, a recently-discharged bankrupt, flooded Scotland
with 3.8 million capsules of the drug which he had bought legitimately
for #94,000 over an eight-month period in 1993.
The court was told that the prescription-only Class C drug was
legitimately prescribed to relieve anxiety, to aid sleep and in the
treatment of epilepsy.
But drug abusers risked their health by taking massive doses in
capsules or injection form.
Temazepam is widely abused in Scotland and is fast becoming a major
problem in the rest of Britain.
Amin, of Welbeck Close, New Malden, Surrey, denied conspiracy to
supply the drug but a jury at Kingston Crown Court found him guilty.
Adjourning sentence until March 17, Judge John Bishop refused to renew
bail and remanded him in custody.
Mr Andrew Colman, prosecuting, said that after Amin bought the
Temazepam from three legitimate sources the capsules were taken to
Scotland where they were sold on the streets for between #1 and #3 each.
Mr Colman, who described Amin as a wholesale chemist, said the
defendant produced fake documents to show that he had sold the drugs to
a small chemist in West Kensington, London. But the chemist had never
heard of Amin or his company.
Amin did not give evidence but his barrister, Mr Barry Gilbert, told
the jury: ''There is not an iota of proof that the drugs went to
Scotland.''
He suggested the drugs were sold for use abroad and that Amin tried to
conceal this fact because he felt he might be acting illegally.

SCIENTISTS now doubt claims that transfatty acids found in margarine
are linked to heart disease. Two studies published in The Lancet found
heart disease victims did not have higher levels of these acids in their
tissue, compared with healthy individuals. Fears about the
factory-produced fats made with vegetable and fish oils were raised two
years ago after research involving American women showed a strong
association with coronary problems. New research carried out in eight
European countries and Israel showed no difference between levels of
transfatty acid in 671 men who had suffered a heart attack and 717
healthy men.

A MAN was yesterday cleared at the High Court in Inverness of
assaulting a 16-year-old girl with intent to rape in Macduff last
October. Ian Elkins, 26, a labourer, of Clergy Street, Macduff, said he
had followed the girl and grabbed her but only to give her a warning
because he thought she was the friend of a family causing him trouble.
Elkins was found guilty of simple assault by seizing the girl, pushing
and pulling her, and punching her on the head. Advocate-depute Iain
Bonomy did not move for sentence and Lord MacLean set Elkins free after
hearing he had been in custody since October 22.

AN Aberdeen District councillor last night claimed he had been forced
out of local government by draconian regulations.
Councillor Malcolm Savidge, convener of the finance and general
purposes committee, said he had reluctantly decided to withdraw from
seeking election to the new unitary authority in April.
He is a school teacher and under Government regulations council
employees cannot stand for election for the authority which employs
them.
He said he believed that the Government regulations, which also
covered school janitors, cleaners, carers, and home helps, deprived the
community of the opportunity of electing people with a wide range of
experience.
He said: ''Local government employees are being barred from standing
for office, while there is a bizarre contrast to enterprise boards with
Tory friends and backers being given places in the quangos.''

A #7m development in the heart of Aberdeen which is attracting the
attention of international fashion shops like Armani and Versace could
be open by the middle of next year.
Property developers Jarlaw has unveiled plans for The Academy
development, based in a former school in Aberdeen's Belmont Street area.
If planning permission is granted in the spring, work will start on
the first phase of the development almost immediately and may be
completed within a year.
''The proposal will assist to reinforce Aberdeen as the major shopping
centre for the North-east,'' said Mr Charlie Ferrari, managing director
of Jarlaw.
The Academy is intended to offer Aberdeen shopping of the quality of
Princes Square and the Italian Centre in Glasgow.
As well as shops the development, which includes a courtyard and a
piazza, will have quality licensed bars and restaurants as well as
living accommodation.
Meanwhile, a plan to build a #3.5m supermarket on Skye creating about
50 jobs has been lodged with Highland Regional Council.
The Scottish Co-op is seeking outline planning approval for a 20,000sq
ft supermarket at Druim-na-Pairc, Dunvegan Road, Portree, about 400
yards from its existing premises.
The new store will be virtually double the size of the existing Co-op
store and have parking for 200 vehicles.
The store could open within a year of planning consent being approved
and the firm's current 55 employees would be transferred to the new
store.
The proposal is part of the Scottish Co-op's multi-million pound
development programme which includes a #4.5m Co-op in Stornoway and a
#2m store in Arran.
The proposals are being opposed by local shopkeepers, who believe the
development would kill the village community. Mr Douglas MacKenzie, a
baker in Portree, said, at time when the Government was restricting out
of town developments, it would be suprising if planners allowed it to go
ahead.

A MINISTER who teaches religious education was yesterday cleared at
Elgin Sheriff Court of assaulting a pupil in his class.
The Rev James Scott accused the 12-year-old girl of telling lies in
court in an attempt to convict him. He also said he suspected the girl
had bruised her own arm, then blamed the mark on him.
Outside the court, Mr Scott, who teaches in Morayshire, said: ''Some
of us have crosses to bear. This has been my particular cross.''
Mr Scott, a full-time teacher, said he had restrained the girl to stop
her hitting another pupil. He insisted he had used minimum force and
denied striking her.
Mr Scott, 46, of Morriston Road, Elgin, was acquitted at the end of a
two-day trial.
The girl told an earlier sitting Mr Scott had struck her without
warning while they were watching a video during a music lesson last
September.
She claimed she had been speaking to a classmate but had ended the
conversation before she was struck.
She said she had been aware of the teacher behind her and then felt a
pain in her arm. The girl also said that later, when she had gone to
basketball practice, she noticed a large red bruise on her upper arm.
In his evidence yesterday, Mr Scott, who has been suspended since the
allegations surfaced last September, told the court he had been
principal teacher of education since 1980.
Asked by defence agent Ian Cruickshank if he had ever struck a pupil
during his time as a teacher, he replied: ''No.''
Mr Scott told the court that on the day in question the girl was being
aggressive towards a boy. Asked by Mr Cruickshank what he had done to
intervene, he replied: ''I put my left arm on her upper arm.''
Mr Cruickshank asked: ''Would you regard it as a blow?'' He replied:
''Certainly not. No-one in that classroom could have regarded it as a
blow.''
Sheriff Donald Booker Millburn told Mr Scott: ''I do not consider that
the crown has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. You are found not
guilty and you are free to go.''
A spokesman for Grampian Regional Council said Mr Scott would remain
suspended from his post, adding: ''A disciplinary investigation, which
was taking place, was suspended when Mr Scott was charged by the police
in connection with the alleged incident.
''That investigation has still to be concluded and Mr Scott will
remain suspended from duty meantime.''
At the resumption of the trial, procurator-fiscal James McKay drew the
sheriff's attention to an article in The Herald published on January 13
which carried a photograph of the accused while the trial was
continuing.
Sheriff Booker-Millburn agreed that identification of the accused had
not been an issue, but said the editor of The Herald should be asked to
come and explain his position on what was a possible contempt of court.

RAILTRACK Scotland, ScotRail, and the Scottish tourist industry have
less than two weeks to save one of Scotland's most celebrated summer
tourist attractions -- the steam trains between Fort William and Mallaig
-- the service's incoming owner warned last night.
Mr Peter Waterman, owner of Waterman Railways, criticised ScotRail and
Railtrack Scotland for failing to include him in discussions on the
future of the service. He called for a concerted effort to keep the
loss-making trains running under privatisation. His company is due to
take over British Rail's Special Trains Unit, which runs the steam
trains on the West Highland Line, on April 1.
Mr Waterman denied he intended to drop the service. ''There is
skullduggery going on here. We are accused of wanting to abandon the
service but no such decision has been made. And no-one from Scotland has
met with us,'' he said.
He said he was not prepared to subsidise the service, which costs
#4600 a day to run but only has a daily income of #2800. ''There's no
way we could subsidise steam in Scotland. We would put ourselves out of
business.''
Mr Waterman, a succesful record producer whose great grandfather was a
McDonald and a train driver, called for a partnership with tourist
boards, local authorities, and ScotRail. He said: ''All it takes is for
all parties to have the will to run steam in Scotland. If we all get
together, we are quite convinced there would be a way of doing this.''
Railtrack Scotland has rejected Mr Waterman's claims that the track
access charges to run the trains would be exorbitant. Figures show they
would be less than 10% -- #565 -- of the daily running cost.
Meanwhile, Lochaber councillor Dr Michael Foxley told yesterday's
meeting of Highland Regional Council's roads and transport committee
that the time for talking about rail privatisation was past and direct
action must be taken if the service was to be maintained.
He claimed the figures used to justify the withdrawal of the summer
steam trains on the Mallaig line were totally false.
''These trains have been 75% full every year for just about every day
they are run. This is all part of the fragmentation process going on to
make each unit look unprofitable and then to close it down. We have to
start a massive campaign now. Otherwise, we'll be sitting here listening
to reports for ever.''
Edinburgh District Council leaders yesterday agreed to write to all
the city's MPs and to Transport Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney to protest
about the threatened loss of some sleeper and Motorail services to
Scotland as a result of privatisation.

THE Rail Regulator might step in to save the Scottish Motorail and
sleeper services threatened with closure under privatisation, because
their future was decided without public consultation, the Liberal
Democrats claimed last night.
Mr John Swift, QC, told a delegation, led by Mr Charles Kennedy, MP
for Ross, Cromarty, and Skye, that it was still not too late to save the
services, which depend on a #3m annual subsidy.
Last December Mr Roger Salmon, the railway Franchising Director,
announced that Motorail and the Fort William sleeper would not be
included in the list of services to be provided under privatisation.
According to Mr Kennedy, Mr Swift told the MPs that he believed Mr
Salmon's announcement might have amounted to a procedural irregularity,
because it failed to allow for the public consultation called for under
the privatisation legislation.
The Rail Users' Consultative Committee has complained that it was not
given a chance to examine the issue before the decision was announced,
and has called for the Government to intervene.
Critics of privatisation have pointed out that while there was no
consultation on Motorail and the sleepers in Scotland, Mr Salmon has
announced a wide-ranging consultation exercise on the requirements for
four English franchises announced earlier this week.
Mr Kennedy said he would seek meetings with Mr Salmon and Railtrack to
discuss the future of the services. ''There is a prima facie case to say
that Mr Salmon has breached his own guidelines in pre-empting the
consultation process.''

<TEXT>
A JEALOUS husband who set fire to his wife because she planned to
leave him was jailed for 10 years yesterday.
Leslie Beattie, 35, was found guilty of two charges of committing
arson with intent to endanger life but was cleared of a charge of
attempted murder at Durham Crown Court.
His wife, Michelle Beattie, has to wear a surgical mask 23 hours a day
to cover her facial injuries and will require years of plastic surgery
following the fire at her home in Taunton Place, Cramlington,
Northumberland, in December 1993.
Mrs Beattie was set ablaze when a policeman, Mr George Hall,
confronted her husband in a petrol-soaked bedroom.
The court heard how Beattie, before starting the fire with the flick
of a lighter, was upset that his wife planned to leave him and told her:
''If I can't have you, no one else can.''
Mr Justice Laws told Beattie he had committed ''terrible crimes'',
although he accepted his actions had not been long premeditated, but
added: ''You must have known it was inevitable that very great injury
would be caused.''
The Judge said that imprisonment was the only sentence which could be
justified, but accepted that Beattie had been of good character
previously and that at the time of the incident he was in an emotional
state because of his marriage problems.
The Judge earlier said Beattie had not shown much remorse while giving
evidence, but Mr Stephen Williamson, QC, defending, explained Beattie
had been taking anti-depressant tablets during the trial.
Mr Williamson told the court that Beattie himself had been left
scarred by the fire -- when shown photographs of the full extent of his
wife's injuries Beattie, he claimed, had been ''devastated'' by what he
saw.
During the four-day trial, the jury heard that Mrs Beattie, who has a
young daughter, had intercourse with an office colleague while her
husband was on holiday alone in Tenerife just before Christmas 1993.
When Beattie gave evidence he said he had not meant to start the fire.
He claimed he had been trying to bring about a siege situation to draw
attention to the hurt he was feeling. He said the fire had been started
in his struggle with police called to the house.
Mrs Beattie, 31, told the court: ''I felt myself ignite -- my whole
body just ablaze, just on fire. I knew I was on fire -- I could feel
myself burning.''
She managed to stagger from the room and rolled on a duvet to smother
the flames. However she was so badly injured she spent over three months
in hospital, five weeks of that on a life-support machine and was close
to death several times.
PC Hall told the court he had tried to pin Beattie's arms to his sides
and was trying to force him out of the room when the fire had suddenly
erupted.
Mr Hall was also badly burnt and was off work for 10 weeks recovering
from injuries to his face, hands and back.
The Judge commended PC Hall and two other officers called to the
incident, constables Gary Coates and Frank Clarke, for their actions.

PROTESTERS against the M77 extension through the south side of Glasgow
claimed victory last night in the first day of serious skirmishing with
Wimpey, the construction company responsible for building the #53.6m
road.
Around 40 activists, working under the banner of environmental direct
action group Earth First!, stopped the company's sub-contractors
clearing an area of woodland, known locally as ''Pollok Castle'', near
the B769 Stewarton Road at the Newton Mearns end of the proposed
six-mile extension. The motorway will link the A77 at Malletsheugh with
the M77 at the Haggs Castle roundabout.
The protesters chained themselves to tree fellers' equipment,
vehicles, and to the tree fellers themselves, in order to halt the work,
which began two days ago.
They also dumped logs and branches from some of the 150 trees cut down
so far in a nearby Wimpey showhouse development.
Last night a Wimpey spokesman said two other crews of foresters had
been able to work at other sites unmolested by the protesters, but
admitted that playing ''cat and mouse'' with them was only a short-term
solution to an intractable problem.
''We will now be reconsidering the way we go about this contract,
particularly in terms of our approach to dealing with the protesters,''
he said.
Wimpey has engaged the security firm Securiguard to protect the
project, and yesterday around a dozen guards were quickly on the scene.
Protesters claimed yesterday they had been alerted by a source within
Wimpey that the work had started, six miles from the Pollok Estate
encampment they have set up.
They rushed to the site early yesterday morning to set up a second
camp, spiking trees with six inch nails to delay further clearing work.
When staff from Barrhead contractor John Meikle arrived at 8am, they
found themselves confronted by the protestors, who claimed they had
caught Wimpey in the act of trying to outflank them.
Protester Jake Hunter said yesterday: ''The company has gone to great
length and expense to try and appear as though they're consulting
people, and have tried to develop a relationship with us.
''All that trust's gone out the window with these sneaky and underhand
tactics. Now we'll be really gunning for them, and will man both camps
continuously.''
Police were not involved in yesterday's events but said they were
continuing to monitor the situation.
Meanwhile, the tree fellers' employer, Mr John Meikle, spoke last
night of his anger at the protesters' action.
''My men only want to do a job. People have chained themselves to my
men, stolen the keys from our van and let our tyres down. Why should
these people be allowed to interfere with our business?''
The protesters were also costing more than 20 foresters work, Mr
Meikle claimed: ''I have men standing by who want to work, who need the
money and they're not being allowed to earn a wage.''
As the main contractors, Wimpey is believed to be footing the bill for
paying any costs incurred by sub-contractors as a result of the
protesters' action.
The protest will also continue via other channels, Mr Ian Bogle of the
pressure group Glasgow for People said last night.
One of these will be contacting residents of Newton Mearns. However,
as one man who stopped to talk to protestors proved, this may not be
successful.
Mr Ronald Harris, who lives in Greenfern Estate, said: ''I think the
M77's a wonderful idea, and whilst I appreciate their arguments, there
are hundreds of us who need it to happen.''

EXCLUSIVE
By IAIN WILSON
Chief Reporter
THE director of ScotRail has accused Railtrack of treating his
customers on the North Berwick to Edinburgh route as second-class
citizens.
Railtrack, responsible for providing train operators with access to
the line, is giving priority to InterCity services on the east coast
main line, which means that ScotRail's passengers are subjected to
lengthy delays regardless of timetables.
Director Chris Green, in a letter to Mr John Home Robertson, Labour MP
for East Lothian, spoke of his exasperation at passengers being ''badly
inconvenienced''.
He had ''remonstrated very firmly with Railtrack'' and would be happy
to meet the MP to discuss an issue which had led to a ''very sharp
deterioration'' in performance.
In a separate letter to a commuter, Mr Green said: ''I share your
infuriation at the totally unacceptable performance of the North Berwick
route.''
Mr Green said Railtrack's huge backlog of track engineering between
Edinburgh and Drem was the prime reason for ScotRail's unreliable
services.
''I have some sympathy with Railtrack's predicament,'' he wrote, ''but
not with their decision to give total priority to the InterCity trains
on the route under any circumstances.
''Railtrack believe the track position will be largely resolved by the
end of March, and I am determined that you cease to be treated as
second-class citizens from that date.''
His central thrust is that ScotRail has no direct control of
infrastructure problems because Railtrack took over that responsibility
in the run-up to privatisation.
The language in both letters is extraordinarily strong, given the
gagging order recently imposed by the British Railways Board in the wake
of his bleak assessment of ScotRail's fate on privatisation in an
article in The Herald.
Mr Home Robertson claimed Railtrack was giving priority to InterCity
because the Tories wanted to clear the way for the east coast line's
flagship privatisation.
He had received numerous complaints from constituents who used
ScotRail trains on the line. He said they could be forced to wait 30
minutes or more until InterCity services were clear.
He said: ''I am delighted at Mr Green's robust defence of the North
Berwick route, and will be pleased to discuss matters with him.
''The Government wants the best possible performances from InterCity.
But a point of principle is involved, with Railtrack dictating services.
Signalling staff should not be told to let InterCity through at all
costs. Services should be taken on their merits.''
The party's industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, said: ''This kind of
conflict has not previously arisen because one organisation provided an
integrated public service. Now we are left with a collection of rival,
feuding factions.''
A Railtrack spokesman denied that privatisation or political concerns
were being taken into account.
He said BR regulations, even before Railtrack was created, stated that
fast trains always had to take precedence on lines, and added: ''The
faster the train, the more reason for it to go first rather than behind
a slow train.'' Railtrack proposes talks with ScotRail in a bid to
resolve complaints.

THE Foreign Secretary is to be pressed by Mr Yaqub Ali, a millionaire
businessman and ardent Conservative supporter, when he arrives in
Glasgow tonight about the Government's lack of support for the people of
Kashmir.
Mr Ali, owner of Castle Cash and Carry in Glasgow and chairman of the
Tory support group Focus on Scotland, says that he is disappointed at
the lack of support the British Government has given to the people of
Kashmir who are fighting for their independence from India.
It has been claimed that 11,000 people have died in the past year in
fighting with Indian forces, with many thousands unfairly detained, and
more than 5000 women raped.
Mr Douglas Hurd is having a private meeting with Conservative fund
raisers in a city hotel tonight, and Mr Ali says he will use the
occasion to raise the plight of the Kashmiris with him.
''I am going to put him in a corner as much as I can,'' Mr Ali said
yesterday.

GOVERNMENT action over council borrowing has blown a #40m hole in
Edinburgh's ecomomic future, the capital's Labour leaders warned
yesterday.
They claimed that with a single stroke Scottish Secretary Ian Lang had
signed away a great deal of Edinburgh's chances of economic growth.
The council has made substantial use of a loophole, which is now to be
closed, involving the use of notional capital receipts from the lease of
land to augment its capital building programme.
Labour leader Councillor Lesley Hinds said the full extent of the
damage this would do to the city's investment plans had only now been
calculated.
The four-year capital programme to invest in buildings and facilities
which the council had prepared for the years until 1999 would have to be
reduced by 70% or #40m from the projected figure of #57m.
The council is to urge Mr Lang to postpone the implementation date for
the changes from April to July, a move which it claims would save much
of next year's programme by allowing them completion of current
transactions.
In addition, Edinburgh is to ask for a major increase in its formal
capital borrowing consent for 1995-96.

LOCAL government leaders have agreed salaries of between #58,000 and
#96,000 for the chief executives of the new single tier councils being
established in Scotland.
The agreement, between Cosla and the trade unions, allows for a range
of salaries from the largest for Glasgow to the smallest for
Clackmannan.
The pay of chief executives in the three islands councils, which are
not being reorganised, will remain at #58,000.
The salary levels are based largely on the population and projected
budgets of the 32 unitary authorities.
Details of the agreement will be passed to the Local Government Staff
Commission and advertisements for the posts are expected to appear later
this month.
Elections to the 29 new mainland councils take place on April 6 and
the new structure will become fully operational a year later.
Under the new structure, no official will earn as much as Strathclyde
region's present chief executive who has a salary of #111,000.
The chief executive of the new Edinburgh City Council will earn
#93,000, about the same as the present Lothian regional chief executive.
Mr Mark Irvine, head of Local Government in Scotland for the public
services union Unison, said yesterday that the agreement reached with
the Scottish employers was the first step in the process of making
senior appointments in the new unitary councils.
He explained that the agreement would be reviewed next year, to ensure
that future salaries reflected accurately the duties carried out by
chief executives and other chief officers, once reorganisation had taken
place.
Mr Irvine warned that there was a great deal more to be done to
protect the interests of Scotland's 300,000 council staff.
But, he said the agreement represented a good start and set the
standard for future discussions with the employers.

A BANK manager pocketed used bank notes instead of burning them, it
was claimed at the High Court in Glasgow yesterday.
Mr Hector MacGillivray, 54, is alleged to have helped himself three
times a week from bags of notes waiting to be incinerated.
A police officer claimed that Mr MacGillivray had confessed during a
tape-recorded interview that he had been stealing the money for 20
years.
He ''shocked'' detectives with his sudden confession as they
investigated another theft at the Clydesdale Bank in Glasgow, it was
claimed.
Mr MacGillivray, of Thomson Drive, Bearsden, was said to have admitted
to police to taking around #600 a week from the bank's ''burning boxes''
in Glasgow.
Detective Sergeant Robert Mullarkey, told the court Mr MacGillivray
had admitted in the taped interview taking about #18,000 a year.
Mr MacGillivray denies embezzling an estimated #163,200 between
January 1, l972 and November 30, l992, at the bank's premises in
Glasogow.
Sergeant Mullarkey told Advocate-depute Mrs Valerie Stacey that
#40,000 in cash and #3000 in foreign currency was stolen from the bank.
More than 60 bank staff were interviewed by detectives and finally Mr
MacGillivray was interviewed.
He told police he knew nothing of the missing money.
Sergeant Mullarkey said he asked him if he knew of any other thefts
taking place in the bank and he replied: ''Yes, I have.''
Sergeant Mullarkey told Lord Prosser and the jury: ''I got an initial
shock. He repeated, 'I have been taking money.' ''
Mrs Stacey said another person had since been charged in connection
with the missing #40,000.
During a tape-recorded interview played to the jury it is alleged that
Mr MacGillivray told how he had been in charge of the bank's cash
burning centre in the city and had started by taking small amounts --
#10, #20, and #30, but later took about #600 a week.
It is alleged he said: ''I removed the money from the burning boxes
three times a week. It was of all denominations from #l to #100 notes.''
During the interview it is claimed Mr MacGillivray explained to
Sergeant Mullarkey how the burning boxes were filled with bags of old
notes and put in his safe.
Later they were taken out and incinerated. It is alleged that before
that happened Mr MacGillivray had helped himself from the bags.
On the tape Sergeant Mullarkey is heard asking: ''No-one checks the
checker?'' Reply: ''Correct.''
Sergeant Mullarkey: ''It appeared a fullproof scheme because there was
no documentation?''''Yes.''
Mr MacGillivray is claimed to have said there had been nothing
dramatic happening in his life to make him steal the money. He had
bought ''nothing of a substantial nature'' with the money, although he
deposited some of it in bank and building society accounts, he is
alleged to have said.
Mr MacGillivray worked for the bank as a teller in Rothesay,
Skelmorlie and Greenock before being promoted to head office in Glasgow.
The trial continues.

EXCLUSIVE
By IAIN WILSON
Chief Reporter
A COMPUTER error has led to thousands of young people being overtaxed
for months after starting work for the first time, with the global sum
reputedly running into millions of pounds.
Until today, many of the victims will not even be aware they are due
refunds for needlessly paying tax.
The fault was uncovered only through an odd set of circumstances -- a
financial expert trawled his daughter's tax demands after she found a
job and had stopped claiming benefit.
Several more ''teething problems'' exist within the Employment
Services Agency computer, the largest non-military system in Europe and
subjected to programming updates for the last two years.
An ESA spokesman last night denied the other problems may have serious
implications for an even wider range of taxpayers.
The original blunder has been exposed by Mr Thomas Docherty, a
taxation lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University.
He had questioned why his daughter Caroline should pay tax immediately
after finding work. The Inland Revenue has now ordered the ESA to alter
its computer programme ''as a matter of priority''.
Mr Docherty said yesterday: ''No-one else seemed to have picked up the
error, affecting a vulnerable section of the community with little or no
access to advice or help. You would probably have to be an accountant
with a son or daughter on income support to know something was wrong.''
His daughter, on graduating from Glasgow University last June, claimed
benefit until taking up a librarian's post in October -- accumulating
tax allowances on the way.
This meant that no deductions should have been made on earnings for at
least a few months. Her complaint led to more than #100 being refunded.
But many other former students in a similar position are still losing
money which is rightfully theirs.
An Inland Revenue investigation blames the ESA for wrongly programming
a computer to issue emergency code numbers to people who stopped
claiming unemployment benefit or income support after getting jobs.
In a letter to Mr Docherty, the Inland Revenue's head of operational
systems and support added that the fault was one of ''several teething
problems'' in the computer.
He estimates that people on income support who started work last
October, earning #8400-a-year -- #161-a-week -- will have wrongly paid
#270 in tax by December alone.
He stressed that the Inland Revenue was blameless and were to be
congratulated for speedily reacting to his complaint that no tax should
have been deducted until gross pay exceeded tax-free alowances.
However, Mr Docherty added: ''It is a serious cause for concern that
the error, built into the ESA system, had not been picked up by anyone
-- and has resulted in presumably thousands of youngsters being
overtaxed for a number of months.''
The Inland Revenue last night described the ESA errors as unfortunate,
but insisted they would have been revealed when tax records are checked
in April, the financial year's end. An official said: ''No-one need wait
until then to seek a refund. They can approach us at any time.''
A spokesman for the ESA, whose main job is to find work for the
unemployed but also issues benefit payments, said steps are being taken
to assess how a number of computer ''problems and difficulties'' can be
resolved.
Action on overcoming the fault affecting students who had started work
also was underway. The numbers involved were not known.
* Mr Docherty advised anyone coming off income support to carefully
check if their P45 shows a Week 1 (emergency) code number. If it does,
they should go to the ESA and ''insist on being given a correct code
number''. Only after the change should the P45 be given to employers.

A QC who sits as a part-time judge was yesterday suspended from
practice for three months after a Bar disciplinary tribunal found him
guilty of sexually harassing a client and a solicitor's clerk.
Mr Nigel Hamilton, 57, a member of the Bar's ruling General Council,
had ''smacked the backside'' of the defendant and ''touched the
backside'' of the clerk employed by the defendant's solicitors, the
tribunal found.
He also made indecent remarks to both women.
The decision of the Council of the Inns of Court was announced nearly
a month after its disciplinary body had found him guilty of two charges
of ''conduct discreditable to a barrister''.
The suspension would take effect from yesterday after a period during
which Mr Hamilton could have given notice of an appeal but did not do
so, the Council said.
Mr Hamilton was also ordered to pay #400 costs.
The tribunal, chaired by Mr Justice Morison, gave brief particulars of
the behaviour which had led to the two charges.
It occurred during the trial of the female defendant in an unnamed
Crown Court between September 16 and October 20, 1992.
Mr Hamilton, married with two grown-up sons, was a schoolmaster before
being called to the Bar in 1965.
He was appointed to the General Council in 1989.
He is a former Conservative member of Avon County Council and lives in
the village of Compton Martin, Avon. He has chambers in London and
Bristol.
Yesterday's statement said Mr Hamilton had faced four charges, but did
not give details of the two remaining charges.
A Bar spokesman said: ''The role of the Bar Council in matters such as
this is to prosecute cases where counsel's conduct discloses a prima
facie case of professional misconduct.
''The Bar Council considers sexual harassment a serious breach of its
code of conduct.
''We cannot, however, comment on the sentence imposed by the
disciplinary tribunal.''
The Lord Chancellor is to consider whether to withdraw Mr Hamilton's
authorisation to sit as assistant recorder, the Lord Chancellor's office
said yesterday.

THE Prince of Wales proved himself an expert barman yesterday when he
pulled a perfect pint during a tour of a brewery.
Not known for his beer drinking, the Prince won praise for his
bartending skills at Fuller's Brewery in Chiswick, west London, which he
visited to mark its 150th anniversary.
The Prince, whose favourite tipple is Martini, sipped his pint of
Fuller's London Pride and admitted it tasted ''very strong''.
Tim and Frank Gale, bar staff whose family have contributed nearly 300
years of service to the brewery, said that the Prince admitted he was
not a beer connoisseur.
Tim Gale, 78, said: ''The Prince, pulled a great pint -- one long pull
and then a short one to give it its head. He said he was not an expert
but he liked the taste even though he said it tasted very strong.''
His brother, Frank, 68, added: ''He must have a bar of his own at home
-- he's a bit of an expert -- or perhaps he's done it before on other
visits to breweries.''
Earlier, the Prince helped to create a special celebratory bitter for
the brewery by pouring some Kent hops into a brewing vessel.
The 1845 Ale in bottles is being brewed to an ancient recipe, found in
old books from the time the Fuller's brewery was set up.
Beer has been brewed on the Chiswick site for more than 325 years --
since the time of Oliver Cromwell -- and the present company was formed
by an amalgamation of brewers 150 years ago.
The Prince spent more than an hour touring the plant, inspecting the
laboratories, and viewing the bottling process.
In the brewery's bar, he was applauded by employees as he pulled the
pint and unveiled a plaque recording his visit.
He asked Mr Anthony Fuller, the brewery chairman, if all those present
were going to get a beer ''on the house''. Mr Fuller said employees had
drawn lots to be in the bar and the beer was free.
He also assured the Prince that he would be sent him a crate of the
1845 Ale as soon as it was ready.

A CONTROVERSIAL dance show, featuring filmed interviews with dying
people, is to run at the Edinburgh International Festival this summer.
Still/Here, produced by the American choreographer Bill T Jones, has
provoked a heated debate in the US with one eminent critic refusing to
review the show, labelling it ''victim art''.
The work involves dancers performing against a backdrop of large
screens on which are shown a number of patients discussing their
situations and emotions. All are terminally ill, some with Aids.
Jones, who is HIV positive and whose partner, dancer Arnie Zane, died
of Aids, appeared at the Edinburgh Festival in 1993, when his company
played to large audiences at the King's Theatre.
Still/Here is understood to have been booked for a three-night slot in
August at the Playhouse Theatre.
However, Edinburgh Councillor Christine Richard said last night that,
after reading about the production in a magazine, she had serious
misgivings about its inclusion in the festival.
''The festival is, by its very nature, a celebration of what is best
in theatre, opera, and dance. I find it very distasteful and rather
prurient that someone is making art or entertainment out of suffering.
''I think that, by using real people who are terminally ill, it
crosses the divide between art and exploitation. I can't imagine who
will want to see this show.''
Mrs Richard, a former Tory group leader on the council, admitted she
had not seen the performance and said she did not want to act as a
censor. She has discussed the show with festival director Mr Brian
McMaster and said she would be contacting Lord Provost Norman Irons, who
chairs the festival society board.
Mr McMaster yesterday defended the production and said its artistic
merits made it appropriate for the festival. He said: ''I saw it last
year. I didn't find it harrowing and I chose it because of its
quality.''
Mary Brennan, dance critic of The Herald, said: ''Jones is a
formidable talent. He makes dance that is fast, energetic, athletic --
very exciting to watch and yet full of recognisable emotions and
conflicts.''

Nicosia, Thursday
IRANIANS can win gold coins for short stories capturing the ''moments
of fear and anxiety'' of British author Salman Rushdie when he learned
the ayatollahs wanted him killed.
The Islamic Propagation Organisation, an Iranian quango, has announced
the competition this month, the sixth anniversary of the death edict
issued against Indian-born Rushdie by Tehran's late Ayatollah Khomeini
over the novel The Satanic Verses. Khomeini claimed Rushdie's book
blasphemed Islam.
The IPO is offering 10 gold coins for the best effort, five for the
second best, three for the third, and one apiece for seven runners up,
the IRNA news agency said.
''According to his own confession he (Rushdie) cannot leave his
residence without permission,'' IRNA gloated in the broadcast, monitored
in Cyprus.
A semi-official organisation, Khordad 15, has placed a bounty
exceeding #1m plus expenses for anyone who kills Rushdie.
Another Iranian organisation in 1993 offered gold coins worth about
#10,000 for the best caricatures of Rushdie, who has lived under tight
security since the death threat was issued but makes unannounced public
appearances and continues to write.--AP/Reuter.

Geneva, Thursday
A UNITED Nations human rights investigator called on Burma immediately
to release dissident Aung San Suu Kyi and to stop its soldiers and
prison guards from committing killings and torture.
He also urged the ruling military junta, which took power in 1988, to
complete drafting of a constitution, hold promised free elections, and
allow a civilian government to be formed.
Yozo Yokota, special reporter to the UN Human Rights Commission,
echoed recent criticism of Burma's record by the US State Department and
London-based Amnesty International.
Yokota said Burmese Ministers had denied him access to Suu Kyi, the
1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner now in her sixth year of house arrest,
during his visit in November.
''With respect to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the government should release
her immediately and unconditionally,'' he reported.
The junta has scotched speculation in recent weeks that it might be
about to release Suu Kyi, telling Thailand's Foreign Minister that she
would not be freed until the constitution now being drafted was
complete. Diplomats in Rangoon say that could take years.
Yokota reported that the junta's reign of fear continued unabated,
with widespread executions, torture, slave labour, and forced
relocations of innocent villagers.
Suu Kyi, who is married to the British academic Dr Michael Aris, was
jailed by the junta a year before her National People's Party won a
landslide victory in elections.
In a move agreed with the Burmese Government last year, a UN
delegation will visit the country this weekend to act as intermediary in
three days of discussions on human rights and democracy.
Meanwhile, the media in Norway report that the jailed Chinese
dissident Wei Jingsheng and former US President Jimmy Carter are among
nominees for this year's Nobel Peace Prize.
Carter, the US president from 1976-80, has helped defuse crises
between the United States and North Korea, and mediated during the US
invasion of Haiti last year.
Russia's leading human rights campaigner Sergei Kovalyov, a disciple
of the late Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov, has been nominated for
defending Chechens in Grozny and berating President Boris Yeltsin for
Russia's war on the rebel region.--Reuter/AP.

Bonn, Thursday
ISLAMIC fundamentalism poses just as great a threat to the West as
communism once did, Nato Secretary-General Willy Claes said today.
''Fundamentalism is at least as dangerous as communism was. Please do
not underestimate this risk,'' he told a German newspaper.
He said he did not see how fundamentalism and democracy could be
reconciled. However, he added that Nato could help to counter the threat
posed by Islamic extremists as the Alliance redefined its role after
winning the Cold War.
Asked what Nato could do, he said: ''Initiatives have just begun in
the field of restricting the spread of weapons of mass destruction. A
dialogue with Mediterranean countries is also beginning. How can we help
them meet the challenges of fundamentalism?
''Nato is much more than a military alliance,'' he said. ''It has
committed itself to defending basic principles of civilisation that bind
North America and Western Europe.''
After decades with its big guns facing towards the east, Nato has
begun to turn more attention towards the south, opening informal
contacts with northern African countries such as Egypt, Tunisia, and
Morocco.
Claes arrived in Bonn today for his first visit to Germany since
taking over as Nato chief last year.
He later met Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and they agreed that the Alliance
must co-operate with the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe to
stabilise the region.
''Integration and co-operation, above all an intensive partnership
with Russia and Ukraine, must complement each other so that no dividing
lines are created in Europe,'' said German Government spokesman Dieter
Vogel.--Reuter.

GREEK objections to Turkey signing a Customs union with the European
Union look like being lifted when the EU Foreign Ministers meet in
Brussels on Monday.
The Foreign Ministers of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Turkey
made progress yesterday in winning the necessary assurances from Ankara
about a negotiated settlement on Cyprus.
Greece has blocked progress on the Customs union, due to take effect
at the end of this year. It used the veto when EU Foreign Ministers met
in December in Ankara, and also blocked the release to Turkey of
millions in EU grants and loans.
Yesterday's talks in London, which did not involve Greece, indicated
that the necessary breakthrough should come next week. An EU-Turkish
pact would give Ankara closer relations with Brussels than any country
other than Norway and Iceland. In return for dropping its tariffs on EU
goods, Turkey would gain access for its products to the vast EU market.
The diplomatic initiative has been inspired by the growing anxiety
within the EU about instability on its southern flank, particularly from
Muslim fundamentalism.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said there was a need for action on
Cyprus because the problem, instead of solving itself, would become
dangerous again. Negotiations about the entry of Cyprus and Malta to the
EU should start after the 1986 inter-governmental conference.

BRITAIN last night announced plans to buy up to 50 European military
transport planes after France warned that British firms could lose out
on helping to build it.
France, Germany, and Italy are partners in a plan to develop the
so-called Future Large Aircraft to replace existing military transport
planes.
French Defence Minister Francois Leotard said today: ''If the British
do not buy the proposed plane, well, there is no reason why they should
make it, and on that basis, we would look at production arrangements
with the Germans and other Europeans, notably Italy.''
Defence Procurement Minister Roger Freeman said after talks with Mr
Leotard that Britain planned to sign an agreement by the end of the year
to buy up to 50 of the new European military transporters.
Mr Freeman told a Paris news conference: ''It is our intention to put
ourselves in a position to rejoin the project and sign an agreement by
the end of the year.''
He said Britain needed between 40 and 50 FLAs to replace the ageing
fleet of Hercules 130 transporters as well as VC10 and Tristar military
freighters.

From PATRICK BROGAN
Washington, Thursday
SPEAKER Newt Gingrich admitted last night that his ''Contract with
America'' is in trouble. This is the legislative programme he hopes to
push through Congress by mid-April, or within 100 days. The deadline is
receding rapidly.
The contract won the Republicans the elections last November. They
have discovered that, despite their majorities in both houses, passing
the Bills is far more difficult than they expected.
Mr Gingrich told a meeting here: ''I'll be quite frank with you. I
think term-limits is going to be very hard to pass and I think
litigation reform is just going to be a brawl. We need your help on the
balanced budget amendment, which I think is in serious difficulty.''
That amendment was halved in the House and now faces difficulties in
the Senate. It needs 67 votes out of 100 to pass there, and the result
may turn on the votes of one or two senators.
As for term-limitation, that is very popular in many states: the
proposal is that Congressmen and Senators should serve no more than 12
years.
There are strong arguments against it: it is undemocratic, because it
limits citizens' rights to choose their representatives; it is
hypocritical, because it does not apply to senior Republicans like Mr
Gingrich, who have already served more than 12 years (Strom Thurmond was
elected to the Senate in 1954); and if voters want to throw the bums
out, they have regular opportunities to do so, and availed themselves of
that right last November.
It will be defeated in Congress, however, because most Congressmen and
Senators see no reason to vote themselves out of jobs they worked hard
to win.
Another ''Contract'' proposal, the line-item veto to allow presidents
to knock single items out of spending Bills, is going through easily,
but has been emasculated.
As for litigation reform, to limit liability awards and change the
lawyer-ridden American system, it faces ferocious opposition from the
law lobby, which carries great weight on Capitol Hill.
Other items in the ''Contract'' are in difficulty: the gun lobbyists
wants to repeal gun control laws, thus amending the Crime Bill in the
Contract, and will provoke a sustained battle if they try.
Most problematic of all, the contract proposes tax cuts, chiefly for
the rich, and a first step to balancing the budget. Battle starts next
week when President Clinton submits his budget to Congress.

Amsterdam, Thursday
BLOATED Dutch rivers which had threatened to flood over weakened
defences are tonight receding so fast that the fear is now of saturated
dikes collapsing.
Officials said water levels along the Rhine, Waal, Meuse, and IJssel
rivers were falling fast, but ancient dikes that have been under intense
pressure from flood waters for days could still collapse.
''The situation is stable now, but that does not mean the danger's
gone,'' Interior Minister Hans Dijkstal told Parliament. ''There are
still several places where dikes could be breached.''
A spokeswoman said: ''We're worried by the speed at which the water is
going down, because although that removes the pressure on the bottom of
the dikes, it means the heavily-soaked tops can fall inwards -- like an
overcooked plum pudding.''
Water levels at Lobith where the Rhine enters the Netherlands from
Germany had fallen more than a foot to 53ft 5in above sea-level by
mid-afternoon.
Officials predicted the water was likely to subside by 20in a day over
the weekend.
Hundreds of soldiers and volunteers who battled through the night to
buttress crumbling dikes appeared to have gained the upper hand today.
Fears that dikes would burst led to a quarter of a million people
being ordered to flee their homes in Holland's biggest peacetime
evacuation.
Some have since tried to get back to their homes to feed animals or
salvage valuables. One elderly farmer said today he was trying to reach
his home in the village of Ingen, where he had left behind #12,000.
Police mobilised from all over the Netherlands said they had sealed
off and were patrolling villages to deter looting.
As the water continued to subside across France, Belgium, and Germany,
authorities declared the worst of the crisis over.
Vast tracts of countryside and riverside villages in north-west Europe
remain submerged by the floods, which have claimed at least 26 lives,
but there was a sense of relief today as bright sunshine replaced days
of persistent rain.
In Brussels the European Investment Bank, the European Commission's
lending arm, said it was ready to help repair flood damage.
''We stand ready, if major reconstruction work is necessary, to make
available long-term finance,'' said Sir Brian Unwin, the bank's
president.
* The Dutch tulip harvest has escaped the floods. ''Almost 100% of our
tulip production is outside the flooding area,'' said marketing director
Bert Nollen at the International Flower Bulb Centre.--Reuter/AP.

From JEFFREY HELLER
Cairo, Thursday
ISRAEL and the Palestinians agreed at a four-nation summit in Cairo
today to press on with their self-rule agreements, while PLO leader
Yasser Arafat promised Israel he would take a strong line against
violent opponents of peace.
After more than five hours of talks, Arafat and the leaders of Israel,
Egypt, and Jordan made a fresh commitment to the goal of a full Middle
East peace, including Syria and Lebanon.
Egypt said it had called the historic one-day summit to save the
Middle East peace process from collapse over disputes such as Jewish
settlements, Islamic militant attacks on Israeli targets, and Israel's
refusal to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Asked if it had achieved this objective, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said: ''Yes. I believe the Palestinian-Israeli peace process is
back on track.''
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
attending the summit with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King
Hussein of Jordan, would meet again next Thursday on the border between
Gaza and Israel for more talks, he added.
Today was the leaders' first time for such a four-way meeting.
In a step towards what Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres has
called a ''coalition for peace'', the four nations would hold the first
of a series of regular meetings at foreign minister level in Washington
next week, a joint communique said.
Moussa said the summit failed to persuade Israel to ease the closure
of the Palestinian territories or to change its controversial policy on
Jewish settlement there.
On the peace process, a joint communique said: ''The leaders . . .
reaffirmed their determination to continue the Middle East peace process
towards the fulfilment of a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace . . .
The parties are committed to honour and implement fully in letter and
spirit the historic accords reached between them.
''(They) condemned all the outbreaks of bloodshed, terror, and
violence in the region and reaffirmed their intention to stand staunchly
against and put an end to all such acts,'' it added.
Moussa, asked what practical steps would be taken on violence, said:
''Such a meeting cannot discuss specifically ways and means but we
reaffirm our stand against all kinds of violence that would undermine
the peace process.''
The Palestinians had tried to steer the meeting away from the question
of violence and towards the next stage in Israel giving the Palestinians
more autonomy in the West Bank.
Asked what Arafat had won in exchange for his promise to act against
violent groups, Moussa said: ''The prompt activation of the peace
process between the Palestinians and the Israelis.''
The communique indicated that the leaders made little progress on the
dispute over Israel's nuclear programme, an issue gaining urgency as the
April deadline for renewing the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
approaches.
''After appreciating President Mubarak's disarmament proposals on
weapons of mass destruction, the parties shall pursue a mutually viable
Middle East zone, free of weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear,
chemical, and biological,'' it said.
Moussa described the nuclear dispute as ''very serious'' and said
Egypt would keep talking about it with the Israelis.
Egypt has so far strongly resisted American pressure to agree an
extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty unless it is signed by the
Jewish state. Israel, which is widely believed to possess nuclear arms,
has consistently refused to sign the treaty.
Peres said today that Israel and Egypt were close to resolving the
dispute over the treaty, but Moussa denied this.
The communique said the four leaders ''expressed the hope that the
near future will witness the achievement of peace accords between
Israel, Syria, and Lebanon''.
Asked if the summit had tried to influence Syria into compromising in
its peace talks with Israel, Moussa said: ''I don't think Syria needs
convincing because they believe in peace. But of course they stick to
the principle that we all agree on -- land for peace, all for all,'' he
said.
He was referring to Syria's insistence on a complete Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights in exchange for full peace with the
Jewish state.--Reuter.

Los Angeles, Thursday
THE retired policeman who claimed that ex-footballer turned film star
O J Simpson had told him he dreamed about killing his ex-wife admitted
that he had a drinking problem and had been disciplined for alcohol
abuse.
Ronald Shipp, giving evidence for the second day in Simpson's double
murder trial in Los Angeles, said he had drunk at Simpson's home while
consoling him and members of his family in the week after the murders of
Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
''Almost everyone in that house was drunk,'' he said.
He also admitted, under cross-examination by defence lawyer Carl
Douglas, to drunken outbursts at the home of Simpson's personal
secretary Cathy Randa in the two months after Nicole's death.
He said he had gone to Randa's house drunk and banged loudly on her
door because when he was under the influence of alcohol he had a habit
of turning up at people's homes unannounced.
Shipp said yesterday that, following a conversation about DNA tests on
the night after the murders, Simpson ''kind of jokingly just said, 'To
be honest Shipp, I've had some dreams of killing her'.''
Judge Lance Ito allowed the defence to establish that the dream
statement did not in fact follow the DNA conversation, but came after
Simpson had talked about not knowing whether he wanted to take a lie
detector test.
Prosecutor Marcia Clark argued that it was the dream statement that
was important, not when it was said.
''Walt Disney said it best in Sleeping Beauty. 'A dream is a wish your
heart makes','' she said.
Simpson denies the June 12 1994 murders of his ex-wife and Goldman.
In a dramatic and often emotional exchange with Douglas yesterday,
Shipp said he felt personal guilt over Nicole's death ''because perhaps
I didn't do as much as I could have''.
A friend of both Simpsons, Shipp said he counselled them after an
incident on New Year's Day 1989 in which Simpson did not contest a
charge of beating his wife.
At one point today Shipp was seen mouthing the words ''Tell the
truth'' to Simpson.
The judge ordered him not to try to make contact with the defendant.
The trial continues.--Reuter.

It hires out plant and earth-moving equipment to the civil

industries in Scotland and North of England from its main base at
Tollcross.
Receiver Blair Nimmo, of KPMG, said yesterday: ''I feel very confident
we can find a buyer, although we cannot be sure. We have been reassuring
employees and customers that it is business as usual.''
He added: ''Adam Bruce is well known in the industries where it
operates and currently has a number of contracts with major players in
the UK market. The problem for them has been the progressive effect of
the recession on customers plus ever-increasing competitive pressures.''

CANCER cases in Scotland will rise by 12% for men and 7% for women in
the decade up to the year 2000, a report predicted yesterday.
The document, produced by Lothian Health's public health medicine
department, says that more health promotion campaign work is required to
highlight death from cancer.
The report which states the potential for prevention is great
especially among smokers, highlights the differences in incidence rates
evident between the deprived and affluent areas.
It emphasises the importance of health promotion programmes, and
maintains that although there are existing national campaigns, promotion
work locally needed to be enhanced.
Acknowledging cancer as a major cause of illness and death with a
large proportion of resources spent every year on services, Lothian
Health pointed out that 90% of lung cancers and 30% of all cancers were
caused by smoking.
Cancers are responsible for about one in four of all deaths in Lothian
and every year more than 1000 men and 1000 women die from cancer.
Lothian Health said that it would be considering what action was
required in the light of the report.
Meanwhile, scientists fear a new cancer risk from motor vehicle
exhaust fumes after the discovery of radioactivity in children's teeth.
The pollutant, polonium-210, is derived from lead and was found after
tests on youngsters living near motorways, according to The Lancet.
Dr Denis Henshaw of Bristol University said: ''We were astounded to
find an association like this. It is the first time that variations of
it have been seen in the human body.''
He wants polonium-210 added to the list of potential cancer causing
substances in exhaust fumes. Dr Henshaw said the amounts detected cannot
be linked with any certainty to cancer cases.
However, evidence of its potential to cause tumours comes from
research linking exposure to high concentrations of naturally occurring
radon gas -- which also gives off radiation -- and leukemia, brain
tumours, and kidney cancer especially in children.
Concern about petrol pollution was heightened last October when a
committee of MPs called for super unleaded petrol which contains cancer
causing chemicals to be banned.
* As few as a third of women in the UK are benefitting from breast
cancer screening, a conference in Glasgow was told yesterday.
Dr Alastair Kirkpatrick, director of the South-East Scotland Breast
Screening Programme, said that the UK uptake for mammography screening
was about 70%. The Scottish figure is 72%.
''If 100% attended for screening, then we might expect to see a
reduction in mortality of 40%,'' he added.

RESIDENTS are considering legal action against a health trust over its
management of a maintenance fund.
A condition of the sale two years ago of the former health board
houses in Netherton Oval, in the grounds of Lennox Castle Hospital near
Glasgow, was that residents pay at least #135 a year into a maintenance
fund.
However, the Netherton Residents' Association claims that about
#12,000 of payments remain unaccounted for and that only about #2000 has
been spent on repairs since the fund was established.
A solicitor for the residents claimed that the Greater Glasgow
Community and Mental Health Services NHS Trust has admitted that the
monies are going straight into a common fund used by the trust.
The contract involves the health board maintaining the water and
drainage systems, electricity for street lighting, roads, pavements, and
grass cutting in communal areas.
Mr Finlay Dow, chairman of the residents' association, said yesterday:
''We don't believe we are getting the service that we were promised. We
have to wait months just to get a street light bulb replaced.''
Health trust officials have allegedly conceded that only #60 had been
spent on street lighting, and the same again on road and pavement
repairs in the past year, although residents had contributed #850 and
#1000 respectively.
The residents want the condition of sale waived by the Scottish
Secretary so that they can be free to appoint their own factor.
A health trust official rejected allegations that the fund had been
mismanaged.
She said: ''The #2000 only covers the payment for road and pavement
repairs. The total figure spent on all of these services is considerably
higher.''

ULSTER Unionists were silenced in the Commons yesterday in the face of
overwhelming cross-party support for the Prime Minister's battle to keep
the peace process alive.
Last night Labour leader Tony Blair, in a national broadcast,
supported Mr Major in his historic attempt to end the killing.
In a series of passionate exchanges in the Commons concerning the
controversial leak of a draft document, the Ulster Unionists had few
friends.
Later Viscount Cranbourne, a central ally of the Unionists brought
into the Cabinet by the Prime Minister, told a private meeting of
Ministers in the Lords that he will not resign on this issue. He will
support the Prime Minister whatever happens in the delicate and
dangerous pursuit of a final peace in Northern Ireland.
Viscount Cranbourne had been reported as threatening resignation on
this issue.
The political drift at Westminster last night, backed by Mr Blair and
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, was for Mr Major's campaign for
peace.
The Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, told the Cabinet
yesterday morning he is launching an inquiry to try to discover who
leaked a partial draft document to The Times concerning the
London-Dublin negotiations to produce a next-stage platform for
constitutional negotiations.
Mr Blair told the nation last night: ''There are some areas of
Government activity which should rise above traditional party politics.
Seeking to bring peace to Northern Ireland is one of them. We are not
talking about differences of opinion here. We're talking about the
difference between life and death.''
Mr Blair acknowledged that London-Dublin negotiations were not yet
complete and it was sensible for people to wait for the full agreed
document before passing judgment.
In the Commons, Mr Blair gave immediate support to the Prime Minister.
As questioning built up from Tory and Labour benches the Prime
Minister's position improved. ''There is a communal will not to be
distracted from the goal of peaceful and permanent and agreed settlement
in Northern Ireland.''
To begin Ulster Unionist MPs were standing to attract the Speaker's
eye to be called. But by the end of the 15-minute question time they had
ceased to try to intervene.
Now the hunt for the leaker has been established by the Irish Premier,
Mr John Bruton, and by the British Government. The Northern Ireland
Office will report its findings to the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Robin
Butler, who will decide if further action needs to be taken.
The Ulster Unionists are still regarded as the ones most likely to
have leaked a draft document.
Meanwhile, the Irish Government last night confirmed the early release
of five IRA prisoners as part of its continuing response to terrorist
ceasefires in Northern Ireland.
The five will include Pamela Kane, 30, the only jailed IRA woman in
the Irish Republic. Kane, from Dublin, is serving a 10-year sentence for
her part in a bank raid.

A YOUNG child and a six-month-old baby were last night being cared for
by foster parents for the second night running after being abandoned by
a woman in the home of a stranger in the East End of Glasgow.
Strathclyde police issued an appeal for help in identifying the
children and the woman who left them.
Mr George McKenna, 38, unemployed, of Appin Road, Haghill told last
night how a woman in her late 40s had come to his door looking for his
next door neighbour's friend Pearl.
She asked him to look after the boys for a few minutes. More than
three hours later, she still had not returned.
One is aged between three and four; the baby aged between three and
six months.
Mr McKenna decided to contact the police. On his way to a phone-box in
Alexandra Parade, he stopped at a fish-and-chip shop to ask for advice,
and staff there called the police for him. The little boy was given some
chips.
''He was hungry. He wasn't long in eating them,'' said Mr McKenna.
''Most of the time the baby was sleeping, but sometimes it was crying.
The little boy kept on saying Mummy. I would have said he was missing
her.''
It was thought unlikely last night that the woman was the children's
mother, given her age. Police described her as 40 or 50 years of age, of
thin build, and with short, streaked hair. She was wearing black
leggings, a dark anorak, and white Hi-Tec training boots.
The older boy was of thin build, with black or brown hair, and brown
eyes.
He was wearing red tracksuit trousers, a two-tone blue top with the
logo ''Cricket New York Team'', black trainers, and a navy anorak with
an ''Arctic Region'' logo.
The baby also had black or brown hair, was slightly built, and had
brown eyes.
He was wearing a size 10 light grey body suit, a white jacket, light
blue padded trousers, and white socks.
Anyone with information is asked to contact London Road police station
on 041-554-1113.

FRED PERRY, the last British man to lift the Wimbledon singles title,
died yesterday in hospital in Australia. He was 85.
Perry, who completed a hat-trick of titles between 1934-36, fell and
cracked four ribs in an accident in his hotel bathroom in Melbourne last
week.
He was released from hospital, but readmitted shortly afterwards after
reportedly suffering another fall.
A statement released by Wimbledon last night described him as ''one of
the most famous names in sport and revered throughout the tennis
world''.
Perry's fourth wife Barbara was with him in Melbourne where he had
been watching the Australian Open tennis championships. His daughter,
Penny, was on her way from London to Australia when he died.
The achievement which Perry himself treasured most was the Davis Cup
triumph over the French in Paris in 1933 when he helped bring the trophy
back to Britain for the first time since 1911.
Perry was one of the first players to make fitness a central plank of
his tournament preparation: he even trained with Arsenal.
His dedication spurred him to join the professional ranks in 1936,
earning the displeasure of Wimbledon who withdrew his honorary
membership and asked for the return of their tie.
The rift between Club and player was finally healed in 1984 when All
England chiefs erected a statue in his honour. The gates next to his
bronze figure bear his name.
He remained active until his death, and was a regular member of BBC
Radio's commentary team at Wimbledon and other major championships from
1949.
All England Club chairman John Curry said: ''Fred Perry was a
superlative ambassador for our sport throughout the world. He was a
great character, big-hearted and a true champion in every sense.''
A statement from the Lawn Tennis Association said: ''His playing
record commanded universal respect and his wit and warm personality
rightly earned him a special place in the affections of everyone
involved in tennis.''
Mr Brian Tobin, president of the International Tennis Federation,
said: ''Not only was he a great champion, he was also a great friend to
so many players and national tennis associations over the years.''

THE Tories have ''not a chance'' of holding on to Perth and Kinross
when the seat is next contested, according to the sitting MP, Sir
Nicholas Fairbairn.
Sir Nicholas, the self-styled bon viveur who is gravely ill with
hepatitis, announced last year that he would not be standing for
Parliament again. The liver disease has prevented him from attending
Westminster for several months.
In an interview with The Herald he was scathing about the choice of
candidate to succeed him, claiming that he had received ''innumerable
telephone calls and letters from local Tory supporters'' maintaining
that Mr John Godfrey, a London-based banker with no Perthshire
connections, would prove ''unelectable''.
Mr Godfrey was surprised by the criticism and said: ''I have had some
extremely useful chats with Sir Nicky, including some fatherly advice,
but he is a bit unpredictable.''
He pointed out that, since being adopted in October, he had bought a
home in Perthshire and builders would be finished doing work on it in a
fortnight. His wife and family would then move north and he would be
able to spend long weekends in Scotland meeting people in the
constituency.
''I have been up at weekends and the feedback I have had so far has
been absolutely fine,'' he added.
The constituency chairman, Mr Martin Robb, also thought Sir Nicholas
was being ''unreasonably critical'', adding: ''John has been up and down
like a yo-yo and no-one could say other than that he has done very well.
The reception recently from the Chamber of Commerce was fantastic, and
once he finds his feet on the ground I am sure he will do well.''
Speaking at Fordell Castle in Fife, Sir Nicholas said he saw his
successor as the kind of ''identical clone found on both sides of the
House'' which meant he was not sorry to be leaving Parliament.
Given the damage to his health, he was also frank about his attitude
to drinking, calling criticism of alcohol ''a form of puritanism and
self-satisfied intolerance''.
He added: ''If you look at the history of the world, alcohol has
always played its part. This concept that it should be licensed as a
poison is utterly ridiculous. The idea that it is some sort of permitted
sin is fatuous.''
He was also scathing of his party's attitude to Europe as ''a fantasy
of illusion for do-gooder imaginists like Hurd''. He made clear that,
had he been well enough to attend the Commons, he would have been one of
the party's Euro-rebels.
He said: ''I would not regard it as defying the leadership. I would be
doing what I was elected to Parliament to do, to exercise my judgment if
I consider something to be an unprincipled folly. I have not been sent
there to wink just because John Major says wink.
''If you had told any British subject 20 years ago that they would
lose their currency, their flag, their foreign policy, and control over
their own Army, they would have said you were insane. Anyone says that
now and they are a rebel.''
Repenting nothing of his roller-coaster career, he said: ''In politics
if I had kept my nose clean and brushed my hair and wiped my bottom and
sucked up I would no doubt have got a lot further but since the price of
getting further would have been alien to my nature, I don't regret
that.''

BRITISH Gas is to switch emergency calls from offices in Scotland to a
new centre based in Newcastle upon Tyne.
The move has angered unions, consumers, and politicians concerned
about the safety implications.
It is being seen as a further blow to a workforce who, it is claimed
by unions and consumer groups, are already demoralised by cutback plans.
These include cutting the salaries of showroom staff, shutting
showrooms, loss of Scottish Gas headquarters in Edinburgh, and shedding
thousands of jobs over the next three to five years.
The decision was confirmed as Mr Cedric Brown the company's
#475,000-a-year chief executive flew into Scotland last night.
He will entertain top management to dinner before visiting district
offices. He will also meet a number of staff to discuss the company's
current position.
After arriving in Edinburgh, he placed a question mark over the future
of the British Gas Scottish operations when he warned that the
privatised utility had to undergo change because of increased
competition coming into the gas market.
He said at Edinburgh Airport: ''I am here for a routine visit because
I believe in getting out and meeting staff. A lot of changes are taking
place within British Gas as competition comes into the market. The
company has to change.''
Mr Brown invited British Gas Scottish staff to be both open and frank
with him whilst he was in Scotland.
There was a frank statement from Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader, who
said: ''The way Cedric Brown is going British Gas staff will be stuck in
a bunker somewhere running the whole operation.
''This is a further retrenchment from an already reduced position. We
have already seen that there is a question mark over British Gas's
emergency response following the explosion in Inverness last month.
''Emergency calls require some degree of familiarity with the areas
concerned. Quite often in an emergency a caller does not have the time
or ability to give an absolutely detailed description. That is clearly
not going to be avaliable.''
Mr Jim Waller, senior regional officer of Unison, said union members
were concerned at the implications of implementing an untried system
from Newcastle. ''Our members are certainly concerned about the safety
implication of this moving the emergency calls to Newcastle. Nobody
quite knows if it is going to work.
''British Gas have moved their headquarters out of Scotland, they have
done away with one stop shops where people can get all the services
including help and assistance, and now this.''
Mr Waller said he had asked if he could meet Mr Brown on his current
visit to put union concerns to him but had had his request turned down.
''I was told he would only be meeting employees. I wanted to discuss
with him the situation that British Gas employees find themselves in.
They don't know where they stand.''
The proposal has also been attacked by the Gas Consumer Council. Mr
Euan Robson, Scottish manager, said: ''We don't like this.
''We can see a number of problems developing. In particular we are
concerned about back-up in the event of the system failing. They are
going to introduce the system and take off the various district systems
at the same time.
''There is also the question of local accents. In an emergency how
will a Geordie understand a Glaswegian?''
Mr Robson said there was huge public concern with the way Scottish Gas
was operating in Scotland. ''I have no idea where Mr Brown is going or
who he is going to talk to. But he is welcome to come in here and we
will show him what his customers are saying to us. Standards are
slipping badly.
''The foundation of British Gas's success in the past has been a
quality service delivered in a safe manner. The wheels are now starting
to come off that.''
Mr Hamish McPherson, Scottish communications manager for British Gas,
said there would be no loss of service when the emergency calls service
moved to Newcastle.
''From around May if you dial a local emergency number in Scotland
your call will be rerouted to a central bureau in Newcastle who will
reroute it on to the people in Scotland.
''There is nothing new in that. Within Scotland and other areas calls
are already rerouted to various emergency bureaux. The important thing
is that safety is paramount and response times will be exactly the same
as before.
''The staff employed in these offices at the moment might go into
other jobs within the company. All staff are offered other opportunities
within the company. Any redundancies are purely voluntary.''
One third of British Gas staff in Scottish showrooms have applied for
voluntary redundancy rather than opt for pay cuts, claimed to be up to
16%.
Mr McPherson said: ''Approximately 50 retail staff out of 150 have
applied for voluntary redundancy. The majority of these have long
service with British Gas and were happy to take an attractive package.''
On the issue of wages, Mr Brown emphasised that no-one in British Gas
had had their wages cut. When asked about his own salary he said no
staff member he met whilst in Scotland should feel inhibited about
talking to him, either about his or their wage.

<HEADLINE>Clarke hint on single Euro currency</HEADLINE>

THE Chancellor last night raised the prospect of a single European
currency before the end of the century.
The Cabinet has reportedly ruled out a single currency by 1997, but Mr
Kenneth Clarke said there ''might'' be one two years later.
Mr Major has insisted it is so far off in the future there is no need
to address it before the next election.
The Government negotiated an opt-out of the single currency provisions
of the Maastricht Treaty which set a target of 1997, with 1999 as the
latest date.
Mr Clarke told Channel 4 News: ''The British are not committed. It's a
two-way choice.
''It's a choice that I hope we'll exercise sensibly if others go ahead
with a single currency, which I believe will certainly not be possible
in 1996-97.
''It might be in 1999.''
However, European Commission President Jacques Santer last weekend
insisted the Maastricht timetable must be stuck to.
Mr Clarke insisted a single currency by 1997 was ''an academic
question''. Only the UK, Luxembourg, and possibly Germany would meet the
economic convergence criteria in time, he said.
Earlier the Chancellor had more immediate monetary issues in mind when
he lifted interest rates half a point to 6[3/4]%, his third rise in five
months as he strives to subdue inflationary pressures in the economy.
Building societies appeared to take the move in their stride, and
there was no sign they would follow through with increases in their
mortgage lending rates.
The Halifax saw no need to make any changes, though it said it would
keep the situation under review. The Abbey National bank said it was
''reluctant'' to increase rates, while the Nationwide said it was
reviewing the situation.
However, the trend in interest rates is still upward and house buyers
are likely to suffer eventually. Businesses will now have to pay more
for their borrowings.
The decision to lift rates was taken at the regular monthly meeting
between Mr Clarke and the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie
George. It was expected in financial markets and generally welcomed.
Mr Major defended the Chancellor's move, saying it was necessary to
keep inflation under control, but he admitted it would cause extra
hardship to homeowners.
Labour leader Tony Blair asked him in the Commons to confirm that the
typical homeowner would be #800 worse off since last April, because of
interest rate rises and Budget changes, and noted that Mr Major did not
dispute his figure.
Mr Blair asked: ''What kind of recovery is it which peaks when it has
hardly begun?'' He said it was no good Ministers ''scrabbling around to
find the feel-good factor'', adding ''people feel insecure because they
know they are worse off under the Tories''.
Mr Major retorted that he ''had cheek'' considering that the new
interest rate level equalled the lowest achieved at any stage by the
last Labour Government.
Labour calculates that, assuming no further rate increases, by April
1995 average housing costs will have risen by #785 or 25% in one year.
