'Had he been a jazz
musician no one would
think twice . . .'
IAN BELL finds that live performance is everything with a man of many
records
AFTER all these years, the real surprise turns out to be that Bob
Dylan is a recording artist at all. Watching an effortless, elemental
performance in Edinburgh last week, it grew steadily more plain that
this is a performer, not a human juke-box, that his rolling thunder
swells when he is on stage, with human faces at his feet and a band at
his back, that nothing he does is immutable. The stage is what he is;
records are what he does.
He is, it becomes clear, still in the tradition of the old folk and
blues men who were rarely done honest justice by audio tape, yet who
never felt themselves imprisoned by the recording studio. Dylan is
famous for the ease with which he records, for his disdain for
''production values'' or artifice, and you can see why: for him the
machines exist only to capture that musical quicksilver, to grab a
little essence from the air.
If the recordings fail -- and after 41 albums success can seem as
arbitrary as nature itself -- there is always another song, another
town, another arrangement, and another effort to win a few minutes of
clarity in a murky world. Hence the so-called ''Never-ending Tour'' and
all those long years on the road. Dylan, who looked in perfect health
the other night (though his taste in shirts is deteriorating fast), is
just doing what he does best.
The calumny sitting at the heart of most reviews of his recent British
performances is two-fold: that he doesn't care about his audience and
that his ceaseless efforts to rework his songs are a sign of artistic
exhaustion. Both claims are wrong, and for the same dumb reasons that
have for years dogged the only composer since the thirties to have done
anything truly original with the American popular song.
Take the first part of the charge: he doesn't chatter like a long-lost
friend on stage. After 25 years of watching rock 'n' roll, this can seem
like blessed release, but in Dylan's case it's something more, a
strategy rather than a whim. He disdains the synthetic intimacy most
performers need like a drug, partly because he just gets on with the
job. But he rejects it too, you could argue, in order to draw a line
between the audience and the song.
When you have been around as long as Dylan has, and when you have
composed so many songs of which people feel deeply possessive, half the
battle is to save your work from the emotional embalmers, the people who
treat their memories like family treasures and hate anyone, the artist
not least, who ruins the myth by questioning it. Dylan offers the
experience of his music, not ownership, and you are inclined to respect
him all the more for that. The line he is walking is that narrow one
which runs between private art and public art.
Last week in Edinburgh the arrangements themselves were a source of
wonder (anyone who says ''but you can't make out the words'' has pawned
his ears or never heard the songs before). It never seemed likely that
Tambourine Man could ever again possess the wistful sheen and touching
intensity that it once had, but he made it happen. It never seemed
plausible that Like a Rolling Stone could evolve from exhilarating punk
bravado to a stately maturity, but it could. It seemed impossible that
All Along the Watchtower could become still more chilling, still more
tantalising, or that Dylan would play lead guitar on it to such effect;
it wasn't, he did.
Suddenly you were listening again, and listening hard.
Two good reasons for continually reworking the material can be put.
One is the loyal audience themselves, the people who want ''their''
Jokerman, 'their'' Rolling Stone just and only as they first heard them.
Imagine, though, playing the same song, in exactly the same way, for
decades on end; imagine facing people who demand that you do so. If
reworking the material is sterile, what must the living hell of its
perpetual replication be like? But why, people argue, no new songs? The
truth, for those who actually listen, is that new songs pop up all the
time (Dignity, from his recent Greatest Hits, is as good as most things
he has done). The simple fact is that, when Dylan has done tours
featuring mainly new material, asinine audiences -- and critics -- have
objected. Like all rock audiences, they want the hits; like all real
artists, he chafes at the inhibition implied.
Had he been a jazz musician no one would think twice (always a good
idea) that he takes old songs and breathes new, startling life into
them.
But the ever-changing arrangements, long his habit in any case, are
also part of the argument over ownership: at the Playhouse in Edinburgh
it sometimes seemed Dylan was challenging the audience even to attempt
to ''sing along'' with songs they thought they knew. As a believer in
corporal punishment for lachrymose community singing, this writer, for
one, owes him a debt.
Again, however, there is an aspect to all this that appears to elude
most commentators on Dylan's work. The idea of him as a poet of the page
was never very plausible. Listen to him shape the phrasing of something
like Rolling Stone or It Ain't Me, Babe, however, and you realise that
performance -- never the same twice, never final and perfected -- is the
very point, the end in itself. Is any production of a play ever
definitive? Is there only one way to perform Brahms? Dylan, playing in
the same league, appears to think not.
Part of the his problem is that the concerns of the rock 'n' roll
business are not his, if they ever really were. He outgrew them years
ago; grew up, if you prefer, when the 30, 40 and 50-somethings were, as
they still are, looking back with nostalgia to the time when he was a
Movement folk hero; a tripping chum of the Beatles; a cool country
singer; a born-again rocker; an urban romantic. Most people reach a
certain point of growth and stop dead; Dylan seems immune to that
affliction.
The man is 53, with an immense body of work behind him. If the art of
interpretation, the effort to find new layers and different angles in a
few verses, is what chiefly interests him now, who has the right to
object? This, rather than hunting feverishly for new ''product'', is
what grown-up artists do. Perhaps the twitching cadavers of the Rolling
Stones are more plausible role models for a mature gentleman? The
amusing thing about most criticism of Dylan is that his detractors have
an alarming habit of sounding a lot older, not to say more reactionary,
than their target, as though what the world really needs now is another
''rock legend''. This is especially rich at a time when popular music,
at least the music of white performers, is going through one of its
periodic bouts of tedious, shameless recycling.
Watching Dylan, you realise both that his early success was something
of a fluke and that, given the sentimental misunderstandings and
dull-witted criticism he attracts, he is lucky to be as widely-accepted
as he still is. He fits none of the strictures, accepts none of the
rules, and owes his huge artistic achievement to no one in particular.
When something is unique, you can take it or leave it, but the corporate
world, now more than ever, is unkind to the remarkable and the singular.
How important is he? Try imagining popular music without Elvis or the
Beatles. Dylan is part of the triumvirate, but he has more reach than
either in terms both of performance and composition. If he were merely a
notable lyricist, the little man would dwarf all comers, but the point
is performance, the luminous reality on stage or the cool shadow of the
recordings, our souvenirs.
His art was never just political, surreal, prophetic, literary,
righteous or simply human. It is all of that and more, penetrating on
several levels simultaneously, as old as the blues of Robert Johnson and
Blind Will McTell, or as new as whatever the kids are doing this week
with bass, guitar and drums. The range of his references is vast, his
knowledge of the folk, blues, country, R&amp;B, and rock traditions immense.
Dylan, to take just one example, has used a wider variety of verse
structures than any songwriter now active, and filled them with a wealth
of metaphor and narrative that would have bankrupted lesser imaginations
within a year.
Dismantling lyric power is like trying to describe a shade of red or
the touch of snow. You could argue that Dylan speaks to people simply
because, unlike most of us, he really does have something to say. You
could also add of Robert Zimmerman that what he does and has done is
that to which Joseph Conrad (he's in the songs too) forever aspired:
''My task is to make you hear, to make you feel -- it is, before all, to
make you see.''
When Dylan is on stage you hear, see and feel. And after all, how does
it feel?

A MAJOR problem for the livestock industry has been removed with the
restructuring of the farm assurance scheme for cattle and sheep.
Those who pioneered the original Farm Assured Scotch Livestock concept
three years ago are to be congratulated for their foresight and for
their refusal to give in when their vision failed to catch the
imagination of the majority.
They may yet see their dream fulfilled with Scotland leading the UK
and the rest of Europe on farm assurance.
It is in the nature of things, that not everyone is overjoyed.
Aberdeen and Kincardine area NFU executive met just as details of the
new scheme were being published and one farmer intimated his ''huge
disappointment'' that control was slipping away from the farmers to the
meat industry.
However, with only 20% of cattle farmers and 15% from the sheep sector
registered under the old scheme, it can hardly be claimed that they
embraced it with enthusiasm.
Now the system will be largely financed by nine of the country's
leading meat companies. They will be in a position to nominate
producers, whose operation meets the necessary standards, as members of
the scheme. Auctioneers will also be contributing to the financial cost
and will have the same right to nominate members.
Like it or not quality assurance is here to stay. For years we have
heard how Marks &amp; Spencer rules its suppliers with a rod of iron,
demanding the highest standards in hygiene, preparation, packaging and
product. The supermarket chains followed suit and the process is
inexorably working its way through to farm and field and hillside.
The farmers' gripe was that they were not receiving premium payments
under the scheme -- although that was not always the case. ANM Group
chief executive Brian Pack, whose meat company Scotch Premier is one of
the the backers of the new arrangements, calculated that they made
premium payments to farmers totalling #75,000 last year -- and still
only managed to source about 30% of their requirements from FASL stock.
It was that unsatisfactory state of affairs which led them to stop
premium payments in January.
Certainly FASL failed to cut much ice in some quarters. One farmer
memorably recalled proudly unloading stock at Kildean Mart in Stirling
and pointing out that they were FASL registered. ''I might as well have
been telling them they had been blessed by the Pope.''
From now on the major meat companies are likely to be insisting that
the majority of the beasts they buy for slaughter come from a
farm-assured background. Their big customers, the UK supermarkets, are
demanding it. From now on they will be less inclined to buy from two
sources -- assured and non-assured -- with all the attendant hassle of
having to keep the carcases separate after slaughter.
If that scenario develops it will vindicate the view that quality
should be regarded as the norm, not as an optional extra attracting
premium payments. Producers -- whether it be of beef, lamb, pigmeat or
cereals -- will either be offering quality or they will be failing to
find a buyer.
The Scottish Consumer Council, in its evidence to the Scottish Affairs
Commitee study on the future of agriculture, set out its view on quality
assurance.
Such schemes, it said, must do more than specify minimum legal
requirements and common practice. They also make the important point
that effort must be put into explaining the schemes to customers so that
they know what lies behind the use of a quality symbol. They also want
schemes to ''grow'' in the sense that standards should be gradually
raised to reflect emerging consumer concerns.
A glance at the beef and lamb farm assurance manual would be
re-assuring on the first count. Standards which are above and beyond
existing statutory requirements are printed in bold italics and there is
a lot of that typeface in evidence.
For the moment the main emphasis must be on enforcing the requirements
of the new assurance scheme operating under the banner of the Scotch
Quality Beef and Lamb Association. Thereafter, there may be room for the
kind of gradual tightening of the screw sought by the consumer council.
Care will have to be exercised, however, that the scheme does not
become so esoteric that members box themselves into what could
effectively become a niche market.
The next area to be targeted for farm assurance will be milk and it
will be interesting to see how that is to be financed. Will Scottish
Milk and other major buyers be prepared to pick up the tab? The scheme
is already on the stocks awaiting final discussions with processors and
purchasers before it is publicly unveiled.
Here again it is the supermarkets who are applying the pressure for
quality assurance and farmers are being told the argument is not about a
penny on the litre but about guaranteeing their place in the market.

Christopher Portway recalls some fond memories
THE bulge of East Anglia, comprising the counties of Suffolk and
Norfolk, is surprisingly little-known to many people. The cities of
Norwich and Ipswich, the brash resorts of Great Yarmouth and Clacton,
and ancient towns such as Ely and Bury St Edmunds have their devotees
but the rural coastline holds some of England's best-kept secrets.
Along it are strung small towns and tiny resorts that have hardly
changed over the years. At the bottom of the bulge I last saw Felixstowe
as a child nearly 60 years ago, yet my recent visit triggered a series
of recollections; South Hill winding down the seafront, the Orwell Hotel
outside a greatly reduced railway station, and haughty St Felix girls'
school atop the northern cliffs.
It was the coming of the railway and a visit of the German Empress and
King Edward VII that put the place on the map. The name means ''Blessed
Place'' and it is. Somewhat sedate yet full of fun, its sand and shingle
beach, a traffic-free promenade, neat lawns and flowerbeds, cliffs on
one flank, and a short pier, Felixstowe has everything for everybody.
The modern leisure centre offers three swimming pools, fitness studio
and full-scale bowling green while the Spa Pavilion Theatre is the envy
of many a larger resort, putting on shows from amateur to those studded
with star names.
Of historic interest is not only a number of Martello towers built to
protect the coast from a threatened Napoleonic invasion but also
sixteenth-century Landguard Fort Museum and nature reserve, the former
used in both world wars of which many fascinating mementos are on
display.
Whether en route to the Continent or simply in search of a lively but
not overpowering resort in which to spend a day or longer, Felixstowe is
most worthy of consideration.
As they approach the sea, the rivers of East Suffolk -- the Deben,
Alde and Blyth -- mere streams inland, widen into long tidal estuaries.
Here a series of small fishing communities punctuate this relatively
inaccessible coastline, each with its own definite character.
Lonely, evocative Shingle Street -- an ideal haven if your fancy runs
to sea, sky and marshland, Orford with a castle keep, better-known
Aldeburgh -- focal point for the annual Aldeburgh Festival, Thorpeness
-- a small purpose-built resort created at the beginning of the century,
Dunwich -- once an important port but now mostly devoured by the sea,
and delicious Southwold -- elegant with Dutch and Flemish houses around
a spacious common.
Northwards, the coast is even less populated with, beyond Cromer and
Sheringham, huge swathes of virgin sand revealed and hidden in turn by
huge tides. Bordering them can be found tiny Cley-next-the-Sea,
Blakeney-of-Flint and red-brick cottages, Wells-next-the-Sea of
delightful old-fashioned allure, almost extinct Brancaster of Roman
origins, and Hunstanton, ''the top of the Bulge''.
Being on the way to nowhere has helped Norfolk to preserve its
traditional independence and retain a noticeable sense of separateness.
And no coastal resort I know is so imbued with this individuality than
Hunstanton which even goes its own way in outlook -- being the only
place on the East Anglian coast to face north, across the Wash. But this
is no sleepy backwater. Old Hunstanton may bask in its aura of
picturesqueness bolstered by the elegant Le Strange Hotel and a brace of
good pub-restaurants but Hunstanton proper is full of life and
innovation.

Doreen Taylor-Wilkie visits an island that is packed with mystery
ALL countries are moulded by their geography and history and in few
places is that more visible than in Sardinia, the Italian island in the
western Mediterranean. It forms a pair with the very different French
Corsica only a few miles to the north. To both, invaders have always
come from the sea, and they came often, which is why many of Sardinia's
main towns are inland, or, if they are on the coast, are well-fortified.
We went first to Alghero, the old north-western port, with massive
yellow sandstone walls and towers, and the twelfth-century Cathedral of
Santa Maria, built by the Arogonese. Even today, Alghero has a strong
feel of northern Spain and many from the town speak a dialect close to
Catalan.
The city is a grand starting point for a tour of Sardinia's north
coast with the magnificent Grotte di Neptuno, where we climbed down 360
steps -- even more breathtaking on the way up again -- against a
background of waves thundering into the great caves, their hollow
resonance following us down.
It is hard to decide whether this northern coast is the most dramatic,
because Sardinia is surrounded by high sweeping cliffs, white sandy
beaches and a sea that varies from Mediterranean blue to a strange green
at the north-east corner, the Costa Smeralda, a 35-mile stretch on the
north-east owned by a consortium, founded by the Aga Khan in the 1950s,
in an attempt to eschew the usual tourist developments and create
typical small villages in an unspoilt area.
The Sardinian habit of building their cities inland, has left the west
coast a virtual fortress of sweeping cliffs, but on the eastern side,
the ancient Carthaginian port of the fourth century lies just south of
Costa Smeralda, and is the gateway from mainland Italy. Inland from
Olbia is Muoro, a busy commercial city in a beautiful, hidden area on
the way to the Gannargentu massif, which is the island's highest central
area, over 6000ft. It has one of the most beautiful costume museums I
have seen with the brilliant colours of men's and women's attire from
some 150 different districts.
Not far south from Muoro, the village of Mogoro has a craft school and
workshop, unusual because it is also a workers' co-operative, and noisy
because the loom bars making wall-hangings and carpets thunder down
every few seconds. The old designs are precious and securely guarded.
They have wonderful patterns of horses and other animals, flowers and
birds but, at #250 a piece, I reluctantly decided not to buy. Yet a
whole carpet takes two workers two weeks to complete, so it is not
really expensive at that price.
Everywhere outside the towns, sheep bells are still the sound of
Sardinia because the slanders have been shepherds for hundreds and
thousands of years. The sound of the flocks approaching travels from
miles away in the clear air. Nowhere was this more so than at Barumini,
in the centre of the south.
Barumini has the most famous collection of the strange buildings
called muraghe, of which Sardinia has some 7000. They were the homes of
an ancient people who left no written records. Built like drystone dikes
but with huge boulders, the layout was similar to the idea of a Border
pele tower where people from the surrounding country moved in in time of
trouble. Barumini's central beehive tower, with steep, dark passages and
steps up to a flat roof was near impregnable and a deep well prolonged
its defence. Who these skilful builders were and why they disappeared
despite their strong positions, nobody knows.
Cagliari, at the south, is Sardinia's ancient capital and the largest
port. It holds remains from as far back as Roman times in the
amphitheatre, and the fortified walls and towers go back to the Pisan
era. In nearby lagoons, there are even older lake dwellings and, in
winter, the deep rose colour of thousands of feeding flamingoes. In an
island as old and mysterious as Sardinia, Cagliari's Archaeological
Museum is well worth a visit.
Our last night in Cagliari was a real Sardinian evening, with the
music from the traditional launedda, an amazing three-tube bagpipe,
where the player's facial cavity forms the bag, giving the musician's
face an extraordinary shape as he played.

THERE was a subdued start to Edinburgh International Folk Festival on
Friday. Where normally the opening concert is packed, and the musicians
are lifted by the atmosphere, this time the Queen's Hall was only about
half full, producing little sense of occasion.
Headliners, uillean piper Davy Spillane's unplugged trio, opened -- a
wise move, given their more refined nature and the energetic approach of
''support act'' Dervish.
Refined they may be, but the ad hoc mood of the trio's previous
Scottish concert, during Celtic Connections 1994, remains. When they
really play together, they produce some great music, but it's individual
contributions, such as Spillane's slow airs, and Sean Tyrrell's
distinctive, husky singing on Host In The Air, which stand out.
Dervish ripped into their reels with bags of youthful enthusiasm. They
haven't quite developed the musical depth of more experienced bands such
as Altan, but their arrangements are strong and they play with
intelligence and brio.
A chest infection had their singer, Cathy Jordan, struggling at times
to hold the melody and unwittingly initiating a disappointing hat trick
-- all three young Irish bands (Deanta and Oige were the others)
appearing over the weekend have great singers, all of whom either didn't
sing to form or didn't sing at all.
The subdued atmosphere continued at Teviot House, where you might have
had difficulty forming a jury from Tomas Lynch's audience in the Park
Room. Not that this affected Lynch. Accompanying himself impressively on
guitar, he sang truly, with conviction and not a little humour,
particularly on The Irish Jubilee, a kind of Inversneckie Grocer with
bells on.
Business was brisker on Saturday in the Queen's Hall, as Robin
Williamson sat waiting patiently for latecomers to be seated before
launching into his slightly-deranged, Celtic-bard role.
But Williamson is also shrewd, turning our embarrassment to his
advantage with a touch of self-deprecation and, by the end, I was firmly
on his side.
After a disappointing set from Deanta, whose singer, Mary Dillon,
didn't sing with anything approaching her assurance of last year, the
festival really came alive in the Park Room with Karen Tweed and Ian
Carr.
This accordion and guitar duo take tunes from every conceivable nook
and cranny in Europe and play them with easy virtuosity, elan, and sheer
cheek.
Pity poor Oige having to follow this, although they did so with
typical instrumental verve and precision, having lost Cara Dillon's
voice.
Pity anyone having to follow Tweed and Carr, because this performance
bore every symptom of a new benchmark being set.

TESCO'S results this week are likely to confirm the group is inching
ahead of arch-rival J Sainsbury in the battle to be first in the
supermarket league table.
Profits for the year to February are expected to be some #590m before
exceptionals, up from #528m, helped by a contribution from the Wm Low
stores acquired last September and strong pre-Christmas sales.
Tesco has already reported that its like-for-like sales in the 20
weeks to December 31 were 3.8% ahead, while Christmas trade jumped 7%.
These gains were the best in the sector and the out-performance appears
to be continuing.
In the month to the middle of March, Tesco had 19.1% of the packaged
grocery market, against Sainsbury's 18.5%, according to market
researcher AGB.
This market is far from representing the total but the figures give an
indication of how Tesco is beating Sainsbury at the moment.
The group is also being more innovative. Apart from snapping up Wm Low
for #247m, which added 57 stores, Tesco has introduced a loyalty card to
encourage customers to stick to shopping at its stores.
It has pioneered direct contracts with British farmers under which it
has agreed to buy a fixed quantity of vegetables at a guaranteed price,
enabling growers to plan better. Tesco is also developing its Metro
small city centre format and conducting trials of petrol
station/convenience stores.
Chairman Sir Ian MacLaurin will explain how the company is getting on
with integrating the Low stores. They will steadily be changed over to
the full Tesco format over the next couple of years. This is expected to
yield an improved performance.
''Tesco has reacted more quickly, more aggressively to changes in
customer needs . . . and it's paying off,'' declared David Stoddart of
broker Henderson Crosthwaite.

JAPANESE exporters are not usually to be pitied, after all they have
done remarkably well over the years to the extent of dominating entire
industries and running up huge surpluses currently running at $126bn a
year.
Not even an appreciating currency can dent their achievements in
overseas markets -- a 50% rise in the yen against the dollar over the
past decade made no discernible impression in the massive surplus. But
the 10% fall in just over a month which has just occurred cannot be
accommodated in any conceivable business plan.
The immediate effect will not be to provoke a flood of imports into
Japan and a slump in exports. Currency movements may be rapid but they
take a long time to influence trade flows, given long-term commitments
and supply pipelines and hedging techniques.
The dollar is unlikely to stage an early recovery because its decline
reflects the deep-seated economic problems of the endemic trade deficit
and the public sector deficit.
The impact of the sky-high yen, if maintained, will be felt in a
savage squeeze on profit margins eventually leading to widespread
restructuring of whole industries and encouraging even more Japanese
industry to relocate outside Japan. This has in fact been going on for
some time but will have to accelerate.
Mass redundancies are not the Japanese way of doing things but it is
clear that somehow costs will have to be further reduced. This action is
bound to undermine consumer confidence, making the economic recovery
which has eluded the country for so long even further away.
The Japanese authorities have been curiously reluctant to face up to
the problem. The impression is that they are just hoping it will somehow
go away.
In practice their options are limited. The only short-term step they
can take is to reduce interest rates. The Bank of Japan did reduce money
market rates but not the more important discount rate. It can well
afford to do so given that inflation is only 0.2% and most prices are
actually falling.
However, last Friday, the Japanese Government did promise to take
action to stimulate the economy but there is considerable cynicism that
it may again be more rhetoric than anything else.
A stimulus to consumer spending would help the whole economy and
weaken the yen by increasing imports.
At least that should happen. But the authorities have still not done
nearly enough to deregulate and open up the economy, without which
imports will not make rapid progress. Part of the problem is that Japan
is a mirror image of the UK, with a very strong manufacturing sector and
weak retailing and distribution, which is woefully behind the times.
There has been pressure for change, particularly from the Americans,
for years, and now there is internal pressure as consumer bodies realise
that ordinary people have been missing out as a result of hidebound
structures in the retail industry.
Tariffs are not the problem in limiting import penetration. Rather it
is a raft of detailed regulations which has the effect of keeping
imports out. Once more competition is allowed in the consumer will
benefit from lower prices, so reinforcing the trend, which is moving in
the right direction, with import volume last year up nearly 19%. This is
from a low base and the cultural reluctance to buy non-Japanese products
should not be underestimated.
At least the quality of goods produced by Japan's
rapidly-industrialising neighbours has improved out of all recognition
in recent years.
The Japanese Government could have moved a lot faster and so far it
has missed an opportunity with the surge in the yen to do more.
Opening up will have some disadvantages. Manufacturers of certain
consumer goods will find themselves uncompetitive particularly given the
strong yen and high labour costs. But this is already happening as
manufacturers relocate into China and South-east Asia to take advantage
of much lower labour costs and weak currencies, many of which are linked
to the dollar.
It is estimated that a fifth of industrial production by Japanese
companies will be outside the country this year. The proportion can only
get larger and this is making an important contribution to the economic
success of the region.
All industrialised countries face a long-term problem in their ageing
populations but in Japan it is more acute, with a quarter of the
population expected to be over 65 in just 25 years time. And they have
among the longest lifespans in the world. A falling proportion of people
in work will put a break on consumption.
Despite the handicaps there should be no stopping the steadily rising
volume of imports even if the pace could be faster. There should be more
opportunities for Britain to sell other than whisky and Rolls-Royce cars
into a growing, though admittedly still difficult, market.

THIS week's diet of economic news is likely to be dominated by
inflation indicators, at both the retail and wholesale levels.
The RPI figures, due on Thursday, now consist of three main indicators
-- the headline rate, still the one used in wage bargaining, the RPIX or
underlying rate, the one targeted by the Government, and the RPIY rate,
the one favoured by the Bank of England for future targets.
Barring shocks the March figures are expected to be little changed.
Prices are forecast to have risen by 0.3% between February and March.
This would leave all the annual rates unchanged at 3.4% for the
headline rate, 2.7% for the underlying rate, which excludes mortgage
interest payments, and 1.8% for the RPIY measure, which excludes
mortgage interest rates and indirect and local government taxes.
Producer prices today are expected to move in opposite directions.
Sterling gained ground on the chronically weak dollar in March.
So input prices may have stood still, resulting in the annual rate
retreating from 11.4% in February to 10.8%.
But earlier increases in input prices are continuing to feed through
to factory gate prices, which are also being inflated by manufacturers'
attempts to expand margins.
Between February and March output prices are forecast to have risen by
0.4%, taking the annual rate up from 3.6% to 3.8%.
Unemployment figures for March on Wednesday are likely to produce a
further drop of around 35,000. But February's average earnings are
expected to stand still at 3.5%.
January's global trade figures should produce a sharp drop in the
deficit from #1600m to around #800m.
TODAY -- Producer prices (March).
TOMORROW -- None announced.
WEDNESDAY -- Unemployment (March); average earnings (February).
THURSDAY -- Retail price index (March); global trade (January).
FRIDAY -- None announced.

GLAXO has released SG Warburg as its stockbroker and has decided to
appoint Cazenove and Hoare Govett Corporate Services with immediate
effect.
A spokesman for the #25bn market capitalisation pharmaceuticals giant,
which is now digesting its #9000m acquisition of Wellcome, said that
while Glaxo had been satisfied with the Warburg service since 1989, it
had decided in future to have joint brokers.
Warburg missed out on the takeover completely as it was broker to both
companies.
The decision comes as a blow and a further dent in Warburg's morale.
That has been shaken by not only departures of key specialists and a
profits warning but also the breakdown of the merger talks with Morgan
Stanley which left everyone aware that Warburg sees no long-term future
as an independent securities house.

FOLLOWING successes with Tartuffe and The Hypochondriak in Dundee --
plus a run of The Hypochondriak in Finland, translated first into Scots
and then, bizarrely, into Finnish -- director Hamish Glen returns to
Moliere's Bourgeois Gentilhomme, a play he first directed in Edinburgh
six years ago.
The satirical comedies of the seventeeth-century French playwright
have proved themselves well suited to Scottish adaptations; the
combination of a colourful linguistic range and an up-front performance
tradition make a happy match for Moliere's robust and irreverent style.
There are cultural comparisons too -- this earthy adaptation by Hector
MacMillan, retitled Noblesse Obleege, is not only an attack on the
emptiness of nouveau riche values, but also on the fashionable belief
that ''correct'' English is superior to everyday Scots.
Kern Falconer, playing with the physical grace of an arthritic spider,
is the gullible M Jourdain, the ill-educated and newly wealthy
arriviste, determined to hold his own among the quality, and by and
large failing. Totally out of his depth, he is a prime candidate for
exploitation by his entourage of hangers-on.
Cue comedy.
On the whole bright and chucklesome, the production is also a little
patchy, partly because of Moliere's inclusion of several music and dance
interludes which just delay the action, and partly because there isn't
enough of the funny business, the comic routines, the physical slapstick
that the actor-playwright would have worked up in his day.
Despite some strong performances, the show never hits the mad comic
momentum it promises, and the flamboyant closing scene, with its
apposite reference to our own acquisitive National Lottery culture,
seems an over-exuberant finale to the jolly but restrained production
that has preceded it.

AS the man himself said at halfway to half time: ''You're not
expecting to get home tonight, are you?'' For once, he wasn't joking.
The night was young, the gags were queueing up in the wings, the songs
were clearing their throats in the pit (ably accompanied by Kevin
Speight and Irven Tidswell) and emergency supplies of tickling sticks
were fluffed up and ready in the foyer, just in case Kilmarnock's sense
of humour was on the blink.
But how could Kilmarnock resist, even for a minute, Ken Dodd, that
font of glorious goofiness, whose gags-to-stitches routines are
legendary because there's no time to laugh at everything? And, of
course, it didn't, but Dodd kept on behaving as if it might!
In between bravura streams of patter, where a kind of inspired
word-association knocked him on to another skein of material, he
chivvied and teased a capacity audience -- frequently on an individual,
first-name basis.
The intense level of this connection -- the care taken to remember
names, places etc -- isn't simply down to polished, automatic
professionalism. It comes from his own deep-rooted passion for laughter.
Like a gleeful addict, high on others' mirth, he scouts into every
nook and cranny of life -- his own included -- to find the ticklish side
to taxing encounters, sex and marriage, old age, illness. He celebrates
daily incongruities, is archly saucy, freely sentimental, occasionally
surreal -- but, above all, unstinting in making us laugh. Pumpkin hour
struck -- we didn't hear it, we were too busy chorusing Happiness.
. Still, after the dash and force of last season's RSC crop, 1995 is
looking decidedly dodgy.

STEPHEN Gallacher landed the Scottish Champion of Champions title at
Leven Links yesterday by a comfortable four strokes when a
three-under-par final round of 68 fended off the challenge of defending
champion Gordon Sherry and Scottish Boys' champion Steven Young.
Embarking on the final round just one stroke clear of Sherry and Young
the Scottish internationalist had extended that slender lead to two
strokes by the turn, which he reached in one under par. Yet the
tournament was finally decided during two holes on the inward half.
At the short, par-4 fourteenth Gallacher punched a wedge to six feet,
holing his birdie putt, while his playing partner could only muster a
par. And at the 188-yard fifteenth Sherry fired his tee shot over the
back of the green to set up a costly bogey.
Gallacher, meanwhile, maintained his composure and holed a 10-foot par
putt for what proved an unassailable lead.
Young received a timely confidence boost as he prepares to land a
record third successive Scottish Boys' championship at Royal Aberdeen
this week. Before yesterday the 17-year-old had failed to make an
impression in a senior tournament. Leading aggregates:
278 -- S Gallacher (Bathgate) 67, 69, 74, 68.
282 -- G Sherry (Kilmarnock Barassie) 71, 68, 72, 71; S Young

SCOTLAND'S newest arts festival gets under way this weekend and it
promises to be one of the most scenic and surprising events of its kind.
For the Artsfeast, being held to celebrate 20 years of Eastwood
District Council, is going to encompass a variety of picturesque venues,
including some of the most attractive parklands on the south side of
Glasgow and one or two of its most gracious country houses.
Not that this is the Artsfeast's strongest point. With a programme
ranging from Carol Kidd to the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, and with a
full line-up of dance, exhibitions, film, folk music, cabaret, choirs,
ceilidhs, and even a quiz roadshow, this promises to be a week that
Eastwood will not forget.
Venues include Rouken Glen Park and Eastwood Park, which is to be the
site of a superstage for the festival's main events. Indoor events will
be held at Eastwood House, and Greenbank House where the magnificent
National Trust gardens will form a perfect backdrop, as well as at
Eastwood Theatre, the Recreation Centre, and several local churches.
The fireworks start, literally, on Sunday when the huge Eastwood Park
stage hosts Musical Crackers In The Park, featuring the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra in an open-air concert climaxing in Tchaikovsky's 1812
Overture, complete with spectacular display.
Other orchestral classics and favourites will include items from
Bizet, Strauss, Mozart, Verdi, Puccini, and Grieg, as well as extracts
from My Fair Lady.
The next day one of the world's great jazz singers, Carol Kidd, takes
to the same outdoor stage with her band for an Easter Monday afternoon
of great sounds.
Later the nearby Eastwood Theatre is the scene of a performance of
music by Shostakovich, Ben Haim, and Schumann by the acclaimed
Rachmaninov Trio.
Meanwhile, Rouken Glen Park will have been the scene of a Lark In The
Park -- a five-hour family event featuring a Kite Extravaganza with 800
kites on one line, a mile high. Street theatre, mime, sculpture, and a
massive Eggopolis structure for the youngsters to explore will make the
day go with a swing.
If Carol Kidd's visit is the jazz highlight, other hot news is George
Penman's spot at Eastwood House and a performance by the Strathclyde
Youth Jazz Orchestra under Bobby Wishart at Eastwood Pool and Recreation
Centre. Some of the numbers will be accompanied by a spot of
synchronised swimming.
The music of George and Ira Gershwin, and the voice of Elaine Delmar,
will fill the Eastwood Theatre and a sixties disco is to be hosted by
Gary Marshall at the Carmichael Hall.
The Artsfeast, says festival co-ordinator Michael Dale, is not only a
celebration of the district council's 20 years but also a sort of
farewell as the new unitary authorities loom on the scene. It is a
unique event, with a professional content not seen in any festival
previously held in Eastwood.
''We have tried to offer a wide mix,'' says Dale. ''The festival will
appeal to everyone -- for example, there is a concert every night. There
is an antiques roadshow, something for opera lovers, and folk music. In
all, about 15,000 tickets are on sale for the various events.''
The aforementioned opera lovers will no doubt flock to the Eastwood
Theatre to enjoy the works of Puccini, Verdi, Bizet, and Mozart in a
full costume gala of arias, duets, and ensembles from their well-known
works. The event is called Opera On A Shoestring.
Cappella Nova are at the church of St Vincent de Paul in Thornliebank
with sacred and classical music, The Silver Duo are to present a
lunchtime selection of works by Beethoven, Dvorak, and others at the
theatre, and Cabaret With Csardas features romantic works by Puccini,
Lehar, Kern, Gershwin and Lloyd Webber.
There are also folk music, dance, a choir from Copenhagen and our own
Phoenix Choir, archive film of old Scotland, fiddle music, Country and
Western, illustrated talks, and exhibitions.
One man who is going to enjoy the Artsfeast more than most is Eastwood
Provost Leslie Rosin. It is very much his ''baby'' and he has been
involved at every stage of its planning.
''We hope it will be a two-yearly event,'' he says, ''and that it will
alternate with the present civic week, which is also biennial.
''As it is, this one is a marvellous opportunity to celebrate the
district council's 20 years and to mark the approach of the new East
Renfrewshire Council.''
Provost Rosin's mind is clearly on the future: he has personally
sponsored the programme detailing the arts feast's many attractions for
youngsters -- the citizens of tomorrow. The programme is itself a work
of art, shaped like a clown and produced by the council's award-winning
Printing Department.
The Eggopolis, which offers tunnels and spaces in a magical world of
colour, sound and light, will be open at Rouken Glen from the April 15
to 18. There are dance workshops at Carmichael Hall, mask and
puppet-making at Eastwood House, a Glen Michael Cartoon Cavalcade Quiz
Show at the Eastwood Theatre, and free entertainment at Clarkston and
Thornliebank libraries from Mr Bones.
Michael Breck's Magic Party will bring Harvey the Rabbit and a flying
carpet to Eastwood House, which will also host circus workshops where
children will be taught how to juggle or be a clown. Street theatre and
puppet shows will feature at various venues and the concluding event,
The Rite Of Spring, will star 500 youngsters recruited from all over the
Paisley/Renfrew and Eastwood areas.
''The arts feast takes place during the school holidays,'' says
Provost Rosin. ''We ran a feasibility study which showed that 80% of
people stay at home during the Easter break, so this will give the
children plenty to take up their minds.''
The week of festivities concludes with a spectacular community event
at Rouken Glen Park.
This starts with a Family Sculpture Day, continues with performances
of street theatre, dance and music, and climaxes in a torchlight
procession to an enormous bonfire.
The Rite Of Spring should be a fitting end to the Artsfeast, welcoming
a new season with a spectacular firework display.

AT 75, with a big Tate Gallery show on the horizon, Patrick Heron is a
major British figure but, unbelievably, this is his first exhibition in
a Scottish public gallery. So congratulations to the Lillie Gallery,
Milngavie, (till April 30) and the Maclaurin Gallery, Ayr (July 1-24),
which have put together an exhilarating retrospective for our delight.
Heron is a life-enhancing artist whose romance with colour is nothing
short of magical. ''Colour is both the subject and the means, the form
and the content, the image and the meaning of painting,'' he says.
Juxtaposing bright orange, tangy lemon, lush vermilion and strident
scarlet, psychedelic violet, and pulsing emerald green, he fearlessly
creates outrageous combinations which sing and dance.
Recent pictures use a white ground, so that pure colour flickers off
the surface like sunbeams off water. Heron's inspiration is nature in
all its glory -- and particularly the Cornish landscape, where he has
spent much of his life. In 1956 he bought the house of his boyhood,
Eagles Nest, Zennor -- ''very nearly the greatest passion of my life''.
''We live 600ft above sea level near Land's End,'' he says. ''The sea
acts as a huge mirror. The light is electric. The whole place is
illuminated from above and below so that the whites are full of a
strange opalescence. These pictures could not possibly be painted in any
other place.''
His compositions also use colour as well as shape to divide up the
canvas into ''visual acoustics''. The special illusion of tone and hue
is his passion. ''Colours change, depending on what's adjacent. A white
can look pink or blue, lilac or yellow. A jagged line separating two
reds will make them cooler or hotter than a smooth looping or rippling
line. The line changes the colour of the colours on either side of it.
What matters is the reality of the eye.''
Recent paintings use fragments of his beautiful garden, translating
bushes, paths, trellis, and flowers into a repertoire of marks: blobs of
playful yellow and white are ''our daffodils and snowdrops, I can't deny
it. People ask if the garden paintings are figurative or abstract.
They're both.''
The results are challenging -- but Heron is sceptical about a search
for meaning that might impair simple enjoyment of his work.
''I believe it's wrong to make a distinction between intellect and
emotion. Painting is a blind moment of conviction. I often look at a
picture for four days, trying to find the right marks, the right colour
or balance. I walk up and down in front of it -- then a feeling of
certainty comes and I find myself grabbing for the brush.
''In four seconds the last squiggles are complete. The problem is to
hold back; deny oneself the pleasure of painting. I can talk about it in
retrospect, but in fact I go into painting in a blind, ecstatic way. The
last thing one wants is a formula!''
Heron is also a significant writer and critic -- articulating
important issues in art education. In 1971 an article, The Murder of Art
Schools, resulted in a close friendship with Jo Grimond, whom he painted
for the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.
Heron's parents, whose friends included Epstein, Gaudier-Brzeska,
Stanley Spencer, and Paul Nash, positively encouraged his talent. St
Ives was already an artists' colony. He did his first design for his
father's firm, Cresta Silks, from school at 14.
The exhibitions begins with St Ives Market Place 1950, a graphic
picture of cottages, church, and cobbled streets, owned by the Ayr
gallery. The other pictures are lent by Heron. The colour schemes are
redolent of each period, with 1950s oils in dull, dark muddy browns, and
black; the 1960s in psychedelic purples and yellow; optimistic reds for
the seventies, while the 1980/90s are cool and contemplative.
The show is worth seeing for one picture alone: a massive 13 ft oil,
Long Cadmium with Ceruleum in Violet (Boycott) July-November 1977. It's
a stunner: pure, breathtaking, saturated colour. It's also important to
Heron: the last of a 17-year series of what he calls ''wobbly, hard-edge
pictures'', where one colour slots precisely against another to make
optical jazz.
Heron, a Yorkshireman and cricket fanatic, was working with the radio
on while Boycott beat the Australians. Using a tiny Japanese
water-colour brush, beginning at the bottom left corner, he commenced a
marathon application of cadmium red which took nine hours nonstop. To
rest would cause a tidemark, which shows that both sportsman and artist
need stamina.
The Lillie Gallery show is one of six Heron exhibitions currently
running, and another six, stretching from the Kilkenny Festival to
Australia, opens soon. Through them all he is hitting for the boundary
with his disciplined idealism, pure aesthetic judgment, and ardent
wonder at the beauty of the world.

THE long-standing tradition of the Scottish Agricultural College's
role in training is now being organised more formally.
In April last year the Training Services Officer was appointed to
develop and co-ordinate a structured framework for the delivery and
management of training services. The position effectively has two major
roles.
Firstly, there are the organisational aspects that include the
gathering together of information on all training courses provided
throughout SAC. This is essential so that anyone inquiring about a
course can quickly be directed to the appropriate person.
It may sound self-evident but with an organisation as diverse and
extended as SAC it is an important aspect of the work. Not only are
teaching staff directly involved in training programmes but also some of
the advisory staff located in the 24 local offices, as well as the
centre-based advisers and research staff.
Other elements of the organisation side include providing information
on sources of funding for training -- both home-based, such as the Local
Enterprise Companies, and the more arcane European funding programmes.
Equally important in the organisation is assistance on the development
of suitable quality systems to manage the delivery of training. This
links neatly to the second aspect of the work, namely the planning and
development of training.
Clearly, with the expertise of education, consultancy and research
within SAC the major customers for training will be industry and
commerce in the rural sector. This includes not only traditional
agricultural-based industries but also the more diverse rural economy.
Developing new courses that meet not only SAC's internal quality systems
but also the special requirements of the industries is essential to
marketing and promoting SAC's training capability.
These are very important considerations when looking to the future of
how SAC delivers training in ways that make the unique capabilities of
such a diverse organisation accessible to a wider audience. It is
important that the capability for quality education at the three centres
is made available to a wider market by developing open and distance
learning provision and also incorporating the newest technical advances
available by multimedia.
There is no doubt that the training needs of agriculture and rural
businesses are constantly changing. SAC works with those training
providers who can best service the skills training required by a diverse
client base and aim to meet the increasing demand for training to keep
the businesses and communities competitive in the face of change.
The strength of the SAC is in technical, supervisory, management and
specialist training. The range of skills and knowledge of the staff
provides specialist knowledge and expertise for just that.
Rob Cockburn is training services officer, education and training
support unit, Auchincruive.

THERE are increasing signs that Potions may be man enough to follow me
here on Little Ardo's hill. Certainly he has the wit for it even if he
is serving his apprenticeship in the butcher's shop.
He's into freezer sales now, in another desperate attempt to keep the
supermarkets at bay, and I'm really impressed with some of his ducking
and weaving.
Like when the lady who had given him an order for half-a-pig came
bustling in. He could see there was something wrong. ''Pork alright, Mrs
Wilson,'' he said.
''Aye, it wasna bad but there were four trotters and you only got two
on half-a-pig when I was at school,'' said she suspicious that she had
got all the trotters and somebody else had had more than their fair
share of the fillet.
But Potions had the answer, as quick as a flash: ''It must have been
the bottom half that you got, Mrs Wilson. Now I've some nice spicey beef
olives today.'' She was out the door before she had worked it out.
You don't get service like that in a supermarket.
The cattle continue to astound by refusing to lose loads of money. We
have 30 new season calves and I have only seen two being born despite
looking as often as possible and even rising in the night when I hear
the alarm.
I am blaming the diet of treated straw for somehow making the calves
smaller or the cows better at getting them out. At any rate it is
definitely the way forward. I am getting too old for sweating on the end
of a rope.
And this week we sold three odd beasts which somehow missed the sale
last spring. They have been getting about 15lb of cake and treated straw
so I suppose they owed me a bit but how handsomely they paid me back.
The best one was a Blue-grey stot. That is to say it was bluey grey in
colour, though it was by a Simmental bull and out of Blue-grey cow. A
real Blue-grey has to be by shorthorn bull. Anyway, he made 128p a kilo
which was third top of the sale and being 13.5cwt, he grossed #876.
He was a dumpie little fellow and I wouldn't have believed the figure
if I hadn't got the cheque. Even the runtie Black calf, whose mother was
a heifer and hadn't had enough milk to suckle a goat, came to #554. The
three averaged #743 at 22 months old.
The crops are another matter.
''It's nae for me to say, but I was fairly right stopping you growing
that spring barley rubbish,'' Mossie told me on Wednesday. And apart
from the fact that I had seen through spring barley before I met him, he
is quite right. What a disaster it's going to be in the North-east.
There is hardly anything sown and they do say that the yield falls by a
bushel per acre for every day's delay after the first of April.
It has been nearly dry enough for far too long.
Of course, that shouldn't stop them now that the principles of
''plough and plant'' are understood. If they put a six-furrow plough in
front of the drill machine they should be able to sow in just about any
weather; certainly every day for the last fortnight.
But they can't do that. The've got it all ploughed already.
It's a question all winter of ''I'm away to the mart (or the shooting
or the fishing or the fitba or Smithfield). Put the loon awa tae the
ploo and oot o' the road.'' It used to be not a bad idea because that
was getting forward with the spring work. But in a wet spring all you
have achieved is you've let the water in.
Why should I be worrying about the malting barley men being late?
After all there is plenty in stock for my needs as a consumer. But I am
worried.
You see as soon as the boys get scattering their barley seed o'er the
land the pigeons leave my rape alone and go and take the one seed in
four that is traditionally sown for the crows. That time should have
been four weeks ago and, as they have eaten four of my six fields quite
bare, I really want them to stop now.
Everyone is the same, of course, and once more the Vale of Ythan is
like the valley of Ypres during the First World War. Volley after volley
of gas guns, which have grown ever more fearsome, boom out across the
land, causing the pigeons to flutter over a bit.
As you know, I believe that these noisy polluters are so bad for the
farmer's image that I won't use them. I used to think they didn't work
anyway. Now, I have to admit to being less sure. Certainly my crops seem
to have been the tastiest in the district this year.
My preferred strategy is to get my machinery out into the fields to
make them think I'm working there. It has always seemed to work up till
now, but it hasn't been a success this spring.
I used to put so much plant out in the rape fields that Mossie thought
I had gone bust and was preparing for my roup. But now that I have six
fields of rape the machinery is spread too thin to scare a hungry
pigeon.
The Breadwinner has another theory. She has twigged it that the doos
are not fooled by all this plant. They know it is unattended because all
is quiet while the modern farm worker must have his radio blaring at all
times.
We put the old Cavalier and the Ursus in the most eaten field and left
the radio/cassette going full blast. There has not been a doo there for
two days and a coy tinge of green is beginning to reappear.

THE RSC have hardly got off to the best of starts this year. After a
spectacularly strong 1994 season, all of which is due in London in the
coming months, the first two productions, Ben Jonson's The Devil is an
Ass and Romeo and Juliet prove distinctly underwhelming.
Jonson is always a ticklish challenge for contemporary audiences. But
if anyone could make him work it would be Matthew Warchus whose Henry V
with Iain Glen was one of last year's Stratford highlights and who
directed an electric production of Simon Donald's The Life of Stuff at
London's Donmar Theatre. But such does not prove the case here.
A comedy of human gullibility that also lampooned the late sixteenth
century's obsession with the devil by showing that human vice was
infinitely worse than anything He could come up with, it starts off well
enough. An enthusiastic young spirit is sent down to earth to experience
human life for a day in a society awash with an all too familiar
get-rich-quick mentality. (Shades of present day lottery madness.)
Designer Bunny Cristie's jocular green incubus however, soon gets
caught up in an absurdly intricate plot involving a country squire of
stupendous vanity, his long-suffering wife, and a fashionable new cloak.
When you add to this a sub-plot of a dubious con man/super-salesman
(always one scam ahead) and a love interest that involves a male suitor
in drag posing as a Spanish lady to make an assignation with the
squire's wife, you can see the potential for comic mayhem, but it just
doesn't happen.
Despite increasing frenzy, and even such talents as John Nettles as
the pedlar of schemes, Sheila Steafel as the madam of a thinly disguised
brothel, and the incorrigible David Troughton at his most buffoonish,
Jonson's fiendish script and essentially moral tract on the power of
women's virtue remains resolutely intractable.
Nor does Adrian Noble's Romeo and Juliet fare that much better. One
looks in vain these days for his Shakespeare productions that look or
feel as though he actually has some contact with today's world.
With, as Sean O'Casey would say, the world in a state of chassis and
any number of political examples available to Noble to make some
statement on the desperate effects of tribal feuding, he opts for his
usual Freudian psychological hinterland. These young lovers are set in
the midst of a funny mix of sun-drenched, washing-on-the-line Verona and
Edwardian north Europe of stiff crinolines, starched collars, and even
stricter family values.
Noble's Romeo and Juliet is less about two feuding families than
thwarted family dynamics of one. The only way out for Lucy Whybrow's
slightly twee but spirited Juliet is to go for broke -- Christopher
Benjamin's unpredictable patriarch has left her no other way out.
It's an interestingly neurotic re-focusing, if, in the hand of Zubin
Varla's whining Romeo, a lightweight, unerotic one

AIRLINE chief Richard Branson was today held up as an example of how
bosses should deal with customers.
Mr Branson and Virgin Atlantic were seen as providing exactly the
right type of customer care in a survey from the Industrial Society.
According to the society, Mr Branson ''leads by example'' and that
Virgin insisted ''the staff should be happy, cheerful, smiling, friendly
and enjoying their job''.
Virgin was also regarded as a company that listened both to customers
and staff.
Surveying nearly 500 managers and directors, the Industrial Society
discovered:
* Poor quality and late delivery were the things most customers
complained about.
* They also moaned about prices, being kept waiting and ''being passed
around'' when contacting a company.
* Nearly two in three managers are confident or very confident they
are getting customer care right.
* Lack of time was the biggest obstacle to improving customer care.
* Top management commitment, training, a clear policy and good
complaints handling were the most vital ingredients to customer care,
said managers.
''Employers need to realise that the way they behave towards staff may
be directly reflected in the way staff then treat customers,'' said
Colin Thacker Pugsley, the Industrial Society's customer care
consultant.

EDINBURGH was treated to a competition as well as a concert by the
chamber orchestra of the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland last
night. Between Edward Harper's Fantasia V and Beethoven's first
symphony, three young soloists -- a clarinettist, a pianist, and a
singer -- competed for this year's Lasmo Staffa Music Award.
It was the singer, a sonorous Icelandic bass called Tomas Tomasson,
who won on the strength (quite considerable) of his singing of arias
from Macbeth and The Magic Flute. Glasgow, though deprived of the
interest of Derren Coles's witty clarinet playing and Polina
Chersonskaya's rather more serious way with Brahms, Scriabin, and Ravel,
will hear Tomasson in full flood tonight at the RSAMD.
But the rest of the Edinburgh concert held further excitement.
Harper's brassy passacaglia, first heard at the St Magnus Festival a
decade ago, is a strongly etched piece of neo-Britten, filled with
echoes of Peter Grimes, and sponsored by that pillar of the Scottish
Post Office, Ian Barr, in whose memory it was performed on this
occasion.
Conducted by Ernst Kovacic, it gave the evening a splendid, extremely
assured send-off, displaying the young orchestral players to impressive
effect. But so did the robus account of the Beethoven, performed loud
and fast, with real rhythmic impetus and some nicely turned phrasing.
Finally, in celebration of Tomasson's success, came Rossini's Tancredi
overture, vigorously played, but at a tempo that rightly implied a
degree of seriousness behind the high spirits.

A QUIET week before Easter sees company results reduced to a trickle
although they do include some major stocks, including Eurotunnel,
Tarmac, Forte and RMC.
This morning, the City will disregard the forecast #382m loss at
Eurotunnel and instead concentrate on what it has to say on prospects,
particularly as the ferry companies have already sold much of their
capacity forward through newspaper offers for the next three months at
extremely low rates for passengers.
UBS analyst Richard Hannah, who is a long-term bear of the stock,
believes it is not getting the passenger numbers it forecast in May last
year at the time of the last re-financing and will have to ask the banks
and shareholders for several hundred million this year.
However, P&amp;O has conceded that Eurotunnel has won 20% of a market that
expanded by 14% in the first two months of 1995.
Britain's biggest housebuilder Tarmac looks set to announce a
near-doubling of earnings although brokers NatWest Securities believes
strong future profits growth looks uncertain.
The UK housing market remains under pressure, the road market is set
to decline sharply in 1996 and the American housing market is close to
its peak.
A near-doubling of profits, from #55.7m to #103m, is forecast although
the dividend will remain unchanged at 5.5p.
0 Wednesday is dominated by hotels and restaurant giant Forte. It is
being helped by increasing tourist numbers in its London hotels while
the other main engine of growth is its hotels group in Continental
Europe.
Pre-tax profits for the year to the end of January are likely to rise
from #121m to #135m. The dividend payout looks set to increase by 0.5p
to 8p.
The massive construction programme going on in Germany, particularly
the east, will again spell a dramatic leap in fortunes for building
materials group RMC.
Results for the year to the end of December, also on Wednesday, are
likely to show pre-tax profits of #270m against #178m. UK business
accounts for less than 30% of profits.
Shareholders will probably receive a 7% higher dividend payout, up
1.5p at 22p.

DAY three of Edinburgh Folk Festival produced the first sighting of an
Aran sweater and the first near riot, although the two were not entirely
related.
The near riot was caused by an en masse encore by the Sean Keane Band
and Deiseal, or rather the lack of a second en masse encore. The jersey
just happened to be what Keane was wearing at the time -- and as he
comes from Galway, he's entitled to.
He was also entitled to a better sound mix for his set as his voice
lost out to the electric piano and it was three songs in before it
achieved its full resonance in a mandolin and guitar-accompanied version
of Guy Clark's country song, Throwing Good Love After Bad. There were,
too, some nerves which lifted only towards the end when Keane sang Tommy
Sands's Roses, dedicated to the peace process in Ireland, followed by a
light-hearted ditty about the perils of flying when hungover.
There were no nerves with Deiseal. Their's is a relaxed, naturally
flowing music which doesn't so much fuse Irish traditional music with
the adventurousness of jazz and the urgency of funk as suggest that
these musics are simply part of the Irish tradition. Using tin whistle,
bouzouki, and fretless bass guitar, their great strength lies in their
ability to play freely while remaining aware of a tune's inherent
discipline. This was invigorating, uplifting stuff and well worthy of
the excited scenes it elicited.

OPTIMISM in the financial services sector as a whole is continuing to
increase, though confidence is falling in certain categories, according
to the latest survey by the CBI and accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Banks and venture capitalists were the most optimistic, as the economy
continues to improve but building societies reported a decline,
reflecting the dull housing market which is making mortgage business
intensely competitive.
General insurers, finance houses and fund managers were also less
optimistic. The inflow of funds into unit trusts for example has been
disappointing lately.
Overall business volumes in financial services rose by less than
expected over the first three months of 1995. Undaunted, the industry
sees a strong pick-up in coming months, though over-optimism does appear
endemic. Previous surveys show that expectations have run ahead of
results for almost two years.
Paradoxically optimism as regards profitability is at its lowest for
two years, with firms seeing profits probably unchanged in the second
quarter compared with the first.
Employment fell in the first quarter for the first time since March
1994 and further cuts are likely, particularly in life insurance and
insurance brokers.

NEVER mind a stalking horse to challenge the Tory leadership, we are
looking at a dead horse. Who in their right minds would want to lead the
present Tory Party? If a Strathclyde University analysis is correct, on
May 4 they will be left in control of just nine district councils in the
whole of the UK. As a power base, they might as well have none. This
marks disaffection with a Tory Government absolutely unprecedented in
living memory.
On this basis, the Tories are goners. They will be thrown out whenever
the election comes, in two months or two years, whether we get two or
three tranches of tax cuts. Opinion polls have been predicting this
consistently; now we have the Scottish local election wipe-out
highlighting the message, to be followed by further catastrophe in
England and Wales.
A startling fact stands out. In many places shamed
councillor-candidates are disguising themselves as various kinds of
independent -- anything to shed the Tory label -- to gain a chance of
election. This just about says it all as regards what grassroots Tories
feel about their parliamentary party.
The Labour Party cannot promise security of jobs for the middle
classes, or a revival of the property market, any more than the Tories
can. The world has moved on and both party leaders know it. The
difference is that the Tories get the blame for it -- in Scotland, where
the last recession had less effect than elsewhere -- and, devastatingly,
south of the Border.
Now, manufacturing business will prosper under Major or Blair.
Contributions to party funds reflect this. Political gain is escaping
the Tories and there is no sign that this can be turned around. In these
circumstances, the reward of fiscal prudence is election defeat. Damage
limitation is the best that Mr Major can now achieve, if his party will
allow him.
Throughout the erstwhile Tory heartlands parliamentary disunity has
spread like a plague. Ministers pretend to see this as the cause of
their voters' disaffection and they pronounce that revival will come if
only the parliamentary dissidents unite with them and keep their mouths
shut.
If only it were so simple. What about the dissidents' causes, going
right back to the poll tax? They have been popular causes which, it
might be argued, constituency MPs have a duty to embrace. Should London
Tory MPs be castigated when their Health Secretary downgrades or
eradicates great teaching hospitals like Bart's and Guy's? They are
household names across the globe.
Who, in California, say, has ever heard of Virginia Bottomley, the
Secretary of State who tried to do this deed by the stroke of a Commons
Written Answer? Thatcherlike, Mrs Bottomley will tell you that once she
has made up her mind she is determined and not to be deflected. Margaret
Thatcher was several times deflected from folly as it happens, but Mrs
Bottomley apparently is a slice more stubborn than her.
She has the support of the Prime Minister for her reforms which cut
through sentiment and history in order to provide change for efficient
service in the next century. She, and the majority of the Cabinet,
support the Prime Minister in his dire need. All well and good; it is
supposed to be collective Cabinet responsibility.
But holding hands does not stop the ship from sinking. Responsible MPs
(and the nine Whipless ones regard themselves as being responsible) see
this and battle for their local causes. West Country fishing
constituents' wrath at deals done in Brussels has to be expressed. Ditto
the squeeze on school budgets.
Who thought up the desperate wheeze to impose VAT on domestic heating
in two stages? It was not the Tory back benchers, who helped to dump the
second phase. Why do we suppose they did this? The money had to be
raised somehow, as it subsequently was.
They did it because their constituency parties and their voters were
outraged by the plan.
The lesson to be drawn from this, if indeed it is not too late for Mr
Major to benefit from past mistakes, is that it is not sufficient to go
around boasting about taking hard, unpopular decisions. One or two such
decisions may gain eventual applause, but an endless succession of them
just gets you the reputation of being a hard and unpopular Government.
Coupled with this uncomfortable position is a fundamental flaw in Tory
thinking which even now exists in some quarters. It takes no account of
the size of the Government's majority in the Commons. Thatcher did take
tough decisions (privatisation, for example) that were unpopular at the
time. But she had an enfeebled Labour Party to deal with and massive
Commons majorities.
They threw her out when the majority was 93. And then they expected to
carry on in much the same way with a majority of 21. Now the Government
can just about hussle up a working majority although, statistically, it
lacks one. When the hospitals issue is forced to a vote by Labour after
the Easter recess it is doubtful that the Government can manage to avoid
defeat.
What then? What will happen after May 4 and after the Perth and
Kinross by-election? Will Mr Major's leadership be challenged on the
pathetic premise that a new leader will bring new fortunes? Will he
devise some way of demanding a vote of confidence from his own side, not
only in himself, but in all his Ministers too? Will he reshuffle his
Government in July, dumping those who have failed to find favour? Can we
assume a fortnight going by without another resignation due to personal
indiscretion? Would this do the trick? Would those of lost faith
throughout England, Scotland, and Wales then say: ''Hooray, it's all
going to be different now, never did think much of Blair in the first
place''.
I doubt it -- particularly so if the Tory parliamentary party believes
that it can save its own skin by electing a new leader this year. If the
Tories had stuck by Thatcher, allowing, as they supposed Mr Neil Kinnoch
into Downing Street, they might be back in power by now. But the
problems don't change that much, only the people put up to deal with
them.
The trick is how to shade the solutions which are going to be
unpopular at the time; and how to confine yourself to what you can
actually achieve in the political climate of the time. Major apes
Thatcher in doing what he thinks is right and his courage matches hers.
But where is the shading and where is the sense of timing? He plods
along gritting his teeth. Maybe he wants to get as much done as he can
while his time lasts. This impression could provide us with the most
solid evidence of a Government whose time is running out.
It is almost as if the Government itself senses that its position in
power is politically incorrect.

IN trying to gauge what remains of the life-span, I have always kept
George Elrick in my sights, reassured by the fact that my
fellow-Aberdonian was leading his own dance band at the city's Beach
Ballroom well before I was even born. As long as George was still around
there was always hope.
He leads a slightly quieter life at his London home these days but you
can imagine my delight, at a recent charity show in Glasgow, when they
rolled the drums for an unexpected guest and who should come bounding on
stage but the irrepressible figure of Mrs Elrick's Wee Son George, as he
used to be known in those wartime days when he presented Housewives'
Choice on the wireless.
If there had been time for the orchestra to give him a few bars of
introduction that night, George would have been bursting into song with
some of his hits from the past, When You're Smiling, A Nice Cup of Tea
in the Morning, or The Music Goes Round and Round. And him not far short
of his 92nd birthday.
As a small man with a large personality, George was the Scot who went
to London in 1931 and carved himself a remarkable career in popular
music, as a drummer, singer, and band leader before switching to manager
and impresario and shaping up the careers of people like Mantovani and
Scotland's own Lena Martell. He ended up as King of the Grand Order of
Water Rats, the show-business charity for which he raised tens of
thousands.
But whereas he would naturally appeal to my own generation, it did
surprise me to discover the effect he had had on a young Glaswegian,
Nick Low, whose career has had more to do with the management of pop
bands.
Nick was producing the Art Sutter Show on Radio Scotland four years
ago when George Elrick dropped in as the afternoon's guest. ''I was
astounded by his life-story and the fact that he had done so much in so
many different careers,'' he told me.
He never forgot the natty Aberdonian and when he later became an
independent radio producer he decided it was time to tell the George
Elrick story. Low's own instincts were perhaps sharpened by the fact
that he is a great-grandson of E H Bostock, founder of a famous circus
from the past, Bostock and Wombell. Anyway, the BBC's Radio Two jumped
at the suggestion -- and the result of his efforts will be heard a week
tomorrow night (April 18).
Among those queueing up to pay tribute to their old friend are Dame
Vera Lynn, Max Bygraves, and the Beverly Sisters, with their own
recollection of the man who influenced so many artistes' lives.
From those days of leading his Embassy Band at the Beach Ballroom,
Aberdeen, George Elrick was encouraged to London by one of my favourite
pianists and band leaders, the great Carroll Gibbons, who played at the
Savoy Hotel.
George joined the Ambrose Orchestra and also sang with the BBC Dance
Orchestra, led by Henry Hall. As with many a one who succeeds in this
life, he had an unerring instinct for being in the right place at the
right time.
For example, playing at the Southampton hotel where the film stars
would check in from the transatlantic liners, he soon came to know
people like Marlene Dietrich, Dorothy Lamour, Bing Crosby and Humphrey
Bogart.
For his radio programme, Nick Low has dug up precious archive
material, like a recording of George in conversation with Tony Martin
and his wife, Cyd Charisse, at the Waldorf Astoria in New York.
People who met the pawky Scot didn't forget him, which meant that he
collected an impressive array of personal contacts, from Ella Fitzgerald
and Nat King Cole to Doris Day and Gracie Fields, all of whom turned up
in happy snapshots in his autobiography.
There was a memorable night at the old Glasgow Empire when he spotted
Benny Lynch in the audience and invited him on stage for a spot of
sparring. They became friends and the little boxer was soon to know that
the story of the mean Aberdonian was a myth.
With a Scotsman's guid conceit o' himsel', George Elrick has never
made any secret of his belief that, if you want to succeed in life, you
are none the worse of a substantial ego. But sound judgment is even more
essential. And once he had carved out his own celebrity, he applied his
guiding hand to the careers of others, not least Mantovani and his
cascading strings.
Even though most of his own generation are gone, the wee man from
Aberdeen doesn't let the grass grow under his musical feet. In his 92nd
year he will soon be hitting the stands with a CD version of his popular
hits, due from Lismor Records.
Back home in Aberdeen, where his brother Albert is still a well-known
entertainer, his portrait is being presented to the city gallery next
month. Now a widower, George Elrick suffered tragedy when his only son
was killed in an accident. But through it all, he tried to remain ''the
smiling voice of radio,'' the label by which so many remember him from
those earlier days of a remarkable career.

Gavin Bell meets the actress whose most famous line is 'The number you
require . . .'
THE woman with arguably the most familiar voice in Britain lives in a
basement flat in Bayswater, west London, enjoying an anonymity which is
the key to her modest success.
Every day more than a million people pick up a telephone to hear her
dulcet tones. Millions more have heard her on radio and television
extolling the virtues of sundry margarines, stockings, building
societies, and newspapers.
Yet few, if any, could put a name or a face to the disembodied voice.
Even her local greengrocer fails to make the connection when her voice
comes from the radio while they are discussing the price of brussels
sprouts.
The voice is the one which responds to directory inquiries, 500
million times a year, with the helpful announcement: ''The number you
require, is . . .'' The name is Julie Berry, and the face is that of a
pleasant woman looking years younger than her age.
The automated BT announcement is not exactly what Berry had in mind
when she graduated from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama to seek
fame and fortune on the world stage. It is far removed from her studies
in Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, her early starring role as Lady
Macbeth at the Guildhall, and her West End appearances in Daisy Pulls it
Off.
But ''The number you require . . .'' is easily her longest-running
performance, leading to other ''voice-over'' contracts with Northern
Telecom in Canada, and the narration of a wide range of corporate
videos. Berry would have liked to have been a star, of course, but she
has become reconciled to her anonymity being a valuable professional
asset.
''I sometimes get itchy feet for the theatre,'' she says in those
familiar, cultured tones, ''and I'd always hoped for a TV sitcom. But
the fact that I'm not a well-known face as an actress is useful for
advertisers, because nobody associates my voice with a particular role.
So being incognito has its advantages.''
Berry is amused by a suggestion that she is Britain's most popular
''call-girl'', but observes that it is not necessarily true. ''I
remember hearing a woman at a party complaining about 'that dreadful
woman on directory enquiries'. It creased me up to think I was standing
next to her at the time.''
Thanks to a ''very wizzy computer'', she was not required to recite
all of the 27 million numbers stored on the BT enquiry system, but the
assignment still required more than 50 hours of hard work.
''It sounds an easy thing to do, but actually it is quite a skilled
craft getting all the inflections right. They said they wanted a warm
and friendly voice, not too cool, so I tried to achieve a lightness of
mind that would suggest a smile in my voice. Doing that hour after hour
wasn't easy.''
Berry's voice is undoubtedly English, but placing it is difficult
since her announcements betray no regional accent. For the record, it
comes from Cheltenham in Gloucester, where she grew up with her English
father and Scottish-Irish mother.
Since her first performance for BT six years ago, Ms Berry has
discovered another role for herself -- as a spiritual medium. It
happened when another medium recognised a kindred spirit in her, so to
speak, and shortly afterwards she found herself communicating with a
young man who had died six months before.
''A voice can be a healing thing,'' she says. ''Maybe there is a
vibration in my voice that helps people in distress.''
BT has not yet established communications with the spirit world. But
if ever it does, it might find Berry's disembodied voice the perfect
medium.

FAR from being defeated at Culloden (Scotland's Homes, April 5),
Montrose had been dead for nearly a century before that battle took
place.
Furthermore, the battles of Auldearn and Alford were not the last of
his victories; he had one more, at Kilsyth in August 1645, before his
defeat at Philiphaugh a month later.
After some years of exile on the Continent, Montrose returned for a
last disastrous campaign in 1650 which ended with his defeat at
Carbiesdale. He was executed in Edinburgh on May 21, 1650, nearly 90
years before Culloden.

The driving force which is
pushing Marcella Evaristi
along the road to become
an independent mobile mother
My lifelong love affair with taxis is over. Thanks for the times when
I sat in back feeling self-righteous
I must conquer my fear -- otherwise I'll spend the rest of my life
walking to pick up my children
I HAVE a dream where I am in great danger, or someone else is in great
danger and I have to go for help or else calamity will follow and the
dream imperative is that I must get into a car and drive. But the car is
not an escape route for me, who cannot drive, it is the next step for
the serial terror. Starting the engine is as easy as falling off a
cliff.
I swing out from behind a parked car and onto the main road. I am
overtaken, gestured at, flashed at, toot-ed at: the red traffic light
approaches me, it is speeding towards me, this evil eye at the end of
the tunnel, but I can't slow down, I don't know how to, besides if I
stopped, how could I restart and I have to get to this destination -- so
I press down a pedal, I wheel-clutch, I pump away with my feet. I'm in
the dodgems from hell.
This chromium clinker is hurtling along in the dark with me in its
middle and I'm joining up the dots of cats' eyes at a million miles an
hour as giant lorries loom up and evaporate, when suddenly the place
where I'm supposed to be arrives, and I welcome the oncoming wall like a
lucky parking space, and without braking, I wake up.
So, you have a recurrent dream you're jumping off the top of the
Eiffel Tower, or you're buried alive and scratching at the coffin's
satin lining: you wake up, clock the time, and the fact that you're
conscious, and you put, as far as is possible, your hee-bee jeebies in
proportion.
And that -- for the waking-time being -- is that. You do not take an
impetuous notion to fly to Paris for the weekend. You do not emulate
Sarah Bernhardt's sleeping habits. (The Divine Sarah slept in a coffin:
to remind her of mortality, I assume. Weren't mirrors enough?)
But my situation is different. After my recurrent four-wheeled dream,
I wake up and remember that I am beginning driving lessons next week.
Like an agoraphobic taking a walking holiday on the Yorkshire moors,
like an insomniac swopping Ovaltine for amphetamines, I, of my own free
will, am going to get into a car and sit in the gadgetry as opposed to
the glove compartment seat. In order to stave off the accelerating panic
attack which slammed on my chest as I wrote that sentence, I am going to
jot down ... (I can tell I'm lying to myself, using a word like 'jot'.
One of the language's giveaway words of bad faith. 'Opined' is another
one.) Anyway, I'm going to write down a list of reasons why, hand on
palpitating heart, I want to drive, need to drive, look forward to
driving (when I never did before).
(1): I never had children before, and now I need that licence.
My lifelong love affair with taxis is over now. Thanks for the good
times though, when I sat in the back feeling ecologically
self-righteous, nodding in responsible agreement at those articles
railing against the polluting madness of the car culture, inhaling my
Marlboro with indignation. And the polemic was accurate with its vision
of the single driver in the single car revving and racing in pathetic
competition with strangers through fug and motorway ugliness:
financially unjustified and environmentally disastrous. The clogged
cities, our lead poisoned lungs, our lacerated landscapes all suffered,
whilst public transport was left to run down, a Thomas the Tank
anachronism, chugging against the fast-lane flow.
So why the gear change? Surely having children should increase my
eco-concern: aren't their little lungs at risk too, and shouldn't masks
be kept for Halloween, not for cycling to school through toxic traffic?
How can I justify this recidivism? To these questions I decide to
answer: 'Quite right. I'll cancel the lesson. I'll go back to sleep.'
But that's bad faith, too. The truth is I must conquer my fear because
otherwise it seems that without a car, I will spend the rest of my
foreseeable life walking to pick up one child from one activity whilst
dragging a second tired child, shoe-scuffing behind me. No time to go
home between the overlaps, we sit in cafes, ordering additives and
girning. No more, I would rather be a chauffeur than a trudger. I know
it sounds weak, but I can't afford to buy a car anyway so I'm going to
postpone my guilt till I can.
Driving will mean that I am less dependent, that I can leave the
party, the pandemonium, the premises, precisely when I want to. I will
not always be beholden. I no longer want generous friends feeling
obliged to run my children and myself home because the boundary charge
is a rip off. And perhaps it is bogus, but in a way I never felt before,
gaining a licence feels like a late rite of passage. I hate that
overused word 'empowerment', but that's what I want from driving, dodgy
as it might be, qualified as it should be. Because I am sick of that
back seat: passive pig in the middle, a child on either side of me,
thanking the grown-ups in the front for the lift.
I hate the following sentences with all my ingrate soul: ''That's
fine, no really, just anywhere here will be great. Thanks.'' (A bundle.
Would have been better off with the bus).
''Oh, you're leaving in another hour, no, that's fine, really.''
(Could have bloody said).
''We'll easily pick up a cab from here, really.'' (If we say a
novena). I know, I know, I sound so selfish, but I don't want a gift
horse, I want a Fiat.
(2) Practical considerations aside, I am beginning, finally, to see
the other attractions. Let me reverse on that one. I am getting a door
handle on the sexy aspect. You know when images come to you in that
drowsy state just before sleep? Well, there was I thinking
hypnagogically, for that is the word for it, about this lover I once had
who drove brilliantly, recklessly fast. He seemed to change gear from
his shoulder and he bit the left side of his perfect lower lip when he
was turning left. I pretended to his profile that he should slow down. I
think I have just 'outed' myself as regards the eroticism of men and
cars.
Then there is Nicole ('Papa?') from the Renault advert. Whenever I get
tense about three-point turns I shall imagine myself racing down a
French country road, to that theme music, raising mischievous eyebrows
and biting the right side of my lower lip as I turn right and make for
the Mediterranean -- racing to show the children, sitting in the back of
my car, the journeys I made as a girl with my sister and parents:
driving from Glasgow to Italy every summer, through France and
Switzerland and the curvy descent down the coast past Rapallo towards La
Spezia.
I will concentrate, when I stall, as I am bound to, on that yellow
painted grid thing on Byres Road, witnessed by the world and his wife, I
will concentrate on Coltraine, road-runner Robbie and his fab Cadillac
cruising through America. My personal mythology of freedom and moving on
and corny escape demands a car now, as it never did before. These days I
associate walking with shorter paths: the rush to the shops not the rush
to the heart.
I will be Thelma-Louise with a happy ending, I will not drive over the
cliff, I will not cancel my lesson.
So what if I failed three times already? That was a long time ago. And
the third time, I was unlucky, I should have passed, honestly. Not the
first time, though, I have to admit. But then I had this creepy
instructor, who on finding out that I was studying English at
university, embarked on his tortuous theory about D.H. Lawrence. I'd be
wondering aloud exactly why I should find a middle point on the back
windscreen, when he'd start explaining about middle class male impotence
and the sexual prowess of miners. I was nearly out of the car, thinking
he'd meant 'minors'. I was just 17, you know what I mean?
Well, I blame him anyway, with his flaccid class chip on his dandruffy
shoulder. During the test I was robotic. I would look in the mirror and
stare at my eyeshadow. I imagined the lines of sweat running from
underarm to waist were wooden props holding me upright. I wanted to stop
behind the bus in front and join the queue, where I belonged, amongst my
own kind. The examiner was obviously an ex-military man, his alternating
commands of Left then Right then Left so utterly confused my already
fragmented psyche that all memory of which was which disappeared. 'Left,
please. Left at the next turning.' Then I remembered that when I was
five my way of remembering left from right was to make the Sign of the
Cross. The hand which automatically poked me on the forehead was Right.
So that's what I did, every time he issued a directional command. I
began to relax. I had found my strategy. I was on course now.
He failed me. Wouldn't even let me recite the Highway Code. (I was
sign-perfect). But perhaps I shouldn't blame myself, maybe I was quite
good after all and he was a rabid Orangeman.

SIR Alan Smith raised a number of very valuable points based on his
considerable industrial experience. In particular he dealt with the
matter of top executives' pay, which is currently the cause of much
discussion (April 4).
He suggested that they should be linked to share price. This is an
unreliable basis, on its own, as many factors other than the efforts of
management can affect this. The recent impact on power shares of a
decision by the watchdog is only one example. An approach which is
gathering pace in the USA is Shareholder Value, and this can be compared
with the movement of a company's sector as a basis.
However, research which I am currently undertaking suggests a
compounding of the problem. So far, a few sectors have been analysed to
compare the emoluments of the top directors in relation to their
companies' size, sector, and performance. Preliminary results from
studying 105 engineering PLCs, with a total turnover of #52.5 billion,
shows that the tendency is for excessive pay to lie with the less well
performing companies and vice versa.
Of the 53 companies with below average performance, based on a mixture
of criteria measuring returns and wealth creation, 33 were paying their
highest paid director more than was expected for their size and only 22
less. Above the middle performance level only 20 were paid more than the
predicted amount for their size and sector while 32 were paid less.
This is surely the opposite of what is needed and what most people
expect. I doubt if many of these directors use the same logic when
designing payment systems for their junior employees.
There is perhaps one logical reason for the above pattern. Are the
higher-performing companies better at controlling all of their costs and
that is why they are better? Maybe one of the features of the
under-performing group is that they are less capable of controlling
their total costs and that is why they are under-performing.
Should there be an acknowledged level of performance, for a sector,
which must be achieved before any golden handshakes or share options can
become effective and, thereafter, on a scale? Would this not both
prevent many of the abuses whereby those responsible for poor
performance walk away with large sums and also concentrate the minds of
those who remain.

OUR Government has introduced accountability, cost-effectiveness, and
insecurity into all our lives whilst indicating complete satisfaction
with the last 15 years of their ''achievements''. It is impossible to
believe that they are so detached from the reality of their inadequacy.
My proposals for a gradual change to a more accountable Govermment are
simple and not revolutionary to the bulk of the working community.
I suggest that all prospective parliamentary candidates should submit
a sealed bid indicating how much they require to do the job. Collective
pay bargaining should be abolished for MPs and their incomes and rises
based on a formula which takes into account the size, wealth,
population, and industrialisation of their constituencies.
Bonuses should be paid for attendance at Parliament or for committee
work. Alternatively, deductions should be made for non-attendance.
A proportion of the ruling party's income should be withheld until the
end of their period of office and paid out or withheld until the end of
their period of office and paid out or withheld on a formula based on
the increase of Gross Domestic Product and reduction in the National
Debt.
Government Ministers should be paid on a formula based on the average
of public company managing directors with a performance bonus based on
past performance of their departments.
Others will think of better and more refined ways of bringing our
political leaders to a realisation of how they have changed our lives.
It is not sufficient that they submit themselves to our vote every five
years.

THAT a committee of their peers has merely suspended two MPs for
agreeing to take cash for questions, whatever its destination, is a
greater scandal than any we have seen so far from an already discredited
Government. And only a further lack of moral sense is behind their
efforts to defend themselves.
What the public expect, and have a right to demand, is that its
representatives do not take parliamentary action for their own gain or
that of favoured charities.
Yet, as this decision was cross-party, we are compelled to conclude
that MPs are too afraid for themselves to take the action required,
which means they themselves have no moral sense. Until they put their
house in order, it will remain defiled and untrustworthy.

YOU said in your leader column: ''The quality of debate on the issue
of devolution in Scotland has been pitiful'' (March 28). You might now
turn your attention to the quality of debate on European Monetary Union
and, in particular, some of the contributions made by Murray Ritchie.
He avers: ''The next best thing (about EMU) is that it will keep
politicians' sticky fingers off our money'' (April 3). His further
comments were couched in the same derogatory style and so superficial as
to be hardly worth making. If his articles are a true reflection of his
understanding of EMU he must inhabit a different planet from the rest of
us.
It is a strange kind of democracy which would deny control of monetary
policy to elected representatives in order to place it in the hands of
unelected bankers and bureaucrats.
Has the role of the Bank of England in economic forecasting over the
past two decades been any more accurate than that of successive
Chancellors? Has it even fulfilled its responsibilities as a regulator
in light of the BCCI and Barings' scandals?
Given the economic conditions which currently prevail in the rest of
the EU, have the other central banks been any more successful than the
Bank of England? Even the much vaunted Bundesbank cannot be absolved of
its share of the responsibility for the 20 million or so now languishing
on the dole throughout the EU.
Not a single member state which has signed up for EMU, except
Luxembourg, satisfies all the conditions for entry. Ironically the UK
does, but Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece fail on all of them;
Finland and Sweden fail on two out of four -- as do Belgium and the
Netherlands; and Germany, France, Denmark, Austria, and Ireland fail on
one out of four.
Public debt is so high in the Netherlands and Belgium that the former
could be ready by 2008 and the latter by 2009, providing the Dutch
achieve an average growth of 4% per year until then and the Belgians
achieve an annual surplus on their budget of 6%, which is twice their
current average.
There is not the remotest possibility that EMU will be achieved by all
member countries by 1999. It is a fact that EMU will not only lead to
political union, it requires political union. It means more than getting
rid of exchange costs. It means a single economic and monetary policy
applied to each member state, whether or not it is appropriate.
It will also affect fiscal policy and budgetary control or how much we
can spend on the NHS or education. In other words, it will affect every
economic and therefore every political decision that will be taken in
every member state.

As someone with a professional interest in transport I was surprised
to find that the words ''bus'' and ''coach'' appeared only twice each in
your 16-page supplement on the transport conference -- and then it was
in an advertisement: 76.6% of all public transport passenger journeys in
Britain in 1993/4 were by bus or coach, and they accounted for 50.2% of
total passenger kilometres. Almost 90% of public passenger vehicle
kilometres is by bus and coach.
The health of Scotland's bus and coach industry is of vital importance
to our economy. As more cars pour on to our roads, buses will become
even more important in easing congestion, particularly in our towns and
cities.
Today, there is a range of developments in the bus industry which open
up prospects for making buses more attractive to passengers.
These include the ''kneeling'' bus, whose entrance is lowered at stops
to make it more accessible to those with impaired mobility, or bairns in
buggies; transponders which allow bus priority at junctions; ''smart''
payment systems; the refinement of diesel engines with much reduced
exhaust emissions; gas-fuelled and electric buses; and the development
of ''real time'' displays at bus stops.
Any comprehensive discussion of a transport strategy must take the bus
into account, especially here in Scotland, home to the world's largest
builder of double-deck bus bodies (Alexanders of Falkirk) and Britain's
largest bus chassis builder (Volvo of Irvine).

WHEN a Biblical prophet advised his hearers that one day ''the Kings
of the East would rise in their might'' he was not talking about
shipbuilding.
It is in this area, however, that the truth of his prediction has come
home to us Western shipbuilders, and although I regret the loss of our
commercial ability to quote for the construction of great ships of the
Oriana type, I am glad that at least one Western shipbuilder could
attract the business (April 4).
I note that the chairman of the P&amp;O line has stated his view that one
day the UK would regain its place and be able to tender for a fine ship
of this type, a ship which will, let's face it, be crammed with
equipment that would provide work for designers and manufacturers
representing more than 75% of the quoted price of the vessel.
If I may make a suggestion it would be that the professional bodies
which represent the practice of naval architecture and shipbuilding in
this country leave aside their academic discussions for a short space of
time and apply their talents to some political effort aimed at making
this prediction come true.

<TEXT>
PHIL TROTTER's article on the financial problems of Balnain House
highlighted an important issue on funding for the traditional arts
(April 6). Traditional music is not an expensive art-form and events
have been taking place for years without any significant level of
subsidy and what subsidy was provided arguably had little or no effect
on many of the events or ''projects'' concerned.
A concert of traditional music does not have the overheads of, say, an
operatic or orchestral concert. The Celtic Connections event has
demonstrated publicly what those involved already knew, that this music
is popular and audiences will turn out. To maintain the status quo
funding is not a big issue. To move forward and develop it is.
He also touches on the benefits of music to the Irish tourist industry
but we can perhaps give too much credit to the Irish Tourist Board for
its part in encouraging this music. It didn't create the music, all it
is doing is using it effectively. Projects like Balnain House may wish
that the Scottish Tourist Board used music in a similar way.
In Scotland there is a huge increase in music-making among young
people. It is not being created for the benefit of the tourist industry
but it does have direct economic and social benefits.
In the past few years there has been general recognition of the fact
that there is little infrastructure for traditional music in the way
that there is for say opera or ballet. In these fields you can phone up
organisations during the day and talk and have meetings with their
management.
If you wanted to talk to most of the organisers of quite substantial
traditional music festivals, you will need to do it in the evenings or
the weekend. During the day they are out at work. The Scottish Arts
Council has identified this problem and is trying to make some changes.
Organisations which want to work on a full-time basis, like Balnain
House, find it difficult to reach the point where income from projects
build up to a level to meet their overhead costs. Without secure revenue
funding (core funding which allows them to exist), they remain in a
position where forward planning for the very projects that will bring in
revenue is restricted and it is clear that development is being
distorted.

CONGRATULATIONS to the women of Hawick who are threatening a
''protest'' over their exclusion from the annual Common Riding
ceremonies (April 3).
I have been at the Common Riding for the past eight years (as the
fiancee of a Hawick man) but have yet to hear a good reason for banning
women from riding behind the Cornet (the festival principal).
The official argument that women might fall and hurt themselves is
plainly ridiculous, particularly when boys as young as six or seven take
part. I should have thought an age limit was more sensible than a gender
limit.
The other argument that it's ''aye been'' also does not stand up to
scrutiny since women were allowed to ride up until 1931 when there seems
to have been some kind of tacit agreement among the men to ban them.
One of the reasons that the Common Riding has survived for so long is
precisely because over the years the traditions have adapted to suit
their times. If it is to continue to flourish and to have meaning and
relevance to all the people of Hawick, then the anachronistic and
discriminatory attitudes and practices will have to change.

IT IS possible that only pensioners recall the years when hunger was a
daily experience. Two ounces of cheese a week, four ounces of bacon, two
of tea, and 1s 10d worth of meat . . . In the darkest days even onions
were scarce, and there came a time when a single egg a week was cut to
one a month. Rationing may have been excellent for the nation's health,
but it did little for the appetites of growing children. Even the Queen
had her ration book, serial number CA 469718, and if the Ministry of
Information is to be believed, George VI insisted that his family
suffered with the rest of the nation. Small wonder that children often
spent their pocket money on bread, or that minor luxuries loom so large
in wartime memories. Some pensioners declare that even baked beans no
longer taste as good as their stodgy equivalent of the 1940s.
A reminder of wartime food came with the curious revelation recently
by Sir Charles Powell, Baroness Thatcher's former private secretary,
that when the Prime Minister was hungry, she would hurry to the House of
Commons canteen for a plate of Spam and fried eggs. ''She would urge me
to choose the same, even though I didn't like it at all,'' he said. As a
grocer's daughter, the young Margaret Roberts would have known all about
rationing and the items that some shops kept under the counter for good
customers. She was only 13 when war broke out, and when the pink
luncheon meat started to arrive from America, she may have been among
the first to taste it. There is no surer proof that Councillor Roberts
was an incorruptible civic leader, the grocery trade's equivalent of
George VI, than that, for his daughter, Spam has remained a delicacy.
It is, we believe, still to found on the shelves of supermarkets,
probably not far from the bully beef, pilchards, sardines, and other
items once hoarded for special visitors. The only food that seems to be
missing from those days is snoek, a voracious and ill-favoured fish from
the coasts of Africa. If it is marketed at all these days, perhaps under
an assumed name, it is probably for the poorer sorts of cat. Like
Woolton Pie, the most elaborate method ever devised to ruin good
vegetables, there are some things that even hungry children will not
eat.

SISKINS invaded this street recently and proceeded to take nuts from
bird-feeders. I have looked up various birdbooks and cannot find
reference to this species in suburban gardens. I am sure it is a first

Ian Bruce, Defence Correspondent, reports how battles of the future
are likely to be dominated by computers and smart weapons, but the
casualties will -- as ever -- be humans
SOLDIERS fighting the wars of the twenty-first century may never come
into personal contact with the enemy, waging hi-tech battles at long
range with precision-guided weapons capable of being redirected in
flight.
But the really damaging blows may well be struck in cyberspace, the
separate universe occupied by computer networks. Information-warriors
deploying ''software bombs'' could become the ultimate deterrent.
As one expert explained: ''Why send manned bombers or even cruise
missiles to destroy Colonel Gaddafi's residence in downtown Tripoli when
you can wipe out his personal finances and the holdings of his country
worldwide by viral electronics?''
Strategically, cyber-strikes could also be used to paralyse
command-and-control computers and disrupt enemy communications. An
electronic blitz might even wipe out all air-traffic control over an
entire country or continent with catastrophic results.
Five separate American think-tank groups are exploring the
possibilities for a US military which is devoting increasing resources
to RMA, Pentagon-speak for revolution in military affairs.
General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff,
their high command, says: ''The 1991 Gulf war was only a snapshot of
what is to come. It was a combination of hi-tech and traditional brute
force applied with surgical skill.
''What we have now set in motion is an entirely new era in warfare.
What we are changing is the very nature of modern battle. We have
reached a watershed in mission-planning and the means to carry out those
missions.''
One item already at the development stage is a tiny television camera
which can be attached to the sights of a rifle, enabling commanders at
headquarters miles behind the front lines to have a ''grunt's-eye-view''
of the action. With satellite links, the joint chiefs could watch a
firefight in Somalia as it happens from the comfort of their
conference-room chairs in the Pentagon.
Another project still on the drawing board is a US Navy cruise missile
which can be signalled at any stage in its flight to change targets,
using its own computerised, terrain-following radar to map out a new
course.
The existing versions, as used against targets in Iraq, are ''smart''
only in the respect that they can follow a single pre-programmed route
and use video-camera technology to home in on a single pre-selected
target. But once launched, they are strictly one-way traffic.
Admiral Bill Owens, deputy head of the joint chiefs, and a leading
proponent of the new reality, explained: ''This is no longer a Flash
Gordon type of thing. The technology and the systems for our concept of
future warfare either exist right now or are just around the corner.''
A key element in the new strategy is what the Americans, in their
inimitably verbose style, describe as ''dominant battlefield
awareness''. It boils down to surveillance which can pinpoint all enemy
movement and the ability to relay that intelligence to the relevant
commanders in time to allow them to do something about it.
New satellite technology and infra-red scanning will, over the next
few decades, create a situation where there is literally nowhere on
earth to hide offensive forces on land or sea. The day of nuclear
submarine invisibility, and therefore relative invincibility, is passing
rapidly.
Much of the new-wave technology can be tested relatively inexpensively
by computer simulation. One recent war game played by Pentagon planners
envisaged an invasion of South Korea by its northern neighbour, an event
well within the bounds of possibility.
Commanders playing the allied defenders finally repelled the invasion
and won. But without ''total battlefield awareness'' it took them 28
days and involved huge casualties.
When the game was replayed, allowing the allies complete knowledge of
enemy movements, the North Koreans were stopped in their tracks and
thrown back in just three days.
So much for theory. For while the technology for instant command links
already exists, there are still many problems to overcome to translate
that ability into operational practicality in the heat of action.
In April last year, two US Blackhawk helicopters were shot down over
northern Iraq by patrolling US fighters who mistook them for enemy
aircraft breaching the United Nations' no-fly zone. A total of 26
crewmen and senior UN officers, including two Britons, died.
Technically, it should not have happened. There was an
''eye-in-the-sky'' AWACs airborne command aircraft in the area. In a
perfect world, it would have scanned the area with powerful radar and
informed the fighters that the helicopters were friendly. The AWACs
commander now faces court-martial for failure to do so.
The other major obstacle is natural human reticence to grasp anything
new. From the cross-bow to the tank, the military has resisted major
change in its methodology.
All branches of the American services are currently co-operating with
the project, mainly because, politically, they see no other choice at a
time of falling budgets. But the time for digging in heels on the basis
of inter-service rivalries cannot be postponed indefinitely.
Each has its own, self-serving priorities. When these become
threatened, as they inevitably must, then the daggers will be unsheathed
and no prisoners taken in the corridors of power.
Andrew Marshall, the 73-year-old strategist who has played godfather
to RMA, said: ''The initial tasks are intellectual rather than
practical. We have to see where we are going with this, and understand
where new technologies might take us.''
The Gulf war may well prove to be the last of the world's big,
set-piece wars fought with masses of men, armour and aircraft carriers.
The very spread of technology wil probably mean that task forces for any
kind of conflict will have to be small, highly mobile and cloaked by
stealth technology to avoid destruction by precision weaponry.
The irony is that the very spread of technology, the lifeblood of the
military art, is hastening its own end in traditional terms. Somalia's
situation is perhaps indicative of the way forward.
Apart from a few battered pick-up trucks, the roving gangs who rule
that land operate in a time-warp, using camel-borne transport as old as
the desert itself. Yet the American forces who went in to try to restore
order landed by sea and not by air because the camel-drivers also had
heat-seeking, anti-aircraft missiles.
Microchip and camel still operate in harmony there, but the dominance
of the camel, like that of the traditional military in the West, is
about to be by-passed on the information super-highway.

'TIS sure that I had a certain advantage over Bernard Jenkin MP. I had
Jack MacGregor with me in the Speaking Out studio, while Mr Jenkin was
contributing from the deep south. So Bernard could not have been aware
that Jack was a dapper senior citizen turned out as if for church parade
in dark blazer and military style necktie. But he did know that Jack is
the tireless driving force behind the Disablement Income Group, which
made it all the more crass of this Tory member of the Select Committee
on Social Security to try to persuade listeners that they were dealing
with some wild-eyed, red-hued, political activist hell bent on
denouncing a dutiful Government.
In retrospect, in fact, it may have been a serious dereliction of the
BBC's duty to balance in broadcasting to let Bernard loose on the
airwaves just 24 hours before Scotland went to the polls. His
belligerent insistence that this week's changes in benefit for the sick
and disabled were a timely assault on an army of leadswingers might well
have been worth several thousand votes to Scotland's opposition parties
in the council elections.
In essence the changes mean that from this Thursday people receiving
sickness or invalidity benefit move on to the new incapacity benefit, as
does anyone who applies on the grounds of disability in the future. This
latest attempt to ''streamline'' and ''simplify'' the world of benefits
will have several very dramatic effects on those people too ill or too
incapacitated to work.
If they qualify on the higher rate of benefit they will, for the first
time, be taxed on it. And new claimants qualifying for the first time
will find the level of benefit available greatly reduced from the
previous rates.
Then there are the tests. Interestingly, for the first time, part of
these involve the sick or the disabled assessing themselves. This
entails answering several hundred questions about your ability to
perform tasks such as climbing stairs unaided or walking independently.
The object of the exercise is not any more to assess your ability to do
the job you once did . . . but to find out if you can do any kind of
work at all.
So, for the sake of argument, if you happen to be an ex-miner unable
to work because your lungs have packed up, these tests can establish
that there's absolutely nothing wrong with your hand-and-eye
co-ordination. There's not the slightest little thing preventing you
from becoming an ace seamstress. The fact that you don't as yet know
which end of the needle is up needn't count against you. After all are
there not all these wonderful retraining programmes for people
enterprising enough to understand that brave new worlders can't hang
about at home while there are new employment fields to be explored?
The beauty of these tests is that while you have no idea what your
answers mean in terms of benefit, the benefits agency doctor who reads
them does. He or she is working from a very precise points system, with
all of your answers adding up to an overall score. Naturally the
Government wouldn't rush at this revolution without a little field
sample.
My information is that one of the ways in which they undertook the
research was to ask some DSS staff to fill in the forms themselves. They
did. And apparently 80% of the respondents in one pilot scheme
disqualified themselves from being eligible.
Of course the test is not the only arbiter. The DSS doctor will also
have information forwarded from your own GP, and will do a personal
medical lasting around 45 minutes. Not a massive amount of time in which
to guage the individual's case history, but there we are. Time's money
(yet it will be a civilian adjudicator, not the doctor, who makes the
final ruling).
And while we're on the subject of money, the Government has done
another piece of advance research. Now you and I might think it odd that
a department can calculate savings before a single supplicant has gone
through a single medical or filled in a single form. But Social Security
Secretary Peter Lilley clearly has a greater mathematical grasp than the
rest of us.
His department confidently predicts that in the first three years of
the new benefits #3.2billion will be taken out of payments to the sick
and disabled.
Not only that, they've figured out how to do it with a series of
calculations guaranteed to warm the cockles of the Treasury's heart.
Almost a quarter of a million people currently on invalidity payments
won't remain on the new incapacity benefit. And some 85,000 people on
income support who have a disability premium will find the latter
disappears.
Then there are the new claimants. Apparently some 160,000 people who
would have got invalidity benefit simply won't pass the new tests, and
another 35,000 won't be eligible for a disability premium. At a stroke
the department saves millions; at a stroke the most vulnerable are
mugged.
It would be idle to pretend that some of the people currently claiming
benefits on the grounds of ill health are not doing so fraudulently. But
ask DSS officials privately about this and they will concede that the
numbers are not massive. In fact given the dismal levels paid out for
the so-called safety net of income support, it's remarkable that more
people have not tried to top it up on the grounds of supposed
disability.
The Minister's view is that these benefits have spiralled out of
control. In any case, he says, the definitions have become blurred over
the years. These benefits were never intended to be confused with
payments for becoming unemployed. True enough. Though that didn't stop
the Government tacitly encouraging people to move on to invalidity to
massage the out-of-work statistics.
But anyway Mr Lilley now has the double up . . . cutting payments to
the sick and disabled and reducing the period people made redundant can
claim earnings-related support. Makes you proud to be British? Not a
lot.

RANGERS vice-chairman Donald Findlay argues for the abolition of the
three-foreigner rule. Indeed, he did so in this very paper only last
week.
He peddles the notion clubs should be able to deploy players of any
nationality in European competitions and he talks about the restriction
of free movement of labour between countries. The transfer system is
also a restriction, but so far neither Rangers nor any other club has
rushed to support Jean-Marc Bosman in his struggle for freedom.
Findlay would plead for the removal of the three-foreigner rule as
though somehow that would improve the standard of football in Scotland,
and if he felt like it, I'm sure the Rangers man could be as passionate
and persausive as a latter-day Clarence Darrow, but this argument should
not be regarded as one designed to defend the masses.
It is simply not true that a relaxation of the regulation to allow any
number of non-nationals to play for a particular club in European
competition would benefit that club's domestic league. The opposite
would probably be the case.
For every non-Scot who plays in a Scottish side a home-bred player is
left out. And while it would be foolish, and extremely hurtful to an
already ailing game to ignore foreign players altogether, there must be
a limit to their involvement. I believe three is just about sufficient.
If the rule is abolished what would there be to prevent the most
powerful clubs from signing everybody and anybody who looks remotely
like a player and winning trophies with 11 non-nationals? Even if there
were a few token nationals in the side what common good could be
squeezed from such success?
Although it would please the club owner it would do a domestic league
hardly any good at all to have one of its clubs as European champions if
the majority of the players involved in the success had been imported
from other countries.
At the moment there is nothing other than a lack of finance and, I
would like to believe, common sense to prevent clubs from playing 11
foreigners in domestic competitions, but how can anyone possibly believe
such a team would benefit Scottish football? It would delight only the
supporters of that one club, but it would also be a potentially damaging
example of tunnel vision.
Besides, what makes Rangers believe they would be competing on an even
field if the restriction was lifted? It would be no more level than it
is currently because every side Rangers could meet in Europe must
operate under the same restriction and if the three non-nationals' rule
is wiped would not the richest clubs buy up the best leaving clubs like
Rangers still off the pace?
It is the responsibility of Rangers in conjunction with the SFA and
Scottish League to make sure the standard of the Scottish player is
improved so that eight of ours can combine with three foreigners, if
that is what is deemed necessary, in any one side and provide a potent
force. Other clubs and leagues seem capable of doing it, why not us?
Scottish-powered success has been achieved before -- Celtic, Rangers,
and Aberdeen have won in Europe -- and it is pessimistic to say it can't
be done again. Packing a side with foreign talent would not guarantee
European success, but it would hinder the development of Scottish
talent.
I am not arguing that foreign players should be prevented from earning
in Scotland because that would be naive and far too parochial a stance.
It would also deny Scottish footballers opportunities to study at close
quarters the technique and style of better performers.
No player driven by a desire to improve can fail to be inspired by the
work of Brian Laudrup, Mark Hateley, Gordan Petric, even though he is
vastly over-rated, or even Trevor Steven when he was at his best, and it
should be remembered players of this standard are still encouraged to
come here.
Rangers can do more than most in that respect, but they should not buy
players classified as foreign and then have one of their people bleat
about the injustice of it all when they go into Europe.
Like every other club with European ambitions Rangers knew how many
non-nationals they would be allowed to use. If they are disadvantaged
then it is to the same degree as everyone else.
Findlay suggests also that Rangers are cheating their fans by being
unable to play all of their foreigners, but that doesn't stand up. The
contentious rule hasn't suddenly been dropped in our laps and the
supporters know exactly what they are paying for.
Findlay argues football can't afford to be inward looking and that the
game has no right to expect custom unless it provides the proper product
and facilities. He counsels that football should realise it is in the
entertainment and leisure industry. Good for him. At last a football
director has come to accept what the fans have known for years and had
directors taken action at the appropriate time Scottish football would
not be in such a mess.
If we must remember anything then let it be that while foreign
influences must always be encouraged to perform in Scotland they must be
seen as helpful to the development of our own players and not as an
alternative. Scottish talent will be the salvation of our game, nothing
else.

CAPITAL punishment is always an ugly event, a barbarous act itself
with a brutalising effect on those who have to administer and witness
it. If anything can make it even more repulsive it must be a long
incarceration punctuated by persistent appeals and last-minute reprieves
which can turn out to be temporary. The electrocution of of Nicholas
Ingram in Georgia last week offers a case in point, for he had been
under sentence of death for 12 years and had a very short stay of
execution after the final decision was taken to kill him. Ingram was
himself a convicted murderer (that one of his intended victims lived was
no tribute to his own capacity for mercy, but merely a fortunate
accident). Few tears will be shed for him, though the anguish of his
mother must excite compassion. His own guilt and inadequacy are,
however, beside the point: the savage retribution inherent in his death
is demeaning, and compounded by the 12 years of uncertainty which he
endured.
Death Rows are not an advertisement for American civilisation any more
than the penalty they postpone -- for as long as 16 years in the longest
case, and two in the shortest. At the moment there are 2000 condemned
men in this position (390 in Texas alone). In a curious way the agony of
postponement is a testimony to the liberal elements in the American
justice systems (which vary from state to state) for a string of
procedures, intended to ensure that a criminal receives every possible
benefit of the doubt, postpones the implementation of the most extreme
penalty. The fairly recent opinion of the Supreme Court that capital
punishment was ''cruel and unusual'', and so unacceptable, lasted for
only four years (1972-6). Most states have re-introduced it, though 12
still outlaw it, and if anything it has become more popular, with
three-quarters of Americans supporting it, a level only a little ahead
of the comparable British figure.
British interest in this case has been stimulated by Ingram's British
origins; but these are as irrelevant to his death as they were to his
crimes. What is inescapable is the methods of barbarism he had to
endure. Perhaps when Mr Clinton thinks again of lecturing the Chinese on
their lack of respect for liberal notions of civil rights and liberties,
he will remember Georgia or, indeed, his own role in supporting capital
punishment.

THE future begins here. The next generation of Scottish rugby
internationals face a stern test in post-revolution Romania this week as
the under-19 squad compete in a 24-team tournament billed as the Junior
Rugby World Cup.
The competition is organised by FIRA and the young Scots break new
ground as never before has the Scottish Rugby Union taken part in a
tournament operating under the auspices of the French-dominated sister
organisation to the International Board.
From the Home Unions only Scotland and Wales are represented. Missing,
too, are New Zealand and Australia, so the Junior World Cup description
is slightly misleading.
Nevertheless, at the top end of the tournament, which is split into
three groups depending upon a nation's standing in the rugby world, the
opposition will ask some difficult questions of the Scottish side.
Scotland are pooled with Argentina and Russia, the match against the
Russians being played tomorrow with the Argentinians following on
Wednesday.
Also in the top group are South Africa and Italy (last year's winners
and runners-up), France, Romania, Wales, Spain, Poland, Portugal, and
Uruguay.
The Scottish party, managed by 1990 Grand Slam captain David Sole and
coached by Alastair Christie, arrived here on Friday.
Training sessions have taken place at the Steaua ground in the city.
With the forwards, much of the emphasis has been on line-out work and so
intent have the youngters been on improving this aspect of their play
following the 32-13 defeat by England nine days ago at Stirling that on
Saturday lineout drills were also conducted in the car park of the team
hotel.
The young Scots in Romania have played a number of domestic games in
the run-up to this tournament, but last weekend's encounter with England
was their only outing against international opposition.
Yesterday, Sole spoke of the benefits to be accrued from taking a
party away for 10 days of concentrated rugby.
''This is a hugely significant trip for these boys. When you take
players away on tour then not only can you gauge their playing abilities
more closely but you also get an opportunity to monitor their overall
attitude.
0 ''Scotland becoming involved with FIRA is a major step. People have
tended to disregard FIRA previously and I would like to see Scotland's
involvement extended to include participation by the senior A team, for
instance, in the FIRA championship.''
Despite the fact that this is very much virgin territory for Scotland,
Sole is setting high achievement levels for his young side. ''You have
to set winning the tournament as your ultimate goal. We are not here
just to dip a toe in the water.''
One of the major obstacles which the Scottish side will have to
overcome is their lack of physical development compared to some of the
opposition. Against England the Scots suffered in this regard and, one
would imagine, that things will be no different here in Bucharest.
Against Latin opposition, in particular, the physical disparity is
primarily biological in the sense that the likes of the Argentinians,
the Italians and, even the French, mature much earlier. However, Sole is
a firm advocate of making the most of what nature provides by the
implementation of a rigorous weights programme.
''In Scotland, we have a cultural problem when it comes to
weight-training. We just don't work out in the gym enough. We look upon
fitness as speed allied to the ability to run all afternoon. But, in
rugby, increasing upper-body strength has to become part of the overall
fitness regime.''
Running the under-19 side is Sole's first venture into rugby
management. He considers it flattering to have been asked and he will
determine over the summer how his rugby future might develop.
His involvement mirrors that of 1990 Grand Slam team-mate Finlay
Calder, who is in charge of the under-18 squad.

Everton 4, Tottenham 1
EVERTON made light of the absence of Duncan Ferguson, normally their
most potent threat, to inflict on Tottenham one of the heaviest FA Cup
semi-final beatings of recent years at Elland Road yesterday.
Controlling the game for all but the briefest period -- when Jurgen
Klinsmann offered Spurs some hope with a penalty -- the suspended
Ferguson's team-mates finished it off in the most emphatic style, with
Nigerian substitute Daniel Amokachi coming on to score twice in the last
few minutes.
Lacking the option to send long balls forward to Ferguson's head,
Everton chose instead to pick out Anders Limpar, sensibly deployed wide
on the right to run at Stuart Nethercott, a central defender forced to
play at full back. Walker had been forced to save twice from the Swede,
and had watched Watson's header from a corner fizz over the bar, before
Everton scored in the thirty-fifth minute.
Howells, harried into losing possession, was lucky that his captain
Mabbutt got across to concede a corner, but from Hinchcliffe's kick Matt
Jackson's header flew in at the near post.
Mabbutt's shot following a free kick, which Southall deflected away
with his feet, was Everton's only alarm before they doubled their lead
10 minutes into the second half. Walker sent a free kick straight to
Rideout 30 yards out, and though the keeper managed to parry his shot,
Graham Stuart ran in the rebound.
Only then did Klinsmann -- hoping to become the first German since
Manchester City's goalkeeper Bert Trautmann almost 40 years ago to play
in the cup final -- begin to make an impression. It was his headed flick
that caused Watson to lean into Sheringham, though the Tottenham forward
seemed to be making a back for him and was fortunate to be rewarded with
a penalty that Klinsmann rolled in.
But Everton would not be denied. They broke down the right and Stuart
crossed for Amokachi, on for the injured Rideout, to score with a
downward header.
In the last minute, Tottenham's defence was left looking like
something left over from the Ossie Ardiles days, hopelessly outnumbered
as Amokachi met Ablett's cross for the fourth goal.
Astonishingly, the substitute -- out of favour for most of Royle's
period in charge -- ought to have completed a nine-minute hat trick,
evading Mabbutt only to roll the ball across goal.

Environmentalists in America are alarmed at the rolling back of core
environmental statutes
AMERICA is openly debating the politics of welfare and job preferences
for women and minorities. But the Republicans, and some Democratic
supporters, are also on a less-noticed fast-track to wipe out a
generation of bipartisan environmental laws. The ''stealth'' attack on
green legislation, already well under way on Capitol Hill, is the most
widespread in the 25 years since laws to protect wildlife, public health
and safety, and clean air and water were first enacted.
Clinton, bowing to political pressures, signed the first part of the
''green attack'' into law recently. Much of the remaining proposed
legislation is about be introduced to the US Senate having already been
approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. But one
portion of the agenda was blocked by the Senate on March 29, signaling
that it views parts of the House Republicans' crusade as excessive.
Under the ''Contract with America'', spear-headed by conservative
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, private property owners would be
compensated if government regulations reduce the value of their land by
one-fifth or more. That means taxpayers would essentially have to pay
the owners of land -- even if used for factories or agribusiness -- not
to pollute.
This payment for property ''takings'' would virtually halt the
Endangered Species Act, which protects birds such as the California
condor and America's national symbol, the bald eagle. The measure was
passed by the Republican-led House last month by a 277-148 vote.
''Private use of one's land is being sacrificed for the public good,''
said supporter Tom Delay, a Congressman from Texas, afterwards.
Also in the four-part agenda is a Bill recently signed into law by
Clinton preventing ''unfunded mandates'' such as federal laws ensuring
clean water and air. The reasoning is that those laws are an unfair
burden on states unless federal monies are provided to carry them out.
''It's time for Congress to stop passing on to the states the cost of
laws we make here in Washington,'' Clinton noted before signing it.
The third proposal addresses ''risk assessment'' in health and safety
and would lead to curbs on, for example, the Environmental Protection
Agency's ability to regulate chemicals. Panels including industry
officials would instead conduct complex cost-benefit analysis to see if
the economics of regulation are justified. The measure has been passed
by the House, but its future in the Senate is uncertain and Clinton is
hinting he might veto it.
The fourth proposal -- a moratorium on all new federal regulations
since November until the risk-assessment provisions are enacted -- was
rejected by the Senate. The proposal had been passed by the House of
Representatives. A narrower Bill however might give Congress powers to
block regulations before they take effect.
In another measure, not in the Contract with America, House
Republicans introduced legislation to overhaul a law protecting lakes
and streams, aiming to reduce ''heavy-handed'' regulation of industry,
agriculture, and local communities. The Bill was drafted with the help
of industry representatives, note critics. ''It's a polluter's Bill of
rights,'' charges Democratic Congressman Norman Mineta of California, an
opponent.
The sweeping revisions to the Clean Water Act passed their first
hurdle in late March when a House panel backed the changes. It was the
first vote in the 104th Congress on actually rolling back one of the
country's core environmental statutes.
Still, it is unclear how widespread the changes will ultimately be.
Most major US newspapers have run leaders attacking the green attack.
Even Time magazine blasted it as a ''Congressional Chain-saw Massacre''.
''Every person in (the Clinton) administration is very alarmed,'' says
Carol Browner, head of the Environmental Protection Agency. And interior
secretary Bruce Babbitt has accused Republicans of ''the most brilliant
sneak attack on the American people since Pearl Harbor''. He continued:
''Teddy Roosevelt must be rolling over in his grave at the sight of the
Republican Party rolling back the gains of the last century.'' Roosevelt
was deeply involved in establishing national parks such as Yosemite.
But many ordinary Americans are not aware of what is at stake. A
Time/CNN poll earlier this year found 88% of Americans consider
environmental protection most or very important, while less than
one-quarter think anti-pollution regulations have gone too far. Yet the
same poll found overwhelming support for regulatory reforms.
''This is a radical approach that could result in gutting some of the
key environmental and health laws in the US,'' said attorney Wendy
Pulling of the well-known Natural Resources Defence Council. ''But it's
a debate that's not even being conducted so the public has a full
understanding of what is going on.''
Yet the shift in the country's mood has not exactly been secret.
''Give them all (endangered species) a designated area and then blow it
up. It sounds insane, but that's how insane endangered-species people
are,'' said newly-elected California Congressman Sonny Bono, the former
pop star and partner of Cher, during his successful campaign for office.
The new chairman of the House Committee on Resources is also Don
Young, an Alaskan Republican with animal heads and hides decorating his
Capitol Hill office. Leader of the Republican environmental attack, he
argues that ''protectionists'' have for too long built walls of red tape
around the country's natural wealth.
Even at state level the mood among politicians and some beleaguered
citizens is similar. Recently California governor Pete Wilson quietly
suspended the state endangered species and clean air laws for five years
to help farmers recover from recent devastating floods. State officials
have upped the estimated cost of flood damages to agriculture to $400m.
The issue is bitter for residents of the small Hispanic village of
Pajaro in California's Central Valley. After a bridge collapsed and
killed several people during the recent flooding, they blamed the
endangered long-toed salamander. County officials had refused to clear
vegetation from a levee the year before as it would have been too costly
without breaking federal and state environmental laws.
But California's environmentalists and state wildlife officials are
aghast. It only became clear late in the day that Wilson's suspension of
the Endangered Species Act was not just for recovery from floods but
from all disasters, such as earthquakes or riots. California has been
pummeled over the past few years by a startling series of disasters.
State wildlife officials also say that the long-toed salamander had
nothing to do with the flooding near Pajaro and that the animal is an
easy scapegoat.
Wilson is also proposing a new, gutted version of the Endangered
Species Act that would exempt farmers, electric utilities, and forestry
companies whenever they are doing ''routine'' work. Critics note that
many of Wilson's campaign contributors are big businesses. He is running
for President.

TOM PAINE -- A POLITICAL LIFE
By John Keane
Bloomsbury: #25
WHAT would Tom Paine have made, do you think, of the fashionable
blethering over rights and duties? With saintly politicians on every
side affecting to fear that the former have for too long been elevated
at the expense of the latter, we might guess that the author of Rights
of Man would have had something sour and pointed to say about privilege,
power, and the liberty of citizens.
Paine remains astonishingly pertinent, not least to the arguments over
Britain's ramshackle constitution. To read him is to be reminded of how
little the machinery of the state has really changed in the two
centuries since Rights of Man appeared.
He it was who pointed out that monarchy and democracy in no way mix,
that Parliament is an ornate facade, that churches are ''human
inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolise power
and profit''. He argued for the rights of woman, for the freedom of
slaves, for national self-determination, and for good prose. He was the
model of a democratic republican.
Yet in a strange way Paine remains dangerous too. So thoroughly
suppressed have been his ideas, not least by the established parties of
comic left and pantomime right (who both seek to claim him) that his
work is a kind of unexploded bomb buried deep within the British
consciousness. One day, with the help of this book perhaps, the bomb
will go off.
Writing to George Washington from Paris in 1789, Paine declared: ''A
share in two revolutions is living to some purpose.'' Yet he made no
revolution in Britain and we still wait, with our unwritten
constitution, our ''Crown in Parliament'', and our hack politicians
talking of duties but yearning for deference, for the transformation he
helped effect in America and France. It's easy to believe that if Paine
were around today they would still be trying to lock him up.
One of the marvels of John Keane's massive and enthralling biography
is that he makes his subject our contemporary without once losing sight
of a complex historical context. Born in Thetford, Norfolk, at a place
known as ''the Wilderness'' and hard by Gallows Hill, Paine was the
child of a vicious, unabashed century who raised himself to
international notoriety by the sheer power of words alone at a time when
literacy was less than universal. His was the Age of Reason (the title
of another of his works) and common sense his only weapon. The use to
which he put it was devastating.
Yet there is in Paine's extraordinary story more than a little
tragedy. His own country tried him for seditious libel in his absence
and defamed him as a drunken traitor. The French thanked him for drawing
up the blueprint for their revolution by slinging him in jail (Paine
wanted only to depose the king; he was against regicide). The Americans,
equally, showed their gratitude by shunning him at the end of his life,
denying him the right to vote, and refusing him burial in a Quaker
cemetery after his death in 1809.
But what Keane makes clear, at every turn, is the percipience and
courage of his subject. Thus: ''Paine's early life in England made him
profoundly sceptical of the view that government and religious
institutions are above suspicion. On this basis, he began his public
life as a journalist, a defender of government employees' right to
organise into trade unions, and a critic of the enslavement of Africans.
Paine then smashed into the antiquated structures of monarchy so
cherished by the governing political classes of his day.''
To which add: two revolutions and a joust with Edmund Burke in which
lowly Paine proved himself as at least the intellectual equal of the
great reactionary. His was a life almost shaped to be a book and the
dialogue, needless to say, never falters. No scriptwriter could have
invented the famous exchange with his friend Ben Franklin. ''Where
liberty is, there is my country,'' said the American. ''Where liberty is
not, there is my country,'' replied Paine.
What we have here, in fact, is a recovered fragment, though a massive
fragment, of the forgotten history of western democracy. Paine advanced
many propositions now taken for granted, and many others -- not least
regarding monarchy -- still rejected by many. He worked to destroy, by
argument, the ''pseudodivinity'' of kings, and there are few royalists
today who still believe in divine right. But his belief that the
hereditary principle, however manifested, is antipathetic to democracy
is resisted still by those with most to lose.
He writes marvellously well -- as much a pleasure to read, in his way,
as David Hume -- and so does his portraitist. Keane's book is everything
a biography should be and more than readers have a right to expect. He
is no hagiographer, and finds fault when there is fault to be found, yet
he mixes ideas and incident with real skill. His narrative is
marvellously paced, but never at the expense of Paine's thinking and
beliefs.
In fact, these drive the book. Again and again Keane stresses what was
perhaps Paine's central assertion, still novel in England if not here:
''Citizens are the source of sovereignty, and any challenge to the
principle that actively represented consent is the basis of law is
despotism -- government accountable only to itself.''
In that sentence lies most of Paine's importance, yet his abiding
modernity remains tantalising. That his ideas endure despite every
challenge almost suggests that in his works there lies genuine,
imperishable human truth. Thus, the launch issue of the UK edition of
Wired, the most influential magazine of the digital revolution, has
Paine's face and words (''We have it in our power to begin the world
over again'') on its cover.
Inside, the activists of the Internet, dedicated to free expression
and the free transmission of ideas, claim Paine as their patron saint.
He might have liked that, but the chances are he would have reminded his
children of, as Keane puts it, ''the highest duty of political writers''
-- to irritate their country's government. Here, for once, a great man
has been given the biography he deserves.

Manchester Utd 2, Crystal Palace 2 (after extra time)
GARY Pallister kept alive Manchester United's Wembley dream in a
dramatic FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park yesterday.
The big defender pounced to score only his third goal of the seaon and
force an action replay back at the same ground on Wednesday.
Alan Smith's brave Crystal Palace side had twice taken the lead. Iain
Dowie grabbed his fourth goal in as many ties since his #400,000 bargain
move from Southampton in January.
Denis Irwin wiped that out after 37 nervous minutes with a free kick
special that looped in off the luckless Ray Houghton, only for Chris
Armstrong to reach a new high with a breakaway goal in the second minute
of the extra half hour.
Just four minutes later, though, Pallister rescued United, scoring
from Gary Neville's long throw.
If history is any guide, Palace must now fear their chance has gone.
In the 1990s United have twice come from behind in semis to beat Oldham
in replays. And five years ago, Mark Hughes rescued the Wembley final
against Palace, with United going on to take the Cup with Lee Martin's
only goal of the re-match.
United manager Alex Ferguson admitted: ''Palace always take us to the
edge. I don't think we are ever going to get an easy time against them.
''Both teams played their part in what must have been an exciting game
to watch. It was ironic that our goals both came from set plays because
that is Palace's strong point and, to be fair, we handled it very poorly
at times.
''At 1-0 down in a semi-final it's an uphill fight. But we improved in
the second half and I felt we deserved the equaliser.
Ferguson's counterpart Alan Smith saluted his battling Eagles,
saying:. ''I'm proud of my team and they have got to draw confidence
from this performance. They carried out the game plan. Even the goals
that United got had to come from set plays, but I won't tarnish our
performance with any criticism.
''The players feel a bit flat after twice being pegged back, but they
need to understand they have played well against a great side and were
unlucky. I will be having a few drinks wth them tonight to underline
that.''
Bad news for Palace, though, is that goalkeeper Nigel Martyn damaged a
hand in the opening minutes diving at the feet of David Beckham and it
is feared there could be a fracture.

BRITAIN'S Damon Hill swept to the tenth victory of his career and his
first of the season when he scored a resounding triumph in the
Argentinian Grand Prix yesterday.
Hill, driving a Williams, came home six seconds clear of Frenchman
Jean Alesi, in a Ferrari, to move into joint-second place after two
races in the drivers' championship.
But Scot David Coulthard, Hill's team-mate, who started the race from
pole position for the first time in his career, was not so lucky.
Despite leading early in the race and regaining the lead in the first
flurry of pit stops, he had to retire with electrical problems.
World champion Michael Schumacher, of Germany, who was disqualified
after coming home first in the Brazilian Grand Prix last month, finished
third ahead of Benetton team-mate Johnny Herbert, of Britain.
Hill's win, which came in his thirty-sixth grand prix, earned him 10
points. He lies joint-second with Alesi in the drivers' championship
behind Austria's Gerhard Berger, who was sixth in a Ferrari and now has
11 points.
The race had started dramatically by being red-flagged to a halt
before the first lap was completed because of multiple pile-ups, in
which no-one was injured.
On the restart, another accident resulted in Finland's Mika Hakkinen,
in a McLaren, spinning out with a punctured left rear tyre, following a
collision with Eddie Irvine's Jordan. Irvine had to retire with a broken
front wing.
After this, what followed was almost routine although a flurry of
pit-stops enlivened the racing, once Coulthard in the second Williams
had been forced to retire.
''It was a terrific disappointment,'' said Coulthard. ''I really felt
in command and I have grown in confidence and in performance level here
all weekend.''
Only nine of the 26 starters finished the race, which was run in dry
conditions after three successive days of heavy rain. But the crowd was
not affected and a capacity of 75,000 fans, starved of Formula One in
Argentina for 14 years, poured in to watch.
Hill, delighted with his victory, praised the crowd for their
enthusiasm. He said: ''They were so enthusiastic and I am certainly
looking forward to coming back here next year. I just hope we get much
better weather.
''It feels great to get into double figures for wins and I have to say
every win feels better than the last.''
Hill also praised his team for the efficiency of their three
pit-stops, which were flawless, while he drove almost imperiously to
victory.
Alesi, whose second place leaves him in joint-second place in the
title race alongside Hill, was equally satisfied. ''It felt so good to
have a competitive car again and I feel Ferrari are in very good
shape,'' he said. Result (British unless stated):
1, D Hill, Williams, 1hr 53min 14.532sec; 2, J Alesi (France) Ferrari,

IT is hard not to be sorry for the Prime Minister: the latest example
of sleaze, that involving a Parliamentary Private Secretary, is neither
his fault nor the stuff of any political substance. It takes its place,
however, in what is now a long catalogue of sexual scandal and
indiscretion concerning members of the Government and blighting its
prospects. The blight certainly scuppered one set of presentational
initiatives (Back to Basics, a year ago) and its continuance damages the
Tories. It is hard to think, however, that all of that is other than
incidental to Mr Major's main problems which are a haemorrhage of public
support. This characterised all elections, and by-elections, last year
and its persistence has been confirmed by our own local elections last
week. If the trend is confirmed in the English and Welsh local elections
next month, it really is hard to see how the Prime Minister can avoid a
challenge to his leadership later this year.
There are some grounds for believing that Scotland might be peculiar:
historically, it has seldom favoured the Tories, whose oft-mentioned
success in the early 1950s was an exceptional as well as short-lived
performance. It was, for example, said of the 1906 election that
Scotland's Tory MPs could have travelled south in a single compartment
of a first-class railway carriage. There are other reasons for thinking
that England (though possibly not Wales) will behave differently, but
supposing it does not; supposing the Tories lose half their existing
seats? Mr Major will have to consider his position. It is not enough to
say that he is presently running somewhat ahead of his party, as Mr Hurd
has just pointed out, for such a run is more a limp. The Tories might be
able yet to hop, skip, and jump if someone else is at their head.
That is a matter for them; but their MPs would hardly be human if they
were not ready to calculate their own future majorities in the light of
related electoral outcomes now. The Prime Minister may do similar sums.
Though he famously won in 1992 against the opinion polls, he was a
relative unknown, with no record in No 10. That is no longer the case.
Political leaders have to pass electoral tests all the time. Mr Major
has shown himself particularly adept at doing so in the House of
Commons, though even there he has actually lost the sure support of a
clutch of back benchers; outside Parliament is another matter. That Mrs
Shepherd has been mentioned as a possible successor is interesting.
Though the story has been dismissed, it is a sign of panic, but nothing
like as dramatic as will be evident next month if England follows
Scotland's lead.

ANY day now the European Union will shut shop. The French have decided
so. This, of course, is not unconnected with the fact that the French
are also in the process of finding a successor to Francois Mitterrand,
and at least two of the candidates -- Messrs Balladur and Chirac --
don't want any distractions from the job in hand. It is all terribly
inconvenient for the poor souls, what with having to run Europe as
current holders of the EU presidency while fighting to the electoral
death at home.
In the inevitable conflict of interests between French domestic
politics and European responsibilities, there can only be one winner.
Mind you, there are precedents for presidencies going awry. The
Maastricht treaty was almost lost when Britain was in charge and the
French gave it only a grudging kiss of life with their famous ''petit
oui'' -- and Britain did actually lose control of the pound when it was
blown out of the ERM around the same time. All was saved when the
Edinburgh summit proved to be a British success.
The Belgians went one better when they were in charge by presiding
over the collapse of the ERM itself, not to mention the loss of their
popular king on the same day. You can imagine the chaos inside the
Belgian Government caused by such an unfortunate conjunction of events.
So presidencies can be difficult affairs, but so far only the French
have nakedly abandoned their responsibilities while nominally in charge.
The French Minister for Europe, Alain Lamassoure, was asked last week
how he could explain the decision to call only two or three Council of
Ministers' meetings in the coming six weeks. He began by replying that
it was, after all, Easter. He failed to see his own joke as the hacks
fell about the press room.
But the fact remains -- and it is a scandal -- that the French have
put the running of the European Union on hold until their little local
business is settled. That will be soon after their six-week Easter, and
when it happens there will be a sudden flurry of council meetings just
to make sure the French presidency is recorded on paper as looking
respectable.
This really does matter because the EU cannot operate without an
active Council of Ministers. The council remains -- like it or not --
the engine of the EU. It might be undemocratic, secretive, and
unresponsive, but that is where the real power lies as the EU is
currently structured. Without the council the whole Euro-machine begins
to splutter to a halt.
Fiddling the books like this reminds me of the golfer who duffed his
drive, sliced his second, thinned his third, and holed a fluke for a par
four, causing his caddie to observe: ''Aye, sir, it's just as weel
scorecards dinnae show photies . . .''
When the French presidency is over, the EU scorecard will show that 40
council meetings were convened in the six months -- a quite respectable
number. That will put them equal with the Greeks last year and only two
behind the efficient Germans from whom they inherited the presidency in
January. But the statistics will lie.
The European Parliament saw the French presidency coming. Socialist
Euro-MPs warned the French Government that they were already fed up with
the Germans' similar behaviour during their presidency last year. The
EP's socialists -- recalling that the German presidency also coincided
with a national election -- gave notice that a log would be kept of
French offences.
The evidence was duly produced with a flourish last week by Mrs
Pauline Green, the ex-policewoman from London who now leads the big
British-dominated socialist group in the EP. Mrs Green waved her dossier
of French disrespect in Lamassoure's face. She more or less told the
poor suspect that anything he had to say in evidence would be written
down, etc, etc.
She had a point. There were the cases of the Ministers who failed to
turn up for questions; the Minister unwilling to make a statement on the
fishing row with Canada; the determination of the French Government to
make politically self-serving statements in the chamber when no-one
wanted or needed to hear them; the chaos at planning meetings when
Ministers muttered that they might not be available for engagements --
the case for the prosecution went on and on.
The socialists are not alone in expressing their annoyance with
France. What exacerbates their frustration are the widespread whispers
of support from their political opponents in the European People's
Party, which includes British Tories, but who are unwilling to knock
their French and German soulmates in public for obvious party political
reasons.
When Chancellor Kohl was running the show last year he put off
meetings which could have rebounded domestically and he kept certain
difficult items such as the EU's poverty programme off the political
agenda lest they cause embarrassment back home during an election. Now
the French have taken up where the Chancellor left off by simply pulling
down the shutters.
But in June there will be chaos as the logjam of the abandoned agenda
is crammed into one month in the lead-up to the Cannes summit, when the
French will offload their responsibilities on to the incoming Spanish
presidency. Mrs Green was in fighting form as she distributed her charge
sheet to Europe's media and denounced the French and Germans for their
''unacceptable'' behaviour. She was doing more than just whingeing. Mrs
Green is entitled to claim a genuine victory of sorts by employing the
simple tactic of refusing to have issues removed from the parliament's
agenda and thus forcing France's hand. This has left the French with no
alternative but to deal with matters such as voting rights in municipal
elections for foreigners in another EU member state.
Meanwhile, the Spanish are gearing up for their turn at the helm. The
word from their people in Strasbourg is that they will push the pace
towards a single currency and reform of the voting system in the Council
of Ministers. As far as our Government is concerned, Spain owes it
nothing after the fishing row, when we sided with the Canadians. Mr
Major might reflect he was better off with the good old French.

SCOTTISH boxing is about to benefit from a fresh injection of
television cash, and it will involve ''nursery'' shows, open to the
public and staged throughout the country from June.
The man behind the deal -- worth more than #100,000 -- which has been
struck with Sky Television, is Frank Warren, the promoter who brought
Prince Naseem Hamed to Scotland and who next month, in association with
Katherine Morrison, will stage the Frank Bruno-Ray Anis contest at the
Kelvin Hall in Glasgow.
Now Warren will team up with Katherine's father, Alex Morrison, to
stage 10 televised shows featuring up-and-coming boxers. The first is
scheduled for June in the east of Scotland, possibly at Leith Town Hall.
Other shows will be staged at the Hospitality Inn, Glasgow, and in
Dundee.
Among the boxers who will be featured are light-heavyweight John
Wilson, of Edinburgh, a Commonwealth silver medallist, and feather Brian
Carr, from Moodiesburn, who boxed at the Olympics.
Morrison has signed up two more men who could benefit from the deal,
Edinburgh's Craig Lynch and Edinburgh-based Nigerian Larry Anderson.

LARRY Holmes will finally hang up his gloves after having failed to
join George Foreman as a ''golden oldie'' heavyweight world champion.
At 45, Holmes was bidding to become the second-oldest heavyweight
champion behind Foreman, who won the IBF and WBA titles with a
tenth-round knock-out of Michael Moorer as a 46-year-old last November.
But time caught up with the former champion when Oliver McCall -- 16
years his junior -- retained the WBC heavyweight title he took away from
Britain's Lennox Lewis in London last September with a unanimous points
victory at Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas.
''He fought a good fight. I fought a good fight, but he was a little
stronger,'' said Holmes, who was world champion from 1978 to 1985.
''This is a good way for me to go out. This is my last fight.''
Holmes used all his experience to dictate the first half of the fight,
only for McCall to take control when the veteran's ageing legs began to
slow.
''He came out more courageous than George Foreman,'' said McCall. ''I
had the better jab and I felt that made the difference.''
''I had to show the people that Oliver McCall could do a few things. A
sparring partner can't do those things, but a champion can,'' said
McCall, who was referring to jibes about his days as a sparring partner
for Mike Tyson, the former undisputed champion who was released from
prison on March 25 but did not attend the five-bout card despite being
in Las Vegas.
The victory put McCall into the Tyson sweepstakes along with Bruce
Seldon, who, earlier on the card, won the vacant WBA title by stopping
Tony Tucker after seven rounds. McCall and Seldon are both promoted by
Don King, who also promotes Tyson.
Punishing left jabs had closed Tucker's left eye and forced the
referee to stop the fight after the seventh round, giving Seldon, 28,
the title.
The three other title bouts all ended with the reigning champions
retaining their belts.
Julio Cesar Chavez kept a firm grip on his WBC super-lightweight title
with a unanimous decision over Giovanni Parisi. Chavez, 32, who now has
94 wins to his credit, punched relentlessly before resorting to clowning
in the later rounds, with the Italian seemingly unable to hurt him.
The Dominican Republic's Luis Santana is still WBC super-welterweight
champion after his second disqualification victory over American Terry
Norris in seven months. Norris, 27, knocked out his opponent at least 10
seconds after the bell had signalled the end of the third round.
The challenger had been dominating the fight and knocked down his
34-year-old opponent once in the second round and again in the third.
But after the bell rang, referee Kenny Bayless had begun to turn away
after having stepped between the fighters when Norris unloaded a right
hand straight to the head of Santana, knocking him flat underneath the
ropes.
Santana was down for at least five minutes and was carried out on a
stretcher and taken to nearby Valley Hospital.
Norris said: ''I didn't know the round was over. I didn't hear the
bell.''
Last September, he decked Santana with a blow to the back of the head
in the fifth round, was disqualified, and lost the title.
Puerto Rican Felix Trinidad retained his IBF welterweight title when
he stopped Roger Turner shortly after having floored the American in the
second round.

FORMER world champion Douglas Wakiihuri, of Kenya, won the sixth World
Cup marathon in Athens yesterday, but was 57 seconds outside the course
record of 2hr 11min 04sec set by Britain's Bill Adcock in 1969.
The 31-year-old, world champion in 1987 and silver medallist at the
1988 Olympics, braved the rough course in light rain to finish in
2-12-01.
''The race was not easy, but I was very well prepared,'' said
Wakiihuri. ''Good tactics won me the race.''
Japan's Takahiro Sunada was second in 2-13-16, with Italian Davide
Milesi third in 2-14-09.
Romanian Anuta Catuna broke the women's course record in 2-31-10,
beating Portuguese runner Rosa Mota's 1982 time by almost five minutes.
Lidia Simon (2-31-46) and Cristina Pomacu (2-32-09) made it a clean
sweep for Romania. Results:
Men -- 1, D Wakiihuri (Kenya) 2hr 12min 01sec; 2, T Sunada (Jap)
2-13-16; 3, D Milesi (Italy) 2-14-09.

WOMEN'S HOCKEY
SCOTTISH international Rhona Simpson is now hitting the form which
made her one of the most feared strikers in Scottish hockey a few
seasons back. She continued to improve her scoring rate on Saturday by
hitting a treble for Edinburgh Ladies in their 6-0 defeat of Western's
second string and so help add to the congestion at the top of the table,
writes Joseph Dillon.
Only one point now separates four teams but the Edinburgh girls remain
favourites to take the title for the first time.
Hyndland, in fourth place, are enjoying one of their best ever
seasons. They picked up maximim points at the weekend from their two
outings and are now assured of a top-four finish.
Grange have now little chance of avoiding relegation but Heriot Watt,
Western 2nds, Royal High Gymnasts and Boroughmuir have still much work
to do to get clear of play-offs.
Scotland had to settle for third place in both the Four Nations
Under-18 and Under-16 schoolgirl tournaments at Lossiemouth and
Gordonstoun over the weekend. Both events were won by Ireland. Results:

MEN'S HOCKEY
GILLON Fabbroni, the Watsonians penalty corner expert, yesterday
brought Touche Ross Gordonians down to earth after the young northerners
had gone into orbit on Saturday by qualifying for the final of the
Scottish Cup by beating holders Grange, writes Joseph Dillon.
Fabbroni converted the first penalty corner in the fourth minute,
repeated the feat seven minutes later, and suddenly the cup heroes were
in trouble. Phil Webster managed to calm their nerves a little by
hitting the target shortly afterwards.
Touche Ross secured a point when Webster converted a penalty midway
through the second half.
The comparison in attitude and commitment of the Touche Ross players
24 hours earlier against Grange was like night and day, although they
were fortunate to survive a last-minute penalty for the holders.
Mark Ehlen saved brilliantly from Donald McFarlane and Touche Ross won
through to meet Western in the final on April 23 by winning the penalty
shoot out 5-4 with Kenny McNally sending his effort past a post with the
penultimate shot. Results:
Saturday: Scottish Cup. Semi-final -- Grange 0, Touche Ross Gordonians
0 (Touche Ross won 5-4 on penalties).

IT WAS a day for first timers at yesterday's Tom Scott Memorial Road
Race, with Adrian Callan (Shettleston) and Vikki McPherson (City of
Glasgow AC) winning at their first outing over the 10-mile distance.
Callan, a Scottish track internationalist and 1500-metre champion with
a sub-four-minute mile to his credit, kept with the leading group and
covered every burst.
McPherson, short of training and competition because of accountancy
exams last winter, won by almost three minutes from clubmate Audrey Sym.
Results:
Men -- 1, A Callan 47min 35sec; 2, G Wight 47-54 (both Shettleston); 3
(and veteran), B Kirkwood (LDRC) 48-08; 4, C Thomson (Cambuslang) 48-10;

FORT William completed the first half of a Scottish Cup double at the
weekend.
The juniors captured the Sir William Sutherland Cup with a single-goal
win over Kilmallie and the seniors won 2-1 at Drumnadrochit to reach the
semi-finals of the Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup.
John Wood was the juniors' hero, firing home a 25-yard shot after two
minutes.
At Drumnadrochit, Fort William's first team took control of their
second replay in the Camanachd Cup.
A goal by Ronnie MacLeod was equalled by Mark Stewart, but Victor
Smith's volley in the second period sent Fort home victorious.
They now face a crucial spell of big games which could bring them
three more trophies. The first is this Saturday, when they meet Oban
Camanachd in the Keyline MacAulay Cup final.
Camanachd reached the final with a comfortable win against Inveraray,
Gus Campbell scoring four in the 7-3 win.
Both Oban Camanachd and Fort William now face midweek league games as
the title battles in both north and south division one reach a climax.
The north title remains unresolved following the postponement of
Skye's game with Kingussie, now rescheduled for this Saturday. Camanachd
need two points to clinch the south title and cannot play a league game
this weekend as they are in the MacAulay Cup final.

JOHN Higgins wrote another chapter in his remarkable success story at
Plymouth last night. The 19-year-old Scot captured his third major title
of the season with a 9-6 win over Ronnie O'Sullivan in the #325,000
Castella British Open.
Higgins, winner of the Skoda Grand Prix and the International Open,
banked a first prize of #60,000 to carry his season's earnings to
#271,000.
That leaves him second in the money list behind Stephen Hendry -- but
he is No.1 in ranking points this season.
''I scored well when I got in and that was what won me the match,''
said Higgins, who is now second favourite behind his fellow Scot for the
world championship, which begins in Sheffield on Friday.
''What has happened to me over the last few months is beyond my
wildest dreams. It's all down to self-confidence now, because I know I
can compete against anyone. I know now that I'm good, I don't need
anyone telling me.''
Higgins began nervously as his rival raced 2-0 ahead with breaks of 76
and 117. But Higgins then reeled off runs of 55, 42, 119, 62, and 79 to
grab five of the following six frames.
The Scot piled on the pressure last night with a 65 break and then the
highlight of the match -- a 132 total clearance -- in the tenth for a
7-3 lead.
O'Sullivan, the title-holder, fought back to 5-7 before the thirteenth
frame proved unlucky for him when he went in-off as he tried to escape a
snooker. He rallied briefly with a 73 but when he missed an easy red in
the fifteenth, Higgins pounced with a run of 42.
O'Sullivan paid tribute to his opponent, saying: ''John's got a great
all-round game. The difference between us today was his safety game. I
gave him a lot more opportunities than he gave me.''
But he was adamant about the favourite for the world title: ''John is
obviously on top form but I have to say that in my book Stephen Hendry
remains the one we all have to beat.''
The #2400 highest-break prize was claimed by Hendry with a 145 total
clearance in his 5-3 second-round win over Rutherglen's Drew Henry.
* FORMER winner Jimmy Allan reached the last 16 of the Scottish
Amateur Championship last night at the Masters Club, Glasgow, when he
beat Stuart Maxwell 4-1 and then Jimmy McAllister 4-0. Last year's
beaten finalist, Rab Ritchie of Kirkcaldy, defeated Steve Halleran 4-3,
and Paul Harkness 4-1.

EDINBURGH Racers will play Nottingham Panthers in the semi-final of
the British Championship at Wembley on Saturday.
Scotland's last hopes completed off their play-off campaign with an
11-5 setback at Basingstoke last night, their first defeat in six
play-off matches. But on Saturday they had had a convincing 8-6 win over
defending champions, Cardiff Devils in Edinburgh, with a superb hat
trick from Slovakian marksman Ivan Matulik.
However, Fife Flyers missed out on joining Racers at Wembley --
despite beating Nottingham 5-3. The Kirkcaldy club needed to win by nine
clear goals but it proved far too much on the night, despite a good
performance and four goals from Doug Marsden.
Instead, Cardiff will square up to new premier champions Sheffield
Steelers.
Paisley Pirates missed out on a place in the premier division when
they went down heavily 14-5 at Slough.
The big win allowed the South of England side to gain promotion at the
expense of Peterborough Pirates, who were relegated despite beating
Bracknell 11-5. Results:
British Championship play-offs: Group A -- Sheffield 6, Fife 0;
Nottingham 7, Humberside 3; Sheffield 9, Humberside 2; Fife 5,
Nottingham 3.
Group B -- Edinburgh 8, Cardiff 6; Durham 5, Basingstoke 5; Cardiff
13, Durham 1; Basingstoke 11, Edinburgh 5.
Promotion play-offs: Group A -- Peterborough 5, Slough 5; Paisley 12,
Bracknell 9; Bracknell 5, Peterborough 11; Slough 14, Paisley 5.
Group B -- Milton Keynes 5, Whitley 7; Swindon 8, Telford 11; Telford
10, Milton Keynes 6; Whitley 3, Swindon 1 (abandoned after 35 mins
because of state of the ice).
* DAVID Finch scored three goals for Paisley as the Blackhawks beat
Aberdeen North Stars 4-3 in the Aberdeen Spring Cup.

IN Stewart McIntosh's interesting article on Davidston, ''a peaceful
gem from warlike days'', he states that the army of the Marquis of
Montrose camped beside the castle ''between his victories over the
Covenanting armies at Auldear (sic) and Alford, their last victory
before defeat at Culloden'' (April 5).
Small wonder that Montrose clansmen and Irish followers suffered that
last defeat. They must have been far too elderly to put up much of a
fight, in view of the fact that Culloden was fought over a century after
Montrose's final victory at Kilsyth.

How one man's vision of the future has brought him eyeball to eyeball
with the people of Glasgow
JOHN Morrish's name is mud to many Glaswegians. Large, clingy lumps of
it, that is, which you trail in over the carpet before you realise what
a mess you are making.And then there's the noise. A skull-shattering
drilling which reverberates through the walls at precisely 8.30 in the
morning with the exactness of a BBC time signal.
Which is all a bit unfair for Mr Morrish who is trying to bring to
Glasgow a vision of the future. It's the world of fibre optics, where a
strand in a cable, almost as thin as a hair, can carry tens of thousands
of phone calls at once. It will mean cheaper phone bills -- only a penny
ha'penny at night for as long as you want to another local user of the
system.
It will mean all these cable television stations piped in to your home
without an unsightly satellite dish on the wall to give the game away.
And it will be the future connection for the information superhighway,
for home security systems, for home banking, video on demand, and even
reading your electricity meter.
But do the people of Glasgow share his vision? It seems that while
Morrish, the managing director of CableTel in Glasgow, is looking to the
future, the citizens are instead looking down at the ground, complaining
about the mess of the trenches being dug, the noise, the threat to
trees, and the fear of green boxes being erected outside their homes.
''Nobody wants it,'' is the constant complaint. Yet curiously the
take-up rate in the first areas to be offered it is high. Few people are
averse to an improved and cheaper telephone service. And even cable
television is improving its image. The satellite channels are not
perceived as so down-market as they used to be, thanks partly to some
superb sports coverage.
But John Morrish is still the prophet crying in the wilderness.
Despite CableTel spending #50m so far in the Glasgow area, few people
are thanking him for it yet.
Curious thing. People come across a BT crew digging up the pavement
and they think nothing of it. Soon as they see CableTel, their blood
boils.
''People perceive BT as having the right to do this and we don't. We
have just got to keep pushing the message that we are just as
entitled,'' says Morrish.
This is a man who bends over backwards to help the public. He goes to
public meetings to explain his case in often hostile surroundings. His
staff are specially trained to deal with complaints. And yes there are
complaints.
''I have got to say that when it comes down to it, there's a very
small minority of people who just don't accept the fact that we can cut
up the pavements and roads. I would put them at less than one per cent,
and I would suggest they are in the nature of Luddites,'' he says.
First there was the trees. The suggestion was that the trenches dug
through tree roots and killed them. It seems ironic, but there were so
many complaints that CableTel had to print leaflets explaining that they
had qualified arborists to advise the workers on how to avoid damaging
trees. Funny that. Cutting down trees to print leaflets about saving
trees. But they were printed on ''environment-friendly paper''.
''We now have a tree code which insists that we don't cut through any
branch bigger than my thumb. We haven't killed any trees,'' he
emphasises. ''People forget that our competitor BT was in the habit of
killing a tree for every pole it stuck its system on.''
But then there's the mess. A sea of mud and trenches not seen since
the Somme. Well, not quite. Not since the last time BT or ScottishPower,
or Strathclyde's roads department dug a trench. But, as John says,
people let them away with it.
That's when John goes to the public meetings. ''They always start with
people going there because of the mess, and what I say is yes, I
apologise for the problem, but it will improve, and if it doesn't
improve, I guarantee that if you contact us we will sort it out, and we
do,'' he says. Some of the meetings end well, with people taking an
interest in the services being provided.
Then there was Scotstoun. It was the worst. Not only was there a huge
outcry about possible damage to trees, but poor old CableTel managed to
dig up pavements which had just been freshly laid.
The company does try to liaise with the region so that such work can
be done at the same time. But you can't win. They then get accused of
being the reason that improvements to roads and pavements are delayed.
All this, though, is temporary. What also makes the natives restless
are what are called the above-ground cabinets. The green metal boxes
that transfer the fibre-optic signal into the cabling into people's
houses. John Morrish describes them as ''baby bears, mummy bears, and
daddy bears''. Nice try John, but they're really not that cuddly.
Baby bear is about 18 inches high for every 16 houses or so, then the
2ft 4ins mummy ones and finally the biggies; about the size of two
filing cabinets for every 4000 houses.
People naturally fear that they will detract from the value of their
property. But CableTel does all it can to site them unobtrusively. Paint
them to blend in. Even plant a tree in front of them if possible which
presumably solves two problems at once.
''In the Broomhill area we got some local politicians to go round the
area with us. They accepted the point that they had to go somewhere and
we did deals with bowling clubs to put them up out of the way or paint
them to merge,'' he explained.
In the future the cabinets could even add to the property value,
argues Morrish, as they will show a future buyer what services are
available locally. Well, perhaps.
Meanwhile though, CableTel gets blamed for everything. ''One woman
complained about the siting of one our boxes and when we went out to see
her we discovered it was a Plessey street lighting box,'' John sadly
relates.
So do things get better? Councillor Bob Logan in Kelvinside threatened
CableTel with an interdict to stop them working in a conservation area
because of the complaints.
Councillor Logan said: ''They were just barging into a conservation
area. But the possible interdict seemed to help. They were obliged to
consult and they agreed to tuck the really big boxes out of site, mainly
in lanes.
''I think when we actually told them what our concerns were, they were
taking it on board. Until then the teams laying the cable were charging
around with no control.
''We found dealing with some of their people very unsatisfactory. But
Morrish himself has been reasonably responsive.''
So a grudging acceptance that things do get better. And in years to
come, Glasgow will no doubt be boastful of being in at the start of an
information revolution.
But as John Morrish has been finding out, those who start revolutions
don't always get the credit they deserve.

Despite some Scottish successes, Anne Johnstone explains why lessons
still have to be learned in city housing scheme regeneration
IF YOU want to put a Government minister even more on the defensive
these days, try whispering ''Joseph Rowntree Foundation'' in his or her
ear. Hardly a week passes, it seems, without another report from the JRF
exposing some alleged shortcoming in the Government's social or economic
policies.
The most recent target is urban regeneration. A new report, Made to
Last: Creating Sustainable Neighbourhood and Estate Regeneration, says
short-term renewal schemes are failing to tackle the deep-rooted
problems of these areas. The proof is the way agencies often have to
return to the same area time after time. Their projects are meant to act
as catalysts, unlocking private investment and producing self-sustaining
development. Instead, says author Geoff Fordham, they act as sticking
plaster, covering a gaping wound but not healing it.
Fordham offers a number of practical suggestions to make such schemes
more effective. One is to taper off Government funding over several
years, rather than abruptly switching off the tap. Also he believes
those running regeneration programmes should be thinking about ''exit
strategies'' (how to extricate themselves when the scheme finishes),
right from the start. And rather than up sticks and leave after a set
period, renewal teams should set themselves targets and stay until they
hit them.
Whitfield, in Dundee, one of the Scottish Office's four Partnership
schemes, emerges well in this report, especially alongside its English
equivalents (City Challenge, Task Forces, and Estate Action). The
regeneration initiative there is being wound down, ahead of timetable,
because it has achieved its policy objectives. These involved specific
targets in three areas: employment and training, housing and
environment, and improved community services. It's not a panacea.
Community groups struggle for funding and employment and training
programmes are still vulnerable to Government cuts but a JobCentre has
opened and locally-controlled housing associations are responsible for
about 20% of housing. Also, a number of partners, including Dundee
District Council, have agreed to take over once the Partnership team
withdraws later this year.
But even in these flagship schemes, basic long-term problems remain to
be solved and some of them are getting worse. Nearly all today's
regeneration initiatives focus on housing. It's a good start. You only
need to listen to delighted tenants in the newly upgraded homes in
Paisley's Ferguslie Park or Glasgow's Castlemilk to realise the
difference good housing can make to someone's quality of life. But it's
only a start.
Meanwhile, other problems are getting worse. Douglas Robertson, of the
Housing Policy and Practice Unit at Stirling University, says the
combination of an ageing population, a high proportion of unemployed,
and others who for other reasons, such as disability, are unable to
work, means poverty becomes endemic in these areas. Council-house
allocation and housing association letting practices further concentrate
the poorest households in the same areas.
No wonder then that the biggest failure of regeneration schemes has
been in tackling unemployment. This effect is compounded in Scotland's
cities, says Robertson, by a regional development policy which is
effectively sucking manufacturing out into the new towns and development
agency areas like Lanarkshire, out of the reach of unemployed estate
dwellers without cars. ''You can't jump in your car and look for work if
you don't have one.''
And Scottish Enterprise and the LECs, don't have the same mandate or
budgets to invest in regeneration, unlike their predecessor, the
Scottish Development Agency. This has added to the tendency for such
programmes to focus heavily on housing. In the Castlemilk Partnership
scheme, for example, it has been estimated that 95% of the investment is
in housing.
Short-term renewal schemes are failing to
tackle the
deep-rooted problems of some areas

Scotland Under-18 11,
Ireland Under-18 15
SCOTTISH rugby's young hopefuls had a sharp lesson in one of lifes
truisms on Saturday: the show's not over until the fat lady sings.
Victory was snatched from their grasp by Jonathan Wilson's late try for
Ireland at Millbrae.
It was the third time the Irish had come from behind. The Scots seemed
to have forgotten the precedent that they had set for themselves in
Seville only nine days earlier, when they fought back for a creditable
victory during their Spanish tour.
Instead, they had brought back different memento of Spain, a
debilitating bug that swept through the squad, enforcing two changes in
the team on the morning of the Ayr match.
Ireland deserved victory. Despite Paul Millar's lineout efforts, the
Irish forwards were more effective, especially in their driving game,
and their backs were sharper and more adventurous, making good use of
Kevin Mullen's pace from full back.
Also, the Irish created more chances, and they scored tries from two
of them.
Mark Maguire's looping run and Kevin O'Riordan's half-break put Tom
Tierney over after nine minutes, a quick reply to John Melvins opening
penalty goal, and, more important, Ian Ryan exploited loose lineout ball
to send Wilson in for the winning try. Maguire converted, adding to his
earlier penalty goal.
Graeme Inglis, Gareth Walker, Kenny Day, and Ross Hunter fought
especially well against the tide, and Melvin scored all of the Scottish
points. His try gave Scotland an 8-5 lead early in the second half,
after an Inglis drive into the Irish twenty-two, Duncan Godfrey's
scrummage pick-up, and Ross Hunter's link to give the Preston Lodge wing
an overlap for the right corner.
The wing's second penalty goal seemed to have set the Scots up for
victory, but time was left for the Irish to strike back yet again.
Scotland Under-18 -- D R Hemmings (Jed-Forest); J S Melvin (Preston
Lodge FP), A P Hunter (Biggar), R I Steel (Berwick), P Findlay (Aberdeen
University); N Thomas (Portobello FP), R I Hunter (Currie); R T Harvey

(Hutchesons'/ Aloysians), captain, D R Godfrey (Harlequins), G J Walker
(Hawick PSA). Replacements -- G J McCallum (Sandbach) for Walker
(temporary), J-P Gallivan (Edinburgh Wanderers) for Harvey (61 minutes).
Ireland Under-18 -- K Mullen (Clonkilty); J Finegan (Drogheda), K
O'Riordan (Youghal), I Dunne (Tullamore), N Johnston (Dromore); M
Maguire (Banbridge), T Tierney (Richmond), captain; T Clifford

THERE is a delicious irony in the Little Englander scam being hatched
at Twickenham which is designed to kick Scottish, Irish, and Welsh
players out of English club rugby.
While the gloriously monikered John Jeavons-Fellows and his cronies at
RFU HQ dream of Jock, Paddy, and Taffy-free zones, the Scottish Rugby
Union at Murrayfield is working up a scheme of its own which is aimed at
keeping the top Scots in Scotland.
No problem there, then, you might think. Both unions are working
towards a common goal. It is not, though, as simple as that. There is an
issue involved here which transcends rugby.
Ian McGeechan is right when he says that what the RFU wants to do is
tantamount to racial discrimination. Consider the outcry that would have
erupted if the RFU, with the arrogance which has characterised its
behaviour throughout the history of the game, had been debating whether
to exclude blacks or Asians or any other ethnic minority from their
domestic game.
There has been talk, too, that if the Twickenham mandarins get their
way then European legislation might be invoked. This would involve
restraint of trade regulations and, however far down the line to
professionalism we might be, there are precious few rugby players -- New
Zealander Andy Haden excepted -- who would dare to claim that rugby is
their primary occupation.
Jeavons-Fellows, in his capacity as chairman of the RFU competitions'
committee, maintains that England national selectors are overlooking
untapped talent because when they go to see England's top teams, a large
majority of the players are not ''English-qualified.''
This is, of course, bunkum. There isn't a Scotsman, a Welshman or an
Irishman alive who would keep a home-bred player out of a club side if
that ''English qualified'' player was good enough.
The Jeavons-Fellows masterplan does not have the support of England's
top clubs, who are furious that they have not been consulted. Frank
Gibbon, chairman of the senior clubs association, says that the RFU is
acting with indecent haste and that no account has been taken of the
misery likely to be caused to the displaced players.
And neither does the plan have universal backing within the portals of
Twickenham itself. RFU president Dennis Easby believes, rightly, that if
the exiles were shown the door, then the overall standard of English
club rugby would plummet.
Jeavons-Fellows argues the plan is not anti-Scot, Irish, and Welsh. It
is, he says, pro-English. Just for a moment, take that argument out of
the rugby arena into the world of business and industry.
The Scots, a remarkable nation of only 5m souls, have over the
centuries contributed on a scale which far outweighs their numerical
importance to the general well-being of the United Kingdom. Should the
City of London, the civil service and the world of commerce invoke
legislation that would deny Scots the jobs which they have won by dint
of their expertise? Of course not.
There is in Jeavons-Fellows' scheme more than an echo of Little
Englander sentiments expressed by that braggart of a Scoto-phobe, Samuel
Johnson. He it was who sneerlingly remarked that the most noble prospect
a Scotchman ever observed was the high road to England.
The RFU slips easily into arrogance. Remember when it was being
suggested that the English might withdraw from the Five Nations'
tournament because the other home unions weren't quite in the same
league as the boys in white, red, and blue (or whatever colour the
England national strip happens to be this week). They should remember
that nothing lasts forever.
There is about this English rugby for the English thing just a hint of
the kind of childish expostulations that we might expect from the far
right of the Tory party. They say the Church of England represents the
Tory Party at prayer. The RFU is providing a distasteful representation
of the Tory Party at play.

American football is in a different league -- thanks to some
hard-headed businessmen with a long-term financial goal.
AMERICAN football touched down in Scotland yesterday afternoon amid
the drizzle of Meadowbank Stadium. The waters broke at the birth of what
Rupert Murdoch and the National Football League hope will be a
billion-dollar business. Scotland's Claymores may have battled against
Dusseldorf's Rhein Fire, but the real fight is off the field.
The crowd cheered and banners flew as little children's eyes lit up at
the real-life gladiators battling below. Yet it remains to be seen if
professional American football can become the sport of the year 2000. At
the World League launch, crowds were estimated at 20,000. On Thursday
Claymores' manager, Sandy Waters, said he would be happy with 10,000.
Those who turned up, attracted by the cheap #5 tickets, enjoyed a
carnival atmosphere with fireworks and cheerleaders. One notable
absentee was coach Lary Kuharich, who was fired last Tuesday. However
there have been poorer casualties in the battle to put the public behind
a new national sports team.
Remember the adverts? Six guys staring out behind helmets and war
paint under the adline: ''At last, a Scottish football team in the same
league as the Germans and the Dutch.''
Unfortunately big Gary McNey is back driving buses, John Letham's
driving a taxi. Steve McCusker, Don Edmondston, and Pat Shields went
back to drawing the dole. Only Ben Torrierio, the running back, remains
one of the few Scots in the squad, comprised almost exclusively of
potential professionals for America's National Football League.
But it would seem national identity and victory are of little interest
in the wider business arena. The World League has two agendas. The first
offers a training opportunity for inexperienced players. The second, and
most important, is to make money.
In many ways the World League is a marketing man's dream. NFL retail
merchandise generated $3200m in America last year. ''I don't know how
much bigger it can go,'' said Andy Thompson of London's NFL merchandise
department. In the first year of the new league the marketing men hope
to recoup $20m in specific World League merchandise.
At Murrayfield, Intersport holds the official licence for selling
merchandise while Sports Division in East Kilbride will open an official
Claymores department next month. Keeping both chain stores sweet can
only maximise sales as kids tug parents along to buy the latest sports
presents.
In Scotland both the Daily Record and ScotRail have hooked their image
on The Claymores' handle. Since the announcement last summer that
Scotland would be a host nation The Claymores have attracted a storm of
media attention. From press conferences at Edinburgh Airport, through
cheerleader trials to the pre-season training camps in Atlanta, they
have been documented, many believe, beyond anyone's interest.
The goal of both the NFL and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation through
Fox TV is to create an artificial market through their $44m investment
in the World League. Other sponsors include Reebok, Budweiser, and
Wilson Sports who all see plenty of opportunities to exploit a
strengthing European economy. But is there the interest?
No-one in Europe is complaining about the lack of American football
teams. Previous attempts to launch the sport over the past 10 years have
all ended in failure. But never before has there been such a
concentrated push and a strong media profile. Both the NFL and Murdoch
are prepared to take a bath for the first few years but the money should
be dry and mounting by the year 2000.
''No-one here is thinking of failure. Mr Murdoch understands his
European punters and he wouldn't invest in something that would fail.
Reebok wouldn't invest in something that would fail. Europe has always
been the NFL's priority market,'' said Andy Thompson.
In Britain, interest in American football has declined drastically. In
1985 three million viewers watched Channel Four's NFL coverage. Last
year the figure was 500,000. Yet the marketing company behind The
Claymores' #280,000 promotion, McCann Erickson Scotland, says 500,000
Scots, when asked, expressed an interest in occasionally watching an
American football game.
This has been reported by the media as 500,000 Scots regularly
watching American football. A Channel Four spokesman said a generous
figure, including those watching satellite, might be 250,000.
Scott Ferguson, head of news and current affairs at Scottish
Television, which will be screening highlights of Claymores games said:
''I don't think there are a lot of people who would tune in for a whole
three-hour game. People may tune in for highlights.'' In a shrewd deal
Scottish will not pay for the footage, filmed by BSkyB.
''World League football is driven by money and television. But I don't
necessarily think that's a bad thing. American football is very much a
TV sport in the states. Fox TV and News Corporation always play the long
game. I'm sure the World League will lose a lot of money and I don't
think it will sell many tickets but down the line it will break even.''
Running costs are being kept down through low pay for the players.
Quarter-backs receive $20,000 per season, other players earn $15,000 per
season while kickers are on just $15,000. Such low pay is accepted for
the chance to show their skills to NFL scouts.
The World League first ran in 1991 and 1992 with three European teams
and six American teams but interest in the States never grew and the
plug was pulled when viewers refused to turn on. ''We really didn't have
a business plan,'' said NFL president Neil Austrian. This time there
will be no American teams and a plan is in place and designed to
generate cash by tapping old rivalries.
Germany, because of the good attendance in previous leagues, has two
teams, Rhein Fire, based in Dusseldorf, and the Frankfurt Galaxy, which
will stoke inter-city tension. For the forthcoming Claymores versus
Monarchs game, the ad campaign will focus on Scotland's chance to
''crown'' the auld enemy. Yet can it generate the same passion with
Americans playing both parts? Will Scotland, as well as Spain, Germany,
Holland, and England fall for an American import?
At the relaunch last summer Austrian said: ''This time, we've done a
lot of research and gone for cities with fan interest which would work
for TV and can generate some local rivalry.
''No-one thinks it's going to happen overnight. It's a long-term thing
and it will take 10 years to establish the league.'' The ultimate goal
is billions of dollars profit from a successfully established true World
League which would include an expanded European league and an Asian
market.
Waters, who worked for 12 years with the Denver Broncos, said: ''The
investment will be recouped through ticket sales, television,
merchandise, and bringing in other sponsors . . . but it has to start
with the fans in the stadium.''
Aubrey Malden, managing director of McCann Erickson, said the reason
for the press hype was simple: ''It's razzmatazz, it's showbusiness. If
you look at the number of people who watch Gladiators, the game is very
gladiatorial. It's big and it's buzzy.
''The guys want to see the cheerleaders and the girls want to see the
beefy men. It's back to the coliseum days of full entertainment. It's a
mixture of sport and entertainment. It's American showbusiness.''

Scottish Schools 23
Irish Schools 29
THERE were those at Balgray on Saturday who were critical of ''flying
machine'' James Craig, the St Aloysius winger.
The insinuation was that Craig offers sheer pace -- but nothing else.
His handling has been criticised in the past but he safely fielded one
towering up-and-under in the face of an Irish onslaught and late in the
second half he scooped a pass off his bootlaces and then outflanked his
marker for his second and the Scottish side's third try.
The Scots' opening try, scored by Alan Bulloch, was created by Craig's
intrusion through the stand-off channel and the flying winger sped
through for the second.
The downside was that Craig failed to claim an Irish cross kick, which
was allowed to bounce, providing Irish flanker Ian Girvan with the
chance to collect the loose ball and drive over for the try which put
his side ahead for the first time.
Craig, too, was one of the home players guilty of foul play, causing a
promising penalty situation for the Scots to be reversed.
Keith Yuille, the Scots coach, was disappointed by the number of silly
penalties his side gave away. The Irish stand-off Richard Ormond
punished the Scots with nine points by goaling three awards, while his
partner, Cork's Keith Murphy, struck a 25-metre drop goal from broken
play shortly after Girvan's try.
The other Irish tries came from Marcus Horan and John Keehan while
Ormond had a conversion as well as his three penalties. Gordon Ross
managed only one conversion and two penalties for the Scottish boys.
Teams:
Scottish Schools -- D Mallinson (George Watson's College); J Craig (St
Aloysius College), A Bulloch (Hutchesons' Grammar School), J Mayer
(Merchiston Castle School), C Keenan (Fettes College); G Ross (George
Heriot's School), S Hannah, (captain) (Merchiston Castle School); P

MANLY from Sydney followed in the footsteps of Randwick (1990) and Bay
of Plenty (1992) as southern hemisphere guests to gather in the Melrose
Sevens trophy, but not before they had been fully stretched in the final
by a robust Kelso side who refused to lie down but ran out of time in
defeat by 29-22 before a 16,000 crowd at sun-drenched Greenyards.
Installed as second favourites to Gala, Manly brought a typically
physical approach to their tackle engagement that carried an
intimidatory factor. Their other strength lay in their ability to spread
the load as instanced in the haul of five tries by their giant forward
Rob Gallacher whose two in the final were timely individualistic
efforts.
Even when they lost their captain and top try-scorer with six, Kevin
Reber, Manly yet allied power running to clever work on the ball,
intuitive positioning, and a positive relish for taking on a long run.
Kelso, however, matched them in vigour and commitment in creating a
thrilling rally that had the crowd roaring as they cut back from 29-12
to 29-22. At the very heart of that renaissance was Graeme Aitchison,
whose unique achievement was to score all 22 Kelso points with four
tries and a conversion. Kelso had been a mite fortunate to beat Stirling
County 24-19 in the quarter-finals, the winning try by Adam Roxburgh
owing much to the pursuing Ken Harper checking as he thought the referee
had blown for an infringement.
Apart from Gallacher's two tries in the final from lengthy gallops,
Meli Nakuata, Ben Tuipoluto, and Trent Herring also scored tries and
Drew Claydon's two conversions kept Manly just out of reach, especially
as they placed tight handcuffs on Stuart Lang who had done some splendid
long-range running for six cracking tries.
The Kelso forward trio took the game to Manly in unceremonious fashion
and Clive Millar's fine all-round performance included a cheeky
chip-and-chase try that took Kelso through 19-14 in the semi-finals
against the Cape Town side, Villager. The South Africans amassed 85
points in dismissing Langholm, then the favourites Gala, and had the top
points-scorer in the tournament in Percival Montgomery, a rangy quickie
with huge potential who had five tries and ten conversions for 45
points.
Gala seemed to possess the necessary fire-power in screeching pace all
along their back line as Michael Dods, Chris Dalgleish, Mark Moncrieff,
and Neil Crooks (2) all scored tries as they cruised through 31-5,
against Currie who, with Ally Donaldson as orchestrator and Colin
Robertson (2) and the dynamic Steve Logan as try-scorers, had created
the shock elimination of Hawick.
However, the South Africans, having conceded two early tries to
Moncrieff for 14-0, then placed claustrophobic pressure on anything in
maroon that moved and with Montgomery as spearhead, proceeded to run in
five long-distance scores in one of which the bearded Richard Britton
showed a remarkable turn of pace, for a 33-14 margin.
The only seeds not to reach the quarter-finals were Cambridge
University, who led Kelso 19-17 before Lang's third try took Kelso
through at the eleventh hour.
The Ulsterman, Innes Gray, scored three tries as the other seeds,
Oxford University, accounted for Watsonians 24-5, but Jed-Forest put
together some rippling passages for tries by Paul Douglas (2) and Chris
Richards in defeat of Oxford by 19-5. Jed-Forest, however, were 24-0
down to Manly for whom the bulky Gallacher scored direct from kick-off
and Luke Donnan proved an astute playmaker. Tries by the Douglas boys,
Paul and Andrew, merely placed a better reflection on Jed's 14-31
defeat.
* QUEENSLAND made it an Australian double when they retained the
southern hemisphere's Super 10 title with a 30-16 victory over Transvaal
in Johannesburg on Saturday.
In an intense struggle at Ellis Park, the Australians ran in four
tries against the reigning South African provincial champions, whose
only touchdown came in the final minute.
* A SIGN of better times for the once-legendary London Welsh: The club
that were well-nigh unbeatable 20-odd years ago have started the long
hard climb back to the top, winning promotion to the Courage League
fourth division -- and are the only club unbeaten in league action in
England.

IT WAS a world-weary, pragmatic punter who provided the necessary
contrast to the celebrating Pitmans, Johnsons and their bookmaking
hero-worshippers at the conclusion of another memorable Martell Grand
National day at Aintree. Trudging away from a course still glowing in
warm sunshine, he bade farewell to a steward and added: ''Wasn't it a
beautiful day to do your brains?''
National day at Liverpool, with its combination of gamblers,
country-set experts, once-a-year poseurs, horse-lovers and professional
competitors, inevitably tends to inspire extremes of emotion. Yet, if
joy and disappointment mingle in the aftermath of the big race,
resentment does not get a look-in.
Everybody, including the members of the media to whom she vowed never
again to speak a couple of years ago, shared in the sheer delight of
Jenny Pitman, who sent six horses in a kind of Panzer attack to the
great race and one of them, not the most fancied, Royal Athlete, outran
some of the best chasers in the country to give her a second victory in
the race no woman had won until she trained Corbiere to lift the prize
in 1983.
As she was also the trainer of Esha Ness, who finished first in the
National that wasn't in 1993, no-one can dispute that she has discovered
the secret of success in the race every trainer jockey and owner
desperately wants to win.
Now Jenny wants a few days to think about whether she should send the
new Lambourn hero to Ayr for the Stakis Scottish National on April 22.
Considering that she had pondered leaving out the horse from the Martell
National on Saturday in favour of the Ayr race -- ''I felt Royal Athlete
would be a certainty for the Scottish National'' -- the champion might
be something to bet on if she rates him well enough to tackle the
double. The presence of the Aintree star would do no harm, either, to
the attendance at Ayr in less than a fortnight.
The sight of Mrs Pitman, a formidable lady who, in her angry mode, is
reputedly best sighted from the other end of the binoculars, giggling
like an errant schoolgirl as she exchanged barbs with the press and TV
gang, was a perfect cameo of what the National can do to people.
It would be churlish to dwell on her self-imposed ban on talking to
the Fourth Estate which she rescinded after Esha Ness was such an
unlucky representative of the stable at Aintree two years ago when the
race was declared void, but it does show that such excessive reactions
are a bit silly.
What is important is that the lady is a magnificent trainer of
steeplechasers. Not many in the business could have bought three
unbroken three-year-old horses in the same batch that were to go on to
the kind of fame achieved by Royal Athlete, the Cheltenham Gold Cup
winner and previous Grand National runner-up, Garrison Savanah, and Esha
Ness.
'Alfie,' the stable's pet name for Royal Athlete, had been due to run
in the Gold Cup, but the trainer decided to miss that race because he
was not right. ''Plan B was to talk the owners into running him in the
Scottish National, because I thought he was a certainty there. He had
fallen here before and in Ireland, too, so I felt it might be better to
go straight to Scotland. But I was overruled.''
The training feat of bringing a horse with one dodgy leg to win such a
demanding race on fast ground cannot be over-emphasised. Her powers of
persuasion ought to be respected too, considering that she managed to
get the brothers Johnson, Libby (short for Liberty) and Gary, to take
over the horse. Said Libby: ''It is bad enough discovering a horse has a
'leg' once you have raced it but to be asked to buy a horse who already
has one is a bit much. But she is the boss.''
Mrs Pitman had intended to put 'Alfie,' who was a juvenile hurdler at
the time, through the Ascot Sales but the Johnsons are not about to
regret taking heed of her advice. The new champion has to be trained
differently from any of her other horses. ''You'll notice he has white
legs and you have to treat him with cotton wool, just like I try to
treat you lot but you don't appreciate it.''
One man who had no complaints about his treatment form the great lady
was Jason Titley, the Irishman who had his first booking from her on
Monday, when she asked him to ride Royal Athlete. It was also Jason's
first time riding in the national. And so we had a jockey having his
first try at the race on a old horse with a bad leg starting at 40-1.
How did we miss it?
Jason, who decided to try his luck in England after his winners
''dried up'' in his native country, had only one anxious moment, when he
looked round to find Norman Williamson on Master Oats also looking
round. His worries were soon eased, however, as the Gold Cup star was
not able to go through with the finish expected on ground that did not
suit. Carrying top weight, Master Oats still ran a wonderful race to be
seventh.
Mrs Pitman's other runners showed up well at different stages.
Superior Finish and Do Be Brief led at different stages while Garrison
Savannah, chosen by stable jockey Warren Marston, plugged on well to be
ninth. Lusty Light, the best-backed runner from the stable, fell at the
first.
There was not much doubt about the flop of the day. That was last
year's winner Miinnehoma who, either because he hated the ground or was
not willing to tackle these fences again, just would not race.
In contrast, Party Politics, winner in 1992, ran a marvellous race to
be second, while Dubacilla did best of the more fancied horses, making
up ground from a long way back to finish fourth, half a length behind
100-1 Over The Deel.
Best quote of the day came from Simon McNeill, the jockey of Jumbeau,
who fell at the first. ''You can say I was going really well at the
time.''

PROFESSOR Bernard Isaacs, a distinguished Glasgow geriatrician, has
died. He was in his seventies.
He played a fundamental role in establishing geriatric medicine as a
speciality. His death sees the loss of a man whose enthusiasm and skills
helped bring the profession from ''the darkness of long-stay wards into
the spotlight of academic medicine'', according to colleagues.
Dr Isaacs, born in 1924, attended Kilmarnock Academy and Glasgow
University, and after National Service trained at Stobhill General
Hospital where the first academic Department of Geriatric Medicine was
formed.
In 1961, he became a consultant in geriatrics at Foresthall Hospital
before establishing a department at Glasgow Royal Infirmary which he led
until 1974.
Dr Isaacs was appointed Charles Hayward Professor of Geriatric
Medicine at Birmingham University in 1975. He retired in 1989, and was
awarded a CBE. He then moved to Israel, where he worked at the Brookdale
Institute of Gerontology.
A committed clinician and teacher of international repute, he
contributed greatly to the reputation for excellence achieved by British
geriatric medicine.
Dr Isaacs, who died in Jerusalem, is survived by his wife, Dorothy,
and four sons.

MIDLOTHIAN were involved in the last two major domestic finals of the
indoor season at the weekend but suffered mixed fortunes.
On Saturday they retained their CIS Insurance Scottish Cup with a
battling 78-75 win over East Lothian at Bainfield, but yesterday had to
settle for the runners-up spot behind Nithsdale when they lost 6-2 in
the Greengauge Team Championship final at Lanarkshire.
Saturday's Scottish Cup victory was well merited after a superb seesaw
final. Midlothian had three winning rinks with Willie Rankin laying the
victory foundations with a 19-15 win over Willie Wood. The Peacock
brothers, Willie and David, added further wins, Willie beating Angus
Blair 21-18, David beating Ian Bell 20-18.
However, Midlothian's hopes of a double ended at Wishaw when they
could manage just one win in the Greengauge Team Championship final.
Nithsdale took the title with wins in the singles, pairs, and triples.
Graeme Maxwell beat Derek McLean 21-15, husband-and-wife duo Kate and
Colin Peacock hit back from 5-12 down to beat Jean Miller and David
Peacock 22-17, and in the Triples Mario Motroni's side coasted to a 20-5
win over Agnes Melrose's team. Details:
CIS Insurance Scottish Cup final: Midlothian 78, East Lothian 75 (W
Rankin 19, W W Wood 15; D Peacock 20, I Bell 18; W Peacock 21, A Blair
18; P Conlan 18, G Robertson 24).
Greengauge Scottish Team Championship final: Nithsdale 6 points,
Midlothian 2 points (Midlothian players first). Singles -- G Maxwell 21,
D McLean 15. Pairs -- K/C Peacock 22, J Miller/D Peacock 17. Triples --
A Motroni/W Haining/M Motroni 20, W Amos/D/A Melrose 5. Fours -- K/M
Love/P Fraser/D Love 12, G Kay/S McLeish/J Conlan/W Peacock 25.

yesterday's 34-8 win over Featherstone.
The Kiwi grabbed one try and landed seven goals to take his points
tally for the season to 302 from 18 tries and 116 goals, including two
drop goals.
And that has taken him past the previous best for a first division
campaign of 295 by Leigh's John Woods in 1983-84.

MURRAY Grierson had to work hard for his victory in Saturday's
Anderson Cars Renault Rally at Aberdeen.
The joint championship status event had attracted the best drivers
from both the Burmah Scottish and Mintex British Championships, but
Dalbeattie's fastest man on four wheels rose to the challenge, winning
by 22 seconds.
On the first of nine Special Stages, reigning British Champion Chris
Mellors was fastest. But it was Grierson by a second on the next stage
and thereafter he hung on.
As Grierson eked out precious seconds over former British champion
David Gillanders, he in turn did the same to Mellors, until they arrived
at the final stage. The Aberdonian had what he thought was a fairly
secure 15 second cushion, but in the space of four miles, Mellors
converted the deficit into a two second advantage to finish runner-up.
Grierson and Gillanders are therefore tied at the top of the British
series points tables after two rounds with Mellors one point behind but
in the Burmah Scottish series Edinburgh's Gordon Boyd has taken over at
the top. Results:
1, M Grierson/S Merry (Subaru Legacy) 70min 26sec; 2, C Mellors/B Goff
(Ford Escort Cosworth) 70-48; 3, D Gillanders/B Thomas (Ford Escort
Cosworth) 70-50; 4, B Lyall/N Ewing (Ford Escort Cosworth) 71-28; 5, T
Smith/R Jones (Ford Escort Cosworth) 72-28; 6, R Duckworth/M Broomfield
(Ford Sierra XR) 72-43; 7, M Horne/M Pearson (Ford Sierra Cosworth)
73-28; 8, N Dougan/C Wood (Ford Escort Cosworth) 74-11; 9, T
Ellis-Jones/H Lewis (Nissan Sunny Gti-R) 74-12; 10, S Smith/B Hughes
(Lancia Delta HF) 74-16.

COLONEL William Monteith and his wife Maude, who celebrate their joint
eightieth birthdays on Wednesday, are to be honoured at Edinburgh today
for the tremendous support they have given their local track over the
years.
To express their gratitude, the racecourse executive have entitled the
second race the Colonel and Maude Monteith 80th Birthday Celebration
Handicap.
As owners of both Flat and National Hunt horses, trained by their son
Peter at Rosewell, Midlothian, they have raced at the track whenever
possible.
Some of their best purchases were made from selling and claiming races
at Edinburgh. Mrs Monteith successfully bid 3900 guineas for Topleigh in
1983, when he won a seller for Sir Mark Prescott. The High Top gelding
gave a creditable performance in the 1984 Triumph Hurdle and won four
hurdles races for his owner.
The Colonel, who had something of a reputation for buying horses out
of claiming races -- not always welcome -- made his most successful
purchase at Edinburgh in 1991, when he secured Dizzy, a three-year-old
grey mare, out of Barry Hills' stable for 8000 guineas.
She won five hurdle races as a juvenile, and three as a four-year-old
on her way to winning the 1994 County Hurdle at Cheltenham.
The Colonel, who has had 51 winners, all trained by Peter, still goes
racing. But sadly, neither he nor his wife will be at Edinburgh today.
''For health reasons they have gone off to Tenerife,'' explained Peter
Monteith yesterday.

AUSTRALIA scrambled back into contention with the West Indies on the
second day of the second Test in Antigua.
The tourists were 16 for no wicket in their second innings at the
close, still 28 behind, having dismissed the West Indies for 260 on a
day of fluctuating fortunes at the Recreation Ground.
Brian Lara, returning to the scene of the world record 375 he scored
against England last year, looked like making it a one-man show again as
he murdered the bowling during the first and second sessions.
But Steve Waugh had Lara caught by David Boon for 88 as the
Australians cleaned up the last five West Indies wickets for 20 runs.
Australia lead the four-test series 1-0 after a 10-wicket win in the
first test at Bridgetown. Scores:
Australia 216 and 16 for no wicket; West Indies 260 (B Lara 88).
* SACHIN Tendulkar struck an unbeaten century as India claimed an
eight-wicket victory with over 16 overs to spare against Sri Lanka in
the limited-over Asia Cup in Sharjah.
Manoj Prabhakar scored 60 during an opening stand of 161 with
Tendulkar, who went on to reach 112 as India made 206-2 in response to
Sri Lanka's total of 202 for nine.
Hashan Tillekeratne, who was run out for 48, had been the top scorer
for Sri Lanka during their 50 overs with Vankatesh Prasad claiming three
for 37.

Edinburgh Academicals 11,
Heriot-Watt University 15
(after extra time)
THE Scottish Women's Cup final was won by Heriot-Watt in the last
minute of extra time. Acads failed to touch down a missed penalty
attempt by Paula Chalmers and Kim Craigie followed up to score. Chalmers
then converted the try to add to her penalty after 40 minutes and the
referee's whistle blew for the end of the game.
Acads had looked like winners in the second half of ordinary time
after a Sue Brodie try and Janine Clabbie penalty, until fly half Denise
Fairbairn finally scored a try for Heriot-Watt at the end of normal time
after a long period of pressure.
Crabbie again landed a penalty for Acads early in extra time, and this
looked to be enough until the final moments of the game.

PEOPLE tend to associate fencing with the antics of the Three
Musketeers, the swashbuckling excesses of Errol Flynn's Hollywood days,
even the Mark of Zorro. But few picture women being involved in the
boys' own adventure.
Yet today Pauline McManus, a 17-year-old from Blantyre, sets off for
Paris to battle it out at the World Youth and World Cadet championships.
She is the only Scot in the British team and with two other English
girls will take part in the under-17 foil competiton.
In some sports the young successful players have a decidedly brattish
tendency and so it's always encouraging to meet someone who makes light
of her achievements and is refreshingly down to earth.
For this unassuming teenager Paris is a return to the world stage.
Last year she competed in Mexico.
Many people have a lifelong ambition to take up a particular sport,
there is a family tradition involved, or they are inspired by a
personality's success. But Pauline came to fencing more or less by
accident. A sport likened to playing chess while doing a 100-metre
sprint, it is one of only four sports which have featured in every
Olympic Games since their inauguration.
At 11, a fencing development officer called at Pauline's primary
school and persuaded a group of youngsters to try out the sport. From
then on she was hooked.
The standard of young Scottish fencers has been rising dramatically in
recent years and Pauline's record is impressive. She has won 10 Scottish
titles and three British ones. But she tells you this almost with
reluctance. Yet her enjoyment of and enthusiasm for her sport shines
through in all she says.
Her forte is in foil competition. This is a light flexible weapon and
hits are scored with the point on the trunk of the body only. She has
won epee titles too but does not have the same affinity for that weapon.
To qualify for Paris a points system is used. This involves results
for four home competitions and two foreign ones. This calls for a high
level of commitment. In the past year Pauline has had to spend many
weekends away from home and, as most of the competitions are in the
south, hours of tedious travel have to precede the hours spent in a
sports hall.
The contests can be particularly intense too. Whereas in many sports
an event is spread over a couple of days, in fencing the competition can
start as early as 7am and go on all day until a winner is found as late
as 10 in the evening.
This leaves little time for sightseeing. Even in Mexico she was
oblivious to much of her surroundings.
''Your attention is so focused on the competition that everything else
takes second place,'' said Pauline. However, she is hoping to visit some
art galleries and museums during her visit to France. Maybe that will
help when she sits her Higher Art.
When she comes back from Paris the exams will be upon her. She plans
to sit four Highers. Typically, she equates most things to fencing.
''My studying has suffered this year,'' said Pauline, who plans to be
a physiotherapist. ''I may go down to England to study. In many ways I'd
rather stay here, but by going south I'll have a wider range of
opposition and I've got to know so many people through the competitions
down there.''
Next year she will concentrate on her studies and won't spend so much
time on the demanding fencing circuit.
''I plan to take a year out,'' she said. ''I will still fence but not
as much as before. It's partly to avoid burn-out. Many fencers get knee
injuries and then have to stop. I don't want that to happen to me.''
Ask her what her school friends think of her achievements and she just
shrugs her shoulders. ''I don't really talk about fencing at school.''
Again that modesty. It's more likely they talk about where to go on the
weekends when Pauline is at home.
In the meantime, Pauline has been training for the visit to France.
Her coach, David Rollo, has attracted many of the rising stars to the
club in Blantyre. She goes there twice a week and does some work in the
gym in between times. But fencing itself is the best preparation for the
world stage.
Like Zorro, Pauline is certain to leave her mark on the fencing world.
Maybe as soon as Wednesday.

''Look at that,'' said David Leslie once as he watched the Scottish
players' wives board a bus to go and watch their men folk play an
international, ''you should never take your women into war.''
Well, following the example set by some cricket and football teams in
the past, the Scottish players can take their wives and/or girlfriends
on tour with them to South Africa this summer when, on May 26, they kick
off their World Cup campaign against Cote d'Ivoire in Rustenburg.
Doddie Weir, they say, is already revelling in the possibility of
asking some babe to be his girlfriend so that she can ''have a wee break
with him in South Africa.''
In a grown-up, modern-man, non-sexist, green, user-friendly,
Internet-surfing, new-woman kind of world perhaps you'd expect an old
poofter like me to agree with all of this. Sadly, I don't. I think it's
a recipe for disaster, and, apparently, so do the players, who have told
the management so.
Don't get me wrong. The wives and girlfriends, as we've seen in this
paper before, have been an immense credit to their country. They have a
vivaciousness and abundance of character that only a special few girls
have in life, and they are good, strong-headed, likeable ladies.
The way it is to work is like this, I believe. As the men prepare for
games, the wives and girlfriends will be, as a group, in Sun City. After
games they will, like the proverbial bus-load of nurses on Lions tours,
be, yes, bused up to the venues to join their menfolk for the post-match
revelry and help them lick their bruises, and give them something to
dull the pain. Some of their chat? Only joking!
We are talking pressure rugby here and we are talking about a group of
players that will want to let off steam, dissect the game, enjoy their
own company in a mood of relief, and -- crucially -- talk to the
opposition.
It may not be the most important bit of PR in the world, but you
shouldn't forget how much inter-team bitterness stems from direct
man-to-opponent talk, or cold shoulder, after a game and I can just see
the effect on the opposition as the Scottish boys arrive at the
post-match function, say hello, and then depart with a quick: ''Sorry,
must go and talk to the wife.''
I can't see the point of going on a tour and speaking and mixing with
no-one but your wife, or a group of players with their wives, after a
game. Imagine the following scenario.
International threequarter player goes up to bar to buy a round of
drinks, and stays there for 35 minutes having a chat with Gavin
Hastings. He goes back to the table to see unhappy looking wife.
''This is supposed to be our time together,'' she says. ''I've been
cooped up with all the other wives all week going to aerobic classes,
talking non-stop about you lot, and fending off the attentions of the
Australian surfers' captain who was on holiday there with some of his
chums. We went into the bush for a day.
''Did you book the theatre tickets?'' ''Sorry,'' he says, looking past
her left ear at one of the unmarried boys in the party who has just
arrived in the room with Miss Johannesburg 1995. Miss Johannesburg has
brought three of her pals with her. ''Anyway, isn't this supposed to be
my tour? I'm exhausted. Listen, let's go over and speak to the Ivory
Coast lads, they'd love to meet you.''
Yes, it'll all end in tears without a doubt.
The other strange aspect of it all is that I can understand a man
being motivated in a sport so that he can earn money from it and get
success, but I'd hate to think that a wife or girlfriend would have the
capability of putting pressure on a husband to succeed so that she too
could benefit by getting a wee trip abroad.
On a purely work-based front, and the players and wives are still
amateur, it is far from the best solution for them both to have take
holidays from work and not really see each other during those holidays.
The thought process behind the SRU's gesture is magnificent. But
wouldn't it have been so much better to do it the way the French have
done it with their players in the past, and that is to give the team,
and their wives, a holiday together after the World Cup, away from the
tensions of touring and training. They would genuinely be together then,
and there would be scope for children to tag along, too.
There's a time and place for everything, and the time and place for
the wives and girlfriends is not, I'm afraid to say, in Sun City during
the World Cup.

GRIDIRON: By STEVE LIVINGSTON
Claymores 17, Rhein Fire 19
IT was expected to go off with a bang, but in the end it turned out to
be a bit of a damp squib for the Scottish Claymores, edged out by the
Germans in their first game of the World League season at Murrayfield
yesterday.
With just 20 seconds left it fell, appropriately, to a kicker -- Arden
Czyzewski -- to win the match for the Claymores.
But the former Florida University star pulled his kick left to burst
the balloon on the big day and send the 10,346 crowd home disappointed.
Later, Czyzewski admitted; ''There was nothing wrong with the snap.
The ball was placed fine. I just pulled it left like pulling a golf
shot. It's one of those things.''
Despite three spectacular touchdowns and a thrilling fourth quarter
finish, Scotland's introduction to professional gridiron was mainly
dominated by both defences and a flurry of yellow penalty flags --
typical of a season opener.
While disappointed, Claymores' head coach, Jim Criner, was proud of
his team's display. ''Losing like that is tough,'' he said, ''but we
lost as a team.
''We made a few mistakes, and the disruption we had earlier in the
week (head coach Larry Kuharich was sacked) did set us back slightly.
But we have plenty to work on and I'm sure we can come back from this.''
Claymores went behind in the eleventh minute after Rhein intercepted
Matt Blundin's pass at the Scots' 38-yard line.
Rhein quarterback Gino Torretta completed a 35-yard pass to tight end
Rob Moore to set up a two-yard touchdown dive for fullback Jay Hillman.
The point after attempt was good to give the Germans a 7-0 lead.
Claymores came back into the game in the second quarter --
appropriately on the boot of Czyzewski, who converted a 16-yard field
goal.
Both teams traded possession, Claymores' offence finding it difficult
to convert on third down. An interception by Darrell Lewis set up
Claymores at Rhein's 24-yard line just as the Germans looked good for
another touchdown.
Blundin had threatened to link up with one of his two receivers
throughout the half, and with 85 seconds left he at last found Tim
Barnett, who made a superb 19 yards grab to take the ball to the
five-yard line.
Blundin connected with Barnett again on the very next play for the
Scots' first touchdown, the quarterback lobbing the ball nicely into the
corner for the former Kansas City receiver to pull in.
A 36-yard gain by Rhein running back Shaumbe Wright-Fair brought the
Germans to the Claymores' six-yard line at the end of the third quarter.
Hillman battered the ball in on the next play to put the Germans 13-10
ahead.
Claymores got the ball back after a goal-line stand -- linebacker
Ricky Andrews preventing another Rhein score. Claymores then put
together a superb 99-yard, 10-play drive, capped by a 14-yard touchdown
catch from game MVP wide receiver, Tim Barnett.
At 17-13 down with six minutes left, Rhein got out of jail when
Torretta hit Deron Pointer for a 49-yard touchdown and a 19-17 lead.
Claymores then staged a last-gasp fightback, moving down the field
with three great catches from Barnett. However, an incomplete pass on
third down forced head coach Criner to opt for a field goal to try to
put the Claymores ahead. But Czyzewski pulled his kick left.
The result puts Claymores in joint third place, level with London and
Barcelona who also lost at the weekend. London Monarchs failed to repeat
their triumph of 1991, suffering a 45-22 defeat against old rivals
Frankfurt Galaxy.
Monarchs beat Galaxy 24-11 four years ago on their way to winning the
inaugural World League title, but they were swept aside this time in
impressive fashion.
However, head coach Bobby Hammond took some heart from his team's
display, saying: ''It could have been so much worse -- we'll be back.
''I came here with a number of questions that have now been answered.

SCOTLAND'S men put on a confident display against the United States
here yesterday to open their account in the Ford World Curling
Championships.
The 8-4 victory in their second game makes up for the disappointing
loss by 5-4 to Germany in their opener on Saturday evening.
They were much more confident against the USA than in their opening
game. Despite losing a single in the first end when they had the last
stone, the Scots kept their poise. They chose to blank the fourth end
and got the reward with a 2 at the fifth to take the lead for the first
time in the match, by 3-2.
The USA levelled the game with a single at the sixth end, but the
Scottish team moved up a gear in the seventh.
Both front end players, Russell Keiller and Bob Kelly, played
perfectly weighted shots round guards to build up the head, and third
player Peter Loudon followed their example to drop another Scottish
counter into the house.
Skip Gordon Muirhead played two excellent shots to seal the end and
the game. He followed a successful raised take-out of over twenty feet
with a perfectly-judged draw to score four.
The USA could only take a single from the eighth and Scotland
responded with a single at the ninth. Following this, the USA ran out of
stones in the tenth end for a final score to Scotland of 8-4.
Scotland's women got back on the winning trail yesterday afternoon,
with a confident win over Japan by 9-4. Earlier, Kirsty Hay's team had
gone down by 11-6 to Norway, but the win against Japan, along with
Saturday's victory over France in the opening round keeps the Scottish
women in contention for a semi-final place.
The Scots were never troubled against Japan. They set themselves up
with a score of 2 at the first end, and then had single steals at each
of the next two ends.
Japan responded with a 2 at the fourth and Scotland regained control
at the fifth with a single, for a lead of 5-2. Japan's 2 at the sixth
was to be their last score of the game. After that, Scotland scored
singles in the remaining ends to run out comfortable victors. Results:
Men: Round 1 -- Scotland 4, Germany 5; Canada 5, Switzerland 2; Norway
6, Australia 7; USA 5, Sweden 4; England 3, Wales 2.
Round 2 -- England 4, Canada 7; Australia 10, Wales 2; Scotland 8, USA

''GIVE me a call. I am willing to listen to anyone who might have some
advice to offer,'' Dundee United's new manager Billy Kirkwood said at
the end of our meeting. A number of ideas sprang to mind immediately.
However, the urge to offer a few pearls was resisted -- in the
interests of entente, you understand.
The notion to suggest Kirkwood, having had almost a fortnight to look
over the old place, sprint across the road and ask for political asylum
at Dens Park was banished from the mind, as was the idea of saying he
should tell his players to keep the defence tight, especially for the
first dozen seconds or so after kick-off.
These would have been cheap shots at the latest of the young bucks who
have decided to try football management for a living.
The good luck cards still sit around Kirkwood's office, which is
spacious, tidy, and a shade austere with its dark wood furniture. He
fits perfectly into that office, his think tank, at the back of
Tannadice's main stand.
His smile, which can light up even the dullest of rooms, gives the
impression that nothing is too much trouble, that everything in his life
is wonderful. But when that persona fades, sometimes another Kirkwood
threatens to appear.
While it would be wrong to say Kirkwood is a pessimist of the black,
brooding calibre of Jim McLean, he is prone to worry. He has his moments
wrestling with self-doubt, which is why we will never hear the new
Dundee United manager make outrageous, or even optimistic pronouncements
a la Ivan Golac.
The players at Tannadice have gone from one extreme to another, from
McLean's overbearing and rigid ways to the relaxed, low-key methods of
Golac, but in Kirkwood they might just have the correct balance. Order
and discipline are keystones in his philosophy, but he insists United's
football must also accommodate fun and flair.
It is an elusive, magic potion, but where better to pursue it than in
the City of Discovery?
United have been free-falling towards relegation and Kirkwood was
tempted away from a comfortable and rewarding position at Ibrox to
deflect United from what would be their Doomsday Scenario. It is a
burden heavy enough to crush an experienced manager, never mind a
fresh-faced rookie.
Kirkwood had time on his side at Ibrox, where news of his coaching
abilities had been making the game's bushwire thrum, and he didn't have
to accept the responsibility of attempting to rejuvenate United at this
stage.
Even if the chance to return to Tannadice might have passed him by,
there would have been other offers because Kirkwood is the type who can
be relied upon to devote himself totally to the cause. Tannadice again
represents the centre of his universe.
He started his playing career there, and although it ended in Dens
Park -- there were also spells with Hibernian, a second one with United,
and Dunfermline -- he was always regarded as one of McLean's men, but
insists he has gone back as his own man.
When Kirkwood feels the need, he will consult the Tannadice oracle,
but already the 37-year-old has embraced one of the managerial golden
rules: If you fail, then make sure failure is by your own mistakes and
no-one else's.
''I'll bring in my own ideas and I'll make the place better, but I
know this place, and especially the chairman. I don't think there could
be anyone better than him to approach for any assistance,'' he said.
''However, you can't rely on others. You have to do it your own way,
and I will, although no-one can possibly say how it will all turn out.''
Looking at him behind a desk devoid of the usual office paraphernalia,
it is easy to believe that, at the very least, Tannadice will be a
smoothly functioning and efficient place the day he goes. The players
will have their self-belief back and they won't let anyone down.
''I want them to be a credit to themselves and their club and to be
aware of what they are doing at all times, even when they are outside
Tannadice,'' he said. ''Managers, players, directors, and the media
people also are all in privileged positions because they are involved in
football. I want the players to play every game like it could be their
last, because no-one knows what awaits round the corner.''
The part-time pessimist in Kirkwood might have been trying to force
himself to the surface at that point, but another smile eased back into
place. ''I am a perfectionist,'' he said quietly. ''A Virgo, and I like
everything to be in its place, to be in order. That takes discipline,
which is something I want to impress on the young players here. ''All
they have to do is look at Mark Hateley, who has earned money and fame,
yet he retains the discipline to carry on. He also enjoys it, and that
is important.''
It is Kirkwood's intention to have United playing with greater flair,
and fun, he insists, is one of the game's crucial ingredients. ''I'd
like to think my teams will play aggressively and with flair, but always
with a sense of enjoyment.''
Kirkwood, of course, began learning the trade with Walter Smith and
Archie Knox and will be forever appreciative of the grounding they gave
him.
From his four years at Ibrox, Kirkwood remembers the way the
management and players pulled together and he seeks similar co-operation
at Tannadice, where the immediate priority is to avoid relegation. If
premier division survival is secured, Kirkwood will have to consider
bringing in a few new players.
If and when he moves for players, he will select those who can play
and work. Teams like United can't afford a prima donna, because any
success has to be based on mutual respect and a mixture of hard work and
flair.
That is the way it was when United were at their best in the early
'80s through to their UEFA Cup final appearance in 1987, and Kirkwood's
memories of those times enhance his determination to pull the club out
of its current decline. He will start by studying the players he has
inherited.
''A manager has to know his staff and understand them,'' he explained.
''They are human beings like the rest of us, with families and
mortgages, but they really must make the most of the time they have in
the game.''
Kirkwood speaks from personal experience because a pelvic injury
forced him to stop playing when he was 29. By then, however, he had
already gained all of his coaching badges and moving into that side of
the game was a natural progression.
''I was never the most gifted player, but when I started coaching I
found I enjoyed it and I got a reasonably good reaction from the
players,'' he said. ''Even so, I didn't give much thought to becoming a
manager, but here I am back at Tannadice and this club will be given
everything I have. That's the way I am and that is the way I want the
players to be.
''It might sound a bit like 'I want them to live for today', but look
at what happened with Davie Cooper. Also my own father died when he was
only 39, and these things make me believe we have to play and work every
day like it might be our last, and that is probably one of the reasons I
decided to come back to Tannadice at this stage.''
Hopefully the life and vitality which drives Kirkwood will spill over
and influence his players, and United themselves will begin to live
again. With their new manager, who possesses many of the traits of
McLean, but manages to put a smile on them all, there is every chance.
And come to think of it, there is a piece of advice I can give
Kirkwood. Just be yourself. That'll probably do it.

MRS Chrissie Stewart, the only Freewoman of the Western Isles and
widow of Donald J Stewart, Scottish Nationalist MP, died on Saturday in
the Bethesda Hospice in Stornoway, aged 70.
She had been in ill health for some time and was nursed by her sister,
Nan, before moving into the hospice several weeks ago.
Her husband became the first Scottish Nationalist MP for the Western
Isles and became the first to win a seat for the party at a General
Election. He held the seat for 17 years before retiring in 1987, having
successfully fought five General Elections. He was also a Privy
Counsellor and became SNP parliamentary leader in 1974.
He and his wife were very much a team and this was recognised when
they became the first Freemen of the Western Isles in 1988.
On that occasion the then council convener, Sandy Matheson, recalled
that in Parliament Donnie and Chrissie were simply known as the
Stewarts, and were ''a formidable political partnership, renowned for
their inherent generosity and welcoming hospitality''.
Mrs Stewart was also the founding member of the Wife and Family
Division of the House, where members and relatives could socialise.
Mrs Stewart is survived by two brothers, Kenneth in Lewis and Iain in
Inverness, and her sister, Nan, in Stornoway.
The funeral will take place tomorrow from the Free Church Seminary in
Stornoway to Sandwick cemetery.

<HEADLINE>New NHS charges cost Scots #30m</HEADLINE>

PATIENTS in Scotland are having to meet an annual bill of more than
#30m because of the Government's increases in NHS prescription charges,
a Labour MP claimed yesterday.
''Prescription charges have become little more than a form of indirect
taxation aimed at the sick,'' said Mr Brian Donohoe, MP for Cunninghame
South.
Scottish Office information showed that the amount of revenue raised
from charges had increased from #2,744,743 in 1978-79 to #30,514,545 in
1993-94, he said, which amounted to #6 a year for every one in Scotland.
The cost of a prescription had increased by 750% since 1978-79, but
the amount of revenue raised by the Scottish Office had risen by 1100%.
The biggest increases in revenue from prescription charges was in the
Orkney Health Board area, at 2085%; the smallest in the Greater Glasgow
Health Board area, at 700%.
Mr Donohoe said: ''These figures demonstrate just how much people are
now paying in order to obtain a prescription on the NHS.
''The prescription charge was originally introduced to help subsidise
the costs of expensive medicines for patients who could not afford it.
We now have a situation where, last year, more than #30m was raised by
the Treasury as a result of people buying medicines for a flat-rate
charge which in many cases overvalued the medication prescribed.''

<HEADLINE>Sinn Fein rejects Adams plot claim</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SINN Fein yesterday denied all knowledge of an alleged plot by IRA
hardliners to assassinate party president Gerry Adams -- a plot which
was reportedly foiled by MI5.
Mitchel McLaughlin, Sinn Fein's northern chairman, also denied there
were any splits between the party and the IRA.
''These stories are always difficult to source, and I think this may
well turn out to be one of those fanciful stories that generate column
inches,'' he said.
Yesterday's Observer reports that security forces in Ulster claim IRA
members in South Armagh, angry over the ceasefire and the peace process,
had planned to shoot the Sinn Fein leader in January.
It quotes a source with ''high-level security links'' in Belfast and
London as saying that security service contacts in Ulster had stated
that an operation to save Mr Adams had taken place.
The source is quoted saying: ''A faction of IRA people in South Armagh
had been determined to wipe Adams out because they thought he was
leading them nowhere. The thing was uncovered and dealt with.''
Allegedly the would-be killers were tackled as they were on their way
to the murder spot.
In a television interview, Mr McLaughlin challenged Mr Major to end
the ''prevarication'' over talks with Sinn Fein at ministerial level.
''We believe that he is in fact a damaged leader. The question is
whether he recognises the historic opportunity that he has to create
peace in Ireland,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Labour to go 'back to basics' on education</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978960597</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCHOOLS battered by education cuts could not expect the damage to be
undone immediately by an incoming Labour government, the Shadow
Education Secretary, Mr David Blunkett, said yesterday.
He wants the party to commit itself to a decade of recovery and
investment in education.
Mr Blunkett said that, given the depth of cuts inflicted on schools,
it was unlikely that rising class sizes and teacher redundancies could
be reversed immediately.
''Retrospective catching up is going to be almost impossible,'' he
warned delegates at the annual conference of the Secondary Heads
Association at Warwick University.
He hoped to move to a system of three-year rolling budgets to make
school funding more predictable, but repairing school finances would
take time.
''We have to look at how we can recommit ourselves in my view to a
10-year investment programme of planned improvements to give you some
certainty and security, and I need to argue for that,'' he said.
He told journalists later he was confident he would win more money,
against competing claims facing an incoming Labour chancellor.
Mr Blunkett poured scorn on the Government's claim that ''apart from a
little under-funding'', all was well with education.
He suggested the Government was treating people like ''dummies''.
Referring to the smash-hit film Forrest Gump, he said: ''We haven't
yet reached the stage that the United States appears to have reached,
where being a dummy is something you get praised for.''
He felt that American material could lead to the development in
Britain of a ''dumb-dumb society''.
He told head teachers: ''There is a real danger of undermining all
your efforts to motivate children to reject the 'coolness' of being
ignorant.''
Labour wanted schools to help turn Britain into a well educated
''high-wage, high-value economy''.
He spelled out an eight-point ''back to basics'' message in which
children learned the three Rs and teachers kept discipline.
He emphasised good leadership from head teachers and a partnership
between parents, pupils, and teachers, with high expectations of pupils.
Mr Blunkett told the conference that, although an optimist, it would
be wishful thinking to expect he could persuade Labour's treasury team
to promise a spending spree on education.
He later told journalists that Labour had to be ''careful about not
making promises''.
He said: ''One of the things Tony Blair is clear about is that we must
not end up with a Labour government that promises a lot, delivers more
than it can manage in its first year, and then has to start making
cut-backs.
''We will have to be the first government in history that delivers
more than it promises.''

<HEADLINE>Scottish association is forced to face the costly facts as demand falls. Four youth hostels close in cutback</HEADLINE>

FOUR Scottish youth hostels, which among them have served patrons for
almost 190 years, are to close at the end of this year's summer season
as part of a cost-cutting exercise.
The Scottish Youth Hostels' Association has confirmed that its
accommodation at Kingussie on Speyside, Ballater on Deeside, Loch Ard
near Callander, and Garramore near Morar, will close in October.
The association depends to a great extent for funding on membership
subscriptions and hostel charges, although it does occasionally receive
grant aid from the Government-sponsored Scottish Natural Heritage.
Fears have been expressed that falling demand, increased competition
from privately run hostels, and increased financial pressures on the
association, could lead to the closure of several of its other 80
hostels.
However, Mr Jim Martin, SYHA general secretary, said yesterday:
''There is nothing sinister about the closures. We have opened and
closed hostels over the years as demand has changed.''
He argued that necessary upgrading of the association's accommodation
at Ballater and Kingussie, to comply in part with fire regulations,
would cost #70,000 each and could not be justified. Nearby hostels at
Braemar and Aviemore were likely to benefit from the closure of the two
facilities.
Occupancy rates at Garramore and Loch Ard had dropped steadily in
recent years because of their isolated situations, he said, and keeping
them open was uneconomic.
Mr Martin said the capital from the sale of the four properties would
be re-invested in some of the 80 other hostels. Broadford on Skye, which
is being extended, will reopen in June to take advantage of the new Skye
bridge and improvements are planned at Ratagan and Glen Affric.
Other changes are planned to give visitors greater flexibility and to
ward off increasing competition from independent hostels.
More hostels will open during the day and later at night, bedrooms
will be smaller to make them more attractive, and fewer hostels will
insist on duties being performed.
SYHA personnel at Kingussie, Loch Ard, and Ballater, were reluctant to
comment yesterday on the closure proposals.
However, Mrs Halcyone Atkinson, warden for the past 20 years at
Garramore, said there had been a ''certain inevitability'' about the
closure of the Morar facility, given the falling numbers in recent
years.
She said the number of bed nights sold at Garramore, which opened in
1957 and had 80 beds, had dropped to about 4500 from a peak of about
7000.
Mrs Atkinson, 50, who is to take up a warden's post with the SYHA at
Strathpeffer, near Dingwall, added: ''Garramore is almost three miles
from the nearest railway station. It is unfortunate but it appears,
nowadays that youngsters want a station or a bus stop on their doorstep.
Many are also looking for a cafe or a public house. It is a shame that
Garramore is closing because it is a lovely spot.''
Mr Kevin Howett, national officer of the Mountaineering Council of
Scotland, the governing body for climbing and hillwalking north of the
Border, said he was confident that a market still existed in Scotland
for the youth hostel system.
But he warned: ''The SYHA must improve its marketing and let people
know it has changed its image -- from the huge single sex, bunk bed
system to accommodate families and couples -- if it is to survive.''
Mr Howett, citing the successful marketing campaign of the private
youth hostel operation built up in recent years in Ireland, added: ''If
this example was copied, I am sure many more people would use youth
hostels in Scotland and that their future would be much more secure.''

MARK Thatcher used a handwritten note from his mother to further his
business career, it was claimed yesterday.
The note, under an official photograph of the former prime minister,
Baroness Thatcher, was said to have been addressed to Sheikh Zayed, the
ruler of Abu Dhabi and the President of the United Arab Emirates.
It read: ''I have asked my son to convey to you my personal message of
warm regards and good wishes.''
The Mail on Sunday newspaper said that, months after Mr Thatcher, 41,
presented the note, written in November 1980, to the sheikh, he helped
secure a #300m Middle East building contract for Cementation
International.
It was estimated that Mr Thatcher's commission was nearly #3m, the
newspaper said.
Three years later, in 1984, Mrs Thatcher was questioned in the
Commons, in couched terminology, about ''batting for a single firm in
which a member of my own family had a direct financial interest in the
outcome''.
She said in reply: ''It is quite untrue. Your complaint is unjustified
. . . and I hope therefore you will withdraw your untrue allegation.''
The Mail on Sunday, which is serialising a new book on the son of the
former prime minister, reported: ''Whether Mrs Thatcher intended it or
not, the note . . . would have been a considerable asset for Mark in any
future business dealings in the Arab world, where personal status and
influence count for so much.''
Ministers' rules on the way that government business is conducted
state: ''Ministers must so order their affairs that no conflict arises
or appears to arise between their private interest and their public
duties.''
The newspaper also reported that Mr Thatcher was a ''prime mover''
behind a plan to make Lady Thatcher president of the Arab-owned Bank of
Credit and Commerce International, only months before the bank collapsed
in the wake of one of the biggest frauds in history.
The plan, devised in 1990 when Lady Thatcher was still in office, fell
apart when Sheikh Zayed, a co-founder of BCCI, declined to co-operate.
The allegations are contained in a new book, Thatcher's Gold, by Paul
Halloran and Mark Hollingsworth.
Mr Mark Thatcher's business dealings have long been the subject of
speculation.
Journalists and politicians have been intrigued as to how the son of
the former prime minister managed to amass millions despite an
unpromising start to his business career.
He left Harrow public school in 1971, at the age of 18, did not go to
university, and failed his accountancy exams three times.
After a series of jobs, which each lasted about one year, Mr Thatcher
started to do well with consultancy deals, television advertising, and
promoting whisky and sportswear.
He dabbled in the Hong Kong business world and built up a network of
business associates from the motor racing world as well as the Middle
and Far East.
Mr Thatcher was ridiculed by the media for getting lost during a car
rally in the Sahara in 1982. This was followed by the embarrassing
Commons questions about his still-unexplained role in helping the
Cementation company win a contract to build a university in Oman.
He had flown to Oman the day after his mother arrived there for an
official visit ''batting for Britain''.
Mr Thatcher moved to Dallas, Texas, where he promoted Lotus cars and
met Diane Burgdorf, the daughter of a millionaire car dealer. The couple
married and have two children.
Last year his name was mentioned in connection with the Pergau dam
affair, in which British aid to Malaysia was allegedly linked to a
#1300m contract placed by Malaysia in Britain.
* Mr Thatcher was flying into Britain today to see his mother,
according to the Sunday Mirror.

MRS Eileen O'Casey, the widow of Irish playwright Sean O'Casey, who
also became a writer, died in London yesterday. She was 95.
Her death comes more than 30 years after that of her husband -- writer
of Juno and the Paycock, the Silver Tassie, and Shadow of a Gunman.
Since his death Mrs O'Casey, an actress by profession, had written three
books about her life.
She died at a home for retired actors in north-west London, where she
had moved a year ago. Her son Breon and daughter Shivaun were with her.
The young Irish actress Eileen Carey met O'Casey at a West End
audition for his play, The Plough and the Stars. She became an
understudy, but took over a full-time role before the first night when
the actress first chosen became ill.
She married the playwright in 1927 at a Roman Catholic church in
Chelsea when she was still in her 20s and O'Casey was in his mid-40s.
Her beauty was acclaimed alongside descriptions of his wedding attire,
including a lounge suit with ''a mauve tint'', which flouted the strict
conventions of the time.
One headline ran: ''Mr Sean O'Casey's wedding clothes -- Irish
dramatist married in a 'pull-over' -- Pretty actress bride -- Shy
bridegroom at a four-minute ceremony.''
In one of her books Mrs O'Casey admitted that although her outfit was
a more normal two-piece suit, she too was flouting convention: a former
convent girl, she was already pregnant.

THE fitting of watertight compartments to car decks of all roll-on
roll-off ferries is expected to be recommended this week by an official
world shipping panel of experts.
The aim is to prevent any repeat of the Zeebrugge and Estonia
disasters, where hundreds died, although any new regulations would not
come into force until November 1996 at the earliest.
The recommendation for transverse bulkheads is expected to be
announced tomorrow, when details of a report by the International
Maritime Organisation are published.
Last week, Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney said the experts'
report recommended enhancing ''both the damage and intact survivability
of ro-ro ferries'' by requiring them to be able to survive with levels
of water on the car deck. These recommendations pointed to the fitting
of transverse bulkheads.
Dr Mawhinney also said last week that UK tests showed the bulkheads
could improve a vessel's survivability once water had got on the car
deck.
It was this taking on of water that led to the Herald of Free
Enterprise disaster at Zeebrugge, in which more than 190 people died,
and the sinking of the Estonia which claimed more than 900 lives.
The 20-strong panel was set up by the IMO's safety committee after the
Estonia's sinking.
If the committee adopts the report, its members will draw up
appropriate amendments to existing shipping regulations, including the
Safety of Lives at Sea convention.

<TEXT>
GLASGOW was the setting for an important meeting with Sioux tribesmen
yesterday.
Negotiations are set to last several days over a cotton shirt taken
from the body of a dead warrior at the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890.
The shirt has been on display at the Kelvingrove Museum for more than
a hundred years, but the Lakota Sioux say that the shirt is of huge
cultural and emotional significance -- and they want it back.
It was a ghost shirt worn by followers of the Ghost Dance cult, who
believed the shirt and ritual would bring back their native lands and
buffalo, and provide immunity to enemy bullets.
It arrived in Glasgow in 1891 with Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West
travelling show, and was given to the city's museums the following year.
Two years ago, it was loaned to another museum in the city, where it
was spotted by American visitor John Earl, of Cherokee descent, who told
the Wounded Knee Survivors Association of his discovery.
That launched a round of long-distance negotiations, culminating in
yesterday's talks.
Museum official Mark O'Neill said as talks began with their
representatives: ''This is going to be a tough one.''
Mr O'Neill, senior history curator for Glasgow museums, said: ''It is
good now that we are finally meeting them. Trying to deal with this by
letter isn't very satisfactory.
''You have to meet the people and establish an understanding with
them.
''We haven't made up our mind at all. It is a very difficult issue for
us.
''Obviously it could be seen as a precedent that could open up a lot
of our collection to other claims for repatriation.
''So we have to make sure that this is a unique case, or that it is
different from more generalised claims.
''We really need to reach an understanding on what the shirt means to
the Lakota people, and balance that against what it means to us in terms
of its educational value.''
Such cases are covered by US legislation, but this does not apply
abroad, and Mr O'Neill said: ''We will be making a decision on ethical
rather than legal grounds.''
Although some ghost shirts have survived, Glasgow's is the only one in
Britain and the only one reputedly taken from a body at Wounded Knee.
The Battle of Wounded Knee is viewed by Indians as a misnomer for a
massacre of more than 200 men, women and children by 7th Cavalry.

A COUNCIL has been asked to provide housing for released offenders as
part of a rehabilitation programme.
Officials of the Scottish Association for the Care and Rehabilitation
of Offenders -- which helps offenders to adjust when they leave jail --
has applied to Inverness District Council's housing chief, Mr Peter
Loutit, for five single or double bedroom units.
However, the appeal is unlikely to be well received in a town where
there are more than 2000 families on the waiting list for homes.
Yesterday, Councillor Sheila MacKay said: ''This could be an emotive
issue if people coming out of prison were able to jump ahead of others.
''Many couples are forced to lease accommodation until they get a
council house -- and that can take several years. The waiting list is
horrendous.''
She agrees that offenders should be helped back into society, but
doubts if anything can be done to put a roof over their heads.
''There are always going to be special-needs groups,'' she said, ''and
it is against the law to differentiate between one and the other.
''But the money is simply not there to cater for them all. Perhaps
Sacro would be better to seek some kind of package from a special
housing association.''
Inverness District Council's housing committee will consider the
application when it meets tomorrow.
Its convener, Councillor Ally MacLean, said: ''It would not be fair to
make any comment until I discuss the matter with the housing director,
who is away at the moment.
''But the present situation is that single people must wait five or
six years for a house and married couples for three years.''
In the application, Sacro's Michael Perrott says he seeks to
co-ordinate a range of accommodation types to suit ex-prisoners at
various stages in the rehabilitation process.
While they may start in a hostel, the aim is to enable them to ''move
towards a more independent living style as soon as practicable''.
Mr Perrott, based in the Highlands, adds: ''On release, a prisoner
faces the hardest part of his or her punishment.
''Sacro believes that by addressing housing needs, it is possible to
reduce greatly the risk of re-offending and to provide a climate in
which rehabilitation may be complete.
''We hope the council may be able to give sympathetic consideration to
our proposal.''
An Inverness man, who asked not to be named, said: ''Let the
do-gooders look after ordinary folk for a change.
''Nowadays, it seems to go unrecognised if you are good-living and
contribute to the community.
''But if you offend against society by committing criminal acts, there
is plenty of help available.''
The man, who supports a partner and four children, has been waiting to
move out of a two-roomed top flat for almost five years.
He added: ''I can't get a council house big enough for our needs and I
would be furious if anyone was seen to jump the queue -- especially an
offender.''

THE girlfriend of Florida murder victim Gary Colley has received the
all-clear from doctors after a cancer scare.
Miss Margaret Jagger disclosed yesterday that lumps in her breasts had
been caused by the bullet she took from a murderer's gun while
holidaying in America.
Miss Jagger, 37, has endured giving evidence at three trials and must
wait for a second retrial of alleged gunman Billie ''Jo'' Crumitie later
this year.
The civil servant, who still lives in the cottage in Wilsden, near
Bradford, West Yorkshire, that she shared with Mr Colley, says she was
under a great deal of pressure and stress when she last flew to America
for a retrial.
''I discovered lumps and I was in a lot of pain from them,'' she said.
''I had gunshot wounds, but I was still scared the lumps could be
cancer. The doctors have now told me that it is not cancer, and that is
a weight off my mind.
''But I am forever the optimist, and I was not going to worry too much
about something I could do nothing about.''
Doctors put Miss Jagger into hospital after she collapsed days before
she flew out for the second trial in January.
''I was really ill,'' she said. ''It was a stress-related sickness. I
had basically had enough.''
She now admits that it is only the thought of another trial that keeps
her going. She is expecting a call from lawyers in the United States
this week to confirm a fresh trial date, probably in November.

<TEXT>
THE local authority Ombudsman is to investigate decisions to site a
unit for anti-social tenants in a housing scheme.
He will travel to Dundee to take evidence after a complaint of
maladministration against both the district council and Tayside region
by Councillor Ian Borthwick, who represents the area concerned.
It has been reported that problem families would be housed in a unit
with armoured glass windows, six-feet high steel fencing, floodlights
and a curfew. The plan has been strongly opposed by local residents, who
have described the block as ''Colditz''.
In a referendum held at the same time as Thursday's local elections,
each of the 1800 households in the St Mary's estate was given one vote.
On a 50% turnout, 880 votes were cast against the project and only seven
for.
Mr Borthwick, who was re-elected, criticised both Dundee district and
Tayside Regional Council for failing to consult properly his
constituents and for sowing confusion.
He said: ''We have been told numerous different stories about who will
be housed here. First, it was anti-social tenants who had been evicted,
then it was poor folk whose lives had been 'hijacked by poverty'. Next
it was families who were the victims of anti-social behaviour by others.
We have even been told it is for people who are in rent arrears.''
He said the Ombudsman had ''asked for documents, photographs, and
details of the 80 individual planning objections which have been lodged
against the scheme''.
Dundee's housing convener, Mr Fred Welsh, said: ''I have no doubt that
any investigation by the Ombudsman will vindicate the district
council.'' He dismissed the referendum result as ''a load of nonsense''.
* SCOTLAND could teach the rest of the UK many lessons about housing,
the new director of the Shelter homelessness campaign said yesterday.
Mr Chris Holmes, who is visiting Shelter's offices and centres in
Scotland, said: ''The Government is currently proposing changes to the
homelessness legislation, a move which would force homeless families to
rely even more heavily on bed and breakfast accommodation and poor
quality private rented homes.
''The Scottish Office seems to be far less enthusiastic about these
changes than their counterparts in the Department of the Environment in
England.''
He said ''too often in the housing world, the significant
differencesbetween Scotland and England are ignored or forgotten, and
there are many lessons which English organisations can learn from
Scotland''.

<TEXT>
Sarajevo, Sunday,
THE United Nations closed Sarajevo's airport today after Serb forces
who riddled a cargo plane with bullets refused to guarantee the safety
of humanitarian flights, a UN spokesman said.
''The Bosnian Serbs said they cannot guarantee the safety of flights
in and out of Sarajevo so the airport is at state 'red' (closed),'' said
Major Pierre Chavancy.
The move underlined Bosnia's instability ahead of a week in which
diplomats will tour Balkan capitals to push for an extension of the
current battered truce in Bosnia and to offer rump Yugoslavia a
suspension of sanctions.
Envoys from the five-nation Contact Group (Britain, the United States,
Russia, France and Germany) seeking an end to the conflict in Bosnia
will tell Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic that Belgrade could get
relief from a crippling trade embargo if he agrees to recognise Bosnia
and Croatia.
Germany's Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said in a statement that
Belgrade ''must express its readiness for quick mutual recognition'' of
its neighbours' independence and maintain its blockade of military
supplies to the Bosnian Serbs.
Milosevic has said he will not recognise Bosnia and Croatia unless
sanctions are ended permanently.
It was unclear how the Contact Group, which met in London last week,
hoped to persuade him to change his mind. Its proposal appeared to be a
compromise worked out among the oft-divided five to try to further
isolate the Bosnian Serbs after they rejected its peace plan.
The major powers fear a return to all-out war in Bosnia unless the
Serbs and the Muslim-led Bosnian government agrees to extend a
much-violated four-month truce accord due to expire on May 1.
The airport closure forced by the Serbs breaks commitments in the
accord to permit the free passage of humanitarian aid and comes a day
after they raked a US cargo plane with small arms fire, forcing the
suspension of aid flights.
Sarajevo's airport, sited between Bosnian government and separatist
Serb lines west of the city, has been the city's primary link to the
outside world during three years of war.
Fighting has frequently interrupted the humanitarian airlift. It was
suspended for 13 days in March after the Serbs fired at UN and Red Cross
planes.
Three people were killed and seven wounded in mortar attacks on
Sarajevo tonight, prompting the United Nations to request Nato air
presence over the city, UN and hospital officials said.
''We have requested Nato air presence as a result of the continuing
attacks this evening and we have filed a strong protest with the
Serbs,'' said a UN official who asked not to be named.
Nato warplanes could be heard above the city at 10.15pm, about an hour
after the attacks, which began at 8.10pm, ended. Ten detonations were
counted in all and Bosnian police said at least two were from 120mm
mortar bombs.
''We confirm three people dead as a result of the attacks,'' said
Captain Miriam Souchaki, a UN spokeswoman.
Doctors at the city's Kosevo hospital identified two of the dead as
females, one of them a 15-year-old girl.
Among the seven wounded were two policemen who were investigating the
scene of one of the first detonations, all of which occurred in the city
centre.
Bosnian Serbs who surround the city fired at least six 120mm mortar
bombs into Sarajevo last night, wounding one man, the UN said. Another
man was wounded by mortar fire in the city centre this morning.
Serb snipers killed one man and wounded two other persons, including a
14-year-old boy today as well.
''We believe that Sunday's attack came from the Serb side of the line
and originated from the same place as the mortars on Saturday evening,''
a UN official said.
UN officials say both the Bosnian government and separatist Bosnian
Serbs are violating the agreements and moving the country closer to
all-out war.--Reuter.

Lisbon, Sunday
LAVA spewing from an erupting volcano on the Cape Verde islands off
West Africa has seeped into an evacuated village and is moving at a
speed of 10 to 14 metres an hour, Portuguese TSF radio reported today.
A TSF correspondent on Fogo island, 400 miles off the coast of
Senegal, said the lava stream had engulfed a wine cooperative, a water
well and some abandoned houses in the village of Boca Fonte.
''There has been a sudden change in this torrent of rocks . . . It is
now moving at between 10 and 14 metres an hour -- twice as fast as
yesterday,'' journalist Joao Almeida reported from the scene today.
''Contrary to expectations, the intensity of the eruption has not
diminished over the last three days. If anything it is now more
explosive,'' he added.
About 450 residents from the villages of Portela and Bangaeira which
are also threatened by the lava stream were evacuated from their homes
yesterday, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
No lives were believed to be in immediate danger as most people fled
their homes near the volcano after it started churning out lava and
toxic gases last Monday. Six people were slightly hurt earlier in the
week during their escape.
Some 5000 homeless people were taking refuge in churches, tents and
other makeshift accommodation. --Reuter.

ICELAND'S centre-right government managed a wafer-thin majority in

When all votes were counted, Prime Minister David Oddsson's

1991 election, and its Social Democrat coalition partners seven seats,
losing three.
The opposition centrist Progressive Party won 15 seats, up from 13,
the Socialists an unchanged nine, a new breakaway social democratic
grouping called the People's Movement four, and the Women's Party three,
losing two seats.
Icelandic political parties are pragmatic and elections are usually
followed by lengthy government-formation talks.
With the support of a government-leaning independent candidate,
Oddsson, 47, retained a majority in the Althing, founded by Viking
settlers in 930 AD.
Oddsson is a former playwright.--Reuter.

BAGHDAD: Iraq today demanded that Turkey withdraw all of its troops
from northern Iraq and said a partial pullout last week was just a
routine rotation. Turkey sent about 35,000 troops into northern Iraq on
March 20 in an operation against separatist Turkish Kurds who maintain
bases there.
In the latest clashes in northern Iraq, Turkish soldiers fought with
Turkish Kurdish rebels yesterday, reportedly killing all 30 of them in
one of the largest confrontations in the operation to date. Turkey said
four soldiers also died in the fighting.

Rome, Sunday
EDDA Mussolini Ciano, 85, the tragic daughter of Italy's wartime
Fascist dictator whose husband was executed by her father's regime, has
died, doctors said today.
Ciano had been ill for some time. She died last night of cardiac
arrest related to lung and kidney failure in a Rome hospital.
The oldest and favourite of Benito Mussolini's five children, she was
an independent-minded woman when females in Italy had few rights. She
was one of the first Italian women to wear trousers and drive a car.
But she is best remembered for an episode in which her father refused
to stop the execution of her husband, Galeazzo Ciano.
Galeazzo Ciano, a playboy count, held various top cabinet posts under
Mussolini in the 1930s and in the early years of the Second World War.
In July 1943, he voted against Mussolini at a cabinet meeting that led
to the dictator's arrest and the fall of Fascism.
Under orders from Adolf Hitler, occupying German troops freed
Mussolini and installed him as head of a puppet regime known as the
Social Republic of Salo, based in northern Italy.
The new regime found Galeazzo Ciano guilty of treason and ordered him
executed. Mussolini turned a deaf ear to his daughter's emotional pleas
for a pardon and Ciano was shot by a firing squad in 1944.
Edda Ciano had helped smuggle her husband's diaries and documents on
Italo-German relations to Switzerland in the vain hope of swopping them
with the Germans for her husband's life.
Her direct appeal to Hitler, whom she admired from an early age, also
failed.
After the execution, Edda, a determined Fascist who was one of her
father's closest advisers in the 1930s, disavowed him and the family
name.
''You are no longer my father for me. I renounce the name Mussolini,''
she wrote to him.
Benito Mussolini was himself killed by a partisan firing squad in
April 1945 in the final days of the Second World War.
After the war Edda settled quitetly in Rome.
She broke her public silence on wartime events in a 1975 book, My
Testimony, and several years before her death she attended a public mass
in memory of her dictator father.
She is said never to have reached a reconciliation with her mother
Rachele, Mussolini's widow, who died 15 years ago. Her mother blamed
Edda's husband for being responsible for the Mussolini's fall.
Edda Mussolini Ciano was born in 1910 the Mussolini family's home
province of Forli in central Italy. She married Galeazzo Ciano in 1930.
They had three children.--Reuter.

Vienna, Sunday
AUSTRIA'S Roman Catholic Church leader Johann Weber said today
allegations of sexual abuse against his predecessor threatened its
credibility and vowed there would be no cover-up in investigating them.
Bishop Weber, who replaced Cardinal Hermann Groer as head of Austria's
Bishops' Conference last week, said the church's position had become
tenuous because of allegations that Groer, Archbishop of Vienna, had
sexually abused a 17-year-old male pupil 20 years ago.
Groer, after refusing to comment for nearly two weeks, denied the
allegations on Friday, without elaborating.
He led Palm Sunday services at Vienna's St Stephan's Cathedral today
without making any reference to the accusations that have dominated
newspaper headlines in Austria for the last two weeks.
Weber said that although he had no authority under church law to call
a panel of inquiry, he would nevertheless consult those involved and
experts.
''The situation has become very difficult and we need to clear this up
as thoroughly as possible,'' Weber said in a television interview.
Josef Hartmann, a former pupil at a Roman Catholic school for boys,
told the news magazine Profil last month that Groer sexually abused him
20 years ago. Groer, 75, was then a teacher at the school at Hollabrunn,
near Vienna.
''The question arises whether there has been a loss of confidence in
the church,'' said Weber, bishop of Graz-Seckau. ''I am not a miracle
worker, but I am determined to do what I can.
''This has already gone on for too long. We want to find a resolution
and not a hushed-up solution. I insist that we do not cover up or try to
blur the matter.''
Weber said the Bishops' Conference was not empowered to launch an
official investigation into the allegations, adding that only the Pope
had that authority. He said he was unaware of any such request from the
Vatican.
''But there has been such a massive amount of questions and concerns
voiced that the Bishops' Conference is indeed affected,'' Weber said.
Weber, saying he did not know if Groer would resign, added that the
cardinal had decided to remain silent on the allegations for his own
reasons, which were respected.
Outside St Stephan's Cathedral today, supporters of Groer handed out a
special edition of the church weekly Die Neue Bildpost criticising the
media's ''defamatory campaign'' against the cardinal.
The paper said Profil published the story because it was losing a
circulation battle against a rival publication, News.--Reuter.

Buchenwald, Sunday
ISRAEL'S chief rabbi recalled today his experiences as a
seven-year-old prisoner in Buchenwald in a moving speech marking the
50th anniversary of the Nazi death camp's liberation.
Speaking to more than 1000 former prisoners in the German National
Theatre in Weimar, Yisrael Lau described how an American rabbi, a
chaplain with US forces, had taken him in his arms after the camp was
freed on April 11, 1945.
''He came in and met a child of less than eight years old -- that was
me -- taking him in his arms, weeping and trying to smile and to laugh.
''Holding me in his arms he asked me: 'How old are you my child?' And
I said, What does it matter. I'm older than you.
'''Why do you think you are older?' he asked me. I said, because you
cry and you laugh like a child. I don't cry and I haven't laughed for a
long time. Tell me who is older, me or you?''
With many of his audience weeping silently, Lau added: ''After 50
years we are permitted to cry.''
Lau's address was one of several by former prisoners, including
Spanish novelist Jorge Semprun and French journalist Pierre Durand,
former editor of the communist newspaper L'Humanite.
Later at a ceremony at the camp itself, former US Army General Thomas
Crawford said he had been overcome with grief and sorrow at what he
found in Buchenwald.
''Buchenwald was an evil, sadistic place,'' said Crawford, who as an
officer in the Sixth Armoured Division of the US Third Army was in
charge of US occupation forces in the area.
A German communist survivor, Emil Carlebach, launched a bitter attack
on former West Germany, which he said had allowed former Nazis to rise
to prominence in business and politics.
Many companies and individuals had grown rich on the slave labour of
concentration camp prisoners, he said to loud cheers from a group of
communists in the crowd.
''They are still respectable businessmen. They no longer raise their
hands in the Hitler salute but rather to cash in their blood-stained
dividends.''
Pierre Sudrau, a French resistance fighter who became a minister in
Charles de Gaulle's government after the war, said all Germans had known
about the camps' existence, but Germans had also been the first victims
of the Nazis.
At least 51,000 people died at Buchenwald, built on a bleak hillside
outside Weimar in 1937. Around 11,000 were Jews and 5000 were gypsies.
There were no gas chambers but thousands were worked to death as slave
labourers or became victims of medical experiments.--Reuter.

Madrid, Sunday
THE Spanish holiday island of Majorca today will receive its first
water of the year -- by ship.
Not one drop of rain has fallen this year in the popular resort which
this Easter will see hotels and apartments more than 90% full of
tourists, tens of thousands of them from Britain.
The tanker Mostoles, carrying 50,000 cubic metres of water from
Taragona on Spain's east coast, is part of a project to ship a total of
seven million cubic metres at a cost of #10m to the parched island this
year.
An official at the 88-room Hotel Sol Jaime said today: ''This tanker
service should prevent any cuts.
''We haven't had a drop of rain this year and the drought means that
the quality of the water will not be up to standard, but the authorities
now believe that people will be able to shower and bath normally.
''The situation is very severe and we need at least three weeks of
solid rain to get back to normal. But there isn't a cloud in the sky and
little chance of the weather changing.''
Spain is in its fourth year of drought conditions with almost half of
the country south of Madrid planning or enforcing water restrictions.
For the past week temperatures have reached the eighties and ten large
regions are affected by drought.
The worst hit is the Costa del Sol where such resorts as Estepona have
water cuts of 19 hours a day.
All resorts along the costa plan or have restrictions, but tourist
chiefs say that hotels and holiday apartments are topping-up supply
tanks when the water is running and clients are hardly aware of the
problem.
The fear is that if the drought continues hotels might be forced by
the summer to close swimming pools and stop watering some of the
country's 160 golf courses.

NINE pleasure boats were cut adrift from their moorings at St Andrews
at the weekend, causing a sea rescue alert.
As Fife Police carried out an investigation, harbourmaster Sid
Stevenson criticised the vandals who set the vessels free.
He said: ''The main cause is under-age drinking and we find beer cans
and empty wine bottles every day, particularly at the weekend.''
The alarm was raised by a couple whose home overlooks the harbour. By
the time Mr Stevenson arrived, three of the boats had drifted almost one
mile out to sea.
Two local fishermen assisted the harbourmaster in securing some of the
craft before the arrival of the coastguard rescue boat, which managed to
tow the remainder safely back into the harbour.
The pleasure boats involved in the early morning incident ranged
between 15 and 18ft. They were undamaged.
Mr Stevenson said increased vandalism in the harbour area had seen the
regular theft of lifebelts and seating and litter bins thrown into the
water.
He said fishermen and boat owners would be pressing for extra police
patrols.

THE campaign to save the threatened London-Fort William sleeper rail
service yesterday received backing from the Ramblers' Association.
Delegates to the association's annual conference in Coventry called on
the Government to instruct British Rail to keep the service operational
until public consultation over its future can take place.
British Rail plans to reduce Scotland's sleeper and motorail services
at the end of next month.
The association, which has 104,000 members throughout Britain, is to
write to the Transport Secretary, Dr Brian Mawhinney, and the rail
regulator to point out:
* The value of the London-Fort William service for walking excursions
from stations between Glasgow and Fort William.
* The increasing demand for the sleeper service, despite failure by
British Rail to market it effectively.
* The success of ScotRail in marketing services on the West Highland
Line last year, trebling revenue.
* The success of previous Ramblers' Association campaigns in
safeguarding threatened rail services, such as the Settle-Carlisle line.
Meanwhile, the Ramblers' Association has also stepped up its fight to
force the Queen to allow a public right of way by the River Thames on
land at Windsor Castle.
The association unanimously passed a motion calling on the Queen to
allow the path to become part of the Thames Path National Trail, due to
be opened next year.
Anti-Criminal Justice Act protesters carried out a mass trespass on
the stretch of towpath last month to highlight the case.
A letter signed by 200 association delegates urged the Queen to mark
the association's 60th anniversary by opening up the path.
Assistant director David Beskin said the path had been a public right
of way until an Act of Parliament in 1860 handed it over to Queen
Victoria as part of Windsor Home Park.
The Crown Estate Commissioners, pleading security considerations, have
refused to allow walkers on the land and offered to set up an
alternative route on the opposite bank.
Mr Beskin said the association ''totally rejected'' the security
argument.
He added that the alternative was unsuitable as it meant walking along
roads.
Earlier Janet Street-Porter, broadcaster and association president,
said freedom to roam the countryside should be treated as a fundamental
human right.
She told the delegates: ''Freedom of movement over much wild land is
barred by intimidating notices saying 'Trespassers will be prosecuted',
'Keep out', and 'Private, no entry'.
''Such notices are an insult to the people of a supposedly free and
civilised country. Scrap the lot of them.''
The association hopes to persuade all political parties to include
''freedom to roam'' policies in their manifestos for the next General
Election.
The conference also elected a new chairperson -- Kate Ashbrook, who
becomes the association's first woman chair and, at 40, its youngest.
The association has been without a chair since the end of last month
when Alan Howard resigned over a proposed sponsorship deal with a car
company.
The deal fell through but Mr Howard felt it was inappropriate for the
organisation, which has been involved in the public transport lobby and
campaigned against road building, even to consider taking car makers'
money.
* Sculptor George Wyllie is to build a full-size model locomotive,
made mainly from timber, on a site on the shore of Loch Linnhe at Fort
William this week as part of a protest against the threatened closure of
the railway line.

MORE than a dozen tenants hastily packed their belongings into cars
and vans yesterday to beat an eviction deadline set by Glasgow District
Council.
They had been given until 10am today to move out of two blocks of
flats in West Princes Street after the council's building control
department ruled that the flats were dangerous.
As they left to stay with friends or in emergency accommodation, many
said they were furious that they had not been given sufficient warning
of the move, nor had they had deposits of around #330-a-flat returned.
However, landlord Matin Khan said he was also a victim and had been
informed of the eviction move only on Wednesday, the same day as the
tenants.
He promised deposits would be returned to all those due them.
Mr Khan said he was caught in the middle of a row between the
council's building control and planning departments and had been given
permission to move tenants into the building, near St George's Cross.
Mr David McPherson, head of operations in the council's building
control department, denied this and said the council had had no option
but to order the tenants out.
''The owner of this building has started to put people in while he is
still in the process of converting the flats. This is contrary to
regulations and contrary to the law,'' he said.
''We consider that these people are at a serious risk. If a fire
breaks out there is no proper protection to the means of escape. The
danger is increased because it is still a building site.''
Mr McPherson said he was not sure when the landlord would have been
informed. ''I know our operational people have been involved with this
for some time. It wouldn't just have come as a bolt from the blue, I'm
sure.''
A number of tenants said they would be applying to the district
council's homeless unit for help. Others were planning to stay with
friends, family or in emergency student accomodation.
Student Vickie Robertson, 23, and a flatmate moved in to 49 West
Princes Street six weeks ago yesterday. They had been given a short-term
let by Glasgow Caledonian University.
Miss Robertson said: ''I telephoned the Citizens' Advice Bureau and
they said it was a very serious situation and we should get out
immediately.''
A neighbour, Miss Maureen Nicol, 24, said they had been told by the
district council that letters had been posted out to them months ago
warning of the situation.
''Nobody in the building got these letters,'' she said.

IT WAS with equal measures of incredulity and mirth that I read the
hypocritical intellectual gymnastics exposed by Scotland's answer to a
time-warped Dickensian Dandy, namely Donald Findlay, as he attempted to
argue his club's position vis a vis the ''three foreigner'' rule.
Before he and Rangers FC attempt to open the Scottish football market
to every mediocre mercenary with a pair of boots, thus setting back our
domestic development another unbearable 30 years, may I humbly suggest
that Mr Findlay and his fellow football directors of RFC look closely at
how efficiently they are employing and promoting the available Scottish
young football talent. I refer particularly to their unofficial but
implemented policy of not signing Catholics.
Before a howl of indignation shakes the cloisters, no-one should be
fooled by the recruitment of one Maurice Johnston. Moreover, the
outpouring of almost cult-like apoplexy over Basile Boli blessing
himself in the tunnel at Ibrox, only goes to reassure everyone that
bigotry is alive and well at Rangers FC.
Mr Findlay asserts in his article that supporters want to see the best
players irrespective of nationality, which he rightly equates to being
as irrelevant in football terms as skin colour. It's a pity that his
(and his club's) pragmatism and largesse doesn't extend to religious
preference.
Come to think of it, maybe Rangers FC should carry on as before. Since
their policies preclude them from acquiring the services of in excess of
20% of the available young talent in Scotland, this leaves lots of
gifted young men for other clubs.
J B Clements, (Doctor of Medicine), 35 Beaumont Drive, Carrongrove,
Falkirk,
Ready and, willing,
I READ with great interest the article by Donald Findlay QC (April 4).
I have discussed this very point with Mr Findlay in the past of a club
or a number of clubs taking the bull by the horns or, as he has
indicated, ''to stick their head above the parapet'' and challenge this
nonsensical UEFA rule.
Interestingly, now that it has been apparently agreed that any action
can be brought by a shareholder, season ticket-holder etc, I am
delighted to say that I would hold myself available in the capacity of
shareholder and season ticket-holder should Rangers wish to pursue this
matter. So far as I am concerned, the sooner the better.

Avoiding the, easy option,
IT was good to see your reporter Jack McLean covering the Puma street
soccer tournament. Post-David Cooper and all the tabloid coverage that
was given to encouraging skills and youth training, no other paper
covered this event which turned out to be a very entertaining day full
of promise and some hope for the future.
The coverage of the event was true, and while Mr McLean could easily
have glossed over the swearing by one adult and his team he didn't take

performing this feat over the reconstructed Gourock course, I referred
to a 1979 edition of the ''old red'' Golfers' Handbook to find on page
371 some 15 instances of successive holes in one. The first recorded in
Vancouver in 1911; the first in Britain in 1964; the first in Scotland
when playing in the Gourock Golf Club's June Medal in 1968 Charles
Fairlie holed in one at both the fifteenth and sixteenth holes -- there
is no note of how he fared in this event.

POLICE were yesterday hunting a man who slashed a 66-year-old woman in
her Greenock home on Saturday night.
The woman, who has not been named, was in the living-room of her home
in Fox Street, when she was attacked around 8.45pm.
Police said that, after discovering a man in the hallway, the woman
was forced back into her living-room where she was repeatedly slashed
about her upper body and face.
The man then ran from the house and the alarm was raised by the woman,
who managed to contact a neighbour. She was taken to Inverclyde Royal
Hospital where her condition was yesterday described as serious but
stable.
Detective Sergeant Dougie McCracken said: ''This was a vicious attack
on a defenceless woman.''
He appealed for anyone who was in the area between 8.30pm and 9pm on
Saturday to come forward.
The attacker is described as white, in his mid-20s, 5ft 10in, of very
slim build, with sharp features, and mousy brown hair. He had an earring
in his left ear.

THERE is something wonderfully mysterious about bowling clubs. A game,
ancient in origin, came to be a wee mystery, especially in Scotland. For
it was we in Scotland who kept the game alive, and with some difficulty
at that.
Bowling goes back a long way: indeed, there is the incidence of
Ancient Egypt where a little child was found buried with a set of bowls,
and the date given for the little boy's death was placed at around 5200
BC, and one suspects he was only throwing the jack at his club's
opening.
They do that sort of thing at club openings. I should know: I have
been at three of them over this weekend. For this weekend saw lots of
the traditional openings, and bowling is very traditional indeed.
Put Scotland first in that tradition. Despite the antiquity of this
game -- apart from Ancient Egypt, we have evidence that ''Boccie'',
still played in Italy to this day, started more than 2000 years ago --
it was for many centuries banned in the British Islands. In 1388 King
Richard 11 prohibited it.
''The game of bowles,'' he wrote, ''is an evil because the alleys are
in conjunction with saloons, and other dissolute places.'' In 1511, King
Henry V111 made bowling a capital offence because it stopped his chaps
practising their archery.
A fellow who manages to be somewhat intimate with half of the female
population and beheads a goodly number of the younger ones, seems to me
to have got his priorities a bit the wrong way round. It did not stop
Sir Francis Drake playing Sir John Hawkins just before the Spanish were
thinking of invading the Kingdom of England.
The fact remains that England had bowling banned until 1845, when the
ban was rescinded. But by then Scotland had taken over the sport.
In 1849, Scotland, which had never given up the bools, set up the laws
of the game that have hardly changed since, and by the time the Scottish
Bowling Association had come into being in 1892, the Scots had
penetrated every colony of Empire.
The Scots are even yet the truly ruling body of world bowling. And it
remains a quintessentially Scottish game, ideal for the sort of aged
ruminants who infest the Scottish bowling clubs. The mysterious little
greens.
And they are mysterious places. Set away from roads and streets, often
shrouded in near-tropical forests, usually of a species of architecture
that suggests Toledo palaces, most built in the 1900s to the 1920s,
bastions of maleness -- to this day, Scottish bowling clubs rarely
permit ladies or girls to play on normal nights or at weekends -- little
secret places, little secret gardens, secret, secret, secret. I rather
like that myself.
The openings were at the weekend in Glasgow. Well, quite a few of the
clubs at any rate. My own club, Queen's Park, one of the oldest and most
august in the world, is set in a lovely but very clandestine portion of
the south side of Glasgow.
Friday night it is, and not a bowl is bowled. This is for wall-to-wall
blazer. And such blazers? The medals and badges on them would do credit
to a Libyan general. Most of the men -- they are all men -- are a touch
elderly; well, I am myself.
Last year, Queen's Park saw 17 members shuffle off the mortal; bowling
clubs are very mortal at that. The microphone doesn't work very well,
and president Willie McLean makes me do a speech. I am suitably risque.
There are no bowls the next day because the groundsman, Alan Bentley,
says the grass is in no condition. One of the best groundsmen in the
business, he tells the truth and knows what he is talking about. There
are 763 clubs in Scotland and Alan knows them all. He knows what he is
talking about. That was Friday night.
The next day I stir myself up to the club and there are all these
Hearts fans in the place because bowlers recognise each other: there is
a kind of freemasonry about bowlers. I could walk into a lawn bowling
club in Chicago or Calcutta and still get a drink and a welcome.
The Jam Tarts boys are here with their wives and sweethearts and wee
weans. They are from Loanhead, and their just-elected councillor Sandy
Harkness (Labour, increased majority), says he is having a good time.
''I dinnae like fitba, but ah chose the club so as we can get juice
for the wee yins.'' Aye, juice for yersel' Sandy, if you ask me.
Later, I am in the Wellcroft club, just down the road. Also mystery.
It has a tree at the front of it that would have you imaging that
Salvador Dali sowed the thing in 1920.
It also has George Smith, a PE teacher I remember being young and fit.
Isn't it grand to see others growing old as well as yourself?
His wee girl is called Jennifer. She says I don't look like a teacher.
I never heard a better quote. I asked her what a teacher looked like.
''Worried,'' she said, ''You look happy.'' Out of the mouths of babes .
. .
And then it was off to one of the nicest little clubhouses in the
universe, Busby.
As it happens, Busby, a douce little outskirt of Glasgow, was actually
playing on Saturday -- usually openings are purely ceremonial. But the
sun is out and the green sward is resplendent in blazers and flannels
and white panamas, and the bar is flushed with drink and fivers.
President Ian Ross is host to all sorts of odds and sods from
elsewhere in Glasgow and even me and his wife, who is called Marilyn and
very pretty, tossed the ceremonial jack.
A lot of ceremony in the bowling. A lot of the ceremony is, of course,
daft, from blazers to medals to the simple fact that the very
nice-looking ladies at Busby have to put up with the circumstance that
they cannot play when they want; that women are indeed discriminated
against in the simple and pleasant pastime. Another mystery.
Here's another. What happened to all those municipal greens? The
little dark secret gardens are still there, but they are shrouded in
privatisation. What did the old Glasgow Corpy do to the greens they once
owned? Answer me that. Mystery.

GRANTS OF nearly #3m are to be given to help repair Scotland's
historic buildings, it was announced yesterday.
Twenty-three buildings throughout the country are to share in the
Scottish Office hand-out.
Among the places to benefit is Abbotsford House, near Melrose, the
category A-listed home of the novelist Sir Walter Scott. Around #98,000
is to be given towards stone repairs on a wing of the famous house.
The Central Library on George IV Bridge in Edinburgh gets a #332,000
repair grant and Tarbat Old Parish Church, near Portmahomack in
Ross-shire, gets #115,400 to help turn it into a museum and centre on
Pictish and early Christian culture.
The Laigh Milton Viaduct near Kilmarnock, the world's oldest surviving
railway viaduct, receives #277,300 towards a scheme of repairs to be
undertaken by a conservation trust.
In announcing the grants, Sir Hector Monro, Scottish Environment
Minister, said: ''Historic buildings are important links with Scotland's
past. They should be properly repaired and maintained for the benefit of
present and future generations.''
The historic buildings repair grants scheme is administered by
Historic Scotland, which allocated #11.8m this financial year.
Other projects to be given cash from its budget include St Magnus's
Cathedral in Kirkwall which gets #17,200; Hyndland Parish Church in
Glasgow (#125,100); St John's Episcopal Church, New Pitsligo, in Banff
and Buchan (#26,000); and Traquair House, Innerleithen, which gets
#40,500.

<HEADLINE>Official gives 'secret' Lingerbay report to Redland</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978960645</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A REPORT on the planned Lingerbay superquarry, which councillors are
not allowed to see, has been sent by council officials to the would-be
developers, Redland Aggregates.
Amid claims that councillors were being misled, the council's director
of administration, Mr Robert Barnett, defended the move as necessary to
get environmental safeguards for Harris.
However Mr Barnett still has no intention of showing the report,
commissioned by the islands authority for #44,000, to councillors.
The report, by consultants Aspinwall, is understood to highlight many
criticisms of council planners' approach to the effect that quarry dust
would have on the local environment.
Councillors who have tried to get sight of the report were told at a
development services committee meeting that it was ''exclusively'' for
the use of the council's legal team.
But Mr Barnett confirmed he was ''responsible'' for giving Redland the
report, although he could not say when it was given to the company.
Yesterday the leader of the council's five-man Labour group said the
latest revelation meant there was ''obviously a lack of faith'' between
members and officials.
The planning committee chairman, Councillor Norman L Macdonald, also
was unaware that the Aspinwall report had gone to Redland.
He said: ''I was completely amazed and vexed when I heard about this.
It brings into question the impartiality of this council in dealing with
this application.
''The chief executive will have a letter on his desk from me in the
morning with a list of questions.''
If the Lingerbay superquarry goes ahead, the resulting hole, made by
shipping away 10 million tons of anorthosite for European motorways each
year for 60 years, would be visible from the moon.
Councillors, particularly those in the Labour group, are angry they
are not allowed to see the report, while it has been given to a private
company.
The Labour group leader, Councillor Callum Iain Macmillan, said: ''We
are talking here about a serious misuse of public funds.
''We will want to know why we were told at a meeting of the
development services committee that we could not see this report because
it was exclusively for the use of the council's own legal officers.
''We will want to know if the officer who told us that was fully aware
that a copy had gone to Redland.''
Mr Macmillan added: ''Who is running this council, the members or the
officers?
''It is a disgrace . . . It is nothing short of a scandal. We will be
calling for an independent investigation by the Local Government
Ombudsman over maladministration. We are also taking legal advice over
getting the report released.''
Despite a unanimous vote of approval for the superquarry planning
application in 1993 by the previous council, 12 from the 29 current
councillors have now openly come out against it.
Mr Barnett said yesterday he was able to justify withholding the
Aspinwall report from the councillors.
He could only release it to individual members who could prove a
''need to know''. But Mr Barnett admitted he did not think councillors
could prove that. That was because all ''relevant quarry planning
decisions'' had already been taken, he maintained.
Yesterday he said: ''I was responsible for giving the Aspinwall report
to the solicitors for Redland.
''I am satisfied that it was right to do so to further a minuted
decision of this council which goes back to 1993.''
He continued: ''The report was given to Redland simply to ensure that,
in the event of permission being finally granted for the superquarry, we
will get the best possible set of environmental safeguards for the
community.''
Western Isles MP Calum Macdonald said it was a ''scandal'' that the
report had been sent to Redland.
''This is the worst case of local government secrecy I have ever come
across,'' he said.
''If the lawyers or Redland want to commission their own paper they
should pay for it.''

LOTHIAN Regional Council leader Keith Geddes yesterday won the contest
to be the political head of the new Edinburgh unitary authority.
He beat off a challenge from Edinburgh District Council leader Lesley
Hinds, who has been proposed as deputy leader of the new council.
The new convener, as widely expected, is regional council convener
Eric Milligan. After a year in the job, Councillor Milligan will be
appointed lord provost.
The appointments were announced after a meeting of senior labour party
members in Lothian Regional Council's HQ in Edinburgh yesterday. Their
recommendations will be rubber-stamped when the ruling Labour group on
the new City of Edinburgh Council meets tomorrow.
Councillor Geddes won the vote over Councillor Hinds by 21 votes to
nine. Councillor Ian Perry was unopposed as the new Labour group
chairman.
The position of Labour group secretary was won by Sheila Kennedy over
Sheila Dalgety by 21 votes to eight with one abstention.
The Labour Party had an overall majority of 10 seats at last
Thursday's elections.
One council source said: ''The Labour people were conscious of giving
a balance of key positions in the new authority to people from the
region and the district.
''At the end of the day, they have come up with posts for six sitting
regional councillors and five district councillors. The other senior
post is going to a new councillor.''
Mr George McGregor, chairman of Edinburgh City Labour Party, said: ''I
am confident the party and the group will unite behind the new
leadership team.
''Last Thursday, the Labour Party achieved its best local election
results ever in Edinburgh. This gives us a clear mandate to implement
the promises within our manifesto and deliver the quality public
services the people of the city deserve.''
Councillor Milligan said: ''As well as deciding who did what on the
new council, we were meeting to celebrate the historic election victory.
Make no mistake about this, it was a fantastic result for us.''
He went on to say that the cash given by the Government to run the new
authority was not enough.
''With the new unitary authority we have been given a budget of #2.2m
and we will have to try and reconcile people's sense of expectations of
the new administration with these budget constraints,'' said Councillor
Milligan.
Despite his own victory, he said the gloss had been taken off
yesterday's meeting by the loss of long-standing Labour Councillor Paul
Nolan.
''Paul was an experienced, hard-working councillor who had a lot to
offer the new unitary authority. Whenever the first chance comes along,
I would like to see him back in the fold.''

Bond Helicopters has become the first commercial aviation company to
have one of its machines operate from a Royal Navy aircraft carrier.
The Eurocopter Dauphin, which normally transports oilmen, spent two
weeks carrying out support operations on board HMS Illustrious.
The carrier was involved in training exercises in preparation for
being deployed in support of UN operations off the coast of the former
Yugoslavia.
The Dauphin, which joined the carrier at Wick and left off Cornwall,
was used to transfer stores and personnel from ship to shore and to
other taskforce units, allowing the Sea King helicopters from
Illustrious to carry out tactical training.
Mr Bob Denning, chief training captain at Bond Helicopters and a
former Navy pilot, who was in charge of the team, said: ''Civil aircraft
are becoming more involved in the support of military operations and we
are confident that Bond has a major role to play.''

IT was a joy for the Diary to make a first visit to the Melrose sevens
at the weekend in the company of chums from the world's favourite
airline. Not only were we treated to a sparkling spring day and some
thrilling action, but we were privileged to watch some legends on the St
Mary's School pitch next to the Greenyards.
The names trip easily off the typewriter -- Deans, Jeffrey, Calder,
Robertson, Aitken, Morgan, Renwick, Beattie. Yes, our own John B was
there, looking in fine trim, although we can't help thinking big Jill
from Haddington could treat him to a new pair of shorts for the autumn
of his career.
These legends were in action for the famous preparatory school's
centenary, and played an attractive form of 10-a-sides with lots of
little breathers. The score doesn't matter; it was just a treat to see a
sidestep again and players trying to beat their opponents. Joy of joys,
and it should have been compulsory watching for every budding player.
* THE people who run Sport For All in our local councils are not as
short in the humour department as some of us may have suspected.
Consider the nickname given to the man who welcomes golfers to a leading
local authority links in the west of Scotland and is not always as
chummy as he could be. He is known as the Customer Prevention Officer.
* A FINAL postscript to the Grand Slam that wasn't to be at Twickenham
last month. The Diary was privileged (we think) to watch the drama
unfold on television within the hallowed portals of the Cheltenham
Bowling Club.
Surrounded in this, the home of the legendary Tony Allcock, by dozens
of baying English people wearing red roses and huge smiles, us Scots
sought refuge at the bar in strong drink and perhaps a little sympathy.
Not a chance. Instead, the response from Gwynn, the finest steward in
the south-west, was: ''How the bloody hell do you think I feel? The
Welsh game is about to come on.''
* WE feel there must have been a breakdown in communication between
the girl in the Celtic shop and the Diary's good friend from Bermuda.
For reasons best known to himself, he wanted to buy a football shirt
sporting the green and white of the Parkhead team. He asked for a
certain style and was told stocks were low.
On inquiring if he could have the one that was part of the window
display, he was told: ''It's only a medium, it's a' faded, and we'll
probably not be getting any more in because there's not much demand for
them.''
* WITH the boys in blue heading for rugby's World Cup in South Africa,
the Diary, naturally, adds its support and will be cheering them on
regularly (other duties permitting) in front of the telly.
We wish a particularly fond farewell to that shrinking violet of
Stirling County, Glasgow, and Scotland, Kenny Logan. We also hope the
fleet-footed farmer fares better in the fines department than he did on
a previous Scotland tour.
His colleagues, unable to cope with the interminable and unwaveringly
good humoured chat from Logan, imposed a 36-hour silence on the bold
boy. During the longest day and a half of his young life, he was allowed
to speak only on the training ground, and the rest of the time
communicated by way of a slate and chalk round his neck.
Reports that he ran out of chalk half a dozen times have been greatly
exaggerated.
* SPARE a thought for the young rugby player who recently applied to
join Strathclyde Police and was told he was overweight to the point of
obesity. He just could not persuade them that because of his excellence
in powerlifting and heavily developed muscles he was heavy for his
height, but not the slightest bit fat. They would have none of it, and
stuck rigidly to the height / weight ratio chart.
Having looked at some of the polis pounding the beat in Strathclyde,
they should be 7ft 9in on that chart. Anyway, the disappointed young man
has headed to a force in the English Midlands, and will be both a loss
to his rugby club and, very possibly, Strathclyde Police.
* AS a bit of a fan of golf on the quiet, the Diary must raise its hat
to Captain Carl Price of American Airlines, who flew the first flight of
the new schedule from Chicago to Glasgow last week. Little did we
realise that the bold captain had just flown 3356 miles for a game of
golf at what he called ''that magnificent stretch of golfing land''
around Troon in Ayrshire.
Not for him, though, the big name clubs. Instead, he opted for the
warm welcome and choice available at the three courses run by Kyle and
Carrick District Council. He will return for the month of August, having
shamelessly pulled rank as chief pilot to land the Glasgow run.

<HEADLINE>We should pick up climbers, says Bristow.  Private firm and RAF argue over rescues</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>KEITH SINCLAIR</BYLINE>

<RECORDNO>978960649</RECORDNO>

THE dispute over control of the air rescue services has been
heightened by the RAF airlifting climbers on Skye despite a private
helicopter being much closer to the scene.
The military wants to retain its Search and Rescue capability for
pilot training purposes, while private helicopter operators such as
Bristow are keen to take over some SAR services, as they face a cut back
in their lucrative North Sea oil rig business.
The dispute was highlighted last week when four climbers from
Birmingham University were lost in fog on a mountain on Skye.
A Bristow rescue helicopter from Stornoway was only minutes from the
climbers and reported its position to the RAF rescue co-ordination
centre at Pitreavie, Fife. However, a helicopter already dispatched from
RAF Lossiemouth carried out the rescue.
The climbers were only a 30-minute flight from Stornoway, where
Bristow operates one of its three SAR services for the coastguard.
RAF Lossiemouth was a one-hour flight from the scene and the RAF crew
was 30 minutes from the climbers when the Stornoway helicopter informed
the RAF that it was in the area.
Most mountain rescues are carried out by the RAF, but Bristow said
that its services should be used in such cases.
A spokesman for Bristow at its headquarters in Surrey said: ''We are
contracted for maritime rescue, but we have the equipment and personnel
to do mountain rescues.
''In fact, most of our pilots are military trained and actually
trained many of the military pilots carrying out their rescues.
''We are surprised the military get called out sometimes when they are
farther away. Skye is not the only place. It happens elsewhere. It seems
strange to us and probably even stranger to those waiting to get
rescued.
''I think the military like doing the service because it is good PR
for them and a lot of careers and jobs depend on it. We are keen to
tender for the other SAR areas when the Government decides to.''
He added: ''Why should the military be involved, particularly at a
time of defence cuts, in an area which is principally civilian?''
However, Squadron Leader Tony Cowan, based at the Ministry of Defence
in London, defended such rescues and claimed that Bristow's staff were
not trained for mountain rescue.
He added: ''Our aircraft are there primarily for the rescue of
military personnel. But I accept that 90% of those rescued are
civilians.
''We provide the public with a Rolls-Royce SAR service. It is the best
in the world, bar none.
''For instance a private operator cannot match our response times of a
back-up second aircraft. That is why our costs are dearer -- back-up
aircraft, the needed extra personnel, and training.''
Flight Lieutenant Bill Pearce, based at the RAF's rescue co-ordination
centre for Scotland and the North of England in Pitreavie, added that
the helicopter which rescued the climbers on Skye was used for
''operational'' reasons.
He said: ''People must realise that there are certain circumstances
where an RAF aircraft would be used before another, even if the other
one was nearer. For example, if the RAF aircraft was airborne it would
be used and, as I understand it, that was the case with the Skye
rescue.''
Of the 12 SAR bases in the UK, nine are still operated by the military
and six by the RAF. Bristow has been operating rescue helicopters in
Shetland, Stornoway, and in Hampshire for the past eight years at a cost
of #2m a year for each base. The military costs are said to be as much
as four times higher.
Commenting on the Skye rescue, Mr Calum MacDonald, the Labour MP for
the Western Isles, said: ''I am gravely concerned that lives should be
put at risk and I shall be writing to the Scottish Office to ensure that
any problems can be immediately resolved.
''We fought long enough to get a SAR base in Stornoway. We should be
making best use of it.''

AFTER the latest Rangers victory, coupled with Motherwell's defeat,
Richard Gough received a phone call of congratulation on Saturday night
from his old Spurs team-mate Gary Mabbutt.
On to the line came Mabbutt's room-mate, Jurgen Klinsmann, to add his
good wishes and to ask the Ibrox skipper: ''Isn't it getting a bit
boring just winning title after title up there?''
It's a question Gough has become adept at fielding when he talks with
players from other countries. And it's one he finds relatively easy to
answer. Gough, who must now be one of the most successful skippers in
Rangers history, doesn't get bored with winning. Especially winning
championships.
''You can understand the question,'' he grins, ''but honestly, I will
still get as big a kick out of winning this title as I did when I won my
first with Dundee United.
''We just want to clinch this one at home on Sunday against Hibs and
let the supporters celebrate a little bit. After that we start looking
at the next championship.
''I don't know if many of us thought, back at the beginning, that we
would be sitting now with seven successive championships won. But we all
know what the fans want. They would like to see us beat the Celtic
record, and that is what we have to try to do.
''It's possible we can achieve that -- but we can only look towards
one campaign at a time. This has been the most difficult so far, and I
always felt that it would be.
''But landing another title is far from boring, believe me!''
Gough recognises that the Ibrox team has been heavily criticised this
season, despite running away with the title. He knows, too, that he has
taken some personal stick from a support that seems ever more demanding.
He shrugs: ''There is always going to be a bit of criticism about. As
far as I'm concerned, I know I just have to take it and then go out on
to the field and stand up to be counted there. You don't hide from it.
To be honest, when you start to get a little bit older, you become a
target. It goes with the territory.
''As for the team; well, we have been in a transitional period, and I
think we all knew that at the start of the season. I reckoned when we
began this campaign that we would have problems here and there and that
it could be the trickiest title of them all so far.
''At times it has been that way, and we have had to grind out some
results. But the proof is there for anyone to see.
''People are entitled to criticise, and some of that happens because
we have set high standards over the years. But when you look at the end
result, the championship flag will be flying over Ibrox again next
season, and that is what counts for all of us, players and supporters
alike.''
Gough is now 33, but remains superbly fit and still hungry for
honours. He has racked up a formidable haul of medals with Rangers --
seven from the league championship, two from the Scottish Cup, and five
from the League Cup.
He would still like to add to that collection, and says: ''None of us
ever wants to stop playing, and I'm no different from any other in that
sense.
''It would be nice to go on and win still more medals with Rangers. I
think we are capable of continuing our run of success, especially now
that this season is out of the way.
''I doubt if the manager has been able to play the same team four
times on the trot, and I don't know if he has ever been able to play the
side he would look on as his best.
''The injuries have taken their toll on the club's resources, and
that's why it was so good to see Trevor Steven back and playing well in
the game against Aberdeen.
''And we had Mark Hateley back today. He scored just as he is always
liable to do when a ball is played across the face of goal. Then there's
Brian Laudrup, whose contribution has been superb.
''I've been watching him go past players all season and am still
wondering just how he does it. There is a buzz all around the stadium
whenever he gets possession.
''We are almost there now, but we don't want just to win it and then
stop playing the way we seemed to do last season. We want to win our
games from now until the end, and we won't be doing anyone any favours
apart from ourselves. That's the way it has to be.''
Gough has had a variety of partners at the heart of the Ibrox defence
this season, indicative of the injury problems he mentioned earlier. He
suffered himself in an autumn spell when he was sidelined for seven
games, but in 28t matches has demonstrated the qualities of leadership
that made him a priority target when Graeme Souness and Walter Smith
kicked off the glittering new Ibrox era.
The single-mindedness Gough has always shown remains one of his
greatest assets, as a defender of undoubted class and a captain always
ready to lead by example.
Sunday will be the fifth time he has celebrated a title win as captain
and, unless other clubs and potential challengers can get their acts
together in the summer, few would bet against Gough doing the same again
in a year's time.
And he won't find it the least, little bit boring!

YEARS of amateur detective work by Mr Alex Kelly paid off when he met
his sister for the first time yesterday. There were tears of joy as Mr
Kelly, 46, hugged sister Mrs Irene Lamont, 45, in Ayr, the town of their
roots.
An ill-fated family situation led Mr Kelly to be brought up by nuns at
Nazareth House in Aberdeen. His two-week-old sister Irene was taken into
care and later adopted by a couple from West Lothian.
For decades they did not know of each other's existence -- until Mr
Kelly heard rumours that spurred him to start his search.
He said: ''It's taken a lot of hard work to find Irene, but it's all
been worth it. A counsellor helped me in the search, and I wrote to
Irene when I was convinced she was my sister.
''We spoke on the phone last week, and fixed up this meeting in Ayr
with other members of the family.''
Mr Kelly lives with his wife Margaret and their two daughters in
Maybole, Ayrshire, where he is a community councillor and chairman of
the local crime prevention panel.
Mrs Lamont, who also has two daughters, is a home help in Armadale,
where she lives with husband Robert.
She said: ''It's unbelievable to meet him and a sister and other
brothers I never knew I had.''
Also at the reunion were family members Anne, 44, Michael, 42, and
James, 41, who all live in Ayrshire.

LABOUR is demanding an inquiry into why a secure place could not be
found for a 15-year-old boy who was murdered two days after a Children's
Panel ordered that he should be kept in secure accommodation for his own
safety.
The dead boy's mother has instructed her solicitor to begin
proceedings to sue the social work department involved.
Disturbed teenager Paul Stronner volunteered to attend the Children's
Panel meeting, on December 1 last year, in the knowledge that an order
would be made to send him to a secure unit.
But as social workers frantically tried to find a place for the boy,
he was left to roam the streets and live in a squat.
Just two days after the order was made to place Paul into secure
accommodation, he lay dying from stab wounds in a Dundee Street.
The Dundee Children's Panel had ruled: ''He is likely to injure
himself or other persons, unless he is kept in secure accommodation.''
Last week, 17-year-old Stuart Swan was jailed for life for Paul's
murder and two other youths were sentenced to five years each for
culpable homicide. A fourth youth was sentenced to six months for
assault.
Last night, Labour's local government spokesman John McAllion said:
''This is an incredible state of affairs. One life has been lost and his
family devastated. But four other lives have been ruined and their
families are suffering -- all because the order of the Children's Panel
was not implemented.'
He added: ''I want an inquiry into all of the circumstances
surrounding this case. In particular, I want to establish whether no
places were available and, if places were available, I want to know why
Paul Stronner, a 15-year-old boy, was left to live in a squat.''
Paul's solicitor, Mr Joe Myles, said: ''When you hear talk of street
children, you think of Brazil, not Scotland. But that was the reality
for Paul.
''It is a tragedy, if the resources had been available that should
have been, this young boy would be alive.''
Last night, Mr Peter Bates, Tayside Region's director of social work,
declined to comment.

<TEXT>
THE bitter argument between Earl Spencer, the brother of the Princess
of Wales, and tabloid newspapers over alleged media harassment of his
wife intensified yesterday.
The earl said newspapers should not be allowed to use ''the deep
personal unhappiness of private people to outgun their rivals in a
circulation war''.
His complaint concerns media tactics in reporting that 29-year-old
Countess Spencer, former model Victoria Lockwood, was being treated for
bulimia nervosa at the private Farm Place clinic in Ockley, Surrey.
He claimed that journalists posed as medical correspondents,
prospective patients, and close friends of his wife to try to gain
access to her.
But the News of the World said in an opinion column that he had
''seized opportunity after opportunity to put himself in the public eye,
grabbing fees from newspapers, magazines, and TV companies along the
diamond-studded way''.
The earl, a television journalist for an American company, formally
complained to the Press Complaints Commission last week about alleged
media harassment of his wife at the clinic.
The allegations were against the News of the World, the People, and
the Daily Mirror.
The earl's latest salvo came on BBC Radio 4's Mediumwave programme. He
said his wife had been ''tormented'' for a decade by various mental
conditions.
He added: ''As soon as she was admitted, the tabloids fell on the
story, desperate to be the first to rip the heart out of it . . . and to
hell with it if the resulting carnage set back the patient, perhaps
irreversibly.''
Meanwhile, the News of the World launched a savage attack on the earl
as it pictured front pages from Hello! magazine which has featured the
couple, who have four children, twice in the past few years.
Below the headline Hypocrisy of the arrogant Earl Spencer, it said he
''has not flinched from photo opportunities'' and that he reportedly
received #250,000 for a 19-page picure spread in Hello! in 1992.
It said the earl inherited a #50m estate when his father died and a
seat in the Lords with the right to vote on anything before Parliament.
It concluded: ''It follows therefore that Charles Edward Maurice is no
ordinary citizen. Nor has he made any attempt to be one.
''Family disputes, relationships -- even the psychiatric eating
disorders of his wife Victoria -- have been fair game, when it suited
his Lordship.''
The News of the World admitted taking a photograph of Countess Spencer
in the grounds of the clinic from a nearby public road.
''Careful consideration was given to the publication of that picture
for we knew it could be in breach of our own Code of Practice.
''If it caused offence of distress to Lady Spencer, we apologise to
her. But one reason we carried it was to prove our story was true.''

IN ENGLAND
IT is almost a part of English football tradition -- especially in a
season when three or more clubs in the top division are for the chop --
that one team will plummet from on high and end up losing their heads in
the frantic struggle against relegation.
With Arsenal, Coventry, Aston Villa, and Sheffield Wednesday not yet
safe but looking a little more stable, it is Norwich City who are
attracting concerned glances.
When the old year was rung out, with a 2-1 victory over Newcastle,
Norwich lay seventh in the table and were thinking of a return to the
UEFA Cup they had graced so admirably against Bayern Munich and Inter
last season.
Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Newcastle means the East Anglians have won
just one of 15 league games played since. They are a mere four points
above the relegation positions and have played more matches than any
other team in the increasingly congested bottom half.
Popular opinion is divided on whether Norwich are a suitable case for
consigning to the wasteland of the Endsleigh League. Always one of the
most friendly and trouble-free of clubs, they won a reputation under
Mike Walker for football of a quality to match their hospitality, and
deserved their chance to compete in Europe for the first time.
Since then, not only Walker but players such as Chris Sutton (#5m) and
Ruel Fox (#2.3m) have left for bigger, richer clubs and been
inadequately replaced.
Although Norwich acted quickly by installing coach John Deehan as
manager, results dropped off and restlessness among the natives
increased.
Many of the local farming folk, appreciating the need for keeping a
house in financial order, have backed chairman Robert Chase in his
insistence that every player has his price, and that compulsory stadium
development must be paid for without jeopardising the club's future.
Others, seeing Walker as hero rather than villain despite his failure
at Everton, believe a fatal lack of ambition at the top has begun a
vicious circle that could now take in relegation and further sales and
decline.
Watch out for Wednesday night's result at home to Nottingham Forest,
themselves a team with something to play for as they seek to confirm a
return to Europe.
Forest did neither their own cause, nor Norwich's, any good on
Saturday by managing only a 1-1 draw at home to West Ham, who remain in
the bottom four.
Sheffield Wednesday, hit for seven by Forest on their own ground the
previous week, stopped the slide with a win over Leicester, whose
demise, like Ipswich's, will become a mathematical certainty before too
long.
The effect of Newcastle's win, which included two goals from Peter
Beardsley, was to consolidate their third position above Forest.
Blackburn, given a free weekend, will be a daunting 11 points clear of
Manchester United if they win at home to Crystal Palace tomorrow night.
Although Kenny Dalglish's team will have played one match more, the
points in hand will be an added psychological bonus and surely put
recovery beyond United's reach.
In the only other Premiership match played on Saturday, Queen's Park
Rangers beat Arsenal 3-1, raising an issue more important than the
fixture itself.
Arsenal, by virtue of their determined defence of the European
Cup-winners' Cup, had played a draining semi-final against Sampdoria on
Thursday night and wanted Saturday's game moved back 24 hours, as had
been the custom in earlier rounds.
QPR refused, the Premier League declined to back a club that has done
them proud in Europe, and a tired-looking Arsenal were beaten.

THE resignation of another Tory office-bearer over sexual allegations
has plunged relations between the press and the Conservative Party to a
new low.
Mr Richard Spring tendered his resignation as Parliamentary Private
Secretary to the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew,
following claims in the News of the World that he was involved in a
three-in-a bed affair.
So far, MPs have come down on the side of allowing the press
self-regulation, but at least one senior back bench Tory called last
night for a privacy law to restrain newspaper coverage, and it might be
that the matter will be looked at again.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the Tory back bench finance committee,
said: ''The press is getting out of control. This (the claim made about
Mr Spring) is not a matter of public interest. He probably had no
alternative but to resign, but in France they would not be able to do
this.
''I do not see it is right for the press to make these sort of
disclosures. It isn't as if it were corruption. Lloyd George was bedding
women on the floor of Downing Street when he was Prime Minister during
World War One and he played a significant part in winning the war. What
good would it have done anybody if he had resigned?''
Mr Townend said he thought Mr Spring's resignation would make little
difference to party morale, because it was ''pretty punch drunk
already''.
He added: ''We could certainly do without any of these incidents, but
this campaign has been going on so long the general public does not take
much notice because there is more adultery, there are more divorces, and
more single parent families in society.''
Mr Townend's stance won support from Chingford Tory MP Iain
Duncan-Smith, who attacked the newspaper claims as ''puerile''. He said:
''There are those who are writing the newspapers who have probably had
dinner parties where who knows what they said about their editors or
people who are very close to them.
''We're getting into a sort of witch-hunting regime where it only
seems that somebody has to ring up someone at the press and say 'oh, by
the way, I heard so and so say this or that'.
''It gets plastered over a newspaper and somebody then, strangely, has
to resign. I find the whole thing really rather childish and stupid.''
Mr Spring's constituency chairman, Mr Nigel Roman, said: ''I am very
saddened with the whole thing. It seems that an Englishman's home is no
longer his castle. He has done the honourable thing by resigning. He has
been a gentleman over this and I think people will realise perhaps some
of the things attributed to Richard need investigating.''
Mr Spring's resignation came on the third anniversary of his election
as MP for Bury St Edmunds when he gained a majority of more than 18,000.
He was divorced two years ago from his wife Janie. They had a son and
daughter.
Mr Spring, who was not available for comment, appears to have acted on
the Prime Minister's edict that any member of his administration found
misbehaving should quit straight away.
Only last week on Panorama, Mr Major repeated his insistence that
members of his Government should ''behave''.
His administration has lost a steady stream of around 20 politicians
through resignations or sackings, many over personal indiscretions.
Meanhile, Labour MP Ken Livingstone has said that he would never
confess to an affair unless top party image makers demanded it. He does
not tell them anything, he says.
''The idea that you would tell the top spin doctor that you had been
having an affair would mean that you would be blackmailed for the rest
of your life.
''I know Labour's spin doctor. I won't tell him anything. It has done
me no harm for the last seven years,'' he tells a TV programme about
moral dilemmas.
''The Whips keep a file on all the gossip and then you start rocking
the boat and they say -- does your wife know about Mrs So and So? You
don't tell anyone anything that they don't need to know.''
The MP for Brent East appears in BBC1's Do The Right Thing programme
tomorrow night where people are confronted with a fictional dilemma and
asked -- what would you do?

FOR the third time in less than a year, Edinburgh's Festival Theatre
has been prevented by Scottish Opera from inviting other leading British
companies to visit Scotland with productions of the international
quality for which -- at great expense -- the theatre was designed.
Opera North, the latest casualty, was all set to appear this autumn
with performances of Janacek's Jenufa, Bizet's The Pearl Fishers, and
Ambroise Thomas's Hamlet, when Scottish Opera complained to the Arts
Council of England that its territory was being invaded. As a result,
the Leeds-based company has been forced to withdraw.
Plans to bring Welsh National Opera and Glyndebourne Touring Opera to
Edinburgh have been similarly squashed by Scottish Opera under the terms
of the Arts Council's ''Spheres of Influence'' policy, which exerts a
geographical control over the touring of all the main British companies.
According to Mr Paul Iles, the theatre's general manager, it is now
''impossible'' to bring a leading opera company, with the exception of
Scottish Opera itself, to the recently refurbished theatre except during
the Edinburgh Festival.
Mr Iles does not conceal that he considers Scottish Opera's objections
''unreasonable''. ''This time we were very close to contracting a
five-night season of Opera North,'' he says, ''when we were told that
Scottish Opera had complained to the Arts Council of England, and that
the Arts Council supported Scottish Opera's line.''
Mr Richard Mantle, who today runs Opera North after several years with
Scottish Opera, says he has accepted the inevitable, adding that ''we
must defer on such occasions to the host opera company.''
Complaints under the terms of the ''Spheres of Influence'' policy can
take two forms. One concerns overlapping repertoire, but Opera North's
choice of pieces complemented rather than conflicted with Scottish
Opera's promised November productions of Don Giovanni, La Belle Helene,
From the House of the Dead, and The Jacobin.
The other lies in proximity of dates, and here Scottish Opera might
seem on stronger ground. Because Opera North was booked to come in
October, one month before a five-night visit by Scottish Opera, there
was fear on Scottish Opera's part that attendances would suffer.
But Mr Iles dismisses this as ''groundless'', pointing out that dance
companies, including the Scottish Ballet, are happy to appear in close
succession, and that audiences have increased as a result.
''In the first nine months of the Festival Theatre's new life,'' he
says, ''we have sold about 100,000 tickets for ballet and dance. We have
achieved larger ballet audiences than any other theatre outside
London.''
But Mr Richard Jarman, Scottish Opera's general director, views things
differently. ''In the long term,'' he says, ''we want to see Edinburgh
audiences built up, but we believe it should be done in a planned and
sustainable way. Having Scottish Opera build the audience strongly is
the best way of doing it.''
This year, he admits, the company's visits to the Festival Theatre
have been brief and widely spaced, but next year there will be a total
of five weeks of Scottish Opera in Edinburgh.
Though he says he ''wouldn't rule out'' other companies coming to
Scotland with a complementary repertoire, he believes that presenting
Opera North one month before Scottish Opera would inevitably ''affect
our booking and financial position'', and points out that Scottish Opera
has been excluded from areas of England for the same reason.
Meanwhile, faced with a hole in his October schedule, the
indefatigable Mr Iles is now liaising with the Opera Theatre of Dublin,
a company that lies outside the Arts Council's sphere of influence and
can offer him a production of Handel's Tamerlano and a new version of
Gluck's Orfeo using a live orchestra and electronic tape. Scottish
Opera's reactions are awaited with interest.

THE roar of jet-skis and power boats thundering around Loch Lomond
yesterday reached the ears of hillwalkers 1300ft above sea level on
Conic Hill. The first of the Easter holidaymakers with their yuppie toys
had landed on the bonnie banks.
Loch Lomond might be Scotland's prettiest stretch of water, but it is
now at its most deafening and dangerous. All that is supposed to change
in two months' time, with the introduction of a long-awaited set of
by-laws.
The new rules, aimed at curbing speed and excessive noise and setting
down safety procedures, are seen by many as the saving grace for Loch
Lomond's once-serene shores. Yet experts believe it will make little or
no difference.
''The police can't stop speeding cars; how are they going to catch
boats that go too fast? People will always speed, whether on land or
sea. It's human nature,'' said Mr Donald Cameron, of the 18-strong Loch
Lomond Boat Rescue team.
Loch Lomond's problem, however, could be set to move east. For the
jet-skiers say they would move to the River Forth if the by-laws cramp
their style. They say they will decamp to Inverkeithing and South
Queensferry.
Skier David Johnston, 29, of Glasgow, said: ''There's no point staying
here when we could have the freedom of the sea and reach whatever speeds
we like. If these new laws come in, we're heading east.
''It's not just about the speed restrictions. There will be havoc on
the loch. Fifty power boats in one small area is just asking for
trouble.''
Meanwhile, at Loch Lomond, a promise to assist the emergency services
is written into the rescue crew's constitution. But no-one wants to be
accused of taking sides.
''I don't want the boat involved in full-time police work,'' said Mr
Cameron. ''We're there for the benefit of everyone on the loch, not just
the enforcement of by-laws.
''Nobody wants these rules -- unfortunately they're necessary.''
A five-strong team of rangers and an administrative clerk will enforce
the loch legislation. Funded by Scottish National Heritage, the scheme
will cost #345,000 for a three-year experimental period.
But critics say the rangers will adopt the ''kid-glove' rather than
SAS-type approach. And they are sceptical about the quality of evidence
necessary in court.
One local resident said: ''How can you prove someone was speeding?
There's no speed gun to measure it by. People are confused about how
these laws are going to work out.''
Mr Nick Pennington, of the Loch Lomond Park Authority, said: ''At the
moment the jet-skiers and speed boat racers have right of navigation
over the whole loch. Basically anyone who can get a boat on to the water
can use it.
''Under the by-laws all power boats would have to be registered with
us and speeds would be restricted to 6 mph within 150 metres of the
shoreline. The rules of the road would also apply to the loch, with
night lighting and proper manouvering proceedures.''
A survey by Glasgow University showed a record 500 boats on the loch
at any given time last year. And 10 mph speed limits imposed on several
Lake District waterways mean speed freaks are moving north.
The Lomond and Trossachs Working Group says all it wants is more
responsible use on the 27-mile long loch.
Last week, at the local sheriff court, a hefty fine was imposed on a
jet-skier, accused of colliding with a woman water-skier.
''Nobody likes the jet-skiers,'' said Mr Cameron. ''They get terrible
publicity.
''It's a young man's game. A lot of them come up to the piers and
beaches because they like to play to an audience.''
When it comes to lethal weapons, power-boats are streaks ahead. With
boats getting faster and faster, locals claim the irresponsible
boy-racers do most of the damage. With many now capable of doing the
''ton'', campaigners are demanding a driving licence for speedboat
users.
During a fatal accident inquiry last year into the speedboat death of
a woman on the loch, a driver admitted he did not know the difference
between port and starboard.
But it is not just the responsible boat users, water skiers, canoeists
and local residents who suffer from the power-hungry speed junkies.
''It's the fishermen I feel sorry for,'' added Mr Cameron. ''They pay
#130 a year for a permit and their lines are always getting ensnared by
a power boat. Yet there's nothing the fishermen can do -- they can't
exactly run after the boats.''

JOHAN Cruyff's announcement that he is to remain with Barcelona for
two more years followed guarantees from the board that they would
''totally support'' his plans to reconstruct the club.
The Dutch coach had earlier indicated that internal dissent and the
club's exit from the Champions' League had placed his future at the Nou
Camp in question, but this weekend he said: ''The board has promised
that everything possible will be done to restore harmony within our
ranks. Their commitment was sufficient for me to believe that this will
now happen and I will be allowed to work normally again.
''Only players that I want will be signed by Barcelona and they will
play under the conditions I lay down.
''Never again will I award a contract to a player whereby he collects
a huge salary regardless of results. In future they must win
championships and trophies if they are to become millionaires.
''This is the way I worked as a player with Ajax and Barcelona and it
is the only way forward. We suffered this season because players had
been bloated by riches.''
Cruyff has targeted the Portuguese international midfielder Luis Figo,
of Sporting Lisbon, as his next signing. The Romanian Gheorghe Hagi may
move as part exchange.

Mijatovic, while Paris St Germain want Romanian striker Florin Raducioiu
to replace George Weah.
* THE French FA will decide on Thursday whether Olympique Marseille
will be relegated to the third division.
This sanction was already enforced in the aftermath of the bribery
scandal involving Valenciennes two years ago.
At the moment Marseille are second in their division which mean an
automatic return to the top flight if they remain in the same position
at the end of the season.
The problem is that the stricken club's debts of around #30m are twice
the level permitted in France. Their former player Rudi Voeller has
revealed he will sue if the club does not pay off #900,000 in taxes owed
on his salary.
There is no hope that their disgraced ex-owner Bernard Tapie can help
as he is officially bankrupt with debts of #180m.
The best hope in avoiding demotion is for a survival package,
involving the regional government as new owners, to be accepted. The
fact that the French FA wish to erect a new stadium in Marseille for the
1998 World Cup is another reason for local optimism.
* FEYENOORD face sanctions if there is any further trouble involving
their support which taunted the respected Ajax coach Louis van Gaal
about the death of his wife from cancer. The Dutch FA have threatened to
deduct points from the Rotterdam side should there be any recurrence.
* OFF-field problems continue to hinder former England manager Bobby
Robson's attempt to clinch the championship for FC Porto. On probation
after a shameful dust-up with Sporting Lisbon, Porto fear the worst
after 15 fans were injured in a riot at their match with Vitoria
Guimaraes.
* THE Swedish league championship, which began over the weekend, will
be used this season to experiment with time-outs for coaches.
FIFA secretary general Sepp Blatter said yesterday that if the
practice is deemed a success, it will be introduced into next year's
European Championship finals and then become effective for the season
1996-97 world-wide.
''We really believes that providing coaches with a two-minute time-out
in each half will allow them the chance to improve their teams,'' said
Blatter.
It will certainly allow football to generate more income through TV
commercials when time-outs are called.
* IT has been said that Rod Stewart's arms never reach his sporran,
but the good people of Hammarby, in Sweden, will hear none of it. The
rock star has just agreed to sponsor their team for #10,000 this season
after learning of its financial difficulties in a television documentary
featuring Lennart Skoglund, one of Sweden's greatest-ever players.

PAUL Gascoigne returned to action yesterday after a year on the
sidelines with a broken leg.
England manager Terry Venables watched his star midfielder play the
full 90 minutes for Lazio in the 2-0 victory over Reggiana.
Afterwards, Venables said: ''Paul can be very satisfied with himself.
He must have worked very hard to get in shape to play for 90 minutes.''
Gascoigne's return will boost Venables hopes that he will be fit to
take part in the tournament involving Japan, Sweden, and Brazil in
England in June.
The crowd at the Olympic Stadium gave Gascosigne a hero's welcome.
They roared their approval as the shaven-headed star took the field.
Many waved Union Jacks and banners saying ''Enjoy Gazza'' and ''Gazza
Forever.''
Gascoigne paced himself in a low-key match, but grew in confidence as
the game wore on, showing glimpses of his rare talent in what was only
his fortieth league appearance in almost three years in Italy.
He might have scored in 44 minutes, but for once his touch let him
down, and in 70 minutes when he put a close-range header wide.
Lazio's goals came from Roberto Rambaudi and Giuseppe Signori.

THE will of the 10th Earl of Selkirk published at the weekend
confirmed that #500,000 will go to the next holder of the disputed
title.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the Scottish Office Minister, who
formally renounced his claim to the earldom to remain a Tory MP, had
earlier instructed counsel to stake a claim on behalf of his son John
Andrew, 16.
0 Although only brief details of the 10th Earl's will were given, Mr
Henry Clark, the executor, confirmed yesterday: ''A sum of #500,000 plus
family portraits and a few other items was left by the earl to whoever
succeeds him in the title.
''There were numerous other bequests to family members.''
George Douglas-Hamilton, 88, a former FirstLord of the Admiralty, left
an estate of #1,346,278 gross, #1,299,624 net.
The only legacies published were #1000 each to churches in London and
Edinburgh, and to Balliol College, Eton College, Edinburgh University,
and the RAF Benevolent Fund.
Following the private family reading of the will three months ago, the
legacy threw back into dispute who should be the next earl.
Lord James's cousin, Mr Alasdair Douglas-Hamilton, a lawyer named as
heir apparent in Burke's Peerage and Baronetage and Debrett's, had
always expected to inherit, and has vowed to fight for his claim in the
Scottish College of Heralds in front of the Lord Lyon.
Sir Crispin Agnew of Lochnaw has been retained by Lord James to pursue
the claim on behalf of his son. The case will be heard within the next
few months.
The counter claims have arisen because the Earldom of Selkirk carries
the most baffling and complex remainder -- inheritance rules -- in the
entire Scots peerage.
The outcome might well rest on the interpretation of the original
creation of the title.
In 1646, Charles I made his cousin -- the younger brother of the 1st
Duke of Hamilton -- the Earl of Selkirk. The terms were such that the
title would pass to the younger brothers of successive dukes.
In 1886, the earldom and dukedom were merged, but the arrangement was
revived in 1940 when the 13th Duke died, through special remainder which
allowed the 14th Duke's younger brother, George, to become the 10th
earl.
Lord James is the immediate younger brother of the present and 15th
Duke.
Alasdair's father, Malcolm, a former Tory MP who died in 1962, was the
younger brother, after George, of the 14th duke -- who died in 1973. Had
he survived George, Malcolm could have been expected to inherit the
earldom.
Alasdair, a specialist in trustee work for the Bank of Scotland, known
as the Master of Selkirk, said: ''I have a letter from a previous Lord
Lyon stating in reasonably clear terms that I would succeed when my
uncle died. That letter is now lodged with my solicitors.''

airlifted to Britain for treatment but who died a week ago. Mr Ramiz
Hadzimuratovic, pictured with his other daughter, Medina, four, was told
his status is ''under consideration''.
Friends of Mr Hadzimuratovic, whose wife died in the Sarajevo attack
that injured Irma, hope to persuade the Government to allow him and
Medina to stay in Britain, according to the Sunday Times. A Home Office
spokesman did say that ''there is a clear policy of not sending
nationals from the former Yugoslavia back to a war zone''.

THE Ministry of Defence has agreed compensation with the families of
three Servicemen who were killed when their RAF Hercules transport plane
crashed in a remote Highland glen two years ago, it was claimed
yesterday.
Nine RAF airmen were killed when the plane crashed in the narrow Glen
Loch valley near Pitlochry on May 27, 1993.
There were no survivors and no witnesses to the last moments of the
aircraft.
The Hercules, normally based at RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire, was one of
three aircraft on a low-flying training exercise, heading to RAF
Lossiemouth. Weather conditions were good when it crashed at 3.55pm. It
was the first crash involving an RAF Hercules for almost 20 years.
It emerged last November, after an inquest in Wiltshire recorded
verdicts of accidental death on eight of the RAF airmen, that relatives
of the nine aircrew who were killed were consulting lawyers about the
possibility of legal action against the MoD. The aircrew included two
Scots.
The procurator-fiscal at Perth decided there would be no fatal
accident inquiry into the death of Sergeant Craig Hilliard, 23, an air
load master from Inverness. The other Scot was Squadron Leader Stanley
Duncan Muir, 49, a navigator from Midlothian.
Yesterday a BBC radio report claimed that the MoD had agreed to pay
compensation to the families of three of the dead aircrew.
According to the report, lawyers acting for the dead men's families
had threatened to sue the Government claiming that the plane was
overloaded with fuel and that the route had not been checked properly
before the mission.
The lawyers had alleged that the plane was carrying more fuel so that
a refuelling plane would not have to be called out. They also alleged
that a rocky outcrop hit by the plane was not on the map used by the
crew.
It is understood the legal settlement is in favour of three crew
members who were not at the controls of the plane. A separate legal
challenge against the MoD on behalf of the other crew members is
possible.
However, it is unlikely to include a claim on behalf of Sergeant
Hilliard. His mother, Rosemary, said yesterday at her home in Inverness,
that news of the compensation agreement for three of the aircrew had
come as ''a shock'' to her.
''I knew that some of the wives of the airmen who died were getting
together in England to launch a legal action against the RAF,'' she
said. ''My son's body was never removed from Scotland. The procurator
said his death was accidental.''
An MoD spokesman in London refused to confirm any settlement
yesterday. He would only say: ''We don't discuss any compensation
whatever the situation is between individuals and the MoD. It is a
matter for them and us.''
The inquest in November heard how the crew had completed their
exercise and were headed for Lossiemouth when they were suddenly
confronted by a rocky outcrop which they tried to avoid. In performing
the manoeuvre at low level and low speed, the Hercules stalled and
crashed, killing all on board in a massive fireball.
The inquest also heard a claim by Captain David Carter, a civil
airline and former Hercules pilot who flew with Squadron Leader Graeme
Young, 54, who died in the crash, that the RAF had ''recklessly''
over-fuelled the #20m aircraft.
Captain Carter said the plane was carrying 46,000lbs of fuel -- the
equivalent of a two-day sortie -- and claimed this was more than the
requirement of the training mission which he estimated was about
34,000lbs.
Captain Carter claimed the extra fuel load would have meant the pilot
was in ''an impossible situation'' as he tried to manoeuvre out of the
valley.

Hamilton 1, St Johnstone 0
DESPITE only one goal being scored, this was no drab end-of-season
match, with both sides creating chances galore.
Defeat ended any lingering hopes St Johnstone may have entertained of
a promotion place, though as a bemused Paul Sturrock, the manager,
commented: ''We had enough opportunities to win two or three matches.''
However, he promised ''big investments and big changes for the start
of next season.''
Iain Munro was philosophical: ''With no permanent home ground and no
money to spend, we have achieved as much as we can in our current
situation.''
Yet again the difference between the sides was Peter Duffield, who
finished clinically a superb reverse pass from Raymond McStay.
While Duffield slotted his twentieth goal of the season, his keeper,
Allan Ferguson, was equally impressive in defying all Saints' efforts.
He had a string of outstanding saves, especially one block from a
header by substitute Callum Davidson after Accies had gone ahead.
Hamilton were not mere onlookers while all this was going on, and a
long-range effort from Chris Hillcoat almost caught out Alan Main. Early
in the second half, Davie Irons headed clear from under his bar after
John McQuade's shot had beaten Main.
The Hamilton goal came after sustained pressure that saw a Sean
McEntegart header fly narrowly past and Scott McCulloch go close with
another effort.
Both managers can take satisfaction from the displays of youngsters
such as Paul Hartley and McCulloch for Accies and Danny Griffin and
Stuart McCluskey for the visitors.
The attendance of only 858 was Accies' lowest home league gate of the
season.

THIS season's championship trophy has not yet found its way back to
the display cabinet, but Huntly manager Steve Paterson is already
thinking ahead to another Highland League title defence.
Huntly secured their second consecutive title with four games to
spare, thanks to a comfortable 3-0 victory over Wick Academy.
Nevertheless, Paterson is already turning his attention to the
composition of next season's side.
He will soon have five players out of contract and will meet Alan
Selbie, John Gardiner, Alan Dunsire, Eddie Copland, and Andy Fettes even
before this season's trophy is presented at their last game, on April
29. However, Paterson does not envisage many problems.
Meanwhile, playmaker Marco De Barros travelled south last night for a
fortnight's full-time training with Motherwell. The left-sided
midfielder, who asked Paterson to arrange full-time training for him if
the league was wrapped up early, netted twice against Wick after Doug
Rougvie had opened the scoring.
Elsewhere, league top scorer Iain Stewart took his tally to 45 with
both strikes in Lossiemouth's 2-0 win at Peterhead to keep alive their
prospects of finishing second.
Elgin City went ahead through Craig Stewart, but Clach came back to
record a fine 2-1 win after second-half strikes by Robbie Benson and
Philip Lamb.
In the other surprise result of the day, Fort William beat Cove
Rangers 3-1 thanks to Doug Rankin, Ian Polworth, and Tom Drummond, while
Mike Beattie netted for Cove.
Fraserburgh completed their season with an impressive 5-2 rout of
Brora Rangers. Keith McRedie (2), Paul Keith, Duncan Summers, and Marino
Keith were the scorers.
Forres Mechanics upset Keith with a 2-1 away win.

SECOND DIVISION
CLYDE manager Alex Smith insists that he is not just interested in
results, even given the importance of points-gathering at this stage of
the season.
''It's too easy to say that results matter more than the
performance,'' he wrote in the club programme. ''That's just an excuse
for not playing well. I want Clyde to play well and produce good
football.''
His wish was granted on Saturday when their attacking play was
rewarded with a 1-0 win over the leaders, Dumbarton.
Clyde can make further progress towards promotion next Saturday when
they are hosts to second-placed Greenock Morton, and Smith will hope for
a better turn-out than the 600 on Saturday.
Broadwood has been well patronised in the past and surely now the
Bully Wee fans can return in numbers to cheer on their team to possible
success.
Dumbarton hit the woodwork twice and made just as many chances in a
skillful game.
The difference between the teams was a moment of skill and composure
just before the interval from Clyde veteran George McCluskey. The burly
striker fastened on to a pass, shook off his marker, wheeled, and shot
fiercely past Ian McFarlane's outstretched right hand.
One man who won't be playing next weekend is Marko Rajamaki. The Finn
was sent off for a needless handball late on in Morton's 4-1 home win
over East Fife.
A healthy crowd of 1800 saw a John Anderson header put the Greenock
team on their way. After the break, Steve McCahill knocked in a rebound,
Derek Lilley scored a solo goal, and Derek Laing added a fourth before
Alex Hamill's consolation.
Ian McInnes was provider for headers by John Gibson and Willie Watters
which gave Stirling a cushion against Willie Callaghan's counter for
Meadowbank, while Stenhousemuir had the better of their fourth draw this
season against Berwick.
A Duncan Campbell double, a header and a cute lob, eased Queen of the
South's relegation fears away to Brechin, whose demotion may become
official next weekend.

<HEADLINE>crisis looms at the top over bid to axe Lang</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978960667</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang and party chairman Sir Michael Hirst are
set to be moved after the disastrous showing by the Conservatives in
last week's elections for Scotland's new unitary authorities.
However, there could be no-one to take over at the top, The Herald has
discovered, despite a Scottish Tory MP warning that his party is
''staring political bankruptcy in the face'' unless it makes fundamental
changes to policy and personnel.
Yesterday three leading Scottish Conservatives backed Mr Michael
Forsyth, a Home Office Minister, as the man most likely to succeed Mr
Lang -- forecast to move to chair the national party -- but sources
close to Mr Forsyth say he does not want the job.
Right wingers claim Mr Forsyth would bring a much-needed hard edge to
party campaigns and help the Conservatives move on to the offensive
after last week's election losses.
Mr Donald Findlay, QC, called for him to take over the reigns at the
Scottish Office and Sir Michael to resign as Scottish party chairman.
Mr Findlay said: ''Those who have presided over the virtual
elimination of the Tory Party in Scotland should go.''
It was an opinion shared by the Tayside North MP, Mr Bill Walker, who
warned that the party's ''receivers were waiting at the door'', and
former Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart, who said that Mr Forsyth
was ''the only credible candidate'' to succeed Mr Lang.
However, a source close to Mr Forsyth said his private opinion was:
''Why should he dig them out the hole they've dug themselves into?''
He continued: ''Michael is not sitting at the end of a phone waiting
to be asked to save the day. Once you get out of the Scottish Office
you're glad to get out and he certainly doesn't welcome a move to take
him back.
''But unless certain changes are made the party is facing the abyss in
Scotland.''
The Herald understands that Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish, tipped as
another likely successor to Mr Lang, is also reluctant to accept a
Scottish Office portfolio or that of Scottish Party chairman.
With Mr Malcolm Rifkind enjoying his Westminster portfolio, and Mr
Stewart out of the running following his resignation over the M77
incident, there are no other obvious successors to Mr Lang's four-year
hold on the office.
An alternative scenario involves the escalation of Scots English MP Mr
David McLean (Penrith and the Borders) or the promotion of the popular
Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, but both moves are fraught with practical
dilemmas.
Despite the problems, it seems probable that Mr Lang will be asked to
take over from the gaffe-strewn national party chairman, Mr Jeremy
Hanley, before the summer reshuffle.
Mr Lang was unavailable for comment last night, but his move would
provide a major career shift for the man who a year ago said: ''My
ambitions extend no further than being Member of Parliament for Galloway
and Upper Nithsdale and Secretary of State for Scotland.''
Sir Michael will be left to take the blame for last week's debacle and
his subsequent insensitive remarks when he accused the voters of
ingratitude.
Mr Walker believes the movement of senior Scottish party personnel is
long overdue.
''The Conservative Party is staring political bankruptcy in the
face,'' he said yesterday. He claimed it was too simplistic to blame the
disastrous election results on divisions within the party.
He said: ''Those responsible for running the party in Scotland in
recent years must bear the responsibility for the position we are now
in.''
Mr Walker disclosed that a year ago he wrote a confidential report to
the Prime Minister outlining the problems facing the party in Scotland
and what should be done to improve them.
''I predicted that unless we looked at the policies and the
presentation of them better we could face a near wipeout at the local
elections,'' he said.
''Voters weren't so bothered about the divisions in the party as they
were about law and order, VAT on fuel, the future of the West Highland
line, cuts in defence, the ERM and the bungled privatisation of the Post
Office.''
However he said that a coup, similar to that which followed Mr Major's
succession to Mrs Thatcher, would do more harm than good, and the
leadership had rapidly to introduce its own changes.
''Although the leadership of Margaret Thatcher and Teddy Taylor was
not popular to the Tory chattering classes in the late 1970s, that is
the only time we have arrested our electoral decline in Scotland since
1951.
''You only have to look at which segment of the Conservative Party has
been running Scotland since to realise who is to blame.''
The abyss facing the Tories included the loss of Perth and Kinross in
the forthcoming by-election followed by the equally certain defeat of Mr
Lang, Mr Walker, Mr Forsyth, and Mr Phil Gallie in their marginal seats
at the next General Election.

Dundee 1, Ayr United 1
FIRST division title chasers Dundee ought to have known better than to
ignore former manager Simon Stainrod's broad pre-game hint at a fourth
giant-killing attempt of the season at Dens Park on Saturday.
Absent were the flamboyant touches normally associated with the
ex-dark blues employee on visits to his former patch, as Simon's Honest
Men of Ayr extended their unbeaten league sequence against their hosts
with a point which could yet prove decisive in the scramble to clear the
dreaded drop spots.
Simon had to thank his stand-in goalkeeper Stuart McIntosh, who
covered himself with injury-time glory by producing a quite outstanding
save from George Shaw's spot kick, Frank Rolling having floored Dane
Morten Weighorst.
This ought to stand him in good stead for an extended run, regular
'keeper Cammy Duncan's red card, for a forty-fourth minute handling
offence outwith his area, automatically side-lining him from this coming
weekend's action, with an SFA disciplinary ban expected to follow.
Another likely to sit out the run-in is Dundee striker Gerry Britton,
ordered off 20 minutes from the end for an over-the-ball challenge on
John Sharples. He, too, has now topped the disciplinary points ceiling.
Dundee were far from enamoured at the outcome, the points dropped
enabling both Raith Rovers and Dunfermline to leapfrog them into the
first and second rungs in the table.
Neil Duffy powered Dundee into a deserved thirty-fourth minute lead,
only for Ayr's 10 men to get a grip of things after the interval, and
level from the penalty spot through Hugh Burns after player-boss Jim
Duffy had handled a Justin Jackson cross.

Motherwell 1, Partick Thistle 2
ABERDEEN and Dundee United are now the favourites to drop down into
the first division at the end of the season. That is the verdict of
Tommy Turner, whose contribution in Partick Thistle's latest chapter of
the great escape, was immense.
Thistle may not be a pretty sight these days, but just one defeat in
their last 10 league matches is positive proof that they have the
stomach for a battle, something which appears to be lacking at Pittodrie
and Tannadice.
''It would be a disaster for Scottish football if Aberdeen and Dundee
United go down -- but it's waiting to happen,'' said Turner, who set up
Thistle's second goal at Fir Park.
''Having gone through it all with St Johnstone, who were relegated
last season, I didn't want to experience it again. It's horrendous. But
now I am convinced that Thistle's spirit can see us through.
''Everyone had us counted out just a few weeks ago, but look at the
position now. We haven't depended on anyone but ourselves, nor will we.
There is a tremendous spirit about the place and we will save ourselves
without help from anyone.''
It could be argued that Motherwell were by far the better side on
Saturday, but they couldn't cope with the commitment of Thistle, who are
now ahead of both Aberdeen and United in the table -- and they have a
match in hand.
A bad mistake by new boy Mitchel van der Gaag let Ian Cameron in to
give Thistle the lead after 12 minutes, but when young Alex Burns
grabbed an equalser in 26 minutes we expected Motherwell to go ahead and
finish the job.
Instead, Thistle took a deep breath, scored a second through Albert
Craig -- his first league goal this year -- then staged a backs-to-the
wall fight which would have done justice to Mr Custer's men. However,
had Custer the assistance of John Lambie's troops, the Indians would
have three points less than the history books show.
The Thistle manager said: ''To be honest, we played none. Motherwell
dominated for most of the game and they had too much movement off the
ball for us, but we fought hard and I think we deserved the break.
''They say that the breaks even themselves out over the season, but
that hasn't been the case for us. However, with what happened at Fir
Park and the other results going for us, we have to be pleased.''
Lambie must also be delighted with the response he is getting from his
players. From Nicky Walker, an inspiring goalkeeper, right through the
side, there is a grim determination to succeed and to prove everyone
wrong.
Motherwell now face a battle of their own. Just a short time ago, they
looked almost certain to take second spot in the championship and the
UEFA Cup place which goes with it. But only one win in their last six
matches has raised serious doubts.
Manager Alex McLeish said: ''From being in a good position, we have
now given ourselves a battle. It's not only in our hands any more,
because both Hibs and Celtic can now move ahead of us if they win their
games in hand.
''Today's performance was extremely disappointing. We showed good
commitment and urgency in the first half, but didn't get a break.
''However, after Thistle scored their second goal, they just parked
themselves in their own box. We then did something I hate to see. Our
boys started lumping high balls into the box, and that certainly does
not suit us.''

THE SFA and the National Stadium Committee have applied to the
Millennium Fund for half of the #67m it will cost to upgrade Hampden
Park further and provide a complex which could be the envy of Europe,
writes James Traynor.
After a cheque for #5m, which will go towards the renovation of the
south stand, had been presented to Hampden by Football Trust deputy
chairman Tom Wharton before Saturday's Tennents Scottish Cup semi-final,
it was disclosed that a submission has been made to the Millennium Fund
and that there is reason to believe the Hampden project could be looked
upon favourably.
SFA chief executive Jim Farry said that with Ibrox already an
impressive facility and plans for Hampden along with the work being down
by Celtic, Aberdeen, Dundee United, and Motherwell the association would
be in a position soon to bid for major UEFA and FIFA competitions.
Already the submission for Hampden is among the 30% of applications
which survived the first cut and there is cause for optimism that the
national stadium project will be one of the 12 chosen nationally at the
end of the vetting process. The next-stage submissions have to be ready
by the end of this month and Austin Reilly, chairman of the National
Stadium Committee, said the Earl of Dalkeith, who is principal
commissioner in Scotland, has been impressed by his group's approach.
''We are devoting the 33-acre site of Hampden to a facility which will
be for the benefit of the community,'' Reilly said. ''The main arena
would seat 52,000, but a redeveloped Lesser Hampden would seat another
five or six thousand.
''Also, we would incorporate the UK's first football museum and there
would be a domed arena dedicated to the local community. This could be
used for a variety of sports and also include offices.''
Part of the submission refers to an all-sports injury clinic and a
medical research centre. It is also planned to build a state-of-the-art
international communications centre which could be used by visiting
media groups working at events throughout Scotland.
''I believe we have a strong case for millennium funding,'' said
Farry, ''and if all goes well Scotland could be staging major
footballing finals and events.''
* FRENCHMAN Eric Cantona is to begin talks today over his future at
Manchester United.
Cantona's representatives are to meet United chairman Martin Edwards
for discussions over a new contract.
United want Cantona to stay at Old Trafford even though his worldwide
ban for a Kung Fu kick on a Crystal Palace fan does not end until
September 30.
Inter-Milan and Barcelona are believed to be ready to pounce with
#5.5m bids if the talks break down.
* IAN Rush and Mark Hughes are ready to return for Wales to bolster
hopes of ending the country's worst run in a quarter of a century in
Germany later this month.
A hamstring injury forced Rush to miss last month's 3-1 defeat in
Bulgaria, Wales' fourth straight European Championship qualifying game
loss. Hughes was also missing in Sofia, serving a one-match ban.

Airdrie 1, Hearts 0
ANDY Smith was like an overgrown schoolboy as he pranced around in his
short trousers at the end of the match. Alan Lawrence, wearing a grin as
wide as a goalmouth, led a delegation to the east stand where Airdrie's
supporters were gathered, and Kenny Black seemed to be wandering across
Hampden's vast expanse in a daze. Airdrie in their second Tennents
Scottish Cup final in three years? How could this be possible?
Airdrie's manager, Alex MacDonald, and his back-up team had suspected
another cup final appearance would be possible, but few were willing to
go along with them, although they won converts to their way of thinking
soon after the ball started rolling at the national stadium.
When Steve Cooper rose unmolested in Hearts' box after 29 minutes and
headed the ball beyond Craig Nelson, believers flocked to MacDonald's
camp. Memories of past triumphs over teams from Edinburgh helped make
Airdrie even more positive while the opposite was the case for Hearts
throughout the remainder of the first half.
They played like a team haunted. They had lost to Airdrie after a
penalty shoot-out in the semi-final of the '91-92 competition and defeat
again was closing in on them. They did perform better in the second
half, but Airdrie's defence, with Jimmy Sandison, Sandy Stewart, and
Paul Jack immense, were comfortable under pressure and, when they were
breached, John Martin threw himself across his goal like the hero his
supporters have always known him to be.
At one stage late in the match the keeper dived to save from Gary
Mackay and crashed into a post damaging a thigh. The post was rattled
and fortunate to survive, but Martin had to hobble for the remaining
minutes and couldn't kick the ball out.
However, the former miner later dismissed concern about his injury.
''It's nothing, I'll be all right,'' he said in the manner of a good,
old-fashioned hero. ''You know me, I'd go through a brick wall for this
team.''
Martin, the club's longest-serving player, could have been speaking
for all of the others because they had a steely-eyed look about them on
Saturday. In the seconds before kick off they glared across the halfway
line staring their opponents down.
Airdrie's cup tradition -- they have played 13 ties this season and
lost only once, and even that defeat was after a penalty shoot-out
against Raith Rovers in the semi-finals of the Coca-Cola Cup -- and a
fierce desire to reach another final gave them the edge over the
Tynecastle side, who were not helped either by injuries to key players.
It was pointed out after the tie that Jim Bett and Brian Hamilton were
hampered by groin and hamstring injuries respectively, but it would be
an injustice to diminish Airdrie's achievement. The Diamonds deserved
their place in the final and are entitled to believe they can go all the
way.
The Lanarkshire side's preparation was faultless and the strategy
almost perfect, with MacDonald deciding to play Andy Smith wide on the
right in midfield where he was able to prevent Hearts' John Millar from
making runs into the penalty box. Smith coped well and took time out to
surge down the right and deliver the crucial cross for Cooper.
Hearts had three tall men -- Dave McPherson, Willie Jamieson, and
Craig Levein -- in there, yet Cooper was allowed time and space in which
to rise and meet the ball. That single goal, stout defending, poor
finishing, and the bravery of Martin was enough to secure Airdrie's
place in the final.
Although Tommy McLean's side had most of the pressure in the second
half their play lacked sparkle and it was a measure of their frustration
perhaps that of the five players booked, four wore maroon shirts.
Airdrie's Kenny Black was cautioned after having kicked the ball away
while Jamieson, Bett, Millar, and David Hagen were booked.
Also, John Robertson was ordered off five minutes from time after he
had allowed himself to become involved in an exchange with substitute
Anthony Smith, and a miserable afternoon was completed for Hearts.
Robertson was a picture of dejection as he trudged off wearing on his
head a white bandage. The striker had collided with Jack early in the
match and required the covering as protection from further injury.
One wonders what medicine the Tynecastle medics may possess to help
ease broken hearts.

THIRD DIVISION
NO-ONE should be unduly excited about a home win over bottom dogs,
Albion Rovers, but Cowdenbeath can be forgiven for feeling just a little
pleased with themselves, and not just because the 2-0 scoreline on
Saturday made them the day's highest scorers in the division.
The victory followed a run of nine straight defeats, a dismal sequence
which began a couple of months ago when they still entertained hope of
being promoted.
In recent weeks, manager Paddy Dolan has had to grin and bear it as
the rub of the green has avoided his team, which has been unsettled ever
since the Scottish Cup defeat at the hands of Highland League Cove
Rangers.
Two Fife players were sent off in that game and suspensions and
injuries have made life difficult for Dolan ever since.
There was no hint of a change of fortune in the early play on
Saturday. Rovers made the running but managed to miss a few chances.
Having weathered the storm, Cowden still had to wait until eight
minutes from time before Ian Black found the net with a shot, and
Scotland's top scorer, Mark Yardley, made sure with another scoring
effort in the final minute.
After their midweek defeat by Montrose, Forfar resumed their march
towards promotion and then the title with a 1-0 home win over
second-placed East Stirlingshire.
David Bingham did the damage in 36 minutes, finishing off after a neat
one-two with Sandy Ross, who had struck the bar earlier in the game.
Forfar are only five points away from assured promotion and victory
over Ross County next week could wrap everything up.
However, County have moved into second place after a 1-0 win at
Arbroath thanks to Alan Duff, who collected a pass and converted in 62
minutes.
Alloa needed a win to stay in the promotion hunt and they achieved it
in Inverness, through Roddy Wylie's early header from a Kenny Hannah
cross.
Caley Thistle's Mike Andrew was sent off just before half-time.

<HEADLINE>Four Bulgarians seek asylum over fears of reprisals for ship strike</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978960674</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FOUR Bulgarian seamen asked for political asylum in Shetland last
night and a fifth was expected to join them as fears grew of reprisals
against the crew of the klondiker Rotalia when they return home this
week after a three-month strike over #137,500 in unpaid wages.
The ship's doctor, Hristo Dimitrov, technician Jordan Jordanov, and
crewmen Dimitar Dimitrov and Georgi Spasov all completed written
statements of their case at the house of a sympathiser in Lerwick.
A Home Office spokeswoman said in London last night that it had not
yet been officially notified of the applications, but each would be
dealt with ''on its merits''.
Northern Isles MP Jim Wallace repeated his ''continuing support'' for
the crew, and said he was willing to make further representations on
their behalf to the Foreign Office.
Faced with the threat of court action to evict them from the ship
after a three-month occupation, the men and their 21 colleagues on board
last week accepted a deal which gave them less than half of the arrears
of wages they claimed.
Included in the out-of-court settlement with Anglo-Bulgarian shipowner
Burgwells Ltd is a free flight home to Bulgaria, but no guarantee that
they will receive the balance of the wage arrears, and no immunity from
prosecution or persecution.
The Bulgarian state fishing company Oceanskiy Ribolov, former owners
of the ship, has already started court action claiming losses of
#156,250 as a result of the men's official strike action -- which was
backed throughout by the International Transport Workers' Federation.
Mr Wallace said the applications for asylum underlined the anxiety
which a number of the crew felt.
''No civilised country should even contemplate taking oppressive
action against workers engaged in a legitimate industrial dispute,'' the
Scottish Liberal-Democrat leader said.
Peter Hamilton, secretary of the Shetland Trades Council, said last
night: ''The only thing that these men hear from Bulgaria is threats.
It's up to the Bulgarian Government to give full and concrete written
assurances to allay their fears. These assurances have been asked for
from all quarters, including the European Parliament.
''In the absence of any assurance, it is natural that the men will
seek asylum.''
The crew's position is that they remain on official strike until they
are paid. It is understood that arrangements were made to pay the 25 men
#56,250 tomorrow , when they were due to leave the ship on a charter
flight to Sofia, but last night it appeared that their departure could
be delayed until later in the week.
During the dispute, the crew has been supported by trades unionists,
church-goers and charities in the islands.

THE Government suffered a further severe blow yesterday, with the
resignation of another junior Minister adding to the Opposition claims
of sleaze.
Mr Richard Spring, 48, tendered his resignation as Parliamentary
Private Secretary to the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew,
after allegations in the News of the World that he was involved in a
''three-in-a-bed'' sex romp.
A statement from the Northern Ireland Office said Sir Patrick had
accepted the resignation ''with great regret''.
Mr Spring, MP for Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, won immediate backing
from his constituency chairman and will probably survive as an MP.
He was divorced two years ago from his wife Janie. They had a son and
daughter.
The News of the World reported the alleged romp which involved a
Sunday school teacher, Ms Odette Nightingale, and her lover Chris
Holmes.
Ms Nightingale, 30, a divorced mother of two, and Mr Holmes, 48, were
said to have had dinner at Mr Spring's house in Victoria, central
London, last Sunday, when the events are alleged to have taken place.
Allegedly she was plied with drink and had sex with Mr Holmes while Mr
Spring was also on the bed.
Mr Holmes, 48, who has been married twice, is a #120,000-a-year
executive at NPI, the pension company.
Lurid and humorous details of what are said to be Mr Spring's private
thoughts on a host of public figures, from politicians to actors and
members of the royal family, were also reported in the newspaper.
Mr Spring, who entered Parliament in 1992 and had a majority of more
than 18,787, appears to have acted on the Prime Minister's edict that in
circumstances such as these members of the Government immediately should
resign.
It has come at an acutely difficult time for Mr Major, who is still
smarting after his party's drubbing in last week's local elections in
Scotland. There are growing signs he could face a leadership challenge
later in the year if the local council results in England and Wales on
May 4 are as bad as they were north of the Border.
Mr Major last week issued a strong plea for party unity, and yesterday
senior Tories moved to quash reports that enough MPs now oppose him to
force a leadership election.
Home Secretary Michael Howard brushed off claims that 33 Tories are
prepared to write to Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the back bench 1922
Committee, calling for a leadership contest.
He stood firmly by the Prime Minister, on the anniversary of the
Tories' 1992 General Election victory, stating on BBC TV's Breakfast
with Frost programme: ''Three years ago today the Prime Minister led us
against all the odds to an election victory that no-one expected us to
win. If it were not for John Major we wouldn't be in Government today.
He won that General Election. I think he's going to take us to victory
in the next General Election too.''
Education Secretary Gillian Shephard is emerging as a possible
leadership contender, though while she might enter the race if Mr Major
resigns, it is almost inconceivable she would stand against the Prime
Minister.
Unease does, however, appear to be growing among Tory back benchers,
many of whom face losing their seats on current opinion poll
predictions.
Mr Major's appeal for party unity in the wake of the Scottish disaster
was openly defied by former Chancellor Norman Lamont, who, at the
weekend, stoked up the row over Europe.
Mr Lamont made a fresh attack on the EU in a speech to the Campaign
for an Independent Britain, criticising the European Parliament as an
''expensive nonsense'' and calling for it to be replaced by an assembly
drawn from national parliaments.

THE new owner of Eigg arrived unexpectedly on his island home
yesterday to an enthusiastic welcome from island representatives.
Lounging on the steps of the Grand Lodge, formerly the home of
unpopular laird Keith Schellenberg, Marlin Eckhard Maruma, a modern art
painter and professor of architecture, said that he had come first to
listen to the opinions of the local people. Then, he added, he would
make investments which he anticipated being around 10 times the purchase
price of the island, which is said to have been #1.6m.
Asked about his investment plans he said he had been aware from the
beginning that there is no point in purchasing a Rolls-Royce if you do
not have enough money for the petrol and had every intention of
investing money in the island.
As indication of his desire to be seen as a man of the people Mr
Maruma's first statement as laird was that on his first visit he did not
want any of the local people to have to come and see him in the lodge
but he would rather go and visit them in their homes to listen to their
opinions.
His subsequent tour of the island in a #700 former forestry minibus
brought about a flurry of spring cleaning in many of the homes of the
island's 75 inhabitants and many words of praise for the new owner.
Mr Maruma said that he had intitially signed letters of intent to
purchase the island from Mr Schellenberg as long ago as last August and
that he suspected that the former laird had been keen to get him to
withdraw from the deal, which was concluded on March 28.
Referring to the ownership of a map of the island which was disputed
last Tuesday, Mr Maruma said: ''The map doesn't belong to me, it belongs
to the island''.
Praising the local people for their ''healthy dislike of injustice''
he said that 20 years of world travel had taught him that his first
priority should be to listen to their views before proceeding to a
shared plan of economic development and then making the concept into a
firm reality.
Mr Maruma said that while he had not finalised anything he would even
be prepared to invest his own funds in the upgrading of the tiny island
pier, the responsibility of Highland region, as he saw improved
transport links with the mainland as being a vital stage in the island's
future development and would not be prepared to wait 10 years for the
Government to improve the pier.
His visit was greeted with initial enthusiasm by island
representatives, including Dr Christoper Tiarks who said: ''My wife and
I were delighted to entertain Mr Maruma to tea. I am sure that he and
his girlfriend are going to be good news for Eigg and I'm sure the
people will co-operate with him on his plans for the island.''
Mrs Marie Carr, the wife of Mr Schellenberg's former farm manager Mr
Colin Carr, who was recently under threat of eviction with her five
children, said: ''Our new owner seems very agreeable and interested
which is more than can be said for somebody else.
''He seems to be a genuine person with the island's interests at
heart.''
Also on the island was Isle of Eigg trustee and opponent of Mr
Schellenberg, Leslie Riddoch, who said: ''I am absolutely staggered at
this complete reversal of behaviour of this laird in contrast to the
last.
''I finally think that there is a light at the end of the tunnel for
this island and am convinced that all of us can work together.''

Rangers 3, Aberdeen 2
IT was difficult not to feel sympathy for Aberdeen at Ibrox on
Saturday as they headed back north on what must have been a long,
miserable journey home after this defeat.
No matter how well they play, according to caretaker boss Roy Aitken,
there is little reward available to them as they fight for survival.
In this game they were outclassed for the first half-hour, went two
goals down and might have been further behind and then staged a recovery
which might have brought them even more of a reward than the two goals
which had the score level at the interval.
However, in the end, Mark Hateley, that hammer of the Dons over the
years, scored a third, Rangers won and Aberdeen were condemned to defeat
and a bottom-of-the-table spot which has them four points behind Dundee
United.
A grim-faced Aitken remarked afterwards: ''This can be a cruel game.
And it has been that for the past three or four weeks. We have played
well enough to get results, but none have gone our way.
''We deserved to take more from the game and a few decisions went
against us, particularly when we had a first half goal chalked off. I
thought we deserved to have gone in at half-time 4-2 up.''
Still, it didn't work out that way, and Aitken was left looking
towards a bleak future with only five games left in which Aberdeen can
find an escape route from relegation.
''We have to take something from our next two games, against Celtic at
Pittodrie and Motherwell at Fir Park. Our whole season could rest on
these matches,'' he stressed.
The remaining three matches are against Hearts at Tynecastle,
fellow-strugglers Dundee United at Pittodrie and finally Falkirk at
Brockville.
There are few easy games there. Still, if Aberdeen can lift their game
as they did against Rangers, then survival could still be possible. It
remains to be seen, however, if the Aberdeen players can perform with as
much commitment in smaller games.
And, surely, there has to be a place in this side for Eoin Jess.
Against Rangers he was brought on just minutes after the Ibrox side went
into a 3-2 lead. Not the best of timing for any player. Jess has skill
and goal-scoring qualities and a team fighting against disaster cannot
afford to leave such a talent withering on the bench.
For Rangers, it was another step nearer the championship. It has been
a strange season for them and this match summed up their many moods of
the long campaign . . .
Superb football in the opening half-hour, when Ian Durrant and
substitute Neil Murray scored and John Brown missed an opportunity from
close range to push them still further in front . . .
Carelessness in the dozen or so minutes before half-time when Billy
Dodds and Duncan Shearer took advantage of mistakes in the Ibrox defence
to level the scores . . .
Scoring power in the second half with the return of Hateley adding
that extra threat and providing the winning goal . . .
And, as always, the dazzling skills of Brian Laudrup to add to the
entertainment for the 44,460 fans.
There was a bonus, too, for the soon-to-be-crowned champions, in a
vintage performance from Trevor Steven, who has missed so much of this
season through injury. It was Steven who was singled out by manager
Walter Smith after the game.
Said the Ibrox manager: ''I thought that Trevor had an excellent game.
''We were disappointed at the goals we lost when Aberdeen came back at
us but we are very pleased to have won.''
The one problem Rangers were left with after the game was yet another
injury blow in a season which has been littered with casualties.
Defender Basile Boli went off early in the match with a disloated
shoulder and that injury could keep the Frenchman out of several of the
remaining League games, including the televised clash with Hibs next
Sunday which, of course, could now be the title-clincher for Rangers.

Falkirk 3, Dundee United 1
MANY locals fidgeted uneasily in their seats before the ball started
bouncing at Brockville, saying little, some with heads resting on chins,
alone with their thoughts and fears.
Of course, the idea of relegation can have that effect on some people
and Falkirk, although with a small cushion from the immediate drop area
in the premier division, could take little for granted, for facing them
on the other side of the field was Dundee United, and Falkirk's record
in matches against the men from Tannadice was lousy.
After 32 minutes of nervy, scrappy play, United striker Sergio Gomes
scored. Arguments between the home supporters were heard, guys blaming
this player and that for some kind of error leading to the opener. The
thought of slipping down the table was almost too much to bear.
Half-time came, heads were shaking and accusing fingers pointed at
zones of the playing surface where incidents had occurred. If only this,
or had he done that. . . Meanwhile, the fans in orange and black sang
their songs.
Strange, then, to listen just an hour later to the Falkirk manager,
Jim Jefferies, actually talking about his lot possibly gaining a place
in a European competition next season. Funny game, football.
But do not go along with the assumption that Jefferies was just
talking his side up for the action which still has to be played out,
perhaps letting this victory go to his head a little. The man actually
believes that Falkirk could take third position in the table come
mid-May, an achievement which has eluded the club before now.
''Motherwell are only four points ahead of us now,'' said the manager,
''and we play them here next Saturday. I thought that if we won today it
was feasible that we could finish in third place in the league, and I'll
tell you this, the way we are playing, it is really possible.''
He's right, of course. Falkirk thoroughly deserved their success --
with goals from Maurice Johnston, his first for the club, Stevie Kirk,
and Colin McDonald -- and are looking a real handful at this time. And
with Motherwell having been turned over by Partick Thistle, well, the
idea of clubs with the stature of Real Madrid or Inter-Milan visiting
Falkirk next season may not appear so daffy as may have been the case
around three bells on Saturday.
But just think of the culture shock, say for the Italians, from the
San Siro stadium to Brockville, it's almost mind-numbing.
However, there will be no such worries for United's people. After
Saturday's gutless showing perhaps they will have to make do with a day
out in Paisley. That'll teach them. United huffed and puffed a lot, but
apart from having to retrieve the ball from his net once, Falkirk keeper
Tony Parkes had a quiet afternoon.
It should have been so very different. A run down the United team
sheet shows that the side have a fair sprinkling of ability in most
departments, the trouble is that they are not displaying their talents.
Gordan Petric, a revelation when he arrived at these shores from
Belgrade, appears now to be reduced to the ranks of mediocrity, and just
what was Maurice Malpas doing at centre half? Billy Kirkwood managed a
smile after the action, but goodness knows why.
''With results elsewhere it gets harder and harder,'' he said. ''The
players know the position they are in. It's a matter of self-belief in
that they can hold on to the results or score goals after they go
behind. There is no magic wand, they just have to get their self-belief
back.''
Even an incident when a Falkirk supporter was a little over-zealous in
returning the ball to Billy McKinlay -- throwing it at him instead of to
him -- was of little concern to Kirkwood. ''Nothing to do with me. I've
got enough problems.'' And good luck sorting them out, Billy, you may
need it.

ISLAMIC suicide car bombers killed seven Israelis and wounded about 45
in two attacks yesterday near Jewish settlements in PLO-ruled Gaza.
Islamic Jihad said that one of its members crashed a car full of
explosives into a bus carrying soldiers and settlers near Kfar Darom, a
settlement beside the main highway south of Gaza city.
Security sources said the blast killed six and wounded about 40, seven
of them critically.
Another militant Muslim group, Hamas, said a member of its Qassam
military wing ran his explosives-laden car into an Israeli convoy at the
nearby settlement of Netzarim.
At least one Israeli was killed and several wounded in that attack,
Israeli sources said.
Both groups said the attacks were in part to avenge the bombing death
of six Hamas members in Gaza a week ago. Islamic Jihad made the claim in
a leaflet; Hamas in a telephone call to a news agency. The Hamas caller
said the attacks were not co-ordinated.
Palestinian police acted immediately against Islamic militants. Night
patrols detained more than 100 suspected Hamas and Islamic Jihad
activists.
In one Hamas stronghold police exchanged fire with gunmen before
arresting two of them.
''We have information that there are orders issued from abroad to
escalate military attacks in this period of time in order to wreck the
peace process,'' said Tayeb Abdel Rahim, general-secretary of Arafat's
Palestinian self-rule Authority.
PLO leader Yasser Arafat, who rules most of Gaza under the peace deal
with Israel, is under pressure from Israel to stop suicide bombings
which have killed more than 60 Israelis over the past year. He condemned
the bombings as a ''terrorist operation'' by the ''enemies of peace''.
US President Bill Clinton said they should not be allowed to deter
efforts to achieve peace in the region.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin toured the bus bomb site as experts were
still blowing up suspicious objects. He said the attacks justified the
closure of the Gaza Strip, which has kept thousands of workers away from
jobs in Israel.
He condemned the two Islamic groups, which oppose the peace process,
but said Israel would not stop talking to the PLO on extending self-rule
in the West Bank.
The Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, claiming responsibility for the bus
attack, said it was carried out by Khaled Mahmoud Khatib, 24, in
reprisal for the explosion which killed six militants last week and
which was blamed on Israel.
''Our heroes carried out the attack to retaliate for the Sheikh Radwan
massacre,'' said a statement.
Hamas sources, who demanded anonymity, confirmed an Israel Radio
report that the organisation's military wing, Izzedine al-Qassam,
carried out the second attack on the convoy, also in retaliation for
last week's explosion in which a leader of al-Qassam was killed.
The attacks will increase pressure on Mr Arafat to crack down on the
Islamists who have vowed to wreck the accord. Israel has made improved
security a condition of further implementation of self-rule.
Palestinians and Israeli left wingers have called for the removal of
all 4000 settlers from Gaza, which has been run by Arafat's PLO for
nearly a year.
Both Kfar Darom and Netzarim are isolated enclaves, north of the main
settlements which are fenced off in a block in the south of the strip.
At least 66 Israeli soldiers and civilians have died since Hamas and
Islamic Jihad switched to suicide bombings in April last year. Israel
has responded by sealing its borders with the Gaza Strip and the
still-occupied West Bank, causing economic hardship to Palestinians.
In all, 209 Palestinians and 123 Israelis have been killed since the
September 1993 Palestinian self-rule deal with Israel.
* Muslim guerrillas ambushed a patrol of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army in south Lebanon yesterday, killing four militiamen,
pro-Israeli security sources said.
The men died when a Sagger anti-tank missile hit a SLA armoured
personnel carrier near the southern town of Jezzine.

Stranraer 0, Dunfermline 1
STRANRAER manager Alex McAnespie's comment at the end of the day was
straight to the point: ''The difference was just the bounce of a ball.''
That might have been a fair summary as far as goals scored went, but
over the piece Dunfermline showed there was a wide difference in skills
and a yawning gap between top and bottom of the division.
The best that can be said of Stranraer was that they stuck to their
manager's policy of containment with a well-drilled defence, and it
certainly was a bad bounce that gave Dunfermline their winner.
Stranraer, now fast approaching the edge of the downward slope, have
suffered from a lack of scoring talent and this was evident again. With
only one goal needed in the second half to win a valuable share of the
points, all that the Blues had to show was a solitary Tommy Sloan header
from close range, which Van de Kamp turned over.
That and a quick dash out of his charge to clash with Tommy Walker
after only 10 minutes of the game summed up the visiting keeper's
afternoon. He was fortunate that the first-half incident did not lead to
a penalty, but Stranraer's pleas were as half-hearted as their ideas on
attack and referee Waddell waved them aside.
The visitors, with the prospect of promotion in their sights, showed a
clearer commitment and an ability to control the game that could not
easily be brushed aside.
Where Dunfermline fell down was translating these qualities into
on-target attempts, and home keeper Barney Duffy had almost as much
leisure time as his opposite number.
With more than three-quarters of possession, the visitors failed
dismally to find their way in and around a tight home defence.
Dunfermline tried every which way, down the wings and through the
middle, and Greg Shaw will look back with dismay on more than a handful
of powerful headers that were all off target.
However, the Pars broke the deadlock in 28 minutes. Stewart Petrie's
low cross into the home box reared up awkwardly, and while Craig
Robertson managed to get the vital touch, his half-hit effort again
bounced badly and high over the committed 'keeper into the net.
The visitors' best chance of adding to their slender lead came two
minutes from time when keeper Duffy was judged to have scooped up a
pass-back on the six-yard line.
In the resulting chaos of a packed goalmouth, Stranraer's Paul McLean
was booked for stepping forward to block Marc Millar's first attempt.
Then the Dunfermline man's second try came crashing back out off the
home defensive line-up -- the story of a frustrating afternoon.

Raith Rovers 2, St Mirren 1
JIMMY Bone remained in jovial mood even after a defeat which assures
the continuation of his team's struggle to avoid relegation.
''Where's the Blarney Stone then,'' asked the St Mirren manager as he
undertook a mock search of Jimmy Nicholl's Stark's Park office for the
mysterious Irish talisman.
Bone clearly felt that Raith had been afforded more than their fair
share of good fortune as they inflicted a 2-1 defeat on the Paisley men,
a result which has propelled Rovers to the top of the first division,
and on course for a remarkable double, with the Coca-Cola Cup already
sitting proudly on the Stark's Park sideboard.
''I'm disappointed to have taken nothing from this game,'' said Bone,
''especially after having taken the lead. To be honest, we should have
buried them in the first half hour.''
The opening goal, in 24 minutes, was a superb individual effort by
Saints' Under-21 international striker Barry Lavety.
Collecting the ball 40 yards out after Shaun Dennis had failed to
clear a long kick-out from Campbell Money, Lavety strode purposefully
forward before unleashing a venomous shot which flew high into the net
from the edge of the penalty area.
''It was a great goal,'' acknowledged Bone, ''but Lavety did very
little else during the game.''
That comment did appear a little harsh, but is probably a mere
component in the engine of managerial psychology, designed to ensure
that the feet of a supremely-talented 20-year-old remain on terra firma.
Raith supporters remain mystified as to why Jimmy Nicholl persists in
denying top scorer Gordon Dalziel a place in the side, but his team
selection was fully vindicated thanks to a two-goal performance from
Colin Cameron.
Cameron cancelled out Lavety's opener in 35 minutes when he netted
from close range after Ally Graham had nodded down a long throw from
Stephen McAnespie, and he recorded his second three minutes later,
cutting inside from the left before driving a low shot home via a post.
While Raith now have the first division championship in their sights,
St Mirren continue to hover on the fringe of the relegation zone, a fact
which does not appear to be having too much of an adverse effect on
Jimmy Bone's confidence.
''We won't go down,'' he announced defiantly. ''The resources at this
club are too strong to allow that to happen.''
With a mere five league games remaining, Paisley fans will be hoping
such optimism is justified.

THE deep chasm that separates agony and ecstasy was never more
apparent than at Hampden when the final whistle sounded on the Scottish
Cup semi-final between Airdrie and Hearts.
Tears of joy and sadness flowed on the touchline as manager Alex
MacDonald led his Airdrie heroes in a victory dance following their 1-0
win, while the dejection on the faces of the Edinburgh contingent echoed
that of their leader Tommy McLean who turned away in despair.
The tension of the occasion had been immense throughout. Perhaps it
was that very tension that got to Airdrie's Kenny Black midway through
the second half. He is a seasoned campaigner, but it is possible nerves
got the better of him when he kicked the ball away and earned himself a
caution.
The midfield player now faces a four-game suspension, but will be
clear in time to play in the cup final against the winners of tomorrow
night's replay between Celtic and Hibernian at Ibrox.
Black's timing couldn't have been more perfect. With six league
matches left and only one booking away from a suspension, an error or a
rash tackle in any of these matches would have prevented Black from
playing in the final on May 27.
That was a prospect too dreadful to live with, and Black's act of
folly on Saturday turns out now to be a blessing in disguise.
Black and Airdrie's captain Jimmy Sandison missed the cup final three
years ago because they were suspended. Watching their team lose 2-1 to
Rangers was their most agonising experience. Neither wants to suffer
like that again and Black's booking means he won't, although Sandison
may be one more yellow card away from another ban.
Airdrie's chairman George Peat will this morning seek clarification on
the number of disciplinary points beside Sandison's name, but whatever
happens the captain will not be foolish enough to risk sanction in the
remaining league matches. He is desperate to play in the final.
''I sat watching last time and remember thinking my last chance to
play in a Scottish Cup final had gone,'' he said. ''I'm touching 30 and
I don't intend missing out this time.''
Black has made sure indiscipline won't keep him idle on cup final day.
After he plays against Clydebank tomorrow and Raith Rovers on Saturday
he'll stand down and concentrate on the final.
The former Rangers, Portsmouth, and Hearts player believes much of the
credit for the club's success in cup competitions belongs to manager
Alex MacDonald, whose team also beat Hearts in the cup semi-final three
years ago.
''Again he has come back to haunt them,'' he said, ''and when you look
at Hearts' situation now you have to think what he might have done for
them. Alex isn't one to blow his own trumpet but it is time someone
stood up and said what has to be said. You have to wonder about the
wisdom of getting rid of him.''
MacDonald, of course, was sacked by Hearts five years ago to make way
for Joe Jordan.
Saturday's match struck another powerful blow for the first division.
Raith Rovers beat Celtic in the final of the Coca-Cola Cup to secure a
place in European competition next season and now Airdrie are only one
game away from reaching the European Cup-winners' Cup.
Their presence in that competition would strengthen the argument that
the premier division should be extended to accommodate the more
ambitious clubs from the first division.
The Diamonds would probably prefer to play Hibs in the cup final
because they believe they have a psychological edge on teams from
Edinburgh. Airdrie have already beaten the Easter Road side in the
Coca-Cola Cup this season.
Sandison, also a former Hearts player, took time out to offer sympathy
to John Robertson who was ordered off near the end of the semi after an
exchange with Airdrie substitute Anthony Smith, yet another former
Tynecastle player.
It appeared as though Robertson had used an elbow on Smith and
Sandison said: ''I'm not sure what happened, but I heard a slapping
sound. However, John isn't a dirty player and I can't see him lifting
his hands.''
Airdrie's goalkeeper John Martin is another of the game's unsung
heroes who is worthy of a major honour and he feels this could be his
year. ''If you come home I'll show you that I've got Hearts on my
mantelpiece now,'' he said before dismissing those who still say Airdrie
are a rough team.
''Some folk still say we are a team of cloggers and I have to laugh at
that.''
The chances are Martin might just be in a position to have the last
laugh at the end of the season.

A FAN died yesterday and a second was seriously injured after fighting
erupted between rival supporters before the FA Cup semi-final between
Crystal Palace and Manchester United.
West Midlands police said the man, thought to be a Crystal Palace fan,
was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital.
The brawl happened in the car park of a public house in Walsall, a few
miles from the Villa Park stadium in Birmingham.
Police and ambulances were called to the scene just after 3pm, less
than an hour before the match kicked off. They found the dead fan and a
badly injured second man, also thought to be a Palace fan
Both were taken to Walsall Manor Hospital with two others who had less
serious injuries.
A police spokeswoman said there were no immediate arrests. Several
Palace fans were being interviewed at Walsall police station, where an
incident room was set up.
Police were first alerted to the fighting by calls from the pub, the
New Fullbrook.
The threat of trouble at the game was heightened by an incident in
January when United striker Eric Cantona launched a kung fu-style attack
on a Crystal Palace fan after being sent off at the club's Selhurst Park
stadium in south London.

BEN Crenshaw, who won the title at his thirteenth attempt in 1984,
yesterday again won the Masters tournament in his twenty-fourth
successive appearance at the Augusta National Club. He took the coveted
green jacket and first prize of $396,000 by a stroke with a final round
of 68 for a total of 274, 14 under par.
In his moment of victory Crenshaw was emotionally drained, for only on
Wednesday he, and Tom Kite, had been pall-bearers at the funeral of
Harvey Penick. The renowned coach, who was their mentor and friend, had
died aged 90 the previous Sunday.
Davis Love, who had never finished in the first 10 in a major
championship and qualified for this one only by winning the tournment at
New Orleans seven days before, took second place with a score 66, the
lowest of the day, a stroke ahead of Jay Haas and Greg Norman, who again
was frustrated of victory by his own hand.
Haas, whose uncle, Bob Goalby, won the title in 1968, saw his hopes of
a double family achievement disappear beneath the water at the fifteenth
and with a bogey at the next.
But with the course in superb condition and colourful array under the
hot sunshine, Crenshaw, in command of his rhythmical swing and that
enviably measured putting stroke, was not to be denied this tribute
victory.
Crenshaw was playing four holes behind Love, who reached the sanctuary
of the clubhouse at 13 under. Having three-putted the short sixteenth,
Love then hit a superb approach at the next to retrieve the stroke and
saved par at the last resolutely after he had hooked even more
comprehensively from the last tee than did Ian Woosnam when he won four
years ago.
Norman, who has now finished seven times in the first six, including
twice as runner-up, again played the wrong shot at the wrong time,
pulling his approach to the seventeenth so far left that he had a putt
almost impossible to lay close. Sure enough, he left it eight feet away
and missed to fall back to 11 under.
Meanwhile, Crenshaw appeared to have made sure of his second triumph
with two marvellous iron shots and holing out putts at the short
sixteenth and at the next for birdies. Now, with two strokes in hand,
Crenshaw could afford to drop a stroke at the eighteenth when he missed
the green from a perfect drive.
Colin Montgomerie broke 70 for only the second time in 14 attempts and
his 69 gave him an aggregate of 285, three under par, and his lowest
total in three appearances. He also finished comfortably among the top
24, who are given automatic places in the Masters next year.
However, he said afterwards: ''I've never felt so frustrated over a
whole week, but I won't be afraid to win if I can get into position.''
Montgomerie, Europe's leading golfer for the past two years,
continued: ''I didn't perform to my abilities and that was a pity,
coming into a major championship playing well. I'm happy with my new
clubs, but my putting stroke just isn't right. You can't lose this
tournament from the tee, but you can on the greens.
''Perhaps next year I'll confine my practice to the greens,''
Montgomerie added after he had worked out that he had missed eight
birdie putts from between five and 12 feet over the first 11 holes. He
double bogeyed the fourteenth, putting from the fringe to three feet and
missing twice from that distance, but the last four holes came as
compensation.
Having chipped two feet to birdie the fifteenth, he holed from 15 feet
for further birdies at the next two holes and then at the last, where
his approach ran back off the green and he chipped 20 feet past, he
holed again, to save par. Montgomerie summed up: ''It's taken a lot out
of me just to reach three under.''
Montgomerie could take belated satisfaction from having had the lowest
last score by any of the seven European professional survivors, although
his total was one more than that of the holder, Jose-Maria Olazabal, and
the same as another former champion, Ian Woosnam. But otherwise the
group showed little inspiration.
Only seven scores below 70 among them in the most inviting conditions
for a long time were not nearly enough to make credible the pursuit of a
seventh title for a European player in eight years. David Gilford, who
in his first Masters actually shared the lead after 27 holes, made a
creditable finish at two under.
But Nick Faldo, the pre-tournament favourite, Bernhard Langer, and
Severiano Ballesteros, all winners of this title twice, could do no
better than scores of three over par. Faldo, who with a really low score
might have influenced the outcome, instead began with a double bogey 6
which brought sudden death to that notion.
On his thirty-eighth birthday, Ballesteros' total of 296 was his
highest in 19 of these championships and left him sharing last but one
place with John Daly, doubtless more accustomed to such a lowly station.
Moreover, Ballesteros, like Jack Nicklaus on Saturday, suffered the mild
indignity of having to start first with a marker.
