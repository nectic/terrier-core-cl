THE British Athletic Federation is not prepared to break the bank to
settle their pay dispute with Linford Christie over running at domestic
meetings.
''We don't have a bottomless barrel,'' federation spokesman Tony Ward
said yesterday. ''Negotiations are continuing and we hope an amicable
agreement can be reached.
''The feeling is that there has to be a conclusion pretty soon. But it
will not be an any price.
''There has to be budgetary considerations. We cannot have the
situation that occurred in the mid-1980s, when the former British Board
almost went bankrupt.''
Christie is reputed to have asked for an increase from #36,000 to
#50,000 per meeting. He says the federation want him to take a pay cut.
Now, along with fellow rebels Colin Jackson and John Regis, he has
already been ruled out of Sunday's BUPA Games at Gateshead. And he could
miss the entire season -- which he insists will be his last before
retiring.
The British captain may be seen only once more here, at next month's
world championship trials in Birmingham, where all athletes must compete
to win selection for Gothenburg.
Commonwealth champion Rob Denmark, who runs in Sunday's 5000 metres,
said: ''The sport needs its top stars and, hopefully, the situation can
be sorted out.''
0 Roger Black, who anchored Britain to a 4X400m victory which secured
the European Cup runners-up spot last weekend, has pulled out with a
knee injury.
But organisers are banking on triple jumping's man-of-the-moment,
Jonathan Edwards, to bring in the crowds at his home stadium. So far,
6000 tickets have been sold.

IT might not seem a long time, but 79 minutes includes overtime if you
are Steffi Graf with a bad back, and the five times Wimbledon champion,
who had to pull out of the doubles competition because she fears her
injury might flair up by playing too many shots, would have appreciated
a much easier time than she was given yesterday by Amanda Coetzer,
writes James Traynor.
Graf eventually won 6-3, 7-5 on Centre Court, but she was not always
convincing in the second set.
Her serve was off line in that set, and later she admitted there had
been times in the match when she was concerned about her back.
The German woman has a back spur which can only be corrected by
surgery which she is reluctant to have until she stops playing, and that
must now be sooner rather than later.
Wonderfully gifted player that she is, she cannot continue to perform
at the highest level while fretting over injury. The deeper she plays
her way into a Grand Slam event like Wimbledon, the more she will have
to be focused on hitting the balls, otherwise she will end up playing
like the Couriers and Edbergs of this world.
Both of these players were dumped from the tournament yesterday
because their minds were not fully on their jobs.
''I didn't feel too great after my first-round match the other day,
and in the evening I was worse,'' said Graf. ''My back didn't bother me
today, but I keep waiting for something to go wrong, and maybe my
concentration is affected.''
She is rarely given any warning as to when she will be pained -- ''it
just comes and goes'' -- and although she says she will be able to stay
around here for as long as it takes to regain the title, she can't be
absolutely certain the injury won't strike and restrict her movement.
It would be a great pity if she had to pull out because of her
problem, but from here on in the going can become extremely tough.
The career of Jo Durie ended in defeat yesterday when Britain's
favourite tennis girl was beaten 6-2, 6-2 by the fourth seed, Jana
Novotna, but there were no tears from the 34-year-old. ''I loved every
minute of it and I just feel a sense of joy,'' she said after she had
packed up her kit back and left Court No.1 for the last time.
On her way into retirement on weary legs she stopped to hug her coach,
Alan Jones, -- ''we've been through a lot together over the years,'' she
said -- who looked much more emotional than Durie. ''Although it was two
and two, the match was harder than that and I am glad that I put on a
decent performance in my final match,'' she added.
At her peak Durie was ranked as high as No.5 in the world for a brief
spell, and it will be some considerable time before another British
woman reaches those heady heights.
The womens' sixteenth seed, Helena Sukova, was beaten 6-4, 4-6, 4-6 by
Japan's Yone Kamio, while Lindsay Davenport ploughed on from her
No.7-seed berth with a routine win over Argentina's Florencia Labat, but
a younger American Lindsay just failed to land an upset.
Lindsay Lee, 17, was 5-1 up against No.10 seed Natasha Zvereva and won
the first-set tie-break, but woman from Belarus, more noted as a doubles
player, found her form in time for a comeback win.

MICHAEL Chang ran out of steam last night when he became the fourth
seed in the men's draw to be shown the Wimbledon door, and it was a
measure of the esteem in which the 23-year-old American is held that
even when he went two sets down to the underrated Petr Korda, the Centre
Court audience settled down for a five-setter.
In the past Chang, seeded No.5, could always be relied upon to provide
excitement and entertainment, but this time he offered nothing other
than a troubled and pained look.
The normally athletic 23-year-old took his leave quietly and
sluggishly. It was most uncharacteristic, but he simply had no answer to
the power, control, accuracy, and range of shots produced by his
opponent.
Korda, ranked fifty-six in the world, put his success in yesterday's
second round down to a stronger attitude and greater commitment. ''In
the past I didn't always train hard enough, but that has changed,'' he
said.
To find the reason why he was looking like a born-again player it is
necessary to look in the direction of Tony Pickard, who twice coached
Stefan Edberg to the Wimbledon title.
The pair have gone their own ways recently, but Pickard, who applauded
Korda enthusiastically, is back in business.
''I have put in a lot of work to get to this form, and tomorrow I will
start working harder again,'' said Korda, whose is entitled to believe
he could make it through to the quarter-finals where he should meet
Boris Becker.
Tim Henman was back on court yesterday, but it was only to apologise
for dangerous play and accept the full brunt of his punishment for
having misbehaved on the hallowed turf.
The All England Lawn Tennis Club fined the 20-year-old British player
a total of $3000 (#2000) even though the ballgirl, who was hit on the
side of her head when Henman fired a ball in temper the other evening,
said she forgave him.
In fact, 16-year-old Caroline Hall and Henman returned to court
yesterday afternoon together, and the British No.3 presented the
schoolgirl, who has fully recovered from her trauma, with a bouquet.
Nevertheless, the authorities felt they could not ignore their own
rules and had to impose a fine of $2000 (#1300), for having defaulted
the player, and $1000 (#670), for his offence.
Henman won #8940 for having reached the second round here and his
fine, which will be donated to the Grand Slam Development Fund, will be
deducted from his earnings. However, having to live with the stigma of
being the first player disqualified from the Championships in the modern
era will be much harder to bear. Henman is actually a decent young man
and his offence was not deliberate.
The Oxford player teamed up with Jeremy Bates in a doubles match
against Jeff Tarango and Henrik Holm, and were doing rather well. They
were leading 7-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-6 (2-1) when a net cord deceived Henman,
who then smacked the ball over the net and was horrified to see his shot
hit Caroline.
She was led off court in tears, but was able to return yesterday and
accept Henman's floral apology.
Umpire Wayne McKewen said that under the rules he had no choice but to
disqualify Henman and his partner from the tournament, and a statement
from referee Alan Mills' office said: ''The rules state that a player
must be in control of his actions on court, and in such cases there is
no choice but to default automatically on the basis of unsportsmanlike
conduct.
''Tim Henman is extremely upset about this freak accident, but default
was the only course of action.''
Harsh as their punitive action may seem -- the crowd jeered the
disqualification -- Wimbledon's authorities took the correct stance. The
image of sport has been tarnished in recent years with more and more of
the main players believing they are able to move beyond the bounds of
civilised behaviour.
There was a second-set hitch, but Becker summoned up enough power and
aggression to see off a troublesome Swede, Jan Apell, who performed well
on Court No.1 yesterday but could not deliver the necessary quota of big
shots. Like so many who come to Wimbledon he flattered to deceive and
was left behind when Becker cranked up his right arm and started firing
the kind of shots which have earned him approximately #20m.
With this kind of wealth behind him he doesn't get up in the morning
to make money. Becker rises because he wants to win championships. ''I
lost my concentration in the second set,'' said the German, ''but I
moved into fifth gear with my service and everything was fine.''
Agassi returned with his grunge look to Centre Court where he dallied
just long enough to bow to the visiting royals, wave to his girlfriend,
Brooke Shields, who sat under a straw hat, and whack his buddy, Patrick
McEnroe, 6-1, 6-1, 6-3.
''Sure he's my friend,'' the former champion said. ''We've been out to
dinner a few times while on the road, but business is business.''
The majestically powerful play of Agassi teased gasps from the crowd
which included a number of fans who were wearing their knotted hankies
and false goatees.
Somehow they just didn't look that part, beer bellies are something
Nike have not designed yet for their marketing tool, Agassi, who changes
female superstars as often as his garb -- last year Barbra Streisand was
in tow.
He qas quizzed by the tabloids about his relationship with Miss
Shields. They wear matching rings and someone asked if wedding bells
would soon be ringing. ''Steady, I think we're all getting carried away
a bit,'' said Agassi.
He has a tennis tournament to win first and admitted: ''If I can get
beyond David Wheaton, who does everything well, then I think I could say
I was in a position to win the title.''
Edberg, champion in 1988 and '90, was dismissed in the second round
for the second successive year, and was unable to say what has gone
wrong with his game which used to be pretty slick on grass. Yesterday,
the No.13 seed lost to a player who had even the veterans of Grand Slam
reporting leafing through their players' lists.
Dick Norman had to be a pretty poor player because if he had done
anything of any significance in the sport, he would have been noticed.
After all, he stands 6ft 8in. and could hardly be missed.
''He's like a giant,'' Edberg said after he had recovered from his
6-3, 6-4, 6-4 defeat on Court 14. ''I felt like it was David and Goliath
out there. All he had to do was hit the ball, walk into the net, and I
felt he was all over me.''
The No.11 seed, Jim Courier, runner-up two years ago, was beaten in
straight sets by Cedric Pioline, of France, and like Edberg couldn't
quite put his finger on what has gone wrong with his game. ''Can't say,
but if you know the answer I'd be glad to hear,'' he said.
Mats Wilander wasn't short of fighting spirit on Court 13, where he
lost the first two sets 4-6, 5-7 to Marc Goellner before deciding it was
time to put the German upstart in his place.
Wilander, a former world No.1 who has slipped to No.101 because at 30,
he prefers to listen to music and take it easy, took the next three sets
6-3, 7-5, 6-4 and wandered off to have a beer.

MUNWAR will run in Sunday's Budweiser Irish Derby at The Curragh.
Owner Sheikh Hamdan Al-Maktoum gave the go ahead after having approved a
change of programme for his Lingfield Derby Trial winner with trainer
Peter Walwyn.
The colt finished a disappointing ninth in the Epsom Derby but
connections had a re-think when Lammtarra was ruled out by injury.
''When we learned of Lammtarra's setback, and with the ground in his
favour, we decided to leave Munwar in the race,'' said Walwyn. ''He is
very well.''
This evening, jockey Paul Fessey can gain the biggest success of his
career so far by partnering White Sorrel to victory in the Gosforth Park
Cup at Newcastle.
White Sorrel has been lightly-raced and has improvement in the tank.

NOSTALGIA oozed freely from a marquee tucked away in a corner of
Wimbledon yesterday when former champion Chris Evert put in an
appearance. Although away from the circuit for five years, she held
court with all the composure of old, nodding and smiling to familiar
faces and remembering certain of the hacks who had given her a hard time
when she first arrived as a teenager all those years ago.
Actually, it was 24 years ago when she first walked through the famous
gates, and there she was yesterday, now a mother of two, who takes pride
in her family rather than tennis, which she said is no longer played
with enough of a smile.
''It's a very serious business,'' she said. ''They are all athletes
and their sport has become so big in the last 15 years, with
endorsements and television deals, but all sport is becoming like that.
Do you ever see Michael Jordan smiling when he is at work?''
Evert, who was one of the most graceful champions in the game's
history, has perhaps a few more wrinkles when she smiles, which she does
often these days. ''I remember playing here when I was 17 and some of
you people dubbed me the 'Little Miss Ice Maiden,' but that's okay. I
can see, now that I work sometimes with NBC, that you have a job to do.
I can see it from the media's side and I just wish that more of the top
players today would give more interviews and try to promote the sport.''
Evert, 40, was speaking on the day it was announced she is to be
inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode
Island, on July 16, when former US President George Bush will conduct
proceedings. For the first time one person, Evert, will stand alone as
the only 1995 inductee and she will have an entire gallery dedicated to
her exploits. ''They came and boxed up half my house to put in that
place,'' she said.
The Evert gallery will tell the story of her 157 professional titles,
which included 18 grand-slam championships. ''There were also a lot of
losses, especially to Martina (Navratilova),'' she said.
Nevertheless, she was ranked No.1 in the world eight times and her
record of 125 successive wins on clay endures as the longest winning
streak of any player for a single surface. ''You know, this is really
strange being here today and talking about a part of my life which has
gone,'' she added.
''You all know I live in the present and to be talking now about a
part of my life which is closed and gone is bringing memories and
emotions flooding back. I'm a mother now and when I had to get up twice
a night to breast-feed babies, I thought: 'Now my priorities are right.'
''There was more pressure when I was a tennis player, because at the
end of every day I was either a winner or a loser. If I lost, sometimes
I would shut myself in my room for three days but, having children now,
I realise there is more to life.
''If I miss anything about tennis, though, it's not going out and
putting everything, physically and mentally, on the line. Tennis players
call it being in the zone, and it doesn't happen all the time, but it
was a feeling worth waiting for.''
Evert, who won the first of her Wimbledon singles crowns in 1974, when
she beat Olga Morozova, also lost in seven finals, but she remembers
that first triumph more vividly than any other. ''That year was like a
fairytale,'' she said. ''I was here with Jimmy, we were engaged, and we
both just sort of flowed through the tournament, with him winning the
men's title. It was all so romantic.''
The affair with Connors ended, however, and Evert married Britain's
John Lloyd, a union which won her a place in the hearts of the English,
who claimed as an adopted daughter of the realm. They were eventually
divorced and Evert re-married, to former Olympic skier Andy Mill, to
whom she has two sons, three-year-old Alexander and Nicholas, who is
one.
''Now I feel like a genuine member of the human race, because when you
are a superstar of a champion, you are most certainly not. It's another
life,'' she said. ''It's very demanding, but I think the players have to
make more of an effort to accommodate the people who support them and
who write about them.
''Also, tennis today needs more rivalries and it might help if some of
the players were to socialise a little more. For instance, we have never
once been able to get Steffi (Graf) to come to one of the Women's Tennis
Association meetings.''
And her tip for the women's crown? ''Steffi, if her back holds up. She
has all the weapons.''
Yes, indeed, but neither Graf nor any of the others has Chrissy's
class, do they?

ANNBANK'S Sarah Gourlay and Janice Maxwell, from Castle Douglas, the
only two previous winners through to the final stages of the Scottish
women's association singles championship, survived yesterday's opening
matches at a sun-drenched Northfield complex in Ayr.

MIDDLESEX batsman Mark Ramprakash fired a reminder to England's
selectors with a magnificent 185 not out on the opening day of the
Britannic Assurance County Championship clash with Surrey at Lord's.
Ramprakash, desperate for a big innings after having bagged a pair in
the second Test against West Indies, hit 32 boundaries as the home side
reached 356-4.
Yorkshire were thankful for the efforts of Australian Michael Bevan
and David Byas against Gloucestershire at Middlesbrough. Bevan hit 102
and Byas made 108, sharing a third-wicket stand of 190, after Yorkshire
had been 29-2.
Javagal Srinath tilted the balance Gloucester's way once again,
finishing with 6-63 as Yorkshire lost their last seven wickets for 75 to
finish on 340.
Basement boys Derbyshire bowled out Hampshire for 284 despite spilling
six catches. Phillip DeFreitas (3-60) and Devon Malcolm (2-58) both gave
the England selectors a nudge in the absence of rested all-rounder
Dominic Cork.
Nasser Hussain teamed up with Australian Test ace Mark Waugh to rescue
Essex after they lost their first two wickets for just two runs --
including Graham Gooch for a duck -- against champions Warwickshire at
Ilford.
Hussain hit 94 and Waugh 80 as they shared a third-wicket stand of
152, before Ronnie Irani (53no) and Paul Prichard (40) carried on the
good work as Essex closed on 318-9.
Former England pair Hugh Morris and Matthew Maynard were in the runs
at Swansea, where Glamorgan compiled 310-8 against Durham. Opener Morris
hit 106 and Maynard 59, sharing in a third-wicket stand of 103. Tony
Cottey made a fluent 60, combining with Morris in a fourth-wicket stand
of 112. Scores:
At Derby. Hampshire 284 (J P Stephenson 93); Derbyshire 14-0.

SHOTTS Bon Accord have been expelled from the Central League. The
decision was made by the Region's Junior FA after a long dispute with
the club.
The penalty came when the region challenged the validity of medical
certificates submitted by Bon Accord for eight players as the reason for
calling off an MBM Cup tie with Thorniewood United at Hogmanay.
Bon Accord president, Gavin Pettigrew, said: ''We are bitterly
disappointed at the expulsion but intend to lodge an appeal.''

BERNARD Gallacher, Europe's Ryder Cup captain, yesterday sent out a
confident call to the troops who will do battle at Oak Hill in September
in the match against the United States. ''They are in the ascendancy
now, with Ben Crenshaw and Corey Pavin winning the Masters and the US
Open, but I know how quickly fortunes can turn round,'' he said.
Gallacher, who was in St Andrews to open officially the new #3m
clubhouse adjacent to the first tees of the New and Jubilee courses,
added: ''We are not playing the Ryder Cup now, and I am very optimistic
Europeans will do well in the Open Championship here in three weeks'
time. I am confident their performances will act as a springboard
towards the team's success.''
Of the new building, Sir Peter Bairsto, chairman of the St Andrews
Links Trust, said: ''The sight of golfers changing in car parks has been
safely consigned to history.''

RAYMOND Burns played the round of his life yesterday at the BMW
International Open in Germany, thanks to a little bit of home-spun
philosophy. The 21-year-old from Banbridge, Co Down, spends much of his
time in London when he is not busy on the European Tour, but now he
intends curtailing his visits to the Capital after a trip to Ireland
brought a change in luck.
Burns shot a seven-under-par 65 at the picturesque St Eurach course in
the Bavarian foothills near Munich that brought him a share of the
first-round lead with his playing partner, Sweden's Mats Hallberg. The
talented duo delighted the crowds and Burns' round was fashioned after a
game with his pals back home in Dundalk.
He said: ''I just hit a few balls with a few friends. I had prepared
badly for the event in Jersey beforehand and felt like a change. I
intend to go back to Ireland more often. On the Tour you can get
distracted so easily by a number of things and it is good to get away
occasionally.''
Hallberg took the honours on the front nine, going out in 33. But
Burns came home in a blistering 31, including a spectacular birdie 3 on
the last. Burns sent a No.6-iron shot from 162 yards to within three
inches of the pin for his seventh birdie of the day.
He won the Challenge Tour last season, but has missed seven cuts since
moving up to golf's answer to the Premiership. He admitted: ''My target
is to finish in the top 80 in the order of merit. I feel I have played a
lot better than I did today, but I have shot a lot higher.''
Hallberg has struggled this season and is currently 100th in the
rankings. But he displayed no shortage of confidence yesterday, turning
his pairing with Burns into virtual matchplay.
The pair were left chuckling as the game's big names struggled on a
day when conditions could hardly have been better. Bernhard Langer leads
the order of merit, but that did not stop him coming unstuck and he had
to settle for a 73, one over par.
Defending champion Mark McNulty again showed his liking for the venue,
coming in with a 69 which keeps him in touch with the leaders.
Two shots adrift of Hallberg and Burns are three players -- Australian
Terry Price, Marc Farry of France, and New Zealand's Frank Nobilo.
Scotland's challengers made no impression on the leaderboard, the best
they could muster being the 73s by Dean Robertson and veteran Mike
Miller. Sandy Lyle's much talked about bid to win back his place in the
European Ryder Cup team was not helped by a 75, a score he shared with
Gary Orr.
Shot of the day came from German amateur Florian Bruhns, who recorded
a hole in one at the 198-yard eighth.

HENNESSY CUP
IT was a poor day for Britain's Laura Davies when she returned a 79 in
the opening round of the Hennessy Cup at Refrath, Cologne, yesterday,
writes Bill Johnson.
''It was a horrible start to the day, horrible in the middle, and a
horrible end to the round,'' said Davies, who needed four attempts to
escape from trees on her way to an 8 at the long second.
She finished 14 strokes behind Australian Wendy Doolan, whose
seven-under-par 65 left her two strokes ahead of Jane Geddes, a former
British Open champion, from the USA.
The leader's round, which equalled the course record, is the lowest of
her career. She had eight birdies in a round containing only 24 putts,
including a four footer for birdie which she missed on the last green.
Dale Reid was the best of the Scottish trio when she birdied two of
her closing four holes to come home in 34 for a 71, with Julie Forbes
and Gillian Stewart on 72. Leading first-round scores (GB and Ireland
unless stated):
65 -- W Doolan (Australia).
67 -- J Geddes (USA).
68 -- K Davies, A Sorenstam (Sweden), E Orley (Switzerland).
69 -- S Gronberg (Sweden), A Nicholas, M Hageman (Holland), M-L de

70 -- J Morley, C Dibnah (Australia), T Johnson, R Hetherington
(Australia).
Other scores included:
71 -- D Reid.
72 -- J Forbes, G Stewart.

JOHN Collins, the Celtic midfield player not due back from holiday
until Thursday, continues to be the subject of transfer speculation,
particularly with a move to Middlesbrough, but unless the English club
are prepared to raise the stakes, the move is unlikely to take place.
Middlesbrough's original #2m bid has been supplemented by another
worth #2.25m, but it is understood that this also has been rejected by
Celtic.
Collins has another year of his current contract to go at Parkhead,
but there has been such intense interest in his future, not repudiated
by Celtic, that it may be that if the right offer comes along, the club
would be prepared to let him leave.
The man who cost Celtic #1m when bought from Hibs by manager Billy
McNeill close to five years ago has had a significant season at club and
international level, but if Celtic are specially strong in any
department it is in midfield, where captain Paul McStay, Peter Grant,
and #1.7m buy Phil O'Donnell have been vying for places.
Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson is believed to be especially keen
on capturing Collins for the club's venture into the Premiership next
season, but it seems he has some hard work yet to do before he gets his
man.
Another player in the south hopes that the Celtic fans' amazing track
record in testimonials will continue when his benefit game takes place
on August 1. Welsh international keeper Neville Southall's big day at
Goodison Park will see the Parkhead men turn up to meet Everton, just as
they did for Liverpool's Ian Rush a few months ago, and countless others
beforehand.
Meanwhile, the man expected to be Rangers' next foreign signing,
Florin Raducioiu, has again said that he would not be coming to Glasgow,
even although his Spanish club, Espanol, and Rangers have agreed a fee.
The sides still anticipate the transfer will go though but the delay
at the Spanish end is understood to involve compensation which has
nothing to do with Rangers.
FORMER Arsenal manager George Graham and current Southampton chief
Alan Ball are the favourites to succeed Brian Horton, now installed as
Huddersfield manager, at Maine Road.
Graham, who left Highbury under controversial circumstances in
February, faces an FA inquiry on July 10 into the 'bung' allegations
surrounding John Jensen's 1992 transfer to Arsenal.
It is understood that Manchester City's lawyers are assessing Graham's
case and his chances of escaping a ban.
ALAN Smith, who parted company with Crystal Palace at the end of last
season following their relegation from the Premiership, made a quick
return to management yesterday with second division Wycombe Wanderers.

ENGLAND'S Sue Wright booked a quarter-final date with defending
champion Michelle Martin by defeating Vicki Cardwell yesterday at the
world championships in Hong Kong.
Wright overcame Australia's 40-year-old 1983 world champion 9-7, 9-0,
6-9, 9-8, winning eight points in a row to seal victory after having
fallen 8-1 behind in the fourth game.
But she faces a tough test against Martin, who showed her pedigree
with a straight-games victory over her English namesake, Jane Martin.
Results:
Second round -- M Martin (Australia) beat J Martin (England) 9-4,
10-8, 9-3; S Horner (England) beat R Cooper (Australia) 9-6, 9-5, 9-1; C

IT was success all the way for Scottish crews at the Henley Royal
Regatta yesterday, all three winning in good style.
The St Andrew eight led the way in the morning Thames Cup, beating
Staines after having been down for over half of the course. When they
finally did come through, their opponents crumbled, leaving the Scots to
win by more than a length. St Andrew now face the selected, or seeded,
crew from London in today's racing.
In the Queen Mother Cup, the Castle Semple quad had a tough task
shaking off Favorit Hammonia, of Germany. Off the start, the lead
changed hands between the two crews more than once in the first 500
metres, with the Germans being warned by the race umpire for poor
steering and drifting into the Scots' lane.
Just before the mile mark the Scots finally broke through and moved
ahead, although their German opponents never let up on the pressure.
In the last scheduled race of the day, Drew Hendry and Richard Harris,
of Aberdeen, made short work of a York City pair, winning comfortably
and in control as the crews crossed the line.
Steve Redgrave cruised to victory in the Silver Goblets event with
partner Matthew Pinsent, beating Newcastle schoolboys comfortably in
eight minutes 10 seconds.
But Redgrave, in the most glorious of sunlit evenings, said a
fortnight of ideal tail winds had raised hopes of smashing his own
record for the coxless pairs. The triple Olympic champion said: ''The
forecast was good. Then it all changed round this afternoon.''

ST JUDE CLASSIC
FORMER European Tour member Glen Day, buoyed by a birdie at the
opening hole, moved into a tie for the lead after the opening round at
the $1.25m St Jude Memphis Classic yesterday.
Day, nicknamed ''All Day'' by his fellow pros because of his
reputation as a slow player, took advantage of perfect morning
conditions to join fellow American Mike Standly at nine-under-par 62 on
the defenceless Southwind TPC course.
Day and Standly lead by two shots from fellow American Dennis Paulson,
while 1992 Open runner-up John Cook overcame his late tee-off time to
join a group at six-under 65.
Among the bigger names, Ernie Els shot 67, British Open champion Nick
Price carded 70, while Fuzzy Zoeller withdrew after three holes due to
back spasms. Leading scores (American unless stated):
62 -- G Day, M Standly.
64 -- D Paulson.
65 -- S Simpson, R Mediate, J Williamson, D A Weibring, J Gallagher, B
Tway, J Cook.
* BRAID Hills professional Gary Weir helped his team to victory in the
Paterson Trading Patrons Pro-Am at Cardross yesterday with a combined
four-man score of 55, 16-under-par. Leading scores:
55 -- G Weir (Braid Hills), M Haton, R Paterson, J Shannon. 58 -- L
Vannet (Carnoustie), I Webster, B Cameron, K O'Sullivan; K Hutton
(Downfield), M Riddell, A Moffat, J Daly. 59 -- S Kerr (Renfrew), D

Ross Finlay finds there is more to the Audi A4 than is immediately
apparent
WHILE it seemed a great idea at the time, the fact that the original
UK launch of the Audi A4 included a visit to Prescott hill climb, where
there was a chance to be hurtled up the speed event course in a much
more powerful Audi Avant RS2 by several-times record holder Roy Lane,
may have been counter-productive. The disparity in performance between
the two cars could have been what left some of us feeling rather
underwhelmed by the A4.
Audi is in the process of changing its model designations so that
eventually all of them will be the A-something. There is a lot more than
that to the A4, though, because this replacement for the Audi 80 is a
totally superior car. A recent test session in Scotland, where the
additional versions just added to the A4 range were also available, left
me feeling much more enthusiastic about it.
After driving several different versions of the car in Perthshire, my
impression is that Audi is much more businesslike about the A4 than it
was, in recent years at least, about the 80. While the A4 is a far more
modern car, with many thoughtful elements in its design, its prices are
in several instances down on those latterly charged for the equivalent
80 models. Of course, since there is no A4 estate so far, Audi still
offers the 80 estate.
The A4 is a fine looking car, with Audi's four-linked-rings badge
neatly integrated in the front-end design. The finish is top class, the
body contours are smooth, but this is another compact saloon whose
designers, faced with the inevitable choice between rear passenger space
and boot space, have left it with restricted seat room in the back.
I am surprised that I did not make enough, on that first Prescott-day
report, of Audi's efforts to give the A4 a much more stylish cabin than
the 80. German interiors are often dully presented, but the A4's is a
far more attractive design. Unfortunately, every single A4 suffers from
a weird reflection on the concave instrument shield, which reduces and
enlarges itself as the driver's head moves in sympathy with undulations
on the road.
The A4 sunroof was much more satisfactory than the one in a car I had
been driving just beforehand. That other sunroof simply could not be
kept fully open at anything above town-traffic speed because of the wind
roar it provoked. The Audi felt as if it had been intended to take a
sunroof right from the start of the design process, and could be run
with the roof back at any normal speed.
On more winding roads than the original test route provided, the A4
showed up as noticeably livelier. The new four-link front suspension
derived from the system on the luxury saloon A8, and modifications to
the rear layout handed on from the 80, give it a well-judged handling
balance and enhanced standard of ride. It is a very pleasant car to
drive out on open country roads.
The new 1.8T, with its 150bhp five-valve turbo petrol engine, firmer
ride and peakier performance which offers figures like 0-60mph in eight
seconds and a test track maximum over 135mph, is a #19,370 car which
many Audi fanciers will enjoy. I thought however that, perhaps
unexpectedly, the 1.9-litre TDI SE was the star of the Perthshire show.
Priced at #18,486 in a range which runs from #14,920 to #22,845 for
the 2.6-litre Quattro, this intercooled turbo-diesel is really well
balanced, quiet thanks to Audi's interest in suppressing diesel noise
both by internal engine modifications and by placing an acoustic cover
over the whole engine compartment, and a prime example of how a good
turbo-diesel can offer performance and economy in the same package. A
0-60mph time of 13 seconds, strong mid-range torque, a test track
potential of almost 115mph, and economy figures varying from 72mpg at
56mph to 52 at 75 and 46mpg around town, represent quite some list of
attractions.

MUSIC before Josh McRae was, said Danny Kyle, muck. Well, not muck
exactly, but another word that aptly sums up songs such as I'm A Pink
Toothbrush, You're A Blue Toothbrush. McRae took Kyle and many others
away from that and into a world populated by blues singers, dust bowls,
and cowboys. Especially cowboys.
Onstage alongside Kyle were half a dozen others who knew McRae well. A
show of hands in the audience suggested that they were mostly among
friends. It was that sort of night -- intimate, occasionally ramshackle,
and a bloke in the audience who'd obviously heard of the Glaswegians'
reputation for heckling. Drawing on the cowboy connection, Kyle shot him
down.
When he could get his tongue in sideways Kyle gave us a verbal picture
of the conundrum that was Josh McRae. Two songs, sung back to back by
McRae's daughter Kirsty, illustrated the range of the songs he sang. A
daft wee ditty about the wee ferry boat, HMS Back'n'Forward, was
followed by a letter home from a prisoner on death row set to music by
Pete Seeger.
McRae didn't write many songs. But he could choose them -- for himself
and other people. And not only did he introduce aspiring singers to
Americana, he showed them what their own tradition had to offer, from
the Recruiting Sergeant (an odd choice for a dyed-in-the-wool pacifist)
to the travelling people songs of Jeannie Robertson.
''Wish he'd taken his own advice,'' said Kyle, introducing a song
about the dangers of whisky. A sobering moment, but it was the only one
in a show that paid entertaining and affectionate tribute to a genuine
character.

PASS the Kleenex, mother . . . I went to the Royal SNO's Family
Concert last night out of a sense of duty; heavy heart and all that. By
the end I think I had had more sheer enjoyment than for ages.
First there was Paul Patterson's pastiche-laden setting of Roald
Dahl's Little Red Riding Hood. I've seen this before, but not so
brilliantly staged; and not with the big band giving it laldy. Superb
lighting effects, and hilarious performances by members of Dundee Rep --
Sandy Neilson as the narrator, Isabella Jarrett doubling as the
gin-slinging Grandma and the feisty, pistol-in-her-knickers, wee Hood,
and Sandy West as a thick, shaggy wolf with a distinctly Glaswegian gait
-- enlivened a stunningly effective score.
The second half was schmaltz and enjoyment in medleys from Walt Disney
films -- Snow White and Pinocchio -- with the band tearing into it
(mistakes and all) and conductor Nicholas Cleobury (fresh from the
contemporary cutting edge of the St Magnus Festival) showing a side of
himself I didn't know he possessed: the old softy behaving like a wean
and rabble-rouser. Well done, that man.
And there was split level enjoyment, too, in the arena and behind the
band. Downstairs a posse of girls around seven years old got to their
feet and put on a floor show, marching, swaying, twirling, dancing, and
strutting -- until rotten old mum made them sit down. And above and
behind the band another bunch of kids, mimicking conductor Cleobury,
showed that they had the arcane art of conducting completely sussed --
when in doubt make the beat go in circles. Excellent night. Where did I
park my balloon?

FORMER Paul McCartney accomplice Laurence Juber, currently serving as
Al Stewart's musical and production sidekick, set the tone for last
night's show with a virtuoso, liltingly romantic set of acoustic guitar
dexterity. If it was pleasant at first, it rapidly turned into a godsend
for insomniacs.
When he returned 20 minutes later with Stewart, he continued to dazzle
in a less obtrusive manner, although the end results were often the
same.
Stewart's voice is a monotoned and largely uninteresting affair, so
much of his continued appeal to audiences (in spite of a recent upsurge
in interest, it was apparent there were no new converts to Stewart's
music at the Strathclyde Suite) is down to the musicianship, and his
songwriting and storytelling skills.
The musicianship, despite sound problems and a broken string in the
early part of the set, is flawless but flat, insipid rather than
inspiring, and gave little dynamic to the songs.
It is the songs however, along with their subject matter, and the
between-song narratives that Stewart uses to enliven the show. His
literate, perceptive, and often humorous words cover topics as diverse
as polar exploration, the Treaty of Versaille, the actress Marion
Davies, and the influence of the little-known Nero And The Gladiators.
It should add up to a more satisfying evening, but sadly Stewart's
older songs sound dated rather than timeless, while his newer ones are
intentionally dated, rooted both lyrically and musically in the
inter-war years.
He obliged with Year of the Cat (''my simplest and best-selling song,
though I like all the others better'') but overall it was an overbearing
and underwhelming show.

QUENTIN Tarantino has a lot to answer for. Behind his visceral
cinematic style lies the sort of conversation you might overhear on the
back of a bus: what it lacks in depth, it makes up for with pop
philosophy. The success of the technique should come as no surprise to
those who relish the knowing, yet bemusing, dialogue of Joe Orton's
Loot.
But where Tarantino's bus is running through an American inner-city
ghetto, Orton's is trundling through Sarf Lahndan. Even if Orton does
underpin his farce about misplaced corpses and loot from a bank job with
a strong denouncement of the encroaching power of authority. So Kenny
Glenaan's directorial decision to bring a Tarantino-like viciousness to
the Royal Lyceum's production of Loot demands a certain move away from
the Hollywood focus.
To some extent this is achieved with Laurie Ventry's interpretation of
Truscott. He plays the witless cop -- who is confounded by the truth yet
who sees through the most savage conundrum -- as if he were a Monty
Python extra.
But simply to make the characters leap on to the stage is not enough,
even a stage as smartly set out as this, with cartoon proportions and
distorted perspectives. Nor is the adding of classic eighties pop to the
soundtrack.
This is a production that glimmers because of the dialogue, and
despite its delivery. What the cast have failed to realise is that
conversations overheard on the bus are funny for their own sake and have
no need to be laboured. It is early days yet, however, and a slicker
pace is certain to make the production shine.

THE first major reduction sale of the Woodhall Herd of pedigree
Simmental cattle is to be held on July 14, at United Auctions' Perth
Agricultural Centre.
The sale will comprise 22 cows with calves at foot, 12 in-calf cows,
12 in-calf heifers, 36 maiden heifers and 10 bulls.
The Woodhall herd, based at Innerwick, Dunbar, was founded in 1979
with the private purchase of Mounthooly Emma, a daughter of Scottish
Neff. Her progeny now account for almost half of the 75-strong herd run
by Mr Hector MacAskill.
The most recent bull to join the group is Greenside Courageous, a son
of Sacombe Wishful Thinking, purchased at Perth in February 1993, for
11,500 guineas. There have been seven bulls bought in all, and many
females in the herd go back to one of the original purchases, Deutsche
Loch.

CONCERN that Scottish Pride's operations could be driven by a desire
to depress milk prices as a means of increasing company profits was
expressed yesterday at the first annual meeting of the Scottish Milk
Marketing Board residual body.
The issue was raised by veteran dairy farmer Jim Forrest of Mid
Lamberton, Kilmarnock, who is a member of the ginger group Scottish
Pride shareholders' association.
He claimed that cheese and dairy operator Scottish Pride, formerly the
manufacturing arm of the SMMB, was now looking for cheap milk. ''The
original idea of the commercial side of the SMMB -- which we financed --
was to improve the pool price of milk,'' he said.
Mr Forrest queried the transformation of Scottish Pride from a private
company into a public limited company without the authority of a general
meeting of shareholders to approve the change.
Loudon Hamilton, chairman of the residual board, explained that the
changeover, as part of the arrangements for the deregulation of milk,
had been carried out under provisions laid down by the Secretary of
State for Scotland.
He suggested that Mr Forrest's questions might be appropriate for
Scottish Pride or Scottish Milk but not for the residual board, which
was restricted in its activities.
Its main responsibility, he said, was to wind up the affairs of the
old SMMB in an orderly fashion and in particular to act as custodians of
the resources of the board which had been contributed by producer
members over the past seven years.
Over the next five years the residual board will receive payments
totalling #4m from the farmers' co-operative Scottish Milk in respect of
assets transferred to it from the old SMMB. That money will then be
redistributed to qualifying producers through their shareholding in
Scottish Pride.
Producers were issued with Scottish Pride shares on a pro rata basis
at the time of deregulation. One farmer pointed out that about 1.6
million shares had been traded since then and sought confirmation that
payment would go back to the original producers rather than the current
shareholders.
The chairman said he could give no assurance on that point. ''Anything
which has happened to Scottish Pride shares by way of trading is no
affair of ours,'' he said. ''Any question of that would be for Scottish
Pride.''
However, once the residual board had overseen the repayments from
Scottish Milk to Scottish Pride any further assets left would be
distributed directly to producers.
Douglas Boyd, an accountant and residual board member, said in reply
to a question from the floor that the residual board had still to
collect gross debts worth #100,000. These were due from five firms.

RESEARCH into agricultural and veterinary science faces further cuts
in Government support and every penny that is granted will be hard won.
That was the message to emerge yesterday from the annual general
meeting of the Moredun Foundation, the successor organisation to the
Animal Diseases Research Association.
The meeting was held at the MF's new headquarters at the #22m Pentland
Science Park at the Bush Estate on the outskirts of Edinburgh and while
the members were greatly impressed by the new facilities, the director,
Professor Ian Aitken, was in a sombre mood regarding his future
financial resources.
Against the background of the Government's inquiry into the funding of
53 research institutes initiated in 1994 and whose conclusions are due
to be announced before Parliament rises for the summer break, Professor
Aitken commented: ''I don't appreciate any overall increase in
funding.''
Professor Aitken continued: ''I don't think agricultural research will
be high up the list in political terms because we're producing too much
food already.
''However, I take the view that our work has wider benefits in terms
of public health, the environment and in the general scientific field.''
The chaiman of the MF, Jim Stobbo, also highlighted that at present
the organisation was in a situation of static funding while at the same
time salaries and other costs were rising each year thus forcing staff
redundancies and early retirements.
Mr Stobbo said: ''That has been a short-term expediency but it does
not solve the problem confronting us in common with much of the
scientific community of an ageing population without the back-up of
established successor post-holders to carry forward their work.
''Continuing minimalistic funding has eroded the career structure of
research science. Short-term posts of three years extended only if
further funds can be won do not provide the structured workforce for the
sustained long-term effort essential for effective research and
development.
''Throughout history there have been warnings about eating the 'seed
corn'. I believe our recent experiences, if not akin to just that, are
then equivalent to exposing the planted seed to extreme drought.''
However, the MF has recently been able to offer five new posts to
recently qualified scientists who if they come up to the mark will be
offered 10-year contracts. That positive attitude will also see the MF
market itself internationally. Professor Aitken explained: ''Over the
years much of the emphasis of our work has been on sheep which in world
terms are very important.
''Few institutes have concentrated on small ruminants and we have
developed a high international reputation and we think we represent a
world centre of excellence. The indications are that we will get
overseas research contracts.''

<TEXT>
A RINGING endorsement of universities as bastions of wealth creation
and efficiency was delivered by one of Scotland's leading higher
education figures yesterday.
However, Professor Andrew Miller, Principal of Stirling University,
warned that the squeeze on student funding was so severe that it could
erode the quality of education for undergraduates.
In a graduation address, however, he defended UK funding levels which
had been said to be higher than in other countries. In reality, the UK
came out favourably because drop-out rates were lower here than
elsewhere.
Professor Miller said: ''Universities have often been urged to follow
business practices. Universities have in fact out-produced most of
business and I feel it is time that business was asked to emulate
universities.''
He also called for understanding of the plight of graduates who were
unable to secure the high-quality jobs to which they ''rightly''
aspired. Unemployment among Stirling graduates has fallen to 5.9%.
Professor Miller also drew attention to a recent study which showed
that universities were substantial wealth creators, with higher
education generating about #2500m worth of wealth and attracting #140m
in overseas revenue to Scotland.
Higher education was one of Scotland's main exports, he said.

BRITISH Steel boss Brian Moffat received a basic pay rise of just 2.7%
last year as pre-tax profits soared more than seven times, according to
the company's annual report published yesterday.
The increase is in stark contrast to the huge rises paid to top
executives at other privatised companies that have caused uproar among
customers, shareholders, unions and politicians.
Mr Moffat, who combines the roles of chairman and chief executive,
received a basic salary of #375,000 in the year to April 1, up #10,000
on the previous 12 months.
Taxable profits rocketed from #80m to #578m as the steel industry
cycle swung upwards and the dividend payout to shareholders jumped 3.75
times from 2p per share to 7.5p.
Including a performance-related bonus of #112,500 -- up from #109,500
in the previous year -- other taxable benefits and pension
contributions, Mr Moffat's total pay package increased 8.6% to #564,921
from #520,319.
The average rise in basic pay for all British Steel employees during
the year was 8% and they also received an average bonus of 17% of pay.

SARACEN Value Trust has confirmed a #30m share issue that will
virtually double the size of the Glasgow-based trust that invests in
smaller companies.
The placing and open offer of 'C' conversion shares, which was first
announced on June 13, will also bring in a large number of new
institutional investors.
Investment manager Ernie McKnight said about #20m of the new 'C'
shares would be allocated to newcomers to the trust.
These include the Save &amp; Prosper unit trust group, the Bank of England
pension fund, merchant bank Hill Samuel, Mercury Asset Management and
Merseyside County Council.
Institutions provided more than 95% of Saracen's initial #37m capital
when the trust was set up by SFM Investment Management in March 1994.
Since then, Saracen has outperformed its benchmark FTSE SmallCap Index
by 8.4%, even though its net asset value has barely changed.
The trust has called a meeting of shareholders and warrant-holders on
July 24 to approve the issue of #30m 'C' shares at 100p which will give
#29.5m net after fees and commissions.
The new 'C' shares are underwritten by Charterhouse Tilney, which
sponsored Saracen's launch 16 months ago.
They will be converted into Ordinary shares on or before November 21,
provided 80% of the net proceeds have been invested.
One warrant will be issued for every new Ordinary share issued on
conversion.
SFM Investment Managers, which was launched by two former fund
managers from Scottish Amicable, said ''current stock market conditions
provide an ideal opportunity to invest further funds in smaller
companies''.
It expressed confidence that these would outperform the market as a
whole in the medium term.

SECURICOR is continuing to assess its options for Cellnet following
the DTI's surprise decision to block the proposed sale of its 40% stake
to BT, its joint venture partner. However, it is not in discussions with
anyone else at the current time.
Securicor decided to instigate the disposal discussions with BT in
order to return some shareholder value and devote resources to expanding
further its managed businesses. Although Roger Wiggs, chief executive of
Securicor Group, emphasised that it had more than enough money
available, through a new banking agreement, to finance expansion.
Cellnet has been growing strongly with subscriber numbers up 715,000
in the firts half to just above 1.7 million. Securicor's share of
Cellnet's profit grew by 23% to #33m. Profits would have been more were
it not for a higher tax rate and increased costs associated with adding
new subscribers.
Next week sees the introduction of a new mid-price digital tariff for
small business and domestic customers which Cellnet hopes will attract
even more new customers.
Overall, Securicor Group increased its profits by 29% in the first six
months of the year to #47.6m. Earnings per share grew by 11% to 20.6p
and the interim dividend was raised by 12% to 0.902p.
On a divisional basis, there was a strong performance from most parts
of the Security Services businesses. However, the alarms business
suffered from technical faults and mangement errors. These have since
been rectified. Several new contracts were won including guarding East
Midlands airport.
Securicor Custodial Services is part of a consortium that has won a
#60m design, build, manage, and finance contract for a new prison in
Bridgend, South Wales. This is expected to be completed within two
years. The prison escort service in London is expected to make a profit
contribution next year. The second half is traditionally stronger for
the security services division.
Securicor Recruitment Services is growing strongly. The business,
which specialises in office appointments, made a foray into Scotland
with the opening of an office in Glasgow.
The parcels business enjoyed 15% higher volumes with good growth in
European and North American business. In May, the Russell Davies group
of companies were acquired which have a 24% share of the UK container
distribution market. It also has substantial warehouse management and
contract dustribution business with customers such as Dixons.
The group has been actively seeking opportunities in overseas growth
markets. It has formed a joint venture with Transnet in South Africa to
provide manned guards for Transnet's sites which include the airport,
ports and other major distribution routes.
In June, ASD was acquired giving Securicor a good share of the German
guarding and alarms monitoring market.
Gearing was 27% at the half year and has since moved up to 52% with
the acquisitions. The cash position was adversely affected by the
payment of connection incentives to new subscribers and the purchase of
the prison escort vans.
Securicior is confident about its continued progress in the second
half. However, the shares dropped 5p to 1613p.

BRILLIANT results from plasterboard manufacturer BPB brought a
churlish response from the stock market where the shares shed 7p to 311p
on fears that margins were coming under pressure.
Profits in the year to March jumped 52% to #163m and dividends are
raised by 11% to 9p after a final of 5.9p. Good volume growth, lower
rationalisation costs and a reduction in interest charges fuelled the
gain.
Plasterboard volume was 15% up, with notably strong growth in the
emerging eastern European market, where construction activity is
buoyant. A gypsum deposit has been bought in Poland and a plasterboard
plant is being built in Berlin to fuel the market.
The strong North American economy brought an increase in demand while
the building industry recovered in France and the UK. The German market
continued to grow, though margins were hit by price weakness, which the
market considers is a harbinger of things to come elsewhere.
BPB said margin improvement generally would slow because of the
time-lag in recovering raw material cost inflation through selling price
increases.
Plaster volumes returned to a growth trend, rising by 4% due to
encouraging sales in Germany, Spain, and the UK.
The paper and packaging division achieved a 23% increase in operating
profits to #15.1m on the back of a 4% rise in volume and cost savings
resulting from restructuring. These factors offset escalating costs of
waste paper which is the main raw material. They have since risen
further as global paper prices have soared.
BPB has reduced and lengthened its borrowing profile with the result
that financing costs were more than halved to #8.4m.
The use of plasterboard continues to make inroads into traditional
building techniques which underpins BPB's growth and so far it has
managed to keep competitors at bay, with new plants coming on stream
keeping costs down. Selling at 14 times earnings and yielding 3.6% BPB
shares are a hold.

A FLOOD defence plan for Perth costing almost #20m has been approved
by Tayside Regional Council.
It is designed to prevent the devastation caused two years ago when up
to seven feet of water submerged parts of the city after the River Tay
overflowed.
Additional landscaping and other environmental works have pushed up
the cost from #15.8m to #19.5m.
The plan includes a series of walls and embankments on the south and
west banks of the rivers Almond and Tay.
There will be consultation with the new Perthshire and Kinross unitary
authority before the plan is submitted to the Scottish Secretary.

William Russell explains why tomorrow's wedding between a royal
princess and her former bodyguard is unlikely to capture the media's
attention in the way the fairy-tale match between her mother Grace Kelly
and father Prince Rainier of Monaco
WEDDINGS in Monaco can be rather splendid affairs. Certainly the one
between Prince Rainier and the Hollywood princess Grace Kelly, in April
1956, was by anybody's standards a fairy-tale affair which attracted the
world's media and an amazing guest list of the most beautiful of the
beautiful people, even if the marriage proved turbulent.
Princess Grace apparently missed her Hollywood ways and was stifled by
the pomp and circumstance of the Grimaldi lifestyle in their 200-room
palace. The couple had three good looking children: Caroline, Albert and
Stephanie, and their doings filled the picture papers of the day with a
frequency which put the coverage of our own royal family in the shade,
and all seemed to be going as well as could be expected until Princess
Grace died following a car crash in 1982.
The latest Grimaldi wedding tomorrow will be rather lower in key, as
befits the circumstances of the bride, Princess Stephanie, and the
groom, Daniel Ducruet, since it is not so much the consummation of a
fairy tale as a happy ending to what could have been a nightmare.
The Grimaldis have reigned in Monaco for seven centuries; good going,
given that the family is allegedly cursed. There was a brief interlude
during the French Revolution when they were not in power, but that
apart, it has been wall-to-wall Grimaldis, and the present ruler,
Rainier III, is the 32nd of that ilk to preside over this tiny slab of
overdeveloped Mediterranean real estate with its casinos, motorways and
dodgy tax arrangements.
The family has had its ups and downs, far more so than the Windsors.
Either of his two wild-child daughters, Caroline and Stephanie, in their
respective heydays make Princess Diana look like goody-two-shoes, while
his son and heir, Prince Albert, a 37-year-old bachelor still looking
for Princess Right, makes Prince Edward seem quite interesting. It is
the youngest, wildest, daughter, Stephanie, who will tie the knot in
this wedding-cake township, although by Grimaldi standards it will be a
cut-price affair.
The union of Steph and Dan is not the result of a hasty decision on
their part. Known as the Princess of Excess, Stephanie, now 30 (who has
been a pop singer, a scent maker and a swim-suit model) has a long
history of love affairs.
Former lovers range from actors Mickey Rourke (''She always has to be
the centre of attention'') to Rob Lowe (''Every night it's the disco
until 6am''), to Anthony Delon (''When it comes to being fickle, she's a
professional'') and Christopher Lambert (''Men are just toys to her'').
Then there was an American record producer, Ron Bloom, who lasted 14
months, which was longer than most (''She is not a woman to live with
for long. That would put any man in a nerve clinic'').
Other lovers were Mario Jutard, a Los Angeles nightclub owner and
convicted sex-offender (''Her as a wife? No thanks . . . '') and a
Parisian, Jean-Yves Le Fur, who had done time for fraud, to whom she got
engaged. She ended up suing him for the cost of her engagement party.
In her youth she was a party girl straight out of the pages of F Scott
Fitzgerald. Maybe her wild past, because her present is anything but
wild, owed something to the fact that she was with her mother when the
car crashed. Princess Grace died -- Stephanie suffered neck injuries and
found the whole affair traumatic. But she was also, by all accounts,
spoiled as a child, but equally she could be just her mother's daughter.
Princess Grace may have been a vision of perfection, but Grace Kelly,
film star and model, was said to have slept with all her leading men
during her Hollywood career and to have had a drink problem.
Stephanie's party days came to an end in 1990 after she met Ducruet,
aged 30, who was employed as a royal bodyguard, the consummation of a
career which included stints as a pet-shop assistant, a fish salesman
and an ice-cream vendor.
Prince Rainier was, to put it politely, not best pleased -- Ducruet,
apart from anything else, being married to another at the time and
having just had a son by a woman not his wife. Prince Rainier banned the
upstart commoner from the royal household. Ducruet's response was to
sire the family's first bastard in generations, a boy called Louis, who
was born in November 1992. The Prince then excluded his daughter from
performing royal engagements, and she went on to have another child by
Ducruet, a girl called Pauline Grace, born in 1994.
But the estrangement from her father, the ending of which tomorrow's
civil marriage will mark, did not endure. The Prince, now 72, was
reconciled with his daughter last year after undergoing open-heart
surgery -- she rushed to his bedside, bringing his grandchildren and
they apparently charmed him. In any case, he could not quibble with the
fact that she had patently had four happy years of non-marriage. He will
be present, as will the whole royal family, tomorrow.
After the civil wedding, which takes place in the palace, there will
be a blessing in the royal chapel, followed by a reception on the
terrace of Loews Hotel. It is one of those neo-concrete affairs which
clashes with the old baroque buildings of the principality that have
survived the building boom, the perfect nouveau riche Trump-type setting
for the couple to celebrate the end of their trial marriage during which
they have flaunted their domesticity in Monaco. If she was a less than
Serene Highness for all those years, life with Ducruet appears to have
made it a fact.
The other Grimaldi ''playgirl'', Princess Caroline, settled down
rather earlier than her younger sister when she married the playboy and
businessman Philippe Junot. That match ended in divorce. Her second
marriage was successful, but her husband, Stefano Casiraghi, by whom she
has two sons, Andrea and Pierre, and a daughter, Carlotta, was killed in
a boating accident.
In 1993 the Vatican, which had reluctantly agreed to annul her
marriage to Junot the previous year, thus making her marriage to
Casiraghi acceptable in the eyes of the Church, also agreed that their
three children should be legitimised. That meant, if Prince Albert did
not ensure the continuance of the line, there was an heir apparent --
Prince Andrea.
Prince Rainier, known as Grimy during his schooldays at Stowe, is our
Queen's 15th cousin, in a line which can be traced back to Henry VII.
His Scottish connections are much stronger. His great grandmother, wife
of Prince Albert I, Lady Mary Victoria Hamilton, was the only daughter
of the 11th Duke of Hamilton and it was their son, Louis II, whom
Rainier succeeded in 1949.
As for his own future, Prince Rainier is adamanat that he is staying
put, despite the stories that he intends to stand down in favour of
Prince Albert which have appeared regularly for at least a decade.

* LABOUR'S health plans -- and its proposed phasing out of GP
fund-holding in particular -- were welcomed yesterday by one of the 2800
non-fund-holding doctors in the UK covering 4,000,000 patients.
Dr Colin Brown, a GP based in Paisley, said the proposals represented
excellent news for the majority of Scottish GPs who have not responded
to incentives of up to #40,000 a year in subsidised management costs to
take on fund-holding.
A total of 700 doctors in Scotland are fund-holders, with 1,100,000
patients.
Dr Brown, said that co-operation among Scottish GPs opposed to
fund-holding meant the locality commissioning groups mentioned in
Labour's plans were developing in Scotland, but without Government
support.
He said: ''So, many Scottish GPs will welcome the proposal to provide
central funding for this more efficient way of advising in health
care.''
''Local commissioning is a good way of turning the clock back to a way
many of us think the public would support,'' he said.

WE are delighted to report scenes of confusion involving visitors to
these parts. The uncertainty concerns a sign on various tourist routes
which consists of the image of a camera with no words attached.
The sign is, as all us locals know, a warning that polis speed cameras
are in action on that particular stretch of Tarmac. The tourists,
probably German or Japanese and of a literal and authoritarian caste of
mind, have been reading it as an invitation, or perhaps instruction, to
stop and take snaps of the adjacent scenery.
We hear that this topic was raised recently at a meeting of the Loch
Lomond, Stirling and Trossachs Tourist Board on two counts. First, the
polis are more than somewhat concerned about the aforementioned tourists
stopping their motors and creating traffic hazards at potential accident
spots.
Then there is the general lack of appreciation by the tourists who
have been of the opinion that the locations recommended by the signs do
not represent the most attractive bits of Scottish scenery.
More Romulan
THERE has been much wailing and gnashing among science fiction
aficionados over the outplanetish decision by the London tabloid press
to dub John Redwood a Vulcan.
Mr Spock and his Vulcan people may be cold fish, they point out (which
itself is very unfair to fish) but they are not evil. Mr Redwood is,
according to PC-SF experts, a Romulan, these being the evil cousins of
the Vulcans.
All of this debate leaves aside the issue of who the other Star Trek
peoples are. What about the Ferengi? These are incredibly ugly,
aggressive people. Names on a sealed-down envelope to the usual
StarDate.
* We filch from the estimable Londoner's Diary of the Evening Standard
the following definition of redwood from Chambers Dictionary:
''Red-wood, wud (Scot). Stark mad.''
Softening the blow
WE have to report an interesting development at the personnel
department of Strathclyde Regional Council. The council is now offering
''post-interview counselling''.
Strathclyde's personnel services (equal opportunities) sub-committee
has been told ''that as part of the council's continuing process of
promoting best personnel practice and equal opportunities, unsuccessful
candidates were now able to request post-interview counselling''.
Have your gateau and eat it
IT will soon be Bastille Day, when we announce the winners of our Auld
Alliance competition, so let us proceed with beaucoup vitesse.
Somehow we have lost sight of the initial imperative of celebrating
the historical, linguistic, and cultural links between Scotland and
France. Thus we offer this tale from William McKinlay of Tullibody. It
is from the last war, well within the sell-by date of the average Auld
Alliance anecdote.
His uncle, in France conducting hostilities against the Boch, and a
chap not known for writing letters home, prevailed upon a French fellow
combatant to scribble a note to his mother in his native village of
Fallin in Stirlingshire to tell her all was well.
Thus the letter, written in French, arrived at Fallin. His mum could
tell it was news of her son but could not understand what it said,
French not being the strong point of your average mother in a
Stirlingshire mining village.
She made off, in haste, to enlist the translating ability of the local
schoolmaster, one Captain Gracie (Retd), a man of some scholarly renown
and possibly the only educated man in Fallin. (Mr McKinlay's words, not
the Diary's.)
Her speedy progress was impeded by a nosy neighbour inquiring where
she was going in such a hurry. She replied, somewhat curtly: ''Ah hivnae
got ony time tae talk the noo, Jessie. Ah've jist got this French letter
sent me through the post an' ah'm gaun up tae see Captain Gracie before
he goes oot.''
Jean Rodger of Dalry, a retired modern languages teacher, recalls an
original and inspired translation in a French exam by a third-year pupil
in a posh Glasgow girls' school. Struggling to find the words for the
French phrase ''tant pis, tant mieux'' the young lady came up with:
''Auntie peed. Auntie felt better.''
M Jean-Claude Richard, the French consul in Scotland and originator of
this competition, has been back on the prize-gathering trail. We can add
to our list dinner at Le Marche Noir restaurant in Edinburgh and some
extremely tasty gateaux from Florentins Patisserie.
The prize list, in case you have forgotten, also consists of two Air
France tickets to Paris, a visit to an Elf oil platform in the North Sea
with a trip to Aberdeen thrown in, a magnum of Bollinger, dinner at Le
Chardon restaurant in Edinburgh, B&amp;B at Sir Fitzroy Maclean's acclaimed
Creggans Inn in Argyll, and a case of Cru Special Vielle Alliance from
France-Ecosse Wines of Edinburgh.
So many prizes, indeed, that at the end of the exercise we will
conduct what the French no doubt call une raffle when the names of all
the contributors so far mentioned will be put into un chapeau.
As ever, there is still time to get your Auld Alliance franc's worth
into the Diary at the Herald at 195 Albion Street, Glasgow G1 1QP.
* STILL on the subject of France, we are grateful to Tom Bowden of
Polmont for passing on a menu from the Hotel Libertel chain. Under its
list of assiettes gourmands, they list a Scottish option. According to
the hotel, a typical menu ecossais is tomato with mozarella and basil,
asparagus tips, lamb in a Jurancon sauce, a terrine aux trois legumes,
toasts Polane, brie de Meaux, butter and black grapes. They eat little
else in the bistros of Sauchiehall Street.

MOSCOW: Russia's defence and interior Ministers, architects of
Moscow's military campaign in the rebel region of Chechnya, offered to
resign on over a bloody Chechen raid on a southern Russian town.
They and several other security officials offered to quit at a session
of the policy-making Security Council, called by President Boris Yeltsin
to discuss the raid and hostage-taking in Budennovsk this month in which
at least 121 people died.
Yeltsin was expected to consider their offers in the next two weeks
and it was not clear if he would accept them.

Texas, for an undisclosed sum.
Baker Hughes specialises in the design and supply of packages of
process equipment used in well-testing and early production facilities.
An Expro official said yesterday that the acquisition gave the group
critical mass in the United States, which was part of its strategy for
growth.
Expro is moving its business towards the Gulf of Mexico, to enable it

A CHURCH of Scotland minister's son and three others lost in a
drowning accident off the Egyptian coast were probably trapped while
diving in waters that were too deep, official sources have confirmed.
Yesterday, the victim's mother, Mrs Ann Warner, criticised the
Egyptian authorities for calling off the search for his body and for
failing to tell the family that their eldest son had died.
She appealed for British divers to conduct a renewed search for her
son's body.
Mr David Warner, 23, from Halkirk, near Thurso, Caithness, his
girlfriend Miss Lisa Thomson, 24, from Hertfordshire, and two German
companions drowned on June 15 while diving in the Gulf of Aqaba off the
resort of Dahab on the Sinai Peninsula.
Miss Thomson's father, John, travelled to the Middle East where he
hired Israeli divers, who recovered his daughter's body, but the bodies
of Mr Warner and the two Germans have not been found.
Last night, the Foreign Office formally called on the Egyptian
authorities to mount a new search for the missing bodies after they
abandoned an earlier attempt when conditions were deemed too dangerous.
The Foreign Office has also contacted the British Embassy in Tel Aviv
to ask for Israeli help in the search.
New inquiries have revealed that Mr David Warner and his companions
were probably trapped while diving at too great a depth for their
equipment.
Last night, a British Government official told The Herald they had
been told the four people were diving to a depth of 200 metres, which
would require special equipment including a complicated mix of breathing
gases.
''There are still a lot of technical questions we want answered before
we can be sure what happened to the two Britons,'' he said.
''But it is now likely that their bodies must have become trapped a
long way beneath the waters.
''The Egyptians gave up the search because it was too dangerous to go
down to that depth and the Israeli divers used by Mr Thomson were vastly
experienced and had essential deep-diving equipment.''
Yesterday, Mrs Warner said her family only learned of the tragedy on
Sunday when local police broke the news to them at their home in
Halkirk.
''This has been like a nightmare,'' she said. ''Especially with the
long time gap between David going missing and the family being informed.
We still do not know the details of what actually happened.'' She said
Egyptian authorities had not contacted them and a thorough search had
not been conducted.
''Why were we not notified, why wasn't more done, and why was there
this delay?'' asked Mrs Warner.
''We do not even know Lisa Thompson's father's name but at least he
had the decency to get a fax message to us. He now has his daughter
back, albeit in a coffin, but we do not even have that comfort.
''I have faced up to the fact that they may never find David . . . but
if there is a chance I have to press for that to happen.
''If there is a diving school anywhere with the right equipment I
would say to them please help conduct a proper search,'' she added.
Mr Warner went to Israel last November to work and live on a kibbutz.
During a break in the Red Sea resort of Eilat, he tried his hand at
diving in the warm waters above the nearby Dolphin Reef.
He then trained as a diver in the Israeli resort and went to the
Egyptian part of the Red Sea to qualify as a diving instructor.
The family believe that he had been working for the Laguna and Canyon
diving centres while he underwent his instructor's course.
His father, the Rev Kenneth Warner, said: ''I just hope there is a
positive response to my wife's appeal through the media for help. It
would be a great comfort to the family if we knew that David's body
could be recovered and be made available for a Christian burial.''

<TEXT>
IN his article on Myra Hindley, Kennedy Wilson alludes to Lady Macbeth
''seeming nastier than her feckless husband'' (June 21). He really
cannot be allowed to get away with the inaccuracy of this comment.
Macbeth was a very good king who ruled for 17 years and was able to
make a pilgrimage to Rome (a not inconsiderable undertaking in those
days, I would imagine), leaving his wife Queen Gruoch in charge as
Regina Scotorum.
There is nothing to suggest that Lady Gruoch (a princess of the senior
branch of the royal house) was a nasty person. To try to equate her with
Myra Hindley is not only very unfair but rather distasteful.
It would appear that Kennedy Wilson bases his assumptions of the Lady
Gruoch and Macbeth on the character assassination perpetrated by
Shakespeare when he wrote his play Macbeth.
Unfortunately too many people, and it would appear that Kennedy Wilson
is one of them, take this play as gospel when they should remember that
Shakespeare was not a historian, merely a playwright spinning his
fairy-tales.

A ''REVOLUTIONARY'' product for tracking printed circuit boards
through manufacture is the first to be launched from labelling company
Donprint International's new #1m-plus manufacturing, research and
development plant at East Kilbride.
Donprint has doubled its capacity at the high-tech Peel Park Campus by
taking over an existing 19,000 sq ft facility, in which it is investing
more than #1m in raw material-coating technology. Previously, its
operations were focused on cutting and printing labels.
The East Kilbride company is the first to develop a solvent-free
labelling tracking product, which it considers a major environmental
breakthrough.
Syntem, a film which will be manufactured in jumbo reels then cut to
size, is expected to go into production next week.
Donprint currently employs about 80 people but another 30 employees
could soon join the East Kilbride company's payroll.
Managing director Iain MacRitchie said: ''Our research and development
facilities are among the best in the world, and Syntem, along with other
products under development, will help maintain our market-leading
position in new product development by reducing costs to our customers
while offering improved quality.''
Part of Leeds-based group Jarvis Porter, Donprint is achieving
year-on-year sales growth of about 37% and projects turnover of about
#12m in the year to end-November.
Most of its customers are in the computer and electronics sectors but
Donprint also supplies appliance and automotive manufacturers.

ALASDAIR CAMERON (Opting for Union, June 27) doesn't want Scotland to
achieve independence because an independent Scotland will, he imagines,
be ruled by the votes of West Central Scotland -- ''Monklands writ
large'' as he puts it.
He prefers instead that Scotland should be ruled by ''the devil we
know'' -- the votes of London and South-east England.
So much for the 89% of Scots who want rid of this aimless,
incompetent, corrupt, and anti-Scottish Government. So much for the 75%
of Scots who want a Scottish Parliament. So much for democracy. What Mr
Cameron is actually saying is that he prefers English Tories continuing
to tear Scotland to shreds rather than take the chance of Labour ruling
an independent Scotland.
Is this the ''Scottish cringe'' in its purest form?
And if Labour wins the next election what will Mr Cameron do about
''Monklands writ large'' across the whole of the UK?
I am reminded of the words of Mr Ian Lawson as he left the Tory Party
to join the SNP: ''As a businessman I have come to the conclusion that
any Scottish government will be better for Scotland than any more
English government of whatever political persuasion.''

MR John Redwood argues that it would not be beyond the ability of any
government to make savings on 1% of total public spending, ie a cut of
#3 billion. Absolutely right!
Public spending in Scotland alone could be cut by that amount. Total
spending would then still exceed Scottish tax revenues by #3 billion,
and spending per head of the population in Scotland would still be #150
higher than in England. And how can that figure be justified when
unemployment here is lower, and the standard of living higher, than
south of the Border?

Seoul, Friday
RESCUERS battled against time and darkness today to save shoppers
screaming for help as they lay trapped in the rubble of a Seoul
department store which collapsed like a house of cards.
Officials in charge of the operation expected the death toll to rise
as the painstaking work continued through the night. By early today it
was at least 44, with about 850 injured.
Witnesses said the five stories of one of the Sampoong Department
Store's two blocks fell one on top of the other into the basement during
busy evening shopping.
Hopes of finding survivors faded with time and rescuers, part of an
army of 6000 volunteers at the scene, said their work was hampered by
the threat of fire and the precarious state of what was left of the
six-year-old building in southern Seoul.
''The area looks like hell. We hope to keep pulling more people out
alive throughout the night. But the resuce work is not progressing
well,'' a police officer said.
State television estimated that 1000 people were inside the collapsed
part of the store at the time of the accident.
It said many more were still trapped in the rubble and these might
include foreigners and children. Shocked relatives kept a grim vigil
hoping for word of their loved ones.
Many of the victims were women; sales clerks in their early 20s and
shoppers who had gone to the basement food section, where perishables
are sold at discounted prices in the late afternoon.
Working in the glow of arc lights, rescuers were forced to withdraw
when fire broke out before dawn today but they resumed as quickly as
they could.
''I saw one middle-aged man stuck in a basement elevator. But I
couldn't reach him because a big block of concrete was in the way,''
said one rescue worker.
An army sergeant helping the rescue operation said many of those
trapped were presumed dead. He said he feared scores of victims were
lying dead in the debris.
''Scores of people are still buried but in view of smoke coming out of
the rubble most of them would have died of suffocation,'' he said.
Earlier, rescuers had combed delicately through heaps of concrete
debris in a race against time to save the lives of shoppers trapped deep
below and still screaming for attention.
''I could hear many people trapped under the rubble shouting for help.
But we are not able to reach them,'' a rescue worker told state
television.
Sampoong, one of Seoul's most exclusive department stores in the
upmarket district of Kangnam, is a favourite with the city's foreign
community but there were no reports of foreigners among the dead or
injured.
''I heard a blast, and suddenly the shop wasn't there any more,'' said
Canadian teacher Lorne Oliver, who was passing the store at the time of
the disaster.
Dazed shoppers stared at the wreckage while many shop assistants,
their pastel green uniforms streaked with blood and plaster, wept
uncontrollably.
Fleets of ambulances battled rush hour traffic to get to the store,
which is situated near one of the busiest junctions of a city notorious
for its traffic chaos.
Police did not say what caused the accident but rescue officials
confirmed reports that government safety teams had visited the store
after a supervisor found large cracks in pillars and buckling ceilings
on the top floor.
Hours before the collapse, guests in a store restaurant said gas had
been switched off, apparently because the management had already
detected problems.
A store employee told state television signs of collapse were apparent
hours before the disaster. She said an emergency meeting of the store's
management was called but no steps were taken to close the building.
The Yonhap news agency said the president of the store and two of his
executives were being questioned by police. It gave no further details.
The cause of the collapse was believed to be shoddy construction,
Mayor Choi Byung-yol said. Some employees said they were told to
evacuate the building shortly before the 6pm disaster. The owner of a
restaurant on the top storey said the floor and ceiling had been
crumbling all day.
Han Jung-suk, blood on his face, told KBS TV he was in the store lobby
when the building caved in.
''I felt the building wavering, and moments later, several store
employees rushed down from upper floors,'' he said.
People who believed relatives were in the store fought with police to
go inside and search. Thousands of people in nearby apartment buildings
were evacuated as a precaution.
The collapse is the latest in a series of man-made disasters to hit
South Korea in recent months, killing hundreds and embarrassing the
government of President Kim Young-sam and his ruling Democratic Liberal
Party (DLP).
Kim is already battling waning popularity and a severe defeat in local
elections this week.
''It isn't a good week for President Kim. The DLP was obliterated in
elections and the new disaster deepens a sense of crisis for his
administration,'' said lawyer Kim Jae-hoon.
Kim has become inextricably linked in the minds of many South Koreans
with the series of disasters which have struck the country since he took
office in February 1993.
Trains and planes have crashed, two city districts have been destroyed
by gas leaks, a Seoul bridge collapsed and ferries have sunk since he
became president. Hundreds of lives have been lost.
Many of the disasters have been blamed on shoddy workmanship or human
error which Kim has condemned and pledged to stamp out.

I recently had the opportunity to visit the HCI Hospital project in
Clydebank and, along with others present, was impressed by the
enthusiasm, dedication and professionalism of the staff we met and of
the technological excellence of the equipment and general ambience.
About 400 people are now employed, and they desperately want the
project to succeed.
The impressive buildings, with hospital, hotel, and conference centre
facilities, stand in acres of beautifully landscaped gardens which were
previously a derelict industrial wasteland.
The people of Clydebank deserve such an improvement to their
environment, and the excellent facilities it provides. Politicians,
regardless of political persuasions, should be doing everything in their
power to ensure the success of this hi-tech facility of medical
excellence.
But excellence has never been high on a Socialist agenda, preferring
to encourage the masses to be satisfied with monotonous mediocrity.
Nothing has changed. New Labour is going to be just as painful as Old
Labour.

THE last couple of weeks have shown the present political system in a
clear light. It shows how democracy in Britain, and especially in
Scotland, only exists for the select few.
At a national level, the Prime Minister is chosen not by the mass but
by 330 MPs. Surely the leader of the country should be decided by the
electorate -- an electorate who voted (though not even in the majority)
for a Conservative Party led by the present leader, his party, and his
policies. Would a Europhile floating voter still have voted Conservative
if John Redwood or Michael Portillo had been leader of the
Conservatives?
Does not democracy, at a national level, at least allow us to have a
say in who runs the country? Apparently not.
There are some more fundamental questions. Can the leader of the party
of government resign and still remain head of government? If so, where
is the constitutional precedent? Should the head of state (the Queen)
now intervene, as it was she who invited the PM to form a government? Is
this present political system now shown to be obsolete and out of touch?
John Major, the Prime Minister (or is that someone else?), defends
Britain's present constitutional arrangement as one that provides
''stability and strength''. Very little of either has been seen in the
last few days (or even in the last couple of years).
The now ex-Welsh Secretary, John Redwood, recently defended the
present political system as being in the best interest of the country.
If this is obviously not true at the UK national level then what about
the local level?
Jean McFadden's article in Open Forum on June 22 showed how more and
more of the responsibilities of local authorities have been given away
to undemocratic, unelected and secretive quangos. And even if the vast
majority of the local electorate don't like what's happening locally, eg
water privatisation -- then tough! They have no say in who is appointed,
no access to the overwhelming majority of meetings, or right to inspect
members' interests, or minutes of quango meetings or even see policy
papers!
Jean McFadden is not alone in thinking that local democracy is being
strangled. In a survey done by Charter 88, 89% of local councillors
believed that the present that the present system of quangos needs to be
reformed. This was was even more stark in Glasgow where 96% of
respondents wanted reform of the quango state.
But councillors, like the electorate at large, don't seem to have any
access to the ''democracy''decided by the privileged few. Has John
Redwood forgotten the farce that was the Welsh Development Agency.
This lack of local democracy is combined with the clear call for a
Scottish Parliament, of some sort, by the majority of Scots -- a call
ignored by the few with the power. It therefore comes as no surprise
that many people are completely disillusioned with politics. When the
voter seemingly has no say either nationally or locally in the
decision-making process, is it a wonder that they ask ''What's the
point?''
We shouldn't be asking whom the Tory MPs are going to choose as leader
of the country, so much as how we can change the system so that the
electorate can have a say in the decision-making process -- at all
levels.

IN his article on Myra Hindley, Kennedy Wilson alludes to Lady Macbeth
''seeming nastier than her feckless husband'' (June 21). He really
cannot be allowed to get away with the inaccuracy of this comment.
Macbeth was a very good king who ruled for 17 years and was able to
make a pilgrimage to Rome (a not inconsiderable undertaking in those
days, I would imagine), leaving his wife Queen Gruoch in charge as
Regina Scotorum.
There is nothing to suggest that Lady Gruoch (a princess of the senior
branch of the royal house) was a nasty person. To try to equate her with
Myra Hindley is not only very unfair but rather distasteful.
It would appear that Kennedy Wilson bases his assumptions of the Lady
Gruoch and Macbeth on the character assassination perpetrated by
Shakespeare when he wrote his play Macbeth.
Unfortunately too many people, and it would appear that Kennedy Wilson
is one of them, take this play as gospel when they should remember that
Shakespeare was not a historian, merely a playwright spinning his
fairy-tales.

I AM writing in my capacity as deputy chairman of North Tayside
Conservative Association.
I would like to affirm the support I believe the majority of our
members have in the leadership of John Major.
Our member of parliament, I believe, has made a mistake in prolonging
the uncertainty which has dogged our party. I know that he believes
passionately in our national sovereignty and sees the increasing
bureaucracy in the EU as a threat which must be dealt with.
I do, however, believe that the course on which he is set could lead
to a rift within the party which will cost us the next election, thus
leaving the country open to the Labour Party policy of total European
integration. So in fact by making his stand now he will in all
probability bring about exactly what he does not want to happen.
While I have great respect for Bill Walker and will do all I can to
see him re-elected as an MP I very much hope he will take this
opportunity to think again, and to back John Major, the only candidate
who can unite the whole party.

HURRAH for David Wishart (Weekender, June 24) for telling it like it
is.
Having recently returned to this country after more than a few years
away, I have been appalled by the indifference of Scots to the beauty
that surrounds them, and their unwillingness to recognise that tourism
is a business that benefits us all.
Cans on Royal Troon are but the tip of a very large, depressing
iceberg. Mr Wishart was perhaps trying not to be too negative when he
failed to mention the sullen-to-downright-rude shop assistants,
waitresses, bar staff.
The Scottish Tourist Board can dream up all the new images and
strategies it likes, but until it puts a smile on the Scottish service
industry's face the tourist industry, particularly the repeat-business
sector, will continue to decline.

HIGHLAND Regional Council is demanding that Dounreay stop negotiating
to reprocess foreign nuclear fuel until the serious problems of
contamination identified in an official report have been solved.
It is to review the planning consent it granted in 1992 for
reprocessing work and is to invite anti-nuclear campaigners to give
their views before the next meeting with the Dounreay management.
The council adopted this new tough approach to the Caithness plant
yesterday, the first time it had met since the Committee on Medical
Aspects of Radiation (Comare) in the Environment and the Radioactive
Waste Management Advisory Committee (Rwmac) published their joint report
this month.
This was a damning indictment of Dounreay's management and storage of
20 years of nuclear waste in a 200ft shaft which had to be sealed in
1977 after an explosion. Dounreay itself has estimated that it will take
10 years and #200m to make safe the shaft and its nuclear legacy.
The council also decided yesterday to seek assurances from the
Government that it would pay to clean up the shaft and ask Comare and
Rwmac to clarify their concerns.
Dr Iain Glen, councillor for Cairngorm, moved the motion, saying: ''We
need to review our own position urgently in light of these reports. The
Atomic Energy Authority is going through a privatisation process and it
will be even more difficult to get information out of them.''
Lochaber councillor Iain Macdonald said: ''This shaft is a classic
example of what the next generation will have to face -- Mother Earth
dotted with suppurating shafts of poisonous radioactivity for thousands
of years.''
The council is due to meet the plant's management on July 17.
However, Mr Ken Butler, safety and environmental manager at Dounreay,
said yesterday: ''I don't think we will stop negotiating for foreign
waste contracts. We'll seek to persuade councillors that reprocessing
that type of duel is the best thing for the world, the best
environmental option.''

EDINBURGH Solicitors' Property Centre is undoubtedly right to ridicule
Government figures on negative equity in Scotland (June 29). The problem
in Scotland has never been anything like that in England, in either
quantity or depth.
But it is a huge and complacent mistake to conclude therefore that all
in the Scottish housing market is rosy. After all, the ESPC has a vested
interest in talking up the market.
Negative equity is only one indicator of where problems might lie.
Other signs are less reassuring. House price inflation that has affected
Scotland in real terms of 30% over the last ten years. Outside the
right-to-buy market this will inevitably cause problems of access for
new buyers, particularly when the supply of rented accommodation has
contracted so dramatically.
Repossessions are running about half the level of England;
nevertheless the number of people applying to local authorities as
homeless following mortgage default has more than doubled in the last 10
years.
Future prospects are not comforting either. It has been estimated that
home owners in Scotland will face housing cost increases of 12% this
year as a result of MIRAS reductions, income-support changes, and
interest-rate rises.
Government policy seems to rest on the blithe assumption that home
ownership can take the strain of meeting Scotland's housing needs. This
s manifestly not the case, with larger numbers of one-person households
and changing patterns of work.
Yet the Scottish Office continues to crank up its target levels for
home ownership and to retreat from investment in rented housing. This
reflects an utter disregard for precisely the same kind of underlying
conditions which have shattered the housing market in England. How often
must a lesson be thrust under our noses before we change course?

MR REDWOOD tells us that he was appalled at Mr Major calling for a
leadership election at this time.
Does Mr Redwood not realise that a vast number of Conservative
supporters were appalled at the way Mr Major's friends were treating
him? He was at the stage where he did not know which of his friends he
could really trust -- such is this game of politics.
He was spending too much time looking over his shoulder to see who was
next going to stab him in the back. He had no option but try to settle
the matter once and for all.
I am also a little suprised at Mr Redwood associating himself so
closely with Mr Lamont.
Mr Lamont is a very clever shrewd man and realises that by supporting
Mr Redwood he has nothing to lose. If Mr Redwood wins, he will be given
a Cabinet post; if he loses he can always say that he did not stand
against Mr Major.
Mr Redwood must surely realise that one reason, if not the main
reason, for Mr Lamont giving support this way is not much for the sake
of the country or for the sake of the Conservative Party but because of
a personal vendetta against Mr Major.

Keith Moore revels in the heat of Glasgow's jazz festival, and
suggests you get along to cool out at the opener in Candleriggs tomorrow
night
AS GLASGOW heads for meltdown in the summer heat, there's only one
place to be tomorrow night. A place where the grooves and the dancefloor
will be so hot that there's every chance the venue will self-combust.
Where? The McEwan's Old Fruitmarket in Candleriggs for the best
toe-tapping night of this year's Glasgow International Jazz Festival.
Strange Fruit is the event. To older jazz-daddios, it will be exactly
that -- too odd to be flavoursome. For others, it's the kind of night
the jazzfest has been missing out on for years. This is not your
standard jazz gig. Alongside DJs, there will be a couple of groovesome
bands and hi-tech club lighting and visuals.
Local clubland guru Nick Peacock will be wearing out the styli in his
own vinyl-destroying way, and there's live music from The Prodigal Sons
led by Greg Kane, the OK one from Hue and Cry, and also featuring a
stellar line-up that includes rising Scottish stars like Russell
Cowieson, Colin Steele and Kevin Mackenzie. Additionally, Robert
Henderson and Ed Higgins from Hermon X will jam with Kamera featuring
Nick Pamphillon and DJ Donster.
But for many the main attraction will be DJ Gilles Peterson, the man
who single-handedly rebirthed the cool and brought jazz to a brand new
audience via the danceable genre that became known as acid jazz.
As a club DJ of world-wide repute, a radio DJ on the funkier airwaves,
and A &amp; R manager for Talkin Loud records, the most successful British
dance label, Peterson has more than earned his musical credentials. And
respect is due.
He's freshly returned from a trip to the States where he's been
working on new projects for his label, Talkin' Loud, among them one by
Nuyorican Soul, part of the New York/Puerto Rican cultural explosion
which offered up the much-praised Nuyorican Poets.
Peterson describes it as an avant garde dance concept album. It
features the Masters at Work as well as Tito Puente, Jocelyn Brown and
Roy Ayers. For Talkin' Loud, this is a new direction, just like another
project, an album by Chicago folk-soul singer Terry Callier.
Yet with a roster including Galliano, Urban Species and Incognito, it
must be said that Peterson has refused to allow Talkin' Loud to stick to
a formula, his own ethos being that you've got to keep moving.
In Peterson's opinion, acid jazz nowadays is too conservative even for
John Redwood. ''Back in the eighties when I started, I was mixing things
on the desks that didn't belong; putting Public Enemy next to The Art
Ensemble of Chicago, followed by 808 State. It was never meant to be
James Brown and Brand New Heavies and all lightweight compilation
material advertised on the telly.
''There has been a noticeable shift in recent years, with people
becoming more interested in vocals and the darker side of things. Take
Tricky or Portishead. They're hybrids of the dance scene, producing good
quality sounds that are music and artist-led. In the case of Portishead,
they didn't set out to produce a commercially successful album, but they
created a brand new sound.''
Always an avid jazz fan, Peterson pays keen attention to new jazz
sounds, particularly what's happening Stateside, where acid jazz has
taken off. But he appears to be more interested in the real thing --
Kenny Garrett, Joshua Redman and Cassandra Wilson. Of his own jazz
heroes, he cites Yusef Lateef, Pharoah Sanders and Coltrane. ''I always
preferred stuff that was on the edge, in fact my desert island disc
would be Wayne Shorter's Speak no Evil.''
Dangerous dance-floor material there, but Peterson is all about taking
risks, and says it's what keeps hims going. You can guarantee he'll keep
you in a hot-foot frenzy tomorrow night from 10.30pm. Sounds cool to me.

MANY people in the City seem to think the Asda results are brilliant
including the chairman Patrick Gillam who said so. There may even be
grudging congratulations from Argyll after Asda's claim that its market
share of 9.7% eclipses that of the Safeway subsidiary and propels it
into third place behind Tesco and J Sainsbury.
The most startling figure, and also the most crucial and illuminating,
is the 8.4% rise in like-for-like sales which is well ahead of anything
else the supermarket sector has been able to put forward in the past
year or two with Tesco's 7% the nearest comparison.
As a result full year pre-tax profits in the year to end April jumped
35% to #246m, earnings a similar proportion while the dividend total has
been raised 25% to 2.2p with a 1.59p final.
The shares responded by rising 4[1/2]p to 90p for a 3% yield.
Chief executive Archie Norman yesterday said that customer numbers had
risen by 8%, bringing the total increase over the past three years when
the present management team rescued the company from the edge of the
precipice to 32%. Put another way, an extra 1.2 million customers are
trundling through the 196 stores each week to bring the total to 5.2
million.
Pricing is part of the secret -- but every supermarket chief says that
-- although the Asda policy of targeting the family shopper more
aggressively than some of the competitors is obviously working.
Strategies such as Big Shopper where the heavily laden trolley is given
special treatment, gimmicks such as Pet Stop and the most important
aspect, the creation of a customer friendly culture.
That is being reinforced by a share options scheme for Asda workers.
All the 36,000 staff who work more than 15 hours a week and with more
than one year's service will be entitled to options equivalent to up to
25% of salary.
Another aspect is that the average Asda store is about 43,000sq ft of
selling space compared with 26,000sq ft at Sainsbury and Tesco and
22,000sq ft at Safeway. That obviously gives much greater flexibility to
sell clothing, stationery, and books much more effectively than in more
cramped premises. One objective is to turn the George clothing brand
into number two in Britain behind Marks &amp; Spencer's St Michael.
Asda claims that it lags the big two food sales per square foot but is
ahead of the rest of the pack.
Although overall sales rose 7.5% to #5682m, nearly #100m of the
increase was due to sharply higher petrol sales, up 28% to #400m. If
that is stripped out, the sales gain is cut back to just over 6%.
Food price inflation was pretty flat throughout the financial year
thanks to general competition with Asda one of the more aggressive
participants. But it has now risen to about 2[1/2]% with more to come as
commodity costs pressures work their way through.
That is obviously beneficial to margins, Asda saw a rise last year
from 4% to 4.7%% but there will not be the runaway levels seen in the
1980s. That partly reflects the continuing investment by Continental
discounters and home grown competition from the very effective William
Morrison and Kwik Save.
The store opening programme will run at about six units a year,
costing perhaps #90m out ofa total annual spend of #250m. These include
a new unit in Govan to raise the Scottish total to 28 as well as a
re-site at Cumbernauld.
One criticism of Asda has been that its portfolio is old in comparison
with its major rivals but that can be rebuffed by the average size being
60% greater. However, its charge for depreciation does appear to be
somewhat low, down #12m to #91m, although it will rise in the current
year because of the increasing momentum of investment which includes a
continuation of the #70m systems technology where it has been a laggard
until now.
Profits have been helped by an #11m release from earlier provisions
which if discounted and a same again 1994 depreciation charge had been
used would have resulted in profits before exceptional charges which
totalled #310m actually having risen by 24.5% rather than the headline
figure of 35%.
That is nit-picking to some extent against the sales background where
Asda is creating a different type of store and moving much more quickly
than the competition.
For the current year, profits should reach about #270m which would
leave the shares trading at 14 times likely earnings which is a slight
premium to the sector.
The City likes the tale of the From Recovery to Breakthrough programme
for the next three years -- something which is promised as radical
change. As long as Mr Norman does not trip though over-enthusiasm, the
shares look interesting.

THIS is more like it: a really significant, substantial blockbuster
for the Edinburgh Festival.
Opening tomorrow the longer to enjoy it, From London offers a
mindblowing array of 100 powerful pictures by luminaries like Bacon,
Freud and Kitaj. There's whole rooms devoted to Freud's scarifying,
intense nudes, Auerbach's pigment-loaded portraits and Andrews's
fastidious Australian landscapes. Two massive triptychs by Bacon plus
his famous Pope's scream, Innocent X, from 1949 are worth the trip
alone. At long last the Gallery of Modern Art has something worth
shouting about.
However, despite charging #3.50 for admission, they are scandalously
bad at explaining their treasures. The paintings have basic labels --
after that you're on your own. Even if you buy the #15 catalogue, the
essays are very general.
National galleries have a real responsibility to inform and help the
public. They should not assume that every visitor is an expert.
Bacon, an Irishman, is the best known of these six figurative painters
who form the so-called School of London. He died in 1992. The rest are
all aged between 60 and 70. Of the six, only Kossoff hails from London
though all have lived in the city for over 30 years. Though disparate in
style, they are united by a belief that everything that matters can be
said in paint.
When painting itself seems under threat, even scorned, especially, and
ironically, by Glasgow which contributed so much to its 1980s
resurgence, it's good that folk can see for themselves just what
authority and magnificence can be achieved with oils.

WILLIAM SCOTT should not be surprised that prominent people should
avail themselves of other people's maxims (June 22). They do read and
remember.
The recent TV series on Winston Churchill told us again that he called
his bouts of depression his black dog. I am sure he got that from The
Anatomy of Melancholy written more than three-and-a-half centuries ago
by Robert Burton. There, in ''Symptoms of Desire'', Burton wrote:
''Cardinal Crescence died so likewise desperate at Verona; still he
thought a black dog followed him to his death-bed . . . ''
Churchill was also responsible for reintroducing the phrase iron
curtain to the language although it was used by others before him in the
same sense . I don't know who was the first recorded user of escaping by
the skin of his teeth, to mean a very narrow escape, but we find
''escaping with the skin of my teeth'' in the Bible (Job 19:20) in a
somewhat different meaning.
Well-publicised use can often give a phrase more currency than was
obtained by the original author. How many would have heard of Louise
Haskin's ''man who stood at the gate of the year'' had it not been
quoted by George VI?

A HEADMISTRESS had a glass smashed in her face by the jealous wife of
a farmer, a court heard yesterday.
Wilma Robertson, 36, of Ribigill Farm, pled guilty at Dornoch to
assaulting Mrs Anne Scott, of Rosebank, both Tongue, on January 2.
Procurator-fiscal Elaine Hillis said Mrs Scott, head of Tongue
primary, had been at a New Year party at the Craggan Hotel, Melness.
Around 2am, she had put her hand on the shoulder of Wilma Robertson's
husband, Fred. At that point, Mrs Robertson returned from the bar and
saw Mrs Scott leaning on her husband.
''There may also have been a New Year's kiss,'' said the fiscal.
Robertson told Mrs Scott to take her hands off her husband, and threw
a drink over her. Then she stuck the glass in Mrs Scott's face. It
shattered.
Mrs Scott was taken to hospital in Wick, where she received seven
stitches.
In a police statement, Robertson said she saw Mrs Scott with her arms
around her husband.
She did not mean to smash the glass, she claimed. ''I could not
believe it when I saw the blood,'' Robertson said.
The fiscal said the attack was intentional, however, as there were two
distinct actions of throwing the drink then smashing the glass in Mrs
Scott's face.
Sentence was deferred until July 6 for social inquiry and community
service reports.

THE National Health Service has a role in British life beyond its
acknowledged task of delivering nationally funded health care to those
who need it. Whether ideological critics like it or not, it represents
an aspect of community in this country which is still of great
importance to the majority of the population, including that
proportionally small number who are able to make choices on health care
for themselves. Conservative reforms of the NHS are regularly
characterised as ''attacks'' and little more. This is not wholly true,
though it is close enough to the truth for the mud to stick. Few dispute
that the old health service, the one left behind by the last Labour
Government in 1979, was desperately in need of reform. It was an
organisational shambles with various feifdoms controlled by unlikely and
incompetent bands of either local politicians or medical consultants. An
over-arching policy was absent, though through it all the ethos of
service to the community persisted in the minds of both staff and
patients. Conservative reforms have brought about some much-needed
improvements but many more absurdities.
This is not the place to discuss Tory policies on health care in
detail, for our ultimate purpose is to examine Labour's new proposals.
Nevertheless, the unfortunate side of Tory reforms, including the large
increase in NHS bureaucrats, the wasteful competition between different
arms of the service, and the general ideological stupidity which
yesterday brought even nurses to the point of wholesale rejection of
their no-strike pledge, will not be forgotten, and in some cases not
forgiven. To their eternal credit, the reforms of recent years have at
least brought a new breed of patient in the form of people who are not
afraid to ask questions of their doctors, to demand that the best
available treatment be found and to kick up a fuss if it is not
delivered. Underpinning much of the criticism of the modern NHS is the
simple truth that people prefer to work together and generally work
better and more efficiently if this sort of framework is supplied. The
current competition in the NHS, with internal markets and hospitals
vying for the patients of GPs may, on paper, have provided alluring
potential. The reality is that it has provoked division and confusion,
heightened by a general perception that the Tory Government and, as we
have seen from the uneven pronouncements of Mr Redwood, any Tory
Government, appears set on producing a partly private NHS in which those
with the ability to pay will inevitably secure better treatment. This is
not to say that private medicine should be excluded. It will always have
a place, but a minor one.
Will Mr Blair provide anything better? The tone of the Labour NHS
strategy announced yesterday is encouraging. The stress on co-operation
instead of competition is potentially fruitful; competition implies
winners and losers while co-operation suggests a different and more
positive emphasis. Labour proposals for Health Authorities have the
great benefit of making these essential planners of health services more
accountable. One of the puzzles with Tory health reforms in recent years
is the fact that the Tories failed to recognise that the more they
loaded the representation on the authorities in favour of their own
supporters, the less people trusted them. Labour must take care that its
rendering of these bodies accountable does not develop into a mirror of
the Tory packing technique. The removal of the internal market is,
likewise, a healthy move. It was always an awkward beast in a caring
situation in which, as we have already said, efficient and well-managed
co-operation is always likely to provide a better standard of care for
the greater number.
The vexed question of GP fund-holding is dealt with firmly in the new
Labour plans. It will be phased out and gradually replaced by GP
practices banding together to negotiate medical services from local
health services. This would represent a victory for common sense, for it
is precisely what is already happening spontaneously in several areas of
the country. Furthermore, it avoids the waste involved in each GP
practice negotiating lots of different contracts to gain services for
its patients. General Practice Commissioning is, again, co-operative and
all the more likely to provide a better service because of it.
Labour's health proposals have been generally welcomed by various
representatives of the health care professions. They are seen to be
evolutionary rather than revolutionary, and if any further reform of the
health service is to succeed it must embrace the fact that more upheaval
would simply bring the service to the point of collapse. There are
aspects of Tory reforms which were necessary and which have been
judiciously retained in the Labour proposals. But just as important as
the detail is the impression that persuasion and a gradual approach will
be the preferred method of a Labour health minister. This will be a
healing process, and not before time.

Michael Tumelty talks to the artistic director of the Chamber Group of
Scotland about his scores for the box
SCOTLAND'S leading composer James MacMillan has just completed his
most unusual commission to date. He has written the new signature tune
and incidental music to the BBC television arts series, Edinburgh
Nights, which will broadcast reviews and reports on BBC2 three nights a
week throughout the Fringe festival in August.
The music -- written for violin, cello, bass guitar, percussion and
piano -- has been recorded by the Chamber Group of Scotland, of which
MacMillan is an artistic director.
''I've never had to write anything quite like this before,'' MacMillan
said of a composition which had to be written as a whole series of tiny
bits and pieces. ''The music has had to be tailored exactly to time
requirements.''
It comprises a closing title-sequence of 45 seconds, an opening one of
about 20 seconds, and as many as 20 musical fragments that will be used
to separate and link different items in the programmes. ''It's been
quite fascinating to see it all come together,'' he said.
There may not be a lot to it, but up to nine network broadcasts during
three weeks makes a lot of exposure. Not that MacMillan is short of
exposure. He is about to head off to a festival in Canada in which he is
the featured composer, and in the autumn his music will again be
featured in a Scottish music festival in Gdansk, Poland, where he will
be conducting his own compositions.
MacMillan also disclosed yesterday that next year his percussion
concerto, written for Evelyn Glennie, is to be taken into the repertoire
of the New York Philharmonic, one of the most prestigious of the major
American orchestras.

A DEMOB-happy John Major won some plaudits yesterday for pointing out
that 40% of the Labour Party voted ''against'' Tony Blair, when he
became its leader. This was meant to imply that division is endemic in
any party.
It would perhaps have been excessively cruel to have pointed out that,
in Labour's case, the vacancy and resultant open contest existed on
grounds of death. Major, on the other hand, is merely re-applying fpr
his own job.
Reports of his political death may yet to prove to be exaggerated,
though the wounds will be deep. Machiavelli himself could not have kept
up with the tortured thought-process of the Tory selectorate; far less
the manoeuvres of these loyalty-pledging Princes of Darkness, Portillo
and Heseltine.
I can only offer my own random selection of brief encounters with Tory
MPs yesterday. The first, a Europhobe who has publicly declared for
Major, assured me that Redwood would ''get more votes than anyone
expects''. The next, a leading Redwood supporter, was far from confident
of a second ballot, because ''people are trying to be too clever''.
In right-wing terms, ''cleverness'' means calculating the course of
action which ensures that a change of leader does not equate to the
elevation of Michael Heseltine. And of course the only way to safeguard
against that is not to mess about with Redwood or abstentions in the
first ballot.
My third conversation was with a pro-European who first stated the
obvious: ''Nobody knows because this is the most treacherous and
mendacious electorate in the world.'' But he added: ''I think Major will
be all right.''
In the ebb and flow of rumour and opinion, that view was gaining some
ground yesterday. This was because the Redwood train seemed to have
become stuck in a tunnel; more Eurostar than Eurosceptic, though heaven
knows how it reached the tracks in the first place.
How could any aspirant Prime Minister contrive his campaign launch in
such a way as to have Bill Walker appearing as the most normal citizen
in his entourage? Rarely has a single room, even at the House of
Commons, been equipped with so many wires to the moon.
I find it hard to believe that Major will not fulfil the two criteria
for re-election -- more than half the votes of Tory MPs and a 15% lead
over Redwood. On that basis, he could in theory carry on and tell his
enemies to go and take a jump to themselves. That would be genuinely
courageous.
In these circumstances the threat to him would not come from the
democratic procedures, if the term can be used so loosely, of the Tory
Party but from the internal pressures aplied by the vanquished --
whether via men in grey suits or in white coats. Why should he take any
notice of them?
But every time things seem to look up for Major, as they did briefly
yesterday, a setback soon follows. For example, the tactic of declaring
that a straightforward majority would be enough for him to carry on was
undermined by one of his allies, Sir Andrew Bowden, who put a figure on
it.
More than 100 Tory MPs failing to support Major would put him in
difficulties, declared the unknown knight. Suddenly Sir Andrew was
famous and a benchmark had been created out of nothing. It will still be
a very difficult one for Major to meet.
The irony of that, of course, is that none of the other contenders
could conceivably have fewer than 100 dissenters lined up against them,
in similar circumstances. That is spectactularly true of Heseltine and
Portillo, the two who are now organising for the second ballot which may
or may not happen.
Some of the older hands were recalling yesterday that, in the Commons
clash immediately prior to Labour's leadership contest in the early
eighties, Michael Foot put on a bravura performance which undoubtedly
tipped the scales just that little bit in his favour, to give him
victory over Denis Healey.
Similarly, Major probably won himself back a few votes from doubters
with his merry quips yesterday. On top of that, the wall-to-wall
publicity of the past few days has given him and the Tories a modest
boost in the polls. It will be enough to persuade a few more Tories to
give him the benefit of the doubt. Whether or not they like the Michael
Foot parallel is up to them.
This is entirely an artificial period in politics, which diverts
attention from the matters which have turned the electorate so firmly
against the Tories, under any leadership. When the bugle has sounded on
their contest, there will still be mass unemployment, negative equity
and communities cripped by continuing recession.
At that point, people will start noticing again the ordinary little
matters in life -- such as yesterday's news that 94.7% of Royal College
of Nursing members feel forced to support lifting the ban on industrial
action. That is the kind of achievement which has evaded all previous
administrations and is obscured only very temporarily.
It will be back to BMARC and Scott, sleaze and fat-cats, Europhobes
and Eurosceptics, unwanted privatisations and dogmatic cuts in public
services. There will soon be another by-election to fight and lose.
These, irrespective of Major, will be the continuing Tory
characteristics.
As one pundit summed it up on the Terrace last night, as plotting
continued all around us: ''The best the Tories can hope for is to come
out of it the same as before -- except worse.'' Which rather begs the
question of why they went into it in the first place.

IT has been a long time brewing for the Tetley Tea men, but yesterday
Allied Domecq agreed to sell its Tetley Tea operations to a management
buy-in team led by Leon Allen for #190m, writes ANDREW WILSON.
This is considerably below what Allied had hoped to obtain when it
first announced that it intended selling Tetley as part of its strategy
of concentrating on its core businesses of spirits, retailing and
brewing.
The brand is the second biggest in Britain for tea and stole a
marketing advantage with the introduction of the round tea-bag.
Prudential Venture Managers will invest #60m and Schroder Ventures is
putting in #38m as part of the total funding of the acquisition which
totals #250m, including debt being taken over and working capital.
Mr Allen first sprang to prominence when he led the buy-out of Del
Monte from RJR Nabisco. That was to have been floated but instead there
was a trade sale to an associate of Anglo American Corporation of South
Africa. He is currently chairman of successful Scottish sausage skin
manufacturer Devro.
In a formal statement, he said that the business includes one of the
UK's best-loved brands and offers enormous potential for success as an
independent company. He is looking forward to joining the existing
management in its future development.
In the year to March, the businesses being sold, which are the
worldwide tea and coffee interests of Allied Domecq, achieved trading
profits of #14m on turnover of #370m. The net assets changing hands are
worth #154m.
In addition to the institutional investors, the existing management
and staff will be invited to participate in the equity.
So far, Allied Domecq has raised about #500m from the sale of its food
interests. One further asset to go is the 75%-owned Lyons Irish Holdings
which is quoted on the Dublin Stock Exchange and approaches have been
made from third parties. Allied has so far failed to sell its
Continental bakery operations.

WE MUST update our original assessment of the most brilliant man in
Parliament. Mr John Redwood, we believed, mastered calculus at the age
of three and the sublime poets of the Augustan Age well before his
teens. A new achievement is now revealed; xenophobia by early middle
age. This is not, for those who rarely reach the end of the dictionary,
a disease brought on by the bite of a rabid dog, or even sheep. It is
most commonly described as intense dislike of foreigners. Perhaps more
revealingly, it can also mean intense fear of foreigners. Whatever the
exact nature of Mr Redwood's affliction he has got it bad, and in his
case a complication has set in which takes the form of intense ignorance
of foreigners, by which we mean the Scots. He is clearly comfortable
enunciating the theories and prejudices of the Little Englander,
unenlightened (at least yesterday) by the fact that Britain is a complex
mesh of values, traditions, and emotions, not all of which have their
well-spring in the south of England. Mr Redwood does not know that
Scotland has a legal system which is distinct from the system in
England, which alone qualifies the claims of brilliance made by his
supporters.
Nor is he comfortable with elementary words expressed in a decent way
when he tries to criticise the intrusion, as he sees it, of EU
directives into British life. His peculiar phrase about the dangers of
crossbreeding a German dachshund with an English bulldog may be a
subliminal appeal to ancestral fears and prejudices. That is the nice
way of describing it. Others might think it xenophobic and bordering on
racism.
Mr Redwood, then, is not nearly as clever as he thinks. He is also,
politically, on the slide, we fear. All of this makes Mr Major the best
candidate to lead the Tory party, which is what we have been saying for
some time. His demeanour yesterday was crisp and effective. If he has
burned boats he is enjoying the freedom of it all. If Tory MPs have the
slightest smidgeon of sense they will reject the brilliant one
decisively, and plump for a man with manifest human decency. If he is
badly damaged in the first round of voting, everyone may have to think
again, but Mr Redwood, in any form, is out of the question.

Fionna Duncan turned down a ''contract of a lifetime'' with a top
American recording company when she was 18. As Alison Kerr reports, it
has been no obstacle to her singing career
CANDID may well be the best way to describe Fionna Duncan. Off stage
and on, she is unafraid to expose her emotions; and one senses that --
unlike many singers -- there is no difference between Duncan the person
and Duncan the performer. It's just possible that this honesty has
worked against her in terms of career development, but as she points
out: ''I never thought of myself as a singer -- it was just something I
did.''
She began singing when she was a child. Her elder brother and sister
played piano -- both played it well by ear. Duncan, however, needed
formal lessons and loathed them. ''I decided that the only thing I could
do that I didn't have to work so hard at was singing.'' Her father, who
had played trumpet professionally, helped her learn to play the guitar
and she became heavily involved in the folk music scene, largely through
one of her teachers at Rutherglen Academy -- Norman Buchan.
While performing folk music in public, Duncan listened to jazz in
private. She had grown up among her piano-mad family hearing records by
all the great ivory ticklers. But when she abandoned all pianistic hope,
she switched her attention to jazz singers. June Christie and Peggy Lee
were the initial favourites, but then she began working her way up to
date from the recordings of early blues singers.
Despite her increasing interest in jazz, and continued involvement in
the folk scene, Duncan still didn't consider singing as a career option
-- not even when, in 1957, she was offered a contract from no less a
record company than Riverside (whose stable of jazz stars at that time
included Chet Baker, Bill Evans and Thelonious Monk).
That offer -- an extremely prestigious one -- came when 18-year-old
Duncan was on a 10-month stay in America with her parents. It all sounds
like a Hollywood biopic: ''I met this songwriter, Ann White (whose
father was a millionaire), and her manager. She had cerebal palsy but we
got on really well, and she told her father that she wanted me to record
some of her songs.''
The two girls traipsed around record companies in New York with EPs of
30 numbers. When they went to Riverside, the studio auditioned Duncan
and offered her the contract of a lifetime. She turned it down since it
required moving permanently to the States, and returned with her parents
to Glasgow, never -- she says, quite categorically -- regretting her
decision.
Back in Glasgow, she picked up from where she had left off. She began
singing with the Joe Gordon Folk Four on radio's Saturday Club, before
being recruited into the jazz-playing Clyde Valley Stompers. Obviously
able to turn her voice to both folk and jazz, Duncan claims she had ''no
particular style'' in those days. At the age of 20, she went to London;
not exactly sure what she'd do when she got there, but probably not
expecting to be working behind the cold meats counter of Woolworths on
Oxford Street.
Another lucky meeting took place at that very counter when she looked
up to find the man requesting half a pound of streaky bacon was none
other than radio producer (and subsequently BBC bigshot) John Kingdon.
His intervention helped Duncan escape from Woolworths and into more
radio work.
Having fixed herself up with an agent, she began gigging around
London, ending up at a West End club called the Georgian, which she
describes as ''a high-class whorehouse''. What started out as a
one-night engagement turned into a seven-year stint as Duncan became the
club's resident singer.
She spent much of this period -- the mid-sixties -- living in the
house of Jimmie Macgregor. As her earnings increased, she graduated from
the basement bedsit to the top-floor flat and became pally with the
girls operating at the Georgian. Initially, however, they wouldn't talk
to her.
''Then the head girl, Cherry -- a Cockney -- took a fancy to me. She
started making song requests -- Stella By Starlight, Laura, Misty . . .
If I was ever having a party I'd ask her for some booze and she'd give
me bottles of champagne and Courvoisier for a pound each: she had a
cupboard full of booze because any customer wanting to take a girl out
had to buy a bottle.''
In 1971, Duncan came back from a transatlantic trip in time to be on
stage when the club was spectacularly raided and closed down as ''a
house of ill-repute'' -- a source of great hilarity and anecdotal
possibilities for her. Not least the moment when, at the resulting
trial, one of the geriatric magistrates inadvertently pulled a packet of
condoms out of one of the champagne bottle bags being used as evidence.
Duncan spent the next year in plaster after slipping five discs while
on holiday, and at that point she vowed to stop singing and become a
hairdresser. For six years she resisted the temptation to perform, until
one night when George Penman asked her to join his band on stage.
Once Duncan had yielded to the temptation to gig, she was a lost cause
to hairdressing -- which she hated. She sold her last salon in 1986 and
tried to decide what to do with the rest of her life. There really was
only one answer. ''I thought to myself: 'I'm going to do what I always
do -- I'm going to sing.' But I'm doing it now with a different
attitude. I'm doing it because I want to do it. Now that I've done other
things I know that there's nothing else that makes me feel so
positive.''
So positive, in fact, that Duncan is about to set off for America to
do a course of workshops which will teach her how best to pass her
knowledge and experience on to fledgling jazz singers.
In the meantime, her unflaggingly sunny disposition will be drawing
visiting and local musicians on to the bandstand from tonight as her
quartet reprises its role as host of the Glasgow International Jazz
Festival's nightly jam session.
* Late Night Festival Club at the Marriott Hotel every night during
the Jazz Festival, from 11pm.

A DEGREE of calm returned to the City yesterday. There were no further
political shocks to digest, and the Bank of England's auction of #2500m
of Treasury 8[1/2]% 2005 met unexpectedly strong demand, writes R E
DUNDAS, Chief Financial Editor.
Sterling enjoyed a good day, and its trade-weighted index regained 0.4
to 83.4. Equities and gilts were in good heart, though the tea party was
upset in the afternoon when strong US housing starts put a damper on
hopes that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates next week.
This hit US Treasuries and Wall Street stocks. Gilts, boosted by the
success of the gilt auction, went into retreat, and shares gave up some
gains.
Earlier the FTSE-100 share index had clambered back through the 3300
mark, but it later closed 11.3 points higher at 3294.0.
The pound spurted ahead against the dollar, gaining 1.60 cents to
$1.5901, but it dropped back 0.31 pfennigs to DM2.2031. Hopes that
sterling's decline had been overdone helped boost overseas demand in the
auction. The cover was two times and the yield 8.4%.
The outcome justified the Bank's decision not to postpone the auction
because of the political crisis.
On Wednesday and Thursday of next week, after the result of the first
round of the Conservative leadership vote is known, the Federal Open
Market Committee meets to decide if US rates should be cut.

Kirsty Scott reports how the latest scandal to hit Spain could be one
too many for the embattled Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez
IN PRINT it looked like any other ledger of telephone calls, but the
document which appeared in Spain's El Mundo newspaper two weeks ago has
shaken the nation to its core and has nudged the country's Prime
Minister close to the brink.
The telephone calls, made by prominent Spaniards, including King Juan
Carlos, had apparently been carefully logged by the military
intelligence body CESID, which had been bugging the mobile and cordless
telephones of politicians, businessmen and royalty for up to eight
years.
The exchanges themselves were not detailed in the press but appear to
have been fairly tame; there was the president of Real Madrid chatting
to a well-known actress; a conversation between the King and a prominent
businessman from Majorca; a quick call by the British captain of the
Spanish Royal yacht; and a series of calls made by politicians and
businessmen to their lovers.
Ordinary Spaniards, tired of a string of governmental scandals, have
been incensed at the latest fiasco, and in particular at the involvement
of their popular Royal Family. The King has not been drawn publicly on
the phone-tapping but is said to have invested in some anti-bugging
devices.
''It was the bugging of the King that really threw people,'' said Roy
Wickman, a journalist working in southern Spain. ''The former head of
the royal household was interviewed after the story broke and he didn't
mince his words. He was furious.''
For the Socialist Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez, it is the second
and most serious scandal to hit his Government this year, and is made
all the more embarrassing because Spain is due to assume the mantle of
the EU presidency tomorrow.
It is still not clear who leaked the ledger of calls to El Mundo. The
general belief is that it was secret service agents working for their
own financial ends. El Mundo is an avowedly anti-government daily
newspaper, and the Government initially used the rival influential daily
El Pais to blame the scandal on a group of rogue operatives within
CESID. The rest of the Spanish press, meanwhile, have pointed the finger
at a former senior CESID official who was sacked in 1991.
Last week, however, officials insisted that CESID had not deliberately
eavesdropped on private calls but had intercepted the exchanges during
routine monitoring of Spain's ''radio-electronic space'' in the
interests of national security.
The issue was picked over in a debate in the Spanish parliament
yesterday but with no more dramatic pronouncements by Gonzalez. On
Wednesday night he announced that he had accepted the resignations of
Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra and Defence Minister Julian Garcia
Vargas. The head of the intelligence services Lt-Gen Emilio Alonso
Kanglano resigned earlier this month after the story broke.
Gonzalez himself, although titular head of CESID, has denied any
knowledge of the bugging, and has, so far, shrugged off growing calls
for his own resignation.
It is not the first time he has had to do so this year. In February he
had to explain himself over alleged government links to GAL, the
anti-terrorist liberation movement which killed 27 Basque separatists
between 1983 and 1987, and over an alleged fund linked to the GAL
campaign. Despite his angry and televised protestations of innocence,
opinion polls showed that a majority of Spaniards rejected his claims
and a significant majority believed he should resign.
Wickman, who has watched Gonzalez cling on to power, believes the
latest scandal may eventually prove to be one too many.
The public have been gripped by the almost daily developments in the
phone-tapping case, he said, with the entire country coming to a virtual
standstill when Gonzalez goes on air to discuss the matter.
Yet even if the Socialists manage to brush off this latest
embarrassment, as they have done with others, Wickman believes there is
a deeper problem within Spain's governmental structure, which will have
to be addressed.
''What's behind all this? Well, when Franco died, the whole machinery
that he set up, the secret services, the civil guard, that all stayed
there, but got pushed into the background. It looks like these days the
Government doesn't have that much control over it.''

<HEADLINE>Opec may push up quota to counter North Sea oil</HEADLINE>

OIL cartel Opec may fight back against North Sea producers who are
reaping the benefits of its self-imposed output restraints, Royal Bank
of Scotland energy economist Mark Shea warned yesterday.
The UK sector of the North Sea, where daily production increased by
about 500,000 barrels last year, has been mopping up a
disproportionately large part of the increased worldwide demand for oil.
Demand has risen by more than one million barrels per day during the
last two years.
With Opec -- the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries --
already beginning to exceed its 24.5 million-bpd production ceiling, by
about 700,000bpd during April and May, energy analysts feel the cartel
of Arab, Latin American, Far Eastern and African oil producers may
increase its quota, at least to the 25.5 million-bpd level, later this
year.
Mr Shea also warned that, if the recent Brent Spar debacle results in
an insistence that spent platforms be dismantled on land, the higher
costs could put some of the big American players off North Sea
development.
However, in spite of these potential storm clouds, Royal Bank of
Scotland believes the North Sea oil and gas industry remains strong.
The bank's Oil and Gas index, published yesterday, reveals that North
Sea output fell for the fourth consecutive month during May. The overall
index fell 13% to 152.4 -- representing daily average output of 3.42
million barrels of oil equivalent -- with both oil and gas production
slowing.
However, this was again the result of seasonal factors and total May
output was more than 2% higher than a year earlier. Average daily
revenues were 8% higher, in spite of a 13% fall to #38.2m during the
month.
Gas production always falls off at this time of year because of the
lower demand for heating in warm weather. With a number of oil fields
shut down for routine maintenance during May, oil output could bounce
back slightly during June.
The Brent Crude price looked destined to remain around the $17.50 to
$18 level this month. However, hopes of stability were dashed when the
new Opec president, Venezuelan Oil Minister Erwin Arrieta, was quoted as
suggesting the organisation's oil quotas could be abandoned in the near
future.
Brent Crude's fall, characterised by widespread selling and movement
of funds into equities and bonds, bottomed out around the $16.50 level.
It is currently trading around $16.75.
The self-imposed limits on the output of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Venezuela, Nigeria, Indonesia, Libya,
Algeria, and Gabon have remained unchanged for nearly two years.
However, looking ahead to the next Opec meeting on November 21, Mr
Shea said: ''I think there will be a few analysts in the market who
would think Opec would be keen to push up quotas.''
Elsewhere, the debate surrounding the disposal of redundant North Sea
platforms is still at an early stage.
If underwater graves for the structures are ruled out, and there could
be pressure on the UK Government from countries like Germany and the
Netherlands to ensure this is the case, the dismantling of platforms on
land would probably be good news for oil and gas service companies in
the North-east and throughout Scotland.

BUT a week or so back I was told by a memorandum that I was not to use
a certain word in my column. Well you get that quite a lot: I don't know
why. A word is a sound if it is spoken and a collection of runic marks
if it is not. The word was ''shagged''.
Now it is only a word anyway and it's not as bad as lots of other
words. Words like ''dead'' or ''executed'' or ''cancer'' or bloody
Serbia strike me as a lot worse than the word I am not allowed to use,
and a lot less fun in the very concept of it. Nobody used the word which
I am not supposed to have in my blatt, in their newspapers, and
certainly not ours, over the week, this being a family blatt. But, dear
heavens, they certainly implied it. They didn't just imply girls. They
showed enough bums and tits to make you sick. There was more meat in the
tabloids than you could get in an average abattoir. Hugh Grant.
It turns out, crivvens, that film star Hugh Grant had a whore on some
night in Sunset Boulevard. Well that's a surprise, a harlot on Sunset
Boulevard. You can have every Norma Desmond on the street but not a
prostitute. Behave yourself.
What surprised me and everybody else was why a handsome young wealthy
male film star was jouking about trying out brass nails in the first
place. If I looked like Shug I widnae have to pay, I hope. I would be
hanging about nightclubs with my minders pulling in all these girls.
This is not sexist. If I was Hugh's wee lemon curd, this Liz Hurley, I
would be having young men with pectorals like buttocks on them attending
to me day and night, especially night.
And then I thought again. It must be dreadful being a dead handsome
film star. Think of these girls who pay you attention. Speaking as a
very famous journalist with practically the worst cover-up hairstyle in
the world, virtually no bum at all, and a 48in chest, in short, a freak,
I can assure you how bad it gets with girls. It is Play Misty For Me.
I have met girls who think I can get them jobs in a circus and I
probably could: as elephants, but less polite than elephants. You think
this is rude? Try the girls. They have more smeddum than Bengal tigers.
But let us go back to prostitutes. What possessed the blatts to think
this was a story? Even my ain wan went for it. Late at night on Sunset?
Sweet Lord, you should see every city in Europe. Germany is especially
keen on late-night activity. Hamburg, Munich, Frankurt: the girls are
out there with their coats open showing it all. Ageing girls too
usually.
East Germany the girls are younger and cheaper. You can get a hooker
for less than a fiver in East Berlin or Dresden. Try Hungary. The land
of my grandfathers has whores for the cost of a bowl of broth.
Prostitutes are for ever. So why the story?
What makes a man go with a girl of the night anyway? Because she looks
nice? Well, some do. You should see some hotels where the girls are
lovely. Because it is easy. Well it is and you get a lot less trouble.
Because at the end of the day women can cause so much trouble when they
invade your life and maybe the other way round as well?
I can imagine that a lot of female film stars would prefer an
untroubled physical relationship to having to deal with dreadful horrors
like Errol Flynn or Oliver Reid. To be honest with you I suspect that
most women would rather enjoy the Flynns and Reids but they could always
find themselves with nightmares like Randolph Scott or Rock Hudson who
would be forever slipping out to rough bars for rough trade.
Frankly the lassies would be better off with Hugh Grant. Or myself if
it comes to that. A whore and a harlot? Why Hugh Grant anyway, the silly
man? Why the story? I never was with a whore in my life. But I'd like to
think I'd be decent with the lassie if I was. And pay them the rates and
maybe a wee bit more. And enjoy it. And think about why we need each
other in the ways we do.
There are indeed men who get paid by women, but the gigolo is somewhat
unusual and probably somewhat of a myth.
The reason why Hugh Grant found himself in flagrante delicto has
probably got something to do with an American morality which seems
doubtful to we Europeans.
A bit naive Hugh seems at that, and certainly his employers. Hugh
Grant and a girl? What was wrong with the film company? They should have
got him a girl anyway, introduced him the way they once did with Cary
Grant and Janet Gaynor or Elvis Presley to Ann-Margret. Back in the old
days film stars met a girl from the same studio. A nice one.
I am asking The Herald the same thing; get me talking to a lassie.
They knocked me back. ''Anyway,'' I said to the editor, ''Ah can get wan
masel.'' I have just phoned Ms Hurley. Left my request on the answering
machine. Frankly I don't hold out much hope.

CAIRO: Sudan said that Egypt was reinforcing troops along a disputed
border area and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said he had fresh
evidence Khartoum had tried to assassinate him.
In Khartoum, Major General Mohammad Abdalla Oweida, head of the
Sudanese parliament's security and defence committee, said that Egyptian
troops had been engaged in unusual troop movements in the desert border
triangle of Halaib.
Halaib is claimed by both Sudan and Egypt and has been a source of
tension between the two countries since the 1950s.

WE TOOK tickets in the West Highland weather lottery last weekend and
won. How could we know, when we planned a weekend in Oban with two
11-year-olds, that we wouldn't need its climatic refuges of swimming
pool and and sea life centre and other undercover operations of the
Scottish tourist industry?
Oban looked implausibly glamorous. Its vistas were exotic. Kerrera,
Lismore, and Mull drifted in the blue like islands of the Aegean, their
profiles spare and lean, but the foreground had all the voluptuousness
of the domestic June: the tender greens, the dim purples, the muted
pinks. It was sailing weather. On Saturday we bought combined tickets
for the Mull ferry and the Mull Railway, the Toytown track between
Craignure and Torosay Castle. Scots are the most grudging of tourists in
their own country, but the return fares -- just under #20 for two adults
and two children -- bought 80 minutes of peerless cruising and three
miles of novelty steaming on a gauge ten-and-a-quarter inches narrow.
Good value, I thought.
The incoming ferry disgorged bemused and sweating holidaymakers whose
island wardrobes had been caught short by the sun, and left the Railway
Pier 20 minutes late -- ''due to the late arrival of the Glasgow
train''. The Oban-Craignure shuttle prides itself on punctuality (by the
time we returned it had recovered the slippage) and the stubby MV Isle
of Mull bombs up to the pier as if towing water-skiers.
If Scots are grudging tourists in their own country they are also
badly informed ones. We knew little of Torosay Castle, but at least we
knew where it was. ''Is this Mull?'' asked an elderly woman, as we
waited to disembark at Craignure. ''Is this where we get the ferry to
Iona?'' She was disconcerted when we told her that the ferry for Iona
was a long bus-ride away on the other side of the island at Fionnphort.
A cheerful Englishman in overalls welcomed us to the Mull Railway,
then climbed into a miniature steam locomotive and drove us to Torosay.
The Maclean stronghold of Duart Castle, sprouting like a fungal growth
from its rock on the point, is Mull's most famous fortress and looks
every inch the vernacular part. Its neighbour at Torosay is much more
recent, but it has a distinguished claim on an innovative style of
domestic architecture. It was designed by David Bryce, father of the
Scottish Baronial, and it's rumoured that Sir Robert Lorimer had a hand
in its heavenly gardens.
Torosay Castle has been owned by the Guthrie family since 1865.
They've had the usual struggle to keep the roof over their heads, and by
1972 the family were faced with the choice of letting Torosay decay or
restoring it for the tourist industry.
But the Guthries' faith in their handsome property has paid off. In
the 20 years since the castle opened to visitors tourism has been the
only growth industry in the Hebrides and Torosay has become one of
Mull's most popular attractions.
The buttery light deepened as we sailed back to Oban with Mull on the
stern, the kingly silhouette of Ben Cruachan on the bow and the mountain
seaboard of Loch Linnhe to port; on the starboard side, a great glitter
of water and scatter of skerries, and the little island group of the
Garvellachs, like a school of whales.
A collective cliche occupies the national psyche when the sun shines
on Scotland: ''If we got weather like this every summer we would never
go anywhere else.'' Some of us would, of course; there is more to
foreign travel than sun-seeking, but we would go, perhaps, more
curiously, less stunned by the heady impact of heat and light. What,
meanwhile, would happen to Scotland ''if we got weather like this every
summer''?
As the MV Isle of Mull squeezed into Oban Bay between the north end of
Kerrera and Dunollie Castle rock I looked at the town, the queenliest of
the Western seaboard, railhead and port, gateway to the Hebrides. A
horrible civic crime was committed when it demolished its Victorian
railway station in 1987, but that apart, time and tourism have been
gentle with Oban.
If we got weather like this every summer it would almost certainly
change for the worse. Scotland -- the bleached and empty beaches of our
islands, the airy spaces of our inland lochs -- is protected by its
weather. Oban has at last authorised a plan to develop the site vacated
by much of its railway station. It involves flats, offices, shops,
library, and -- the dynamic centrepiece -- an indoor carpet bowls
centre.
This is what Scottish weather does for Scottish people, never mind the
tourists. Would we have it otherwise?

GRAMPIAN Television has belatedly granted the majority of its
shareholders voting rights, a move which could render the Aberdeen-based
TV station more vulnerable to takeover bids, writes ROBERT POWELL.
Grampian, which also controls Scot FM radio in the central belt and a
#10m property portfolio, says enfranchisement will smooth the way for
expansion.
But analysts say it also makes the Aberdeen-based company more
vulnerable to takeover.
''You can question now whether it is bid-proof,'' said Bill McCall, of
Tilney stockbrokers in Edinburgh.
He said Grampian could fall prey to UK radio stations expanding into
television or to a foreign TV network seeking a toehold in the UK.
Richard Andrews at Bell Lawrie White said the obvious candidate to buy
Grampian was Scottish Television, which broadcasts to most of central
and southern Scotland.
But Mr McCall said the regulatory authorities would probably veto such
a merger which would create a television network covering nearly all of
Scotland.
Until Wednesday's annual general meeting, Grampian was controlled by a
score of individuals and institutions who held voting Ordinary shares
representing only 4% of the company's capital.
A further 350 held non-voting 'A' shares, which earned dividends, but
did not give them a say in company policy.
The meeting endorsed a board proposal to give all shareholders full
voting rights. Historic holders of voting Ordinary shares received a
three-for-one scrip issue to compensate them for loss of influence.
Chief executive Donald Waters ridiculed suggestions that Grampian had
overnight become more vulnerable to a takeover bid.
''It is a total misconception,'' he said, noting that most other
television companies enfranchised all their shareholders 10 years ago.
Mr Waters stressed instead that shareholder democracy would help
Grampian to expand. ''We are always interested in developing the
broadcasting, radio and property fields, which are those we are already
engaged in,'' he said.
The chief executive said Grampian's best protection against takeover
was to continue its solid economic performance.
''The ultimate protection that we have got is good profits, good
dividends, a good share price and a high market capitalisation,'' he
said, noting that Grampian's market value had risen to #58m from #36m
over the last four months.
Grampian made a respectable #4.4m pre-tax profit on turnover of #21.4m
in the year to February and Mr McCall at Tilney agreed that it was '' a
well managed and very profitable company.''
But he and Mr Andrews insisted that Grampian was more vulnerable to
bids than it had been. They said a jump in the share price after the
enfranchisment plan was announced six weeks ago largely reflected this.
Abtrust and Edinburgh Fund Managers together control about 40% of
television company and their commitment to its continued independence is
questionable.
''The whole point of fund management is that you cash in your chips
from time to time,'' Mr McCall said.
Grampian shares closed up 1[1/2]p at 176p.

HEBRON: Israeli special forces backed by helicopters killed a senior
Hamas Moslem guerrilla in a pre-dawn battle in Hebron. The army said it
killed Taher Qafisheh, 24, at a hide-out on the outskirts of the city, a
hotbed of Muslim militancy in the occupied West Bank.
Army bulldozers razed two nearby houses complete with their furniture
and ploughed up a vineyard after the shoot-out. Soldiers also fired
rockets at a third house in what they said was a hunt for other
guerrillas.
Palestinians called Qafisheh one of the most senior guerrilla leaders
in the West Bank. The army said it had killed three other members of his

As the Lewis Chessmen return to the island where they were discovered,
John Linklater checks the state of play to resolve the stalemate over
their future home, and promises Herald readers a chance to eavesdrop on
the main protagonists
THE Lewis Chessmen have come home. It has been a long exile since the
discovery of the chessboard pieces on the south shore of Uig Bay in
1831. The bulk of the collection was sold for #84 to the British Museum.
They were flown back this week from London and Edinburgh under a
specially negotiated loan which makes them the centrepiece of an
exhibition to mark the opening tonight of the Museum nan Eilean in
Stornoway.
A surprise agreement will also allow the 67 pieces to come out of
their security cases to go into battle over the board for the first time
in at least two centuries. The twelfth-century pieces will be arranged
ceremonially on the board of grandmasters who will take part in the Isle
of Lewis Chess Tournament next month.
For the tournament organisers, the Lewis Chess Club, this is a coup
that even overshadows the attraction of top chess players Nigel Short of
England, Judit Polgar of Hungary (tipped as the first woman who will
compete for the world championship), Simon Adgestein of Norway, and
Scotland's first chess grandmaster, Paul Motwani. They will play in a
grandmaster tourney which is the strongest ever to have been staged in
Scotland, and the prestigious line-up prompted the demand for the use of
the pieces amid growing chess mania in Lewis.
A campaign by Lewis Chess Club led to a meeting last week in London
between local Labour MP Calum Macdonald and Dr Robert Anderson, director
of the British Museum. After facing blanket refusals, the tournament
will now be allowed supervised use of the pieces to open proceedings --
turning the tournament into an international event, such is the
universal recognition of the pieces even beyond the chess world.
It may be the most famous chess hardware in the world, twelfth-century
carvings in walrus ivory of probably Scandinavian origin and of
priceless value, but the organisers will have to overcome a slight
problem. Even with 67 of the surviving 94 pieces from the British Museum
and the National Museums of Scotland, there is not a complete set. The
hoard of pieces is thought to comprise the basis for four separate sets,
but they are several pawns short of even one playing set.
This drawback does not phase former world championship challenger
Nigel Short. From his Athens home he expressed excitement over the
opportunity to sit at the board with pieces he has known since he was
given facsimile Lewis Chessmen as a child learning the game. ''I think
this is quite marvellous,'' he said. ''I just hope I don't break
anything.'' The British Museum's staff will be there to guarantee he and
his fellow grandmasters do not. They will move the pieces, with
kid-glove precautions.
The campaign, backed by the Western Isles Council, will continue to
argue for at least a few of the pieces to remain at the Museum nan
Eilean after tonight's exhibition, Mirean -- Pieces of Our Past,
finishes in October, and the Lewis Chessmen go on loan to Edinburgh.
Western Islands Councillor Calum Iain MacMillan, leader of the
council's Labour Group, maintains that the security and display
capability of the newly rehoused museum in Stornoway makes a solid case
for some of the pieces to remain where they were discovered.
There is strong feeling in Lewis that the current arrangement with the
British Museum means that the island is being loaned part of its own
heritage. They want a permanent return of at least a proportion of the
collection.
Calum Macdonald supports that aspiration, but he refutes any
suggestions of a threat to the security of the pieces in a replica of
the Stone of Destiny seizure of four decades ago. ''It is not even
remotely possible for any bizarre acts to take place,'' he says. ''There
is a strong case for many items to be returned to the Hebrides from
other parts of the United Kingdom and housed in the new museum. That
would be good for the islands, and good for the exhibits.
''And if we show this exhibition is a great success and the pieces are
treated in the best possible way, with lots of people coming to see
them, it will increase the strength of that argument.''
To mark the return on loan of the Lewis Chessmen The Herald, in
association with the Museum nan Eilean and the British Museum, will be
launching an exclusive competition for readers to win a special limited
edition of the Lewis chess set.
On Monday we will be inviting you to imagine eavesdropping on the
bishop, knight and warder (rook) from the set and supply captions of
what they might have been saying to one another. There will be 10
runner-up prizes of a single replica piece along with copies of the
English and Gaelic editions of a new book for children by Irving Finkel,

AFTER an impressive launch to his leadership bid, John Redwood is now
thrashing around for some big new policy idea to boost his campaign's
flagging momentum. The famed Redwood grey cells may be formidable enough
to take All Souls by storm at the age of 21. But, as big ideas go,
pledging to keep the Royal Yacht afloat is not going to ignite even the
most committed royalist among the bedraggled ranks of the parliamentary
Tory party.
This is not, I hasten to add, another thousand words of idle
speculation about who will triumph next Tuesday, the odds on a
second-round contest, or even the chances that the wily old President of
the Board of Trade, who seems to be enjoying himself hugely, will jouk
his way up the middle to snatch the keys to Downing Street.
Despite Redwood's faltering performance, I see little reason to depart
from what I said on Tuesday. Having unlocked the door, by resigning as
party leader and triggering a substantial challenge, John Major is now
at the mercy of several rival teams of tacticians, feverishly working
out the best way to ensure a second-round ballot and through it, a new
Prime Minister.
I am not installing a bank of additional phone lines on my desk in
preparation for the battle to come. Indeed I'm off on holiday this
weekend before the blood really flows. But, before I go, I do want to
look more closely at that other question: big new ideas and whether our
politicians are capable, any longer, of coming up with them.
Of course Redwood has more on his mind than yachts. He wants to target
bureaucratic waste and turn the savings into early tax cuts. And, as
expected, he wants a much more stridently anti-Brussels stance in his
party's European policy, including a permanent no to our rejoining the
ERM or sacrificing the pound to a European single currency. He's said
less about his fundamental belief in markets as the primary means of
allocating resources and meeting needs in any modern society. But then
he's looking for votes from a broader church than just those who share
his unblinking ideological certainties.
None of these is a new idea. Spend less, tax less has been the siren
cry of the Tory party since the seventies, breached as often as
delivered on. We are all ambivalent about paying tax, although we now
collectively commit the equivalent of 3% of total consumers' expenditure
to what is, in effect, a voluntary tax, the National Lottery.
But there is no real national debate about the appropriate balance of
tax and public spending to maintain civilised public services.
Reasserting British sovereignty over Brussels harks back to even older
verities, when the sea, as Michael Portillo is fond of reminding us, was
more clear and blue and much of the globe was British red. Redwood has
summoned up trite images of bulldogs and dachshunds in his strident
reassertion of English nationalism. But we've heard very little from
him, or any other Euro-sceptic, of what impact that platform, if
implemented, would have on Britain as a favoured economic location
within the European Union.
Our ability to attract American and Japanese electronics companies and
car makers to produce their goods here for wider European consumption
has been a major factor in off-setting the progressive collapse of much
of indigenous British industry. Even semi-detachment from the evolving
single European market-place would wreak far more damage to that process
than a dozen regional assemblies in Cardiff, Edinburgh or elsewhere.
Faith in markets is not new either. But, with the Labour leadership
beginning to sing hesitantly from that same hymn sheet, the
Redwood/Portillo wing of the Tory party clearly sees the need to breathe
new -- and differentiating -- life into even more radical market-driven
initiatives, in areas like personal welfare provision. For them, faith
in markets implies little faith in government. Small government is their
stated aim. The smaller, it seems, the better.
But, before we start dismantling more of the apparatus of the state,
as if it were some extension of the Berlin wall, we should again be
debating, in depth and with the utmost seriousness, the capacity of
markets to deliver all that is increasingly expected of them. Let me
mention just two areas where that rational debate is notably absent.
Technology and the environment.
First, technology. All politicians have, belatedly, begun to focus on
the impact of technology-induced unemployment. A new book out today by
Professor Landauer of the University of Colorado raises fresh questions
about, in particular, information technology. It questions whether the
#1000bn spent world-wide over the past 35 years on computers has even
begun to pay for itself in terms of improved productivity.
The market momentum within the computer industry is to sell more and
more powerful machines with an increasingly diverse array of features.
But more and more functions, offered at faster and faster speeds, does
not automatically mean higher and higher productivity. Or more informed
choices. Information overload can trigger irrational behaviour. Remember
Mr Leeson.
We are urged to embrace the information age, because that, we are
told, is the only way we can retain our competitive edge. But if Prof
Landauer is right and the market in information technology isn't yet
properly addressing the issue of how it enhances human productivity, we
should at least be debating the other choices open to us.
On the environment, the Brent Spar affair effectively sidelined the
British Government. The headline-grabbing clash on the high seas between
one of the world's oil majors and Greenpeace was resolved, not through
Government intervention, but by consumers, notably in Germany,
boycotting Shell petrol.
Shell's U-turn may be the right environmental outcome. It may not be.
Greenpeace has no monopoly of environmental wisdom. And there now seems
to be extensive scientific opinion on the other side of the argument.
The lesson is surely that market solutions -- and the outcome of Brent
Spar was very much a market-inspired solution -- are no better at
resolving some major issues, affecting us all, than governments are.

Cape Canaveral, Thursday
ASTRONAUTS and cosmonauts hugged joyfully in space today after the US
shuttle Atlantis docked with the orbiting space station Mir, uniting the
former Cold War adversaries in a new era of co-operation.
It was the first meeting of international spacecraft since July 17,
1975, when Apollo and Soyuz crews joined hands and capsules in orbit for
two days of work together.
Veteran astronaut Robert ''Hoot'' Gibson, the commander of Atlantis,
glided his 100-ton shuttle gently and precisely into a tailor-made port
on the 123-ton Mir at 9am (1300 GMT)
''After 20 years, our spacecraft are docked in orbit again. Our new
era of space exploration has begun,'' shuttle communicator David Wolf
said from Mission Control in Houston, Texas.
''It's great to be back, joined in orbit again,'' Gibson said as the
two craft, travelling at 17,500mph made contact high above Central Asia.
Two hours later, as pressure equalised in the two spacecraft, Gibson
opened the Atlantis hatch. He greeted Mir commander Vladimir Dezhurov in
a tunnel connecting the shuttle to the station and they shook hands
before Gibson led his crew inside.
Over the next few minutes there was a jumble of knees and elbows as
all 10 smiling space flyers -- six Americans and four Russians --
floated through narrow tunnels into the station's core module to pose
for the cameras.
''We will co-operate very successfully in the future,'' Dezhurov said
in Russian. Responding in the same language, Gibson said: ''We will
build a co-operation based on friendship in the future, and this is a
very important step along the way.''
On Earth, Russian and US officials hugged and burst into applause at a
control centre outside Moscow after watching the docking. Yuri Koptev,
director general of the Russian Space Agency, shook the hand of Daniel
Goldin, head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA), and slapped him on the back. Other space officials embraced.
A minimum of pomp surrounded the initial meeting, despite its
historical significance. A mission commentator in Houston said earlier
the two teams would exchange gifts today but officials said the formal
ceremony would be held tomorrow.
Mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar -- who spent a year training to be a
cosmonaut -- stuck a shuttle mission decal to the bulkhead of the Mir
core module.
Koptev and Goldin congratulated the Mir crew, which includes NASA
astronaut Norman Thagard, in a telephone call about 20 minutes after the
two spacecraft docked.
''We started working on this in July of '92, and we've had the formal
wedding of the United States and Russia in space in June of '95,''
Goldin said. ''This has really been an emotional experience for me, and
it's just a wonderful dream come true.''
This mission starts a series of seven shuttle visits which are
scheduled to late 1997. The shuttle flights constitute the first phase
of a broader, $30 billion US programme of space co-operation with
Russia, Europe, Canada and Japan.
''What we witnessed today is the beginning of the assembly of the
international space station,'' NASA's Wilbur Trafton said in a news
conference broadcast from Mission Control.--Reuter.

KYRENIA: AN angry crowd of Turkish Cypriots used sticks to try to
attack three people accused of starting a huge forest fire that has
devastated the north of the island. Local reports said the three were
foreigners.
The crowd attacked a police car taking them to court in the holiday
town of Kyrenia, where the fire damaged villas and crops. The suspects
were bundled into the court and remanded in custody for three days.
Three other people have also been arrested.
The blaze started on Tuesday night near the village of Malatya and has
reduced over 27 sq miles of forest and farmland to ash. At least 10
people have been injured.
''There is utter devastation. Fuel dumps east of Kyrenia were
exploding,'' said one witness. Winds up to 45 mph fanned the flames at
the height of the inferno which burned a black swathe across the land,
destroying pine and cypress forests, vinyards and orchards.

Sarajevo, Thursday
THE president of the Bosnian federation, Kresimir Zubak, said today
that the new European rapid reaction force would have to leave Bosnia if
its mission was not clarified within 30 days.
Zubak, a Croat, has objected to large numbers of new troops setting up
to train in Croat-held western Bosnia, without first explaining their
mission or seeking permission from the federation for their presence.
The federation unites Muslims and Croats in the 30% of Bosnia not held
by Serbs. It was proclaimed in Washington 15 months ago after
US-brokered negotiations to stop fighting between Croats and Moslems.
Zubak's ultimatum came as diplomats and politicians debated the
purpose of the 12,000-strong Franco-British-Dutch force, sent to salvage
the United Nations' mission in Bosnia.
He stressed that a foreign strike force coming to Bosnia was obliged
to deploy on Serb-held territory as well as Croat-held. His point
reflected Muslim and Croat hopes that the force might be used to take on
their better-armed Serb adversary in combat, something UN officials have
ruled out.
US officials admitted they had little idea what the mandate of the new
force would be, and said it might not go beyond that of existing UN
peacekeeping troops.
Washington hopes that the force might respond more vigorously to
obstruction from the Bosnian Serbs than the UN force, UNPROFOR, has done
in the past are evidently fading.
Yesterday, the Bosnian government told the UN the inaction of its
troops in the face of Bosnian Serb attacks had forced it to review
whether to allow the peacekeepers to remain in the country.
Sporadic shelling echoed around Sarajevo early today but guns were
fairly muted compared to yesterday's big blasts.
Police and hospital sources said one person was killed and nine
injured by shelling and sniping attacks.
Two mortar bombs hit the Serb-besieged city in the morning, one in a
western suburb and one in the city centre.
An apartment was hit in the suburb of Alipasino Pollje and later a
rocket fell near the city's television centre, leaving a huge hole in
the pavement and throwing rubble across a four-lane road.
The rocket landed yards away from where two similar devices killed
five people yesterday.
UN officials, who condemned the use of the makeshift weapons as
barbaric, said the bombs had a 500 lb rocket-propelled warhead with a
small parachute to guide their descent. They believed the weapons were
fired from Serb-held suburbs in the west of the city.
A French UN peacekeeper was killed by a mine explosion as he helped
move barbed wire from the path of his armoured vehicle, a UN spokesman
said. Two others were injured by the blast.
Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey told the Security Council in
a letter yesterday that the Bosnian government planned a formal review
on the future of UN troops in the country.--Reuter.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang will be petitioned by his own staff later
today over job cuts at the Scottish Office.
A rally has been organised at St Andrew's House in Edinburgh by trade
unions to draw attention to the potential problems of a freeze in the
budget.
The unions have calculated that there will be 1000 fewer Scottish
Office jobs over the next three years.
Union spokesman Robin McKendrick said he hoped the Secretary of State
would take account of a petition from his own staff and would tell
whoever was the next Prime Minister that the Civil Service had had
enough.
He said the pressures on staff were now so severe that further cuts
could affect the health of employees. The incidence of stress-related
illness was rising and morale had slumped.

DEEDEE CUDDIHY sets University of Glasgow students the task of finding
the cream of the crop in upmarket frozen delights
STRANGE, isn't it, that some of the coldest countries in Europe are
also the ones where the most ice-cream is consumed. Sweden, with 12
litres a year per head of population, comes top of the list, followed by
Denmark (7.9 litres) and then the United Kingdom where we get through
7.1 litres of the stuff per person annually.
During the period 1986-1991, ice-cream eating in the UK more than
doubled and the most recent figures put our yearly bill for consumption
of lollies, cones, tubs and so on at #763m.
When there's that much money to be made, it's no wonder ice-cream
manufacturers currently spend more than #20m per annum trying to
persuade us to buy their products.
Increasingly visible these days are the ice-creams which have been
variously described as luxury, premium or even super-premium, and whose
makers are slugging it out among themselves for a share of a specialised
but lucrative market.
Ben &amp; Jerry's, an American product, is the latest to enter the
designer ice-cream fray in Britain. The company's founders, Ben Cohen
and Jerry Greenfield, made a whistle-stop tour of Britain last month and
visited several stockists in Glasgow and Edinburgh along the way.
We included a carton of B &amp; J brand in a taste test of upmarket
ice-creams carried out at Glasgow University's Student Representative
Council offices.
To see whether any of the testers could tell the difference, we also
included a tub of Walls' Gino Ginelli toffee fudge ice-cream.
The testers were Gordon, Tanya, Lucinda, Chris, Jacqui and Diane, who
had to leave halfway through and was replaced by Andrew.
First into the super hygienic plastic serving bowls was Ben &amp; Jerry's
which all our testers had heard of but had not yet tried.
The products tested were:
* Cream o' Galloway chocolate orange, made in Scotland, 500ml for
#2.75 (#5.50 per litre).
* Thorntons butter maple brazil, made in England, 750ml for #2.99
(#3.99 per litre).
* Mackie's honeycomb crunch, made in Scotland, 500ml for #2.29 (#4.58
per litre).
* Haagen-Dazs pralines and cream (said to be the company's most
popular flavour after vanilla), made in France, 500ml for #3.59 (#7.18
per litre).
* Ben &amp; Jerry's chocolate chip cookie dough, made in the US, 473ml for
#3.60 (#7.50 per litre).
* Walls' Gino Ginelli toffee fudge, made in England, one litre for
#1.99.
BEN &amp; JERRY'S
Gordon -- Lovely texture. I like the big lumps of chocolate and
whatever the other stuff is called.
Tanya -- Superb. Better than Haagen-Dazs.
Chris -- This is sexier than Haagen-Dazs.
Jacqui -- Super. Just the thing for a treat if you're having a night
in.
Diane -- Superb.
(Lucinda had temporarily disappeared).
MACKIE'S:
Tanya -- Very sickly. You couldn't eat a lot of it.
Lucinda -- Don't like this. It's far too sweet.
Gordon -- Very creamy. It needs to be eaten with something . . . like
strawberries.
Diane -- Doesn't taste much like honey and there's no crunch.
Jackie -- Mackie's vanilla is my favourite ice-cream and I love this,
too.
Chris -- Very creamy and not very interesting.
THORNTONS:
Lucinda -- I don't usually like nuts but this is nice.
Diane -- Lovely. Nice and creamy.
Gordon -- Not as nice as the Ben &amp; Jerry's.
Tanya -- I'm not that keen on this one.
Jacqui -- Bit rich for me; too sickly.
Chris -- I like the smell and the texture.
CREAM O' GALLOWAY:
Lucinda -- Absolutely delicious. The perfect ice-cream, and I like the
tiny bits of orange peel in it.
Jacqui -- Love it; 14 out of 10.
Andrew (taken over from Diane) -- Don't like it.
Tanya -- Awful. The sort of ice-cream you'd be offered at the theatre
when they'd run out of everything else.
Gordon -- I don't usually like chocolate ice-cream but this is lovely.
Chris -- Bit of a non-event.
HAAGEN-DAZS:
Lucinda -- Really yucky.
Jacqui -- Disappointing, especially compared to Ben &amp; Jerry's.
Gordon -- Disappointing. It doesn't live up to its adverts or
reputation.
Andrew -- Great, especially the nuts. I could eat a whole tub of it.
Chris -- Too sweet.
Tanya -- Very nice. Much better than the Thorntons nutty one.
WALLS' GINO GINELLI:
Tanya -- Very synthetic and marshmallowy.
Jacqui -- You've saved the worst till last.
Gordon -- I like the chunks of toffee and it's good for the price, in
fact, this has been one of my favourites in the past, but it's not as
nice as the more expensive ones.
Andrew -- Synthetic and sickly with an unpleasant texture.
Chris -- They may call it ice-cream but it doesn't taste like it's
been anywhere near a cow. (Contains skimmed milk, in fact, but no actual
cream).
Lucinda -- An explosion of chemicals. I don't like it at all.
Three of our testers liked Ben &amp; Jerry's the best (which was the most
expensive) while the remaining three cast a vote each for Cream o'
Galloway, Mackie's and Haagen-Dazs.

Summer conjures up images of bronzed bodies, but for many the
preferred way to achieve a tan is from a bottle. Anvar Khan puts
self-tanning lotions to the test
THE overall results were not good. In fact, the whole operation went
from bad to worse. Self-tanning, as you know, is a vital ritual in skin
care, especially for women who live in a country where the sun is a
newspaper.
There are not many different colours for fake tans. They come in
Irn-Bru or whisky. Some of the women who took part in this consumer test
to find the best self-tanning product on offer, are currently being
treated for stress and discolouration. We knew things were bad when one
tester returned to the office in opaque tights.
Self-tanning products contain dihydroxyacetone (DHA) a chemical which
reacts with the skin's top layer to form a tinted stain, which does not
disembark until the top layer begins to flake. Information which, if
included on the back of the products themselves would have avoided
unnecessary worry. Almost all the female testers decided to apply the
tanning creams at night and expressed concern about pristine bedclothes.
Teabags in the bath, however, still seem to be the cheapest way of
acquiring colour. The teabags dye the skin. The more teabags you put in
the stronger the tan will be.

''The instructions are useless rubbish, but it's lovely on, just like
applying moisturiser. Instead of putting it on evenly I put it on in
stripes to get it straight. Not having ever tried anything like this
before I think the result was very reasonable for what I did. I went to
my bed, I did it that late, and thought it would come off on the sheets.
If you are going to self-tan you want something simple like this. I'm
going to try it again. It smells nice, but the bottle needs to have more
instructions, like, don't drink this.''

''It says exfoliate and have a hot bath before use. I didn't have a
hot bath but I shaved my legs and put hot cloths on them. I shook the
spray and big globulets came out, splodgy bits went onto my leg. The
lotion is clear, but I am now living proof that it does not spray
easily. It's horrible, overnight the bits of my skin the lotion hit went
orange. (Annie has drip stains on her leg.) I had to wash the entire
bathroom down. I had the carpets covered in newspaper because I knew I'd
be spraying. I'd recommend this product to absolutely no-one. Perhaps
it'd be alright if you practiced on walls first. It didn't give me an
even colour. Self-tans are not worth the effort if they only lasts two
to four days. I'd rather stay pale or, in this case, pink with
embarrassment.''

''I think #8.50 is reasonable for this product, Clarins, for example,
is #17. It smells nice, not of watermelon, however, but honeydew. It
took ages to dry in. I put it on at 9.30pm and I was going to bed at 11
but it still felt slippy. I only applied one coat but it made my legs
feel nice and smooth. The colour is translucent. If you have lots of
time it's good, it's not an apply and go product. I'd buy it for the
colour, but I'd make sure I did it at 6pm and put two coats on. The
packaging is standard Body Shop. What you see is what you get. The
condition and colour of this product is good but the greasiness is
uncomfortable.''

two hours for the colour to show. But it was orangey. The instructions
say to put more on to change the colour so I did. I woke up in the
morning and my legs were dark brown with white streaks on the thighs. It
was not a good result and I would never buy it.''

''Coty is paint with the texture of diesel, but it doesn't pretend to
be anything else. Strictly apply, enjoy, and wash off with soap and
water. It dries in seconds, but it's lethal on the hands and fabric of
clothes, so it's best to put it on while naked and in proximity to a
sink. There's a fair amount of panic involved. The sight of a tube
squirt of dark brown pigeon dropping on the pale and delicate palm
effectively frightens the user into rubbing legs quickly and all over,
as if applying cream. As it washes off easily, mistakes can be rectified
as the results are instant.''

<HEADLINE>Sacking of newspaper accountant is upheld</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A NEWSPAPER accountant lost his job after a suicide note from a
colleague revealed how they had played the stock market on borrowed
money.
An industrial tribunal has ruled that newspaper and publishing group,
Johnston Press plc, did not dismiss the accountant unfairly.
Mr Morrison Zuill, of Camelon Road, Falkirk, had joined Johnston
(Falkirk) Ltd in March 1987 as its company secretary/accountant. Two
years later, he was transferred to the Edinburgh head office of Johnston
Press plc as assistant to finance director Marco Chiapelli.
The head office staff of nine oversee the activities of 80 UK
newspaper titles with a #90m annual turnover. In his role as Mr
Chiapelli's assistant, Mr Zuill was aware of 98% of what was happening
in the company.
The tribunal noted: ''Much of that information, which included
information on takeovers and disposals which was extremely sensitive,
was confidential.''
After Mr Zuill was transferred to Edinburgh, his job in Falkirk was
filled by chartered accountant Gary Forbes.
Both men had invested in new stock market issues for a number of years
and both invested in the 1992 PowerGen issue. Mr Forbes did not have
sufficient money to buy all the shares he required and borrowed the
balance from Mr Zuill, later repaying the loan.
The following year, Mr Zuill again loaned Mr Forbes money to buy
shares in ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro and was again repaid.
Mr Forbes then suggested to Mr Zuill that he might want to use his
stockbrokers to benefit from share placings not generally available to
the general public.
Mr Zuill verbally agreed with Mr Forbes to finance the share placings,
with Mr Forbes paying his overdraft interest. As Mr Forbes was the
broker's client, all the placings were in his name.
In 1994, disciplinary warnings were issued to Mr Forbes for ''failing
to meet targets'' and he was given a final written warning in September
of which Mr Zuill was not aware.
On November 22, 1994, Mr Forbes did not turn up for work and Mr Zuill
was told to go to Falkirk, where he found the cash book had not been
written up since the previous July.
It was then discovered that Mr Forbes had left two suicide notes, one
to his wife and the other to company credit controller David Edmonds.
The letter also referred to the sale of the shares for which Mr Zuill
had obtained a #45,000 overdraft to buy. At one stage, the tribunal
noted, the overdraft had reached #70,000.
Police were called in and carried out an investigation.
Mr Zuill had explained that he had received nothing in writing from Mr
Forbes as he trusted him as a fellow chartered accountant.
However, after speaking to his chairman and managing director, Mr
Chiapelli decided he had lost confidence in Mr Zuill and asked for his
resignation.
In exchange for the resignation, Mr Zuill was given a #25,000 cheque
and a company car.
At the tribunal in Glasgow, the firm admitted constructively sacking
Mr Zuill but claimed it was not an unfair dismissal.

* THE director of the National Association of Health Authorities and
Trusts has welcomed the ''pragmatic'' approach of Labour's health
policy. Philip Hunt told the association's annual conference in Glasgow,
attended by 1700 senior managers and chairmen, that the proposals took
up the direction in which the NHS was already headed.
Hunt said the key thing for his members was that Labour would retain
the separation between health authorities and the operational management
of hospitals.
''We think the purchaser-provider split has given greater clarity to
what we are about, so that health authorities concentrate on long-term
planning and hospitals concentrate on improving the way they do things.
That has been a great improvement.
''There are a lot of questions about the policy as well. One is about
how much operational freedom the NHS trusts or their successors will
have in future. Will it be sufficient to continue to put pressure on
trusts to improve their efficiency and innovate?''
Hunt pointed out that the NHS had gone through a revolution during the
past five years and now needed stability.
''It has put us under enormous pressure. The last thing we want is a
leap into the unknown. You have to read between the lines in their
policy, but I think what they have adopted is a pragmatic line based on
what is there.''

AN inmate at a women's prison was put on suicide watch just days after
two teenagers were discovered hanged in their cells there, a court heard
yesterday.
Anne Dodds, 23, faced charges of assault, theft, and two charges of
breach of the peace at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court.
Her lawyer, Mr Allan Kerr, described how his client had found one of
the women hanged in her cell at Cornton Vale and pleaded with the
sheriff not to send her back.
Dodds, of Kirkhall Gardens, Ardrossan, was sentenced to 200 hours
community service, put on probation for two years, and ordered to
undertake special counselling.
The deaths of Kelly Holland and Arlene Elliot, both 17, are being
investigated by police. Fatal accident inquiries will be held.
Dodds watched as prison staff cut down the body she had discovered and
carried it out of the room, the court was told.
The two events had traumatised her. She had hallucinations and had to
be detained in a special observation unit within the prison.
She had been detained at Cornton Vale since May 18 while social
workers compiled a report for the court.
Mr Kerr described his client's first time in prison as 'traumatic''.
Mr Kerr said: ''She was first on the scene on one occasion. She knew
the girl and walked in to find her hanging there.
''She found jail very difficult to deal with and is now on three
different types of medication, including anti-depressants and a
sedative.
''When left on her own for the first time since the suicide, she had
hallucinations and was moved to a special unit, herself considered a
suicide risk.''

WITH only three months left before the #23m Skye bridge is due to
open, there is still no agreement between the Government and its public
transport watchdog body on whether the Kyle of Lochalsh ferry can be
withdrawn without public consultation, including a public inquiry.
Labour's Shadow Transport Minister Henry McLeish promised last night
to try to find out the exact legal position as other communites might
depend on it in the future.
Nobody believes that the ferry service operated by the
Government-owned Caledonian MacBrayne will run in competition to the
bridge. All the calculations for the privately financed toll bridge have
been based on the service ceasing the day the bridge opens.
The debate is whether it would be legal to withdraw it without the
normal public consultation procedures being followed and it is unlikely
they could be completed before the bridge's likely opening in September.
At issue is the sole right of the Railways Users Consultative Committee
for Scotland to call a public inquiry into a proposed withdrawal.
This right was exercised without challenge by the RUCCS's predecessor
body, the Scottish Transport Users Consultative Committee. That was
replaced with the RUCCS by the 1993 Railways Act. Despite the name
change, which was resisted by the STUCC, the RUCCS retained a remit over
Scottish ferry services.
No ferry service, however has been withdrawn since and therefore the
right to call a public inquiry remains untested. Under normal procedures
the proposed withdrawal would be advertised, inviting representations.
If there were sufficient, a public inquiry would be called.
According to Herald sources, there had been an earlier acceptance
within the Scottish Office that RUCCS still retained that right but that
''. . . political considerations now hold sway and there won't be an
inquiry''.
These considerations include the embarrassment of the ferry still
running for weeks, or perhaps several months, having promised the bridge
developers it would cease on day one; the effect on the financial
calculations; and having to hold a farce of a public inquiry which would
simply serve as a forum for the vociferous opponents of the bridge.
At the end of March, the Scottish Office declared: ''The matter is far
from straightforward and is currently being considered by the RUCCS and
the Ministry of Transport. We believe the RUCCS still has a general
power to consider any matter affecting ferry services or facilities
provided by Caledonian MacBrayne, which of course would involve the
withdrawal of a service.''
This week, however, its official position had changed: ''Both the
Scottish Office and the Ministry of Transport has advised the RUCCS that
we believe it does not have a statutory right to call a public inquiry.
We do not know if they accept that or not, there has been no comeback.''
However, Mr Lawrence Kemp, chairman of the RUCCS, told The Herald that
his committee didn't accept that position and had written back for
clarification.
Mr Kemp said he believed the withdrawal of that right would undermine
seriously the RUCCS's ability to reflect the public view of any future
ferry withdrawal.

PLANS to build what has been described as a mock cathedral in the
foreground of the western aspect of Stirling Castle were cleared last
night.
Members of Stirling District Council approved the controversial
building -- corporate headquarters for an English drugs company, Scotia
Pharmaceuticals.
The unanimous vote ignored renewed criticism from the Scottish
Office's ancient monuments arm, Historic Scotland.
Not a single councillor commented.
The Secretary of State, Mr Ian Lang, now has 28 days to decide whether
to call in the application. If he does not, planning consent will be
formally issued.
Architects for Scotia and the developers, Central Regional Council,
drew up their original scheme with changes after a number of protests.
They agreed to lop a little over three feet off a controversial tower
-- originally intended to be 70ft -- and reduce most of the planned
headquarters from three to two storeys.
Despite the concession, Historic Scotland said the building would be
out of scale and out of place.
In a formal submission, the organisation said: ''Historic Scotland
considers that although an effort has been made to reduce the impact of
the central tower, the sheer volume and structural concentration of such
a sizeable complex on this sensitive site, forming part of the setting
of the castle, is entirely inappropriate.''
The Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland, which coined the ''mock
cathedral'' description in earlier submissions, called for a complete
change of philosophy.
The Scottish Civic Trust and Stirling Civic Trust also maintained
their objections.
Stirling District Council's head of planning, Ms Sheila Terry,
admitted: ''All the amenity bodies remain opposed to the scheme. However
. . . it is the officers' view that, on balance, in view of the
importance of the proposal to the local and national economy, it should
now be approved and the Secretary of State informed of the decision.''
Scotia maintains that the development could bring 500 to 1000 jobs.

A PENSIONER'S 10-stone crossbred rottweiler-alsatian, which turned the
area around its home into a ''no-go'' zone for local residents, must be
put down, three appeal court judges ruled yesterday.
The court was told that the dog's owner, Mr Ted Anton, 75, was the
subject of a court order passed in 1992, to keep the massive dog under
proper control.
However, in January this year, it launched a frenzied attack on an
elderly Shetland collie being walked by its owner in the village of
Blanefield, Stirlingshire. The collie was so badly savaged it had to be
put down.
In April this year, Sheriff Charles Palmer decided the five-year-old
dog, called Kruger, should suffer the same fate, when Mr Anton, of
Station House, Station Road, Blanefield, appeared before him at Stirling
Sheriff Court.
Mr Anton pleaded guilty to failing to comply with the original order
that he keep his dog under proper control. The dog was granted a
temporary reprieve pending an appeal.
Yesterday, Mr Alan Muir, counsel for Mr Anton, pointed out at the
Justiciary Appeal Court that for two-and-half years after the 1992 court
order the dog had caused no trouble.
Lord Sutherland, who heard the appeal with Lords Weir and Murray,
replied: ''That's because residents regarded the vicinity as a no-go
area.''
The appeal court took the view that the sheriff had taken entirely the
correct decision.
Mr Anton, who lives on his own, said last night that he understood
Kruger would have to be destroyed within the next week. ''I'm absolutely
heartbroken at the decision. I've had Kruger for seven years, and he has
been like part of the family.''

ELIZABETH Hurley, girlfriend of actor Hugh Grant, spoke last night for
the first time of her pain over his arrest for alleged lewd conduct in
Hollywood.
Ms Hurley, 29, said: ''I am still bewildered and saddened by recent
events and have not been in a fit state to make any decisions about the
future.
''For years, I have turned to Hugh for help during difficult times and
so now, even though my family and friends have been very kind, I am very
much alone.
''This is all very painful for me and if members of the press could
find it in their hearts to give me some time to think, I would be very
grateful.''
Grant, 34, star of hit film Four Weddings and a Funeral, was arrested
in Hollywood for an alleged sex act with prostitute Divine Brown in his
BMW car. Both have now been formally charged with lewd conduct.
Brown, 23, a mother of two, was in hiding, despite ''wanted'' posters
all over Hollywood and a reward being offered for her story.
Journalist William Cash, a friend of the couple, said of Grant: ''I
understand he has caught a plane to the New York area. He will want to
meet Elizabeth but a lot of it is to do with the logistics of how to,
without people knowing.
''They are looking to go somewhere away from the press. There are
places where they go to, special places where they meet. I can think of
one or two spots, one is outside Britain and the other is outside
London.''
The actor has said nothing since apologising for his ''insane''
behaviour after his arrest on Tuesday night.
Miss Hurley spent the day promoting a new perfume with beauty editors
and writers.
She admitted to taking some comfort food. ''You must forgive me on a
day like today for some unmodel-like behaviour. I have just had a couple
of glasses of Champagne and a slice of chocolate cake.''
After almost two hours, she emerged into the London sunshine.
Nearly 100 members of the media were waiting outside the hotel in
Belgravia.
As she was driven off, around 12 photographers followed her car on
motor cycles.
Reporters and photogra phers have been camped outside the London home
of Hurley's friend Lord Henry Brocklehurst in Holland Park, where she
has stayed for the past two nights. Grant's case is due in court in Los
Angeles on July 12 and he has hired lawyer Howard Weitzman, who helped
Michael Jackson clear his name after child sex abuse allegations.
Conviction carries a maximum six months' prison sentence but a fine
and possibly community service is often given.
Friends blame Grant's lapse on exhaustion amid a punishing schedule of
promoting his new film, Nine Months, including more than 40 interviews
on the day of the incident.

PLANS for a ferry link between Scotland and Northern Ireland have
taken a major step forward with a #1.3m funding package from the
European Union.
It is part of a package of further EU assistance under the Highlands
and Islands Objective One Programme, announced yesterday by Highlands
and Islands Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.
Argyll and the Islands Enterprise said the timetable for development
work on the Campbeltown to Ballycastle ferry service could now be firmed
up, now that the money had been approved.
The project is expected to unlock hundreds of new jobs in Kintyre and
open up a new trading route for commercial and tourist traffic between
Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Mrs Ray Michie, MP for Argyll and Bute, welcomed the announcement that
the ferry had been approved to start in May 1996 and called on the
Scottish Office to rethink its plans to de-trunk the A816 and A828 roads
which link Campbeltown to the rest of the north and west of Scotland.
AIE, part of the Highlands and Islands Enterprise network, is to
invest around #1.5m in the harbour redevelopment needed at Campbeltown.
Its support has levered #1.3m from the Highlands and Islands Objective
One Partnership.
AIE chief executive David McIntyre said: ''The service has the
potential to unlock major opportunities for jobs and prosperity in
Kintyre, which has been hard hit by the mothballing of the Machrihanish
airbase. Tourism is one industry which stands to gain but the route
would also open up a channel for all types of companies in Scotland
seeking a quick connection into Irish markets.''
Mr Iain Robertson, chief executive of HIE, said: ''This is one of the
most exciting current projects for the HIE network with tremendous
potential.''
Work will involve construction of a terminal, installation of a
roll-on, roll-off linkspan, and berthing facilities, access roads, and
creation of car parking at Campbeltown.
Two operators have expressed firm interest in running the proposed
Campbeltown-Ballycastle route and AIE has funded exploratory engineering
works.
A recent consultant's report, commissioned by AIE and Moyle District
Council, suggested local economies could be boosted by more than #10m.
Ferries would carry between 50 and 60 vehicles and up to 400
passengers on a two-hour crossing. The service would run twice a day in
summer and once a day in the winter. Commercial traffic is expected to
guarantee a year-round operation, with tourism forming the bulk of
summer trade.
According to the Minister, this now brings the overall value of the
package, when project sponsors' contributions are included, to #105m to
date.
Orkney Islands Council, meanwhile, will receive #115,000 for the
creation of an Archaeological Centre at Skaill Bay, while #336,000 is
awarded to Ullapool Harbour Trustees towards the cost of re-fendering
works.
Scalloway Youth Centre Trust will benefit from a #99,500 award towards
Scalloway waterfront.

THE general manager of Dumfries and Galloway Health Board, Mr Derek
Banks, has denied attempting to pervert the course of justice by
claiming that his wife was driving a car involved in a crash.
At Kirkcudbright Sheriff Court a husband and wife both identified Mr
Banks as the driver of the car involved in the collision with their Ford
Granada near Gatehouse of Fleet last November.
Mr Banks, 47, and his wife, Pauline, 42, of Maxwell House, Corsock,
Castle Douglas, deny pretending to two police officers that Mrs Banks
was driving the car, and intending to pervert the course of justice.
Mr Banks also denies driving without due care and attention on the
B727 Dalbeattie-Gatehouse of Fleet road at the junction with Cally Road.
The charge alleges that he failed to failed to comply with a give way
sign, resulting in the collision with a car driven by Mr Vincent Kelly.
Mr Kelly, 55, of High Street, Gatehouse of Fleet, told how he was
nearly home just after 11pm when he saw the lights and a car emerge from
the Cally Road. The car came right out and made contact with his
vehicle, although he had braked violently.
''I got out and went over and said to the man 'Are you drunk or daft
or what, coming out of there at speed and not stopping','' he told the
trial before Sheriff James Smith.
He added that he saw Mr Banks driving as the car came out of the road.
Mrs Florence Kelly, 51, told how a car just came straight out in front
of them. ''I was able to see the driver. It was a man,'' she said and
identified Mr Banks, as her husband had done earlier in the trial.
Constable Brian Bruton, 25, said that Mr Banks, the first person he
had met at the crash scene, said his wife had been driving, and she had
also made a statement to this effect and they had maintained this
throughout.
The constable also told the court that both Mr and Mrs Banks had been
given a breath test at the scene and both had been positive, but both
had easily passed the Camic test breath machine later.
The trial was adjourned for a week.

WATER supplies were being seriously depleted in some parts of Scotland
last night as hosepipes and sprinklers doused the heatwave at its peak.
Although reservoir levels remained ''comfortable'' in all areas, water
boards reported some communities had been left dry for several hours as
the demands of gardeners exceeded the capacity of local storage tanks
and pipes.
Glasgow, usually miles wetter, reached to the top of Scotland's
temperature charts, recording 29.6C (85F), the highest since July 1983.
While Scotland is now expected to cool over the weekend, Glasgow
Weather Centre predicted that south and central areas could still expect
temperatures of 24C and that it would remain ''warm and dry'' for at
least another week.
However, sunbathers were urged to show restraint after a middle-aged
man died after being found sunburnt and unconscious on one of Britain's
most celebrated naturist beaches at Fairlight Glen, East Sussex,
yesterday.
Accident and emergency consultant at Glasgow's Western Infirmary, Mr
Patrick Grant, warned: ''People can basically overheat during acute
exposure to the sun. The control mechanism which regulates body
temperature stops coping and when exposure is accompanied by fluid loss
there can be a loss of consciousness.
''You enter a state where cells and muscles break down and major
organs, particularly the heart and brain, are seriously affected.''
Not all of Scotland felt the heat yesterday. Though thermometers sat
in the mid 20s in Lothian, breezy conditions left Aberdeen and coastal
Fife languishing at 15C. Rain was reported in Orkney and Fair Isle,
while Cape Wrath in north- west Scotland was under fog cover at 10C.
Dumfries and Galloway reported the worst of the water problems, with
the residents of Machars Peninsula near Newton Stewart cut off over
Wednesday night when a burst main compounded local supply shortages.
A council spokesperson said: ''People just run hoses into their
gardens thinking if the water is coming out there is no problem, while
other people end up suffering for their rose beds.''
She added that farmers on hillside areas had been the worst affected.
Angus, Carmyllie, and West Hills experienced breaks in the water
supply, while Fife Regional Council said they were ''very worried''
about supply to the Kinross and Milnathort area.
Helicopter firefighters dropped water bombs on a forest fire in the
Highlands. The blaze, which fanned through 10 acres of scrub, started
when whins caught fire at Whitebridge above Loch Ness and spread across
a road into a forest.
Local foresters joined two Inverness fire units and volunteers from
Fort Augustus and Foyers in containing the outbreak.
Winter gritter lorries spreading sand were also called out in the
region at a cost of #6000, as the sun melted road surfaces. A council
spokesman said: ''With temperatures in the 80s, cars are ripping up the
tarmac and damaging the roads and we are trying to ease the damage by
putting a skin of sand down.''
Meanwhile, motorists near Portsmouth were handed free ice cream by
police after a lorry containing three tonnes of lollies and choc ices
overturned on the A27.

SOLO round-the-world sailor Lisa Clayton told yesterday how she used a
string of pearls to make running repairs during her record 31,000-mile
voyage.
The 36-year-old, who arrived in Dartmouth, south Devon, this morning
after 286 days alone at sea, described how she used the jewellery after
surviving a battering from a storm in the Southern Ocean.
Her 39ft craft, Spirit of Birmingham, capsized and rolled over twice
during the gale, badly damaging the electricity generator which she
towed behind the boat.
Its batteries were vital for the yacht's communications and other
electronics, and was badly in need of new bearings.
''I sat there for two hours, and suddenly remembered a pearl necklace
which had been given to me,'' she said. ''Four of them were just the
right size, and I was working on it for about six hours.''
The Devon skies were deep blue yesterday as she basked in the
attention after sailing into the record books. She is the first woman to
achieve a solo non-stop unaided circumnavigation from the northern
hemisphere.
Ms Clayton, from the Midlands, said her welcome from people at the
port and from friends and relatives was ''fantastic'', especially after
her long isolation.
She set off from Dartmouth last September 17 and as she crossed the
finishing line off the port yesterday she was greeted by a flotilla of
around 40 pleasure craft.
When she finally climbed ashore, she was met by mother Gwen and father
Dan. ''We are immensely proud of her and tremendously thankful she is
back with us again,'' said her father.
Among the plaudits for her feat was the offer of an honorary degree of
Doctor of Science from Birmingham University.

A ROMAN Catholic priest has been removed from his church after claims
that he ''inappropriately touched'' two teenage boys.
Father Gerry Fitzsimmons, 36, of St Peter's Church in Livingston, West
Lothian, has been sent to a clinic in Birmingham for counselling.
Two boys, aged 16 and 18, complained to their parents about his
conduct and they took their sons to see detectives at Livingston.
The alleged incident happened three months ago but has only now come
to light. A church spokesman yesterday confirmed that Father Fitzsimmons
would probably never be a parish priest again.
Father Tom Connolly said: ''Our responsibilities lie, obviously, with
the boys. It is our policy to immediately remove any priest from his
post when allegations such as this are made.
''If we are advised by the counselling centre that any priest in these
circumstances should not be given another church then we would follow
that advice.
''It looks as if that is what will happen in Father Fitzsimmons' case
but he may get a job in administration or something like that. He is on
leave of absence now, at an independent medical counselling centre.''
A Lothian and Borders police spokesman said: ''These were two
completely separate incidents occurring several months apart. The boys
came to us with their parents and complained of being touched
inappropriately.
''They all appear to be devout church-goers. We advised them of their
options and they went away to think about which course of action to
take.
''So far no formal legal complaint has been made. Our officers are
still in contact with the families.''
Father Fitzsimmons had been at St Peter's Church for six months before
the allegations were made. Before that, he was an assistant parish
priest in Armadale for several years.
In Livingston yesterday, a church official at St Peter's said his
removal from the church had come as a shock. He said the church, in the
Carmondean area of Livingston, was a very active one which had a large
congregation.

INTERNATIONAL communications giant Motorola, which has taken over
Digital Equipment Corporation's facility at South Queensferry, yesterday
promised a #16m investment at the plant, as a result of the burgeoning
electronics market in the near future.
Motorola, which claims it is the leading semiconductor and
communications manufacturer worldwide, already employs 5000 at locations
in East Kilbride, Easter Inch, and Livingston.
The South Queensferry plant which it has now acquired employs 500 and
details will be given there today by Mr Jim Norling, its president with
responsibility for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, on the way ahead
for the complex.
Motorola's takeover is being regarded as a coup within the
communications industry, amid the explosion of micro-chip investment in
which Digital also has been at the forefront, producing equipment for
use in cellular telephones and smart cards.
The company said yesterday that expansion of the newly acquired site
was a strong possibility, where there was space available.
It was also indicated that jobs will be safeguarded at South
Queensferry.
Mr Stuart Forbes, director of operations for Motorola Scotland, said:
''The transition from Digital to Motorola will require flexibility and
commitment from us all.
''There will be substantial investment in training and benchmarking to
achieve the operational performance commensurate with business targets.
''Having established our operational performance, I anticipate that
South Queensferry is likely to be the site of further growth by the
company. The future is optimistic.''
Mr Norling added that Scotland had been an extremely successful
location for his company over the past 25 years and praised the quality
of a workforce which had helped it achieve a quality of service and
product demanded by its customers.
The move was praised yesterday by Professor Donald MacKay, chairman of
Scottish Enterprise. ''This move will bring benefits to the local
workforce in becoming part of an organisation which places a high value
on training and the achievement of quality,'' he said.

THE first profoundly deaf student to train as a teacher in Scotland
graduated from St Andrew's College in Bearsden, Glasgow yesterday.
Mr Gerald Hughes, 38, realised a 15-year ambition to complete his
one-year postgraduate course to become a secondary school maths teacher
after finishing an Open University course. He now hopes to teach in a
school for the deaf in Glasgow.
As he waited to collect his degree along with other postgraduate
students, Mr Hughes said it had been a long struggle to become a teacher
but said he believed deaf children would benefit enormously from being
taught by someone who was also deaf. He said he now hoped that other
deaf students would follow his example and enter the teaching
profession.
Speaking through a sign language interpreter, Mr Hughes described how
students at the college had at first found his presence a little
frightening but had soon adjusted and attempted to learn a smattering of
signs. He attended lectures with the help of his interpreter.
Mr Hughes, whose wife is deaf but has two young hearing daughters,
said he had been taught to speak as a child and was not allowed to use
sign language, which has only been taught this century since 1979.
However, when he became a language researcher he had become interested
in signing and felt it was important that deaf people developed their
own language.
Describing Mr Hughes's success as a major breakthrough in teacher
education, Mr Ivor Sutherland, registrar with the General Teaching
Council, said there had been a significant shift in attitudes towards
disabilities. There is already a blind teacher employed in a Strathclyde
secondary school.
Meanwhile, Cardinal Thomas Winning has warned that planned
redundancies at the college also threatened the future of denominational
schools.
St Andrew's plans to make 28 academic and 25 support staff redundant
in a strategy to absorb funding cuts over the next two years.
But, in an interview with Flourish, the newspaper of the archdiocese
of Glasgow, Cardinal Winning said the loss of the college ''whether
through a dimunition of the quality of training it provides, or by the
erosion of its distinctive Catholic ethos, if forced to amalgamate with
a secular college or university, would be severely wounding.''

A disabled woman who has never been able to speak revealed yesterday
how a computer system developed at Dundee University has revolutionised
her life.
Sylvia Grant, 38, of Glenrothes, has helped researchers at the
university develop the TALK programme which enables people without
speech to take part in free-flowing conversations.
In September, Sylvia, who was born with cerebral palsy and is confined
to a wheelchair, will address a gathering of specialists in Edinburgh
using the system, which utilises a laptop computer and speech
synthesiser.
TALK (Talk Aid using pre-Loaded Knowledge) allows people without
speech to achieve something close to ordinary conversation.

LAWRENCE Hughes hatched a drunken plan to win his sweetheart back
after a row. After drowning his sorrows with his best friend, James
Lindsay, he decided to take his fiancee home a wedding gown.
Paisley Sheriff Court heard yesterday that the two men smashed the
plate glass window of a bridal-wear boutique at 5am, stripped two
mannequins bare, and ran off down the street carrying the gowns.
A taxi driver who is an amateur photographer took pictures of the pair
in action and handed them to police.
Lindsay cut his hand so badly on the broken glass that the gowns were
''blood-red rather than white'' and worthless, said procurator-fiscal
David Green.
A defence agent described his clients' behaviour as ''madness''. He
said Hughes's fiancee ''was not impressed in the least''. The solicitor
said the couple had eventually made up and had married on May 1 this
year.
The court heard that Lindsay was still hoping for a reconciliation
with his girlfriend.
Sheriff James Spy ordered Hughes, 39, and Lindsay, 23, from the South
Nitshill and Pollok areas of Glasgow, each to pay #500 compensation to
the owner of the shop -- Attick Bridal Wear, of 93 Causeyside Street,
Paisley.
Both men were also ordered to do 200 hours' community service.

ABOUT seven minutes in the Commons yesterday saw a dramatic
improvement in Mr Major's prospects of remaining Tory leader and Prime
Minister as he smashed Mr Blair off the court and made his forthcoming
encounter with Mr Redwood look as if it might resemble Tuesday's
Wimbledon tie between Steffi Graf and Martina Hingis (14).
Mr Major has lifted his game at just the right moment. ''Someone's
slipped something in his tea'' a colleague suggested.
Harold Wilson said a week was a long time in politics. Sometimes, less
than a minute can be long enough. Neil Kinnock, incoherently clutching
the podium at the triumphalist Sheffield rally, helped Labour lose the
last election.
Film clips of Mr Redwood, eyes revolving, lips moving uneasily as he
tried to pretend he was singing ''Land of My Fathers'' at the Welsh Tory
Party conference, will help him to lose the current contest.
Mr Major came in to loud cheers, quite a few from the Labour benches.
He marched out quarter-of-an-hour later to roars of approval, none from
the Opposition side.
Mr Blair who, despite careful coaching, does not entirely conceal his
mood on those occasions, seemed with a wry smile to confirm that when Mr
Major badly needed to serve an ace he had produced at least three.
The Labour leader suggested to the Prime Minister that Mr Redwood
should have resigned earlier and that the Cabinet Ministers who shared
his view of Government policies should now join him. He misunderstood,
replied Mr Major. ''As I understand it, Mr Redwood resigned from the
Cabinet because he was devastated I had resigned as leader of the
Conservative Party.'' What one might call a fair misrepresentation of Mr
Redwood's own account.
Mr Blair then moved to his soundbite on ''the divisions, hatred, and
anarchy'' in the Conservative Party. However, even for the leader of New
Labour, this attacking thrust exposes a vulnerable flank. ''You
certainly have a cheek,'' smiled Mr Major, ''since 40% of your party
voted against you when you were elected leader.''
His flank rolled up, Mr Blair did not attempt a third offensive
despite incitement from the now overjoyed Tories. Before and after him,
Labour MPs sought and failed to find a punchline that would put Mr Major
away. Only once more was he able or did he need to find an ace.
Mr George Foukles (Carrick Cumnock and Doon Valley -- Lab.) got close
to home by asking the Prime Minister's view of those Cabinet colleagues
''who while professing loyalty to you, are setting up telephone lines in
campaign offices for the second round of the election.''
Mr Major said he had no knowledge of that but added: ''I can say the
speed with which these matters can be done is a tribute to
privatisation.''
By now, the Tories were bellowing ''More, more''. Like the
blood-thirstiest of prize-fight crowds when they see a knock-down, they
want to see more. Mr Major could not oblige. You need scriptwriters to
reel off brilliant answer after brilliant answer.
However, he gave a thoughtful reply about a referendum on a single
currency which Mr Blair would do well to ponder. If the Cabinet decided
to join, he did not rule one out. The Labour leader may be tempted to
cap that with a definite promise. However, referendums hold dangers for
politicians. Like General Elections, they cannot be controlled.
Tony Benn thought a referendum would take Britain out of the Common
Market. Jim Callaghan thought a referendum would overwhelmingly validate
a Scottish Assembly. To Tory MPs, as much inspired by decency as
robustness, a lower-key answer may also have appealed.
The normally harmless Labour left-winger Andrew Bennett rather meanly
suggested that Mr Major should act to curb executive greed unless
''should the worst come to the worst'' he was planning to move into the
City himself. Mr Major replied quietly that, knowing Mr Bennett, he
thought he would come to regret the question.
That reply amounted more to just tipping the ball over the net rather
than smashing it away but it seemed to the Sketch that, in its
illustration of self-control, it was well worth a point -- or a vote.

<HEADLINE>Nurses finally discharge their no-strike clause</HEADLINE>

MEMBERS of the traditionally moderate Royal College of Nursing have
voted overwhelmingly to ditch their 79-year old no-strike clause.
RCN leaders, who have already withdrawn from joint pay negotiations
with the other health unions to avoid being drawn into action should
they fail, emphasised they were not seeking confrontation and that there
would need to be an industrial ballot before even limited action could
be taken.
Members of the 300,000-strong RCN voted by more than 95%, far in
excess of the required two-thirds majority, to scrap the rule and
replace it with one allowing for limited industrial action.
Scottish union leaders welcomed the change but emphasised it would not
lead to strike action.
Fury at the Government's handling of this year's nurses' pay award,
under which a 1% national offer can be improved through local bargaining
often linked to productivity concessions, prompted the move which was
recommended by delegates to the RCN's annual congress in Harrogate in
May.
The result, announced to wild cheers and a standing ovation at an
extraordinary general meeting held in Westminister, was 99,760 for the
rule change (95.7%) with 5529 (5.3%) against.
Describing it as a ''very clear, very strong result'' RCN general
secretary Christine Hancock said: ''In the new world of the NHS, nurses
have voted to have a choice about taking limited industrial action at
local level.''
She told a news conference after the meeting: ''Our new rule says that
nurses will never take any action which could harm patients. That is our
pledge to the public. And we know that the public trusts nurses to keep
that pledge.''
She added that the rule change ''will give nurses the opportunity to
defend patient care at local level''.
Pressed on the likelihood of any action in the current dispute, she
said there would be ''no move'' from the centre. It was health managers
who needed to take the action by offering 3% to nurses with no strings
attached, she said.
Mr Alex McMahon, RCN Scottish spokesman, said opinion polls had shown
that nurses north of the Border fully supported the rule change. The
RCN, with more than 30,000 members in Scotland, is the country's biggest
union for trained nurses.
He said: ''I have been taking calls about this from nurses around
Scotland and not one has been against the change.

THE Prime Minister has set in motion plans to produce a new model Tory
Party immediately after the result of the leadership election.
If he wins on Tuesday night, he wants to show the country his party
has changed.
A Major victory will also bring about a review of all his 110
Government Ministerial jobs. The extent of his success will determine
how sweeping his reshuffle will be from top to bottom.
A key factor in this thinking is that the Labour Party and the media
may deny him victory if his majority against Mr John Redwood, his only
official rival when nominations closed yesterday, is insufficient.
The plan is being kept secret by Mr Major and his campaign team: he
does not want it to be thought he believes victory is already in the
bag. If he fails on Tuesday and there is a second ballot, this strategy
will have to be changed, even if Mr Major insists on continuing his
fight for the leadership.
Yesterday, he was in sparkling form in the Commons at Question Time.
He exuded confidence and had his back benchers beaming and cheering.
Even Labour MPs said later he looked like a winner.
However, the extent of a Major majority is a very sensitive issue,
particularly after one of his campaign team, Sir Andrew Bowden,
suggested he needed 75% of the vote of 239 Tory MPs to prove his point.
This is a far more ambitious target than the serious Major campaigners
are hoping to achieve.
The effect of Sir Andrew's observation that if he gets less than
two-thirds of the party, ''he will have to shut his door, put an ice
pack on his head, and make the decision himself'' was balanced by both
Mr Redwood and right-winger Michael Portillo, a possible second ballot
contender.
They both stated publicly they would respect the outcome of the first
ballot even if Mr Major won by the narrowest of margins. Mr Portillo's
stance here might make it impossible for Mr Michael Heseltine to
intervene in a second ballot after a narrow margin result.
It could be their last chance for some time. It emerged last night
that the Tory back-bench 1922 Committee is proposing to change the
leadership election rules, which would ban a further contest this year.
The Major vote did appear to be hardening last night. On the key issue
for Euro-sceptics, his ''commonsense'' position on a referendum on a
single currency, he repeated his pledge that he does not rule it out:
his tone, this time, was more convincing. It was judged to give final
reassurance to the potential Redwood vote that the Prime Minister will
have a referendum but he cannot come out and say so at this stage.
Treasury Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken, in a calculated move, did
the interpretation for him. ''He has effectively made it clear that he
would lean very strongly towards a referendum if there was a prospect
put before the country in terms of a single currency.
''An alternative course could be a General Election fought on the
issue of a single currency. But as it is an issue of such enormous
constitutional importance we'd have to have the endorsement of the
people very clearly.'' Mr Aitken, a right winger, is respected by
Euro-sceptics on this issue.
Mr Major's plan to use the leadership election to revamp his party and
his Government is an essential part of his stated desire to sort out his
authority, ''once and for all''. He wants to counter Mr Blair's New
Model Labour Party and, indeed, the new model leadership of the left. So
Mr Major intends to use a victory to reassert very firmly his own
position in the party and the country.
The second element of this plan -- and one judged to be just as
important -- is on Wednesday to produce headline-catching action that
will temper any residual feeling on the back benches and in the media
that the leadership election has not changed anything.
The Prime Minister is acutely aware that if his old model Tory Party
is still seen to be divided and unchanged, his bold stroke in resigning
the Tory leadership will have been pointless.
Today, a Mori poll for the Economist indicates that if Mr Heseltine
were party leader, the Tories would benefit immediately with a 2.5%
swing to them in the country. This underlined in Tory back bench minds
that while Mr Heseltine is not a candidate for Tuesday, he is a serious
player in the Tory political development.

TENNIS ace Andre Agassi expounded last night upon of his love for
actress Brooke Shields.
They had matching gold rings, he said.
''There's two bands brought together with two hearts and a little
diamond, and every year we add a diamond and two hearts and the bond
gets stronger as the years go on.''
So the relationship would last? ''I came into it hoping that. I am a
believer in marriage. I am a believer in love.
''Marriage has been tainted over the years -- with all the high
divorce rates, who knows what anybody considers marriage any more, but
love I believe in.''
He is 25. She is 30. When he was reminded that Shields once said she
wanted to get married at 30, Agassi replied: ''She's never said that to
me.''
He declined to say directly if they planned to marry. ''I have zero
comment.''
Shields said she had loved watching him play on Centre Court. ''The
excitement, the people, and the history -- it was great,'' she said.

A STUNNED Eric Cullen, Wee Burney of the BBC's Rab C Nesbitt series,
was led yesterday from Hamilton Sheriff Court to begin a nine-month
prison term for making an indecent video and taking indecent photographs
of young boys.
An immediate appeal for interim liberation was made to the High Court
in Edinburgh by Cullen's lawyer, Mr Maurice Smyth, which will be
followed by an appeal against the sentence.
In a plea to Sheriff Alexander Macpherson, Mr Smyth disclosed for the
first time that the accused had been the victim of systematic sexual
abuse since the age of 13, abuse which lasted until the early 1990s.
Cullen, 29, pleaded guilty to four charges: being in possession of a
quantity of obscene photographs of children and indecent videos at his
house in Hamilton; taking two indecent photographs of children;
shameless and indecent conduct by exposing himself in front of children;
and taking an indecent video of young boys.
On August 30, 1993, acting on information that Cullen had at his house
pornographic material relating to children, police went there with a
search warrant. Cullen told them: ''The stuff you are looking for is
upstairs. I will show you.''
He pointed out a cardboard box with more than 100 video tapes, and
said: ''That is not my stuff.'' Most were pornographic videos involving
an adult male and young boys and formed part of the prosecution against
a man who received a 14-year sentence. He opened a briefcase for the
police containing pornographic magazines and around 400 photographs
involving boys. About 50 were indecent.
On the fourth charge, Mr James Robertson, depute procurator-fiscal,
said the indecent video was taken when Cullen was acting in a
supervisory capacity at a youth centre at Moffat. One section taken in
the dormitory focussed on the boys' private parts.
Mr Smyth said the actor's success was all the more remarkable in that
in addition to the difficulties which had accompanied his life, from his
early years to the early 1990s he had been subjected to sexual abuse and
blackmail by adults who exploited his physical vulnerability through
violence and intimidation.
It was accepted by the Crown that the videos in the first charge were
the property of the paedophile Francis Currens, who had received the
14-year sentence.
An investigation into all aspects of Cullen's case had established
beyond all doubt he was not involved in any form of child abuse. The
sheriff accepted there had been little or no effect on the children
involved.
0 He fined Cullen #1000 on the possession charge, imposed two
sentences of six months imprisonment on the photograph charges to run
concurrently with the nine months sentence on the charge of taking an
indecent video.
BBC Scotland noted the outcome of the case ''with regret''.

Geoffrey Parkhouse, Political Editor, finds that while the Major camp
is relaxed about the Trade President's intentions in the leadership
election, Portillo supporters are showing signs of concern
THE role of Michael Heseltine in this leadership election is foxing
MPs and the media. Anxiously, the supporters of the official candidate,
John Redwood, and the supporters of Michael Portillo are casting around
for any signs of Hezza engaging in illicit action.
Where is he? What's he up to? Only the Major camp seems relaxed about
Mr Heseltine, convinced that, this time, he is not ''operating'' on his
own behalf.
In public, he is staunchly pro-Major and, unless things change over
the weekend, this is set to remain his policy. If he is thinking
treacherous thoughts, he is thinking long-term.
He gives the impression that he is on the Prime Minister's inner
circuit. On Wednesday, he told BBC Radio that he had been ''consulted''
about Mr Major's surprise decision last week to hold a leadership
election. Mr Major yesterday corrected this in the Commons when asked
about it by a mischievous Labour MP. Mr Heseltine, he said, had been
''informed''.
There could be a significance in this, with the Prime Minister not
wishing to give an impression that Mr Heseltine was favoured above other
Cabinet colleagues with a consultation before the leadership
announcement. At the same time, if the Prime Minister wins handsomely on
Tuesday against Mr Redwood, he may have plans for Mr Heseltine in a
quickly reshuffled Cabinet.
Win or lose, the Tories are still massively behind Labour in opinion
polls and the task for the Tories ahead is enormous.
The latest poll in the Economist today features the President of the
Board of Trade in a significant manner. If Mr Heseltine were leader,
Tory standing would improve immediately with a swing of 2.5%.
At the same time, any other leader, including Mr Redwood, would
produce a negative swing -- in Mr Redwood's case minus 2%; Mr Michael
Portillo does little better with a negative swing of 1.5%.
All of this is well within the pollsters' normal margin of error, but
the Economist poll indicates that the country wants more of Mr Heseltine
and not less. If Mr Major wins clearly on Tuesday, Mr Heseltine may take
the view that his chance has passed and a virtue can be made of
necessity.
If the Prime Minister asks him to become his party chairman, this time
he might accept for the glory and gratitude of General Election
damage-limitation, and perhaps even the hope of a marginal victory.
So the Hezza factor in this additional way is crucial to Tuesday's
leadership contest. It seems to be gradually dawning on Tory back
benchers that he will intervene only as an official candidate if Mr
Major is humiliated in the first ballot.
If demeanour is anything to go by in these circumstances, Mr Major's
is one of ebullient confidence.
Another sparkling performance at the Commons despatch box yesterday
had Tory MPs cheering him. He squashed Mr Redwood when questioned by Mr
Tony Blair, who has become something of an ally of Mr Major's in this
leadership contest.
Mr Blair claimed that Mr Redwood resigned from the Cabinet last Monday
because he strongly disagreed with the whole direction of Government
policy. Shouldn't other Cabinet Ministers who agree with the former
Welsh Secretary also resign?
''You misunderstand the situation,'' retorted Mr Major. ''As I
understand it, Mr Redwood resigned from the Cabinet because he was
devastated that I had resigned as leader of the Conservative Party.''
He let off Mr Portillo more lightly when he was confronted with the
insensitive preparations for a second ballot and a putative Portillo
candidature. BT has been putting in extra lines in a house in nearby
Lord North Street -- an excellent spot for a campaign headquarters.
Mr Major said, claiming no knowledge of this photographed fact: ''The
speed with which these matters can be done is a tribute to
privatisation.''
Only a confident leadership candidate could handle rivals -- one
official and one lurking -- in such a manner.
He craftily used the Commons Question Time to remind the House of what
he called the ''benign'' economic prospect for Britain under his
administration and to state emphatically that if a Cabinet decided to
take Britain into a single currency serious questions about a referendum
would be raised.
''I do not propose to rule one out.'' The Prime Minister was treating
the despatch box like the hustings and the massed Tory back benchers
very much enjoyed it.
The impression given by him is that it is now plain sailing for a
clear majority, although no-one will put a figure on what this needs to
be.
Veteran Tory Sir Andrew Bowden, on the Major team, was jumped on by
his colleagues after he blurted out that Mr Major needs at least
three-quarters of the 329 elecorate.
This is a bigger margin than anyone expects, and Sir Andrew didn't
help when he opined that if Mr Major failed to get 75% of the vote he
''will want to consider his position very carefully indeed.''
This was a blip in another encouraging day for Mr Major who gives the
impression that he has fewer troubles than Hugh Grant -- he of Four
Weddings and an Arraignment fame.

A MAIN store in the South Korean capital of Seoul collapsed like a
house of cards yesterday, killing at least 52 people and leaving scores
buried in rubble.
Rescue workers said 850 injured survivors escaped from the wreckage
after one of the Sampoong Department Store's two five-storey blocks fell
without warning while thronged with early evening shoppers.
It was confirmed in the early hours this morning that at least 28
survivors were still trapped.
One was pulled from the wreckage 14 hours after it caved in. She was a
sales clerk. As she was carried out by stretcher there were cheers from
rescue workers. They said they heard a shout from the same area that
five to 10 people were alive below where she had been trapped.
The rescue operation had resumed after being suspended due to safety
fears.
Police would not say what had caused the accident, but it was
confirmed Government safety teams had visited the store after a
supervisor found structural defects in the ceilings of the top floor. An
employee told television signs of collapse were apparent hours before
the disaster. She said an emergency meeting of store management was
called but no action was taken to close the building.

* TURNING the clock back on fund-holding general practice would be a
vote-loser for Labour, a doctor in one of the party's electoral
heartlands warned yesterday.
Dr James Dunbar, a partner in a Dundee fund-holding practice, says
that the system has delighted patients and raised standards. He said:
''This issue may not be filling MPs' mailbags yet but it will if Labour
tries to turn the clock back.''
The Government is already expanding the fund-holding scheme.
Dr Dunbar estimates that by next April half the patients in Scotland
will have fund-holding GPs.
He is dismissive of Labour plans to replace fund-holding with joint
commissioning, a scheme which would allow GPs more involvement with the
health authorities in buying care.
''Joint commissioning doesn't work,'' he said. ''What happens is that
the non fund-holders present the health boards with a wish-list of what
they want. They go for everything and, of course, the board can't find
the money. It is just a joke. There is no reason why GPs would be
motivated to get involved.''

ONE in five premature babies is being denied potentially life-saving
treatment for no apparent reason, a conference of health service
managers was told yesterday. Evidence has shown that the use of
corticosteroids helps reduce deaths and illness by protecting pre-term
babies from the effects of immature lungs.
But the annual National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts
conference in Glasgow heard that only 80% of babies born before 32 weeks
received the steroids through their mothers before delivery. Only 55% of
those born between 32 and 34 weeks received them.
''It is hard to identify reasons why a significant minority of
premature babies do not receive the steroids they need,'' said the
authors of a report presented to the conference.
The report, Acting on the Evidence, says many medical and surgical
procedures have become accepted practice over the years, with clinicians
relying on their own personal experience of its impact on the health of
their patients.
Only in the case of pharmaceuticals is there a defined requirement for
evidence of efficacy before a new intervention is introduced, says the
report, which was published jointly by NAHAT and the Association of the
British Pharmaceutical Industry.
Examples cited by Professor Chris Ham, one of the authors, included
the common gynaecological procedure D and C (dilatation and curretage)
which had been shown to have no proven therapeutic effect and was not
worth while as an investigative procedure in women under 40; and the
insertion of grommets for glue ear in children, which produced transient
benefits for something that might have resolved itself anyway.
''Nobody would suggest that we stop D and C or grommets altogether,
but the evidence shows wide variations in practice and some
inappropriate use of these procedures,'' he said.
At the same time the report states that major innovations and advances
in health care would be adopted more quickly if there were a shift
towards evidence-based medicine.
Apart from steroids, other examples of delayed uptake in beneficial
treatment ranged from lemon juice to protect against scurvy (300 years)
to clot-busting thrombolytic drugs for heart attack victims (10 years).
Compared with clinical evaluation, the economic assessment of new and
current medical interventions is relatively new, the report points out,
and says that both doctors and managers in the NHS will need to be
educated to use scientific evidence when deciding treatment for
patients.
''Doctors have traditionally taken these decisions and rightly so, and
no-one is suggesting that they be subject to bureaucratic control, but
managers are trying to ensure there is clear guidance for them to work
with,'' said Professor Ham.

Why is the Opposition pulling its punches with the Tories on the ropes
over the leadership battle? Malcolm Dickson sets out the rules of the
political long game
AFTER a week of Tory leadership turmoil, Tony Blair's new Labour Party
may seem in an even stronger position than its overwhelming lead in the
opinion polls.
Yet there has been very little evidence of Labour Party Front Benchers
wielding the sword against their rivals on the Government's side. It
would appear that apart from Prime Minister's Question Time, the
business of government and opposition has been swept under the carpet by
both the main political parties.
Why is it that at a time when the Tories are at their most vulnerable,
the Labour Party seems almost reluctant to press home its poll
advantage?
The reasons are quite complex. The development of our adversarial
party system has led to the theoretical role of an Opposition party as
being a continual critical alternative to the Government of the day,
always ready to take over in government if necessary.
However, in practice, it may make more sense for an Opposition party
to be selectively critical or indeed not to criticise at all. If the
Government is openly in trouble, why risk the possibility of tactics
that may backfire?
But is this the only explanation for Labour's quietness?
Look at the content of the three main policy statements made by Labour
over the past week. On education, grant-maintained schools are to stay.
On the economic front, controlling inflation is the cornerstone. In the
NHS, Tory reforms are broadly to remain. The extent to which these
statements take on Conservative clothing is remarkable.
In fact, Tony Blair's new Labour is perhaps the fourth Labour Party to
emerge during the last 16 years. Its considerable change in emphasis and
the fact that it is only one year old mean it still has a lot of
persuading to do.
Most of the time it is easy for an Opposition party to call publicly
for a General Election from time to time, safe in the knowledge that
there will not be one.
It gives the party time to develop its contacts and relationships with
influential groups and interests, yet at the same time present a public
face that is ready for government. Popular support is only one side of
the equation for a modern Opposition. If it is serious about government,
then serious work behind the scenes is necessary. It is not only votes
that matter in winning an election.
This work is only partially complete. Mr Blair has pushed Labour
policy even further in his year of office than either Neil Kinnock or
John Smith did in almost 10 years. Labour is now a different party and
its job of persuasion is barely half done. While public support in the
form of opinion poll leads of 30 points may win them a General Election,
in terms of convincing the City and other vested interests there is
still a long way to go.
For Labour, a General Election now could be embarrassing. It has spent
the 12 months of Mr Blair's term in office making statements about how
it will publish its costings only when it is appropriate.
What that really means is when it is in government in two years' time
after the ground work has been done and not before. John Smith's Shadow
Budget in the run-up to the 1992 election was widely seen as a club with
which the Tory Party subsequently beat Labour's team around the head.
Opposition parties must tread a careful path, and pressing for an
election too early may prove in the long run the best way to return to
the Opposition benches.
During the time of the Lib-Lab pact from 1977 through to 1979,
Margaret Thatcher in opposition had considerable opportunity to topple
James Callaghan's minority administration. Yet holding back allowed her
grip to develop within the parliamentary Conservative Party, the
constituencies and among key interest groups.
In fact, it was eventually the SNP which provoked the vote of no
confidence in March 1979, a full two years after Labour had gone to the
Liberals for support.
In many ways, Labour has been caught on the hop. It seemed as though a
General Election was almost certainly two years away. A quick election
could now be a possibility if a new incumbent in Downing Street wishes
to take advantage of a honeymoon period.
Labour had hoped that an election in 1997 would see it take over an
ever-diminishing Public Sector Borrowing Requirement and would have
allowed it greater time to convince the City of its competence and
business groups over its minimum wage.
It had also banked on the Tories having to steer themselves through
the inter-governmental conference on the Maastricht Treaty in 1996, thus
taking the heat out of Labour's own Euro-split.
Yet Wednesday's six month Treasury economic forecast indicated a rise
in the PSBR to #23.5 bn for the next year with inflation rising and
growth slowing.
For Labour, a General Election now may be the last thing it wants.

SCOTTISH Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton reacted angrily
yesterday to a claim that he would find it difficult to work under Mr
Michael Forsyth if he became Scottish Secretary.
The suggestion came from Scottish Tory Reform Group vice-president
Susan Bell in The Herald earlier this week, when she suggested that if a
Cabinet reshuffle saw Mr Forsyth appointed Secretary of State there
could be resignations among Scottish Office Ministers.
Ironically, Mrs Bell also had suggested that Lord James would make an
excellent Secretary of State himself.
However, Lord James, called her remarks ''a total misrepresentation.''
He said: ''Nobody is entitled to speak on my behalf. I have never made
any public statements as to who should, or should not, be appointed.''
He added: ''This was a totally unwarranted attack on Michael Forsyth
as far as I am concerned and I totally dissociate myself from it. I have
worked very closely with Michael in the past and I resent the suggestion
being made. It is a total misrepresentation.''

LABOUR yesterday pledged to halt the ''market chaos'' created by
Conservative NHS reforms and replace competition with a system based on
co-operation.
Opposition leader Tony Blair, unveiling the party's health manifesto
in London, vowed to slash health service bureaucracy and introduce a
locally-based, patient-led system without turning the clock back to
pre-reform days if his party wins the next General Election.
However, Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley dismissed Labour's plans
as a ''botched operation'', claiming they were a recipe for ''upheaval
and turmoil'' for health service staff.
A key element of the Tory reforms -- the division between healthcare
planning by GPs and health authorities, and the delivery of health
services by hospitals -- would be retained.
Labour insists it is proposing much more than cosmetic surgery for the
NHS and says aggressive competition among hospitals would go, with
annual contracts being replaced by long-term rolling Comprehensive
Health Agreements between health authorities and local health providers.
The proposals are similar but less radical than those contained in the
Scottish Labour Party's current consultation document, A Healthy
Scotland, which emerged from the Health 2000 consultation process and is
being considered by trade unions, the British Medical Association and
other interested parties after approval by the Scottish Labour Party
conference in March.
The Scottish proposals would abolish hospital trust boards, and health
boards would be either elected directly, comprise local authority
councillors, or comprise a partnership involving directly-elected
members, health service workers and local councillors.
Mr Jim Devine, senior regional officer (health) for the biggest health
union, Unison, pointed out that there would be potential for differences
in policy positions in the Labour Party in Scotland because health would
be one of the issues devolved to a Scottish parliament under the party's
constitutional plans.
Under Labour's system, hospital trusts would be transformed into Local
Health Services, bringing together hospitals, ambulance services,
community and mental health services in a framework of ''co-operation
and support''.
They would be free to make day-to-day decisions about the delivery of
care, but would lose the control over their assets now enjoyed by
hospital trusts. Health authorities would allocate budgets and monitor
overall service delivery through the new health care agreements.
Fund-holding GPs, who buy services from hospital trusts, would be
phased out and the system of general practice commissioning, which has
already sprung up informally in many parts of the country, would be
extended.
GPs from different practices would get together and work in
partnership with the health authority serving their needs to commission
care for their patients.
And, on the day the Royal College of Nursing announced more than 95%
support in a ballot of members on ditching its ban on industrial action,
Labour promised to retain national pay bargaining for health workers
while allowing an element of local flexibilty.
The Government is presently in the middle of a bitter dispute with
health workers over the decision to move to local pay bargaining.
Introducing the policy document, Renewing the NHS, Mr Blair stressed
that Labour would not reverse all the Tory reforms and said:''We keep
what is good. We remove what is bad. We extend greater power for
hospitals and doctors.
''We remove the wasteful Tory market which is costing billions of
pounds. So we move beyond the perceived inflexibility of the old NHS and
the market chaos of the Tory NHS. We propose an NHS that is
locally-based and patient-led. It is a sensible third way for the
future.''
Mr Blair said Labour's aim was not to ''swap one set of prejudices for
another''.
He added: ''The health service is fed up with revolutionary change
foisted on it from above with little or no consultation. That is not our
approach.''
He said one of the key aims of Labour's health blueprint was to cut
bureaucracy, which now took up about 12% of the NHS budget. But while
ending costly annual contracts, there would at the same time be
ambitious new quality standards set.
He pointed out that, under the current system, trust hospitals are not
fully part of the NHS and can be privatised at the stroke of a pen. But
under Labour health service assets would clearly belong to the NHS.
All the issues of concern to the British people, few mattered more
than the NHS. ''They are proud of it. The majority use it. They value
it. And they fear what is happening to it. It became a pillar of
security for the British people in a rapidly changing world. But
increasingly people feel that they cannot rely on it.
''They fear that it is heading gradually but inexorably towards
commercialisation and even privatisation. Instead of greater efficiency,
the market experiment -- imported by the Tories from the failed American
healthcare system -- has led to increased bureaucracy, inefficiency and
unequal access to treatment.
''Vital resources which should go on front-line patient care are
wasted on an endless paper chase.''
Shadow health secretary Margaret Beckett, who was the chief architect
of the proposals and presented the policy document with Mr Blair, said
the Tories had replaced the NHS with a health market led by accountants.
The reforms had led to cuts in hospital beds, cancelled operations, a
two-tier health service, record waiting lists, greater bureaucracy and
low staff morale.
She added: ''Labour will offer what the Conservatives' free market can
never deliver -- a co-ordinated approach, through a senior minister, on
public health issues.
''Labour proposes a third way -- neither turning back the clock nor
accepting the Tory 'reforms', but the way forward. A future in which
doctors, nurses and other staff, managers and patients, the public and
their representatives all work together as 'health partners',
modernising the NHS to deliver for us all the best possible health care.
''Our NHS will be a single organisation, working locally and
nationally, with shared objectives.''
In a scathing attack on Labour, Mrs Bottomley said: ''If Margaret
Beckett were a doctor, they would strike her off.''
Mrs Bottomley insisted -- despite Mrs Beckett's claims to the contrary
-- that the plans would ''turn back the clock'' on the NHS reforms.
She said: ''Labour would destroy fundholding, rob NHS trusts of their
vital freedoms and scrap the incentives for better performance built
into the new NHS. The result is a shambles of policy which would set the
NHS back a dozen or more years.''
Mrs Bottomley claimed that under the Government's reforms more
patients were being treated than ever and waiting times had fallen to
the lowest on record.
What the NHS needed now, she said, was continuity and stability.
''Labour offer upheaval and turmoil,'' said Mrs Bottomley.
She said ending fundholding would be especially damaging for patients.
Labour's Scottish health spokesman Mr John McAllion said the proposals
in its consultation document were very similar and welcomed the health
manifesto, adding: ''It is important to get away from the market and get
back to providing a service to meet people's needs rather than a
competitive situation based on the market which distorts provision.''
A British Medical Association spokesman said: ''The document shows
evidence that the Labour Party has listened to the advice we've been
giving for the last few years in a number of areas.''
British Dental Association chief executive John Hunt said: ''The BDA
wants to preserve NHS dentistry and welcomes Labour's commitment to
revive it.''
But he warned that Labour would have to increase resources.
Unison head of health in Britain, Bob Abberley, said: ''Labour has
listened to views of people in the service. They have abandoned the
damaging market mechanisms and called a halt to the development of a
two-tier system.''
THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES
* HEALTH authorities would have the job of assessing the needs of
people in their area to ensure a range of services. They would allocate
public money on the understanding that a certain minimum standard and
volume of care would be delivered within a set budget. Health
authorities would be made more accountable, run by a core management
team answerable to a supervisory board of non-executive directors
representing the community.
* TRUSTS would become Local Health Services, comprising hospitals,
ambulance services, community and mental health services within a
co-operative framework. They would no longer have control over their
assets, which would be owned and held nationally. But they would have
complete managerial responsibility and be free to make day-to-day
decisions. Each LHS would have a governing body to include patients,
health professionals and other local representatives.
* THE internal market as it currently exists would go. Annual
contracts with health authorities between competing hospitals would be
replaced by rolling Comprehensive Healthcare Agreements, updated every
three years or so. They would cover treatment for local patients but
also allow for patients from other health authorities who want to use
their services. A co-operative relationship between health authorities
would cater for patients referred from other
areas. * GP fundholding would be phased out and replaced with a system
of General Practice Commissioning. Doctors in a particular area would
team up to commission health care from their local health authority.
The aim is for GPs and the health authority to work together in a
flexible partnership. Health authorities would be expected to reflect
the preferences of local GPs.
* STAFF pay would be negotiated nationally under Labour, with
allowances made for a degree of local flexibility.

A BILL giving the authorities new powers to seize criminals' assets
has become law.
The Proceeds of Crime Bill, which has received Royal Assent, will
force criminals to account for the legal origin of all their property,
or lose it.
It also gives the courts stronger powers to trace assets criminals may
try to hide and to confiscate proceeds of crime which come to light up
to six years after a criminal is convicted.
The law, which extends powers which already exist for seizing the
assets of drug dealers and terrorists, was put forward as a Private
Members' Bill by the Tory MP for Exeter Sir John Hannam.
It was backed by the Government and received cross-party support. The
courts will begin implementing it in November.
Welcoming Royal Assent for the Bill, Home Secretary Michael Howard
said it was ''a victory for the majority of honest people angered by the
ease with which criminals grow wealthy from their crimes''.

A FEW hours after launching the new programme, shadow health secretary
Margaret Beckett, received subdued but warm applause addressing the
National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts conference in
Glasgow, which included many who might consider themselves an endangered
species under a Labour government.
Questioners challenged her about her plans to abolish fund-holding --
''one of the few incentives bringing new GPs into the profession,''
according to one GP.
She replied that for the fund-holders who had spoken to her the
principal incentive was not financial, but the chance to have a say in
the way services were provided, and that was something Labour would
extend to all GPs.
The choice facing the country and the NHS was privatisation under the
Tories or modernisation under Labour, she claimed.
She also took the opportunity to condemn the awarding of a contract to
the American-owned Irvine Health Care to look after 90 elderly people in
North Ayrshire.
''Who is going to provide the earnings and the profits in North
Ayrshire -- the 90 patients in their care?'' she asked.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang yesterday confirmed that he will not
intervene to cap the budget of Strathclyde Regional Council.
As exclusively revealed in The Herald earlier this week, Mr Lang has
won a battle with Cabinet colleagues to avoid capping the council's
1995-96 spending levels.
He was immediately congratulated by the region's Labour finance
committee chairman, Councillor John Mullin, for prevailing over ''the
forces of darkness in the Treasury and Environment Department''.
Scotland's largest local authority -- which is soon to disappear under
local government reorganisation -- was the only council this year to set
a budget which was above Scottish Office-imposed capping limits.
The council's Labour leaders warned that jobs and services would have
to be cut if the Scottish Office intervened.
They have been waiting since March to hear whether the Scottish Office
would accept their strategy of transferring #45m of revenue spending
into capital to meet a final excess of #34m over capping limits.
In a written House of Commons answer, Mr Lang said he had noted that
the council had taken action to reduce capital funded from current
revenue in both 1994-95 and this year which had a direct effect on the
level of its 1995-96 council tax.
Having considered all the circumstances, he had decided not to cap the
region.
Mr Lang claimed the fact that no Scottish councils have had to be
capped this year showed the effectiveness of his powers to protect local
taxpayers from ''excessive'' spending by councillors.
He also made it clear that the budgets of the new unitary councils,
which take over next April, will continue to be subject to the same
Scottish Office spending controls.
Mr Lang's decision not to cap Strathclyde was welcomed warmly by Mr
Mullin, who said that finding another #34m of cuts at this stage in the
financial year would have been catastrophic for the council's services.
It would have meant a reduction of 2500 posts and would have seriously
hampered the setting up of the new unitary councils.
The Government decision also meant that the region would not have to
send out fresh council tax bills with the serious costs and cash flow
implications that would have ensured.

NO OFFICIAL statement will be made on jailed paratrooper Lee Clegg
until he has been told the result of his application for early release,
the Prime Minister declared yesterday.
Mr Major insisted a decision on the case would be made ''as soon as
possible''.
He was replying at Commons question time to Tory Julian Brazier, who
protested that former terrorists had been informed of the outcome of
their reviews while Private Clegg had not.
Earlier, Lieutenant General Sir Napier Crookenden issued a statement
on behalf of the Clegg Committee accusing Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick
Mayhew of ''inexcusable cruelty'' for not ordering the paratrooper's
immediate release.
Clegg, 26, was jailed for life for the killing of 18-year-old Belfast
joyrider Karen Reilly at an Army checkpoint in 1990.
Mr Brazier, MP for Canterbury, told the Prime Minister that of 10
cases considered earlier this month by the Northern Ireland Review
Board, nine, ''including a number of former IRA and UDA terrorists'',
had been told the result at least in outline.
He pressed Mr Major: ''Why is it that Pte Lee Clegg alone has not been
told the outcome of his review and when is he likely to be told?''
The Prime Minister replied: ''Any decision in the case of Pte Clegg,
firstly, will be reached as soon as possible and, secondly, will be
advised to Pte Clegg before any further statement is made.''
Earlier, at question time, Mr Seamus Mallon (SDLP Newry and Armagh)
warned Sir Patrick: ''If you make a decision in the Clegg case -- an
executive decision made by a politician on the advice of civil servants
-- that overrules a decision of the Northern Ireland High Court, of the
Northern Ireland Court of Appeal and the House of Lords, that will
devalue and demean the whole process of law in Northern Ireland.''
He added: ''It would be tantamount to throwing a lighted match onto a
tinder box in Northern Ireland and to rub salt in the wounds of those of
have served long sentences, according to the judicial process, not
executive decisions.''
Sir Patrick told him: ''I have no intention, nor have I any
jurisdiction, to overrule the High Court, Court of Appeal or House of
Lords.
''You are confusing that notion with the jurisdiction Parliament has
confirmed on the holder of my office, and the Home Secretary, to deal
with the question of whether a sentence for life should mean for the
whole of somebody's natural life or not.
''You can be perfectly certain that any individual case that falls
within my jurisdiction will be dealt with in the best way that seems to
accord with the rule of law and with the jurisdiction that has been
conferred upon me by Parliament.''

MICHAEL PORTILLO yesterday took time off from a meeting in Luxembourg
to dismiss speculation that he might declare himself a candidate in a
second ballot for the Tory leadership.
''There won't be a second round. That is my position. The Prime
Minister is going to have a clear majority,'' he said.
Meanwhile, the Euro-sceptic Employment Secretary expressed his delight
at the latest deadlock in European Union plans to protect so-called
''posted'' workers taking temporary jobs across the Community. Mr
Portillo has long opposed the directive, to the acclamation of Tory
Euro-sceptics, saying it would not help employment.
The Minister told reporters that everyone recognised that Mr Major
would win the leadership contest in the first ballot with a handsome
majority.
''I think he is going to win it, you think he is going to win it. Why
do we have to get into speculation about some future time beyond?'' he
said.
He insisted that he was with Mr Major and Mr Heseltine and others in
the Cabinet in trying to maintain Conservative Party unity. ''Because of
that, we have taken the decision that we are going to resist moves to
federalism. A Government has to recognise the diverse opinions within
itself and within the nation,'' he said.
He predicted that John Redwood would not form a Cabinet. ''But let me
make it clear that I served alongside Mr Redwood and that was a great
pleasure to me. I have served under Mr Major and that was a great
pleasure to me, too.''
He dismissed ''rumours'' that his supporters were setting up a
campaign headquarters. ''I have taken a firm decision that I am not
going to comment on rumours.''

* Mr Portillo was last night accused of blocking EU aid to Scotland.
Mr Hugh McMahon, Labour Euro-MP for Strathclyde West, said the
Employment Secretary had changed eligibility rules despite being warned
not to do so by the commission.
Mr McMahon said #40m was at stake from the European Social Fund and
that the victims of the delays included United Enterprise, a charitable
company run by churches. ''Many voluntary groups are faced with cash
flow problems and are finding it difficult to keep their heads above
water,'' he said.

THE Post Office is selling #10m of National Lottery tickets each week
-- just one of several new ventures which have pulled in #17.5m in
additional revenue since the Government pulled back from Post Office
privatisation and granted greater commercial freedom a year ago.
Chairman Michael Heron told industrial correspondents yesterday that,
in addition to being the largest retailer of Lottery tickets, the Post
Office was also the nation's biggest bureau de change, travel insurance
was now sold at 1000 Post Offices, and 250 offered ''cash by wire''
services.
This, he said, indicated just how well the Post Office could tackle
new opportunities when they were presented and vindicated the Post
Office board's continued pressure for more commercial freedom.
''I am delighted that new freedoms already given to us by the
Government are now bearing fruit,'' said Mr Heron.

LICENSED premises with children's certificates are increasing in
Scotland, according to statistics published yesterday by the Scottish
Office.
The 1652 children's certificates in force at December 31, 1994, which
represented 20% of fully-licensed hotels and 19% of public houses, was
5% more than in 1993 and compared with a total of 1262 in 1991.
The number of children's certificates varied widely between licensing
board areas. Aberdeen held the highest number, 85, followed by Dundee,
81, and Banff and Buchan, 67.
However, the highest proportion of licensed hotels and public houses
with chidren's certificates in force was in Stewartry, with 79% from its
54 certificates and Ettrick and Lauderdale, with 66% from 47.
Only 6% of hotels and pubs in Glasgow and 3% in Edinburgh held
children's certificates.
There were 16,700 liquor licences in force in Scotland at the end of
1994, 208 more than in 1993 and 345 more than in 1991. The total
represented a considerable rise from 13,892 in 1980.
More than one-third of liquor licences in 1994 were for off-sales and
29% for pubs.
There were three licences in force for every 1000 persons in Scotland.
Glasgow and Edinburgh had the most licences in force, each accounting
for about 10% of all liquor licences in force in Scotland.
However, the highest number of licences per 1000 population were
Badenoch and Strathspey, 15, Skye and Lochalsh, 11, and Lochaber, 10.
The largest percentage rise in the number of licences in force last
year took place in the Western Isles, 25%. The largest percentage
decrease occurred in Falkirk, 7%.
The 10,153 regular extensions granted in Scotland in the 12 months to
May, 1994, represented a 1% decrease in this area from the previous
year. More than 4000 Sunday afternoon extensions were granted.

JOHN REDWOOD preached ''true devolution'' for Scotland yesterday, only
moments after demonstrating an embarrassing ignorance of the existence
of a separate Scottish legal system, Benedict Brogan writes.
The Tory leadership challenger, who emphasises his strong Unionist
views, revealed that he would extend the powers of Scotland's new
unitary authorities to include control over all quangos.
Mr Redwood told The Herald he would produce a package of measures to
strengthen local democracy by making appointed bodies in areas like
health and education, including NHS trusts, accountable to local
government.
The implication is that a Redwood Government would go further than Mr
John Major in responding to the problem of the ''democratic deficit''
between Scotland and Westminster, raised most recently by Tayside North
MP Bill Walker, who is part of Mr Redwood's campaign team.
''True devolution is what Scotland needs,'' Mr Redwood said. ''That
means a further transfer of power to local communities, councils,
businesses, and families. We can do that in all sorts of ways.''
Citing his experience in Wales as proof of his commitment to
increasing the democratic accountability of quangos, Mr Redwood praised
the reorganisation of local government in Scotland.
He said: ''Scotland is getting a new system of local government. The
idea of that is to create new all-purpose authorities which are strong,
which have a sense of local accountability built into their borders and
their construction.''
Mr Redwood indicated that should he become Prime Minister, the new
councils would have their powers strengthened. ''We should use those to
the full. We should delegate more things for them to do,'' he said.
However, he appeared to spoil his willingness to promote reform in
Scotland by repeatedly using the language of the ''little Englander'',
with mishandled references to the Common Law and the English bulldog.
Mr Redwood told his campaign news conference: ''Our country is based
on one currency, one Parliament, a common language, one common law.
These are our birth rights; freedom and identity created over many
centuries,'' apparently ignoring Scotland's separate legal system based
on Roman law, not Common law.
He then went on to argue against greater European integration by
saying: ''Brussels does not need to have an opinion and a directive for
every subject. It should let some sleeping dogs lie, and should learn
that you cannot harmonise the dachshund and the English bulldog by
crossbreeding. Their differences are part of the fun of Europe and give
us more choice.''
His English definition of the United Kingdom was seized on by
Opposition parties. Mr Alex Salmond of the SNP said: ''Obviously, this
fellow of All Souls is all at sea when it comes to appreciating the
diversity of national culture within the state of the UK.
''If Redwood's London-centred attitude to other parts of the UK
displays ignorance, his attitude to the rest of Europe smacks of
xenophobia. This contest is not so much about the battle for the votes
of middle England but a struggle for the soul of little England.''
Mr George Robertson, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, said: ''Such
remarks, which seem oblivious to the fact that Scots law is different
and distinct, are typical of the narrow-minded English nationalism which
is increasingly on display in the modern Tory Party. They are so
obsessed with their own Westminster-based battles that they have
forgotten that Scotland and the outside world even exists.''
However, Mr Redwood won praise from Mr Walker for his plans for
Scotland. ''His approach fits in exactly with what I want, which is that
we will give these powers to the councils so that local people will have
their say.''
Mr Redwood challenged Mr Major to meet him face to face for a debate,
an offer promptly rejected as a publicity stunt by the Major camp.
''This is the sort of tactic losing candidates in any election always
pursue,'' a spokesman said.
As for the suggestion that his candidacy is loosing momentum, Mr
Redwood claimed the support of a number of unnamed influential MPs and
Ministers. However, there was only one new face on his platform, the
backbench MP Andrew Hargreaves.
Instead, he promised to be the candidate of unity, and promised his
Cabinet would reflect a broad range of party views. ''I would choose a
talented team from across the spectrum of the Conservative Party. I
won't be picking them all from one clique or another,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Labour fury as committee decides not to recommend legislation over directors' salaries.  Report on executive pay a 'cop-out'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>

<TEXT>
A REPORT by a Tory-dominated committee of MPs into executive pay was
dubbed a ''cop-out'' last night after it decided not to recommend
legislation to tackle the controversy.
The Employment Select Committee singled out chiefs of the privatised
utilities for criticism after their huge pay rises caused a public
outcry.
The report said that the executives should have shown ''greater
sensitivity'' in handling pay and redundancy issues.
Labour MPs on the committee produced a minority report, attacking the
''dramatic'' pay increases and calling on the Government to review the
tax treatment of executive share schemes.
Mr Ken Eastham (Labour -- Manchester Blackley), a member of the
committee, accused Tory MPs of putting a ''gloss'' on the controversy
and shying away from recommending tough action.
''There was a feeling that they wanted to rubbish any proper
conclusions. But the evidence we took from executives spoke for itself.
We are in favour of legislation to limit share options and to tackle tax
concessions,'' he said.
Shadow Employment Minister Ian McCartney said of the report: ''It's a
total cop-out by the Tories and another example of how they support fat
cats.''
The committee did recommended that executives' contracts should be for
no longer than 12 months unless approved by shareholders.
The MPs also called for shareholders to be given the right to approve
any new incentive scheme for directors.
Another recommendation said that members of remuneration committees
should be listed in company annual reports, along with any posts held
with other firms.
It was essential that individual shareholders expressed their opinion
on executive pay in an ''open and democratic way'', said the MPs.
The committee recommended that the Companies Act be amended to require
shareholders' resolutions to be circulated to all shareholders prior to
an annual meeting.
''It is clear to us that pay in the privatised utilities will not
cease to be the object of public criticism until those companies reveal
more than they do at present about the level of pay and the way it is
decided and until the Government take steps to ensure that shareholders
are able -- as they are in the United States -- to take a more direct
role in the approval of executive pay.
''Only once there is real and ultimate accountability of all concerned
will the public be satisfied that top people can justify top pay,'' the
report said.
Mr Greville Janner, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said: ''We
agree with the Prime Minister that the behaviour of the boards of
privatised utilities has been distasteful.
''We have held a series of vibrant hearings which we hope will apply
pressure on the Government to bring in legislation, if the full force of
public anger on this issue does not bring results.''
The Greenbury committee of top industrialists will publish its report
on executive pay next month.
The Institute of Directors said it welcomed the committee's rejection
of formal regulation of the level of executive pay.
It said it accepted the case for amending the Companies Act to extend
the existing rights of shareholders to vote on the offer of share
options to other forms of incentives and share participation.
''But the IoD sees no justification for the committee's recommendation
to consolidate the recommendations of the Cadbury committee on
disclosure into company law.''

Benedict Brogan, Political Reporter finds the Scots Secretary in a
hard-hitting mood on the challenger's policies
SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang last night dismissed as ''candy floss''
the policy proposals announced yesterday by Tory leadership challenger
John Redwood.
He brushed aside suggestions that his commitment to Mr Major
guaranteed his departure from the Scottish Office and his replacement by
Home Office Minister and Stirling MP Michael Forsyth.
Mr Lang, one of the key figures in John Major's campaign, labelled Mr
Redwood's ''true devolution'' policy as inconsistent: giving Scotland's
new unitary authorities more power over spending would inevitably
undermine the former Welsh Secretary's pledge to reduce public spending.
''I wonder how he would cut out waste in health, local government and
other areas of activity if he is contemplating passing powers of that
kind to high-spending local authorities. It doesn't add up. It's a candy
floss policy,'' he said.
In an interview with The Herald in his private office beneath Big Ben,
a visibly tired Mr Lang said running Mr Major's campaign required
18-hour days spent co-ordinating interviews, lobbying MPs and putting
the best face on Mr Major's chances of securing the convincing majority
he needs to stay in office.
On Tuesday Mr Redwood announced that he would demand an immediate
across-the-board reduction in public spending to fund a round of summer
tax cuts if he won power. He said he would expect his Ministers to
reduce spending by 1.67%, or #5000m of total Government expenditure.
Yesterday he laid out his policy on Scotland and the Union.
Mr Lang expressed astonishment at his proposals. ''I share with John
Redwood a commitment to the maintenance of the United Kingdom. I also
share the general philosophy of devolution of power from Government to
people, but I don't believe that a major transfer of power to local
authorities will improve either the cost of delivering services or the
quality of those services,'' he said.
Mr Lang refused to speculate on his promotion prospects after the
contest. Various permutations have been suggested which would have him
taking over as Defence or Foreign Secretary. ''I have work to do at the
Scottish Office and I want to go on doing it as long as the Prime
Minister wants me to,'' he said.
As for Mr Forsyth's chances, Mr Lang would say only: ''He is an
extremely able Minister and a strong supporter of Mr Major.'' Mr Forsyth
has called on MPs to back the Prime Minister, and has antagonised some
of his fellow right-wing MPs by describing Mr Redwood as a chairman of a
golf club.
Mr Major's campaign is led by Viscount Cranborne, the Government's
Leader in the Lords. Mr Lang and Leader of the Commons Tony Newton are
its two senior campaign managers from the Cabinet, who were on hand as
the Prime Minister made his dramatic resignation announcement last
Thursday.
Since then, Mr Lang has juggled his duties as Scottish Secretary and
his obligation to Mr Major, whom he described yesterday as a good
friend: ''We understand each other and we trust each other implicitly''.
His days, as a result, have been ''longer and more intense''.
His close relationship with Mr Major began when they both entered the
Commons in 1979. They then both worked in the Whips' Office, where he
said, they forged ''a bond that continues''.
''We entered the Whips' Office almost together. I was there before
him, but his talents there were recognised before mine. In the Whips'
Office you work long hours. It's very hard detailed work and you get to
know your fellow whips very well. We had adjacent desks. His was always
tidy. Mine -- I will draw a veil,'' he said.
He spends his time between the Commons and the Georgian house in
nearby Cowley Street which has been turned into the Major campaign
headquarters. His political adviser, Mr Gregor MacKay, has taken annual
leave from his work at the Scottish Office to join the team.
Central to his effort, Mr Lang said, is a constant round of meetings
with MPs to shore up Mr Major's support and listen to their views and
concerns. ''Sometimes it's two minutes in the Lobby, other times it's
half an hour over a drink late at night.''
He admitted it was often difficult to tell if an MP's pledge of
loyalty was sincere. ''Of course, I take their word for it. When they
tell me something I'm prepared to believe them. But overall, one
acknowledges one can never be sure.''
A leadership contest puts MPs under all kinds of pressures which makes
it often difficult politically for them to reveal their true preference.
''Minds occasionally change,'' he admitted, remembering all too well the
claim against Mrs Thatcher's failed campaign in 1990, that her managers
put too much faith in the pledges of support they received.
This time is different, he said. ''There is a common theme coming
through this, a growing recognition and agreement among colleagues that
unity is a most important pre-requisite for electoral success, that
loyalty to the Prime Minister is a fundamental strand of Conservatism,
that only the Prime Minister can unite the party and lead us to victory
over Labour.''

IN the days leading up to the court appearance that was finally to
wreck his life and bury his career, Eric Cullen spoke to The Herald,
baring his soul about the harrowing traumas of his childhood, his
tortured youth and young adulthood, and how he was pulled inexorably
into the jaws of ruin.
What he missed most, he said, was the laughter. The laughter stopped
for all time yesterday. Why had he pled guilty, The Herald asked, when
he had an answer, or at least a partial answer, for each of the charges?
''I could never have pled not guilty,'' he said, ''because I could not
possibly face Frank Currens. It would be impossible for me.
''And if I were to plead not guilty on the charge from the BB camp
they would have to drag in about 80 or 90 boys for no reason at all.
They were all interviewed by the procurator-fiscal and everyone cleared
me. It would be totally unfair on the kids and the charge is absolute
nonsense.
''I took videos every year at the BB camp yet the police took out a
15-second clip from all these hours . . .''
The police, he says, took away every single video from his house . . .
Rab C Nesbitt films, pantomimes, family videos, youth groups, theatre
groups, Boys Brigade -- many many hours and from that they took out 15
seconds. A copy of that same video was given to one of the BB leaders, a
woman. She was shown it at the police station and she said to the fiscal
in a sworn statement that she saw nothing sexual in the tape at all.
Why, asks Eric Cullen, was she not charged with possession of the tape?
''Why were the other victims of Currens and the other two men who
abused me never charged? Someone else came forward and handed in videos,
yet no-one else has been charged. That is just one of many
inconsistencies. Another one concerns the man who allegedly came forward
anonymously and told them about Currens. How could he be anonymous when
the police said at the briefing that he had died of Aids? They must have
know him.
''I was charged with simple possession, no question of using that
material for gratification or anything else.
''Had they believed that stuff was really mine they should have
charged me on day one. Instead there was ten weeks delay. Had they not
known anything about Frank Currens they should have interviewed me there
and then. Instead the police never came near me.
''The video machines they took from my house were both broken. They
took away my word-processor. From that came the rumours that I had used
it to link up with a paedophile ring in Amsterdam. I couldn't load the
dishwasher far less use a computer for that.''
Cullen gave a different version of events in relation to the charge on
the banks of the River Clyde, saying that he had been forced to lie on
the ground and expose himself to Francis Currens, who took that
photograph.
''I had no choice although people will argue that I had. I was 21 so
people will say I was old enough but I was conditioned to being
photographed naked since I was 13 and it did not mean much to me. It was
just part and parcel of the whole humiliation I had suffered since I was
13.''
Cullen spent more than four years in a special needs unit at
Motherwell College because of his early behavioural and slow-learning
difficulties. What people did not realise was that this was due to the
constant abuse he was suffering as a youth. After four years he gained
the Highers he needed for entry to college but even while there he was
being constantly raped because, he says, his abusers still saw him as
the young boy they had first molested.
One of the most difficult incidents in Cullen's life was the tracing
of his natural mother by the social services followed by a meeting in
her house at Elderslie after months and months of preparation.
''I had hoped to keep it quiet but my natural mother contacted the
tabloids and it turned into a circus. Then when all this scandal blew up
she was quoted as saying that she blamed my adoptive family for my
sexual abuse alleging that they had not done enough to protect me. That
was just total nonsense.
''I was taken to public toilets to do things with men. There are a lot
of men out there who have a part of my childhood and they have stolen
it. My relative got pleasure out of watching other people doing it, as
did Frank Currens. That is a recurring theme.
''In the last two years my anger has become more directed against that
relative who I believed loved me. I now regard myself as totally
asexual. I am petrified of relationships. I have a fear of physical
contact, even having a friend put his arm round me.
''I withdrew from Nesbitt because of ill health. There was a rumour
that I was sacked but that was not true. I am hoping and praying that I
can get my career back. I have had my childhood stolen and then my
adulthood stolen, two years of my life completely wrecked and I have
been virtually imprisoned. If I get my career completely taken away I am
being punished again for the sins of other people. It is simply not
fair.
''The only thing I know how to do reasonably well is to make people
laugh. I think I have lost out on the laughter and that is what I have
missed most in the last two years. People used to laugh but they do not
laugh now.
''Bill and Caroline's kids have been very important to me. Kids do not
hurt you.''
Eric Cullen told The Herald: ''I have never known what it is to ask
for sympathy. When you go through your childhood being raped and not
growing taller than a ten year old it is a word that is not in your
vocabulary. I know what it is like to scream for mercy but never to
receive any.''

POLICE were searching the countryside for human remains last night
after a severed head and a leg were found on fires a few miles apart.
Officers arrived at the scene of what were reported as grass fires
near Clitheroe, Lancashire, to find the head and leg had been concealed
in vegetation and set on fire.
The head was found off the A59 near Clitheroe and the leg discovered
half an hour later at a picnic site at a beauty spot at nearby Sabden in
the shadow of Pendle Hill.
Murder squad detectives were called in, roadblocks set up, and a
police helicopter used in a search of the area for more remains.
A Lancashire police spokesman said a car had been seen speeding away
from the A59 where the head was found but it was not known if it was
connected with the incident.
Det Supt John Debicki said last night the two incidents were plainly
linked. ''It appears there was a deliberate attempt to conceal and
destroy the remains of what is obviously a human body,'' he said.
Last night, a Home Office pathologist was examining the remains and
the two sites where they were discovered.

ULSTER Unionist MP Ken Maginnis was at the centre of controversy last
night after claiming that the IRA was about to embark on a ''rolling
resumption of violence''.
He claimed reliable sources had indicated a number of measures were
being adopted with the intention of provoking a degree of nationalist
support for the IRA's renewed activity.
This would involve street confrontations with the RUC, petrol bombing
in the hope that a plastic bullet fatality would elicit sympathy for the
IRA action, and that ''some imminent Government decisions have been
identified as benchmarks for militant action''.
Mr Maginnis's comments, however, have been heavily played down by a
number of sources, including Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick
Mayhew and the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
The matter was raised by the MP at Northern Ireland Questions in the
Commons yesterday but Sir Patrick said that while he was grateful for
the information Mr Maginnis had passed to the Government, he was the
only source for it.
Sir Patrick bluntly told the House: ''If there is any intention to
return to violence in Northern Ireland, it will be met with outrage from
the people of Northern Ireland.''
He backed this up with an assurance to Tory MP Andrew Robathan that
the security forces could quickly return to full alert. ''Nothing that
had been done to adjust the security response since the cease fire is
irreversible,'' he said. ''It can be reversed in a very short number of
days.''
Mr Maginnis had said in his earlier statement that clearly
Sinn-Fein/IRA believed that recommencing killing and destruction would
produce further Government concessions. It therefore was planned, in the
initial phases, to ''turn up and lower the level of activity as
appropriate''.
He said: ''The Government must immediately take steps to ensure it is
ready to meet this threat in an adequate manner and that both the Irish
Republic and the United States administrations are willing and prepared
to meet their obligations in support of those measures which will be
necessary to counter renewed terrorist aggression.''
The RUC officially dismissed Mr Maginnis's claim, stating it had no
evidence to support it, and, in the Commons, Sir Patrick Mayhew said
that while there was no going back on the Government's demand that the
IRA make some gesture towards decommissioning, dialogue still was seen
as the answer.
He told the Commons: ''We wish to establish beyond doubt that the
permanence of peace is truly intended. Therefore, we continue to press
Sinn Fein and the loyalist parties alike, to address the decommissioning
of arms and to continue with exploratory dialogue to that end.''
The Minister most closely involved in the talks process, Mr Michael
Ancram, made the point that peace was the key to future growth and
economic prosperity in Northern Ireland.
Sir Patrick defended his recent warning that cross-party talks on the
future of the province could go ahead without Sinn Fein if the IRA
refused to abandon its weapons.
''It was put to me that Mr (Martin) McGuiness (of Sinn Fein) had said
there was not a snowball's chance in hell of decommissioning taking
place until a political settlement had occurred, to which I replied
that, if that was the case, the political talks process would continue
in the absence of Sinn Fein. I cannot believe anyone in this House would
wish me to have replied otherwise.''
Pressed by Mr David Winnick, Labour MP for Walsall North, on whether
he was satisfied that whoever was elected Tory leader would be committed
fully to the peace process, he said: ''You are engaging in party
political games on something which is really far too serious for that.
Of course everybody in the present Government is fully committed to what
has come to be called the peace process.''
Labour's Northern Ireland spokeswoman Mo Mowlam urged Sir Patrick to
accept that political progress would be achieved only through dialogue.

THE actor Eric Cullen stood condemned yesterday at Hamilton Sheriff
Court, the helpless abuse victim who had himself become tainted by
paedophiles.
A strong sense of injustice will persist around the case particularly
after the tacit admission by various authorities that the charges might
not have been taken but for the celebrity of the accused.
The rise and fall of Eric Cullen contains many complex elements,
including that of genuine tragedy. That aspect, the horrifying sexual
history of the actor, did not appear to weigh heavily with the court.
One thing was also clear in court: Eric Cullen was not portrayed by
the Crown as a paedophile or as a sexual abuser of boys as the months of
rumour would have him.
It is also clear that Cullen opted to plead guilty to get the matter
out of his life so that he can begin a new chapter, but that is hardly
what justice should be about.
Equally, the vicious rumours that Cullen's sudden illness immediately
before his scheduled court appearance was nothing more than a dodge to
escape his just desserts is totally unfounded. The Herald has had access
to the medical reports on Cullen, compiled by a psychiatrist with a
national reputation, and they clearly indicate a man suffering acute
clinical depression who finally cracked under a load which had become
unbearable.
One couple in particular, the broadcaster Bill McFarlan and his wife,
Caroline, have been steadfast in their defence of Cullen.
McFarlan points out that the police fingerprinted all of the video
tapes in the house and found no fingerprint of Cullen's on any of the
offensive material. He simply had not used them.
Friends say he is totally shattered. He has lost more than #150,000,
possibly #200,000, in earnings in the last 18 months but he has lost
much more. There is a very public loss of innocence.
Yet it was Cullen's unthreatening persona, the ill-starred, 4ft 4in
comedy figure which made him loved.
He has been a hero to thousands of children, appearing at charity
events, opening fund raisers, producing and directing shows for schools.
His television show for children, Wemyss Bay 902101 was a hit and his
Wee Burney was one of the reasons Ian Pattison's show was required
viewing to English and Scots alike.
Underneath the clownish figure from Rab C Nesbitt lurked an entirely
different Burney; just how sinister depends on whose version of events
you accept.
The Crown clearly takes a simplistic view: that Cullen had
reprehensible tendencies, which, taken with the other pornographic
material in his possession meant there could be no convincing
alternative explanation for the photographic collection in his
possession. But they were unable to find among the vast haul of evidence
at his home any indication that he had ever physically abused boys.
Bill McFarlan maintains that none of the photographs actually belonged
to Cullen but that they were the property of his abuser, Frank Currens,
42. He was by contrast a classic paedophile. He is now serving a 14-year
jail sentence.
Cullen and his friends argue that he, Cullen, was a victim, first
sexually assaulted and abused by a relative in his adoptive family at
the age of 13 and then passed on to Currens who continued the abuse
until Cullen was 21.
That experience would not be unusual in a circle of child abusers -- a
safe victim being passed from one pervert to another for gratification.
On that first occasion, Cullen told The Herald, the relative had taken
him to the church where he was organist because the young Eric had
already shown his musical aptitude at the piano. Cullen loved music and
he trusted the man.
His innocent trust was rewarded in a lay-by near Hamilton by a crude
and brutal introduction to sex. He was a child who had never grown; he
dared not tell anyone. Like many abused youngsters he was thereafter
consumed by guilt, knowing that something terribly wrong had taken place
but thinking that he was part of the wrong.
By that time it had been long apparent that Cullen was not going to
grow; technically, he had been born achondroplasiac, a dwarf. He was
also born, he says, out of wedlock in Stranraer. Cullen was stigmatised
not once but twice.
Police insist they asked extensive questions of others and could find
no corroboration of Cullen's allegations that he was abused and then
blackmailed into keeping quiet.
The official line is that no other inquiry can take place until Cullen
himself makes a complaint against specific individuals. He and his
lawyer are considering that option.
Cullen assisted the police in identifying some of the young boys who
appeared in the photographs found in his home, but these were only
youngsters pictured by him in a totally innocent context. He could not
and did not identify any children in the pornographic pictures taken by
Currens.
It emerged that most of these youngsters came from Strathclyde and the
majority from the east side of Glasgow. In all, between 80 and 90 boys
were identified and the families visited.
By noting similarities in the videos, police realised that much of it
had been filmed locally in Strathclyde. The officers gradually built up
a picture of the man who kept reappearing.
At Curren's appearance, the High Court was to be told that the
material found in another house in the West of Scotland, which was not
disclosed at the time but which now emerges as Cullen's home, in which
Currens was seen performing sexual acts with youngsters, led to his
arrest. Eric Cullen's friends insist that Cullen had told the police
from the beginning that Currens was the man they really wanted.
One of the detectives told The Herald: ''These videos were horrendous,
the worst any of us had ever seen.''
He added: ''These were children who did not know about sexuality, what
was good or bad. This was their introduction to sexuality. It was a
constant parade of sexual practices with boys, no male-female sex.''
The side effects on the police themselves were disturbing. One officer
found himself going home and shoving his child away when he climbed on
his knee.
None of the videos filmed by Currens had been made at Cullen's home.
However, his involvement was becoming deeper, eventually reaching the
point where Currens used his house as a convenient dump for his
collection of pornography and could do so knowing that Cullen could
never object. It was a subtle form of blackmail, but blackmail none the
less. The Crown recognise this side of the case by the way in which they
have framed charges against Cullen.
But a question mark will always remain over Eric Cullen. How much did
he really know about the activities of Francis Currens involving
children and, if he knew anything, why did he remain silent?

BROADCASTER Bill McFarlan says that when Francis Currens was in
Peterhead Prison he was interviewed by the Crown and apologised for
abusing Eric Cullen.
''He was asked if Eric had ever been involved in these activities and
he said that he had never been. And he went on to apologise,'' says Mr
McFarlan.
''How can he apologise for the wrong that has been done? Eric Cullen
has been in jail, figuratively speaking, for the best part of two years,
and he is still in jail. This is not the case of Eric Cullen, it is the
case of Francis Currens being tried all over again. The trouble is the
two have become completely enmeshed.''
His friends believe that Cullen was repeatedly abused for around seven
years by Currens and a number of other men, including one Church of
Scotland minister.
Two or three years ago, when Cullen was appearing in pantomime, he
began receiving threatening calls from one of these male relatives and
he was blackmailed with threats of exposure to the tune of #7000.
Mr McFarlan adds: ''I first met Eric Cullen when we were making a
programme together to turn children away from bus vandalism. When the
publicity broke we had to call it off and it cost me money. I fervently
believe, however, that when you believe in someone then you should stand
by them.
''I think what has happened in court has happened because Eric is sick
of all of it and is not willing to risk more heartbreak and breakdown.
''It is obvious to me that serious police mistakes have been made all
along the line and that the victim is Eric Cullen. Who was pulling the
strings? It is very sinister. Were the police afraid of being blamed for
the publicity which almost blew the case against Currens?'' Mr McFarlan
asks.
He is convinced that Cullen had been more sinned against than sinning:
''The worst thing that can happen to someone who has been sexually
abused is for uninformed rumour and speculation to label him the abuser
instead of the victim,'' he said.
''Eric Cullen was very badly let down by the police when he needed
their help most. He gave them the evidence they needed against his
abuser and against two other men. As far as I am aware, nothing has been
done against these other two.
''Instead, there has been a relentless tide of rumour and publicity
about Eric. I believe the police, having lifted the lid slightly at the
start, could not then afford to loose face.
''The result is they have crucified Eric Cullen, simply because he was
famous.''

AMERICAN blues legend Fats Domino has been forced to cancel his two
shows scheduled for tonight in Glasgow's King's Theatre for health
reasons. Tonight's cancellation is the second in two months.
Originally, he had been scheduled to take part in Mayfest on May 19
but that performance was also called off because of his ill health and
postponed until tonight.
A spokesman for the ticket centre in Candleriggs last night said that
all tickets would be fully refunded if members of the public contacted
his office. No return date has been arranged.

THE Prince of Wales had his language skills put to the test yesterday
when the 12 pupils of the Isle of Coll primary school sang to him in
French . . . and a few minutes later native islander Mr Hugh MacKinnon
spoke to him in Gaelic.
After hearing the children sing, the prince said: ''The fact that you
can sing in French is marvellous -- you can probably do it in Gaelic,
too?''
No-one let on that, in fact, there is no Gaelic taught at the school.
Native islander Mr MacKinnon was left to test the prince's Gaelic. He
said: ''I asked him 'How are you?' and he answered that he was fine.''
The prince joked with six-year-old pupil Laura Oliphant, who gave him
a big grin despite the fact that she had a missing front tooth.
''Did you get money from the Tooth Fairy?'' asked the prince. ''50p,''
answered Laura.
The prince is the first royal to pay a visit to the tiny Inner
Hebridean island (pop 175).
Coll has no resident policeman, so the invasion of police and security
men kept islanders on their best behaviour -- well, almost.
Police thankfully saw the funny side when they returned to the island
guest house to find a joker had put ''Police, No Waiting'' cones right
across the entrance to the car park.
The prince also went on a private visit round the island's RSPB
reserve.
He looked at sand dune and machair areas and warden Mr Charlie Self
then told him about their work to save the corncrake.
Coll is one of the last breeding grounds of the rare bird.

<HEADLINE>Jailed for bid to smuggle drugs into prison</HEADLINE>

AN Aberdeen man, who tried to smuggle drugs, including heroin, into
Perth Prison by concealing them in his mouth, was sent to prison for a
total of five and a half years at the High Court in Aberdeen, yesterday.
Lord Osborne told Alan Bruce: ''The introduction of drugs into prisons
is a pernicious act because it causes all sorts of trouble with which
the authorities have to deal.''
The Crown said that the street value of the drugs involved was just
over #700, but claimed that in prison the value could increase to
between five and 10 times that figure.
This was disputed by Mrs Mhairi Richards, defence counsel, who said
her information was that the value of drugs in prison was twice that of
their street value.
Bruce, 23, a prisoner, pled guilty to charges of being in possession
of heroin and temazepam in Perth Prison with intent to supply, a charge
of being in possession of heroin while a prisoner in Perth, and two
charges of bail contravention.
Mr Paul McBride, advocate-depute, said Tayside Police received
information that Bruce was intending to deliver drugs to an inmate in
Perth prison and, after he was searched, it became apparent he was
concealing something in his mouth. He eventually spat out a wrapped
package containing the drugs.
Bruce maintained that he did not know the package contained heroin,
and thought it was ''hash and jellies''.
Six days later, while in prison at Perth, he was searched and officers
found some heroin in his trouser pocket.
Mrs Richards said that Bruce had been a cannabis user since he was 16
and had been introduced to heroin in 1993. He had been induced to take
the drugs into prison because he owed a dealer money. In prison he had
been suffering withdrawal symptoms and had been given some heroin by
another inmate.
Former accountant Alexander Muirden, 56, of Clunie Place, Aberdeen,
who appeared in the dock with Bruce, pled guilty to being in possession
of heroin at his home on January 20 this year with intent to supply, and
a charge of bail contravention. He was jailed for five years and one
month.
Mr McBride said drug squad officers who searched his house found
heroin with a street value of about #1700 in a locked attache case. He
told the police the case was not his and denied knowledge of the drugs.

NEW claims that the Princess of Wales leads a sad and lonely life were
dismissed by Buckingham Palace yesterday as ''yet more second-hand
tittle-tattle . . . full of inaccuracies''.
According to royal author Andrew Morton, the princess sometimes has to
take a gulp of vodka to steady her nerves before official engagements.
He claims in a new chapter to his best-seller Diana, Her True Story,
published in the Australian Women's Weekly, that the princess leads an
''almost monastic life'', shutting herself away all day. She is often in
bed by 8pm.
She has to take sleeping pills most nights, and vitamins and the drug
Prozac to counter her eating disorder, bulimia, he claims.
But a Palace spokesman was highly dismissive of the latest Morton
chapter.
''We are not going to dignify with detailed comment this latest
money-spinning project of Mr Morton's,'' he said.
''But it is clear that the latest chapter is yet more second-hand
tittle-tattle. What is more, it is full of inaccuracies.''
Mr Morton, whose book first revealed the unhappy marriage of the
Waleses, claims that the princess she now suffers increasing rages,
makes moody outburst against her staff, and has had a dwindling circle
of friends since her marriage break-up left her without a role.
Frequently the only diversion in her day is to go shopping, he claims.
Her seclusion at Kensington Palace is often interrupted only by visits
from her hairdresser, personal staff, and a specialist in allergy
treatments, according to Mr Morton.
The author's claim that she occasionally resorts to gulping vodka is
surprising.
The princess is known to be virtually teetotal and drinks only a
little wine for toasts at official or social functions.
Friends say she is not on medication in the way Mr Morton describes --
and that she does not take Prozac.
The new chapter gives the impression that the princess very rarely
sees the Queen. But it is known that she sees the Queen regularly -- and
informally -- at Buckingham Palace.
Morton writes that the princess makes weekly visits to her therapist,
Susie Orbach. On Thursday mornings, she travels to nearby Beauchamp
Place for colonic irrigation with Chryssie Fitzgerald and, for a time,
took kick-boxing lessons at Kensington Palace.
''The night before a session, the butlers moved furniture in the
drawing room to give the sparring partners space and Diana spent an hour
punching the arm pads worn by her trainer. It improved her agility and
helped release some of the anger she feels.''
A problem for butlers who field telephone calls while she is resting
is when Tiggy Legg-Bourke rings. She looks after her sons when they are
with Prince Charles.
''Tiggy is reluctant to speak to the princess and the feeling is
entirely mutual. Instead, messages are relayed, word for word, via the
butlers. Staff know there is hell to pay if either parent is misinformed
or in ignorance about any aspect of the boys' lives.''
Morton goes on: ''The reclusive atmosphere of Diana's home -- dubbed
'Bleak House' by a staff member -- is leavened when the boys spend a
weekend with their mother -- under their separation terms, Diana sees
the boys on alternate weekends when school holidays allow.''
They sit glued to the latest action movies, ride their BMX bikes
around the palace, or join their mother at the Chelsea Harbour Club,
where she works out and where they are learning to play tennis.
Morton also covers claims that the princess had an affair with her
former riding instructor, James Hewitt, saying she told anyone who would
listen that he had exploited their friendship by fabricating an
intimacy.
''Robustly, she denied his assertion that they were lovers, saying:
'It is fantasy. He wanted to have sex, but I never let it happen. I am a
married woman'.''
Morton claims that the princess is leading a quiet, almost monastic
life. ''The cloistered atmosphere at Kensington Palace is broken only by
the shrill sound of the telephone, an instrument which is at once her
confessional, her best friend, and her occasional doom,'' he writes.
''She worships daily at the temple of her body, rigorous in her
adherence to a Spartan diet of exercise, massage, therapy, and
medication. Often, the Princess of Wales is in bed by eight. Alone. Her
solitary existence concerns her rapidly dwindling circle of friends.''
She likes to telephone friends and regular callers include Lord
Palumbo, her lawyer Lord Mishcon, the Duchess of York, ''and, rather
surprisingly given past hostilities, her stepmother Raine''.

staff redundant as part of a reorganisation of its UK business
interests.
The cutback includes 14 of the 35 staff at the company's stationery
and diaries division at Westerhill, Bishopbriggs, which has been sold to
an undisclosed international company and is likely to cease
manufacturing in Glasgow later this year.
The firm's map-making unit is to be transferred from Edinburgh to the

LOCH Lomond's first patrol boat was launched yesterday as part of a
series of measures being implemented on Scotland's busiest loch to
control speeding power boats and jet skiers and protect wildlife.
The #83,000 boat will be manned by four rangers and, according to Loch
Lomond Park Authority, its main role is to assist the public and enforce
proposed speed-restricting by-laws.
However, earlier this month, it emerged that the Scottish Sports
Council had lodged an eight-page objection to the proposed new rules
which are currently being considered by the Scottish Secretary.
The proposed regulations will reduce boat speeds to 6mph within 150
metres of the shore and have been prompted by a series of accidents on
the loch over the last couple of years. Boats will also have to be
registered with the park authority and display lights at night.
The Scottish Sports Council objected on the grounds that the
regulations would apply 365 days a year when the peak season spans only
a few months in the summer.
It is understood that the park authority and Scottish Office officials
are to meet the Scottish Sports Council over the next couple of weeks.
However, yesterday a Sports Council spokeswoman said the council had not
been notified of any such meeting.
Launching the 25ft boat at Luss pier, park authority officer Nick
Pennington said navigational buoys had already been put on the loch.

AN exchange of letters in which the Poet Laureate urged Charlotte
Bronte to give up serious attempts to become a writer -- one of the
great put-downs of English literature -- sold for #41,400 at a London
auction yesterday.
The dismissive note from Robert Southey and the reply of the
20-year-old high-spirited young woman who went on to pen Jane Eyre, were
bought at Christie's by London antiquarian booksellers Maggs Bros.
Mr Southey, 42 years Miss Bronte's senior, told the aspiring writer in
the letter dated March 12, 1837, that he was reluctant ''to cast a damp
over the high spirits and the generous desires of youth'' and attempted
to bring her down to earth from ''the visionary world'' she evidently
inhabited.
He added: ''Literature cannot be the business of a woman's life and it
ought not to be. The more she is engaged in her proper duties, the less
leisure she will have for it . . . To those duties you have not yet been
called . . .You will then not seek in imagination for excitement.''
Miss Bronte, in awe of the man whose work she was soon to overshadow,
wrote back diplomatically, thanking him for his ''kind and wise advice''
but pointing out she was ''not altogether the idle, dreaming being it
would seem to denote''.

<TEXT>
A DIVORCED man has lost his appeal to the House of Lords over a ruling
giving his ex-wife a legal right to a share in his pension as a
''post-nuptial'' settlement.
In May, the Court of Appeal held, by a majority of two to one, that
56-year-old Anne Brooks was entitled to a share of the self-administered
pension scheme set up by her ex-husband, Douglas.
Two of the appeal judges said the pension scheme was part of the
family assets and empowered 65-year-old Mr Brooks, on retirement, to
surrender a portion of his pension for the benefit of a wife or
dependant.
It amounted to a ''post-nuptial'' settlement and the courts had
jurisdiction to vary it to make a limited pension provision for Mrs
Brooks.
Today, five law lords dismissed an appeal by Mr Brooks, who now lives
in Downe, near Orpington, Kent, against that decision.
Giving judgment, Lord Nicholls said Mr Brooks's pension scheme did
constitute a marriage settlement for the purposes of the 1973
Matrimonial Causes Act, and consequently the court was empowered to vary
it.
The features which brought it within the legislation were that Mr
Brooks, at his retirement, was to be entitled to elect to give up a
portion of his pension to provide, from the date of his death, a
deferred pension for life for his spouse or any other person financially
dependent upon him.
These death benefits were payable at the discretion of the company to
Mr Brooks's spouse, children, parents, and grandparents and the issue of
any of them.
The judge said the decision should not be seen as a solution to the
overall problem of how to treat pension rights on divorce.
There was general dissatisfaction with the state of the law, stemming
from the fact that on divorce the accrued pension rights of women were
not usually comparable with men's.

PEACE campaigner Gordon Wilson was buried yesterday beside the grave
of his daughter Marie, the young nurse whose hand he held as she died in
the rubble of the IRA Remembrance Day bombing in Enniskillen.
The Irish Republic's top politicians gathered in warm sunshine to
attend the funeral in the County Fermanagh town.
President Mary Robinson, Premier John Bruton, and Foreign Affairs
Minister Dick Spring were among the hundreds of mourners who gathered to
pay their last respects to a man on the other side of the religious
divide who pledged his life for an end to the conflict.
However, senior Ulster Unionists stayed away. Some of them never
forgave the man who forgave the IRA for the murder of his daughter in
the 1987 bombing outrage.
Mr Wilson, 67, a Protestant member of the Irish Senate, died of a
heart attack and it was his words of forgiveness after the Enniskillen
atrocity that moved the world.
Colin and Wendy Parry, whose son Tim was killed in the IRA's
Warrington bombing, sat with three friends in Mr Wilson's pew, five rows
back in the church's centre aisle.
As a service of thanksgiving was taking place, the constituency's MP,
Ken Maginnis, (Fermanagh South Tyrone) was at Westminster, warning of
new violence and an end to the IRA ceasefire that Mr Wilson had worked
so hard to help achieve.
Last night, Ulster Unionist Party general secretary Jim Wilson
insisted there had been no particular reason for none of the party's MPs
being at the funeral. No snub had been intended.
