Introduction by Councillor Hugh Halcro-Johnston, Convener, Orkney
Islands Council.
I AM delighted, on behalf of the people of Orkney, to welcome readers
to this special Herald supplement.
Although our islands are relatively small, it would be an impossible
task to try and include all that they have to offer in so few pages.
Instead we have tried to give just a taste of our unique life, culture
and environment which we hope will encourage a trip across the Pentland
Firth to enjoy more fully the ''Orkney experience''.
For those who already know our islands we hope you will find something
new and perhaps surprising within these pages, for Orkney is also a land
of the unexpected.
There can be few places where ancient history has merged so well with
modern living. In Orkney we are surrounded by our heritage and fiercely
proud of our distinct identity which has been forged throughout the
centuries from the days of the Picts and Norsemen, to the arrival of the
Scottish Earls. Our geographical position has also been an important
factor in shaping the character of the enviroment and the people.
Orcadians are a unique and ancient breed, in touch with the land, the
sea and their past. Although quiet by nature, you would be hard pressed
to find a more hospitable and generous community.
Despite our geographical remoteness, Orkney is a thriving, modern and
forward looking community. Some of the finest farming in Europe, a range
of successful and diverse businesses, a flourising tourist industry and
a key role in North Sea oil operations have all contributed to the
strong economy Orkney can now boast.
Advances in technology and communications have made considerable
inroads into cutting the distance between Orkney and the mainland
centres of population. Within the country itself we have made
considerble effort to ensure our outer isles are well served by first
class transport and communications links.
It is vitally important that these fragile island communities are
given the maximum support from both ourselves in Mainland Orkney, and
from the centres of power in Edinburgh, London and Brussels. Indeed, one
of the aims of this supplement has been to give an insight into life on
our outer isles, and not just the more frequently visited mainland.
Orkney is rapidly becoming a powerful voice for island communities
throughout Europe and we are leading the way in raising awareness at
national and European level of the special problems and issues that
affect our communities.
We must work hard to protect our history, our environment, our way of
life, whilst also embracing the future and the challenges that the
twenty-first century will being. We also want to share the pleasures of
Orkney with as many people as possible, while increasing understanding
of the special nature of life here.
We trust that you will enjoy this taste of Orkney and hope to see you
soon.

NFC has agreed to pay its former chief executive Peter Sherlock
#585,000 in an out-of-court settlement.
Mr Sherlock had sought #1.3m as compensation following his departure
after just 18 months in the job. There was thought to have been a clash
of management culture between Mr Sherlock's business-school style and
NFC's old guard.
The deal means that Mr Sherlock has netted almost #1m in compensation
payments over the past couple of years. He received #395,000 after he
left his previous job of running Bass's Holiday Inns hotel chain.
He was on a pay-and-pension package of #420,000 a year at NFC and the
group is reported to have responded to Mr Sherlock's High Court writ
with an offer of about #100,000. The sum agreed is to cover his costs,
compensation for loss of office and pension entitlement.
Mr Sherlock was NFC's first outside appointment as chief executive and
he was brought in to improve the trading performance. He instigated a
strategic review of the activities and was starting to implement its
conclusions.
While no reason for his resignation was given it is thought he was
proceeding too quickly to take other top management with him.

<HEADLINE>Firms shells out #4000 to speedy scallop cutter</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978370673</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SCALLOP cutter who quit his job when a bonus system was introduced
has been awarded more than #4000 in compensation.
Mr Paul McIlwraith, one of the fastest scallop cutters at Scotprime
Seafoods Ltd of Ayr, claimed he was constructively and unfairly
dismissed because the new system would substantially cut his earnings.
An industrial tribunal in Glasgow heard that he was among the highest,
if not the highest earner among the process workers at the factory at
Old Farm Road, Heathfield, Ayr.
Other workers would open scallop shells and scoop out the contents and
he would cut them. He was paid a bonus rate per kilo of scallops.
However, the company introduced a system last September which meant
workers operated in large teams and the bonus payments were shared among
them.
Management gave two reasons for the new system. One was that there was
an anomaly between the pay rates of the openers and the cutters, with
the cutters always earning more. The other was that absence rates were
higher towards the end of the week if workers felt they had earned
enough in the first half, meaning other workers had to be transferred
and had to do overtime.
The company accepted that the new system would have reduced Mr
McIlwraith's earnings substantially. It would also have meant he was
subsidising other workers at his own expense.
He told management that workers as a whole agreed to the new system.
In its findings, the tribunal said this was hardly to be wondered at,
because most of them would have profited by it.
The tribunal had no doubt that such a unilateral and far-reaching
decision represented conduct on the company's part which entitled Mr
McIlwraith to resign and treat himself as having been constructively and
unfairly dismissed.
The object of the change was not to save labour costs, the tribunal
added. It seemed it was to placate other workers who were not as
productive as Mr McIlwraith.
The tribunal awarded Mr McIlwraith, of James Brown Avenue, Ayr, #4020
compensation. Before the changes, he had earned #162 a week. He now has
another higher paid job as a chef.

AN Argyll reader writes to castigate The Herald for not giving enough
prominence to recent good Scottish export returns for the quarter
January to March. Apparently putting the story on the front page (as we
did last Tuesday) is not enough. In the course of those strictures, said
reader writes ''Even Alf Young could find no way of making it seem like
a disaster''.
There are times when I shuffle uneasily under this burden of being
regarded, in certain quarters, as some kind of Caledonian Cassandra,
always seeing the bottle as half empty, the cupboard half bare. Here was
me thinking I was simply doing my job, trying to dig away at the
underlying reality behind the presentational gloss which accompanies so
much economic news. And here are some of you thinking my chin,
Jeremiah-like, never lifts far from the floor.
As it happens, in the same week that the bullish Scottish Council
export survey made our front page, Government output figures for
Scotland's production and construction industries were consigned to the
bottom of an inside page of Scotland's Business. A rival publication in
the east -- at least in the edition I read -- didn't think them worthy
of covering at all.
These figures do deserve a little more mature reflection. They tell us
only about the non-service side of the Scottish economy, by far the
smaller part of the whole these days. And they emerge months late. In
this case the figures were for the final October-December quarter of
1994. But they are the only, relatively up-to-date official numbers we
have.
This time the gloss put on them by the Scottish Office is that, in
1994, output of Scotland's production industries rose by 2.3% on the
1993 levels, while Scottish manufacturing output jumped by 5.6% in the
same period, outstripping the equivalent 4.1% increase in the UK.
You have to read on a bit to discover that, in the quarter in
question, output of the Scottish production and construction sector --
and of the manufacturing segment within it -- actually fell by 0.3% and
0.5% respectively on the previous three months, compared with rises of
0.5% and 0.7% in the UK as a whole in the same period.
Now I know all the health warnings about reading too much into one
quarter's prone-to-revision figures. I approve of such warnings. But
this new fragment of evidence chimes well with earlier anecdotal and
survey reports that the recovery was flagging in Scotland in the later
stages of last year. On that apparent correlation, the Scottish Office
was silent.
But let us, as the Scottish Office did, take a longer-range view.
Let's not just compare 1994 with 1993. Given the conventional wisdom
that Scotland weathered the early 1990s recession better than the rest
of the UK, let's look at the overall pattern in output since before that
recession began to bite anywhere. When we do the picture grows very
confusing.
Between 1987 and early 1990, the output of Scotland's production and
construction industries (excluding oil and gas) underperformed the UK as
a whole, but largely stayed in touch with the general UK trend. Since
the second quarter of 1990, the position has been significantly
reversed. That same Scottish output has continued to rise, while UK
output has slid into a protracted downward cycle.
By 1994, Scottish output was up 5.7% on 1990, while UK output was down
2.5%. It's a similar story for manufacturing (the narrower index which
excludes construction, mining, and quarrying, the energy utilities and
water). Scottish manufacturing output in 1994 was up 5.9% on 1990, while
in the UK in the same period there was a fall of 0.9%.
Looks like game, set, and match for a genuine Scottish industrial
renaissance since 1990, doesn't it? It does, until you consider one more
graph which the Scottish Office statisticians helpfully append to this
quarterly series of numbers. It compares the trends in output of
Scottish manufacturing industry as a whole with output from the whole
sector minus its star player, the electrical and instrument engineering
industry, dominated by electronics.
Up until the end of 1990, these two graphs ran each other very close.
In other words, the performance of the Scottish electronics sector was
not out of line with the performance of Scottish manufacturing as a
whole. But since the start of 1991, the divergence has grown more and
more marked. While output from electronics has roared ahead, output from
the rest of Scottish manufacturing has been in almost inexorable
decline.
Between 1991 and 1994, output from electrical and instrument
engineering (electronics) has increased 73%, fuelled by booming export
demand for the personal computers, microchips, and other products
produced here. But, apart from a brief, weak rally in 1993, output from
the rest of Scottish manufacturing has slumped around 14% since its peak
in the second quarter of 1990.
The pattern can be seen in sector after sector. Output of food and
tobacco down 8% between 1990 and 1994. Drink down 2%. Mechanical
engineering down 21%. Transport equipment down 22%. Paper, printing, and
publishing down 5%. Textiles off 8%.
Some of the implications are crystal clear. As far as manufacturing is
concerned, the recovery has been very narrowly based. Only chemicals and
man-made textiles (output up a miserable 1% between 1990 and 1994) and
electronics have experienced real output growth. Everywhere else the
story is of continuing decline.
Total manufacturing accounts for 64.1% of the total production and
construction index. Electronics accounts for 11.8%. Chemicals accounts
for 5.2%. So, on these official figures, nearly three-quarters of
Scottish manufacturing has yet to experience any real recovery. We begin
to detect, do we not, some substantial reasons for the absence of any
widely held feel-good factor nearly three years into economic recovery.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's credibility has taken a battering in
recent days as the City begins to detect political backtracking on
interest rates and the control of inflation. But, on these Scottish
output figures at least, there are reasons for believing Clarke's
instincts are right. Much of Scottish manufacturing industry needs even
higher interest rates like it needs a hole in the head.

IT is Bursting Heart time in the cinema again as the movie business
revives its old, one-sided passion for the tortured central character
with the outraged hair. This love affair, often dementedly romantic, is
best seen at the moment in the new film about Beethoven with Isabella
Rossellini mooning over Gary Oldman as the livid Ludwig, riven with
professional and emotional travails.
When Ludi speaks even the dialogue pounds to a crescendo . . . I don't
just compose music, I compose life . . . you know the sort of thing. Of
course all this is in the grand, artistic tradition where authenticity
counts for nothing so, what we hear is not Beethoven talking but
Hollywood, and in a manner not disimilar from Joan Crawford's in one of
her early 1940s movies:
A leering sugar daddy is tinkling out a snatch of Chopin when he turns
to this sweet minx and asks if she likes music. ''Some symphonies and
all concertos,'' she purrs, her gold-digger eyes uplifted to the heavens
as she soothes his Steinway with a teasing hand.
Ever since the movie industry began, films about artists have enjoyed
enduring appeal but only on condition that the artist suffers. What this
indicates about public taste is that we need our geniuses to be trapped
in melancholia almost as revenge.
The nobility of the artist sworn to a unique vision despite the scorn
of philistines, the ridicule of critics, now that demands punishment.
Either through madness or preposterous behaviour the artist must be seen
to be doomed. Or as the playwright John Mortimer insists, he must ''be
swept on by the winds of his talent towards an early death''.
Interestingly those who actually conceive films are often artists
manques, people who started out with dreams of personal creation and
then, because they chose industry rather than a garret, found their
sensibilities reined in by the kind of constraints the artist regards as
betrayal. But by paying homage to the rejected prodigy within themselves
these movie makers may well be offering tributes to their own
predicament, those valiant, rebellious days when they too promised to
follow the Muse into whatever atelier or bedroom she might lead.
If this is the case then films such as Lust for Life, the Van
Gogh/Gauguin drama, Moulin Rouge, the Lautrec biography, and all Ken
Russell's madly gyrating fantasies on the theme of sex-raddled composers
might be no more than fitful essays in self-identification, odysseys
around the film director's ego. Thus, there is no room for moderation;
the heroism has to be inflated, the brilliance a rampaging flame.
Consumptive writers, their hair furiously tousled, attack a naked page
with crazed expressions but break off just in time to belt across town
in a pleurisy-inducing downpour for that illicit rendezvous with the
art-swooned wife of some eminent lawyer.
In the vintage days of Hollywood many of the best screen writers,
cameramen, and set designers were indeed artists who had gravitated to
America's blossoming and most exciting industry before cost
effectiveness moved in as the screen's controlling force. At first no
compromises were necessary. Classy, literate scripts from Scott
Fitzgerald, e.e cummings, Dorothy Parker, and Anita Loos were in demand.
But it wasn't long before their influence was over-ridden by the kind of
studio big shot who, despite the attentions of a master tailor, still
looked like a goitered rhinoceros.
Retaliating, the artist/scenarist learned how to play out his mounting
contempt for the industry by transferring to film something of his own
tussles with the blockhead class. But the studios wanted hot stuff so
this was another reason that the allegory had to be extreme. The
real-life enemy, of course, was translated into tyrannical gallery
owners, publishers and impresarios, a sleek bunch of double-dealing
bullies. All artists, meanwhile, were portrayed as impoverished but
utterly irresistible to women. Raffish and intellectual, carousing with
the demi-monde while exploring ideas with Zola, they suffered but they
had a ball.
Yet this subversive art clique behind-the-scenes didn't always win. A
young director, going through the rushes with Sam Goldwyn, once
suggested that in a particular sequence they should use a little light
Debussy. ''Hell, no,'' said the studio Titan through his minced cigar.
''Nobody uses my films to advertise cheap, French wine.'' Maybe that's
fiction, maybe it's not. But today the sorcery of special effects
computers will no doubt cast their own spell on the artist movie. Think
of it . . . a scene where Van Gogh, blazing with inspiration, stitches
his ear back on.

THE re-election of President Carlos Menem in Argentina is happy proof
of democracy back in fashion. When the world has, in so many ways, waxed
worse in our days, we can at least draw hope from a widespread return to
popular rights in place of totalitarian fear. The Iron Curtain has
collapsed. The Philippines are rid of Marcos. A succession of evil men
-- Stroessner of Paraguay, Banda of Malawi, Pinochet of Chile, Mengistu
of Ethiopia -- have been cast down. And good riddance too; will the
Church of Scotland, by the way, ever get round to deposing Banda as an
elder?
At worst, such oustings send powerful moral warning to despots round
the world. And at best, where genuine democracy has displaced tyranny,
and where the criminal state has fallen to the rule of law, these lands
and peoples send us hope.
Argentina is one of the wealthiest and most beautiful states in Latin
America. It is also richly cosmopolitan. In the general neo-Iberian
caste of South America's population, Argentina has a rich mosaic of
culture; the Italians, the Irish, and the Germans have a long history
here, and Argentina has even had an Irish President.
Eva Peron has a glamorous place in international legend. Argentina's
staging of the 1978 World Cup still evokes shudders in our own national
psyche. On the other hand, wee Diego Maradona -- pastimes: snorting
cocaine and scoring goals with his hand -- must be something of a
national hero in Scotland. Where would hapless bachelors be without Fray
Bentos and their tasty tins of processed cow?
But not so very long ago -- even when Ally's Army landed there in the
summer of 78, replete with hubris and hayfever pills -- the lovely land
was in the grip of a great evil. A ruthless military junta had its grip
on power. Thousands of harmless people were jailed, beaten, and
tortured. Thousands more -- mostly students; many teenagers -- simply
vanished. To this day Los Disparados, lost sons and daughters, friends
and lovers, haunt Argentina's soul.
Then, in 1982, the regime of General Galtieri -- misreading Britain's
intentions towards the Falkland Islands, or perhaps reading them all too
well -- went to war. The ''Malvinas'' never, in fact, belonged to
Argentina; Britain took them from Spain, a century and a half before the
1982 conflict, long before the Argentine state came into being. But the
islands lie on Argentina's continental shelf. They depend for provisions
on Argentinian ports. And the Argentinians, reasonably enough, regard
Britain's continuing grip on the rocky outpost as an affront to common
sense and to the Republic's international standing.
No-one can defend the 1982 invasion. Though the initial attack cost
not one British life, that was more by Providence than judgment. The
Falklanders -- largely of British extraction, many British-born --
viewed prospects of life under Argentina's vicious regime with less than
delight. Nor was Argentinian rule, in the dozen weeks it lasted, a model
of tolerance and sensitivity.
The Thatcher Government had not long been in power when it passed a
Nationality Act which, among other provisions, casually stripped many
Falklanders of British citizenship. Careless hints were dropped in
Buenos Aires ears that the United Kingdom had no long-term interest in
the archipelago. The withdrawal of the doughty HMS Endurance, the only
Royal Navy presence in the area, was announced. Galtieri misread these
signs and, desperate for some martial fame to distract the mob from
sufferings at home, went to war. His intentions were plain for weeks.
Military preparations were an open secret. But until the last possible
moment our Conservative Government refused to accept what was happening.
The Falklands war had to be fought. No responsible British Government
could have left these people to the tender mercies of such an
administration.
But, above all, of course, it was fought because Margaret Thatcher's
survival as Prime Minister depended on it. Victory sustained her in
power for years to come, and may have been the decisive deathblow for
the ambitions of the SDP/Liberal Alliance. Failure would have led to her
resignation, perhaps even a premature General Election. We would
probably have seen Francis Pym as Prime Minister.
Thatcher's personal motive was not illegitimate, but it should be
frankly admitted.
The wonder is that we won the war at all. Recovery of the Falkland
Islands must be hailed as one of the greatest military feats of our era;
from bases thousands of miles distant, a successful seaborne invasion
was launched that overcame an occupying force considerably outnumbering
its attackers. It was a much closer thing than is widely recognised. Low
morale on the Argentinian side -- troops were mostly pubescent
conscripts -- and the lazy cowardice of the Argentinian Navy (after the
sinking of the Belgrano, their admirals did sod-all to turn the tide)
were decisive factors. The decision to sink the Belgrano, I am afraid,
was entirely justified, though Mrs Thatcher should not have lied about
it.
Well, we won the war -- at great human cost; hundreds and hundreds of
dead Argentinian boys, a couple of hundred dead Britons, many survivors
who came home scarred physically and psychologically -- and, in
Argentina, the people won the peace. Galtieri's gamble failed. Within
days the mob ousted him. Argentina has since recovered her liberties;
there have been two democratically elected Presidents, three fair polls,
and full soulbaring scrutiny of the past. Los Disparados have been
avenged.
We still today hold the Falklands. And we do so at crippling public
cost, maintaining an arsenal of weaponry and a garrison of soldiers to
defend something not very important from something not very nasty. Is it
not time, perhaps, to face present realities rather than past
atrocities? And to accept that, geographically and logically, these
islands are Argentinian and should -- with all due caution and
safeguards -- be at last given over to Argentinian sovereignty?
President Menem, re-elected, has pledged to work peacefully for the
return of the Malvinas. We wish him well.

REMEMBER the 1950s? Remember reading the American comics and aching
with longing for the goodies advertised but there was no chance because
even if you could get the dollars you didn't have a zip code not to
mention a state or a zone.
Prepare to ache all over again with the publication of a book called
Hey Skinny! Great Advertisements from the Golden Age of Comic Books. It
is a compilation of such goodies as:
* The Invisible Helmet. ''Put on this helmet and nobody can see your
face. But you can see everything. This is a sensational discovery -- as
new as the hydrogen bomb, as exciting as a ride through space . . .
Think of how you can fool your friends! Think of how you can put it on
and not be recognised!'' Except, perhaps, by your friends who know
you've spent $2 on a red and blue plastic helmet.
* The Monkey Face. A cartoon of scenes at a party illustrates the
social benefits of wearing this rubber mask. ''The mystery Monkey Man
sure has the girls all agog,'' says one admiring onlooker. ''Boy! Would
I have fun with that monkey face,'' says another. For those attracted to
the concept but who don't wish to go simian, other masks in the range
include ''Idiot'' and ''4 Eyes''.
* Or you can become the owner of a real monkey. ''This cute little,
miniature monkey needs a home and you can have one . . .'' It fits in
your hand or in your pocket, lives on bread and milk, and can be yours
for persuading 20 of your friends or neighbours to have their
photographs developed by the company concerned. The monkey offer is only
on while stocks last.
Sex, of course, rears its head with an offer to women: ''Do you want
to make men obey you?'' Then what you need is a bottle of Chez-elle
perfume. ''Can you make strong men weak?'' You will if you dab on some
Blue Passion. ''Do you want to marry now?'' get your swain in the
proposing position toute suite with Lovescent.
For chaps who have not yet been dominated, made weak, or duped into
proposals of marriage via the olfactory organ, there is always the Kiss
Me Necktie which ''girls can't resist as it glows in the dark. By day, a
lovely swank tie, by night a call to love in glowing words . . . Like a
miracle of light there comes a pulsing, glowing question -- Will you

Far and wide
THE Diary's old chum Rab C Kelly, an impresario who openly admits
responsibility for various shows at the Glasgow Pavilion, has been
telling us of a regular feature of his mailbag. Invariably when he
launches an album by one of his stable of Scottish singers, he is
bombarded with Scottish songs by would-be lyricists. Latest example, in
response to a release by Dean Park: a song called Glasgow Will Always Be
My Home. Penned by a songwriter who lives in Hayes, Middlesex.
Drowning sorrows
WE return to the subject of sure signs of inebriation, a theme which,
for some reason, we had forgotten about. It is confession time, on
behalf of her husband, by Irene McKeown of Glasgow. Her husband had
popped out for a pint one not-too-bad summer's day, clad in jeans and
short-sleeved shirt.
Many, many hours later his arrival home was heralded by the dogs who
had detected some activity at the front gate. Irene spent five minutes
perfecting the frosty face but there was still no husband at the front
door.
A quick recce of the garden revealed him to be lying sound asleep
under the hedge. Efforts to awaken him by the dogs (the odd lick on the
face) and the wife (the odd pummel in the ribs) both failed.
Deciding against leaving him to develop hypothermia, Irene opted to
drench him with a bucket of water. Being a kind soul, she even put in
some hot water.
The treatment worked, although not immediately. Irene had time to
return indoors and watch her now relatively awake husband make his way
to the front door whereupon he enters with the words: ''My God, that was
some downpour''.

ONE of the most successful aspects of this touring production by
Dogsbodies theatre company is the musical accompaniement by cellist Mary
Stabler. Her combination of wistful airs and the insistent plucking of a
solitary string -- invoking the urgent call of a foetal heartbeat --
achieves a more eloquent expression of the frustration of a woman
thwarted in her desire to be a mother than the script manages.
Frances Corr's play has a heartfelt honesty and some fine lines, such
as the single mother who encapsulates how poverty seeps the spirit with
the admission ''sometimes I get so pissed off I can't even be bothered
winding my Hoover cable up,'' but her drama asks too many questions and
comes up with too few answers.
Chris's biological clock is not just ticking, the alarm has gone off,
sending the 36-year-old woman into a panic-flecked frenzy to have a
baby. When she announces this intention her friend Jane, a single mother
with two boys, urges her to cherish her independence while her married
sister Maureen insists she finds a husband first. Chris insists that she
can go it alone but her determination to ''get a lumber'' and get
pregnant eventually wilts when faced with the practicalities of the
situation, although, somewhat surprisingly the danger of unprotected sex
with a stranger is not considered.
The moral themes around Chris's decision are never adequately
explored, perhaps because a male viewpoint is not voiced and the play
lacks a dramatic kernel.
The narrative, fuelled by extensive monologues from the three women
which offer little beyond lengthy descriptions of their lives,
constantly stalled and never fulfilled its initial promise, although the
performances were assured and the staging poised.

THE politics of incarceration have been so rehearsed and played out in
modern literature, both for the stage and elsewhere (viz. the literary
legacy of the Beirut hostages) that it is difficult to guess at what
else might be said. But if Sladjana Vujovic's play, revived here by
Chopp'd Logic after its Edinburgh Festival Fringe success in 1993,
springs no great surprises, it sets about doing what it does in an
assured manner.
There are many well-turned ideas in the piece. The prisoner reduced to
self-loathing who is convinced by his tormentor that even the act of
continuing to exist is one of rebellion. A catechism of praise to ''the
noble Kommandant'' that is so absurd it is genuinely shocking. The
notion of history as a consolation from the horrors of the present and
the absence of a future. And all of it rendered with a glorious black
humour, like the concept of negative discrimination in being spared
death because of one's (female) sex.
With a simple floorcloth, bulkhead lights, sporadic outburst of
garbled radio broadcasts, and a couple of steel ammo boxes and a bucket
for props, the focus is starkly on the trio of William Leslie, Bill
Wrightman (who also directs), and Marj Hogarth as they act out the
power-games of captor and captive. And very fine they are too, until
Vujovic's script is seduced by the theatricality of it all and we are
treated to a play-within-a-play. As a means of reinforcing the point it
is unnecessary and as a way of resolving the piece it is ultimately a
bit of a cop-out. Unless, of course, the work is really about the
futility of theatre.

JACK McGinn survived a challenge to his position as vice-president of
the SFA when Falkirk chairman George Fulston failed to win enough
support to oust the former Celtic director who was up for re-election at
yesterday's annual meeting of the association.
There are an increasing number of people within football who believe
that McGinn, who does not have a directorship of a club, should stand
down and Fulston was encouraged to put himself forward, but, as often
happens in football elections, people change their minds at the last
minute.
The voting was 52 to 31 in McGinn's favour and he now moves into his
third year as vice-president and the president, Bill Dickie, also
continues in office.
Before the annual meeting, an extraordinary meeting was held during
which an amendment to article 180 was carried by 73 votes to five. The
amendment was proposed because of recent experiences with regard to the
arbitration tribunal which is hearing evidence from Celtic and
Kilmarnock, who have been disputing compensation for 10 months.
Kilmarnock want money for the loss of manager Tommy Burns and his
assistant Billy Stark, who left at the end of last season to manage
Celtic and in order to avoid in the future some of the problems which
have arisen in the current case.
Celtic also proposed an amendment, which Rangers seconded, but they
were unsuccessful and article 180 will be altered to make it clear that
a tribunal will have automatic powers to assess and award damages.
The Old Firm were concerned that they were signing away their right to
go to court, but, like Fulston, they weren't able to find enough
support.
''We would like clubs to settle their disputes mutually, but an
arbitration tribunal is not a halfway house to somewhere else,'' said
SFA chief executive Jim Farry.
He added that he hoped the current dispute was on the homeward course
and that a further meeting is scheduled. That meeting will take place on
May 22.

COLIN Hendry, who was last seen celebrating Blackburn Rovers'
premiership triumph on Sunday, will not travel with the Scottish squad
which leaves tomorrow for the Kirin Cup tournament in Japan, writes
James Traynor.
The central defender, who would have been captain on the tour, will
have surgery this week to repair a damaged ankle and it is also unlikely
he will play in the European Championship qualifying match against the
Faroe Islands next month.
With Hearts defender Craig Levein also injured, the manager, Craig
Brown, has called in former Celtic centre half Derek Whyte, who won the
last of his six caps against Italy at Ibrox in November 1990.
Whyte was transferred to Middlesbrough for #950,000 three months
before his last cap and Brown has been impressed with the 26-year-old's
performances at the back for the Ayresome Park side who have just won
the Endsleigh first division.
Hendry had been carrying his injury for some time, but Blackburn
Rovers' manager Kenny Dalglish didn't want anyone to know until after
the season had finished.
Hendry's absence means only three first-choice players -- Jim
Leighton, Colin Calderwood and Alan McLaren -- will be in Japan for the
matches against Japan and Ecuador and, regardless of what anyone says,
it hardly seems worth the trouble.
From the stand-by squad, Brown has called in Scottish first division
player of the year Stephen Crawford of Raith Rovers, Paul Lambert of
Motherwell, Hearts' John Robertson, and Dundee United's Billy McKinlay.

DUNFERMLINE manager Bert Paton is fed up waiting. He, and play-off
opponents Aberdeen, want to get the matter of who plays premier-division
football next season over as soon as possible.
Yet the club who finished second in the first division, and the
Pittodrie side who were second-bottom in the top league, are forced to
sweat it out under orders from senior League officials.
Paton was direct: ''We're told Aberdeen are ready now. We are ready
now. Why in heaven's name do we have to wait until May 21 at Pittodrie,
and then May 25 at East End Park?
''The pressure for both sides is bad enough without adding another
fortnight to it, especially since we will know what happens with the
English results in the meantime. The games could have been played on
Monday and Thursday of this week.''
On top of that, an allocation of only 2500 tickets to the Fifers for
the Pittodrie leg also has caused aggro. ''We could have taken double
that,'' said the manager.
Paton, of course, has maintained from the word go this season that the
play-off situation would be controversial. And especially now that he's
involved in it, he asks the question which he knows high-powered
politics answered last season when they put in place the present system
for five years.
But now he can add names to his argument: ''As second-placed club in
the first division, we should go up by right. Aberdeen, in second-bottom
spot in the premier should go down.
''Let's face it, why should either club be different from Dumbarton in
the second division and Montrose in the third -- both promoted in second
place -- and Ayr United or Meadowbank going down as second-bottom clubs?
''Conversely, you could ask why were these four not given the
opportunity of a play-off.''
Paton's remarks are born out of obvious frustration following a
combination of the second disappointing season in a row -- remember, the
Fifers broke all club points and goal-scoring records last season, yet
lost out by only a point to the one promoted club, Falkirk.
One point Paton would not be drawn into, of course, is the financial
implications of failure once more, when so close to a premier place. The
club are full-time, are reported to be around #3m in the red, and have a
stadium, which, quite frankly, is in need of a considerable amount of
revival.
Premier-division football would give them the chance of a major
Football Trust grant to redevelop; would give them the gates to bring in
much more needed cash; would give their full-time staff the chance of
remaining so.
Similar could be said of Aberdeen, but there is little doubt that if
they had to miss out, full-time football would continue in order to pull
them back. And, of course, they already have the all-seated stadium.
There is also the agonising thought that if the teams are level on
aggregate -- away goals do not count double -- there will be extra time
at East End Park in the second leg. Failure to reach a decision will
lead to the dreaded penalties.   What a way to win a war.

* ROY Aitken yesterday took another step towards ensuring Aberdeen
remain a power by tying all his starlets to Pittodrie.
The caretaker manager signed up the last of the 18 youngsters who were
out of contract at the end of the season to boost the club's future
plans.
He said: ''This is a very encouraging indicator that these youngsters
have committed themselves to the club by signing new deals. They realise
they will always get their chance here.
''We have always had a prolific youth policy here and it is important
that we continue to get back-up from it.''
0 Aitken also is adamant his players are ready for the challenge
against Dunfermline. He insisted: ''It will be hard, because Dunfermline
will fancy their chances after scoring so many goals and doing so well
in the first division.
''Now it is time for us to be utterly single-minded. We have two games
left to save ourselves -- two cup finals, really -- and there are no
distractions.
''I can tell from the dressing room that the players are in the right
frame of mind. Sunday cannot come quickly enough.
''If they maintain the same consistency and level of performance, they
will do well against Dunfermline.''
Scotland striker Scott Booth, operated on last week for a
long-standing pelvic injury, will give up his summer holidays to gain
match fitness. Aitken added: ''The surgeon tidied up the problem and
Booth is now back in light training.''
More immediately, Stephen Wright is to delay his honeymoon to play his
part in the fight for premier survival. The 22-year-old defender also
has been told he must train with his Pittodrie team-mates on Saturday --
just two hours before his wedding.
Aitken explained yesterday: ''Stephen has known for several weeks now
that the play-offs were a distinct possibility. His wedding had to be
arranged months ago, but the couple know they can go off on honeymoon
any time after our season is over.''

RANGERS' leading crocks, Ally McCoist, Andy Goram, and David Robertson
have been ordered to work their way back to fitness during the close
season.
The trio, who missed so many of Rangers' vital games during last
season, will have a special summer regime arranged to have them at a
peak for the start of next season.
Manager Walter Smith yesterday stressed: ''The players who have had
lengthy spells out of the team will have their family holidays but,
apart from that, they will be in here at the ground on a regular basis.
''Training shedules will be arranged for them designed to have them
back to fitness for the new season. Some of the other players who missed
out will also be coming in but these three, in particular, will be
working for just about the whole of the summer break.''
Not that the summer break is going to allow the players much time to
relax. Rangers, because of the Champions' Cup, will bring their men back
to Ibrox for pre-season training on July 5, less than two months away.
Explained Smith: ''We are operating on the understanding that we will
be expected to play in the preliminary round of the European Cup, and
the first leg is scheduled for August 9.
''At the moment we have three games arranged on a tour of Denmark and
then our own Ibrox tournament at the end of July. After that we want one
more game, a big game against top opposition away from home, to complete
our preparations.''
Smith obviously does not want to take any chances of slipping up again
as the Scottish champions did last season against AEK of Athens.
He seems sure that the Ibrox men will again miss out on being seeded,
and thus gaining automatic entry to the Champions' League.
There even were doubts being expressed in England yesterday over
Blackburn's entry, but UEFA insist that nothing will be decided on the
seeding until next month.
Meanwhile, midfielder Ian Durrant has signed a new three-year deal
with Rangers, one which will effectively see the player end his career
at Ibrox.
Said Smith: ''Ian played well for us towards the end of the season and
he has earned this new deal.''

OLD war-horse Mark Hughes is a Wembley certainty as Manchester United
manager Alex Ferguson seeks to avoid finishing the season empty-handed.
Leaving out the Welsh striker at West Ham was a gamble that possibly
cost United the championship.
It was the most controversial selection in a season when Ferguson has
not always permed his massive resources with conviction. Only when
Hughes replaced young Nicky Butt in a more orthodox formation for the
second half at Upton Park did his side come close to wresting the win
and the title from Blackburn.
With Andy Cole cup-tied for Saturday's FA Cup final against Everton,
Ferguson will not make the same mistake twice in a week.
Hughes' invaluable cup experience -- his last-gasp equaliser in the
1994 FA Cup semi-final against Oldham ensured the Old Trafford side
eventually lifted the trophy -- will also be vital.
Ferguson faces other dilemmas, notably whether to risk the fitness of
Ryan Giggs, who has not played since the semi-final replay against
Crystal Palace on April 12, but is close to full recovery from his
hamstring injury.
With Roy Keane showing no reaction to an ankle injury in his comeback
game, Butt or Brian McClair could become the Wembley fall-guy.
But whatever team he picks, he is confident they will raise themselves
and rescue his seventh trophy in nine years from the wreckage of the
championship.
''The players are gutted -- you are when you get as close to winning
the League as we did. But they have handled adversity before and will do
so again. We won't take this lying down and will bounce back for the Cup
Final.
''The players have marvellous character. They have done themselves
proud. It was a gallant effort and it is still fantastic to finish in
second place.
''Now we have the cup final. We will be ready for it.''

<HEADLINE>Blackburn manage to find right man - and the money Dalglish knows its thanks a million to Uncle Jack</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHENEVER anyone mentions Uncle Jack Walker's millions, Blackburn
Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish must allow himself a wry smile.
It's as if no other club has spent millions of pounds on buying
players, as if all the top teams in the country have reared their own
talent and then gone ahead with their challenge for the major honours
the game can provide.
The truth is far different. To compete at the top today needs money,
and the right man to spend that money. That's where Dalglish comes in.
When Jack Walker brought the Glaswegian back into management after he
had sat on the sidelines following his shock departure from Liverpool,
he did not do it out of misplaced sentiment.
A person who can make a fortune of #400m cannot be anyone other than a
hard-headed businessman, and that's why Walker went for the man who now
has delivered him the Premiership title he had dreamed of winning.
Yesterday Dalglish said: ''The great thing about winning the title
this time is that we have been able to give something to the town of
Blackburn and to Uncle Jack, something they hoped for, but did not ever
expect to win.
''At the other clubs I have been with, there has been a level of
expectation. At Celtic and at Liverpool, people looked for you to win
trophies.
''And when you look around at other major clubs such as Manchester
United and Rangers, then you know that the support and everyone
connected with the club is looking for success whenever the season
begins.
''It has been different here, and that is maybe why it has been so
satisfying for myself and the players.
''You know the celebrations in the town have been tremendous, but I
don't really think it has sunk in. I doubt if the people recognise just
what has happened this week.''
Dalglish, naturally, plays down his own role. He points to his players
and emphasises the efforts they have made. He stresses the support of
Uncle Jack, and of the Blackburn people.
Yet it is Dalglish who has helped most to make their dreams come true.
Dalglish was the man who bought Alan Shearer, and who was told he had
wrecked the transfer market beause he paid four million pounds for the
player. You would not be able to buy him for anything under #10m now.
Dalglish was the man who remained convinced that he had a team capable
of winning the Premiership even though few of them had ever touched such
dizzy heights before.
Dalglish was the man who was ready to back his judgment in the
transfer market as people accused both he and Walker of simply ''buying
the title''.
He never saw it that way. Yesterday he pointed out: ''Look at any of
the top teams and tell me which club has not spent a lot of money on
players. It is the only way nowadays. Any manager in the game would tell
you the same.
''I don't feel I have to justify anything. We have been building
something here and now we have won the title we wanted, and the building
will go on. I don't want to start talking about the future right away
because we have to give everyone connected with the club a chance to
celebrate.
''Then we will sit down and look at what lies ahead. But you don't
just come to a stop because you have won something. That isn't the way
in this game, is it?''
It has never been Dalglish's way, that's for sure. The title win with
Blackburn makes him the first manager to win a championship with
different clubs since Brian Clough did it first with Derby and then
Notts Forest.
In his managerial career he also did the League and Cup double with
Liverpool but, quite genuinely, Dalglish does not want to be drawn into
talk right now of his own place in the record books.
He says: ''I don't want to go into all that. This is about now, about
this club, and about the players here who have done magnificently this
season. People will talk about the last day and the fact that we lost at
Anfield and yet still won the title.
''But it is never just about the last match when you take the league
championship. It is about the whole season and how players perform over
the season. And it's about someone like Alan Shearer who scores almost
40 goals for the club.
''We picked up 89 points this season, just three short of the
Manchester United total last time round. Sometimes this league can be
won with a total in the mid-80's or even less. So no-one can say we did
not deserve to win.
''There were a lot of very good teams around this season -- Manchester
United, Liverpool, Newastle United, Notts Forest, Spurs, and yet our
lads were able to do it. That's a tribute to all of them
''When Manchester United won it they had been 27 years without a title
. . .at this club it has been 81. No one is around who can say they
really remember it happening, and so we have been able to give this
community something they have never known before.
''That's a bit special.''
But the people of Blackburn, that once-upon-a-time Lancashire mill
town with it's ranks of red bricked Coronation Street-styled homes, may
not have to wait too long before they next savour success.
The potent combination of Uncle Jack Walker's fortune and the
restless, driving ambition of Dalglish will see to that.

* ERIC Cantona said FIFA were ''nice people'' after they allowed him
to play in a charity match near Paris.
The Manchester United star, banned until September 30 for his attack
on a Crystal Palace fan, received special permission to play for the
benefit of Michel Platini's foundation to help drug addicts.
Cantona scored a goal for an All-Star XI in the 2-2 draw against a
local amateur side. The game was played in front of only a few hundred
people.

ON Thursday the Commons is to debate the first report of the committee
chaired by Lord Nolan, set up by the Prime Minister last year to take
the ''sleaze'' factor out of public life. Today the Nolan Committee
considers what to do next.
It has made its recommendations on the conduct of MPs, which have been
widely accepted. Now the opposition parties want to use Nolan to harass
the Prime Minister and the Tory party about where they raise their
funds. Basically, it is the Tory party versus the rest, although the
arguments against full disclosure of serious contributions to political
parties is on the wane.
Lord Nolan appears to be content with his committee's remit for its
first three years. The plan is for the committee to turn its attention
now to the conduct of peers, and then to move on to the activities of
Freemasons. One can well see that this could usefully occupy Nolan for
the remaining years before the next General Election.
The committee is an ''all-party'' one. Lord Nolan seems keen to
maintain a non-political profile. A party political funding inquiry
could destroy this profile, he suggests.
On Thursday, MPs will use the opportunity of the Nolan debate to air
their opinions about party political funding, if only to embarrass the
Tories to the maximum. Nolan Committee members Peter Shore (Labour) and
Lord Thomson of Monifieth (Lib/Dems) have already stated that they think
party funding should come within the remit of the committee.
But the bald fact is that if one party, in this case the Tories, does
not agree, the remit cannot be changed or expanded.
All other parties now disclose in one way or another the source of
significant funding. Labour, for example, has a rule that anything over
#5000 has to be declared, although that new rule has yet to be applied.
Naturally, Labour is convinced that Tory party finances (there is still
about #16m debt) will be rescued as a General Election approaches by
knights who wish to remain anonymous. If this avenue of funds can be
denied the Tories, Labour (currently in surplus) will be delighted.
Both Nolan and the Government are likely to rest their case for no
inquiry on the fact that only last March the all-party House of Commons
Select Committee on Home Affairs reported on party funding. Its key
recommendations were:
''We do not believe that a case has been made out for requiring
disclosure of the identity of donors; where donations are made from
identifiable and legitimate sources known to the party they should be
allowed to remain private.''
There should be no limit to what a donor can give; company law
disclosure protects the public, so parties should not be required to
disclose institutional donations; parties should not be obliged to
refuse foreign donations.
The committee recommended a code of practice which has been accepted
by the parties. This obliges them to tell donors that money does not buy
influence or honours; illegally obtained money is not acceptable;
substantial anonymous donations would be refused; donations from foreign
governments and rulers will be refused.
The concept of ''total transparency'' cannot be attained for practical
reasons, concluded this committee. ''In a free society which cherishes
the secret ballot we believe that it would be wrong to oblige the
disclosure of commitment to a political party by a requirement to
identify financial benefactors.''
The idea of state funding of political parties was rejected. This has
been on the boil since 1975/76 when the then Prime Minister, Harold
Wilson, established the Houghton Committee to examine the possibility.
Houghton recommended that parties should be state-funded. But there was
a powerful minority report from committee members Sir Tatton Brinton
(Tory), Julian Havilland (ITN), Professor Donald MacCormick (SNP), and
Ian Aitken (Guardian) recommending the opposite.
Their view was that parties that are unable to raise money from the
public to support their causes should not be permitted state subsidy.
Money is a measure of political support. Last March the Home Affairs
Committee took the same view as the Houghton minority.
The Nolan Committee is unlikely to fracture on the issue of party
funding, but on Thursday this will not stop Mr Major's political rivals
from insinuating that the Tories have something to hide.

FALKIRK'S Steve Kirk has received a severe warning from the SFA that
he should be careful about kicking the ball out of the park in future.
That arises from an incident during the match against Hearts on April
1 when Kirk, noticing that one of his teammates was injured, kicked the
ball out to stop play.
Unfortunately the ball struck a young girl who was taken to hospital
for treatment.
The incident was reported to the SFA, and their disciplinary committee
has handed out the censure and severe warning to the former Motherwell
player.
Partick Thistle coach George Caldwell has also been severely censured
and warned about his future conduct by the committee because of his
comment to a Dundee United player during the match at Firhill on April
18.
Golspie Sutherland co-manager William Bremner has been fined #200 and
banned from the trackside area for one year because of his remarks to
the referee on March 11 at the game against Ballintore.

THERE was an uncanny quality to the massive performance on Sunday
night of Benjamin Britten's War Requiem, a quality that was something to
do with the venue in which it was staged. Just as the brick edifice of
the Tramway, a former hive of industrial activity, seems to imbue music
performed there with an otherworldly quality, so too does the Shed.
Though I have doubts about the Shed's long-term potential as a venue,
it's impossible to set aside the eerie feeling that permeated the
performance of the Britten in this place. It was as though the Requiem
was being performed inside an architectural skeleton, a great, fleshless
corpse -- I have already described it as an industrial cathedral --
whose vast empty space gives rise to enormous resonance.
That resonance (though I have a qualification) appropriately enhanced
this performance, in which the huge Scottish Festival Chorus -- formed
for the occasion -- and the luminously-voiced choristers of St Mary's
Episcopal Cathedral in Edinburgh were joined by an augmented BBC
Scottish Symphony Orchestra, an additional chamber ensemble, and three
soloists, all under the batons of Martyn Brabbins and Nigel Boddice.
In what was in some ways an awesome performance (again, partly to do
with the venue and the vast expanse of space over which it was played)
the biggest and smallest sounds were served best: the immense climaxes
of the Dies Irae rose to fill the place, as did, at the other extreme
the soft, rich close of the Kyrie. Medium level sounds -- such as the
altos opening of the Recordare weren't so well supported. And though I
was ideally placed to hear the three soloists -- Lynda Russell, Thomas
Randle, and Michael Volle -- who sang lightly, I did wonder if they
could be heard at the periphery of the widespread audience.
If there was a certain objectivity to the experience, then that, too,
was connected to the venue. The Shed has a double internal roof which
gives rise to a weird acoustical phenomenon. The audience sits under a
lower canopy than that over the orchestra and choruses. You can hear the
mighty resonance surrounding the musical forces. It doesn't quite reach,
however, under the audience canopy. So it's at a distance; you can hear
it, but you're not part of it. Still, qualifications and all, a unique
experience, and one of the most distinctive of this year's Mayfest music
programme.

MAYBE it's the lingering memory of too many early Saturday evening TV
song and dance shows from my 70s youth, well before the Gladiators and
Blind Date generation, but there's something about the mid-Atlantic
''musical'' intonation, the earnest well-scrubbed enthusiasm of grown
men and women singing and dancing their hearts out, that just makes me
want to giggle, with more than a hint of embarrassment. I can't help it.
At Golden Age Theatre's Scottish premiere of Closer Than Ever, an
off-Broadway musical review featuring a collection of lyric and song
fragments from the team of David Shire and Richard Maltby jnr, I was not
alone. From the opening bars, the lassie sitting next to me melted into
convulsive, if apologetic, laughter, eventually reducing the entire row
to helpless shaking.
It would be unfair to suggest that this reaction was the overwhelming
response to the show. A healthy audience of 50-(60?)-somethings chuckled
their way appreciatively throughout, applauding each number vigorously.
Shire and Maltby write witty and gently self-mocking observations of
middle-class, middle-aged, middle-of-the-road North American city life.
Their targets -- ''liberated marriages'', ''sensible divorces'', the
exercise boom -- are the concerns of the affluent 40-(50?)-something,
their vignettes teetering a fine line between the touchingly
recognisable and the easy cliche.
Excellent musicianship, strong performances, particularly from Alicia
Devine, whose grasp of the understated irony of the lyrics gave bite to
her characterisation, and suitably ritzy choreography by Jane Simpson
added up to a slick and well-staged show. Whether the preoccupations of
yuppie New Yorkers are your particular plate of sushi is another matter
entirely.

AYE, yon boy Kay hud gave 110% for us, covering every inch of the
theatre-space, and he got a right good result at the end of Sunday
night's 90 minutes: the crowd wouldn't leave. We didn't want to believe
it was all over. With sport as his motivating theme, Phil had rattled
countless rippers into the comedy-pokey.
He had re-staged great moments in sporting history, as suggested by
audience-members. Tony Stanger's Triple Crown-winning try against
England in 1990; the kidnapping of Shergar; an evidently drug-induced
netball victory which Gryffe High School girls once achieved over Notre
Dame.
Phil had shepherded nine hapless volunteers through a game of
five-a-side football. He had staged Zen badminton. He had given us
half-time oranges. Most hilariously, Phil had provided us with the
fast-forward-video version of Sir Gary Sobers's perfect six-ball over.
Phil had given us encores. He'd eventually taken all his clothes off
in the wings and flung them on to the stage in a gesture of surrender.
Symbolically, he had then flung us his balls (table-tennis ones, you
understand).
Still we wouldn't leave. In fact, the metaphorical final whistle only
blew when two cheeky young women in the front row dashed forward and
stole Phil's clothes -- but then decided they were far too sweaty to
take home as souvenirs. Realising Phil had earned a rest, we departed,
grateful to have been a part of the stadium of dreams inside Phil's
head.

' Everything about Japanese football seems to be geared towards
getting the World Cup finals and a lot of money has been spent. They
have gone about it all in a very professional manner. '
SCOTLAND'S shadow squad leave for Japan on Wednesday morning to play
in the Kirin Cup against Japan and Ecuador, but no-one in the travelling
party should believe the adventure will be easy. Informed opinion
filtering through from the Far East says that the Scots, who are sending
what is no more than a C squad, will find the Japanese unyielding
opponents.
They have invited Scotland to play in Hiroshima on May 21 and Toyama
three days later because they are anxious to gather support for their
bid to become the first country in Asia to host the World Cup finals, in
2002, and their own professional league has already won over many
foreign influences.
Sanfrecce Hiroshima, for instance, signed Pieter Huistra from Rangers
earlier this season and the Dutchman warns Craig Brown to tread warily,
especially against the Japanese, whose standards are improving steadily.
''They are always so anxious to do things properly and they are the
same about their football,'' he said. ''The standard here is much higher
than I expected.
''They were always good technically and now they are also becoming
tactically aware, because of the influences on their game of foreign
players and coaches. There is an especially strong Brazilian influence
on the way they approach the game, but as yet their style is more
European than anything else.''
Huistra won't be in Hiroshima when Scotland play Japan, because he
will be back in Holland visiting family while the league programme is on
hold because of the Japan international side's involvement in the Kirin
Cup and also a tournament at Wembley. That they were willing to close
their domestic programme to accommodate these events, which involve only
friendly matches, is a measure of how seriously they are treating the
occasions.
''They have a few good players who will have to be watched,'' Huistra
added, ''and I would think Scotland, without their best players, will
have to work hard. Everything about Japanese football seems to be geared
towards getting the World Cup finals and a lot of money has been spent.
They have gone about it all in a very professional manner.''
As you might imagine, the Japanese were not slow to recognise the
earning potential of their football and expect to generate approximately
$100m through merchandise projects this year.
Huistra has settled well with Sanfrecce -- the name means three arrows
-- who are sponsored by Mazda, but it hasn't been a straightforward
transition for him or his wife, Mirjam, and son Erik. They live in a
suburb of Hiroshima, but the house is smaller than anything he may have
been used to and, of course, language is a problem.
''We have had to get used to a lot of things since moving here,'' he
says, ''but this is something we must do. In Scotland it wasn't
difficult because we speak English anyway, but English is not spoken
here as much as I had thought, and we must make the effort to learn some
Japanese.
''So far, though, it has been a good experience and I'm sure we'll
cope for a couple of years.
''Hiroshima sits in between mountains and there is not much space
around so the houses are built close together. But it isn't too bad and
people have been kind to us, although it is probably harder on my wife,
Mirjam, and our son Erik, because playing football here involves a lot
of travelling and I am away from home quite a lot.
''It's all right, but I wouldn't want to stay for the rest of my
life.''
Sanfrecce are fourth in the league and Huistra scored in the 3-0 win
over Kashima Antlers last week, a goal which helped enhance his growing
popularity among the fans. ''I think my style of play is pretty well
liked but we still have a lot of work to do yet,'' he said.
The league is divided into two parts, with the first series of matches
called the Suntory League and the second being the more universally
known J League. The ball has been rolling since March 18, and 15 games
have been played so far in the Suntory League.
Huistra said: ''The structure means there can be two winners of the
leagues, who would then play home and away at the end of the season to
find the overall champions.
''There are 14 teams in the leagues and we play each other four times,
as in Scotland, but in Japan that means 52 matches, and there is also a
cup competition.
''I think there are far too many matches, but I chose to come here and
I have to accept it.''
Naturally, there is not much time devoted to training because of the
number of games and the distances which have to be covered, but that
doesn't bother Huistra too much, because being blond and fair-skinned,
he is hardly a sun worshipper.
''It is too hot already and when I'm training I have to wear sun
block, but the real problems will come in June and July, when the
humidity will rise,'' he said.
So far as the Scots will be concerned, they, too, will feel the heat
in Japan, but perhaps rather because of the standard of play with which
they are about to be confronted. The Japanese will draw most of their
players from the top sides -- the Yokohama Marinos, Kashima Antlers,
Bellmare Hiratsuki, Sanfrecce, and Jubilo Awata, and Gamba Osaki.
But until the Scots see their opponents in the flesh they must remain
largely unknown, although they should beware Sanfrecce's Noh Jung Youn
and Tetsu Hashiratani, as well as Kazu Miura, of Verdy Kawasaki, and
Yokohama Marinos' Masami Ihara.

* Some 1100 years before the Egyptians started building the Great
Pyramid, farmers were living at the Knap of Howar on Papa Westray. Today
the remains of their home is 5,000 years old.
* Celtic monks arrived in 500AD followed, 290 years later, by the
first major Viking raids on the islands.
* Lying on approximately the same latitude as Leningrad and the
southern tip of Greenland, Orkney is closer to Oslo than London.
* The archipeligo stretches 53 miles from south to north, 23 miles
from east to west and covers 240,000 acres. The main island, the
Mainland, contains more than half the land area and more than three
quarters of the population.
* The population has grown from 18,425 in 1981 to 19,612 in 1991. More
than 7,000 people live in Kirkwall.
* During December, January and February the average daily maximum
temperature in Kirkwall is similar to that in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and
less than 1 degree C lower than London. Summers are cool with an average
maximum day temperature of 15 degrees C in July and August.
Orkney receives more rain than Edinburgh or London, but less than
Glasgow or Torquay.
* In 1813 the Great Auk became extinct - with the last bird killed on
Papa Westray.
* On October 13, 1939, a German U-boat crept into Scapa Flow and sunk
HMS Royal Oak with the loss of 833 lives. Churchill immediately ordered
the construction of the defensive barriers which today provide a road
link to the islands of South Ronaldsay and Burray.
* On January 15, 1952, a ferocious gale destroyed 7,000 chicken houses
and 86,000 hens.
* Orkney has a 500-mile coastline - half that of mainland Scotland. At
351 metres, St John's Head on Hoy is the highest vertical sea cliff in
Britain.
* Highest point - Ward Hill on Hoy at 1,565 feet above sea level.
* Main industries farming and tourism - each boosting the Orkney
economy by more than 20 million each year.
* The islands have a breeding herd of more than 33,000 beef and dairy
cows and are also home to almost 55,000 ewes.

A #500,000 PROJECT at the Scottish Crop Research Institute is aimed at
producing an improved, more environmentally-friendly potato crisp.
Consumers and supermarkets now seek foods which have been subjected to
lower levels of chemical treatment. In the potato world that means more
storage at low temperatures, to control disease and premature sprouting.
However, low-temperature storage helps convert the starch in the potato
to reducing sugars. That, in turn, means more intensive ''browning''
during the crisp manufacture process.
The major crisp companies have combined with the European Commission
to develop a modification of current crisping varieties which will
maintain a low level of reducing sugars, even when stored at cold
temperatures.
Mylnefield Research Services, the commercial arm of the SCRI, will be
conducting trials over the next three years to seek a solution to that
problem.

AYR auctioneering firm James Craig Limited has extended its offer for
Wallets Marts after failing to acquire even half-a-percent of the share
capital.
Craigs #8.50-a-share offer, valuing the Castle Douglas company at just
over #1m, was recommended for refusal by the Wallets board of directors
who said the company was worth at least twice that in terms of capital.
When the first deadline set by Craigs for the takeover offer expired
last Friday, Michael Craig said 358 Wallets Marts shares had been
received, representing 0.3% of the issued Ordinary share capital of the
firm.
The offer from Craigs three weeks ago valued Wallets, famous
throughout the world for its shows and sales of Galloway cattle, at just
over #1m.
Now James Craig said that the offer will now remain open for
acceptance until 3pm on June 2 or such later time as Craigs may decide.
In a letter to Wallets shareholders, chairman Michael J Craig said it
had received details of a letter sent on behalf of Wallets Marts, in
which it advised shareholders to reject the offer by Craigs.
''We shall respond to this shortly,'' said Mr Craig, whose letter
advises Wallets shareholders to accept the James Craig offer now.
Meanwhile, in another development of the takeover saga, Thomson
Roddick &amp; Laurie Limited, the Annan-based auctioneering firm with
markets at Dumfries and Thornhill, said it will not be making an offer
to Wallets shareholders to acquire their Ordinary shares.
In a letter to his shareholders, Tom Gillespie, chairman of the
Wallets board, said there has been no material change in any of the
information published by Wallets earlier this month which outlined the

<HEADLINE>MLC sees outdoor pig production slowing</HEADLINE>

THE boom years of growth for outdoor pig production may be over,
according to the latest data from the Meat and Livestock Commission.
The system, perceived by some as more welfare friendly than intensive
indoor systems, has suffered from bad winters as well as economic
setbacks.
But while the rate of growth has declined over the past year, MLC
officials believe it will continue to expand slowly where soil type and
weather conditions allow. About one in five pigs is produced in outdoor
systems.
The Commission's latest Pig Yearbook comments: ''The major attraction
(of the system) is that capital investment in buildings, equipment and
stock for outdoor production represents around 36% of that needed for
indoor production.
''Levels of productivity for outdoor herds compare favourably with
indoor herds, but it should be noted that feed cost is around #2 more
per pig reared due to higher feed use and more expensive feed costs per
tonne.''
Even with a significant exodus from the pig industry expected in the
next few years as a result of massive investment bills in new indoor
plant to meet UK welfare legislation, indoor production is not expected
to take up the slack.
As Colin Baldwin, MLC's pigmeat strategy manager, explained:
''Although the initial investment is lower, there are additional running
costs in outdoor herds which are only partly offset by, say, lower
labour costs.
''Yields are on average threequarters-of-a-pig less per sow per year
although the genetic potential of the outdoor sow is at least equivalent
to the indoor animal. We are intent on finding out why this should be.
For example, it may be that a hybrid indoor/outdoor system might offer
the best solution.''
Another issue highlighted in the yearbook is the high rate of culling
of all sows in the national herd; up to 45% of all sows in any given
year.
''There is no doubt that this is a real waste for the industry as a
whole,'' said Mr Baldwin. ''We have just started a three-year trial at
our Stotfold unit to find ways of reducing this. For example, it may
well be that much of this productivity and longevity problem may be a
result of early management of the gilt.''
Failure to conceive and old age were the main reasons given by farmers
for disposing of sows although dissatisfaction with numbers of baby pigs
born also featured.
* MEANWHILE the Cotswold Pig Development Company reported that major
trials have shown that pig producers could gain as much as #5 per animal
by more accurate matching of the nutritional needs of their finishing
pigs to their genetic potential for lean growth.
''Today's genetically-advanced pigs are capable of laying down more
lean meat at a faster rate than ever before,'' said Ms Felicity Jones,
Cotswold's in-house nutritionist.
Information on the way pigs should be fed, resulting from the trials,
would be of key importance in helping farmers to decide the most
profitable feeding strategy.

BASKETBALL:
SCOTLAND have had the worst possible draw for the men's European
Championship qualifying tournament beginning in Lugano, Switzerland,
next Monday.
With seven countries taking part, each will have one rest day, and
Scotland have been unlucky enough to have to sit out on the first day.
It means that the Scottish team of part-timers face six matches in six
days.
Coach Allan Turner was trying to put a brave face on things yesterday,
though, following the FIBA decision to debar Paul Bjarnason on the
grounds of eligibility, it was yet another blow to his plans to achieve
respectability in the tournament by winning up to three games.
''It's very disappointing but you learn to expect these things
internationally and we'll just have to do the best we can,'' said
Turner.
''I hope we'll have a reasonable chance against Austria in our first
game but I expect Romania and Switzerland to be strong, and we know all
about the Portuguese already.''
Scotland open against Austria next Tuesday then play hosts
Switzerland, Romania, and Portugal, finishing against Cyprus and
Iceland.
''We lost to Cyprus in Vienna two years ago because we were too
complacent, so hopefully we can reverse that this time,'' said Turner.
''We'll have to watch Iceland's three-point shooters in our last game.''
Thankfully, all his casualties from the training trip to Portugal the
previous weekend -- Allan Ryan (eight stitches in his mouth), and Dave
Norval and Craig Brownlie (both ankle injuries) -- were able to train in
Glasgow on Sunday, as was Alan Lamb, who had been hospitalised because
of a throat infection.
''We should be at full strength to leave on Sunday,'' said the
Cumnock-based coach, who was pleased with the showing of new cap Stuart
Tait in Portugal, particularly the 22-year-old Canadian student's
first-half shooting. The full squad is:
Phil Birch, Craig Brownlie, Tony McDaid (all Glasgow Brightsiders),
Alan Lamb, Iain Maclean, David Norval, Allan Ryan, Gordon Smith (all
Livingston Bulls), Stuart Glass, Jim Mitchell (both Paisley), Grant
Forrest (Edinburgh Burger Kings), Stuart Tait (Laurentian University,
Ontario). Coach: Allan Turner (Team Corsa). Assistant: Alan McDonald
(Paisley). Manager: Tom Campbell (Troon).

CYCLING:
GRAEME Obree heads for the sunshine of Athens today in the next phase
of his build-up to the world championships later in the year.
The Scot faces a tough task against the riders of 26 nations, with
only four qualifying for the final of this World Cup event.
But the 27-year-old former world champion is in good spirit for the
next big test in his comeback after having been sacked by French team Le
Groupement for failing to turn up at their training HQ on New Year's
Day.
''I have been training hard at the Manchester Superdrome and have
improved my time in the pursuit by 10 seconds, which is very
encouraging. If I can improve by another five seconds, I will qualify
for the world championships in Colombia in October.''
His training has been supervised by British team manager Doug Dailey.
Obree has had to change his riding style completely following a ban by
the world cycling body, and is now riding higher in the saddle.
''My new position using triathlon bars is improving all the time. I
clocked 4min 40sec for the 4000-metre pursuit at Easter, but in training
at Manchester I have got that down to 4-30.
''So, with another world cup event in Germany next month and the
British Championships coming up in July, I feel that I am on the right
road at last.''
One worry for him is a troublesome cough, caused by the dust from the
tracks. ''I had it in Hammar, Norway, in 1993 when I broke the world
one-hour record for the first time and it bothered me again in training
at Manchester. Thankfully, the Athens track is outdoors, although the
pollution is bad out there.''
He has been given an inhaler to ease the problem.
Also flying out to Athens is Edinburgh sprinter Anthony Stoddart, who
has moved to Manchester to be near the superb facilities there. And it
has paid off for him with a big improvement in his form.

A job on the piste may seem tempting, but Sue Tranter learns that
career path can be a slippery slope
IT MAY seem like poor timing, but in the next few weeks, dozens of
hopeful skiers will attempt to turn their regular hobby into a job. As
the season draws to a close, courses to acquire all-important training
qualifications are beginning at dry ski centres.
According to Douglas Bryce, of the Scottish National Ski Council, it's
the time when many instructors come back to Scotland from working abroad
during the season, and other skiers are looking to improve existing
qualifications while they aren't making the most of snow abroad.
On a fortnight's alpine holiday, the appeal of a job in ski-ing might
seem glamorously tempting for anyone with talent. But the reality
depends on determination and cash as much as a flash technique.
Communication skills are a priority, according to Douglas Bryce. But
according to instructors, cash is another crucial element, and grants
are few and far between. Availability may depend on where you live, in
some regions ski-ing is considered a reasonable career prospect
warranting a grant, in lowland areas such as the Borders, the chance is
limited.
The British Association of Ski Instructors, based at Aviemore, is
running its spring courses in both Scotland and Andorra. A basic
foundation course of five days is the first step and this costs #32 a
day not including lift passes. The next move is the 10-day course, which
this year is being held in Andorra and France. With accommodation and
lift passes the cost is reckoned to be around #800 to #900, roughly
similar to a ski holiday.
However, this is just the beginning for top instructors, who will pay
around that amount for each grade. There are three grades to pass before
work abroad is guaranteed, while France insists on its own qualification
involving a timed run against one of its national team members.
While all this may be enough to deter some, according to instructors
like David Whigham, the lifestyle is unique.
Currently working at the Glasgow Ski School, David has just returned
from three months in Italy. He is 29, and has been an instructor for
some years. He did his original training in Austria and managed to work
in a ski shop in France as a technician.
''When I got my qualification to teach in Scotland I came back. A
qualification with the International Ski Instructors Association allows
you to teach in any English-speaking country. Teaching in France is much
harder because of the extra qualification, but the financial rewards are
greater if you get it.''
David reckons each of his qualifications has cost him around #2000 and
he found all the money himself. However, the more qualifications you
have the more employable you become. ''Instructors rarely make a lot of
money, but they do have a lot of fun,'' he says.
Not surprisingly, instructors often have other jobs or qualifications
to fall back on. David has a degree in engineering, others run their own
schools or work in the leisure industry.
Colin Beck is in his thirties, and though he is still an instructor in
Scotland, he is the manager of Blues ski shop in Glasgow.
''The money you make is disproportionately small to the amount it
takes to get all the grades and qualifications. But teaching actually
teaches you a lot about yourself and personality, and the way you
communicate to others is very important.
''You have to be prepared to be always on the move but it will be
through some of the most beautiful scenery in the world. It's also a
very sociable way to spend your time. It's a hobby that can be a living,
and for a lot of people who don't want the top of the range car or a big
house, that's enough.''

GEORGE Stubbs, of the Dun Whinny club at Gleneagles, came close to
following in the footsteps of Australian Peter O'Malley in the Spring
Meeting over the King's course.
The 30-year-old insurance consultant had a 10-foot putt for an eagle
at the par-4 fourteenth, which just failed to drop, then birdied the
next three, followed by another birdie putt from 15 feet at the last.
Unlike O'Malley -- weekend winner of the Benson and Hedges Open -- who
covered these five holes in seven under par to win the 1992 Scottish
Open, Stubbs charged this putt and missed the return.
''I was aware the finish had similarities to that of O'Malley, but it
wasn't to be, though it was my best round over the course,'' said the
club champion for the last two years and a Perth and Kinross county
player.
Still, he had the excuse, if he wanted to make it, of bumpy,
early-season greens on which he had also three-putted the ninth and
tenth in otherwise perfect, calm conditions.
However, previous birdies at the second and fifth helped him to a
gross 67 which puts him top of Parbusters this week on minus 6. It also
gave him a scratch handicap for the first time since he was 17.
Curiously, his three-under-par round beat the seven-under-par course
record 65 of Brian Lees at Easter Moffat, which exposes Parbusters as a
misnomer. Being pedantic, it should be competition scratch
score-busters.
The King's course was re-rated this year at 73, a rise of two and
three more than the par figure, while Easter Moffat is rated at 70, two
below par. This may appear unfair, but it is the device which allows as
far as possible comparisons between courses of differing difficulty.
Lees began his round with three three-putts in the first four holes,
but in among them was a holed wedge shot for an eagle 2. A birdie at the
seventh and a chip-in for another eagle at the ninth helped him to the
turn in 34, two under. Further gains at the eleventh and thirteenth set
himself up for a spectacular birdie-birdie-birdie finish.
The 37-year-old, who runs his own construction firm and has been
playing golf for only six years, has had his handicap cut from five to
four as a result.
''I was driving superbly and hitting irons in close which is just as
well. The greens were bumpy, and if it had been a putting conest I
wouldn't have been anywhere,'' he said.
A 65, incidentally, has been a special score ever since Henry Cotton
score that number in the second round of the 1934 Open Championship at
Royal St George's which survived as an Open record for 43 years and has
been immortalised since in the form of the Dunlop 65 ball.
Also on minus 5 this week is Biggar's Brian Kerr, who equalled his own
course record of 61.
Meanwhile, the bandit-of-the week mantle falls on the shoulders of
Strathaven's Neil Jackson, who beat his 12 handicap by 11 shots in his
club's May Medal.
There is a tie in women's handicap on minus 10, while Marian Wilson's
68 at Girvan tops women's scratch on plus 1. This week's leading scores:

BOTHO Strauss is one of Germany's, if not Europe's most enigmatic and
most-performed modern playwrights. His past incursions into the English
repertoire however have mostly been met by a mixture of outrage and
bewilderment. We don't, with our passion for naturalism and realism,
appear to much care for his abstract style or savage satire.
Now in self-imposed exile in Berlin (and having apparently moved from
left to right wing in his views), this British premiere of Time and the
Room comes over as an uneven, oddly old-fashioned but interesting
critique on the new Germany with an especially haunting final, symbolic
image implying a continuing inability to face up to the sickness in
their midst.
Like French absurdist drama of the 50s and 60s however, you have to
some extent to take from it what you will. Initially it's fairly
unfathomable. Strauss assembles an oddly assorted, seemingly
unconnected, collection of middle-class characters in a starkly
impersonal room. It's only in the second half that a young woman, Marie,
is revealed as a central figure, apparently playing out each man's (well
almost -- two of the men are a gay couple) embodiment of the male sexual
fantasy of the female. Wickedly observed, Marie at the end however is
seen as a humble secretary. Were all those episodes products of her,
rather than their, fantasies after all, one wonders?
Director Lisa Forrell and a fine cast do well to wrench humour and
pathos from this dense philosophical as well as social puzzle while
Susannah Corbett is stunning as the infinitely vulnerable, adaptable
Marie. A strange but not unrewarding hybrid of tempers and atmospheres.

and fuels purchased by manufacturing industry show no sign of abating.
These input prices have sported double-figure annual inflation rates
every month this year.
Hopes of a slowdown last month were frustrated yesterday when the
producer price figures were released. However, the factory gate price
figures were mildly encouraging, though it is unlikely that this will
persist.
Seasonally-adjusted input prices rose by 0.7% in April, and the March
increase was revised up from 0.4% to 0.8%. The annual rate of increase
was 11.5%, the same as the revised figure for March. But this had
originally been stated at 11%.
Input prices have been rising strongly over the last year as the
strength of the global economic recovery has lifted commodity prices out
of the doldrums. More recently the weakness of sterling has added to
costs.
In April last year input price inflation was still in negative
territory at minus 1.3%, but prices have accelerated strongly since then
with increases spread over most categories of materials.
Last month there were rises in the prices of crude oil, chemicals and
plastics, and pulp and paper, partly offset by a seasonal fall in
electricity prices.
Fuel and materials only account for about 8% of manufacturers' costs.
Of much more significance is the recent pick-up in manufacturing unit
labour costs, which rose by 2.5% in the year to February, the latest
month for which figures are available.
James Capel's Adam Cole argues that even though unit labour costs are
''considerably below the rate of increase of input prices, the two
series, together with a recent acceleration in import price inflation,
now suggest that manufacturers' costs are rising more quickly than
output prices''.
In other words, manufacturers' margins are being squeezed. Cole takes
the view that with capacity utilisation, as measured by the CBI survey,
''well above its historic average there is no reason to believe that
manufacturers will absorb cost increases in profit margins. Factory gate
price inflation is likely to accelerate further over the coming
months.''
The factory gate price figures for April were slightly below
expectations, though the headline rate was at its highest level since
December 1993 and the seasonally-adjusted series at its highest level
since September 1991.
The output price index for all manufacturers rose by 0.4% in April,
taking the annual rate of increase up from 3.8% in March to 4%. The
series, which excludes the food, drink, tobacco and petroleum
industries, rose by a seasonally-adjusted 0.3% on the month. As a result
the annual rate of increase in this measure of factory gate price
inflation rose from 3.8% to 4.1%.
More encouraging was the trend in the three-month-on-three-month
seasonally-adjusted index, which fell back from 5.1% in March to 4.7%
last month. This was seized upon by the Treasury as an indication that
the core measure of output price inflation was slowing down.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, used earlier
indications that the pace of factory gate price inflation was easing off
as part of his justification for his controversial decision not to raise
interest rates. But much of the force of this point is lost in the fact
that the short-run rate of core inflation is 0.6% higher than the
12-month rate.
Adam Cole claims that with capacity constraints ''already biting in
manufacturing and the sector receiving a further boost from the fall in
sterling in recent months, prices pressures at the factory gate are
clearly increasing''.
The strongest inflation pressures are in basic metals (8.5%
year-on-year), rubber and plastics (8.4%), and pulp and paper (6.9%).
The laggards are food manufacturing (2.2%) and electrical machinery
(2.3%).
Overall inflationary pressures in the manufacturing sector remain
strong even before account is taken of the latest decline in sterling.
The extent to which these price increases will be passed on to consumers
is uncertain, but the recent acceleration in inflation in the household
goods sector suggest the risks are increasing.

' The Tour argues that it must provide the greatest good for the
greatest number. '
PERHAPS adapt that old jingoistic anthem for their own motto -- ''Tour
of Hope and Glory'' that is. After all, one of the succeeding lines
goes: ''Wider still and wider shall thy bounds be set'' and, as
announced last week, the bounds will from early next year extend even
unto Australia.
To this development Severiano Ballesteros has taken exception. He
continues to believe that in the first three months of the season too
many events are played on inferior courses for inadequate prize-money.
Until a few years ago the European Tour did not start until after the US
Masters; this year 10 tournaments had been played by April.
The Tour, running as it were a nakedly capitalistic sport on
unashamedly socialist principles, argues that it must provide the
greatest good for the greatest number -- in other words as many
competitive opportunities as possible for as many players as can be
accommodated by the hours of daylight.
Ballesteros is opposed to propping up tournaments piecemeal and wants
a system of promotion and relegation between the leading players from
the subsidiary Challenge Tour and the tail-enders from the PGA European
Tour, thereby, he maintains, raising standards.
Apart from their basic responsibilities as it sees them, the Tour,
although it remains curiously silent on its own behalf, can claim that
by sustaining the European Open last autumn it made possible that
tournament's survival until a new sponsor emerged to take it up this
season.
Of course, the fact that official tournaments are already being played
in Dubai, Asia, and South Africa might look like an admission of failure
to attract sponsors closer to home. Ireland now has two events and
Scotland -- apart from hosting two Open Championships in three -- has
one regular Tour event.
But nothing now is played in England north of the Midlands, thereby
excluding the enthusiastic and populous golfing counties of Yorkshire
and Lancashire. Apparently sponsors prefer the south and, anyway, by the
time northern courses are at their best, the calendar has been filled.
In difficult economic conditions perhaps this could be the time to
introduce a lay business element to the Tour's board of directors,
currently comprised solely of past and present professionals. The US
Tour's Policy Board consists of three such representatives, whose
commercial acumen and advice is presumably both welcome and valuable.
The difficulty is that arguments for both points of view are
plausible. For instance, without a steady diet of tournaments players
cannot develop their careers and one suspects that, if Ballesteros were
young again, he would take eagerly full advantage of as many playing
opportunities as possible.
Although the Tour is unlikely to adopt any ''up and down'' system,
change is planned for the 1997 season. It has in mind to admit more
players from the Challenge Tour (at the moment only 10) than from the
qualifying school, believing that a more prolonged opportunity is needed
to enable young players to survive the culture shock of instant
promotion.
At the same time, there is everything to be said for smaller fields.
In that regard, the Open is hardly setting the best of examples, since
at St Andrews in July as many as 159 will start, about 90% of whom have
neither the ability nor the ambition to accomplish more than earn a
decent cheque.
However the Tour develops -- and one understands that a major
sponsorship announcement is imminent -- instability is created when the
preferences of the leading players and the rank and file tug in opposite
directions. Reconciling these interests will have to be the priority of
the Tour's executive director, Ken Schofield, and his management team.

* This week's tip comes from JOHN SANDILANDS, the professional at
Haddington Golf Club.
THE golden rule when faced with a chip shot is to get the ball on to
the green and rolling towards the hole as soon as possible.
If there is nothing blocking the route to the flag, keep the ball
close to the ground. The air route is much more risky.
Try the chip and run, I'm sure you will find that it will help roll
three shots into two from the edge of the green.
Firstly, choose a club with just enough loft to lift the ball over the
fringe, bounce on to the green and then roll most of the way to the
hole. A No.7 or No.8-iron would be an ideal choice.
The following three steps are the ones to practise.
* Play the ball slightly back in the stance.
* Keep the hands and weight forward.
* Make a stroke similar to one you would use with the putter.
This shot is a real strokesaver -- and, remember, practice makes
perfect.

YOUR beautifully flighted No.9-iron approach shot lands on the front

YES. You are penalised two strokes under Rule 13-2 for improving your
line of play. However, if the pitch mark had been on the green, you
would have been entitled to repair it under Rule 16-1c even though you
were playing from off the green.
The exception to this Rule is if the pitch mark had been made by
someone else's ball AFTER your ball had come to rest. Decision 13-2/8
declares that, in equity, a player is entitled to the lie his stroke
gave him.

THIS honeyed foghorn is addressing us from deep inside a candy-floss
flummery of Cartland pink feathers. Beyond the boa lies the glittering
proof that sequins are now an endangered species: scarcely a smidgeon of
Danny La Rue's 6ft 2in frame isn't winking outrageously at us. The
knowing twinkles come later, when he gets into his full patter. But to
begin with, he's offering us special reminiscences of the theatre itself
-- personal memories from his early career when, 40 years ago, he
appeared on stage, a mere slip of a chorus boy in some bygone musical.
The mood of the evening is, chiefly, nostalgia. The show is billed as
the Good Olde Days, the format and material presented as borrowed from
the heydays of the Music Hall. Since none of us -- or at least no-one I
can see around me -- is old enough to remember the likes of Marie Lloyd
or Florrie Ford, what we're really going by is the telly vision
recreated by Leeds City Varieties in the sixties. With that in mind, we
know our function and our cues. When chairman Johnny Dennis starts to
speil -- ''and brought to you at . . .'' we're ready with
''EE-EE-normous expense.'' But some things you can't put a price on. And
Danny La Rue has to come into that category.
Encased in various extravagant fandangos of feathers and spangles, La
Rue embodies the enduringly acceptable face of drag, admired for its
glamour, its sauce, its hint of naughtiness long before camp became a
sexual-political issue. La Rue is, whether in drag or in his final
evening suit, the total trouper. The voice may gravel, but the heart is
marshmallow soft. The sing-a-longs we share -- music hall melodies, VE
Day choruses -- are full of cheerful sentimentality. He's backed on this
occasion by a valiant lineup who can't quite match his star quality,
though The Holloways, with their musical speciality act, were a real
bonus. It doesn't matter how good the old days ever were, what counts is
the evergreen appeal of institutions like La Rue who must surely rival
the Queen Mum in the nation's affections and in his penchant for
feathers.

DAVID HARE's latest play -- a kind of Englishman's version of David
Mamet's spikily controversial Oleanna -- is undeniably one of his best
for some time. Certainly his most immediate and personal, Richard Eyre's
production too in John Gunter's shabby north London flat exudes everyday
realism even to the point of a grumpy gas geyser and a spaghetti
bolognese being produced before our eyes.
And in Lia Williams (taking a similarly combative role to the one she
played in Oleanna) and Michael Gambon, there are two performances of
breath-taking intensity and attunement.
Like Oleanna, Hare's male and female opponents are on a crash course.
Only here they are former lovers, Williams's 20 years younger
socially-conscious teacher Kyra and Gambon's restless entrepreneurial
genius (a cross between Terence Conran and Orson Welles) rattling over
old sores that is both desperately painful to watch yet utterly
absorbing.
There is so much going on here -- a fight for moral superiority,
intimations of death, guilt, betrayal, adulterous love, the trespassing
of boundaries between young and old, opposing lifestyles -- spun with
that typical Hare combination of vituperation and sorrow.
Yet for all its roller-coaster brilliance there is also something
slightly suspect. It's not that Hare has been unfair to either party --
Tom's materialistic self-interest is articulated by Gambon with all the
entertaining brio of one used to getting his way while Kyra's
determination to carve out her own life away from Tom's seductive power
and possessiveness is equally convincing. But Hare is too, I think, also
aiming his sights at something more -- showing the wreckage such
self-absorbed passion leaves in its wake, especially on the younger
generation. And here, he is far less convincing. In this form, though,
he is still pretty irresistible.

DIY giant Sainsbury's Homebase yesterday announced the closure of some
of the Texas stores it bought earlier this year with the loss of up to
866 jobs, but said all of the stores it acquired in Scotland would
remain open.
The company is to close 26 Texas stores and two Homebase centres in
England and Wales but plans to open Homebase stores in 80 towns
throughout the country, creating 3000 jobs under an expansion programme.
Some of the new stores might be in Scotland.
Sainsbury's initially warned it would have to close 55 of the 240
Texas stores it bought for #290m from the Ladbroke Group in January.
But, following a ''careful and considered'' review, the company said it
would close fewer than half that number, with the chance that workers
will be offered jobs elsewhere.
The total number of staff in the 28 stores to be closed from July is
866, including 261 full-time workers. They will be offered redundancy
or, where possible, be redeployed to other stores.
Dino Adriano, chairman of Sainsbury's Homebase, said: ''We regret that
any stores have to close at all and we are committed to doing our best
for the staff concerned.
''At the same time, we have identified over 80 towns where we are
actively looking to open a new Homebase store.''
Following the closures, which will take several months to complete,
the combined Homebase and Texas business will have 297 stores employing
16,500 staff.
A spokesman added that none of the 24 Texas stores in Scotland, which
are mainly in the central belt and employ less than 1000 people, were
among those to be closed.
''One of the reasons for closure is because of an overlap between a
Texas store and a Homebase store but there are no Homebase stores in
Scotland at the moment so there is no overlap. The Scottish Texas stores
are staying because they are functioning well and are profitable.''
The spokesman said some of the planned new stores might be in Scotland
but was unable to estimate the likely number, where they might be, and
how many jobs might be involved.

IF Jenny McLeod was white and male, her Victor and the Ladies would
probably be described as Whitehall farce and dismissed with a
patronising pat on its head. As it is, Jenny is black and female and
Victor will probably be criticised anyway on the grounds of being crude
on the one hand or showing up her community in a bad light on the other.
In fact, McLeod has written one of the funniest sexual comedies I've
seen in a long time and under Paulette Randall's exuberant direction
gets a wonderfully extrovert production to match it. Like a Ray Cooney
or Feydeau farce, McLeod spins a whole and very enjoyable evening's fun
out of a very simple truth -- the absurdly inflated postion of the male
within the black community.
McLeod's aptly named Victor Preedy is a preening, swaggering stud with
a harem of women -- ''one big happy family'' -- to feed his every whim.
McLeod's format is perhaps no more than extended sit-com but the beauty
of her story that involves Victor trying to take up with an old flame
after the death of his recent wife, a touch of voodoo, and a birth on
the kitchen table, lies in its joyous self-satirising.
The comedy is broad, fast, and furious but also highly detailed and
beautifully observed as McLeod shows the women's complicity and
competitiveness turning to revenge as Victor attempts to add his latest
romantic entanglement, Lilah, to his swelling ranks.
Rudolph Walker as Victor gives one of his most appealingly libidinous
performances while Claire Benedict, Dona Croll, Susan Lycett and Jo
Martin match him for comic timing and purpose. Delicious.

When I came to Orkney nearly five years ago, some well-meaning but
geographically-challenged friends from the Central Belt of Scotland
seemed unsure as to the exact whereabouts of the Orkney islands.
''Isn't it that place that's in a wee box off the map of Scotland?''
mumbled one, sheepishly. Quite so. On some alleged maps of Scotland,
Orkney and Shetland find themselves put firmly in their place. In a box.
Off the map.
Not only are Orkney and Shetland often confused in southern minds, but
so are Orkney and the Western Isles. Havoc reported in Stornoway will
produce telephone calls of concern to Kirkwall. A bout of reported food
poisoning in Tobermory will mean a reduction in tourist bookings to
Stromness.
''Isn't Orkney terribly far away?'' ask friends, solicitously. Far
away from what, though? That's a bit like asking a man from Beijing if
he doesn't feel out of things. It all depends on your starting point.
When I left Central Scotland for Orkney, it was as if I was going to
the furthermost point of the earth. Sometimes, on a wet and windy
winter's day out at the cliffs of Yesnaby, it felt like it. Central Belt
was where it was really happening, it was inferred: to leave it was to
indulge in escapism from the real world of SCottish cultural, religious
and political life. It was go go into a box. Off the map.
From the Northern perspective, I began to look at Edinburgh in the way
Edinburgh people look at London (and in the way people in North
Ronaldsay look at Kirkwall). The reorientation of the universe meant
that Wick became ''Sooth.''
I began to see that provincialism has more to do with the geography of
the heart than with the geography of any country. (Is there a more
provincial citythan London? Is there a more provincial press than the
London-based media?
And listening to BBC Radio Scotland news, with its incessant Central
Belt babble, I realised that it was possible for people to live in a box
without any lines actually being drawn.
''What do you do in Orkney when you need a new coat?'' was the
question asked recently of a woman living just down the road from me.
''I go out and buy one,'' she answered. No: no shooting of bears for
skins. And yes: there's running water and electricity.
''Should I bring my car? Do you have roads up there?'' asked one
applicant of Orkney's Director of Education. Geography certainly does
define Orkney's place. When I first came here, I asked one local where
he was going on holiday. ''Scotland,'' he replied.
Until then, I had thought I was in Scotland. But Orkney is Orkney is
Orkney. (When the late Jo Grimond was asked, for the purpose of
Westminster expense claims, to name his nearest railway station, he put
down Bergen). The proximity of Norway also menas that history defines
Orkney's place.
The number of Viking place names tells its own story -- of battles and
earldoms and longships and sagas. To stroll through Kirkwall, past the
viking St Magnus Cathedral and Earl's Place, is to find oneself in
streets such as King Haakon and Earl Sigurd and Hordaland. Glasgow seems
a world away from where it's happening. Oslo doesn't.
And Orkney is defined by the wind. It used to be said of the town of
Moose Jaw in Saskatchewan that one day the wind stopped, and everybody
fell down. Orkney is a bit like that.
When Billy Connolly came here tomake a television programme last year,
he did a marvellously funny sketch in which a Kirkwall matron went
shopping with her children tied to the pram in case they blew away.
Orkney truly is a fresh and refreshing place. Mind you, there can be
days when you feel seriously over-refreshed, finding yourself hanging on
to buildings which are themselves hanging on to you. Fiercely
independent Orkney has managed to keep its distinctive identity and
culture, despite hosting many incomers (otherwise known as
''ferryloupers.'') Some adventurers come to live here, supported only by
a sense of romance and a goat, seeking the simple life. But it's not as
simple as that.
Orkney may be beautiful, breathtakingly so, but it is no garden of
Eden. On a glorious, long June evening, it may look as if it would be
easy to live here; working a croft in the dark winter requires more than
romance.
One thing that does draw big crowds in the winter is the celebrated
Ba' game, when Uppies and Doonies take part in a free-for-all scrimmage
up and down the streets of Kirkwall. The game started centuries ago,
apparently, with cheery Vikings playing street rugger with the heads of
their victims. It's not as bad as that today, though you're still liable
to get a broken leg and three crushed ribs. And that's only the
spectators.
''But what do you find to do up there?'' I am still asked. The answer
is that I've hardly drawn breath. There's a lot going on all year round.
On an island, or series of islands, people have to be self-reliant.
Kirkwall itself is no quiet backwater: it is a bustling Cathedral town
which attracts visitors from all over the world. Orcadian writer Gorge
Mackay Brown and composer Peter Maxwell Davies bring international
artists to the annual St Magnus Festival. Scottish and Scandinavian
musicians head for the Orkney Folk Festival.
On the islands, there is tranquility and beauty, and wonderful
beachesd. (They are rarely busy. The water is clear, but cold; you'll
find that the Orkney seas reach the parts that other seas don't reach).
And ''twichers'' find wonderful rare birds on the north isles.
So what's it like living in a box?
Sometimes I feel sorry for those who live in the box which goes by the
name of London. The poor souls must feel out of things, living so
terribly far away.

SMITH &amp; Nephew, the healthcare group, has been back on the acquisition
trail. This time it has agreed to pay #90m cash for surgical
instrument-maker Acufex, a subsidiary of American Home Products.
The deal, which is conditional upon regulatory approvals, will be
funded from existing bank facilities. In February, Smith paid #29m for
Homecraft, a manufacturer of aids for the disabled.
Acufex, based in Massachusetts, is a specialist maker of devices for
use in minimally-invasive or what is more commonly known as ''keyhole''
surgery.
This surgical technique is growing in popularity not least because it
minimises the length of time patients have to stay in hospital to
recuperate after the operation.
Chairman Eric Kinder said that following the purchase, Smith was
placed ''in an extremely strong position to benefit from future
developments and growth in the market''.
Acufex had sales of #35m last year and net assets of #19m. It made an
operating profit of #4.5m. Sales growth in the last three years has
averaged 13%.
The acquisition fits nicely with Smith's existing Dyonics range of
arthroscopic instruments and observatory instruments. Dyonics is also
based in Massachusetts and had sales of #105m last year. Smith will now
be able to offer doctors worldwide a full range of equipment.
Smith remains on the lookout for further high-technology acquisitions
and expects to pick them up from large healthcare groups looking to
dispose of their non-core operations.
After the acquisition the balance sheet will be only 20% geared with
debts expected to be around #80m by the year-end.
The Acufex deal is expected to be earnings-neutral this year and
earnings-enhancing in 1996.

THE Silver Tassie is often considered the poor relation of Sean
O'Casey's work, an experiment in form and flavour that puts far more
demand on audiences and performers than the more accessibly naturalistic
Juno and the Paycock and The Plough and the Stars. With its mixture of
almost verse-like prose and a second act that borders on oratorio it is,
still today, a far greater challenge and is far less frequently seen. A
shame because judging by this wonderful revival from Dublin's Rough
Magic director Lynne Parker, it's the kind of play once seen is likely
to leave an impression for life.
Similar to Juno and Plough in its fierce pacifism, The Silver Tassie
has a visionary passion however that puts it in another league
altogether. Set still in Dublin but breaking away from the specifically
Irish troubles to look at the theme of the sorrow of war related to the
First World War, Parker's translucent, inspired production constantly
seems to echo the satire of Oh What A Lovely War and the pathos of
Benjamin Britten's War Requiem as its young men -- and particularly
Harry Heegan, the football champ who wins the Silver Tassie -- are seen
leaving for the front and then returning injured, embittered -- their
lives shattered for ever. (O'Casey, like Britten was partly inspired by
the poems of Wilfred Owen; the title of the play from a song by Robert
Burns.)
There is nothing I have seen recently to compare with Stuart Graham's
agonised fury as the wheelchair-bound Harry or the blend of
unsentimental lyricism Parker brings to this timeless and great play.

NOW and again, something truly original comes our way. This time it is
the sound of a new cybernetics generation crashing up against the
ancient wisdoms of the Aborigines and other secrets of the Earth's
prehistoric past. Why, Dublin's Bickerstaffe company suggest, do we not
take more account of our planet's ancient history? Time and space and
the superhighway may be coming closer together but we're still left with
the eternal problems of personal happiness, angst and the meaning of
life.
This runaway success of the 1994 Dublin Theatre Festival has the broad
canvas strokes of a primary painting but the hip humour of a latter-day
Internet freak. Four Irish travellers are adrift in various parts of the
world -- an epiletic computer programmer in the Australian outback, a
journalist in Ethiopia in search for the oldest prehistoric woman, a
young hitch-hiker in Arizona running away from the trauma of an unwanted
abortion and Bill, hanging out in Berlin, pursued by a stream of
suicides who insist on throwing themselves off buildings right in front
of him.
Devised by the four actors -- Tom Murphy, Cathy Belton, Gwynne
McElveen and Start Townsend with director/designer John Crowley -- True
Lines ranges over a vast terrain of medicine, science, archaeology and
information technology but with a lightness and visual and dramatic
symmetry that constantly amazes.
Performed equally with a rare kind of freshness and wonderful skill,
this spider's web of connected entanglements leaves much food for sombre
reflection -- not least Belton and Murphy whose exchange on an Arizonian
highway as hitch-hiker and truck driver is a perfect metaphor in
miniature for the dangers and uncertainties of travellers on the road to
self-discovery.

LAST week something unusual happened at the Edinburgh Festival
Theatre. There was a performance by the Scottish dance company Soft
Bodies Hard Metal of a show called La Belle Dame. This was not in itself
out of the ordinary, seeming to fit in quite routinely with the
theatre's broad mix of ballet and contemporary dance, pop and classical
music, high and low-brow theatre.
It had a page to itself in the programme just like anything else. What
was significant was that it was a new company making its full-length
debut playing to an audience of just 120 gathered together on the
theatre's big stage.
In the subsidised sector this would not be considered extraordinary.
The Citizens', the Traverse and Perth Theatre all have permanent studio
spaces in addition to their main houses precisely so they can make room
for the new, the innovative, the less immediately popular as well as
their more mainstream fare. But for such an event to take place in a
commercial theatre is unheard of.
There's an obvious reason for this. You don't need to be an accountant
to calculate that even with an extra performance squeezed in because of
public demand as happened last week, there's a considerable discrepancy
between income raised from a small studio show and that raised from a
big blockbuster.
But I suspect there's also a more insidious reason. And that is that
by and large managements of big commercial operations have neither
interest in nor any sense of responsibility towards the output of the
next generation of theatre-makers.
Paul Iles, the general manager of the Festival Theatre, is the
exception. No doubt he believes his audiences should have the chance to
see work on the scale of La Belle Dame, but he must also know that
unless there is support for the Soft Bodies of today there will be no
crowd-pulling Michael Clarks or Lindsay Kemps of tomorrow. Such thinking
is far from orthodox for someone in his position. In essence his job is
to pick the known-names and the star-vehicles, slot them into some kind
of order and sell them. He's not employed to care. It's a bonus that he
does.
I'm not about to argue that all commercial managements should follow
his lead. I have little doubt that if the Festival Theatre's belt got
any tighter, this kind of event would be the first to go. Moral
obligation is a luxury not a necessity in the theatre. Which is why we
turn to the Scottish Arts Council and the local authorities for subsidy,
for the long-term perspective, for the encouragement of some higher
common denominators, in short, for our cultural enrichment. Market
forces are rarely kindly towards art.
What I would, however, argue is that if those people who are supplying
large-scale entertainment have no feeling for theatre's potential, no
vision of it beyond being a smart way to make money, then increasingly
the great mass of the theatre-going public is going to be provided with
entertainment that is ever more soulless, that makes fewer and fewer
real connections let alone demands, that in the end is cheap and
exploitative.
I say this because the conditions seem right for such deadly theatre
to flourish. And I don't point the finger at the managements. I point it
at the audiences. To an extent there has always been shoddy work sent
out to the big touring houses by producers anxious to squeeze every last
penny from their West End product. For as long as the theatre industry
is centred on London, it's inevitable that new shows will be road-tested
and old shows sent out to graze in regional theatres.
As with any form of entertainment, popular theatre can be good and
bad. But what worries me is the apparent lack of discrimination in the
audience for this work -- either a refusal or an inability to
distinguish the worthwhile from the rotten.
Too often when reviewing the big shows I feel like the one sober guest
at a drunken party. It's not through any antipathy towards the form --
on the contrary what could be more honourable than uniting a huge
audience in laughter or tears? -- it's just that it's deeply frustrating
seeing second-rate entertainment being dished out (and, worse, blithely
accepted) when you know it can be done so much better.
Take the audience for Borderline's current production of the two Billy
Connolly one-acters An Me Wi a Bad Leg Tae and When Hair was Long and
Time was Short. Now I don't want to make a dig about Borderline. Its
last major production, The Odd Couple with Gerard Kelly was hilarious
and I have every reason to believe that its next -- a revival of its
brilliant Trumpets and Raspberries starring Andy Gray -- will be so too.
To fish out a couple of neglected Connolly plays was at the very least a
worthwhile experiment.
The set is shoddy but there's little wrong with the production. That
in the end it doesn't make the grade -- basically the plays aren't up to
it -- is really no great insult. But as I sat in the Glasgow Pavilion on
the first night, not laughing very much while all around me was mirth
and merriment, I wondered what had happened to those audiences that made
this venue one of the most feared on the music-hall circuit. By today's
standards those crowds might possibly seem yobbish, intolerant, and
drunk, but at least they would be showing some discrimination.
Assuming I've not completely misjudged it, assuming that these two
playlets are not in fact exactly equal in quality to Trumpets and
Raspberries or The Steamie or A View from the Bridge or Romeo and Juliet
or any play that might capture the popular imagination, then the
audience around me was demonstrating an all-too-easy acceptance.
There are pressures abroad for the life-blood of the theatre to drain
away -- the things that make it special and distinct, the direct
contact, the relevance, the imagination, the confrontation -- yet the
audience seems happy to buy into it regardless.
Is it the passivity of television that has knocked the critical
faculty out of people? Is it the fact that having paid a hefty whack to
get into the show, they've got a vested interest, a financial stake in
having a good time? Is it that theatre-going has become so infrequent a
habit that audiences can no longer remember what the good stuff is like?
Whatever the reasons, a gulf of misunderstanding is developing between
audiences and reviewers.
Think back to the furore over Bill Bryden's The Big Picnic. The
letters pages were full of correspondence that rounded on the critics
for daring to suggest the production could have been better. I'm not
saying that the critics are always right, that they were right on this
occasion or even that there can be any right and wrong in theatre
reviewing -- but the critics' saving grace is surely that they must
question.
For without that questioning, it is all too easy for the bland, the
unambitious, the substandard and the unsatisfying to roll on unhindered.
And if that happens will we ever notice that theatre has degenerated
into a shallow pretence, an irrelevant spectacle, a dead-end artform? Or
will we be too busy lapping it up in  the name of a good night out?

Pioneer photographer Tom Kent is celebrated today for the suberb
quality of his
work. Yet he died in obscurity, poor and largely shunned by the Orkney
society he had taken such pains to record.
Around 6,000 glass plates from a life-time of photographic
endeavour form the foundation of a highly-prized archive at Kirkwall's
public library. But tragically for modern-day historians, many more
were destroyed - some by the photographer himself.
'After he died and his shop was being cleared out, there are stories
of boys stacking glass plates up against a wall and seeing who could
smash the most,' said Orkney's photographic archivist, David Mackie.
'But he also dumped a lot of them himself. He lived in Finstown and
it's said that that took barrow loads and tipped them off the end of the
pier.' Tom Kent worked as a professional photographer from 1898 until
1936. He learned his craft in Chicargo while working at a drugstore and,
when he returned home, set up in business at a shop in Kirkwall where he
also sold photographic equipment, stationary, fancy goods and books.
His pictures, now lovingly cared for, are a detailed record of
everyday life in a community that seems a world away from the modern
day Orkney.
There are shots of mighty battleships lined up at anchor in Scapa
Flow, of people rich and poor at work and play, of church and parish
outings, and of early cars and far more common horse-drawn vehicles.
Tom Kent is regarded as far more than just a recorder of events. He
had an artist's eye for composition and balance, and a determination
to put every ounce of his ability into each picture.
Many of the views he captured, and often turned into early postcards,
are little changed from the Orkney of today. It is the people and the
life they led that appear so different.
The bulk of the Tom Kent collection was gifted to the library by a
relative of his last photographic assistant. Others came from
Leonards, the Kirkwall newsagents who once sold his postcards.
'They led to the setting up of Orkney's photograpic archive,' said Mr
Mackie, 'and they're valued by people from thoughout the community.
'Yet he seems to have just faded away at the end of his life. When he
died there was no obituary or any appreciation of any kind of what he
had achieved.'
'We've tried to find out more about his life, but it's proved very
difficult. All we can do is wonder about all those lost plates.'

ALL paper and packaging companies have faced hefty price increases for
their raw materials, with some having been better than others at passing
on their higher costs to customers.
API is one such company, as shown in its record interim pre-tax
profits of #3.3m. Despite imposing higher prices API is having no
trouble winning new business.
Sales from continuing operations rose by 23% in the first half to
#44.1m and its current order book is strong. The group includes the
Livingston-based Whiley foils business.
Group chief executive Michael Smith thinks that the worst of the raw
material price increases and rationing may be over. Already some
suppliers have delayed their next round of price rises from June to
September and next year sees a lot of new production capacity coming on
stream which should exert further downward pressure on prices.
Since the current management came on board three years ago there has
been a conscious effort to raise productivity, build closer partnerships
with customers and suppliers and do more added-value products which can
command higher margins. This is an ongoing process but progress in all
three areas was made in the first half.
Efforts are being made to reduce the amount of scrap material. This
has involved the embossing of metallised scrap paper for use in
Christmas crackers and gift bags. It is currently working with Polaroid
to market a digital film-imaging system for instant X-rays and pre-press
products.
API has already won its first order for its embossable foil for use in
high-denomination bank notes to help combat counterfeiting. The
technology may have other applications, for example in passports and
driving licences.
Capital expenditure totalled #3m in the first six months, of which #2m
went on the new paper metallisation plant. API's management is confident
that it will be able to capture a large slice of the European market for
metallised-packaging products which is currently worth #300m and is
growing at 10% per annum.
API is on the lookout for acquisitions both geographically and in
product areas such as office supplies. It already carries out half its
business outside the UK. It has healthy finances with net cash at the
half-year of #1.5m and unused bank facilities.
The second half is traditionally the busiest for the group and Mr
Smith is optimistic about the prospects for the full year. In the first
half there was a bias towards lower-margin tobacco products but in the
second half greater emphasis will be on higher-margin business such as
the production of whisky labels.
In addition, some of the cost benefits associated with fully
integrating last year's J&amp;J Makin acquisition should start to come
through more strongly.
Reflecting the strong balance sheet and trading performance the
interim dividend has been raised by 10% to 4.07p and is covered 2.6
times by earnings. If the final dividend is increased by a similar
amount then there will have been a 50% compound increase in the dividend
since 1992.

THE head of steam put on by sterling on Friday evaporated yesterday.
The pound's trading pattern is mainly a reflection of the dollar's
performance. The pound came off the boil as the dollar retreated after
last week's heady advance.
The pound lost 0.85 pfennigs to DM2.2621 and 0.42 cents to $1.5663.
The trade-weighted index fell 0.6 to 84.1, comfortably above its
all-time low of 82.7 on Tuesday of last week, but still 5% down so far
this year.
The markets have been shaken by the Chancellor's decision to stay his
hand on rates, contrary to the advice it is generally thought he
received from the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George.
Expectations that the Chancellor will agree to a rate hike on June 7
have helped sterling to recover some lost ground, but markets are bound
to remain nervous until the deed is done. There was nothing in the
producer price data to diminish the strong case for a rate rise next
month.

Karachi, Monday
PAKISTAN'S cricket hero, hospital builder, and born-again Muslim Imran
Khan shocked many of his compatriots by choosing a rich young Briton as
his bride, it became clear today as people emerged from midday prayers
in Karachi.
''People were hopeful that he could play a national role after he
devoted his life to welfare activities and ending the discrimination
between rich and poor,'' said Mohammad Ibrahim, a businessman, outside a
Karachi mosque.
''But by this marriage he has fully proved his previous cheapness
which in no way suits a Muslim . . . He has damaged our image on an
international scale.''
In interviews and articles, Imran had attacked the ''brown sahibs'',
or Pakistanis who ape Western ways, and vowed to reform the education
system with a stress on home-grown values.
After successfully raising funds to build a cancer hospital in his
home city of Lahore in memory of his mother, Imran's expanding public
profile led many Pakistanis to believe he was considering a political
career, though he has denied it.
Relatives say Imran and Jemima Goldsmith underwent a Muslim marriage
ceremony in London two months ago when she converted from Judaism to
Islam. Imran has denied that the couple married in secret.
One man in the crowd outside the mosque said that Imran had done a
''noble deed'' by converting a Jewess to Islam by marriage and another
said this might help spread Islam's message. But not everyone agreed.
''It would have been better for Imran to marry a Muslim girl instead
of a Jew. We have no dearth of girls in Pakistan,'' said another man.
''With the wealth, popularity, and reputation Imran has, he should have
married a poor girl.''
Attaur Rehman, who works for the Immigration Department, also said
Imran had turned his back on the poor people who had donated funds for
his cancer hospital. ''He should have married some poor girl who cannot
marry for lack of a dowry,'' he said.
Aftab, a bank employee, faulted the cricketer for wedding a woman
whose parents got married after she was born. ''This does not suit our
religious beliefs,'' he said.
Sir James married Jemima's mother, Lady Annabel Birley, when their
daughter was four years old.
For some of his countrymen, the ''Lion of Pakistan'' lost face by
allowing news of his engagement to be announced in Britain by the
bride's parents and then evading the local media.
''It gives the impression he is not in control,'' commented Lahore
journalist Ahmed Rashid.--Reuter

Getting that first important step onto the retail management ladder
can prove difficult especially for school leavers but Eric Kennedy
learns that making the grade from the bottom up is by no means
impossible. Joining a department store as a sales assistant can open the
doors to an exciting and demanding career path
LIFE has much in store for Linda Murray. In store at Marks &amp; Spencer
in Newton Mearns, Glasgow, that is.
Linda took over as manageress there on March 20, the high point so far
of a career spent entirely with M&amp;S after she leftCrookston Castle
secondary in 1978.
The significant thing about her appointment is what it says about the
opportunities available to school leavers in the retail world.
Linda had been interested in retailing at secondary school, when her
mother was manageress of the Mothercare store in Union Street. She left
school with three Highers and five O-Grades and applied to a number of
firms for a place in retail management.
This drew a blank, but in October 1978 she landed a sales-assistant
job with M&amp;S in Sauchiehall Street. She found it varied and interesting.
''I have always enjoyed working with the public,'' she says, ''and
Marks is certainly the place to do that.'' She moved from department to
department, receiving on-the-job training in each.
Meanwhile the store's senior management had noticed her ambition and
capability, and in 1984 she took a step up to deputy supervisor level.
This gave her day-to-day responsibilities for running various
departments, she shadowed supervisors, was trained in management
techniques, and took part in various in-store courses in documentation,
development and service.
Promotion to supervisor level came in 1986, which again involved
working in the various departments -- menswear, foods, lingerie,
womenswear, etc. By this time there were between 40 and 50 people
working under her supevision. In 1991 she became a department manager,
working with the store's assistant managers and being given increasingly
senior duties.
At this level, M&amp;S executives are expected to display managerial
qualities of communication, persuasion, negotiation, and leadership. In
1994 Linda got the chance to go out to Newton Mearns and take over for
five months while the manageress was on maternity leave. By this time
the status of department manager had been declared equal to that of
assistant manager. Linda was now recognised as part of the management
set-up.
She returned to Sauchiehall Street, and in June 1994 was transferred
to Argyle Street, taking responsibility for the food department -- the
second-biggest, in terms of cash turnover, in the entire M&amp;S operation.
She was there until March, when she became manageress at Newton Mearns.
No day is the same for Linda, who starts at 8am, checking that the
shelves are properly stocked, the store clean and tidy, and items well
ticketed.
She is there until 6pm, meeting the public, representatives,
management of the shopping centre, dealing with security and staffing
matters, and welcoming visitors -- who might include top M&amp;S management
from London.
Life, in short, is never boring.
Tuesday is traditional training day when staff learn about the latest
products, computer systems, order systems, and other relevant
operational matters.
''Standards are rising all the time,'' says Linda. ''But that's the
way I like it.
''I have a challenging job, and one I find very rewarding.''

AS David Mamet's protagonists wage the battle of the sexesin Oleanna
at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh, another male and female war is
about to be staged in the Circle Studio at the Citizens' in Glasgow.
Making their Mayfest debut are young Glasgow-based theatre company
Lookout with Easy their new play about the controversial subject of
acquaintance rape.
Tagged ''date rape'' in America, it is an issue which was much hyped
in the media last year, due to some high-profile British court cases and
the publication of The Morning After, a book by the young American
feminist Kate Roithe which attacked the politically correct lobby.
Although Roithe poured scorn on the notion that date rape was
increasingly prevalent, her book did still associate it strongly with a
campus experience, a context Lookout are anxious to avoid, although the
core members of the company are all recent graduates of Glasgow
University and writer Nicola McCartney drew much of her research from
students' experiences.
She is careful to avoid the term date rape and instead uses
acquaintance rape, a term which denotes a universal experience and which
refers to the statistic that 75% of rapes are committed by someone the
woman knows.
''So many women are affected by it and I deliberately didn't choose
people from an academic, middle-class background,'' she says, although
interestingly, of the four characters in the play the one who is
middle-class, Paul, is the one who is accused of rape. ''It features a
young married couple who are celebrating their wedding anniversary. He
invites his boss and she invites her pal and they try to pair them off
and the rape results from that. It's quite unpleasant.''
Anxious to explore the ambiguities of sexual communication she insists
that this is not a didactic play. ''Easy, is not a propagandist piece.
Theatre does have a social function but I don't want to be all noble
about that. We are not saying we are an issued-based company because
this is the first social issue we have really tackled. We are doing this
play because we really wanted to, not because we want to bludgeon people
with morals.''
This forthright approach has been the inspiration behind the company
which was formed from a frustration at the lack of practical experience
on the drama course at Glasgow University. When McCartney and other
founder members Lucy McLellan and John Howard finished their studies
they wrote to various famous names, including Brian Friel, Julie
Walters, Jo Brand, Brian Cox and Iain Glenn, asking for donations to
finance a Fringe production. Their blunt and unpretentious approach
worked and they raised almost #1000. On a wing and a prayer they took a
double bill of new plays to the Gilded Balloon which received critical
acclaim and also caught the eye of Mayfest artist director Paul Bassett,
who invited Lookout to submit a proposal to him.

As the Royal College of Nursing prepares to ditch its no-strike clause
in defence of national wage agreements, Alan MacDermid looks at a tale
of two hospitals
THE fears of nurses and other hospital workers over locally negotiated
pay can be seen in the gulf between the Victoria Infirmary Trust in
Glasgow and the North Ayrshire and Arran Trust, based at Crosshouse
Hospital, Kilmarnock.
They have a lot in common -- both are busy district general hospitals
much cherished in their local community, with casualty departments and
other services ranging from the cradle to that last night in bed.
There the similarities start to fade. One hospital, a burgeoning
flagship undergoing extensive refits, was one of the first in Scotland
to offer the full 3% without strings.
The other has spent the past few years fighting for its survival and
has offered nothing on top of the nationally agreed 1%.
Yesterday the Victoria's chief executive, Mr Barrie Small, fended off
accusations that he runs the meanest NHS trust in Scotland. The
Victoria's offer of 1% for all non-medical staff is the lowest offer in
the UK -- it could hardly be lower.
As he prepared to meet union leaders representing the nurses and other
workers today, Small maintained: ''This is all the money we have
available.''
Although some improvement -- if only nominal -- can be expected in the
negotiations, Small made clear that anything added to the offer will
have to be paid for with savings. ''I am not prepared to go into what
they might be until we have spoken to the staff, but we have been
perfectly open with them on this all along,'' he said.
The past few years have been tempestuous ones for the Vicky, which
arouses passionate loyalties among the population in south-east Glasgow.
It has had some of its specialist services taken away by health board
rationalisation -- and had to fight to save others.
Then Greater Glasgow Health Board earmarked it for possible closure in
an even more drastic rationalisation, the Acute Services Strategy.
Health officials, and many of the consultants, scoffed when the
management set out to join the second wave of trusts in Scotland, but
they succeeded.
Now the Victoria, reprieved from the threat of closure but facing the
loss of its maternity unit in Rutherglen, has to operate this year on a
virtually standstill budget of #55m. There is an increase -- in real
terms it amounts to 0.3%, or #200,000, but a 1% increase alone for the
non-medical staff will cost #300,000, and the doctors' increase a
further #200,000.
The Victoria is among the hospitals in Glasgow and other major cities
feeling the knock-on effect of the Share formula which claws back
millions of pounds from health boards whose budgets were regarded as
disproportionately high in relation to their shrinking populations.
''Whether it is fair or not, our major purchaser, Greater Glasgow
Health Board, is subject to it and we have to cut our costs as this
takes place,'' said Small. ''I am not saying that we are being badly
treated by the health board -- they too are bound by the money they have
to pay us -- but our ability to react to these demands is not there.
''Where we differ from some hospitals is that we are a lot further
down the line with regard to amalgamations and closures within the
trust. Perhaps other trusts have more fat within them to peel off.''
Already the Victoria has reduced the number of beds over the past
seven years by 30% and ''amalgamated everything we could amalgamate,''
Small said.
All the kitchens have been almagamated into one, all the stores
likewise, and the pharmacies. But the savings from these have already
been used up, and this year's budget increased only marginally from last
year's. What is left?
''We are looking at better use of heating, better ways in which to
purchase supplies,'' said Small. ''And we have taken out a number of
senior managers -- people who have left and not been replaced. We are an
exceptionally busy hospital, treating more patients each year than we
have ever done.
''I am trying to make the savings away from the ward area wherever
possible -- areas which don't affect patients. A senior manager leaving
makes life more difficult at an administrative level but the patient
coming into the ward shouldn't notice the difference.''
There are 2500 staff, including part-timers, at the Victoria. Apart
from the doctors (awarded 2.5% in the national pay review) the 1%
applies to everyone, including Barrie Small.
The #51,000-a-year boss said: ''If the offer was 3% I would be taking
3%. But I could not stand up in front of my staff and say I would be
taking more than they were.''
Compare that to the North Ayrshire and Arran NHS Trust. Health boards
like Ayrshire and Arran have benefitted from the redistribution of funds
under the Share formula, and this is reflected in the Crosshouse budget.
Chief executive David Fraser sees the no-strings offer as just reward
for the economies his 3326 staff have made in the past -- so there is no
need for them to pay again.
Compared with the Victoria, he can afford to be generous -- his budget
has gone up 4% this year, from #75m to #78m. So he has #3m out of which
to find #600,000 to pay his nurses their increase -- the biggest single
element in his wage bill -- and follow this up with similar offers to
the paramedical, manual, and administrative staff.
He said: ''Although our budget has increased, we have to be more
productive, but we have done that successfully in the first two years.
The nurses and other staff groups have contributed to that and I am sure
we will be able to this year.
''The real way to improve efficiency is to come up with ways of being
more productive, and the staff have done a lot of useful things. We save
money and no-one loses.
''We are not linking the increase to future savings; we are rewarding
the performance that has been achieved -- we are seeing more patients,
we have a faster through-put, and our waiting times are among the
shortest in the UK.
''But there is something else more difficult to quantify; the
development of the quality of the service -- we get very good feedback
on that from parents, relatives, and the local health council.''
Fraser says he has no trouble recruiting nurses -- he wants to
motivate the ones he has by making them feel valued, but whether an
extra #6 a week is enough to start an exodus from Battlefield Cross to
Crosshouse is another matter. The threat from local pay bargaining may
take time to mature.

Cairo, Monday
ARCHAEOLOGISTS working in Egypt's Valley of the Kings have uncovered a
vast royal tomb that may be the biggest pharaonic burial chamber ever
found, Egyptian authorities said today.
US archaeologists explored the tomb, containing at least 67 chambers,
in February and believe that 50 sons of the powerful pharaoh Ramses II
were buried there 3000 years ago.
''This may be the biggest burial chamber found in Egypt so far,'' said
Egypt's Supreme Council for Antiquities, quoting American Egyptologist
Kent Weeks.
Abdelhalim Nourredin, head of the antiquities council, described it as
magnificent, even though it was in poor condition and had been badly
looted by grave robbers.
The entrance to the tomb was discovered last century in the rugged
limestone walls of the valley, just 30 yards from the tomb of Ramses II
himself, but floodwater debris had blocked off all but three of the
outermost chambers.
In February Weeks's team found a passageway leading past 20 chambers
to a statue of Osiris, god of the underworld. The corridor then divided
into two more passages, each with 20 rooms, which end in stairs leading
perhaps to yet more rooms.
Ramses II, one of ancient Egypt's last great leaders, ruled for 60
years during the 13th century BC.
Like dozens of pharaohs Ramses II had his tomb dug into the Valley of
the Kings, across the Nile from the ancient capital of Thebes, about 310
miles south of modern Cairo.
His mummified corpse was later moved to prevent it falling prey to
grave robbers It now lies in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.--Reuter.

YOU know that old office cliche, ''You don't have to be mad to work
here . . . but it helps'' -- well madness (or perhaps sadness) would
seem to be a prerequisite for employment with the Jim Rose Circus.
The Pavilion, in all its splendour, had the air of an out-of-season
seaside music hall courtesy of the jangly sideshow muzak and the
sparseness of bums on seats.
What we were treated to was a veritable menu of razor-blade
swallowing, sword swallowing, maggot chewing, and for me, the swallowing
of belief. I expected Des Lynam to pop up saying, ''How do they do
that?'' at any moment.
Jim stuck a teaspoon up his nose then laid out a bed of glass, placed
his head on it and invited Linda from the audience to stand on his face.
You get the picture.
But I challenge any man in the audience to deny that there weren't
tears in his eyes as Mr Lifto proceeded to raise and then swing two
irons between his legs, suspended from a hook attached his genitals.
It was a kind of bodily mutilation which went down best with the
audience, although the whole show remained strangely unengaging. There
is no build-up, no sense of mounting excitement, just a procession of
dangerous and crafted stunts from these highly skilled performers.
The climax came when Mark The Knife became Mr Flymo and balanced a
mighty looking lawnmower on his upper lip. Red Neck Jim invited an old
man from the front to ''make coleslaw'' and throw a cabbage at the
rotating blades.
And I thought the tradition of throwing veg at the stage went out with
the Glasgow Empire.

YOU can tell it's a comedy because there's an article headed ''A
Barrel of Fun'' in the programme. You can tell it's a comedy because
someone -- a deranged person, I imagine -- is cackling down in the
stalls. You can tell it's a comedy because the actors shout ABSOLUTELY
EVERYTHING.
That's how we know. Presumably the performers had to be told.
Presumably the director Rob Bettinson, who also happens to be the
writer, let it slip in rehearsals -- darlings I think this is rather
funny -- and presumably he looked disappointed when it didn't quite
click, so presumably they all tried that bit harder. Just for him.
And they're still trying. How they try. They'll yell the comedy back
into this feeble effort if it costs them their Equity cards.
Representatives of the St John's Ambulance Brigade should watch with a
keen eye because if they are ever asked to perform artificial
respiration on a play instead of a member of the public these actors
have life-and-death knowledge to impart.
I find it hard to muster the energy to record the fact that Bare
Necessities (which despite the title doesn't even have the temerity to
be smutty) is about four couples on a campsite, each in various states
of marital discord and midlife crisis. One of them doesn't really like
the countryside. Ha! One of them calls her children the SS. Ha, ha! One
of them thinks beans make you fart. Ha, ha, ha! I won't mention the
actors by name. The poor souls clearly need the money.

For 35 years the name of Ola Gorie has been synonymous with quality
jewellery reflecting Orkney's rich heritage.
What started out as a huge gamble for Ola and husband Arnold Tait has
spawned a tradition of high-quality jewellery making in the islands.
Ola's fine designs and craftmanship have earned the company a
worldwide reputation and a thriving order book.
''It's amazing when you think the company started out in a small
workshop at the back of my parents' house in 1960,'' she said.
When marriage and Canada beckoned a year later, it was Ola's parents
who kept her small clientel supplied with the distinctively designed
jewellery.
Eight years and three children later, Ola and Arnold returned to the
islands and decided to risk everything and make a go of the tiny
business.
''It was a real gamble especially as we didn't even know if Arnold
could make jewellery,'' she said.
''He started at the workbench beside me and I taught him. It's lucky
he got the hang of it so quickly.''
The business is very much a family affair with Ola still designing an
extensive range of imaginative pieces while Arnold is the managing
director.
Two sons have joined the enterprise. Shawn (corr)is production manager
and Neil works in the shop. Sister Ingrid Tait has followed in the
family's creative tradition and is the owner of the fabric and textile
company Tait &amp; Style (cor) The Ola Gorie company, which moved into its
shop and workshop opposite St Magnus cathedral 26 years ago, today
employs 43 people.
The islands, their vast history, the weather and the sea are just some
of the influences which weave their way through Ola's jewellery.
''When I first started, the designs reflected the essence of Orkney.
There was just nothing like it being done here - there was no history of
jewellery-making in the islands,'' she said.
And how does it make Ola feel that she has created a jewellery-making
tradition? 'Old, very old indeed!'' she says with a smile.

Beijing, Monday
CHINA was widely condemned today for setting off an underground
nuclear blast just days after promising the world at a key UN meeting
that it would exercise restraint.
Russia, the US, Japan, Australia, South Korea and Kazakhstan all
protested. Analysts and anti-nuclear groups called it a sign of bad
faith.
The world's other declared nuclear weapons powers -- Britain, the US,
Russia and France -- have all suspended tests and a worldwide treaty to
ban them completely is under negotiation in Geneva.
China gave no details of the blast but claims it needs to conduct more
tests before agreeing to the test ban treaty next year.
A Washington spokesman said: ''The United States deeply regrets
China's testing and urges China to cease testing.'' Russia said the
Chinese test could upset the test ban talks and urged Beijing to stop.
''China had conducted its fourth blast while other nuclear powers show
restraint and maintain a moratorium on such tests for more than two
years,'' the Russian foreign ministry said.--Reuter.

A major development is underway in Stromness to create jobs, safeguard
the livelihood of fishermen - and generate the development of delicacies
such as crab pate.
A new shellfish processing factory is being built on the outskirts of
the town at a cost of almost 660,000 pounds.
It will replace the present plant operated by the Orkney Fishermen's
Society, which is being forced to close because is fails to meet
stringent new European hygiene regulations.
As well as threatening the jobs of 19 people employed at the factory,
closure would have brought severe consequences for 30 fishermen who use
it to land their entire catches as well as a further 20 who sell the
brown crab portion of their catch to the company.
The development, on the Garson Industrial Estate, reflects the way
Orkney Enterprise and the islands council join forces on economic
development initiatives.
The local enterprise company is investing 198,000 pounds in the
project while the council is leasing the site to the company, carrying
out 50,000 pounds worth of preperation work and providing a further
5,000 pounds in grant assistance. Financial backing of almost 250,000
pounds was won from the European Commission.
Orkney Enterprise chief executive Ken Grant said: ''This new factory
is vital to the local fishing community.
''The current premises are made up of a series of sheds and other
outbuildings which simply cannot be upgraded.
''Without Orkney Enterprise and the council working together to
provide this assistance, the factory would have closed - dealing a
serious body blow to the local economy.
''Now, instead of closure, the company will have a plant that will
take it into the next century and provide the facilities it needs to
expand its operations in future.''
The council's economic development director, Jeremy Baster, added:
''This is a company that was originally set up by the fishing community
and is still predominantly run by that community.
''In supporting this project, we are supporting a large number of
local people who are doing their utmost to ensure that this operation
continues.''
Orkney Fishermen's Society is injecting 130,000 pounds of its own
resources into the development and aims to raise a further 50,000 pounds
in share capital.
Manager Stewart Chrichton said: ''Crab processing in recent years has
struggled to achieve profitability.
''This new factory will allow us to examine new products and use more
of the lower value brown crab meat.
''Already one company has developed a crab pate for us and we are also
wrking on creating crab cakes and crab pastries.''

Valenciennes, Monday
FRANCE'S Bernard Tapie, his business empire in ruins and his political
career in tatters, was sentenced to a year in jail today for rigging a
soccer match when he was chairman of the Marseille club.
A court in the northern city of Valenciennes convicted Tapie, 52, of
bribing players of the local Valenciennes team to lose a 1993 league
game to Marseille. It sentenced him to a year in jail with another year
suspended.
Five others on trial with him, including his former deputy and players
of both sides, received lesser sentences or fines.
It was the first time that Tapie, a former cabinet minister who has
been declared bankrupt and barred from politics for five years, was
sentenced to jail in a rags-to-riches-to-rags career.
The left-wing politician, once tipped as an outsider in France's 1995
presidential elections, sat in the court as if frozen by shock when he
heard the sentence.
''Now that the judges feel they have a free hand, I'll stay there 10
years if I go to prison,'' Tapie said after the ruling, predicting he
could be sentenced on other counts linked to his collapsing business
empire.
Defence lawyer Francis Debacker said Tapie had not expected such a
punishment. He called it ''excessive and unacceptable'' as, he said,
there was no serious evidence against his client.
Tapie has several days to decide whether to appeal against the
sentence before going to jail. ''I think they did not leave him any
alternative to appealing,'' Debacker said.
Any appeal would block implementation of the sentence, following a
trial two months ago that generated as much interest in France as the O
J Simpson murder trial in the United States.
Tapie was accused of rigging a game with Valenciennes six days before
his club won the 1993 European Cup against AC Milan, and then of
interfering with witnesses to cover up his role.
Prosecutors said the match-rigging ensured Tapie's team was rested for
the far more important clash with AC Milan. Marseille won both games 1-0
but were stripped of their league title and relegated to the second
division after the scandal.
The sentence was harsher than the six-month prison term, with another
12 months suspended, demanded by the public prosecutor against Tapie,
who admitted lying in court in an often rowdy trial. He consistently
denied the bribery charges.
But his former right-hand man Jean-Pierre Bernes, the team's former
general secretary, testified during the trial that Tapie had dreamed up
and organised the match-rigging scam.
Other witnesses, including former minister Jacques Mellick, also
admitted to lying to create a false alibi for Tapie.
Bernes was given a two-year suspended sentence.
Former Marseille midfielder Jean-Jacques Eydelie was given a one-year
suspended jail term and a 10,000 franc ($2000) fine.
Ex-Valenciennes players Jorge Burruchaga, a member of Argentina's 1986
World Cup winning squad, and Christophe Robert were each given a
six-month suspended term and a 5000 franc ($1000) fine, as was Robert's
wife Marie-Christine, for taking bribes.
A self-made millionaire, Tapie was declared personally bankrupt and
ineligible to hold public office for five years last December.
He has appealed against that ruling and remains a member of the French
and European parliaments pending the outcome.--Reuter.

Ian Bruce, Defence Correspondent, reports on the military challenges
facing Europe in the post-cold war era, with America reluctant to fight
our battles for us
THE years since the end of the cold war have been both a challenge and
a trial for a Europe locked on to the track of less dependence on US
military power. But moving towards the goal of self-sufficiency in
defence may impose intolerable financial and political burdens for EU
governments facing increasing domestic social problems.
American reluctance to become involved in direct ground intervention
in the former Yugoslavia has brought Europe's dilemma into sharp focus.
Nato existed to counter the threat of Soviet aggression. It had no remit
for operations outside the immediate Nato arena.
Now the previously dormant Western European Union, the community's
military arm, has been revived to bridge the gap between the limitations
of US foreign policy, Nato's own shortcomings, and EU concerns over
civil and ethnic conflict on its frontiers.
To date, it has not been an unqualified success. Its first, fledgling
ventures into the military arena have sent flotillas of minesweepers to
the Persian Gulf in 1988 to clear shipping lanes during the Iran-Iraq
war and again in 1990 to aid the allied coalition's naval effort against
Iraq.
It produced a handful of warships to try to stem arms shipments to the
various factions fighting in Croatia and Bosnia, and it helps maintain a
leaky and ineffective blockade of gun-runners on the Danube.
In bellicose but unrealistic mode, it even called for a 100,000-man
contingent drawn from its nine member states to intervene directly to
halt the Bosnian civil war and raise the siege of Sarajevo. It was a
notion quashed swiftly by Britain and France, members more aware than
most of the practical limitations of peacemaking in a hostile
environment.
Britain sees the WEU as a potentially useful link between Europe and
Nato's European forces where the issues do not concern the US. But
Britain is also determined to tie both the Americans and Canadians to
Europe through the Nato framework as a safeguard for the future.
The French see the WEU as the way forward for a purely European-led
alliance. They also hope to enmesh Germany in its structure to counter
any possible future military adventurism by Bonn, and to be at the
centre of the new European axis decision-making processes.
Germany is so far keen to extend its co-operation with France. The two
have formed a Franco-German brigade, largely as a public relations
exercise. Expert military judgment tends, however, towards the view that
it will not be the model for an integrated European army of the next
century.
Bonn, apart from being seen to extend the hand of friendship to a
three-time former enemy, is opposed to the more extreme examples of
France's anti-US stance. Living in the potential superpower battleground
for 40 years has given the Germans a healthy respect for the value of
Nato.
The major stumbling block to any purely European ambition is cash. It
would take, even with the combined military resources of the UK, France,
and Germany, as well as Italy, Spain and others, a huge outlay to
compensate for the forfeiture of US logistical, transport, and
intelligence assets.
At the most reasonable guesstimate Euro-taxpayers would have to
increase their contributions to defence spending by about #70bn a year
at a time when the budgets of all concerned are declining steadily.
Britain's entire defence budget, one of the highest in Europe, stands
currently at #21.7bn.
Much of that extra money would have to be spent on satellite
reconnaissance systems and transport aircraft. Both would be vital to
any operation beyond the WEU's immediate borders.
The most recent WEU study on the subject says it would cost #15bn
alone for a complete family of radar, infra-red and communications
satellites. It would also take up to 25 years to have these in place.
And even then, the command and control system would not match the one
the Americans already possess.
WEU members could not mount an airlift capable of delivering several
hundred thousand troops to a threatened area within any realistic time
frame. One analyst claims they could not transport even a small
percentage of the manpower needed for an operation on the scale of the
Gulf war.
The WEU would also need to build several new aircraft carriers to give
it the ability to project its airpower beyond the Mediterranean to cover
landings in the Middle East or elsewhere.
Despite considerable advances in standardisation within Nato, there
are still major differences between members on key weapon systems. The
British use a rifled gun on their Challenger tanks. French Leclercs and
German Leopards have smooth-bore barrels and fire different and
incompatible ammunition.
Eurofighter 2000 was supposed to be the joint collaborative project
which would pave the way forward for a standard warplane. The larger
production run was aimed at cutting the cost of individual aircraft.
But Germany slashed its own order after the collapse of the Soviet
Union, and Bonn and London entered into an acrimonious and expensive
debate over the aircraft's capabilities. The result was spiralling
expense for all concerned.
There are currently 11 major arms and defence electronics companies
operating within Europe, three of them British and two part-British.
Five manufacture missiles and electronics in competition with each
other.
Six build aircraft, and three tanks and other military vehicles,
artillery, small arms, and ammunition. Two, including Yarrow in
Scotland, build warships as part of their portfolios.
There is no rationalisation of needs, although mergers between firms
making similar lines in hardware would make economic sense. Some joint
projects have been undertaken, but the demands of national employment
tend to sour the deals.
The UK is in the process of forming a single, integrated headquarters
for all three of its armed services after several years of Treasury-led
bloodletting over manpower and other costs.
It has also come up with the most practical stop-gap measure of
dealing with European crises in which the Americans may not wish to
become embroiled. That is to borrow existing command structures such as
the British-led Allied Rapid Reaction Corps -- part of Nato -- or any
similar headquarters, and to draft in or out the various nationalities
and forces needed for each individual task.
Although it is almost inconceivable that the WEU would itself be
involved in a major conflict not involving the US, Yugoslavia has left a
bad taste in the collective mouth.
Perhaps the most important factor to consider for a Europe still
adjusting to the prospect of brushfire wars on its doorstep is that it
should keep Washington sweet to enable it to use US logistical and
intelligence backup without demanding direct involvement. In the absence
of common policy or funding, it seems the only logical answer for now.

Buenos Aires, Monday
PRESIDENT Carlos Menem has won another term in office on his record of
economic stability. Waving to a cheering crowd from Juan Peron's
balcony, he promised work for all Argentines.
''We already pulverized hyper-inflation. Now we're going to pulverise
unemployment,'' Menem said.
With two-thirds of the ballots counted, Menem had won 49.01% of the
vote against 30.86% for his main opponent, Jose Bordon.
Bordon, of the centre-left Frepaso coalition, conceded defeat.
The Peronist Party ''has become in the past few years an invincible
force,'' Menem said to the crowd carrying placards with portraits of
Peron and his legendary wife Evita.
''Continue celebrating, continue rejoicing and tomorrow all to work,
all to meet his obligations because we tomorrow will continue with one
man firmly serving our country as it deserves,'' he shouted.
Menem dedicated his victory to his son, Carlos, who died in a
helicopter crash earlier this year.
Runner-up Bordon hailed the emergence of his coalition as a new force
in Argentine politics.
''Frepaso will be voted into government in 1999 because the support we
received in this election will grow in the coming years,'' he told his
supporters.
He had challenged Menem by drawing middle-class voters and portraying
himself up as the honest, austere alternative to the flamboyant Menem,
who is tainted by corruption scandals.--Reuter.

A 73-year-old antiques dealer who died after being robbed of #20,000
would not open his front door to anyone, a court heard yesterday.
However, Mr Leonard Pollington was tricked by a man posing as a postman.
He opened his door and three men barged in and tied up the terrified
dealer.
They ransacked his house at 52 Seafield Road, Dundee, and stole the
money.
One of them, John Gilmour, 27, now serving eight years for his part in
the assault and robbery in August l992, claimed a fourth man planned the
crime.
He claimed Mr Kevin Reilly, 33, of 30 Longtown Road, Dundee, was paid
#3000 for his part in the robbery.
Gilmour, of Burnbank, Hamilton, Lanarkshire, told advocate depute
Allan Turnbull: ''Reilly said the old man would not open his front door
to anyone and suggested that we dress up as delivery men to trick him.''
He also alleged that Mr Reilly told them Mr Pollington kept cash in
his house, the High Court in Glasgow heard.
Mr Pollington died the day after the robbery. He had closed his
antiques shop in the city's Perth Road because he had been robbed so
often.
Mr Reilly denies assaulting and robbing Mr Pollington at his home and
previously at his shop.
The trial before Lord Cameron continues.

A new record is due to be set this year for the number of cruise
liners visiting the islands.
Forty three liners carrying more than 12,000 passengers dropped anchor
in Orkney during the summer of 1994.
It made the islands the busiest destination for cruise ship traffic
anywhere in Britain and Ireland apart from the port of Tilbury.
And it put Orkney at number eight in a league table covering ports
from Iceland to Portugal.
So far, 48 liners are due to visit Orkney this summer - bringing with
them a major boost for the islands' economy.
''Last year's total of 43 made 1994 a record year,'' said harbours
director Bob Sclater.
''The passengers represent excellent business for our shops and the
bus operators who run tours for visitors.
''If each passenger spends only 20 pounds ashore - and many will spend
far more - the total amount of money generated would be almost 250,000
pounds.''
Orkney has set out to market itself as a perfect destination for
liners.
Captain Sclater has just returned from a second promotional visit to
the Seatrade Conference in Miami, the most important showcase for the
cruise ship industry.
''There is so much on offer that Orkney really sells itself,'' he
said.
''There's our rich archaeological heritage, the wealth of wildlife,
superb scenery and magnificent landmarks like St Magnus Cathedral.
''Passengers who come ashore for six to eight hours get a feel for
Orkney.
''They may see only one chapter out of the whole story, but some will
want to come back for a longer holiday.''
Liners due to anchor off and tie up alongside the piers at Kirkwall
and Stromness this year will vary is size from the 200 metre Europa to
the 72 metre Hebridean Princess.
They will either have sailed from or be travlling on to places as far
apart as Stornoway, Dundee, Inverewe, St Kilda, Lerwick, Invergordon,
Bremerhaven, Leith, Reykjavik and Thorshavn.

Geneva, Monday
THE World Health Organisation today reported a dramatic upsurge in
deaths from the Zaire Ebola epidemic and said the fatal virus was
expected to stage a comeback.
WHO spokesman Richard Leclair said the latest death toll was 77, up
from a figure of 60 given earlier in the day, out of a total of 84
confirmed cases.
He said WHO-led experts in Kikwit, the town at the heart of the
outbreak, were fanning out to investigate rumours of dozens of other
cases and at least 15 more deaths in towns and villages around Kikwit.
''They've done an analysis of the cases and they expect the numbers to
start rising,'' Leclair said, adding that people who had come into
contact with earlier victims were in the period of incubation.
''We expect the numbers to start rising over the next two to three
weeks,'' he said.
Leclair said no cases had yet been reported in Kinshasa, Zaire's
teeming capital of five million 300 miles from the centre of the
epidemic.
But one death, of a person originally infected in Kikwit, had been
confirmed in Kenge, only 120 miles from Kinshasa.
A senior WHO official, Dr Giorgio Torrigiani, said the maximum
incubation period for the virus, which kills through massive
haemorrhaging of body tissue, was reckoned to be three weeks.
''In general, you consider the epidemic over only when you go twice
the length of the incubation period without any new cases,'' he said.
''That would mean six weeks.''
He added: ''Imagine if you find a household where 10 people have been
looking after somebody who died. In three weeks you could get 10 new
cases.''
The United Nations' health agency has previously been keen to calm
fears that the virus would spread out from Kikwit. Its message has been
that basic precautions such as barrier nursing -- making medical
personnel wear gowns, gloves and protective shoes -- should contain the
outbreak.
Torrigiani praised a ''Don't Touch!'' information campaign run by the
Zairean government, which he said had educated people about what not to
do.
According to local custom, family members evacuate the bowels of the
dead by hand before burial, a practice that almost guarantees
transmission of the virus.
''In a way, we have been waiting (in Kikwit) for the patients to go to
the hospital. Now we have to go and see what is happening outside,''
Torrigiani said.
''What we will find in the villages, we don't know.''--Reuter.

THE former Pakistan cricket captain Imran Khan and heiress Jemima
Goldsmith flew out of Britain yesterday in a bid for privacy after the
announcement of their forthcoming marriage whipped up a media frenzy.
Imran, 42, said his 21-year-old fiancee, the daughter of tycoon Sir
James Goldsmith, was prepared for life in his Muslim homeland. She has
already converted to Islam.
''We will be living there because Pakistan is my home,'' said Imran.
He added: ''I've always lived there. I just used to spend time in
Britain when I was playing cricket.''
The couple, who flew to Paris, yesterday announced that they would
marry on June 20. Jemima, a student at Bristol University, said: ''I'm
very much looking forward to the big day.''
When asked about living in Pakistan, she replied: ''There's a lot of
questions but I'm very happy about the prospect of living there.''
Imran said both families' attitude to the wedding was ''absolutely
fine'' and he denied reports that the couple had already married in
secret.
''That's not true at all,'' he said. ''What would be the point in
hiding that? The wedding is a celebration so why should one get married
before announcing the engagement?''
According to the reports, which quoted Imran's relatives in Pakistan,
the couple were married ''two months ago in London'' in an Islamic
ceremony which took place at the Islamic Central Mosque, Regent's Park.
However, the official in charge of wedding ceremonies at the centre,
Helmi Shuweikh, said that no such ceremony had taken place.
The couple, who flew to France to ''get away from London'', will wed
at Richmond Register Office, south-west London. The ceremony will be
followed by a party at the Goldsmiths' home nearby.
Referring to the glare of publicity, Imran said: ''There's no privacy
here with everything going on.''
Asked if the future Mrs Khan could cope with life in Pakistan, he
said: ''There has been a lot of comment about that, but the only reason
for that is that people don't understand. But in time they will know . .
.
''Jemima is an intelligent woman who has thought it out. She knows
what she wants. At the moment nobody knows about her.
''They think she's some young fresh little girl. But in time that
impression will be corrected.''

A KNIFE-WIELDING drug addict who terrorised a woman store assistant
was jailed for five years yesterday after a judge pledged the courts'
protection for shop workers.
Heroin user Alan Stewart, 32, pulled out a Stanley knife in the shop
Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, and told the woman: ''Give me the f------
money.''
The High Court in Edinburgh heard that the distressed employee managed
to flee from the premises but Stewart snatched #70 from the till.
Lord Johnston told Stewart he had committed an extremely serious
offence which the courts sought to deter.
''This court will not tolerate persons going about their lawful
employment in shops being threatened by people like you,'' he told
Stewart.
The judge said he would jail Stewart for five years for the shop raid,
in the hope that it would make an example of him.
Lord Johnston told Stewart: ''Once again, drugs feature in this case.
That may explain but it does not excuse.''
Unemployed Stewart, of Sikeside Street, Sikeside, Coatbridge, admitted
the assault at M &amp; D Stores, in the town's Calder Street, on May 30 last
year and robbing the woman of #70.
He presented a knife at her and demanded that she open the cash
register.
Lord Johnston told Stewart he had ''an appalling record'' for his age
and pointed out that he had a similar conviction in the past.
Stewart, who committed the robbery while out on bail, was given a
further three months for breaching his bail conditions.
Advocate-depute Paul McBride said two women were working in the store
when Stewart went up to the counter and asked to see birthday cards.
One tuirned to get the cards but, when she turned back, found he was
armed with the knife.
The advocate-depute said: ''She was not physically injured in the
incident but it goes without saying she found the experience a
distressing one.''
Father-of-two Stewart fled from the crime scene but was arrested two
months later after police traced him.
Defence counsel Martin Jones said Stewart had been very heavily
addicted to heroin at the time of the raid and was desperate for cash.

Grozny, Monday
RUSSIAN planes and artillery blasted Chechen villages around the
breakaway region's southern mountains today in a clear bid to head off a
protracted guerrilla war.
Three jets dropped bombs on Ishkhoi-Yurt on Chechnya's eastern border
which sent thick black smoke rising into the sky.
Cars and trucks sped out of the village after the attack, fearing
another strike. There were no reports of casualties.
Earlier two planes fired rockets at the village of Serzhen-Yurt,
southeast of the wrecked Chechnya capital Grozny, as helicopter gunships
flew overhead. The Russians also pounded Serzhen-Yurt and nearby
mountains with heavy artillery and Grad rockets, and a column of at
least 70 Russian armoured vehicles headed towards the area.
Other high altitude jets sent rockets screaming into the settlement of
Arloi-Aul, near Chechnya's border with Dagestan.
Since a temporary Kremlin ceasefire expired four days ago they have
stepped up efforts to prevent the rebels setting up bases and a command
structure in the mountains from which they could wage partisan
war.Reuter.

PROFESSIONAL shoplifter Kate Logan, the Scot banned by a judge from
visiting every shop in England, collapsed yesterday as she was sentenced
to nine months in prison.
The 39-year-old Glasgow bus stewardess suddenly keeled over and
slumped to the dock floor, and was unconcious for almost five minutes,
as she was being sentenced at York Crown Court.
Three prison escorts revived her and she was allowed to sit to hear
Judge Jackie Davies pass sentence. The judge told her: ''I know you know
I had no other option.''
Logan, of Emerson Road, Bishopbriggs, Glasgow, had admitted two
offences of stealing expensive designer clothing from York fashion
stores on a professional shoplifting expedition.
She achieved notoriety last month when she appeared at the same court
and was banned from entering every shop in Britain by Judge Jonathan
Crabtree as part of her bail conditions. She must not cross the
threshold of any English shop, he said.
Yesterday, Mr Andrew Woolman, defending Logan, said the ban and
consequent publicity had had a disastrous effect on her, causing her to
seek medical treatment for stress.
Mr James Hargan, prosecuting, said Logan, her brother, John McSweeney,
and Miss Catherine Stewart travelled to York in April last year and
visited the French Salon at Fenwick's store. She tried on clothes but
later told an assistant they were too expensive.
Logan was seen leaving with a bulging carrier bag and, later that day,
dressed in a completely different set of clothes, she went to Brown's
Store in York, added Mr Hargan.
Carrier bags she had taken in with her were noticed to be fuller when
she left and Logan and the other two were arrested by police, who were
alerted. Several items of stolen clothing worth #1000 were found in
their car boot.
McSweeney, 42, was fined #l80 and Stewart was sentenced to 80 hours'
community service by magistrates in York.
Mr Woolman said: ''I have to accept this was a deliberate shoplifting
expedition by a team from Glasgow.'' He said Logan had many previous
similar convictions in all parts of the country and could offer no
excuses.
Before her collapse, Logan was told by Judge Davies: ''You are a
determined and persistent professional shoplifter. You came to this city
with a view to stealing as much designer clothing as you could.''

<HEADLINE>Women awarded #20,000 for MoD sex bias</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Ministry of Defence yesterday admitted breaking the law by paying
servicewomen less in redundancy than men.
In a test case brought by three former servicewomen, the MoD accepted
liability and settled out of court.
The three women, who claimed they were unfairly treated when they left
the Army last year, were yesterday awarded compensation totalling around
#20,000.
The Ministry, already hit with a #100m bill for sacking women who
became pregnant, now faces further discrimination claims.
Miss Catherine Hollingworth, 27, Mrs Inga Thompson, 27, and Mrs
Christine Dickinson, 31, each served in the Army for more than eight
years.
They accepted voluntary redundancy under the Options For Change
programme, introduced at the end of the Cold War to reduce defence
forces.
However, they got #6000 less in redundancy pay than men with the same
length of service and rank.
The MoD now seems certain to be forced to pay a further #300,000 to
women who accepted redundancy from the Army.
The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC), which brought the case under
European equal-pay legislation, said there were 50 further former
servicewomen entitled to make similar claims.
It added that the discrimination arose because the women were allowed
to sign only a three-year service contract when they joined up.
Any man who enlisted at the same time was entitled to sign up for nine
years -- putting him on a higher pay and pension scale.
Ms Dinah Rose, representing the women, told an industrial tribunal at
Southampton: ''Women were not able to commit themselves to nine years.
''These three women have all served around eight and half years on a
lower rate of pay.
''When they volunteered for redundancy, the men received higher
redundancy payments.
''The women were employed on different terms to the men and, as a
result, they received lower redundancy payments purely on the basis of
their sex.''
Mrs Thompson, of Aldershot, Hampshire, and Miss Hollingworth, of
Reading, Berkshire, both reached the rank of lance-corporal. Mrs
Dickinson, from Aldershot, was a corporal.
All three were recruited into the Women's Royal Army Corps, which was
disbanded in 1991 as the Army sought to assimilate women into the
service.
At the tribunal, the MoD admitted liability.
A Defence Ministry spokesman said later: ''There were 54 women with
less than nine years' service involved in the Options For Change
redundancy programme.
''Ten of these servicewomen have made applications to industrial
tribunals and a further 21 have applied to the Army for compensation.''
He added: ''The MoD has made an offer in these three cases which has
been accepted. We will now give this settlement careful consideration to
see how it will affect any other claims made against the MoD.''

A BAN on homosexuals serving in the armed forces was condemned
yesterday as ''outrageous, irrational, perverse'' and out of step with
the forces of Britain's major allies.
It amounted to ''pandering to the worst types of prejudice'' and was
''quite simply a disgrace'', said David Pannick QC, launching a historic
High Court challenge to the Government's veto on gay servicemen and
women.
In a vigorous attack on the Ministry of Defence and the military
establishment, he described the policy as ''grossly unreasonable and
arbitrary'' and said it ''defies rational thought''.
Mr Pannick told Lord Justice Simon Brown and Mr Justice Curtis: ''As
your lordships will see from the evidence, it demeans all those who are
responsible for its implementation.''
Britain now stood alone among the major Nato and Commonwealth allies
in maintaining the automatic bar on gay men and lesbians and it was time
for the courts to rule it unlawful.
Mr Pannick said four victims of the policy -- ''each with an
impressive service record'' -- were jointly making yesterday's landmark
application for a judicial review.
Former Lieutenant Commander Duncan Lustig-Prean, 36, from London, the
most senior of the four, was dismissed as ''unsuitable'' at the end of
last year only months after being commended by his commanding officer.
The other three are former RAF Sergeant Graeme Grady, 32, from London;
former RAF nurse Jeanette Smith, 28, from Edinburgh; and former Royal
Navy weapons engineer John Beckett, 25, from Sheffield.
They all want Britain to repeal the ban so they can return to their
jobs.
Mr Pannick stressed how times had changed, and the Canadians,
Australians, and the Americans had, in the 1990s, agreed to accept gay
service personnel.
It had also now been accepted by the British Government that senior
civil servants and ambassadors should not be excluded from office simply
because they were homosexual.
However, it still insisted that the ban be applied to ordinary
servicemen and women on security grounds.
He said that, instead of a total ban, Britain should introduce a
''code of appropriate behaviour'', in line with those already introduced
by military allies, with each serviceman or woman being judged on their
own performance and not on the basis of highly-prejudicial stereotypes.
Gay activists, many wearing multi-coloured ''equality ribbons'',
including actor and director Sir Ian McKellen, listened as the case
opened in Court 3 at London's Law Courts.
Sir Ian said outside: ''It is a case of enormous significance to those
in the military and civilians alike.''
In court, Mr Pannick, representing the applicants with the exception
of Mr Grady, said each had served in the Forces ''with skill and
efficiency and to the satisfaction of their superior officers''.
By adopting a total ban, the MoD had acted perversely and caused ''a
considerable quantity of misery'', he added.
He said the ban breached the European Convention on Human Rights and
contravened European Union law.
Air Chief Marshal Sir John Willis had suggested in evidence that there
were special reasons why a disciplined force needed to exclude all
homosexuals.
These included their potential adverse effect on morale and
efficiency, the problems of living in close proximity, and the fact that
the Forces act ''in loco parentis'', or as guardians, for the 35% of
recruits who were aged 18 and below the age of sexual consent.
Those arguments did not withstand objective scrutiny, said Mr Pannick.
''Other disciplined forces, such as the police in this country and the
armed forces of a large number of our allies, admit homosexuals without
any of the adverse consequence feared by the Ministry,'' he stressed.
''Indeed, as your lordships will see, the armed forces of this country
work alongside and together with homosexual servicemen and women from
other Nato countries and from Commonwealth forces without experiencing
any of the unsurpassable problems which so trouble the MoD.''
He said it was ''a profound irony'' to which the Air Chief Marshal
seemed completely oblivious that the institution of the armed forces,
which existed to preserve the liberties of the British public against
potential enemies, ''should tell the courts that it can only perform its
role by adopting a policy which denies the liberties of one section of
the population''.
The hearing continues.

A REPORT on how to boost the country's economy by developing
enterprise in education was launched yesterday by CBI Scotland, at what
was described as a unique and historical moment in Scottish politics.
The report, which is part of CBI Scotland's Scottish Business Agenda
and is aimed at ''igniting the spark that creates wealth'', has received
the backing of all four main political parties.
It was compiled by a group set up by CBI Scotland, which includes
among its members Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish
Conservative and Unionist Association, Mr George Robertson, the Scottish
Labour Party leader, Mr Fergus Ewing, the SNP business spokesman, and Mr
Jim Wallace, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats.
The group, which is chaired by Charles Skene OBE, an Aberdeen
businessman, includes leading educationalists and Mr Russell Griggs,
Scottish Enterprise's director of business development.
The aim of its report is to foster a ''can do'' approach in Scottish
youngsters and forge stronger links between educational and skill
attainment and the personal qualities of enterprise, drive, and
commitment.
Some of its key recommendations are that:
* All schools in Scotland should offer an education that promotes the
values underlying economic growth, prosperity, and civic responsibility.
* The values underlying economic growth and enterprising behaviour in
young people should be taught in all teacher training colleges.
* Mini and Young Enterprise schemes should be encouraged at all stages
in Scottish schools, preferably annually.
* HM Inspectors of Schools should assess enterprise activity.
* CBI Scotland should encourage more members to sponsor
enterprise-related developments in schools and universities.
* The business community should become more actively involved in the
promotion of enterprise in schools.
Mr John Ward, chairman of CBI Scotland, said: ''This report represents
a unique political consensus on the need for, and the promotion of,
enterprise and CBI Scotland is delighted to have led the way.
''I pay tribute to the politicians for coming together to support this
exciting initiative.''
Mr Robertson later described it as a significant occasion ''when the
leaders of the Scottish political parties who spend a lot of time at war
are saying exactly the same thing about something that is very important
for the future of Scotland''.
He added that he would be drawing the attention of the new Labour
councils to the recommendations and hoped that the business community
would also respond.
Mr Hirst said: ''I believe it is vitally important that the spirit and
ethos of enterprise is brought into education from the earliest possible
stage and I think the agenda document is something which, given that it
has political consensus behind it, can, I hope, quickly be implemented
in Scotland.''

Kamiku Isshiki, Japan, Tuesday,
JAPANESE police today arrested doomsday cult leader Shoko Asahara at
the sect's headquarters in this village at the foot of Mount Fuji.
''Police have arrested Chizuo Matsumoto, known as Shoko Asahara,''
Tokyo Police Superintendent Yukihiko Inoue told a nationally televised
news conference.
Japanese television stations said Asahara had been taken to a police
car clad in a white hooded garment.
Earlier police had named him as being responsible for the Tokyo subway
gas attack and staged massive raids and followers of his Apocalyptic
cult on suspicion of murder.
Exactly eight weeks after the March 20 sarin nerve-gas attack which
killed 12 and injured more than 5000, police sought to wrap up Japan's
worst case of mass violence since the Second World War.
Thousands of police raided 130 locations throughout Japan in a
co-ordinated operation which included cult headquarters where Aum Shinri
Kyo (Supreme Truth) leader Shoko Asahara had been in hiding.
Four hours after the raids started it was announced the cult leader
had been arrested.
The complex is called the Sixth Satian, after the Sanskrit term for
''truth.''
Police had entered the complex several times in the past, but were
unable to penetrate its warren of secret rooms and corridors.
Carrying caged canaries in case of lethal fumes and with gas masks
strapped to their waists, police cut their way with a circular saw
through a steel door on the first floor of a three-storey building which
was Asahara's living quarters.
Early in the raid around 10 sect members were led from the building.
Late last night a Tokyo court for the first time formally linked the
sect to the attack when it granted police warrants to arrest Asahara and
40 key followers.
Police evidence said they either released the gas or helped produce it
over a two-year period that included experiments on a sheep farm in
Australia and purchase of equipment and chemicals from a number of
countries, including Russia.
''Police believe Asahara gave instructions to members at each stage of
the production of sarin and the subway attack,'' Kyodo news agency
reported.
Warrants were issued 12 hours after police made a key breakthrough by
arresting Yoshihiro Inoue, ''intelligence minister'' of the sect, when
his car was stopped at a roadblock.
Police believe the 25-year-old high school drop-out and karate expert
masterminded the attack, commanding five two-man units that released
sarin nerve gas into the subway system.
Inoue tried to escape and police only realised his identity when his
fingerprints were examined.
He had dyed his hair brown and shaved off his moustache.
Inoue was a fiercely loyal follower of the Aum founder and regarded as
the guru's ''enforcer''. Even before the subway attack he was wanted for
tracking down and abducting sect members who tried to break away from
the cult.
His arrest cleared the way for police to move against the cult's
headquarters.
While Inoue was at large, police feared revenge attacks if they
arrested Asahara, who has forecast the world will end in an
Armageddon-type war in 1997.
''This is very good. He must know a lot,'' said chief government
spokesman Kozo Igarashi who has borne the brunt of questioning about why
it has taken so long to solve the case.
Police believe 10 people under Inoue's command carried out the attack
and 30 were directly involved in producing the gas.
A new security scare tempered elation at the developments when 20
people were overcome by fumes in a subway station in Yokohama, a port
city close to Tokyo last night.
Doctors said the victims were not seriously ill and there was no
indication the fumes were linked to previous attacks.--Reuter.

BRITISH Gas is to revise its treatment of traders affected by works
carried out on their doorsteps, Mr Eggar told the Commons.
Chairman Richard Giordano also has signalled the possibility of
compensation to affected firms in limited circumstances.
He was responding to Tory demands that British Gas should be legally
obliged to compensate traders who lost business because of works being
carried on outside their premises.
Mr Eggar said: ''Subject to certain conditions, British Gas has
undertaken that in those exceptional cases where businesses with less
than #500,000 turnover -- about 90% of businesses in the UK -- have a
severe and clearly established loss of business for more than a month as
a direct result of street works carried out by British Gas or its
agents, then British Gas will give sympathetic consideration to claims
in respect of financial loss on an ex-gratia basis.''
Tory Richard Shepherd (Aldridge Brownhills) said small firms were
''fed up to the teeth with the arrogance and often incomprehensible way
in which these utility companies treat consumers and businesses''.

A FORMER soldier who was responsible for a hostage scare in Aviemore
Health Centre last month was ordered to carry out community service when
he appeared at Inverness Sheriff Court yesterday.
Frightened staff were evacuated by police after 40-year-old John
Gartshore brandished a handgun in the centre on April 24.
One woman on an upstairs floor could not be reached as armed officers
surrounded the building.
Depute-fiscal Eileen MacInnes said Gartshore's actions had led police
to believe they were dealing with a serious firearm incident, with a
woman trapped upstairs in the building. However, she said, the weapon
was a Browning replica pistol, containing eight dummy bullets.
Gartshore had carried the gun tied to a trouser belt but frequently
brandished it in the centre. On one occasion, he had slammed it down on
a bin, she said.
The court heard that when police arrived at the centre, they were met
by a distressed nurse running along a corridor, who shouted to them:
''He has got a gun with eight people up the spout!''
Police had earlier been searching for Gartshore after reports that he
had been acting in an agitated manner in Aviemore, the court heard. He
had a cut on his face, which a witness had told police was self
inflicted.
Gartshore, of Milton Park, Aviemore, admitted disorderly conduct,
producing a replica pistol, placing staff in a state of fear and alarm,
and breaching the peace.
Defence agent, Mr Gordon Fleetwood, said Gartshore was sane and not in
need of psychiatric help, but said he had been under medication at the
time, and was in a confused state.
Gartshore was a former member of the Parachute Regiment and described
his time in the Army as the happiest in his life, the court heard.
Sheriff William Fulton ordered him to complete 220 hours community
service.

battled on the streets of Falkirk before Saturday's crunch game, Falkirk
Sheriff Court heard yesterday.
A bottle smashed through the window of the Kangaroo Club in the town's
High Street -- a favourite tea room for young mums out shopping with
their children.
Depute fiscal Alastair McSporran said the incident happened as a fight
involving Aberdeen fans was ''in full swing'' before the Brockville game
kicked off. Kevin Low, 26, of Donmouth Court, Bridge of Don, Aberdeen,
admitted throwing a bottle which broke the restaurant window.
Mr McSporran said: ''At least one of the small children was covered in
broken glass. The children and parents were very frightened.'' He said
it was fortunate no youngster was seriously injured.
Sheriff Andrew Murphy ordered Low to pay #600 compensation to the
restaurant.
The court heard earlier that three other Dons' fans were arrested by
undercover policemen -- part of a major police operation for the game.
Christopher Hardy, 21, of Craigpark Circle, Ellon, Aberdeenshire, was
fined #175 for breach of the peace and ''struggling violently'' with
police.
Mr McSporran said police spotted Hardy -- who was part of a gang of 60
-- launch an unprovoked attack on a young man in the street.
Two plain-clothes policemen arrested Hardy, which set Aberdeen thugs
fighting with ''totally innocent people'' in the street, said the
fiscal.
James Milne, 24, of Bridge St, Ellon, was fined #375 on four charges,
including breach of the peace and struggling with police as he tried to
help Hardy to escape.
Scott Robertson, 22, of Bruce Crescent, Ellon, was fined #100 for a
breach of the peace during the same incident.
John Cameron, 21, of North Peffer Place, Edinburgh, a weapons engineer
in the Royal Navy, was fined #150 for a breach of the peace and inciting
others to fight.
Another fan was fined #150 for letting off a firework in the crowded
car park after the match.
The court heard that Steven Kain, 24, of Allan St, Aberdeen, was
''celebrating a great result for his team''.
All the accused pled guilty but denied being ''casuals''.

LAND Rover is to create 400 jobs because of growing world-wide sales.
Recruitment will begin immediately at the company's factory in Solihull,
West Midlands, where the workforce will grow to 11,000 by the summer.
More than 2000 extra workers have been taken on over the past year
because of the success of Land Rover's Discovery model.
Managing director Ian Robertson said worldwide sales were up by more
than 50% so far this year, with 5235 vehicles sold in the US compared
with 1857 in the same period in 1994.

A BRISTOL man is in John o'Groats today, celebrating a record-breaking
dash from Land's End to the Caithness town.
Mr Richard Brown, 49, finished the 900 miles run yesterday in 10 days
and two-and-a-half hours, 13 hours quicker than the previous record
holder, Scotsman Don Ritchie.
His wife, Sandra, 46, a financial adviser to Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke, is also running the ''ultra distance'' race and is expected to
arrive today, breaking the women's record by around two days.
Mr Brown dubbed his epic race The Gump Run after the film Forrest
Gump, in which the main character ran across the United States.
Speaking from John o'Groats, Mr Brown said: ''I must still be on a
high because I don't feel tired. My only plans now are to have a bottle
of champagne and a bath.''
Mr Brown, a development agency manager, said the money raised from the
run would be donated to the charity Sport Aiding Medical Research for
Kids.

Michael Ross finds classroom thinking being turning towards
communities of enquiry
AFTER graduating with a philosophy degree almost 20 years ago and
going into teaching I attempted to introduce the topic in a light
hearted sort of fashion with my middle and upper primary classes.
It was not a success. I found that the children had not responded with
the same sense of awe and excitement which I had experienced during my
introduction to the topic at school when a substitute member of staff
filled in for our absent physics teacher.
He chatted in general terms about the mind/body distinction which has
bedevilled philosophy for centuries, and in specific terms he discussed
the philosopical point of view of Rene Descartes who certainly featured
this topic predominately in his philosophical works.
I can remember the sense of ''awe'' I experienced to this day. The
whole world of philosophical speculation was revealed and I was
determined to study as much of it as possible in future years.
It had always puzzled me as to how I had not succeeded in stimulating
the same sense of excitement with my own children. Of course a one-off
lesson dealing with a fresh subject always has the potential of ''waking
up'' an impressionable youngster but I gradually became convinced that
the debating style I was using with my own was all wrong. Something
else, unconnected to this aspect of education, was deeply problematic.
The 5 to 14 programme emphasises the capacity of the child to
investigate themes independently and to attempt problem solving
throughout the curriculum. This is all very well but, as Wittgenstein
and many other philosphers have suggested, the art of asking the proper
questions is quite a difficult process in itself.
In my experience children are not capable or experienced in this sort
of thing.
To be capable of asking questions is a skill which has to be practised
and developed over a period of time. Science, technology, and the
liberal arts all benefit from practitioners being able to ask and
develop the proper questions concerning a particular avenue of
exploration.
Accordingly, I looked around for a solution and found it in the work
of Matt Lipmann's Philosophy for Children programme which is used in
more than 5000 schools in the US and is slowly being introduced here.
Lipmann's ''P4C'' methodology works like this: The teacher uses a
text, a short story written by Lipmann (a former Professor of
Philosophy) for various age ranges of pupils. At my own stage
(10-year-olds) I have used Harry Stottlemeir's Discovery, the thought
adventures of an American child.
Each book in Lipmann's range has different chapters dealing with
various philosophical/critical thinking areas which can be dipped into
depending on the ''thinking skill'' which the teacher wishes to develop.
As Lipmann says encouragingly: ''No one ever finishes the book with a
class,'' and this sort of approach is certainly advantageous to the
hard-pressed classroom teacher who might merely, at least at the initial
stage, dip into this style of teaching.
The methodology consists of reading the small chapter and teasing out
questions which have arisen from the text. The children then decide
which question to discuss at length by taking a democratic vote. Every
question must be valued, of course, and can be kept for future
discussion at a later stage.
The children then decide on a set of rules for discussion, whereby
mutual tolerance and the capacity to listen to a point of view which you
might vehemently disagree with is practised.
The whole theory behind this is to develop a ''Community of Enquiry''
whereby a democratic exchange of views will be of assistance in
developing the individual's mind and appreciation of democratic norms
within a community setting.
Now this may at the outset seem to be rather obvious and even ''twee''
and, on first reading, I immediately wondered what was so special about
yet another imported theory from the US -- many of whose educational
reforms we might have had cause to regret exploring in the past.
Fortunately, I decided to explore Lipmann's methods by attending
workshops organised by the Society for the Advancement of Philosophical
Enquiry and Reflection in Education, which is attempting to build up
interest in Lipmann's methods in Britain.
I found the setting up of a Community of Enquiry, which is the whole
basis of these workshops, a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable -- even
liberating -- process.
When you get all sorts of adults from widely diverse disciplines and
experiences in the educational world attempting to use this community
enquiry it is shameful to realise how little practise we have in
developing such a mutual tolerance of one another's points of view.
Lipmann's methods have the advantage of actually involving teachers
and children in a process which values the development of thinking
skills and a sense of community in a very real, and what is
overwhelmingly important, a living process.
Various claims have been made following research in the US that
comprehension/reading skills have increased by up to 60% and
numerical/mathematical abilities by more than 40% using Lipmann's
methods.
There is no greater cynic than myself when ''new ideas'' crop up in
education. But we teachers need to have more opportunities for
pleasurable and beneficial teaching. I would suggest exploring the
Lipmann avenue.

FORMER Lord Provost Alex Collie who has served Aberdeen for almost
half a century is to be made a freeman of the city of his birth, joining
the likes of Nelson Mandela, President Gorbachev, and Sir Dugald and
Lady Baird.
Aberdeen District Council's policy committee yesterday decided to
confer the honour on the 81-year-old former baker who is the only past
lord provost and the first serving councillor to receive the honour. The
ceremony is likely to take place in the autumn.
Councillor Collie will retire next April when the new unitary
authorities take control. By then he will have served ''Fittie''
(Footdee) for 49 years.
Putting forward the nomination, Lord Provost James Wyness said he
could think of no more deserving person throughout the United Kingdom to
receive the honour than Councillor Alex Collie, who has spent his adult
life serving the residents of Aberdeen.
Councillor Collie was Lord Provost from 1980 to 1984 and served many
years as convener of the links and parks committee when Aberdeen won the
Britain in Bloom title so often they were banned from entering.
The announcement of the honour may provide a boost to Aberdeen
Football Club because Councillor Collie's period as lord provost also
coincided with their most successful years.

The sweaters laid out on the ping-pong table are hand-knitted and
unique in every way. Each has been carefully crafted from wool
hand-spun from a single fleece. And each is the result of a remarkable
collaboration between an
Orkney farmer and a Parisian fashion designer.
Stephane Jaeger grew up surrounded by French fine art; her
father owned a gallery in Paris.
She exchanged that world for a sheep farm on the island of Burray run
by her partner, George Rouse.
It was here that he tried crossing hardy Shetland sheep with
appropriately-named Blue-Faced Leicesters. The result was a fleece
that was beautiful to look at, but which earned him a pittance when sold
the traditional way to the Wool Marketing Board.
'A lot of the fleeces were black which is not a good colour to sell,'
Stephane said. 'So that's what started me off. We had this wonderful
wool, we needed to diversify into a new farming enterprise and, of
course, I wanted
to make money.'
Her solution was to take an individual fleece, carefully hand-spin the
wool and produce a garment that was both unique and unrepeatable.
'No fleece is the same, each has its own mix of flecks and strands in
browns, greens and yellows,' she said. 'This means that each garment is
completely different.'
While it also ensures that Stephane can command premium prices for
her knitwear, there is nothing fancy about the way she sells the
garments.
Many are bought by visitors to Littlequoy  Farm who, more often than
not, are charmed to find sweaters of exceptional quality laid out on the
table-tennis table used by the couple's children.
'It is a very useful table!' said Stephane. 'Many people enjoy coming
here, having a cup of coffee, seeing the strange-looking sheep and
taking a walk along our shores.'
Most of the inspiration for the designs come from the fleeces
themselves, with a huge dash of Stephane's own Parisian style.
'I tend towards classical design. I like fairly simple shapes and want
it to look smart and understated, rather than over-the-top garish.'
Stephane produces a range of garments from waistcoats to socks and
scarfs, as well as two types of jumpers - one hand-knitted using
commercially spun wool, the other using the hand-spun fleeces.
'I first design the jumper and knit it, then I make up a pattern for
the hand-knitters to follow. We employ 50 to 60 out workers in
Orkney and throughout Scotland at the moment,' she said.
Even so, she produces just 80 to 100 hand-spun jumpers a year,
and around 200 of the hand-knitted variety which find there way to
most corners of the world.
In Japan her work is admired so much that she has been invited
there  to demonstrate her techniques later this year.
Although she is the only one in her family to have left French soil,
Stephane feels that she has found the perfect balance of creativity
and contentment.
'I suppose I am considered odd - possibly the black sheep - which is
very appropriate especially in view of the fleeces we produce!'

Dick Louden reports on the developing cold war in Scottish classrooms
over curricular changes
ALL seems quiet on the education front. The 5-14 Programme is moving
gently ahead, and the national working groups preparing for Higher Still
are continuing to plan for an implementation date of August 1997.
However, this could be a case where appearances prove to be deceptive.
The Scottish National Party takes the view that Higher Still will
adversely affect the breadth of the curriculum, and the SNP
administration in Tayside region is refusing to cooperate in the
planning process. In addition, a workload campaign initiated a year ago
by the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), after a ballot on
industrial action, is still around and does not look like going away.
Indeed, because of the workload campaign, it can be argued that there
is now a ''stand-off'' situation in Scottish education in which many
teachers are not implementing curricular changes and the Scottish Office
and local authorities are more or less turning a blind eye.
The EIS originally envisaged that the workload campaign could be
relaxed when its policy on ''no new developments'' was subsumed into
workload agreements at regional level. This occurred in Highland region
and in Strathclyde, where a package of measures to combat teacher
overload has just been agreed.
In the 10 remaining education authorities, there appears to be no
urgency to tackle the issue. This is not surprising, since councils
about to be broken up under local government reform will hardly see a
confrontation with the EIS as a priority. Local EIS negotiators are
quick to appreciate that this has the advantage of leaving their ''no
new developments'' approach firmly in place.
Though well aware of what is happening, the Scottish Office has done
little to intervene. Publicly at least, it is working on the assumption
that the timetables for 5-14, Higher Still, and Devolved School
Management are being maintained. It is applying little pressure to
schools over either national testing or teacher appraisal. Indeed, the
recent round of education cuts has led to the specific
''deprioritisation'' of appraisal in Lothian region and this has not
been openly challenged.
The implications are potentially more serious than has been realised.
David McGinty, EIS regional secretary in Grampian, describes the region
as ''supportive of the 'no new developments' policy'' and claims that
''within the proposed timescale and existing resources, it is impossible
to implement Higher Still in Grampian. With the introduction of the new
Level F for the most able, the dangers of fast-tracking are considerable
-- it is a case of the tail wagging the dog. If we are forced into
Higher Still, there will be a deterioration in the quality of
educational provision as teachers adopt a cynical conformity to an
imposed timescale.''
He also highlights the issue of resources. ''With Grampian
disaggregating, there are already hints that revenue budgets for 1996-97
will be smaller. Higher Still could collapse because councils are
struggling to balance budgets. With possible cuts in areas like learning
support, they may not be able to provide enough in-service training and
funding for materials. We must have an agreement on resources before
Grampian comes to an end. We have been too long in the game of keeping
down budgets and keeping up appearances.''
In the meantime, David McGinty describes the breathing space as most
welcome. ''Pupils,'' he says, ''are no longer being subjected to
teachers coming in half frazzled. The gap has allowed them to step back
and get a grip on 5-14 at a manageable pace.''
These views are echoed by Drew Morrice, EIS regional convener in
Strathclyde. Praising the new Strathclyde workload review as ''a
thorough piece of work,'' he argues that development has never been
properly resourced. ''This is a time for consolidating rather than
innovating, for teachers to have more control. They can no longer be
expected to teach plus innovate.''
Higher Still and 5-14 cannot be taken for granted. According to Drew
Morrice: ''The message of the Strathclyde review is one of
consolidation. The 5-14 intiative cannot be delivered as it stands.
There are too many issues which have to be tackled -- for example,
recording, reporting, and assessment are too demanding. There is a need
to stand back and develop good models of reporting. Schools will be in
no hurry to implement the rest of 5-14.''
His line on Higher Still is equally strong. ''Our earlier agreement
with Strathclyde ring-fenced Higher Still. It never raised its head
within the workload review team. None of the recommendations in the
report seek to amend the position on Higher Still.''
Nationally, the EIS is boycotting Higher Still and has refused to
nominate members to take part in the various development working
parties. This is not deterring the Scottish Office from pushing ahead
and a range of policy documents will be issued for consultation within
the profession over the next few months. Nevertheless, there appears to
be no strategy for bringing the sides together and it would be unwise of
the Scottish Office to assume that parental opinion will bring the EIS
meekly into line. The longer the present impasse continues, the more
likely it becomes that the implementation date of August 1997 can no
longer be regarded as sacrosanct.
The situation with 5-14 is, in a sense, even more pressing since the
programme is already under way. English and mathematics were implemented
even before the EIS workload campaign began in May 1994 but since then
relatively few schools have embarked on environmental studies,
expressive arts and religious and moral education, and old syllabuses
are widely continuing to be delivered in these areas. The Scottish
Office's timetable, aiming at full implementation by 1999, is looking
ever more unrealistic.
Since the shelf life of an unimplemented curricular reform tends to be
of very finite duration, it may not be stretching the bounds of
pessimism to wonder if 5-14 will ever be put fully into effect.

As pupils get down to final revision before sitting their SCE's this
month John Greenlees reports on the very testing times in Japanese
schools
' Fifteen hours of study a day means pass, while 14 hours means fail '
Teachers' reminder to students
JUKEN Jigoku is how many of Japan's 10,000,000 teenagers describe
their country's education system. It translates as Examination Hell and
highlights the prominent role of exams in what is one of the world's
most demanding and stress-inducing education systems.
As soon as they enter junior high school, at age 12, pupils begin
their preparations for the exams that will determine what sort of senior
high school they can attend.
Admission to a top academic senior high school, at age 16, is a
crucial step for the millions of students who want to sit the entrance
exams which are set by colleges and universities.
A degree from a prestigious university, in a society that pays
considerable attention to academic credentials, is the passport to a
fast-track career and a life in the upper echelons of Japan's
meritocratic society.
Entrance exams are also set by private kindergartens and elementary
schools, which offer to improve pupils' chances of winning places at
popular and highly-ranked junior high schools.
Such is the competition for places at top schools and universities
that some parents enrol children as young as two or three at the
privately-run early learning centres which help to prepare pupils for
the many important exams they will encounter in their future schooling.
''Young people's success in education is decided by their ability to
pass exams,'' says teacher Tadayoshi Kato.
At the same time the effectiveness of schools, and the teachers they
employ, is determined by the number of students they help to pass high
school or university entrance exams.
Newpapers and magazines periodically publish detailed lists of schools
which help the most pupils pass the entrance exams of leading high
schools and universities.
With so much at stake considerable amounts of teaching time are
devoted to revision courses, mock tests and other exam preparatory work.
The knowledge-based nature of the exams, moreover, encourages
traditional teaching methods including large amounts of rote learning
and memory work. The development of creative and analytical thinking
skills, which are not tested by the exams, is neglected.
The compulsory foreign language components of high school and
university exams, for example, only test reading and writing skills. The
absence of an oral test means that teachers do not devote a lot of
classroom time to the development of speaking skills.
The result is that many Japanese students are highly competent at
reading and writing foreign languages but very poor at speaking them.
''Japanese schools'' admits Tadayoshi Kato, ''are nothing more than
factories for helping students pass exams. An appreciation of school and
learning is hindered by the constant pressure on students to pass
exams.''
But the obsession with exams and testing has been highly beneficial to
Japan's multi-billion pound cramming school and ''study aids'' business.
To gain an edge in the exam war, over half the country's high school
students enrol for additional lessons at after-school crammers.
Students at crammers like the Tokyo-based Yoyogi Seminar have the
opportunity to sit mock exams every week and then have their
performances marked and analysed by computers.
Counsellors are employed to advise students and to suggest strategies
for improving their marks.
Students who fail to win places at the universities of their choice
often spend an entire year, or more, at special cramming schools called
''yobikos'' preparing for the next round of entrance exams.
Memory aids such as ''learning by ear'' audio tapes, which fit into
personal stereos, are popular with students who want to cram more facts
while travelling to and from school.
An enterprising publisher has even produced a range of waterproof
revision books for students who want to cram information while soaking
in their baths.
Some cramming schools operate a network of video libraries, featuring
thousands of different lectures, to enable students to receive
additional tuition at home.
The combination of a long school day, after-school cramming lessons
and hours of homework means that students preparing for important exams
are spending up to 15 hours a day in front of books.
During the months leading up to important exams teachers remind
students that, ''15 hours of study a day means pass, while 14 hours
means fail''.
Before sitting university entrance exams, which are usually taken in
large cities like Tokya and Osaka, students can book into one of the
hotels which offer special ''relax-rooms'' designed to help candidates
settle their pre-exam nerves.
The New Otani Hotel in Tokyo offers a ''refresh room'' which a ''body
sonic'' chair which vibrates in time with the music from an accompanying
laser disc player.
Some clubs offer special pre-exam karaoke nights for students who want
to try and enjoy themselves before sitting their exams.
But the obsession with exams has a deadly serious side for tens of
thousands of young Japanese. The intense pressure to perform well in
exams has produced a high incidence of stress-related illnesses among
Japanese teenagers.
Other students develop mental or personality problems while teenage
suicides, involving youngsters who are depressed because of poor exam
results, continue to shock the nation.
Exam pressures are also blamed for the rising level of truancy at
Japanese high schools and for the increasing number of high school
dropouts.
Students who make it to university are often so exhausted that they
treat their higher education as a four-year vacation. The lack of
achievement in Japanese colleges and universities is one of Japan's most
pressing educational problems.
A growing number of educationists believe that an end to the dominant
influence of exams will help to instil a greater love of learning and
encourage the development of the sort of creative and analytical
thinkers the country needs.
But there is considerable opposition to radical change from the
private schools and crammers which derive a large part of their incomes
from exam tuition and exam fees.
Other supporters of Japan's exam-dominated education system, including
many of the leading politicians and bureaucrats who benefited from the
existing structure, argue that exams encourage the sort of hard work and
perserverence which helped Japan become a successful industrial
superpower.

Barbara Mackenzie discovers a globally successful restaurant chain
built on one-to-one training methods and a Sinatra classic
AGLASGOW restaurant, with sister branches all over the world, puts its
success down to strict business discipline, personal on-the-job
training, and a commitment to its own management development.
Chicago Meatpackers, in Hope Street, is part of My Kinda Town plc -- a
multi-brand theme restaurant group operating across three continents.
The group opened its first European restaurant, the Chicago Pizza Pie
Factory, 18 years ago in London. Its other outlets are Chicago Rib
Shack, Henry J Bean's Bar and Grill, Tacos -- which specialises in
Mexican food, and The Criterion, serving Californian and Italian dishes.
Aileen Moodie, 30, has been general manager of Chicago Meatpackers for
almost two years, after completing her initial training in London. She
has overall responsibility for running the restaurant, the only one of
its kind in Britain. The job involves budgeting, recruitment and staff
training, marketing and promotion.
She says: ''I enjoy the freedom and the responsibility. It is like
having my own business. I am allowed to develop it and change things and
I get so much back.''
Based on a successful American model, the training is done on a
one-to-one basis and covers fundamental facets of the business such as
corporate structure, health and safety, and menu provision. Aileen
explains: ''At each stage, the new recruits shadow experienced members
of staff who are responsible for their training. Before they can
progress to the next stage, they have to pass both a practical test and
a written examination in which they might be asked to list the
directors, note down the ingredients of specific dishes, and state the
whereabouts of the fire extinguishers.''
She adds: ''It is unusual to find one-to-one training in this field
but it is productive. It puts the onus on the individual to learn and
you end up with better trained staff who have much more confidence
dealing with customers.''
Career progression is structured, and graduate training leading to a
position of responsibility, such as duty manager, lasts about six months
and begins in the kitchen. Progress is reviewed each month by the
appropriate department manager. Aileen says: ''The company's philosophy
is that you must know every single job and be able to do it as well as
any member of staff. So, even as a trainee manager, you have to do the
dishes and you are assessed all the time by the department's head. It
gives you total appreciation of what your staff have to go through.''
Bussing comes next, which, for the uninitiated, means undertaking the
routine tasks of clearing and setting tables, serving sauces and
shadowing waiters. Then comes wait training, where you learn to carry
trays over your head and to cope with the customers.
Front-of-house training follows and this includes greeting and seating
customers and crowd control. When this is completed you learn the
rudiments of bar work, starting during quieter periods and progressing
to busy nights.
The practical assessment involves serving a meal and drinks to a
senior member of staff, usually a director or general manager. He or she
evaluates your manner, personality and service. A re-sit is allowed if
you fail but only if potential is seen to be there. On successful
completion of the training you are promoted to a managerial position.
After one or two years at duty management level, progression can be
made to assistant general manager, number two in the hierarchy with
special responsibilities for the food and beverage departments. This
position is seen as preparatory for the top job of general manager.
Short-term objectives are agreed to improve technical skills and
managerial expertise. Off-the-job training sessions are arranged and
these included person management, interviewing techniques, finance,
training skills, and employment law. Staff are encouraged to work their
way up.
Aileen has been in this line of work for almost nine years and is
currently in charge of 40 staff at the Glasgow restaurant. She outlines
some of the qualities required in new recruits: ''They should have
outgoing personalities, good communication skills, be team players, and
smile a lot, even under pressure.''
One of the advantages of working for a company which has outlets all
over the world is that employees have the chance to travel abroad if
they wish. One of the managers, Glasgow-born Douglas Smillie, has done
just that. He joined the company 10 years ago and has worked in
Scotland, London, Paris and Spain. He now has responsibility for all the
franchise operations and last year opened restaurants in Thailand and
Argentina.
Douglas already possessed language skills but the company will pay for
tuition if necessary. Aileen admits a desire to travel. ''I love my work
but going abroad would bring extra excitement to the job. I would like
to do it just for the experience of a different culture, a different way
of life,'' she added.

THE head teacher of an Aberdeen school for youngsters with behavioural
difficulties, which was severely criticised by HM Inspectors, yesterday
blamed lack of finances for its problems.
Inspectors investigated Oakbank School after a series of allegations
by former staff in 1993 that excessive physical restraint was being
used.
Mr Ron McKail, the headmaster, said the inspectors' report was simply
a ''snapshot'' at a time when there were particular difficulties because
of a larger than normal number of disruptive pupils.
''We admitted into the school a larger number of children than normal
whose behaviour was difficult to manage. They were a small number but
they had considerable influence on what was happening within our
education department,'' he said.
Mr McKail added that the school currently received #694 per child per
week but needed #900 per child to run effectively.
0 ''What the board of governors have been attempting to do for some
time is obtain further resources so that we can do our job.'' He said
that, because of lack of funding, it was unable to employ the staff
required to fulfil the recommendations of the inspectors' report.
Particularly problematic children had now been returned to their local
authorities, who would have placed them in children's homes and in some
cases in secure accommodation.
Councillor Jim Towers, SNP Grampian regional councillor and chairman
of the Oakbank board of governors, said there was confusion on the part
of the staff after a report by a social work sub-committee which had
investigated the school after the allegations by former staff.
''They seemed to be saying that the sanctions we were using to control
difficult behaviour were inappropriate, and there was a lot of concern
stemming from unfounded allegations made 18 months ago that excessive
physical restraint was being used.
''The staff appeared to be told that no physical restraint could be
used at all, and they were rather confused. We have gone into the issue
of physical restraint and we intend to use it as a last resort when
children need to be restrained, either for their own safety or to
prevent them from hurting other children. The advice from the social
work investigation committee was perhaps inappropriate at that time.''
The board was seeking to reduce the number of children for which the
school was registered. It was currently registered for 66 but operated
with 56. The board wanted to introduce a phased reduction to 42.
''If we had the resources, we could be a much more effective
establishment and could prevent a number of children being placed in
secure accommodation.''
Councillor Towers said he had long been pressing the gional council to
increase funding, which was currently adequate for the care side only
and was inadequate as far as education was concerned.
Last night, Councillor Janetta Anderson, chairman of Grampian social
work committee, rejected the headmaster's suggestions.

Few islands can boast a more lovely landfall than Shapinsay.
After a 25 minute crossing, the ferry from Kirkwall passes beneath
the Victorian turrets of Balfour Castle before docking close to a
village of neat cottages built for nineteenth-century estate workers.
The castle was once the home of Colonel David Balfour, who pioneered
agricultural methods that made Shapinsay among the most productive of
Orkney's islands. Today it is owned by the Zawadzki (corr) family and
plays host to guests who pay handsomely for the privilege of taking part
in a very modern farming initiative.
Richard Zawadzki, who runs the adjoining Balfour Mains farm, has won
major awards for a form of diversification which combines farming and
conservation.
'We offer small groups of friends a week's shooting for ducks and
geese as well as pheasants and snipe,' he said. 'It's an absolutely
unique experience. They stay in the castle where they are treated as
house guests and the shooting is done on small, uninhabited islands.
Many of them have become friends and return year after year, even though
they are expected to lie on their backs, covered in seaweed out on the
islands - and pay 100 pounds a day for the privilege.'
To ensure there is a wealth of wildfowl for the shoot, Richard
rears 500 ducks each year and has created 15 ponds together with areas
of marsh land on the 840 acre farm.
'This benefits a wie range of wildlife and has encouraged many bird
species to breed,' he said.
'I can quite confidently say that there are more birds per acre here
than on any other farmland in Shapinsay because of the way we manage
the estate.'
Three miles up the road from Balfour village is the small farm where
former civil servant Jock Bell and his wife Hattie planned to spend a
quiet retirement. But far from putting their feet up, the couple are
supplying as much goats' cheese as they can turn out to high quality
outlets in Scotland
and London.
'Hattie had her heart set on keeping a goat when we moved up here,'
said Jock Bell. And in the event our first goat arrived before any of
our furniture.'
It was Hattie who started experimenting with cheese making and was
soon selling some to friends and a shop in Kirkwall.
'A couple of people called one day and asked to try some cheese,' she
said. 'I thought they were tourists and dutifully showed them the
spare
bedroom where I was making cheese on two breeze blocks and an old
cooker.'
'It was then that they told me they were buyers from Neal's Yard
Dairy in Covent Garden - I just wanted the ground to open and swallow
me up.'
Despite Hattie's embarrassment, the buyers were so impressed that
they ordered as much cheese as the couple could produce for the
prestigious London shop.
Today they keep 24 pedigree milking goats and have built a dairy that
meets the most stringent European health regulations.
'The goats all have names and we know their individual preferences and
treat them like members of the family,' added Mrs Bell. We're aiming to
produce 40 lbs of cheese a day this summer - and we'll still be
struggling to keep up with the demand.'

<HEADLINE>Clinic opens to advise teenagers on sex issues</HEADLINE>

NEW figures showing the high level of teenage sexual activity in
Glasgow were disclosed yesterday at the launch of a new health clinic
for young people.
The Sexual Health Help (SHH) clinic will be based at the Community and
Mental Health Services centre in the city's Claremont Terrace.
It will be open specifically for teenagers on Saturday afternoons to
provide free contraception and confidential health advice for youngsters
who may not be seeking the help they need from their GP or family
planning clinic.
Senior health promotion officer Mr Andy Thornton said the centre would
address the concerns of young people.
He cited figures as yet unpublished by Greater Glasgow Health Board
(GGHB) to illustrate the high level of teenage sexual activity in
Glasgow. The findings from the survey of under-19s include:
* 85% claimed they were sexually active.
* 60% said they had had two or more partners.
* 10% claimed they had had 10 or more partners.
Mr Thornton added that almost one in three of 16-year-olds said they
were sexually active. There was a large discrepancy between the figures
for males and females, suggesting that males may exaggerate their sexual
history.
The figures -- significantly higher than those in similar surveys --
are contained in a draft health board report, which is due to be
published next month. It will also show that youngsters are more likely
to have sex and less likely to use contraception while intoxicated with
alcohol or drugs.
The Scottish Needs Assessment Programme report on teenage pregnancy --
published by the Scottish Office earlier this year -- found that 43% of
females aged 13-19 and more than 50% of males were sexually active. It
recommended that health boards provide appropriate services for young
people and led to the establishment of the SHH clinic.
The vice-chairman of GGHB, the Rev Roddy Campbell, launching the new
clinic, said schools were failing to meet the needs of children by not
providing effective sex education.
He added that the clinic would be a great success if it offered
sensible advice to allow teenagers to make informed choices.
His criticisms of current provison were echoed by Dr Alison Bigrigg,
clinical director of family planning and sexual health services in
Greater Glasgow. She said there was no other service specifically for
teenagers in Glasgow and, in general, Scotland was lagging behind
England and Wales.
''Sex education is important but there is some resistance among
headteachers. You are not going to stop young people having sex, which
is probably what some headteachers think.
''A lot of people wanted to get something like this clinic started but
it was a question of where and when. Young people have a right to make
informed decisions and not be subjected to peer group pressure in the
playground.
''At the SHH clinic, confidentiality is our byword and the atmosphere
will be relaxed and informal,'' she said.
The presenters of Scottish Television's music show Chartbite, Ewan
McLeod and Marie Steven, both 23, fronted the launch. Marie said: ''We
would have been grateful of a place like this when we were younger.''
Youth volunteers will help out at the clinic. A spokeswoman said they
would welcome youngsters by chatting and handing out drinks. She said:
''They are there to emphasise the informality of the clinic and to make
young people feel more at home. They won't be giving out medical advice
or counselling.''

<HEADLINE>Safety breach led to hopper accident</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978370776</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THREE men were cleaning a hopper with air-blast lances when tonnes of
coal poured down on them, a court heard yesterday.
One man was buried under 6ft of coal but was pulled out without
serious injury. The two others leapt clear.
He spent two hours in hospital and was back at work within 10 days,
Haddington Sheriff Court was told.
The accident, on October 1 last year, was said to be the first at
Cockenzie Power Station, East Lothian, in 27 years.
ScottishPower, of Atlantic Quay, Glasgow, admitted failing to ensure
the safety at work of three East Lothian employees: Mr John Brown, of
Castle Walk, Port Seton; Mr Francis Johnstone, of Amisfield Court,
Macmerry; and Mr Stuart Kerr, of Muirside Drive, Tranent.
The company admitted the men were removing a build-up of coal in No 4
Hopper at Cockenzie Power Station in unsafe circumstances and that coal
collapsed on to Mr Brown to his injury and danger of his life.
Mr Brown returned to work two weeks after the incident.
Depute fiscal Joan Arnott said one of the 250-tonne hoppers was being
cleaned out in preparation for replacement of a new top grid.
Unknown to management engineers, there had been a large build-up of
coal on the sides of the hopper.
''Over the years, the build-up of coal had created a 26ft high stack
4ft thick against the wall of the hopper. Workmen were sent in to the
bottom of the hopper to clear it,'' she said.
Mrs Arnott said the accident had been the result of poor internal
communications by management about working in ''substantial risk''
areas.
Defence solicitor, Mr David L Stevenson, said ScottishPower were
''entirely embarrassed'' by the incident as they operated a safe system
at work. He claimed it was the first accident at Cockenzie since it
opened in 1968.
Sheriff George Presslie said the lives of the three workmen had been
put at substantial risk.
He fined ScottishPower #7500.

THE poorest grades yet for the quality of teaching and learning in
universities and colleges have been handed out by the Scottish Higher
Education Funding Council.
The overall quality assessment results for business and management
courses -- which account for about one in five students in higher
education -- contrast sharply with the performance in music, the other
subject area scrutinised in the latest set of reports from the council.
Only Strathclyde University in Glasgow received the top ''excellent''
grade for business and management. Of the 12 remaining institutions
offering these courses, five received the second highest grade --
''highly satisfactory'' -- while the remaining seven secured the third
rating, ''satisfactory''.
No institution was given the bottom ''unsatisfactory'' grade. However,
leading businessman, Dr Chris Masters, chairman of the council's quality
assessment committee, said yesterday: ''The results for business and
management are somewhat disappointing in that, although Strathclyde
University was rated excellent, the overall results across the sector
are poorer than those we have published so far in other areas.
''This is of particular concern, given the vital role business and
management has to play in supporting, and indeed improving, the
competitiveness of the Scottish economy,'' said Dr Masters, chief
executive of distribution and plant hire group Christian Salvesen.
He was confident, however, that the quality assessment exercise --
which has to date led to 120 reports covering 13 subject areas -- would
lead to improvements.
Of the four institutions offering music, one -- the Royal Scottish
Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow -- was rated ''excellent'', two
others were given ''highly satisfactory'' grades and one was deemed
''satisfactory''.
Strathclyde University and the RSAMD were delighted with their
gradings. Professor John Arbuthnott, Principal of Strathclyde
University, said it was a marvellous achievement, given that staff had
to maintain quality at a time of year on year funding cuts.
Strathclyde had achieved six ''excellent'' ratings since the
assessments began three years ago, placing the university ''firmly among
the UK leaders,'' said the principal.
The rating carries a reward of a 5% increase in funded student places,
worth an additional #133,000 for up to 55 students in Strathclyde
Business School.
In the RSAMD's case, the financial reward is #80,000. Director of the
School of Music Rita McAllister said: ''Following on conferment upon the
academy of powers to award its own degrees, this achievement is an
official acknowledgement of the high quality of our specialist musical
provision.''
The council also published its reassessment of civil engineering at
Glasgow Caledonian University yesterday. It was the first to receive an
''unsatisfactory'' grade but after a follow-up assessment -- following
an action plan for improvement -- it has been upgraded to
''satisfactory''.
However, assessors expressed doubts about the university's decision to
launch an honours degree course between assessments. There were concerns
about the progression from ordinary to honours degree, whether the
number of students in the honours year were capable of progressing from
an unclassified to an honours degree, and about resource implications.

UNEMPLOYMENT-HIT Fife was boosted yesterday with the launch of a
pioneering project to provide improved training for young people and
produce the skills needed by the region's employers.
The initiative has been made possible with #2m from the Scottish
Office and Scottish Enterprise, enabling Fife Enterprise to put together
a #10m training package.
Fife Enterprise's employer-led approach to the national Skillseekers
initiative was launched by Mr George Kynoch, Scottish Industry Minister.
It not only pioneers the setting up of the Fast-trac organisation but
introduces the country's first learning credit -- a radical approach
working towards meeting the needs of Fife's employers and the creation
of real jobs for its young people.
Fife's innovative approach has already received overwhelming support
from local employers, with more than half of those signed up so far
offering permanent jobs.
The Fife initiative changes the entire method of funding training.
Employers, colleges, and young people will receive direct cash support
from Fast-trac and one of the many unique features will see some Fife
Skillseekers combining an initial year of full-time college followed by
training with employers, as employees.
Praising the swift response from Fife firms, Mr Kynoch said: ''It is
important for the future of their business and the future of the economy
and young people in Fife that they respond.''

The giant natural harbour which provided the British fleet with a safe
anchorage through two world wars is today being promoted as 50 square
miles of opportunity.
Fifty years after the hostilities ended, Scapa Flow is seen as a trump
card after the Flotta oil terminal's successful bid to handle the first
reserves from the Atlantic Frontier.
Oil from the Foinaven field is set to begin flowing early next year,
and will be delivered to the terminal by shuttle tankers.
The ships will load offshore from a vessel presently being converted
into a floating tank capable of storing 300,000 barrels of oil pumped
from well heads on the sea bed.
The belief in Orkney is that a highly-competitive bid from Flotta for
the business - backed by Scapa Flow's impeccable record as an oil port -
persuaded BP that the terminal is the best place for the tankers to
unload before heading back out to the Foinaven field.
In his definitive work on the subject, This Great Harbour Scapa Flow,
the author Bill Hewison says that the huge, all-but-land-locked expanse
of water has been recognised as a superb anchorage since the days of the
Norsemen's long boats.
He notes that through the two world wars, Scapa Flow protected ships
from the Royal Navy and Allied fleets from both storms and enemy
attacks.
And he finishes his book with a chapter on the wealth Flotta and the
oil industry have brought to Orkney. The final paragraph questions how
long the prosperity will last and ends with the words: ''One thing,
however, seems certain.
As long as ships sail the northern seas they will turn for shelter and
safe anchorage to this great harbour - Scapa Flow.''
Orkney's harbours director, Captain Bob Sclater, is delighted those
words turned out to be prophetic, as he looks out over the island-ringed
sheet of water from his office window.
''We have a vast area of sheltered deep water which is world renowned
and has been used for hundreds of years by all kinds of ships,'' he
said.
''It means that we're in the enviable position of being able to offer
the oil companies a harbour with a reputation for safety and efficiency
that's second to none.''
Oil and gas delivered to Flotta by undersea pipeline from the North
Sea is then loaded on to tankers for delivery world wide.
The operation began in 1977 and since then around 230 million tonnes
of oil have been transfered on to tankers with no serious pollution
incidents.
Over the 18 years a close working relationship has developed between
the terminal's operators and the islands council.
Perversely, the lack of controversy surrounding Orkney's oil
operations proved to be a handicap when the islands began to bid for a
slice of the Atlantic action.
''We've had to make people aware of Orkney's connection with the oil
industry,'' said Dr John Brown, an islands councillor who serves on the
local authority's oil development working group.
''We found that people were aware of Flotta, but were very often
unaware that it was associated with Orkney.
''And that is because of the quiet co-operation that's been the
hallmark of the relationship between the terminal and the council and
the fact that, over the years, there have been so few problems, whether
political or environmental.''
Using the same approach, the working group set out to raise Orkney's
profile. Oil companies, industry consultants and academics were invited
to see what was on offer, as well as a Government Minister and senior
officials.
''Without exception, they went away impressed by Scapa Flow, Flotta
and the entire oil operation,'' said Dr Brown, a geologist and oil
exploration consultant.
''It means that people are now less inclined to refer to the new oil
fields as west of Shetland and describe them instead as the Atlantic
Frontier.
''We're happy that our initial remit has been successfully concluded
and that everyone associated with the Atlantic Frontier knows that we're
here and consults with us about future developments.
''Our aim now is to market Orkney to ensure that we win as much
oil-related business as possible.''
The Flotta terminal is a cornerstone of the islands' economy. The
shuttle tanker business is important, but a pipeline from the Atlantic
fields would ensure that it continues to operate well into the next
century.
Far more oil than will flow from Foinaven will have to be recovered
from other fields to make this an economic possibility.
But the council's convener, Hugh Halcro-Johnston, has called on Energy
Minister Tim Eggar to ensure that plans for a pipeline are developed to
safeguard the environment.
''These new developments represent a major opportunity for Orkney, but
that must be weighed up against the possible environmental impact on the
islands,'' the convener said.
''The oil from the Atlantic Frontier is much heavier than that found
in the North Sea and, with a prevailing westerly wind, any spillages
from tankers loading at sea could be disastrous for both Orkney and
Shetland.
''Pipelines are intrinsically safer than offshore loading, and we
asked Mr Eggar to make sure that plans for a pipeline system are
formulated as soon as possible.''

WORK has begun on dumping nearly 1000 tons of quarry stone in the
River Leven downstream of Bonhill Bridge, in an effort to stop poaching
of salmon and sea trout.
The problem, stemming partly from the bridge itself, has ceased to be
purely an angling problem and in recent summers has led to violence,
disturbance to local residents, and intimidation of legitimate anglers
and bailiffs.
Mr Bill Muir, president of the Loch Lomond Angling Improvement
Association, said yesterday: ''The bailiffs, the police, and local
people living close to the bridge have been sickened in recent years by
the disgraceful scenes, mainly after dark, and -- it has to be said --
caused mainly by local people from the Vale of Leven. We hope that by
filling in this pool we will get rid of the hooligans once and for
all.''
Mr Muir says the trouble began when Bonhill Bridge, linking Bonhill
with Alexandria across the Leven, was replaced nine years ago. Prior to
the bridge works, the bed of the river had been undisturbed for
generations.
The salmon, grilse, and sea trout which run from the Clyde and ascend
the Leven to enter the huge Loch Lomond system simply ran through the
shallow water to the comparative safety of the large Barrage Pool. The
bridge works broke the solum of the river, which then dug itself a new
pool about 100ft long and in places 12ft deep downstream of the bridge.
In favourable water conditions during summer, shoals of salmon,
grilse, and sea trout often more than 500 strong can ascend the Leven
off each tide. Years of experience with the local poachers has led the
bailiffs employed by the LLAIA to ''escort'' the fish upstream, one
vehicle in the van of the shoal, one bringing up the rear, until the
plainly visible mass of fish was safely through the Vale's housing
schemes.
However, the fish seemed either to find the new pool a natural resting
place or were deterred by the shadow of the bridge looming above the
pool.
The poachers thought Christmas had arrived early. Their technique --
throwing a lead-weighted line with sets of treble hooks across the backs
of the lying fish then ripping backwards -- either results in an
illegally foul-hooked salmon or a badly maimed one whose open wounds
become vulnerable to disease and fungus. The damaged fish hauled on the
bank are sold commercially to hotels or restaurants.
Mr Muir said yesterday: ''We needed drastic action to stop it so we
received planning permission to have the pool filled in. We have
received great assistance from Tilcon Ltd, who have slashed the price of
the stone from Dumbuck Quarry and also from the haulier, W H Malcolm,
who are transporting it to the river bank at a modified price.''
A clean-up effort of a more straightforward nature takes place on
September 3. It will be a big volunteer exercise to clear rhodendrons,
improve paths, and tidy shores.
Radio presenter Jimmie Macgregor was at Luss yesterday to drum up
support for the effort, along with the Bank of Scotland's PR director,
Mr Iain Fiddes, representing the main sponsor.

HOUSEHOLDERS in Grampian are being warned about a bogus doorstep sales
force offering expensive items and representing companies with names
which make it appear they have the approval of the regional council.
There are no such companies and Grampian's director of consumer
protection, Mr Eric Melrose, said yesterday: ''We have received
complaints about the activities of companies offering to sell highly
priced household cleaning appliances. The complaints appear to indicate
that the elderly in particular are being targeted. Some of the items
offered for sale cost well over #1000.''

THE Scottish College of Nursery Nursing, the first privately-run such
college in Scotland, will open in the autumn, offering a two-year course
to students who want to become nannies or work in nurseries or nursery
schools.
Veronica Wilson and Fiona Scott were propelled into the child-care
business by the lack of good, reliable child care when they needed it.
Now, as providers of nannies and mother's helps, through their joint
Emergency Mums and Nannies business, they have seen the gap in courses
offered by the further-education colleges.
They found that training for nursery nurses did not equip girls for
taking sole charge of young children, which is what their clients
needed. With the change from the NNEB qualification to an HNC in child
care it is now possible to go through the course without any hands-on
experience of children under two, yet 75% of the mothers who contact the
agencies are looking for someone able to take care of a baby.
They now have premises in Edinburgh which will be converted to a
college plus day nursery and nursery school where the students will gain
practical experience as well as going out on placements to other
nurseries. They also plan to offer placements in families for would-be
nannies.
''At present most colleges tell their students that a job as a nanny
is second-best, yet many nannies will earn more and have a much more
satisfying job than girls working in nurseries. Unfortunately there are
still nurseries which don't encourage staff to spend a lot of time with
individual children. We were both brought up by nursery-school teachers
and would like to see more of the educational element in nurseries. We
plan to have a very high staff ratio of one adult to two children, so
each child will have a key worker,'' said Scott .
Both are keen that nurseries should encourage parents to look for the
highest standards. They are even considering having two-way mirrors so
that parents can come in and watch their children playing to see how
they are settling in without the child rushing up to them.
Since the college will be a commercial venture, students will not be
eligible for grants. They will have to find about #4000 a year for the
two-year course, but will be eligible for 25% tax relief. Veronica and
Fiona see themselves competing with the well-known private colleges in
England like Norland and Princess Christian, which guarantee a placement
for students who successfully complete the course.

The ship that plies the waters of the North Sea between Invergorden
and Kirkwall carries, in the words of her owners, almost everything an
island community needs to survive.
As Orcargo celebrated three years of operating Orkney's youngest ferry
service, managing director David Laidlow sat down to compile some
startling statistics.
The company's vessel, the Contender, had clocked up more than 192,000
nautical miles on 888 return voyages over the three years - sailing the
equivalent of nine times around the world.
On the journey north she carries anything from malt for Orkney's
whisky distillery to building materials, aviation fuel and food for both
people and livestock.
Cattle and sheep are often the main cargo when the ferry heads back to
Invergorden - she now handles more than 50% of the farm animals exported
from the islands.
But the ship also carries a wide selection of Orkney produce -
shellfish, white fish, oat cakes, beer and whisky - as well as more
unusual items such as glass for recycling collected from the islands'
bottle banks. Many in the community consider that the Contender offers
an essential service.
But it is a service severely threatened by a Scottish Office decision
to remove the subsidy it currently provides on the cargo she and other
freight vessels carry to and from the Northern Isles.
For Mr Laidlow and the Contender's crew, the anniversary celebrations
were shadowed by uncertainty.
The subsidy - 47.5% on freight leaving Orkney, 10.5% on imports from
mainland Scotland - disappeared on May 1.
Orcargo was left with two options, according to the managing director.
Prices will have to go up to compensate for the loss of subsidy and
costs will needs to be cut drastically - perhaps by employing a foreign
crew.
''When we started out we existed without subsidy for a little over 12
months as we proved our commitment and the viablity of the route,'' said
Mr Laidlow.
''It was very, very difficult and we suffered severe losses. If we
hadn't been accepted into the subsidy scheme we couldn't have carried on
- to date it has ensured our survival.
''Now it's gone, our rates may well have to be dramatically increased.
If we then don't maintain the same level of business, quite simply we
won't be here - we'll have to withdraw the service.''
When the Contender was bought to operate the route - she had already
proved her suitability on a South Atlantic service linking Chile,
Uruguay and the Falkland Islands - Orcargo went to the expense of having
her registered in Britain.
''We also have a British crew, which makes her more expensive to
operate,'' said Mr Laidlow. ''But we thought it was the correct way to
run a service that carries more-or-less everything an island community
like Orkney needs.
''We may now be forced to flag out - to have her registered in another
country - which would enable us to employ an overseas crew and cut our
labour costs.''
The Contender's skipper, Captain Peter Clarke, acknowledges that these
are worrying times for him and his crew of 18 men and women.
''We all get on very well together, and we share the same sense of
uncertainty,'' he said.
In three years, the ship they run carried 12,079 commercial vehicles,
4064 cars and 6998 passengers - the Contender has room for 12 and
provides them with a meal and en-suite cabin.
Captain Clarke said he was proud to have played a part in introducing
competition on Orkney's shipping routes.
''I think we offer a vital service,'' he said. ''We've played a big
part in breaking the stranglehold there was before.
''Competition is vital for everyone. It keeps prices down and it keeps
business flowing.''
Those are sentiments shared by Steven Harvey, an Orkney farmer who
also acts as a livestock agent for customers throughout Scotland.
The Contender carries around 40 per cent of the cattle and around 80
per cent of the sheep exported from the islands.
''It's not just a valuable service, it's essential for Orkney,'' Mr
Harvey said. ''It's completely opened up the markets for our livestock.
''It means I can buy cattle at the mart in Kirkwall and, by using the
overnight sailing, have them delivered to a customer in somewhere like
Fife by nine o'clock the following morning.
''Orcargo have excellent facilities on board for stock in transport
and every one of my customers more-or-less demands that they are
delivered via the Invergordon route, because they arrive in such superb
condition.''
The subsidy on livestock is not to disappear altogether. But it will
be cut from 47.5% to 33%, and Mr Harvey is deeply concerned that the
complete loss of subsidy on other freight will mean the end of the
service.
''That would be a devastating loss,'' he added. ''I really can't
emphasise how important this connection is to Orkney.''
A community-wide call was made for the Scottish Office to delay the
implementation of the cuts.
A group representing the islands council together with Orkney's
chamber of commerce, food and drink industry, local enterprise company,
mart and National Farmer's Union of Scotland branch claimed that the
loss of the subsidy reflects a ''totally inadequate understanding of
Orkney's transport needs''.
The group is concerned that the freight services operated to Orkney
and Shetland by the Aberdeen-based Streamline company could also be
forced out of business, leaving P &amp; O with a monopoly on routes to the
Northern Isles.
But the request for a moratorium was rejected by the Scottish Office.
Ministers argue that the best way to channel subsidy is to provide P &amp;
O with a block grant to help the company maintain essential passenger
services to the two island communities.
They claim that the old system led to over capacity on the freight
routes and that market forces will ensure that cargo will continue to be
carried at a reasonable cost.
''Ministers are confident that there is sufficient competition in the
market place to ensure that freight tariffs to users will not rise
significantly, if at all, in real terms,'' said a Scottish Office
spokesman.
The fear in Orkney is that the Ministers have got their sums wrong,
and that the equation should read: loss of subsidy = loss of competition
= price rises.

THE delegates at Scottish Conservative conferences are not truly
representative of the party (May 12).
How can a midweek three-day event attract supporters or activists who
have family, work, or business commitments?
Surely a two-day event which includes part of a weekend, a less
restrictive entrance fee, and a more imaginative, varied, and flexible
programme will encourage wider participation and a genuine
representation of the party.

IN 1979, as a Labour Party member torn between the arguments within
the Labour Party for and against devolution on the eve of the 1979
referendum, I attended a debate in which Malcolm Rifkind delivered an
immensely powerful speech in favour of the Labour Government's proposals
and persuaded me to vote for the Scottish assembly on offer at that
time.
Sadly, office under Margaret Thatcher seduced Mr Rifkind, and it is
only now, in the dying days of the Major Government, with discipline
crumbling as Ministers jockey for position, that he has again let his
views on this subject be known.
Mr Rifkind must for now deny that there are genuine differences
between him and his leader, but he is a highly intelligent and shrewd
politician who is completely in control of his tongue and who could not
but be aware of the impact his clear signal would have in Scotland and
on Scottish politics.
His marker has been put down, and Scottish Tories can surely now
identify the man who can most credibly lead their rump group in the new
Scottish parliament, after he loses his marginal seat in the next
General Election.

NO PARENT witnessing the final concert following Strathclyde's
Dunbarton Division Primary Schools Orchestra music course held over nine
days at Castle Toward could have failed to be stirred by the sight of 91
primary school children playing to full symphonic strength such pieces
as Schubert's Unfinished Symphony (with acute concentration), Dances
with Wolves (with great feeling), and finally a William Tell Overture
that raised the roof.
Strathclyde disappears next year and the infrastructure and the people
who have made this course possible every year will go with it unless
positive steps are taken by the new councils to provide continuity.
The generosity of spirit that characterised the tutors and Ronald
Walker's conducting must be carried on into the new regime. By
sustaining a happy mix of hard work and sociability, the expertise
available at residential courses such as this does much more than
produce a concert at the end.
Learning an instrument encourages a whole set of valuable life skills
-- a sense of individual responsibility, concentration, and listening.
It encourages confidence and demands discipline.
Few enjoy struggling alone over fingerings and tunings when everyone
else is outside playing and there's still homework to do. Collective
experiences like this offer kids new challenges in the sort of
supportive atmosphere that their families and primary schools cannot
provide.
Disciplined but sociable orchestras and bands not only offer the
rightful home for these growing skills but are the only real rewards for
primary kids who often know full well that the sound of their own
practice leaves a lot to be desired.
With this sort of encouragement, children gain in confidence and
ability, their sound improves and with it their desire to join in and
persevere with an activity that can offer them a source of great shared
joy for the rest of their lives.

ORGANISERS of a charity for the disabled last night denied that they
were on a ''nice little earner'' at the taxpayers' expense.
The National Audit Office is carrying out a routine investigation of
the disabled drivers' charity, Motability.
The charity's chairman, Lord Sterling, said it had nothing to hide. It
provided a valuable service to hundreds of thousands of disabled people.
However, the Social Security Secretary, Mr Peter Lilley, has told the
organisers that they should be fighting for the best value for money for
their customers.
Motability will today hand over the keys of its 500,000th vehicle to a
disabled driver at a Downing Street reception being given by Mr Major.
The charity, through its financial arm, Motability Finance Ltd,
provides leased and adapted cars to disabled drivers, who in return hand
over their weekly #32.65 disability living allowance.
Some disabled groups have voiced concern that the banks behind the
operation are making high profits through the charity's ability to
command hefty discounts from car companies.
Labour MP Harry Barnes, who is piloting his Civil Rights (Disabled
People) Bill through the Commons, said the allegations greatly concerned
him.
''Motability is a very important scheme. If people are paying
excessive amounts for the service then that's unfortunate and it reduces
its scope. It's something that I intend to pursue.''
Mr David Whitton, of the Spinal Injuries Association, said: ''While
Motability is an excellent scheme, there are concerns about the lack of
any other competition.''
Disability groups were so concerned about Motability's activities that
they arranged a meeting with vice-chairman Gerry Acher two weeks ago.
Motability had agreed to come back with figures but had not yet done
so.
The Daily Telegraph, in an article by assistant editor Boris Johnson,
has questioned the way the charity operates and suggested it was making
money from disabled people.
Lord Sterling, chairman of the shipping group P&amp;O and close adviser to
Baroness Thatcher, said that Motability had a ''remarkable'' record.
''The NAO decided over a year ago to look at payments to Motability as
part of its programme of reviewing DSS grant in aid bodies. There is
nothing unusual in this,'' he said in a letter to the Telegraph.
''Mr Johnson states that Motability is a monopoly supplier of cars
which has the potential 'to make rather a lot of money from disabled
people'.
''When I remember from the very day Motability started the tremendous
support we have had from the banks, not just financial and
administrative, but in terms of advice and know-how, I think his
accusation that the scheme is 'a nice little earner' is totally
unjustified.''
One charity source has estimated that disabled people are effectively
paying up to #150 too much per car, and that surplus profits are running
at about #12.5m a year.
The NAO confirmed that an investigation was under way but insisted
that it was routine and similar to others carried out each year on
dozens of organisations which spend taxpayers' money.
''We are looking at what they are doing, seeing how their systems
operate and particularly their accountability to the people who are
paying them,'' an official said.

Helga Tait combines running a successful knitwear business in Rousay
with a full-time job teaching Orkney's designers of the future.
Her garments are highly prized throughout the world, with customers in
America, Japan and across Europe.
''I have a small craft shop on the pier in Rousay where I have my
loom,'' she said. ''It's been open nearly six years now.''
Initially Helga used the shop just as a workshop, working on her
unique designs and creating swatches on the loom.
''But then in the summer time I noticed all the tourists walking right
passed my window and thought they should be in here buying my jumpers.
''So I set up a small rail in the window with a few jumpers and some
craft pieces made on the island and the business really evolved from
there,'' said Helga.
Last year, painter Joseph Hewes (cor) worked as an artist in residence
at the shop and his paintings are among the many local craft items on
display.
''We also hire bicycles so visitors can tour round - there is so much
to see and do here.''
Since the beginning of 1994, Helga has been commuting by ferry to
teach a knitwear and design course at Kirkwall College of Further
Education.
''It's a very stimulating job,'' she said. ''Everybody I've had on the
course so far has been very creative.
''I get a great feeling of excitement helping my students to create
their own unique designs. In a way it's making sure that Orkney's design
and knitwear tradition is kept alive.''
Helga's decision to keep her knitwear business based in Rousay is part
of a determination to attract more visitors to and support the economies
of the smaller island communities.
Rousay can boast one of the archaeological wonders of the world, a
shoreline walk of just over a mile among well-preserved historic sites
dating from the stone age to the Highland clearances of the last
century.
Recognising the archaeological wealth and abundance of flora and fauna
gave Chris Soames the idea of running tours around the island.
Chris, who has lived in Rousay for 26 years, combines work on
computers as a graphic designer with running the island's school bus.
''We wanted to find a way to utilise the bus during the day,'' he said.
''We had won the contract to bus children to school in the morning and
evening, and we hit on the idea of ferrying tourists around.
''Then as we became more and more involved and our knowledge grew
about Rousay, the tour developed and now covers a comprehensive range of
subjects.''
Chris said that anything spied by visitors as being interesting or
unusual on the tour is always fully investigated.
''We're always stopping the bus to look at something - a flower or
bird - so today we have to be the experts in everything from
archaeology, history, geology, botany, to the best places to watch seals
play.''
As the tour's fame has spread, schools from all over the country have
booked seats on Chris's bus for students to use Rousay as an open-air
and remarkably well-equipped classroom.

FORTY more people have died from Aids in Scotland, according to
figures issued yesterday by the Scottish Office for the quarter ended
March 31.
This brought the total of deaths from Aids in Scotland to 470.
Forty-two new cases of Aids were reported, bringing the total,
including deaths, to 645. Of these, 524 (81%) were male and 121 (19%)
female.
In the United Kingdom as a whole, there were 227 deaths from Aids and
the number of Aids cases rose by 389 to a total of 10,693 during the
quarter.
The Scottish Office said 41% of the 645 reported cases in Scotland
were related to sexual intercourse between men and 36% to injecting drug
use.
Fifty-two new cases of HIV infection were reported in Scotland during
the quarter.
* A new HIV testing and counselling service, operated by Ayrshire and
Arran Community Health Care NHS Trust and social workers, was launched
yesterday in Ayrshire.

Silversmith Kevin Allen has achieved a rare honour as one of just
a handful of master craftsman from around the world invited to a
prestigious exhibition in Japan.
The event acts as a showcase for traditional Japanese crafts and
attracts 150,000 visitors. 'It was a great honour for me as only five
craftsman from outside Japan are asked to take part,' said Mr Allen.
'They even went out of their way to make me a personalised workbench and
have invited me back to the next exhibition.'
He and his wife Liz are growing used to exotic international
assignments. The couple have designed and hand-crafted everything from
dinner
services to teapots for wealthy sheiks. Now based at Birsay in
Orkney's west Mainland, they work in both silver and gold.
Kevin defines the art of silversmithing as using sheet silver to
produce items larger than jewellery. 'We design and make things like
cups, plates and pieces such as commemorative chalices,' he said.
He has just completed a commemorative plate to mark Dundee's
800th anniversary and is putting the finishing touches to a three foot
long drinking horn. 'Each piece is totally unique and cannot be
repeated, which
makes them priceless.'
He gets his commissions from all over Britain. 'I might be working for
the very rich and famous but you can't tell because you are commissioned
by a middle man - people like to keep their anonymity.'
Since working in Orkney, Kevin Allan has been impressed by the help he
has received from the islands council. 'It's not just the financial
help - although that is always welcome. It's the way in which they think
ahead to help you.'
When a group of Orkney craft businesses were preparing for a major
trade fair in Aviemore, the council organised a removal firm to
carry all their equipment. 'They made sure that the firm not only
transported it down, but unpacked it as well,' Mr Allan said. 'That left
us all free from the worry and hassel of finding ways to get our gear
down and left us to get on with the important thing of doing business,'
he said.

THE headline on your front page sadly typifies your approach to the
constitutional debate in Scotland (May 13). You chose to misrepresent
what Malcolm Rifkind had to say about devolution. We deserve better from
a serious newspaper that claims at its masthead to be independent.
Malcolm Rifkind's remarks, if taken as a whole and not just as a
''sound bite'', will come as no surprise to many Scottish Tories, who
might, in an ideal world, like to see more decisions affecting Scotland
taken in Scotland.
Anyone who attended the party conference could see that for
themselves, but, and it is a big but, there is no support for Labour's
plan for a devolved tax-raising assembly.
More cogent arguments against such an assembly were put forward at the
conference by both speakers from the floor as well as by senior
Government Ministers. Very few, if any, have been discussed in any depth
in your paper; just two will do for the moment.
Why should a pound earned in Scotland be worth just 97p? Why do we
need another 150 politicians, with their secretaries, advisers, offices,
and attendant bureaucracy?
Malcolm Rifkind's speech to the conference was essentially about the
party's defence policy and naturally included an attack on Opposition
defence policies, or lack of them. This was not just knockabout stuff;
some serious points were made which merit discussion in a truly
independent newspaper.
For example, in an independent Scotland, what will have to the many
thousands of jobs in Scotland working in defence? What will become of
Yarrows and Kvaerner, Govan, both currently building warships for the
Royal Navy? Will an ''English'' navy place orders with a Scottish yard?
What of the jobs at Faslane, Leuchars, Kinloss, and Lossiemouth? There
are many other highly skilled and well-paid jobs in Scotland which
depend on the UK's Armed Forces for their existence.
The SNP have said they will keep all eight Scottish regiments. There
are currently barracks for just three, so five more will have to be
built at a cost in excess of #40m each. Currently there are somewhere in
the region of 30,000 Scots serving in the Armed Forces. Will all these
be repatriated and given a job?
When people say there has been no proper debate in Scotland about
devolution or independence they are right. All the important policy
areas, including defence, foreign policy, the economy, health, social
services, etc, need to be examined against the background of Labour's
plan for a tax-raising assembly and the SNP's bid for independence. At
the moment the debate has been confined to endless discussions in the
Constitutional Convention as to how an assembly might function but not
what it might do for people in Scotland, while Alex Salmond spends most
of his time waiting in ambush for the odd silly remark from some English
Conservative.
Surely we are big enough to have more important things to do than to
worry about such minor results, real or imagined.
As an independent newspaper, not an independence newspaper, should you
not contribute more to the debate? Your time would be better spent than
it is at the moment trying to write off the Scottish Conservative and
Unionist Party. We have been around a long time and will be for the
foreseeable future.

Tony Blair made a keynote speech for Labour in Aberdeen to coincide
with John Major's address to the Tory Party faithful in Glasgow's Royal
Concert Hall. Blair stated the new Labour policy which will direct its
activities now that it has abandoned Clause 4. Labour wants one party
united in socialism throughout the UK, and will plan its direction by
discussion with the business community.
Aberdeen is the oil capital of Europe. It is very significant that
Tony Blair made his speech there. He obviously wants to talk to the
business community in Aberdeen. Westminster people have always been very
keen on doing that.
Mrs Thatcher found the #800bn oil revenues accrued between 1979 and
1991 useful to pay for the Falklands war, the Gulf war and the Channel
Tunnel. Tony Blair obviously wants to ensure that the oil moguls want to
view him in the same light.
It is also very significant that in the home town of Scottish
capitalism Tony Blair did not mention the word devolution in his speech.
Devolution apparently stands for the fact that he took over from John
Smith, who appears to have represented Scottish politics to many people,
and that he wanted time to think about things without losing the
Scottish vote.
We can safely assume that now that he has contrived to abandon Clause
4 he will suffer amnesia about devolution.
The new look of the Labour Party is tantamount to a declaration that
there is a Conservative-Labour pact. Of course there will still be a
Prime Minister and a Leader of the Opposition, and the rules of public
debate in the House of Commons will apply.
Labour can, however, only act to refine or rubber-stamp legislation,
although presumably it will adopt a few peripheral radical policies,
such as the repeal of the laws on fox hunting, to maintain its socialist
face.
To put up the leader of the Liberal Democrats as Leader of the
Opposition, which is now the true state of affairs, would reveal too
much to the nation at once.

IN his letter on behalf of the Residents Against Bishopbriggs Infill
Tipping Group, Mr A G Biggerstaff states that he is unaware of his group
putting out misinformation but then he proceeds to demonstrate precisely
that (May 6).
His group accused the Bishopbriggs Golf Club of intending to deposit
contaminated material on the golf course. This was never at issue since
it is expressly precluded by the Environmental Health Act.
His action group did not advise the golf club of its complaints, as Mr
Biggerstaff would like to infer. On the contrary that information came
to the club's attention indirectly. As a result, a comprehensive
submission dealing with each of the action group's points was prepared
by the club and lodged with the director of planning.
The club's entitlement to use the dump road leading from Balmuildy
Road to fill the Admiralty Dump and adjacent ground for improving the
golf course is implicit in the title deeds. The Sports Centre and
housing backing on to the Dump Road were subsequently constructed on
ground owned by the same superior and therefore in the full knowledge of
the golf club's existing rights.
The Bishopbriggs Golf Club therefore contends that the action group
has issued misinformation which has unfairly influenced opinion and
procedures to the detriment of the club's position and rightful
entitlements.

WHAT a parnoid confused biased person Gerry McSherry has shown himself
to be (May 9). His rambling ranting illogical denunciation of ''those
who have no children'' sent a shiver of fear down my spine. He obviously
has a phobia about these people as he mentioned them no less than nine
times.
His fear of Roman Catholics being ''dominant'' in Scotland oozes from
every line.
He wants to end sectarianism in Scotland which he states was ''caused
by the 1918 Education Act''.
We didn't have sectarianism before this? Then why did we need the Act?
In his view Roman Catholic parents are weak-willed, manipulated and
coerced into sending their children to Catholic schools. I always
believed it was through religious duty and conviction to an educational
ethos equal to that of the home.
Mr McSherry believes the term ''non-Catholic'' is offensive. Scottish
families of Jewish, Muslim, and other faiths must find this very
confusing. Mr McSherry believes only ''Christian-minded'' parents are
capable of working towards a harmonious, bigotry free Scotland.
Aren't Scots of all faiths or none at all invited to work towards an
equal and free Scotland? Isn't mutual respect and tolerance our
objective?
Scotland is multi-racial but Mr McSherry would like us to think only
in terms of Protestant and Catholic.
As long as souls such as McSherry continue to spout forth in thinly
disguised intolerant writing, religious bigotry will continue to
flourish and fester the world over.

I WRITE to endorse the perceptive and well-argued case presented in
Gerry McSherry's Open Forum (May 9). Few things foster ignorance and
prejudice more effectively than segregation.
His case against the segregation of Scotland's schoolchildren,
according to their (often nominal) religious persuasion, was compelling.
The Act which facilitated this process was a response to the situation
which existed in the nineteenth century and is now hopelessly
inappropriate as we look forward to the coming of the twenty-first
century.
Mr McSherry highlights the impact that segregation can have upon
schoolchildren. I might add that it also has a profoundly detrimental
effect upon those teachers who are not recognised and accredited by the
RC authorities.
While RC-approved teachers are free to apply for posts within both RC
and non-denominational schools (as they undoubtedly should), the same
issue of your own paper advertised posts to which ''Roman Catholic
applicants only'' could apply.
Apart perhaps from Northern Ireland, could such an advertisement
appear in any other country without comment or opprobrium?

IT was a little old lady with a blue rinse and a Ford Fiesta who
delivered the unkindest blow to fearless investigative reporter Roger
Cook. Over the years, villains and racketeers have left him with crushed
ribs, fractured collar bones, a cracked skull, and more bruises than a
Mike Tyson opponent. But it was the 73-year-old woman driver who broke
his neck when she smacked into his car in a motorway traffic jam last
year.
His neck, which one assumed was made of brass, is still giving him gip
but, he declares, it doesn't prevent him sticking it out when needs must
in the course of his duties.
Cook is the Waffen SS of consumer journalism. The best
foot-in-the-door man in the business. Next week sees the return of
another series of his Cook Report on ITV; pure tabloid television and
proud of it. People actually tune in just to see him getting smacked
about the head with a baseball bat.
Last time round it was Chinese Triads and hotdog venders who were
given the full Cooky-boy treatment. This time, like some overweight
caped crusader, he's been unleashed ''to expose evil, unmask villains,
and reveal what governments don't want you to know''. Well, that's what
his rather pompous press release states.
Cut to a promo film of Big Roj, sporting a ludicrous disguise of a
Zapata moustache and a pony-tailed wig. Cut again to Big Roj in a
chopper hovering over the Rwandan jungle; below him bloated bodies float
down a rancid river. Ah, it must be expose-the-ruthless-arms-dealers
time. And cut again to a makey-up security firm, ''Protect-U-Right'', a
Big Roj invention to unmask a gang of ruthless extortionists in the
private security business. All good wham-bam fun. No turn left unstoned.
Cook, like his programme, talks in cliches. When you talk to him he
uses phrases like ''undercover operatives'', and ''intelligence
sources''. His bruising brand of reportage comes from the Boy's Own
school of journalism. One programme in the new series, for instance,
spotlights the shady and dangerous world of the contract killer. So how
do you do that, Roj?
Well, you go to Spain and rent a big villa in the hills. Then you
smuggle a gun -- a real gun -- across the border. Next you tap into the
international assassination bureau network and find yourself a killer.
''The hit man we got,'' explains the Big Man, ''travelled halfway
round the world. He was South African and we knew he was probably
ex-army and highly experienced. We supplied the gun -- it was
embarrassingly easy to smuggle it into Spain -- because he didn't want
it traced back to him. He had a tariff and we paid him #2500.''
What? To kill someone, Roj? Thankfully not. ''We employed him to issue
a deadly warning to a fictitious businessman,'' he says. What in fact
the hit man did was, well, murder a bed. A nice big double-bed which had
caused no harm to anyone. A hidden camera captures the black-clad
villain shooting five bullets straight through the quilt and
spray-painting the bedroom wall in blood red with the ominous message
''Soon''.
The tough-speaking journo declares: ''If there is a confrontation to
be done then it will be done.'' So did Roj, in his own inimitable style,
then burst into the room and confront the bed killer? ''No. He was one
of the people I chose not to confront,'' admits Roger The Dodger. ''You
have to know when to choose your targets.''
Talking of killers and targets, Cook drops into conversation the
astonishing fact that there is currently a contract out on him -- and
it's not the lucrative kind you get from television companies.
''Last Friday the head of a regional crime squad, I won't tell you
which one, contacted me to say that there was a contract out on me. He
told me that it was because of something I'd done in the last series.
''I'm not in a position to say who has taken out the contract. The
information came from someone who the police have been interviewing. If
I name him then he could be terminated himself. The police have so much
on him that he's turned Queen's,'' he says.
Cook says he's had warnings before (one time a bloke from the UDA was
dispatched to kill him but he got out of his brain in the pub instead)
but this time he's genuinely worried.
''This is probably the most serious. It's because of who it is and
what his capabilities are. I'm getting no official protection but the
police are looking into it,'' he adds.
Is he frightened? ''Yes. But not to the point of giving up. There is a
degree of worry involved.'' He says his family -- he's married with a
10-year-old daughter -- have issued broad hints about him packing the
whole thing in for a game of soldiers but, he admits, ''I'd be like a
bear with a sore head.''
And, as far as he's concerned, the latest contract is ''a waste of
space''. It would achieve nothing because the programme in question has
already been shown -- and the damage, which was ''considerable'', has
been done. It is a simple case of revenge. When pressed, however, he
admits to owning a gun for his own protection.
''It might sound like a wonderful publicity stunt but it's not. I
honestly wish it had not happened,'' he adds. He admits to getting tired
(he's just turned 50) and when he gets threatened -- and even injured --
he often wonders if he can go on. But, even though he is contemplating
jacking it in in the long term, he doesn't want to give up over little
things like a price on his head.
''That would be letting the villains win. If they successfully put you
out of action then they've won.''
The Cook Report, which regularly pulls in an audience of 10 million
(unheard of for a current affairs show), is reckoned to be the most
expensive programme of its kind on British television. Roger fronts the
programme but he's backed up by a team of six researchers. In the latest
series it also involved employing two Asian journalists to infiltrate an
immigrant smuggling ring.
For a programme about the illegal trade of plutonium by the Russian
mafia they even employed a nuclear scientist. The programme often
involves spending huge amounts of money, not only taking film crews
abroad, but also renting and fitting out, say, a shop or a pub for
particular stings.
Cook admits that they act as agent provocateurs. ''Yes, that's what we
do. But we don't drag some poor yob into doing something. We get
somebody whose normal business is this kind of thing. We don't make them
do it. We give them the opportunity to do it.''
* The Cook Report returns to ITV on Tuesday, May 23.

Community leaders in Orkney believe that there are few projects more
worthy of substantial European funding than the islands' new auction
mart.
Farming, they argue, is the engine that drives Orkney's economy. And a
mart is required that matches the suberb quality of the animals that
enter the sale ring.
Despite an early setback in winning finance from Europe, construction
work is already underway on the outskirts of Kirkwall.
The new premises will cost #2.7m and have been designed to meet the
toughest health, hygiene and welfare standards. The aim is to build a
mart that will take Orkney farming into the 21st century.
A crucial component is a hoped-for grant of #1m under the European
Objective One programme for the Highlands and Islands.
Late last year, an unsuccessful initial bid for the funding was made
by the Orkney Auction Mart Company.
But vice-chairman Steven Metcalf believes that, after discussions with
the Scottish Office officials responsible for the grant scheme, a
happier outcome is now far more likely when the bid is reconsidered.
''It was extremely disapointing not to get the money at the first
attempt in view of the importance of the project to Orkney,'' he said.
''But we feel confident that the Scottish Office appreciates the need
for a modern, new mart and is fully behind the project.''
The present mart, in the centre of Kirkwall, is antiquated and far too
small to handle big cattle sales.
In recent months, more than 1500 cattle have been sold in a single day
at premises built to cope with less than half that number.
Traffic congestion built up as lorries delivered animals for sale and
buyers found it extremely difficult to view cattle before they came
under the hammer.
Every year, up to 27,000 cattle are shipped from Orkney for finishing
on farms mainly in the north-east of Scotland.
''It is important that the islands' farming community has its own
mart, where farmers can see their animals sold in the ring,'' said Mr
Metcalf. ''It is best that a sale takes place before store cattle are
transported south, so that they can go direct from their sea journey to
the farm that has bought them.
''But there is also a substantial internal trade in grazing cattle and
Orkney needs a mart to handle these animals as well.''
A crucial feature of the new mart is the accommodation it will be able
to provide for beasts brought in from Orkney's North Isles, which
produce around a third of the islands' cattle.
These animals can arrive by ferry up to four days before a sale and,
like others waiting to be shipped out of Orkney, require feed and
shelter to keep them in top condition.
The building under construction will one day provide accommodation for
1053 cattle or 4200 lambs.
''Indoor housing where animals can be fed and watered and protected
from the weather is vital,'' Mr Metcalf said.
''Providing that sort of facility - as well as the most up-to-date
waste-management to deal with dung and slurry - is highly expensive.
''It amounts to almost a third of the total project cost. It's a
feature that's unique to a mart being built to serve an island community
and it means that the development will be far more expensive than a
similar scheme on the Scottish mainland.''
Mr Metcalf is convinced that the mart project fits the objectives of a
European funding programme designed to boost the ecomomy of the
Highlands and Islands.
''A new mart is cenrtal to the future health of Orkney's principal
industry,'' he added.
Orkney Islands Council has offered its full support and #700,000 in
funding for the development. A further #250,000 has been promised by
Orkney Enterprise.
The mart company itself set an initial target of raising #150,000 in
new share capital and recently announced that it would be seeking a
further #100,000.
Howie Firth, chairman of the council's economic development committee,
said that the authority remained confident that the mart would succeed
in attracting crucial European finance.
''Farming is the engine which drives our economy,'' he said. ''Our
farmers are using knowledge built up over generations to produce cattle
of the very highest quality on traditional family-run farms.
''It's essential that we provide them with the very best conditions in
which to sell those animals.
''And we want to ensure that Orkney has a mart for the 21st century
that meets the very highest standards of animal welfare and overall
quality.''
Mr Firth said he believed strongly in the benefits Europe could bring
to periferal areas like Orkney.
''A project like this is exactly what the Objective One programme was
designed to support. It eminently qualifies for funding,'' he added.

POOR Dr Mawhinney. Here he is, trying to privatise rail services in
Britain because he genuinely believes that the subsequent fragmentation
would lead to better services, and all he hears from the customers is
condemnation. For all sort of reasons (although mostly political) he
changes track and pours subsidies into pegging ticket prices for the
next seven years. What he hears, by and large, is more condemnation. Are
people downright ungrateful or do they just not understand? The truth is
that rail customers understand only too well what is going on. The
announcement that the majority of prices will be controlled for some
years to come is good news. Dr Mawhinney is undoubtedly correct when he
says that fare prices have risen by more than 22% over inflation in the
last 10 years. A period of price stability will be an excellent present
to rail users and may persuade more to use the network, or whatever is
left of the network in the future. The number of users of rail services
appears to have shrunk in the last two decades and anything which gets
people back on to trains, as opposed to buses and cars, is to be
welcomed. Thus far the news is good, so why should the Mawhinney
masterstroke, backed, we are told, by the personal intervention of the
Prime Minister, be received with such curmudgeonly ill-grace?
The answer is simple. For the last 15 years passengers have suffered
from increases in rail fares above the level of inflation because the
Government wanted to keep down the level of subsidy. Now, faced with the
disintegration of rail privatisation plans, and acutely aware of the
electoral damage which is, and will continue to be, caused by this
ill-conceived exercise, the Government has acted to peg fares and pour
in more subsidies. Customers will save on their fares, but as taxpayers
they will lose because of the increased subsidies. Moreover, the money
to develop services has traditionally come from the price of fares. If
this is pegged, and if Government subsidies are not sufficiently large
to make up the shortfall, the long-term result will be worse services,
higher fares, or both. At this point the plot, thickened by the
cornflour of privatisation, becomes truly glutinous.
Why, asks the man on the Sprinter, if the Government can find money to
subsidise the rail service for privatisation, did it so stubbornly
refuse to find money to maintain and improve the service when it was run
by and on behalf of the nation? Dr Mawhinney's answer to that question
is the purest baloney. Only now, he insists, as the railways move into
the private sector is there sufficient promise of improved efficiency
and management skills to make the injection of more subsidies possible.
The utter silliness of it all can be seen in the fact that those
exemplars of management efficiency, the would-be private operators, are
dismayed at the price pegs as another constraint on the way that they
would run their little bits of the business. Moreover, deprived of the
revenue from higher fares, they now plan to press the Government for yet
higher subsidies to make the whole exercise worth their time and money.
In these circumstances the already lukewarm interest expressed in buying
rail franchises is likely to wither like leaves on the line. Indeed, it
is hard to see how rail privatisation, particularly in Scotland, is
anything other than dead. The prediction that Strathclyde, with more
than half of all Scottish services, may have to be left out of the
Passenger Services Requirements for Scotland is surely a grievous blow.
Roll on the coup de grace.

ST AUGUSTINE'S oft-quoted adage about something new always coming out
of Africa has taken a contemporary twist in the shape of new diseases
like Lassa fever and the Ebola virus which is understandably terrifying
Zaireans at this moment. Aids too may have had an African origin, though
the tropical world has no monopoly of nasty viruses which often defy the
best efforts of modern science. The Ebola virus certainly does. There is
no vaccine and no cure. Estimates of its lethality vary but the most
commonly quoted now suggest that 90% of all persons infected are likely
to die, and quickly. That statistic contains its own element of hope,
for the speed of death is such as to reduce the chance of the virus's
own survival and successful replication in other hosts. Its method of
transmission is also such as to curb its spread. It is easy, therefore,
to see why the experts from the World Health Organisation are optimistic
that sanitary precautions and control may by themselves be enough to
contain the latest outbreak. It has spread towards the country's
capital, Kinshasa, and as the original outbreak was in a city of half a
million souls, an element of panic was probably to be expected. At least
the Government, which is not famous for dispatch, has sought to contain
the outbreak by a imposing a quarantine enforced by troops. If the WHO
is right these measures may be enough to prevent matters getting out of
hand, as in 1976 when the virus claimed some hundreds of victims before
exhausting itself.
The incident is a reminder of how vulnerable mankind is to such malign
developments. New diseases are probably always being born (and some old
diseases once thought to have been eradicated by modern drugs, like TB,
have shown a capacity to re-emerge) but viral diseases pose particular
challenges since they are so hard to combat. In Zaire's case neither the
numbers of medical specialists nor the equipment (including that
designed to protect them from infection in the course of their work) are
available to the extent rquired. Zaire has suffered dreadfully in the
years since President Mobutu imposed his rule in 1965. Corruption and
mismanagement on a colossal scale have compounded other problems -- the
latest being the near million refugees from Rwanda in the north-east of
the country. The country hardly has the resources available to cope with
any large epidemic and it needs specialised help (and not just advice)
which should be provided directly by the WHO, which is an agency of the
UN.
Some American commentators have suggested that something more is
required -- and not just for Zaire. The developed world ought to be
ready to spend large sums of money on establishing specialist
institutions to investigate and monitor new diseases when first
identified and before they reach the position now achieved by the Aids
virus which has so far defied the best efforts of medical science. The
cost of such initiatives would be enormous, but the savings, quite apart
from the lives involved, would be commensurate. It may be easier to
recommend such developments than to identify the exact source of their
funding but at least in WHO there already exists a specialised UN agency
which is known to be efficient, and could be the vehicle required. Few
scientists believe that we have seen the last large-scale viral epidemic
in Aids. The sooner we are prepared the better, and certainly the better
to counter some form which is more easily transmitted than anything
known so far. Were that to appear the panic in Kikwit last week would be
nothing.

ON SUNDAY an ancient village has a chance to make its name that few
outsiders know how to pronounce. Some say Camelon as if it were from a
legend about King Arthur. Others in plainer Scotch put equal emphasis on
came and lon. Neither is it. The villagers have their own way of calling
their own place.
Not that being miscried bothers them, especially this week. They
expect the attention of people who don't know where they are never mind
how to talk about them. They seek more claim to fame than their name.
Don't worry about it, they say. If Camelon is too much to get the
tongue around, just call them the Mariners, which while easier to say
can be even trickier to explain.
On Sunday the Mariners will confront and otherwise try conclusions
with the Burnie.
What's afoot at Motherwell's park is the final game of the Junior Cup.
Victory will make either Camelon or Whitburn the big noise in small-town
football. It has been a long time since the bright opportunity came
their way, especially Camelon's. On an otherwise sunny day they were
beaten in a final all of 43 years ago, whereas Whitburn had their last
chance as recently as l966.
This time Camelon finds itself rarely favoured. For nothing fancy has
happened there since it was the Camelot of Arthurian fable, if ever it
was.
Modern Mariners build buses. Their factory skills were first learned
making nails. In the more recent past they held one of the dirtier ends
of the Industrial Revolution. To an indifferent outside world Camelon
supplied gutters and pipes, gas stoves, fire grates. It did creosote and
other mucky stuff. R &amp; A Main was a world-wide name. It went on a
triangle trade mark on stoves. Camelon then had nine foundries. Now
there is not one in the place.
Officially, it is not even a place.
In l900 Camelon was annexed by Falkirk, except it wasn't. ''The people
still feel that they are Mariners. They have a great sense that they are
separate. They don't belong to Falkirk,'' said Alex Howson, the
district's director of leisure services, who has lived in Camelon. He
reckoned that the whole crew of Mariners totals at least l5,000.
How they tell a stranger where to find them is between what they call
the Three Brigs, which are two bridges, and what they call the
distillery, which has become a roadhouse. Penetrating to Camelon is not
a simple journey. Its past is as shrouded as befits the Pict city it
could once have been.
''Much of its history is only legend which can be neither confirmed
nor denied,'' Alex Howson said.
It is a most welcoming sentence with which to greet an outsider since
it leaves everybody free to make up his own Camelon story.
In a pamphlet Alex Howson prepared when he was Falkirk's burgh
librarian he collected some of the fabulous explanations of Camelon's
name. Scholarly research had dug up three Gaelic derivations. If the
name does not mean the crooked marsh, it stands for the curved pool, or
else it indicates the bay of ships.
More venerable romanticism has it that Camelon was an ancient Roman
port when the Firth of Forth was wider than now and river ships could
reach beyond Camelon. Which may explain the Mariner nickname, except it
is as likely not to.
One of the most magical things that ever happened to Camelon (before
Sunday's final, that is) was how water in it used to flow uphill. At the
village from Lock 16 of the Forth and Clyde Canal boats were floated up
a steep slope to the terminus of the Union Canal.
Voyagers from Glasgow to Edinburgh were allowed a quarter-hour break
for refreshment at Mr Rankeillor's Inn. If canal passengers can be
called voyagers, then the men who worked the barges that carried the
likes of fireclay and pig iron were matelots of a sort. Calling them
mariners may have been a piece of Falkirk cheek. If so, Camelon has
embraced the cruel jest. It continues to call it annual June gala
Mariners' Day.
All of which is a long way from the village's football and how to say
its name. Michael Lapsley, 75, a former foundryman, knows about both.
He played centre-half for a season. As a boy he carried pails of water
down the brae for the players' cold baths after games. He remembered
lean times when to eke out club funds housey-housey nights offered for
their big prize a 2lb bag of sugar. He recalled that Jerry Dawson,
prince of goalkeepers and a football scribe, played for Camelon.
And Michael Lapsley says it Kemlin. In print that is as near as a
stranger can get without going there. ''You know they are outsiders if
they don't say Kemlin,'' he said.
He knew that Sunday's game will be different from the sunshine defeat
in l952. For a start the Junior final then had a gate of 69,000. ''But
there will still be a lot of Alexander's buses on the day,'' a
misty-eyed Alex Howson said. ''The Bluebirds will be flying,'' promised
Mick Lapsley. And at the end?
Camelon decrees it will be Kemlin on the open-decker, no problem. They
concede that when they last played Whitburn, the Burnie won. But this
time for reasons too mystical to mention it'll be ye Mariners, you bet.

THERE is no statutory requirement for local authorities to provide
services for children under five, so an extraordinary range of piecemeal
provision has grown up, testament both to the need and the enthusiasm of
parents to provide nursery care from their own pockets, their own
efforts or both.
The Prime Minister's pledge to the Conservative Party conference last
year that there would be a nursery place for all four-year-olds whose
parents want it, can be seen as recognition at the highest level of the
unmet demand for places, but it is distinctly short on an understanding
of how services currently operate. Every political party has now hoisted
pre-school education up the agenda, with a subsequent political
fluttering about how it is to be paid for.
Vouchers are increasingly being proposed as a solution. The Department
for Education expects to make some sort of announcement soon but will
say no more, other than agreeing that vouchers are under active
consideration and that whatever is proposed will be a mixed system,
involving state, private, and voluntary provision.
A voucher scheme -- according to leaks likely to be worth #1000 a year
to parents -- would amount to #20 a week. That would not buy a parent on
low earnings a place in a private nursery, but it might allow someone to
work part-time. There is considerable distrust that it would simply give
extra spending power to people already able to make private provision,
and do little for the rest. However, the Scottish Pre-School Play
Association believe it could boost their income to allow an expansion
and upgrading of their training for playleaders and volunteers.
Professionals in both private and public sectors point out that two
vital questions have yet to be answered: what sort of provision is
meant, and is a place one morning a week or five full days? Nurseries,
nursery schools (both local authority and private) and voluntary
playgroups and playschemes all hope to be counted in.
Education Secretary Gillian Shephard clearly has pre-school nursery
classes in mind. ''We want to provide quality nursery education and not
a national child-minding scheme, '' she said.
The parental demand is for much more, particularly for provision which
is more likely to match even part-time working hours. The enormous
growth in pre-school provision, but particularly the rapid expansion of
the private sector, has been fuelled by the demand by working mothers
for places for under-twos.
By September 1993, 36.9% of three and four-year-olds in Scotland
attended nursery schools. Crucially, the proportion varies over the
country, and even within regions. There were none in the Western Isles,
while in Glasgow the figure was 51.7% and in Argyll and Bute 3.3%.
Shephard clearly recognises the enormous problem of making universal
provision in areas where there is currently very little. Her response to
the Prime Minister's announcement was to say: ''I am an enthusiastic
supporter of nursery education and we will be working very hard to have
the first wave of expansion in place during the lifetime of this
Parliament.''
Nine years ago, Strathclyde region took the innovative step of
integrating all pre-five services within the education department. The
resulting merger between nurseries providing care and nursery-schools
with education as the priority is still not complete.
As a result of a policy review within the last month, Strathclyde's
pre-five unit will now collaborate with all providers of nursery
services, including -- previously anathema -- the private sector. They
have already put that into action. A disabled child whose parents could
no longer afford the fees has had her place paid for rather than be
transferred to the nearest local authority nursery eight miles away,
because it is cheaper than hiring taxis, allows her to remain with the
children she will go to school with, and keeps a place for another
special needs child in the council nursery.
They are also looking at ways of tapping sources of funding not
currently available to them, such as local enterprise companies, which
can be used by nurseries setting up as a business.
Councillor Harry Revie, chair of the pre-five committee, acknowledges
that without the voluntary sector, the position in Strathclyde would be
critical. ''Voluntary organisations and community groups should be
treated as partners in the provision of service. In some parts of the
region the voluntary sector is the main provider of services,'' he said.
That is recognised by the co-option of a representative of the
Strathclyde Pre-School Play Association to the pre-five sub committee.
With more than 1000 affiliated groups, it is the largest voluntary
agency in the region. The sub-text is that if vouchers are proposed,
Reviewants to add them to the council kitty.
Parent power is the common element to all expansion in nursery
provision in all sectors. ''We literally drove round Portree noting
every empty piece of ground and wrote to the owners asking if we could
lease or buy the ground,'' said Mairi MacDonald, a mother of four from
Portree -- a prime mover among the playgroup mums who eventually built
their own community nursery with funding from Skye and Lochalsh
Enterprise, Highland Regional Council and the European Union's leader
fund.
Since some of the money was conditional on the project enabling
mothers to go to work or on training courses, they had to set their
sights much higher than simply providing premises for a playgroup and
mother and toddler group, but soon found their nursery in great demand.
''We started very small with three children in the nursery and we now
have 60 children on the register plus a waiting list,'' said MacDonald.
They include several with special needs, including two autistic
children. Having uncovered the need, the committee is now raising more
money to build an extension to accommodate them and a specialist
teacher.
Fees have been set at #2 an hour to coincide with local childminding
rates, which amounts to #15 a day and about #70 a week.
There is less difference than might be expected between that rate and
the fees for private nurseries in Edinburgh -- currently #85 a week for
children over two and #102 a week for the under-twos at one of the four
nurseries now run by Yvonne Birrell under the title of the Birrell
Collection. Originally a primary teacher who saw a need to provide good
quality nursery education for four-year-olds, her business has expanded
rapidly in six years because of the enormous pressure for places for
under-twos.
With constant demand on her places already, will a voucher system make
any difference? ''Any subsidy which allows parents to provide quality
child care and use their skills in the workplace is a positive step, but
it is a delicate subject and needs to be thought through,'' says
Birrell.
''I agree that vouchers are the fastest way of providing child care,
but they have to address the question of staffing and whether they will
continue the school holiday pattern or whether they are intended to
provide for working mothers with a year-round service. At the moment,
the independent nursery sector is operating to a different set of rules
from the state sector.''
Her concern is for standards in both the domestic care and the
educational development of young children. ''Parents should be in a
position to make an informed choice. Now that there is a lot of
provision in the cities, parents often visit several potential
nurseries, but nine out of ten make their choice on an intuitive
feeling. Parents deserve more information and good operators will be
prepared to provide details about their quality standards. Parents need
to know what else is available and what standards they should be looking
for,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>Labour plans curbs on directors' pay.  Party wants to make utilities set 'fair prices'</HEADLINE>

LABOUR today will announce proposals for regulating the privatised
utilities.
The party's Trade and Industry spokesman Jack Cunningham will tell a
conference in London that Labour's plans are designed to curb excess
profits and directors' salary and share option excesses.
It also wants to force the utilities to set fair prices while at the
same time maintaining managerial incentives to increase efficiency. Dr
Cunningham said: ''At the heart of my proposals, I am considering a new
price-setting rule for the utilities.''
Labour will put forward proposals to increase the accountability of
the regulators and place duties on them to consider the interests of
employees as well as consumers.
Dr Cunningham said last night: ''The present system of regulation
requires a complete shake-up. New Labour recognises the need for
managerial incentives for increasing efficiency while increasing
fairness to the consumer.''
The Labour initiative coincided with renewed debate in the Commons on
the Gas Bill, which provided Labour with a fresh opportunity to attack
the remuneration given to executive and non-executive members of
privatised utilities.
Guidance would be issued by the Secretary of State from time to time
on the extent to which remuneration reflected company performance --
''remuneration'' to include any salaries, fees, benefits in kind or
share options.
Under the terms of the Bill, Labour's amendement only could apply to
British Gas, but Front Bench spokesman Nigel Griffiths made clear that
his party was addressing a key and wider issue which was not just
restricted to British Gas.
He referred to the ''corporate greed of boardroom bonanzas'' and the
lack of restraint being exercised, despite the ''preaching'' in some
Conservative circles.
Mr Griffiths, MP for Edinburgh South, said: ''Payments in the
boardroom should not be completely inconsistent with the performance of
the company and the service to consumers.''
Parliament should not sit back and let utilities get away with such
behaviour when high street showrooms were being shut down, people made
redundant and services to consumers being cut.
For the Government, however, Energy Minister Tim Eggar emphasised the
independence of the regulator and argued that what Labour's amendment
was seeking to do was to get back from the management political control
of the gas industry.
He told the House: ''This is old Labour speaking. What they really
want is political control over all parts of British industry. They have
not really put their hearts into a new Clause Four, it is all part of a
political con job.''
An angry Mr Griffiths intervened, demanding: ''Is new Conservative
backing those with their snouts in the trough -- corporate greed?''
Mr Eggar accused him of making ''a pretty feeble attempt,'' and said
Labour was seeking to ''reintroduce an incomes policy by the back
door.'' At the end of the day, the Minister insisted, it was the
shareholders who had the ultimate say on salary levels.
Labour pushed the matter to a vote, but its proposals were defeated by
271 votes to 234, a Government majority of 37.
Later, Shadow Energy Minister Martin O'Neill called for the Gas
Consumers' Council to be given powers to monitor gas prices.
He said the body had to be ''tough, effective and well resourced'' and
urged that it should be given a responsibility for policing standards
and imposing penalties.

Ground staff are using a secret weapon to ensure that Rangers play
on one of the best pitches in Britain - seaweed from Orkney.
Now the Ibrox connection looks set to create a much-needed jobs boost
for some of the smaller island communities.
Scientists at an oil-industry research station have found a way to
convert seaweed into the plant version of anabolic steroids.
Sprayed on the turf at Ibrox, it encourages growth and helps the
ground staff to maintain a superb playing surface.
A new pitch was created at the end of the 1992-3 season using 10,000
tonnes of gravel, grit, sand and soil.
'It's designed to be fast draining unlike the old heavy pitch,' said
ground superintendent Alan Ferguson. 'But that means that nutrients
just wash away and my fertiliser bill has tripled.'
This is where the seaweed fits in. It acts as a growth promoter,
encouraging the grass to produce bigger and stronger roots which can
absorb more goodness from the soil.
'It seems to be working,' said Mr Ferguson. 'The results are
encouraging and already it's one of the best playing surfaces in
Scotland and among the top four in Britain.'
The seaweed - called tangle (cor) - is gathered by divers and
delivered to the Orkney Water Test Centre (cor) on the island of
Flotta.
There it is mashed in a machine like a giant food processer. The next
stages are top secret. But the end result is a clear golden-brown
liquid which, when diluted, is ready to be sprayed on to grass and
other plants.
Professor Cliff Johnston, the centre's managing director, said the
seaweed extract should still be at the development stage. But tests at
Ibrox and on some of Scotland's major golf courses have proved so
successful that commercial production is now under way.
He estimates that around 10 million tonnes of tangle is growing off
the coast of Orkney in giant underwater forests.
And he believes carefully-controlled harvesting could create
badly-needed work for people living in the smaller island communities.
'We're very optimistic that this will take off,' Professor Johnston
said. 'That will mean opportunties for islanders to collect the weed
and carry out some of the processing.'
He added: 'If you listen to gardening programmes you'll know that
seaweed has a muck-and-magic image.'
'We've taken a scientific approach to come up with a winning product.
But we're keeping some of the mystique because we're not revealing the
secret of how we produce the stuff.'

<HEADLINE>American healthcare group buys 15% stake in Ashbourne Sun set on full takeover</HEADLINE>

THE US firm Sun Healthcare is striding into the UK nursing home
business and could be heading for a full take-over of Ashbourne, the
Glasgow-based chain of nursing homes, and Quality Care, a smaller
company based in Darlington.
A full bid for both companies would be worth up to #140m, but Sun
might not be big enough to swallow the two in one gulp.
Sun said yesterday it had bought a 15% stake in Ashbourne for #12m
from the venture capital firm Electra Kingsley, adding that it would
probably stop for a year to digest that.
But Ashbourne chief executive Tom Hamilton said Sun had its sights set
on a full takeover of the company, which was part of the Stakis group
until a management buy-out in February 1993.
Sun Healthcare, based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, held talks with
Ashbourne about a full takeover before the Scottish company decided to
float its shares on the Stock Exchange in November.
Quality Care confirmed in a statement that it had received an approach
from Sun Healthcare with a view to a possible bid. But company chairman
Duncan Bannatyne said he was not currently prepared to accept the terms
on behalf of trusts holding at least 60% of the shares.
Ashbourne jumped 13p to 153p at the prospect of a full bid, while
Quality Care soared 45p to 275p. However, Quality Care shares remained
well short of Sun's potential bid price of 330p.
Mr Hamilton, said Sun originally wanted to buy all of Electra
Kingsley's 22% stake in the company and was only prevented from doing so
by Takeover Panel regulations.
Asked whether Sun Healthcare eventually planned to buy 100% of
Ashbourne, he replied: ''I think their ultimate goal would be to do
that.
''We have known Sun for a couple of years and we looked at the
possibility of selling to them before the flotation,'' he added.
Sun president Andrew Turner will join the Ashbourne board as a
non-executive director.
The flotation of 62.5% of Ashbourne valued the company at #80.5m and
Sun paid 150p per share, the same price at which Ashbourne shares was
launched on the stock exhange seven months ago.
This represents a premium on recent market levels ranging from 126p to
140p.
Analysts questioned whether Sun Healthcare, which had consolidated net
revenue of $603m (#384m) in 1994, was sufficiently powerful to swallow
Ashbourne and Quality Care in one gulp.
''To take out both Ashbourne and Quality Care you are maybe talking of
up to #140m, I'm not sure that they have sufficient size to do both,''
said Nick Bevin, an analyst with SG Warburg.
But he noted that in many ways the two companies, which rank among the
top 10 chains of UK nursing homes, were complementary.
Ashbourne's 19 homes with 1600 beds are mainly located in Scotland and
the greater London area, while Quality Care's 1000 beds are situated in
North-east England.
Sun Healthcare already has a modest presence in the UK nursing home
market through its subsidiary Exceler Health Care Group, based in Eton.
But Ashbourne chief executive Tom Hamilton said: ''I think Sun's
long-term strategy for the UK is to become a sizeable player.''
Sun's entry into Ashbourne coincided with the publication of
reasonably encouraging results for the six months to April 2.
Ashbourne's operating profits edged up to #2.9m from #2.8m as turnover
rose to #12.6m from #11.4m. But pre-tax profit rocketed to #3.1m from
#360,000 because of the disappearance of heavy interest charges.
Ashbourne used the #47m raised from its flotation to help pay off #55m
of outstanding debt, but Mr Hamilton said Ashbourne had arranged fresh
credit facilities with the Bank of Scotland to finance future expansion.
''We anticipate a year-end debt position of #16m to #20m, depending on
whether we make any further acquisitions of new homes,'' the chief
executive said, estimating that Ashbourne might spend up to #8m on
acquisitions this year in addition to #12m on three new homes.
Ashbourne declared an interim dividend of 1.1p, slightly better than
the 1.0p outlined in the flotation prospectus, and Mr Hamilton said he
expected a full-year payout of 3.3p.
But he warned that the current half year could be difficult because
local authorities were cutting back the referral of elderly people to
private nursing homes because of a spending squeeze.
Occupancy rates in April had fallen to 86% from 91% a year earlier.
Ashbourne charges an average of #350 a week per resident and depends
on public sector funding for nearly half its revenue.
Mr Hamilton said the last quarter had shown a fall in the number of
local authority referrals, particularly of ''topping-up'' patients, who
pay part of the fees themselves.
''We would expect to do slightly better in the second half, but we are
not shouting from the rooftops,'' he said.
Nick Bevin at Warburg pencilled in a full-year pre-tax profit of
#6.4m.
Mr Hamilton said Ashbourne's longer-term prospects were much better
and the company was building new homes targetted at privately-funded
residents in the wealthier suburbs of London.
''The local authority thing is a short-term problem. Over the long
term, the demographic trend and the requirement for people to be cared
for is still there,'' he said.

THE Conservative Party is preparing for a ''best result'' of losing by
7000 votes in the Perth and Kinross by-election, according to an inside
source at the party's headquarters in London.
However, a worst-case scenario of Tory candidate John Godfrey
finishing third behind Labour is now being realised, a spokesman for the
right-wing Scottish Unionists claims.
The Unionists, whose ranks include many top card-carrying
Conservatives, also say that, with Ulster Unionist Party backing, they
will field a candidate against every Scottish Tory MP at the next
General Election -- with the exception of Ayr's Phil Gallie.
Three months ago, the Unionists threatened to stand in the Perth and
Kinross by-election in protest at John Major's Irish Framework Document
and what they claimed were Government double standards on the question
of the Union in Northern Ireland and Scotland.
Both Mr Christopher Monckton, a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher,
and maverick Tory Peter Clarke were touted as potential UUP-backed
candidates.
However, when nominations closed last Thursday, no Unionist contender
appeared on the list of nine candidates fighting for the Perth seat.
Last night, a spokesman for the Scottish Unionists explained that they
were now throwing their weight behind UK Independence Party candidate,
Mr Vivian Linacre, after weighing up the pros and cons of contesting the
seat themselves.
''Two main factors forced our hand,'' said the spokesman. ''One, it
became obvious to us that the Tory candidate, John Godfrey, would lose
without our help . . . it now appears he will out-perform even his own
party's worst-case scenario and finish third.
''The second factor was the death of Down North MP Sir James
Kilfedder. A by-election now appears likely for June 15 and our
resources are better targeted to help on the other side of the water,
where we are supporting Independent Unionist Bob McCartney.''
He promised that the Scottish Unionists -- with UUP backing -- were
now preparing to stand against every Scottish Tory MP at the next
General Election. The only exception would be Ayr MP and staunch
Protestant Phil Gallie -- who appears likely to lose his marginal seat
with or without official Unionist interference.
An inside source at Conservative Central Office in London told The
Herald the party had prepared for a best result of losing by 7000 votes
to the Scottish National Party in Perth -- the seat was previously held
by the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn with a majority of 2094.
''I doubt if an extra Unionist candidate would make any difference to
that scenario,'' he added. ''As for their General Election threat, that
is something the Government are going to have to take on board and deal
with quite seriously.''
Last night, Mr Jeffrey Donaldson, the UUP's secretary, said that after
talking to Scottish Unionist colleagues the UUP was happy to give its
backing to Mr Linacre, whose policies on Europe, the Union, and Northern
Ireland reflected its own.
''In the case of manpower and with the proximity of the Down North
by-election -- a seat which Sir James held by almost 5000 votes at the
last General Election -- it was also not possible to lend the level of
support we wished to the Scottish Unionists,'' he said.
''We are now looking to the longer term after viewing with dismay the
lack of Conservative Party leadership on defence of the Union.
''We are monitoring the position of every Scottish Conservative MP and
will support any challenge at the next General Election to those who do
not begin vigorously defending the Union position.''
A spokesman for Mr Godfrey at Perth dismissed the threat as irrelevant
and said: ''We are fighting this by-election to win it and senior office
holders in the party are countenancing nothing but victory.
''We are also making a strong plea in this by-election on behalf of
the Union. We are the party standing for the Union and we are confident
that on polling day our potential supporters will not choose to back a
fringe organisation.''
Mr Michael Russell, chief executive of the SNP, said: ''The Tories'
campaign is clearly collapsing but the SNP are not interested in the
fight for second place. We are concerned only with beating the Tories
and beating them well.''

IF one of your male contributors, say Jack McLean or John Macleod, had
produced the load of sexist rubbish written by Sara Villiers on how
stupid men are at running barbecues (May 10) there would have arisen
shrill howls of protest from the small band of harpies and quines who,
almost daily now, fill far too much space in your paper with dreary
articles full of ''glass ceilings'', middle-class female grumphing, and
zero tolerance of men.
The only saving grace of Sara Villiers's piece is that she started off
trying to be funny, but she has no idea about where or how to pitch
humour and when one more stereotype is one too many.

COMPUTERS up to a thousand times faster than existing machines could
be built by the end of next year and be commercially available in five
years as the result of a funding package for Scotland announced
yesterday.
It will confirm Scotland as a world-leader in the fast-moving
technology of opto-electronics which is revolutionising data processing
and transmission. Already 1300 are employed in the sector which has a
turnover of #100m a year.
A new generation of computers would effectively give computers and
robots eyes. The computing power needed for visual object recognition is
too great for conventional electronic computers to provide for the
robots you see busy working in car plants, for example, are blind.
The funding package of #2.6m has been awarded by the Engineering and
Physical Sciences Research Council to SCIOS, the Scottish Collaborative
Initiative in Opto-electronic Sciences, a consortium of research
departments from Heriot-Watt, Glasgow, Edinburgh and St Andrews
universities.
Nearly half of the award will go to Heriot-Watt's Department of
Physics, which built the first world's completely optical computer in
1990.
Optical systems move information by using laser light pulses. The
pulses can be sent in parallel, carrying a multitude of messages at the
same time, making optical systems extremely fast.
However, they are less efficient at the logical processing of
information, so that the all-optical computer could not progress beyond
Primary Three mathematics.
Heriot-Watt will produce an opto-electronic data sorting system, which
will link the incredible speed of optical devices with the established
logic-handling of electronic components.
''The sorter will be built as a demonstrator,'' Professor Andrew
Walker of Heriot-Watt, who is also a co-ordinator of SCIOS, told The
Herald. ''That should be put together by the end of next year.
''That itself could be regarded as an opto-electronic computer. We
hope that would be the trigger for the computer companies. They have
begun to appreciate the importance of using optics.
''They appreciate the limitations of the electronic systems. They are
already making moves to us wanting to pick up some of the ideas.''
Scotland is one of the world leaders in opto-electronic research and
already attracts half of all UK Government funding to the sector.
As the European leader in electronic computer production it has the
potential to develop its lead into the next generation of production,
even if it is in collaboration with the Japanese or Americans. Japan
already produces 70% of the world's opto-electronic products.
Next weekend a dozen Scottish companies will travel to America for one
of the world's biggest opto-electronic exhibitions on a Scottish Trade
International mission.
''Scotland is well-placed in terms of research,'' said Alastair
Wilson, head of the opto-electronics team in the Scottish Enterprise
Information Industries Group. ''But many companies are not aware of what
is going on in the universities.''

Bruce McKain looks at why accident victims in Scotland are likely to
receive far less for their injuries than similar claimants in England
JURIES in damages actions in Scotland are a legal oddity imported from
England in 1815, and some lawyers wish they had been strangled at birth.
These juries are no longer available in the sheriff court and there was
a determined bid a few years ago to kill them off in the Court of
Session.
But the decision by two different civil juries to award huge damages
for the elbow injury which ended the sporting career of international
clay pigeon shooter David Girvan shows that civil juries are very much
alive and kicking.
Lawyers acting for pursuers in damages actions love juries because
they generally award much more than judges. Solicitors on the other side
loathe them for exactly the same reason.
One jury awarded Mr Girvan #120,000 for the pain and suffering caused
by his damaged elbow, an award regarded by three appeal court judges as
totally extravagant.
Appeal from the verdict of a civil jury is by way of a retrial and now
a second jury in the Court of Session has reduced the sum, but only
slightly, to #95,000.
These awards for a fracture and dislocation of an elbow are roughly
what judges sitting on their own would award for the pain and suffering
endured by someone paralysed in a road crash and confined to a
wheelchair for life.
So are juries being extravagant or are our judges mean and out of
touch? The answer probably lies somewhere in between.
According to lawyers regularly involved in damages cases in the Court
of Session, Scotland has a long way to go before it provides a fair deal
for accident victims.
It is now more than 20 years since Lord Stott said he could not
understand why an award regarded as reasonable in England was seen as
too high in a comparable Scottish case.
And in 1978 distinguished English judge Lord Diplock said: ''As
respects the measure of damages in actions for personal injuries in
Scotland, there is no difference between English and Scots law.''
So why, as we head towards the year 2000, are Scots judges still
awarding substantially less than English courts award for similar
injuries?
Of course, no two cases are exactly the same and total awards depend
on factors such as the age of the victim and loss of earnings, but where
fair comparisons can be made between the two jurisdictions Scotland does
not come out well.
In December last year, at the Court of Session, Lord Penrose awarded
44-year-old Elizabeth Martin record damages of #1.6m after a
catastrophic accident which left her paralysed from the neck down.
Christine Leung, aged 37, who suffered similar, though even worse,
injuries after a motorway accident, received damages of #3.4m in an
action at the High Court in Birmingham.
For the loss of the ring finger of a dominant hand a Scottish court
will award about #3250 for solatium (pain and suffering), an English
court #11,500; for the loss of an eye, #20,000 in Scotland, and well
over #30,000 in England; loss of both legs about #50,000 in Scotland,
more than #85,000 in England; paraplegia, #70,000 in Scotland, up to
#90,000 under Criminal Injuries Compensation Board guidelines.
According to lawyers who specialise in the damages field, Scottish
courts have simply refused or been slow to accept the English example --
to the detriment of the public and the standing of Scottish justice.
In some areas both systems can be accused of being out of touch with
reality and expectations. In the case of awards for accidents which
result in death, the situation in England is governed by the 1976 Fatal
Accidents Act which laid down a standard award of #3500 -- raised to
#7500 within the past few years. Not much for the death of a loved one,
one might think; indeed, low enough to be regarded as an insult to the
surviving relatives.
In Scotland, the fixing of the amount for what the law calls loss of
society is broadly left to the judges. For the death of a beloved spouse
you will be given the princely sum of about #13,500.
English law seems more flexible in the types of award it is prepared
to recognise. For example, accident victims in England can claim damages
if their injuries mean that they have lost a job that they enjoyed. The
loss of congenial employment award can be worth #5000.
In Scotland, the courts take the view that this is not a separate
category of damages. Their approach is that this can be included in an
award for pain and suffering.
Scottish courts were also notoriously slow to recognise that relatives
should be compensated for the cost and time spent voluntarily caring for
relatives disabled by injury. It took legislation in the form of the
Administration of Justice Act 1982 to put the situation right.
The Scottish Law Commission, whose recommendations led to a change in
the law, stated: ''The approach of the Scottish courts to these problems
distinctly contrasts with that of the English courts which, in a series
of cases, have gone far to meet the specific problem of compensating, in
particular a husband or wife, who has incurred expense or who has
suffered loss of earnings in rendering services to an injured person.''
In assessing damages, courts look to see what has been awarded in
previous cases, and Glasgow solicitor Frank Maguire, of Robin Thompson
and Partners, says Scots cases of the past 30 or 40 years provide a
fairly miserly starting point.
''Scotland perhaps went on its own rather puritanical, presbyterian
way in the fifties and sixties and has never really caught up. I think
the English courts started from a higher level.
''The English approach involves looking at the problem and creating a
remedy. So when someone comes along and says 'I have not only lost my
job, but I really enjoyed it', the English courts will make an award for
that.''
A leading Queen's Counsel who has made a study of damages awards on
both sides of the Border agrees that Scotland has some catching up to
do.
''What does seem increasingly clear is that Scotland is again falling
behind England in the level of awards. The discrepancies are not only
over a wide field of injuries, but are very significant in the scale of
discrepancy of award. I have found no type of injury in which it was
clear that Scottish awards were significantly higher than in England.
''In all of the areas in which reasonable comparisons can be made, the
discrepancies which existed all point to English awards being higher.''
Following the Girvan case, one Court of Session lawyer described the
civil jury system as ''bonkers'' but if they spark a debate on damages
awards in Scotland the Girvan jurors will have done the legal system a
favour.

Do the names Skullsplitter, Dragonhead or Raven mean anything to you?
Although they could well be the latest superheroes in a computer game,
they are in fact the award-winning real ales produced at Britain's
most northerly brewery.
The Orkney Brewery, based in a converted schoolhouse at Quoyloo in
the west Mainland, was set-up 13 years ago by teetotal engineer Roger
White.
'We had come to Orkney on holiday and loved the place, the people and
the civilised way of life,' said Mr White.
While working in Oman, a farming article caught his eye in the
Orcadian weekly newspaper, which was regularly sent out to him.
'It said what a good idea it would be to set-up a brewery using
locally grown barley as a way of farming diversification. And I
thought - yes.'
In the event, Roger White discovered that Orcadian barley with its
short
growing season did not contain the right nitrogen levels for brewing.
But this obstacle was overcome and the brewery in an effort to keep up
with rising demand has recently undergone a 250,000 pounds expansion,
which should double production of its real ales.
The recipes for the four beers produced by the brewery - Dark Island,
Raven, Dragonhead and Skullsplitter - were all devised by Roger.
'It's a bit like baking a cake - it's a recipe like any other - but
you put your own stamp on it. You decide on your hops and malt, then
it's easy to work out how strong, dark or light the ale is to be.
'The taste is farily dependent on the barley. But the most important
ingredient of all is the water, and Orkney has great brewing water,'
he said.
Roger White was originally asked by CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale,
to
come up with a strong ale for a beer festival in Aberdeen. The result
was a beer containing 8.5% alcohol and aptly named Skullsplitter.
'I made the ale mainly as a 'winter warmer' but it's just gone on and
on. We now supply Safeway with a bottle version and the cask
Skullsplitter goes all over the country.'
The real ales, which have a loyal following all over Britain as well
as Canada and America, are part of the growing trend.
'There has been a real revolution in home-made jams, pickles, cheeses,
and local regional delicacies, because the public has
had enough of the mass-produced stuff.'
Roger is still quite amazed at the success of the brewery and
puts it down to luck and one vital ingredient.
'To be honest, nobody really knows when they start out on a business
venture where it's going to go. But one thing you can count on, the
Orkney name does sell a product. Put it on most things and you've got
a winner,' said Roger.

ANY Rip Van Winkle who was unaware that in the National Lottery we
have a new power in the land quickly would have learned otherwise had he
wakened in the Commons public gallery yesterday, having dropped off,
say, during the committee stage of Gladstone's Second Irish Home Rule
Bill in 1893.
MPs from all parts were jumping up and thanking the distributors of
lottery largesse for aiding local cricket or football teams or whatever
but, more often, complaining that a worthy local cause had not been
recognised by the distribution of some hard cash.
Sir Michael Jopling (Westmorland and Lonsdale -- Con.) complained that
out of 20 applications from Cumbria none had been successful. ''Will you
tell the Lottery Sports Fund that we are not offshore islands of the UK
and it is high time something was done,'' he fumed.
An even more annoyed Mr Gordon Prentice (Pendle -- Lab.) announced
that his area had secured a whopping #680,000, but the dastardly local
Liberal Democrats had broken the embargo on the announcement, tactfully
intended to be made the day after the local elections poll, and claimed
credit for the bonanza.
The National Heritage Department Ministers disclaimed responsibility
for the Lib Dems, whose sole representative in the Chamber, Ms Liz Lynne
from Rochdale, just down the road from Pendle, smiled complacently.
Mr Tony Banks (Newham North-West -- Lab.) observed that if his area
got #680,000, they would not mind if the Lib Dems announced it first.
The blameless National Heritage Ministers, who have no say in who gets
what, could only field the brickbats and reply as soothingly as
possible.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the National Heritage Secretary, suggested that
geographical inequalities would be sorted out over time. But that was no
good. MPs wanted their share and they wanted it now.
In a refreshing change from selfless devotion to their constituents'
needs, which the other MPs went on about, Mr Banks admitted that he was
an enthusiastic personal punter in the lottery ''looking forward to
winning the biggie so I could clear off to the Caribbean.''
The Tories thought this a desirable thing and cheered and waved their
order papers encouragingly. They should think again. Labour undoubtedly
would win the by-election, and Mr Banks's replacement is unlikely to be
so entertaining.
However, a more savage streak -- which he normally reserves for whale
killers -- showed when he took up with the Lord Chancellor's department
the remark of a Crown Court Recorder who told two defendants at
Winchester that, had they been Chelsea football supporters, he would
have jailed them.
''Outrageous and insulting to all decent Chelsea fans,'' foamed Mr
Banks, disregarding or unmoved by the possibility that Mr Nicholas
Atkinson, the QC in question, might be a Queens Park Rangers' fan. The
man must be called to account, demanded Mr Banks. He was told the Lord
Chancellor would be getting in touch with him.
Some Tories tried to enlist Mr Dorrell's support to help the British
film industry by encouraging the sale of the old Elstree lot to a
company keen to recapture past glories.
''Do you recall the great Ealing comedies?'' enquired Mr Harry
Greenway (Ealing North -- Con.). As Mr Dorrell was only four when Ealing
Studios were sold off to the BBC, his acquaintance with them was most
likely to be through television repeats and in any event, his
parliamentary performances give little hint of a taste for comedy.
One suspects a flutter on the lottery has become more appealing to
Ministers. With the Nolan restrictions soon to be in force, it might be
their best bet for a comfortable retirement after the next election.

LOCAL government must act now to stake out its position in relation to
a Scottish parliament, the new secretary-general of the Convention of
Scottish Local Authorities said yesterday.
Speaking to The Herald after his #80,000-a-year appointment was
unanimously approved by Cosla leaders, Mr Douglas Sinclair said councils
could not simply wait to see if a Scottish parliament was set up.
They must set out their own advance agenda on the constitutional issue
and ask, for example, what was the proper distribution of public
services in Scotland between councils and other agencies.
Some council leaders, although supporters of a Scottish parliament,
already have warned that it could draw powers from below and prove a
threat to local government. Mr Sinclair said he was very much aware of
these arguments.
''Cosla needs to start looking at this agenda and how it can influence
the dialogue with the political parties.''
Mr Sinclair, who is 49, currently ischief executive of Central Region
which is due to disappear under local government reorganisation.
His appointment, confirmed at a meeting of Cosla's executive committee
in Edinburgh, follows an announcement earlier this year that Mr Roy
MacIver, who has held the Cosla job since 1987, was planning to retire.
Last year, Cosla, whose headquarters is in Edinburgh, faced serious
internal problems when some former members of staff made claims of
bullying and sexual harassment.
Mr MacIver was not the subject of the complaints but a report by
Strathclyde Region's chief executive Neil McIntosh criticised his
''hands- off'' style of management.
The Convention now is in the process of reinventing itself as a new
slimmed-down organisation ready to meet the challenges of the move to
single-tier councils with perhaps half a dozen committees to replace its
present 13.
Mr Sinclair said: ''We are at a crossroads in local government. Not
only is local government reorgaisation going ahead at present which
presents a particular set of challenges for Cosla as an organisation,
but Cosla is also facing its own reorganisation to move forward with the
new councils into the next millennium.''

ARE Chinese tastes similar to those of Scots?
Bass seems to believe they have something in common and has decided to
establish a joint venture with the Ginsber Beer Company in Jilin
Province in North-east China to brew and market Tennent's Lager -- the
most popular brew in Scotland.
Tennent's was chosen after an extensive test-marketing programme.
The investment is #25m and will give Britain's biggest brewer a 55%
stake in a company which should double production over the next five
years. Currently it has a 1% share of the overall Chinese market which
is growing at a rate of 20% annually with Ginsber having current
production of the equivalent of 865,000 barrels (1400m litres).
China at present has some 850 breweries although per capita
consumption of 12 litres a year is only an eighth of that of Europe.
Bass, which will have management control of the Bass Ginsber Beer
Company, will be able to use its undoubted expertise in exploiting the
economies of scale and brand building.
* GASES group BOC is also increasing its investment in the same
general area of China with the establishment of Shenyang BOC Gases in
the heavily-industrialised Liaoning Province.

NYNEX CableComms, the latest cable television to call on UK investors
to help it finance the cost of setting up its network, has opted for a
careful approach in the face of investors caution in the sector.
It is aiming to raise between #400m and #460m by issuing shares at a
significant discount to market leader Telewest, the first cable operator
to float.
Like most of the other companies, CableComms is an American company,
an offshoot of NYNEX, a major New York telephone operator, which will
retain two-thirds of the equity.
The 305 million shares will be sold at 131p to 151p, the exact level
to be fixed according to demand on June 8, with unconditional dealings
beginning on June 14.
At 131p they would sell at a 22% discount to Telewest at last Friday's
closing price of 156p, though yesterday Telewest picked up to 162p,
increasing the discount.
Telewest was floated last November at 182p and initial enthusiasm saw
the shares rise to 220p before investor disenchantment set in. General
Cable was issued last month at 190p, well below the original hope of
between 220p and 250p.
CableComms will also be marketed in New York but in view of the
relative lack of enthusiasm for the sector there the proportion is
limited to 40%, against 50% for General Cable.
CableComms has a strong regional presence in the north-west of
England. It has 10 franchises in and around Manchester covering
1,700,000 homes. It has six other franchises, one in Derby, two in
London and the rest along the south coast of England.
In total it has 2,700,000 homes available to market its services to, a
figure only a little smaller than Telewest's. Installing the cable
network is now well under way.
The cable companies have to invest large sums upfront to build their
networks before they can earn a penny and so cannot be valued on
conventional ways. So CableComms is being valued using Telewest as a
benchmark. At a share price of 131p, its possible customer base is
valued at $360 per home against Telewest's $446.
''I think we've priced this at a realistic level . . . the market has
been rebounding somewhat recently,'' said chief executive Eugene
Connell.
But analysts are a little worried by the explicit benchmarking to
Telewest. One pointed out: ''If the Telewest share price now goes down
it could mean they've got problems.''
Consumers have been less keen to sign up for cable than they have in
the US partly because reception from conventional television is better
here. The companies hope that the industry will follow satellite in
starting off slowly but expanding rapidly once cable is more common.
The long-term potential scope for inter-active use is considerable and
one that is largely denied broadcast television. Hopes that providing
telephone services via cable would prove a money spinner have faded
somewhat as BT has improved its competitiveness, but at least telephony
is a proven growth market.
The lossmaking nature of the industry in this stage of its development
was shown in General Cable's first quarter results yesterday which
showed losses doubled to #6.35m, though revenue rose 67%.

LORD Nolan's watchdog committee investigating ''sleaze'' meets today
to decide which aspect of public life to examine next, as pressure
mounts for an inquiry into funding of political parties.
Downing Street yesterday made clear that an investigation into party
funds was strictly outside the committee's remit.
However, Opposition members of the committee, including Labour's Peter
Shore and Liberal Democrat peer Lord Thomson of Monifieth, are set to
press for an inquiry into party funding.
They want to expose the alleged link between corporate donations to
the Conservative party and those receiving honours and other political
favours.
The Tories fiercely oppose such an inquiry and former party chairman
Lord Parkinson yesterday warned that it could affect the result of a
General Election.
Party chairman Jeremy Hanley accused Labour of ''hypocrisy'' after it
emerged that two low-profile organisations had been set up to attract
donations for the Labour Party.
The Industrial Research Trust was set up two years ago to channel
donations to support the offices of Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Robin
Cook, while Common Campaign, a public company, was established to raise
money and encourage endorsements for Labour at the next election.
Fresh squabbling over what direction Lord Nolan's committee should
take will come next as MPs prepare to debate the first report in the
Commons on Thursday.
The depth of Tory opposition to any inquiry into party political
funding became apparent yesterday as Lord Parkinson claimed it could
affect the next general election.
''If you head into that in the run-up to an election, you could
actually be accused of affecting the result of the election and
interfering in politics,'' he said on BBC Radio 4.
However, he then suggested it was an area that could be investigated
after an election.
Mr Hanley attacked Labour after it was disclosed that two low profile
bodies were quietly raising funds for the party.
''All it shows is the hypocrisy of the party political nature of the
battle that Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw particularly is trying to
wage,'' he told BBC Radio 4's The World At One.
''We believe that individuals have a right to privacy as to how and
where they spend their money.''
On donations to the Tory Party, Mr Hanley said: ''Government ministers
don't know who gives money to the Conservative Party through
Conservative Central Office.
''If an individual gives money to Conservative Central Office, that is
a matter for party funding. Not a single element of influence is bought.
''The Labour Party have 70% of their votes bought by unions giving
money.''
Mr Straw rejected the charge of hypocrisy.
''We would be delighted for there to be the fullest possible inquiry
into all sources of funds for the Labour Party, and that's the big
divide between us and the Conservative Party,'' he told the same
programme.

A WOMAN who is seven-months' pregnant was robbed of a four-figure sum
of money yesterday as she took a firm's takings into a Glasgow bank.
The 24-year-old, who was accompanied by a 28-year-old female
colleague, had the money in a case chained to her wrist.
The two women parked their car outside the Duke Street branch of the
Bank of Scotland yesterday morning. As they left the car a man snatched
the case and ran off. Orange dyes were released from the case, but the
man escaped.
Neither of the women was injured but both were shocked and the
pregnant woman was detained in Rottenrow Maternity Hospital for
observation.
Superintendent Louis Munn said last night that police crime prevention
officers could give advice to firms about delivering takings. He added:
''We always advise that people depositing money in such a manner are fit
to do so.''
The firm, which asked not to be named, has offered a ''substantial''
reward for information about the incident.

LEGAL action to prevent the phasing out of sleeper services stopping
at Carlise came a step closer yesterday. Council leaders from Dumfries
and Galloway and Cumbria failed to change ScotRail's mind over
withdrawing the Carlisle-based sleeper carriages as part of plans to axe
the Fort William-London sleeper service.
The Court of Session has reprieved the service pending a consultation
process. Now the possibility of similar action in England cannot be
ruled out. At present, passengers join the sleeping carriages during the
evening when they are parked at Carlisle.
ScotRail wants to withdraw the carriages, and passengers would have to
board the train on its arrival late at the night. On the return journey,
they would either disembark from the sleeper at 4.35am -- or remain on
board until the train arrived in Glasgow. They would then travel back to
Carlisle at 7.10am. Dumfries and Galloway region said the delegation
left ''disappointed'' from talks with ScotRail director Mr John Ellis.

<HEADLINE>Heseltine could be new Tory chairman.  Reshuffle speculation grows</HEADLINE>

RESHUFFLE speculation was growing at Westminster last night, with Mr
Michael Heseltine taking star billing as the possible new Tory Party
chairman.
Even right-wing MPs are beginning to think that he might provide them
with the best chance of retaining their seats in a General Election.
Last July, the Prime Minister offered him the job, but Mr Heseltine
was reluctant to relinquish his declared first love as President of the
Board of Trade -- selling British industry abroad and creating jobs.
Last night, Tory MPs were thinking that if the Prime Minister could
find a role for him that would allow him to continue his interest in
this sphere and rally the Tory Party for the General Election a deal
might be done.
As yet, there is no consideration given to Mr Heseltine being given
the status of deputy Prime Minister, as Margaret Thatcher accorded to
Viscount Whitelaw.
However, in the turmoil of backbench opinion since the debacle of the
local government elections, radical thinking is emerging.
The present party chairman, Mr Jeremy Hanley, is considered to have
failed the Prime Minister over the task of reviving Tory Party fortunes,
and Tory MPs now are concentrating on how to avoid a disaster at the
next General Election.
Mr Heseltine and his cohorts are taking no part in this speculation so
far.
Yesterday the chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, Sir
Marcus Fox, took his colleagues to lunch with the Prime Minister at
No.10, but a reshuffle was not discussed.
Sir Marcus emerged from the lunch insisting the meeting was long
planned and in no way connected with the local election results.
He refused to give details of the discussions, but said: ''We talked
about all sorts of problems and what needs to be done to get our party
back on course.
''We are particularly concerned about the support that has drifted
away from us and our concern is to get it back and look after those who
feel badly done by. We would be failing in our duty if we were not
looking at where we were going wrong.
''There has been no Prime Minister in my 25 years here who has
listened more carefully. He makes a contribution and we were all
extremely pleased at the way it went.''
The message that was given to the Prime Minister was that his housing
White Paper, scheduled for the end of this month, must address the
problems of local authorities and ''negative equity'' problems of Tory
supporters throughout the land who find themselves with mortgages bigger
than the value of their properties.
This White Paper is likely to enhance private property developers'
ability to buy land and start building again. There is no consideration
being given to the prospect of the proceeds of council house sales,
amounting to #9bn over the years, being released to local authorities to
build houses.
Most of this money, it was emerging last night, has been used to pay
off local authority debt.
Like his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, the Prime Minister may find
it hard to resist the media speculation about a reshuffle.
It was clear last night that he has not addressed this problem, but he
may be forced to do so next month in the wake of the Perth and Kinross
by-election next week, or at least in July before Parliament rises for
the long summer recess.
The Scott Report on the arms-to-Iraq affair looks like being delayed
until the autumn, so the Prime Minister cannot take that into account
for a ministerial reshuffle this summer.
The one Cabinet Minister who is squeaky clean on this Iraq inquiry is
Mr Heseltine. And that could be the telling point for Mr Major when he
considers who should be his General Election party chairman.
* Conservatives must unite behind the Prime Minister, junior Minister
Robin Squire said last night.
He told Westminster Young Conservatives: ''Not only is such unity
essential, but most Conservatives remember how obvious Labour Party
divisions in the 1970s and 1980s ensured that they remained in
Opposition.''
Mr Squire admitted there were ''several'' causes of party
unpopularity, but said broad policy on the economy, Europe and education
were correct.

Elizabeth Buie reports on the determination that took mountaineer
Alison Hargreaves to the top of the world and is driving her on to other
Himalayan challenges
WHAT kind of woman climbs Everest by the north ridge, alone, and
without artificial oxygen? Only a woman with tremendous mental and
physical endurance, it appears.
Alison Hargreaves, 32, mother of two young children and one of the few
professional mountaineers in Britain, has just climbed her way into
mountaineering history by becoming only the second solo climber, and the
first woman, to have made the climb up the north ridge of the world's
highest mountain with no artificial oxygen or sherpas to carry her
gear.Her husband, Jim Ballard, also a climber, believes she is ''as near
as one can be to a genius''.
''When you see her going on a mountain, she changes. She is what used
to be called a 'child of nature'. She looks as if she has always been at
one there,'' he said.
Hargreaves' ascent of Everest was the culmination of stamina, physical
endurance, and fitness, built up over many years climbing the toughest
Alpine peaks. But much of her training in the past year has been done
from the Nevis range ski centre beside Aonach Mor. Marian Austin, who
runs the ski school there, says that Alison and her family moved to
Spean Bridge so she could have easy access to the Scottish mountains.
''All winter, when the weather was bad, she would go running or
mountain-biking. When the weather was suitable on the hills she would
climb up with her skis on her back and then ski down. The ice climbs in
the corries here are nothing like the heights in the Himalayas, but
there is very easy access because of the ski lifts,'' said Austin.
''She runs first thing in the morning, then feeds her kids and gets
them to school, and then she's off to the hills. One of her kids, Tom,
goes to school, but Kate has been coming up the mountain. She learnt to
ski at three.''
Fellow mountaineers say that Alison likes to climb on her own because
she can travel more quickly and more lightly, allowing her to get in and
out of danger areas. What most admire in her, however, is her mental
attitude -- her determination and doggedness.
Born in Belper, Derbyshire, she began climbing in the Peak District as
a schoolgirl and was initially quite a good rock climber, although not
one of the very best, said Ian Smith, deputy editor of High magazine, a
friend and fellow member of the Sheffield-based climbing
fraternity.''Then she discovered the mountains and got heavily involved
in trips to the Alps,'' he said.
It was six years ago that Hargreavesmade her now-famous ascent of the
north face of the Eiger while six months pregnant with her son Tom. She
became the first British woman to scale the six north faces of the Alps
solo and in one summer. There followed the ''free, solo'' ascent of the
Croz Spur, near Chamonix in the French Alps, which is considered a world
climb. An attempt last year on Everest was unsuccessful, largely because
she was driven back by the cold.
This year's attempt was earlier in the season and blessed by
relatively good weather. But while mountaineers throughout the world
have been paying tribute to this achievement, their eyes are also
trained on Hargreaves's next two planned solo ascents -- K2, the second
highest mountain in the world, but far more technically demanding, and
Kangchenjunga in India, the third highest.
Alison Hargreaves is at the level of mountaineering where her fitness
is taken for granted. Her friend, Ian Smith, says she would not have
needed to undertake any special training for Everest -- what counts is
the supreme mental control she demonstrated when climbing the Croz Spur,
unroped, in the French Alps.
''A lot of people would struggle to do it roped. You need the mental
control to hold it together on very thin ice,'' he said.He describes her
as ''just driven: very ambitious, very confident and very fit''.
''That is unusual for a woman mountaineer. A lot of her
characteristics are very common among male mountaineers. Even in recent
times there have not been many women with her sort of drive and
determination,'' added Smith.
Bob Reid, former president of the Mountaineering Council of Scotland,
says that this single-minded determination can be interpreted by some
people as selfishness. Mountaineering does, after all, involve risk and
the potential of death. Perhaps it is this demonstration of complete
single-mindedness on a dangerous ascent that so impresses a veteran
mountaineer like Hamish MacInnes.
''Her mental achievement is tremendous -- particularly the fact that
she has kids and she is willing and capable of going out on her own,''
he said.
Judging from her first message back this weekend -- ''To Tom and Kate,
my two children. I am on top of the world and I love you dearly'' -- her
mind during those final stages of the ascent was on her children.
The last 3000ft of Everest's north ridge are generally acknowledged as
a long, slow and gradual incline, with only a very short, steep pass at
the end. The mountaineer at this stage has to find the strength and
determination to keep putting one foot in front of the other. He or she
will manage 10 steps, then have to stop and rest.At that altitude, and
with no artificial oxygen, climbing 10ft feels like the equivalent of
100ft on a Scottish mountain.
Chris Bonington, the Everest veteran, said that climbing from the
north side of Everest was not only much harder, but also much colder and
much windier than from the south.
''She would have been pushing herself to the absolute limit. For every
one person who climbs without oxygen, there are probably ten to 20 who
climb it with oxygen. It is a completely different ballgame. Without
oxygen you are climbing very much more slowly. Every single step is much
more of an effort. It is a combination of both physical and mental
perseverance.
''She turned back last time because she was climbing in autumn when it
just gets too cold, and there is a much higher risk of getting
frostbite. She showed her maturity and mountain judgment by coming back
early then,'' said Bonington.
Dehydration can also be a problem.''It is a matter of looking after
yourself and doing what you can to replace lost fluids. First, all your
liquid comes from melted snow or ice -- and that takes much longer to
melt at high altitude. Also, at higher altitude, water boils at a lower
temperature, so it is not so hot. This can produce problems in cooking
some things,'' added Bonington.
Hargreaves would have been carrying the minimum of food required --
and it would have been vegeterian because of the family's convictions,
her husband said yesterday.
The question she will now have to address is whether she can find the
same mental and physical stamina to face two further climbs this summer.
But her reputation is now made.As Ian Smith said: ''This climb was truly
world-class -- it was not just good for a Brit, or a woman, it was
genuinely world-class stuff.''
As the only professional woman mountaineer in Britain, Hargreaves
earns her living solely from climbing -- the bulk of it from
sponsorship, and some from lecturing and writing. Her newfound fame,
however, means she will have the freedom to climb where she wants -- not
where she has to.
Her husband is a well-known climbing photographer, but is content, for
now, to take a back seat. Yesterday, Britain's press clamouring for
further interviews from him, had to wait until he had completed his
shift supervising the local playgroup.
''There is no doubt in my mind that I will be very lucky if I see
another climber of Alison's all-round talent in my climbing lifetime,''
he said -- a tribute from husband to wife, one climber to another.

Seals being cared for at an island rescue centre are about to enjoy
the taste of fish prepared in their very own kitchen.
Support from a charity better known for its efforts on behalf of
endangered species such as tigers and elephants has helped pay for a
badly-needed expansion at the unit.
A stable once used to house heavy horses has been converted into a
kitchen where herring - bought a tonne at a time from Shetland - can be
prepared under hygienic conditions for injured and orphaned seals.
Maureen Bain, who helps run South Ronaldsay-based Orkney Seal Rescue
said the food-preparation area will prove invaluable.
Since June last year, the centre has cared for 24 common and 17 grey
seals.
''The maximum we can take at one time is is 10, but there have been
occasions when we've had as many as 18 in,'' she said.
''That was bordering on the ridiculous and it didn't help that we were
having to get their food ready close to the tanks we keep them in.
''We're having to chop up fish and cope with dirty dishes and tubes
used to feed them when they're very young all in the same area.
It makes things difficult and isn't as hygienic as we would like.
Having a separate kitchen will help enormously.'' Phase one of the
conversion work on the stable is almost complete.
The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals donated
1,000 pounds, while the international animal welfare charity Care for
the Wild came up with around 8,000 pounds to pay for building work and
provide sinks, work tops and deep freezes for the herring.
CFTW decided to support the venture after sending a team to Shetland
as part of the bird and animal rescue effort that followed the grounding
of the Braer.
''Our people were working alongside Ross Flett, from Orkney Seal
Rescue, who had paid to be there out of his own pocket,'' said the
charity's operations manager, Tim van Lochem.
''We realised that his own centre is effectively run by two extremely
dedicated people who spend their lives struggling to save animals that
are often desperately in need of help.
''They are very serious about what they do and fully deserved our
support and that's why we held an appeal to raise money to help their
work.''
Orkney Seal Rescue is raising a further 8,000 pounds to pay for
accommodation for an extra 10 seals in the remaining area of the stable.

<HEADLINE>Dog to be put down after second attack</HEADLINE>

A DOG whose life was saved by campaigners after she bit a policeman is
to be put down by her owners after she carried out a second attack.
Saaba, an alsatian, had been sentenced to death by magistrates for
biting the policeman as he tried to catch her after she slipped out of
her garden in Chatham, Kent.
Her owners, Mr Philip Dole and his wife, Carol, mounted a campaign to
save her and enlisted the support of writers Jilly Cooper and Carla
Lane, former Tory Minister Alan Clark, and film star Brigitte Bardot.
Thousands signed a petition, asking for the Dangerous Dogs Act to be
changed, and Saaba eventually gained a reprieve after crown court
appeals.
However, last Friday she attacked a woman water board official who
called at the Doles' house, biting her on the arms and legs.
The couple's solicitor, Mr Trevor Cooper, said yesterday that the
offical did not require stitches.
''Saaba gave birth to eight puppies on Sunday May 7 and a day before
the incident happened almost half the litter had died of natural
causes,'' said Mr Cooper. ''Animal experts believe Saaba may have seen
the lady as a potential threat to her remaining litter.''
He added that Mrs Dole, who was ''devastated'' by the incident, had
always maintained that, if her dog should attack someone, she would have
no hesitation in taking the appropriate steps.

<HEADLINE>Lang annoyed by claims of splits over devolution</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang yesterday showed growing irritation over
allegations of high-level splits in his party over devolution -- which
overshadowed the Scottish Conservatives' annual conference last week,
creating headlines which continue to dog the party's fortunes in the
Perth and Kinross by-election.
The Conservatives, now trailing third behind the SNP and Labour in the
constituency according to some polls, were forced by the growing rumours
of a rethink in some senior quarters to relaunch their by-election
campaign with 10 days to go.
Mr Lang appeared alongside candidate John Godfrey as both reaffirmed
that their tactics are built on an absolute rejection of major
constitutional change.
However, Mr Lang directed much of his fire at the media, calling some
stories a ''tissue of journalism,''
Of the suggestion that Home Office Minister and Stirling MP Michael
Forsyth openly is angling for the top job at St Andrew's House by
hinting that the constitutional status quo is no longer an option, Mr
Lang said to journalists: ''You are having your fun -- it's that time of
the year.
''This whole story about disagreements and division on view is a
complete invention. Malcolm Rifkind made clear yesterday how badly
distorted his words were. These divisions do not exist, the party is
united behind the current policy.''
An aside by Mr Lang about Mr Forsyth offering advice from his distant
position at the Home Office in London was taken as implying that the
controversial right-winger should keep his nose out of Scottish affairs
for the time being.
The Scottish Secretary did say: ''I had Michael Forsyth in my team for
two years and very much valued his support and help. We worked well
together then.''
It was put to Mr Lang that Mr Forsyth's time as Scottish party
chairman had been a period of great tension among activists north of the
Border. How did he react to that and the prospect of Mr Forsyth
returning to the forefront of the Scottish political scene? ''I can't
remember that far back,'' Mr Lang said.
The Scottish Secretary pointed his fire at the SNP's ''destructive and
negative'' creed, which, he said, was alien to Perth and Kinross voters.
He said that its candidate's stance on the monarchy showed how out of
touch the SNP was.
''Only one party in this by-election can be trusted to maintain
Scotland's place as a full and equal partner in the UK,'' Mr Lang said.
Mr Godfrey said he was delighted by last week's conference and its
strong reaffirmation of the Union which had been spelled out in
crystal-clear terms by both the Prime Minister and the Scottish
Secretary in stark contrast to the dangers of separatism and Labour's
constitutional fudge.
He said: ''There is no middle ground. Either we move down the road to
independence or we maintain Scotland's place within the UK as a full and
equal partner. To create a Scottish parliament, the halfway house
offered by Labour and the Liberals, is merely to catch a bus to
independence which travels via devolution.''
Yesterday's theme from the SNP campaign was the alleged damage
threatened to the Scottish tourism industry by what the Government was
doing to the rail network.
Candidate Roseanna Cunningham said that as someone fortunate enough to
attend the previous evening's gala film premiere in Edinburgh of Rob Roy
it had been brought home to her the importance of tourism to Scotland.
However, British Rail was using a poster of a scene at Lochaber to
advertise Motorail services which were about to be axed.
She was supported by SNP parliamentary leader Margaret Ewing, who said
only an SNP victory in the by-election would send out a message to the
Government on its rail policies.
Referring to the suggestion that Mr Forsyth may be set to return to a
Government post in Scotland she said: ''I don't think moving people
around in the Cabinet will make any difference to their fortunes because
public antagonism to their policies in Scotland is so strong.''
The party's chief executive, Mr Michael Russell scorned the idea,
saying: ''When Michael Forsyth seeks to pour oil on troubled waters he
tends to set fire to it shortly afterwards.''
He added that, in spite of recent poll indications, the SNP still was
treating the Tory holders of the seat as its main challengers.
This was flatly contradicted by Labour candidate Douglas Alexander,
who said the Tories had dropped out of the race and the gap between
Labour and the SNP frontrunners was 10% and closing.
He was supported by Labour Front Bencher Brian Wilson, who said that a
Nationalist victory would be a one-day wonder. ''The real shock waves
would be created under the Tories if Perth and Kinross backed Tony
Blair's Labour Party and that is now a real possibility.''
Mr Wilson pointed out that during the Criminal Justice Act debate the
Tories had abolished the right to silence on the grounds that those with
nothing to hide had nothing to fear.
Turning to the question of a funding of political parties, Mr Wilson
asked: ''Will they now apply the same principle to Lord Nolan's desire
to investigate party funding or will they insist on their own right to
silence, on the grounds that they have a great deal to hide and much to
fear?''
Liberal Democrat Defence spokesman Menzies Campbell, supporting
candidate Veronica Linklater, attacked SNP policy on defence as neither
credible nor realistic, pointing out that it had campaigned to save
Rosyth when its anti-nuclear policies would close both Faslane and
Rosyth.
Mrs Linklater told the news conference that she was making crime a
central part of her campaign because she believed this was one of the
biggest issues on the streets. As a prison reformer, she said longer
sentences were expensive and counter-productive and money would be
better spent on prevention measures such as close- circuit TV schemes in
town centres.

GLASGOW city-centre traffic was severely disrupted during the morning
rush-hour yesterday after members of the anti-M77 environmental group,
Glasgow Earth First, and supporters chained themselves across one of the
most heavily-polluted streets in Europe.
Police, using bolt-cutters, broke up the demonstration at the junction
of Hope Street and Bath Street after the road was closed for around 25
minutes. They arrested eight men and three women, who are expected to
appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court today on breach of the peace,
obstruction, and police assault charges.
The protest, on Climate Alliance Action Day, was aimed at highlighting
the health problems caused by car pollutants. A recent air quality
survey showed Hope Street to be the most polluted street in Scotland.
Strathclyde Police said they had to divert several dozen officers from
other divisions to break up the demonstration.
One of the protesters, Mrs Rosemary Kane, a mother-of-two, said: ''I
am just a concerned person. I come from Pollok and the building of the
M77 has made me more aware of environmental problems. This is something
we must address. I have got two small kids and I have got major concerns
about their futures. I feel I must come and do this at least for them.
''My awareness was awakened by the M77 protest and we are now moving
on to the M74, which is in the planning stages.
''Hope Street is the most highly polluted street in the whole of
Europe and nothing is being done about it.''
Mr Alan Miller, of Lambie and Co, who is representing the protesters
detained by the police, said he had been instructed to enter pleas of
not guilty on behalf of his clients and to apply for bail.
He added: ''It seems to be that almost without exception, anyone
arrested in connection with the M77 is being detained overnight for
court the following day, despite often having been in no trouble with
the law before and generally being of good character.
''This does seem to be an automatic reaction and decision from the
police -- arrest, detain, and hold for court the following day -- and it
is of some concern.''

LOOKING for all the world like a piece of jigsaw escaped from its box,
Stronsay -- the Island of the Three Bays -- is one of the most fertile
and successfully farmed areas in the North of Scotland -- rightly
claiming credit for having pioneered many of the modern farming methods
introduced to Orkney.
The island is about seven miles long from north to south and as a
result of its straggly configuration has often been described as ''all
arms and legs''. Although it is generally low-lying, with its highest
point scarcely over 150ft, Stronsay has spectacular cliffs and rock
stacks (once the refuge of early Christian hermits) along its east
shore.
Two great changes have affected life on Stronsay this century. First
the decline in herring fishing in the 1930s saw the importance and the
prosperity of Whitehall village on the north coast of the island
diminish rapidly.
Thousands of transient herring workers used to make their way to
Stronsay to work in the curing stations and so many boats crammed the
harbour it was possible on Sundays to walk from Whitehall to the
neighbouring isle of Papa Stronsay across the decks of the anchored
fleet.
In addition dramatic changes in farming practice have affected the
island. It is said that a century ago more than 150,000 people worked on
the land in Scotland while today that figure is less than 26,000. This
drift from the land, the loss of small farms through amalgamation and
mechanisation, has been experienced everywhere, even in a compact and
efficient agricultural community like Stronsay. Kelp gathering and the
export of peat have also played their part in years past.
However, most are agreed that farming remains the key to the island's
future and local councillor George Stevenson confirms that there are
anxieties: ''At present Stronsay is being very successfully farmed
indeed but there is concern. The older folk just don't see where the
next generation of farmers is coming from.''
The population of Stronsay hovers around the 370 mark and once again
the social changes experienced on other islands are to be found here.
Latest estimates suggest that around 30% of the population are
non-Orcadian.
Nevertheless there are indicators which suggest that this community is
in good heart despite the economic uncertainties. Pride and joy of the
islanders is their swimming pool, funded by a community effort which
raised #50,000, and functions on Stronsay are generally well attended.
In addition, while the herring industry is now history, there is a
realisation that the stories and images of those exciting ''boom'' years
could provide a focus for the increasing number of tourists who are
finding their way out to Stronsay.
An imaginative proposal to transform the old fish market at the pier
head at Whitehall village (founded by an ex-privateer in the 1670s) into
an interpretation centre has been under discussion and now the islanders
are looking to see where funding might come from and attempting to
produce detailed proposals of how the project might operate.
In turn it's hoped that such a venture would regenerate the village,
landfall for most island visitors and currently, according to George
Stevenson, ''having too many empty houses and being badly in need of a
facelift''.
Unlike some of the other North Isles you sense a coyness about the way
in which folk promote their island's natural wonders and historical
treasures, because, make no mistake, there is plenty to shout about in
Stronsay.
Endearing it may be, but with competition growing every summer between
the North Isles to attract visitors a harder, more businesslike approach
may be necessary.
Ralph Fotheringham, retired builder and enthusiast for Stronsay's
history and heritage, says the advent in the 1990s of the ro-ro ferries
has been a double-edged sword for the island.
''It's a smashing development as far as the islanders are concerned
but it hasn't really been designed with tourism in mind -- at least as
far as Stronsay is concerned -- for the simple reason that you can't
leave Kirkwall in the morning and get back that same night. That would
need to be looked at.''
Once on Stronsay there is wealth of places to visit. Set on the shores
of Mill Bay is a bird reserve run by the ornithological artist John
Holloway and his family. Cliff birds and waders are found around the
island and in spring and autumn easterly winds often bring more unusual
species such as wrynecks and redbacked shrikes.
Heather moorland, heath, and marshy areas ensure an abundance of wild
flowers together with enough mosses and lichens to delight the amateur
botanist. Stronsay also has its share of ancient settlements, brochs,
hermitages, iron age villages, and tombs. Most of the sites lie
tantalisingly unexcavated, awaiting the time when money becomes more
readily available for digs in such remote locations.
It seems certain, whatever shape the Orkney economy takes in the next
century, that Stronsay will be an important piece in that particular
jigsaw.

TOURIST chiefs said last night they were ''disappointed'' that they
had not been invited to take part in the American promotion of the next
big Scottish epic, Braveheart, starring Mel Gibson which opens this week
in the United States.
As a big clean-up operation started in Edinburgh's Princes Street
Gardens yesterday, in the wake of the premier party to promote the film
Rob Roy, the spotlight now turns to the Gibson film.
Expected to be a massive hit, the film chronicles the life and times
of Scottish hero William Wallace. It was shot partly in Scotland but
mostly in Ireland, because the film makers were offered a better
financial package to move there.
The European film premier of Braveheart is expected to be in Stirling
or Edinburgh later this year. Other films shot in Scotland and due to
open this year include Mary Riley, which is set in Edinburgh and stars
Julia Roberts, and Loch Ness, starring Ted Danson.
The Scottish Tourist Board said that, despite Braveheart's anticipated
box-office success, it saw the lack of promotion during the film's
American screenings as a lost opportunity for Scotland.
The STB compared that with the co-operation, help, and promotion it
had received from the film makers behind Rob Roy, which starred Liam
Neeson.
Ms Alice Wood, deputy director of international marketing with the
STB, said she was sure all the films coming to Scotland would boost the
tourist trade.
However, she added that she had been left disappointed at the lack of
promotion of Scotland during Braveheart.
''We received great co-operation with Rob Roy when it opened in New
York in April.
''We had a movie hotline where nearly half a million people buying
tickets for the film got the chance to win a holiday to Scotland.
''We were also allowed to put a slide on screen promoting Scotland as
the land of Rob Roy before the film started and postcards were given out
at 20 cities in America promoting Scotland.
''With Braveheart, the distributors in America didn't contact us at
all. That did disappoint us, because that would be another great film to
promote Scotland.
''We didn't contact them at the time because we were putting all our
efforts behind Rob Roy. Despite that, we could have been keen to use
Braveheart to help promote Scotland.
''Obviously, with parts of Braveheart being filmed in Ireland the
setting is not 100% authentic Scotland.
''However, in Rob Roy the real star was the panoramic vistas of
Scotland and although I haven't seen Braveheart, I'm sure the beauty of
Scotland is highlighted there too.''
* Although Rob Roy director Michael Caton-Jones was surrounded by
stars at his film's premier in Edinburgh, he didn't forget his school
chums from Bathgate, West Lothian. Ten of them with whom he still keeps
in touch and who are regulars in the Volunteer Bar, Bathgate, were given
tickets for the film's screening and the after-film party.

At the very heart of the North Isles about 14 miles north-east of
Kirkwall, lies Eday, the isthmus isle of the Norsemen. Much to the
amusement of visitors, it boasts a London Airport.
Eday should be well placed to benefit from the growth of tourism in
Orkney, which continues to flourish against the national trend. But it
is also striving to create for itself a fresh identity following decades
of social upheaval which now finds almost two-thirds of the population
of 140 born outwith Orkney.
While there are a number of very progressive agricultural businesses
on the isle, many new arrivals who have purchased farms do not see
working the land as a priority and as a result Eday has not kept pace
with the rest of Orkney or Scotland.
In a sense Eday is caught between two cultures. Physically it belongs
with the larger isles like Sanday and Stronsay but in population terms
it is a small island with all the economic uncertainties this brings.
Joann Paterson, chairman of the island's community council, has no
doubt about the effect of the social changes: ''On the island of Eday
there are now only three houses with Orcadians farming -- 100 years ago
there would easily have been 30 farms worked by Orcadian families.
'' Of course we would like to get more farmland into use but we can
neither tell the older folk who they should sell to nor take it from the
folk that now have it.''
It's not so many years since there were four shops on the island. Now
there is one, run by Eday Community Enterprise, which also operates a
small hostel in the former community hall. As elsewhere the arrival of
the ro-ro ferries has brought the island closer to Kirkwall but it has
also meant money leaving the island as people shop in town.
The Community Enterprise has brought a couple of full-time jobs and
other part-time work. Chairman Malcolm Scott feels the future is
reasonably bright. ''There is nothing really to be gloomy about. For
example, the ro-ro did not hit us as badly as we feared it might.
However, I think everyone agrees that the shortage of young people on
the island is a matter of concern.''
As elsewhere in the North Isles, all sorts of methods are being
considered to try to broaden the base of the island's economy.
Local councillor George Stevenson points to the recently established
fish farming operation on Eday.
''This is not only providing employment but increases the flow of
business to and from Kirkwall. There is relative shelter round about
Eday because of its location among the isles and clearly there might be
scope for further development in this area.''
Tourism is likely to bolster local income over the next few years but
ro-ro has meant that the island is seeing more day trippers with a
consequent loss of overnight stays and car hire.
Various ways of encouraging visitors to remain longer on the island
are constantly under consideration.
Already in place, and a bonus for the backpackers, is a splendid and
well-signposted heritage walk around the north end of the island,from
Eday's low-lying midriff to the spectacular sandstone cliffs to the
north.
Every aspect of the island's history and activity can be explored on a
trek of almost five miles -- tombs, ancient earthworks, cliff scenery,
plant and animal life, and dominating the scene the Stone of Setter.
In an archipelago of impressive standing stones this is the tallest at
nearly 15ft.
Over the centuries it has stood silent witness to the island's
changing fortunes and it could be that the next decade will be more
important than any that have gone before.

AN A-listed Edinburgh church which houses unique murals could now be
used as a new centre for the arts.
A study into the future use of Mansfield Place Church at Bellevue, on
the edge of the city's historic New Town, has been commissioned by those
keen to preserve the historic building, which contains religious murals
by artist Phoebe Traquair.
Edinburgh District Council has invested #5000 in a feasibility study
over possible uses of the church.
The findings will be presented at a special meeting next month but it
is understood the favoured option will be that of a special arts centre.
Representatives of the Traquair Trust and Lothian and Edinburgh
Enterprise Ltd are among those expected to attend.
Chairman of the Friends of Mansfield Place Church, Mr Ian Dunn, said
around 30 different suggestions had been made over the possible use of
the 17,000sq ft building.
''We understand that out of the 30 suggestions, it has been honed down
to a civic centre and a centre for the applied arts.''
The church, marketed by London and Edinburgh Equity, is thought to be
on sale for offers over #350,000.
Phoebe Traquair was born in Dublin in 1852 but lived in Edinburgh
until her death in 1936. She took seven years to complete the 30ft
murals in Mansfield Place Church.
They depict a host of religious figures in blue, crimson, and gold
which have gradually deteriorated in the unused building.
Edinburgh District Council's planning committee last month agreed to
spend nearly #9000 on emergency repairs to the artwork in the empty
church building -- to be carried out soon by Historic Scotland. A
further #500 was given by the Friends of Mansfield Place Church.
Extensive areas of the murals are thought to have been lost due to
water staining and unstable plasterwork.

SCOTTISH Labour MP Sam Galbraith today will put forward proposals to
give the new Environmental Protection Agency extensive powers which he
claims might have prevented the recent flooding in Paisley and
Kirkintilloch.
The Strathkelvin and Bearsden MP will propose amendments to the
Environment Bill which would allow the agency to inspect waterways and
culverts. He said that if these powers had been available, they might
have prevented the flooding at Ferguslie Park, Paisley.
This would be followed by widers powers both to the agency and local
authorities dealing with building on the flood plain and flood
prevention schemes. He believed this would be particularly important for
areas such as Kirkintilloch on the banks of the River Kelvin.

A GOVERNMENT department is to explore ways of stopping fraudsters
''cloning'' the mobile telephones of Ministers and officials to make
free calls, it was disclosed last night. The practice involves tampering
with portable telephones so that the costs are diverted to another user.
Junior Environment Minister Sir Paul Beresford said in a Commons
written reply it was believed that 11 mobile telephones from the
Environment Department had been ''cloned'' in the past 12 months.

CONTROVERSIAL Glasgow politician, Councillor Patrick Lally, is in the
running to be planning convener of the new ''shadow'' City of Glasgow
Council.
Having lost the convenership of the new authority to his old rival,
Councillor Jean McFadden, Mr Lally has now received Labour group
executive backing for one of the major council posts.
However, it is likely his nomination will be challenged when the
executive's ''slate'' comes before the full Labour group for approval.
Meanwhile, the City Chambers is buzzing with speculation about a
possible alliance of Lallyites and McFaddenites against the imposition
of a regional council style of administration. Some fear this would give
more power to officials.
However, there are doubts even among the City Chambers ''old guard''
that the ''talk'' will harden into effective action.
The speculation has emerged amid a fierce debate on the future use of
the City Chambers, with some members of the new authority expressing a
preference for basing themselves at Strathclyde region's India Street
headquarters rather than the City Chambers.
Some new members and current regional councillors feel the facilities
for councillors at India Street, including parking, are far superior to
those available at the Chambers.
There have also been suggestions that the new authority should be run
from India Street, leaving the City Chambers with a ceremonial/tourist
role.
Last night, Militant councillor Tommy Sheridan gave his support to
those who feel the City Chambers should remain as the effective council
headquarters.
He said: ''The City Chambers is not only a wonderful building, it is
also accessible for people who don't have cars.''
The rest of the executive ''slate'' appears to be an equitable
distribution of convenerships between regional and district councillors,
reflecting the provision of regional and district services.
Among the district council nominations, Labour leader Councillor
Robert Gould has been adroit in distributing posts evenly between
members of the rival Lally and McFadden factions.
The major recommendations are:
Education, Dr Malcolm Green (region). Personnel, Mr William O'Rourke
(region). Finance, Mr Eamon Fitzgerald (district). Parks and Recreation,
Mr James Mutter (district). Economic and Industrial Development, Ms
Susan Baird (district). Social Strategy, Mr Archie Simpson (district).
Social Work, Ms Mary Beckett (region).
Housing, Mr James McCarron and Mr Craig Roberton (both district).
Roads, Mr Charles Gordon (region). Planning, Mr Pat Lally (district).
Arts and Culture, Mr Frank McAveety (district). Environmental Health and
Cleansing, Mr Alex Mosson (district). Direct Labour, Mr Denis Murphy
(district).

INEVITABLY, perhaps for years to come, the image of the island of
Sanday which will remain in the public mind will be of the family of
enormous whales sadly stranded at the Bay of Backaskaill at the end of
1994.
It's just a pity that the TV crews, having recorded the sombre events
by the shore, hadn't wandered a little further inland. They would have
found a community -- much changed in recent years -- building for itself
an important role in Orkney's future.
Sanday is the largest of the North Isles but its social structure has
altered radically as it became the earliest and principal target for the
folk ''frae the sooth'' seeking a stress-free and meaningful lifestyle.
This influx, combined with a drift of the older people to retirement
in Kirkwall, has presented the island with a whole series of challenges.
In the last 20 years two projects in particular have helped to broaden
Sanday's economic base -- still underpinned by fishing and farming.
The Isle of Sanday Knitters, which now employs 176 people from
Shetland to south-west Scotland and includes, most importantly, 40
knitters on the island itself.
Managing director John Boswell, himself an incomer, tells of a growing
demand for hand-knitted products. ''Our main markets are in Japan --
where the money seems to be -- Europe, and the United States and we
remain optimistic about the future.''
The company produces jumpers, cardigans, and tunics aiming at the
quality end of the market. Smaller, but equally successful, has been
Orkney Angora, which started as a family craft business in the early
1980s producing thermal clothing from angora rabbit wool. Working on the
same principle as the Sanday Knitters it also gives much needed
employment locally.
Islands councillor for Sanday, Howie Firth, has no doubt that
agriculture is still the key area in which a sound future for Sanday
will be guaranteed. Rich farmsteads have existed on the island since
prehistoric times with the light, sandy soils easily cultivated.
Says Mr Firth: ''A certain amount of the good agricultural land -- the
island's natural asset -- which isn't being farmed at the moment must be
freed to provide starter farms. The amount of capital needed to get into
farming now is so great -- you have to buy land, stock, and implements.
These starter farms (backed by fixed-interest loans) would, first of
all, provide an opportunity for young people on the island who would
like to get into farming. There is a heritage of good farming in this
island and enthusiastic young folk must be supported and encouraged,
given that first step on the ladder.''
The new enterprise of the majority of islanders -- Sanday-born and
incomers alike -- is also reflected in individual initiatives such as
that being proposed this summer by Margaret Rendall and her husband, who
are venturing into the market garden business.
''We hope eventually to supply the island of Sanday with all its
vegetable needs,'' says Margaret Rendall. ''We had been supplying
potatoes in a very limited way, just any surplus we had. But we've
identified a need and quite a few people have said that if we can supply
the island then they'll stop growing their own. Most have just a patch
of land in the corner of a field. It's often just a nuisance to
cultivate.''
If the health of a community is reflected in its young folk then the
outlook for Sanday is set fair.
The school roll at junior secondary and primary is around 80 from a
population of 530. Distance learning by electronic writing boards has
opened up a number of educational opportunities for the community, young
and old alike.
One aspect of island life certain to expand is the tourist industry
with seals, otters, a wealth of breeding birds, sweeping sandy bays and
archaeological remains constantly throwing up fresh wonders. Coastal
erosion exposes many sites in the North Isles as it did in 1991 near
Scar, in the Burness district of Sanday, where a spectacular Viking boat
burial containing three human skeletons, a horde of ornaments, household
goods, and weapons was uncovered . . . the last resting place of an
aristocratic family, the archaeologists surmise.
Holiday packages offering hotels, cosy bar fires, trout fishing, and
walks are seen as vital in persuading folk to bide awhile on Sanday.
While the ro-ro and air service can whisk folk to and from the island
the local tourist brochure explains the philosophy: ''Sanday offers
tranquillity; a quiet place that demands you linger in order to savour
its gentle charm.''
Despite the peace and quiet on offer the visitor will also find on
Sanday a busy island community, adjusting to the demands of the late
twentieth century.
Within the past few months the island has taken possession of a new
fire engine for the volunteer brigade and an indication of increased
tourism comes with the opening of the island's first filling station at
the quaintly-named village of Lady.
Immense pride is felt about the island's swimming pool, as on
Stronsay, brought to reality through fund-raising efforts by the
islanders themselves.
Elsewhere, as well as the church meetings, socials, and dances, a busy
island calendar includes the annual agricultural and industrial show
which draws folk from all over Orkney to view an impressive display of
cattle, horses, goats, and sheep and to sample the local produce
including, of course, the knitting but also the island's far-famed home
baking.
For the tourist trade, which is promoting towering skies and deserted
beaches, it may be of secondary importance but currently the age-old
tranquillity of Sanday is being match in even measure by the energy and
enterprise of its people.

BRITISH taxpayers are helping to pay for Spanish bullfights through
European subsidies, it emerged last night. Tory MP Sir Teddy Taylor, a
prominent Euro-sceptic, immediately condemned the European Union payment
which supports farmers raising cattle for either the slaugherhouse or
the bull ring. Sir Teddy urged all animal lovers to write to Brussels
Commission president Jacques Santer to call for the scrapping of the
subsidies. . Agriculture Minister Michael Jack had told the MP that the
Government had supported a Commission proposal to exclude fighting bulls
from qualifying for the second instalment of the beef special premium
during negotiation of last year's price-fixing package. ''However, the
Commission withdrew this proposal before the final package was put to
the Council for a vote,'' Mr Jack said.

AFFECTION shown by the heir to the throne for Scotland's Western Isles
is widely known through TV documentaries and news reports but the little
island of North Ronaldsay, the most northerly, and conspicuously remote,
of the Orkney group, has a special place in Prince Charles's heart.
Two years ago, when the 12-mile long stone dyke, which encircles the
island and keeps the famous seaweed-eating sheep on the shore, was badly
damaged in a storm, the Navy sent a group of ratings north to help in
the rebuilding work. Charles expressed an interest and flew to visit the
island followed a few weeks later by a group of volunteers from the
Prince's Trust.
A trust team will be back again this summer, and Billy Muir of
Hookin', chairman of North Ronaldsay Community Council, says that as
always they will be welcome: ''There's still a bit of work to go into
the wall and as far as we can gather the Prince takes an interest in the
rebuilding and activities on the island generally.''
Certainly in the past year or two there has been activity aplenty to
report. Much of this centres on an ambitious development plan which has
the support of both Orkney Islands Council and Orkney Enterprise.
The idea is that a whole range of potential projects to revitalise
North Ronaldsay are looked at and those too big or complex for
individuals to tackle should be taken on by the community council.
The first venture explored by the islanders involved the annual clip
of between two and three tonnes of wool from the native sheep which run
in a communal flock. The council buys the wool from the growers and
tries to find a market.
As the scheme moves into its third year consideration is being given
to setting up a company to manage and develop this successful enterprise
and at the same time free the council to look at other projects.
At the individual level the development plan has encouraged one
islander to put forward a plan for island tours.
Far removed from the sweeping cultural changes which have overtaken
Orkney in recent years North Ronaldsay -- a mecca for birdwatchers,
lovers of the past, and seekers after solitude -- is, like all the North
Isles, less densely populated than in years past.
Strains and stresses are inevitable in small communities like North
Ronaldsay and Papa Westray, where the populations are numbered in tens
rather than hundreds but where when necessary the people can pull
together and pool resources in a way which would astonish more
self-seeking societies in the south.
The growing awareness of the tourist potential of even the remotest of
Orkney's isles prompted a public meeting recently to look at various
historical sites on the island and to decide on the best ways to open
them up to the public and explain their history.
With an eighteenth-century lighthouse, two ancient earth and stone
boundary dykes, and burnt mounds, there is plenty of scope for
development.
Recent improvements have included the clearance of rabbits which had
been undermining valuable agricultural land and the establishment of a
new play area at the school.
Billy Muir is a cautious man but he confides: ''Yes, there's a degree
of optimism about the place now. In the past couple of years things have
started to look up.''
A more hopeful future now seems possible for this far-flung Orcadian
outpost as a result of a lot of hard work, dogged determination,
imagination and, of course, the royal seal of approval.

<TEXT>
A SERVICE of thanksgiving is being held at the Canongate Kirk, The
Kirk of Holyroodhouse, in Edinburgh's Royal Mile on Thursday for the
former chairman of the Post Office Scotland, Mr Ian Barr, who died last
month. He was 67.
Mr Barr, who gave a lifetime of service to the Post Office, was
chairman of the Scottish Postal Board, which became Post Office
Scotland, from 1984 to 1988. His sudden resignation caused a stir as he
left in protest at the Post Office imposing higher charges for its
Datapost service for the Scottish Highlands and Islands.
It raised questions of Scotland's position within the Post Office, and
charges of a centralist rule in London giving scant regard to conditions
in Scotland.
He will be remembered more by many people in Scotland, though, for his
enterprise in ensuring that the Post Office became a major sponsor of
the arts in Scotland. Many thousands of pounds were secured for
organisations such as the Edinburgh Festival, the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra, the National Galleries of Scotland, and the St Magnus
Festival in Orkney at a time when business sponsorship was still in its
infancy.
Mr Barr, who was educated at Boroughmuir High School, Edinburgh,
worked for three years down a pit before his mother persuaded him to
become a message boy with the Post Office. Although not a graduate, he
was eventually able to go before the Civil Service Selection Board which
helped him further his career.
His first senior appointment was as an assistant postal controller in
Manchester, auditing and inspecting offices in the North-west of
England. Later posts included helping to plan the setting up of the Giro
business, becoming the first non-graduate member of the Civil Service
Selection Board, and regional director of Eastern Postal Region in
England.
Following his return to Scotland, his enthusiastic backing for the
arts led to him becoming a director of the Scottish National Orchestra,
chairman of the Scottish committee of the Association for Business
Sponsorship of the Arts, and a chairman of the Saltire Society.
Explaining the substantial sponsorship, he once said that every
successful business organisation had a duty to put something back into
the community which provided its profits.
Mr Barr is survived by his wife Margaret and daughters Karen and
Kirsty.
The thanksgiving service on Thursday takes place at noon, although the
church will open at 11.30am with music performed by the pupils of St
Mary's Music School. Excerpts from works by composers and performed by
artists special to Mr Barr will be included in the service.

THE Government's bid to privatise the railways is on the verge of
collapse, an emergency Save Our Railways conference sponsored by the
STUC was told yesterday.
Victory was scented as delegates read an exclusive Herald report that
rail services in Strathclyde will be excluded from minimum Passenger
Service Requirements for Scotland to be announced today by franchising
director Mr Roger Salmon.
Speaker after speaker ridiculed a situation in which Strathclyde could
be dropped from the equation when tenders are sought to run services
within the ScotRail network.
Strathclyde is not only the largest commuter network outside London,
but contains more than half of all services in Scotland.
Labour's transport spokesman Mr Henry McLeish implied the battle for a
Government U-turn is all but over by suggesting the campaign should now
aim at minimising damage caused by subsidy cuts to the railways before
the next General Election.
He said that the decision to exclude Strathclyde undermines a
privatisation programme already suffering new nails in the coffin,
notably the Court of Session's reprieve to the Fort William-London
sleeper and the Government's decision to limit fares increases.
Mr McLeish said of ScotRail management's bid for the train operating
franchise: ''Forget it. It ain't going to be. More than half the
services cannot be taken out. It is absolutely ludicrous.''
Others who predicted that privatisation was a lost cause because it
was unworkable -- and would wreak havoc to Tory support -- included Mr
Lew Adams, Aslef general secretary; Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general
secretary; Scottish Liberal Democrat MP Mr Charles Kennedy, and Mr
Campbell Christie, STUC general secretary.
The heavyweight platform party told the conference, which overspilled
at Glasgow's City Chambers, that privatisation will be defeated by
public opinion and common sense.
They argued the sell-off was a recipe for disaster; that the
electorate would not be fooled by pre-election bribes financed by the
sale, or accept rail's social and economic benefits could be sacrificed
in a drive for profits within a private sector.
The campaign acknowledged a massive boost in reading The Herald's
disclosure that Mr Salmon, appointed by the Government to oversee
privatisation, has dropped Strathclyde from ScotRail's minimum Passenger
Service Requirement (PSR).
Mr Salmon's decision was interpreted by opponents as allowing
Strathclyde to become ''a franchise within a franchise''.
The region pays more than #30m a year to ScotRail to run its services,
and receives a further #80m a year in Government subsidy to cover
additional costs arising from railway reorganisation.
Franchise sources suggest Mr Salmon will proceed with publication of
the ScotRail PSR while continuing to negotiate with Strathclyde.
However, councillors are adamant a guarantee in 1993 from then
Transport Minister Mr Roger Freeman that Strathclyde has a say in levels
of services and fares under privatisation must be adhered to. The region
is not prepared to commit council tax payers' money without such
control.
The Save Our Railways conference especially rejected the withdrawal of
subsidies to the Fort William-London sleeper, condemned privatisation
for fragmenting Scotland's publicly-owned network, and opposed any move
by British Rail to impose cuts elsewhere in the network to make up for
the sleeper's #2.5m losses.
In a statement, to be lodged with Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, the
Rail Regulator, and the franchise director, the campaign declared the
run-up to privatisation has already caused a deterioration in services,
and demanded:
* Mr Lang defends current service levels, and that the Government
pulls back from privatisation;
* A Government commitment to long-term funding for Strathclyde PTE
beyond local government reorganisation next year, and the reinstatement
of sleeper and Motorail subsidies;
* The retention of services throughout Scotland at May 1994 timetable
levels, and;
* A moratorium on staff transfer or redundancy arragements, or any
other precipitate action which threatens rail services prior to the full
consultation process being completed.
Mr Christie said Scotland's railways were in crisis, with cash cuts,
privatisation, and local government reorganisation all threatening the
future of services. He added: ''The campaign can be won. Our message to
Government is: stop committing suicide with these suicidal policies.''
Aslef leader Mr Lew Adam said privatisation would lead to a #1000m
pay-off for those involved, although they will have done nothing but
asset strip and cut staff and services.
Scottish Liberal Democrat Mr Charles Kennedy said the exclusion of
Strathclyde from the PSR meant that privatisation ''was going nowhere''.
Mr Keith Brown, for the SNP, said public ownership made sense for
social, economic, and environmental reasons. He warned every rural
Scottish service was under threat because the private sector would only
look at the financial bottom line.

FIFTY catering trainees face an uncertain future after the trust which
runs their training school in Hamilton announced it may have to close
the school because of mounting losses.
The GrandMet Trust's Catering School also runs a popular restaurant in
Hamilton which may also have to close.
GrandMet Trust says funding from Lanarkshire Development Agency has
been pared to the bone. ''The funding is simply inadequate and GrandMet
Trust, an independent charity, is facing increasingly heavy losses on
the enterprise,'' a company spokesman said.
Its interpretation was disputed by the development agency. A spokesman
said funding for all training companies was dependent on targets being
met on the number of people trained and in the jobs found for them or
qualifications achieved by them.
GrandMet last year underachieved its targets at Hamilton by 16% in
youth training and 26% in adult training.
''We are very disappointed at the position that the catering school
finds itself in and we are currently exploring with the local management
ways of keeping the facility open,'' said the LDA spokesman.
He added that, if efforts to keep the school open failed, the LDA
would ensure that the 50 trainees completed their courses elsewhere.
GrandMet Trust says it is attempting to stave off closure by
persuading local businesses to join in a rescue operation.

THREE police officers were jointly responsible for the death of
illegal immigrant Joy Gardner, whose heart failed after they went to her
home to deport her, a court heard yesterday.
A woman police sergeant and two male colleagues had gone to the
40-year-old mother-of-two's flat in Hornsey, north London, early on July
28, 1993, the Old Bailey was told.
They were refused access. Mrs Gardner was in an extremely excitable
state and a violent struggle followed, said Mr John Bevan, prosecuting.
''She was brought to the floor and restrained.''
Restraint belts were put around her waist, thighs, and ankles. Then an
elastic surgical tape was applied to her mouth and teeth and ''in a few
moments she lost consciousness,'' alleged Mr Bevan.
An ambulance was called and, after unsuccessful attempts were made to
resuscitate her, she was taken to hospital where her heartbeat was
re-established.
However, she suffered cerebral starvation as a result of her brain
being deprived of oxygen, said Mr Bevan. ''Her condition did not improve
and she died on August 1.''
Detective Sergeant Linda Evans, 42, Constable Colin Whitby, 48, and
Constable John Burrell, 43, all deny manslaughter.
Mr Bevan described the case as an ''absolute tragedy'' -- firstly for
Mrs Gardner but also for the police officers ''who meant her no serious
harm and now find themselves on trial''.
He said that, in 1983, the Metropolitan Police solicitor gave a view
that it would be difficult to justify gagging, apart from on an aircraft
where it was requested by the pilot.
He added that ADG officers were alone among the Metropolitan Police to
use gags and regularly used restraint belts.
According to one forensic scientist, 13ft of surgical tape was wound
round Mrs Gardner head, said Mr Bevan.
It was found in a lump at the scene later. The tape came from two
different rolls and had been wound round her head in different
directions at least seven times, the prosecution alleged.
Mr Bevan said mention had been made of possible trouble before the
officers arrived at Mrs Gardner's flat. When they knocked on the door at
7.40am, it opened six inches and was on a chain.
Mr Burrell shouted: ''Open the door, we are police officers.''
Mrs Gardner shouted: ''You are not coming in -- I am phoning my
solicitor.''
As police cut the security chain, Mrs Gardner screamed ''I am naked''
-- although wearing a T-shirt and knickers.
Her son was watching television and was taken off to get dressed. His
mother ''was waving her arms about and making a lot of noise''. She told
police: ''I will kill myself rather than be sent back to Jamaica.''
Mr Bevan said she was progressively becoming more agitated and picked
up the telephone and a salt and pepper set and banged them down on the
table. She removed her T-shirt.
The three officers went to take hold of Mrs Gardner and Mr Whitby
called out ''Decks'', the prosecution alleged.
''Mrs Gardner went down, face first. She was turned on her back.''
Handcuffs were put on.
''PC Whitby placed a brown leather belt round her waist and attached
the handcuffs to it.'' He then tied her thighs and ankles together with
other leather belts.
While she lay trussed up and prone on the floor, Mr Whitby allegedly
took a roll of the sticky tape and wound it round her head ''a number of
times'', said Mr Bevan.
A second roll was produced by Detective Sergeant Evans. Mrs Gardner
was left lying face down on the floor while officers gathered up her
possessions and clothing.
However, later the constables felt her neck for a pulse, the court
heard. The tape was immediately removed and a vent aid put in her mouth.
Mrs Gardner was taken to the Whittington Hospital. Mr Bevan said
post-mortem examinations concluded she had suffered ''extensive and
ultimately fatal brain damage due to asphyxiation through obstruction to
her mouth by a gag''.
There was no evidence of any previous natural disease which could have
contributed to Mrs Gardner's death.
The trial continues.

LIVING on the storm-tossed edge of the Atlantic is not everyone's idea
of heaven but the 70 souls on Papa Westray, a miniature kingdom of
seals, crofts and endless skies, wouldn't swap their tough existence for
all the comforts of so-called civilisation.
It does take a very special breed of people to survive on the island
fringe and little things matter a lot.
When a radio reporter profiled the the four mile long island recently,
Maggie Harcus of the farm of Minthouse suggested that Kirkwall had
little to offer and when she was away longed to be back beside her
silver sand and slapping surf.
''Anyway, the pavements in the toon are too hard for my feet,'' she
confided.
Big excitement this spring on Papa Westray -- the island of the
priests -- has been the construction of a new slipway at the Old Pier
designed to make life easier for the handful of creel boats which
operate among the taings and skerries.
On this small island you're surrounded by history and Papa Westray has
a number of ''firsts'', ''oldests'' and ''biggests''.
For example the Knap of Howar, a farmstead by the west shore was built
before the pyramids and is the oldest standing house in northern Europe,
the island has an internationally important nexting site for Arctic
terns.
And of course the shortest scheduled air flight in the world to the
neighbouring island of Westray which has been completed in under a
minute for a distance shorter than the main runway at Heathrow. As well
as chapels and prehistoric ruins there seem to be abandoned cottages at
the end of every track, a salutory reminder of the ever present problem
of depopulation.
Popular with tourists because of its remoteness and the fact that it
has remained relatively unchanged by the outside world, the island has a
Community Co-operative which for the past 15 years has provided a focal
point for the visitors and for island activities generally.
As well as the compact hotel and hostel, the island's only shop is
under the control of a management committee of islanders.
Transport is a constant talking point, currently the island is
serviced by twice-daily subsidised flights out of Kirkwall. Incredibly
the islanders can fly into the town and back (a round trip of some 50
miles) for less than it would cost to take a taxi through the centre of
Glasgow.
There are regular ferry services and the possibility that the
successful North Isles ro-ro service may eventually extend to Papa
Westray. The islanders were promised a hard ramp several years ago.
Ian Cursiter, the youthful chairman of the Community Council admits
that with a population of less than 80 the future of the island is very
delicately balanced and that the versatility of the islanders in finding
employment may yet be tested to the full.
''If we were to lose a couple of families then the situation could
become critical (it's been calculated that each resident lost means a
drop of #1200 income for the shop).
To keep people here we must make the very best use of the land. Also
tourism has a role to play. Bed and Breakfast establishments are opening
up on Papay (the local name for the island) and I think that could be a
big help to our economy.''
Behind the caution however, runs a thread of genuine confidence.
Witness plans to adapt a piece of machair at the south end,
appropriately named the Links of Moclett, into a nine-hole golf course.

A GLASGOW school was hit by fire-raisers twice in one day at the
weekend, causing more than #80,000 worth of damage.
The attacks on Garthamlock secondary, Easterhouse, which were only six
hours apart, destroyed thousands of pounds worth of computer equipment
and more than #65,000 worth of theatrical equipment, props, and costumes
stored at the school for numerous school and youth groups in the East
End of the city.
The school was not covered by closed circuit television which
Strathclyde's education department has installed in 15 schools in an
attempt to combat vandalism.
A department spokesman said that the CCT was in operation in two other
schools in Easterhouse which were considered as greater priorities.
The first fire took place shortly after 2pm on Sunday, and the second
around 8.30pm.
Detective Constable Kenny Dewar, of Easterhouse CID, described the
attacks as a senseless waste of property which was used for the good of
the community.
''Criminal damage caused in this way to a premises which provided a
very valuable service to the people of Easterhouse is appalling. The
people of this area will suffer greatly as a result of this senseless,
wilful destruction,'' he said.
He appealed for anyone with information about the fires to contact the
police or to telephone Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
Last Thursday the nearby Unemployed Workers' Resource Centre was also
set on fire, causing tens of thousands of pounds worth of damage. Police
are investigating whether there is a link between the crimes.

<TEXT>
SCOTS athletics star Liz McColgan is opposing plans to build a 20-acre
sewage plant 600ft from her #400,000 house.
Liz and her husband, Peter, said last night that they intend to fight
the plan to build a multi-million sewage works next to their home at
Panbride House, Carnoustie in Angus.
Mr McColgan said: ''We are furious about this plan. It has been on the
go since 1991, but we knew nothing about it when we bought the house in
1993.
''If we had known, we would never have bought it. We paid a lot of
money for the house and have spent a lot on it subsequently. There is no
doubt this will be a depreciating factor on the value of our property.''
The sewage treatment works is to be built by Tayside Regional council
to meet European directives on cleaning up waste water to improve
beaches by the year 2000.
But the McColgans fear that the proximity of the works could mean they
would be affected by smells.
Mr McColgan said: ''We have already attended one so-called
consultation meeting and made our feelings known. The people in the area
do not want this treatment plant.
''But instead of taking our grievances on board, the officials gave us
a lecture about how the plant would work -- we are just not interested.
''I have been in touch with my solicitor and we will be raising a
planning objection to the proposal. I am also getting in touch with my
local MP, Mr Andrew Welsh.''
He added: ''There are people around us who have been trying for years
to get planning permission for simple alterations without any success.
Yet this multi-million pound scheme can be steam-rollered through.''
A spokesman for Tayside Regional Council said: ''Eight possible sites
were assessed and other alternatives considered before we selected the
Panbride site.
''Machinery capable of making a noise will be noise-shrouded and
measures will be taken to ensure there is no odour nuisance. The treated
effluent will be discharged into the sea through a new long sea
outfall.''

TO date Westray, more than any of the larger Orkney islands, has
remained relatively untouched by the phenomenon of the ''white settler''
and as a result has returned a distinctive Orcadian flavour.
It's with great pride the local folk tell you they're Westray born and
bred.
Reasons why this island in particular should have escaped the social
upheaval elsewhere relate mainly to the fact that Westray -- self-styled
Jewel of the Isles with a population of around 700 -- lies 25 miles from
Kirkwall right out on the northern fringe of the island group.
Despite the new ro-ro service and regular air links with the island
capital, Westray, generally regarded as the most prosperous and
successful of the north isles -- remains geographically remote,
particularly in the dark winter months. The mainland of Orkney does not
exert the same pull for islanders and older folk tend to stay put when
they retire. In February David and Margaret Burgher celebrated their
72nd wedding anniversary in the same croft at Skelwick where they have
lived since 1923.
Westray is an island which remains very independently minded (their
football team is a regular winner of Orkney's Parish Cup) and family
ties are of extreme importance. A strong sense of community persists
reflected, for instance, in the fact that the inheritance of land is
still carefully weighed by the islanders for its social implications as
much as for its commercial possibilities...a feature of rural life all
but vanished elsewhere in the isles.
The harvests of sea and land have been the means of survival since the
dawn of time on this island where archaeological sites indicate a
continuity of settlement and cultivation stretching back to neolithic
times.
The village of Pierowall in its sheltered bay was an important
commercial centre in Viking times and remains the hub of Westray life
with its highly successful junior secondary and primary school, hotel,
post office, doctor's surgery, banking and shopping facilities and
community centre (complete with swimming pool).
Round the bay Gillpier is home port for a number of very modern deep
sea fishing boats providing work for dozens of local men at the
white-fishing and, of course, bringing money back into Westray's
mini-economy.
Equally important is the local shellfish industry. A little fleet of
creel boats operating out of Westray and adjacent islands provides up to
30 full-time and part-time jobs for lobstermen supplying high quality
crab, lobster and scallops for processing and export. Quality has always
been the keynote for Westray, and Orkney seafood.
Most significant development in the fishing sector in 1995 is the
upgrading of the Westray Processors plant at the pier. A #480,000
programme of work is bringing the factory -- the single biggest employer
on the island with over 20 full-time an part-time staff -- up to the
rigorous hygiene standards now required by the EEC.
Plant manager Davie Hume says: ''Eventually the processors will be one
of the most up to date units in the United Kingdom. This work will
guarantee the jobs already in place and give us the opportunity to look
at ways of developing our product.''
Local councillor for the island Stephen Hagan, who farms at Skaill,
has no doubt that for the foreseeable future farming and fishing will
continue to provide the bedrock of Westray's economy. ''With assistance
I am sure there is room for expansion in both these areas, for instance
in the haulage services,'' says Mr Hagan.
Jim Burgher, a local farmer and representative of the National
Farmers' Union on the island, confirms that agriculture in Westray at
the moment is in fairly buoyant mood. ''Certainly things are going well
due to a combination of factors, good prices and grants from the EEC
among them. It remains to be seen if the protests over live shipment of
calves might have some effect on our business.''
Although the trend throughout Orkney is to larger farms more of the
smaller units in Westray are surviving, probably because the owners have
second-string jobs, for example at the fishing subsidising their work on
the land. At present there are roughly 3000 breeding cattle on the
island and at Kirkwall Mart Westray beasts regularly fetch the top
prices. Cottage industry, principally knitting and straw-backed
chairmaking and more recently crafts have added an extra dimension to
the range of employment over the years.
Tourism is seen as an area of opportunity for the island, particularly
since the new ferries Sigurd and Thorfinn started calling at the Rapness
terminal at the south end of the island. Westray folk have not been slow
to respond to the challenge.
Already in place are two popular hotels and a selection of
much-praised bed and breakfast establishments. The full range of
activities of which Orkney so proudly boasts -- bird-watching (along
some of the most spectacular cliffs in Scotland), seal-spotting (on the
sweeping sandy bays) exploring the past (you're tripping over sites of
historic interest right across the island), beachcombing, and plant
hunting are all on offer. An ambitious two-island holiday package is
being planned with Westray's small neighbour Papa Westray.
It was in an attempt to gather together the strands of Westray's
intriguing heritage that the local Buildings Preservation Trust was
born. Nancy Scott, the organisation's vice-chairman, tells of plans to
establish an interpretation centre in Pierowall Village this year.
''We have a hall and our plan would be to have boards outlining the
flora and fauna of Westray, the island's history, that sort of thing. If
it all works out we might even manage to stage an exhibition on World
War II this summer. We also have in mind a corner where people could get
a cup of tea and local crafts can be displayed.''
The Trust has had an enthusiastic response from both within the island
and from Westray exiles. Already over #1100 has been raised from the
first appeal for support.
Sociologists and economists looking to assess the way in which
far-flung islands are adjusting to change on the threshold of a new
century could do worse than take the Swan's Path, the old Viking sea
route to Westray. A success story waits to be reported.

<HEADLINE>Rail fare increases capped at rate of inflation</HEADLINE>

RAIL fares will not be allowed to rise above the rate of inflation
over the next seven years, the Government announced yesterday, reversing
10 years of above-inflation growth in the cost of rail travel.
The Prime Minister is understood to have intervened to ensure that the
cap on price increases be applied to nearly all fares, including those
for commuter and concessionary travel.
Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney has won the approval of Treasury
Ministers for a seven-year financial guarantee to make up the shortfall
train operators will suffer as a result of their revenue being limited
while costs rise.
He said he hoped the promise of price controls would attract more
people to the railways and help reduce the amount of subsidy required.
''In the last 10 years, fares have risen by over 22% above inflation.
This signals the end of across-the-board regular real annual fare
increases,'' he said.
However, Labour dismissed it as panic in the face of rail
privatisation's unpopularity and warned that price controls would put
off potential investors in the railways.
Shadow transport spokesman Henry McLeish said: ''The decision shows
how the Government is caught between a rock and a hard place: by
limiting fares, the Tories are killing off any serious chance that there
will be a widespread franchising of services.''
Included in yesterday's announcement was a concession for Strathclyde
Regional Council, which has won the right to regulate all fares in its
area. The region's Passenger Transport Authority runs the largest
commuter network outside London and has insisted on retaining control of
services and fares.
Mr Salmon today will announce details of the minimum services the
ScotRail franchise will have to offer its customers once it is
privatised. The document, called a PSR -- Passenger Service Requirement
-- will omit services on the Strathclyde network following the region's
refusal to surrender any control over timetables.
Edinburgh will also benefit from the fare capping. In rail commuter
areas not regulated by a local PTA, like Strathclyde, Mr Salmon will
regulate a wider range of fares than elsewhere in the country.
In Edinburgh, these will include all standard season tickets, standard
singles, and unrestricted standard returns. Commuter fares will be
restricted in the same way as others -- no increases above inflation for
three years, followed by a 1% decrease in real terms each year for four
years.
Fares that will be affected overall include Saver tickets,
unrestricted Standard Return tickets, and all Standard weekly season
tickets. For other fares, the operators will have the right to alter
them for commercial reasons.
For three years from January 1996, operators will be prevented from
increasing most fares by more than the rate of inflation. For each of
the four years after that, fare increases will be limited further, to no
more than 1% below the level of inflation.
Mr Salmon said: ''I have a statutory duty to ensure that the interests
of passengers are protected and that fares are reasonable. This policy
ensures that in commuter areas the main commuter prices are controlled
and in the rest of the country the most widely available leisure fares
and fares for regular users are controlled.''
ScotRail, whose management is preparing a bid to run the franchise,
welcomed the announcement, and in particular Dr Mawhinney's pledge of
extra subsidy. A spokeswoman said regulated fares would bring a sense of
financial stability.
Other potential investors expressed reservations. Mr Philip Snowden,
of coach operators Badgerline, said yesterday: ''The fares announcement
today means there is another bit of the business you can't control.''
Critics claim that because a passenger franchise faces fixed costs for
maintenance, rolling stock, and track access, there is little scope for
the operator to find savings and increase revenues.
Rail union leader Jimmy Knapp described the decision as a U-turn and
asked why it had not happened earlier. ''If the Government can do it
(reduce fares) next January, why wasn't it done last January or the
January before that?''
He added: ''For more than 10 years, my union has urged the Government
to reduce fares or peg increases to the level of inflation, only to be
told repeatedly that this was not feasible.
''Now it is feasible. This is a desperate move by a Government whose
whole privatisation rhetoric has been built on the need for competition
and giving free rein to market forces.''
For the Liberal Democrats, transport spokesman Paul Tyler pointed out
the irony of the Government's ability to fund more subsidies for
privatised railways after years of refusing to subsidise them while they
were publicly owned.
The Central Rail Users' Consultative Committee applauded the
announcement and said it marked a turning point in rail policy. Chairman
Major-General Lennox Napier said: ''Holding fares down will increase the
attractiveness of the railway and stimulate greater use.''

A JOBLESS jeweller turned sailor who has been rescued by lifeboat
seven times in five weeks was yesterday thought to be on his way back to
his towerblock home in Dundee -- by train.
Mr Robert Turnbull, 49, a father-of-two, has plans to continue with
the 300-mile sea trip from Hastings to bring his 17ft yacht, Curlew,
home to the City of Discovery -- despite criticism from lifeboat staff,
who say they cannot stop him setting sail.
The rescues are estimated to have cost #10,000 and rescuers predict
the figure could rise if Mr Turnbull proceeds on his trip with the
yacht, which does not have a radio or flares.
He hoped to sail back to his home city after taking delivery of the
vessel in Hastings at the beginning of April.
However, since setting off on his first big sea-voyage around the east
coast, he has been hit by a string of calamities, the latest of which
left him grounded at the weekend in the Humberside holiday resort of
Bridlington. He attempted to leave on the next stage of the 300-mile
journey home on Sunday but did not realise the harbour at Bridlington
was tidal and found himself stranded on mudflats.
Mr Turnbull was said to have been found sitting in his cabin reading a
book and complaining that he had been seasick for two days during the
latest rescue.
A spokeswoman for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution said: ''We
can't stop anyone from going out there but we would ask them to take all
possible precautions and sail safely to prevent putting the lifeboat
crew at unnecessary risk.
''Our men will go out in all conditions, because that is what we do,
but we would appeal to people such as Mr Turnbull to be a little more
careful.''
Bridlington lifeboat assistant mechanic Mr Brian Cundell said: ''He is
a danger to himself and a potential one for others at sea.
''When we found him, the yacht was out of control and just wallowing
about in the sea. When we woke him, he thanked us and asked for a tow
into Bridlington harbour because his outboard had broken down. He was
seasick and suffering from fatigue, so he will probably sail off again
and no doubt be picked up by one of the lifeboats further north.''
Humber Coastguard spokesman, Mr Tony Ellis, was a little more
sympathetic to the lone sailor.
''To be fair, when he was brought into Bridlington, it was by
arrangement. We had put out a message because we were concerned about
his whereabouts and he was traced in the North Sea. He declined an offer
of a tow to Grimsby, where he had just left and was met by arrangement
by the lifeboat.
''I met him on Saturday night and a more charming man you could not
find. He has just been unfortunate. The winds just seem to have been
against him on his voyage.
''The only criticism we would have is that he is sailing by himself.
We would prefer him to have someone else on board to ensure a proper
watch is kept on the sea.''

A 35-YEAR-OLD woman was still being questioned last night by police
investigating the death of a patient in a hospital's intensive care
unit.
The woman, believed to be Nurse Amanda Jenkinson, was also being
questioned by Nottinghamshire detectives about ''other incidents''.
The move came after a 15-month police inquiry into unexplained deaths
at several other hospitals and medical centres where she had worked.
Miss Jenkinson was suspended from duty more than a year ago by
managers at Bassetlaw Hospital, in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, after an
internal inquiry into fears raised by other nursing staff about the
treatment of intensive care patients.
The police investigation which followed was understood to have centred
on alleged tampering with life-saving equipment.
Bassetlaw and at least two other hospitals, Southmead in Bristol and
the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, have set up telephone help lines to
handle calls from worried former patients and their relatives.
Miss Jenkinson worked at the Gloucestershire hospital as an
unqualified nursing assistant, carrying out general ward duties, from
1978-1980.
Miss Mariella Dexter, the hospital's general manager, has said that
unqualified staff were supervised and did not get involved in giving
medication to patients.
Miss Dexter said: ''As far as our records show, the nursing assistant
in question did not work in intensive care while she was here.''
Miss Jenkinson was born in Gloucester in 1959 and her mother still
lives in the city.

<HEADLINE>Nurses jeer Minister as strike looms Threat of action by 900,000 NHS staff</HEADLINE>

NURSES were poised to tear up their long-standing no-strike rule after
Ministers yesterday refused to back down on controversial local pay
deals.
Junior Health Minister Baroness Cumberlege was booed and heckled by
members of the Royal College of Nursing meeting in Harrogate for their
annual congress, when she claimed that local pay bargaining was here to
stay.
However, the settlement appears likely to set off industrial action by
some 900,000 NHS workers.
Furious delegates shouted ''rubbish'' as the baroness, a former
vice-president of the RCN, repeated Government claims that nurses were
not being short-changed. She was jeered when she said: ''I do believe
the future is in local pay -- that is the way forward.''
She particularly infuriated RCN members by saying that in Derby, where
local pay has been introduced, nurses have had offers of between 3% and
9%. She was heckled repeatedly during a 45-minute question and answer
session.
This was in stark contrast to fellow panel member Christine Hancock,
the RCN's general secretary, who was greeted with loud cheers and
applause.
Around a dozen trusts have made offers of 1% and many have made offers
conditional on improving sickness absence rates or scrapping bank
holiday payments.
The mood of the conference was such that delegates appear certain to
vote today to scrap the RCN's traditional no-strike rule and replace it
with one allowing limited action.
This would then go to a ballot next month which would require a
two-thirds majority for the rule change to be endorsed. There would then
require to be a legal industrial action ballot before action could be
taken.
The scale of the hostility displayed the nurses' anger at not
receiving a 3% across-the-board national pay rise and being asked to
accept local bargaining to stand any chance of improving on a
''miserly'' 1% national offer. Even then, in many cases efficiency
''strings'' are being demanded by NHS trusts.
Consultations among the 440,000 Unison members employed in the NHS,
including 240,000 nurses, end tomorrow and are understood to be running
heavily in favour of industrial action in protest at broadly similar 1%
central offers. Industrial action ballots are likely to be set in train
soon.
Baroness Cumberlege admitted that some trusts might not be able to
offer 3% this year, if they were in financial difficulties. But she
claimed it was up to nurses to negotiate -- adding that it was not in
trusts' interests to have demoralised staff.
Earlier yesterday, in her presidential address to the RCN congress,
Mrs Betty Kershaw warned Ministers involved in the nurses' pay battle:
''You've seen nothing yet,'' and spoke of the the ''deep sense of
outrage'' felt by nurses over the ''mismanagement'' of their pay award.
This had been fuelled by the knowledge that nurses, more than any
other health workers, had helped improve health service productivity and
raised standards of care, she claimed.
In a rousing speech before 2000 delegates, she accused the Government
of a serious error of judgment.
''By ignoring the evidence, by ignoring the anger of nurses, and by
underestimating the support of the public for nurses, the Government
have made a very grave mistake,'' she declared.
Nurses had been dealt a body blow but had got off the floor to fight
for a fair deal, Mrs Kershaw said. If they failed to win 3%, it would be
the Government that would not recover.
She ended with a defiant message for the Prime Minister, Health
Secretary Virginia Bottomley, and Health Minister Gerry Malone.
''We will fight for nursing and for the health services of this
country, to ensure that our campaign marks a turning point for nursing,
and to use the tremendous support we have received to create a better
future. We will fight to win this battle and move on to win the war.''

GLOBETROTTING actor and comedian Michael Palin had the last laugh when
'inept' burglars tried to break into his home, Southwark Crown Court
heard yesterday.
Woken by the noise of the heavy-handed pair, the actor was able to
raise the alarm and watch their efforts to gain entry.
Police arrived to arrest the two men, before they could force their
way into the house.
Nicholas O'Connell, 20, of Lady Margaret Road, and Glen Hilliard, 18,
of Marsden Street, both in Kentish Town, north London, admitted
attempted burglary at the actor's home in Belsize Park.
O'Connell was jailed for eight months and Hilliard ordered to complete
140 hours' community service.
Mr Jason Dunn-Shaw, prosecuting, said Mr Palin -- who was not in court
-- was woken at about 4.15am by the sound of the letter box rattling.
About 10 minutes later, he heard footsteps, the letter box rattle
again and the sound of youths talking noisily and went to investigate,
the court heard.
''Through a gap in a curtain, he could see two young men. One produced
a metal tape measure and tried to insert this to release the (door)
catch.
''Mr Palin returned to his bedroom, roused his wife, who rang the
police, and had the presence of mind to write down descriptions of the
men. In the event, these were not needed because police arrived,'' said
Mr Dunn-Shaw.
Both men tried to escape, one by vaulting railings, but they were
quickly captured.
Hilliard immediately told officers that he had been answering a call
of nature, adding: ''Lock me up, I don't care.'' O'Connell denied he had
been near the home.
Counsel said the officers could smell drink on their breath but did
not believe they were drunk.
Mr Stephen Walters, defending, said it was an ''extremely inept
attempt'' at a burglary.
''If they were sober, it would be surprising if they made such a noise
while attempting to enter a house in the middle of the night,'' he
added. ''They were both very drunk indeed.''

<HEADLINE>All aflutter as Scots crossbill shows more cheek</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>978370854</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
GENETICISTS on both sides of the Atlantic are carrying out tests to
establish whether Scotland has its own unique bird.
If proved, it would mean that the Scottish crossbill is the only bird
species found in Scotland and nowhere else.
Crossbills range throughout a band of forest that stretches across the
northern hemisphere, including Scandinavia and Scotland, but the
Scottish crossbill is different because of the size of its beak and
cheek muscles.
''It has a much stronger bill than the crossbill in Scandinavia,''
said RSPB spokesman Mr David Mitchell. ''This is because it's much more
adapted to taking seeds from pine cones rather than fir cones.''
''You can actually tell it apart. A trained eye can see that the cheek
muscles on a Scottish crossbill are that much stronger and better
developed because of its diet.''
The DNA research, however, will ascertain whether the differences
amount to it being a separate species or simply a variation of the same
bird.
The finch gets its name because the top of its beak curves over and
twists round itself so that it can prise its way into conifer cones and
take the seeds out.
About the size of a chaffinch, the crossbill has been found in
Scotland since the Ice Age which formed the English Channel and broke
the advance of tree species such as fir and spruce. So the crossbill in
Scotland developed in the pine forests instead.
But numbers now are down to only 700-800. Work in America is looking
at the connections between Scottish and American crossbills, and along
with work commissioned by the RSPB in Scotland, Mr Mitchell hoped that
the relationships between various types of crossbill would be
established.
''It's very much an international project,'' he said: ''We are really
pleased by the amount of interest that people are showing in it.''
The work could have important implications for the bird's future
conservation. ''If you lose a species, you can't ever get it back,''
said Mr Mitchell.
Other types of crossbill are also found in Scotland and the DNA work
will also examine their effect on the Scottish crossbill stock.
Meanwhile, the RSPB is asking the public to help solve the growing
mystery of Britain's disappearing skylarks.
From the North of Scotland to the English south coast, the skylark
population has plummeted by 50% in 25 years.
There were no less than four million pairs distributed evenly around
the country at the end of the 1960s, but the figure is now estimated to
be half that.
''It is a quite alarming drop,'' said Mr Derek Niemann, of the RSPB.
Its Edinburgh office has launched a campaign called The Lost Lark in an
effort to get a more accurate figure of how many skylarks remain.
With so many skylarks around, people could be forgiven for paying so
little attention to their dwindling numbers.
Mr Niemann said: ''There might have been some complacency but it was
more a case of people thinking they had not heard so many in recent
years.
''Countrymen say they can remember up to six skylarks singing at once
over their fields, but there has been a serious decline.''
The public, particularly schoolchildren, are now being asked to fill
in forms available from the RSPB's Edinburgh office in which they should
detail where they hear skylarks singing, count the number of birds
heard, the exact location, and the type of land.
Skylarks should be particularly common in areas like Lanarkshire, the
Lothians, Dumfries and Galloway, the North of Scotland, and the Northern
Isles, but not the Highlands.
One theory is that intensive farming leaves the birds with less feed.
Skylarks like seeds left over after crop-gathering but, now that fields
are in continuous use, their seed stock is vanishing.
However, that is unlikely to be the only reason and ornithologists
believe that the use of pesticides is harming the birds' survival as is
the loss of nesting places.
Skylarks are the size of a sparrow with brown, streaked markings and
white outer tail feathers.
Mr Niemann added: ''Often people don't see the skylark and only hear
its melodious song. It has a fantastic flight pattern as it flutters up
vertically singing all the time until it vanishes into the sky.''

<TEXT>
A MAN of 86 yesterday told of his efforts to stay alive after being
trapped in his bath for four days.
Mr Arthur Grant said he thought he was going to die after his bath
seat collapsed beneath him and he was unable to climb out because he was
too stiff.
He spent the next four days lying in pain, with nothing to eat or
drink and too weak to cry for help, before being rescued.
Mr Grant, a widower and retired carpet weaving instructor who lives in
Edinburgh, said he spent the weekend slipping in and out of
consciousness.
''I really thought my time was up. I don't know what caused the bath
seat to collapse, but one minute I was all ready to have a bath and the
next minute I was trapped.
''After hours of lying in the cold water I managed to pull out the
plug with my foot, but I was too stiff to do anything else.
''I just had to lie there and pray that someone would find me.
''I just kept trying to think about places I had been and things I had
done so that the time would pass.
''But I kept slipping in and out of consciousness.''
Mr Grant's son, John, 59, who had been away for the weekend, became
worried when his father failed to answer the telephone.
''My son knew something was wrong when he saw all the lights in the
house were off. He kicked down my front door and came to my rescue.''
Mr Grant, who was blue with the cold, was treated at Edinburgh Royal
Infirmary for hypothermia and kept in for four weeks.
Yesterday, after spending his first day back at home, he said plans
were now under way to have a hand rail fitted at the side of his bath
and an alarm button nearby.
Pensioners' groups warned all old and handicapped people to ensure
their bath seats and other aids were regularly checked and serviced.
Mrs Phyllis Herriot, of the Scottish Old Age Pension Association,
said: ''I am sure Mr Grant's accident will raise a lot of concern and a
lot of people will be asking for more examination of the types of
supports given out.
''We ourselves will be looking into what happened to ensure this was a
one-off incident and that all bath supports do not have a fatal fault.''

<HEADLINE>Leave the carrying of guns to the specialists who are prepared for the job, rank and file officers say Police opposed to fully armed force</HEADLINE>

POLICE have said an emphatic ''no'' to their being routinely armed.
Seventy-nine per cent of the 74,000 rank-and-file officers who responded
to Police Federation survey rejected the idea, in a severe setback to
the vociferous minority of police and politicians who want a fully armed
force.
Eighty-three per cent wanted an increase in the specialists trained to
use guns and face armed criminals.
The result of the survey, which took place in England and Wales,
corresponds broadly to the situation in Scotland as perceived by
Scottish Police Federation officials. One of them, Mr Tom Rowatt,
secretary of the powerful Strathclyde Branch of the SPS, told The
Herald: ''I am not at all surprised by these results. If you asked the
questions here there would be a similar response.''
The clamour for guns continues, however, with a stream of articles on
police news magazines urging a culture change to meet force with force.
Scotland is not immune, with the recent upsurge in firearms crime in
Renfrewshire prompting a stream of anonymous calls to the media from a
particular group of police officers claiming that unarmed colleagues
were having to raid houses where weapons were likely to have been
present but without armed back-up.
But Strathclyde has two armed response vehicles on patrol 24 hours,
providing adequate armed response until teams can be deployed, senior
officers insist.
Curiously, a telephone poll conducted by GMTV yesterday attracted 2691
respondents, eight out of 10 of whom wanted the police to be armed.
Senior officers believe that might, however, be more of a reflection of
the type of people who take part in television phone-ins than anything
else.
The federation chairman in England and Wales, Mr Fred Broughton, said
the survey's outcome ''proves once again that police officers
acknowledge the vital importance of policing by consent''. The 83% of
officers who wanted an increase in the numbers of officers trained and
with access to arms prompted Mr Broughton to add that it showed a strong
need for greater levels of protection for policemen and women.
The results of the poll were kept secret until yesterday, the eve of
the Police Federation conference at Bournemouth, which will be attended
by senior officials from the Scottish federation.
Mr Broughton said that the survey would help set the law and order
agenda for police chiefs and politicians.
The figures showed 21% of officers in favour of being armed at all
times while on duty. The 52,000 police who said their lives had been
threatened in the past two years in the line of duty demonstrated that
the ''bobby on the beat faces sudden death routinely'', Mr Broughton
said.
The ballot closed on the day 28-year-old PC Philip Walters, unarmed,
was shot dead in East London, the seventh officer killed on duty in
London in the past five years. This, said Mr Broughton, had led to a
''sizeable number'' of officers talking favourably about routine arming.
Mr Rowatt said: ''While I also believe in a largely unarmed service we
definitely require to increase our capability to deal with the armed
criminal. There has been great concern expressed by Strathclyde officers
to me in recent times and I understand these concerns -- unarmed men
being sent to deal with armed criminals. Police managements up and down
the country should be dealing with that urgently. It is unfair of them
and of society in general to expect unarmed officers to carry on doing
this.
''That having been said I still do not want routine arming. That
signals a culture where there is no consent left.''
Police throughout the UK already have access to a wide range of new
defensive technologies, including new, extendable, polycarbon batons and
bullet-proof body armour. This was tested to the limits last week when a
London officer survived being accidentally shot in the chest by a
colleague. Strathclyde is in the forefront of testing bullet and
knife-proof vests which are currently being made routinely available at
divisional level.

A SCOTTISH mother is ready to go to the European Court of Human Rights
to overturn a Court of Session ruling which gave her 14 days to return
her dual-nationality baby to Spain.
A Labour MP is calling on the Government to intervene to protect both
the mother and child from the man she claims physically abused her and
inflicted ''gross mental torture''.
Mrs Catherine Johnston, 24, of Craigendmuir Park, Stepps, says she
will breach the court ruling and go into hiding if officials try to take
away her 14-month-old daughter, Lucia.
However, her Spanish husband, ''Pepe'' Cortez, 36, says all he wants
is the right to see his daughter, which he claims has been denied since
his wife fled to Scotland last December.
Technically, only Lucia has been ordered to return to Benidorm by the
Court of Session to allow a Spanish court to determine access rights.
However, yesterday her distraught mother said: ''I refuse to send
Lucia back. I'll go into hiding in order to protect her. I would have to
go with her and remain in Spain just so that my husband -- who beat me
up and inflicted horrific mental torture -- can see her from time to
time.''
Monklands West MP Mr Tom Clarke claimed the matter was a breach of
human rights and has called on Scottish Secretary Ian Lang and Home
Secretary Michael Howard to intervene.
Last night, Mr Cortez told The Herald that all he wanted was to see
his daughter, which he claimed had been denied to him since last
December.
''For six months, I have had no news of my daughter and no
photograph,'' he said.
''I even tried to fly to Glasgow at Christmas to reconcile my marriage
and see Lucia. But Catherine said, if I came over, she would disappear
and I would never see Lucia again.
''I have a steady job here and earn money I couldn't in Scotland. All
I want is for Catherine and Lucia to come here and let a Spanish court
decide my rights to see my daughter.''
Mrs Johnston was given interim custody at Glasgow Sheriff Court. That
is now overruled by Lord Clyde's decision in Edinburgh. She has until
tomorrow to name a date when she will take Lucia back to Spain. She
added: ''I will not be giving a date. If I need to, I will go into
hiding.''
Last night, her solicitor, Mr Ian Smart, said there was no prospect of
an appeal in Scotland against the Court of Session ruling, but he was
taking advice on whether a court order could be obtained in Spain in Mrs
Johnston's absence.
Mrs Johnston's started Scottish divorce proceedings in January, but
these proceedings now have to be replicated in Spain.

LUNG cancer patients were warned yesterday of a treatment lottery
which meant many allegedly failed to receive even basic care.
The warning by a senior academic came weeks after the Government had
pledged to reshape services so that people could take advantage of
medical discoveries and more effective treatment.
Ms Jessica Corner, a senior lecturer at the Institute of Cancer
Research and the Royal Marsden NHS Trust, warned that treatment quality
depended on where you lived, especially for women with breast tumours.
She added: ''But with lung cancer, where the disease is frequently at
an advanced stage at diagnosis, we are not even talking about your
chances of receiving adequate treatment, or to be able to expect that
state-of-the-art research is being carried out into the disease.
''Lung cancer patients in the UK, with one of the most advanced health
care systems in the world, with the most comprehensive palliative care
services, are not even receiving the basic care that any of us would
assume is a basic right in a civilised society.''
Her criticism came at the launch in London of the Cancer Relief
Macmillan Fund's campaign to give more help to victims of lung cancer,
which claims 100 lives daily and is often referred to as the
''forgotten'' cancer.
Scottish women have the highest rate of lung cancer in the world while
Scottish men have the third highest rate, behind Hungary and
Czechoslovakia.
The Cancer Relief Macmillan Fund yesterday announced several new
initiatives to help those living with lung cancer.
These included:
* The expansion to five cancer treatment units in Britain of a study
of the management of breathlessness at the Royal Marsden NHS Trust.
* The appointment of the first Macmillan lung cancer care nurses to
work alongside the primary health care team and to meet the needs of
people with lung cancer, such as the side effects of treatment.
* A Macmillan-funded study aimed at identifying the needs of patients
with lung cancer and their carers in relation to current health service
provision.
Ms Corner said: ''The main aim of these initiatives is firstly to
raise awareness and, secondly, to improve the lives of people with lung
cancer rather than waiting for some futuristic idea that we might one
day rid the world of tobacco.''
Meanwhile, teachers were told yesterday they could help pupils reduce
the risk of skin cancer by encouraging them to wear T-shirts and sun
cream.
The Cancer Research Campaign is looking at ways of raising awareness
in schools, as new figures show an 84% increase in this type of cancer
over the past decade.
Professor Gordon McVie, scientific director of the Cancer Research
Campaign, confirmed that the charity wanted schools to follow the
example of the Australians, who actively encourage children to stay out
of the sun.
He told a news conference at the Department of Health: ''The CRC is
looking at how to raise awareness in schools and the possible risks to
pupils because of children's exposure to the sun.''

A LEADING team of international rescue volunteers, who have gone on
mercy missions around the world, yesterday launched a desperate appeal
for cash to keep them on the road.
The Grangemouth-based International Rescue Corps, made up of
specialists on standby to respond to appeals for help, need #40,000 to
purchase a new fully-equipped rescue vehicle.
The team was established in 1985 and since then has sent members to
major incidents in Mexico, Columbia, El Salvador, Iran, Georgia, Costa
Rica, the Philippines and, most recently, Japan, where specialists spent
a week there in the aftermath of the earthquake.
Their expertise is also in demand throughout Britain, where they have
attended numerous incidents, such as the Guthrie Street gas explosion in
Edinburgh.
The corps, a registered charity, relies on donations and desperately
needs a replacement vehicle to deliver the rescuers to each incident,
and give proper back-up assistance once there.
Group organiser Willie McMartin, a full-time fireman from Falkirk,
explained: ''At present, we use a crew bus. The vehicle has covered in
excess of 150,000 miles and has served us well. But we have become aware
of its shortcomings and have decided to replace it with a specialised
rescue ambulance.
''With the Scottish membership at only 40 people, this is a major
fund-raising headache.''
So far, they have raised #3500.
Mr McMartin, added: ''All of our services are provided free of charge.
Our aim is purely and simply to save lives.
''We are now all hoping someone out there will come to our rescue.''
