DANOLI will miss the Irish Champion Hurdle and warm up for the
Cheltenham Festival with a run at Gowran Park next month.
The Champion Hurdle favourite, unwell when flopping recently at
Leopardstown, will not be ready in time to go two weeks tomorrow.
''To get him fit to run would mean cramming three weeks work into less
than 10 days and, as much as I would like him to run, the English
Champion Hurdle is his prime target,'' said Foley.
''If he was to have a small setback and a hard race at Leopardstown he
may have to miss the Cheltenham race and that is the prize we want.''

GETTING into the kitchen is an operation that can require almost
military precision.
You approach the door and cough, then rattle the handle to warn of
your approach. Finally you open it an inch at a time peering round the
edge to see if you have caught a victim a nasty blow.
The problem is that the fridge is just inside the door and flinging
open the kitchen door can propel an unsuspecting cook straight inside
the icebox. Many homes have such a danger spot, where the door opens the
wrong way.
The answer is simple: reverse the direction it opens. Doing the job is
quite simple as well, just as long as you take your time.
Suppose that you wish to change the direction of the door's opening
action from right to left.
First remove the door, then unscrew the old striking plate -- that's
the place on the frame where the latch on the door engages and locks the
door shut. Fill the hole and the recess with wood and wood filler --
make a good job and you will never know that the door used to open in
the opposite direction.
You will have to make another hole for the striking plate on the frame
on the other side of doorway.
Take the hinges off the door. Fill the old hinge recesses in the
doorframe and the door with thin pieces of wood and wood filler.
You will now need to cut new recesses in the other side of the door.
Put the hinges on the edge of the door and draw around them. Use a
chisel to remove the wood to the correct depth and screw the hinges in
place.
Lift the door into place, using thin wedges to get sufficient
clearance at the bottom and mark the position of the hinges on the
frame.
Use the chisel again to chip out the recesses needed for the hinges.
Now remove the latch and door handles and fill the holes in the edge
and sides of the door using wood and filler.
Cut a new hole for the latch in the opposite edge of the door. Hold
the lock against the side of the door and draw round it, then drill a
series of holes the correct depth into the edge of the door and use a
chisel to cut a box the right size for the latch.
Slip the latch in place and draw round the faceplate on the edge of
the door. Now cut a recess deep enough for the latch to be flush with
the side of the door.
Hold the latch on the side of the door and mark the spots where the
handle and keyhole should be. Drill through the door in both places,
taking care to keep the drill as straight as possible.
You will need to reverse the latch. That may involve simply turning it
upside down, or possibly opening it up to reverse the mechanism.
Then it is just a case of applying paint to make good the door and
frame.

THE quality of air that plants need to breathe is a vital issue.
Temperature and moisture levels, while critical, do not cancel out
plants' dislike of cold, tainted or polluted air.
Take cold air, in the form of a draft, for example. It can be deadly.
I am shocked to see how some shopkeepers gaily put out tender plants at
their shop front doors, irrespective of any outside temperature.
Even hardy plants dislike drafts. This is why conifers go brown along
one side. Very warm air can be just as damaging, or more so. Plants can
literally shrivel up, if kept near a hot water radiator.
Moisture-laden air can be fine for plants such as ferns, or commercial
cucumber crops. Over-moist air, however, can create problems for house
plants, especially when temperatures are low. It can encourage grey
mould.
Outdoor plants can react violently to carbon monoxide fumes, given off
by petrol and diesel vehicles. This is why plants in central
reservations often have a rough time. Salt-laden air at the seaside can
also be damaging.
As far as dirt in the atmosphere is concerned, we have come a long way
over the years. Yet, for rapid growth, one of the most important
elements in air is carbon dioxide. Plants need this, to be absorbed by
their leaves in manufacturing carbo-hydrates.
Research many years ago indicated that the atmosphere in a greenhouse
could be enriched by extra carbon dioxide, to encourage growth. The
weight of crops produced could also be improved.
For this reason, most commercial tomato growers enrich the greenhouse
air with carbon dioxide. Gardeners using paraffin stoves inadvertently
enrich the atmosphere with carbon dioxide gas. Unfortunately, there can
also be a lot of condensation too. If the stove is not operating
correctly, there can even be sulphur fumes.
It all goes to show that you can't take clean air for granted.

THE Sports Council have announced a 20% cut in its funding towards
skiing.
For the British Ski Federation, who already had their season planned
for coaches and athletes alike when this bombshell dropped, this has
meant trying to find #50,000 to keep to the planned racing and training
schedule in a world championships year.
The reality is that each team member from World Cup level down must
personally find travelling, accommodation, uplift, and subsistence costs
to the tune of between #5000 and #10,000 each season.
''We've reached a desperate point now,'' said Mike Jardine, chief
executive of the British Ski Federation. ''It is demoralising for
athletes, coaches, and the BSF staff to know that if these type of cuts
in finance continue next season, we will have to reduce the
programmes.''
The BSF has been forced to make staffing reductions, unable to finace
a similar calibre of director of alpine skiing to Sarah Lewis, who has
been head-hunted by the International Ski Federation, a situation which
brings increased strain for the remaining administrative staff in the
East Calder office.
On the snow the coaches are now relied on as much for their skill in
bartering and negotiating accommodation and transport deals and getting
their skiers training with the stronger alpine nations, as their own
training skills.
''It's going towards a situation where the incentives for getting into
the British team are limited, which is a situation which we have to
address,'' said Jardine.
''Skiing is a sport which has more than 2.5m British participants. We
really feel that the Minister for Sport should be spending time looking
at how we can reverse this trend rather than flying to Australia to find
out why our cricketers are doing so badly in a well-resourced sport
which is only played in a handful of countries around the world.''
* IN icy conditions Scots skiers yesterday paid the price for the poor
snow conditions for alpine training. Only Suzanne Hughes (Aberdeen)
could score a creditable result, finishing sixth in the girls' FIS
Slalom at the British Alpine Racing Ski Club's championships in Austria.
In the boys' race, English skiers Oliver Hall and David Nelson took
second and third places, with the best Scot in twelfth place over 20
seconds off the pace over the two slalom runs. Results:
Girls. Slalom -- 1, N Haks (Holland) 1-43.29 (after two runs); 2, R
Bradridge (England) 1-48.32; 3, J Calvert (England) 1-45.69. 6, S Hughes
(Aberdeen) 1.56.59.
Boys. Slalom -- 1, J Rebrsac (Slovenia) 1-25.38; 2, O Hall (England)
1-33.14; 3, D Nelson (England) 1-38.23.

WITHIN the next few weeks, many greenhouses will be brought into
action again. This is especially true for those of us with the
increasingly popular propagating cabinets. They can provide a vital
localised warmth for rooting cuttings, or sowing early seeds -- and at
minimum cost.
One of the many problems is the way in which moss, algae and dirt gets
a hold and settles on the glass. It has a profound effect on light.
Indeed, you may find that the glass is so cloudy that transmission is
reduced greatly. Good light is vital to growth.
Poor light will also seriously affect growth of seedlings or rooted
cuttings, in propagating cases in the greenhouse. The answer is, of
course, to give the glass a thorough clean both inside and out.
It is a lot easier at this time of year when it is relatively empty of
plants and those inside can be moved out on a favourable day, for an
hour or two. One of the major problems facing keen greenhouse gardeners
who wish to clean up is that they may have used bubble polythene for
lining in order to conserve heat.
It makes access to the inside glass difficult, and is one of the great
drawbacks of this lining. Many gardeners are of the opinion that the
polythene lasts only a limited time, as it tends to go cloudy and has
the effect of reducing light transmission.
They don't put the lining on until February or March, after a thorough
cleansing of the greenhouse. For cleaning the glass, you can use a
variety of materials, such as Jeyes Fluid, Armillatox, or strong
detergents.
It is better to put the cleaning fluid on with a soft brush and leave
it for a while before hosing off with a strong jet of water. This can be
done only in a mild spell of weather.
The improvement in light transmission can be immense. If you want to
prove this, you can check it with a sensitive photometer. You can also
be sure the plants will appreciate the improved light as well.

FEWER regions deliver more disappointments in relation to price than
Burgundy. It makes wines of superb quality at the top of its range but
quality comes tumbling down too easily.
There is little point in this column paying much attention to the
stars of the region when they run into hundreds of pounds, though once
in a blue moon I inure myself to buying Le Montrachet (the last was from
Cockburns of Leith). I once asked Henry Lorimer, the manager of
Justerini &amp; Brooks in Edinburgh's George Street, which is a stockist, if
he sold any and he said ''yes'' -- but only to individuals not to hotels
or restaurants.
It is a wine best brought at auction at prices between #1000 and #3000
a case. The retail price is ferocious at around, but usually over, #300
a bottle. I mention it only because a distant cousin tells me that the
wines mentioned here are too dear. Little does he guess at the restraint
imposed by my purse -- even allowing for the mania of a wine lover.
To come down a peg there was uninhibited pleasure lately in a Grands
Echezeaux from Oddbins (#39.99). It was full, silky, and long;
delightful, as it should have been. Still staying with pleasure I can
safely recommend Emmanuel Rouget's Bourgogne Aligote 1992 which is about
a tenner from Raeburn Fine Wines, Comely Bank Road, Edinburgh. This is
still a bit dear for a wine which does not use the region's top grape.
It will, however, be a revelation to many, and it is not the dearest
Aligote though it is in my tasting both here and in Burgundy itself
distinctly the best.
Some to whom I have recommended it notice and worry about little
floating specs. These do it no harm, but merely declare that the wine
has not been filtered, a lack of intervention to its benefit. (To people
who have written to tell me of their doubts about deposits in German
whites, the same advice is sound: do not worry, though in their case the
deposits are tartaric crystals, and harmless.)
I remember raving about this white three years ago and noting that the
BBC's Food and Drink programme gave it great marks. Good for them.
Raeburn also have a very little of Rouget's red 1992 which I tried
three days before Christmas. Sadly a pound or so dearer, this was still
a good buy. It is the top grape, the Pinot Noir, and has already a
lissom elegance and long length. Anyone buying it should think of
keeping it. Again it is produced with as little mechanical interference
as possible, and is not flitered. Little is made but Raeburn has half
the total production. Buyers will not be disappointed in my opinion and
I think that is hard to say about Burgundy in this price range.
(Faiveley wines, stocked by Peckhams in Glasgow, produce dependable
items between #8 and #10.)
If one wants to try Burgundies knowledgable wine merchants are worth
their weight in gold -- J Hogg of Edinburgh's Cumberland Street and
Peter Green of Warrender Park Road in the same city fall into the
desired category, but Bogle and Belcher of Montrose have a few fine
Burgundies (and Chablis) in magnums at the equivalent of #20 a bottle,
and the Alliance Wine Company of Beith have some pricey whites which
look mouth-watering even on the list (phone: 01505 506060 for a list). I
have not tried the Burgundies but I have tried, and appreciated, their
Champagne in the City Merchant Restaurant in Glasgow's Candleriggs. By
Michael Baujean, it is available in halves at #15.

PETER Shilton, the suspended Plymouth manager, has threatened to sue
the second division club if they do not reinstate him. He was banned on
full wages on Wednesday after having failed to pay a #50,000 tax demand
on time.
But the former England keeper's solicitors have claimed that the
suspension as a breach of contract.
In a statement, the law firm said that Shilton has received support
from players, members of staff, certain directors, and supporters, and
with this in mind, he has decided to offer the club the chance to remedy
the situation by restoring him to the position as manager.
''Failure to do so,'' the statement claimed, ''will result in a claim
for substantial damages for breach of contract being made and pursued by
way of legal proceedings.''

AN investigation team from Shell UK is to reconstruct the ferry
crossing in which one of the company's oil tanker lorries overturned on
a deck, crushing nine cars.
The incident happened in stormy seas as the P &amp; O ferry was en route
from Aberdeen to Shetland overnight on Wednesday.
The tanker was carrying a large quantity of lubricating oil, which had
to be pumped off after the ferry docked in Lerwick on Thursday morning.
The team will travel on the ferry next Monday, using a similar fully
loaded tanker and the driver of the vehicle involved in the incident.
The company has said that until further notice it will not be
undertaking ferry crossings if winds of over force seven are forecast.
This was a ''precautionary measure'', a spokesman said yesterday.
The team of marine, tanker, and oil specialists will examine the way
the road tanker was secured, the weather conditions, and ''other factors
which may have caused the incident''.
It will also inspect the damaged 38-tonne tanker, which is still
parked on the P &amp; O dock.
They will be working with a P &amp; O investigation team and the ferry
crew which was on duty during the voyage.
The spokesman said Shell UK regarded the incident and damage to
passengers' cars as ''a matter of considerable importance''.
He added: ''How the Shell tanker was lashed to the car deck will not
be fully established until the investigators have had an opportunity to
inspect the damaged vehicle.''
According to Mr Scott Colgate, P &amp; O Scottish Ferries marketing
director, at least two of the eight lashing points on the vehicle were
found to have sheared off.
He said yesterday: ''Our lashing equipment appears to have remained
intact and I have no reason to believe that the vehicle was not totally
securely lashed for the journey.''
Mr Colgate added that a surveyors' report was being prepared and the
findings were expected to be available early next week.
''We need to get the surveyors' report and as a result of that we
would discuss it with the owner of the vehicle.''
P &amp; O has asked for the owners of the crushed cars to send it their
insurance details. Under the conditions of carriage on ferries to the
northern isles, the maximum liability the company has is #3000 per car.
It will be up to the insurance companies to reach an ''amicable
solution'', Mr Colgate said, adding that the company's insurers would be
asked to look at each claim as ''fairly and sympathetically as
possible''.
Just one of the nine owners involved had taken out a special insurance
policy, offered at P &amp; O booking offices, to cover the trip.
Mr Colgate defended the company against claims that it was not doing
as much as it could to help because it has a monopoly on the car and
passenger sea route.
''If you look at the standard of service and reliability that we offer
passengers both on board and onshore, I really don't believe we do adopt
a monopolistic attitude.''

DIANE Modahl, the former Commonwealth 800m champion suspended for drug
abuse, has asked for her appeal against a four-year ban to be heard in
public.
Her solicitor, Tony Morton-Hooper, said: ''We have no hesitation in
asking the BAF to hold the hearing in public. It is quite obvious that
this case is of great public interest and of importance to the world of
sport.
''Furthermore, the BAF rule book does not require meetings to be held
in private. There was no evidence at the last hearing which could have
been of benefit to anyone trying to break the anti-doping regulations
and so no need to keep any of the evidence secret.''
Modahl is still awaiting evidence to support her case, including data
from the Lisbon laboratory which tested the urine sample. She also wants
the Portuguese authorities to release the remainder of the sample, so
that further tests can be carried out.

RANGERS, described memorably but without malice yesterday by John
Lambie as ''the Big Bad Wolf,'' have problems to sort out before they
take on Partick Thistle at Firhill in a meeting of the top and bottom
premier division clubs this afternoon.
Manager Walter Smith listed a host of players who have fitness tests
to go through this morning before the 13 on duty can be decided and,
although he did say that he anticipated most would be ready for action,
the squad is already depleted enough to leave some concern if there are
any more withdrawals.
It may be the continuing injury story which has prompted the manager
to turn down a bid by Israeli side Hapoel Petach-Tikva of Tel Aviv to
take Ukrainian midfield man Alexei Mikhailichenko on loan for the second
half of their league season. ''The Israeli team were in touch about
Alexei, but he is staying here,'' said Smith. ''He is about two weeks
away from playing again.''
Lambie, who insists that his team have plenty of fight left in them,
even if there are those who believe they are already doomed to
relegation, said of his side's confrontation with the league leaders:
''We are not afraid of the Big Bad Wolf. We are not crying about our
situation and we might prove a few people wrong about us yet. This won't
be easy for Rangers and it certainly won't be easy for us.''
The Firhill manager does not take excessive confidence from the fact
that Brian Laudrup is missing from the Ibrox ranks -- he is on
international duty with Denmark -- as he recognises the depth of
Rangers' squad. ''Whoever they bring in will be desperate to prove
himself worthy of a regular place.''
Smith has various options to make up for the absence of Laudrup but,
until he can gauge the fitness of the doubtful men, he cannot really
select the one he prefers. The players who will be checked out this
morning are Gordon Durie, Richard Gough, Basile Boli, Stuart McCall and
Charlie Miller, all of whom suffered knocks in the 1-1 draw with Celtic
at Ibrox on Wednesday evening.
Add to that the possibility that both Ally McCoist and Mark Hateley
will still be absent, although Smith said that McCoist had the better
chance of making it, and it is easy to see why it could be a bit tricky
if some call off.
Smith played down the prospect of doing without Laudrup. ''He has made
a tremendous contribution but, just as we have to cope when we lose any
player for any reason, we have to compensate. We have done it before and
I am sure we can do it again.''
Naturally, Smith continues to dismiss speculation that the big race is
as good as over, but does make the valid point that the teams near the
bottom end of the table will become increasingly difficult opponents as
the season wears on. ''With so much money spent on stadiums, the teams
will be desperate to stay in the league and the games will get tighter.
Thistle, to be fair to them, have had a go at us when we have played
them this season.''
Thistle will be without suspended Roddy Grant, but Lambie said that he
expects everyone else to be fit.
Celtic, who took a lot of credit, if only one point, from their
performance at Ibrox, will again have to do without Peter Grant against
Dundee United at Hampden. His throat infection, which prevented him from
playing on Wednesday, has not cleared up yet.
Tosh McKinlay returns to the pool, and Willie Falconer and Simon
Donnelly are also added. Falconer is wanted by Kilmarnock, who are
willing to do a swop deal which would send their defender Andy Millen to
Parkhead, but there have been no fresh negotiations on the deal.
That may happen soon and so, too, could the move for Dutch striker
Pierre van Hooydonk, but assistant manager Billy Stark said that it
would not be in time for this afternoon's task.
''We had a good performance, particularly in the second half, at
Ibrox, but we are still disappointed that we ended up with a draw. It
was maybe another example of where we have failed this season.''
Stark, like everybody else, can only wonder which face United will
show. They have been impossible to forecast this season, sometimes
inspiring, sometimes insipid.
United have signed Uruguayan midfielder Juan Ferreira, who impressed
in a reserve match against Hibs during the week, but he will not play at
Hampden. ''It would not be fair to ask him to play so quickly,'' said
manager Ivan Golac, who paid Defensor #250,000 for the player, ''but he
will be in the squad for the game with Partick Thistle on Tuesday.''
Ferreira is confident he will be suited by the Scottish game. ''I
think it will be better for my style than Uruguayan football,'' he said.
We shall see.
Brian Welsh returns for United after a three-game suspension, but
Billy McKinlay is still out because of injury.
Hibs might have full back Willie Miller in his place for their game
with Kilmarnock at Easter Road and, if so, David Farrell will probably
move forward to take over from Brian Hamilton, who has joined Hearts.
Their best player this season, Michael O'Neill, who is the country's
third highest sorer with 11 goals, believes it is time to rekindle their
league challenge. ''The win over United has given the place a surge of
confidence and we have to take the chance to try to improve our
position.''
Killie, who have lost only one of their last eight games -- against
Rangers -- will have Neil Whitworth back after suspension, but his
deputy, Mark Skilling, might still be accommodated if he recovers from a
knock.
Aberdeen's assistant manager, Roy Aitken, looks likely to keep his
place in the side to meet Falkirk at Pittodrie, unless Stewart McKimmie
passes a late fitness test.
Falkirk defender Joe McLaughlin has recovered from a poisoned foot and
will play. Keeper Tony Parks, midfielder Brian Rice and striker Colin
McDonald are all set to return.
Two teams who will watch all of this with interest are Motherwell and
Hearts. They are not in action until tomorrow -- for the benefit of
Scottish Television. Motherwell will still be without Brian Martin,
while Jamie Dollan has his last game of his suspension to complete.
Hearts will give new boy Brian Hamilton his first experience of a
maroon shirt, and Scott Leitch, who played in a reserve game against
Motherwell yesterday, could be in the squad.

* EVERTON'S #4m record signing Duncan Ferguson has given the
Merseysiders a fitness scare on the eve of their FA Cup third round
clash with Derby County at Goodison.
Striker Ferguson is a major doubt after being sent home from training
with a virus and his absence may become even more prolonged if the
Scottish FA implement a suspended 12-match ban which is pending a court
case for alleged assault on Monday.
* BLACKBURN Rovers' Kevin Gallacher has become a shock target for
French outfit Auxerre.
The Scot, poised to make his comeback on Wednesday after having broken
a leg in February against Arsenal, has been linked with Celtic.
However, Auxerre and another unnamed French club have been in contact
with manager Kenny Dalglish and are set to swoop.
Blackburn are likely to accept a fee in the region of #1m for the
former Dundee United winger who signed from Coventry two years ago.

CAMMY Little, Glasgow's current scrum half, has been dropped by GHK
for the Old Anniesland match against Heriot's this afternoon. So has
Harry Bassi, the club's regular full back.
Gus Kerr will be at scrum half and Little's district colleague, George
Breckenridge, at full back. Another Glasgow representative, Murray
Wallace, is to make an unexpectedly early return after a knee injury.
Little played in all four of Glasgow's district championship matches
last month, taking over from the injured Fraser Stott early in the
opening game against North and Midlands.
Brian Gilbert, GHK's coach, reported that the club selectors'
preference was based purely on current form. He added that Douglas
Morgan, the former international scrum half now Scotland's coach, had
been impressed with Kerr's tidy rugby earlier this season.
Breckenridge has had three games for Glasgow this season, first at
stand-off in the 19-all draw with Leinster in October and twice on the
right wing in two district championship matches, but it is full back
that is now reckoned to be his best position. Gilbert is enthusiastic
about the prospect of Breckenridge intruding at pace.
Wallace was not in GHK's original squad for today's match as he had
been expected to be out of rugby for up to three weeks. Gilbert,
however, explained that the wing forward had later made himself
available and proved his fitness in training on Thursday night.
* DAVID Lougheed, who scored two tries for Canada against England last
month, will not be returning to Britain when the Canadians play their
Test against Scotland at Murrayfield on January 21.
Lougheed is unavailable through teaching commitments, but Bruce Breen,
the flanker who pulled out of the tour to England and France just hours
before the trip with a hamstring injury, is included in the squad of 21.
He is the only player in the party who missed last month's tour. Squad:
S Stewart, W Stanley, R Toews, C Smith, S Gray, C Stewart, G Rees, R
Ross, J Graf, I McKay, E Evans, D Jackart, P Le Blanc, M Cardinal, K
Svoboda, N Hedley, M James, B Breen, I Gordon, J Hutchinson, C McKenzie.

DUTCH master Theo Snelders wants to remain with Aberdeen for the rest
of his career. The keeper is backing manager Willie Miller to ride out
the crisis and bring success back to Pittodrie.
Snelders revealed yesterday: ''When I came here it was a gamble, an
adventure I thought would last for only three years.
''But I have now been here for seven years and I love it. I was
married here, my son was born here, and I feel very much part of
Scotland.
''I am that stage in my career where I will be sold only if someone
offers silly money. But I will not be knocking on any doors to ask away.
''I want to get it right for Willie Miller. I have always had the
greatest respect for him and since taking over as manager he has been
good to me.''
He added: ''While Rangers are dominant once again, without Mark
Hateley and Ally McCoist they don't look so special. Obviously, I'd
prefer it if teams were closer to them, but Scottish football is still
very tight. My only concern is to help Aberdeen narrow the gap.
''It is amazing how quickly it can all change. Just a few weeks ago we
were adrift at the bottom after being beaten by Kilmarnock. Now, if we
beat Falkirk tomorrow we could move into the top half of the league.''
Snelders, dumped by Holland after the World Cup, knows too that if
Aberdeen bring back the glory days it will help his prospects of an
international recall under new manager Guus Hiddink.
* ASTON Villa yesterday signed Tommy Johnson and Gary Charles, from
Derby, for a combined fee of #2.9m. Both men have signed
three-and-a-half-year contracts with the option of a further 12 months.
* TWO goals from substitute Luis Garcia gave Mexico a 2-0 win over
hosts Saudi Arabia in the opening Group A match of the Inter-Continental
Cup in Riyadh.
In Group B, Samson Siasia struck early to give Nigeria the lead
against Japan, then strikes from Mutiu Adepoju and Daniel Amokachi
completed the scoring.
* NEIL Shipperley yesterday joined Southampton from Chelsea for a club
record fee of #1.2m. Saints will initially pay #750,000, with the fee
rising to #1.2m when Shipperly has played an agreed number of games.
* GHANAIAN striker Anthony Yeboah will decide this weekend on a club
record #3.5m move to Leeds from Eintract Frankfurt.
Yeboah flew to Germany yesterday after talks with Leeds managing
director Bill Fotherby, who said he was confident the striker would
agree to move.

IN some minor matters, like electing stable governments, it would
appear the Italians have still not acquired the knack. They are,
however, improving all the time in rugby skills as the Scotland A team
are likely to discover at McDiarmid Park, Perth, this afternoon
(kick-off three o'clock).
Last summer, Italy lost to world champions Australia by only three
points in the first Test at Brisbane; on the same tour they beat Super
10 title-holders Queensland. In their most recent match they thrashed
Middlesex by 50-3, scoring seven tries in the process.
All of which has prompted some in their party to suggest they should
be playing the full Scotland team today rather than an A side. Back row
replacement forward Julian Gardner, born in Australia but of an Italian
mother, insisted: ''We should be at Murrayfield, playing on the big
stage against the best side, not sent to some small provincial
stadium.''
He vowed: ''Scotland are going to be made to pay for suggesting we are
second rate.''
Arthur Hastie, the A team manager, smiled diplomatically when the
words were relayed to him yesterday. ''I can understand why they would
want a full international and, one day, that may come. But the close
results in the two matches our A side have met them suggests this is the
right level. In a World Cup year it suits us to look at as many players
as possible.''
In 1992 at the Greenyards, Scotland A won 22-17; last year, at Rovigo,
the Italians took the spoils 18-15, Argentinian-born fly-half Diego
Dominguez kicking six penalties in a match which still makes Scots coach
David Johnston shudder: ''God, it was a dreadful game of rugby.''
But since then, Johnston has guided the A team to their most famous
and historic victory, the success over the Springboks at Melrose this
season. He has 13 of that side taking the field again.
''We would hope for a better day of weather, so that we could try to
redress the balance from last year,'' he added.
The two Scottish newcomers will provide much interest. London Scottish
centre Ronnie Eriksson, 22, is a possessor of an Irish passport, thanks
to his mother, and could qualify for a Swedish one via his dad. But he
was schooled in Scotland, at Merchiston, and he was a bright light in
the district championship.
It is an open secret that the selectors would like to beef up the
international midfield and Eriksson could have the right credentials.
His Exiles' team-mate, Eric Peters, who is still fighting to gain a
place in the Bath first team, may not be far from a full cap either. He
is effectively keeping Doddie Weir on the replacements' bench, which is
not insignificant.
The A team will once again be led by Stirling County hooker Kevin
McKenzie, always a good man to have at a press conference. ''Everybody
knows the team to play Canada will be chosen next week -- what greater
incentive does anyone need?''
He does not give a stuff whether the Italians like playing at Perth.
''I think it is an inspired choice for the fixture, one of the best
little stadiums in the country. It is also taking rugby into an area in
which the game could do with a boost.''
It is 89 years since Scotland last staged a rugby international at a
soccer ground, but we are on a hat trick. The prevous two games, against
England in 1896 and South Africa in 1906, both resulted in home wins. A
crowd of over 5000 is expected at the home of St Johnstone.
Italy have named a side which includes twins Massimo and Marcello
Cuttitta and the dreaded Dominguez. Scots, with eyes firmly fixed on
spending the spring at the World Cup, include Rowen Shepherd, Craig
Joiner, Ian Jardine, Bryan Redpath, Fergus Wallace, and Damian Cronin.
Plus, of course, captain McKenzie. When his side beat the South
Africans he was presented with a Springbok head. Defeating Italy might
bring him another of the horse's variety.
Scotland A -- R J S Shepherd (Edinburgh Academicals); C A Joiner
(Melrose), I C Jardine (Stirling County), B R S Eriksson (London
Scottish), I C Glasgow (Heriot's FP); D W Hodge (Watsonians), B W
Redpath (Melrose); D I W Hilton (Bath), K D McKenzie (Stirling County)

SCOTLAND is not exactly short of hairdressers with international
reputations. Rita and Irvine Rusk were probably the first to put us on
the world map in the 60s but soon Taylor Ferguson, Charlie Miller, and
the like were cutting, colouring, and creatively styling their way to
fame.
There always seemed to be room for imaginative outsiders like the
Vidal Sassoon salon and most recently the politically correct crimper
Daniel Field, but one chain, Toni and Guy, are coming here soon for the
first time.
It has taken Glasgow hairdresser Roger Cairney seven years to bring T
&amp; G here and to be honest I was tempted to ask why. We're not exactly
short of talented hairdressers.
Roger has sold the two hairdressing businesses which he has built up
in the city over the past 18 years to take out the franchise. ''It has
taken me seven years to organise. You've got to have certain standards,
an education programme for juniors, but the feedback you get from almost
60 salons, all over the world, from an organisation like this is
wonderful. That's what we'll offer that is different. I'm expecting to
bring people here for training, people from Japan and Scandinavia where
salons are being set up. We are about to open a salon in New York.''
The reputation Toni and Guy have built up is for personalised
hairdressing, paying as much attention to the customer's individual
needs and style as to current fashions.
Started by two teenage Italian brothers in London 30 years ago it is
still a family firm. The brothers and their own families still work in
the salons but now there are hairdressing schools in America and Germany
as well as Britain and two art teams which travel the world. Three years
ago a salon and a hairdressing school was opened in Germany and the
group is constantly winning awards.

SCOTLAND'S rugby selectors face more than one nagging challenge before
announcing their side to play Canada on January 21 in what should be a
dress rehearsal for the Five Nations' Championship.
They can go some way towards ensuring a reminder of how uplifting
victory can be after a bad run. The scent of failure can linger with
drastic effect on morale, as between 1951 and 1955 when Scots had to
endure 17 consecutive defeats.
They also must carefully assess how much more mileage might be
available from veteran foot soldiers who have served their country well
but who, in the South African Test, showed signs of wear and tear.
There is no substitute for experience and, in Scotland's rare but
laudable bursts of singular success such as the Grand Slams of 1984 and
'90, there was a broad nucleus of players who had been tried and tested
at the top level and were fairly rated as being in or very near world
class. Unfortunately on the basis of individual form at the time, there
was barely one Scottish player in the Murrayfield match against South
Africa who could be thus rated.
However, the old guard deserve the Canadian match in which to
demonstrate the class of which they are known to be capable. And under
the pressure of knowing that in the ''A'' international against Italy at
McDiarmid Park, this afternoon there are several aspirants whose
credentials have been considerably strengthened this season.
Whilst striking the right blend in every department is important, the
choice of the breakaway trio is particularly so. History points to the
lesson that whenever Scotland has placed itself into the record books in
short bursts of exceptional triumph, they have fielded loose forwards of
high quality who sparked off each other in highly effective blend.
In 1984 David Leslie, Iain Paxton, and Jim Calder exerted massive
influence as different types who complemented each other. In 1990 John
Jeffrey, Derek White, and Finlay Calder provided a potent mix of all the
qualities required in that crucial area of offence and defence.
Once when the likeable Australian coach, Bob Dwyer, was asked at a
press conference who would be his loose forwards in a World XV and I
suggested that surely he couldn't do other than pick Jeffrey, White, and
Calder, his reply was: ''I'd have to know who the bl...y referee was
going to be before I could pick them.''
His inference was that those three Scots had a closer acquaintance
with the offside line but what a dynamic trio they were with the
capacity for not only influencing but even dictating the trend.
Thus there will be close examination of Eric Peters as No.8 against
the Italians, especially as Doddie Weir has been placed on the bench.
The choice of Fergus Wallace and Ian Smith for the Italian game was due
reward for their successful toil against the South Africans at
Greenyards.
Wallace is a sound, thinking tradesman, never likely to burn the grass
but making the most of his particular attributes, Smith pound for pound
a remarkable fellow, fearless in plunder, floor work and tackle and so
often at the ball carrier's elbow.
Yet a trio of Peters (at blind side), Weir and Rob Wainwright has its
attraction. David McIvor's work rate is awesome and Peters would need to
step up a gear to match it, but he brings a lineout dimension which,
with Weir and Wainwright at the back, would give Scotland a forest of
jump specialists.
Scotland surely isn't all that well off for players of 6ft 7in. as to
omit Weir who has meant so much to Scotland's lineout in various guises.
Capped 14 times as lock and 10 as No.8, Weir prefers the back-row job as
providing more involvement, more tackling as opposed to just chasing and
more ball in hand and decision making.
He has boosted his ballast to 16st 5lbs by regular work with weights
and he has been working hard on his scrummage pick-up timing and
technique. He may not yet be a Derek White in this art, but whereas
blindside flanker Carl Hogg and Weir would change berths whenever
Melrose signalled a pick-up move, that seems unnecessary nowadays.
Against Langholm last Saturday Weir effected a perfect pick-up and
swivel pass that released flanker Scott Aitken moving from right to
left, and in the South African Test one of Scotland's most threatening
moves stemmed from Weir picking up, selling a rich dummy going left, and
getting over the gain line before launching a move of seven passes that
ended with Scott Hastings being uprooted. Weir also was the one to scent
impending disaster though unable to prevent Joost van der Westhuizen
from scoring that embarrassing opening try.
Wallace, Smith, McIvor, Peters, Weir, Gordon Mackay, Iain Morrison,
Derek Turnbull (when released from bondage) Stuart Reid, Adam Roxburgh,
Fraser Dall, Gareth Flockhart, Stewart Bennett, and Murray Wallace are
quite a selection -- and that doesn't include one of last season's big
plusses, Peter Walton.
He is making progress following frustrating surgery to knee tendons
that has limited him to weights work and to a strict diet so that he
feels ''as strong as a bullock.'' He hopes that specialist advice and a
further scan will enable him to start serious training this month.
''My first target will be to get my place back in the Northampton
side,'' he said, ''then to come into contention for the England
international or even before that. I would love to be in the Scotland
party for the World Cup but clearly I will have to be in full action
well before that hopefully to make a good enough impression.''
Things indeed may well be looking up.

ALAN Wells believes his England A cricket team are ready to explode a
few myths about playing cricket in India after yesterday's 96-run
victory against India Youth.
Pace bowler Dominic Cork defied 80[DEG]F temperatures to bowl
unchanged between lunch and tea, including a burst of three for six
during his two-hour marathon, to break the back of the Indian resistance
and finish with figures of four for 46.
Leg-spinner Ian Salisbury, taking his match haul to nine for 141 with
three more wickets, and slow left-armer Richard Stemp (2-19) provided
the support as victory came 27 minutes after tea.
Wells was delighted with Cork's big-hearted effort and the fact that
he managed to get enough swing to prove effective in Indian conditions.
But the 33-year-old Sussex captain said another important lesson from
his side's opening first-class match was not to accept the traditional
view of English batsmen struggling against Indian spinners and English
spinners failing to trouble Indian batsmen.
''I haven't so far been over-impressed with the way their batsmen have
gone about playing our spinners,'' said Wells, ''and it's just a load of
rubbish to say Englishmen can't play the spin over here.
''To call this side an Indian Youth XI was to make it sound like they
were only a bunch of kids. But in fact they did have some older hands,
and some of their youngsters are very talented and probably Test players
of the near future.
''I was very pleased indeed with our victory. This is, of course, a
development tour for our younger players -- but I have told the team
that I want to win every match too. I want this tour to be as successful
as the A tour to South Africa last winter.''
Graham Gooch's England side had a nightmare time in India two years
ago, losing all three Tests, and poor technique against spin was one of
the major problems there.
Wells, who has a clearly talented and well-balanced team, is right to
be confident, but A team manager Phil Neale was more considered in his
assessment of the match.
Neale said: ''Overall I'm delighted, but on the batting side I would
like someone to show me he can go on and get a big score, even on a
turning pitch. Our best in this match was only 69, but I'm sure we can
improve on that.''
England A were made to fight for their win by a fourth-wicket stand of
103 between Jatinder Singh and Sridharin Sharath -- and that was just
what Neale and Wells wanted.
Both Indian batsmen hit accomplished half-centuries and were only
split when Cork made the first of his three late-afternoon strikes.
Neale said: ''I learn more about these players when they have to work
for their rewards.''
England A now travel to Madras, where their next four-day match --
against a Board Presidents XI containing several players on the verge of
the Indian Test team -- starts on Sunday.
* SOUTH Africa claimed a historic triumph when they beat New Zealand
by seven wickets to clinch their three-match Test series in Cape Town
yesterday. They became only the second team in Test history to win a
three-match series after having lost the opening game.
The only previous time was in 1888 when the great W G Grace led
England to a 2-1 win over Australia.
South Africa captain Hansie Cronje fittingly struck the winning
boundary off left-arm spinner Matthew Hart after the Proteas had been
set a third Test victory target of only 88.

AN unlikely partnership between a wholesale food broker and a
bookmaker is attempting to ensure that athletics history does not repeat
itself.
The pair have agreed to back Doug Walker, Edinburgh's new year sprint
winner, in his campaign to compete in this year's World Student Games
and next year's Atlanta Olympics.
The 21-year-old Edinburgh Athletic Club man won last weekend's 110
metres final off the back mark of 2.25m, clocking 10.95sec in the
opening round. It was the most spectacular sprinting seen at the annual
pedestrian gala since world professional record-holder George McNeill's
11.00 off scratch in 1971.
But McNeill, because he had signed professional football forms, and
had played, briefly, with Hibernian, was barred from racing as an
amateur. His time equated to running 100m in 10.00, but McNeill could
only watch in frustration as the 1972, '76 and '80 Olympic titles fell
to times of 10.14, 10.06 and 10.25, the last to fellow-Scot Allan Wells.
Now sanity prevails. Amateurs can race against Scotland's so-called
professionals, and Walker, who has won six British pro sprint titles,
but who also reached the Commonwealth Games semi-finals at 200m, has a
genuine chance to make an international name.
He has already committed his #4000 winnings, and share of the betting
returns, to a war chest for the next two years, but it will take much
more than that.
Enter food wholesaler Frank Hanlon, of Pro Am Athletics, the new year
meeting promoter, and David Miller, a bookie who makes his living at
Powderhall greyhound stadium, but who executed a little coup of his own
last weekend, backing Walker to win at 4-1.
''We saw George's talent go to waste as far as the amateurs were
concerned. Now we'd like to make sure Dougie gets every chance to
succeed,'' said Hanlon yesterday. ''We will contribute personally, and I
hope some other supporters of the meeting will chip in. We hope to
organise a sportsman's dinner in the summer. The proceeds would go to
Dougie, and to the new year meeting.''
Walker confirmed that in return, he has agreed to run at the ped
festival for the next two years. ''It's money for nothing, really,
because I would have run anyway,'' said the Heriott Watt student. ''I'm
just delighted to be paid for something I really enjoy doing.''
His own family apart, no amateur backer has offered to support Walker.
But the peds, viewed with such suspicion, have backed their faith in the
young amateur with hard cash. It is a gesture which will further tear
down the barriers between the two codes.
* SPANISH trio Martin Fiz, Diego Garcia, and Alberto Juzdado, the
first three finishers in the European championships marathon in Helsinki
last summer, will compete in the Nutrasweet London marathon on April 2.

THOSE left by the wayside must hope for selective amnesia in the
Highland League this afternoon. Forget Hampden, forget television
cameras, forget Chick and Hazel. Scottish Cup? Never heard of it.
It is unlikely to be so easy for the dozen clubs who must knuckle down
to the toil of league fixtures while four of their counterparts get on
with the business of competing on a national stage.
With many fans likely to head for the three cup ties going ahead in
the north, the remaining clubs may find themselves operating in front of
reduced attendances.
A game deserving of an audience is likely to be that at Elgin City,
who entertain a Brora Rangers side they have yet to defeat in three
attempts this season. City will field former Dundee, Raith Rovers, and
Dumbarton keeper Tom Carson as a stand-in for Craig Hinchcliffe, who is
suspended.
Brora's biggest recent problem has been getting a decent training
session because of poor weather in the north. They have not played since
December 17 and are desperate for a game.
Lossiemouth's title challenge took a dent last week when they went
down at home to Fort William. Manager Fraser Kellas has pledged to make
changes for today's match at home to Fraserburgh and even hinted that
some players may have played their last game for the club.
Meanwhile, Fraserburgh were in dispute with the SFA this week over
whether Ian Murray had amassed enough points to be suspended. They hope
to have the matter resolved in time for today's game.
Peterhead defender Craig Watson has flu and could sit out the game
against Forres, but team-mate Scott Anderson, the former Rangers and St
Johnstone defender, could be back soon after stomach muscle problems.
Deveronvale entertain Rothes, while Clach will have a pitch inspection
this morning to establish whether their game with Nairn County can go
ahead. A weather doubt also hangs over Fort William's 1.30pm kick-off
game against Wick Academy.

ARI Vatanen put himself firmly back in charge of the Paris-Dakar rally
yesterday, taking the sixth stage through the Moroccan desert by a
margin of almost 10 minutes to double his overall lead.
The Finnish veteran, who has won the event four times, was annoyed at
losing more than eight minutes on the 1993 champion Bruno Saby of France
on Thursday when two successive punctures cost him valuable time. But
his Citroen encountered no problems as he put it through its paces on
stage six and Saby's Mitsubishi had no answer even though he recorded
the second-best time of the day.
Vatanen's Finnish team- mate, Timo Salonen, who started the day in
third place, slipped down to fourth when his car lost more than
half-an-hour with mechanical problems.

ERNIE Els, the US Open champion, moved ominously into contention with
a second round of 67 in the Bell's Cup golf tournament yesterday in
George, South Africa.
Englishman Malcolm Mackenzie carded an eight-under-par 64 to take a
share of the halfway lead on 135 with compatriot Barry Lane and South
African Nic Henning. Lane returned a solid 69 and Henning a
four-under-par 68. They are one shot ahead of Els and fellow South
African Retief Goosen.
Els, who capped a glorious year by winning the Johnnie Walker world
championship in Jamaica last month, three-putted for a bogey at the
seventeenth, but looked relaxed but confident in a round containing
seven birdies.
Mackenzie, who began with a 71, three-putted for bogey at the first
yesterday. But he birdied the fourth from 10 feet, eagled the par-5
eighth with a driver and No.3 iron to 25 feet and picked up a further
shot at the ninth after firing a No.8 iron to three feet.
The Englishman, who has struggled for two years with a bad shoulder,
took advantage of slower greens on the back nine to come back in 31 with
five more birdies, including a 25-foot putt at the twelfth.
Leading aggregates (South Africans unless otherwise stated):
135 -- Barry Lane (Britain) 66, 69; Malcolm Mackenzie (Britain) 71,
64; Nic Henning 67, 68.
136 -- Ernie Els 69, 67; Retief Goosen 68, 68.
137 -- Hendrik Buhrmann 72, 65; Chris Williams (Britain) 71, 66; Wayne

HEAVY snow and winds have made it virtually impossible to get out and
about in the usual way up here in the Highlands. However, I'm happy to
report that we're all more or less recovered from our New Year excesses
despite Old Camperdown having taken to his bed for the week. I did my
best to dissuade him and Dawkins, our chauffeur, from going curling on
the loch on New Year's Day, but once he gets an idea into his head, you
know what he's like. It was just fortunate there was a tow rope in the
back of the Land Rover enabling us to haul them out of the water when
the ice cracked.
In the meantime, Henrietta, my sister, has telephoned from Barbados to
say that she and Trevor, her friend who does something in television,
have arrived safely, have booked into their luxury hotel, and are having
a wonderful time. Everybody, she says, is there, although she certainly
hasn't mentioned anybody from this part of the world that I know of.
Apparently she's already run into all sorts of glamorous people
including the actress Joan Collins, with Robin Hurlestone, Joan's
antique-dealer friend, Sir David and Lady Carina Frost (David also does
something in television), and Sir Rocco and Lady Forte, who own all
those restaurants and hotels. Personally I can't think of anything more
unnatural than taking one's clothes off in all that hot sun at this time
of year. Give me a good old blow on a snow-covered Scottish mountain any
day.
Torquil, our son, was in Glasgow last night for the Twelfth Night Ball
held for young things at the Albany Suite of the Forte Crest Hotel in
aid of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. As yet I haven't heard
how he got on, but he set off from here in great excitement looking ever
so grown-up wearing his dinner jacket with new tartan trews and a smart
blue velvet bow tie. This is the first time he's been to a ball in a
city and he's staying the weekend with a schoolfriend whose parents live
at Blanefield. It does make one feel rather emotional when one's
chickens start straying beyond the nest.
But goodness, what a social time all the young have been having of
late, what with the Shoestring Ball in Dunfermline between Christmas and
New Year, and those curiously named Sleeze Balls held in Perth and
Edinburgh. It reminds me so much of when I was a teenager myself and we
went to pony-club hops almost every night.
I also think it absolutely splendid the way they all love to dress up
formally nowadays whenever possible. Back in the 1970s all the smart
young things ever wanted to do was wear smelly denims, listen to John
Lennon records, and smoke funny cigarettes. Thank heavens all that seems
to be a thing of the past. It does make one feel so optimistic about the
future.
The big excitement tonight for Camperdown and myself, weather
permitting us to travel, is the Lauderdale Hunt Ball taking place at the
Victoria Hall in Selkirk. This is once again being organised by
Camperdown's chum Tony Hogarth, who farms at Mosshouses, and Susie Dun
who hails from the same neck of the woods.
Fiona, my daughter, became very excited when she read the italic
script on the invitation card and saw that we will be entertained by
somebody called George Michael. I couldn't understand what all the fuss
was about, but as it happens, she had misread what is said, and instead
we will be reeling to George Meikle and The Lothian Band, and, in
addition, dancing to the Strangers Band, who play more modern music, I'm
told.
Having so far missed out on all of the Borders hunt balls this season
-- the Jedforest, the College Valley, and the Buccleuch (the last held
in a marquee specially erected on Kelso Racecourse and all but blown
away) -- our chums in Roxburgh, Selkirk, and Peeblesshire must think we
have forgotten all about them. On this basis, I'm insisting Camperdown
and I make the effort to join our house-party at Galashiels for
tonight's bash.
I'm longing to see the Hon. Gerald and Ros Maitland-Carew with son and
daughter from Thirlestane Castle at Lauder. I should imagine there'll be
lots of Scott-Plummers, Strang Steels, Hepburn Scotts, Maxwell-Scotts,
and even, possibly, some Montagu Douglas Scotts.
I regret to say that Fiona and I had a little tiff about whether she
and Fraser, her young man, should come with us or go along with some of
Fraser's farming chums from Gattonside, a rather rowdy lot, from what I
hear. In the end she got her way, as always, but at least has agreed not
to wear the clinging Belleville Sassoon crepe flared trousers and the
crepe and sequin Katherine Hamnett top I bought for her on my last trip
to London.
She seems to have put on rather a lot of weight recently and I've
managed to convince her a silk bias-cut slip dress from Catherine Walker
is, for the time being, far more flattering to her figure. As you know
Camperdown and I have been absolutely delighted at the transformation in
the dear girl since she started stepping out with Fraser, such a
suitable young man.
But although she looks happier and healthier than I've ever seen her,
I've told her she simply must start watching the calories. A small,
fresh salad for one's midday meal is perfectly sufficient.

TWELVE months ago, the Kenyan world 5000 metres champion, Ismael
Kirui, toyed with the field in the World Cross Challenge at Mallusk,
writes Doug Gillon. He was confident enough to confine his winning
margin over Dave Lewis to just one second.
Kirui returns to Belfast for the same event today, and after his
success last weekend at Durham, few will doubt his ability again to win
as he pleases. Such style ensures that Kenyan cross-country
invincibility remains far more than a myth.
The line-up in the men's event provides formidable opposition for
Scots Robert Quinn, Graeme Wight and Adrian Callan. It includes another
Kenyan, James Kariuki, brother of five-times world champion John Ngugi,
former double world champion John Treacy, Rob Denmark, Philemon Hanneck,
and John Nuttall, the three Commonwealth medallists at 5000m from
Victoria, plus three-times English champion Lewis.
The winner of the women's event at Durham, another Kenyan, 18-year-old
Rose Cheruiyot, and Kirui's sister, Catherine, fourth in the Sao Paulo
15k race on Hogmanay, will also be in action. Sue Ridley, only survivor
from the Scottish women's team 12 months ago, hopes to improve on
twenty-second place then.

GERMANY will meet Ukraine in today's final of the Hopman Cup after
Boris Becker overcame a rash of double faults yesterday to complete a
comfortable semi-final victory over France in Perth, Australia.
World No.3 Becker served four double faults in a row at one stage
before disposing of Jean-Philippe Fleurian 7-6, 7-6, reserving his best
form for the tie-breaks in which he won 14 of the 15 points played.
Anke Huber's 6-2, 6-1 thrashing of Julie Halard meant the second seeds
have yet to drop a set in their respective singles rubbers. The pair are
now favourites to emulate Steffi Graf and Michael Stich, who secured
Germany's only previous success at the mixed team tournament two years
ago.
Becker, who served 15 aces against Austria on Wednesday, unleashed
another 11 against Fleurian, but agreed his serve had been erratic.
''My serve was on and off. Eight double faults, especially four in one
game, is too many. I don't remember ever serving four doubles in a row
before. I just lost my concentration,'' he said.
Becker now has to face world No.15 Andrei Medvedev in a potentially
enthralling final which is likely to cause conflicting emotions for
Huber. Her close companion, Andrei Medvedev, is gleefully awaiting a
mixed doubles encounter with the 20-year-old, and a blushing Huber
confessed she was praying for an outright German victory in the singles.
* TOP seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov was dumped out of the Australian men's
hardcourt championship by local favourite Mark Woodforde on a
wind-affected day in Adelaide.
Woodforde coped better with the tricky conditions to beat the Russian
6-3, 7-5 and set up a semi-final against Jim Courier, who accounted for
Swede Thomas Enqvist 6-2, 6-4.
The other semi-final will pit Richard Krajicek against Frenchman
Arnaud Boetsch. The Dutchman had a 6-4, 7-6 victory in a big-serving
duel with Australian Pat Rafter, while Boetsch beat Germany's Hendrik
Dreekman 6-3, 6-4.

SCRUM half Rupert Moon has been axed from the Wales side who begin
their defence of the Five Nations' Championship against France on
January 21.
Moon is replaced in Paris by Robert Jones, who has played in only two
of Wales' last 20 internationals since losing his place to Moon two
years ago.
The British Lion, who will win his forty-ninth cap, is one of four
changes to the side beaten 20-12 by South Africa in Cardiff in November.
Moon's Llanelli team-mate, Phil Davies, returns for the injured Emyr
Lewis and to play his first international at No.8 for more than three
years.
Stuart Davies comes in at blind-side flanker instead of Hemi Taylor,
who has been ruled out with a hand injury. Nigel Walker returns on the
wing at the expense of his club-mate, Simon Hill, after recovering from
surgery on a shoulder and a knee.
Wales have not won in Paris for 20 years, but coach Alan Davies is not
worried. ''The game will be a good measure for us at the start of World
Cup year,'' he said.
''We have to be able to demonstrate that we can compete well against
sides like France, who beat New Zealand down under last summer.
''A lot of people might be writing us off because of our injury
problems, but they shouldn't underestimate the resolve of the players.''
Wales -- A Clement (Swansea); W Proctor (Llanelli), M Hall (Cardiff),
M Taylor (Pontypool), N Walker (Cardiff); N Jenkins (Pontypridd), R
Jones (Swansea); R Evans (Llanelli), G Jenkins (Swansea), J Davies
(Neath), Gareth Llewellyn (Neath), captain, D Jones (Cardiff), S Davies
(Swansea), P Davies (Llanelli), R Collins (Pontypridd). Replacements --
M Back (Bridgend), R Moon (Llanelli), L Jones (Treorchy), M Griffiths
(Cardiff), A Copsey (Llanelli), R McBryde (Swansea).

THE waiting is almost over for Chris Hillcoat. The pain, the
frustration, and the endless hours of having to watch his mates on the
field from the stand could be relegated to memories if the defender is
chosen to run out for Hamilton Accies in today's vital promotion match
against Raith Rovers at Stark's Park.
It is more than 20 months since Hillcoat, now 25, received a cruciate
injury to his right knee at Somerset Park against Ayr United.
For the remainder of that year, he fought to be fit again, but in the
end, a operation was the only answer. He had three of them down in
Cambridge, performed by David Dandy, who had got players such as Niall
Quinn, George Burley, and Alan Shearer back playing again after similar
problems.
As things would have it, just as Hillcoat was reaching peak fitness
through reserve outings, he was sent off against Morton two-and-a-half
weeks ago and suspended.
Now, he is in the squad for the match away to Raith Rovers, and with
Paul McKenzie due to start a suspension on Monday, there is a fair
chance he could play at some stage, if not from the beginning.
Hillcoat said: ''I played at left back against Albion Rovers reserves
in the first half last night, and sweeper in the second. I know I am fit
enough to play, and I have no fears about my knee. Now, it's up to the
manager when he thinks I am ready for first-team duty.''
The game at Stark's Park will have a major bearing on whether or not
Raith and Accies can get closer to the top three of Dundee, Dunfermline,
and Airdrie.
Both sides have had excellent results over the holiday period, and
while Raith are all fit and ready to try to keep to manager Jimmy
Nicholl's target of four holidays wins -- they have two out of two so
far -- Hamilton also draft in 17-year-old winger Paul Hartley, who has
been starring in the reserves.
Top of the table Dundee, whose leader Jim Duffy is Bells' Manager of
the Month, will be without Morten Wieghorst, who is on duty with Denmark
at a tournament in Saudi Arabia, for the home match against a Stranraer
side who came off the bottom of the first division last week for the
first time since the autumn. John McQuillan, however, will be back.
Stranraer will have to change the line-up which defeated Clydebank
last week, because of injuries to Billy Ferguson, Graham Duncan, Darren
Henderson and Lex Grant, and Steve Cody is suspended. But as manager
Alex McAnespie wryly commented: ''With all the injuries and suspensions
we've had this season, I'm used to permutations.''
Dunfermline travel to Clydebank without the injured Neale Cooper, but
Norrie McCathie is back after suspension, and striker Gary Higgins is
listed. Bankies have Paul Agnew out injured, and Davie Cooper is
suffering from a sore throat which probably will mean at least a couple
of changes as they try to edge clear of the relegation zone.
Another club desperate for points are St Mirren and they will have new
signing, Grant Inglis, in the squad to face bottom club Ayr United at
Somerset Park. Inglis, signed from Junior club Shotts, has scored three
goals in a couple of reserve games and manager Jimmy Bone is hoping that
the new striker's experience will help to pull Saints clear of the drop
zone.
Keeper Campbell Money is suspended after last week's red card
following the game at Dundee, and 16-year-old Derek Scrimgeour from
Johnstone Burgh will be on the bench. Ayr's Kevin Biggart is still out
injured.
Airdrie try to pick up the pieces after a disastrous holiday spell
when they take on St Johnstone at Broadwood. Their promotion hopes have
taken quite a dent with defeats by Raith Rovers and Hamilton, plus a
goalless draw against Dunfermline -- one point from nine being all they
have to show for their efforts. They are boosted today with the return
of Paul Jack after injury.

LOOKING for a piper for your Burns Supper? Well, Business Diary has a
volunteer in the form of Mark Tennant, the managing director in Scotland
of the Chase Manhattan Bank.
Mark is a keen piper who does not appear to care where he plays. This
is not a reference to his appearance at the Quality Street festive party
in the Winter Gardens at the People's Palace in Glasgow.
Business Diary is thinking more of his early-morning rendition in the
Ginza, Tokyo's equivalent of Sauchiehall Street, which led to him being
arrested, or his ear-splitting performance on a Jumbo jet while in the
air between Hong Kong and the Philippines.
Mr Tennant assures the Diary that the reaction to both performances
had nothing to do with his ability on the bagpipes. ''There is a law in
Japan against jaywalking which is why I was arrested on that occasion,
and yes the noise was horrendous on the jumbo which meant that I was not
too popular with other passengers, but that was because of the low
ceiling.''
He cited as proof of his pipe-playing ability the fact that he has
played at Quality Street's last three Festive Parties. He did not,
however, mention that he was a non-executive director of Quality Street
which may have played some part in his presence at these events.
Kidding aside, Mark Tennant has been playing the pipes since he was
six years old and played for a number of pipe bands in Morayshire where
he was brought up.
In recent years business commitments have restricted his bagpipe
playing, although he did entertain Chase Manhattan executives to some
traditional Scottish airs at a dinner in Connecticut.
This year Mark was invited to play at a Burns Supper in Elgin but
unfortunately he is due to be in London on business that day and could
not accept the invite.
If you are looking for a piper for your Burns Supper, Mark says he
would be happy to oblige. He can be contacted on 0383 737432.
Stay-away
day guide
GLASGOW Chamber of Commerce have just published their ''when not to
go'' guide of 110 Scottish towns.
In Scotland we all go on holiday at different times which means that
the shops and offices in one town can be closed while their neighbours
are busy working away.
The Chamber's ''Scottish Public Holidays 1995'' booklet lists the
trades and other holidays taken by towns such as Auchtermuchty,
Gorebridge, Findochty, Knockando, Mosstodloch and Wishaw.
Other conurbations such as Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen are
of course also mentioned.
The booklet reveals that you can go to Arbroath on July 24 if you want
to enjoy the St Tammas holiday, or to Galashiels on June 30 for the Braw
Lads gathering but if you want to go shopping don't go to Montrose on
June 26 when the shopkeepers are having their midsummer holiday or to
Cupar on February 13 when they have their shopkeepers' holiday.
The booklet costs #2 from the Information and Publications department
of the Glasgow Chamber. It could certainly save businesses a lot of time
wondering why no-one is answering the phone at the other end.
Surprises for
birthday boys
THERE were two surprise birthday parties on January 2 in the Slater
family.
Estate agent Roy Slater thought he was going for a quiet meal with
some friends when he was surprised by 140 friends and relatives in the
Sherbrooke Castle Hotel in Pollokshields, Glasgow.
Meanwhile, thirty miles away at the Marine Hotel in Troon, his uncle,
Hugh Kennedy who, before his retirement, ran the R &amp; H Kennedy dairy
firm on the south side of Glasgow was also surprised.
There was, however, one slight difference in the surprises in that Roy
was celebrating his 50th birthday while it was his uncle's 90th
birthday.
''I thought we were only stopping at the Sherbrooke to change cars
before going on to a friend's house,'' explains Roy, ''when suddenly all
these people appeared.''
Gerry Scobie, a friend and business partner of Roy who organised the
surprise, said: ''It was a wonderful night, and I have to congratulate
the 150 or so people we invited for keeping the secret. We had the Harry
Margolis ten-piece Glen Miller sound band and they were great.''
No retirement
card for Smith
EXILED Scot James Smith's departure from the Hong Kong Hilton has been
delayed as the hotel, which was due to close this month, has been given
an extension until April 30.
Mr Smith, who has been in the Far East for 33 years, has no intention
of retiring however. ''I'm an active sixty-year-old,'' he told me, ''and
I will be staying on in Hong Kong for another year to tie up some
business matters before returning to Scotland.''
Despite his lengthy absence abroad Mr Smith has kept in touch with the
home country through twice-yearly visits, and as this Diary has reported
in the past he has organised an annual Scottish week of events in Hong
Kong to promote Scottish goods.
He is coming home next month for a short visit when he will be brought
up to date with progress on the proposal to convert Kinfauns Castle in
Perthshire into a hotel.
''We are looking at the feasibility of the project. One of the wings
of the castle is in very bad condition, and another major problem is
where we would relocate the kitchens as food and service is very
important in any good hotel.''
OFT has cartels
in its sights
BUSINESS cartels better watch out for the Office of Fair Trading has
formed their own equivalent of the FBI's Elliot Ness Untouchables.
The OFT has formed a Cartels Task Force to take on the cartels and
have contacted Chambers of Commerce, and other business organisations
throught the country asking for information.
A confidential hotline 0171 269 8888 has been set up, and Alan Conroy,
head of the Task Force, in his letter to business organisations, said:
''The knowledge that your members possess of business activity and
practice in your area is invaluable and they may well be aware of the
possibility of secret cartels.''
He went on: ''It is a measure of our concern that a special telephone
line has been established to help people wishing to talk to us in strict
confidence about any worries they may have on this subject. If they wish
to remain anonymous it is important that they give as much details as
possible to enable us to pursue our inquiries.''
The special telephone number will be manned at all times during normal
office hours and there will be an answering facility outside of these
hours.
The OFT were reluctant to give any further information about their
special task force but if your company or organisation wants any more
information then Alan Conroy and the members of his Task Force are happy
to visit and explain ''why cartels are harmful and how their effects may
be reduced and prevented''.
The question is how will they know that they are not being invited
along to address a secret cartel!
Dinner date for
Fife Chamber
FIFE Chamber of Commerce has invited the Earl of Dalkeith and Allan
Denholm of Wm Grant &amp; Sons Distillers to be their guest speakers at
their annual dinner in the Dean Park Hotel, Kirkcaldy, on February 23.
The Earl of Dalkeith has been invited in his capacity as a member of
the Millenium committee.
The Chamber expects between 250 and 300 to attend the dinner and if
you are interested in attending you should call them on 01592 201932 for
tickets.
On track for
lively debate
SIR Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, is to be the keynote
speaker at a major Scottish Transport Conference to be held in the SECC
on March 30.
The conference entitled ''Integrated or isolated: Scotland's economic
regeneration through Transport'' is expected to attract 500 delegates
and a booking form can be obtained from Carol Henderson at Alan Clark
Associates, 4 Woodside Place, Glasgow G3 7QF. Telephone 041 353 5040.
It promises to be a lively day as Charles Winter, formerly chief
executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland and now deputy president of the
British Chambers of Commerce which is supporting the conference, is
quoted as describing Scotland's existing transport links as a
''hotch-potch''.
Pruning lesson
for banker
DAVID Griffin, director of structured finance in the Bank of
Scotland's Corporate Division, was recently called upon to lend his
expertise to the #12m management buy-out of the Kennedy Garden Centres
from Travis Perkins.
David was more than happy to give the Kennedy management team the
benefit of his own expertise, but while he was at it he thought that he
could call on some of their expertise.
Setting aside the complexities of the #12m deal for a second the
banker asked the garden experts: ''What's happened to my apple tree? For
six years it gave me lots of lovely apples, but for the last two years
there has not been an apple in sight.''
The Kennedy management team, relieved that they had not been asked
another tricky financial question, put their heads together and came up
with a possible answer. ''You have probably overpruned it. Leave it
alone and it will be all right next year.''
Pity we can't all be gardening experts when we see our bank managers.

ITALIAN superstar Alberto Tomba stormed to his sixth Alpine skiing
world cup win of the season yesterday in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, by
taking a giant slalom.
Tomba, who had built up an impressive lead after the first leg, swept
down the treacherous, icy course in an unofficial combined time of 2min
12.01sec.
Slovenia's Mitja Kunc and Harald Strand-Nilsen of Norway finished
equal second in 2-12.94 ahead of Slovenia's Jure Kosir, fourth in
2-13.04.
Austria's Christian Mayer, lying second after the first leg, failed to
negotiate the last gate of the course in the second run, robbing himself
of a certain second place.
Yesterday's win was Tomba's thirty-ninth world cup victory, and his
twelfth in a giant slalom.
The win consolidates his overall world cup lead after his main rival,
Norway's defending world cup holder Kjetil Andre Aamodt, crashed out of
the race in the first leg.
The giant slalom is the strongest discipline of all-rounder Aamodt,
while Tomba does not compete in the speed races.
Conditions in the second leg were better than in the first when
snowfall made negotiation of the icy surface of the piste more
difficult.
More than 10,000 Italians and local Slovenians created a festive
atmosphere as they packed the sides of the course to cheer on Tomba and
local heroes Kunc and Kosir.
Tomba, wearing the slogan ''Stop the war'' on his bib, as did all the
racers, said he was dedicating his win to those suffering from the war
in regions of former Yugoslavia.
''I dedicate this win to those who are the victims of the crazy war so
near to where we are today,'' he said. ''I keep on thinking of these
people.''
He also said he was prepared to help skiers from Bosnia who would be
taking part in the world championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain, which
start later this month.
Tomba's overall world cup tally is now 650 points, more than 300 ahead
of second-placed Michael von Gruenigen of Switzerland, who is on 316,
while defending title holder Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway is fourth on
302.

THE Scottish Cup used to consist of six first-round ties and eight at
the next stage before the survivors made the draw with the big guns.
With the Scottish League now consisting of 40 clubs, the division of
ties is now an untidy four in the first round and 12 in the second.
The SFA's ambivalent attitude to seeding protects the league's top-20
clubs but penalises the bottom half. Second division Dumbarton went out
in the first round to Stirling Albion, who visit Brechin today in the
second round, while Queen of the South and Clyde are two other Division
2 sides who meet head to head.
The eight non-league teams were fortunate to receive first-round byes,
and four of them are in direct conflict today.
Keith or Huntley will continue to represent the Highlands after their
meeting today, while Burntisland Shipyard will be expected to advance at
the expense of St Cuthbert Wanderers, who lost 11 goals to Ross County
last year.
Ian Thain, the Keith keeper, will be making his 208th consecutive
appearance in the derby clash -- it will be five years and a day since
he last missed a Keith game.
Ross County should be unchanged for their visit to Alloa, who are hit
by suspensions, injuries, and 'flu.
These clubs know each other well having met twice already in the cup
in recent years before becoming third division rivals this term.
Stirling include keeper Mike Monaghan for the visit to Brechin. He
steps in for Mark McGeown, who was injured in Albion's abandoned game at
Broadwood earlier this week.
Stenhousemuir wait for John McNiven for the home game against
Arbroath, while East Fife should be unchanged for their home tie against
Gala Fairydean whose midfielder, Craig Sinclair, may be the player to
watch.
Berwick Rangers' Mark Wilson is injured and Martin Neil suspended for
the visit to Buckie, while Cowdenbeath have Craig Winter back after
suspension for their visit to Cove Rangers.
Queen of the South's Steve Ramsay and Steve Mallon are suspended and
so miss the visit of Clyde who add Martin Clark and Keith Knox to their
squad.
Forfar should be unchanged at home to Meadowbank who add Ian Little
and Mark Thomson. A shock would seem most likely at Rosewell,
Midlothian, the home of cup giant killers Whitehill Welfare.
Their visitors are Montrose, who are off form at present and also will
have to do without the suspended Mark Garden and Derek Grant.
* RAPID Bucharest have joined Napoli in asking UEFA to check a claim
that Eintracht Frankfurt have broken the ''three foreigner'' rule.
The Romanians were beaten 6-2 on aggragate in the second round of the
UEFA Cup by the Germans, who went on to beat Napoli 2-0 on aggregate in
the next round.
But Napoli have protested that Eintracht fielded more than the
permitted three foreigners, claiming that Slobodan Komljenovic had lost
his assimilated status by playing for Yugoslavia.
And now Rapid have joined in the row regarding Komljenovic.

AFTER many years of creating my long and distinguished record of
absolute failure at heeding all those bright New Year resolutions, I
have given up.
Instead it seems more sensible to lay this annual responsibility for
self-improvement upon the broad shoulders of some of those men and women
who run our major organisations. They are much better equipped to
deliver.
With this in mind, I therefore dedicate the following resolutions to
these brave souls.
For Tom Farmer my resolution would be that he wastes no time in
snapping up another of those competing fast-fit chains launched
unsuccessfully by motor trade majors in a bid to compete with the
Kwik-Fit legend. Farmer has the cash and the drive to do it, and it
would cement his already firm grip on this market in the UK.
I do have a second resolution for Tom and it's that he slows down on
his outside commitments. He has a bewildering array of involvements,
ranging from his chairmanship of Investors in People Scotland and board
membership of Scottish Enterprise to personal investments in Hibs and
several other companies.
He also makes himself available on the dinner-speaking circuit to
considerable effect. There's no sign that this activity affects the
performance of Kwik-Fit one iota, but surely the man must rest some
time. Doesn't he?
For John Ward and Lex Gold, the new team putting spark back into the
CBI in Scotland, their resolution has to be to put a bomb under
complacent and ignorant politicians of all hues who remain determinedly
ignorant about the true requirements of competitive companies. Their
weapon will be the launch later this year of a strong Agenda for
Business -- effectively the business community's demand for government
action to improve skills, technology, communications and other parts of
the support infrastructure that companies require if they are to succeed
wherever their markets may be.
I've another resolution for John Ward. It is that when he takes early
retirement as planned later this year from his employer, IBM, that he
finds new responsibilities that give him the freedom to continue
campaigning for a wider understanding of business's true needs.
For the top trio at Scottish Enterprise -- chairman Donald MacKay,
chief executive Crawford Beveridge and national operations group
director Robert Crawford -- my resolution would be that they spend more
time this year directly communicating their plans and objectives.
Now that the shape of the organisation is settling down, it's clear
there is much interesting, important work going on within the SE network
to tackle some fundamental issues about our economy and its long-term
development. Yet these issues are not well understood and SE would
probably do itself a favour if it devoted more time to strategic
communication from the top.
For two other public sector people with a prospect of being
privatised, Chris Green of ScotRail and James Hann of Scottish Nuclear,
I would resolve to be more openly impatient if not actually critical of
a government which when faced with financial reality ducks and dives to
achieve its political ends regardless of the damage caused in the
process.
For the leading lights of those Scottish companies floated on the
stock market last year, including Brian Souter and Ann Gloag of
Stagecoach, the Wiseman brothers of dairy fame, Stefan Kay of Inveresk
and Graeme Alexander of Devro, my resolution is one that they probably
already have embossed in brass on their desks -- to be aggressive,
acquisitive and ambitious. These are important companies for our small
economy, and we need lots more like them.
Speaking of which, I would resolve on behalf of the likes of Gio
Benedetti (Benedetti Holdings), Eric Herd (Farmfoods), Stewart Milne of
the eponymous housing group, Pat and Alex Grant (Norfrost) and Dan
Wright (Albion Automotive) to continue their independent growth path and
resist all approaches to sell the business. In the past year several
outstanding Scottish companies have been sold to larger players,
including McGavigans and Donprint, and we do not want this trend to turn
into a trample.
For Dr George Mathewson of the Royal Bank, my resolution is that he
becomes the first Scottish company boss to produce a #1000m profit. And
for his newly-elevated rival, Sir Bruce Pattullo of Bank of Scotland, I
resolve that he makes the utmost mileage from this year's 300th birthday
celebrations.
Well, that was the easy part. Now all these good people have to do is
get on with it. Me, I'll stick to beating budget this year.

THERE was mixed fortune for Scotland's young squash players in the
under-19 home international championship in Aberdeen last night.
The girls' moved a step closer to ending England's unbeaten run in the
event with a victory over Wales, but the boys' hopes of retaining second
place suffered a blow when they went down 3-2.
With Wales 2-1 up, Scottish hopes rested with Neil Dickson but he went
down 9-4, 9-4, 9-3 against Matthew Benjamin in the top match.
0 But there seldom was a doubt about the girls' result, with all five
ties finishing in straight games in the Scots' favour.
Gail Davie and Jane Dickson, Neil's younger sister, celebrated their
first caps at this level by giving Scotland a 2-0 lead.
Lisa McKenna, in the top tie, then ended the match as a contest with a
9-4, 9-0, 9-1 scoreline against Julia Wells.
Scotland meet Ireland this morning and England in the afternoon.
Results:
Boys. Scotland 2, Wales 3 (N Dickson lost to M Benjamin 4-9, 4-9, 3-9;
C Hamilton beat G Webber 9-6, 9-5, 9-6; G Grant lost to G Tippings 3-9,

DENNIS HENRY'S spare bedroom is a revelation. In a neat villa above
the Clyde at Bothwell, this ''retired'' business consultant maintains a
corporate database which would put many large commercial rivals to
shame.
Single-handedly, Henry currently sifts the annual reports and accounts
of 715 of the UK's listed commercial and industrial concerns. The
computerised database he has developed together with two colleagues, a
modem away in the Cotswolds and Cornwall respectively, may not match the
sample size of a Datastream or an ICC. But the depth of analysis --
running to around a hundred key ratios for each company -- is awesomely
exhaustive.
In his time Dennis Henry has been accused of industrial espionage and
a lot more besides by senior executives who can't understand how he
knows what he knows about the relative performance of their business.
But, far from spying, Henry simply knows how to wring a set of
accounts dry of every drop of information, how to impute further key
data from what is explicitly stated in the accounts, and, by storing it
all for years back (a minimum of four years, currently up to seven years
in some cases), how to use a desktop computer to track and compare a
company's performance against itself, against a particular rival,
against its sector, or against any other benchmark anyone cares to
mention.
I first encountered Dennis Henry in the early 1980s, when he was
working for the consultants Inbucon, latterly P-E Inbucon, and was
persistently vocal about the deleterious effects of the hostile takeover
boom then sweeping through the crumbling ranks of corporate Scotland.
With a key stroke or two, he could, and did, tell you precisely what
proportion of the market capitalisation of Scotland's cohort of listed
companies had already been gobbled up -- or any other measure of the
progressive loss of corporate independence which might impress the more.
During the abortive Elders bid for Scottish &amp; Newcastle, his data was
used by S&amp;N itself, the SDA, Scottish Financial Enterprise, the STUC and
the Scottish Office in forming the case for the defence. Henry was even
asked to provide evidence for the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission
itself.
That spare bedroom boasts the original of an FT cartoon depicting a
couple of southern hunting types, boasting to the locals about the
bulging bag from their weekend up north -- a few brace of grouse, a
stag, some salmon and a couple of listed Scottish plcs. It accompanied a
letter to the Pink 'Un from Henry calling for the principles of wildlife
conservancy to be extended to Scotland's endangered corporate base.
Dennis Henry went to Hutchesons Grammar School; got through, in his
own words, by the skin of his teeth, thanks to a borderline performance
in English; and joined the Army, where he was commissioned in Signals.
He was involved in the Berlin airlift and, on returning to Scotland,
went to university and took a first-class BSc. He went into textiles,
joining the original Viyella company at its Newhouse plant, the factory
Honeywell was later to occupy. But, at 32, he quit, when a new owner
with whom Henry felt he couldn't do business appeared on the scene.
He then spent three years helping friends to run a smaller textile
company. When they decided there was a decent living in it for all of
them, Henry left, in 1963, to become a consultant with AIC, which six
years later changed its name to Inbucon.
Apart from an 18-month spell in Turkey in the late 1960s, all Henry's
consultancy was done in the UK. By the late seventies he was heavily
involved in a series of corporate rescues and restructurings, for the
Highlands and Islands Development Board among others.
He talks fondly of finding an alternative future for the redundant
Massey Ferguson plant in Kilmarnock -- it might have become an assembly
plant for MG sports cars if British Leyland hadn't taken cold feet --
and of luring Jaegar to a redundant clothing factory in Campbeltown
where they still make suits today.
Henry first got the database bug in the seventies, when he saw a
listing of 150 Scottish companies in a business magazine. He put the
details into Inbucon's mainframe, started playing around with them, and
published some of the results.
''I couldn't get the information I wanted, when I wanted it, from
standard databases. The only alternative was to assemble my own,'' he
recalls. The process proved cumbersome, so Henry's enthusiasm cooled for
a time. But the seed had been planted.
When Apple 2 desktop computers came on the scene in the early
eighties, augmented by VisiCalc's pioneering spreadsheet software, Henry
was hooked again. That was how he did his analysis of the impact of
takeovers on Scottish companies. ''I realised I was getting into
something good. The company did as well,'' he says now.
He developed a database of 250 UK companies, excluding financial and
property companies because their numbers conform to different norms.
Some of the results started appearing a couple of times a year in the
Sunday Times. Then he developed a database of the top 250 companies in
Europe and discovered that, in the top fifty on the criteria he was
using, there were 28 UK companies and only two from Germany. That
challenge to orthodox opinion at the time gained a lot of publicity too.
In his last three years with P-E Inbucon, Henry was director of
business performance, with responsibilities across the UK. But
retirement in 1989 opened up the opportunity to do the things he really
wanted to do, develop that database to new levels.
The starting point were the constituents of the FT-500 index and all
listed Scottish non-financial plcs. The total has now grown to 715. From
each company, Henry requires a minimum of four years' past reports and
accounts and each new set, not when they are lodged with Companies
House, but when they are sent to shareholders.
That puts quite a strain on the postal service in Bothwell,
particularly when all the companies with December year-ends start
producing reports and accounts in the spring. Some days they come by the
sackload.
Henry puts all the relevant data into the system the day each report
arrives. That means he has up-to-date information on stream much faster
than the larger commercial databases. He also uses interims and
preliminary announcements picked up from the newspapers to sharpen the
database's focus even more.
But all that raw data would wither and die if Henry did not also have
at his fingertips a suite of software to process ratios, produce
comparisons and make sense of the whole exercise. That software is the
fruit of a four-year-old collaboration with two colleagues, Geoff Smith
and Alan Rowntree. Collectively they trade as Vi Consultants. Vi stands
for value improvement.
Rowntree, based in Cornwall, has developed the software tools. The
database, known as VICbase, and a series of decision modelling tools are
available on licence or through outright purchase.
With a dynamic database and a powerful analytical tool, Henry can
examine the performance of more than 700 of the UK's most important
industrial and commercial companies in extraordinary detail. From
directors' pay to spending on R&amp;D, from dividend policy to the level of
audit fees, he can draw comparisons which prompt myriad questions about
why companies perform the way they do.
As I watched, Henry took the example of one major Scottish industrial
group and showed how a 1% improvement on seven key ratios could add #14m
to pre-tax profits.
''Many directors have no conception of the sensitivity of the
decisions they take,'' he sighs, demonstrating, in another case, the
dramatically superior impact of a modest increase in price compared with
shifting ever larger volumes of discounted product.
One of Henry's favourite ratios is added value per # of pay. ''The
single most sensistive ratio we've come across,'' he says. ''It ties
right into cash flow and that's effectively what determines shareholder
value.''
And yet Dennis Henry seems reluctant to see the database used for
stock selection. ''You are taking the accounts as published to be a true
and fair account of the company's position. I once bought shares in
Coloroll, which partly answers your question.'' For now Henry is much
more concerned to see his tool used to sharpen up executive and
corporate performance.
Almost all the data he deals in is historic. From the hundred or so
ratios only contracts placed and contracts approved are predictive. ''We
are trying to build linkages between company capitalisation and
performance trends. If we solve that one, I'll be the first person to
use it.''

MORAG Yellowlees would be the first to admit that she is more
comfortable playing outdoor hockey to the new-fangled indoor game, but
it was in the latter yesterday that she became a heroine for Edinburgh
Ladies against Rot-Weiss Munich in the Arminen Invitation in Vienna.
With the sides locked at 4-4 -- and with only two minutes left on the
clock -- Yellowlees shot the Scottish champions into the lead. Then Gill
Messenger put the outcome beyond doubt by completing her hat trick.
This unexpected victory went some way towards erasing the
embarrassment of their defeat by Austrian side Econsult, who turned a
3-0 interval deficit into a 8-5 victory -- despite a hat trick by Elaine
Cooper.
In the men's event, MIM opened their campaign with a 6-4 victory over
Verona and later qualified for the semi-finals by beating Royal White
Star 4-2 with Andrew Kay netting a double. Results:
Men. Group A -- Pocztowiec 13, Zurich Grasshoppers 5; Limburg 5, WAC
10; Zurich Grasshoppers 4, WAC 11; Pocztowiec 4, Limburg 5. Group B --
MIM 6, Verona 4; Royal White Star 4, Arminen 8; Verona 4, Arminen 11;
MIM 4, Royal White Star 2.
Women. Econsult 8, Edinburgh Ladies 5; Rot-Weiss Munich 11, Stade
Francais 3; Rot-Weiss Munich 4, Edinburgh Ladies 6; Eintracht Frankfurt

HAMMY McMillan's European curling champions rink won their third
straight game at the Stakis Masters in Perth last night, defeating Robin
Gray and his Forest Hills team 6-4. They now meet Switzerland's Marcus
Eggler this morning for a place in the quarter-finals.
Eggler, of course, was the victor over McMillan in the 1992 World
championships and the Scottish rink have been hoping they would be given
a chance to gain a little compensation.
Last night, Eggler's rink defeated Warwick Smith's local team 5-3.
Smith, one of several up and coming younger skips, had earlier won two
games before facing the might of the Eggler foursome.
Colin Hamilton defeated John Muir and his Hamilton team 4-2 and Gordon
Muirhead's Kinross rink got the better of Dieter Wuest in a one-sided
match with a 7-0 count.
Favourites and holders of the Masters, David Smith and his 1991 World
champions, survived a tough encounter against Lockerbie's Stuart Byers,
winning 6-5 after an extra end, but only after they posted a duce in the
eighth end before stealing a point in the ninth for their win. Results:

NICK Faldo, like Nick Price, Ernie Els, and Jose-Maria Olazabal, was
not present at a waterlogged La Costa course in San Diego yesterday as
31 tournament winners of 1994 completed 36 exhausting holes to get the
rain-delayed Mercedes championship back on schedule.
In the gloaming, the little-known John Huston led by two strokes from
the 1993 US Open champion, Lee Janzen, with veteran Craig Stadler a shot
further back.
But the tall Briton, although he did not qualify for this ''Tournament
of Champions'' unlike the aforesaid grand-slammers who all turned down
invitations, nevertheless is very much in the front window at this
luxury resort.
''Faldo's presence will make the coming season an even greater one
than 1994,'' declared the new US Commissioner, Tim Finchem.
''He is one of the supreme players in the world game and when I spoke
to him recently he gave me the impression that he's not joining us just
for a single season but for the foreseeable future,'' the commissioner
added.
Ironically, the career strategy of Faldo, who seems to have turned his
back on European golf for a variety of well-publicised reasons including
his disdain for the tabloid press, is directly opposite to that of the
previously mentioned former European Tour stars. They have moved from
the old world to the new in search of even greater success while Faldo
has recrossed the pond to try to recapture his own form.
He will play at Tucson, Phoenix, Pebble Beach, and Torrey Pines and
then probably take two weeks off during the Bob Hope and Los Angeles
events, depending on form, and return to Miami on March 2 to 5 for a
five-tournament build-up to the US Masters at Augusta on April 6 to 9.
Typical of the generous spirit in which Faldo will be received is the
full-page biography of him in the new US Tour book complete with his
smiling picture. In it we are informed that he is ''one of the game's
finest technicians'' and that his hobbies are ''fly-fishing and flying
helicopters''
Huston, who won the Doral Open in Miami last spring, shot a fine 133
over the two rounds but his thunder was stolen somewhat right at the end
of the day by the slightly built Janzen, who went out in 33 and got home
in a remarkable 30 with figures 4, 2, 4, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4, 3.
This would have been a tournament course record had it not been for
the fact that the players were permitted to pick up their balls and
clean and place them because of the wretched conditions.
Stadler, who looks more than ever a ''walrus'' as he has added a full
beard to his luxuriant moustache, had a fine 65, marred only by an
unfortunate lie in the savage rough just short of the ninth green.
He was only six yards from the flagstick but after hacking and
fluffing from the ''impossible'' lie, he dropped a shot while shaking
his head in frustration.
Leading scores (USA unless stated):
133 -- J Huston 67, 66.
135 -- L Janzen 72, 63.
136 -- C Stadler 71, 65.
137 -- B Estes 69, 68.

142 -- H Irwin 73, 69; K Perry 72, 70; M McCumber 70, 72; J Miller 71,
71; M Brooks 71, 71.
Other scores included:
144 -- L Roberts 71, 74.
145 -- C Pavin 74, 71; P Mickelson 72, 73.
146 -- G Norman (Australia) 74, 72.

PUBLIC relations man Andy Livingstone, tired of giving other people
stories, decided to write some himself and has come up with a series of
children's books based on Sidney Squirrel.
Andy, who works for Beattie Media, is also used to coming up with
publicity stunts for his clients but on this occasion it was a
do-it-yourself job so he donned a squirrel outfit and visited some of
his young readers from the Acorn Park Nursery at Tower Bookshop in
Glasgow.
Later he admitted: ''I've been involved in some off-beat publicity
stunts, but never anything quite as a-corny as this!''
Well you said it yourself Andy!

A Cheshire dairy farmer yesterday called on Agriculture Minister
William Waldegrave to rule out the use of the drug BST to boost milk
yields.
Mrs Barbara Smith told the Oxford Farming Conference: ''I cannot think
of a single good thing to say about BST. Many moons ago the big chiefs
of the drug companies decided BST was a line of research worth pursuing,
and it would be a money-spinner. Quite simply, they got it wrong.''
She said that leaked research data showed that frequent injections of
BST led to increased levels of mastitis, lameness, and breeding
problems. It had also become apparent that there was real concern that
human health could be affected by milk from cows treated with BST.
''The scientists say that BST is perfectly safe -- but where is the
proof,'' she asked. ''Apparently, the proof is lodged with the
Veterinary Products Committee, but under the Medicines Act it cannot be
disclosed to ordinary mortals such as ourselves.
''BST has been licensed for use in America, and the labelling of
BST-produced milk is the subject of legal wrangling. Why treat us as
morons, incapable of making a choice? Is it because without labelling
there can be no monitoring of the effects on human health?''
Mrs Smith insisted that the injection of any substance into a female,
simply to make her work harder, was not acceptable. ''I was appalled
when I heard that our Minister of Agriculture was in Brussels in
December advocating that BST should be licensed on scientific grounds.
The fact is that the welfare lobby does not favour the introduction of
BST, and neither do the farmers -- who work in daily contact with their
cows.''
European Agriculture Ministers, at their meeting last month, declined
to license the use of BST, but gave approval for trials to continue.
Mrs Smith claimed that Britain could still produce the best food in
the world, but argued that there were too many quality assurance schemes
and logos in use. One national symbol of quality would be much less
confusing, she said. ''Think about it -- Lurpak butter, Kellogs
cornflakes, Danish bacon. That is the way we should have gone long
ago.''
She questioned whether welfare standards in the rest of the world
matched those of Britain. ''Supermarkets should bear this in mind when
they impose standards on us, and then retail imported products which are
not up to those standards.
''Are non-British hens tested on a regular basis for Salmonella? No,
they are not, yet those eggs are on sale openly in the shops. Will the
same pig welfare regulations be enforced throughout the EU? No chance,
yet pig meat will still be imported and sold here.
''In short, we are facing a deluge of imported produce. We, as
farmers, will produce whatever is required, but we must have recognition
of that fact in the price we are paid, and in the housewife's mind when
she fills her shopping basket.''
Mr Guy McCracken, joint managing director of Marks and Spencer,
expressed a cautious approach to genetic engineering in animals and
plants. His firm would require very strong re-assurance on safety, and
would also support the identification of such products by labelling. In
particular, they would not want to move any faster than their customers
wanted them to.
Mr David Samworth, chairman of major food manufacturers Samworth
Brothers, warned farmers not to fall into the trap of believing that
everyone else in the food chain was profiting at their expense.
When potatoes were being sold at #150 a ton, and cauliflowers at 35p a
head, there were often criticisms when these items re-appeared on the
supermarket shelf as a cauliflower-filled jacket potato, at the
equivalent of nearly #6000 a ton.
''What is not appreciated are the costs and standards that separate
those two transactions,'' he said. His company had recently built a new
factory, at a cost of #8m, for the production of sandwiches. The
standard of hygiene there would not disgrace a teaching hospital.
''I can assure you that the extreme pressure on selling prices in my
industry has not only been reflected in the substantial decline in the
number of my competitors, but also in the decline of their
profitability,'' he claimed.
''Supermarkets, meanwhile, have been very successful in improving
their margins most years of my 25-year association with them. I just
wish I could say the same for my own businesses.''

STEVE Frew has given up his job as a postman in the hope of delivering
the message that he has the stamp of class in international gymnastics.
This week he has taken up a full-time place at Lilleshall, chasing World
and Olympic Games selection.
Frew, from Grangemouth, and a member of Britain's oldest gymnastic
club, at Alloa, is the first Scot accepted to train at the British
Amateur Gymnastics Association's residential school.
The Scottish AGA is footing part of the Lilleshall bill -- #25 per day
until the Atlanta Olympics. But they are prepared to jump through hoops,
chasing sponsors to fund the rest of the training programme of the man
perceived as Scotland's most outstanding prospect to date in the sport.
Instead of fitting in 11 hours a week, Frew will now pursue his
ambition five-and-a-half days weekly. His Chinese coach at Alloa,
Tan-Jai-En -- Tansheng, as he is known -- warned him: ''You will have to
deal with pain and fatigue, of brain and muscles, so intense that
sometimes you will feel you can't go on.''
It's a kind of fatigue which few can contemplate. But Frew, who has
been there, and knows that it can literally spell death, believes he can
cope.
''There are some difficult moves, particularly on the high bar, in
which, if things go wrong, you can easily kill yourself,'' says the
21-year-old. ''One lapse of concentration, and you are gone. It can take
years to work up to some moves, so when you are convinced you can do it,
you have to go for it, and be confident. There can be no half-hearted
effort.''
Even then, disaster can strike with terrifying suddenness. Nine years
ago Frew was rotating at speed round the high bar when his hand struck a
patch of chalk. It was like locking the brakes of a car at 80mph. His
body continued spinning, but his hand froze on the chalk. The bone
shattered, and his wrist simply wrapped around the bar.
''I don't mind admitting that when the plaster came off, and it was
time to get back on the bar, I found it very difficult, getting up for
the very first time,'' he says. ''It does take quite a lot of guts.
You're terrified it will happen again. I still have pain in the wrist to
this day.''
Because there can never be a slow-motion attempt at any new routine,
details have to be worked out in the head until the competitor is
confident enough to try it for real.
''Sometimes you spend just a couple of days, thinking it through,''
says Frew. ''But I spent three years on one move, before I'd the nerve
to try it.''
That routine, on the high bar, involved a Tkatchev somersault, named
after a Soviet gymnast, Aleksandr Tkatchev. The competitor straddles the
bar, going backwards, then catches it with both hands, spinning on
round. Now he does it as routine.
After his first day with the British squad Frew pronounced himself
''knackered.'' But Tansheng, married to a Scot, is convinced his former
protege has the ability to achieve his ambitions.
''Steve's training, until now, has been limited, yet he has done well
against full-timers,'' says the Chinese. ''Now he has trebled his
training hours, and has a lot of potential to improve. He could be the
first Scot at either Worlds or Olympics.''
The uninitiated look in awe at tiny pre-pubescent Chinese competitors,
at their calloused hands, but shortly before Frew left for the
Commonwealth Games in Victoria last year, he flayed the flesh from the
palm of one hand. Tansheng says it was as bad as any hand injury he had
ever seen, even as one of his country's leading internationalists,
before the Tiananmen uprising.
''If someone comes to our gym in Alloa, they see people training hard.
It is the same in any sport -- it's what you are used to.''
Tansheng has a party piece with which he is wont to demonstrate his
point and impress visitors. He picks out a gymnast, sitting with legs
crossed behind his back. Then he sits on the youngster. ''It's not as
brutal as it seems,'' he insists.
But Frew has left all this behind. Instead of the Alloa swimming pool,
where leaks were a blessing to the gymnnasts -- when the pool became
unusable, they built a floor on stilts, and foam training pits filled
the flawed ceramic of the deep end -- Steve now has the custom-built
facility which houses Britain's leading dozen competitors, at
Lilleshall.
I was tactless enough to ask where Steve got his ability from. His
parents, Alex and Helen Frew cannot tell, and admit it candidly. For
Steve is adopted, the child who stayed on, among a succession of
difficult foster children fortunate to find a home with the family in
Grangemouth.
''We are fiercely proud, and have always supported Steve willingly,
but we've tried to keep it low key,'' says his mum, Helen, a district
nursing sister. ''We've done it because we wanted to.''
She knew Steve had something special as young as two-and-a-half.
''Steve always had a lot of energy,'' she adds. ''He was always birling
about the place. Even at that age, he somersaulted around the house.
'I'm off to the toilet, Mum,' he'd say, and off he would go,
somersaulting. He had to be at something, all the time. He obviously had
some sporting talent -- but he couldn't kick a football for toffee. The
health visitor said he was hyperactive, but that was nonsense. He slept
like a like a log at night.
''We heard there was a gymnastic club, in Falkirk, run by the local
plumber, Jim Bennie. I told a wee white lie. Steve was just
six-and-a-half, but I said he was seven, which was what you had to be to
get in. He was so active I couldn't take any more.''
It was not always easy for the young coloured athlete. ''When I was a
kid I took a bit of stick,'' he says. ''. . . the image of prancing
about in tights. But when people saw the moves, realised how strong I
was, it soon stopped.''
Before long mum was fund-raising for the club, and dad was coaching
youngsters. The pair ran a permanent taxi service for their son until he
earned his licence at 17[1/2]. By then Steve had left Grangemouth for
the Alloa club, prompted by a growing rift between the Frews and
Scotland's other most talented young male gymnast, Derek Callahan.
Steve won his first title, the East of Scotland under-nine, when he
was seven. It was the first contest he had ever entered. He was in the
UK squad at 13, and thrice finished third in the TV Times junior gymnast
of the year event, then took his first British title at under-18. Since
then the procession of trophies has been endless. They now fill a series
of wall units in the Grangemouth dining room.
His fifth in the high bar, eighth on the pommel horse, and eleventh
overall at the Commonwealth Games was the best ever by a Scot, and his
total points, 52.00, was also the best ever in a full senior
international. Yet sponsor interest is non-existent.
''We'd love to be able to take that financial worry off him,'' says
his mum. ''But we really don't have any more to give him. We've seen so
many children fall away from gymnastics who might have made it. We hope
it does not happen to Steve.''
Frew says: ''I went to work at the Post Office because I could start
work early, then have the rest of the day to recover, before training at
night. It has worked out well.''
His employers at Royal Mail, Falkirk, have sent him off with the
promise of keeping his job open. But a few red-letter days on the mat
could mean no return to sender.

IN 1986, Kevin Greene toured Argentina with the reserve All Black
squad. In 1987, he was an All Black on their tour to France and Italy.
He went on to coach his beloved Waikato, who beat Otago 40-5 to win
the 1992 national championship, and the following year came his side's
historic win over Gavin Hastings' Lions, and a win over Auckland to
seize the Ranfurly Shield, New Zealand's prestigious provincial
challenge trophy. Auckland had been undefeated in their 64 previous
defences of the title.
My New Zealand rugby magazine tells me that some of his charges in
Waikato rate him as their biggest influence in life.
Now, he's at Glasgow Accies. Get back on your chairs. It seems to have
passed the attention of many people in Scotland, but one of the world's
top coaches is coaching one of Scotland's second-division clubs, as well
as helping out at Greenock Wanderers, Clydebank, and Glasgow Academy.
Why? He was midway through watching the Rangers-Celtic game -- his son
Andrew is now already a staunch Rangers supporter so dad backs Celtic --
and he was forthright. ''I suppose that it's a good chance for me,
partly to get away from the pressures that come with coaching a side
like Waikato,'' he said ''Back home the media attention is just like it
is for the football managers in this country. There is endless
speculation. It's good to get away from that.''
''But more than that, I want the challenge, and I want the challenge
of full-time rugby. There's so much to do.''
He helps Bill MacDonald at the Accies, who he rates highly, and word
has it that his impact has been subtle but immense. He's not a loud
''This is the way we do it back home'' type. Rather, for instance, the
changes he has brought about are in rugby's minutiae, including the way
backs pass. He demands they run upright, elbows in to the waist, when
they give and take the ball, and they are to pass high.
The reason? An upright player doesn't need to break his stride pattern
as he receives a ball, unlike one that has been taught to give and take
a ball at waist height and whose hands will interfere with his lifting
knees. And the eyes can remain on the opposition.
I like that stuff. I remember Bill Dickinson teaching me that on the
No.8 pickup, the right hand came down on the ball first to steady it,
and the left hand scooped it. The opposing scrum half couldn't see the
right hand so it gained time. I also remember reading a book by Ivan
Vodanovich, an old Wellington coach, who said that the most powerful
driving position for a forward was with his legs together, not apart.
Even in a scrum, and he was right.
Greene has that kind of knowledge, he is an expert coach of
threequarter play. He has a four-year contract here in Scotland, and so
much to do, and less experienced coaches than him have been put off by
the ''Glasgow malaise'' before. Players don't turn up on time at
training, sometimes they don't even turn up at all.
''It can be difficult at this time of year when you get only 10 or 12
of your firsts at training for a fortnight, and I think that's the
biggest challenge of all, to change the training and playing habits of
players and youngsters,'' he says ''But I am enjoying it, and the rugby
people are good.''
Perhaps the difference between the Scottish approach and that of
Greene was illustrated when he was told, by a member of another club in
Scotland, that they, too, were having trouble with numbers at training.
''No problem,'' said Greene ''Back home we just get another lot in and
leave the existing ones out.''
Yet he does have one overriding philosophy on the game. ''At Waikato
the emphasis was on enjoyment, and involvement. Everybody had an input
on the team, and the more we enjoyed it the more we won, the more we won
the more we enjoyed it. None of us was making a million dollars out of
rugby after all. Rugby is the kind of game that requires a commitment,
and I want players to have dedication and fun.''
In New Zealand, it transpires, the wives, girlfriends, and mothers of
the players are as welcome and as big a part of club and county rugby as
their men. The men travel to an away game, the women too. The men go to
the post-match dinner, the women too. Hear, hear.
His itinerary is arduous. He is out four nights at various clubs, does
two hours each afternoon at the school, goes to two games on a Saturday,
and attends mini-rugby on Sundays. Now that is commitment.
But so far nobody outside the clubs involved in the deal has been
making use of Greene's talents. He may well be very busy, but it would
be fair to assume that Greene would be available for others to consult
should they wish. ''First I'd like to make an impact on what I'm doing,
and then consider a higher level if anyone asked me,'' says Greene.
''But for now I see a big enough challenge.''
Greene is undoubtedly one of the best coaches in the world. We are a
country which, thanks to Jim Telfer, is willing to learn from everyone
whether it be gridiron or Rugby League. Perhaps it won't be long before
we start to learn from someone on our own doorstep. If we don't, we may
well be mugs.

LIKE marriage partners who have tried two separations and failed,
David Hay and Celtic seem destined to be together, however much they
have felt in the past that the bridge could not be recrossed.
The similarity does not end there, either, because the anger and then
the bitterness which Hay felt when he was sacked as manager in 1987
might well be recognised by anyone who has felt badly wronged in a more
personal relationship.
And the fact that time has done its usual impeccable job in healing
the wounds, easing the fury, and restoring the affection is maybe just
as recognisable.
Hay and Celtic have parted company twice. Once as a player, when he
was the initiator after seeing no signs of achieving a salary rise he
felt was his due, and then when he was dismissed, unjustifiably in his
view, as manager.
''The first time I wanted to go, but didn't want to go. The second
time I definitely didn't want to go, but had to.'' He can still recall
the hurt of that dismissal which, considering his record as manager
included a Scottish Cup success in 1985 as well as lifting the premier
division title in 1986, is not too surprising. That pain, shared by his
wife and family, turned to bitterness and led him to vow that not only
was he finished with Celtic but football altogether.
But the success he had with Lillestroem in Norway, where he steered
them to the league championsip, helped restore his own confidence and,
he feels, might have demonstrated to others that he still had what it
takes.
''I think that, as much as anything, helped me get things into
perspective and, gradually, my affection for Celtic returned. In fact,
if anything I realised how much the club means to me.
''I suppose, in a way, any anger I had felt was towards people here
rather than Celtic. Certainly, if I had maintained that bitterness, I
would not be back in football and definitely not back here.''
And, so, the one-time ''Quiet Assassin'' who left the club as a player
to join Chelsea, could be seen in the Parkhead stand again, the old
loyalties re-established and the desire to be part of the set-up
rekindled.
When he left his last club, Swindon Town, where he had been assistant
to John Gorman, Hay did wonder if there would be any room for him under
the new regime at Parkhead.
''I did phone Fergus McCann and ask about the PR job that had not been
filled. He did point out that they might be needing someone with
marketing experience, especially with the share issue planned, and, no
doubt, he had someone in mind anwyay.
''But then, a couple of months later, Tommy Burns came on to ask me to
come back.'' They had some lengthy discussions about the role he was to
play in the new set-up, but had some bother finding a suitable title.
''To be honest, they could have called me the head bottle washer and
it would have been no problem but we had to think of something to tell
you lot.''
''We lot'' eventually were apprised of the chief scout's role which
goes well beyond the job description normally associated with that
position.
Hay is consultant, father-figure, adviser, team watcher, player
spotter, foreign scout, and -- as he put it -- ''anything else they ask
me to be.''
He takes very little to do with the training or team selection . . .
''Tommy has Billy Stark to bounce ideas off for that'' . . . but will
offer his tuppenceworth if the manager seeks his views.
''I think what we have here is a real management team, involving Tommy
and Billy, myself, Willie McStay, Frank Connor, etc. I tell you this, it
is a far better team than I ever had when I was manager.''
None the less, does he not get a twinge of envy, a wee itch to get
into the hot seat again himself?
''You are as near to the managing side as you can be in this job but I
have no desire to be manager of Celtic. I have an input into trying to
help the club become successful again. We all have the same aim and I
honestly believe the club is on the way back.''
Hay reckons the importance of last week's announcement of the
impending share issue has been lost a little in the debate about the new
stadium.
''I don't think people -- especially Celtic people -- realise the
milestone that was reached when this club became a plc.
Many of us have been saying for years that, until that happened,
Celtic could not progress.
Now, it is here and the way ahead has to be better.''
His own part in the process could be vital, too.
Hay, who has a wide network of contacts in England and the Continent,
is the man whose initial advice will persuade Burns to assess new
players, one or two of whom will be arriving in the near future.
For instance, his travels recently have taken him to Holland, Sweden,
and Spain, and he is virtually a commuter to England.
He has such vast playing and management experience that he is able to
judge potential Celtic players with a measuring tape few others can
match.
He also is heavily involved with the youth development side headed by
Willie McStay.
''Celtic always have had a reputation for developing its own players
and we felt the youth policy needed slight restructuring. We have
started to set up new coaching stations in various places but the first
was in Ireland, in Sligo, which, by sheer coincidence, was where Brother
Walfrid was born.''
This much-travelled football aficionado who has spent time in America,
Norway, England, and Scotland during a long and successsful career,
gives the impression of a man who has landed at the terminus.
''I definitely would like to think that this is where I will stay,''
he said, ''and I would love to be part of the revival that is taking
place here.
''The reality of a new stadium is happening and I know the fans want
to see a team to match it. That will take time, but I believe the
foundations have been laid.''
He recalls how he, a couple of directors, Tommy Burns, and Billy Stark
sat and talked until 2am after the defeat by Raith Rovers in the
Coca-Cola Cup final in November.
''We were down, of course, but I think we all felt that was a
watershed for this club. Tommy will decide when, but we know we need
fresh faces.''
He and Connor, another man who has been hauled back by that Parkhead
umbilical cord, have put behind them their own fall-out which ended in
the sacking of Connor as Hay's assistant.
''We both have mellowed since then and I think we both know that maybe
that was the beginning of the turmoil that was to overwhelm this club.''
On the day we spoke, still in the midst of the festive holiday,
Parkhead was deserted. Only the management staff remained after players
had completed training.
Perhaps Hay didn't need to turn up at all, but he was in his office
taking calls and checking files.
''Maybe you didn't notice, but this office is the one that was the
manager's when I was in charge. It's a small world.''
It is when its epicentre is a few hundred yards from Parkhead Cross,
the place Hay would tell you he should never have left.
'To be honest, they could have called me the head bottle washer and it
would have been no problem'

<HEADLINE>Minister says CAP will survive Gatt agreement</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>22</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980484216</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE European Common Agricultural Policy is likely to survive the
pressures of Gatt trade agreements, Agriculture Minister William
Waldegrave said yesterday.
He was not a supporter of the scenario which suggested that Europe
would go down the ''New Zealand'' road, with a dismantling of support
for farming.
The scenario was not impossible, he admitted. ''Only 30 years ago, a
story like that delivered at a conference of the British coal or steel
industries would have sounded alarmist. But it happened. Small, on the
whole profitable industries -- based on a few companies -- remain.
Large, subsidised structures have gone. Why should farming be
different?''
For one thing, he suggested, no one should underestimate farming's
political clout. ''Although it is fashionable to grumble about farm
subsidies at present, that grumbling would be as nothing compared to the
uproar if farming were truly to be cast back into the dereliction which
genuinely did exist in the inter-war period, let alone at the end of the
19th century, with the uplands depopulated, small farms abandoned, and
imported foods sweeping away many familiar products.''
Mr Waldegrave did not regard it as plausible to imagine that the
social and political consequences of a true free trade in agriculture
would be acceptable in most of Continental Europe. It was Germany, the
richest country in Europe, and the biggest contributor to the costs of
the Community, which adamantly demanded a protectionist agri-monetary
system, and voted against cuts in set-aside in case farm gate prices
were to fall.
Austria and Finland, he pointed out, had had to cut farm support to
join the CAP.
''It is for this reason that British Ministers, talking unfettered
free trade for agriculture to their colleagues on the Continent, are so
often greeted with a friendly, but bemused incomprehension. Although
some of them think the present CAP not very well targetted, and a few of
them think it overall a bit too expensive, most of my European
colleagues think the CAP is rather successful. They know what it costs,
and they think it worth it.
''You will not persuade the Germans that it is wicked to support
Bavarian farmers because it costs money. They know that, believe they
can afford it, and are quite happy to go on doing it. They cannot see
why we have convinced ourselves that we are so poor we cannot tolerate
the support of our smaller sector at a lesser cost.''
Those who believed that the future held an inevitable progress into
total free trade were likely to be confounded, said the Minister.
Protectionist forces were stronger than they looked. Britain would not
make the walls of the CAP fall down by marching round the city
trumpeting ''free trade.''
He did accept, however, the need for lower support prices, for the
sake of both the consumer and the farmers. High support prices, combined
with output quotas, inevitably penalised the efficient producer, and led
to the sort of barriers to entry which were now being seen in the dairy
sector.
His preferred response was to accept that the CAP was indeed too
expensive, and required to move closer to the market if it was to foster
long-term competitiveness, and cater for Eastern Europe without becoming
ruinously expensive.
That implied many all-night Agriculture Council meetings, with British
Ministers defending British farming interests, losing some arguments,
and winning others. ''If I am right, that is the world in which we will
continue to live,'' he said.
''We will be more effective operators in that world if we recognise it
for what it is, and identify real and practical strategies for change
towards the sort of market-oriented CAP which we know to be in the
interests of our farmers, consumers, and taxpayers. That is what I
intend to do.''
Mr Waldegrave posed the question of whether he would recommend a son
of his to go into farming. ''I believe I would,'' he said. ''No industry
has more than provisional security now. Most manufacturing and service
companies cannot be sure whether their product will even exist in 20
years time, so fast is technological change.''

THE cost of support for the arable farming sector is becoming ever
more visible, with the Department of Agriculture for Scotland revealing
yesterday that the total bill under the Arable Aid Payment Scheme will
this year rise by #20m to #140m -- of which, a substantial part relates
to set-aside, where farmers are effectively paid for not growing crops.
Around 9000 individual claims are expected from Scottish farmers, who
this week have received application forms for the set-aside element of
the Double Aid PS, and three separate booklets giving detailed guidance
relating to the do's and don'ts of the regime.
Essentially, the scheme remains the same, but the Department are keen
to point out some important alterations. Firstly, the proposed reduction
by 3% to 12% for six-year rotational set-aside has now been formally
ratified in Brussels.
Similarly, non-rotational set-aside drops from 18% to 15%. However,
these figures have to be increased by 0.7% uncompensated set-aside on
non-LFA land because of a 3.5% overshoot last year.
Farmers are also warned that an overshoot this year will be even more
expensive, with the penalty rising from 20% of any extra acres to 50%
and, subsequently, to 100% in 1996. Basically, for 1995 there are three
main set-aside options.
Firstly, a six-year rotational set-aside, which is for land which has
not been set-aside during the previous five years. Flexible set-aside
may be left in one place or moved around, but is set at 15% -- as is
guaranteed set-aside, in which a farmer promises to keep land out of
production for five years while, in turn, payment rates are guaranteed
for the duration.
However, in addition, #450,000 has been earmarked for a new scheme,
under which farmers will be paid a premium rate for allowing public
access to set-aside land. An open field site, for example, would see the
farmer receive an extra #45 per hectare, on top of the cereal rate of
#237.92 on non-LFA land, or #218.61 in the LFAs.
Payments will also be paid at the rate of #90 per kilometre to the
farmer, should he need to provide a track or path to the field in
question. The upper limit is 15 hectares.
For oil seeds, there is now a maximum guaranteed area, which comes in
as a result of the Blair House agreement between the EU and the USA
placing a limit on the base area eligible for support. If this is
exceeded, then area payments will be proportionably reduced in the
offending countries.
Officials of the Department also stressed yesterday that scrutiny of
claims is to be stepped-up, as part of the anti-fraud drive initiated by
Brussels. The UK has an excellent record of compliance with the rules,
but it is also pointed out that there is little room for manoeuvre if
the rules are broken even accidentally.

RICHARD Dunwoody faces the prospect of a long, enforced break from the
saddle after having been found guilty of intentional interference on
G'Ime A Buzz at Uttoxeter yesterday.
The champion was upset when Luke Harvey attempted to pass him on the
inside on Wadswick Country in the Hoechst Panacur Novices' Hurdle.
Riders have an unwritten law that they do not go through on the inside,
and Dunwoody appeared determined to prevent Harvey's passage.
G'ime A Buzz moved across Wadswick Lad and slightly hampered him at a
bend, then Dunwoody appeared to deliberately steer his mount left-handed
to prevent his rival getting past three flights out.
The jockey's action was all the more remarkable as G'ime A Buzz
appeared to be weakening.
Because this is the rider's second offence of the season so far, he
now faces a trip to London and a chat with racing's governing body in
Portman Square.
This season was just a few weeks old when Dunwoody had earned a
six-day ban from the Newton Abbot officials, who thought Martin Pipe's
stable jockey was ''irresponsible'' in his handling of Kayfaat at the
Devon course.
But Dunwoody may not loose too much ground to his arch rival Adrian
Maguire in this season's race for the jockey's title, because the
Irishman now puts his feet up for three days thanks to suspension.
However, he left his followers with something to smile about yesterday.
Maguire had a near 47-1 four-timer at Towcester, with a treble for his
retained stable of David Nicholson on Fixturessecretary (5-2), Duhallow
Lodge (11-10), and Percy Smollett (evens), finishing off with the David
Gandolfo-trained Balanak (9-4).
On the all-weather Flat, Frankie Dettori was banned for three days
after having been found guilty of improper use of the whip on Battle
Colours in the claimer at Southwell.

DEEP Bramble is the tip in a tricky looking race for Sandown's
Mildmay-Cazalet Memorial Chase.
The eight-year-old was one of Ireland's top chasers before moving to
Paul Nicholls, and looked a Gold Cup contender when beating Flashing
Steel at Leopardstown last season.
He was a creditable eighth at Cheltenham, and although disappointing
first time out this year, showed renewed promise behind One Man in the
Hennessy Gold Cup.
He jumped well and, with today's marathon trip in his favour, can
return to the winners' enclosure.
Dubacilla looks weighted out of it and Flyer's Nap may not be in this
class, but Mr Boston's toughness should help him reach a place.
A lot of expectation rides on Callisoe Bay in the Tolworth Hurdle.
Jamie Osborne has described him as ''potentially the best horse I have
ridden.''
He will need to be good to give 12lbs to Royal Ascot winner Silver
Wedge, but he has age in his favour and can prove stronger. This is a
real test, though, and no odds-on should be taken.
When Spree Cross won at Uttoxeter last month, the stewards asked for
an explanation a s to his improved form. Trainer Di Haine said he had a
back problem -- which explains his slow start to the season -- but had
responded to treatment.
Spree Cross split Deep Sensation and Uncle Ernie at Ascot in April, so
a return to form should put him comfortably ahead of Around The Horn in
the Oriental Chase, despite a rise the weights.
Surrey Dancer looks the best bet on the card at Haydock.
The son of Shareef Dancer was an easy winner at Aintree's November
meeting and was just touched off by Weaver George when giving that rival
lumps of weight last time. He should take the Northern Hurdle.
Willsford, a Warwick specialist, has hit form again at the age of 12
and can score his fifth victory at the Midlands track in the Tote
National Chase.

IT'S interesting to learn that a business has actually been helped by
the recession. But that, apparently, is the case with Sofa Workshop,
according to Lorna Hickson, an area manager with the company which has
opened its first Scottish shop in Glasgow.
''Until six years ago we had only half a dozen stores,'' says Lorna.
''Now we have 25 branches, most of which have opened in the last two or
three years. That's because rents have gone down and incentives have
been offered on premises that we couldn't otherwise have afforded.''
In addition, says Lorna, furniture has now become a ''fashion
statement'' and she cites as an example the ''massive volume'' of home
interior magazines on our news stands.
In furniture, sofas are probably the biggest fashion statement of all.
''Most people don't want three-piece suites any more,'' Lorna
declares. ''And they're changing the covers and even the whole sofa much
more often than they did in the past.''
The founder and managing director of Sofa Workshop is Andrew Cousins
who opened his first store in Maidstone, Kent, almost 10 years ago. Mr
Cousins, aged 37, has a solid background in sofas, his father having
owned a chain of furniture stores -- Waring &amp; Gillow -- in the
South-east of England.
Lorna claims that with Sofa Workshop, Andrew Cousins ''changed the
furniture industry'' by offering customers a much more flexible service.
''It used to be,'' she says, ''that you chose your sofa style from a
set range and your sofa fabric from the book that went with that style
and that was about as flexible as it got. Then Andrew came along and
said 'pick your basic sofa style then, if you want, change its size and
the shape of the arms and back; decide on cushion fillings and choose
from hundreds of different fabrics -- or have it covered in your own'.''
If Sofa Workshop (a somewhat-deceptive name, incidentally, because
they make none of the furniture themselves) was the first to offer such
a flexible service -- its competitors are trying hard to catch up.
So even Sofa Workshop has to keep on its toes (although castors and
glides are also available). That means that, in addition to ''bending
over backwards to give customers the sofa they want'', says Carolyn
Carvil, a Scot and manager of the Glasgow store, you can expect
interest-free credit, generous reductions during sales, and -- two or
three times a year -- the chance to get as much as a 100% discount off
your sofa in the company's amazing ''choose a balloon event''.
Judging by the number of orders they had received from north of the
Border, Sofa Workshop reckoned there is a need for at least one Scottish
store.
Their branch at 39 Bothwell Street in the centre of Glasgow -- shops
are also planned for Edinburgh and Aberdeen -- has already attracted
customers from Shetland to the Borders.
All the basic sofa styles, incidentally, have names mostly of
well-known writers, painters, and other creative people.
''Andrew is very keen that we pronounce the names properly,'' Lorna
Hickson admits, ''and some of us are getting very nervous about some new
ones he's introducing.''
The range already includes a Burns, a Scott, and a Carlyle.
* Sofa Workshop, 39 Bothwell Street, Glasgow. Telephone 041-226 5450.

A BANK official and four others were jailed yesterday for their part
in an #11.7m cheque conspiracy involving British companies.
Barclays Bank loans adviser Elizabeth Lockwood repeatedly betrayed her
bosses after being ''corrupted'' and recruited by businessman Richard
Thorpe.
The inside information which she passed to the former nightclub owner
enabled scores of cheques to be forged, money laundered, and funds
channelled through a Swiss bank.
Thorpe, 39, of Shirley, Surrey, was described during his trial last
month as the ''link'' with other plotters not before the court.
The gang actually got away with nearly #2.4m but the court heard that,
if all the bogus cheques printed had been cleared, they would have
netted #11.7m.
Lockwood, 36, of Bexley, Kent, who was found guilty with Thorpe of
four counts of conspiracy to defraud, was jailed for 15 months and
ordered to pay #700 compensation at Snaresbrook Crown Court.
Thorpe was jailed for two-and-a-half years and ordered to pay #95,000,
with a further two years if he defaults in payment.
Also jailed was Southampton solicitor Alexander Nicholls, who was
found guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud.
The 50-year-old lawyer, of Eastleigh, Hampshire, received an 18-month
sentence.
A second solicitor, Leslie Burke, 51, of Denham, Buckinghamshire, who
was convicted of attempting to obtain #235,000 by deception, was sent to
prison for a year.
A fifth defendant, businessman Andrew Boyd, 55, of Dagenham, Essex,
who was also convicted of conspiracy to defraud, was jailed for eight
months and ordered to pay #5000 compensation for his ''very active''
money-laundering role.

A WOMAN lost her claim for unfair dismissal yesterday when an
industrial tribunal ruled that her case could proceed no further.
The tribunal at Inverness heard that baker's assistant, Mrs Catherine
McAnaney, had a husband who had to retire early due to ill health.
She had been receiving #63 for a 20-hour week working for Mr Donald
Patience and his wife at Allness, Easter Ross.
However, Mrs McAnaney, 38, of Braeface, Allness, said her wages were
put through the books as less than this so she would be eligible to
claim a social security ''carer's benefit''.
Mr Alastair Cockburn, solicitor for Mr Patience, immediately
interjected claiming his client had no case to answer.
He said: ''If a contract of employment is tainted with illegality,
then the tribunal has no jurisdiction.''
The three-strong tribunal panel, chaired by lawyer Joan Aitken, was
surprised at the development and adjourned for a few minutes to consider
Mr Cockburn's motion.
The chairwoman then said: ''The lady's evidence is that she was
getting more in her pay packet than was being shown on her employer's
records so she could get a carer's stamp. That is an avoidance.
''The case can go no further. I will given a written decision later.''
Mr Cockburn announced that, despite what Mrs McAnaney said, Mr
Patience's position was that his records were accurate.
Afterwards, Mr Phil Durham, of the Citizens Advice Bureau, who was
representing Mrs McAnaney, said: ''Mr Patience has escaped on a
technical point.''
Earlier, the tribunal heard of difficulties between Mr and Mrs
Patience and Mrs McAnaney which ended with the worker resigning and
claiming unfair constructive dismissal.
A social security official at Inverness said ''carers benefit''
amounted to #34.50 per week provided the person was not earning more
than #50 per week.

authorised overdraft rates of 9.12%.
There are no administrative charges for these overdrafts.
The current account offers branch, telephone and postal services, with
calls charged at local rates and pre-paid envelopes supplied for postal
transactions.
Account holders must have a regular inflow of at least #300 per month
into the account. New accounts can be opened by telephoning 0500 646464.
ANYONE planning to review their personal finances in the new year can

* I am planning to go on a skiing holiday to the French Alps and am
looking for a suitable travel insurance. But there seems to be so many
on the market that I am having trouble choosing one. They all seem to
have different conditions and prices that I am getting rather bogged
down. Can you indicate the essentials I should be looking for in such a
policy?
* Comparing travel policies is indeed difficult given the wide
variations in cover and claim limits applying. Generally, buying a
stand-alone policy is better value than merely signing up for what the
package tour operator or travel agent offers but it does require more
work in selecting the right policy.
The most important thing is having adequate medical cover as there is
a one-in-50 chance of having to return home from a skiing holiday early
because of injury and repatriation in the case of serious injury can
cost some #6000. Taking an E111 form entitles you to treatment in
another European Union country but this will still leave a proportion of
the cost to come from your own pocket and repatriation would not be paid
for.
So it is really essential that the medical and repatriation cover is
adequate. Experienced skiers have to note that some policies do not
provide cover for injury sustained in off-piste skiing and others will
only do so if you are accompanied by an guide.
You may also want to check the extent of personal accident cover,
particularly in relation to the loss of a limb or eye. The payout in the
event of accidental death should be less important because you should
have adequate death cover anyway.
All policies provide adequate cancellation and baggage cover, though
you have to watch the value limit on skis which is often not high
enough, particularly for hired skis. Another necessity is for the policy
to pay out if there is no snow at your resort, which has often been the
case this season. If you go abroad on holiday more than twice each year
you will probably find annual policies are better value. Some include
ski cover at no extra cost.
* You mentioned in your questions and answer column some weeks ago
that where a person had more than one employment, ie a full-time and a
part-time job, that there was a maximum amount of national insurance
contributions to be paid in any tax year. I am in this situation and it
would be helpful to know how this maximum amount is calculated and the
procedure which is necessary to obtain a refund.
* Employees are liable to pay primary Class I national insurance
contributions in respect of each job they have but as you say there is a
prescribed annual maximum contribution. This maximum is based on 53
weeks' contributions and the amounts for the current year 1994-95 are
#2037.32 for employments not contracted out, #1681.69 contracted out and
#877.41 in respect of reduced rate contributions.
Where an employee has both contracted out and non-contracted out
employments, the contributions in respect of the contracted out job are
converted to the non-contracted out level to see whether the annual
maximum has been exceeded.
If at the end of the tax year you have exceeded the maximum a refund
may be made by submitting form CF28F to the DSS together with evidence
of the excess payments, eg P60 supplied by our employers.
As previously mentioned you can avoid the necessity of a refund by
applying to defer payment of some of your contributions. Details and the
application form are to be found in the DSS leaflet number CA01
(previously NP28).
* I understand that the rules for taxing interest from National
Savings investment accounts are to change. Can you please comment on how
this will affect existing and new accounts.
* Tax on National Savings Bank interest is normally charged on the
interest received in the previous tax year with special rules for the
first three years and last two tax years.
The change you mention is that this previous year basis of assessment
will cease to apply so that tax will always be charged on the interest
received in the current tax year.
This change will take place in the tax year 1996-97 for accounts and
bonds on which interest was first received before April 6, 1994. For
accounts and bonds on which interest is first received on or after that
date the new rules apply straight away.
* I have a number of shares in a few of the privatised companies but
they are all rather small and I wonder if I am right to hold on to them
rather than have a larger investment in a unit trust or investment
trust. It seems to cost quite a lot to sell them so I am not sure what
to do. Can you advise me?
* Quite a lot of people must be in your position, having too many eggs
in one basket when one of the primary rules of investment is to spread
your risks. Utilities are relatively low risk but they are still
equities which can and do fluctuate considerably in value.
An investment in a unit trust or investment trust would spread your
investment over a large number of individual shares so reducing
volatility. Selling small holdings of shares is indeed expensive as
brokers have a minimum dealing charge.
However, there is an alternative in share exchange schemes whereby the
manager of the unit trust or investment trust will either take your
shares in exchange for units or shares in his own fund or sell them
cheaply.
The conditions vary, with some doing it for free while others have a
small fee, usually much lower than stockbrokers would charge. The
leading unit trust groups all offer the service and a number of
investment trust groups do.
If other members of your family want to do the same as you the
holdings can be aggregated for dealing purposes, reducing any cost there
may be. Investment trusts often pool holdings which come to them in
order to have a larger number of shares to sell once a month which means
your shares may be sold several weeks after you send them in, a
disadvantage in falling markets.
* What's happened to dear old Premium Bonds now that the National
Lottery is up and running? Are they still available and how do the odds
between them and the lottery compare? I have a few old bonds but I have
never won anything. How do I find out if I missed a prize in the past
and is there a time limit?
* If anything the National Lottery has stimulated interest in Premium
Bonds, which have been selling like hot cakes since National Savings,
which runs them, introduced a #1m jackpot last in April. Sales soared in
1994, reaching #1700m in the 11 months to November and the total
outstanding has now reached 4500 million.
However, the chances of winning the jackpot are vanishingly small at
one in 4500 million per monthly draw for each bond or one in 375 million
per year. In comparison the odds on the lottery jackpot, which is
larger, are one in 14 million which is considerably better, though at
these scales the difference has little meaning.
The odds on winning any prize with a premium bond is one in 15,000,
with the most likely prize being the #50 minimum. The lottery minimum is
#10 and one in 57 punters win this each week. However, the two should
really not be compared. Once you have bought your bonds (minimum
purchase is #100 worth) you are in there with a chance each month and
you can get your stake or capital back at any time. With the lottery you
pay your pound each week and take your chance though you have the
consolation that the money, or most of it, goes to good causes.
As regards your old bonds and possible missed prizes, this usually
only arises if you have not informed the Premium Bond centre in
Blackpool of a change in address as all prizewinners are notified of a
win. If you want to check you should ask at a main post office to see
the London Gazette supplement with the unclaimed winning numbers. If you
have a win you should ask for the special change of address form and
send it off, with a note claiming your prize, though even this is
unnecessary because your name will automatically be checked to see if
you are entitled to an unclaimed prize. There is no time limit on making
a claim.
* I have #500 a month to save. For the past two years I have had a
monthly savings Personal Equity Plan with Scottish Investment Trust. I
am a higher rate taxpayer and appreciate the simplicity of the PEP
scheme, but I do not want to continue to have all my savings in one
scheme.
I am confused about the regulations relating to holding more than one
PEP. I understand that I can have only one PEP manager in any one
financial year. Does this mean that if in 1995-96 I wish to save with --
for example -- the Alliance Trust PEP savings scheme, I will have to
transfer my previous years' PEP savings to the Alliance Trust as PEP
manager, or can I retain my previous PEP with Scottish Investment
Savings as continuing manager, while in 1995-96 starting a new
investment trust savings scheme with a new manager?
* There is no barrier to you retaining your existing PEPs with
Scottish Investment Trust and starting a 1995-96 scheme with a new
manager. Indeed on the principle of not putting all your eggs in the one
basket it is an attractive initiative to contemplate seriously.
In each financial year ending on March 31 you are entitled to a
general PEP (maximum #6000) and a single company PEP (maximum #3000).
Even if you subscribe less than the maximum you can only have one of
each in any year. The following year you have a fresh entitlement, and
can choose any plan manager(s) you want regardless of your previous
selection. Subsequently you can consolidate all your PEPs under the one
umbrella, but it is at your discretion whether you do so.
The Alliance Trust operates both general and single company PEPs. The
maximum you can invest in Alliance Trust (or Second Alliance Trust) is
#1500 annually because both are non-qualifying trusts. The balance up to
#6000 can be made up from qualifying investment trusts or blue chips,
which must be selected by the investor himself from the Alliance Trust
lists.
This allows you to spread the risk even wider, but some investors find
the self-selection requirement a handicap. The transaction costs and
management charges are among the lowest in the industry.
* I am self-employed and this year have substantial profits assessable
to tax. I have been paying a smaller regular pension contribution for a
number of years and as funds are available I have been considering
making a large payment to the plan to reduce my tax bill. I think I am
right in saying that I can make payment in respect of previous years'
income in addition to the amount for this year.
Can you confirm this and say when the tax relief for these payments
will be allowed? I would prefer to have the relief this year when I am
liable to tax at the higher rate rather in earlier years when I was
paying standard rate tax.
* Tax relief is given for pension contributions paid in each tax year
and is deducted from taxable earnings in the year in which the premium
is paid. Alternatively, you can elect for the premium to be treated as
paid in the immediately preceding tax year so you could pay a premium
qualifying for relief in 1994-95 at anytime up to April 5, 1996.
There is an annual limit on the amount of premiums which qualify for
relief calculated by reference to a percentage of taxable earnings based
on age. We confirm that if your premiums in any tax year do not exceed
this limit any excess is carried forward as unused relief for the next
six years enabling a higher premium to be paid in these years.
* My wife has owned and occupied a house for some years prior to our
marriage. We wish to sell the house with the net proceeds going to her
daughter. The capital gain on the sale may be #30,000. I presume that we
will have no capital gains tax to pay but that the transfer of capital
will attract taxation if executed in one transaction. How long will it
take to transfer #30,000 without incurring taxation?
* The fact that the two transactions are linked has no bearing for tax
purposes. If your wife sells the house within 36 hours of it ceasing to
be her main residence, the gain arising will be exempt from capital
gains tax. Otherwise there may be some capital gain giving rise to a tax
liability and the calculation of this will depend on how long she
occupied the house as her principal private residence.
The gift of the proceeds to her daughter will not attract inheritance
tax. In the event she dies within seven years of making the gift, it
will be treated as a chargeable transfer which will use up part of her
nil rate band of inheritance tax.

AFTER years of scoffing at decaffeinated drinks men are suddenly
knocking back the herbals. According to Andrew Chevallier, medical
herbalist: ''Many of my male patients, especially those looking to
improve their diets and soothe minor ailments, are benefiting from
converting to herbal teas.''
Fennel, he advises, can sharpen a sluggish appetite. Peppermint, a
refreshing digestif, makes an ideal after-dinner mint, and camomile is a
gentle relaxant. Now widely available in restaurants and cafes, herbal
teas still have their greatest market in Italy and France where they
account for 45% of the hot drinks market.

THERE have been a few false storms in the land of the rising sun but
this just might be the year in which we see a real recovery in the
Japanese stock market. It just might be the year when this Asian power
house regains its reputation as the land of the rising share price.
The Tokyo market, rocked by scandals and hit by recession, is still
bumping along at about half its previous peak as measured by the Nikkei
Index in spite of some recovery last year. You would have to be a super
optimist, however, to expect the index to get back to its previous peak
in anything like the immediately foreseeable future.
Not everyone feels totally confident about Japan, but the institutions
must be feeling relatively positive because some specialist investment
trusts such as Fleming Japan and HTR Japanese smaller companies are
trading at modest premiums.
At Fleming Japan, which has done well over the years, Stephen Mitchell
comments: ''We feel positive. We are expecting a slow but steady bull
market in Japanese equities. The economy is some way behind the US and
Europe in the recovery but recovery did start in the second half of last
year.
''Corporate profits are rising after three years of falls and, coming
from a very low base, could rise 30% this year. They might even rise
50%.
''The other positive thing for Japan is that interest rates are going
to stay very low which is good for the valuation of the market. With
their high trade surplus they are now importing a lot of goods and this
is putting pressure on prices. Prices in the shops are falling by 6%, so
interest rates will stay low and the market should make progress.
''Real estate and banking still have problems which is why we do not
expect a major bull market but manufacturing, retailing and technology
companies are having a good recovery.
''Japanese investors are feeling their way cautiously after a pretty
difficult period. But they are modest net buyers and the institutions
are sitting on a lot of cash.''
As buyers are tempted back by the sight of company profits recovering,
he expects the Nikkei index to reach 23,000 by the end of this year.
At Foreign &amp; Colonial, Jeremy Tigue says: ''We are optimistic about
the Japanese market. It is looking pretty attractive. Although there has
been some recovery it is so far down from its peak that there is scope
for more. Japan is behind the US and Europe in the economic cycle.''
The Foreign &amp; Colonial Pacific Investment Trust, which specialises in
the Far East, including Japan, now has some 35% of its assets in Japan.
That compares with 50% five years ago and around 20% at one point last
year. This trust is expecting growth of 15% to 20% in Japanese shares
this year.
Schroders, whose Tokyo Trust is one of the best-known unit trusts
specialising in Japan, also feels the outlook for this year is good.
Dennis Clough of the Tokyo Trust says: ''We are looking for profits in
1995 to rise by just over 50% on the back of the first real year of
recovery. Japan started to recover in the second half of last year. We
are looking for 2.5% economic growth this year.''
Mr Clough admits that he is more optimistic than most of the domestic
Japanese investors who have not so far made the sort of real moves into
the market which might have been expected at this stage of the economic
recovery. He points out, however, that caution among local investors is
understandable as ''they have had a terrible time''.
Previous Japanese setbacks lasted around two years and saw profits
down by 20%. But the latest recession lasted four years and cut profits
by 70%. That is the context in which he's looking for profit recovery of
50% this year. That would still leave profits at a comparatively
depressed level so there could be another couple of years before a full
recovery.
''This is the beginning of a fairly long recovery after the
recession,'' he predicts.
The government has done quite a lot to stimulate demand, including
income tax cuts of some #40bn over the three years to end-1996. Despite
the strength of the yen, Japan has benefitted from strong demand in Asia
-- and for capital goods in particular this looks likely to continue in
the current year along with weakening of the yen.
Mr Clough says that in local currency terms he is expecting a rise of
some 25% in the share market this year. That would be the equivalent of
a rise to around 25,000 on the Nikkei Index.
A somewhat more cautious view is taken by Guinness Flight, they are
predicting growth of 13% or more in earnings per share of Japanese
companies with the figure partly dependent on the extent of depreciation
of the yen. Currency changes have ''enormous gearing on exports''.
Their overall prediction is that the Nikkei Index could gain 12% to
around 21,500. After that level is achieved however, they expect ''a
period of consolidation'', while the price-earnings multiples on
Japanese companies ''adjust to more realistic levels''.
Save &amp; Prosper, the unit trust arm of the Fleming's Group, gave units
investors one of their first opportunities to buy into Japan when it
launched its Japan Growth fund in April 1970.
Some eyebrows were raised at the time at the idea of offering unit
holders such a ''risky'' investment. But #100 put into the trust at
launch would now be worth roughly #3875 with income re-invested. And at
its peak in August last year the figure would have been #4318.
Yen appreciation made up for UK investors against some of the falls in
the Nikkei Index. With the yen now expected to fall against both the
dollar and the pound Save &amp; Prosper have taken out currency hedges for
the trust.

HAS the concept of mutuality outlived its usefulness, or is it still
worth defending? This is the question which is being raised by the
proposed merger of the Halifax and Leeds building societies to form a
new public company, Halifax plc.
Until the Abbey National went public in July 1989, all building
societies were mutuals and belonged to their members, the people who
saved with them and borrowed from them. The Halifax always claimed that
the financial constraints of mutuality and the regulatory constraints of
the Building Societies' Commission would not hinder its development.
Now the Halifax has had a change of heart, but it is not going
unchallenged. Serge Lourie, a Liberal Democrat councillor from Richmond
in Surrey, and an accountant with a background in housing association
management, has formed the Halifax Action Group to spearhead opposition
to the deal.
And Peter Judge, a Labour councillor on Calderdale Borough Council
which covers the Halifax area, intends standing for the Halifax board in
May as an anti-conversion candidate.
Sergie Lourie says that it is still difficult for Halifax and Leeds
members to make up their minds about the merger and conversion because
of the lack of information. The Halifax and Leeds were forced into an
early announcement at the end of November by a newspaper leak, since
when members have received very little information from either society
beyond what they have read in the papers.
The conversion to plc could take until the spring of 1997 which,
according to Sergie Lourie, is a long time for members to be effectively
locked into their investment by the promise of an eventual windfall.
''But I am particularly concerned by the quality of advice which members
will get from the board of the Halifax.
''I think it will be hard for the board to remain independent when the
evidence suggests that they will be the main people to benefit from
conversion to plc through higher salaries and share options.''
Sergie Lourie says: ''Having failed to persuade the Office of Fair
Trading to refer the merger to the Monopolies Commission we are now
concentrating our efforts on persuading the Building Societies'
Commission that the advice offered by the two societies is fair so there
can be a genuinely informed debate about the reasons for abandoning
mutuality.''
He is also concerned that if the conversion to plc does go through
that members get a fair price. ''There are fundamental questions to be
asked about how you value a building society. Do you take the asset
value or do you look at the profit stream?''
Peter Judge is even more concerned that the principles of mutuality
should be defended. ''At the moment the Halifax belongs to its members,
converting it to a plc is little short of privatisation.
''People are fed up with what they have seen in other privatisations
-- directors who award themselves huge pay increases and lucrative share
options while cutting jobs and restricting pay rises for everyone
else.''
He is hoping that his decision to stand for election to the Halifax
board in May will provide a focus for people who want to see the Halifax
remain a mutual. However, this is likely to be too late to effect the
course of the merger. Members of the Halifax and Leeds are expected to
vote on this issue some time in the spring.
As Lloyds Bank and the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester discovered, the courts
have wide powers to determine just who can benefit and by how much when
a building society is taken over or converts to a plc.
To qualify as a Halifax or Leeds member you must have had an account
or mortgage on November 25, 1994. You must then keep a total of #100 or
more in your account or accounts between January 31, 1995, and the date
of the vote on the merger.
And if you want to be certain to qualify for any handouts on
conversion, the advice is to keep at least 100 invested. Some accounts
don't qualify. In the case of the Halifax these are the Deposit, Maxim,
Cardcash and Asset Reserve accounts.
In the case of the Leeds the AVC Treasurers, Liquid Gold Deposit,
Overseas, Southdown Horizon, Southdown Share, Southdown GRE and Time
Deposit accounts. You also qualify as a borrower if you have at least
#100 outstanding on your loan on January 31, 1995.
You can contact the Halifax Action Group at 59 Burlington Avenue,
Richmond, Surrey TW9 4DG, and Peter Judge, who is still looking for
nominations, on 0484 717579.

HAPPY NEW YEAR? Well, it doesn't look too good so far. Petrol, beer,
wine, spirits and cigarettes are already up in price -- Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke's revenge for losing the fight to double VAT on household
fuel bills.
Look carefully, too, among the holiday brochures and seed catalogues
that come thumping through your letterbox at this time of the year.
There's sure to be a letter from your building society telling you of
higher mortgage repayments following the pre-Christmas hike in bank base
rates.
That won't be the only price increase for homeowners this year.
Tax relief on mortgages reduces to 15% in April, adding around $10 a
month to monthly repayments.
Further ahead, cutbacks in State benefits for homeowners who lose
their jobs could lead to unemployment insurance becoming compulsory for
people buying their first home or moving on -- and that could add #20 a
month to a typical new mortgage.
Another change which could hit unemployed householders hard is the
proposal to base State benefits for mortgages on a ''standard'' rate
rather than the actual interest rate being charged on the loan.
If the standard rate is set below the actual interest charged --
details will be thrashed out later this month -- then State benefit will
no longer cover interest repayments. At present eligible homebuyers get
all mortgage interest paid after the first 16 weeks of their claim on
loans of up to #125,000, due to be cut to #100,000 from April.
The New Year has also brought bad news for homebuyers saving through
endowment policies. The first bonus declarations from life insurance
companies show that payouts this year could be well down on the 1994
figures.
Scottish Life has the cut the payout on a #30-a-month 25-year
endowment policy by 5.6%, reducing the maturity value from #63,252 to
#59,687 although that still represents an average yearly yield of 13%.
At GA Life the payout has been reduced by 2.3%, cutting the maturity
value from #65,604 to #64,070.
The cuts follow several years of low inflation and poor investment
returns.
It's not all doom and gloom for householders, though. New Year sales
fever has spread to the house insurance market and an escalating price
war could cut household premiums by as much as 30% over the coming
months.
The Halifax fired the first shot in the home insurance price war just
before Christmas. It announced cuts in premiums averaging 20% for
buildings cover, discounts for older policyholders and a no-claims
discount scheme for policies renewed during 1996.
Cornhill quickly responded by offering no-claims discounts of up to
20% on home contents cover and discounts on both contents and property
cover for those over 50.
Behind the cuts is growing competition from the ''direct'' insurers
like the Royal Bank of Scotland's Direct Line and Churchill. Both have
made substantial inroads into the car insurance market and are now
pushing for the same success in household insurance.
In the past most property and contents cover was sold by building
societies alongside new mortgages. More than half of those who take out
combined policies still use this route, according to a survey by NOP
last year.
But NOP also suggested that the number of homeowners prepared to
switch insurance companies -- currently around one in ten -- is on the
increase.
What's worrying for banks and building societies who have enjoyed
healthy profits from selling this type of cover over the years, is that
a fifth of the ''switchers'' are taking advantage of the lower rates on
offer from the direct insurers.
Over the past year insurers have benefitted from the much higher
premiums set in previous years and lower subsidence claims from
householders. And sophisticated computer analysis allows companies to
set premiums much more accurately -- almost on a household-to-household
basis by comparing postcodes and claims.
Insurers have been raking in profits of around 20% on their household
policies, much more than on other types of insurance. Some believe that
profit margin could be halved and still provide juicy returns for
companies.
Fierce competition is also expected from the direct insurers for a
slice of the household investment budget -- and existing direct-sell
companies could themselves be fighting off challenges from outsiders who
hope to emulate their success.
The end of February could see the start of Richard Branson's move into
the financial services industry with his Virgin Direct venture, for
example.
Virgin has teamed up with Norwich Union to sell commission-free
personal equity plans initially, to be followed by a range of personal
pensions and insurance plans in September, through a telephone-based
sales service. The new venture promises discounts of up to 40% on the
cost of existing products.
The plans come hard on the heels of new requirements that insurance
companies must disclose the level of sales commission and other expenses
charged on the policies they sell -- dubbed ''hard disclosure''.
This new regime gives insurance buyers the chance to compare the real
costs associated with the products they're being offered. It's likely to
force inefficient and uncompetitive companies out of business, leaving
the way clear for a fresh approach from innovative firms.
The ''hard dislosure'' rules, which came into effect on January 1,
have already led to Standard Life, Scottish Widows and other insurers
boosting the early surrender and transfer values of life insurance and
pension products as competition for business intensifies.

petrol, beer, wine, spirits and cigarettes were his revenge for losing
the fight to double VAT on household fuel bills

January 3.
The residents of Eaglesham have been campaigning for a bypass for
almost 30 years and on more than one occasion during that period they
have been told, ''It's on, it's happening'' -- 30 years later it is no
nearer.
Instead of that much-needed bypass, which no-one disputes is long
overdue, Strathclyde region decided to spend three times the amount of
money required for the bypass on an extension to the M77, the benefit of
which will be that vehicles will save seven minutes on the journey time
between Ayrshire and central Glasgow.
David Spaven, writer on transport and the environment, in the document
Instead of the Ayr Road Route, argued the case for allocating funds
earmarked for the M77 to upgrade rail and public transport and build the
Eaglesham bypass.
His central theme was that building more roads was not a long-term
answer to the problems caused by road traffic because traffic volume
simply expands to fill the road space available.
In a response the director of roads for Strathclyde presented the case
for the M77 extension and David Spaven's argument. Under the heading
Environmental Benefits, traffic relief to existing roads was cited as
one of the benefits of the M77 extension.
A long-awaited report from the Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk
Roads Assessment has now come to the same conclusion as David Spaven and
other forward-thinking people that building new roads did indeed induce
extra traffic.
Given that new findings have forced this Government to admit that its
previous thinking on the future for road trasnport was seriously flawed,
I would suggest we should now question whether Mr Carruthers and his
team have any credibility left.
What we need now is a new unit which will not be swayed by powerful
lobbies with vested interests but which will have vision and the courage
to implement new dynamic policies more in tune with today's world.

I had the dubious privilege of travelling by car to London via the
M74, M6, and M40. The traffic was horrific and the journey took some
seven hours with one and a half hours to get through Birmingham and the
M40 going North was approximately 70% full from London to junction with
M42 the result of which, I later found, caused my nephew to take 10
hours to reach Glasgow.
What this experience highlights is that it is a waste of public money
building new roads to cope with the ever-increasing traffic load,
especially those large lorries which must be responsible for most of all
the wear and tear to the fabric of the road surface.
I find it amazing that all we hear about is the cutbacks of rail
routes which, under privatisation, must stand on their own financial
feet -- but what of potential traffic?
I, for one, would be delighted to take my car to a convenient car/rail
ferry rather than have the stress of road journeys. Of course it would
have to be financially and conveniently attractive but the untapped
potential business for this type of transport must be considerable,
especially if it were linked to the main cities in the UK or even via
the Channel Tunnel to the rest of Europe.

December 30.
Credibility, intelligence, and respect disappear from the story
concocted by the Nationalists on Motherwell District Council which made
a tasty little yarn for the inclusion in the pre-Christmas scribbles of
diarist Tom Shields (December 23).
The persons who attended a major European exhibition in Motherwell's
twin town of Schweinfurt promoted products produced and exported from
our district, and explored with business and council colleagues the
opportunities of developing stronger and productive economic linkages
between our areas.
Two SNP councillors acquired a ''report'' from the desk of a council
officer -- the officer is adamant that this was a draft preliminary
report on the exhibition based upon the planned and prearranged
programme and upon information received from the organisers regarding
numbers of contributors and anticipated attendance -- and they proceeded
to place their own warped and typically ludicrous interpretation on the
draft and touted it around as evidence of something underhand and
corrupt.
Perhaps it is too taxing on their thinking processes to ask or surmise
what possible motive there might be for predating the said ''report''
and how this could be advantageous to anyone.
This might be suitable for Tom Shields' diary, but it certainly should
have no place in a Christmas well wishing to constituents. Wouldn't it
be a refreshing change if these two particular exponents of Scottish
Nationalism could keep politics out of Christmas?

THE JOHN Lewis Partnership, operators of department stores and
Waitrose supermarkets, had a good Christmas which helped to make up for
sluggish trading earlier in December. Sales in the week to December 24
were 26.8% higher than in the comparable period in 1993.
The ''lateness'' of Christmas was confirmed in a last minute rush to
the check-outs. The company said that a ''very considerable volume of
business'' was transacted on the last three days, with customers
continuing to purchase right up until the end.
In the two weeks to December 31 the group had a double figure sales
increase. Perhaps not surprisingly sales of perfume, stationery, gifts
and toys were strong. However there was also considerable demand for
hard furnishing, electrical appliances, radios and televisions.
Colder winter weather boosted sales of bedlinen, gloves, coats, hats
and jackets. The week to December 31 marked the start of its sale but
the group said it was too early to interpret the results.
Its food retailing business Waitrose continued to trade well in its
upmarket niche. It reported a 29.8% sales increase in the week to
December 24. ''Sales soared throughout the week and it quickly became
obvious that we were heading for record takings'' said the company.

IF Santa was so remiss as to omit to bring you a decent bootleg copy
of Reservoir Dogs this Christmas, don't break your heart: after you've
blown the whiskery old fraud away with two shots from your trusty Magnum
.357 (''Where'd you get the reindeer?'' -- ''Santa's dead, baby. Santa's
dead.'' you can just run out and rent the next best thing, which is Tony
Scott's Tarantino-scripted True Romance (rental, cert. 18), now all
tricked out with a BBFC certificate so that you can watch it at home
without dreading the four o'clock knock of the Copyright Police.
Fans of Tarantino's other movies will find nothing terribly new in the
plot or characterisation -- boy meets prostitute, boy kills prostitute's
pimp, boy and girl take it on the lam with the law and the bad guys in
hot pursuit. To be fair to old Quent, you can't accuse him of copying
himself -- it's just that he's seen The Killing, The Getaway, Badlands,
Gun Crazy, and A Bout De Souffle more times than is good for anyone, and
you wonder if he's ever going to make a film or write a script of his
own. Still, as long as the results are as good as Reservoir Dogs or Pulp
Fiction, who cares? Not me, anyway.
In fact, the effect of True Romance is so very Tarantino that it makes
you wonder whether the lovable maestro of mayhem's real talent doesn't
lie more behind the word processor than behind the camera. Only a
visibly bigger budget and a certain glossy commercial sheen to the
cinematography and editing tell you that this isn't a pure Tarantino
product. That, and a reliance in casting on second-division Medium-Name
players like Gary Oldman, Christian Slater, and Christopher Walken
rather than Tarantino's own rep company of intensely intense types like
Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, and Tim Roth.
All the ferocious humour and oddball dialogue that graces Pulp Fiction
and Reservoir Dogs is here too, slightly spoiled only by a few moments
that are funny without meaning to be. Check out Gary Oldman's brief but
memorable appearance as Patricia Arquette's pimp for an idea of what can
happen when you give the wardrobe and hair departments too much room to
be creative. Or Gary Oldman, for that matter. Despite such petty
caveils, however, this is the most exhilarating, funny, and exciting
Saturday night special you'll see until Tarantino's next movie, whenever
that is.
The cobwebby old plot device of matching tattoos hasn't been used, as
far as Couch Potato can recall, since an old Carry On film in which the
story turned on the possession by each of the rival heroines of half a
treasure map inked on their backsides, but Norberto Barka plays a fair
variation on the old story in his Japanese-gangsters melo Blue Tiger
(rental, cert. 18), starring Reservoir Dog Michael Madsen's sister
Virginia as the vengeful mother of a little boy accidentally mown down
in the crossfire of a Yakuza shootout.
Along the road to revenge she discovers that the killer has a tattoo
of a blue tiger all over his back and, courtesy of mystic tattoo artist
Harry Dean Stanton, gets a matching red one herself before going to work
in a gangster-friendly cocktail bar where she makes it her business to
get the customers into situations where she can get a good look at their
etchings. Gee . . . that's motherhood, eh?
Various mistakes and confusions occur before she finds the right guy,
and then -- wouldn't you just know it? -- she falls in love with him.
What's a girl to do? You can probably work it out for yourselves, but
it's well worth renting the tape to find out in detail, even if only for
a brilliant cameo performance by Virginia's brother Michael ''Mr
Blonde'' Madsen. Not bad for a straight-to-video picture at all, at all.
Hostile Hostages (rental, cert. 15) might as well have gone straight
to video itself for all the popcorn it sold on its cinema release, but
this debut by Jonathan Demme's wee brother Ted is a deftly handled and
oddly good-natured kidnap comedy in which Denis Leary, better known as a
chain-smoking and acerbic stand-up comedian, takes Judy Davis and Kevin
Spacey hostage in their home while escaping from a cocked-up robbery --
and than gets so tied up in their personal problems and family troubles
that he can't bring himself either to kill them or run away.
Pleasantly dated in its storyline, with strong echoes of several
bad-guy-comes-good Warner Brothers features of the 1930s, Hostile
Hostages rolls along with plenty of light-hearted fun and style and well
deserves to be rescued from Video Hell.

DANNY Boyle has done a splendid job with Shallow Grave (18) which we
all hope will be Scotland's and 1995's answer to Four Weddings and a
Funeral. It is probably a vain hope, but the film has secured major
distribution instead of being confined to the arts-house circuit, the
normal fate of low-budget, no-star-names, no-previous-track-record
films, so it may take a trick. A smart, and very black, comedy thriller,
it starts off brilliantly and then fades away into cliche and irrelevant
violence, becoming yet another variation on the old, over-familiar story
about how greed corrupts.
The problem for any thriller is that crucial moment when the reader,
the listener, or the viewer sits back and says -- ''Yes, but . . . !''
The moment comes too soon for Shallow Grave's good. The plot is simple
and neatly contrived if poorly developed. Two Leopolds, Christopher
Eccleston and Ewan McGregor, and a female Loeb, Kerry Fox sporting a
passable Scots accent for a Kiwi, live together in a large top-floor
appartment in Edinburgh's New Town. They require a fourth friend to help
with the rent, a minor, although not important, ''Yes, but . . . !''
After lots of would-be wanna-be-like-youse-yins are interviewed and
rejected -- the interviews are very funny -- Loeb Lady, who is a junior
doctor, picks a saturnine bit of rough played by Keith Allen. He retires
to his room and is not seen again. The role-playing trio -- they are
into superior mac-master race games -- decide something is amiss, break
open the door, and find Mr Allen giving what one could call an
outstanding performance. He is lying stark naked on the quilt dead from
a drug overdose, and under the bed is a suitcase stuffed with money.
This is the major ''Yes, but . . . '' moment. What would you do if
avarice overcame you in such circumstances? You would remove the cash,
leave the case, hide the money in a safe place, and call the police to
report that your lodger was a dead body. And you would leave the money
untouched for ages. What you would not do is take the body out to the
woods, disfigure it, and bury it in a shallow grave, which is what this
collection of master-race rejects do. And even if you were so foolish,
you would not leave the man's car parked outside your house for his
accomplices to find, because the first rule of the game, when it comes
to large sums of used fivers, is that they always belong to somebody
other than the person who has them, and that person, or persons, will
come looking for them.
I will not spoil what follows, except to say that thieves fall out,
Lady Loeb starts to exploit her sexual hold over the two Leopolds, and
they start to triplecross each other. One has been there a thousand
times before. Meanwhile the witty lines, which have graced the early
part of John Hodge's script, dry up and instead we get some irrelevant
and unnecessarily unpleasant violence patently modelled on Tarantino,
but failing the crucial test.
Tarantino views his thugs totally dispassionately, recognising their
immorality, which is why the violence is funny. Here it is exploitative,
a mere decoration, which is not the same. There are actually several
''Yes, but . . . '' moments, one of the more blatant being when we find
a knife in a body which nobody does anything about. There is good
reason, but when you discover what it is, it proves to be a case of too
clever by half, which is what is wrong with the film -- for me at least.
The three starlets are pleasing enough, with Christopher Eccleston
coming off best as an old-maidish chartered accountant. Ewan McGregor is
both pretty and pretty unconvincing as a randy Evening Times reporter,
but Kerry Fox as Lucky Pierrette Loeb, the sex goddess in the middle,
while acting her little heart out rather well, is about as alluring as a
bowl of cold porridge -- without salt.
Produced by Andrew Macdonald, photographed by Brian Tufano, the film
looks handsome, the colour-coded New Town flat -- art director, Zoe
Macleod -- is magnificently gruesome, Simon Boswell's excellent edgy
score lends the necessary urgency to the goings-on, and Mr Boyle's
control of his material is evident throughout. The film's zest and style
make it a good start to the New Year in the cinema.
The world's only famous Belgian, Jean Claude Van Damme, stars as a
Washington policeman in Time Cop (18), an ingenious science-fiction
thriller which plays effectively with the paradoxes of time travel and
has some good special effects to boot. Directed by Peter Hyams, the
story begins in 1994 with the murder of Van Damme's wife, and then moves
on a decade. Time travel is a reality and Jean Claude, who has become a
time cop, sets about solving the crime by revisiting the past. A
thoroughly entertaining piece of hokum, this is one of the Brussels
sprout's best movies, light years ahead of his last two.
Wes Craven gave birth to one of horror cinema's great monsters, Freddy
Kruger, the man with knives for fingers, in the inventive and genuinely
frightening Nightmare on Elm Street a decade ago. The character survived
several sequels, mostly directed by other people, in which the plots
deteriorated and the nastiness became stereoptyped until one hoped
Freddy, played by Robert Englund, had been killed off for good.
Not so. In Wes Craven's New Nightmare (18), an ingenious mix of fact
and fiction, the real Craven wants the real Heather Langenkamp (Nancy in
parts one and two of the Freddy saga) to resume her role in a new Freddy
film alongside the real Englund as Freddy. But the real Heather and her
small son, Miko Hughes, a fiction, are being terrorised by an even
nastier Freddy, and her husband, a fiction, is killed by him.
Has Freddy really come alive? Or is Craven indulging in a bit of
blackmail of his reluctant star? The mixture of life and celluloid is
certainly challenging and this is in a sense the horror film
deconstructed. But Freddy should have been left in peace because the
film is a cinema nasty and too clever by half.
The violence is only there for those who like to salivate over
violence at second-hand, and the intricate juggling between the real and
the imaginary will simply puzzle its likely audience. The fact that it
has been granted a certificate and will also end up on video is proof
that our Censors, if they don't actually need their heads looked at, a
rum lot.
As for Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (15) directed by Gus Van Sant,
maybe My Perfect Idaho was a fluke after all, because this allegedly
picaresque tale based on a novel by Tom Robbins, starring Uma Thurman,
Lorraine Bracco, Sean Young, Keanu Reeves, Angie Dickinson, and River
Phoenix's sister Rain, is tedious, muddled, and maudlin. With a cast
like that how could anybody go wrong? Van Sant does in spades.

Somewhat belatedly, I am writing in response to Kenneth Roy's
extremely disparaging, derogatory piece on Scottish pubs (December 12).
He states that the Scottish licensed trade continues to behave as if
''nothing had changed since the cloudy morning of our bleary-eyed dads''
and that ''20 years on (from the Clayson report) what we see is the same
dreary collection of fat, bejeaned bums on bar stools''.
I beg to differ, loudly and strongly. There has been a metamorphosis
in Scotland in the past 20 years which, for some reason, has bypassed
the sadly myopic Kenneth Roy. Here are just a few examples of the
changes which we have experienced.
The growth of the restaurant pub concepts developed by the brewers
including Beefeater, Brewer's Fayre, Homestead's, as well as striking
examples of individual entrepreneurism creating family pub entertainment
centres such as the Bridge Inn, Ratho, which has won more national
awards than (probably) Kenneth Roy had bottles of burgundy over the
festive season.
The introduction of pubs of style which introduce to Scottish social
life some of the concepts which our dads would have found only in their
irregular forays abroad.
Pubs such as Montpeliers in Edinburgh's Bruntsfield (somewhat
ironically lavishly praised in The Herald only a few days after Kenneth
Roy's article), the avant garde Maxaluna in Glasgow's Sauchiehall
Street, Ryan's Bar in Edinburgh's West End, and countless others like
them to which the Scots are flocking regularly in vast numbers.
Not solely on account of their attractive ambience but also because
they provide excellent, exciting sustenance which is the product of
creative management who pay attention to the detail and training
required to get it right first time.
The improvement in the quality of our traditional beer pubs. There are
tens of thousands of traditional pubs in Scotland and most of them now
serve a varied range of food and drink products at competitive prices.
Has Kenneth Roy never visited establishments such as Bert's Bar, T &amp; J
Bernard's, the Griffin, the Horse Shoe, the Guildford (Edinburgh), the
Canny Man (Edinburgh), or the Fisherman's Tavern in Broughty Ferry which
only recently won the Camra award as National Pub of the Year (UK)?
The abundance of excellent cask conditional and keg beers now
available in the market-place. The Scottish beer drinker has never been
better catered for, whether his tipple is cask-conditioned,
nitrogen-dispensed, or a more conventional keg ale, lager or stout.
The name of the brewing game is choice -- the days of the monopolistic
megabrands are over. All the national and regional brewers are
contributing to the development of beer drinking in Scotland with
innovative product changes and we now have 14 breweries flourishing
north of the Border.
I openly challenge Kenneth Roy to visit a cross section of Scottish
pubs, either the ones mentioned in this letter or others selected at
random. Perhaps then he might write a better researched and more
balanced article.

CONSUMERS were borrowing at record levels in November, suggesting they
have the confidence to take on extra debt to support spending levels
while disposable incomes are being squeezed by tax hikes and low pay
increases.
The figures were interpreted in the City as another sign that the
consumer was alive and kicking despite the absence of a feel good
factor. Hopes for strong Christmas sales have been boosted in recent
days by anecdotal evidence from leading stores groups, but it would not
be the first time that such indications have been contradicted by the
official retail sales figures.
Net consumer credit rose sharply in November to a seasonally adjusted
#677m from #541m in October, according to new-style figures compiled by
the Bank of England. It was the highest monthly figures since the Bank
began compiling the data in April 1993. Quarterly figures go further
back, and these suggest that the November total may well be an all-time
record.
Goldman Sach's David Walton said that the consumer credit and John
Lewis sales figures (also published yesterday) suggested the gloom about
consumer spending had been overdone.
''There's been a lot of talk about the feel good factor, but one of
the best ways of demonstrating whether people feel better is by
measuring how much they are prepared to borrow.''
The Bank of England figures are much more comprehensive than the
old-style credit figures, published by the Central Statistical Office,
and for the first time provide a comprehensive picture of lending to the
personal sector.
The credit component of the figures includes overdrafts and personal
loans from the banks as well as lending on cards. In addition the Bank
is publishing data on secured lending on property, mainly mortgages.
The picture here is by no means as encouraging. Net secured lending on
dwellings rose from a seasonally adjusted #1555m in October to #1659m in
November, but the October figure was below par, and the November one was
close to the average for the first 10 months of the year.
The housing market has lagged behind the rest of the economy, and
there is nothing in these figures to suggest an early end to its
lack-lustre state. Indeed secured lending fell by 0.5% between the
latest two three monthly periods.
One sign of hope was a jump in the value of loans approved from #4860m
to #5143m between October and November, but this could easily prove a
false dawn. The figures include refinancing of fixed-rate mortgages
whose term has expired.
Within the net credit figures lending on cards jumped from #91m to
#156m between the latest two months, while other loans, including
overdrafts and personal loans, which have accounted for most of the
acceleration in consumer credit, were #521m against #450m in October.
The car trade had a good run in 1994, which was the best for four
years, but earlier hopes that new car registrations would top two
million were not realised.
Figures published yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders showed that new registrations increased by 7.45% to 1,910,933
last year, but there was a year-on-year decline of 0.67% in December.
Business raced ahead in the first half of the year, but has tailed off
since, and registrations posted year-on-year declines in each of the
last three months of the year.
The trade is forecasting growth of just 2% for the current year, and
is in a gloomy mood. But City analysts think it could be more cheerful
12 months from now.
At James Capel economist Adam Cole made the point that registrations
were not a precise guide to final sales, and argued that the gloom
associated with the fourth quarter drop in registrations had been
overdone.
The credit and car registration figures don't have a significant
influence on monetary policy. Figures on retail sales and industrial
output due later this month will help quantify the pace of activity.
Along with the inflation indicators they will determine how soon the
Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer
decide on the next increase in interest rates.

I am pleased that Eric Stockton supports the hospice movement
(December 20). However, I feel that his use of the word survival is
misplaced. From my understanding people who are in hospices are there to
add quality to their life in the time they have left.
I value life and the principle of the sanctity of life. However, I am
as much against the prolonging of life by extraordinary means as I am
against the intentional killing of an individual.
My thoughts on life are quite different from that of Mr Stockton's so
my attitude as to what is ''useful and good'' is quite different as
well.
There is a great danger in legislating for the individual in that any
legalisation of euthanasia, be it voluntary or otherwise, will infringe
on another individual's rights, as indeed we have seen with abortion.
Despite strong approval by the BMA there are many doctors who do not
wish to be tied to the Living Wills as supported by Phyllis Goodheir
(December 30).
The individual who draws up the will has no basis for making an
informed decision. Living Wills are designed to lead to the legalisation
of euthanasia.

There is an air of complete unreality about the debate on when Labour
intends that a Scottish parliament will be up and running. Given that
the main jibes are coming from the Nationalists who oppose a Scottish
parliament inside the United Kingdom it is not surprising that they
prefer propaganda to the truth.
Let me restate the facts. Labour will legislate for a Scottish
parliament and a Welsh assembly within the first year of the new
Parliament. Only the enemies of that Scottish parliament now doubt that
commitment given by both Tony Blair and, before him, John Smith.
That parliament will be in place and operational as quickly as
possible thereafter. To other than the deliberately malicious, this is
self-evidently in the interest of Scotland and indeed of the Government
of the day.
However this is a new parliament we are creating, and it will be one
of the most radical acts of modernising the British state and the way
Scotland is run in centuries. To believe that this can, or should, be
done in five minutes is to devalue the whole historic exercise. It might
at most take up to 18 months to have elections, complete the transfer of
accountability from Ministers to Members, and to establish the machinery
of the new legislature. It might be less and no time will be lost.
It will, after all, take 18 months to get Scotland's new councils up
and running from Royal Assent, and the SNP stated that this was too
short a time-scale.
People in Scotland will notice that the Nationalist Leader uses the
example of the Berlin Wall and the unhappy bust-up of Czechoslovakia in
hectoring about time-scales. If these two events are to be the SNP
models for the transition to a separate Scottish state then we are
getting much closer to the traumatic truth of that venture.

Given the strength of the ferocious attack on Labour's plans for a
strong Scottish parliament inside and strengthening the United Kingdom
you begin to realise how desperate John Major is to find any policy to
unite his fractured party. What was more interesting were his allies in
the attack.
Jim Sillars writes of his ''delighted reaction'' to John Major whose
attack, he says, was ''pure dead brilliant''. And his delight went even
further as he looked forward to the coming Tory assault on the
aspirations of the Scottish people.
But now the power of 10 Downing Street, the might of the Government
machine, and its ability to set the political and parliamentary agenda,
is coming into play. All the facts, and defects, of devolution will be
flushed out in a very public debate.
So here we have the one-time self-appointed champion of the Scots
joining in the hysterical untrue, scaremongering attack on the plan to
give Scotland its own parliament inside the UK -- and egging on the Tory
hyenas as they howl. It is a vivid demonstration of the unscrupulous and
unprincipled nature of the separatist ambition of the SNP.
The fact that the SNP and the Tories now so closely and so
harmoniously sing the same tune will not be lost on the Scottish people.
As John Major tells them that their views are of no consequence, the
support he gets from the SNP top-brass will turn many Scottish stomachs.

The City of Glasgow District Council is to be congratulated on its
efforts in helping to win the 1999 City of Architecture and Design
Award.
To assist in the provision for this new event of new or altered
buildings, involving planning approval, one can only hope that the
public hours of Glasgow District Council Planning Department will be
significantly increased from the present maximum of 20 hours per week.
Strenuous efforts are made by the administrative and clerical staff of
this council department to prevent access by the public to planning
officers except in the morning before 12.30pm. Even then contact is
restricted with the phones often engaged and meetings permitted only if
by prior appointment.
Surely the citizens of Glasgow are now entitled to a user-friendly,
accessible, helpful, efficient, quicker, quality planning system,
especially with the newly increased planning fees at the start of 1995.

DEAR Eamonn and Madsen,
When we were at St Andrews University together in the late sixties,
few people would have given you odds on getting a think-tank like the
Adam Smith Institute off the ground, far less that it would be so
influential on Government thinking.
The poll tax is credited to you -- it can hardly be your fault it was
pitched so high per capita. Privatisation is another of your wheezes
which has had a good innings as our cricketing Prime Minister might say.
But you don't need me to tell you that the Government has been enjoying
the same kind of success as the English cricket team.
Time for a new tactic, perhaps? May I respectfully suggest one? It
can't have escaped your notice that prisons have been much in the news
this week with a riot in North Humberside and a breakout on the Isle of
Wight. Along the coast at Shoreham, the beastie boys of animal rights
have been beating hell out of a few lorries containing live animals.
The costs of repairing the damage and paying police overtime will make
our recent floods in Strathclyde look like a drop in the ocean. What if
we could turn this loss into an asset?
What I have in mind involves making crime part of the Gross National
Product. Adopt it as a free enterprise activity and charge all the costs
of terrorist bombs, prison riots, vandalism, robberies, and murder
hunts, to the private sector.
It is a growth area with enormous potential. We have always had
successful thugs in Britain. Some of them started out as football
hooligans with battle honours such as Heysel behind them, and go on to
greater things when they end up in prison where they are able to cause
much more damage. This, in turn, acts as a stimulus to industry -- and I
don't just mean building contractors. There is the insurance industry to
think of. How could they possibly have been able to justify steep rises
in premiums without a healthy crime industry upon which to rely as their
justification?
I know that we have not reached the productivity of some other nations
with regard to crime. The US is still well ahead of us in murder rates
but in recent years we have shown an amazing upturn in white-collar
crime and the drug trade. This must have contributed to our
balance-of-payments situation. Maybe not all of this money has been
available to the Inland Revenue but in a free market you can't have
everything. We should just be glad that in the middle of a recession
there have been some industries which were thriving, as Government
spokesmen have been telling us.
For a while some of our best criminal brains were going overseas to
Spain, and it is another sign of recovery in our crime economy that many
top men in the industry are now returning to Britain. Last week we
welcomed back Ronnie Knight, whose money laundering expertise might have
been lost to the UK.
So far I have not mentioned how the police will fit into all this.
They will, of course, be floated as a public utility, raising millions
for the public purse. This will result in a great deal of extra
responsibility for senior police officers, so I would recommend that in
line with other public utilities such as the gas industry, chief
constables be paid a salary increase of at least #100,000. This would be
offset by large-scale redundancies among police officers -- in my view
there are far too many to be seen on the streets, especially at the
festive season when nothing very much is happening.
As well as resulting in considerable savings for the public purse, the
new National Police Trust plc will also create a suitable climate for
the crime industry to get off the ground. There is nothing that hampers
an industry more than over-regulation as Mr Portillo has been telling
us.
In addition, prisons could be closed and the inmates offered an
opportunity for a business start-up scheme if they agree to return to
crime.
However I have another idea. The Child Support Agency has not been a
great success apparently because it demanded too much from fathers in
financial support. A new Crime Support Agency would take a smaller
element of the cut (a bit like betting tax really). Although some people
might see it as extortion, I don't expect the criminal industry to be
all that popular with the voters for this criticism to gather force. The
genius of the idea is that you rob Peterman but you don't have to pay PC
Paul, because he's funded by private schemes which charge people for
services like Neighbourhood Watch.
I've left the best bit until last. You may wonder where the Home
Secretary fits into all this. Isn't he responsible for police, prisons,
and crime control? Well, under the new scheme this will all be the
problem of Michael Heseltine at the Board of Trade. I presume you don't
want a repeat of what happened to Home Secretary Michael Howard this
week. Some people were actually suggesting that he was responsible for
these areas and therefore what had gone wrong. Under the new scheme it
would all be a matter of market forces and the Government would have no
responsibility whatsoever.
The police and the criminals would be left to get on with it, making
money for Britain. (I hesitate to say given enough rope in the light of
recent unfortunate events.)
Yours aye, Stewart.

DON'T breathe a word, folks: but I think the English are at last
beginning to look around, under the influence of political change
elsewhere, and ask themselves who they are, with or without the other
peoples of these islands, at the end of the twentieth century. This week
Radio 3 launched a year-long celebration of British music under the
title Fairest Isle, timed to coincide with, among other things, the
300th anniversary of the death of one of England's greatest composers,
Henry Purcell, and already it's possible to sense a kind of
political buzz around the reassessment of the seventeenth century --
the century when ''Britain'' as we know it began to be formed -- which
this anniversary suggests.
The great set-piece of the season's first day, New Year's Day, was a
three-hour evening broadcast of The Faerie Queen, a 1692 masque based on
Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream for which Purcell wrote the score;
although despite a pair of brilliant, elemental performances from Diana
Quick and Jack Klaff as Titania and Oberon, the main effect of the
piece, and of Purcell's tripping, well-organised music, seemed to be to
remind us just how much English culture lost, in the way of guts and
sensuality, in the century between Shakespeare's 1590s and Purcell's
1690s.
It was the Bristol academic Ronald Hutton, though, in a series of
clever talks about the age of Purcell, who began to tease out the
precise nature of those changes in terms of the shift from magic to
rationalism, from mystical monarchism to modern constitutionalism. His
fourth talk, broadcast on Thursday evening under the title Killing
Fields, was a little masterpiece of its kind, a brilliant exploration of
how England in the seventeenth century gradually lost the opportunity to
reach some kind of modus vivendi with the other -- and particularly the
Celtic -- cultures of these islands, moving instead towards a system of
government based on suppression of the peripheral peoples, a buy-out of
the Lowland Scots, and cultural assimilation based on an assumption of
the superiority of London-based mercantile capitalism over every other
form of social organisation.
All of which reminded me most bitterly of Radio 4's Hogmanay Saturday
Night Theatre, a highly competent and entertaining version of Compton
Mackenzie's Whisky Galore, adapted by Hector MacMillan and directed in
Edinburgh by Hamish Wilson; for no matter how witty, shrewd, or steeped
in aspects of real Hebridean culture this story may be, I cannot help
being irritated and dispirited by the depiction of the people of the
islands as a bunch of amusing alcoholic subversives fooling around on
the edges of the serious business of the British state.
In the general end-of-century crisis of confidence in British
institutions, though, it seems everything
is suddenly up for debate, including ''the whole idea of our national
identity and what it consists of'' (Nicolas Kenyon, controller of Radio
3), and the very citadel of merchantile capitalism itself, the City of
London. This week in Radio 4's Analysis slot Will Hutton of the Guardian
launched a series of programmes on The City with a powerful historical
survey in the course of which that same 300-year period, from the late
seventeenth century to the present day, came under scrutiny again and
again, as the period which coincides -- by no means accidentally -- with
the emergence of the City as the world's greatest financial centre.
But what Hutton seems to be arguing is that the City's historical
detachment from the real British economy (''it barely even noticed'' the
Industrial Revolution, according to one of his interviewees), its total
indifference to the actual welfare and employment of the people, its
chronic short-termism, the grotesque levels of self-enrichment of its
inner circle, and its habit of perpetuating a set of cultural values
that are snobbish, anti-industrial, racist, sexist, and largely
meaningless outside the English upper-middle classes, are becoming
intolerably damaging in an age when nations need to respect and invest
in their own people, or lose out in fierce global competition.
Hutton is a well-known decentralising subversive, a supporter of those
''dangerous'' Labour proposals for regional government and regional
development throughout these battered isles. If he can make his argument
stick, it could be a sign of yet another crack in the old structure of
British power, built with much blood and money between 1660 and 1707,
and perhaps due for radical reconstruction at last.

THE priests of ancient Rome could not have regarded animal entrails
with more interest than we assess the latest spending data. Contemporary
preoccupation with the credit statistics has two, but contradictory,
dimensions. On the one hand they are looked at with hope -- higher
borrowings presage more orders, for what retailers sell today have to be
replaced tomorrow. Often the replacements come from abroad and the very
efficiency of the UK retail sector allows for speedy and deep import
penetration, particularly in textiles. But that seems not to be
happening at the moment, though November's retail borrowing set new
records -- somewhere some people must be feeling better. And though the
Christmas data have yet to appear, some evidence (from Boots and Next,
for example) is already encouraging.
On the other hand this same surge contains the seeds of a further
possible tightening of interest rates after the Chancellor and the
Governor of the Bank of England confer early next month. If there was
another surge last month it might appear that a consumer boom is on its
way and needs to be slowed before it gains too much momentum. The
trouble is that further increases in the cost of money may hit the wrong
targets, cash for more investment, and those small companies which have
already borrowed to invest, while leaving consumers unaffected. The
pattern of borrowing discloses the fact that consumers are taking
advantage of their ability to enjoy short-term retail credit and low
(and sometimes no) cost while they remain most reluctant to take on
longer-term commitments, like mortgages where lending remains fairly
restrained. This certainly fits the pattern already identified where
consumers lack the confidence to borrow for more than a few months while
still feeling able to pursue immediate bargains. Retailers have been
unable to restore their profit margins and are having to rely on volume
sales. To that extent retail inflation at least is being contained, as
is inflation in earnings, even where these have been edging up somewhat.
The experience of the United States, where economic growth is running
too fast for the comfort of the monetary authorities, seems likely to
force up interest rates there. Although there has been a long-standing
hope that we might de-couple from American financial movements it seems
unlikely that we would do so on this occasion. Like the Americans we
were earlier into the recession than our continental partners, and so
have come faster out and may suffer over-heating sooner. Given his
earlier arguments, Mr George seems certain to put this case, but it is
not clear that the Chancellor will want to accept it. We will all know
the nature of their discussion when the minutes of their February
meeting are eventually published, but earlier still its outcome will
have been made manifest in the policy decision. The two contradictory
feelings will, therefore, continue to co-exist -- hope that higher
spending will make clear the fact that the recovery is established and
popularly recognised, and fear that it will encourage the nation's money
managers to slow it down too soon.

ALL things considered, it has been a week of high drama and low humour
for television. For a start, there was mischievous Andrew Davies,
maybe/just about/ almost/as near as dammit Britain's top TV writer, in
danger of cutting off his nose to spite his face when he delivered the
Huw Wheldon lecture on BBC2 on Monday afternoon.
And the man who brought us House of Cards, Middlemarch, and A Very
Peculiar Practice didn't miss and hit the wall. BBC1, BBC2, and ITV, he
moaned, were all guilty of flogging dead horses. Of playing safe by
taking works of proven success and running them into the ground. Of
chasing the ratings at the expense of quality.
Now, he may have a point -- but he sure picked a bad week in which to
make it for dead horses have been conspicuous by their absence this past
seven days. You couldn't move for new programmes -- good, bad, and in
one case breathtakingly brilliant.
The best came first. The very day before Mr Davies's diatribe was
broadcast, BBC1 offered up as delicious a slice of television drama as
you're likely to find all year. Cold Comfort Farm was a treat, a
wonderful story with a start, a middle, and an end (call me
old-fashioned, but that's the way to tell 'em).
Beautifully filmed by veteran movie director John Schlesinger and with
a cracking adaptation of Stella Gibbons's comic 1930s novel from the pen
of Malcolm Bradbury, it was undoubtedly the highlight of the festive
season (damned by faint praise, you might say, since the test card came
in second).
But surely this was exactly the type of thing which Andrew Davies was
crying out for? A wildly eccentric, genuinely funny, not to mention
elegant comedy with fine performances from some of Britain's best actors
(Ian McKellen, Stephen Fry, Freddie Jones, and Joanna Lumley). Something
new. Something different. Something unpredictable. And yet something
which was wonderfully accessible to all.
And then on Monday evening, only hours after the same Mr Davies
stepped down from his high horse, came a timely contribution from BBC
Scotland. OK, the network clearly lost its bottle, churlishly choosing
to tuck Paul Murton's contemporary tale of the supernatural, The Blue
Boy, away on BBC2 (leaving BBC1 to screen a movie repeat). But
nevertheless, here was a very watchable programme of a high quality and
one which offered a rare television appearance from Emma Thompson (so
nothing's perfect). And it was good. Maybe not brilliant, but certainly
good. Proof positive that there's more to life at Queen Margaret Drive
than Rab C Nesbitt and documentaries about wee wifies dancing in Cuba.
The Blue Boy did what a ghost story is supposed to do, you see. It
haunted you. Its only real problem was the casting. Why was it necessary
for BBC Scotland to give the three principal roles to Emma Thompson and
Eleanor Bron (both of whom are English) and Adrian Dunbar (an Irishman)?
The characters, after all, were supposed to be Scottish. Sadly, the
accents failed to convince.
Old Andrew Davies must have been turning on his podium on Monday
evening because it turned out to be a veritable feast of drama. On ITV
there was the welcome return of a bewigged Roy Marsden as P D James's
detective hero, Adam Dalgliesh, in A Mind To Murder. Now that Ruth
Rendell's Wexford (George Baker) and Colin Dexter's Morse (John Thaw)
have been given early retirement, and Jim Taggart, God bless him, has
passed on to plod heaven's beat, Commander Dalgliesh is just about the
last surviving TV cop on the whodunit squad.
Of course, whodunit didn't really matter. Which was just as well since
the plot was as thick as a plate of two-day-old soup and had more
suspects than you could shake a stick at.
Then came disappointment number one of the week. Kavanagh QC, at two
hours, was too long by half. It was a sad sight -- John Thaw, an actor
who can't put a foot wrong unless he wanders off for a year in Provence,
hamming it up in a shamelessly predictable and cliche-ridden courtroom
drama. This was Rumpole of the Bailey with a ''delete humour'' button.
The characters were one-dimensional -- Thaw as an urbane middle-class QC
with North Country roots and marital problems, Ewan McGregor (currently
to be seen in Shallow Grave) as a dishy middle-class student accused of
raping a middle-class housewife (Alison Steadman in untypically stilted
form). The story was far too simple to sustain a two-hour drama and the
denoument was achingly obvious.
Disappointment number two came on Wednesday night with the latest
batch of Tartan Shorts from BBC Scotland. This is supposed to be a
showcase for new Scottish talent, an opportunity for film makers to
establish themselves through the short-film format. This year's offering
was heavy on style but light on substance.
Narance, written by Toby Curnow and directed by Patrick Harkins, was
the best of the three, a well-intentioned and genuinely
thought-provoking story about a refugee child's alienation from the
war-torn country of her birth. It tried bravely to bend the rules of
television drama -- and succeeded up to a point. The second, Kathy
Crombie's Daddy's Gone A-Hunting, was a gloomy, uneven, and, quite
frankly, poorly acted play about a little girl's revenge on her brutal
father. But the worst Tartan Short was surely the one which should have
been the best. Written by Liz Lochhead and starring Neil Pearson and
Siobhan Redmond, Latin For A Dark Room turned out to be an optical
illusion -- an obscure and pretentious little film about passion and
murder set in nineteenth-century Edinburgh.
Like its companion pieces, it was completely lacking in humour. Which,
by itself, is fine. After all, there's nothing in the contract which
says that Tartan Shorts have to be funny. It's just that, watching these
very earnest little films one after the other was a bit like listening
to a Leonard Cohen album. It's being so cheery as keeps them going, I
suppose. The selectors for this year's entries would be well-advised to
choose three projects which offer the viewer a much more varied
emotional scope.
Finally this week, I was surprised to see Leslie Grantham turning up
like a bad penny on ITV as ex-cop Mick Raynor, once again working
undercover in lowlife London in a second series of the
gratuitously-violent 99-1. Now here's a programme that doesn't mess
about -- ugly, brutal, nasty . . . and proud of it. And yet somehow it
lacks power. It's little more than chewing-gum for the eyeballs. You are
left with the impression that it is, in the end, an insignificant and
faintly unpleasant drama, a programme you can take or leave. Still,
maybe we've just been spoiled by Cracker's depth, intelligence, and
ability to shock.

ISAIAH BERLIN By John Gray.
HarperCollins, #18 (pp 183).
THIS slim study advances from a simple but undeniable proposition:
that Isaiah Berlin is one of Britain's most important thinkers yet his
philosophical work has been scandalously undervalued, if not actually
ignored.
Such neglect has something to do, perhaps, with the times in which we
live. Berlin's work in moral and political philosophy -- in particular
his contributions to liberal theory -- have run against the grain of the
age.
Where the secular and religious majorities have supported, often
unquestioningly, ideas of ''harmonious'' values and the rational
resolution of dilemmas, Berlin has pursued what John Gray calls
value-pluralism -- the belief, in plain words, that not all conflicts
between ultimate values can be resolved by reason.
Clearly, this is not what many people would like to hear, even if it
happens to be a realistic and, in the simplest sense of the word, humane
argument. Berlin holds out little prospect of that certainty sought by
generations of philosophers, politicians, and religious believers.
Instead, he offers a stoical acceptance of the fact that a utopian age
of harmony is not, and never will be, just around the corner. In his
world eternal, ultimate truth does not triumph invariably because
ultimate truth is not available.
Or as he wrote in Four Essays on Liberty: ''Indeed, the very desire
for guarantees that our values are eternal and secure in some objective
heaven is perhaps only a craving for the certainties of childhood or the
absolute values of our primitive past.''
Such an observation, however valid, is naturally of no use to the
fanatics, ideologues, or true believers engaged in the holy wars of
scripture, manifesto, and intellectual sectarianism of which this
century has seen more than its share. For the intellectually
conservative, Berlin is the worst kind of liberal (rapidly replacing
''Communist'' as the bogeyman of the West) because he insists on
relativism, on radical choice rather than so-called rational choice.
This is not what popes, dictators, ayatollahs, Stalinists, or the Moral
Majority want to hear.
It is, however, one of the roads to freedom, and its denial has
profound consequences. Or as Bernard Williams, quoted by Gray, has put
it: 'if there are many and competing genuine values, then the greater
the extent to which a society tends to be single-valued, the more
genuine values it neglects or suppresses. More, to this extent, must
mean better.''
Though Gray's book is a study rather than a biography, it is easy to
see from the facts of Berlin's life how he might have arrived at his
philosophical positions. Born the descendant of Chabad Hasidim, in Riga
in 1909, he witnessed the first Russian Revolution in Petersburg in
February of 1917, and the Bolshevik coup later that year. He saw the
future, promised yet never delivered by invincible ''scientific
socialism'', as it began to unfold.
After a brief return to Latvia he moved to England, devoting much of
his subsequent working life to Oxford University. During the Holocaust,
however, he lost his grandfathers, an uncle, an aunt, and three cousins
to the Nazis and their implacable ''truth''. Thus, with what Gray calls
a 'plural inheritance'' -- Jewish, Russian, and English -- behind him,
Berlin understands better than most the tragedies to which fanatical
certainty can lead.
That awareness animates all his writings. As a philosopher, he has
straddled the divide between the British-American tradition and Europe
while maintaining a quintessentially Jewish perspective. Some have
compared him to David Hume, and as Gray writes, the comparison is not
altogether misleading, nor ridiculous.
Fundamentally, however, Berlin is a man of his age, who has fought out
the battles of the century on the printed page. Asking the old question
''What is to be done?'' he has proposed a very human reply: ''The best
that can be done, as a general rule, is to maintain a precarious
equilibrium that will prevent the occurrence of desperate situations, of
intolerable choices -- that is the first requirement for a decent
society.''
In the age of the zealot, of the bigot, and the fundamentalist, each
insisting that theirs is the only truth, that quiet answer has made
Berlin a greater asset to Britain than Britain yet realises.

AMERICA'S Republicans, revelling in the control of both houses of
Congress for the first time in 40 years, have proclaimed a ''new era'',
but President Clinton insisted that he was ''encouraged'' by what he
heard and saw when the two sides met formally on Thursday. Mr Clinton is
the first President since Truman to have Congress arrayed against him,
but is promising co-operation rather than confrontation. The Republicans
may easily make that impossible, for they feel that they represent a new
public mood which is hostile to the aspirations of liberal America for,
and to, which Mr Clinton speaks. Yet Mr Clinton has already pledged to
go part of the way in their direction by promising to cut taxation. He
may not propose as deep cuts as they would like, but the fact of cuts at
all is disturbing given the federal budget deficit and the large
accumulated debt. It is true that the Republicans at least have the
intellectual defence of hopes for huge accompanying reductions in public
spending (though they may not have fully assessed the social
consequences of these) and are hoping for a balanced budget. Mr Clinton
will know how unlikely it is that such hopes can be fulfilled. He will
have to fight the Congress at some time in the next two years.
Truman did precisely that, and with considerable success. A President
has two powerful advantages over Congress. He can veto their proposals,
enforcing some moderation as the price of passing any legislative
proposals, and he can appeal over their heads directly to the nation. It
may seem that Mr Clinton, so desperately unpopular at the moment, will
not feel able to make such challenges, but there will be many losers if
the Republicans press their advantage too far and insist on the full
right-wing prescription embodied in their rhetoric. The President, and
his running mate, are the only persons elected by the whole country. In
a way a President is almost forced to rise above party and endorse a
collective good which individual states and districts might otherwise
simply not recognise. Truman did this and eventually was rewarded for
his superior vision.
Historical parallels need never be pressed too far. Truman came into
office following Roosevelt's death at a time when elements of social
democracy were unusually powerful in the United States and when the tide
of world affairs, the end of the Second World War, and the beginnings of
its Cold War successor allowed his remarkable qualities, hitherto
concealed by his illustrious predecessor, to blossom quickly. He proved
to be a great President. Mr Clinton, by contrast, looked somewhat lame
before last autumn, and has already failed to translate most of his
original hopes into reality. He may rise to the challenge for he is an
able man, and much of what he sought to achieve remains attractive and
even necessary, it would seem to outsiders. He has two years in which to
ensure that he does not follow Mr Carter  as a one-term Democrat. He
will do so only if stands up to the Republicans, collaboration will
merely ensure his defeat, and deservedly.

<HEADLINE>Row erupts over Baxi offer for Barrhead Bitter war of words between the directors and McQuarrie</HEADLINE>

A BITTER row has broken out between the board of Barrhead Sanitaryware
and their former chairman Sir Albert McQuarrie over the offer from the
Baxi Partnership to acquire the ailing business.
The workers' co-operative was created in a new location in Hillington
after Shanks closed its sanitaryware works in Barrhead. It has been
incurring losses since production started.
Sir Albert has written to Barrhead shareholders urging them to reject
the deal until Baxi offers all shareholders, voting and non-voting, #1 a
share. At the moment Baxi is paying #1 only for preference shares.
Ordinary shareholders are being offered 40p for their #1 shares.
Barrhead's existing directors have responded with their own letter to
shareholders, accusing Sir Albert of dealing in ''inaccurate and
misleading'' information and again recommending acceptance of the Baxi
offer. They also threaten to report their former chairman to the
Securities and Investments Board.
In his letter, Sir Albert says: ''It must never be forgotten that the
workers in Barrhead Sanitaryware took a one-third cut in wages and
worked overtime for nothing when the business commenced. Now they will
lose a further #1200 because of the requirement to invest for 2000
shares in order to gain employment.
''Many borrowed the #2000 to buy the shares and face demands from
banks for repayment. Why should they not be paid #1 per #1 share now?
''In the case of non-voting shareholders many pensioners, families,
local authorities and a mass of others invested in the workers
co-operative. Why should they be denied the #1 per #1 share and only be
offered 40 pence per share by this large conglomerate?''
Sir Albert goes on to point out that shareholders who invested under
the Business Expansion Scheme also stand to lose the tax relief on their
original investment.
The basis of the former chairman's attack is the fact that Baxi paid
one-time rival bidder Shires #1 a share for its 125,000 #1 preference
shares last November and signed an agreement last month with Scottish
Enterprise to acquire its 200,000 #1 preference shares at #1 a share,
75p payable when the Baxi offer becomes unconditional and the rest this
September.
To pay #1 a share to the ordinary shareholders, Sir Albert argues,
would only cost Baxi a further #325,866. ''Chicken feed,'' he calls it,
for a group with net assets of #78m.
In their response, Barrhead's directors point out that Sir Albert
himself no longer holds any shares in the business. They point out that
the preference shares have privileged rights and that, if Barrhead were
wound up, would rank ahead of ordinary shareholders.
The directors attack Sir Albert's claim, in his letter, that Barrhead
has tangible assets of #1530m. The correct figure is #1,530,000. But
that was the book value of tangible assets in October 1993.
In their riposte, the Barrhead directors reveal that the company's
assets, by 31 October 1994, had shrunk to #194,000. Applying these funds
to Barrhead's preference shareholders would leave ordinary shareholders
with nothing.
Barrhead lost a further #267,000 in the year to last October and,
according to the directors' letter, continues to be cash negative,
despite fully taking up an earlier Baxi loan of #450,000.
''Baxi has confirmed to the board of Barrhead that it has no intention
of increasing the offers,'' the letter concludes.

IT is not often that a doctor's advice falls in with our own
inclinations. ''You need a long holiday,'' they might say. But no . . .
we emerge from the consulting room with instructions to exercise, lose
two stones, and cut down on alcohol. General practitioners themselves
are usually wiry and underweight. It could be that their animosity
towards heavier patients has its roots in psychology. We do not blame
them for it. When most of the day is spent with people who are ill, it
is natural to believe that your own lifestyle, height, waistline, etc,
are the right ones, and this subconscious bias could easily affect
statistical data.
When medical opinion agrees with our own, therefore, it is worth
special attention. Professor John Grimley Evans, professor of geriatric
medicine at Oxford University, says that the best recipe for living to a
ripe old age is to be cantankerous. Old folk are much more likely to
live longer, he says, if they demand the best remedies that medicine can
offer. The grumpier patients become, he told a symposium at Newcastle
University, the less likely they are to be fobbed off with inferior
treatment, whereas the ''sweet old folk'' popular with nurses and
doctors just accept what happens to them.
Everyday life appears to support the theory. The Victor Meldrews of
this world may not be more effective than the rest of us, but their
public ragings do seem to be therapeutic. It could be a form of
catharsis, like the curious wellbeing that comes from watching a
Shakespeare tragedy, or an England own goal. The trouble with Professor
Grimley's thesis is that it is easy enough to be grumpy when we are
healthy. It is like taking a car to the garage when there is nothing
wrong with it. With a headache and sore throat, however, as with a
clanking engine, most of us tend to become obsequious and grateful.
There is no telling how doctors might get their revenge on difficult
patients, but it is not worth taking the risk.

ONCE UPON A TIME By John Barth.
Sceptre, #16.99 (pp 398).
IT is easy to get lost in a John Barth fiction. And once you are lost
it is difficult to find your way back, or even to discover where things
went wrong.
This is surely deliberate. He mines the minutiae of his life and
details his career in such a way as to pack the narrative with personal
trifles and reflections on writing. One obviously feeds the other, and
when Barth takes off on an exploratory detraction the text becomes
tangled with visions and possibilities.
Not that we learn as much as the process suggests. There are a number
of no-go areas, but that's fine too, for Barth believes we can never
truly know ourselves. The best we can manage is to strive towards truth
or invent who we are, what we might be, have been, or even could have
been. Truth and fiction are much the same. The story is important; the
personal details he avoids telling are presumably stories waiting to be
told, which begs the question of why he does not tell them.
Much of this would be easier to absorb were not Barth also concerned
with linguistic artifice. A ''Program Note'' exposes the problem
completely. He first makes the mistake of assuring us as the novel ''is
not the story of my life, but is most certainly a story thereof''. Every
life, he tells us later, has ''a Scheherazadesworth of stories''.
The use of words like thereof, aforesung, ergo, and erst, and such
contrivances as Episong and brawlbrat can be hard going, verily
jabberough in places. Language can provide a smokescreen. It can be used
as a distraction or a way of avoiding the issues he occasionally raises
but does not confront.
In a scabrous, self-reference, Once Upon a Time is subtitled A
Floating Opera, the title of a previous Barth novel with the indefinite
article substituted for the definite. The book is divided into sections
headed Overture, Interlude, Act I, Entr'act, and Acts II and III.
The Overture takes up more than a quarter of the book. It tells how
the author and his second wife leave New England for a three-day sail
into Chesapeake Bay and is sub-divided into sections headed Aria, Story,
Duet, and so on. Very little happens, other than what for Barth is a
disaster the reader can barely share, however he tries to describe his
anguish.
He loses his binder and pen, implements he has used every day for
years. This absorption is entirely consonant with a manipulator, a man
who likes to be in control rather than someone who reveals himself for
the exposure or manipulation of others. Beyond concern, his obvious
grief, and attempts to elicit sympathy, he tells us what we need to
know. It was a Parker pen, bought in England.
This opening section is something of an endurance test. The writing is
unnecessarily dense and entirely unstructured. The style later becomes
less sticky and the narrative pace consequently quickens, but anyone who
wants to know about Barth's academic life or the man behind the books,
far less his colleagues, friends, wives, or children, will be left to
wonder the point of this exercise.
Yet there are places where it flares into interest, offering slivers
of gossip and academic pastiches. These moments can be wonderful, when
the clarity of thought and simple directness of language are treasured
for their rarity. Ultimately they do little more than expose the
flabbiness of most of the work.
Irrespective of the writer's theories or intentions, readers must
ultimately ask why their interest and sympathies should be so
shamelessly disregarded. Even a reader as obsessed with Barth as he is
with himself would be forced to scream at him to get on with the bloody
book and leave the introspection and half-baked philosophy alone. If he
has to be so obvious, others may be forced to reflect upon the brevity
of life.

THE SNOWS OF OLYMPUS: A Garden on Mars By Arthur C Clarke. Gollancz,
#17.99 (pp 120)
THE problem with science fiction is that many people mistake it for
predictive literature. It is not written as such. Which is not to say
that there are no tenable predictions to be found within the pages of
the genre. Obviously there are. Everything from lasers to interplanetary
spaceflight was successfully augured in the last century, as were
television, faxes, airliners, and numerous other feats of technical
wizardry.
Generally SF writers do not set about writing exercises in prediction.
Their fictions, when set in the future, tend to be warnings about what
could happen if certain contemporary trends were allowed to run wild.
They tend to be more telling about the concerns of their times than
about possible tomorrows.
Then there is Arthur Clarke.
Quite apart from his fiction, where he has been about as successful a
fortune teller as the average SF writer, Clarke has written a number of
essays on the human race's future in space. He is also the author of the
seminal paper on satellite communications.
These are his true visionary works and the ones which inspired a whole
generation of students to study the aerospace sciences. It is within
this context that we should consider his latest work of non-fiction.
Clarke at 77 is as addicted to personal computers and cyberspace as
any like-minded teenager today. This book is the product of his twin
loves, computers and outer space, in particular about a computer program
for modelling landscapes and about the process of planetary engineering.
The program is Vistapro which allows its user to manipulate landscape
images extensively. Planetary engineering, or terraforming, is the
process of turning another world into a version of good old planet
Earth.
In this case the planet is Mars. By happy chance some of the series of
landscapes which come with Vistapro are based on images of the Red
Planet taken by the Viking space probes of the 1970s. The program allows
the user to change the landscape substantially. This clearly inspired
Clarke to model the changes on Mars that would occur should our
descendants ever decide to make it habitable for humankind.
Much of the book's central section is taken up with Vistapro images of
Mars as it might be. Tucked into the text by Clarke is a sneaky little
disclaimer that these images are all scaled up three times vertically
which really is a bit of a cheat if you've been browsing in the bookshop
and like the looks of this volume. It is pretty but this is not the
visionary inspirational stuff of his prime years, nor should we
realistically expect it to be so.
There are some chapters covering what we know of Mars and the various
plans for expeditions.
In the chapter which deals with the actual terraforming of the planet,
looking at the various options which have been suggested, Clarke comes
up with one of his own. He suggests employing nanotechnology. This is
one of the great promises of the next century, engineering with
sub-microscopic machines which can manipulate individual atoms.
And yet finally the book and even the premise seem unsatisfactory.
There is something about terraforming which smacks of the grand
Victorian engineer, a concept with which Brunel would have been quite
comfortable.
Although Clarke doesn't deal with the motivation behind this titanic
undertaking, the usual reason given is population pressures. Malthus has
a lot to answer for but a total redesign of the fourth planet will
probably not be included. The rate at which human population is
increasing has been dropping off for some time now and, if current
projections hold good, should level off with a population about twice
the present one.
Earth can easily support a human population of that size. There are no
reasons other than the obvious political ones why people should starve
or live in misery today or in the future.
But fixing those problems is a task beside which terraforming Mars
shrinks to insignificance.

ISLES OF HOME: Seventy years of Shetland By Professor Gordon
Donaldson.
Scottish Academic Press, #14.99 (pp 212)
THIS is a sad book; sad in its unfulfilled yearning for a personal
homeland, in its sometimes peevish nostalgia for older, quieter times,
and in the rather faltering, frail tone of its writing. Saddest of all
is the fact that Professor Donaldson died before this revision of his
earlier Isles of Home: Sixty years of Shetland could be published.
Gordon Donaldson was Professor of Scottish History at Edinburgh
University between 1963 and 1979 and authored over 30 books. An
historian of international repute and editor of the massive Edinburgh
History of Scotland, his mind and body may have been devoted to a
mainland career, but his heart was Shetland's. His paternal
grandfather's birth in the islands led to childhood holidays beginning
in 1921, and a further 80 trips north (''all carefully noted'') until
1992.
These visits ranged from summer-long student idylls to fleeting
weekends snatched from the demands of academic life. Shetland seems to
have been a drug to which Donaldson was hopelessly addicted; yet he
never settled there, even in retirement, preferring instead the more
accessible, gentler climes of the West Highlands.
Therein lies this book's central conundrum; it is an obsessive,
occasionally ranting work; allowances for its writer's age
notwithstanding, it is not a Shetlander's book; it is by a
Shetlandophile, a collector of experiences, yet an emotionally involved
one (''I was completely obsessed with anything to do with Shetland'')
whose trainspotter-like devotion to noting down the minutiae of every
visit, the timings of ancient steamers, the make and model of outboard
motors used in the past, signifies an enthusiasm which becomes in the
end wearying.
An entire page is given over to a dissection of the name Donaldson and
an attempt to give it Norse roots, rather than cave in to ''daft
Celtomaniacs who want to claim me as a member of the Clan Donald''; this
is followed by an illustrated, six-generation family tree showing that
Professor Donaldson and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont
-- born in Lerwick of a Shetland mother and southern surgeon father --
share a third cousin, and the lofty announcement that ''I count myself
fortunate that I have no personal relationship with a man who, by
mispronouncing his name, tries to efface his northern ancestry and turns
good Norwegian into bad French.''
One wonders whether a little jealousy of Lamont's much more direct --
and openly acknowledged -- relationship with Shetland and Shetlanders
may have crept in here.
In fact ''daft Celtomaniac'' concerns with transatlantic Gaels' ''the
blood is strong'' ancestral research seems somewhat similar to Professor
Donaldson's determination to prove himself a Norseman and Shetland a
throroughly Scandinavian place. With place names and physical
characteristics wielded in a rather disturbingly cavalier, if not
Viking, manner, Shetland's Scottishness is bypassed in the single-minded
search for Norsemanship.
The book is strong on personal reminiscence and gives a good flavour
of crofting life, particularly on the island of Yell in the 1940s. But
Donaldson's dry detailing of long and frequently tedious boating trips
dwells too much on his own achievements (''I must surely have looked a
competent sort of chap'') and his evident love affair with the little
Shetland Model he had built in 1933 is tempered for the reader by a
truly bizarre attention to what he spent on it.
In six years of ownership he calculates a mileage of 900 (''about two
thirds with the outboard and a third with oars''), and thanks to keeping
''precise notes of expenditure of every kind'', including petrol, an
overall cost of #28 5s 1d, after taking into account the sale of boat
and motor for #14 10s and ''an unexplained discrepancy'' of 2s 2p.
Perhaps this is what makes a good historian of a man.
There are sideswipes at the revolting youth of today's Lerwick and
grumpy comments about the scars left on Shetland's landscape by
quarrying and road improvements. But nowhere is the question most
prominent in the reader's mind answered: if he loved the place so much,
why didn't he settle there, or at least buy a house where he could spend
the summers, instead of these continual flying (though always seaborne)
visits?
Perhaps the answer is all too simple: Gordon Donaldson's Shetland
isn't real. It is a fantasy world of childhood, where everyone is a
Viking at heart and in ancestry and the backbreaking travails of
crofting without proper roads, ferries, electricity, or running water
inculcated a purity of spirit lost to this oil-rich, accessible island
age. Gordon Donaldson's isles were never his home, and perhaps he knew
that if they had been, he would have been unable to celebrate them and
himself in as partial away as he does in the book.
There is no seasickness in Donaldson's travels to and from Shetland, a
matter in which he takes great pride. ''The approach to Shetland by sea
is something that never palls,'' he writes. All I can say, as a
non-Shetlander resident in these frequently infuriating islands, is that
the sea voyage from Aberdeen more often than not appals.

SAINT-EXUPERY: A BIOGRAPHY By Stacy Schiff. Chatto and Windus, #25 (pp
525)
ANTOINE de Saint-Exupery's classic fantasy The Little Prince (1943)
features a child-hero who comes to planet Earth from an asteroid and
meets, in the Sahara, the aviator who tells the tale which ends when the
child-hero vanishes into thin air. Saint-Exupery had been an aviator in
the Sahara but identified not so much with the narrator as with the
Little Prince with the unworldly ability to disappear from this world
whenever he wished. Like the Little Prince, he found life on earth a
losing battle with loneliness.
By a curious coincidence Saint-Exupery, like the Little Prince, also
apparently vanished into thin air. He failed to return after flying on a
mission over France in 1944.
This last flight has fuelled many flights of fantasy. Some say
Saint-Exupery wanted to die and made a suicidal dive into the
Mediterranean. Others say he was shot down by the Germans. Stacy Schiff
suspects he ''went down because of an inhaler problem'', blacking out
because of oxygen deprivation, but is far from certain in the absence of
any evidence.
However, she is sure he died ''a noble death'' for France. His country
officially saluted his sacrifice in 1948, accepting him as the most
famous French man of letters to die in the Second World War.
As an author Saint-Exupery was a high-flyer whose Wind, Sand and Stars
was named the best novel of 1939 by the Academie Franaise and voted the
best non-fiction book of that year by the American Booksellers
Association. Is Wind, Sand and Stars a novel or not? Schiff believes it
is best described as ''a personal essay'' on Saint-Exupery's adventurous
life as an accident-prone pilot in the Sahara and South America. Perhaps
he was an accident-prone pilot in France in 1944.
A high-flyer with a personality as puzzling as his politics -- when he
went missing there were rumours about him delivering his aeroplane to
Vichy and being assassinated by the Gaullists -- Saint-Exupery was born
in 1900 in Lyons to parents from the provincial nobility. His father,
who worked for an insurance company, died when Saint-Exupery was three.
Died after suffering a stroke though Saint-Exupery fantasised that his
father had died of syphilis and feared the disease was hereditary.
Schiff is convinced Saint-Exupery lived anxiously with the death of his
father.
His mother, Schiff asserts, was ''all solicitude and sympathy''. This
is not entirely convincing since Saint-Exupery's mother had a habit of
hitting him. However, she was a talented painter and poet and encouraged
Saint-Exupery to rise artistically above his anxiety. He was a loving
mother's boy who believed his adult life was a long anticlimax.
Writing to his mother as a supposedly mature man he told her of his
emotional immaturity: ''I am not sure I have lived since my childhood''.
Little wonder his most memorable creation was a child, a Little Prince.
Saint-Exupery studied architecture in Paris without much enthusiasm so
his life was uplifted when, in 1921, he persuaded his mother to fund his
training as a pilot. By 1928 he seemed as happy as a sandboy in the
Sahara where he worked as an airfield chief. He was, he explained in a
letter to his mother, content with few worldly possessions.
In 1931, the year his novel Night Flight was published, he married on
the advice of his mother. It was an unhappy union, hardly improved by
Saint-Exupery's search for other women. Schiff excuses his infidelity by
mentioning his all-female childhood and need for creature comforts: ''He
bounced from woman to woman, although not all these relationships were
sexual and some were more notable for re-creating the intimacy he had
known with his sisters.''
Consuelo de Saint-Exupery, understandably exasperated, told her
friends her husband would do anything to get shot of her, even if this
meant courting death in the war. After he disappeared, Consuelo made
embarrassing appearances as a boozy widow wearing a sailor's cap
lettered with the legend ''Saint-Ex''. She died in 1979.
Saint-Exupery survives above all through his story The Little Prince
which has been translated into 80 languages and transformed into a
musical and a movie. By allowing readers to escape, imaginatively, from
the gravity of their earthly existence it has a universal appeal as
Soviet astronomers recognised in 1987 when they named an asteroid
Saint-Exupery. What happened to Saint-Exupery in 1944 no longer matters
for, with an asteroid and Schiff's admirably down-to-earth biography in
his honour, he is a missing person no more.

TALK of a possible bid for another regional electricity company
sparked a flurry of attention in the electricity sector and share prices
rose.
Yorkshire Electricity disclosed yesterday that Swiss Bank Corporation
was in control of 17.2 million shares, representing a stake of more than
8.24%. The news pushed Yorkshire's shares 10p higher to 740p, after
touching 752p earlier.
Yorkshire said it had no indication that the purchase of the stake was
a prelude to an offer for the company.
''We have no evidence to suggest that they are building up a strategic
stake to offer to a third party,'' said a spokesperson for Yorkshire
Electricity.
Various potential bidders have been mentioned including Hanson,
Yorkshire-born Lord Hanson's tobacco-to-mining conglomerate. However,
some City analysts believe that Swiss Bank may have bought the stake to
prevent Yorkshire making a rival offer for Northern Electricity.
Swiss Bank are advisers to Trafalgar House which sparked a wave of
merger speculation among the regional electricity companies when it
announced a #1200m hostile bid for Northern Electricity just over a
fortnight ago. The industry is currently waiting to see if the bid is
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry's regulator, is expected
to deliver his verdict on the deal to the Office of Fair Trading next
week. Aside from the competition issue, the potential shake-up of the
electricity industry has major implications for local economies
throughout England and Wales.
Yorkshire Electricity's regional area encompasses West Yorkshire and
Humberside and parts of North and South Yorkshire, Derbyshire,
Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, and Lancashire. This includes the cities
of Bradford, Hull, Leeds, and Sheffield. The area has a resident
population of 4.4 million which accounts for just under a third of
Yorkshire Electricity's demand.
Of the remainder, just under a quarter goes to the commercial sector
with industrial customers making up the rest. The decline of several
large electricity-using industries in the region adversely affected the
company during the recession but there are now signs of recovery in the
Yorkshire economy, particularly in the textile and metals industries.
Yorkshire Electricity has faced problems with its Homepower electrical
retail joint venture with East Midlands electricity. Costs associated
with sorting out these problems dragged down pre-tax profits last year,
by 5% to #149m.
Earnings per share fell by 4.1% but the dividend was raised by 15% to
23.48p. However, if the figures are adjusted to exclude the
reorganisation costs then underlying profits grew by 20% and earnings
rose by 30%.
In December, Yorkshire reported a 32% increase in interim profits to
#97.6m on 10% higher turnover. The interim dividend was raised by 15% to
9p.
In the light of the strong profits growth, the company announced it
was proposing to offer its shareholders a #188m special dividend. The
pay-out has to be approved at a special meeting on January 13. The
effect of the special dividend is to be offset by a 22-for-25 share
consolidation.
Even if its bid is cleared, Trafalgar does not expect to complete the
takeover before the end of March, when the Government's protective
golden share expires.

THE General, Municipal, and Boilermakers union yesterday signed a
''groundbreaking'' agreement with a leading council contractor in the
first of a series of deals designed to bring improved protection to
60,000 workers.
More than 250,000 former local government manual workers' jobs have
disappeared over the past few years as councils struggle to cope with
reduced Government funding.
A growing amount of work has been transferred to private contractors
as a result of legislation requiring compulsory competitive tendering.
Deals, such as yesterday's with Brophy plc, which has more than 70
national council contracts to maintain parks, gardens, cemeteries, and
sports grounds, are designed to recruit and retain members as their work
is switched from local authority to contractors and possibly even back
to local government control.
They mean full union negotiating rights, with future pay and terms and
conditions guaranteed, and employers ensuring their employees are fully
protected under the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations (TUPE) and the
European Acquired Rights Directive.
Mr Brian Tranter, managing director of Brophy, which has council
contracts worth #22m, said: ''This agreement is the first in the
industry and reflects the need for a change from the confrontation
brought about by competitive tendering to co-operation.''
Mr Mick Graham, the union's national secretary for public services,
said: ''This contract is a recognition of a new relationship between the
GMB and private sector companies providing local government services.''
Similar agreements are due to be signed over the next few weeks with
refuse cleaning contractors, including BET and SITA, and hospital
cleaning contractors ISS and ISS Mediclean.

REMEMBERING MY GOOD FRIENDS: An Autobiography By George Weidenfeld
HarperCollins, #20 (pp 483).
WE went to their intimate wedding dinner where the Thatchers, the
Duchess of York, Miriam Gross, the Metcalfes, Jacob Rothschild and David
Frost were among the guests.
AND that is all we get from the table; the reader is thrown only the
guest list. Much of Lord Weidenfeld's autobiography reads like an
extended society column about the stars of publishing, journalism,
politics, and commerce. He knows everybody but doesn't tell you what he
knows about them.
Where there is text added to the name, it is more often than not a
bouquet of compliments. Kissinger's detractors ''grudge him his
greatness and question his authority as a scholar,'' laments Weidenfeld,
who praises his Congress of Vienna 1815 and tells us about his plans for
subsequent volumes describing how the Congress of 1815 led to ''the
maintenance of a hundred-year peace in Europe''. Earlier in the book he
himself mentioned his school essay about the Franco-Prussian War of
1870-71, but what are a few little wars between friends?
Weidenfeld does not only flatter, he is the soul of dreary discretion.
He has loved many women, but he writes next to nothing about his
marriages or his affairs/friendships. ''Marella (Mrs Agnelli, the
industrial magnate's wife) and I struck up a friendship. Over the years
we have established a pattern of regular meetings. I usually stayed with
her in St Moritz but also in Rome, Turin and Villa Perosa, the Agnelli
estate nearby. Marella's aristocratic features have often been
described, I still think she is one of the greatest beauties I have ever
set eyes on. Though she has a circle of devotees which never changes,
she loves meeting new people . . . invites confidences and gives sound
advice.'' This close friendship could have yielded a fascinating
portrait of the Agnellis, but Weidenfeld won't even tell us what kind of
sound advice Signora Agnelli gives.
In an interview in the Oldie magazine, Weidenfeld dismisses
suggestions that he is like Casanova. If only he were! If only we had a
publisher who would reprint Casanova's masterpiece, which brings to life
a whole epoch, with hundreds of vividly drawn characters. But then
Casanova wrote his memoirs when he was old and forgotten, certain that
if they were ever to be published, it would be long after his death when
everybody he wrote about was gone. There was no point in flattering
anybody or making excuses for himself: he could write the whole truth
and nothing but the truth -- at least the way he remembered it.
Weidenfeld writes the way he rose as a publisher and a figure on the
international social scene, deploying his talent for flattery and saying
almost nothing which could conceivably embarrass or annoy anyone. This
is a pity, because he is a brilliant and gifted man. The first part of
the book, about his parents, his youth in Vienna in the years before the
Anschluss, his escape to England in 1938, the intellectual ferment
around the BBC during the war, his beginnings as a publisher, could
hardly be bettered; it lights up not just the characters but also their
time.
When he stops trying to make a good impression and worrying about
offending somebody, he is first class. Even the compliments which weigh
down this book betray a profound knowledge of people's vanity.
Most importantly, he has lived a rich and interesting life, moving in
several social, political worlds. I would strongly urge him to reread
Casanova and Rousseau. He should start again and write for posthumous
publication. Rank, position, connections, celebrity status, a blameless
image mean nothing in a book: the only thing that counts is being alive
on the page.
There are photographs of Lord Weidenfeld and Very Important People,
but by far the most impressive is the photo of his daughter Laura, her
husband, and their children. By the time those lively children are grown
up this book will be forgotten, but Grandpa Weidenfeld's true
autobiography could run forever. About a hundred pages could be used
from this one.

CELTIC footballer Tony Mowbray's wife Bernadette, who died on New
Year's Day after a five-year battle against cancer, was buried
yesterday.
Family, friends, and Mowbray's Celtic team mates filled St John's
Church in Barrhead for a requiem Mass conducted by parish priest Canon
James O'Connell and attended by Bishop John Mone of Paisley. A group of
Celtic fans also gathered outside the church to pay their respects.
Canon O'Connell gave thanks for the life of Mrs Mowbray, 26, who
married Mowbray nine months ago. He said ''no amount of reasoning''
could take away the sadness caused by her death.
Many mourners were in tears and Mowbray, the 31-year-old defender who
joined Celtic from Middlesbrough in 1991, looked pale and drawn as a
single candle flickered on top of his wife's coffin.
Father Benedict O'Keeffe, the Paisley priest who conducted Tony and
Bernadette's wedding last Easter, also attended the funeral service, and
paid a special tribute in which he said she had borne her illness with
''courage and dignity''.
The couple were due to marry last June but brought forward their
wedding knowing they would have only a few months together after
Bernadette's cancer was diagnosed as terminal. Tony was at her bedside
when she died.
Most of the non-playing staff and several Celtic directors also joined
mourners.
A small crowd watched as the funeral cortege left for St Conval's
Cemetery, Barrhead.
Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner said earlier: ''Everyone at the club is
determined to help Tony pick up the pieces. The players feel terrific
sympathy for him at this time. We're all very close, that's always been
the way at this club. Tony made a big decision to come up here and he
ended up marrying a beautiful girl.
''Her death has happened so quickly, it's devastated everyone. Tony
trained hard and then went home and often had to sit up throughout the
night caring for his wife. The big man has battled through a hard time.
But the whole club is here to help him.''

Winter mountaineering without training is an invitation to tragedy --
but are the climbing teachers themselves properly trained?
SCOTLAND has suffered its first mountain fatality of the year -- an
experienced and well-equipped climber slipping and falling several
hundred feet to his death on Ben Cruachan near Dalmally. Just 48 hours
later two climbers survived an avalanche on 3000ft Meal a Chrasgaidh,
north-west of Dingwall -- one with severe spinal injuries. Winter
climbing in Scotland is a dangerous sport.
But according to mountain safety experts government reluctance to curb
the private commercial sector is making it more dangerous than it need
be for the most vulnerable, inexperienced and often school-age
enthusiasts who are taking to the hills in unprecedented numbers. There
remains, despite heavy pressure from the mountain safety lobby, no
minimum legal standard for the training of those who set themselves up
as experts to teach mountain safety skills, and the Government says a
voluntary code is all that is necessary.
Trainers can, themselves, be untrained, and there is no law against
it. Businessmen with profit in mind and no more knowledge of mountains
than what they have gleaned from a post card are at liberty to set up a
training centre and offer instruction in skills which can mean life or
death.
Almost a quarter of a century ago six teenagers from an Edinburgh
school party died in a blizzard on Cairngorm -- victims of inadequate
training and lack of experience. That tragedy was hailed as a catalyst
for action with MPs recording ''deep concern that such tragedies must be
prevented in future as far as humanly possible''. This winter, 23-years
on from that tragedy, the Government remains unwilling to set a minimum
standard for mountain instructors.
Andy Anderson, director of the Scottish National Sports Centre at
Glenmore Lodge, Aviemore, says: ''Training is not always led by
education but by commercial and tourist pressures -- determined by cost
and not by educational need. There are hundreds of people out there
operating without qualification -- commercially driven. Unfortunately
legislation governing this is reactive.
''In my opinion we need legislation to make it an offence to offer
training in an area in which the person is not qualified and I define
qualified as 'clear evidence of appropriate training commensurate to the
task'.''
Mr Anderson says he expects to see a spate of accidents if there is
severe weather on Scotland's mountains this winter. ''All the evidence
suggests there will be very few from the formal education sector. What
is needed is an accreditation scheme. The government wants it to be
voluntary -- we want it backed up by statute.''
A report prepared for the Mountain Rescue Committee for Scotland shows
that it is the fundamental skills which are lacking. Close examination
of 1304 incidents revealed that 56% involved an error of navigation.
When details were analysed it was found that just three-quarters of
those involved had proper navigational equipment and the other quarter
no navigational kit at all.
Astonishingly, many who did have the necessary equipment to find their
way about the mountains simply did not know how to use it. Following
that revelation one-day seminars are now being run throughout Scotland
with the task of teaching basic navigation skills.
Such simple training is desperately needed in the light of a cultural
change among those allegedly ensuring that young adults are properly
trained to take safely to the rigour and challenge of climbing on
Scotland's winter mountains.
A decade ago virtually every local authority in the land had access to
an outdoor centre. But in Scotland, where outdoor activity is not part
of the educational curriculum, around 40% of the centres able to deliver
training have been lost as a result of economic cut-backs. Private
practitioners, many without any recognised qualification, according to
Andy Anderson at Glenmore Lodge, have filled the vacuum.
Roped mountaineering is now the fastest growing sport in the United
Kingdom, up 43% in just three years, and demand for training outstrips
supply. In 1993 there were more than one million day-visits to Scottish
mountains.
Andy Anderson says: ''General consensus is that we cannot make
mountains safe: they are what they are -- hazardous and dangerous. What
we must do is make the mountaineers safer.''
The best way to ensure that, he says, is for everyone with a training
role to be up to the mark and for training centres to be able to deliver
two key items -- effective management structures and quality staff, with
the benchmark being the possession of a certificate by those who do the
training issued by the relevant governing body of the sport involved.
Meanwhile, as legislation to govern the skills of those who offer
training is rejected by the government, Scotland's winter mountains
remain a dangerous place. The untrained, generally, are those who find
that danger first.

As contractors prepare to start work on the controversial M77
extension the protest campaign is approaching the end of its road.
THE Glasgow South extension to the M77, one of the most controversial
road plans ever proposed in Scotland, will almost certainly go ahead
within the next few weeks. Wimpey Construction could start work on
Monday, the first day of its 98-week contract.
However, the company maintains that it still has design work to
complete. Perhaps wisely, Wimpey is unlikely to telegraph precisely
where and when it will start the physical task because it is anxious to
avoid confrontations with the anti-road protesters, many of whom are
camped Greenham Common-like on the southern edge of Pollok Estate. This,
however, is a vain hope.
The moment the construction crews move in the demonstrators' jungle
drums will beat a muster call and within hours there will be as many as
200 on the scene. Spectacular direct action is predicted and the
Glasgow-based groups have been promised a helping hand from English
activists who were involved in the recent Newbury protest.
The anti-M77 action, even in its death throes, seems set to become the
event of the 1995 campaign calendar. It will be the unseemly and
unpleasant face of environmental protest.
It will also cast a shadow over a campaign which, on the whole, has
been fought bravely and honourably by responsible protest groups with
strongly held beliefs. They have waged a long war -- but now it would
appear to be all over; bar the shouting. The truth is those who want the
M77 extension greatly outnumber those who don't.
It is, after all, the result of a democratic decision. It has even
been the subject of a public inquiry. It will improve the quality of
life for thousands of Glasgow householders. It will increase the
commercial and industrial potential of South-west Scotland, an area
still smarting from one of the worst unemployment rates in the UK. It
may even save lives.
Ironically, Strathclyde Regional Council, which is financing the #53m
project together with the Scottish Office, cites environmental
improvement as the principal reason for the new road, which will start
at the Haggs Castle roundabout and join the A77 at Malletsheugh south of
Newton Mearns. It will, says the local authority, provide great benefits
to traffic relief through residential areas of the South Side of
Glasgow. Routes through Clarkston, Shawlands, and Thornliebank, which at
present share the massive Ayrshire-Glasgow traffic load, will be emptied
at a stroke.
Strathclyde then intends to take advantage of this situation to
improve its public transport system, introducing bus-priority measures
and cutting bus journeys into the city centre by as much as 10 minutes.
This reduction in traffic along the urban routes should also bring
with it a welcome reduction in road accidents. Strathclyde estimates
that in a 30-year period following the opening of the M77, there will be
3690 fewer accidents. The motorway, it says, will be seven times safer
than the existing roads.
The M77 will also result in vastly improved prospects for economic
development in Ayrshire. New roads do not automatically bring new jobs
to an area but the Glasgow South link will make local industry far more
accessible to Glasgow Airport, to the new Euro freight terminal at
Mossend, Lanarkshire, and to the rest of Britain. It is widely
acknowledged that, in terms of roads, Ayrshire is the worst served of
all the areas which have a direct connection to Glasgow. The M77 will
help redress the balance.
Councillor Charles Gordon, chairman of Strathclyde's roads and
transportation committee, has little sympathy for the M77's detractors.
He pointed out yesterday that planning permission had been given in 1989
after a public inquiry and that, until 1990, there had been little
adverse comment.
''Now, late in the day, it has become a cause celebre but it has gone
through every stage of the democratic process and we have a mandate to
build it. A lot of the people who are campaigning against the road would
campaign against any road.
''The council's most recent decision was only a reaffirmation of what
it decided on in April last year before the regional elections and I
don't know of any regional councillor who lost his seat because of the
Ayr road route. The protesters have been very adept at getting attention
for themselves but I don't think they are representative of local public
opinion,'' he said.
For its part, Friends of the Earth (an organisation which campaigned
vigorously and responsibly against the road and does not intend to
participate in any direct action against Wimpey) refused to accept that
it had all but lost the battle.
Dr Richard Dixon, FoE's head of research in Scotland, said: ''We have
expressed our concerns to the Secretary of State and in correspondence
to the council and to the European Union that confirms our view that the
road should have conformed to the EC directive of environmental
assessment. It is Strathclyde's view that it doesn't have to.
''We are now waiting for Europe to take some action on this and we are
hopeful that the EU's environmental directorate will look into it. We
will be pursuing this as hard as we can and we hope that we receive a
judgment that will take the Government to the European Courts.''
While admitting that the wheels of the EU were apt to grind slowly, Dr
Dixon refused to concede that time was against the campaign. He pointed
out that it would take Wimpey 18 months to complete the #53m contract
and that, even if they did so, the FoE would proceed with their case in
the hope that they could achieve a moral victory.

STILL hot on the acquisition trail, Macfarlane Group (Clansman)
yesterday paid #2.2m for a Peterborough company that sells industrial
self-adhesive and film products.
Dalewood Holdings was bought in a deal that comprised #1.4m in cash
and just over #800,000 worth of new Macfarlane shares. Its latest
results showed pre-tax profits of #513,000 in the year to end-September.
''I'm very pleased about the acquisition of Dalewood which sells a
wide range of film, pallet protection, and self-adhesive products for
industrial use,'' Lord Macfarlane, the chairman, said.
''We already have substantial sales of these products through our
packaging distribution companies and the addition of Dalewood will
strengthen our distribution network,'' he added.
A string of good results despite the recession has allowed the
Glasgow-based packaging group to build up a substantial war chest and
only three months ago it bought an Irish moulded plastics company for
#7.7m.
Macfarlane raised its pre-tax profits by almost a third to a record
#7.1m in the first half of its current trading year as the group began
to reap the benefits of the economic recovery.
A cash pile approaching #20m and no borrowings have allowed it to cast
its net wide in the search for acquisitions and the lastest purchase
fits the bill.

As consumer credit reaches new heights Elizabeth Buie examines the
chances of the Treasury cashing in on plastic.
EVEN before Christmas shopping had begun in earnest last year,
consumer credit spending had reached a record level. Bank of England
figures for November, published yesterday, show net non-mortgage lending
at its highest level of #677m.
And figures released by the Credit Card Research Group bear the same
message -- with total spending on credit and debit cards in November at
#4952m, consumers have never used plastic with such enthusiasm.
Increasingly, cheque books and cash are being ignored in favour of
debit cards such as Switch and Delta, credit cards or store cards. The
use of credit cards has grown by 10% a year, while debit card use has
grown by 25% a year, and cards now account for 15% of consumer spending.
But if banks and department stores were preparing to celebrate the
return of strong consumer spending, then reports over the past couple of
days have sent a chill wind through their credit card departments.
Rumours have emerged -- their source unclear -- that Treasury
officials are considering imposing a tax on credit cards.
In non-committal mode, a Treasury spokesman said: ''We can't rule it
out. We can't rule it in. We just don't know at the moment. We are just
getting over the November Budget. We have no comment to make.''
All of which simply spurred Labour to demand that the Chancellor deny
that he was planning to target credit cards as a new means of raising
revenue.
Nevertheless, Treasury officials are thought to have considered, but
decided against, the imposition of a #10 annual levy as one of its
options in the last Budget. With the second tranche of VAT on fuel now
ruled out, albeit other measures may have compensated for this, no-one
can completely discount the possibility that the Government might return
to this. There is always the chance that the rumour has emerged to gauge
public reaction to such a scheme.
Estimates suggest that a credit card tax plan might rake in only #200m
-- chickenfeed in Treasury terms -- but its effect on individual
spending could be quite drastic.
The Irish Government has taxed credit cards for some time and the
Irish experience showed a drastic effect on card issuers as people cut
back on the number of cards they carried.
While some financial commentators claim that the Irish Government is
prepared to tax virtually anything -- even books and newspapers -- and
it should not therefore be taken as a role model for the British
Government, the Irish reaction does provide some useful pointers as to
the likely implications.
If, as happens in Ireland, the tax is imposed annually per card,
people will restrict the number of cards they carry. Such a result would
have serious implications for the Charities Aid Foundation which has
been trying to persuade people to take out charity affinity credit cards
which pay a percentage to a number of charities.
A tax per card rather than per account would penalise family-held
credit cards. Equally, a tax on credit cards only, excluding store or
debit cards, would anger the issuers of cards such as Access and Visa.
''It would have an adverse effect at a time when the economy is
showing signs of getting back into action,'' said a spokeswoman for
Access Brand Ltd.
Credit card issuers will inevitably look back to 1990 when a number of
companies introduced fees.
''Obviously, there was quite a dramatic decline in the number of cards
in issue in Britain as a whole after the boom years. People tended to
have a wallet-full of credit cards and a large number of dormant
accounts, but they disposed of many of them when fees were introduced,''
said the spokeswoman for Access Brand.
Questions also surround how a charge card like American Express would
be treated under such a scheme. Credit card companies argue that AmEx
cards offer a period of from 25 to 36 days free interest, which they
consider a form of credit -- as do debit and store cards, although over
a shorter period.
''There is a very fine dividing line and there could be a number of
anomalies. Do you encourage American companies to gain an advantage over
British companies?'' said the Access Brand spokeswoman.
For many people, however, such a move by the Government would simply
represent yet another tax on earned income -- and a tax on low-income
families.
Mrs Deirdre Hutton, chairman of the Scottish Consumers' Council, said:
''It is quite important to recognise that credit cards are not the
province just of the better-off people. A tax on credit cards is more
likely to be a problem for those on low incomes whose real problem is
lack of capital. They have to use store cards or credit cards to buy
things that are essential -- like a fridge or a stove.''
A spokesman for the Royal Bank of Scotland said: ''We do not believe
the Government will make a move such as this. Frankly it is very much
against customer relations and banks. The economy is still at a
sensitive stage as far as the recovery is concerned. This would be a
backward step in terms of progress on electronic payments. People are
trying to shift away from cheques, and banknotes are going out of
fashion.''

<HEADLINE>Calves exporter and lorry firms fined for cruelty</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980484263</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A MAJOR exporter of calves for the veal trade and two transport firms
yesterday were found guilty of a series of animal cruelty charges.
Albert Hall Farms Ltd, of Manor House Farm, Strensall, York, was fined
a total of #12,000 and ordered to pay costs of #9971.
It had denied charges of animal cruelty and failing to keep records of
journey plans for transporting animals to France without food, water, or
rest periods.
The firm was now trading at a loss because of pressure by activists
against the export trade, North Yorkshire magistrates heard.
Two transport companies were also found guilty by the magistrates and
each fined #1400.
Four of their drivers were found guilty and given conditional
discharges.
The firms and the individuals had denied all the charges.
Geoffrey Hall, 52, managing director of Albert Hall Farms, had denied
causing calves to be transported in a way likely to cause unnecessary
suffering and failing to draw up and keep journey plans for six months.
His business had doubled in five years and the court heard that out of
its #30m annual turnover, #27m came from the export of calves.
Each week, as many as 5000 calves were bought at markets throughout
England and Scotland by Hall's 46 buyers.
They were brought to the firm's headquarters at Strensall for
selection for export or the home market.
The prosecution, brought by North Yorkshire Trading Standards, claimed
the calves were packed into lorries for 37 hours without food, water,
and rest for the 1100-mile journey to south-west France.
The animals, some only seven days old, should have been given rest and
nutrition every 15 hours.
The two transport companies from Retford, Nottinghamshire -- Ken Lane
Transport Ltd, of Corner Farm, Hayten, and Europan Ltd of Southview
Drive, Clarborough -- were found guilty of failing to ensure water,
feed, and rest periods were provided at suitable intervals and of
transporting calves in a way likely to cause unnecessary suffering.
The four drivers -- Peter Raynor, 46, of Clarborough; Michael Garrett,
45, of Warmsworth, Doncaster; Christopher Hagen, 39, of Clarborough; and
George Buttle, 26, of Maltby, South Yorks -- were found guilty of being
in charge of a calf and failing to ensure it was provided with nutrition
and rest.
The RSPCA, which initiated the prosecution after following the
lorries, said last night they were ''delighted'' with the verdicts.

STEFAN Burness celebrated his first birthday with his mother Catherine
yesterday -- and the first year of his life spent in the special
baby-care unit at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee. He weighed only 1lb 6oz
when born 11 weeks premature and already has had six critical
operations. Stefan faces more surgery next week as surgeons try to widen
his airways to help him breathe more easily. Yesterday, his family and
hospital staff were joined by babies who had stayed in the unit, and
their families, for a special party. The festivities marked a double
celebration, as his mother celebrated her 44th birthday on Tuesday. Mrs
Burness, husband Jim, 50, and Stefan's brother Derek, 14, have visited
the hospital constantly. Mrs Burness, of Reform Street, Montrose, said
yesterday: ''I hope Stefan gets home long before his second birthday.
There's been a lot of stress and strain over the last year but the
nurses, doctors, and all the staff at Ninewells have been terrific.''

THE Agriculture Minister, Mr William Waldegrave, insisted yesterday
that the real issue to be addressed by animal rights groups was not
cross-channel transport but the way animals were treated in Europe.
''I think some of the issues are beginning to be clarified in the
public mind,'' he said. ''It isn't so much whether animals can be safely
and humanely transported over a not very wide piece of water. It is the
issue of treatment at the other end -- particularly of calves.''
The use of veal crates for calves was banned in Britain but the
Government could not alter the system in Europe by unilateral action, he
said. That would have to be done by the Council of Ministers.
''Smashing windows here won't change the system over there,'' he
added. ''We must aim at the right target. It would be a terrible
precedent for a legal trade to be interrupted by illegal action,'' he
warned.
Mr Waldegrave claimed that there were ''some very dangerous people''
involved in some of the animal welfare demonstrations. It was, he said,
very unfair to pick solely on British farmers and frustrate their trade,
which would be taken up by someone else with no net gain to animal
welfare.
In his desire to bring pressure to bear on Europe, Mr Waldegrave will
meet some of the ''responsible'' animal welfare groups next week, to
plan a strategy for pressing for a change in European regulations.
''British consumers will, I believe, increasingly like the idea that
their food comes from farms where animals are treated well. If British
farmers are as quick to take up that cause as they were to take up the
environmental cause, they will add a powerful strand to the argument
that home-produced is best produced,'' he told the Oxford Farming
Conference.
Mr Waldegrave suggested that, with increased world competition, it
would make economic sense to persuade home consumers to pay a somewhat
higher price for real improvements in the way animals were treated.

THE relatives of murder victim Rena West are likely to bring the body
back to Scotland for burial, it was revealed yesterday.
As the remains of Rena and her eight-year-old Daughter, Charmaine,
were released by an English coroner, the inquest into the death of
alleged serial killer Frederick West, who was found hanging in his
prison cell on New Year's Day, opened.
The 10-minute hearing was adjourned after Birmingham's deputy coroner
Christopher Ball heard formal evidence of identification from West's
daughter, Mrs Anna-Marie Davis.
The 53-year-old Gloucester builder, who had been charged with
murdering 12 women and children, including his first wife and two of his
daughters, died from cerebral anoxia, a post-mortem examination revealed
earlier this week.
Mr West's body was found by prison guards in his cell at Winson Green
jail, Birmingham, on Sunday.
The remains of Mrs Rena West, formerly Costello before her marriage,
and Charmaine were unearthed in fields at Much Marcle in
Gloucestershire.
She was brought up with her four sisters in Coatbridge, where her
cousin, Ms Annie Graham, 69, said yesterday: ''I'm not sure of any
definite plans but she will probably be buried locally.
''We are all just hoping this will bring this dreadful matter to an
end. Rena has relatives in Edinburgh and Ireland and I think they will
be arranging it all.''
Ms Graham, of Daldowie Street, said: ''I remember seeing Rena working
in the ice cream van that West worked in years ago. But I never spoke to
him.''
She understands that Mrs West may be buried at the Old Monklands
Cemetery, Kirkwood, Coatbridge -- one of the biggest public cemeteries
in Scotland.
Meanwhile, Mrs Davis, Mr West's daughter, confirmed she had identified
the body of her father on Wednesday.
She gave his full name as Frederick Walter Stephen West, who normally
lived at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester.
She confirmed he was 53, and born at the village of Much Marcle in
September 1941. His occupation was a general builder and he was married.
In answer to a question from the coroner, she confirmed that Mr West's
wife was Rosemary West, who was born in November 1954.
Detective Inspector Christopher Pretty told the court that a team of
police officers was carrying out inquiries into Mr West's death.
0 Mr Pretty said Home Office pathologist Dr Peter Acland carried out
an autopsy and gave the cause of death as ''cerebral anoxia by
hanging''.
Police investigating Mr West's death were interviewing fellow
prisoners, prison officers, members of his family, and medical
witnesses, Mr Pretty added.
After hearing police inquiries would take some time, Mr Ball adjourned
the inquest to a date to be fixed.
Outside the court, Mr Pretty said inquiries were ''progressing well'',
with complete co-operation from the prison. He hoped the bulk of police
inquiries could be completed by the end of next week.
Asked about the release of Mr West's body, the officer said that was a
matter for the coroner and for Mr West's family.
A spokesman for the Birmingham coroner's office said: ''The coroner
will release the body to the funeral directors of the family whenever
they wish.
* Lawyers acting for Mrs West have been granted a court ban against
the publication of the alleged ''confessions'' of her husband.
A High Court judge yesterday granted an interim injunction against a
legal clerk -- said to be touting material for sale in a #105,000 deal
-- and against Mirror Group Newspapers.

THE UN Security Council has been told that Yugoslavia is keeping its
word and enforcing a tough embargo on neighbouring Bosnian Serb-held
territories.
The report has been compiled by an international monitoring mission
and it is to be the subject of an important Security Council debate next
week. According to the mission head, Swedish general Bo Pellnas, ''the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has been fulfilling its commitment to
closing this border to the best of its capacity''.
Hours before making his formal pronouncement General Pellnas had been
flown in a Yugoslav military helicopter over the mountains of Montenegro
to observe a police operation which they said had foiled one of the
largest-ever attempted smuggling operations to the Bosnian Serbs.
The Security Council eased sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro in
September after Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic imposed a blockade
on the Bosnian Serbs. He did this after they had refused to endorse the
current peace plan for the republic.
Sanctions on sport and culture were relaxed, Belgrade Airport was
re-opened to international flights and a ferry service between
Montenegro and Italy allowed to resume. The sanctions were initially
suspended for 100 days, a period which expires next Friday.
Although some fuel does ''leak'' across the border, a major source is
the Bosnian Croats. However, General Pellnas dismissed stories that
large amounts of fuel and military equipment are being secretly shipped
to the Bosnian Serbs from Serbia and Montenegro. ''The better the border
is surveyed the more disinformation comes out.'' He said that such
''disinformation'' was spread by governments that wanted to see full
sanctions re-applied on Yugoslavia.
General Pellnas said that, following pressure from his team, 32 minor
roads across the border had been closed with earthwork barriers. At one
such closed road, in the Montenegrin hamlet of Nudo, General Pellnas had
been flown in a Yugoslav military helicopter to survey the end of a
major smuggling operation.
Amid clouds of exhaust fumes, seven lorries laden with motor oils and
cigarettes and 16 petrol tankers struggled to reverse up a narrow
mountain road at the border as Montenegrin police kept watch over the
earthwork barrier they had erected to stop such smuggling. According to
General Pellnas, the trucks and their cargoes, worth some #2m, would be
confiscated.
Local monitoring mission head, former British army officer Stuart
Poucher, said that what appeared to a highly inept smuggling operation
had been foiled on December 30. He said that hoping local sentries would
be the worse for wear or drink, Bosnian Serb bulldozers had charged the
barricade while he believed that a bribe of some #40,000 had also been
proffered. The plan had failed despite the fact that the monitors were
not even present at the time.
Curiously though, just as General Pellnas was watching the trucks back
up, a powerful Montenegrin Mafia baron was spotted doing the same. The
affair did not seem to have soured relations between the Yugoslav army
and the Bosnian Serb military either. After laughing and joking with his
Yugoslav army counterpart a Bosnian Serb commander clambered back over
the earthwork barrier saying: ''Greetings to the brother army.''
While there was no evidence that the Nudo affair was ''set up'' for
the benefit of the monitors just days before the crucial Security
Council debate, it would be rash to rule out the possibility altogether.
General Pellnas insists that the Yugoslav authorities are sincere,
saying that their interest in enforcing the blockade is to have the
crippling economic embargo on their own country lifted.
Diplomatic sources say they believe that, following the Security
Council debate, no more sanctions will be lifted but that the
suspensions already ordered would be prolonged.

THE 55-year-old mother of Glasgow councillor Tommy Sheridan was jailed
yesterday for seven days after refusing to pay a #75 fine imposed for
obstructing the work of a sheriff officer.
Her son was elected to Glasgow District Council while he was in
Saughton Prison, Edinburgh, following a breach of a court interdict. He
described the jailing of his mother Alice as a ''damned disgrace''.
Although Mr Sheridan became well known for his ceaseless campaigning
against the poll tax, his mother Alice was just as active and became
secretary of the Strathclyde Anti Poll Tax Federation.
It was while a sheriff officer was attempting to carry out a poll tax
poinding -- the term for pricing a person's belongings before a warrant
sale -- that Mrs Sheridan, who is also a grandmother, was arrested for
obstructing him in his duties.
She was eventually fined #75 at a court hearing in Greenock and
yesterday she attended a means inquiry court in Glasgow to explain why
she had not paid the fine.
Friends in the court applauded as Mrs Sheridan told the sheriff that
she was refusing to pay on grounds of conscience and added: ''I've
committed no crime.''
The Sheriff told her he had no alternative but to impose the sentence
of seven days imprisonment and she was taken in a police van to Cornton
Vale, Scotland's only prison for women.
With remission, she should be released on Monday morning.
Mr Sheridan said his mother should be released immediately. ''I am
proud of my mum,'' he said. ''She's got the bottle that Scotland's
politicians simply don't have.
''A 55-year-old grandmother has been sent to jail for trying to defend
the poor. I hope the regional councillors are proud of themselves.''
A friend who attended the hearing said that Mrs Sheridan suffered from
angina and glaucoma and that it was inhuman that she should be jailed.

AS with everything in life, there are more questions than answers in
the Department. Mr Roy Baker of Somerset asks: ''What is the longest
word in the English language you can make out of the top line of letter
keys on a typewriter? You can,'' he allows, ''use same letter more than
once.'' The top line is: QWERTYUIOP. The answer is a stoatir.
And there is more to come. How about this. The most popular song, sung
everywhere in the world is what? It is, in fact, Happy Birthday to You,
says somebody calling himself The Prodigal Son. Who wrote the tune? A
clue: it is from the world of Symphonic Music. Here's another: Who wrote
the air for Here Comes the Bride? Another clue. Oscar Wilde said the
composer wasn't as good as he sounded. But what was the tune from?
Yet more. From the same source comes the query about a classic of
popular music. Who wrote the words for Stardust? The tune was written by
Hoagland Carmichael. (This your Dept Editor writes and adds that Eddie
Condon, trombonist and bandleader, attended the same school in Chicago,
an expensive private school, and both of them went to law school at
that: the level of private education among many of the popular music
history greats is considerable.)
Scottish fee-paying schools have, as far as the department knows,
provided only one major world pop composer, BJ and only one major
moothie player. Dear Heavens, do we have to ever go back to the Allan
Glen's? Something in your editor's head says it is Maxwell Parish.
Something else says it is not on. Mr Parish was an illustrator of some
renown. Can anybody out there help us?
Now last week's enquiry was genuinely worrying and when I found out a
bit more I realised why Sean Gallagher of Strathclyde has asked the
question. Why wasn't glass invented earlier? He meant why wasn't it
manufactured earlier? In fact, glass was around as early as 2500BC and
the Arabs used the substance as decorative materials, especially as
mirrors, for centuries. During the Dark Ages, the Arabs had a glass
technology from which the present industry draws even yet. In the
Renaissance, the Venetians organised a quality of glass which has never
been surpassed. The glassmakers of Murano were forbidden to leave,
though they did, and spread glassware throughout Europe. The reason for
the question from Mr Gallagher was the most opaque until the Department
saw through it.
Glass windows kept out the cold -- as double glazing does also to this
day -- and many another industry, from joinery to firewood supply, knew
what would happen with glass windows. They would go out of business.
Windows were even taxed. Glassmakers were transparently getting richer
all the time.
As to Happy Birthday. Mozart wrote it. Wagner wrote Here Comes the
Bride. The Department was told that by a classical buff of a colleague.
It wisnae Michael Tumulty. A pint to Michael if he knows where both airs
are from. No, considering this week, a glass at that.

LABOUR yesterday unveiled a no-nonsense plan to tackle the Government
on three key issues in the coming year.
Tory MPs will be subjected to local campaigns, protest letters, and
petitions as Labour seeks to target rail privatisation, perks and high
salaries paid to those running privatised utilities, and the
Government's plans to withdraw mortgage help for the unemployed.
The strategy was outlined at Westminster yesterday by Mr Gordon Brown,
the Shadow Chancellor, and Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's Social Security
spokesman.
They believe that following the Government's climbdown over VAT on
domestic fuel, it is vulnerable on several fronts, especially since it
is operating on a majority of only 13.
Mr Brown said: ''First we plan to defeat the Government on unfair
perks and salaries in privatised utilities, second we plan to defeat it
over withdrawing mortgage help for the unemployed. And with our plans to
stop the unwanted rail privatisation, we will make fairness a central
issue in 1995 as we expose Tory support for privilege and privatisation
abuse.''
Labour is still smarting from the row over last weekend's U-turn on
its education policy but clearly believes it is in the driving seat and
can maximise pressure on the Tories in the build-up to the next General
Election.
Mr Brown said Labour would ''remind voters in Tory constituencies of
the betrayal of Tory election promises and what they dishonestly failed
to tell the people''.
The campaign will be particularly targeted on marginal constituencies.
Local councils, including many Tory ones, will be invited to pass
resolutions backing Labour's line.
On rail privatisation, Mr Brown echoed the comments made earlier this
week by Mr Henry McLeish, Labour's transport spokesman, that the party's
sights were set on ''shattering'' the plan.
Mr Brown said his transport team would be concentrating heavily on the
issue over the next few months and that he believed the Government was
''very vulnerable indeed'' on it. ''We believe there are a number of
Tory MPs who can be influenced by public opinion,'' Mr Brown added.
On other issues, part of Labour's strategy will be to table amendments
to a number of Government Bills -- the Gas Bill, the Finance Bill, and
the Pensions Bill -- all designed to draw support from potential Tory
rebels and bring the legislation into line with Labour thinking.
On privatised industry, for example, regulators could be given new
powers to cut prices for millions of consumers where they believed
boardroom perks were excessive.
On mortgages, Labour is furious over the plans to cut mortgage help
for people forced on to income support. Under the plan, no-one will be
entitled to help with mortgage interest payments for two months and
people will receive only 50% of their outlay for a further four months.
Mr Dewar said: ''If these plans go through, the loss of a job will for
many lead to the loss of their home.
''Ministers may hope to smuggle this damaging package through as minor
regulations on a quiet parliamentary day -- Labour will see that does
not happen.''
Mr Brown said: ''In the next three months, Tory MPs will be put under
intense pressure in their constituencies and in Parliament. They have a
simple choice -- to support the unfair and dogmatic policies of Mr Major
or support Labour's proposals, which speak for the majority.''

POLICE have interviewed British Gas staff in Inverness and questioned
procedures for recording and dealing with reported gas escapes following
an explosion which destroyed a council house in the town.
This information emerged yesterday in a reply from Mr Mike Kitchen,
service director of British Gas in Scotland, to Inverness MP Sir Russell
Johnston, who believes there has been some sort of cover-up.
A spokesman for Northern Constabulary told The Herald the police would
have interviewed people from the gas board as a matter of course in the
preparation of any report which would be sent to the procurator-fiscal.
He did not wish to expand on that or go into any of the details of
this specific case.
The investigation into the cause of the blast in Bruce Gardens, the
home of Mr and Mrs James Ross, both 82, continued as senior executives
of the company stressed how seriously they were viewing the episode.
On Thursday, Sir Russell faxed a letter to Mr Kitchen, making it clear
that he believed Mr Colin Baillie, the depute rector of Millburn
Academy, Inverness, who insists that he phoned to report a smell of gas
at the house, the home of his wife's uncle and aunt, about 16 hours
before an explosion almost tore it apart. Mr Baillie says he made this
call within hearing of five other people.
Sir Russell told Mr Kitchen: ''I understand that British Gas are
denying that the call was made, as it had not been recorded. I may say
that, even if Mr Baillie had had no witnesses, I would place total
reliance on his word, so it must be that some serious oversight and also
some electronic failure has taken place at your end.''
Sir Russell urged Mr Kitchen to take an immediate personal interest in
this case and, yesterday, Mr Kitchen sent a message to Sir Russell,
assuring him of his close involvement.
''It is a matter of serious concern that we find ourselves in conflict
with Mr Baillie's account of events. Nevertheless, I can confirm that a
prompt and thorough investigation of our records, and interviews with
the staff on duty at our telephone switchboard on the Tuesday in
question, has revealed no trace of a telephone call by Mr Baillie
reporting a gas escape.
''You may be interested to know that the police have also interviewed
the staff on telephone duty and have questioned our procedures for
recording and dealing with reported gas escapes.''
Mr Kitchen said the company was double checking the records and was
undertaking further tests, at the request of the Health and Safety
Executive, on the cooker which exploded.
''I would like to assure you that we have a long-established and very
thorough procedure for receiving gas escape reports, for dealing with
them as a matter of priority, and for maintaining comprehensive reports.
I can also say that the staff and supervisors on duty on the afternoon
in question are experienced in this type of work and were well able to
cope with the workload which is recorded for that day.''
Sir Russell was not persuaded last night. He said of Mr Kitchen's
message: ''Colin Baillie is utterly reliable. There must be some fault
in the recording system and somebody must be trying to cover up.''

LABOUR MPs want a meeting with Scottish Secretary Ian Lang to tell him
theScottish Office's proposed local government financial settlement
could force Lothian Regional Council to cut its services drastically.
Four of the region's nine MPs were told in Edinburgh yesterday that
the council would have to reduce its draft budget for the coming year by
#33.4m to stay within the Government's capping limit.
The four MPs -- Mr Alistair Darling, Edinburgh Central; Mr Nigel
Griffiths, Edinburgh South; Mr Malcolm Chisholm, Leith; and Mr Eric
Clarke, Midlothian -- decided to seek an immediate meeting with Mr Lang
to press him to allow Lothian proper spending on its services.
Mr Darling accused the Government of cynically manipulating the local
authority settlement to gain political benefits. The Government wanted
to scare people by threatening them with huge increases in council tax
at the forthcoming elections for the shadow local authorities.
The Scottish Office said it recognised that the settlement was tight
but also realistic, given the low level of inflation, the need to
control public spending, and the Government's public sector pay policy.

<HEADLINE>Right wingers seek to lead future policy Portillo and Redwood both call for cuts in public spending</HEADLINE>

RIGHT-WING members of the Cabinet last night flexed their muscles over
the future direction of Government policy, with particular attention
paid to public spending.
Employment Secretary Michael Portillo and Welsh Secretary John Redwood
-- both of whom are prominent standard-bearers of the right -- spoke of
the need to cut public spending and to get away from the concept of
''big government''.
Neither would claim that they were challenging Prime Minister John
Major for the leadership of the party, though Mr Portillo's name is in
the frame, but their comments are a clear indication of the shape of
right-wing thinking within Tory ranks.
Mr Redwood, speaking to Conservatives in Winchester, said that getting
a grip on public spending was crucial to Britain's economic success.
''We need to move away from two dangerous but all-pervading myths,''
he said. ''The first is that spending has been cut when overall it has
grown, is growing, and will grow substantially.
''The second is that more public spending is always good, forgetting
that someone's grant increase is another person's tax increase,
forgetting that a public-sector job created may be at the expense of two
private-sector jobs destroyed.
''It is high time the public- spending debate was on the facts and not
the fiction generated by all too professional lobbyists with an interest
in portraying a gloomy view of their own circumstances.
''Politics is about priorities within this spending. The Government is
at the limit of what the nation is prepared to pay. Labour's plans to
spend more are pie in the sky. We need better value for our money and we
also need to ensure that more of the proceeds of future growth find
their way into the pockets of the people.''
Mr Portillo made it clear, in a lecture at Liverpool Cathedral, that
he was against too much Government intervention in people's lives. He
also found time to attack some churchmen who have taken what he
perceives to be a left-wing, collectivist attitude.
He said that, when he was Chief Secretary to the Treasury, he had set
out the ethical basis of restraining public spending and that he felt it
was important that people should understand the principles behind the
Government's policies for public finances.
Mr Portillo said: ''I argued then that the State during the course of
this century had grown enormously decade after decade. I argued it had
grown too large and was in danger of making the people its servant,
rather than serving the people. That is why the party to which I belong
takes the view that government should take as little money as possible
from the citizen.
''High taxes debilitate economic activity, promote inefficiency, and
encourage nepotistic bureaucracy. They rob people of the chance to make
the moral choice to assist others. In a broader sense, over-zealous
intervention by the State undermines personal responsibility.''
On the role of the Church, Mr Portillo said: ''A few in the Church
have sought to respond to materialism and permissiveness by becoming
more secular, tending to indulge where they might have uplifted. Some in
the Church seem to have exchanged individualism for a belief in
collective action, too readily endorsing demands for higher taxes and
more public spending -- exchanging the high ground for the bandwagon.''
The Employment Secretary also strongly defended the monarchy, stating:
''No Head of State commands such respect at home and around the world as
the Queen. Better than any president ever could, she represents
nationhood and continuity.
On the House of Lords, he said it was becoming more, not less
important and that those who said it should be abolished simply did not
understand our parliamentary system.

Washington.
THE striking thing about the first meeting between President Clinton
and the new Republican leaders of Congress was how briskly Newt Gingrich
and his troops are repositioning themselves. That's the polite word:
unkind people would say that they are in full retreat from the most
striking promises that won them the election.
They had trumpeted from the ramparts that they would cut taxes by $200
billion, including a sharp cut in the capital gains tax. It has been a
shibboleth of Republican rhetoric for years, but barely 24 hours into
the new Congress, Mr Gingrich now says that he will not cut taxes more
than he cuts expenditure, and that eliminating the deficit takes
priority.
The Republicans concede, 14 years later, that the policies introduced
after their last great victory, in 1980, were a disaster: they cut taxes
hugely and increased spending, leading to a quadrupling of the national
debt. They promise, now, that they won't make the same mistake.
Which is very good news for the United States and depressing for the
Democrats. It means the Republicans mean to be a responsible government,
introducing sensible reforms and conservative fiscal policies. The
Democrats won't be able to denounce them for hypocrisy and incompetence.
New brooms have a very brief chance to do any serious sweeping. Mr
Clinton failed two years ago, getting bogged down in arguments over gays
in the military and failures in nominating his cabinet. He had promised
to offer a reform of the health care system within 100 days. He finally
produced an unmanageable monstrosity of a proposal a year later -- and
lost it.
Mr Gingrich has promised to get his ''Contract with America'' through
Congress by the summer. He made a good start in the first day's session
on Wednesday by pushing through various measures reforming the way the
House of Representatives does business -- and then adjourned to give his
team time to get ready for the real battle.
The point about taxes is absolutely crucial: Republicans have
campaigned since the 1980 election on the contradictory promises that
they would eliminate the deficit and cut taxes simultaneously.
They have made their pitch much more difficult by proclaiming that
they will not touch the two biggest items in the budget, Social Security
and Medicare, the health-care programme for the elderly.
What is more, they have promised yet more goodies for retired
Americans.
All that was easy when they were in opposition. Now they are the
government, and it is a sign of wisdom that they have immediately
recognised that if they repeat the Reagan follies, and cut taxes without
cutting expenditure, they will drive the country into bankruptcy by the
end of the decade and, no doubt, return the Democrats to power.
Mr Gingrich has appointed a ''deficit hawk', John Kasich, to be
chairman of the House Budget Committee. He wants to cut $400 billion
from government spending over the next five years and to lay his axe to
the most sacred of Republican sacred cows, agricultural subsidies.
Since the Republican leader in the Senate, Bob Dole, is from Kansas
and is therefore a strong supporter of agricultural subsidies, this is
bold indeed.
So here is the shape of things to come: the party leaders in the House
are serious in promising to do something about the deficit, and that
means cutting a great many very popular programmes and welshing on
promises to cut taxes.
They will be opposed by many Republicans, who have no wish to go
before their voters and admit that it is not just poor black people in
ghettos who must pay the price for a reformed government, but
middle-class white people in suburbs, too.
They will also be opposed by all those neo-fascist broadcasters and
preachers who contributed greatly to the Republican victory by
slandering the President and stirring up racial animosity and class
hatred. They will now demand that Mr Gingrich and his friends deliver on
their implicit promise to end all welfare to the undeserving poor and
increase the standard of living of the deserving (ie Republican)
classes.
Evidently, Mr Gingrich knows that he can't have it both ways. Either
he panders to the disaffected by cutting taxes and allowing the deficit
to balloon out of control again, or he takes the unpopular moves the
country needs now, in this brief honeymoon period, in the hope that
rising prosperity will cushion the blow and, ultimately, reward the
party with victory in 1996 and forever after.
It is a gamble, and a measure of the man that he has apparently
decided to take the long view. He has to sell the idea to Senate
Republicans, and he is helped by the fact that Bob Dole is not a
demagogue and, though a Kansas senator and friend of agriculture, also
wants to balance the budget. If the Congressional Republicans stay
united, they may get a good part of their programme through and defy the
loonies, the Pat Robertsons and Rush Limbaughs.
But there is another snag. They can only do it with the help of
President Clinton, and he, of course, has a different agenda. The
Republicans are up against the Constitution. The separation of powers,
the rock upon which Madison and Hamilton built the United States, means
that the President proposes, the Congress disposes --- or, in this case,
vice versa.
Mr Clinton will be only too happy to let the Republicans cut
government programmes dear to the hearts of their own constituencies,
but he will veto any effort to cut programmes the Democrats cherish.
Indeed, Mr Gingrich is about to give him an extra weapon, the line-item
veto which every President since Nixon has demanded.
That means that Mr Clinton will be able to knock out individual items
in spending bills, and be over-ruled only by a two-thirds majorities in
both houses. He will enjoy that.
There is also the intangible consideration that the United States no
longer has a clear national purpose, dealing with the Depression, the
Second World War or the cold war, which tended to consolidate
presidential power between 1930 and 1990. There is less for a President
to do, and more for Congress, in these piping times of peace.
But Mr Clinton also has the economy on his side. The unemployment
figures, announced yerterday, show a further improvement, and though
interest rates will probably go up again, things should continue well
until the election -- and he will be able to blame Congress if taxes are
not cut and crime does not vanish from the streets.
So will gridlock prevail, will the bold Republican promises of change
and reform go the way of the Clinton promises of two years ago? Yes --
unless there is real statesmanship on the part of both the President and
Mr Gingrich, working together to control the right-wing demagogues and
obstructionist Democrats.
In the past two days they have both shown plenty of it but,
unfortunately, their records over the past two years and, in Mr
Gingrich's case, far longer, suggest a quite different outcome.

.
A PENSIONER who was involved in an international ring of travel cheque
forgers was yesterday jailed for 18 months when he appeared at
Haddington Sheriff Court.
Former steel worker, Barry Steele, 65, of Floyd's Lane, Walsall, West
Midlands, cashed #3600 worth of fraudulent cheques at 12 different bank
branches in Lothian in one day.
Steele, who received a percentage of the proceeds for passing the
cheques, was finally caught when a teller in the Royal Bank of Scotland
in Port Seton, East Lothian, spotted one of the cheques did not look
genuine.
She contacted senior bank officials and a security check was run with
Thomas Cook.
The Court was told that when security officials for the travel company
traced the cheque numbers it was found the originals were still held in
the south of France.
Banks in Lothian were warned to be on the look-out for Steele.
He was spotted after having visited branches of the Royal Bank of
Scotland, Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale Bank, and the TSB, in East
Lothian and Midlothian.
Steele admitted defrauding Thomas Cook Travellers Cheques Ltd of #3600
on November 21, last year, while pretending to banks that he was Brian
Turner.
Depute procurator fiscal Joan Arnott said Steele had been involved in
an international ring involved in forging, printing, and distributing
travellers cheques.
When caught by police, he was found to have #149 in cash. The rest of
the money apparently had been given to an accomplice.
Steele told police he had been driven to Scotland by an accomplice.
Defence solicitor Miss Angela Craig said Steele's brother, who also
lived in the West Midlands, had sent a cheque to pay back the #3600.
Passing sentence, Sheriff Alex Eccles said Steele had an appalling
record of crime and dishonesty and had got involved in a carefully
planned and deliberately fraudulent operation.

A YOUNG man wept in court yesterday as he saw a video of himself
carrying out a knife attack.
Daniel Downie, 22, was shown the video minutes before he was to appear
in the dock of the High Court in Glasgow.
He immediately pleaded guilty to slashing his victim four times in the
face and was jailed for six years.
Downie is the first criminal caught by security vidoes since the
cameras were installed in high-rise flats in Greenock.
The man he attacked needed 24 stitches and will be permanently
disfigured, advocate depute Alan Turnbull said.
Downie, of Balfron Road, Greenock, was on probation for a previous
attack when he committed the offence.
He attacked his victim with a knife after a drunken melee outside
flats in Grieve Road, Greenock, last April.
The cameras recorded Downie chasing and slashing his victim and
photographic prints of the attack were pinned up in court.
Defence advocate Bill Dunlop said: ''Downie can remember nothing of
the assault.
''He is distressed and shocked, after seeing the video, that he could
be responsible for such a violent action.''

HEALTH bosses have caused outrage by doubling a top manager's pay to
nearly #100,000 -- and giving nurses #5 gift vouchers for Boots.
More than 5000 staff were handed the vouchers as a reward by
Southampton University Hospitals Trust after it had a record-breaking
first year.
However, chief executive David Moss was given a 100% pay rise for the
trust's success.
He is now the fourth highest paid health chief in the UK.
By comparison, nursing staff in the NHS were given a pay rise of 1.5%.
Mr Moss last night said his rise was justified because he has a very
stressful job.
The 46-year-old father of three said: ''I have a wide range of
responsibilities. I have a very demanding job for which, I admit, I am
quite well paid.''
He added: ''My salary is not out of line within the NHS and it is well
below that paid to people with similar positions in industry.''
A hospital trust spokesman said: ''We are doing very well as a trust
and the board felt they should show a token of their appreciation.
''Of course David Moss earns more money because he is the chief
executive and that is the nature of organisations.
''It is the difference between working for a company and then becoming
a director of it.''
However, Mr Peter Jenks of the health union Unison said the gift
voucher was ''insulting''.
''All the staff are shocked by the disparity. We have nothing against
Mr Moss but I don't think anyone should earn nearly 10 times more than a
nurse.''
Mr Jenks said the trust had the authority to negotiate new pay for
nursing staff.
He said: ''Their hands are not tied. If they want to offer better
wages we are always ready to talk to them. The trust is doing well
because the staff are all meeting their targets.''

AN industrial tribunal has heard how all coach drivers, operating a
service between Glasgow Airport and the city's Buchanan Street bus
station, did not understand the braking system of their vehicles.
Driver Robert Bisset, 29, of Cross Street, Perth, was sacked by the
company, Express Travel Limited, of Liverpool, last March after he
returned from lunch to find his coach -- which he had parked in the
Buchanan Street station -- had rolled forward striking two other buses,
causing #5000 of damage.
A unique feature of the coaches, purchased in 1993, was a small lever
on the dashboard, around which was written: ''When leaving driver's
seat, apply parking brake.''
However, the dashboard brake was not intended for use when the vehicle
was unattended but only as a ''bus-stop brake''.
The tribunal heard that when Mr Bissett had started driving the coach,
he had tried to find out what the lever was for, and had asked several
other employees, without success.
A company director said in evidence that the coaches were ''a little
unusual'' in having the dashboard brake but claimed that all
professional drivers should have been aware that the floor-mounted
handbrake should be used.
In its written judgment, the tribunal said: ''It was for the
respondents to ensure that their drivers were instructed in the use of
the controls of buses . . . they should have been provided with vehicle
handbooks and such training as was necessary to familiarise them fully
with the airport vehicles.
''After the applicant was dismissed, the respondents showed an
awareness of training deficiencies by giving a specific instruction to
airport drivers about the use of the braking sustem.''
The tribunal held that Mr Bissett had been unfairly dismissed and
awarded him #4019 after deducting 25% from the basic award as it found
he had contributed to his dismissal by failing to seek ''authoritative
advice'' on the braking system.

DURING his 1979 gig at the Edinburgh Folk Festival France's godfather
of folk stopped dead in the middle of a piece to demand a sound check,
during which the band ignored the audience. A galling Gaul?
True, Alan Stivell almost single-handedly dragged a dying intrument
from the grave with his Renaissance of the Celtic Harp album in the
early seventies, and consolidated that success with A L'Olympia, now
widely seen as the first folk rock album. Since then, however, his
output has been erratic with a tendency to the bombastic.
So the Celtic Connection question was, would Monsieur Stivell prove
himself one of folk music's abiding ''big guns'' or just another
seventies ''loose cannon''.
The opening flurry from the five-piece band, complete with bass synth
figures and drum bashing, had me fearing the worst.
But each time an arrangement threatened to plod off to Nod Off land,
Stivell would procure the thread, then reaffirm, the melody on his harp
before allowing the band to bring the piece to a close.
This pattern was repeated time and again, the most memorable of which
was a tune from his homeland of Brittany, which he described as a French
My Heart is in the Highlands.
With the harp accompanied by guitar and fiddle, this was an ethereal,
hypnotic piece of breathtaking beauty, and proved Stivell hasn't
suffered over the years.

CONFIRMATION that the Post Office is to close the 350-year-old main
Post Office in Glasgow's George Square, and fears for other offices,
including those in Milngavie and Bellshill, are likely to fuel calls for
further strike action at a meeting in London today.
The Union of Communications Workers is to consider how to follow up
last month's one-day strike at selected offices, in protest at what it
sees as ''back-door privatisation'', with Crown POs increasingly being
replaced by franchises in supermarkets and similar outlets.
Last month's stoppage found mixed support, with the Post Office
describing it as a ''flop'' and the union claiming ''tremendous
support'' in those areas selected for action.
Around 20 Strathclyde offices were closed, with a broadly similar
number kept open mainly by managers. The George Square office was kept
open after managers were moved in from as far afield as Northern Ireland
and Inverness.
Mr Liam Murphy, UCW regional counters representative, said managers
had been informed that George Square was to be replaced by a franchise
in Argyle Street and possible other sites; that Milngavie was being
franchised; and that Safeway had been given planning permission for a
counters franchise at Bellshill.
A Post Office spokeswoman confirmed that a decision had been taken to
close the George Square office and that several city centre sites were
being considered for possible franchises.
The building, which is already being vacated by the Royal Mail and the
Post Office's Strathclyde cash centre, is seen as no longer suitable for
Post Office operations. It has been mooted as the possible location for
the proposed new National Scottish Art Gallery.
The spokeswoman also confirmed that Milngavie was being converted from
a Crown Office to a sub post office, but she said that there were no
plans for changing the status of Bellshill Crown Office.

ALTHOUGH many are familiar with Beethoven's stirring Egmont Overture,
seldom do we get the chance to hear the complete incidental music to
Goethe's epic tragedy. Last night's performance by the Royal SNO
revealed an imaginative score, punctuated by four sublime interludes and
reminiscent of the serenity imbued in Beethoven's opera Fidelio.
Austrian conductor Hans Graf crafted an intelligent interpretation
which yielded passionate playing throughout the ranks with the tentative
exception of the horns who lacked Beethovian vitality. Soprano Susan
Chilcott (replacing an indisposed Christiane Oelze), voiced the two
songs with animation and conviction but I'd question the role of the
narrator Samuel West. Eloquent as he was, this evocative music speaks
for itself.
Earlier Chilcott's terrific coloratura suited perfectly the vocal
gymnastics of Mozart's motet Exultate Jubilate. A sympathetic
accompaniment was provided by a reduced chamber ensemble of strings,
oboes, and horns. A little hesitant to begin with, Chilcott soon relaxed
into a warm and radiant soprano elegantly phrasing the ravishing
ritornelli and building towards a gloriously jubilant final alleluia.
Another rarity served as the opener -- Richard Strauss's compelling
tone poem Macbeth. Sensitive conducting from Graf created a broody and
turbulent atmosphere, perfectly appropriate for the inherent doom of the
Shakespearean thriller. Colourfully orchestrated, the trumpet section
added an exciting edge to the overall texture of this fascinating
miniature.
Pity the attendance was so poor for such an interesting programme.
Unfamiliarity can often produce a fabulous concert. There's another
chance to hear the same programme tonight in Glasgow's Royal Concert
Hall, kick-off 7.30pm.

TWO women were jailed yesterday for an assault on a man who had
refused them a drink.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that Carol Campbell and Elizabeth
Graham, both 25, ambushed their victim outside a bar, smashed a bottle
into his face, slashed him with a Stanley knife, and jumped on his head.
Graham had already been responsible for the death of one man. In June
1990, she stabbed 41-year-old Thomas McAuley in a flat in Plean Street,
Scotstoun, Glasgow, and was jailed for five years for culpable homicide.
However, the court heard yesterday that, during the attack in
September on 20-year-old Frances O'Neill outside a bar in Drumchapel,
Glasgow, Graham hauled her knife-carrying friend off, saving Mr O'Neill
from more serious injury.
Graham, a mother of two, of Drummore Road, Drumchapel, admitted
repeatedly punching and kicking Mr O'Neill on the head and body, and
jumping and stamping on his head.
Lord Morison accepted that she had played a lesser role in the attack
than Campbell and jailed her for a year, backdating sentence to the time
of her arrest in September.
Campbell, of Blackcraig Avenue, Drumchapel, who has one child,
admitted assaulting Mr O'Neill, whose address was given as c/o a police
station, to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement.
She admitted repeatedly striking him on the head and body with a
broken bottle and a Stanley knife blade.
Lord Morison jailed her for four years.
The judge was told that both women were alcoholics but he said the
fact that they were drunk at the time did not lessen the gravity of the
crime.
Earlier, Mr Andrew Lamb, prosecuting, showed Lord Morison photographs
of the knife and bottle wounds on Mr O'Neill's face, thigh, and ankle.
He told the court that the prelude to the attack was an incident in a
bar in Linkwood Drive, Drumchapel, during which the two accused asked Mr
O'Neill's aunt for a drink. He told her to refuse.
Later, as Mr O'Neill was walking out of the public house, he heard his
name being called, turned round, and was attacked. He was left lying on
the ground.
As the two women who both admitted a string of previous convictions
went to jail, a detective involved in the case said: ''You very rarely
see such a vicious assault carried out by two violent women. They were
just like girls from hell.''

A HOSPITAL said last night it regretted sending home a 14-week-old
girl who died hours later of meningitis.
The New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton has also decided to keep all
children under two in the observation unit overnight unless parents
explicitly request otherwise.
Chelsea Greet became the fifth child victim of a form of the disease
in the past two months, when she died in the early hours of Monday.
Her parents, Paula Duffy and Wayne Greet, of Woodcross, Wolverhampton,
issued a joint statement last night with Dr Simon Walford, medical
director of the Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust.
It said Chelsea was admitted to hospital about two weeks before her
death and was seen by at least three specialists. She had blood
poisoning and was also thought to have meningitis.
She was treated, apparently made a good recovery, and was allowed home
from hospital last Thursday.
The antibiotic course continued but her condition deteriorated and her
parents took her back to hospital on Sunday afternoon.
She was admitted to the children's unit observation ward for about
five hours but two doctors decided there were no signs of serious
illness and recommended to the parents that they take her home.
Dr Walford said: ''The hospital regrets the decision to send Chelsea
home. It was a terrible tragedy. The difficulty is to try never to get
it wrong, but that is what happened in this case.
''It was a well-intentioned decision that was a mistake. We
acknowledge that and I think the family has, too.''
Dr Walford said an inquiry was being held into the circumstances that
led to the tragedy and what could be learned from it. The family would
be fully informed of the results.

THE Defence Ministry is trying to recruit Army communications experts,
made redundant only a year ago, to service its top-secret surveillance
network on Cyprus -- at rates approaching half their former pay.
The Ministry is advertising nationally for experienced staff to
maintain and repair one of Europe's most modern digital communications
systems serving the Ayios Nikolaos spy base in the island's Troodos
Mountains.
The base, Britain's major intelligence complex apart from GCHQ at
Cheltenham in England, monitors radio, telephone, and microwave
transmissions throughout the Middle East and southern Russia.
Its antennae can pick up individual telephone conversations thousands
of miles away. Ayios Nikolaos was a prime source of information during
the 1991 Gulf War and remains a key intelligence asset for both the UK
and the United States.
The advertisement, citing ''opportunities'' for experienced
telecommunications technicians and mechanics to work with 259 Signal
Squadron, Cyprus, was published on Thursday in a number of national
newspapers.
It offers salary scales of between #11,000 and #14,900 for
technicians, and between #9600 and #12,100 for mechanics. According to
Army pay scales for the same jobs, senior corporals and sergeants in
skilled and sensitive positions would be paid a minimum of between
#17,300 and #24,400, depending on ability and length of service.
Just over a year ago, about 60 senior telecommunications personnel
serving with the Army's Royal Corps of Signals were made redundant as a
result of the Government's Options for Change defence cost-cutting
exercise.
The advert does not specify former military personnel but a military
source said last night: ''They are looking for ex-Army types who have
not made it in civvy street. This is privatisation by the back door.
With allowances, they are offering about half pay for the same job these
guys were doing in uniform a couple of years ago.
''Despite anything the MoD may say, they will give preference to
people who know the digital system installed just a couple of years ago
on Cyprus.''
The job specification calls for people with experience of ''copper and
fibre-optic cable systems'', knowledge of computers and satellite
telecommunications, a ''proven background'', and a clean driving licence
which covers heavy vehicles.
A Defence Ministry spokesman said yesterday: ''I have no first-hand
knowledge of this advert but it is true we do employ former servicemen
from time to time on short-term contracts where that is appropriate.
''I cannot see a security problem in this case with employing
qualified civilians. All civilians working at sensitive bases are
security vetted beforehand. Look at the Royal Navy, who employ thousands
at dockyards throughout the UK and at Coulport, the weapons storage base
on the Clyde. We have a very high standard of security at all MoD
establishments.''
The main reason Britain maintains a 3000-strong garrison on Cyprus is
to protect its intelligence-gathering capability at Ayios Nikolaos.
The site, a forest of antennae on the western heights of the Troodos
range, is manned by 9 Signals Regiment. The squadron mentioned in the
MoD advert -- 259 -- is a component of that unit which maintains and
repairs electronic links to and from the island.
Cyprus is ideally placed to monitor communications throughout the Arab
world. It is also Britain's listening post on southern Russia, and one
of the main sources of ''sigint'' -- signals intelligence -- on the
conflict in Chechnya.

ACTOR Brian Cox, himself the author of two books, yesterday helped
open the Readiscovery initiative. It is being mounted in the face of
statistics showing that, in three years, reading books has dropped 13%.
Cox returned to his home town of Dundee for the event at Captain
Scott's Antarctic exploration vessel, RRS Discovery.
He said everybody was culpable in an age of television and video, and
called on teachers to set aside time for children to read the classic
stories of Robert Louis Stevenson and Walter Scott.
''I think this is a most important campaign because Scotland has
always been a literate nation. We have a heritage which is almost
unparalleled in giants of writing.''
* Dame Catherine Cookson's historical sagas are the most popular books
in UK libraries, according to Public Lending Right, which pays authors
for books taken out on loan. More than a million copies of her novels
were taken out in 1993-4.
However, the overall number of books borrowed is decreasing -- 244
million in 1993-94 compared with 251 million the previous year.

<RECORDNO>980484288</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE daughter of an accountant told a court yesterday how she came
face-to-face with an American international fraudster alleged to have
masterminded the killing of her father.
Miss Michelle Wilson, 28, said Mr Michael Austin posed as a Mexican
Army colonel called Hector Portillo when she met him in New York five
months before her father David, 47, was shot dead by masked gunmen in
the garage of his luxury home near Chorley, Lancashire.
Mr Austin, 39, of New Jersey, is alleged to have arranged Mr Wilson's
execution after learning he had spoken to police about a multi-million
pound cigarette fraud he had organised.
Miss Wilson, who was held captive in the family's secluded home near
the village of Withnell while her father was shot twice in the head,
told Carlisle Crown Court she had gone to New York with her fiance in
October 1990.
She was carrying #10,000 that Mr Wilson was sending to Mr Austin to
allow a ship supposed to be carrying cigarettes from Miami to Europe to
set sail.
Miss Wilson said Mr Austin had spent a day travelling with her around
banks in New York to change the money into US currency.
She said she spent two or three hours with him and identified him at
an identification parade held in this country last year.
''He always spoke in a Mexican accent, always.''
Mr Austin has pleaded not guilty to murdering Mr Wilson on March 5,
1992, and to conspiracy to murder.
Miss Wilson relived the horror of the night her father was shot by two
professional assassins.
In a statement, she described how she was alone on the family home
when she answered the door to the two hooded gunmen, who demanded to
know where her father was.
She said when she asked what it was all about, one of the men told
her: ''Your dad knows about it. It is about some money a few years ago.
I want to know how he invested it.''
Miss Wilson said: ''I said he had never had any money off anyone and
had never invested anything. They said my dad had been down to London to
see the fraud squad.''
Her statement had gone on to tell how, when her father, mother
Barbara, sister Lisa Marie, 26, and her fiance returned home shortly
before midnight, they were bound and her father was taken to the garage.
They found him there later shot twice in the head, with his hands tied
behind his back.
The Crown alleges that Mr Wilson, who was a middle man in the
worldwide fraud he thought involved contraband cigarettes, was killed
after a bitter disagreement with the man he knew only as Hector
Portillo.
He had agreed to help police after being arrested and discovering the
cigarettes being sold to commodity dealers around the world had never
existed.
The court was told by Mr Henry Globe QC, prosecuting, that Mr Austin,
who, the defence have admitted, agreed he was organising the fraud as
Hector Portillo, was set to make a ''real fortune''.
Mr Wilson had effectively sealed his fate shortly before the murder
when he sent an angry fax message to the American calling him a
''Mexican bastard'' who had ''set him up''.
Mr Globe said Mr Austin had told another middle-man in the fraud that
he would have Mr Wilson killed.
The trial continues.

A DOCTOR, who recovered from major injuries after a road accident just
eighteen months ago, has been seriously injured in an avalanche in the
Highlands.
Locum GP Dr Michael Channon, of Newcastle upon Tyne, is in Raigmore
Hospital in Inverness with severe spinal injuries.
He was caught by the avalanche while near the summit of 3062ft Meall a
Chrasgaidh on Wednesday afternoon.
The 36-year-old doctor and a companion plunged down the mountainside
amongst tonnes of snow, when a cornice -- an overhanging slab of
gale-driven snow -- gave way as they neared the top of the Wester Ross
mountain.
His companion, Mr Graeme Pittillo, 29, a lorry driver from Edinburgh,
was able to scramble clear.
The other members of their party of nine raised the alarm.
Dr Channon was spotted by the crew of a Sea King helicopter, which was
scrambled from RAF Lossiemouth, and he was airlifted to hospital.
He has asked medical staff not to give out details of his condition.
Dr Channon was working on Jura, in the Inner Hebrides, when he was hit
by a car as he tried to save a dog which had run out into the road.
He was told he would never walk again but surprised doctors with his
recovery.
The keen sportsman and charity fundraiser made a five-month charity
cycling tour across Europe with North-east DJ Mark Forrest of
Newcastle's Radio Metro in 1992.
Mr Steve Patton, a close friend from Whitley Bay, Northumberland, said
yesterday: ''This latest accident doesn't surprise me.
''Mike is an active outdoor type. Knowing Mike as I do, I am sure he
will come fighting back.''

WORK is about to start on a major operation to trace thousands of
shipwrecks off Scotland's coast.
However, the object is not to recover treasure but create a rich
source of information about the seafaring past.
On Monday, the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical
Monuments of Scotland will begin logging the wrecks, and other sites of
importance to maritime archaeologists, on a computer database.
It follows a pilot scheme in the Highlands where 500 wrecks were
pinpointed in the past six months.
The project was carried out by Miss Deanna Groom from St Andrew's
University as part of her post-graduate studies there. She will now work
to set up the national record, which will help identify vulnerable
sites.
Miss Groom collected information from around 150 sources, from
coastguards to fishermen's organisations. As well as shipwrecks, the
project logs details of important piers, coastal features, and even fish
traps.
At present, the Highlands has only one wreck protected by legislation
-- the Dartmouth, a Royal Navy ship which sank in 1690.
However, a further 281 wrecks are awaiting inspection and a further
376 are known about but are yet to be located.

VICTIMS of the recent Strathclyde floods should get the same levels of
Government sympathy and help as was meted out to the Queen at the time
of the Windsor Castle fire.
This was the view yesterday of an embittered Strathclyde finance
chairman, Councillor John Mullin, who has written to Scottish Office
Minister Allan Stewart, seeking his help in meeting the #10m bill facing
his council because of the flood damage.
Although the council is hoping that #4m of the bill relating to the
devastated Argyle railway line will be picked up by the railway
authorities, there are fears that the remaining costs of around #6m will
put impossible pressure on council finances, already under severe strain
through Government cutbacks.
Councillor Mullin said: ''I don't believe Mr Stewart fully appreciates
the magnitude of the problem and I'm calling on him to make money
available to meet the real cost of the flood disaster. I think the
Government's lack of activity up until now has been nothing short of
scandalous.''
He contrasted the Government's lack of response with the clear
commitment of Government support to the Queen following the Windsor
Castle fire two years ago. ''I really don't see any difference here,''
Councillor Mullin argued.
''The only difference I can think of is that many of my constituents
in Paisley have lost their only home, not one of their homes. The
Government should show the same degree of sympathy and commitment to
people adversely affected by floods as they did to Her Majesty over the
Windsor Castle fire.''
It was his fervent hope that Mr Stewart, ''fortified by the Christmas
break'', would be in a more compassionate mood towards the flood
victims.

A CIGARETTE not properly stubbed out was the likely cause of a small
fire yesterday at Strathclyde Regional HQ in Glasgow. Scores of office
staff were evacuated as four pump units as well as a turntable and
damage control unit rushed to the scene. Smoke from a small room used by
cleaners spread to a first floor suite of committee rooms and offices
used by senior councillors.
Station officer Jim Fallon said: ''It was a small fire in a cleaners'
storage cupboard, probably caused by a dropped light in a bag of
rubbish. The fire was minimal but it has caused a bit of smoke damage.''

GAMBLER George Duffy backed a loser when he agreed to store drugs to
pay off debts to money lenders, the High Court in Glasgow was told.
Police raided a warehouse where he worked and found drugs worth #14,000
above a false ceiling. When they searched Duffy's home at Crossloan
Terrace, Toryglen, Glasgow, they found drugs worth #530 and #1117 in
cash. Lord Morison ordered all the drugs and the money to be forfeited
and jailed Duffy for four years.

JOHN McCarthy, 21, was jailed for four years at the High Court in
Glasgow yesterday after being found guilty of slashing a man at his own
front door. Jailing him, Lord Coulsfield said that McCarthy's victim
would be scarred for life. McCarthy, of Holmfallhead Road, Linthouse,
Glasgow, was also found guilty of assaulting his victim's teenage son
and a shop owner and other charges. Mr Joseph Moore was slashed on the
face by McCarthy when he opened the door of his home in Burghead Place,
Linthouse. The attacks came after McCarthy claimed Mr Moore's son Joe
insulted his grandmother, the court heard.

TWELVE accused, sitting behind screens of bullet-proof glass in a
specially enlarged courtroom, guarded night and day by more than 100
police. Row upon row of handicapped people in wheelchairs. A giant video
screen in an adjoining hall for members of the public unable to squeeze
into the main court.
Last week, the trial of those responsible for the Furiani football
stadium disaster opened in Bastia. And this being football mad,
gun-running Corsica, no precautions were too much.
Around 8.30pm on May 5, 1992, at Furiani, just outside Bastia,
temporary -- and it seems criminally gerry-built seating erected in
record time for the French football cup semi-final between Sporting Club
de Bastia and Olympique de Marseille -- collapsed.
Half of one of the terraces simply fell apart, tumbling 3000 people
from a height of 30ft into a ghastly tangle of steel scaffolding.
Seventeen fans died and more than 2300, half of them under the age of
25, were injured. Hundreds of the latter, now seriously handicapped, are
only beginning to tackle the grim survival problems of re-education and
finding work.
Simply reading out the names of all the victims in the courtroom took
several hours. And even before the trial could begin to apportion blame,
insurance companies had paid out some #24m to victims.
For a place like impoverished Corsica, with a population of only a
quarter of a million, saddled with high unemployment and rampant crime,
riddled with clannishness and vendetta -- 40 people were murdered last
year -- Furiani was an especially cruel catastrophe.
Preliminary investigations leading up to the trial, expected to last
another three weeks, already have shown that the disaster was caused by
much more than just technical neglect or incompetence. The temporary
terraces may have been shoddily built.
But responsibilities for the building work are multiple, which is why
not only construction company executives but football club directors and
local politicians too are in the dock. Even the local prefect, Henri
Hurand, the official representative of central government in Corsica, is
there, accused of homicide.
The man missing is Jean-Francois Filippi, millionaire businessman and
former chairman of the Bastia club, who took the final decision to erect
temporary seating for 10,000 at Furiani. He was gunned down at point
blank range outside his home last Boxing Day.
One Corsican commented: ''We don't know whether the murder had
anything to do with the Furiani disaster. But Jean-Francois had recently
swopped his Smith &amp; Wesson reolver for an Uzi submachine-gun. When a man
does that in Corsica, it shows he's worried about something''.
Like the rundown city of Marseille just across the water, Corsica
derives immense pride and joy from football. Supporters traditionally
greet wins by firing shotguns in the air and letting off deafening
fireworks.
So everyone moved with great haste when it was announced that the tiny
Sporting Club de Bastia would play the giant Olympique de Marseille in
the French semi-final. Local authorities feared there might be riots if
there were not enough seats to go round.
All of Corisca, it seemed, wanted to watch the match, which was
scheduled for the modest 8700-place Armand Cesari stadium.
During the night, following announcement of the fixture, and without
planning permission, part of the stadium was simply demolished, free of
charge, by a construction company belonging to a former Bastia club
chairman, Francois Vendasi, in order to make way for extra seating.
Several contractors refused the #80,000 contract to build temporary
terraces because of the extremely tight schedule. Jean-Marie Boimond,
director of the Nice company Sud Tribunes, who accepted, managed to
erect three terraces in the space of a week. It was the northern one
which collapsed.
Last week, the Bastia court heard how both local government and
football authorities negelected normal supervision and safety controls
of the temporary seating at Furiani to ensure it was built as quickly as
possible, for as many as possible: even before the terracing was
finished, a request for 10,000 extra tickets was sent to the French
Football Federation.
An independent construction expert told the court that the scaffolding
had been so shoddily built that the risks of an accident were ''100%''.
The miracle, it seems, is that the two other temporary terraces, dashed
off in one week using similar poor scaffolding techniques, actually
stayed up.

Washington, Friday
BOOKS, films and stand-up comics describe American Roman Catholic
sexuality as a procession between the bedroom and the confessional. But
a prominent sociologist says Catholic sex isn't a contradiction in
terms.
Catholics have sex more often, approach sex more playfully and are
more likely to enjoy sex than non-Catholics, concludes the Rev Andrew
Greeley in a new book Sex: The Catholic Experience. The book reviews
survey data from 1989 to 1991 on Americans' sexual behaviour.
In fact, the data suggest those people looking to spend more time
making love than falling asleep watching television on the couch should
consider Catholic spouses.
In one survey of Protestants, more than 60% who were married to
Catholic spouses reported having sex once a week or more. In comparison,
54% of Protestants married to Protestants and 40% of Protestants with
Jewish spouses reported having sex with the same frequency.
Catholics ''may well be repressed,'' Greeley said in an interview.
''The only point in my book is that they are less repressed than
others.''
Greeley, a Roman Catholic priest and senior director of the National
Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, said the findings
will burst a few bubbles. Both those people who desperately want to
believe Catholics suffer from terrible sexual inhibitions and church
officials who continue to warn even married couples of the dangers of
unbridled lust will be offended by the results, Greeley said.
But the new research portrays a US Catholic flock that is more
sexually liberated than other groups.
His findings on married Americans include:
* More than two-thirds of Catholics engage in sex at least once a
week, compared with 56% of non-Catholics.
* Among older persons, half of Catholics aged 55 and older report
having sex at least once a week, compared with 40% of others.
* Catholics also rate higher on ''sexual playfulness'' scales. For
example, 30% of Catholics say they have purchased erotic undergarments
either often or sometimes, compared with 20% of non-Catholics.
Even single Catholics are more sexually active than non-Catholics,
Greeley says. Only a third of single Catholic adults reported being
chaste during the last year, compared with 43% of single Protestants.
Why do Catholics have more sex?
In Greeley's analysis, there are two Catholic traditions: the ''high
tradition'' one learns in schools and the ''popular tradition'' that is
found in the rituals, art, architecture, music, devotions and stories of
ordinary people.
In the popular tradition, which Greeley says ordinary Catholics find
more compelling, transcendence is found in creation. The Eucharist is
God among humans at a family meal. Everything is grace including sex,
Greeley said.
Robert J. Connelly, a philosophy professor at Incarnate Word College
in San Antonio said Greeley's findings make sense.
Catholic liturgies, he said, appeal to the mind and the senses, an
acknowledgement that worship encompasses the total human being.
''That play to the whole person includes the sexual, and that is part
of the Catholic experience,'' he said.--AP.

New Delhi, Friday
THE Indian Government was urged to implement its economic reform ''as
fast as possible'' today by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.
He described the economic liberalisation introduced by the Congress
government under Prime Minister Narasimha Rao as remarkable and already
a very great achievement but there was ''an absolute need'' to develop
resources to help India's poor who have been affected by the changes.
The problem the Indian government faces is that the reforms, while
they have attracted foreign investment and boosted the country's
economy, have not helped India's 300 million poor people as they are
showing their displeasure in state elections.
While trade between Britain and India may have risen by 20% and the
Indo-British Partnership launched last year by Rao and Prime Minister
John Major is a raging success, it has done nothing for the mass of
people.
The policies led to a serious defeat last year in state elections for
Congress, particularly in Rao's own state, and the party faces further
disaster when more polls are held in March.
The resignation of the minister for human resources, Arjun Singh, one
of the party's charismatic figures, in protest at the way the government
has been behaving, also has damaged the prime minister.
Singh denies any wish to challenge Rao, refuses to admit that he is
India's equivalent of Michael Heseltine, but does appear to be angling
for election to the Congress presidency which will be held in June. That
would make him a very influential figure.
He said today: ''We should attempt to see Congress does respond and
become credible to the people of this country. I think that is an
exercise which can be undertaken successfully. Congress must retain its
position at the centre of the political spectrum if the programme is to
be implemented.''
Singh said he supported the programme but it is the way the government
is implementing it of which he is critical.
Hurd, who had talks today with the architect of the reforms, Dr
Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, has warned Indians that if they
fail, foreign confidence will be severely damaged and this will affect
overseas investors.
The Foreign Secretary tends to compare the Indian government's problem
with that faced by his own government's failure to ensure the British
people feel good about what is happening to the UK economy.
The analogy falls down because Britain does not have over half its
population existing at starvation levels who do not benefit in the
initial stages of the introduction of a free market.
The problem facing the Congress leaders is that any attempt to make
the poor feel better would have to be at the expense of the economic
reforms with all that that entails for foreign investment.
Rao can survive bad election results in March but not if Congress
falls into third place in the states. Also, if any changes were made to
the economic reforms and that brought about the finance minister's
resignation, his situation would be untenable.
Britain's interest in India is illustrated by the fact there will be
roughly one ministerial visit a fortnight to New Delhi between now and
March. Hot on Hurd's heels come Richard Needham, Michael Heseltine,
Kenneth Clarke, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Howard -- and Lord Ullswater
has just left.
Hurd said all the visits were within the framework of the partnership
initiative and he hoped India would feel able to continue opening its
markets in insurance and tariff reform, changing its labour laws and
playing a full part in the world trade organisation.
As far as Britain's aid effort is concerned, India is our largest
recipient, and from what he had seen it was money well spent.
He said remarkable things were happening in Asia but none were more
remarkable that what was happening in India.
But the changes must be done with a clear understanding of the needs
of the poor. He had been encouraged by the fact that many political
leaders supported the reforms though they differed on their
implementation in particular cases.
Hurd also urged New Delhi to pay greater respect for human rights in
strife-torn Kashmir and called for an end to foreign support for Muslim
separatists fighting Indian rule.
''There should be a political process in Kashmir and improved regard
for human rights,'' Hurd told a news conference.
He will meet the Indian premier tomorrow and leaves on Sunday for
Islamabad where he will have talks with Pakistan's Premier Benazir
Bhutto.

Tehran, Friday
A PLANE crash killed Iran's air force commander along with four
generals and seven other officers, delivering a severe blow to the
Iranian military.
The plane carrying the commander, Brigadier General Mansour Sattari,
and his senior aides crashed last night when trying to land at Isfahan
in central Iran after developing technical problems, Tehran Radio said
today.
Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Ali Shahbazi told the radio the
officers had taken off in a Lockheed C-140 JetStar from Isfahan's Shahid
Babaei air base for a destination he did not specify.
''The plane developed a technical fault after a short while. They
decided to land in Isfahan again. The plane crashed on the tarmac when
landing,'' Shahbazi said.
All 12 passengers and crew were killed, he added.
''This is a great loss to their co-fighters,'' Shahbazi said.
Asked about the cause of the crash, Shahbazi said an investigation was
launched and he hoped results would be announced soon.
The plane was heading from Isfahan to Tehran, 200 miles to the north,
according to Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati who was delivering a sermon at
Tehran's Friday prayer meeting.
Iran's IRNA news agency named the four brigadier generals killed along
with Sattari as: chief of air force staff Alireza Yassini, deputy
commander for operations Mostafa Ardestani, head of the engineering
department Ahmad Shojaei, and head of the controller department Hassan
Razzaqi.
The other victims were two colonels, a major, a captain and three
lieutenants. Tehran Radio said a funeral was held in Isfahan today.
The incident is the second time since the 1979 Islamic revolution that
Iran's air force chief and senior officers have died in a plane
crash.--Reuter.

Washington, Friday
THE vanquished Democrats gathered today in their last bastion, the
White House, to consider their tactics for the next two years.
The Republicans, who took over Congress on Wednesday, are in the
ascendant, and President Clinton and his colleagues have yet to decide
how to deal with the novel situation.
Their first conclusion was they would not oppose the Republicans'
balanced budget amendment -- provided that the Republicans offered a
plan to balance the budget.
The Democratic leader in the House, Richard Gephardt, said after the
meeting with the president: ''It's not just a phrase, 'balance the
budget'. That's easy. Anybody can say that. What does it mean in
people's lives?''
Committee hearings already have opened in both houses to discuss the
proposal, which might pass this time. It will need a two-thirds'
majority in both houses and must then be approved by three-quarters of
the states.
Amending the Constitution is a lengthy and difficult business, and the
most enthusiastic Republicans do not pretend that the balanced-budget
amendment will all of itself cure the country's ills.
In today's meetings, the Democrats pointed out that the new majority
must come up with specific proposals to eliminate the deficit by 2002,
and that it will be very difficult.
Clinton met Republican leaders yesterday, and the session was
surprisingly cordial. The two sides reached tentative agreement that
there should be no tax cuts that are not balanced by corresponding cuts
in spending, and that eliminating the deficit should take priority.
The president agreed in advance to sign several bills that the
Republicans intend to introduce immediately, including the proposed
line-item veto, a law making Congress subject to civil rights and
environmental legislation and, most important, ending ''states
mandates''.
This has been a source of continuing dispute between Washington and
the states: the Congress has a habit of passing expensive legislation,
and expecting the states to pay for it. The states (which now have a
majority of Republican governors) want this stopped. If Washington
passes a new law, it must pay for it.
Furthermore, if Washington wants to balance the federal budget, it
must not do it by shifting expenditures onto the states.
These two measures are fundamental constitutional reforms, much more
important than the balanced budget amendment which will be full of
exceptions and probably unworkable.
The two sides agreed to try to cooperate on welfare reform, and the
Republicans agreed to examine Democratic proposals to overhaul lobbying,
campaign spending and Congressional ethics laws.
Both President Clinton and the new Speaker, Newt Gingrich, insisted
that a new spirit of bipartisanship reigned in Washington.
The president hopes that he will do as well with a Congress controlled
by the opposition as a series of Republican presidents, from Eisenhower
to Bush, did with Congress controlled by the Democrats.
Democrats in Congress are much less ready to cooperate with the new
majority. They may remember that Republican presidents often ignored
Republican Congressmen to cut deals with Democratic leaders, and hope to
avoid the same fate.
Both sides are preparing for the 1996 elections, when the Republicans
hope to capture the White House and the Democrats hope to recover
Congress. If they think cooperating with the opposition will help in
that objective, they will cooperate.
The present honeymoon period will be devoted to discovering whether
bipartisanship pays.

Sarajevo, Friday
BOSNIA'S president warned the United Nations today that floundering
efforts to shore up a four-month truce would fail unless Serbs and their
allies stopped attacking north-west Bosnia.
The comments from President Alija Izetbegovic followed news that the
UN has asked for another 6000 peacekeeping troops to be sent to Bosnia
to monitor the ceasefire.
Izetbegovic's remarks emphasised the tenuous nature of the latest
truce, which went into effect with the New Year, and linked its fate
with fighting that has continued around Bihac in the northwest.
Meanwhile, UN plans to implement key elements of the truce stumbled
after talks on establishing a demilitarised zone west of Sarajevo broke
down.--Reuter.

Grozny, Fiday
RUSSIA pledged today to press on with its military campaign to smash
resistance in Chechnya and stepped up artillery and mortar fire on
Grozny, the rebel region's capital.
Russian forces shelled the city from outlying positions, setting
residential buildings ablaze, but failed to break the grip of rebel
fighters on the central area.
Large numbers of paratroopers were reported moving towards Grozny,
raising the prospect that Russia planned a major new assault on the
city.
President Boris Yeltsin told Russia's security council, his powerful
inner circle, that he wanted a date set for wrapping up military actions
in Chechnya to clear the way for interior ministry troops to take over
policing operations.
The council later said peace efforts should not be abandoned but that
all attempts at negotiating with the tiny southern region so far had
failed.
''In these conditions, without abandoning efforts to seek a political
settlement, it is vital as soon as possible to overcome armed resistance
and wipe out illegal armed groups in order to restore constitutional
legality,'' the statement said.
In a hint at disorganisation in the operation, it said: ''It is also
important to eliminate a certain lack of coordination between actions of
the military and measures by other ministries and departments to
consolidate the results of these actions.''
The statement made clear there would be no let-up in the military
campaign, despite Yeltsin's order on Wednesday to halt bombing raids on
Grozny and growing domestic and international pressure to halt the
bloody conflict.
In new pressure to end the fighting, US administration officials said
President Clinton had approved a letter to Yeltsin expressing concern
over Chechnya.
Deputy White House press secretary Ginny Terazano did not say Clinton
had sent a message to Yeltsin but told reporters: ''We have expressed at
high levels our concerns about what's going on in Chechnya and trying to
limit the loss of life.''
In The Hague, the Dutch foreign ministry summoned the Russian
ambassador to protest at the use of ''disproportionate'' force in
Chechnya and to call for peace talks.
In Grozny, hundreds of Chechen fighters were roaming the centre in
groups of 30 or 40, despite the heavy shelling. Many residential
buildings were on fire or had been destroyed.
Artillery and mortar fire rained down but there was no sign of close
combat near the centre of the city, which had a population of 400,000
before most of its inhabitants fled.
The presidential palace of Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev remained in
Chechen hands. Dudayev himself was reported by Interfax to be in an
emergency command post in mountains south of Grozny.
In Moscow, Russian deputy prime minister Sergei Shakhrai said Russia's
fate depended on how the crisis was resolved.
''(The crisis) might have reverberations that could erase Russia from
the map as an independent player in world history,'' he wrote in the
government daily newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta.
Yeltsin sent thousands of troops and hundreds of tanks to Chechnya on
December 11. The army launched a tank-led assault to take Grozny on
December 31, but it has met fierce resistance.
Russia's Interfax news agency said at least 256 Russian troops had
been killed in Chechnya by tonight. They included 116 soldiers from the
land forces, 100 paratroopers and 40 interior ministry troops.
Chechen casualties are not known but unofficial reports have put the
combined death tolls in the hundreds or even higher.
The rising death toll is one of the key factors prompting calls for an
end to fighting in the mainly Muslim region of about one million people.
The other is the bombing raids which have killed many civilians and
caused outrage.
Yeltsin said he wanted ''absolutely clear information'' from defence
minister Pavel Grachev on whether the army had complied with the order
to stop bombing Grozny.
''This was announced to the entire world and all of Russia knows about
it but there is information they (the bombings) have not been stopped,''
he said, referring to unconfirmed reports that bombing had not halted.
Interfax quoted a member of the Russian parliament, Aivars Lezdinsh,
as saying a paratroop division was heading for Grozny from a Russian
headquarters at Mozdok, outside Chechnya. A division usually has several
thousand soldiers.--Reuter.

could spend Christmas with her family, was hanged in Changi prison.
She was cremated in the early evening at Mount Vernon crematorium
after a short service attended by her grief-stricken sister and close
friends and well-wishers. Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten said the
British colony had supported a plea for clemency put forward by Britain
and the European Union.

A FORMER guide on the holy island of Iona has been informed that he
will not be reemployed there after he allegedly told a group of visitors
that Jesus was a homosexual.
The Iona Community, which runs Iona Abbey and is responsible for the
volunteer guides, confirmed yesterday that a Scots-Canadian tourist had
complained about the guide's alleged comments in a letter, following a
visit to the island last autumn.
The guide, whose identity has not been revealed, was also alleged to
have told the tour group that Saint Columba, who brought Christianity to
Scotland in the sixth century, was a ''murderer'' and that monks and
nuns on the island had been guilty of sexual impropriety in the Middle
Ages.
Expatriate Scot, Miss Anthea Cammell, from British Columbia in Canada,
complained in an angry letter to the Iona Cathedral Trust, which owns
the religious buildings on the island, saying she was shocked and
disturbed by what she had allegedly heard at the ''ancient centre of
Christianity.''
An investigation was carried out after her complaints were forwarded
to the Iona Community and both the Iona Cathedral Trust and the Rev John
Harvey, leader of the Iona Community, wrote her a letter of apology
stating that the guide had not been authorised to make such comments and
had not been speaking on behalf of the Iona Community.
The guide, who worked at Iona for several weeks last year, had left
the island when the complaints came to light but was later contacted by
the warden of Iona Abbey, the Rev Joanna Anderson, and told that he
would not be re-employed there.
The guide, who was described by an Iona Community official as a
''maverick,'' was not connected with any church organisation. It was not
known how many tour groups he had taken round the abbey.
Iona, which is situated off the west coast of Mull, is the last
resting place of Scottish Kings and former Labour Party leader, Mr John
Smith.
A total of about 120 volunteer guides, including many students, are
employed by the Iona Community during the season from Easter to October.
About 15 to 20 are employed at any one time and usually stay for
several weeks, helping to show some of the 200,000 annual visitors
around the island.
Mr Harvey said yesterday: ''The guide was not saying anything he was
authorised to say by the community. We give them instructions on what to
say to tourists, for example, in terms of background information about
the history of Iona and the various communities such as the Celts and
the Benedictines which have lived there over the years.
''The guide in question obviously decided to embellish the story and
has been pretty foolish about it in my view.
''If he said what he is alleged to have said then I think the woman is
quite justified in being upset.''
He added: ''I would hope that people will take a broad view and
realise that this is a one-off incident which is far outweighed by the
excellent work of the hundreds of youngsters who are part of a big team
of people who support the work of the community.''
Mr Harvey said the guide's alleged comment about Jesus being
homosexual was the product of a ''fertile imagination''.
He believed the claim that Saint Columba was a murderer was linked to
the ''myth'' that, when the saint arrived on Iona in 563, he had one of
his disciples killed and buried in the Druid graveyard there, to turn it
from a Pagan graveyard into a Christian graveyard. Of the alleged
comment about sexual impropriety between nuns and monks in the Middle
Ages, Mr Harvey said this had not been recorded and he believed the
story had been fabricated by the guide.

A HEART surgeon accused of accepting money to help patients queue-jump
an NHS hospital waiting list was last night fighting to clear his name.
West Yorkshire Police were called in to investigate a complaint that
consultant surgeon Unnikrishnan Nair, 48, took money to advance a
patient for heart surgery at Killingbeck Hospital, Leeds.
He has now been suspended on full pay by the NHS trust until fraud
squad investigations have been completed. It is understood that the
investigation follows a complaint by another doctor.
Mr Nair was immediately defended by the Leeds division of the British
Medical Council.
Dr Malikayal Alexander, vice-chairman of the Leeds division, said the
suspension was a ''knee-jerk reaction'' by management to a single
complaint against the surgeon.
Mr Nair vowed to fight to prove his innocence. He said: ''I firmly
deny all the allegations as they are totally untrue. I am sure the
investigations will vindicate me when completed.
''I can make no further comment at this stage.''
Dr Alexander said Mr Nair was a ''completely honourable, decent, and
hardworking man'', and he was 100% convinced he was innocent.
West Yorkshire Police fraud squad confirmed an investigation was in
the early stages but would not say how much money was alleged to be
involved.
Detective Chief Inspector Geoff Davies said: ''We will be talking to
everybody but first of all we will have to start with the hospital
authorities themselves.
''With this type of inquiry, the first thing we have to do is to
establish what is alleged to have taken place, whether it in fact has,
and then we will move on from there.''

A GROUP of football fans cashed in when a Canadian sports lottery
accepted bets on games already completed, a lottery spokesman said
yesterday.
Ontario Pro-line sports lottery paid out $800,000 -- about #370,000 --
in winnings by accepting bets for 90 minutes after the games in Britain
were completed.
''It's a serious situation; we're treating it that way,'' said Don
Pister, a spokesman for the government-run Ontario Lottery Corporation.
The lottery was caught by surprise when the games on January 2 kicked
off early. As a consequence, tickets were still being sold after the
results of the matches were known.
The lottery sold 1940 tickets, with 1690 turning out to be winners.
Normally, the lottery would pay out less than $150,000 in winnings, Mr
Pister said.
He added: ''We are honouring all the winning tickets.''

JOE SLOVO, the South African Communist Party leader who fought
apartheid for decades with bombs, strikes, and shrewd negotiating
skills, died on Friday of bone marrow cancer. He was 68.
The first white admitted to the leadership of the African National
Congress, Slovo died in his sleep at home. President Nelson Mandela had
visited Slovo for 40 minutes on Thursday night and issued the
early-morning announcement of his death.
Slovo -- a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant to South Africa -- was one of
the ANC's most astute political strategists and a confidante of Mandela
in recent years. Slovo was made housing minister in Mandela's
administration to fulfil an ANC promise to build one million houses for
poor blacks over five years.
''The nation mourns the passing of a great South African patriot,''
said Mandela, who with Slovo launched the ANC's sabotage campaign in
1961. ''Joe Slovo dedicated his life to the struggle for justice,
democracy, and freedom in our country.''
In remarks reflecting the white National Party's long antipathy for
the man once billed ''public enemy number one'', Deputy President F W de
Klerk said Slovo had ''proved himself a tough negotiator and . . . a
valuable member of the cabinet''.
Slovo led the ANC's guerrilla wing after the movement decided whites
would never surrender power without a fight. When the ANC committed
itself to peaceful negotiations 30 years later, Slovo devised the
crucial compromise under which the ANC and the National Party, which had
imposed apartheid, would share power in a national-unity government for
five years.
The agreement led to the first all-race elections last April that
ended apartheid and brought victory to the ANC.
Slovo's cancer was first detected during the power-sharing
negotiations. By December, he was seriously ill, appearing at the ANC's
conference gaunt, jaundiced, and with his arm in a sling to accept the
party's top honour -- Isitwalandwe-Seaparankoe (He who wears the
leopard's skin).
Slovo continued to work, though severely weakened in the past two
weeks.
In November, Slovo said in a TV interview that he would die ''with the
satisfaction that I've had a rare experience.
''I've been involved in every phase of our struggle -- in the passive
resistance campaign, the armed struggle, negotiations process, and now
government,''
Slovo's working-class parents emigrated to South Africa when he was
eight. A trade unionist and Communist by age 18, he enlisted to fight in
the Second World War and returned to become a lawyer, gaining the trust
of blacks for defending them in 1950s' political trials, through which
he came to know Mandela.
Slovo married Ruth First, daughter of his party's treasurer, in 1949.
She was killed in 1982 by a parcel bomb in Mozambique, thought to have
been sent by South African security forces. Her story was recounted in
the 1988 movie, A World Apart, based on the memoirs of their daughter,
Shaun Slovo.
A Government ban on attending meetings or being quoted in the press
kept Slovo from being at the historic 1954 meeting at which ANC
activists adopted the Freedom Charter he had help draft. He watched the
meeting through binoculars from a nearby rooftop.
Slovo, Mandela, and 154 others were charged in 1956 with treason for
supporting the charter. When the Government banned the ANC and Communist
Party in 1960, Slovo, Mandela, and others embarked on a sabotage
campaign. After Mandela was arrested, Slovo fled into exile in 1963.
While never abandoning his underlying Marxist beliefs, Slovo in recent
years conceded that he had been blind to the excesses and mistakes of
Communism during the Soviet era.
Apartheid-era police minister Adriaan Vlok praised Slovo on Friday as
''a worthy opponent''.
Slovo is survived by his second wife, Helena, and three daughters.

SEVERAL people were in custody yesterday after major developments in
the police hunt for the killers of mother-of-three, Mrs Amina Khatun.
They were arrested in police operations at Sunderland, Tyne and Wear,
and Darlington, County Durham, during which three houses were searched
by tactical support group and scene-of-crime officers.
The move came as Northumbria detectives stepped up their investigation
into the murder of Mrs Khatun, 24, who was beaten and stabbed to death
at her home in Manor View East, Washington, Tyne and Wear, last Friday
night.
Her three-year-old daughter Hasna has told police how three people, at
least two of them girls, attacked her mother while her father Syed Nurul
Ahmed was at work at a Newcastle tandoori takeaway.
Hasna and her father have been placed under special police protection
amid concerns for their safety.
Detective Superintendent Ian Lynch said on Thursday that he believed
the Bangladeshi community knew more about the murder and appealed at a
news conference for more information to find the killers.
Hasna, who speaks only Bengali, told police during an interview how a
girl came into the house, after which a fight broke out with her mother
and then two other people, at least one of them a girl, joined the
visitor.
Hopes that further information could be coaxed out of Hasna in a
second interview faded because she was too upset and police did not want
to cause her more distress.
However, Mr Lynch disclosed yesterday that, after the first interview,
which took place within 24 hours of the killing, ''a search has resulted
in the recovery of vital evidence, the nature of which I cannot
disclose''.

Isle of Wight
A ROW erupted last night between the head of the prison service in
England and Wales and the Prison Officers Association, in the wake of
the Parkhurst breakout.
Mr Derek Lewis accused the POA of ''obstructing'' the inquiry into the
escape by three prisoners from the top security jail on the Isle of
Wight.
He said: ''There is no question of anything being covered up or swept
under the carpet. What we need to do now is to make sure we get the
facts and we get them fast.
''The action of the POA is simply obstructing that.''
He added: ''I don't think it is a breakdown of relations between
people at the sharp end and those who are responsible for the management
of the prison service.
''It is a very unfortunate intervention by the national executive of
the POA.''
Staff were ''welcome to bring along to any of the interviews a
representative of the POA or a friend. I am very happy there should be a
record of those interviews.
''That is not happening so it is simply obstructing us in getting to
the facts and doing so quickly enough in order to ensure we take any
necessary precautions.''
He said the POA executive should ''advise its members to co-operate
fully into what is an operational inquiry to ensure Parkhurst prison
operates in the way it should be operating''.
Asked if he would consider resignation if the inquiry apportioned
blame to him, he said: ''We shall have to wait and see, but there is no
indication of that nature at present and I am not really prepared, nor
do I think it is helpful, to speculate about that at this stage.''
Mr John Bartell, chairman of the POA, said last night his members at
Parkhurst had been advised to provide full and frank written statements
to the inquiry.
They had also been told to provide, in writing, any elaboration should
it be requested.
It appeared, he said, that the inquiry team was looking for a cosy
question and answer session.
Meanwhile, police last night mounted a close watch on a family who
received a telephone call they believe may have been from Matthew
Williams, one of the three lifers on the run from Parkhurst.
Mrs Norma Jordan, of Birkenhead, Merseyside, received a sinister call
in the early hours yesterday, when the caller said: ''This is Matthew.
Bye-bye.''
Williams, 25, who used to live with his parents opposite Mrs Jordan's
house, fired three crossbow bolts through her window one night in 1989.
The former student -- who was serving five life sentences at Parkhurst
for offences including bomb making, arson, stealing poison, and
possessing gunpowder -- claimed it was because she had been playing
country music too loudly.
Merseyside police said: ''We have not actually confirmed who made the
call but we naturally share her concern and will continue to give her
address and the area regular attention.''
Murderers Keith Rose and Andrew Rodger, a Scot, were also still on the
run last night, three days after their escape.
Opinions here on the Isle of Wight were divided as to whether the
three escapees were still holed up nearby or if they had gone for broke
during the first two hours of their escape and arranged their passage to
the mainland.
Local police, reinforced by a team of 200 officers from the mainland,
were continuing a search of outhouses and holiday homes.

THE reputation of James Shields as a man of quiet dignity and courage,
coupled with a keen sense of civic duty, was never more in evidence than
last November at the Remembrance Day service in George Square.
Already very ill, and fulfilling few civic engagements, the Lord
Provost was determined to play his part in honouring the dead of two
world wars.
More recently, he was deeply upset and disappointed at being unable,
because of a broken hip, to lead the Glasgow council party to Rome for
the elevation of Archbishop Thomas Winning to the College of Cardinals.
There was some consolation for the Lord Provost when Cardinal Winning
returned to Glasgow. His first official engagement was to visit Mr
Shields in Victoria Infirmary.
Sadly, James Shields's elevation to high office was part of a wider
council tragedy.
In the late summer of 1993, he took over as deputy council chairman
following the death of Bailie Charles Brown. Less than a year later, the
death of Lord Provost Robert Innes thrust him into the highest council
office.
Born in 1929 in the Gorbals, Mr Shields attended St Francis Primary
School, but his later education was disrupted by the outbreak of the
Second World War. He went on to become a courts officer before early
retirement.
Mr Shields was a keen member of the City of Glasgow District Labour
Party and served on its executive in his earlier years.
Entering the council in 1984, he held a number of committee positions,
but is best remembered for his spell as chairman of the housing
sub-committee on the private sector.
He saw housing as a vital part of the regeneration of Glasgow and
struggled to effect improvements in the private rented and
owner-occupier sectors, often complaining bitterly about cuts in
Government grants.
Cardinal Winning said last night that he extended his deepest sympathy
to Mrs Shields and to all the Lord Provost's colleagues at Glasgow
District Council.
''From his earliest years, he had a great love for the poor and would
work tirelessly for decent living conditions and to alleviate the plight
of the less well-off. I had a tremendous amount of admiration for him,''
he said.

Ebenezer Erskine assesses the future prospects of one of the Kirk's
remarkable achievers.
IT WAS once said of David Frost that he had ''risen without trace''.
The same might be said of the Reverend Norman Walker Drummond,
Headmaster of Loretto School and National Governor of BBC Scotland. This
remarkable young man is a public servant without parallel, who became a
headmaster without having been a teacher and the boss of BBC Scotland
without any pedigree in broadcasting. He is also a Chaplain to the Queen
without having a parish of his own, another rare and unusual state of
affairs.
What has Norm got which marks him out from the norm and has parachuted
him from being a fresh-faced army chaplain of 25 with the Parachute
Regiment into some of the softer landings which life affords? Engaging
charm, for one thing.
Norman also had the wisdom to marry the daughter of the Marquis of
Ailsa, Lady Elizabeth Kennedy. His post as headmaster came about through
the kindly intervention of the Radio Padre and former Moderator, the
Very Rev Ronnie Selby Wright. Norman had come out of the army aged 30
and was chaplain at Fettes College in Edinburgh when RSW heard on the
public-school grapevine that Loretto was having difficulty in finding
the right headmaster. ''Know just the chap,'' RSW discreetly whispered,
and Norman became Loretto head in 1984.
Ten years later he has announced he is stepping down, not long after
becoming National Governor of the BBC Scotland. This post has previously
been occupied by academics who know very little about broadcasting, and
Norman will bring a vastly increased expertise to the BBC about the army
and the public schools. Unfortunately his experience of the Church of
Scotland is a little limited. We think this a great pity as the charge
of Crathie will probably become vacant around the time that he steps
down from Loretto, and who better to take it on than Norman? With an
aristocrat in the manse kitchen, and a member of Her Majesty's
Ecclesiastical Household in the pulpit, how could they go wrong?
The two previous incumbents (Tom Nicol and Keith Angus) were army
types and Norman's connections with the latter go back to Greenock.
Alas, the Kirk no longer operates the efficient system of patronage
which has stood Norman in good stead so far in his career. Crathie is
linked with Ballater and a vacancy committee will be appointed who will
take the decision.
However, we hear that Norman may be preparing to devote his energies
to his BBC work. He will either have to have private means (the BBC pays
its National Governor about the same as the Kirk pays its ministers) or
get another job. Might we suggest that heading up one of the new water
boards would be a fitting honour for this charismatic churchman who has
already established links with the water industry, having conducted
several baptisms while an army chaplain?
ANOTHER Kirk lad o' pairts (and private means) is the Rev James F
Miller, who held the parishes of Peterhead, Dumbarton (Riverside), and
Dunblane before being called across the Atlantic to Charlotte, USA, just
far enough for his megaphone tones not to be heard in Scotland. We hear
that Jim has moved churches twice and has recently been installed in a
church named Cherry Creek which has a reputation for born-again theology
and whose ministers walk up and down, waving a ''bendy'' Bible as they
preach. This will come as a shock to those who remember Jim Miller as a
scourge of fundamentalists whose own party piece was to imitate in a far
from flattering manner bendy-Bible antics and whose taste in liquor was
somewhat stronger than cherry brandy.
He was to the pulpit what Jerry Lee Lewis was to the piano. However,
perhaps it is more evidence that imitation is the sincerest form of
flattery. Part of the culture of the city in which Cherry Creek is
situated is the ''prayer breakfast'', a ritual which involves
businessmen gathering early in the day for devotions and doughnuts. We
hope that Jim is not tempted to bestow the blessing he invoked on the
island of Shetland a few years back when he was convener of the General
Assembly's Unions and Readjustments Committee (the Kirk's equivalent of
Dr Beeching).
Having dined well on the ferry the night before during the crossing,
and retired to bed without pyjamas, Jim rose from his bunk, pulled back
the curtains of the porthole and bellowed at 100 decibels-plus: ''Good
morning, Shetland!'' The large group of locals who were waiting to greet
passengers on the quayside gazed in incredulity at the naked figure who
had not realised the ship had docked.
It will shock those who knew the swashbuckling Jim in Scotland that
his Christmas letter this year speaks of him as having ''found his
spiritual home'' among the fundamentalists of Cherry Creek, Colorado.
OUR final item concerns the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern,
who found that his spiritual home was not among the fundamentalists of
the Free Presbyterian Church. The latest issue of the FP monthly
magazine has neither forgiven nor forgotten the 1989 affair involving
Lord Mackay's attendance at a requiem mass. The Lord Chancellor has been
at again, attending a service to honour the career of prominent RC Lord
St John of Fawsley, who once called the FPs ''a bunch of bigots''.
The magazine notes: ''Apart from the harm the Lord Chancellor's action
would do to the cause of Protestantism, there is the question, as we see
it, of Sabbath desecration.'' It goes on to declare that had he not put
himself beyond the pale the FP Church, which had the duty of ''watching
for this soul'', could have brought him to heel for this heinous
offence. More in sorrow than in anger, no doubt.

A FARMER who admitted starving his animals to death was sent to prison
for three months yesterday and banned from keeping livestock for life.
The ban was welcomed by cruelty inspectors who visited the farm in
Midlothian and said they found horrifying scenes.
Eighteen sheep were dead from starvation -- four of them stuck in mud
and too weak from hunger to free themselves. Nearby 15 pigs were kept in
appalling conditions in a barn flooded with slurry, excrement, and
urine. Three others were found to be suffering from swine dysentery.
Fifteen calves were weak, listless, and thin from lack of food. Water
from melted snow had flooded an old pit used to bury dead animals and
several decomposing carcasses had floated to the top.
The farmer, Colin Baxter, 42, of Causewood Farm, Kirknewton, was also
fined #200 at Linlithgow Sheriff Court.
Immediately afterwards, outside the court, Superintendent Ron Grant,
head of the inspectorate of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, welcomed the ban and said it was the only way of
protecting the welfare of animals.
Mr Grant, who himself had visited the farm, said he had been horrified
at what he had found. He added: ''I am absolutely delighted that the
sheriff has seen fit to impose a life ban on this man. He was guilty of
extremely serious offences involving large numbers of animals and
anything less than a ban would have been a travesty.''
He said the society believed that a ban was the most effective way of
protecting animals from those who had committed serious animal cruelty
offences and he advocated bans in preference to imprisonment or fines.
''The fact that they can no longer be in charge of animals for the
rest of their lives must be a deterrent to others,'' he said.
The case at Causewood Farm first came to light in February 1993, when,
acting on a tip-off, inspectors paid a visit and found it littered with
almost 100 dead, dying, and neglected animals.
Cattle, calves, and pigs were in overcrowded conditions, without food
or water and standing knee-deep in their own dung. Several lambs had
died of malnutrition and those still alive were extremely weak, said the
SSPCA.
In a report submitted to the procurator-fiscal, the SSPCA stated that
there had been a serious on-going problem relating to animal husbandry,
a lack of general care and attention to the stock, a lack of adequate
nourishing food, and a complete failure to inspect livestock.
Baxter, co-owner at Causewood Farm, had admitted five charges of
causing unnecessary suffering, pain, and distress to his animals, and
one charge of failing to bury carcasses.
When he appeared for sentence yesterday, Sheriff Peter Ballance told
him: ''This is probably the most distressing case I have had to listen
to. It is a horrifying catalogue of cruelty to and suffering by animals.
I would be failing in my duty if I was to impose a ban of anything other
than life.''
At an earlier hearing, a solicitor for Baxter claimed that snow had
cut the animals off and the farmer was unable to cope with the
conditions.
Baxter's brother, Ian, 46, with whom he works the farm, was last month
fined #200 for failing to bury the carcasses.
Last night, Mr Les Ward, director of Advocates for Animals, said any
farmer who treated his animals in such a way did not deserve to be
allowed to have animals in his care.
He added that the prison sentence also showed that, at long last, the
courts were starting to take animal cruelty seriously.
Mr George Lyon, convener of the Scottish NFU's Animal Health and
Welfare Group, said: ''The union fully supports enforcement of the
legislation aimed at ensuring the welfare of farm animals.
''Scottish farmers have a high reputation for good stockmanship and
reported incidents about cruelty or neglect of farm animals, although
rare, are nevertheless unwelcome. Scottish farmers, through support for
the Farm Assured Scotch Livestock Scheme, are committed to the
production of livestock in ways in which the consumer can have absolute
confidence.''

NOT only did he invent a whole new language, Franglais, but Miles
Kington -- a regular performer at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe -- is
also a columnist and broadcaster of note; currently hosting a monthly
series called Reading Music on Radio 2 (the first Saturday of every
month). He clearly had fun pondering his Fantasy Filmhouse fare.
''First off is Some Like It Hot. Why? Because it's one of the funniest
and best films ever made, and I've seen it at least a dozen times. Jack
Lemmon was never sexier and Marilyn Monroe was never funnier. There was
a time when I knew the script off by heart. Which is easier than it
sounds, because the script was issued at the time in paperback. Can you
imagine any modern film having a good enough script to come out in
paperback? I still quote from it, often without realising it. The other
day my wife said something bossy to me, and I said, without thinking:
'That's good -- I like them big and sassy'. Just as she was about to hit
me, I pointed out that this was actually a line from my favourite film,
albeit not a very good one. She saw the point. Then she hit me.
''A Bout de Souffle (aka Breathless) I saw when I was a teenager
desperately wanting to be glamorous and attract glamorous girls, and the
film contained the very glamorous Jean-Paul Belmondo who attracted the
glamorous Jean Seberg, so I fell in love with both of them. I'd like to
see it again and relive my youth.
''Key Largo I'd like to see because I'd like to have at least one film
with Bogart and Bacall, and because it also has terrific rainstorms,
some of the best ever filmed. I also once heard on the radio Sarah
Vaughan singing the title theme and it was electrifying, raising little
hairs on places I didn't know had little hairs. Funny thing is, I can't
remember any music in the film, another good reason for seeing it.
''Marx Brothers Go West I'd like to see because I haven't seen it for
years, and can only remember the opening, when Groucho arrives from a
train, followed by a gang of porters carrying his luggage and waiting
for a tip. 'Got change for a dime?' he asks. They shake their heads.
'Keep the luggage,' he says grandly, and walks away. I think the rest of
the film is funny, too.
''As for my fantasy film, I'd like to have all Richard Gere's films
remade with someone else playing his role.''

Paul Young knows where the auction is -- and the power of good it
could do anglers everywhere.
I BID you and yours a hundred thousand welcomes to this New Year. Mind
you, I have got bidding on the brain at the moment. No, I didn't get a
Teach Yourself Bridge book for Christmas; but yes, I did get a copy of
the lots up for auction on behalf of the Atlantic Salmon Trust.
If you have ever fancied a day on the Almondmouth beat of the Tay in
September or Cortachy Castle on the River South Esk in the same month or
yearned to fish the Duke of Roxburghe's Lower Floors beat in February
for the springers, here is your chance. There are opportunities to fish
the A to Y of waters in Scotland, England, Ireland, Wales, and Russia.
From Alness and Annan by way of Brora, Camel and Fowey, the Dove, the
Ewe and the Exe, the Itchen, the Jokenga near Murmansk in the Kola
Peninsula, the Mole, the Ness, the Polly, the Spey, the Teifi and the
Test, the Usk, the Wye and the Wylye, and the Ythan.
Fishings on these and many more waters have been donated by
proprietors to raise money for the Atlantic Salmon Trust to further
research into salmon stocks and continue the buy-out of the Greenland
and Faroese fisheries. It is perhaps no coincidence that in 1994, many
rivers had their best season for some years, with more big fish,
possibly as a result of Orri Vigfusson's initiative to buy out those
fisheries. The initial estimate was that more than 20,000 multi-sea
winter fish might return, many to Scottish rivers.
In this auction, you have the chance to get on to waters of which you
might only previously have dreamed. Okay, some of them are expensive,
but that is market forces for you. I have always believed that it is
better to save for a day on a great bit of water than to fritter the
loot on several days on less productive beats.
We have all spent a few quid on that supposedly ''special'' day, only
to find that it is the wrong time of year, or the river is low and there
are no fish in the water. Bidding in this auction is not cheap, but if
you rake through the fishing on offer, I'm sure there is something for
everyone and the money all goes to a good cause.
Salmon and sea trout, brown and rainbow, even grayling fishing on the
Dove below the Izaak Walton Hotel in Derbyshire, is there for the angler
who would like to get a toe in the door of places hitherto thought
unattainable. Not only that, many of the beats are suitable for disabled
fishermen, all of them clearly marked in the catalogue.
So what delights can we make our bid for, apart from the
aforementioned? Well, I've never sampled the delights of chalk-stream
trout fishing, but if I happened to be in Hampshire in May or June, I
would relish the prospect of a couple of rods on the Upper Itchen near
Arlesford, fishing dry fly and upstream nymph for bids around #100.
Fancy fishing Garynahine Estate and the River Blackwater on the Isle
of Lewis with four pals and your respective wives this June? Well, you
can stay at the lodge, try for salmon on the river and trout in a
variety of lochs, and relax in the knowledge that the cook will have the
tea ready as you come off the water. At offers over #200 a week per
head, it is cheaper than Spain and more fun.
And how's this for optimism? The successful bidder, and angling
companion for the two days between October 2 and 7 on the Esslemont
Water of the Ythan may keep the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, and tenth
salmon and all trout. The two days for two anglers are estimated to cost
#75 -- #18.50 a rod per day. Bid #20 and it could be yours.
There are many more interesting fishings on offer . . . the proceeds
from those on the Tweed and the Wye going to the Tweed Foundation and
the Wye Owners' Association respectively to enhance fishings on those
rivers.
It is a worthwhile occasion, giving anglers a chance to fish waters
with which they might not be familiar and at the same time helping the
Atlantic Salmon Trust to continue with its good work. I urge you to
support this auction. Who knows, you might have a day to remember.
* The catalogue is available from  The Atlantic Salmon Trust, Moulin,
Pitlochry, Perthshire PH16 5JQ. Tel: 01796 473439. Fax: 01796 473554.

IN MIDWINTER 1938 ''there rose a cloud of birds to winkle against the
sky until it joined the ever-deepening stipple of their fellows on the
next highest mound . . . knots all in grey livery, short of leg and
bill, but round of belly as the altarmen who prized them above all else
at their feasts of old''. So the bird artist Eric Ennion painted in
words a high tide roost of knots.
On the Wash in August, still in breeding pink, and at Morecambe in
March, fattening up for the journey north, tens of thousands of knot
pack together in a twitching carpet on safe patches of shore, late
arrivals landing on the backs of others. After a brief peace at full
tide they rise to billow on the winter sky, glinting white as they turn
like a single bird, flying so close that the lower birds in a dipping
flock tumble briefly in the sea. Only at Skinflats on the inner Forth
and Southerness on the Solway we can see such spectacles, but smaller
flocks can be found on most of our December shores.
Scottish knots are most numerous in midwinter. As a child in Fife I
remember them from Boxing Day beach walks (as I remember cutting
Ennion's pictures from the Shell adverts). May their descendants enliven
your midwinters too.

Malcolm McDougall looks forward to the arrival of a Korean People
Carrier field which aims to stand out from the crowds in the supermarket
car-park.
IN THE immortal words of Mark Twain, rumours relating to the death of
the trendy 4x4 jeep appear to be an exaggeration. For, despite a
possible diversion in the direction of the new breed of People Carrier
vehicles from a host of manufacturers over the next few years, the jeep,
albeit in a slightly less intimidating form, is still alive and kicking
for sales from motorists seeking the image that a high and mighty
off-roader happens to give you.
Waiting in the wings to boost the competition further in the
over-subscribed heavyweight arena is a real tongue-twister from Korea
going under the unlikely name of SsangYong Musso. Founded in 1939 as a
small handicraft business, SsangYong -- it means ''twin dragons'' in
Korean -- is now concentrating its investment in the three main areas of
cement, oil-refining, and automobiles.
By the spring the UK will be able to sample the ability of the company
so far as the wheeled enterprise is concerned with the arrival of the
mighty Musso. Launched at the recent British Motor Show, the newcomer to
the trendy jeep set has chosen to follow a different route to market.
Instead of the outdated technology and ''borrowed'' designs that have
come to be expected of young manufacturers, especially Korean, SsangYong
has cleverly cornered the services of Mercedes-Benz for providing power,
and an unusual body penned by a Briton who clearly knows a thing or two
about design.
The result is a fresh and extremely competent 4x4 to be aimed directly
at customers requiring a vehicle capable of occasional ''rough road''
use, but with all the comfort and luxury of an executive saloon to boot.
Pitched unashamedly at established four-wheel-drive contenders
including the Ford Maverick/Nissan Terrano, Vauxhall Frontera,
Land-Rover Discovery, Jeep Cherokee, and Toyota 4 Runner, SsangYong's
clear objective from the outset has been to come up with a 4x4 that can
more than compete in terms of quality and ability.
''SsangYong's approach to the car market is refreshing,'' claims Ed
Swatman, managing director of International Motors, the West
Bromwich-based company importing the new jeep. ''It has rejected the
easy route of producing clones of other manufacturers' vehicles, and
instead conceived an entirely original design. This is a healthy and
courageous philosophy that bodes well for the future.''
Credit for the design goes to Ken Greenley, course director of
Transportation Design at London's Royal College of Art, and the man
responsible for the widely-acclaimed mid-engined Panther Solo sports
car, which was sold along with the company to SsangYong in 1988.
Greenley's unique approach was to match traditional off-road styling
with ''station wagon'' characteristics to provide the Musso with its own
distinctive personality.
Claimed to have one of the best load areas in its class, the Musso is
comfortably appointed to provide an air of luxury and refinement not
normally associated with the farmyard or supermarket car-park.
At launch, the Musso will be available with a highly flexible
five-cylinder diesel engine, thanks to the German connection with
Mercedes on the project. A 3.2 litre petrol engine is promised at a
later date.
The Korean collaboration with Mercedes to gain access to proven
engines has worked in reverse, giving the German giant a 5% equity stake
in the company and a stronger competitive profile in the booming Asia
Pacific markets.
Likely to be marketed in the UK via existing Subaru and Isuzu
dealerships, no firm pricing has yet been fixed for the Musso. But there
are strong hints that this, the forerunner of a flood from the Korean
manufacturer, will offer exceptional value-for-money motoring, with a
price band of between #16,000 and #21,000 on the cards.
All versions will get tinted glass, power steering, tilt-adjustable
steering, and an engine immobiliser, while top-of-the range versions run
to air-conditioning, anti-lock brakes, and all-electric windows,
mirrors, and sunroof. Confident of a build quality now exceeding that of
the Japanese, all Mussos will carry a 60,000-mile warranty and
anti-corrosion cover for six years.
''The launch of any new marque requires careful building of brand
awareness and with SsangYong we are starting from scratch,'' admits
Swatman. ''However, this is nothing new to the I M Group, as our track
record with Isuzu and Subaru demonstrates.''
Clearly gearing up to become a major force in the world motor industry
like fellow-Korean Hyundai, SsangYong has experienced meteoric growth
over a relatively short period of time. From its simple handicraft days
it now employs 25,000 people in 52 subsidiaries world-wide.
The Motor Company sector of SsangYong has emerged as one of the most
important elements of the growing group, with ambitious plans for car
production to follow in the wake of the jeep by 1996.
Based at Songtan, south of Seoul, the company has produced the Musso
in collabration with Mercedes for the home market since last year.
Vehicle output is expected to reach 150,000 within the next two years.
By 2000, SsangYong plans to have a total production capacity of 300,000.

GRAMPIAN Regional Council last night delayed plans to send out 3000
letters to staff detailing voluntary severance terms.
The decision followed a meeting between officials and union
representatives which ended in deadlock.
Last month, the council decided to offer packages, primarily to the
over-50s among their 23,000 employees, as part of their plan to reduce
their budget for next year by #30m.
It anticipates as many as 500 staff could go as a result of the offer.
After yesterday's meeting, the first between the council officials and
the unions since the plan was approved, it was agreed to postpone the
sending out of the letters, which were scheduled to have been posted
last night.
The letters indicated applications for voluntary severance had to be
returned by January 16.

A THREATENED strike at a German-owned factory in Stirlingshire has
been postponed. Its purpose was to protect the right of workers to a
traditional New Year holiday.
The Transport and General Workers union had been calling for a
fortnight's all-out strike from this morning by its 250 members at the
Caberboard chipboard factory in Cowie.
The shop stewards' convener, Mr Robert Sneddon, said yesterday that he
had been ordered by senior union officials to call off the action
pending a meeting on Monday.
Mr Sneddon said that although members had voted five to one in a
postal ballot in favour of strike action, a handful who were unhappy at
taking part in a long strike had been bombarding full-time officials
with protests.
The workers staged a two-day strike last weekend in protest at being
ordered to work over the New Year holiday. They had planned the further
action after being told that next winter they would be expected to work
both Christmas and New Year.
Last weekend's strike was the first at Caberboard since it was taken
over by Glunz Industries in 1978.
The company's workers in Germany still enjoy a full two weeks off at
Christmas and New Year, a fact which has further angered the Cowie
workforce.
Justifying the difference, finance director Peter Lawwell said in
November that the company needed the extra production to keep up with
demand, while the market and its economics were different in Germany.
In a fax to shop stewards, the union's regional organiser, Mr John
Elliot, said Monday's meeting, in Cowie Miners' Welfare, had been called
''so the views of the membership can be determined''.

A LEADING Scottish judge wants the victims of crime and juries to have
the right, enshrined in law, to be consulted in the punishment meted out
to offenders.
Lord McCluskey will attempt to introduce the proposals in the House of
Lords next week as amendments to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill.
He is suggesting that, in any case in which an offender has been
convicted of a violent offence, such as assault or robbery, the
prosecutor shall, if possible, place before the court a victim impact
statement, which the court will consider before passing sentence.
The statement would be prepared by a legally qualified member of the
procurator-fiscal service and would contain the following information:
* Personal details of the victim, including any relationship with the
offender.
* The physical, emotional, and mental consequences to the victim.
* The financial results for the victim.
* The victim's account of events in any case in which there has been a
plea of guilty.
* The victim's recommendation, if any, to the court, as to whether or
not leniency, should be exercised in passing sentence.
As far as juries are concerned, Lord McCluskey thinks that, in certain
cases, they should be able to make a recommendation on sentencing to the
trial judge.
Where the judge has decided to pass a sentence of imprisonment or
detention for more than three years, it would be competent for the jury
to make a recommendation as to the length of sentence.
The judge would first explain to the jury the range of periods of
imprisonment or detention within which he has in mind, for example,
between three years and eight. The jury would not be able to suggest a
sentence outwith that range.
Under Lord McCluskey's proposals, the jury would be able to retire to
the jury room to consider whether it wished to make a recommendation on
sentence but would not be obliged to suggest a sentence.
Lord McCluskey also wants the Criminal Justice Act to provide a right
for the victim of any crime, or the next of kin if the victim has died,
to attend all sentencing proceedings in serious cases.
The theme of providing a greater say in the criminal justice system
for the ordinary citizen has been a favourite for many years of Lord
McCluskey, a former Solicitor General for Scotland.
In 1989, before passing sentence on a man who carried out a horrific
sex attack on a 25-year-old woman and tried to murder her, he ordered
the Crown to seek the views of the victim.
The Crown lodged an immediate appeal against the order, arguing that
sentencing was the responsibility of the judge, not the victim. Some
victims might be forgiving, some might want revenge, the Crown pointed
out.
Lord Hope, the Lord Justice General, sitting with Lord Justice Clerk
Ross and Lord Brand, upheld the Crown appeal.
Lord Hope pointed out that the Lord Advocate had the right to
prosecute, whether or not a victim wished a case to be taken to court.
Once a case reached the point of sentencing, Scots law, in the interests
of justice, had always entrusted that entirely to the judge.
The appeal court took the view that the only appropriate punishment in
the case was a long term of imprisonment and when the case went back to
Lord McCluskey to pass sentence, he jailed 26-year-old Brian McKenzie
for 10 years.
McKenzie had burst naked into the woman's home in East Lothian, forced
her to commit a series of sex acts, pushed her head under bloodstained
bath water, cut her throat, tried to gouge out her eyes, and stabbed
her.

Warwick in action on home turf this summer. Warwick, now 40, will
spearhead the attack of the current British Touring Car champions, Alfa
Romeo, in 1995.
This means fans can see the ex-F1 and World Sportscar ace in action at
Knockhill Circuit near Dunfermline, for the Scottish counter in the 1995
series, held on the last weekend of July.
Enthusiastic about his place in the Alfa team alongside Italian
Giampiero Simoni, who became a firm favourite with fans north of the
Border last year, Warwick considers 2-litre touring-car racing to be the
most competitive form of motorsport in the world today, with an
estimated 11 manufacturers expected to compete in the series in Britain
this year.
''Now that I have signed up,'' he says, ''all I want to do is get some
serious testing miles in, behind the wheel of a 155. I know I've got one
hell of an act to follow, taking over from Gabriele Tarquini, and can
expect some stiff competition from Ford, Renault, and BMW next year, to
say nothing of the challenge from my team-mate.''
Warwick, who had the options of switching to American Indy Cars,
German Touring Cars, or Formula 1 next season, added: ''I know I am
going to be working with the best team, the best mechanics, and driving
the best cars, so I'm really confident that I can win races and do a
great job for Alfa Romeo.''
Derek Warwick is one of the most popular and succesful racing drivers
Britain has produced in recent years. He started his career in karting,
then graduated to stock cars and Formula Ford.
Ater winning the European Formula Ford Championship in 1976, he gained
a seat in Formula 3, and went on to win the 1978 title. He broke into
Formula 1 in 1981 with the Toleman team, and scored three second places
driving for the Renault F1 team in 1984.
He has also driven for Jaguar in the World Sportscar series, and was
denied the championship in 1991 by a technical infringement.
He signed for Peugeot and finally became the 1992 World Sportscar
Champion, before being snapped up by the Footwork F1 team in 1993, but
an uncompetitive car thwarted his ambitions yet again.

A FINANCIAL consultant who sent a threatening letter to his former
solicitor warning him that he was putting his wife and children's future
happiness and security at risk, has been branded a legal nuisance.
After Mr Alexander Plunkett raised 12 separate legal actions over a
#2000 legal bill, the Lord Advocate yesterday took the rare legal step
of having him declared a vexatious litigant.
Following the order by three Court of Session judges yesterday, Mr
Plunkett, 34, cannot raise fresh legal proceedings of any kind without
the permission of a Supreme Court judge.
Speaking from his home in Philip Avenue, Newton Stewart, Wigtonshire,
last night, Mr Plunkett told The Herald he would contest the court
order, if at all possible.
He said he had tried to lodge answers at the Court of Session in
response to the petition by the Lord Advocate, which was served on him a
month ago, but had been told that he would have to pay a fee of #77.
''I would welcome the chance to get into court. I have been trying to
do that for several years. But I am unemployed and cannot afford #77,''
said Mr Plunkett, who is a single parent with an 11-year-old daughter.
''Am I to be denied justice for the lack of #77?''
He described the whole affair against him as a ''cover-up'' by the
legal profession in an attempt ''to protect its own''.
Lord Ross, Lord Justice Clerk, who heard the Lord Advocate's petition
yesterday, along with Lords Murray and Cullen, was told that, in 1987,
Mr Plunkett asked solicitor Alfred Perring to arrange the sale of his
house, The Falcons, Gullane, East Lothian, and the purchase of his
present home in Newton Stewart.
Mr Perring deducted the fee of #2000 for the conveyancing work,
outlays, and VAT, in accordance with accepted legal practice.
Mr Plunkett objected and made what the Lord Advocate described as
false allegations against Mr Perring to the Law Society, the Lay
Observer, Customs and Excise, and the police. None of them found any
substance in the allegations.
An allegation of criminal behaviour was passed on to the procurator
fiscal in Edinburgh and he decided that there was no evidence to back up
the claim.
Despite this, Mr Plunkett raised 12 separate court actions against Mr
Perring in Stranraer and Edinburgh Sheriff Courts.
In his petition to the Court of Session, the Lord Advocate referred to
a threatening letter written by Mr Plunkett to his former solicitor,
which began: ''Dear Fred, here's the deal.''
The letter urged Mr Perring to pay the disputed #2000 in return for Mr
Plunkett withdrawing complaints to the Law Society and Solicitors
Discipline Tribunal and not raising an action at Edinburgh Sheriff
Court.
The letter ended: ''Think hard about this offer as the matter is on
the verge of turning into a tragedy beyond a scale you can imagine.
''You are putting your wife and children's future happiness and
security at risk. You are walking a very thin line and if I feel you do
anything to threaten my daughter's security, this line may snap and no
lawyer in Scotland will be there to save you.''
According to the Lord Advocate, Mr Plunkett had also failed to pay any
of the expenses awarded against him in the unsuccessful actions he has
brought against Mr Perring.
Lord Ross said that, having considered the petition, the court was
prepared to grant an order declaring Mr Plunkett a vexatious litigant.

OK, so you've got two weeks ahead in which you want to head off for
sun, sea, and sand. But what do you do with the children? Jill Crawshaw,
a veteran of family campaigns, offers some hard-won tips on avoiding
tears and tantrums.
WHEN is a child not a child? This could well be one of the more
searching questions in a mathematics examination on holiday pricing.
''Discounts'' and ''Free Places'' are often blazoned on the front cover
of the tour operators' brochures, but there are so many strings attached
that the whole thing looks like a giant cat's-cradle.
Even the age of the child varies; with Thomson Holidays, the offer of
generous price concessions for the 2-16-year-olds in apartments become
2-11s in hotels. Airtours offers some free places for children up to 19,
though they become adults at 15 if you choose one of its cruises. First
Choice even offers free ''Gramps'', but in the tiny print you find that
the offer lapsed in September last, when you've barely returned from
last year's holiday.
The so-called free holidays and the largest discounts are rarest in
the school holidays, and they tend to be limited to one child per two
full-fare-paying adults. Second children may get smaller discounts or
none at all, though a few firms state that some sort of discounts are
available to all children -- as long as you can work out the age at
which they consider kids reach adulthood.
Generally the free offers and best discounts are dependent on their
sharing the bedroom with parents -- a situation that palls quickly. The
most misleading of all the offers, though, refers to the magic word free
on the cover, to find that they are limited to booking by a certain
date, or on a first-come, first-served basis -- thus, while not actually
cheating the holidaymakers, they are often raising expectations which
cannot be fulfilled.
The under-2s more often than not travel free on charter flights, or
for around #19 on scheduled flights, reasonably getting neither seat,
food, nor luggage allowance. But in the small print you may find that
you have to pay the hotelier direct for a cot and food -- so don't leave
this ''small sum'' to chance, but demand to know in writing what's
involved.
The first time we took our eldest son abroad -- at the age of five
weeks -- we packed caseloads of disposable nappies, cream for here and
powder for there, and ended up paying a small fortune in excess baggage.
On arrival in Majorca we found that almost everything we had brought was
cheaper there.
The next time round, on our way to Minorca, we had to endure one of
those intolerable delays sitting in the aircraft waiting for that
elusive ''take-off slot''. We ran out of nappies and just about
everything else that he needed.
But once there, we dabbled his feet for his first feel of the
Mediterranean, he had his afternoon sleep under the gentle shade of the
trelliced bougainvillea, and the locals who had watched us moving into
the Villa Jacaranda made it their duty to keep us supplied with
freshly-caught fish, sunripened figs and grapes. We, the proud parents,
basked in reflected glory.
Do they get anything out of these holidays, or is all just a long, hot
slog for them, and anxiety for us? In our experience, even if all
children aren't potential Marco Polos, at least they do learn a bit
about the world. Ours knew quite early that ''foreigners'' speak
different languages; they know that the sun can be very hot and the snow
very cold. They know that bananas and oranges and lemons grow on trees,
and not on the supermarket shelves. And we've even found out that
children can make things easier for us -- the sight of two young blond
chaps almost anywhere outside this country open doors that would remain
firmly closed to a couple of adults.
And yes, we actually like going abroad as a family, but it does take
some careful planning!
First, when to go; we found that May, June, and September are far less
fraught than the hot peak summer months, and our decisions have been
further swayed by the fact that those hefty discounts or even ''Free
Children'' offers during the off-peak period shrink to a miserable 10%
in July and August.
Then we learned to find out how far the resort is from the airport --
for children below the age of around 10, any coach ride much longer than
90 minutes is really impossible. Which does, alas, let out some of those
idyllic little Mediterranean islands reached after a
plane-plus-coach-plus-ferry-plus-taxi voyage. It's a good idea too, to
pick out a flight that leaves for home around midday, so that you can
keep your hotel rooms until the last minute -- sitting around the hotel
lobby with all the luggage packed is no fun.
The right beach seems to be priority for toddlers, though we've found
that ours preferred swimming-pools. But when looking for beaches, you
need to exercise a bit of circumspection among the superlatives in the
brochures; even the word ''beach'' can mean an expanse of pebbles or
black volcanic ash. The beach should be ''sandy'', gently shelving, like
many in Majorca, Minorca, the northern Costa Brava, Benidorm on the
Levante Beach side, the Italian Adriatic, and the more sheltered beaches
of Portugal's Algarve, and without railway lines and busy roads between
the hotel and beach -- as in much of Spain's Costa Dorada or Majorca's
Arenal.
The beaches don't only have to be good, but also nearby -- the nearer
the better. Some of those in the Algarve are quite idyllic, but you do
need the agility of a mountain goat to get down to them.
The right resort itself is important -- sadly that little dream place
where on your honeymoon you spent long evenings at your local taverna,
and bathed in moonlight from the rocks, almost certainly isn't the dream
spot for your budding family, at least until they're quite a bit older.
As parents of young children, you need supermarkets to hand, where you
can buy unromantic things like nappies and cream (I always took zinc and
castor oil lotion, which seems a purely British invention), and for your
own peace of mind, you'll want a doctor nearby.
As ours got older, we found that not only do they want a good
swimming-pool, but also beaches with lots to do -- boats, sports, other
kids to play with, and, yes, amusement centres. A hotel or resort with
lots of these ingredients can prevent that dreaded question: ''What can
we do now?''
The choice of hotels is vital; some of our worst experiences have been
in elegant hotels where a combination of snooty waiters and disapproving
staff have brought the worst out of our children.
Check whether there's a ''children welcome'' symbol for the hotel of
your choice in the brochure -- then they'll have high chairs (absolutely
essential), serve children's teas, their cots should be safe (although
whatever the assurance, it is the parents' job to check them out), and
as important, the other guests won't be able to complain if the place is
overrun with the young.
I've been a long-time admirer of Thomson Holidays' free ''Big
T-Club'', which frequently saves parental sanity on holiday. Here, the
3-11-year-olds are supervised for several hours a day, six days a week,
by qualified staff who organise for them all sorts of activities. Even
younger ones can be taken off parents' hands, while their Teen Scene is
for the 12-15s -- largely watersports. Where relevant, the staff
supervise early suppers, bedtime stories, and night patrols.
We've always found villa holidays a great success, offering far
greater freedom and flexibility than in any hotels, where there have to
be set times for meals and room cleaning -- the latter usually just when
junior has gone to sleep.
In a villa you can live in your bathing clothes all day if you want,
the children can have their supper in their pyjamas, and snacks on
demand. I remember when ours were five and two; the youngest wouldn't
sit down to a meal without his families of teddies, a particularly
revolting chewed pink rabbit, and an entire fleet of cars and tanks
around him as he consumed his soup and later ice-cream with his fingers.
Just the sort of thing to turn the head waiter and the parents into
child-haters. And when he was sick in the immaculate dining-room of our
hotel . . . that's another story.
Self-catering standards are generally the highest in Portugal and
Spain, in that order. We've avoided high-rise blocks of flats and have
usually chosen villas in larger developments, with communal swimming and
paddling pools, shops, snack bars, and restaurants nearby, and
maintenance staff readily available.
This does mean that the ''delightful villa in a perfectly isolated
position'' must be avoided, both because the kids crave company, and
also because we are not particularly adept at coping with a Portuguese
ballcock that's developed its own character, or with Greek wiring with a
mind -- and a kick -- of its own.
Cruising can provide superb family holidays as some of the (British)
shipping companies offer extensive facilities for children, and actually
encourage families with hefty discounts. Trained staff look after kids
of all ages, organise parties, galas, and special mealtimes.
Choose a cruise without too many ports of call, as children,
especially the younger ones, resent shipboard routine being interrupted,
and get thoroughly bored with sightseeing. I used to take a taxi as soon
as we docked, and demanded to be driven to the nearest beach, sometimes
like the Pied Piper, with other people's children in tow.
From about six, skiing and boating holidays come into their own,
though on a skiing holiday make sure that they have either ski classes
for the over-fives, or all-day baby-minding with games for the younger
set. Ski resorts are inevitably expensive, and it really is no fun
looking after a baby when you want to be on the slopes. And discount
those tales about parents taking their toddlers skiing, an activity to
which they took like ducks -- no, they didn't.
Boating holidays are on those all-mod-cons cruisers you get on the
Norfolk Broads as well as the French and Dutch canals; as long as you
have one adult ready, willing, and able to stop the children from
falling into the water, these cruisers can provide an excellent
combination of adventure and privacy.
Camping and caravanning can offer a taste of abroad at affordable
prices, though I'm personally not an aficionado of the campsite with
small babies, however good the washing room and loos. Those tent walls
are pretty thin, and baby noises can wake a whole camp.
For children aged from five and six upwards, camping firms have
started to add special children's activities, and their own tents and
adventure clubs on certain sites.
Denmark has one of the finest magnets for children -- Legoland, a
miniature village made up with 25 million Lego bricks, complete with
(full-sized) Wild West village, goldmine, Indian camp, and saloon, as
well as the replica villages, castles, and palaces of the world.
Children between eight and 14 can get their ''driving licences'' in
small electric cars, tackling the traffic as in real life, with an
instructor speaking in five languages to keep the Damon Hills under
control.
The Club Mediterranee, largely in France, is very much a French
institution, and certainly not everyone's cup of tea -- my husband
visited two of them, swearing not to return. Despite his prejudice, Club
Med offers a range of family holidays with clubs for every age of child,
with trained staff for instruction in swimming, judo, waterskiing,
sailing, tennis, and such diverse activities as archery and Greek
dancing. The food is good, life informal, and who knows, they might even
pick up a bit of French!
They don't come cheap, though, but you do get a lot for your money,
and the extras are mild. It is fair to say that Club Med is better for
the gregarious, and there's no point in going if you won't join in.
Then there's the big one! Somewhere between the ages of four and 10,
your child is going to announce: ''I want to go to Disney.'' You might
as well give in.
The problem these days is to choose between the French and the
American ones. May advice is for a weekend in high summer, head for
France. For a longer holiday, it should be Disney World in Florida -- it
is much bigger, has more to offer for the entrance fee, and has much
more to occupy the child than the Magic Kingdom, which is the section
with the Disney characters, Snow White's castle, and the various rides
and attractions.
There are the MGM studios, the enchanting Typhoon Lagoon, hotels,
villas, lakes, beaches, golf, tennis, its own monorail, boats and
steamships -- not forgetting the ''off-Disney'' attractions like Wet 'n'
Wild, the big waterpark with kamikaze slides, Seaworld with shark
encounters, and a host of much more around Orlando -- to say nothing of
the Kennedy Space Centre and Busch Gardens. Spend a week (the first
week) at Disney and Orlando, and the second week getting over it in a
Gulf Coast beach resort.
Not that the children themselves always appreciate the exotic or the
expensive trips; according to a recent travel-agency survey, top of the
pops on holiday with the younger set was staying up late, the
swimming-pool, even the lift and room service.
Other quotes I've collected over the years make informative reading:
''We stayed up late every night,'' said one young adventurer, while
another explained his family's fondness for the simple life thus: ''We
live in a big house at home, which is why spend our holidays in a small
caravan''.
And I wondered whether the airlines had nobbled one of the youngsters,
and bribed him with this comment: ''We had a super time at the airport
with some other children when we had to wait for a late aeroplane. We
made tents with raincoats and pretended we were camping.''
Happy holidays!

MOBILE phones may be banned from hospital wards after a Government
health warning.
Experts fear that if the phones are used too close to patients' beds,
they could affect vital instruments and equipment.
Use of the phones is already prohibited on aircraft because they
interfere with navigational equipment.
Professor Alex Elliott, head of the West of Scotland Department of
Clinical Physics and Bio-Engineering, is helping to frame new
regulations governing their use.
''We have received a hazard warning and we are carrying out an
investigation,'' he said.
Professor Elliott said there had been reports that the phones had
affected drug-infusion pumps -- more than 100 of which were in use at
Glasgow Western Infirmary where he is based.

TV STAR Noel Edmonds today spoke of his regret that an elephant at his
Crinkley Bottom theme park in Somerset had been destroyed.
He was unaware of a decision to put down 31-year-old Sahib, described
as a dangerous animal which had injured others, until after it happened.
However, he was ''deeply saddened'' that Sahib was killed on December
14 without consultation of the full board of the leisure park near
Chard.
''The board was aware that, for more than two years, an alternative
home was being sought for Sahib without success,'' said Edmonds.
''However, the order to destroy the animal is deeply regrettable.''
The Taylor family, who operate the wildlife side of Crinkley Bottom at
Cricket St Thomas, said it was a ''sad but humane decision'' taken in
the interests of animal welfare.
Sahib, who at 6[1/2] tons was thought to be the largest Asian elephant
in captivity, was injected to make him unconscious, then shot.
He had proved ''a difficult animal to work with and his arrival at
Cricket St Thomas in 1991 was largely seen as a reprieve for him,'' said
a statement.
However, he was unable to integrate with a herd of four cow elephants.
Sahib, who was regarded as in his prime, was reared in a circus and
moved to Belfast Zoo until 1991.
Park spokesman Neil Crespin said: ''Sahib was violent towards the
other elephants. We tried for two years to find another zoo to take him
but no-one in Europe, and in other parts of the world, was interested in
an animal of his age with behaviour problems.''
In the end, it was decided his life style was ''unsatisfactory'' and
he was destroyed just before Christmas.

Don't let your bag and baggage tie you down. Raymond Gardner and
Kirsty Scott pool their travelling experience to provide expert tips on
what to do to ensure many happy landings.
THE ultimate way in which to travel glitch-free is simply not to go.
This may seem a rather extreme method of avoiding all those pitfalls
that befall holidaymakers and are the lifeblood of the TV consumer
programmes and Which? magazine. The truth is that you are just as
likely, or possibly even more likely, to come a cropper at home -- for
it is still a fact that flying is the safest form of getting anywhere.
That being said, there are still some pranks and practices which the
hardened traveller learns over the years. Choosing a seat on the
aircraft is the first hurdle, and I'm assuming that you are not one of
the pampered few who flies everywhere at the front of the bus.
Early check-in times are designed for the convenience of the airline,
not the passenger -- but you can make them work in your favour. Arriving
early should give you a choice of seating and the wise traveller always
demands the aisle option. When travelling a deux opt for two aisle seats
across from one another.
This means that you will have more room to stretch your legs, be able
to get to the loo without a mountaineering act in the middle of the
night and might well get an empty seat beside you depending on the
configuration of the seating.
There is, of course, the all-important matter of luggage -- that item
which airlines say they haven't lost, only mislaid. This is a great help
when you are in Houston and your life-support system has hit Honolulu.
Apart from that, hefty hold luggage is just a bore, and I'll guarantee
you don't use a fraction of what you pack.
The solution? Go minimal. Buy one of those small cases with wheels all
cabin staff use. You can take it on board and it will glide up aisles as
easily as across marbled concourses.
Having got on the aircraft there is then the matter of getting off.
This can have its own complication, known as immigration. Visitors to
developing countries not in the package travel zones may find a tenner
(and not a ''funny'' Scottish one) accidentally slipped into their
passport helpful.
A friend went to Nigeria a while back. I saw her away at Heathrow and
less than 48 hours later she was on the phone. I was astonished at how
clear the line was, only to discover that she was back at Heathrow. She
had never stepped out of the airport at the other end. She'd flown out
on a three-month visa, although she knew she was going for at least six.
The High Commission or whatever had told her just to say, if asked, she
was staying a couple of months. The visa would be extended once she was
in the country.
Tired and jet-lagged at the airport she told the immigration officer
she was staying for six months. She told me the official was very upset
when he could only find a three-month visa and tried to help by
endlessly looking through her passport for another one -- or probably
for something even more user-friendly than a visa.
Visitors to the US should not, of course, put anything other than visa
waiver slips in their passport. Document inspection across the pond is
getting more civilised but hints of Senator McCarthy still linger. If it
is not entirely obvious that you are there for a bucket-and-spade
fortnight in the Florida sun -- childless, single travellers arriving in
New York take heed -- you could try saying you are in the travel
business and have come to inspect some hotels.
In fact I know one man who travels with a batch of business cards
showing he is a travel consultant. By this method he's had himself
upgraded on countless occasions. Naughty, perhaps, but nice if you can
get away with it.
IN TANZANIA it was a toilet tent, in Queensland it worked as a beach
wrap, and in a nameless London hotel it doubled as a sheet to replace
the clean but suspiciously stained poly-cotton stretched across the
mattress. The sarong has to be the most useful travel accessory ever. A
rectangle of bright cotton which packs away to nothing and will convert
to anything from a towel to evening wear. If you're headed somewhere for
a regular holiday, take one. If it's off the beaten track, take two.
Those small packets of wet wipes are another godsend. They're ideal
for quick fixes to clean dropped cutlery, wipe the sweat from your brow,
or replace the missing soap in a public toilet. You can also wash on
them for days if you have to. Take a mixture of regular and antiseptic.
Ear-plugs and those re-sealable plastic sandwich bags are equally
invaluable. The plugs have to be wax -- those yellow foam concoctions
always seem to end up springing out of your ears. The bags can carry
shoes, spillables, and food on the outward journey and souvenirs or
unwashed unmentionables on the homeward leg. Don't bother with travel
wash -- any old shampoo does just as well.
Earlier this year, I was seduced into buying one of these emergency
kits in a tin -- the kind that include matches, fishing line, bandages,
and SOS tips. It never made it into the rucksack -- once I'd pulled
everything out it was impossible to get it all back in.
On two separate trips to the more combustible regions of Africa I was
advised by a well-worn traveller to take a sterile needle kit. It weighs
next to nothing and has enough sealed hypodermics and sutures to cope
with the worst wounds. Thankfully, it has never been needed but the
peace of mind it offers is incalculable.
For mosquito repellent, if your skin can stand it and your life
depends on it take the 100% DEET formulas. I've never found anything
else that works as thoroughly. In the Australian rain forest I tried out
an environmentally friendly lotion, tested at various tropical medical
establishments, and woke next morning to 56 bites on one leg alone. In
the Caribbean, I was complimented on my ''zesty'' perfume after oiling
up with a well-known brand of mozzie spray.
For travelling itself, there are few truly helpful guidelines, because
everyone reacts differently to flying/sailing/driving/trekking.
There's nothing more irritating than those celebrity factfiles which
claim Cindy or Sylvester can sleep through the red-eye to Los Angeles,
sipping only on Evian, spritzing with aromatherapy oils, and snuggling
under a cashmere throw. Of course they can. They're in those big, fat,
first-class seats up front, and they're being met at the other end by a
limousine stocked with champagne and sushi.
Forget all the try-to-sleep and don't-eat-the-food theories. If it's a
long flight, you're going to feel like hell at the end of it no matter
what you do, so you might as well have seen the film, eaten your way to
indigestion, and drunk your way through the complimentary bar. Actually,
in truth it does help to drink loads of water. It stops in-flight
headaches and helps you exercise on those interminable trips to the loo.
On the ground, tact and a strong smile will get you through most
situations, but there's nothing to beat a well-timed flash of anger in
the right situations, whether it's aimed at a recalcitrant check-in
operator or a belligerent border guard.
And finally, if you forget your alarm clock or can't rely on those
hotels which promise wake-up calls and don't deliver, try a friend's
foolproof method for waking up in time. Just before you drop off, hit
your head off the pillow the same number of times as the hour you want
to awake. It really does works . . . honest.

Montmartre, famous for its artists and bijou lifestyle, is one of
France's premier attractions, enticing six million visitors a year. Yet
its architecture is in grave danger, reports Nicholas Powell.
IT IS the balcony of Paris. Montmartre rises up from the red lights
and sleaze of Pigalle, to peak at 127m, capped by the white-domed
Basilica of the Sacre Coeur, 100m above the meandering River Seine. This
most picturesque and celebrated part of the capital has been groaning
for years under the weight and pollution of coaches which help bring an
estimated six million people a year to visit -- one local association
for the protection of Montmartre claims that as many as 600 buses a day
drive up there at the height of the season.
Yet nothing, until very recently, had been done to protect the streets
of the area from building speculators or the inhabitants from the
perverse side- effects of mass tourism.
The comprehensive two-year architectural survey, taking in every
building in the area and commissioned by the city of Paris as part of a
public inquiry into the problems of Montmartre, was recently completed
by the architect Alexandre Melissinos, one of France's experts on sites
of historic interest which are threatened by tourism -- Mont Saint
Michel in Brittany is another of his current projects.
The district, on the huge and highly detailed street map which
Melissinos has drawn up, covers about 200 acres and has some 60,000
inhabitants. When the architect commenced his project, no-one could
define the boundaries of what, until it was annexed by Paris in 1860,
had long been a village. Melissinos started by visiting Montmartre
restaurants and asked waiters where they thought the frontiers of their
home patch lay.
He then discovered a map drawn up by a protest committee, which in the
1920s had campaigned against the construction of high-rise buildings in
the district. (With the touch of craziness which Parisians still
associate with Montmartre, the committee also demanded that the River
Seine be diverted in order to cut off their quarter from the rest of
Paris.) The waiters' description of the boundaries of Montmartre and the
association's turned out to be the same.
''At the end of the day I adopted frontiers which most people agreed
on but which were in fact subjective. Everything is subjective in
Montmartre, actually. The place is very picturesque but it is more a
fantasy than a reality. Nevertheless, fantasies are important and we
have to protect them,'' Alexandre Melissinos said.
It is true that little remains of the places which created the
mythology of Montmartre. A couple of years ago, I trekked round to a
dozen addresses of cafes, restaurants, and artists' workshops,
frequented at the end of the last century by the painter
Toulouse-Lautrec. Nothing remains. The one cafe from 100 years ago still
operating had long since changed its name and been decked out in formica
and aluminium fittings. Ironically, Alexandre Melissinos now wants to
slap a protection order on it as an example of 1960s design!
All in all, Montmartre has very few monuments and practically no great
architecture. Most of the buildings date from the reign of Napoleon III
in the third quarter of the last century. Before that, the area was
mainly open fields, the subsoil riddled with quarries which supplied
limestone used in the building of Notre Dame and in the production of
plaster of Paris.
During the nineteenth century, the population, Alexandre Melissinos
said, was a curious mix of artists who went there because it was cheap,
artists who made money and stayed there, and all the people who were
attracted by the area's Bohemian life. Being outside Paris city limits
until 1860, Montmartre bars were able to sell cheap duty-free drink.
Prosperous bourgeois living in smart new buildings just south of
Montmartre also bought property up the hill for the purpose of partying
and entertaining their mistresses.
In 1871, after the Prussian siege of Paris, Montmartre was home to the
revolutionary working-class ''Commune''. The area which made Paris
really ''gai'' boasted a mixture of working-class bars and smart
cabarets frequented by the rich out for a good time and many of the
city's prostitutes. Even today, its tradition of independence lingers
on. Redevelopment projects have been fiercely fought all through this
century by a number of associations which rarely manage to agree among
themselves.
Alexandre Melissinos found that only 15 buildings in Montmartre had
been classed as historic monuments. Astonishingly, the immense
neo-Byzantine Basilica of the Sacre Coeur, Paris's other big tourist
icon (along with the Eiffel Tower) is not listed. In his final report,
Alexandre Melissinos suggested that 23 more buildings, including the
Basilica, should be classified. When that happens, half the cost of any
renovation work on the Basilica will be paid by the state and the rest
will be tax-deductible. Church authorities will still have to pay for
the cost of upkeep.
Alexandre Melissinos also wants the Moulin de la Galette classified.
The former windmill became a popular working-class dance-hall, pictured
by Renoir, in the last century, when millers in Montmartre found that
selling cheap drink was far more profitable than grinding corn. The
architect's report also recommends that what remains of le Bateau
Lavoir, which was badly damaged by fire in 1975 and was in a rundown
condition even when Picasso made it famous by working there early this
century, be preserved.
Melissinos proposes preservation orders on a further 500 buildings and
building restrictions on more than a thousand more -- so that if
demolition takes place, new constructions will have to respect the
original height and overall appearance of what they replace. The streets
and buildings at the foot of the hill beneath the Sacred Heart, along
with the curious cement and stone walkways which descend on either side
of the lawns leading down from the Basilica, will also be listed.
''I do not care for any of that architecture personally, but I have to
admit that it forms a coherent whole which deserves to be preserved,''
Melissinos said. The architect is still unsure what to do, however,
about the red windmill which sits on top of the Moulin Rouge music-hall.
The opening of Paris's most famous cabaret in 1880 marked the beginning
of tourism in Montmartre. Visitors still flock to the theatre, but
architecturally speaking it is insignificant.
Paris City Hall also called on a town-planning firm, Urbanis, to study
traffic and tourism problems in Montmartre. They concluded that the
place was not even easy to find. The Metro station Montmartre, named
after a street and not the site itself, is miles away and misleads
tourists. For visitors who do make it to the right underground stop,
there are no signposts.
Paris Metro authorities have agreed to modify the name of two stations
to include the word Montmartre. Urbanis, who discovered that a large
number of tourists who do finally get to Montmartre tend to get lost,
also proposes setting up a visitors' information kiosk outside the Metro
station Abbesses. Petty crime, it also noted, is a major problem. But
police are unwilling to make an effort for offences as minor as
pickpocketing, even on such a large scale -- one day, 20 handbags and
purses, a record, were found discarded inside the Basilica.
The local restaurant owners and tradesmen have a slightly different
attitude from the planners. Andre Roussard, who was born in Montmartre,
runs a painting gallery near the place du Tertre, which has been the
touristic heart of the district since the 1950s. Its dozens of
''pavement artists'' are, at the moment, mostly art students passing
through from Eastern Europe and the Baltic states. In 1986 Andre
Roussard founded the local tourist information office, the only one of
its sort in Paris, which in addition to answering queries and handing
out brochures sells three-day packages comprising two nights in a hotel,
plus restaurant meals and shows.
''Montmartre is a very complicated place and I'm sceptical about
conclusions that Urbanis has come to. Local authorities, on the other
hand, do not really understand how tourism works. Montmartre has the
architectural charm of a village. There may be no great buildings but
the streets form a whole which has its own very peculiar attraction and
has always puzzled city authorities,'' said Andre Roussard.
For Andre Roussard, there are other priorities for Montmartre, which
despite its six million visitors a year still has only one public
lavatory, virtually no phone booths, and no tobacconists, who in France
have the monopoly on selling stamps for all those thousands of
postcards. Changes in Montmartre may be only beginning.

Official support has swung away from luxury golf developments in China
but the sport is still going strong. Kirsty Scott reports on the state
of play in her round-up of tourism world-wide.
CHINESE officials have taken a decision to ban new luxury construction
projects until 1996 and halt new golf-course and racetrack developments.
An official from the State Planning Commission said the state will not
approve new projects involving luxury hotels, office buildings, or
villas until the end of 1995. The official said construction of new
entertainment facilities, such as golf courses and racetracks, would
also be frozen.
''Launching new luxury projects is obviously inappropriate when the
government wants to see more money poured into infrastructure
projects,'' the official said.
More than 40 golf courses have been built or are under construction
across China, with total investment of more than 10 billion yuan ($1.18
billion), despite a ban on new golf courses announced earlier this year.
A Japanese economist expressed scepticism at whether the government
can enforce the ban: ''It has issued bans like this before, but
provincial and local authorities have ignored them, especially because
these sorts of projects are among the most profitable.''
* THE Lido, one of France's premier night-spots, has reopened after a
state-of-the-art makeover, which saw the trademark feathers all but
vanish from the dancers and an array of hi-tech laser gimmicks
installed.
C'est Magique, the cabaret's new revue which premiered this month, has
dressed up its trademark glitz in an orgy of hi-tech it describes as
''the most dazzling and entertaining show to be seen on stage anywhere
in Europe''.
Laser technology, a video game that comes to life, 14 computers
operating stage sets, coupled with water fountains and a skating rink
form the backdrop to the Bluebell dancers.
The revolution has stripped the performers of most of their feathers
-- only a few are retained out of respect for an age-old tradition.
The price for dragging the Lido into the 21st century -- the
promoters' aim -- is 70 million francs ($13 million) lavished on the
revue and on renovating the Champs-Elysees landmark to drape its hall in
red velvet and pastel grey.
From its origins in 1946, the Lido has grown to become France's
biggest private cabaret, overshadowing competitors such as the Paris
Moulin Rouge and Folies Bergere. Today it is the biggest consumer of
champagne in France -- 800 bottles of its own brand are downed each
night.
* THE Southern Tourist Board's short-break brochure, Take A Break, has
been redesigned. It now provides information on accommodation offering
value-for-money dinner, bed and breakfast, and ideas for self-catering
breaks.
The brochure is divided into three sections -- By the Sea, In the
Country, Historic Cities and Towns -- giving readers the opportunity to
tailor a break to their particular tastes.
It also includes a section on special themed breaks at participating
hotels, including flying lessons, hot-air ballooning, murder-mystery,
painting, or wine-tasting.
The guide is available from the Southern Tourist Board, 40
Chamberlayne Road, Eastleigh, Hampshire SO5 5JH, tel: 0703 620006.
* BRITISH Midland has announced that it is expanding its operations
into Scandinavia with the introduction of non-stop daily flights between
Edinburgh and Copenhagen from March this year.
The new service will run alongside the existing run from Glasgow to
Copenhagen, which has seen a yearly passenger increase of 18.5%. The
36,000 passengers carried by British Midland on the route are
predominantly business customers who have been taking advantage of both
the direct services into Copenhagen and the onward connections into
Scandinavia, the Baltic States, CIS, Eastern Europe, and beyond.
Business prices start at #403. Tourist fares start at #160.
* EFFORTS have been continuing to sell the Channel Tunnel to the
travel trade. At the recent World Travel Market Eurotunnel co-chairman
Sir Alastair Morton called upon exhibitors and visitors to help
Eurotunnel keep cross-Channel traffic one of the strongest growth
markets in the world.
''It is a market that will continue to grow as the tunnel eliminates
the concerns and the congestions that build barriers, real and
perceived, to short-sea and short-haul air travel. It is a market in
which the future has finally arrived.''
Eurotunnel expects to capture 50% of the cross-Channel car market with
its Le Shuttle service, and 60% of the Paris/Brussels air traffic with
Eurostar. It is predicted that 14.5m cars will travel between Dover and
Calais in 1994 with 10m air trips on the London-Paris and
London-Brussels routes. Eurotunnel say every Eurostar service is equal
in capacity to two airbuses.
* THE American Society of Travel Agents, on the world's largest and
most influential travel-trade associations, has reached an all-time
membership high, according to officials. More than 25,000 people in 130
countries are linked to the organisation. International members make up
10% of ASTA'S membership, but that number if expected to rise in coming
years. More than 49m travellers visit the USA each year and it remains
one of the biggest travel markets in the world.
* ALABAMA has been promoting itself overseas as one of the key golf
centres in the USA. The state, which is not generally considered to be
on the tourist track, claims to have the largest number of public golf
courses in the country.
The level of golf played in Alabama ranges from beginners' lessons to
the Senior PGA Tour. Facilities range from the Cotton Creek course,
designed by Arnold Palmer, in Gulf Shores and the Robert Trent Jones
Golf Trail which meanders up and down the state freeway system.
The director of the Alabama Bureau of Tourism and Travel, Wayne
Greenhaw, has written a golfing novel, The Golfer, to help the
promotion.
* ENVIRONMENTAL campaigners have pointed to the rejuvenation of
Carthage in Tunisia as evidence of possible collaboration between the
travel trade and the green lobby.
Two years ago, the site was in a state of neglect, despite the fact it
had more than 500,000 paying visitors a year. A tour operator on a trip
to Carthage, who noticed the decline, tackled the issue with local
officials and helped to work out a management and clean-up plan.  Local
officials were delighted with the result and have rewarded the tour
operator with an appropriately discreet plaque on the site.

THE royal skiers went toboggan racing in Klosters last night, and the
Prince of Wales was beaten soundly by his two sons.
Charles fell off his wooden sledge twice as Princes William and Harry
sped down the slope at the rear of their Swiss hotel.
Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie also joined in the fun on plastic
sledges.
The three princes appeared at the top of the slope together with a
line of press and photographers waiting expectantly at the bottom as
evening began to fall.
Prince Charles set off, but almost immediately fell and had to clamber
back on to his wooden sledge while William, 12, and Harry, 10, who had
been practising earlier in the week, went past him.
Further down the slope, Prince Charles again took a tumble.
Meanwhile, Princesses Beatrice, six, and Eugenie, four, had been
pulled to halfway up the slope by the Duchess of York and her assistant
Hilly Bett and, as the princes drew up in a line for photographs to be
taken, the two youngsters caught them up.
The royal skiers happily trudged back up the slope 100 yards or so for
another run, and this time William came in first after Harry, clearly an
expert, wiped out near the end of the slope.
The toboggan race came on the eve of the Duchess of York's departure
with her daughters after nine days in the resort.
While the two parties have not mixed a great deal, the duchess dined
with the prince and others on Thursday in the Walserhof Hotel where they
are both staying, and the prince's aides have been keen to stress there
is no truth in reports of hostility between the brother and
sister-in-law.
Last night's photo-call is the last planned for the princes, and
Charles's aides hope they will now be left in peace for the remaining
two days of skiing.

THERE was a time when landscapes were not considered suitable material
for paintings. Not classical enough. Nowadays anything goes -- well,
almost anything. Jock McFadyen's determination to stick with the urban
underbelly of life and ''non-art'' subjects like strippers, transvestite
lorry drivers, supermarket shoppers, pub regulars, building-site
workers, Cortina girls, and, of course, go-go dancers, has sometimes got
him into trouble -- but also into the spotlight.
Starting from teenage Saturday morning classes at Glasgow School of
Art in the early 1960s, he progressed with stops and starts via Chelsea
School of Art to the prestigious residency at London's National Gallery
in 1981 (only the second to be so honoured); the John Moores Award; then
a spell as official British War Artist in Berlin in 1991 plus set
designs for the Royal Ballet's Judas Tree in 1992. His bitter realism
with its dry, black taste, its wit and gritty subject matter, made his
name. But the irony and deadly humour is something of a double-edged
sword. ''I never wanted to be a jokey artist. I wanted to be serious and
fast-moving,'' he says.
These are not pretty pictures -- but then McFadyen's slice of life art
aims to depict the reality of rough, down-at-heel existence, aggression,
and soul-destroying melancholy.
Social conscience comes in all forms. McFadyen's pictures are an
uneasy marriage of caricature and emotion as he sets out to capture
unglamorous events seen in the cold light of day. His characters are
impervious to affection: deformed, half-witted, East End yobbos,
resigned strippers and pig-eyed street-market stallholders and their
lovers set against a background of bus stops, old pushchairs, gaunt
gasometers, wrecked cars, and slums.
McFadyen explained the setting of Edinburgh Go-go Dancer to me. ''The
pub is in Lady Lawson Street by the Edinburgh Art College. The go-go
dancer perches on a shelf by a mirror. All pretty seedy. It's part of my
perception of Edinburgh offstage -- or backstage, if you like. Everyone
knows about the centre of town, about the Mound and the castle, but
places like the tower blocks at Leith, the gasworks at Granton, or the
tacky Portobello Boat Club are rarely mentioned. That's why I've also
recently painted those Leith flats by the docks. They're vile, all
yellow and blue. You can probably see them from George Street. They must
have looked nice in the architect's drawings but they're bloody awful in
reality.''
The gouache of the Edinburgh Go-go Dancer is in direct descent from
the ungainly prostitutes, resolutely unsensual pub singers, and
big-thighed dancers of the late 1980s and early 90s, but more jaunty in
spirit -- and better drawn too! My objection to McFadyen's strippers in
the past has been his thoroughly bad draughtsmanship; his inability to
deal with line and anatomy. Edinburgh Go-go is not quite as fine as the
etching, Cramond, with the leggy girl in sheer stockings in a clinch,
also exhibited recently at Edinburgh's Scottish Gallery, but is
infinitely preferable to the previous bald, drunk, brutalised G-string
performers with their coarse pink skin and red winkle-picker high heels.
Here McFadyen uses a wet on wet paint technique, the thick pink skin
melting into a dark background.
For the last five years McFadyen has spent the midsummer months at his
Edinburgh flat, exchanging Poplar and the Isle of Dogs for Portobello
and Cramond. Graffiti and text play a prominent role in his pictures:
road-signs, banners, posters, slogans: ''Crack is Wack'' sprayed in the
New York subway; ''No Surrender'' in Ulster; multilingual propaganda on
the Berlin Wall or ''Christ is Risen'' in Mile End or Granton. It has
been said that McFadyen works rather like a sightseer without a
guidebook. He paints what catches his eye. And in Edinburgh the Go-go
Dancer won hands down.

JOCK McFadyen's Edinburgh Go-go has been bought by Julian Spalding for
Glasgow's new Museum of Modern Art due to open in 1996, although the
picture will be seen before that in Kelvingrove. It cost #3750, measures
29[1/2]" x 22[1/2]", and is in gouache (a sort of poster paint).
Spalding also bought several McFadyen pictures in 1992.
There has long been concern about Spalding's buying policy, both in
quality and in subject matter. Many see his popularist slant as
condescending to the Glasgow gallery-going public, whose money he is
spending. ''He seems out to shock us,'' says Glasgow art dealer William
Hardie. ''We are not impressed. It's merely rather pathetic. Spalding
should take his responsibilities more seriously.''
The go-go dancer joins recent acquisitions of 100 photos of workers by
the Brazilian Salgado, price #100,000; nine contemporary Aboriginal
paintings; two oils by popularist artist Beryl Cook (one titled
Karaoke), and five oils by Sandy Guy, the most recent bought last week.
(Guy paints images of Elvis.)
It appears that Spalding likes bulk-buying. In 1992 he spent #500,000
on works by London-based John Bellany. The McFadyen is unusual because
the artist is Scottish, although he has lived in England since the age
of 16.
Except for the director of the Tate Gallery in London, Spalding has
the largest budget for contemporary art in Britain. In 1990 Glasgow
District Council set up a #3m fund to enable the city to catch up on its
collecting of Glasgow-trained artists like Kate Whiteford, Adrian
Wiszniewski, Jenny Saville, Douglas Gordon, and Alison Watt, who have
put Glasgow's name on the international map. Spalding has signally
failed to do this.
Unlike directors of the Tate or Scottish National Gallery, Spalding
does not have a board of trustees and so is unaccountable. Many feel
this is a mistake. His buying policy has been erratic, he indulges his
own personal taste, as in the go-go dancer, and ignores Glasgow artists
and Glasgow art dealers, thus depriving the home market of vital income.
Indeed most of Spalding's buying has been done outside Scotland. Even
the Sandy Guy pictures were bought in Connecticut.
The go-go dancer highlights Glasgow Museums' questionable acquisitions
policy and its use of public money -- and will certainly fuel debate.

As the row rages over Julian Spalding's decision to buy Jock
McFadyen's controversial nude for Glasgow, Jack McLean argues that it is
just a throwback to the harmless fun that Edinburgh's go-go dancers
represented.
SHE stands, not erect admittedly, but not ashamed either. Bending
over, true, but by no means bending down. Covering her all, as they say,
and very cheeky to boot. Making damned sure you get an idea but not a
look. She is in the buff. This is not the po-faced ''undraped female
figure'' I was taught about and taught to draw at Edinburgh College of
Art: this is a cheery wee tart.
And in just the same fashion that female, and indeed male, models
were, well, models of propriety, so is this lassie. All right, you can
see her bum. Her hand is making sure you cannae see anything else but
just imagine it. I hope she gets a nice wee sweet Martini at the end of
the night. She's got a smile on her which suggests she likes a bit of
company when she's finished work. And she's a painting (below, right).
She's a painting which Julian Spalding of Glasgow's amazing
Kelvingrove Art Gallery has bought for what will be his new Gallery of
Scottish Art, and he bought her for a mere four grand, which is cheap
because it is a very good painting indeed, even if it is vulgar.
The tabloids will go daft, but then they did that 40 years ago when T
J Honeyman bought the Dali painting of St John of the Cross. Today the
Dali lies sepulchrally in Glasgow's Museum of Religion. Tomorrow this
little happy hussy might get there too. After all, remember Mary
Magdalene.
Jock McFadyen is the artist. He has had many a controversy woven
around his work, paints a lot of prostitutes and seedy lassies. So did
Degas, Lautrec, Picasso, Freud, every other painter. None of the lads
above would be politically thingummyjig today. In fact the ladies in The
Herald office weren't happy with the photo of the painting either.
Thought it vulgar and demeaning to women.
Direct, I would call it. I doubt there's been many women who have not
struck as provocative a silly pose on the odd night for a husband or
other lover, but there you are. I suspect the girls are upset because
the painting lacks romance, even eroticism. It is a splash of cheerful
coorseness undignified by glamour. Also the act of teasing is perhaps a
touch close to what girls do anyway, a kind of disclosure to which women
don't want to admit.
But as a painting it is clear what its origins are. Balthus is part of
the concept behind it, and maybe Edward Hopper in its approach to the
life of the ordinary punter and that world. Certainly there is a strong
brush with Modigliani, and there is even a certain elegance in the bleak
composition.
Last but not least there is an obvious collusion to the simple raucous
humour of the primitive but witty works of Beryl Cook. The one thing it
is not is exploitative of women, no matter what some prissy women and
men may say. Just wait till the tabloids get their beadies on this. Just
watch the prissiness, and hypocrisy with its eyes straining and its
mouth agape.
For this is a painting of a go-go dancer. Just when go-go was invented
as a term I cannot quite remember. There were all sorts of clubs in the
early sixties with the title, the Whisky a Go-Go being perhaps the most
famous and the prototype for many other discotheques throughout the
Western world. And thus came the dancers. Few American movies of urban
life, especially the cop thriller films, were without a bar scene with
exiguously-clad dancers gyrating in the background. These films were set
in New York or Chicago or L A or maybe even London. Where you least
expected to find go-go dancers was in the doucest city in the world.
Yet I still remember finding myself in the Canny Man's pub, a splendid
old late-Victorian pub in the famously genteel district of Morningside
in Edinburgh, in 1970. A dark ornate bar, at noon, a handful of wee men
in bunnets. I stood at the bar counter with a wee goldie in hand. It was
quiet and reflective in there, a watery sun squinting through the
frosted-glass windows.
Suddenly a bloody banshee started up, decibel-pounding heavy-metal
music. And then a slim young beauty wearing a spangly bikini strode out
from behind a curtain and began to walk along the counter top, gyrating
all the way. This cannot be happening, is what I thought. In Edinburgh,
in a wee man's pub, in Morningside, at midday. But it was happening and
continued to happen in many an Edinburgh pub for many years.
Eventually, I even helped to make a film about the phenomenon in this
northern city. In fact it was one of the first film items ever shown on
the new Channel 4. Myself and a writer, Iain Thorburn, cruised around
all these bars in Scotland's capital.
There were more than 40 pubs putting on the shows with 70-odd dancers,
most of them students, especially of drama, and office girls, bank
clerks and so on, making an extra few quid for a few hours' work. The
girls went from gig to gig, covering as many as 12 bars a night. The
girls were chaste and pleasant, not at all hard-faced hookers or
strident strumpets. Their performances were mildly erotic, admittedly,
but healthy, and I suppose rather innocent.
Certainly the girls enjoyed themselves. They almost always had
boyfriends with them, young fellows who worked as drivers or factory
operatives, mostly from perfectly respectable working-class backgrounds.
No pimps or hustlers, no villains or hard-tickets.
I recollect asking a question of one of the girls, a 19-year-old
physiotherapy student at the then Telford College, and getting put well
and truly in my place. I asked her if she minded all these dirty old men
leering at her of a night. ''Whit's up wi' you?'' she asked, ''Are ye a
dirty auld man yersel? Ah'm prood o' ma boady. Ah've got a nice boady
and there's nae dirty auld men oot there. They're young fellows enjoyin'
themselves, ken, and admirin' me.''
She was young and pretty and danced well and saw no harm in what she
did well. It was a cheerful and rather sedate performance. It was what I
said before -- innocent.
That was a long time ago. A visit to the handful of pubs in Edinburgh
which still put on go-go performances was dispiriting. I could only find
three, in fact. Burke and Hare's was once a decent little pub called The
Lochiel -- a favourite with myself and fellow Edinburgh College of Art
students. The manager wouldn't speak to me because his proprietor didn't
want him to have anything to do with the press. The Lochiel had been a
wee man's pub too. It was ''refurbished'' a little cheaply, back in the
late seventies. Today it is shabby and knows it. The performances don't
happen till later in the evening.
Across the road in the Western Bar the pub didn't open at all until
one in the afternoon. It too, once a vibrant little old-fashioned pub
peopled with students and locals, is now seedy and down-at-heel. The
girls are no longer students and DHSS clerkesses looking for a couple of
bob and a chance to show off a little to an appreciative crowd of
ordinary drinkers.
That's the present-day reality behind the go-go dancers. The painting
itself looks back to the earlier age, but there's an edge to it. It has
a frisson of the good times. The woman is doing her best to entertain
her customers. It is bawdy and rude, and so is she.
I can't help a feeling, though, that maybe the Herald ladies do have a
point. She shouldn't have to parade herself. It is a different age from
two decades ago.
But Julian Spalding should still have bought the painting.

GLASGOW has lost its second Lord Provost within eight months following
the death yesterday of James Shields, 65, after a short illness. He had
served only six months of his term of office.
It follows the death from cancer in May of his predecessor Robert
Innes and it is believed to be the first time in the eight centuries of
the post that two successive occupants have died before completing their
tenure.
Two former deputy chairmen of the council, Bailie Charles Brown and
Bailie James McLean, have also died within the last two years.
Mr Shields, who was born and brought up in the Gorbals, had been
active in the Labour Party for more than 30 years, winning election to
the city's Queens Park ward in 1984.
He was taken to hospital earlier this week. In November he broke a hip
in a fall.
Warm tributes from across the political spectrum were paid to him last
night.
Mrs Jean McFadden, a former leader of Glasgow District Council and
past president of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, said:
''James Shields was a quiet, kind man with no airs and graces, who loved
Glasgow and its people. It is a pity that God didn't give him longer to
make his mark as a great Lord Provost of the city.''
Council leader Pat Lally said: ''I knew the Lord Provost for more than
30 years. Like myself, he was a product of the Gorbals and he never
forgot his roots, nor the problems of the underprivileged.''
Councillor Susan Baird, who was Lord Provost of Glasgow from 1988
until 1992 and a personal friend of Mr Shields, described him as a
''perfect gentleman'', adding he was ''a very caring man, both as
Provost and as a councillor''.
Veteran Conservative Councillor John Young said: ''I always felt it
was a great tribute to the man that, when he was nominated to succeed
Bob Innes, he was unopposed. That showed the sheer respect and
popularity he enjoyed on all sides of the City Chambers.''
Councillor Tommy Sheridan, leader of the council's Militant group,
said: ''He was a very humane individual who will be sorely missed.''
Cardinal Thomas Winning, the Archbishop of Glasgow, said: ''He was a
man who worked so hard and gave up so much of his time for the good of
the city.''
A funeral service for Mr Shields, who is survived by his wife Barbara,
is expected to be held next week. The Lord Provost's duties will be
undertaken meantime by his deputy, Councillor Tommy Dingwall.

A famous Glasgow architect took his inspiration from over the Atlantic
for this
secluded lochside house
IT'S a long way from America to Aberfoyle, but when one of Scotland's
most famous architects was asked to design a house for the shores of
Loch Ard he boldly took his inspiration from across the Atlantic.
Corrienessan House, a Victorian detached country house set in an acre
of ground by the loch, is one of the few private houses designed by Sir
John James Burnet, a distinguished Glasgow architect who, after studying
in France and visiting the USA, designed many important public
buildings.
They include the Clyde Navigation Trust building on the Broomielaw,
the Fine Art Institute on Sauchiehall Street, Barony Church on Castle
Street, the Athenaeum, and the Edward VII Gallery at the British Museum
in London. His major residential development in Glasgow was Charing
Cross Mansions.
Corrienessan House is listed Category B for its structural features
and is a vivid example of the breadth of Burnet's scope and ability. The
house is distinguished for its American influence and was much in
advance of its time.
Despite its substantial size, it seems to sit quietly on its lochside
site. It remains unaltered and is well preserved with original interior
wood finishes in oak, mahogany and Oregon pine. It enjoys an elevated
position with one of the finest views -- known as the Queen's View --
within the Queen Elizabeth Park, overlooking the eastern end of Loch Ard
and beyond to Ben Lomond. The River Forth forms the southern boundary
and the gardens provide plenty of spring and autumn colour.
The accommodation comprises: galleried hallway, gun room, morning
room, dining room, fitted kitchen, utility room, study, five principal
bedrooms, three bathrooms (two of which are en suite), two staff
bedrooms and bathroom, oil fired central heating, a colourful garden
with river frontage and fishing rights.
It has an impressive galleried hall providing direct access to all the
main rooms. It features original wood panelling and polished oak parquet
floor, it has a natural wood fireplace surround with tiled inset and a
hearth fitted with a magnificent dog gr ate.
Originally two separate rooms, the drawing room and morning room are
now linked by an impressive archway to form one large room with open
views onto the garden and beyond. The large west bay window from the
drawing room provides a view through to Loch Ard. The room features an
original Adam fireplace with a marble inset and hearth which is fitted
with a log burning open fire.
From the morning room, the south-facing bay window provides a splendid
view overlooking the garden with exotic rhododendrons. A notable feature
throughout this room is the natural wood finishes to doors, skirtings,
facings and the polished oak parquet floor.
The formal dining room has a large bay window providing a view of the
hill (Craigmore) behind the house.
The kitchen is well appointed and fitted with Poggenpohl mahogany
units.
The main bedroom has an en-suite dressing room and bathroom.
Originally two separate bedrooms, the bedroom and dressing room have
been linked by a curved archway but they could easily be made back into
two separate bedrooms. The west and south-facing windows provide views
of the garden, Loch Ard and beyond to Ben Lomond.
All fitted carpets are included in the selling price.
The house has oil fired central heating, which also heats the domestic
hot water, provided by a 600-gallon oil storage tank.
The colourful garden is one of the house's most outstanding features.
It is well stocked with rhododendrons, azaleas and ornamental trees.
There are interesting walks through the garden, and a path leads along
beside the River Forth. In total the garden extends to approximately one
acre and contains a summer house.
The property has riparian trout fishing rights on the River Forth and
rights on Loch Ard for two rods.
The nearby village of Aberfoyle provides good local facilities,
including a post office and bank. The area has excellent recreational
and sporting facilities including golf, pony trekking, nature trails,
water sports and fishing. Indoor swimming and leisure facilities are
available four miles away at Forest Hills.
Offers over #265,000 are invited via the Stirling office of estate
agents Allen &amp; Harris.

The Scot abroad is a sight indeed, and there were more than a few
sorry sights in Athens last month for the Tartan Army's latest overseas
posting. Richard Giulianotti ruefully reports on some of the headaches.
IT WAS Sophocles who observed that the good befriend themselves, but
some correction is needed if, according to Scotland's Tartan Army, he is
not to insult some of his fellow Athenians. The Scots may be well-known
internationally for their gregarious and raucous nature, ensuring
generous welcomes when they return to old stomping grounds overseas. On
the evidence of last month's trip to Athens, the 400 or so fans who
backed our losing national side will not be too disturbed if we fail to
draw Greece in future competitions.
I journeyed to Athens with Scotland Abroad, a travel company devoted
to moving Scottish supporters around the world for any fixture. The
company's founder and sole director, John Grigor, is an Ayr United
supporter, hard-core Tartan Army member, and part-time taxi-driver. He'd
advertised the trip as an attractive, long-weekend excursion (Friday to
Monday), at a total cost of #209 for the London-Athens return flights
(#80 additional transfer from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow). Hotels
would be arranged upon arrival.
However, a fortnight before the match, the departure date was brought
forward two days, due to being ''messed around'' by the tour operator's
bete noire (a courier working for a major flight company). The same
individual had, it seemed, earlier been responsible for hijacking rooms
in Malta pre-booked by Scotland Abroad for his more ''official'' party
of Scottish fans.
The rescheduling meant the numbers with Scotland Abroad dropped to 17,
as some fans struggled to balance work commitments. It also entailed
catching a packed 11pm flight from Heathrow with three other Scotland
Abroad fans who'd been advised of the wrong terminal by British Airways
in Glasgow. To our amazement, we were met at Athens (5am local time) by
the tour leader, who'd considerately been sampling the local bars on our
behalf. Personal recognition, however, was difficult, as he'd recently
shorn his hirsute cranium on the pretext of charity. (Credit: Children
in Need, #802. Debit: J Grigor, #20 police fine for no longer
maintaining an accurate taxi-driver photograph.)
The rest of the Scotland Abroad party, having flown out earlier, had
become otherwise engaged in suburban Athens, to which we were promptly
whisked. Our tour operator had taken up a recommendation to avoid the
city centre, and headed instead for Glyfada, 12 kilometres to the south,
near the airport. A hotel had been located at the uniform rate of #8 per
head per night, equipped with an all-night bar and within a 10-minute
walk from an avenue of alternatives.
Glyfada had been built on American money from the local airbase, now
closed. British and Irish expatriates later predicted a dire future for
its boulevards of banks, boutiques, and jewellers. It was certainly
little different from the remainder of Athens, in the local predilection
for driving cars advertising women's underwear and feeding stray dogs.
The latter's nocturnal medley of howls became a particular irritation to
those who were retiring to the hotel in a conscious condition.
For Glyfada's bars, there was little doubt that this relatively small
Scottish contingent offered a lucrative bonus to the summer trade. In
the Tiller Bar, happy hour lasted from noon until seven, and tended to
be augmented with the odd round of free drinks. Largely at the
instigation of the indefatigable Ally, the hungover fans who missed the
Under-21 match (kick-off, after all, was at 3pm) sought an unlikely
remedy in cocktails, one of which was appropriately termed ''Brain
Damage''. The night before they'd all been lured to stay in another pub
(Sussex One) until closing time (about 4am) by more free drinks and the
barmaids' astonishing attire.
This was not one of the best-attended away games, by a long chalk. The
timing of the match was hardly propitious, and fans were justifiably
critical. Given that the Tartan Army regularly receive SFA platitudes on
their importance to the team's performance, how could arranging a crunch
overseas match a week before Christmas help the national cause?
The effective doubling of flight prices over the festive period meant
that some hard-core fans simply could not make the trip. One, ''Mad
Dog'', had encountered a more untimely misfortune. The DSS had advanced
a #200 loan for a new cooker too quickly, and this had since been burnt
in North-east pubs. (Playing the system to join the Tartan Army is part
of its rogue culture. Remember the ''We Paid No Poll Tax'' banners in
Italy? How about the fan who called off from his ''signing on'' via a
mobile-phone in Tallin, Estonia?)
Those who did make it over included Jim from Ayrshire, complete with
Tartan teddy, and a regular since '74; Tommy from Glasgow, a walking
advert for his homestead, and strong on Rolf Harris impressions; and Big
Munro, there since Wembley '67, who sold his house to head for Mexico
'86, and whose planned retirement was never that likely. Filming all of
this, as ever, was Ronnie the camcorder man. Blackmail, thankfully for
most, is not his metier.
Although on a relatively small scale, therefore, the excursion itself
was based on the old carnival principles of drinking, talking, singing,
joking, and reminiscing. On a five-day break, at least one day of
respite would seem essential, but the medicinal properties of water were
inverted in Greece. As our tour leader/physician counselled: ''If you go
out and get pissed on the local oozo, crash out, and then drink a pint
of water the next day, you're absolutely ga-ga again.'' Expulsion may be
the only form of escape from mandatory excess, as wee Callum discovered
when he was physically ejected from the bar for drinking Coke.
While ensconced in the local hostelries, I had the chance to chat with
the garrulous Mr Grigor on Scotland Abroad's origins. Apparently, his
inspiration had come after the 1982 World Cup Finals, on calculating
that he and his wife had spent two months in Spain, under their own
auspices, for much the same outlay as one leading package company had
charged each fan for a mere 10 days. An advert was placed in the
Scottish press for the next away match, in Belgium, offering a #45 round
trip by coach, and two were filled within a week.
The ''hobby'' ethos of his outfit was forcibly dispensed with in 1989,
when tax considerations dictated that Scotland Abroad be converted into
official company status. However, little seems to have changed in the
type of recreation which it promotes. The cheapest packages available
are put together, usually by coach, with basic hotel accommodation
bartered down in price with the management. Membership of the Scotland
Travel Club is insisted upon, for practical rather than ethical reasons;
tickets rather than sobriety can be in shorter supply for major
fixtures. There are 2200 fans on the company's database, and not one
will have travelled for a quiet, retiring break.
Not that Scotland Abroad's tours ignore the cultural heritage of the
lost city. All of the party at one time or another ventured through
Glyfada to the Acropolis, although to a man but one they were less than
entranced by its majesty. ''Load of old rubble,'' observed one. ''Put a
price in to see and repair it,'' suggested another. ''They'll give you
another two thousand years to get it out of that state.''
Prior excursions with the Tartan Army suggest some variations in the
types of fans who predominate, according to the appeal of the fixture.
When the overseas support is low as in Greece, Scottish fans tend to be
older, and be employed in more skilled manual work or self-employed. The
'92 Euro Finals in Sweden and Italia '90, by contrast, saw a greater
proportion of younger fans, in white-collar work or further education.
Equally, there are variations in the clubs supported by the fans. Hearts
fans appeared to be particularly prominent in Athens, perhaps as
compensation for their absence from Europe this year.
Politically, of course, Scottish football is famously denigrated for
its cathartic function regarding any ''break-up'' of Britain. The same
is said elsewhere, of the game's function, for example, in unifying a
fractious Italy. Whereas Berlusconi used the soccer mantra Forza Italia
(''Go Italy'') with some political success, it is difficult to conceive
of any nationalist seizing upon the legend F . . . the English with
similar alacrity.
Moreover, there is understandably less interest among supporters in
considering questions of alternative national identity. Some fans were
justifiably critical of a survey undertaken by a Glasgow University
researcher at the Under-21 game. As one fan from Dunfermline explained:
''The thing was about eight pages long, and it took you about 10 minutes
to fill in. The first page was about football, but the rest was about
things like sectarianism in Glasgow, what you thought about Catholic
schools, and the troubles in Ireland, and who you thought was
responsible. What's Ireland got to do with being a Scottish supporter?
Not a thing.''
At the same match, the Scots also got their first pointer on any
potential violence at the full international. The subject had been
widely debated, then consciously forgotten about, beforehand -- the word
was, the Greeks were adept at lobbing missiles into the opposing fans'
ends (with bulging bags of urine a particular speciality). Here,
however, the most direct hit by the distant locals was a lump of rock
landing on an irate member of the riot police. After the match, and to
the chagrin of some of their elders, younger Scottish fans chased 15 or
so jeering local youths.
As Doug from Fife argued: ''I wasn't keen on what some of the younger
Scotland fans were doing. They don't know what it's about yet. Going up
to the fence and saying, 'Come on, then, you bastards', or running at
them, that's not the way we do things, you know. They weren't really
bothering us at all; if they are, you just start outsinging them, that
gets to them even more.''
Prior to the main attraction the next evening, Scottish fans had
wandered around outside the Olympic Stadium, unaware of where their gate
number was located. Inevitably, young local fans ''wound up'' the Scots,
shouting into their faces, while the riot police contented themselves
elsewhere with guarding puddles. On the metro, a Londoner teaching
English in Athens had his chin slashed, another fan had his flag nicked
and waved at him inside the ground. Inside the ground, however, the poor
home support were again too far off for missiles to land; instead, the
Greeks' spectacular rockets and flares were a bigger danger to their
players and fellow fans. After the match, the police escort through a
housing estate led us to three Scotball (the SFA's tour operators)
coaches and, in an unprecedented move, the invitation of a lift was
gratefully accepted.
The offer came too late for a group of fans who had headed off for the
metro. Their journey was punctuated by one local throwing a rock of ice
at them, another a large dustbin, and, in the one real episode of
violence, an exchange of blows between a single Scot and a local.
Several fans compared the atmosphere to that of Lisbon in April of last
year, but worse. None had anything particularly positive to say of the
local fans, while others criticised the SFA's security officer for being
on the midnight flight home with the Scottish squad.
Recounting their experiences in the bars later that night at least
delayed examining another losing performance by the team. The fans had
given noisy support throughout the game, particularly during the first
half, when their singing had been regularly whistled down by the poor
local support.
But for most fans, neither the match nor its atmosphere were their
abiding memory of Athens; rather its pollution and lack of hospitality.
In the words of one supporter: ''The place is a cowp, and they're always
in about your money.'' Inebriated or hungover, Scots were particularly
at the mercy of Athens con men whose larceny was positively artistic --
too subtle for our national team, who are simply done over at hotels,
airports, and any other stadia.
The ''accidental'' meeting in the street would begin on a seemingly
innocent and convivial basis. Stopping to ask the time in Greek, then
English (is there nothing new under the sun?), the ''host'' would soon
be showing the visitor (for he is best alone) around the nearby sites
while talking serious football. Insisting on his ''business card'', the
local then leads his prey to a nearby ''pub'' (daytime bar, nocturnal
brothel), where an advancing bevvy of coquettes set about pouring
themselves luxury cocktails at the victim's expense.
By the time costs have been ascertained, the barman moves in for the
coup de grace. Payment of one 5000 drachma note (about #13) is switched
for a small bill (perhaps 500 drachma), and the tourist must meet the
adjustment. Several Scots fell foul of this racket, with a #50 loss
reckoned to be not too heavy, one supporter, from Clydebank, was somehow
stung for around #100 twice.
A more appreciative reception is expected on the next major Scotland
Abroad ventures -- a flight to Moscow (late March), and coach to San
Marino (April). A chartered ferry to the Faroe Isles in June is also
being mulled upon, but not the boat to Japan for the possible friendly
in May. In the meantime, if the sentiment of the Scots in Greece is any
indicator, there's little immediate prospect of the Elgin Marbles being
''returned'' voluntarily, although now that you mention our Duke of
Edinburgh . . .

GONE are the days when a rug was just for putting in front of the
hearth. They provide a fine way to brighten up any room; you can find
rugs for living rooms, kitchens, bedrooms, and bathrooms -- just about
anywhere.
The carpet or rug as a part of interior decoration has a history
dating back hundreds of years. The earliest known rug was found in a
grave in Siberia and is some 2500 years old.
Traditionally, rugs can be identified by their design and by the
colours used, and they are known by the town where they were originally
made, or by the name of the tribe which first wove them.
Carpets, or rugs, were probably first introduced into Britain in the
thirteenth century. Initially they were used as bed-covers, table covers
and wall-hangings, rather than as floor coverings. In those days, the
term ''carpet'' was used to describe all these uses -- table carpet,
wall carpet, etc. It was not really until the sixteenth century that
carpets or rugs were used more as floor coverings.
You can find exquisite rugs from China, India, Iran and Turkey for a
luxurious look. These rugs, usually hand-made, may cost several hundred,
if not thousands, of pounds. Antique oriental rugs are much sought after
and often bought as investments as well as for their intrinsic beauty.
More modern oriental rugs need not be as expensive, although you can
still pay several hundred pounds, depending on the size and the
materials used.
For those on a tighter budget, the choice of inexpensive, attractive
rugs is excellent. You can opt for rugs which have a pile, where the
material has been knotted and then cut, or for a flat-weave rug; these
are known by different names according to the country of origin --
kilims, usually made from wool, come from Iran, Afghanistan and Turkey;
durries, generally 100% cotton, from India.
Flat-weave rugs can also be used as wall-hangings, and are ideal also
for draping over a chair or sofa to give them a new lease of life.
My first stop was Habitat, where I found colourful cotton and wool
rugs in all shapes and sizes, many with distinctive patterns. Striped
cotton rag rugs in blues, greens or multi-coloured cost #25.00. One
hundred per cent cotton chenille rugs, 90 x 150cm, also from #25.00,
come in blues, greens and naturals, also in check. Rugs with pictures
woven into the design, splendid for children's rooms, start at around
#49.00 for 120 x 160cm, 80% wool, 20% cotton.
Habitat stock hand-woven Indian kilims, 100% cotton, prices start at
#79.00 for 120 x 160cm. Look for their colourful haseena rugs, plain,
checked or striped, from #19.50 for 90 x 150cm.
Ikea also have a wide selection of rugs, with designs ranging from the
traditional to the more modern. Prices start at #3.90 for a cotton rug,
60 x 90cm. Or you could spend #4.90 on a slightly larger rag rug, 65 x
130cm.
A handwoven durrie in 100% cotton, which is reversible and measures
approximately 120 x 180cm (4' x 6'), will cost #14.00.
Galerie Mirages is a good place for brightly coloured kelims, durries
and haseen rugs. Many are modern, but they also have rugs which are up
to 100 years old. Look for their Maimana kilims, originally from
Afghanistan but now woven in northern Pakistan, recognisable by their
bold geometric patterns. Prices from #35.00.
Here you will also find cotton haseen rugs, measuring 90 x 50cm, for
#16.95, rag rugs from #10.95, and cotton durries from #5.50; for
something more special, their stone-washed designer cotton rugs, 180cm x
120cm, cost #200.
As an unusual alternative, Galerie Mirages have traditional textile
rugs which were originally used as saddle bags or salt bags. Some of
these have been opened out. Others are still recognisably bags, which
can be filled with cushions and used as a sofa seat; they also make very
striking wallhangings, sofa coverings or floor rugs.
The bag faces combine different rug-making styles. One of which is the
knotted, cut pile familiar in the West, and a flat weave known as soumak
which gives a three-dimensional effect.
World of Rugs is a good source of modern Oriental rugs; here you will
find coverings from China, Iran, Turkey and India on display, and owner
Bill Price has access to hundreds more. His stock includes kelims and
haseen rugs, rag rugs and traditional hand-tufted rugs in silks and
wool.
You will also find machine-made rugs from Bangladesh. These are made
from jute, which has the appearance of wool, but is less expensive at
#195 for 12 x 9', and hand-tufted pure wool designer rugs from India in
more abstract, western designs, which cost #250 for 9 x 6'.
Mr Price is happy to let potential customers take rugs home before
their final purchase, to be sure they are happy with their choice.
At World of Rugs you will find some older rugs too; the appearance of
oriental rugs improves with age and wear, giving a more subtle effect to
the patterns and colours. You can expect to pay more for older oriental
rugs than for the modern equivalent.
Dry cleaning is the recommended method for cleaning any type of wool
or cotton rug. World of Rugs recommend that pile rugs should be cleaned
using the latest chemical process, known as Chemdry, a service they can
provide. Both Ikea and Habitat's rugs should be dry-cleaned.

As a prelude to a new Scottish TV series on the eighties, David
Belcher looks back in angst at the fights and the fashions of 1980.
AN impressionistic eight-part social history series begins tomorrow
night on Scottish Television. Year by year from 1980 onwards, Time of
Your Life will link archive film and Scottish contemporary music in
order to convey some of the flavour of life as it was lived through the
eighties.
And week by week, Herald Weekender will be highlighting some of the
events to be featured in each edition of Time of Your Life. Tune in to
what might, in reference to another TV pop-history series, be termed the
Jock 'n' Roll Years, beginning 15 years ago . . .
It is 1980 and we re-live Scotland's soccer-shocker shame as a new
decade gets well under way. Simply observe the gallus Rangers
pitch-invader as he bids, with a dismissive backward glance, to convince
the baton-wielding mounted polis that he can outpace their horses across
the Hampden greensward, nae bother at a'.
Nope, we are not coming over all horror-stricken and moralistic about
the after-match battle which marred that year's Old Firm Scottish Cup
final. What is scandalous here is that fully three years after the
punk-rock revolution made drainpipe-trousers de rigueur, Glasgow's
Terracing Tams were still wearing old-fashioned mega-flappy flares.
Sheena Easton was in the news when an Esther Rantzen TV show turned
her into an overnight star. Not unnaturally, Wee Sheena can be heard
trilling on Time of Your Life's soundtrack. But aside from the belle of
Bellshill, what will we discern about Scottish pop from re-hearing it as
it was in 1980?
As a new wave gathered momentum, the old one crested. Honed by years
on stage and folk-club circuit, Barbara Dickson hymned the winter months
of January, February. Seasoned emigre songwriter B A Robertson bit the
hand that was most likely to feed him by mocking the foibles of the
London recordbiz. The Average White Band let us go round again, one last
time, to their Caledonian funk.
But there were fresh sounds rooted in Scottish self-determination.
Instead of looking slavishly to America, like most of their musical
predecessors north of the Border, Simple Minds and Josef K looked to
Europe. And Orange Juice looked no further than themselves for
inspiration. If only there could have been as harmonious an outcome in
the fight for the Scottish steel industry . . .

HOGMANAY celebrations in Scotland have always been that wee bit
special. The world seems to know we do it better than most. Since 1599,
when James VI decided to fall in line with other ''well-governit
commonwealths'' like France and have New Year's Day on January 1 instead
of March 25, we've never looked back.
It's an interesting sideline that it took England until 1752 to catch
up with this enlightened move and to adjust their civil and legal
calendar correspondingly.
The records suggest that in Scotland no matter what calamity and
strife faced the nation, New Year was pinpointed as a time of serious
fun. Witness the first day of 1666 when it was reported: ''Despite the
plague raging in London there was as much drinking and carousin' on
January 1 as in previous years.''
But it wasn't always frolics and feery-farry, and the end of a great
Scottish tradition, almost an institution, traipsing round the
neighbourhood with the wassail cup, usually a kettle brimming with hot
spiced ale, can be traced to an infamous Hogmanay riot on January 1,
1812 in Edinburgh.
I first got on the track of this event on reading a report of New Year
festivities in Glasgow a couple of decades later when it was recorded
that New Year was ushered in at Glasgow Cross in the traditional style
with the intriguing addendum that the crowd showed ''not the slightest
tendency to riot''. Tumultuous behaviour at the bells was presumably
commonplace, but might there be something more here? Indeed there was.
It seems that as the 1800s dawned the custom of the wassail bowl or
cup was widely indulged in, to such an extent that in the early hours of
New Year's Day, city-centre streets were far busier than they ever were
at midday, particularly in Edinburgh. A happy time was had by all or, as
one Victorian chronicler so neatly states: ''Much innocent mirth
prevailed and mutual good feelings were largely promoted.'' That was
until the first day of 1812.
A gang of youths plotted to turn this jollification to their
advantage, realising that first-footing offered them a unique
opportunity to catch people off their guard. No sooner had the first New
Year revellers begun to appear on the streets than the boys split into
small gangs. Their modus operandi was to seek out gentlemen wearing
white neckcloths, reckoning this identified individuals in the dark
streets, wynds and closes, who would most likely be carrying property
worth lifting.
The reporter on the scene records that: ''A great number of gentlemen
were thus spoiled of their watches and other valuables and the least
resistance was resented by the most brutal maltreatment.''
Two victims who put up a fight -- a police officer and a young clerk
from Leith -- died from their injuries. There was surprise, indignation,
and disgust among the citizens of Edinburgh when news filtered out of
these night attacks, the ruination of the New Year festivities. Three
young men were executed for their part in this orgy of violence but it
was noted that the old custom of wassail, going about with the hot pint,
never regained the same popularity.
Incidentally, I have, rather belatedly for this Hogmanay I fear,
unearthed a splendid but wee bit lengthy recipe for making this auld
Scots wassailbowl. Drop me a line if you're interested. Between us we
might get one vanished tradition up and running again.

A lorry driver's life can be dull and arduous -- but it also has its
share of compensations. Ninian Dunnett hears from three employees of a
North-east firm.
WHERE would we be without the lorry drivers? Short of four-fifths of
everything we eat and drink, everything we buy, everything we use in our
work. The withering of the railways has left goods transport in the
hands of the road hauliers -- from owner-operators with a single lorry
to big companies with several hundred.
Sandy Bruce Trucking in Aberdeen runs goods -- perhaps Branston
Pickles from Nestle's in Peterhead, or envelopes from the Aberdeen paper
mills -- to towns and ports all over Britain and the Continent.
The company has grown from one lorry to 35 in 12 years. One of its
drivers, Neil Craig is 30.
N C: ''I've always wanted to be a lorry driver. I suppose glamour
would be a part of it -- just up and down the road, and your own boss,
kind of thing. And I got my test for my 21st birthday from my mum and
dad -- I was working on the farm at the time -- and it's been grand.
''I must do 2000-odd miles in a week, and you do get attached to your
lorry. I've got quite a few tapes -- music can be the best way to pass
the time when you're driving -- and I like my rock and roll, and the
stuff from the seventies. I've just started running to Europe, France,
and Spain and Italy, and you get about a wee bit, seeing the different
places, and how different people live. And I've managed so far,
communicating with sign language and things.
''People don't really like lorry drivers, though. You get quite a lot
of hassle. Sometimes you have to sit a long time and wait if you're
unloading at a shop, or if you're double-parked you get a lot of hassle
from motorists and just everybody, really. But I just plod away and get
on with it. And you get quite a lot of hassle from the police, and the
commissioners, they can pop up anywhere and stop you for roadside checks
and that.
''But I wouldn't think of doing anything else. I got married not too
long ago, and I speak to my wife every night on the telephone. It
doesn't do a lot for your home life -- she does get a bit lonely
sometimes -- but as long as it wasn't going to come between me and her,
I wouldn't change it.''
David Sey is 34.
D S: ''My father was a lorry driver, and I used to go away with him
down south and that when I was younger; I thought it was great. The
saying is, once it's in your blood, that's it -- and I think it's a bit
like that. Once you do long distance, you can't get away from it.
''The roads have got a lot better over the years, but the traffic's
got a lot worse. I hate the A1 from Edinburgh to Newcastle. But I've not
had much in the way of accidents. A few months ago a woman came down the
wrong side of a dual carriageway; she'd misunderstood the roadworks. I
went into the side of her; but she was lucky, she just had cuts and
that.
''The lorries are better now as well. Mine's a Man 38-tonner, the
biggest you can get without going on to a low-loader, with an escort.
I've got my own TV and fridge in the cab, phone and CB and radio
cassette. And the bed sits behind the two seats.
''You're usually away on a Sunday and back on a Friday, and you don't
often get home during the week. You get to know where the good places
are to stop for the night, the clean truck stops where you'll get a
shower and something decent to eat.
''I wouldn't like to go into what some drivers do about the
tachograph, but there's far too much of it goes on. The cowboys are
cutting corners, and drivers are having to run bent just to do the job.
It keeps the pay down and all the rest of it for everybody.''
Jim Cooper is 33.
J C: ''The best time in this job is in the summertime, if you get a
wee run up the Black Isle there, or down the West Country, and there's
no rush, a nice summer's day just cruising along down there quietly.
Most of the time you're chasing against the book, and you get customers
giving you a bit of earache if you deliver wrong goods or damaged or
something, and it's not your fault. But you get paid your weekly wage,
and then your time-and-a-half, about 25 hours, and double on a Sunday.
It's a lonely life as well, you could say; most of the time you're on
your own. But you meet quite a few rogues, and associates that you pick
up over the years.''

WINTER has its consolations. The darker the day, the better the
feeling of curling up at home in front of the fire. This is the season
when the fireplace comes into its own, although many would argue that it
provides a warm, focal point for the living room all year round.
If you are already happy with your solid fuel, gas or electric fire,
but still want to make more of your fireplace, then a new fire surround
could solve the problem. If your home has suffered during clumsy
renovations, an appropriate fire surround could restore the fireplace to
its former glory.
If you have grand decorative ambitions, it could recreate the look of
a particular era. And if you feel that your well-insulated and
well-heated modern home still lacks ''warmth'', there are handsome fire
surrounds available to suit contemporary interiors.
Architectural salvage yards, junk shops and antique shops are an
obvious place to start if you are searching for old wooden or cast iron
fireplaces. If you want to follow this route, it is worthwhile investing
in the SALVO Pack, available from SALVO, the association of
architectural salvage yards, for #5.75.
This comprises a directory of salvage yards in your area, together
with a special supplement on fireplaces with a helpful introduction and
a list of stock held by local yards. Contact SALVO at 1, The Cottage,
Ford Woodhouse Farm, Berwick-upon-Tweed, TD15 2QF, tel: 01668 6494.
In Glasgow, Great Western Road is a good hunting ground for antique
and reproduction fireplaces. Slightly battered old pine fireplaces,
which could be sanded and finished at home, are available from #50 to
#80 at Winton Glazing and Landsdowne Antiques.
Backstreet Pine have handsome fireplaces for around #500, and
Something Special have a good range of antique fireplaces including
Edwardian oak and mahogany for between #400 and #900. Something Special
are also able to supply made-to-measure brass fenders and guards, and
reproduction Victorian and Edwardian tiles for inside the surround.
If a cast-iron fire surround appeals, contact Acquisitions Fireplaces
in London at 4-6 Jameston Road, London NW1 7BY, tel: 071-482-2949. They
supply a range of ornate, black, cast-iron fire surrounds in an Art
Nouveau style, costing around #1500. Modus Design (tel: 0923-210442), on
the other hand, specialise in sharp, contemporary designs for modern
settings. Their fire surrounds are pricier, at around #2500.
Although most homes will allow some leeway, it is important to remain
true to the fundamental character of your house. This can sometimes be
difficult, particularly if you live in an area with a very cogent and
distinctive architectural heritage.
Original neo-classical chimney pieces from Edinburgh's New Town, for
instance, are now very difficult to find, and incredibly expensive. Many
were ripped out during ''renovations'' in the 1960s, and were still
being sold off cheaply a decade later.
Now New Town home owners are keen to restore the fire surrounds but
inflated prices and a ready market in America, where the original Adam
designs became popular around 1800, has encouraged the proliferation of
specialist thieves and a flourishing illegal export trade -- hardly
ideal buying conditions for the restoring owner.
One solution to the problem is to contact Kelso-based firm Thistle and
Rose at Smailholm House, by Kelso, Roxburghshire TD5 7PQ, tel/fax: 0573
460232. Partners David Black and Kim Roberts produce exact replicas of
the shallow-relief neo-classical chimney pieces which were made in
Edinburgh from 1760 to 1830.
They make the surrounds entirely by hand, using the original
production methods and materials. Scotch pine frames support the
trademark swags of flowers and fruit, ornamental friezes, and classical
columns, all carved in a gesso called Adam's composition (Black found
the original recipe in the Victoria and Albert Museum). The results
should be indistinguishable from the originals. Prices range from under
#1000 to around #2000.

You can do almost anything with an American-style muffin -- and it
makes a tasty treat at any time of the day, says Catherine Brown.
IN THE way that movie stars adjust their names to suit their style,
the cook-book writer appears on the front cover as Gloria Ambrosia. Fits
well, don't you think, for her latest book: Gloria's Glorious Muffins.
This is America -- where else -- but ''Gloria'' is no fake when it
comes to baking muffins. She is ahead of the game in style and
innovative ideas, for what she has written is a rundown of one of
America's most comforting eating traditions which depends on the highly
versatile, easy-to-make muffin.
Learn the muffin habit, and you can join in Gloria's crazy enthusiasm
for experimenting. You like French onion soup -- well, make a muffin of
it. This will only work, though, with the big, high-domed cup-cake
American muffins which appear on breakfast menus along with pancakes and
maple syrup.
The flat, yeast-raised English muffin is a more sedate, less flexible
affair. A girdle-baked teabread with a craggy interior, it is
traditionally toasted at the fireside and served with melted butter and
tea on cold winter nights. Which explains why the Hot Muffin Cafe in
London's Fulham Road has not taken to serving traditional English
muffins, but operates a continuous-baking of hot-out-the-oven high-domed
American muffins for eating-in or taking away.
Like pancakes, they depend on nothing more than assembling the
ingredients and mixing a batter. Their appeal is the treat of hot baking
for breakfast. No, not just for breakfast, says Gloria. You must think
muffins for elevenses, lunch, teabreaks, dinner, and supper. Once the
habit gets a grip, it's compulsive.
Muffin tins or paper cases: most muffin tins make 12 high-domed
muffins. American muffin tins are now widely available in kitchen and
hardware shops. The best are non-stick. Paper muffin cups are also
available. Twelve will serve six for a main meal. Leftovers can be
frozen.
American muffins are about double the size of traditional British cup
cakes. Use half quantity of the recipe with a 12-size British cup-cake
tray for half-size muffins.
For speed, all measuring is done in US cups -- 1 cup = 8 fl oz/250 ml.
Sets of graduated cups are available, but it is also possible to use a
teacup which holds 8 fl oz.
Unlike cakes, muffins are tolerant to variations in quantities.
Providing the final mixture is adjusted -- with extra flour if it is too
runny, or more liquid if it is too stiff -- missing out an ingredient or
changing the quantity slightly, according to taste or availability, will
not harm the finished result.
CHEESE AND MUSTARD MUFFINS (with self-raising flour)
Change the mustard for chutney. Change the cheese for grated onion or
chopped red peppers or corn kernels. Change the white flour for
wholemeal. Find good flavour combinations to go with soup, cheese, cold
meat . . .
Yield: 12 large high-domed muffins.
Dry ingredients:
2 cups light (for cakes) self-raising flour
[1/2] teaspoon sea salt.
Wet ingredients:
1 cup milk
[1/4] cup olive oil
1 egg
1-2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
4 oz (125 g) grated sharp cheddar cheese.
Method: Preheat the oven to 400F/200C/gas 6.
Sift the dry ingredients twice into a large bowl. Whisk the wet
ingredients together (saving two tablespoons cheese for topping) and
pour into the dry ingredients. Spoon into prepared tins, sprinkle
remaining cheese on top and bake for 15-20 minutes. Cool in the baking
tins for five minutes and remove from tins. Serve warm.
DATE AND APPLE MUFFINS (with sour cream and baking soda)
Neil Rieley lives alone in a remote Highland glen miles from a baker,
and puts a tray of these muffins in the oven for visitors while he is
boiling the kettle for tea. If there happen to be any leftovers, they
are put in a bag and handed to you as you leave.
Using soda with an acid-like sour cream or buttermilk produces the
lightest muffins. Milk which has been soured with lemon juice can also
be used.
Yield: 12 high-domed muffins.
6 dates, stoned and halved
Dry ingredients:
2 cups plain flour, or wholemeal
1 teaspoon baking soda
[1/4] teaspoon sea salt
Wet ingredients:
1 cup sour cream, yoghurt or buttermilk
[1/2] cup vegetable oil
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla essence
1 cup grated eating apple (about 2-3 apples).
Method: Preheat the oven to 400F/200C/gas 6. Oil muffin tin and place
half a date into the base of each tin. Sift the dry ingredients twice,
into a bowl. Beat the wet ingredients together. Pour wet ingredients
into dry and mix to a stiff dropping consistency. Spoon into tins. Bake
15-20 minutes.
Leave in tin for five minutes. Serve warm.
BLACK OLIVE AND HERB CHEESE MUFFINS (using baking powder)
Yield: 12 large, high-domed muffins.
Dry ingredients:
2 cups plain flour
2 heaped teaspoons baking powder
Salt and freshly ground white pepper
Wet ingredients:
1 large egg
1 cup milk
5 oz (150 g) herb-flavoured soft cheese
2 tablespoons finely chopped spring onions or chives
[1/4] cup olive oil
[1/2] cup pitted chopped black olives.
Method: Preheat oven to 400F/200C/gas 6. Oil muffin tin. Sift dry
ingredients. Mix wet ingredients and mix into dry to make a stiff,
dropping consistency. Spoon into muffin tin and bake 15-20 minutes.
Serve warm with an omelette.

STAIRS and corridors are often overlooked when it comes to designing
or redecorating a home, yet they offer interesting possibilities for
imaginative treatment that can really make an impression.
In the past, narrow spiral staircases in medieval castles eventually
gave way to grander, broader stairs that allowed those passing up and
down to see and be seen. In grand country houses a showy staircase has
always been in demand; the wider and more curved the better.
Moreover, the best chandelier was often saved for the staircase. Here
high society could stop and linger or make a grand entrance or exit. In
Gone with the Wind, the elaborate stairway in Tara enabled huffy
Scarlett O'Hara to flounce dramatically upstairs to her boudoir at the
drop of an Easter bonnet.
At one time, when personal privacy was not highly valued, it was usual
for one room to open directly into another, so that there was an
inconvenient procession of residents and servants through bedrooms.
In the eighteenth century, houses began to be designed with corridors
to allow more privacy. They soon became a place to be punctuated with
some of the less interesting suits of armour and paintings that could
not find a home in the main rooms, although there are one or two
exceptions.
The remarkable Grand Corridor at Windsor Castle is hundreds of yards
long and displays some of the most valuable works of art in the royal
ocllection. The Queen has lined the corridor leading to her private
apartments in Buckingham Palace with illuminated display cases
containing many of the pieces of crystal that she has received over the
years.
But what about stairs and corridors in ordinary homes? Very often
people feel that there is not much they can do with a staircase. Stairs,
half-landings and corridors are perhaps the most neglected part of the
average home.
They needn't be, however. No matter how narrow a stair is it affords a
lot of bare wall space crying out to be used.
The staircase of any home makes for an ideal picture gallery. Think of
the portraits of former prime ministers that line the staircase of No 10
Downing Street. A lot of small pictures on a staircase wall is one
option. Hanging a long banner or rug on a staircase wall is one way of
using the unique vertical potential of a staircase wall.
Alternatively, you may prefer to mount a selection of collected plates
which makes a pattern in a group. One large piece of artwork at the top
of the staircase or on a half-landing also makes for a very dramatic
effect.
A dull, blank wall at the end of a corridor has of necessity to be
gazed upon, and is the ideal spot to hang a favourite picture. A mirror
at the end of a corridor lessens any claustrophobic feel.
If you are lucky enough to have a window in your staircase or hall the
whole interior space can be transformed by attaching brightly coloured
stencils to the glass or painting the glass to give a stained glass
effect. When the sun shines into the house, the space is filled with
delightful splashes of rich colour on walls and floors.
A boxed-in stair can dominate a hall. A thin bannister rail can give a
less claustrophobic feel. You can even remove the bannister altogether
to make a feature of the natural zig-zag of the stair treads. A
bannisterless staircase may give a very modern and casual look, but is
obviously not advisable if you have children or people of a timid
disposition in the house.
Too often a corridor is dark, featureless and poorly lit. One answer
is to use spotlights to create small pools of light along the walls and
give a sense of progression to someone walking through.
Since no one spends much time in a corridor, one innovative lighting
scheme is to illuminate it with a permanent mood light on a dimmer
switch in unexpected colours such as purple or red, to give an exotic,
warm atmosphere that contrasts with the brighter illumination of rooms.

THOSE who think nothing of spending #20 on cosmetics could invest in
lasting glamour for less. Fortuny by Guillermo de Osma (Rizzoli/Aurum
Press, #17.95) is an evocatively illustrated paperback. It captures the
shimmering allure of Fortuny's legendary gowns and wraps, the society
women and high bohemians who wore them and the Venice of Fortuny's day
(1871-1949).
Escapism to Paris via words and stunning pictures is Chanel the
Couturiere at Work by Amy de la Haye and Shelley Tobin (Victoria &amp;
Albert Museum, #16.95). This chronicles the life and work of Coco Chanel
and the simply luxurious style of the couture house she founded.
More down-to-earth than any of the above is Gimbel's 1915 Fashion
Catalog (Dover/Constable, #14.95). Early American mail order has a
nostalgic innocence. The words tell as they sell as they teach. ''This
charming morning frock'' is ''suitable for neighborly visiting'' and
''the slightly draped blouse overlays a filmy net lace vestee''. Also a
delight is Children's Fashions 1860-1912 (Dover/Constable, #10.95),
detailed illustrations from that ''encyclopaedia of comme il faut'', the
French fashion paper, La Mode Illustree.
Nowadays every second student seems to be doing Business Studies, a
thing once unheard of. Dealing with the promotion of clothing, Fashion
Marketing by Janet Bohdanowiz and Liz Clamp (Routledge, #10.99) mixes
business with pleasure in a readable and well-presented book.

NOT all of the National Landscape awards at the British Association of
Landscape Industries (BALI) award-giving ceremony held in Glasgow
recently went to commercial, local authority or industrial projects,
writes IAN WALLS.
Indeed, a few went to delightful private garden projects.
The principal award for a domestic garden scheme under #10,000 was for
a small garden in Kew, with another garden in Newnham on Severn an award
winner too.
I recall that, many years ago, I helped to form a Scottish branch of
BALI.
The body now involves the majority of landscape firms in the UK and
sets rigid standards for execution of contracts.
It does a great job.

There's a revolution waiting to happen in the world of big-screen
technology -- but it has yet to proceed beyond the ignition stage.
CAPTAIN Michael McCulley, deputy director of Kennedy Space Center
launch site, had that easy, Texan-ish drawl common to pilots. It's the
one that Tom Wolfe, in The Right Stuff, traces back to test-pilot Chuck
Yeagar.
McCulley piloted the Nasa space shuttle Atlantis five years ago when
it sent the unmanned Galileo spacecraft off to visit Jupiter on behalf
of this small blue planet. Footage of that mission is the oldest part of
Nasa's latest promotional collaboration with the large-format movie
system, IMAX. The breathtaking infinities of space lend themselves to
showing off the scale of IMAX, so Captain McCulley found himself being
lent to the National Museum of Photography, Film, and Television at
Bradford.
He was charm itself, but was there just a hint that the mysteries of
IMAX technology are a side-show to a man with his experience? ''They
told me I'd need 25 hours of training to operate this complex camera.
But I have a kinda technical bent. Hell, I fly a space shuttle!''
Perhaps it's not a point-and-shoot job, but the real mystery about
IMAX -- or more particularly IMAX cinemas -- is why there are no more of
them in the UK. Bradford remains alone, which is the last thing that
those who run the operation there expected.
Jean Hunter, who was in charge of marketing there from its opening in
June 1983 through to 1993, said: ''At the time no-one thought we would
still be the only one. Our strategy was to establish it as an attraction
quickly before the opposition was organised.''
But although the idea has probably been floated in every major town
and city in the country as part of some development or other there have
been few serious proposals during the past decade. Now there are signs
that that is beginning to change.
The Museum of the Moving Image on London's South Bank has a #12.5m
project to build an IMAX flat-screen and 3D cinema to enhance its
cramped facilties. The National Museum of Wales hopes to build an IMAX
cinema, although its board recently decided that private-sector support
would have to be found to finance it, much to the chagrin of director
Colin Ford.
On the former Garden Festival site, Pacific Quay, the Glasgow
Development Agency-approved plans for redevelopment include an IMAX
cinema, and one has been proposed for a development at the Castle end of
the Royal Mile in Edinburgh.
Across Europe, Britain is lagging well behind the supply of the
cutting edge of cinema technology to the public. Alison Roden, the
administrator of Euromax, the IMAX corporation's continental arm, reels
off a list of cinemas, including two in Paris and one at the Futuroscope
theme park at Poitiers, in Vienna at the technical museum, at The Hague
and Rotterdam, in Munich, Madrid, and Seville. A new Cine Integral was
scheduled to open in Barcelona this Christmas, with three different
types of screen being interchangeable in the same auditorium.
But the economics of IMAX are difficult to make work and Bradford was
fortunate to be ahead of the game. The IMAX facility was seen as an
important element in establishing the museum as an attraction in a
relatively out-of-the-way place -- and one which had no real tradition
of film or photography.
The American company was very keen to have a UK outlet for its
copyright system (the name is, confusingly, often used as a generic term
for large-format cinema). The then director of the National Science
Museum (of which the NMPFT is a part), Dame Margaret Weston, was able to
negotiate a very favourable one-off deal with IMAX.
Jean Hunter worked on a catchment area of the six million people
within one-and-a-half hours' drive of Bradford. Up to 70% of the
museum's visitors, who total up to a 1992 peak of 824,000 a year, are
from that area, but only about a third of them visit the IMAX.
The current director of the National Science Museum, Neil Cossons, is
quite clear why Bradford has had no competition, despite all the talk,
and the reasons are purely economic. ''If you need the return of your
capital then building an IMAX cinema doesn't make any sense, and as a
stand-alone venture it is very difficult to sustain. But if the building
is free and it is linked to something else . . . ''
The repertoire of movies to show is obviously one of the main
problems. There are 100 IMAX cinemas world-wide and only about the same
number of films, and some of them are said to be not very good. The
Rolling Stones' recent concert film is one of only two that are
feature-length, because of the expense of production. Cossons thinks it
will be a long time before we are all enjoying an individual and
isolated virtual-reality future, but IMAX has a lot of catching up to do
to fill that gap.
The new Nasa film, Destiny in Space, the third part of a trilogy made
in collaboration with IMAX, is a case in point. It clocks in at around
40 minutes and had a smallish budget of $10m. Much of that 40 minutes is
not IMAX footage and some of the large-format footage is not live action
but computer simulation of possible futures in space, posing tricky
ecological problems like whether it would be correct to turn Mars into
an Earth annexe.
It is the actual film taken by Captain McCulley and his colleagues
that make the film breath-catching. From close-up footage of the launch
of the shuttle, the action moves to the deployment of a German
observation satellite on which an IMAX camera is attached, and from
which it was later retrieved. The huge screen shows pictures of the
battered exterior of the shuttle Discovery, a view that even the
astronauts had not seen.
Towards the end of the film it concentrates on the saga of the
deployment (by Discovery) and repair (by Endeavour a year ago) of the
Hubble Space Telescope. It is only then, when writer and editor Toni
Myers threw her shooting script out of the window, as it were, that the
film becomes truly absorbing as a narrative as well as a spectacle. The
fact that the movie is then able to show the results of the capabilities
of the repaired Hubble, detecting the formation of a new solar system in
the Orion Nebula, is the icing on the cake.
One is never less than conscious, however, that one is being sold
something, and that appears to the problem for the long life of
big-screen cinema. Bradford's IMAX programme changes only on a
six-monthly basis, and that is tied to the availablity of a new film.
Until the format is adopted for some purely artistic or entertainment
project -- as distinct from the shifting of units of rock 'n' roll
product -- it will never truly take off. Even the narration of Leonard
Nimoy and a reference to Kubrick's 2001 cannot disguise the fact that
Destiny in Space is really a long advert for Nasa, which, of course,
needs all the friends it can get.

GERANIUMS have come a long, long way since the days when they were
almost exclusively called pelargoniums.
There were well-known varieties such as Paul Crampel, Flower of
Spring, and many more. They were used for bedding display or for growing
on as pot plants.
These varieties are still around, in fact, and stocks can be readily
increased by taking cuttings in the autumn or from over-wintered plants
in early spring.
With the introduction of F1 hybrids, the ''in thing'' is to grow
geraniums from seed. You may find it rather confusing, by the way, to
look up a seed catalogue, and find that geraniums are listed under
annuals. They are, of course, half hardy perennials.
Some gardeners have found geraniums tricky to grow from seed. I have
never found this. The seed is large enough to be handled easily.
Although it has a hard coating, or testa, the seeds germinate with
ease provided you space-sow them. Give them a good brisk temperature
also, of at least 72-74 F.
This is something which can be readily achieved in a propagating case,
or near a radiator at a light window.
I find the best way is to sow half a dozen seeds in a 4-5in pot, poked
in just below the surface of the compost, which is well watered. The pot
is put in a clear poly-bag. This keeps humidity high and reduces the
risk of over-watering or of drying out.
To raise decent-sized plants, you should be busy sowing seed within
the next two or three weeks. Otherwise, you won't produce large enough
plants for bedding out in May.
Once the seed has germinated and is growing strongly, remove the pots
from the poly-bag. You can then grow on in a cooler regime.
Germinating at lower temperatures, they will take their own time.
Sometimes I find the seed rots before it germinates. To overcome this,
you can buy primed seed. Although more expensive, it is a good buy. The
seed will germinate at lower temperatures. It is also coated with a
fungicide to deal with any rot.
Once the seedlings are large enough to handle, they can be put into
3-4in pots, with potting compost, and brought on gradually in a well-lit
place.
If you don't want the bother of raising from seed, you can always buy
seedlings or pot-ready plants. These are available around April,
particularly for the pot-ready plants.
Geraniums make an ideal bedding plant. If you have a hot, dry sunny
bed, this is ideal. The hotter, the better, in fact. Just like summer.

Mark McLellan assesses the prospects for stargazers for the month of
January.
THE southern sky this month will reward you with many bright stars and
popular constellations. Try to distinguish the colour variations of the
brighter objects. Betelgeuse and Aldebaran are red, with Capella
displaying a yellow tint. Rigel is blue which leaves the others white.
Sirius is white and it is the brightest star in the sky. (For the
southern sky use the chart as it appears and if you want to look north
turn the chart upside-down and read from ''Looking North''.)
You should find Saturn low in the western sky early in the evening,
although its position is becoming unfavourable for observation. As the
constellations rise from the east you will notice a particularly bright
object lying close to the star Regulus in Leo. This is Mars and it will
reach opposition next month. It shines at magnitude -1.2 so it is quite
bright and clearly red in colour.
As you leave for work early in the morning you may have noticed Venus
shining dominantly in the south-eastern sky. As the daylight hours
approach this planet will look fantastic competing with the light.
Back home our own planet earth was at perihelion on Wednesday, January
4. This means we are at our closest to the sun at a distance of 147
million kilometres.
CONSTELLATION THIS MONTH
AT LAST we have the most splendid of all the winter constellations. It
almost fills the entire southern sky with its distinct features. This is
Orion (the Hunter). In mythology it was his arrogance that led to his
downfall. He had not considered the deadly sting of the scorpion when he
claimed he could defeat any animal on earth. Now he lies in the sky at a
safe distance from Scorpius and you will find both in the sky at the
same time.
The constellation itself is not difficult to find. The star Betelgeuse
is a brilliant Red Giant star and you should be able to detect the
colour. Rigel is a double star and blue-white in colour. The separation
of the two should be possible with smaller telescopes.
The belt of Orion is not a straight line of stars. Close observation
with the naked eye should offset Mintaka from the other two. This layout
is remarkably similar to the Pyramids in Egypt.
Orion is also the home of the Horsehead Nebula and of course the Orion
Nebula (M42). The Horsehead is a dark nebula and only photography can
bring out the intricate pattern. The Orion Nebula is an easy find and
even on clear nights the naked eye should detect the fuzzy features.

GREENHOUSES are devices intended to lengthen the gardening season and
enable plants to be produced which would not normally survive out of
doors. Yet the majority of greenhouses stand virtually idle from October
to March, mainly due to the ever-increasing cost of fuel and the poor
winter light.
Little wonder that many have turned to windowsill gardening as a means
of keeping their hand in. It is remarkable what can be achieved, though
there are considerations to kept in mind.
There is inconvenience, as seed trays, plant pots, and other
accoutrements take up space. On top of this, there is the problem of
containing surplus water, staining windowsills or carpets.
Another problem can be what to do at night, when you have the
windowsill loaded up with gardening paraphenalia and you wish to shut
the curtains.
That would leave things out in the cold. It is a highly unsatisfactory
procedure. Conversely, if you don't shut the curtains you can lose a lot
of heat.
Several gardeners use kitchen windowsills. Kitchens are usually fairly
warm places, although curtains are seldom drawn. The key issue is
whether the window receives light. South facing windows are best.
For rooting cuttings and sowing seeds, poor light may not necessarily
be a problem. Lots of seeds germinate best in darkness.
I had problems with germination of all sorts, especially during the
February-March period. I went on to the polythene bag system.
This involves sowing seed in pots or trays, making sure compost is
nicely damp. Put the receptacle into a polythene bag, which is knotted
to keep in moisture.
Receptacles can be stacked on top of the kitchen cabinet. This is sure
to be a warm place. The temperature rarely drops much below 60 degrees
Fahrenheit.
We are talking about seed germination, remember, not rooting cuttings.
This can be done using polythene bags, but you need light for cuttings
to survive.
You would be amazed how quickly seed germinates in warm places. You
have to keep a close eye on the seeds, to make sure they don't whiten
through lack of sunlight, or drawn. They can do this in a day or two if
not taken out of the germinating quarters.
You may consider it a little early to think about seeds or cuttings.
Do bear in mind that, at least some seed crops, will need to be sown in
the next six to seven weeks to have plants by spring or early summer.
A load of cuttings can be taken and rooted now, if you feel so
inclined. If you do use windowsills, a sheet of polythene or gravel
trays can be useful. Even a table can be a good idea.
I know gardeners who root geranium cuttings right now, particularly if
they have special varieties. There can also be cuttings of begonias,
busy Lizzies and other items.
I have many gardening friends with a marvellous display of plants in
their gardens.
They do the plant raising in the home without any use of a greenhouse
or frame at all.
Altogether, there is plenty to do if you can make satisfactory
arrangements. Remember, however, you must be organised well in advance.

Glasgow School of Art is now 150 years young, and looking forward to
the millennium with confidence. Clare Henry charts its progress
YESTERDAY Glasgow School of Art celebrated its 150th birthday, and
began a landmark year. Director Dugald Cameron is the ideal man to
supervise this. He arrived at GSA in 1957 as a non-diploma student after
a spell as a Rolls-Royce apprentice. After 37 years he still loves the
place with a passion. ''It's a great joy. Where else would you find such
a concentration of inspiring, interesting, irritating, and creative
characters? Staff and students alike conspire to make each day an
anarchic mixture of purposeful amusement and amazement.''
Cameron took on the directorship in 1991 at one of the most fraught
periods in the school's history. The previous director had dramatically
disappeared. No detective story or film script would dare come up with
such a senario. Cameron shrugs it off. ''A slight blip.'' His
down-to-earth attitude and safe pair of hands steered the school safely
through this difficult period, stabilising a potentially dangerous
situation. In typically generous manner he gives all praise to his
colleagues, ''the best in the business''.
His mission statement is equally down-to-earth. ''Artefacts not arty
facts; product not process. I'm not impressed by the fashion of
'managerialism' and grudge the time required to produce the paper
mountains which seem to be required and can so easily divert us from the
real job of teaching, scholarship, and research. Trust in people not
paperwork, that's my motto.''
Glasgow School of Art was founded as a Government School of Design on
January 6, 1845, in Ingram Street, coincidentally where the old Print
Studio was. Archibald McLellan, of McLellan Galleries fame, was already
collecting art -- ''every room of his villa on the slopes of Dalhousie
Street was filled with pictures,'' remembers a visitor from 1850 who
went on to see the Hunterian Museum, then in the High Street.
The school's first-year records tell us that total students' fees were
#200; donations #31.10s and subscriptions #739. ''The school is very
numerously attended by youths and adults from the industrial portion of
the populace. The early and late hours at which classes assemble,
commencing at 7am and terminating at 10pm, indicate most remarkably the
desire for artistic improvement which prevails among the commercial and
operative communities.''
By 1850 there were life classes. In 1869 the school, now with 1164
students, moved to Sauchiehall Street. Lavery attended morning classes
from 7-9am; Roche went at night. In 1882 Glasgow took the most awards
and gained the largest government grant of any art school in the UK. In
1888 the Glasgow International Exhibition produced a profit, so it was
decided to erect an Art Gallery and Art School. The school got #5000 and
the Mackintosh building opened in 1899. Celebrations included a student
exhibition visited by more than 3000 people.
The school's original aim was to assist local industry; 150 years
later it is still fulfilling that job and concerning itself with making
things. GSA excels from embroidery to engineering, says Cameron. It
teaches design, graphics, photography, architecture, textiles,
silversmithing, painting, sculpture, and printmaking, plus many other
subjects including a unique Bachelor of Engineering product-design
course, Dugald Cameron's baby.
''I believed we needed a different way to address engineering.
Engineering education in universities had become an abstraction; not for
the real world; not for industry. The way we taught industrial design
could be applied to engineering. Engineering is the great art of the
twentieth century -- but the course is only successful because it's done
in an art school alongside painters, sculptors, and architects. My hope
is that, through all these courses, GSA will continue to fulfil its
original mission and contribute to the economic regeneration of our city
and the west of Scotland.''
In this age of accountability, no institution is more accountable than
GSA. Every year graduates put on a public show of their work. ''Any
member of the public is welcome to come and see what we do.'' The Degree
Show is now so crowded on the opening night that sometimes police have
to close the street.
The Glasgow Boys from the school -- Lavery, Walton, Henry, Paterson,
et al -- made their names in the nineteenth century. In the last decade
the new Glasgow Boys and Girls -- Campbell, Howson, Wieszniewski,
Currie, McPhail, Gordon, Watt, Saville, Borland, and many more, some
figurative, others conceptual -- have again put the city on the map.
''We don't have a style or school of painting -- but we do have a great
Painting School,'' joked Cameron.
Working in the famous Mackintosh building is an inspiration for the
staff and students, but a building in itself is not enough. Mackintosh
made the building famous but the students have made the school known
throughout the world. And while the Mackintosh building (commissioned by
the influential Fra Newbery, who ruled the roost from 1885 to 1917)
brings visitors from round the world, it's also a burden. For the first
time in 20 years a #2.3m programme of renovation, restoration, and new
building is under way which includes #400,000 to replace the Mackintosh
roof and #400,000 on major renovations.
With stringent Government cuts three years running, and a 25%
reduction in teaching resources, Cameron is angry at the Tories' serious
assult on GSA finances. Staff are also saddled with new quality
assessment, which he sees as ''burdensome and bureaucratic''. Despite
this, GSA is, says Cameron, in fighting trim with results well above
average.
Nostalgia for the good old days is not allowed to colour current
decisions, but graduates old and young would not be human if, on the
school's 150th anniversary, they did not spare a thought for times past;
for the days of Mackintosh and the Four and Jessie Newbery. GSA was soon
exhibiting abroad; St Louis in 1903; Lyons in 1914. By 1924 50 students
provided work for the Wembley Exhibition.
Mary Armour remembers her first day in 1920 when things were more
formal. ''You were addressed by your surname,'' she explains.
Greiffenhagen, who favoured the Pre-Raphaelites, was head of painting
then and was not amused by her radical 1924 diploma picture. ''A
mythological subject was expected, but I decided to go for social
realism with a scene of a pit-head. Originally it did include a church
but I decided not to compromise and substituted a big pit-wheel.''
Alistair Alasdair Gray, Liz Lochhead, Robbie Coltrane, Muriel Gray
some of the students. Next year GSA hopes to see the opening of a new
student residency, the Art Lover's House as a postgraduate school, the
start of the new Centenary Building, and a course in computer-based
design for Scotland's business community. GSA looks set fair to meet the
new millennium.

THE idea of having your own swimming pool conjures up images of luxury
and exclusivity. But is it so exclusive that it is beyond people's means
and reach?
According to Margaret Seymour, managing director of Seymour Swimming
Pool Engineers in Lanark, such an undertaking is not to be entered into
lightly.
''We encourage clients to be cautious and make sensible decisions. Our
starting point is to decide what looks best at the right price.
''On average it is a full 12 months after a client first seeks our
advice before work begins, so it is a long-term process and a long-term
investment.''
Margaret Seymour also knows that ''looks are not everything''.
''We ensure each pool is properly engineered right down to the quality
of building materials, the heating, dehumidification and filtration
systems,'' she said.
Once the initial costs of building have been met the upkeep remains.
Margaret Seymour estimates that at about #1500 a year, a pool is cheaper
than putting petrol in a car for the corresponding period.
Seymour, founded in 1980, has participated already in domestic pools
and spa projects as well as commercial undertakings for hotels, sports
clubs and local authorities.

Flann O'Brien. THE HARD LIFE (Flamingo, #5.99).
* ABOUT halfway through this minor-key comedy from late in the great
Myles Na Gopaleen's career, it suddenly becomes clear that what is
superficially a gentle portrait of Dublin boyhood is in fact completely
insane. At the beginning of the century, two orphaned boys are taken
under the care of their uncle, Mr Collopy -- who, when not
propagandising for more public lavatories for women, spends his evenings
bestowing whiskey and opinions on the local Jesuit priest. Meanwhile,
the young Finbarr watches as his brother Manus devises money-making
schemes like teaching tightrope-walking by post and selling patent
medicines, with tragic repercussions for the family. Ending with a
hilariously disastrous Papal audience, the novel displays to the full
O'Brien's genius for philosophical absurdity and warm-hearted,
life-embracing humour.
Angela Carter. SEVERAL PERCEPTIONS (Virago, #9.99).
* HELLO trees, hello sky, hello Realms of the Self . . . Angela
Carter's debut novel, first published in 1968, has been out of print a
long time, and no wonder. Tricked out with every bead-rattling conceit
of the day, it's an exercise in the kind of addled hippie idealism and
acid-head solipsism in which the late 1960s excelled. That doesn't mean
it's a bad book: just that it's hard to see anyone who wasn't aged
between 12 and 25 in 1968 enjoying it now. Its hero Joseph, 22 and
miserable, is in search of the meaning of life, confusing that with
timorous narcotic experimentation and radical pranks like sending his
excrement by airmail to the White House. Yet, despite his frightful
preciousness, Carter conveys a wistful and touching sense of time and
place (London) that makes Several Perceptions an interesting psychedelic
period piece.
Paul Ferris. CAITLIN: The Life of Caitlin Thomas (Pimlico, #10).
* A COQUETTISH colleen with delusions of talent, Caitlin Macnamara was
one of Augustus John's countless mistresses, a friend of many literary
and artistic figures, and the wife of Dylan Thomas. Married life didn't
sit well with her free-spirited nature and her jealousy (of other women
and of Dylan's fame). She was a difficult and not easily lovable woman
who held her grudges and grievances long after the poet's death --
although, before her own death six months ago, she asked to be buried
beside him. Failure as an artist in her own right means that her fame
rests entirely with her husband's, and Paul Ferris's well-made but
ultimately ethereal biography is for Dylanologists only.
Malcolm Brown and Shirley Seaton. CHRISTMAS TRUCE: The Western Front,
December 1914 (Papermac, #10.99).
* CONAN Doyle described the Christmas Truce of 1914 as ''one human
episode amid all the atrocities which have stained the memory of the
war'', and many legends have grown up around the fact that thousands of
men on both sides shook hands, exchanged gifts, and played football that
day. One of the legends is that it was hushed up. Another is that it was
Tommies and Fritzes only, that no officers were involved. This book
examines, through letters and interviews with eye-witnesses and
participants, this extraordinary phenomenon. This is a serious history
and an enormously uplifting one -- something that, history being what it
is, few histories can claim.
Anne Rice. INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE (Warner, #5.99.
* A BREED apart, consigned to the fringes of society and forced to
scour dark cellars in search of similar somnambulistic souls, old
Bauhaus and The Wedding Present fans have taken to Anne Rice's Vampire
Chronicles in a big way -- putting them right up there in the Goth top
ten alongside big frilly cuffs and the Vidal Sassoon Guide to
Backcombing. Reprinted here to tie in with the forthcoming movie
starring Tom Cruise, Interview With the Vampire is a superior
spinechiller that mixes deadly desire and dark romance with the heavier
themes of free will, divided nature, and the morality of immortality.
Still can't imagine Tom Cruise in it, though.
A L Kennedy and James McGonigal (ed). A SORT OF HOT SCOTLAND
(Association for Scottish Literary Studies, #6.95).
* WHEN Jim Kelman waltzed off with the Booker, English critics went
into fits, claiming not only that his novel was not all that good (such
questions never bothered them before) but that . . . well, the language
had a Scottish flavour that their educated palates found hard to take.
What they would make of this anthology is anyone's guess, offering as it
does a diverse collection of stories, poems, and a play extract that
provides not only a geographical tour of the nation but a linguistic one
as well. There is good stuff, bad stuff, and incomprehensible stuff
here, but the important thing is that it's here at all, a literary voice
for Scotland at a time when England's is terminally trivial and dry.
Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. THREE BITS OF FRY AND LAURIE (Mandarin,
#5.99).
* FRY and Laurie. Fructatingly smug? Maybe. Dipthalmically derivative
of early Monty Python? Debatable. Ever so twee and comblosively English?
Perhaps. But if you like your comedy arch, mannered, and surgically
sensitive to the nooks and crannies of linguistic exploration, then
Steve and Hugh are the chaps for you, and never more so than in this
hulking compendium extruded from their BBC2 televisual entertainments.
The Pythonesque absurdity does eventually grate, but the pair are always
at their best when grabbing a target by the tail and shaking it until it
rattles.

* FROM today, Weekender will be sponsored by InterCity West Coast, who
run the high-speed rail services between Glasgow, Motherwell, and
England. Ivor Warburton, director of InterCity West Coast, in welcoming
the sponsorship, said: ''We are delighted to continue the close
association between our company and The Herald. We are particularly
pleased and proud to lead the way by being the first company to sponsor
Weekender.
''The West coast route is the natural link to the south from Glasgow
and the West of Scotland, and we believe strongly that the link beweeen
InterCity West Coast and The Herald Weekender is also a natural one --
as so many Weekender readers are also our business and leisure
customers.
''Our daytime trains run from Glasgow and Motherwell to North-west
England and London Euston, and our fastest train takes just five hours

Bill McCue is the voice of Hogmanay, but this New Year saw him
rehearsing for the great joy of his professional life, opera. But his
love of all things Scottish remains undimmed, finds Jackie McGlone.
BILL McCUE has had his clothes off twice already today -- ''and I'm
no' taking them off again for anybody,'' booms Scotland's best-loved
vocal hero, as the press person from Scottish Opera prepares to closet
up McCue and I for our interview. She'll be next door if he needs her,
she murmurs. If McCue should cry out for help, I tell her, she's bound
to hear him. To which the cuddlesome Mr McCue, he of the avuncular
twinkle, replies that he's not about to undress for The Herald or
anybody, the wardrobe department having had him in nightshirt and socks
all morning, so to speak.
McCue is well and truly back with Scottish Opera and tonight he opens
in the company's production of Gilbert and Sullivan's Iolanthe, in which
he plays the Lord Chancellor -- ''it has some good tunes and lots of
laughs, which you don't often get with opera''. So here he is, back with
the ''family'' after an absence of almost four years -- ''ach, it's good
to get the new young whizzkids in; it's good to open doors and let the
wind blow through even if it does blow you oot on the way'' -- having
truly been their man for all seasons for decades. ''I had been in the
company for 30 years and never missed a season and I had sung more than
70 parts; I had covered the complete repertoire, including musicals like
Fiddler on the Roof and Merry Widow and Die Fledermaus, the complete
range of the singer's repertoire. We finished with a piece called
Regina, in which I died onstage of a heart attack, and suddenly there
wasn't a lot for me the next season.
''I thought, why not let the next generation in, so I took a wee
breather, a sabbatical. Honestly, I don't know how it came into my
consciousness that there really is another life outside opera. I loved
opera so much, and still do, and was so dedicated to it, especially from
the mid-seventies when it became a 48-week contract, that I lived, ate,
slept, worked opera. All my pals were in the opera, and great pals they
were, too, and I wouldn't try and wipe away any of those experiences,
but I had got to the point where I had a life within the opera which was
also my life outside. There I was living in this wee community and even
when you went on holiday, you went with the cast. Also I was getting
very narrow in my musical performances and the day had come to get on
with my Scots music and cabaret. I had things like my Paul Robeson show
which I had been working on a for a while and I thought, I have to stop
talking about it and get on and do it. And now my life is full; very,
very full.''
So for the past three years 60-year-old McCue has toured all over the
world ''doing my Scottish bit'', always on cue -- when we met he had
only recently returned from Scottish Fortnight in Hong Kong -- letting
the world know that the kilt is his delight. Oh God, yes, he says,
downing the dregs of his polystyrene cup of lunchtime soup, he is proud
to be Scottish -- ''I wear the kilt with great pride -- I love it, it's
colourful and it's show-offy and that's the kind of guy I am. I'd have
difficulty hiding my light under a bushel, you know.''
Personally I have difficulty believing that statement, for he comes
across as a big Santa of a man in a purple pullover. The sort of nice,
white-bearded man upon whose knee you liked to be dandled when you were
a wee girl. He's a plain-talking, modest sort of chap whose rock-solid
values have a home-spun honesty, a man whose heart you suspect is as big
as the lungs which pump away like giant bellows to produce that
magnificent mahogany voice. Six foot tall, McCue looks as if he's not
only built from pit-props (he used to be an electrician in the mines
around Shotts), he is an iron brew of a man, and is probably also made
from girders. They don't build them like that any more. Truly, his is a
voice from the black stuff. A voice made to swing low and to sing low,
as well as hit those top notes with perfect pitch.
His is also the voice most of us associate with Hogmanay, although
this year he did not do the TV show -- he recorded an Old Year's Night
programme for Radio Clyde instead -- because you have always known that
if a black bun could sing it would sound like Bill McCue, all dark and
fruity, all succulent and treacly. But Bill McCue prefers the comparison
an Italian critic came up with some years ago. ''I couldn't wait to read
the reviews in the Italian papers because I was singing in Italy. I got
them translated and the one I best remember said, 'Mr McCue's voice
reminds one of that other prestigious Scottish export, whisky; it is
golden, matured over many years, and rich'. And all these things I have
always kept at the back of my mind because I am indeed partial to a wee
dram, as well as the odd glass of red wine.''
Everything in moderation, though, he says, admitting that he still
enjoys a pipe -- ''it's a comforter'' -- and has smoked ever since he
was an apprentice electrician, boiling up the tea for the tradesmen in
Tate &amp; Lyle's syrup cans. ''They all smoked the bogey roll, the black
stuff, so one day I said, 'give me a fill' and I took two puffs of that
and well, I was out the back of the shop! I thought I'd never smoke
again, but you do, you do. I like to smoke when I am under stress and
this business is full of stress. I have always found if I sit down with
my pipe and read the inside of the Balkan Sobranie tobacco tin about how
smoking this stuff is going to take away all your cares in the world,
then you don't feel so bad. Pipe dreams, I suppose.''
Now, you always thought that opera singers, like Bill Clinton, never
ever inhaled. Surely those golden tonsils have to be carefully preserved
by gargling only with vintage champagne and the crustiest of ports? No,
replies McCue, his vocal cords are well tanned. Recently he went along
to Edinburgh University to take part in some tests on an apparatus which
shows the wear and tear on the vocal cords.
''At first I thought no, I don't want to be plugged into that bloody
thing,'' he says. ''I didn't want to see my epiglottis going up and
down. I didn't want to see the mechanics of it. I just know that with
the help of the wonderful teachers I have had over the years that I can
still produce my voice to a professional standard. Anyway, they
persuaded me and I was fascinated to see these whirls going up and down
on the screen as I sang a couple of arias. They also got me to blow into
this machine and the professor said that my lungs were fine, but that
the muscles controlling my vocal cords have a kind of leathery finish to
them, which is obviously the tanning from the tobacco. 'Who knows?' he
said, 'it may be preserving them'.''
Long may they be preserved. But how on earth does he care for the
voice? Ah yes, says McCue, the voice. ''There was this lovely lady
called Joanna Peters, who is now principal teacher of singing at one of
the London colleges, and I remember she would always come into Scottish
Opera rehearsals and say, 'How's the voice, son?' Because we all
referred to the voice. It is like it is a separate part of you. I always
love it when people say, 'he's had his voice trained' as if you had
taken it out, trained it and put it back in again. I sing every day and
I really take care of my voice by using it regularly whether I am
working or not, just warming it up and running up and down the scales.
It has been a lifetime's work. And no, I never, ever sing in the bath.
Only in the music room at home.''
The retiral which he had thought might come along when he hit 60 last
August is on hold, he maintains. Then he adds, thoughtfully, actually he
hopes never to retire, but then you never know how long the voice is
going to go on, but bass singers, well, you know, the guys with the deep
rich tones do go on longer than tenors, who seem to keel over just that
wee bit earlier.
Musicians, I point out to him, are a long-lived lot. Is it the music
that keeps them young? ''Do you know, I have never thought about that
before, but yes, look at Solti still conducting in his eighties. I used
to think it was the discipline, the dedication, the sheer physicality of
it, the fact that you are always on your feet that kept you fit, but you
could be right, it could be the music itself. I'm going to have to think
about that one. But, yes, I have know so many singers who have gone on
into their eighties.'' He had this friend, Frank Elliot Dobie, who died
at the age of 96. A great man for singing at all the dinners and so on
in Glasgow, he always told McCue, ''Don't give up the singing, son,
until your voice goes and your voice will never go if you look after
it''.
''I remember going to his 90th birthday at a golf club on the
south-side and he was standing in the middle of the room with three or
four scores, he said, 'Let me give you a wee tip. Where would you sing
in this room?' I said I didn't know. To which he replied, 'There's only
one spot, see under that bright light, that's the place to be'. His
pupils included Sydney Devine, one of my great fishing friends, a
wonderful guy, gallus as they come. And Frank's teacher had been a man
called George Henshall and he had been a pupil of Brahms.'' So you could
say that Sydney has felt the divine touch of Brahms? ''Aye, well, it is
important to feel that you are part of that ongoing process, that you
are all connected in some way back to the 1750s and 1800s when printed
music first came out and performances began,'' notes McCue.
His own performances date back to childhood in a working-class family
where there was always music in the house while the young Bill sang in
the Shotts male voice choir. ''My father played the box, he was a
Scottish accordion player, and my mother's family were all wonderful
singers and were in the great choirs like the Wishaw and District, which
was the real mecca for all good singers because they sang all the great
choral works. It was amazing. I lost my father early on, but my Uncle
Will (I'm supposed to be like him -- I am William Laing Denholm McCue
and he was William Laing Denholm and I am, as they say, cried after him)
was the most encouraging person in my life. And he was a real singer, my
uncle. My mother was always encouraging me, too. At weekends the house
was filled with music -- not just for Burns Night or Hogmanay, but every
Friday and Saturday night. When the pubs closed, they all came along for
a sing-song and it was just great.''
It is a tradition he has maintained in his own handsome Lanarkshire
home. His wife Pat, whom he met when they were both music students, is a
talented pianist and acts as his accompanist on his cabaret tours round
the Arts Council circuit with his Paul Robeson show and on the worldwide
gigs with Scottish music programmes. Daughter Kirsteen, 25, is now Dr
McCue, having gained her PhD at Oxford last year after graduating with
honours from Glasgow University, where she read Scottish literature and
music. In October, Bill and Pat McCue watched their daughter lead the
procession down to the Sheldonian from Baliol College at the degree
ceremony. ''It was like an opera; it was wonderful. Pure theatre. You
saw all the professors with their cloaks on and then we had a wee sherry
in the courtyard afterwards. It was grand. I was so proud of her.''
Dr McCue is now managing the Scottish Music Information Centre and is
based in Glasgow. ''She has considerable musical abilities. She was a
cellist with the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland and she sings a
lot so my plan for her when she left Glasgow was that she would take the
National Savings Bond I had bought for her, which was due to mature as
she left university, and go and study in Europe. ''I never thought she
was going to be academic. We didnae have enough brains to be academic in
our family, but she was offered a scholarship to Oxford and she had a
rough start because her subject was Scottish and not English, but she
won through in the end. I can't tell you how pleased I was for her.''
Time was when to have had a career in music or opera in Scotland would
have been unthinkable. ''You used to have to go away from Scotland to be
a singer, but thanks to my parents I had the good fortune to be born
here just when I was, so I have been with Scottish Opera since it
started. I feel very comfortable to have been born in this part of the
world -- I think that the qualities that my generation have been given
are better, providing you find the things that satisfy you in the
community you live in and that is home and that is where the heart is.
Now that can be Timbuctoo or anywhere. It just so happens I was born in
a place called Scotland. Now I think it has its advantages over other
nations, but I am not a nationalist.
''I would like to see Scotland more in control of its political
affairs, that's a definite. But I also want Scots to broaden their
horizons because when you bring in the parameters, the mind goes with it
and you have got to liberate the mind. Wherever I go in the world I
always find people that are the same kind of guy or who have the same
outlook on life as I have. I find them all over the world. I even find
them'' -- the famous voice drops to a stage whisper -- ''in England. In
fact, some of my best friends are English.''
