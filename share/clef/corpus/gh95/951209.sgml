CONSTRUCTION and engineering group Amec yesterday reiterated its pleas to
shareholders to reject the hostile bid from Kvaerner, the Norwegian owner of
the Govan shipbuilding yard on the Clyde.
Amec said the offer for its Ordinary and Preference stock, valuing the company
at #361m, was ``inadequate''. This assertion is based on its record #2300m
order book and what it says are strong growth prospects.
Amec said the bid did not take into account the firm's forecast 39% increase in
operating profit for 1995 and forecast 12% rise in turnover for 1996. It added
that Kvaerner recognised the potential of Amec's businesses and covets its
position in the UK oil and gas sector, its international strengths, and its
project management and design skills.
Blowers purchase
CLYDE Blowers, the specialist engineering group, has bought Richard Simon &amp;
Sons, a Nottingham-based manufacturer of weighing, packing and systems control
equipment, for #2.5m.
Clyde Blowers announced the acquisition as executive chairman Jim McColl
revealed ``a very encouraging start to the year'' at the company's annual
meeting in Glasgow. ``I am confident of further strong growth in this year,''
he said, noting that Clyde Blowers had trebled its pre-tax profit to #1.5m in
the 12 months to September 30. Clyde Blowers shares closed up 7p at 205p.
Joint bid remains
ICELAND and N Brown hope Littlewoods will reconsider its proposed joint bid for
the group which is Britain's largest family owned-business. At an EGM on
Thursday, a 79% majority voted against pursuing any external approaches for the
group. However, Iceland and N Brown said they would welcome any reconsideration
of their proposals by the Littlewoods board. The two companies made a joint
approach to Littlewoods in mid-November.
Courts' profit fall
TOUGH trading conditions in the UK hit Courts furnishing stores at the interim
stage. Pre-tax profits were down 10% to #4m, but the dividend is raised by 5%
to 2.1p from 2.0p. UK sales dropped 2.4% in the first half, although trading,
in what is the most important half for the group, shows a slight recovery.
Overseas sales grew by 20% with strong trading in Malaysia and Singapore.
Courts say there is scope to expand in the UK and overseas, particularly in
south-east Asia.
Crying into beer
LONDON-based brewer Fuller Smith &amp; Turner criticised Chancellor Kenneth Clarke
for not reducing beer duty in the Budget despite the tide of imports coming in
from France. The amount of imports is said to have reached 1.1 million pints
per day.
The comments were made by chairman Anthony Fuller as the group reported record
interim profits of #5.1m compared with #4.2m previously. The interim dividend
goes up from 2.65p to 2.92p. The hot summer and the opening of six new pubs
contributed to the strong performance.

A FUNNY old week for public service broadcasting, such as remains. Channel 4
began it by interpreting its generous remit as a feeble excuse to tag a weekend
of soap opera re-runs onto the 35th anniversary of Coronation Street just as
BBC2 was following the Labour Party in its search for a prophet through The
Wilderness Years (Sunday). It was hard to say which of the plots was less
plausible.
Channel 4's thinking, if thinking it is, seems to be that the capacious
portmanteau ``popular culture'' means any old tart can be scraped from the
bottom of the barrel and treated with reverence. Re-running an episode of the
misbegotten Eldorado might just have distracted attention from the deeply
risible Hollyoaks. Ray Gosling's The Coronation Street Years may have said more
about how the nation has altered than Hugo Young's ponderous The Last Europeans
(all Sunday). But what this theme weekend really exposed was the infinite
depths of TV's self-love.
Thus, 1986 may have been a bad year for Labour (which year in the eighties was
not?) but could it match the profound significance of Sheila Grant's rape in
Brookside? The events of the early sixties may have left Britain further out of
the European mainstream and given Young a trail to follow, but what was that to
a re-run of a 1963 Coronation Street? TV makes its own icons, and bids us
worship.
There is, now, more soap frothing from the box than ever, and it is, in
consequence, worse than ever. But that fact, in its turn, has allowed
television's pop tarts simply to argue that there was once a golden age of
gritty serial drama with tough scripts and fine acting, a national passion play
that united us all by its sheer humanity. Old soaps thus become worthy of
preservation and study, cultural events to be cherished like any other.
The trouble is, and despite all the praise of commentators who have made
slumming it into a career, Soap Weekend proved only that most of what the
nation has lapped up over the years has been cheap melodrama and unredeemed
banality. The form itself - endless narratives, stereotypical characters, the
fiction of ``realism'' - militates against any hope of art.
The national obsession with the genre suggests, meanwhile, that a shabby nation
has become sentimental about its own decay.
None of this is to underestimate sentiment. As The Wilderness Years began to
make clear, it was sentiment as much as stupidity that forced Labour from
office. Reverence for British institutions combined with sentimentality over
its socialist past, one neatly cancelling out the other, did as much harm to
the party as the Tories ever did. But what was striking - apart from the
impossible youth of the politicians captured on film - was the lack of
sentiment most of them felt for one another. Most people in the People's Party,
on this evidence, hated most of the other people.
To which it might be added: in keeping with what is taken to be the present
sentiment of the nation, The Wilderness Years, on its first outing, was the
best propaganda Tony Blair could hope for in his efforts to transform Labour.
If everyone then was so wrong, how could he fail to be right? Then again, there
was a time when few people doubted that the revered Robert Baden-Powell was
right about everything. Sentiment was for him and the nation's boys loved him -
almost as much, on the evidence of The Secret Lives series (Channel 4,
Thursday), as he adored them.
This splendid series has had a merry time performing the necessary public
service of chopping the legs from national monuments. It ignores the juvenile
proposition that you cannot apply modern opinions to the past (handy for
Hitler, among others, if it were true) and simply lays out the evidence. It
makes the useful case - one that cannot be made too often - that heroes need
careful watching.
Thus, this essay on the author of Camp Fire Yarns (deeply camp, in fact)
explored all the clean, hearty, manly virtues that allowed B-P to turn Scouting
into the biggest movement the world has seen outside politics and religion.
Virtues like a love for pig-sticking (``Oh mummy! You should have seen how I
stuck it in him!''), an addiction to public executions, shameless militarism, a
belief in racial superiority, and the devoted study of photographs of naked
boys. The usual thing.
That B-P was a repressed homosexual with a sadistic streak (he advised Scout
masters to take masturbators ``in hand'') seemed fairly clear.
His usefulness within the Edwardian class system, his unease among women
(mummy's fault), and his arrested emotional development were also pretty
obvious. But perhaps for that reason Secret Lives was oddly gentle, as though
accepting that this bizarre character was a product of bizarre circumstances,
more to be pitied than despised. Given the huge influence of his movement,
however, you wonder what that says about the Britain that honoured him so.
You wonder, too, thinking of Britain and public service broadcasting, whose
brainwave it was to offer the Inside Story Special: Inside 25 Cromwell Street
(BBC1, Monday), in which the children of Fred and Rosemary West offered their
version of what went on and why. There comes a point at which explanation
becomes exploitation and this piece, ripe with tales of abuse and terror, came
perilously close to it.
One argument says the public has the right to know; another that it has the far
more important right to understand. Now we know, do we understand? If not - and
who claims otherwise? - why are we invited to watch? The revolting thought is
that this programme, for some, was just another part of the evening's
entertainment.
Finally, since documentaries have dominated the week, the column's commendation
for Lido (BBC2, Wednesday), a work so good it's hard to say why. Ostensibly a
gentle portrait of Brockwell Park lido in South-east London, it turned out to
be a sunny and sweet study of human variety, from the one-parent families
frolicking to the Cabinet secretary keeping in shape.
Nothing exciting happened, short of a jolly lesbian wedding, and nothing of
great importance was said. These were people, merely, caught for a moment in
the passing show. The sort of people you never see in soap operas, in fact, and
not a national hero among them.

FORTE forecasts a surge in profits and details the way it ``will create value''
for shareholders in its formal defence document against the hostile #3300m bid
from Granada.
The group projects a 46% rise in pre-tax profit to #185m before exceptionals
for the year to January 1996. The surplus on disposals of Gardner Merchant,
Harvester, Puritan Maid, Lillywhites and Griersons will add a further #76m.
Excluding these extras, earnings per share will be 40% ahead at 14.1p.
``This hostile bid is inadequate and has no commercial logic. Coming at an eary
stage of the cyclical upswing, it is an attempt to acquire on the cheap the
value the new management team is creating,'' chairman Sir Rocco Forte declares.
Forte makes no reference to dividends at this stage, clearly because it wants
to retain ammunition for further circulars to shareholders. A large increase is
a foregone conclusion, and Forte notes that operating cashflow is recovering
strongly and will comfortably cover dividend payments after investing #175m in
capital programmes.
The defence document does not include the traditional attack on the bidder,
though this will surely come later.
Trading so far in the second half of the trading year is said to have
strengthened further. London hotel revenue per available room is up 14% in the
past four months, with a better mix. Provincial hotels are up 7% and
international 1%. If Paris, where conditions have been especially difficult, is
excluded then there is a 9% rise.
Little Chef and Welcome Break had a difficult summer, but sales are now moving
ahead of 1994.
The #240m raised through disposals will cut gearing to 50% by the year-end and
further divestments are planned. Hotels will generate net cashflow of #100m
this year, more than some observers had considered likely.
The projected profits are not unexpected as they are only a little above
consensus market expectations and are in line with the estimate from Forte's
own broker, UBS, after it had downgraded its forecast from #190m in October.
Forte points out that the business has been fundamentally reorganised into
distinct, brand-focused businesses supported by a corporate team of 50.
Reporting lines have been shortened, with clear responsibility and
accountability for performance, cashflow and returns.
``Revitalisation of the management team has enabled us to make substantial
progress in implementing our strategy through radical organisation and cultural
change,'' states Sir Rocco. ``We have created clearly defined business units,
shortened lines of communication, and brought the management closer to the
customer.
The group says that closure of divisional offices and de-layering management
has produced cost savings of #25m per year. Strong financial controls and
efficient purchasing have been introduced. Forte points out that disposals
totalling #950m over three years have yielded a surplus of #500m, with a
further #200m of disposals announced or underway.
``Realising the value of significant hotel assets while retaining management
contracts is fast becoming an attractive option as the hotel market
strengthens,'' it states.
Granada has criticised the plan to demerge the restaurant activities because,
for one thing, purchasing economies would be lost. Forte rejects this, saying
the two businesses are becoming increasingly distinct, with synergies between
them less important. So in terms of transaction value, hotels are high spend,
roadside restaurants low; hotels have advance bookings, restaurants are
immediate purchase.
Sir Rocco adds that demerger will deliver greater operational focus, more
efficient allocation of resources and shareholder choice. He hopes to implement
the demerger by the middle of 1996. However, there are no clues over how much
shareholders would be better off through the demerger.
Forte details how its brands have leading positions in their markets and
explains how it hopes to improve their performances. Overall, the defence
document contains nothing new to worry the Granada camp, which will now be
preparing its riposte.

THE UK share market scored gains of around 20% this year which is not at all
bad going. A cheer for the bulls who said the FTSE-100 index could hit 3750 but
a stale bun with no icing on it for the bear who worried that it could drop to
2800.
Some investors like to keep their money in their home market. Some get dizzy
when the market hits new peaks as it has been doing recently. Where it goes
from here depends, as always, partly on what happens on Wall Street and in
other overseas economies and partly on interest rates, as much as on domestic
economic considerations.
Short term it seems worth bearing in mind that the run up to Christmas and the
early days of the new year are more often than not times when shares do well.
Longer term, next year is bound to see even more concentration of interest on
what is likely to be the result of the next General Election.
For what it is worth, predictions for the FTSE-100 index for next year have
ranged from not much change to 3900 or even 4200. The prospect of 4200, it has
to be admitted, gives me a slight attack of vertigo bearing in mind the
political risks. It is possible to argue though that there is scope for
dividends to rise whether you accept the Chancellor's growth target or the more
modest figure market experts have been forecasting.
For those who prefer to hedge their bets and feel they would like some of their
money overseas in a period of election uncertainty, brokers have been getting a
lot more confident about Japan. Tokyo has already staged an encouraging
recovery but has a long way to go if it is ever to hit its previous (dizzy)
heights.
Investors have responded by putting new money into investment trusts
specialising in Japan and being net buyers of Japan unit trusts despite the
earlier couple of false starts to recovery.
NatWest Securities is ``strongly bullish'' on Japanese shares on a 12-month
view. It says: ``The policy paralysis that characterised official behaviour in
the first part of 1995 has been replaced by renewed efforts to stimulate
demand. Although consumer demand remains fragile and low wage rises and rising
unemployment are undermining confidence, the Government's policy initiatives
mean that economic activity should show a marked improvement in 1996.''
Its prediction for the end of next year is that the Nikkei Dow index could hit
23,000. The timing of the big bounce is, however, uncertain. Domestic Japanese
investment institutions may stay on the sidelines for a while until there is a
discernible pick-up in corporate profitability.
Further rises in the share market are ``critically dependent on the economy's
showing some signs of improvement in the face of the authorities' renewed
efforts to stimulate demand''.
NatWest also cautions that a falling yen is ``a precondition of a rising equity
market''.
One of the major things which has worried investors about Japan has been the
banking crisis. Merrill Lynch, which also likes Japan, comments: ``In the past,
around the world, banking crises have proved to be major buying opportunities.
This is because an easier monetary stance is adopted to prevent a systemic
crash of the banking system.''
Japanese interest rates have already been brought down to 0.5% and ``the Bank
of Japan has to maintain interest rates at a very low level for at least the
next year to give Japanese banks time to rebuild profits''.
The case for Japanese shares is that earnings will accelerate - the brokers
predict that earnings per share should at least double over the coming two
years - but as interest rates are held down shares will remain on high
price-earnings multiples.
If this proves correct it should be good news for the domestic Japanese
investor. But the overseas investor has to think about the prospect of a fall
in the value of the yen. NatWest emphasises that a cheaper yen is ``central to
Japan's recovery prospects''. So the authorities are likely to continue to
encourage the currency to drop against the dollar.
Howard Flight of currency and bond specialist Guinness Flight, who earlier
forecast that the yen would drop to 120 to the dollar, expects continued yen
weakness from current levels.
He says the Bank of Japan ``has developed a sense of real crisis about
deflationary pressures in the Japanese economy and in particular the bad debt
problems of the banking system''. So he predicts that the policy of low
interest rates is unlikely to change until there is evidence of a sustained
recovery in the Japanese economy.
If all this is correct it follows that an overseas investor has to lose on the
currency if he or she is to gain on the stock market. The solution: leave it to
the experts and buy a specialist investment trust which is hedging its position
in Japanese shares against the yen.
Hedging does indeed seem worthwhile because Merrill Lynch is predicting a yen
dollar rate of 120 and NatWest a yen sterling rate of 178. That would eat up a
fair chunk of an unhedged gain even if the Nikkei index does hit 23,000.
Hedging policy among the specialist trusts ranges from a few with none to up to
40% or so.
Among the trusts most liked by NatWest is Edinburgh Japan, which at the time of
writing has hedging of 40%, and the NatWest analysts have set a ``target''
share price gain for next year (based on their net asset value forecasting
model) of almost 30%. Second is Invesco Japan Discovery with 25% hedging and a
target price rise of 27%.
Merrill Lynch recommends Baillie Gifford Japan and Baillie Gifford Shin Nippon,
both of which are also projected to rise 20% or more by NatWest. It also likes
the look of a number of warrants including Invesco Tokyo and Fleming Japan.

DEVRO, the Scottish maker of sausage skins, is raising #31m through a placing
and open offer of shares to help pay for its purchase of the US firm Teepak
International.
The new shares will be placed at 230p each, and Devro shareholders will be
entitled to buy one share for every 10 Ordinary held. Devro shares rose 12p to
251p.
The share issue has been underwritten by Charterhouse Bank, and an
extraordinary general meeting will be held on January 3 to approve it.
Devro agreed to buy Teepak for #87m in March, but the US Federal Trade
Commission only gave approval this week.
The enlarged Devro will have a big share of the US market in sausage skins. The
FTC has, therefore, forced the company to sell its existing collagen casings
business in the US.
Devro is paying for Teepak with up to #30m in cash and a mixture of Ordinary
and Preference shares. It will also take on #100.6m of Teepak's debt.
Devro has arranged a #120m facility with First National Bank of Chicago to
cover this debt and provide working capital. Completion of the deal is expected
on January 5.
Devro said trading had improved since it announced interim pre-tax profits of
#14.7m for the six months to June and it is confident of a satisfactory result
for the year.

A PROFIT warning from chemicals group Laporte sent the shares nosediving
yesterday by 172p to 611p.
New chief executive Jim Leng, who made his name at Low &amp; Bonar, has wasted no
time in shaking up the business, announcing the closure of several of its 100
factories around the world. These are smaller sites which Mr Leng said were
taking up too much management time or which were not making sufficient returns
on capital.
The total number of job losses among its 7100 staff has not been disclosed.
Following the completion of an operational review, Bedfordshire-based Laporte
has concluded that a restructuring programme and asset write-down is required
which will require a provision in the current year of #85m.
The site closures, rationalisation and cost reductions will cost #50m. The cash
element of the charge is #30m and is to be recovered by selling underperforming
assets and properties. The net debt of the group at 31 December, 1995 is
expected to be around #190m.
The restructuring provision coupled with declining demand for chemicals by the
construction and bulk polymer industries and poor trading in Australia and
South America, is expected to reduce profits by 10% compared with the #123.5m
made last year.
Profitability will also be adversely affected by the withdrawal from joint
ventures and a #5m higher interest bill associated with the substantial capital
expenditure programme and acquisitions made during the year. However the group
said it expected to maintain the final dividend at 14.5p net.
Mr Leng said the planned restructuring was directed at reducing the number of
operating sites and the cost base. He added that he believed the core group was
``in good shape''. He noted that several of the businesses were continuing to
trade strongly despite challenging market conditions.
In future, the focus is going to be on core and growing businesses in areas
such as pharmaceutical intermediary products and chemicals for the electronics
industry.
Mr Leng said that the benefits of the restructuring programme will start to
feed through in 1996 and be fully effective in 1997. He is no stranger to
reorganisation having overseen a major overhaul at the Dundee-based packaging
and materials firm Low &amp; Bonar where he was chief executive until his move nine
weeks ago.

IT is already going down in history as the Internet Christmas. In the UK around
900,000 people are surfing the Net and, with home computers and modems the
hottest selling items for the second year running, the number hooking up to the
information super-highway could double over the next year.
However, for many people, the experience has been less than riveting. Take
financial services. Most commentators say the home computer is poised to
revolutionise the consumer's relationship with the financial services industry,
as the telephone did 10 years ago, but that we aren't there yet.
Danny Bowers of MoneyWorld, the first UK personal finance publisher on the
Internet, says around 120 financial companies and organisations have some sort
of presence.
``There was a big burst of interest about six months ago. Companies found it
easy to put out information on the Internet and it gave their executives a big
thrill calling up their literature at home on their PCs. But consumers are
looking for something more than the information they can pick up in the High
Street for free. They want to be able to do business over the Net.
``This is the next stage of development and there are now between 30 and 40
companies who can communicate with their customers over the Internet to a
greater or lesser degree,'' he explains.
Sharelink, the telephone stockbroking service, is one of the first to exploit
the medium. It provides Europe's first Internet share dealing service using
prices automatically updated by Electronic Share Information (ESI), which costs
from #5 a month.
Sharelink is hedging its bets with the Internet by also offering a dealing
service through Infotrade, a financial information service owned by Mitsubishi,
which offers constantly updated share prices using CD-ROM technology.
Which system will win out is anyone's guess at the moment. Infotrade hopes to
sign up 100,000 private investors over the next four years. Chris Lambert,
Sharelink's special projects manager, says it will all come down to price in
the end. ``Telephone bills versus the cost of CD-ROMs, although in the end the
Internet does have the advantage that the information only has to be provided
once, it doesn't have to be sent out on CD-ROM.''
So far, Barclays is the only bank to have exploited the Net's ability to enter
into a dialogue with its customers. In March it began offering quotations for
travel insurance and in May it introduced a mail order service, BarclaySquare.
This is the equivalent of an electronic High Street. You can order goods from
14 stores including wine from Sainsburys, books from Blackwells and tickets
from Eurostar, and pay by credit card.
Credit card numbers are scrambled so they can only be read by the recipient.
However, many people worry that these secret codes may be broken.
This is a concern The Insurance Club has recognised. It is jointly owned by
Independent Insurance and insurance broker Bervale Mead. The club offers
buildings and contents insurance via the Net. Chairman Judith Malim says
payment is either by credit card or by post. ``We think we are the first
company producing quotations and setting up policies over the Internet, but we
do recognise that many consumers won't want to put their credit card details
out over the Net.''
But is the service popular? She says that between 50 and 100 people call up her
pages every day. ``Around 30% of these then go on to get quotations. We have
been surprised by the amount of E-Mail we get as a result. For example, people
E-Mail us to say that the quotation was attractive and they will be in touch
again when their policy is up for renewal. No-one ever phones or writes to an
insurance company to tell them that.''
She admits it is early days with the Internet. ``It is only just beginning. As
a company we have a range of products for the increasing number of people who
work from home, and as these people are often using the new technologies, we
are hoping to put these products out on it soon.''
Anyone who has ever surfed the Net knows how difficult it is to find your way
around without the right addresses. MoneyWorld (http:// www.moneyworld.co.uk)
carries a directory of most of the UK financial services companies offering
information or products in this way. Barclays can be reached at http://

<HEADLINE>BT and Oftel go to war over access charges</HEADLINE>

ANOTHER row has broken out between BT and its regulator Oftel over the
calculation of the charges rival telecom operators have to pay BT to access its
network for delivering calls.
BT has objected to Oftel's excluding certain significant costs from the
calculation. As a result, the determination of the charges will be delayed,
with completion expected next month. The delay reflects a further deterioration
in relations between BT and its regulator.
Oftel accuses BT of trying offload some costs which have nothing to do with
other operators' access to its network onto its competitors. Director General
of Telecommunications, Don Cruickshank declared: ``Oftel remains of the view
that other operators ought not to have to contribute through interconnection
charges to BT's large redundancy costs, vacant accommodation, chairman's office
and publicity costs (which include the costs of campaigns to win back customers
from other operators.''
However, he concedes that there is a heavier burden of proof on Oftel to show
why these costs should be excluded and where they should properly fall than had
been thought. So BT has been asked to provide more information on the origin,
breakdown, and allocation of these costs.
The matters in dispute account for around 15% of interconnection charges.
q BT yesterday confirmed plans to establish a European works council for
employees.
The move is expected to embarrass Ministers, who will see it as further
evidence of UK industry embracing European integration and undermining the
Government's opt-out of the EU social chapter.
However, a BT spokesman denied this was the company's intention. He said:
``This is our way of trying to ensure dialogue between ourselves and staff
representatives.
``We are now very much a European company, with interests across the Continent,
and we wanted to give those employees a means of formal communication with the
company. It has nothing to do with Government policy.''
All 135,000 BT staff will be consulted on the format of what will become known
as the European consultative council. The scheme, expected to be formalised by
next summer, is understood to be the largest such project in Britain.
In the UK, it will run in tandem with the company's traditional union
negotiations.
Other UK companies to have set up similar councils include United Biscuits and
ICI.

q.I will take early retirement in the autumn next year with a company pension.
I should be obliged if you could advise me on the various options. These are a
pension of #18,000 a year; one of #15,000 with a #40,000 tax-free lump sum; or
an increase of #1000 in the pension in either case with a reduction of #3000
when I reach 65 and receive the state pension.
I will be 54 when I retire. I have a #30,000 Standard Life low-cost endowment
mortgage at a concessionary rate of 5% which matures in early 2001. I have
savings and investments totalling #28,000. I am married with two children. One
will graduate in the near future and the other has a further three years of
study. I have no other outstanding commitments apart from replacing my company
car.
n.It is worth taking the cash option because if you buy an annuity or invest it
in PEPs you will pay less tax and it also gives more flexibility. At your age
your life expectancy is 21 years. On this basis you would be giving up #30,000
of income in the final 10 years of your life in exchange for an extra #11,000
in your first 11 years of retirement, if you take the #1000 extra option.
You could argue that you will be able to make more use of the extra income when
you are younger, though #1000 does not go far. On the other hand you might be
grateful for the extra income the state pension will bring when the time comes.
You may actually need more income when you are elderly, to pay for nursing home
care for example.
If you have every expectation, on your personal and family health record, of
living to a ripe old age, #1000 a year extra now does not look like much of a
bargain.
q.I am very interested in negotiating a re-mortgage with an alternative lender,
but am concerned about leaving the Halifax Building Society as I would lose my
entitlement to the basic distribution at converson. Obviously final figures are
not available but can you give your estimate of what the basic distribution is
likely to be, so I can properly consider the pros and cons of moving lender?
n.It is estimated that the basic distribution will consist of Halifax shares
with a value of roughly #600. Further information will be given probably
towards the end of 1996 as flotation is not expected before 1997. The exact
timing depends on market conditions.
q.I would like to invest #6000 in a PEP and one friend has recommended the Save
&amp; Prosper general managed PEP while another has suggested Alliance Trust. Could
you give your views on these or any others worth considering?
n.The first thing to remember is that a PEP investment is for the longer term,
meaning at least five years. Save &amp; Prosper has made great strides in recent
years to improve its investment performance and has a good chance of being in
the top performance quartile in future. The advantage of the Alliance Trust PEP
is its very low charges and spread of investment trusts available.
Another you might consider is Schroder, with investment in its UK Enterprise
unit trust which has a strong track record and uses a well-proven selection
method. Perpetual is another manager you might think about. It is impossible to
predict which will perform the best. All you can look for is a consistent
standard of performance across the range of funds of an investment manager,
coupled with low charges.
q.You recently mentioned the possibility of an employee making additional
voluntary contributions to either the employer's pension scheme or to a scheme
of your own choice. Can you say what the limit is for these payments and, if
they have not been made in earlier years, is it possible to catch up by
increasing payments this year?
n.A person in pensionable employment is allowed tax relief on contributions of
up to 15% of earnings, subject to a maximum earnings limit of #78,600. The
total of normal annual contributions plus additional voluntary contributions
(AVCs) must not exceeed the 15% limit.
For example, if your employer's scheme is contributory and you normally pay 5%
of salary, you may make AVCs of up to 10% of earnings to either your employer's
scheme or to a free-standing AVC plan. For this purpose, earnings usually
includes salary, bonus, commission and the value of taxable benefits in kind.
Unlike retirement annuity contracts and personal pension plans for the
self-employed and individuals not in pensionable employment, it is not possible
to obtain tax relief for unused limits for earlier years. Nor is it possible to
relate payments back to an earlier year. If, therefore, you are considering
AVCs action is required before April 5 for relief to be obtained in the current
tax year.
q.My wife and I separated last January but as it has only recently become clear
there will be no reconciliation I have not yet informed my tax office. What
will be the position regarding the married man's allowance which I still
receive, and what tax relief will I be entitled to for maintenance payments?
n.As your separation is now permanent you should advise the Inland Revenue as
soon as possible. The date of separation falls part way through the tax year
1994-95 but you will be entitled to the full married couple's allowance for
that year. The allowance ceases to be available for the tax year 1995-96
onwards. To qualify for tax relief maintenance must be paid under a court order
or a legally binding agreement between you both drawn up by your lawyer.
You will be able to claim tax relief on payments up to the amount of the
married couple's allowance (#1720). The relief is usually given in your PAYE
coding in place of the allowance. Your wife will not be liable to tax on the
payments she receives from you, but you are not entitled to tax relief on the
excess if the maintenance exceed the limit.
When you inform the tax office you will be required to complete a form giving
full details of the separation and to supply a copy of the maintenance order or
agreement.
q.Following the recent press coverage over Shell Brent Spar and British Gas
boardrooom salaries, the role of pension funds in applying pressure to these
companies was raised.
I wrote to the pension fund managers for our company asking them to provide me
with details of equities held and explain the rationale for investments, that
is maximising returns versus so-called ethical considerations. I was told that
only figures for the top-10 UK and foreign holdings were available, from the
annual report. A very detailed breakdown of equities held by geography and
business sector was also available.
Can you advise what rights I have to obtain a more detailed breakdown of
equities held? Can you also provide details of any organisations that can help
employees/members of pension funds extract more information?
n.The only obligation the fund has is to provide details of investments held in
the annual report to members in the way yours does. But there is no reason why
the fund manager should not also supply a list of the shares held at the date
of the report.
It might be better to approach the trustees, through the member-appointed
trustee if there is one, rather than go directly to the manager. It is likely
they will have a more detailed breakdown. Getting information out of trustees
should be easier when new rules come into effect in April 1997. These will give
members the right to appoint at least one-third of them.
There is no reason why you should not receive a detailed breakdown more often
than once a year, after all the fund manager only has to press a button on his
computer to get a print out of the portfolio. In practice the manager is likely
to resist this because it would be like having someone peering over his
shoulder.
There are two organisations active in this area, the Pensions Industry Research
Committee (0171 250 3311) and the Ethical Investment Research Service (0171 735
1351).
q.On my retirement in July 1994 I was advised to invest #6000 in M&amp;G Dividend
fund. I realise the first year incurs charges but still think the return is
disappointing. After six months it was valued at #5980 and after a year #6224.
Should I continue with this PEP? I was also advised to invest #7000 in a
Prudential with-profits bond. I am puzzled by the life assurance factor. Also
your opinion on its performance would be appreciated. I have no need of income
from these investments.
n.A year or so is far too short a time in which to assess the performance of an
investment based on shares. Both the products you refer to are well regarded
and you should stick with them. If after four or five years they are
disappointing you could think again, but you must give them a fair chance.
The life assurance element of the Prudential bond you can ignore - it is just a
technicality. It is a low-risk investment designed to provide a steady
performance over the long term with low volatility. You don't have to receive
the income on either product. If it is not necessary, it can be reinvested.
q.I have held Abbey National and TSB shares since flotation at cost prices of
100p and 115p respectively. Despite your oft quoted advice about not putting
too many eggs in one basket, I kept the holdings in anticipation of an Abbey
National takeover of TSB. Instead it was Lloyds. I recently read that an
analyst said Lloyds shares were over-bought? What does this mean? Should I sell?
n.When an analyst takes the view that a share has been over-bought he is saying
the price has been driven too high by the weight of buying. There is some
evidence this has occurred with Lloyds, and, therefore, TSB. Indeed, the whole
banking sector looks pricey.
There is nothing wrong with taking a profit. You have done well out of the two
shares. As you do not tell us what other investments you have or how large your
holdings in Abbey National and TSB are, it is difficult to give specific
advice. You could sell the TSB and reinvest the proceeds elsewhere, while
holding on to Abbey National in the hope of it being involved in corporate
activity and perhaps benefiting from a pick-up in the housing market.

ARGYLL'S Safeway food chain hopes to increase the appeal of its ABC customer
loyalty cards by adding a direct-debit feature.
A top Argyll executive said the group plans to make the transformation next
year. Shoppers would be able to pay for their groceries with the ABC card,
which already entitles them to discounts and special offers.
Safeway's loyalty card scheme was expanded from 130 to all 365 of its stores on
October 23, just a few weeks after rival Tesco announced a 16% rise in interim
profits. The success of Tesco's own loyalty card was mainly credited for the
increase.
Argyll chairman Sir Alistair Grant said Safeway's ABC loyalty scheme had been a
great success in its first six weeks of operation. About 3.5 million shoppers
already have the card. It is used by up to 70% of customers at some Safeway
stores.
``It's been very helpful,'' Mr Grant said. ``We think it has put up sales two
or three points already.'' He said the recently-announced Christmas price watch
guarantee and the popular ``Harry'' television advertisements also had Safeway
heading for strong Christmas sales.
The ``Harry'' adverts, featuring a worldly-wise young child shopping with his
parents, have the highest recognition rating of any food store television
campaign.
The ABC card will also be used in conjunction with Safeway's self-scanning
shopping, where customers use a hand-held unit to scan their own groceries and
cut down on checkout time. The card will be used to unlock the scanning units
from a dispenser.
Self-scanning is already being used in the company's Airdrie and Perth stores.
The system will be installed in another 30 UK stores by the end of this year.

BY August next year a 110,000 sq ft factory on the Queenslie Industrial Estate,
on the edge of Glasgow's Easterhouse, will be put to productive use again, for
the first time since the early eighties.
Once the Olivetti company made typewriters here. But, long before manual
keyboards gave way to personal computers, laser printers and word processing
packages, the place closed, one more victim of the waves of corporate
restructuring which swept Scotland at that time.
In phases next year, the new occupant, a 50-year-old local family-owned
business, will turn this echoing space into a factory manufacturing furniture.
Sakol Furniture currently makes its ranges of mainly lounge furniture, in a
listed maze of mill buildings in Fielden Street, in another part of Glasgow's
East End.
Display, cocktail and corner units start as raw sheet materials and wood
veneers, being broken down into sections, matched, machined, assembled,
finished and polished on three floors in an operation which - due to the
building's daunting layout - renders the use of modern production flow
techniques impossible.
The move to Queenslie will be a liberation. It should radically reduce the time
spent by the 120 staff moving products from floor to floor by one cramped lift.
It will maximise the efficiencies to be gained from Sakol's investment in
modern woodworking equipment. But Queenslie is also twice the size of Fielden
Street. And furniture sales are heavily dependent on the buoyancy of a housing
market which, in recent years in the UK, has been pretty much in the doldrums.
So is the family behind Sakol Furniture being over ambitious? Are they biting
off more than they can chew? Gordon Sakol, who with brother Derek constitutes
the second generation in charge at Fielden Street, says they have spent much of
the 50th anniversary year debating that very point.
They have decided - with Sakol already a well-established and respected name in
the UK marketplace and beginning to make inroads into Ireland as well, and with
a healthy financial base from which to expand - that this is the moment to move
forward.
``Some people advised us that this is not the time to move,'' says Gordon
Sakol, the company's finance director. ``But things have gone in cycles from
when time began. We've come out of every cycle to date. And inevitably the
housing market and demand for furniture will bounce off the floor once more.
``As a company we are solid enough and sufficiently well-known to grow and
diversify and secure our place in the market when it turns up. We are confident
we can double sales in the next five years and, as a result, increase our
workforce by 25%.''
I admire that kind of commitment, from family owners who, given the reserves
built up over the past 50 years and their present profitable place in a highly
competitive marketplace, could freewheel for years without taking on any
additional risk.
But, like a lot of other family businesses, the Sakols seem to really care
about the people around them, many of whom have worked for the business for 30
years or more. ``We feel very strongly about them,'' says Gordon. ``We've got a
social conscience.''
Jim Carr, who is general manager in charge of production and has been with the
business since he was 16, is looking forward to the move. Frank Denny, the
production manager, who showed me round Fielden Street has had two spells at
Sakol Furniture and, this time, plans to continue until he's 70.
That kind of two-way commitment matters. Although most furniture making has
long since moved from solid wood to veneered composite boards, the craft skills
needed to retain a reputation for quality are still in demand. And, as Gordon
Sakol confirms, some skills are in short supply.
The roots of the present-day Sakol Furniture stretch back to before the Second
World War when Derek and Gordon's grandfather refurbished and resold
second-hand furniture from a barrow. Then, when their uncle Jack returned from
the army, came the move into manufacture.
In those days family-owned furniture businesses flourished in towns and cities
all over the country. Jack's brothers, Malcolm and Bernard, joined the business
too. Malcolm, who is now company chairman, undertook the main selling role, at
a time when the number of local manufacturers was matched by a plethora of
independent retail outlets.
When Malcolm was out on the road, Gordon recalls, he might have three or four
calls to make in a place the size of Kilmarnock. ``Now you can hardly find a
single independent furniture retailer in a town the size of Leeds.''
The shift in the balance of furniture retailing to the multiples and
increasingly demanding customers - they want more and more detail such as
curves and bits carved out, says Gordon, and they can drop a fad, like that for
limed oak finishes, within two seasons of it being introduced - present big
challenges to a manufacturer the size of Sakol.
The present team - Derek, who left a career as an architect 10 years ago to
become managing director, but still deploys some of his old skills designing
new ranges, and Gordon, who is a chartered accountant - have just appointed a
new sales director, Ken McConnell, from a large retailer, and are, despite all
these challenges, looking to the future with confidence.
Just before he died two months ago, Derek and Gordon talked to their own
father, Bernard, about their expansion plans. They took him to see the new
premises. He approved. Sakol Furniture has set its face against stagnating.
Growth, it believes, is the only way forward.

Jim Hewitson in his latest missive from Orkney, reflects on longevity, the
importance of correct headgear and the strange object supplied by the council
AH, AUTUMN, season of mists and Nora Batty hats, of mellow fruitfulness and
lifeboat guild bring-and-buy sales. At least that man Keats got it half right.
We may not have the traditional piles of leaves to scuff around here in the
treeless kingdom of Papa Westray but in her russet train autumn does bring
heaps of activity hereabouts.
It wouldn't be fitting, however, to launch into my regular dispatch from the
outer edge without making mention of a man who saw more Papay autumns than
most. Johnny from North Rendall who died in October had a lifetime which
stretched from one end of the century to the other, and was one of the small
band of islanders who were children during the First World War.
We'll miss his rattly old van which gave him freedom when arthritis, the curse
of these damp north isles, set in. He was the slowest driver in Christendom -
and proud of it - and invariably you would find him sitting down by the pier,
waiting for the creel boats to return from Weelie's Taing, pipe smoke
spiralling from the driver's window, the finger raised in salute of the passing
backpacker.
Johnny was a big man in every way and it's strange, isn't it, how we all have
very different memories of folk who've finally jumped aboard the Stygian ferry.
On the eve of the funeral, fencehanging north of Daybreak as Bill o' the Links
weeded his tatties, I recalled Johnny talking of the great adventure of his
life, a voyage to join the Hudson's Bay Company, cut short by the Second World
War. In fact, Johnny had seldom been off his isle. Bill, on the other hand,
remembered his almost obsessive fear of mice.
Four score years and more was Johnny's allocation and he made use of every
precious moment.
The lifeboat guild bring-and-buy is a traditional landmark at the threshold of
winter and an opportunity I seldom miss to supplement my stock of ever-more
outlandish, even eccentric, headgear. Over the years I've collected all sorts
of tammies, balaclavas, caps, bunnets and helmets, everything from my
bait-stained Thunder Anchor baseball cap, which qualified me as a sort of
Nordic Hemingway, to a woolly Tibetan affair kindly brought back from the top
of the world by Jocelyn of Micklegarth.
My collection is, of course, a working one and selection of appropriate
headgear for weather conditions is always an important moment in the day.
Anyway the clothes stall at the sale round at the school had the usual
treasures from the island attics, some of the recycled articles I'm sure making
their second or third appearance at the annual sale. I'm fairly certain that
Dick Francis thriller was the self-same novel which I introduced to the
merry-go-round in the early eighties.
There amidst the offerings was a green silk Nora Batty turban which I
immediately coveted. Morag, knowing my headgear fetish well enough, threatened
to walk out when I made to try it on for size. Worse, while we argued the toss,
Jim the postie stepped in to snap up a brown checked bunnet with an expanding
headband which had been my second choice. Since then Jim has taking to slipping
it on his head whenever I'm down at Backaskaill buying stamps. But mock not,
Jim. There's always next year.
I did come away with a nice windcheater, a plastic stegosaurus, and a neat
leather belt, so all was not lost. More importantly the sale, including the
obligatory tea and Papay home-bakes, raised the staggering total of #350 for
the work of the RNLI from the 40 or so folk who attended.
Elsewhere, the CIA can relax. Put away the X-Files and forget about the Papay
parallelogram. The rash of wee green plastic cones in Papa Westray's back
gardens is not the vanguard of some alien invasion fleet. The cones are nothing
more sinister than our latest earth-friendly bins, enabling the citizens of the
far-flung isles to recycle all our food waste in our own backyards. In an
ambitious move the Orkney Islands Council has offered a bin to every household,
and by all accounts there's been a good take-up.
However here at School Place, at least, we're struggling to fill the cone, what
with a dog (recently arrived Spot), cats, goat and donkey, as well as the
horses, constantly on the lookout for food scraps, there's not a lot left over
to consign to the decomposition basket. More than 100 local authorities in
Britain have already tested and are introducing the bin, according to the
publicity blurb.
However, one important element in the scheme may be lacking in this vicinity.
Apparently you need plenty of sunshine to allow the process to build up a head
of steam.
If, however, the cones fail in their original purpose we can always adapt them
as space-age lobster creels, landing markers up at the airstrip, conical rabbit
hutches, gargantuan flower pots or maybe, just maybe, with a bit of clever
hacksaw work all-weather mobile shelters, made-to-measure body armour to keep
out the Atlantic blousters.
The cone people of Papa Westray - that would be something special for the US
spy satellites to cast their beady lenses upon.

n Wheels in motion: Elaine Maudsley waits patiently on the station at
Carnforth, recalling the time 50 years ago when she appeared in Brief
Encounter, left. The film is the centre-piece of a proposed tourist attraction,
to be housed at the station. Here Celia Johnson as Laura, tells Myrtle Bagot
(Joyce Carey) and Albert Godby (Stanley Holloway) how it all began: ``just
through me getting a little piece of grit in my eye.''
Elaine Maudsley saw the blossoming of Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard's
hopeless love in Carnforth tearoom. Now, Gavin Bell reveals, she may see the
atmosphere of Brief Encounter again
For passengers on the West Coast main line between Scotland and the south,
Carnforth Station in Lancaster is a brief encounter. From the windows of an
Intercity express hurtling through it, there is a blur of boarded-up buildings,
a high wire fence enclosing the platforms, and a big old clock. It is unlikely
that passengers notice the clock displays a choice of times on its two faces,
and neither is correct.
The errant clock is at least in keeping with the atmosphere of the station, a
forlorn place abandoned by railway staff more than 20 years ago and left to
mourn alone the passing of the age of steam which once breathed clamorous life
through it. Now efforts are being made to revive its fortunes by re-creating a
romantic episode in its history - when it was transformed into Milford
Junction, where Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard gazed at one another with
hopeless love in David Lean's black and white classic Brief Encounter.
On the 50th anniversary of the making of the film, there are proposals to
create a themed restaurant and a small exhibition centre in the buildings which
appeared in some of the most poignant scenes. It is envisaged that the
restaurant in the old booking hall would have posters and other memorabilia of
the film, while a visitors' centre in the former refreshment room would have
audio and visual displays featuring Noel Coward's screenplay and the haunting
theme music from Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto.
The initiative has come from Railtrack, which acquired the station last year
from the British Rail property board. A long-term lease on generous terms has
been offered to prospective developers, and a short-list of interested parties
is being drawn up with a view to reaching a decision in a few months. The lease
extends only to the buildings, as two of the platforms are still used for local
train services.
Steve Tyler, a Railtrack spokes-man, sees the old refreshment room being
restored to the way it was in the 1940s, with LMS teacups, a big tea urn and
rock cakes, and monitors playing various scenes from the film.
``We're open to offers, of course, but we're hoping potential entrepreneurs
will share our vision for Carnforth. We get lots of tourists turning up to
wander around, and some of them even know the lines and re-enact their
favourite scenes on the platform. But there's nothing for them to see really,
it's a bit disappointing for them. So we're hoping this will be the answer.''
Many of the enthusiasts are Japanese - apparently there is a cinema in Tokyo
that shows the film throughout the year because Japanese have a high regard for
chaste love.
Mr Tyler points out that there is already a Brief Encounter restaurant at a
station near Norwich, which does good business, and he suggests the real thing
offers an even better investment opportunity. ``Apart from the romantic
aspect,'' he says, ``it is good for us to have a thriving business at the
station that creates a good image and attracts further investment in the
railways.''
A good omen is the recent recovery of a plaque commemorating the making of the
film, which was stolen from the station two years ago. It seems the thief had a
twinge of conscience, because it turned up in a plastic bag on the steps of a
nearby police station. It is now at Lancaster museum, pending the refurbishment
of the station.
Carnforth has an added attraction in an engine shed near the station, where a
private collector has assembled a museum of steam engines and rolling stock. It
attracts a large number of railway buffs, particularly for summer excursions on
the old trains, who would probably enjoy a cuppa in a 1940s Brief Encounter
tearoom while watching Lean's dramatic scenes of steam engines roaring past the
platforms.
But it will take some impressive special effects to re-create the magic of
Carnforth in the era of Brief Encounter. In those days, all the LMS trains
heading north would stop to take on coal and water for the long climb up Shap
Fell. The refreshment room on the island platform was continually busy with
passengers waiting for their locomotives to refuel, or for connections to Leeds
and Manchester. The railway was the biggest employer in the town, and the
station was its heart, throbbing to the sound of steam and whistles.
Now the water tower and the gas lamps have gone, the station master's office
has been demolished, and electrification has covered the tracks with a cobweb
of power lines. Only local services to and from places like Morecambe and
Barrow stop here now, and you have to buy your ticket on the train because
there has been no railway staff at Carnforth since the early 1970s.
But the fine old buildings are intact, defying dereliction with handsome
facades of local sandstone and ornate windows that give them the genteel
appearance of a country manor house rather than a railway station.
Local sentiment has been offended by the run-down of the station. ``It's a
disgrace now,'' says taxi driver John Bainbridge. ``Falling to bits, it is.
It's a shame really, because Carnforth was a beautiful old station, always well
looked after.''
The scheme to renovate it has the unqualified approval of Mrs Elaine Maudsley,
a former waitress in the refreshment room who appeared briefly in the film as
an extra. ``I'm thrilled for Carnforth this is happening,'' she says.
Mrs Maudsley is enjoying a brief return to the media spotlight as a local
celebrity, half a century after her acting debut: ``It's lovely being reminded
of those days. There was such a sense of comradeship after the war, and of
course when the film people arrived it was very exciting.'' She remembers being
paid the huge sum of 37s 6d a night for walking up and down the platform, at a
time when her weekly wage was 10s 6d.
She also remembers Stanley Holloway, as the station ticket collector, ruining
several shots by grabbing playfully at her leg as he climbed on to the platform
from the tracks. ``Everybody was laughing, but eventually Mr Lean told me to
move further up the platform.''
Mrs Maudsley has another reason for remembering the refreshment room with
fondness. A few months after the film crew left, a young man working in an
ammunition dump across the road came in for a morning coffee. ``I was engaged
to somebody else at the time, but he had the most wonderful voice and I fell
for him just like that, and he fell for me. We were married six months later.''
The marriage lasted 46 years, until her husband's death three years ago. Mrs
Maudsley regrets that he did not live to see the restoration of the station:
``He would have loved all this, he really would.''
So whatever happens at Carnforth, passengers flashing through the little
station may reflect that at least one brief encounter there lasted a lifetime.

SCOTTISH Widows Investment Management, the fund management subsidiary of
Scottish Widows, obviously believes that crime does pay. It has taken a small
stake in the Corrections Corporation, the largest prison management company in
the US.
Investment manager Alan Denholm sounded more like Tory ministers Michael Howard
or Michael Forsyth when he explained the reason behind the investment, saying:
``It is undoubtedly a growing business.''
Perhaps in the not too distant future we will witness takeover battles within
the Edinburgh financial community, with the customers, formerly known as
inmates, being offered sweetners to favour a particular company.
Scottish Widows Investment Management could in these circumstances steal a
march on its rivals by offering prisoners in Barlinnie or Saughton the
opportunity to exchange a cell in Glasgow or Edinburgh for one in Miami.
Copter across
the Mersey
IT would be factually incorrect to say Clyde Helicopters is spreading its
wings, but you will understand what I mean when I explain that it is now
offering Liver Bird tours across the Mersey which allow passengers to see some
of the sights of Liverpool from 1500ft up.
Liverpool is famous for both its Anglican and Roman Catholic cathedrals, and
during a recent press preview trip the pilot, having passed the Anglican
establishment, pointed downwards saying: ``And that's the Catholic Cathedral''.
A local journalist shouted from the back of the Jet Ranger helicopter: ``No it
isn't, that's Paddy's Wigwam.''
Anyone who knows the cathedral would agree it is an apt description, although
perhaps not a politically correct statement, and I'm sure it is an accurate
reflection of Liverpudlian humour.
Capital launch
pad for service
THE fund management community was out in force this week for a party in
Edinburgh hosted by Reuters, the financial information and news agency group.
John Parcell, managing director of Reuters UK and Ireland, was among those
attending. I am not biased but he has a lot going for him. He was once a
journalist. In fact, he was a frontline Reuters correspondent in Cambodia for
four years, which may be why he decided to cross over to management.
The strength of Scotland's financial sector explains why the information group
has chosen Edinburgh for its UK launch next week of a service which delivers
brokers' research on screen, saving a few forests in the process.
Making Poland
miles better
MICHAEL Kelly still carries Glasgow's banner whenever he is given the
opportunity. He has just returned from a trip to Lublin in Poland where he was
attending a seminar supported by the British Know How Fund to advise the Polish
city on how best to market itself.
The Glasgow's Miles Better campaign was taken as a model and Kelly, who was
Lord Provost when it was launched, was asked to outline the benefits it brought
to the city.
While in Lublin, he met Professor James Craig, who was helping organise the
seminar. Craig, a former member of the Islanders folk group, has been living in
Poland for 10 years.
Art show does
the business
SEVERAL weeks ago we told Business Diary readers of a Patrons &amp; Painters
Exhibition in The Smith Gallery being held to raise funds for the Prince's
Scottish Youth Business Trust as well as promoting up and coming artists.
We are pleased to report that it was a resounding success with #10,000 worth of
art being sold. We are told that among those who bought paintings were former
Euro MP, and strong supporter of the arts, Janey Buchan, and Scottish TV's Kaye
Adams.
The organiser, photographer John Rae, was delighted to be able to present a
cheque for #4500 to the PSYBT as a result. The cash will fund two new
businesses in Central Region.
Telling tales from
dizzy heights
LORD Weir was seen recently at the top of tall, rather ancient library steps in
the lower Signet Library in Edinburgh, but he was not searching for an antique
tome.
He was, in fact, giving a speech at a dinner to mark the retirement of Bob
Knox, senior maritime partner at Henderson Boyd Jackson.
It appears that in their student days the pair were climbing buddies, and the
industrialist was using the steps to demonstrate how they had scaled some dizzy
heights in their time.
Speaking easy
out in Beirut
ANN Murdoch of Speakeasy Scotland thought someone was pulling her leg when she
answered the phone in her home at Lower Largo and heard a voice saying: ``This
is Beirut calling.''
However, it turned out the caller wanted her to provide a speaker for a St
Andrew's night do in the Lebanese capital organised by the local Caledonian
Society.
This is the reason Bob Crampsey's dulcet tones were not heard over the airwaves
last Saturday coming from a Scottish football ground - he was entertaining
several hundred guests in Beirut's city hall.
Horsing around
the new houses
EDINBURGH is soon to receive its eleventh equestrian statue thanks to a deal
between Edinburgh District Council and Cala Homes Scotland.
The bronze statue will stand outside the company's Silvermills development in
Stockbridge as part of the Percent for Art scheme under which the developer
provides a public work of art.
Sculptor Eoghan Bridge, who specialises in horse subjects, has agreed to
include an eagle in his work at the special request of Cala Homes chairman Alan
Downie. ``I call our management team the Eagles,'' Downie explains, ``so you
could say this is a way of recognising their successes over the last few
years.''
Bridge has now created a quarter-size model of Horse, Rider, Eagle which will
stand 13ft high when finished next spring. Perhaps locals will dub it The Eagle
Has Landed when it appears on their landscape.

Anne Johnstone finds a wealth of imagination in store for younger readers
in the latest stirring tales
CHRISTMAS came early this year to the Palmer family, thanks to The Herald.
Faced with the pleasantly festive task of choosing a selection of best books
for under-eights, we recruited the critical faculties of this family of small
bookworms who live at Carbeth near Glasgow: Jack, seven; Harriet, five;
Charlie, four; baby Lucy, and their mum, Debbie. They fell on the task with
enormous enthusiasm and, on your behalf, waded through more than 40 books in
three days. Here's our choice for each child.
Baby Lucy. Lucy's attention span is a bit limited just now, seeing as she's
barely two months old! But within a year she'll be a toddler spurning rattles
and mobiles and (if her siblings are anything to go by) already a budding print
addict. Debbie would be delighted if friends and relatives opt to give their
latest addition books instead of toys but when you've had four children you're
entitled to admit that lots of baby books are extremely tedious for mum. This
time Debbie is going on strike. ``Now they have to enchant me too. I'm tired of
boring baby books.''
Here is her selection for Lucy: What's Hiding Here (Dorling Kindersley Snap
Shot book, #2.99). ``We all loved this with its clear bright photographs,''
says Debbie. What's munching behind the leaf? What's stored in the toolbox?
Lift the flaps to find out. This is just the sort of thing to appeal to a
baby's natural curiosity. Playtime Rhymes by Sally Gardner (Orion, #10.99).
``I'm going straight out to get this. It's much more than a nursery rhyme book,
many of which are full of ditties you never hear these days. This one has
lovely illustrations and it includes all the rhymes our children encounter at
school and playgroup (for example Five Little Ducks and Three Little Monkeys).''
The Walker Baby Bear, 25 Stories for the Very Young (Walker Books, #9.99).
``Great value and lots of my favourite authors and illustrators are included,''
says Debbie, but she wasn't sure about the way whole books were crammed on to
one or two spreads. ``Toddlers love the excitement of turning the page to find
out what happens next.''
Stroke Henry by Rod Campbell (Campbell Books #4.50), a tough board book which
invites young readers to touch and feel different textures - a clean towel, a
shiny ball, and Henry the dog's tickly tummy.
Charlie (4): Charlie is a blond charmer with lots of energy and very definite
ideas about what he likes.
Maisy's House by Lucy Cousins (Walker Books, #12.99). Not so much a book, more
an amazing free-standing model of the mad mouse's house. ``This is my best
one,'' grins Charlie. A small book guides you through Maisy's day from the
first brush of the gnashers to the final goodnight. You create the action with
press-out models.
There It Is! by Richard Fowler (Campbell Books, #5.99). An I-Spy game in book
form. ``Boys seem to love these books. Because the pictures are so busy and
complex, it takes them ages to find things which is great for keeping them
quiet.'' says Debbie.
The Snow Lambs by Debi Gliori (Andre Deutsch, #9.99). This beautiful and
original book is based in Scotland, like its author. Sam, a farmer's son, loses
Bess his beloved sheepdog. The warm, golden farmhouse interior contrasts with
the grey icy night outside as Sam frets about Bess, but all ends happily.
The Cross Rabbit by Nick Butterworth (Collins, #4.99). Another gentle tale of
Percy the park keeper and his friends. Charlie says watch out for the sledging
mice.
Two Bears and Joe by Penelope Lively (Viking, #9.99). Another daydream book
with animal connections in the Lion in the Meadow mode. This one is brought to
life by Jan Ormerod's charming illustrations. ``I like those bears,'' says
Charlie.
Harriet (5) is very competent and independent for her age. Her often serious
expression hides an impish sense of fun. She reads well but still likes to be
read to.
The Sleeping Beauty by Phillida Gili (Transworld, #9.99). ``I loved this one
best and I took it to bed with me. It's a pop-up where wonderful things happen.
Look, the spinning wheel actually turns round,'' says Harriet.
An Edwardian Doll's House (HarperCollins, #12.99) is another piece of amazing
paper engineering. Climb the stairs, open the cupboards, even lift the loo
seat! But is it really a book?
The Jolly Pocket Postman (Heinemann, #10.99) by Janet and Allan Ahlberg. Anyone
else would have flogged this concept to death by now but in the hands of the
Ahlbergs (Janet sadly died this year), the Jolly Postman seems to ride on
forever. This time he flies, too, and even shrinks.
A Band of Joining-In Stories (Doubleday, #9.99). Pat Thomson is an anthologist
with an unerring eye for stories with child appeal. This latest volume with 11
stories offers unbeatable value.
Little Green Fingers by Mary Ann Van Hage (Macdonald Young Books, #8.99). An
attractive book with bright illustrations and easy-to-follow instructions for
the embryonic gardener. Harriet liked the idea of hyacinths in a basket
decorated with little pink and mauve stars. An attractive Christmas present she
could make on her own.
Jack (7) is a fluent and voracious reader of both fiction and non-fiction. He
loves poetry. His choice: Dinosaur (Viking, #8.99) in the World Unfolds series.
In this clever concept, there's a choice between reading it as a book or
unfolding it as a chart. It's wise not to underestimate the amount and level of
scientific information which a bright and well-motivated seven or
eight-year-old can absorb. This book doesn't.
Knights by John Howe (Tango Books, #12.99). A dragon rears itself from the page
and you get to find out what a medieval knight wore under his armour in this
clever and exciting pop-up.
Little Wolf's Book of Badness by Ian Whybrow (Collins, #9.99). ``In the morning
I didn't get dressed until I'd finished it,'' says Jack. The story is a zany
inversion in which Little Wolf is expelled from the lair to be made bad at
Uncle Bigbad's Cunning College. Rib-tickling pictures by the ubiquitous Tony
Ross.
Monster Poems, collected by John Foster (OUP, #3.99). Delightfully scary poems
on such universal themes as the teacher who mutates into a monster and the
monster behind the loo. Wickedly funny illustrations by Korky Paul.
Lassie Comes Home by Eric Knight (Hamish Hamilton, #10.99) may be a bit
sickeningly sentimental for mum but six and seven-year-olds like their slush
undiluted. Rosemary Wells' retelling of this classic tale of a collie's
hazardous lone journey across Scotland at the turn of the century, filled the
bill for Jack, especially Susan Jeffers's illustrations.

CHRISTMAS books don't make great Christmas presents because children want to
read them in the run up to December 25 rather than on the day itself.
Nevertheless, there's a gigantic market in them. Here are the ones the Palmer
children liked best.
The Story of Christmas (Dorling Kindersley, #7.99), ages four to seven. Anita
Ganeri's simple yet moving text and big bright photos of a rather up-market
school nativity make this book irresistible.
Maisie's Merry Christmas by Aileen Paterson (The Amaising Publishing House,
#3.50), ages four to eight, in which Maisie lands the starring role in
Cinderella in the Morningsaide panto. ``I enjoyed the jokes but felt most of
them went right over the children's heads,'' says Debbie Palmer. Only her
seven-year-old listened to the end. ``I liked the budgie best,'' he says.
The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey by Susan Wojciechowski (Walker Books,
#9.99), ages four to nine, is a strongly moralistic Christian tale with
fabulous illustrations by P J Lynch. ``It was the best sort of story because it
made me cry in the middle but it was happy at the end,'' says Jack.
Letters from Father Christmas by J R R Tolkien (Collins, #12.99), ages five
plus, uses Ahlberg-style pull-out letters in these facsimile extracts of
Tolkien's original letters written to his youngest son Christopher. Follow the
adventures of the naughty North Polar Bear and Ilbereth, the elf. ``We all
really loved this. It's the sort of book you would come back to again and
again,'' says Debbie.
A Message for Santa by Hiawyn Oram and Tony Ross (Andersen Press, #8.99), ages
three to eight. FC has an exchange of correspondence with Emily who likes
everything about Christmas except Santa coming down the chimney. ``A lot of
children share this fear, including one of ours, and I think this book tackles
the subject brilliantly,'' says Debbie. Santa proves most understanding. Well,
he would, wouldn't he? Hope he's good to you, too.

KEEP it in the family has long been one of Hollywood's mottos. In the silent
era, various sets of sisters arrived in Los Angeles to make their names in the
movies.
The Talmadge girls did well for themselves, at least in terms of who they
married: Norma's husband was studio chief Joseph Schenck, while her sister
Natalie married Schenck's biggest star - Buster Keaton. Constance Talmadge was
a featured player with D.W Griffith's company. It also employed Lillian and
Dorothy Gish, who had come to Hollywood for Lillian's role in Griffith's The
Birth of a Nation in 1914. Four years later they starred together in Hearts of
the World.
During the 1920s, the Barrymores - one of America's greatest and oldest acting
dynasties - first came to prominence. John, Ethel and Lionel came from theatre
and made their names - independently - in Hollywood. In 1932 they made their
one and only film together - Rasputin and the Empress.
While the Barrymores were hamming it up as the Russian royals, the mischievous
Marx Brothers were creating havoc in a string of comedies at Paramount Studios.
The four Marxes - Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo - all appeared in The
Cocoanuts (1930), Animal Crackers (1930), Monkey Business (1931), Horse
Feathers (1932) and Duck Soup (1933). Even more brothers, and a few sisters,
appeared in Mr Smith Goes to Washington in 1939. Bumbling governor Guy Kibbee's
young brood was played by the Watson children - Coy, Vivian, Gloria, Louise,
Harry, Billy, Delmar, Garry and Bobs.
Of all the Watson weans, Bobs was the only successful child actor (he also
appeared in Boys Town with Mickey Rooney and Spencer Tracy, and On Borrowed
Time, with the aforementioned Lionel Barrymore). In many cases in Hollywood
history, one sibling is a star, and the other(s) can merely revel in or rebel
against reflected glory, his/her own talent obscured by comparisons.
Eric Roberts (who topped the cast list of the well-received 1984 movie, The
Pope of Greenwich Village) may well have had starring roles long before anyone
had heard of Pretty Woman, but now he is only thought of as the brother of
Julia. They appeared together on film before Julia had hit the big time - in a
dire movie called Blood Red, in 1988.
Beau Bridges is in a similar predicament: his acting career may stretch back to
the 1940s, but baby brother Jeff is the one with the looks and the fan club
that goes with them. They acted together as children (their father is actor
Lloyd), but their most famous co-appearance was in The Fabulous Baker Boys with
Michelle Pfeiffer, in 1989.
One solution for siblings who don't wish to overshadow, or be overshadowed by,
one another is to avoid acting together and to change one of their surnames:
Shirley MacLaine and Warren Beatty have both had hugely successful careers
which were entirely independent of each other. Similarly, Joan Fontaine and
Olivia De Havilland never starred in the same movie: they kept their scenes for
the gossip columns which fed off their rivalry and bitchery. They, however,
were both true stars and Oscar winners.

CHRISTMAS has come early for homebuyers. Mortgage rates are down again - and
there's hope of further reductions if the Chancellor takes the hint. The UK's
largest lender, the Halifax, shaved 0.25% from its 7.99% at the end of last
week, meaning a new standard rate of 7.74%. That translates into a fall of
almost #9.50 a month in repayments on a #50,000 interest-only mortgage and just
over #7 for an ordinary repayment loan.
Many other societies and banks have followed suit - although the Royal Bank and
Bank of Scotland have yet to make a move - typically shaving the cost of a
standard mortgages by between 0.2% and 0.4%.
Any cut in repayments is welcomed by borrowers, of course, but the most
important effect of this latest round may be that it adds a bit more confidence
to the housing market. After a long, bleak period, culminating in this summer's
low point, there are tentative signs of a brighter future. New loans promised
to buyers in October, but not yet taken up, topped #4800m, the highest monthly
figure since last November.
Another sign that the worst may be over came in the latest statistics on house
prices. Figures from the Halifax show that although they rose by only 0.3%
during November, that was the fourth consecutive monthly increase.
``This small monthly rise is encouraging,'' the society says. ``It confirms our
view that house prices are no longer generally falling and remain more or less
stable. Any rises will depend on improvements in consumer confidence which
should occur as incomes are boosted by tax cuts in 1996.''
Mortgage lenders were disappointed Chancellor Kenneth Clarke failed to announce
any specific help for the housing market in the Budget. Many had been hoping
for the abolition of stamp duty which adds at least #600 to the cost of buying
a home valued at #60,000 or more. And some had been looking for alterations to
the mortgage tax relief system to provide a special boost for first-time buyers.
But in the absence of any specific aid, mortgage lenders have decided to strike
out alone. This is the second time in recent months they have cut rates without
the spur of a reduction in bank base rates. The last move downwards was in
September when Abbey National led the way with a 0.35% cut even though bank
rates had not budged.
That action by lenders didn't prompt a reduction in interest rates generally
but it looks like being more successful this time. Pressure is mounting on the
Government and the Bank of England to announce a cut sooner rather than later
to provide the boost to the economy lacking in the Budget.
As mortgage lenders have twice pre-empted the Government, they may not respond
with further reductions if the next fall in bank base rates is very small. Even
so, many lenders are looking for further cuts in home loan costs in the near
future and economists believe interest rates will remain low for the next two
years.
One result of all this is to make fixed-rate mortgages less attractive. Apart
from headline grabbing rates such as Bristol &amp; West's 0.95% one-year fix for
first-time buyers, longer term rates are pretty much in line with the new lower
variable rates. It looks more sensible, therefore, to opt for a loan that
offers an attractive discount on a variable rate so you will still benefit if
borrowing costs do go even lower.
Meanwhile, hopes that interest rates will revive the housing market could be
wide of the mark if Britain's house valuers are to be believed. A poll by
NatWest found they reckon that cutting rates is a less effective way of
restoring the health of the market than increasing mortgage relief or boosting
jobs - and they believe the changes to income support for mortgages taken out
since October 1 are having a worse effect than envisaged six months ago.
Optimism about the future course of house prices remains pretty high in
Scotland, however. Here 13% of valuers expect they will rise over the next
three months compared with just 2% in the rest of the UK. But there are growing
signs of a mismatch between supply and demand. Although the number of
properties coming on to the market is going up there are fewer buyers.
``Despite this, valuers here are much more optimistic than their southern
colleagues,'' says NatWest. A third of them, more than anywhere else and twice
the proportion for the UK as a whole, believe confidence has returned to the
property market overall.

IF a certain modern princess had listened more carefully in the nursery, she
would have known that the wedding was the end of the fairytale and not the
beginning, and garnered a few useful hints about dealing with adversity.
So let's stop being sniffy about witches, wizards, fabulous beasts, tyrannical
kings and all-conquering heroes. They say, after all, there are only seven
stories and the rest are variations, reworkings and new settings.
Even would-be sophisticates can be charmed with an old-fashioned fairytale at
Christmas. A new selection of Hans Christian Andersen; edited, translated and
illustrated by Erik Blegvad, (Heinemann #12.99), offers a dozen of the prolific
Dane's 156 tales including well-loved favourites such as The Steadfast Tin
Soldier and The Emperor's New Clothes with some likely to be new.
Equally seasonally Scandinavian for young readers are Alf Proysen's Mrs
Pepperpot and Astrid Lindgren's Pippi Longstocking. Pippi Longstocking's
After-Christmas Party (Viking #8.99) is a merry account for newly-independent
readers of just what a good time children can organise for themselves without
meddlesome grown-ups. The ever-dafter adventures of Mrs Pepperpot who shrinks
to the size of her kitchen namesake for a series of strange adventures, and
wages continual battle for supremacy against her dour husband, are as
delightful as ever in the latest paperback collection. It deserves the modern
classics label bestowed by Puffin (#3.50).
Nearer home, Moira Miller's Hamish stories manage to be simultaneously couthy
and supernatural. It is an unlikely, but entertaining combination produced by a
modern Celtic version of ingenuity or courage outsmarting the Wee Folk as
Hamish, Mirren and Mither take on Grizelda Grimithistle and her ilk to avert a
series of domestic disasters from their croft at Camusbuie. Hamish and the Wee
Witch and Hamish and the Fairy Gifts, both with appealing line drawings by
Mairi Hedderwick (Canongate Kelpies #3.50) should be known to every bairn in
Scotland.
Garrison Keillor takes us bang into the commercial reality of television
advertising in Cat, You Better Come Home, a bittersweet fable for a modern age.
It is a gentle pastiche - a concoction of Aesop, Edward Lear and T S Eliot - on
the perils of greed in which a cat called Puff goes off in the huff to lead the
life of Riley, only to return the battered prodigal. This is a picture book for
the not-so-young, the paintings by Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher provide a
visual feast which will appeal to adults as much as children (Faber #9.99).
Paul Warren has created his own mythical world in Caleb Beldragon's Chronicle
of the Three Counties (Heinemann #9.99). It is a runic complexity with its own
history, geography, calendar and legal systems leading to the secret of the
Malbigon. Illustrated with maps and family trees to aid serious puzzle-solvers,
it took the graphic artist turned rock musician 10 years to complete and should
guarantee silence for several hours.
Old tales from many lands are gathered in The Golden Hoard (Orion #14.99), the
first of four volumes of myths and legends from around the world retold by
Geraldine McCaughrean, who has the gift of simplifying without losing the
imagery or characteristic voice of a story. The 22 collected here range from
Robin Hood to Greek, Roman, and Native American myths. They are matched with
similarly simple and colourful paintings by Bee Willey.
The age-old challenge of the tyrant father locking his beautiful daughters away
from the corruption of the outside world is reworked by Garry Kilworth in The
Bronte Girls (Mammoth #3.99). He explores the power struggles which go on
behind the facade of family life in a clever juxtaposition of life in the
Bronte family at Haworth Parsonage as lived out by their latter-day namesakes,
and life in a single-parent family. A fascinating and challenging tale for the
over-11s.
A perfectly-executed fairytale in modern dress is The Big Bazoohley by Peter
Carey (Faber #9.99). This is a tale of a child who saves the day by a
combination of endurance and a particular form of honesty. Full of beautiful
cameos of modern life and lightly salted with hilarity, I hope for more writing
for children from the creator of Oscar and Lucinda.
In a sequel which will delight her many fans, adults as well as children,
Theresa Breslin has brought Kezzie home to Clydeside. A variation on the theme
of exile, A Homecoming for Kezzie (Methuen #10.99) relates the wartime
adventures of the plucky heroine with a tenderness combined with historical
accuracy which will have hankies out throughout the land.
The enduring and delightful Indian (as in cowboys and) Little Bull, from Lynne
Reid Banks, has come out of the cupboard and on to the big screen. The Indian
in the Cupboard (Collins #3.99) has been republished to coincide with the film
version of the engrossing adventures which follow from young Omri's sudden
responsibility for a very demanding Indian Brave.
Probably the girls' equivalent in the tried and tested toys league is the
doll's house. In The Doll's House (Oxford University Press #5.99) Rachel
Anderson plaits three strands of past, present and social class around Number
Seven, the very special present for Miss Amy Winter's seventh birthday.
Cynics should be directed to Fatso in the Red Suit, (Faber #8.99) an all-too
realistic, but nevertheless entertaining collection of poems from Matthew
Sweeney.
Children, on the whole, still prefer to escape into the realm of fantasy - and
there's a bundle of politically-corrected Enid Blytons ranging from adventures
to school stories (Mammoth #2.99) for their stockings.

The leading lady: three-time Oscar nominee Michelle Pfeiffer stars as battling
teacher LouAnne Johnson in her new movie, Dangerous Minds.
Michelle Pfeiffer has Hollywood purring, and the good news is there's more to
come, as sibling Dedee
makes  her own mark in the movie business.
Douglas Thompson watches the birth of a dynasty
THE little sister is short, shapely and sporty with a cheeky grin that matches
her California beach look of skimpy top, bare tight tummy and jeans. Her
superstar sibling has graduated, in public, from a similar and often more
risque surf-bunny style to Armani suits and other essential accoutrements of
Hollywood power dressing, and playing.
Michelle Pfeiffer, 38, three-time Oscar nominee, wife and mother of two
children who maintains she is ``totally happy'' casts a long and absolutely
fabulous shadow.
Dedee Pfeiffer, 30, single but involved with ``a normal guy who works in a
doctor's office'' spent two years in college before joining her sister in the
notoriously fickle acting trade. She's worked in theatre, film, and television.
At present she is one of the stars of Cybill - something of an Absolutely
Fabulous in which she plays the daughter - and it's the most popular comedy
show in America.
Britain is bidding for it at present and it looks destined for the Frasier slot
on Channel 4. In a couple of months we'll see Michelle Pfeiffer in what is
considered another Oscar winning performance in the moving classroom drama
Dangerous Minds.
The two sisters have just completed a movie together, starring with Robert
Redford in Up Close and Personal.
So far, they may not comprise a dynasty like the Redgraves or the Barrymores
but they have arrived as The Fabulous Pfeiffer Girls.
Of course, Dedee used to want to kill her sister. Or at least spit at her. And
vice versa. There were rows over everything - especially clothes. The family
lived, cheque by cheque, on their dedicated Dakota-born father Richard's
earnings.
Dedee says: ``It was fortunate that thrift fashions became popular around that
time. We always made our own clothes. Michelle even made her own jeans.
``I don't remember loving my sister when we were growing up. I remember things
like when Michelle broke my record album. And the time she got into my make-up!
When Mom was away one time we got into a fight and she ripped my hair out. It
wasn't until we got older that we bonded.''
The family lived in the aptly named Midway City, California, where the nearest
excitement was the real life Baywatch territory of Huntington Beach. The
Pfeiffer Girls took to the environment like, well, ducks to water.
Michelle's latest film, Dangerous Minds, is the story of former US Marine
LouAnne Johnson who left her officer's commission to become a school teacher.
The film is based on Johnson's life which she detailed in her book My Posse
Don't Do Homework a title which more accurately described her encounters with
pupils, always anticipating failure rather than success.
The film's class was a mix of actors and gang members hired from the streets of
Los Angeles. On screen they all have attitude.
Big sister was reputed to have had that in her early days. More relaxed than
she has seemed in years Michelle (``I'm too tired to be anything but calm'')
agrees. But what sort of pupil was she really at Fountain valley High School?
``An absent one! I was at the beach. The suntanned one.''
So there was no inspirational teacher like LouAnne Johnson in her education?
``Not really. Nobody that had the kind of investment and energy that LouAnne
had with her students.
``I had one acting teacher who gave me some encouragement in my junior year in
high school - but she doesn't even remember me! And I think that did play a big
part in my becoming an actress.
``But I didn't have anybody as exceptional as LouAnne. That's my one regret
about the movie. I think that, although the teacher is really good, it only
captures a small percentage of who this woman is. I mean she will resort to
anything to get these kids to learn - bribery, trickery.
``At school I just couldn't wait to get out. I was really bored. I wish I had
had someone like LouAnne. Her trick is that she doesn't try to teach them, she
tries to enliven their own desire to learn and their excitement and enthusiasm
about learning. I was lucky to see LouAnne teach a class but my presence became
a bit disruptive. They started paying more attention to me than to her. The
closest thing I could really get to her experience was talking to her and
spending time with her.
``It can be more difficult to portray a real person because one feels a
responsibility to that individual. In a few instances where artistic licence
needed to be taken and we needed to alter something in some slight way I always
felt I had to stay within the truth of LouAnne's story.''
For Dedee Pfeiffer it is staying within the limits of American television's
good taste ``judges'' - some say banshees - that is the problem for her hit
show Cybill. The series is a vehicle for Cybill Moonlighting Shepherd. She's
cast as a fortysomething actress coping with a career, two ex-husbands, two
daughters and a hard-drinking best friend played by the scene-stealing
Christine Baranski who has already established herself as America's version of
our absolutely fab Patsy.
In politically correct America - especially American television - it is a
tightrope every week for the series which, in the US at least, lives up to its
billing as a "bawdy adult comedy."
Dedee loved it from the start. ``I was sent the script and I laughed
hysterically. I really wanted to do it and auditioned. I kept going back and
back and then they started asking me back and I got the role of Rachel which is
great.'' She's in her jeans and halter top and showing off the family blonde
hair - there's Sweden somewhere in the genetics geography - at the CBS TV
studios at the wrong end of Los Angeles where the show is filmed.
She is more casual than her sister. There have not been so many bumps on her
road to attention. But from her start has she boasted a famous surname? ``It
opens doors but it doesn't guarantee you getting the kind of parts that you
want. I think there is a natural curiosity. When I was called in about parts by
people who hadn't seen my prior work there was definitely the curiosity factor.
``They say: `Let's call her in to see if she really is a miniature version of
Michelle.' They found out quickly that is not what walked in the door. After
that I was either right for the role or I wasn't.
``I can understand people thinking I might be a miniature version but the only
real similarity is that we come from the same family.''
Dedee has worked in the spotlight for some years but not one of the intensity
which beams on her sister. She's been on Seinfeld, guest-starred in an episode
of Murder, She Wrote and had a cameo role opposite Michael Douglas in Falling
Down and in Red Surf with George ER Clooney.
She agrees her first taste of the big league was with her sister in Frankie and
Johnny in 1991. The remake of the stage success also starred Al Pacino. Was she
intimidated by the legendary actor? ``I was more nervous with Michelle than any
big stars. It's because she is my sister and I look up to her so much. I
thought it would be the easiest thing ever but I was so nervous I could barely
get the lines out.''
Michelle Pfeiffer can barely spit her words out when she reveals she abdicated
the title role of Evita to Madonna.
Her star has sparkled with so many roles including The Age of Innocence,
Married to the Mob, Love Field and, memorably, as tarnished chanteuse Suzie
Diamond slithering across a piano in The Fabulous Baker Boys.However, it was
her role as Catwoman in Batman Returns that brought her an astonishing
worldwide following.
At the same time she had adopted daughter Claudia Rose, becoming a single
mother (if you don't count her friend Cher as a helpmate).
She married producer David Kelley and in July 1994, a year after adopting, she
gave birth to their son John Henry. She repeats again that she's happy, but
tired, as she sits in a splendid lounge of a hotel in Beverly Hills. Given her
exhaustion, she's quite appropriately in Armani fatigues. We are talking about
school children . . . and babies.
Motherhood? ``It's more than I ever hoped for and it's also far more demanding
than I could have ever anticipated. It demands more of you than you ever
thought you could provide. But you get back what you put into it. ``I have two
perfect children. I am very happily married and these are things I wasn't sure
I was going to have. I have a great career and I feel very lucky. The children
have taught me things. I'm probably less controlling than I used to be. You
have to be. You have to take things less seriously than you used to. Kids teach
you that; they laugh in your face.
``Physically, I'm just a wreck. I'm so tired all the time, but that will pass.
I always think that one day he will be in college and I'll be wishing I was
feeding him at 2am.
``Motherhood has definitely changed my outlook. You always feel you should be
with your children. No matter how much time you spend with them, when you are
away from them you feel you should be with them.''
And that's what killed Evita for her. She spent several months making Up  close
and Personal - she plays a journalist - with Redford and her sister and the
movie will open in the new year. Evita would have involved even more commitment.
``It was really a life choice. There are career choices and there are life
choices. This was a life choice. I am very disappointed that things didn't work
out. Oh, yeah, I'm very disappointed.
``I would have had to have been out of the country for probably three or four
months. Prior to that I would have spent another three or four months
rehearsing, training my voice, prerecording, not seeing my children, and it
just felt like it was too much for me to do on the heel of the movie I've just
finished which was another four-month commitment.
``It was very difficult. I really wanted to do the film. It just felt like the
wrong thing to do right now.''
Instead, later next year she plans a film with Jessica Lange titled A Thousand
Acres. As you might expect, there are a string of others on offer. She smiles:
``I still think I've two or three films left in me.''
One is likely to feature Catwoman, the role which she patented in Batman
Returns. She has established herself as one of Hollywood's major high-profile
players.
Suddenly, with our communications village, millions more see her sister Dedee
every week on Cybill which is proving a ratings winner around the globe.
The big screen versus the small screen. Which is more powerful? Had her fame
changed her family dynamic? She puts on her porcelain untouchable look: ``Off
the top of my head I think no.''
But a much mellower Michelle Pfeiffer says with some pride: ``My sister is an
actress too and she's very successful. I'm not the only one.''
Sisters who don't tear each other's hair out anymore. That is, of course, until
they find themselves in competition for the same major movie. Possibly the fur
will fly again.

IT is only 20 months since the launch of Gamut Technologies. Yet as a leading
provider of client/server software technology in the UK, and sole Scottish
agent for Sybase (UK), this Glasgow-based company is already blazing a trail on
several fronts.
Gamut is the only firm in Scotland, says its business development director,
George Knox, which has taken world-class information technology and marketed it
specifically to local companies. (Sybase was founded in the US in 1984 and has
built a strong reputation for innovation, leadership and reliability in
client/server software services.)
It is also Europe's first recognised Sybase Education provider; it is the only
company to have undertaken thorough research into the Scottish information
technology market and, therefore, to have the understanding and capacity to
provide a range of consultancy and training services which focus exclusively on
the needs of local clients.
All this, and a turnover of #1.2m in the first year (which is expected to rise
to #2.4m in the second), has been achieved without resort to loans, overdrafts
or grants.
Knox and customer services director Nick Archer gained years of computer
experience with a large US-based international software company. As Scots, they
saw that their homeland was being poorly served by suppliers of information
technology.
Invariably it was an English software company, or an international one with an
English base, which sold systems here. The inevitable consequences were less
understanding of particular Scottish problems, poor training and skills
transfer, and a second-rate technical support service.
Knox and Archer decided to change this. They put together a business plan and,
as a result of participating in a Glasgow Enterprise Business Venture
Programme, were joined by Jim Hall, who became legal and financial director.
Gamut Technologies was formed in March 1994, its only capital the directors'
savings.
From the beginning they knew what they were doing. By getting exclusive UK
agency for Sybase - the first company to deliver technology powerful enough for
on-line, mission-critical applications, and now a $1000m concern which
distributes over a wide area network - Gamut had the capacity to deliver real
performance improvements for its customers. The directors were also aware of
the importance of providing good customer support.
Gamut focused on the top 200 Scottish companies; the bigger the organisation,
the greater the need for change to enable them to remain competitive, and the
greater the need for comprehensive training and support to accompany the new
technology. With Sybase, which Knox claims is a uniquely flexible system, it
was able to provide the optimum capability to its customers.
It has employed staff of the highest calibre. Their commitment to the very best
professional training and customer support ensures that, with the installation
of new IT systems, the scope for improvements in management systems and
business processes is maximised.
With a client list that already includes such big names as the Bank of
Scotland, the Royal Bank, Standard Life, General Accident, AT Mays and Harper
Collins, Gamut is ready to be a major player in the Scottish business community.

Antique doll
fetches #1900
A RARE antique doll sold for nearly double its expected price at an auction
organised by Phillips in Edinburgh yesterday.
The small Jumeau doll, valued at between #800 and #1200, went for #1905 at a
sale of dolls, teddy bears, and collector's items. The doll, dressed in its
original muslin French-style dress, was made in Paris in 1880.
Citadel award
A SCHEME to redevelop the derelict Citadel site in Ayr received the Patrick
Geddes planning award yesterday. The project includes a swimming pool, shops,
and housing. The award, from the Saltire Society and the Patrick Geddes Trust,
was presented to architects Pankaj Patel and Andrew Taylor, and the project's
joint promoters, Kyle and Carrick District Council and Enterprise Ayrshire.
House siege
ARMED police surrounded a house in Merlinford Drive, Renfrew, for two hours
yesterday after reports that an occupant was threatening to fire a shotgun.
Police said a man had been taken into custody.
No to clinic
AN APPLICATION to open a body therapy clinic at 42 Caledonian Crescent, in the
Dalry area of Edinburgh, was refused by the district licensing committee
yesterday.
Baseball theft
A YOUTH yesterday admitted stealing 22 baseball bats from a sports store at
Charleston Academy, Inverness. Sentence was deferred until December 28 on Jody
Donald, 18, of Assynt Road, Inverness.
Death bid charge
GLASGOW man Billy Thompson, 29, of Provanmill Road, Glasgow, was remanded in
custody at Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday on a charge of attempted murder. He
is accused of shooting Mr Scott Phin, 27, in the groin outside his home in
Barmulloch, Glasgow, on Thursday night.
Pottery raid
A #15,000 collection of Wemyss Ware pottery has been stolen from a country
house on the Kirkton of Mailor road, near Perth. The owners have offered a
four-figure reward for information leading to its recovery.
Euro warning
TAYSIDE Regional Council's trading standards department yesterday warned
businesses to think twice before signing contracts with companies which offer
to help them get grants from the European Union. It said that, in most cases,
small businesses would be paying for these services, regardless of whether or
not they actually received any grants.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair last night claimed the Conservatives had retreated
from the business of Government into a dirty campaign of lies and propaganda
which showed they were now ``training for Opposition.''
He told a party fund-raising dinner in Glasgow that Ministers no longer ran
departments but managed propaganda at the public's expense. ``It is our task to
rebut their lies, counter their propaganda and put with conviction the new
Labour agenda with a clarity and force that overwhelm the lie machine.''
It was the culmination of a day which had seen Mr Blair enter the lion's den in
Edinburgh to address the city's Chamber of Commerce and Enterprise on his plans
for a Scottish parliament with the power to raise or lower income tax by 3p.
In a counter move there was the release of no fewer than six Scottish
Conservative speeches castigating New Labour and his plans for a ``New Union''
outlined in an exclusive interview yesterday in The Herald.
The Labour hierarchy was suggesting yesterday that in the interview the
suggestion that the party would not use the power to raise income tax in the
first Scottish parliament was ``misconstrued,'' but Mr Blair's own remarks made
it clear that this was the thrust of his preferred approach to seeing off Mr
Forsyth's onslaught on what he has dubbed the ``tartan tax.''
There were immediate expressions of unease from Labour's Liberal Democrat
partners in the Scottish Constitutional Convention, while the SNP claimed that
having come to Scotland to clear the air, Mr Blair had succeeded only in
muddying the water.
Accusing Mr Blair of dictating policy to his own party in Scotland, SNP leader
Alex Salmond said he was proposing ``a pushover, not a parliament, which would
be even more firmly under Westminster's thumb than a local council.''
But the main attack came from the Conservatives. The president of the Board of
Trade, Mr Ian Lang, told constituency workers in Galloway that a Labour
Government would trigger a ``dramatic exodus'' of private investment from
Britain.
Dumfries MP Sir Hector Monro, party vice-chairwoman Annabel Goldie, and
Scottish Office Ministers Raymond Robertson and Lord James Douglas-Hamilton all
queued up to attack Mr Blair.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth led the charge, highlighting yesterday's
Herald interview in which the Labour leader indicated that his party would not
seek to utilise the tax power in the first term. ``Not since Napoleon's retreat
from Moscow have we seen such a shambles,'' said Mr Forsyth.
``Mr Blair realises that the tartan tax would be immensely damaging to Scotland
- that is why he is wriggling. The ruthlessness with which he has left his
colleagues in the constitutional convention swinging in the wind is wonderful
to behold.''
But Mr Blair said last night that Mr Forsyth was at the wheel of the Tory lie
machine
in Scotland, not so much a Scottish Secretary as a party propagandist. ``Nobody
voted for 20 new Tory taxes in 1992 but they got them just the same,'' he said.
``They lied about their own tax plans then. They are lying about our tax plans
now.''
He said ``the Tory lie machine has moved up a gear as an election nears, but we
have seen nothing yet. They will smear, as they always do, and lie and cheat
and spend vast sums on untruthful propaganda.''
He cited recent examples, including one where party chairman Dr Brian
Mawhinney's own press officer conducted briefings on a sensistive immigration
case, the smears about the school opt-out ballot in his own constituency, and
the ``disgraceful whispering campaign'' to undermine the Speaker of the Commons.
He described this process as: ``A few anonymous quotations in the tabloids. The
broadsheets pick it up. A briefing appears that MPs, including Dr Mawhinney's
parliamentary aid, are monitoring the Speaker for signs of bias. This is an
absolute disgreace, but all in keeping with what is happening.''
However, Mr Forsyth kept up the pressure on the taxation issue. ``An alcoholic
asking for the keys of an off licence on the basis of a promise that he would
not take a drink would have more credibility with the Scottish people than Mr
Blair and his pathetic assertion that he would create a power to raise a tartan
tax but that it might not be used and that we must await a manifesto to find
out.''
Benedict Brogan writes: Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine
accused Mr Blair of showing a lack of leadership over the tartan tax. The
Labour leader's devolution plans had ``come unstuck,'' he said.
``My hearts go out to the Scots after Mr Blair's latest fudging on whether or
not his Scottish parliament would raise a tartan tax. Within a few hours he
appeared to change his tune - and then changed it back again - because he
realises that the tartan tax is electoral suicide,'' he said.
``Whenever he is called on to show leadership, as those in Government must do
every day, he falters, caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. His
strategy is simple: if he is asked a difficult question, just smile and utter
soothing words. It's when he's forced to make hard decisions that his options
run out.''

<HEADLINE>Suspended sentence for ship's captain as court says council officials were inebriated Blame shared in Belarus deaths</HEADLINE>

THE captain of a cruise ship involved in the deaths of two Aberdeen City
Council officials has been given a three-year suspended jail sentence for
breaching regulations.
However the court in Gomel, Aberdeen's twin city in the former Soviet Union,
heard that the two Aberdeen officials ``were in a state of inebriation''.
Their own infringement of safety regulations, in addition to the infringement
of the Belarus Department of Transport's regulations by Captain Oleg Gavrilyuk,
is said to have cost the officials their lives.
Deputy chief executive Ann Hughes, 44, and principal environmental health
officer Iain McDonald, 36, were part of a delegation of 41 who flew to Gomel in
June.
They were in a team looking at ways of helping Gomel, which is the area worst
affected by the Chernobyl disaster. They died on June 7 at the end of a rest
day spent cruising on the River Sozh.
Last night a spokeswoman for Aberdeen solicitors Paul and Williamsons said on
behalf of Mr McDonald's widow that they believed the suggestion they were
inebriated to be totally untrue and that they had witnesses to say they were
not in that state.
Yesterday's report, in a Gomel morning newspaper, said that the delegation were
taken by representatives of the city executive committee on the excursion to
the district of Proletarski Luk.
The sun had already started to go down but people decided to cool off in the
river ``and two of them - a man and a woman - jumped into the water''.
The report reiterated what was described by other council officials on their
return: that the remainder of the party stayed on shore as the hosts prepared
dinner on the beach.
It was when the barbecue was ready and the two could not be found that a search
for them started.
``They called out to them over and over again and searched, but to no avail.
The sad news only became clear after several days,'' the newspaper Reklamnoe
Prilozhenie reported.
The article said that a lengthy inquiry had established that after Captain
Gavrilyuk berthed the Burevestnik she started to drift away from the shore. He
attempted to start the engine unsuccessfully and spent 10 or 15 minutes in the
engine room to repair it.
``It must be pointed out that Oleg was on his own on the trip without any crew,
which is an infringement of the regulations laid down by the Ministry of
Transport,'' the article said.
``In this way all responsibility for the safety of passengers while the vessel
is in motion or stationary was laid on the shoulders of the captain.
``Without checking whether the sides of the boat were clear he started the
engine and the propellers started dragging the Scots - who were in an
inebriated state and had swum very close to the boat - into the mechanism of
the boat.
``Their own infringement of swimming safety rules and the infringement of the
traffic regulations by the captain cost the Scottish people their lives.
``Taking into account all these circumstances and taking into consideration the
good work record of Captain Oleg Gavrilyuk, the court gave him a three-year
suspended sentence.''
Last night the spokeswoman for Mrs McDonald's solicitors said that she had
spoken to Mrs McDonald and she was obviously very upset at the suggestions. Her
understanding was that her husband and Ann Hughes were not swimming together
and that her husband had drowned while trying to save his colleague.
She said it was completely wrong to suggest that they had been in a drunken
state and it was ``offensive and insulting to the memory of her husband''.
The spokeswoman declined to reveal whether Mrs McDonald had raised any civil
actions in relation to her husband's death. No-one for Aberdeen District
Council was available for comment.

COWS at the centre of a BSE scare were locked up at a secret location in
Lanarkshire last night.
The six cows were seized by Strathclyde Trading Standards officers as the
animals were being taken to an abattoir for slaughter.
The officers are becoming increasing involved in hunts for BSE-infected
animals. It is alleged the beasts were declared free of BSE at an auction in
Lanark on Monday.
However, Trading Standards officers were alerted when different cows to those
cleared were presented at the abattoir, it is claimed.
Suspicions were raised when ear tags on the beasts were allegedly found to be
different when they arrived for slaughter.
Last night, Mr Stuart Graham, Strathclyde Trading Standards principal officer,
refused to go into details about the Lanarkshire case.
However, he did reveal that any such investigation would take at least four
days because of the amount of back-tracking required to check the history of
where the animals were kept and their owners.
``Our role is to make sure there is no false description,'' he said.
The inquiry comes after it emerged that six Scottish farmers are under
investigation in a separate case. It is alleged they completed forms claiming
cows had been reared in an environment free from any case of BSE for six years.

Gesture transformed into ritual
DESPITE the wee identification tag at the top of this review, last night's
concert by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra was more than music, as it included
dance. But then, inexpert though I may be in the technicalities of the latter
form, I suspect that it was more than dance too.
And before my words start going round in circles, I'd better explain that last
night the SCO launched the first of the Glasgow Commissions, a two-year series
of collaborative projects, promoted by the orchestra and Glasgow District
Council's department of performing arts, that will bring four composers
together with artists of different disciplines. No-one can predict what will
result: two distinct works, a joint effort, something less - or more - than
both of them together . . . anything goes.
Inverness-born Alasdair Nicolson and choreographer/ dancer Laurie Booth
launched the series last night with The Last Meeting, drawn (loosely) from
Greek legend and the final meeting of Orpheus and Eurydice. The orchestra, with
strings divided antiphonally, and wind and percussion ranged across the back of
the stage, defined the space.
And that was the first parameter. Laurie Booth, dancing alone (with two canes
as minimal props) operated within a very limited space. To a highly expressive
score (more of which anon) a concentrated dance unfolded. Perhaps because of
the limitations of area, Booth's entire body seemed focused into precise and
significant movement - literally from neck to knee, from finger to toe.
It wasn't narrative, it wasn't descriptive. It was gesture transformed into
ritual. Stylistically, it was extraordinary in that - to an untrained eye - it
seemed to encompass a range of expressive movement drawn from a huge historical
sweep. It contained the exactness of mime, the elasticity of contemporary
gymnastics, the explosiveness of acrobatics, the slowness and deliberateness of
Japanese Noh theatre, absolute stillness, the exquisite poise and balance of
martial arts, and - almost continuously - the intricate wrist, hand, and finger
ballet of the East.
To complement this captivating, fluid movement, Nicolson has produced one of
his finest scores, stunningly atmospheric, with plaintive horn calls simulating
(if you want narrative style) the lovers, evocative, heaving sighs on the
orchestra, distinctly oriental timbres, and a wild and warlike dance that -
without breaking the ritual mode - suggested an almost sacrificial, pagan-like
quality to the music.
Not conventionally dramatic (and therefore a match for Booth's choreography)
Nicolson's music for The Last Meeting seemed - on first encounter - more
intensely concentrated, more clearly focused, and almost more purposeful than
much of his music that I've heard to date. However much the two artists might
have intended an audience to focus on the narrative factor, each element -
dance and music - was in itself so assured in its execution, that they could be
taken together without further reference. Perhaps it is the case that new
contexts bring more out of folk; if so, then that is what this project is all
about.
Ivor Bolton conducted a brilliant performance by the SCO, the first of several
last night, including a gorgeous account of Bach's most ravishing cantata,
Weichet Nur, with pellucid singing from soprano Nancy Argenta and cool, sensual
oboe playing from Robin Williams, which was followed by a stunning,
quasi-period style performance - lean and clean - of Telemann's highly
imaginative Water Music, with the SCO strings and wind in their most boisterous
and virtuosic form. Fascinating concert; same show tonight at the Queen's Hall.

THE #1 coin is to get a big brother, the #2 coin. The innovation, however, will
not jeopardise the family of 40 million #1 notes, currently issued by the Royal
Bank of Scotland.
The final design has not been decided but the #2 which will be issued in 1997
will be a two-tone Continental-style coin, with a silver centre and a yellow
outer ring. Not to be outdone, the Royal is planning its own innovation in the
same year with a commemorative #1 note to mark the 150th anniversary of the
birth in Edinburgh of Alexander Graham Bell.
The Royal Mint will issue the #2 coin as well as a slimmed down 50p piece
towards the end of 1997, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke said yesterday in a Commons
written reply.
The decision to introduce the coins follows a lengthy consultation exercise on
the future of the country's small change involving the public and 1000
different organisations, including banks, the retailing and vending industries,
the blind, and the elderly.
The #2 coin will be bigger and heavier than the #1 coin but lighter than two #1
coins. The idea of a #2 note was rejected because it would cost too much and
not last long enough.
However, the Royal Bank of Scotland, the only bank on mainland Britain with #1
notes still in circulation, said the announcement would not lead it to change
its policy.
A spokesman said: ``There is still a significant desire for the #1 note in
Scotland. We have about 40 million #1 notes in circulation and are happy to
continue with them. What does worry us is the quality of the notes which get in
a very bad condition when they rub up against change. A #2 note is not
impossible but we have no plans for one.''
The spokesman was unable to draw a comparison between the cost of notes and
coins because while they produced notes, coins were produced by the Royal Mint
and they had no figures for their costs.
The Alexander Graham Bell commemorative #1 note will be issued in March 1997.
The Royal has already produced Britain's only other commemorative banknotes:
for the 1992 Edinburgh Summit and the centenary of Robert Louis Stevenson's
death.
The new 50p piece will be a smaller and lighter version of the existing - and
unpopular - seven-sided coin introduced in 1969. The modifications will bring
the 50p coin into line with the 5p and 10p pieces, both of which have been made
smaller and lighter in recent years.
Until now, #2 coins have been minted only to mark special occasions such as the
1986 Edinburgh Commonwealth Games, the 300th birthday of the Bank of England in
1994, and the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.
The new coin will be the first new denomination to go into general circulation
since 1983. It will bear the Queen's head on the front, while the design for
the reverse will be selected by the Royal Mint Advisory Committee, which is
headed by the Duke of Edinburgh.

William Russell describes the life and times of Edward Burns, the answer to all
those people who wonder whatever happened to the British film industry
A 15-city tour in 16 days giving 12 interviews a day - who said an actor's life
was easy? - is what Edward Burns had to survive when he was sent out to
publicise his first film, The Brothers McMullen. But then he had more of an
interest in its success than most actors since he was also the writer and
director.
Made at weekends over an eight-month period for an outlay of $25,000, he sent
it to the 1993 Sundance Festival as a ``calling card,'' hoping if it was well
received to get money to make a second film. In the event he walked off with
the Grand Jury Prize and at 25 the career of his dreams had turned into reality.
Now 27, the gangling New Yorker, in London to promote the film all over again,
said it was difficult returning to it because since then he had made his second
film, She's The One - on a slightly larger budget of $3m. ``The fact that the
Brothers was taken up for distribution for 20th Century Fox and has done
everything that it has is the icing on the cake,'' he said. ``Two weeks after
Sundance I had the money to make my second film.''
The fairy story does not end there, because having finished She's The One last
month, he is now about to start work on his third feature. His story is the
answer to all those people who wonder whatever happened to the British film
industry. You don't need lottery money. You need luck, dedication, and nerves
of steel.
Born in Queens, raised on Long Island, he discovered screen writing while a
student at Oneonta College, Albany, and realised this was what he wanted to do.
He had, until then, thought he might be the next great American novelist. His
father, a retired New York policeman, had given him a book about screen writing
to read and, having realised this was it, he transferred to a college with a
film department, started to write screenplays, and earned his living by working
in television.
The Brothers is about three Irish Catholic New Yorkers, whose abusive father
has died. At his funeral their mother announces she is off to live in Ireland
with the man she really loved, a decision which forces the trio to face up to
the problems in their own lives. The oldest son is happily married, but tempted
into an affair, the middle one, played by Burns, is a womaniser who cannot
commit himself to a relationship, and the youngest, devoutly Catholic, is
deeply inhibited.
Burns said he had made it because he was not seeing films which bore any
relation to the people he knew. The only one he had seen about Irish Americans,
State of Grace, was about West Side gangs and had nothing to do with his
lifestyle. He and his friends spent their time trying to hold down a job to pay
the rent, attempting to make relationships work and coping with being Catholics.
``I chose comedy because I did not want to get up on a soap box and preach,''
he said. ``If you can make your point, and make people laugh, it is a far more
effective way of getting your message across than beating them over the head,''
he said.
``We got the film in the can for $25,000 because the entire cast worked for
deferred pay and we also deferred $100,000 of costs to the film lab. At the end
of the day it probably cost $420,000, but the nice thing is, that after we sold
it to Fox, all those people got paid. And the actors have gone on to other
acting jobs. They have quit waiting on tables and working in dry cleaners. The
film has been good for everyone.''
Faced with constant rejection by Hollywood, he was told by his father that he
would just have to make it on his own, and he would find the money. He came up
with $15,000 and then another $10,000 and Burns started work. Since his father
was a retired cop it was not just a question of his writing a cheque out, and
the money had come in instalments.
``It is a catch-22 situation with scripts you send to Hollywood,'' he added.
``You cannot get anyone to read them unless you have an agent, and you must
have sold one to get an agent. They did not want to take a gamble one me.''
His second film, also set in New York's Irish community, is about a father who
insists his sons go fishing with him each weekend, and on giving them unwanted
and useless advice about how to run their lives while ignoring the fact his own
is a mess. He hopes it, too, will be funny - and say something about being
Catholic.
As for the future, he is what he wanted to be - a film maker. But not in
Hollywood. He intends to remain in New York. ``I have plenty to write about,''
he said.

TWO hundred shoe factory workers have lost their jobs.
The employees of the Kilmarnock Shoe Company in Ayrshire still do not know if
they will receive their back pay in time for Christmas.
The receivers were called into the plant yesterday after the firm collapsed
with debts of #1.5m.
Mr Richard Rendle, of receivers Baker Tilly, said: ``We will be trying to sell
the business as a going concern in the near future.''
The Kilmarnock MP, Mr Willie McKelvey, said that if a buyer could be found
within the next 10 to 12 days some of the jobs could be saved.
Mr John Blaney, the Strathclyde regional councillor for Kilmarnock, said:
``This is another disaster for the town. They were a large and long-standing
employer.''

Missing man
CONCERN is growing for an 85-year-old man who went missing from his home in
Menzieshill Road, Dundee, on Thursday. Police appealed for anyone who may have
seen Mr Hugh McNabb to contact them. Mr McNabb is 5ft 4in and was wearing a
brown anorak, brown trousers, and brown shoes.
Sports hall boost
A #2.1m project to create a major new sports centre at Oban's swimming pool has
moved closer with confirmation of a #150,000-plus package from the area's local
enterprise company, Argyll and the Islands Enterprise.
Power repairs
HYDROELECTRIC will spend #6.5m next year repairing and replacing overhead
lines. Another #8.2m will be spent on upgrading supply in a number of
communities in the Grampian area.
Pottery raid
A #15,000 collection of Wemyss Ware pottery has been stolen from a country
house on the Kirkton of Mailor road, near Perth. The owners have offered a
four-figure reward for information leading to its recovery.
Hopes rise for
Creagan bridge
HOPES have been raised again that a bridge will be built over Loch Creran,
cutting miles off the journey between Oban and Fort William.
Lorn Councillor Campbell Cameron, who has had a letter from Scottish Roads
Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, said: ``Lord James has now confirmed in
writing that the Creagan bridge scheme will be reassessed after this year's
public expenditure survey and prior to next year's annual statement on trunk
roads construction.''
Open lectures
DUNDEE University opens its doors to the public for a series of five Christmas
lectures next Tuesday. The subjects are architecture, medicine, conservation,
the nation state, and careers.

ERIC Cullen was in his last year of college when he took part in a pilot
(``Season's Greet'') for what was to become the massively successful Rab C
Nesbitt series, in which he played wee Burnie ``the child from hell''. Instant
fame, street recognition; a life was turned around in the signing of a
contract. Cullen talked of the soaring self-esteem and satisfaction which came
with the transformation from the unknown ``wee man'' of four feet four, to
famous character actor. It was interesting that he described the career break
as a ``child's dream come true'' and though I think he was partly talking of
the character's anarchism, his description betrayed a kind of ambivalence as to
his own adult status.
Since he was 13 years old (and looking about eight) Cullen was systematically
sexually abused by a relative, who also set him up for abuse by other men -
until his late twenties. Two years ago, this uncle from a non-fictional hell,
left pornographic material at Cullen's flat. Cullen willingly showed the police
the material, the information was leaked to the press, and the nightmare began;
sections of the press bayed ``monster'', the contract dissolved and Cullen was
in Barlinnie.
Supportive friends saw him through the appeal process which eventually led to
the sentence being quashed, but there was the breakdown, the hospitalisation,
and the attempted suicide to surmount.
Despite the intense and harrowing trauma made into seedy tabloid fodder, Cullen
states that ultimately the experience has led to his release from the misery
perpetrated by blackmailing tormentors, against two of whom he is now seeking
prosecutions. But while the story itself was important, and worth attending to,
I did have a sense of a lost opportunity here.
Cullen's language was generalised, his parallels unrevealing. The press, he
said, acted ``as if he had started the First World War'' - there was,
ultimately, little that was really telling, or specific in his account.
Television work was enjoyable because, like beauty contestants, he ``enjoyed
meeting people''. It could be argued that after your life has been ripped to
pieces by sex-and-perversion headlines, the retreat into the commonplace
expression is an understandable response. But John Fergusson, who was doing the
interviewing on Radio Scotland's Sudden Change, could perhaps have facilitated
a more personalised candour. I don't know who to blame for the snatches of
guitar chords punctuating the programme but they were naff beyond belief.
When Charles Kennedy interviews he is confident and bright enough to ask the
light-hearted question; he happily articulates his presuppositions about his
interviewee, which elicits an energetic response activated into replacing the
questioner's guess with the subject's self-revelation. It's a strategy which
works well. In Kennedy in Conversation (also from Radio Scotland) this week he
was talking to Sir Clive Sinclair, entrepreneurial inventor and chairman of
Mensa.
With the true extent of car pollution being hushed up and the number of asthma
cases rising dramatically, Sinclair sensibly argued for a Park and Ride policy
which would improve our cities, without putting car-dependent rural communities
at risk.
Having invented the pocket calculator which was bad news for slide-rule
sellers, Sinclair carries a slide-rule with him all the time (``it doesn't need
a battery'') and far from being a gadget-freak, his phone is immobile, and at
his weekly poker game he delights in the fact that his friends with personal
organisers take five times as long as those with diaries to organise the next
session. He is the amused recipient of letters from ``nut-cases'' who have this
idea for a car with a propellor on its roof which would need no other fuelling
- being rather non-techno I can't recall why it wouldn't work - but his
argument convinced me.
Kennedy suggested that they might get some takers at certain Lib-Dem fringe
meetings . . .

SCIENTISTS, meat producers, and politicians have all had their say in the BSE
debate. Now, in the past week, consumers have begun to make their views known.
Two days ago, it was announced that UK beef sales for November had dropped 5%
on the same month last year.
Yesterday, Scotland's largest meat producers and auction company predicted beef
prices would drop again next week in what was described as ``almost a crisis
situation''.
Two factors sparked the controversy. Last month, a World in Action documentary
claimed 600 BSE infected cows were being eaten each week in the UK. Shortly
afterwards, neuropathologist Sir Bernard Tomlinson added to fears about ``mad
cow disease'' by claiming humans could be at risk.
Glasgow shoppers yesterday said the media coverage in general had shaped their
views on BSE and its alleged human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
In Partick, catering assistant Donna Bruce, 29, was worried enough to plan a
meeting with her young son's teachers.
``I'd rather it wasn't served in schools just in case there's a risk,'' she
said. ``But I don't buy much processed red meat anyway so it doesn't affect
what I buy at the shops.''
Mother-of-two Tina Thorburn, 28, said: ``My husband hasn't eaten beef for
weeks. He used to eat it all the time but now wants us to stop eating it as
well. He thinks the Government is covering up the whole thing. We should be
told what is happening,'' she said.
Student Garry Brown, 20, of Kelvingrove, said his trolley was packed with
sausages, hamburgers, and pies. ``I follow the news but it won't affect what
food I buy. So few people have actually been affected that it all seems to be a
bit of worry over nothing.''
Mr Neil Rafferty, of Hyndland, echoed that opinion. ``I won't stop eating red
meat products unless they start putting human beings in them.''
Ms Elizabeth Kilpatrick, of Thornwood, said: ``I'm not particularly worried.
There are so many different opinions about it. One expert says one thing and
another says the opposite. I'll just carry on doing my normal shopping.''
South Side supermaket shoppers were generally more suspicious. Pensioner Sarah
Clyne, of Eastwood, said: ``I think it is having an affect because the prices
are going down. Personally, I don't think I can risk eating it because there's
been so much about it in the newspapers and television.''
Her friend, Mary Rae, said: ``I like red meat so I never give it a thought.''
Mother-of-three Marina McCarter, 30, of Newlands, said: ``I didn't buy any
sausages today and that was because I saw a TV documentary which made me think
about it.''
Husband and wife John and Annabel Wright said it would be more of a concern if
they had younger children.
Mr Alistair Donaldson, Scottish general manager of the Meat and Livestock
Commission, said he was not surprised at the mixed public reaction and sales
downturn.
``That was a reflection of the concerns the public obviously have, which
emphasises the need for proper reassurances that beef is safe.''
Mr Eddie Gillanders, marketing executive for Inverurie-based ANM Group,
Scotland's largest red meat supplier and auction company, said the price of an
#830 carcass was expected to fall by up to #50 (16p a kilo) next week, three
times the price drop for the previous week and five times a ``normal'' fall.
He said: ``It is very unusual to have such a large drop which almost amounts to
a crisis situation. It is worrying but the reaction you have obtained is mildly
encouraging because people still seem to have the confidence to continue buying
meat.''
Mr John Scott, president of the Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers, said
the issue of BSE would be on the agenda at a monthly meeting of the
organisation in Perth today. However, he added: ``The problem isn't convincing
each other, it's getting the message across to the public.''

A SECRETARY was like a ``rag doll'' minutes after meeting the man accused of
drugging and murdering her.
A waitress told yesterday how Mr Richard Karling, 43, bought two cups of coffee
and a fresh orange shortly before Miss Dorothy Niven, 33, arrived at the
Pancake Place in Union Street, Glasgow.
The waitress, Miss Patricia Lambert, 31, told the High Court in Glasgow, that
Miss Niven looked fit and well when she joined Mr Karling at his table.
Minutes later, she became unwell and sat with her elbows on the table holding
her head in her hands.
Miss Lambert told Mr William Totten, prosecuting: ``She was like a rag doll.
You could have done anything with her.''
Mr Karling, of Bellview Crescent, Ayr, denies that on June 27 last he
administered Temazepam to Miss Niven in the Pancake Place.
He further denies taking her in a taxi to her home at Silvan Place, Busby,
Renfrewshire, forcing her face into a pillow, and murdering her.
Mr Karling has lodged special defences of incrimination alleging a former
fiance, Mr William Lynch, murdered Miss Niven, and also of alibi.
Questioned by Mr Totten, Miss Lambert said there was no sign that Miss Niven
was sweating or that her eyes were bloodshot when she arrived.
Earlier, the court heard how para-medics were called to her home the following
afternoon.
Mr Karling, who had let them into the house, asked them: ``Is she away? Is she
dead?''
The trial, before Lord Johnston, continues.

EASY Buck can continue his progress and claim some notable scalps by taking the
Tripleprint Gold Cup at Cheltenham this afternoon.
The winner of six of his 12 races over the larger obstacles, he once beat
Baydon Star out of sight as a novice and seems to improve with each run.
He was going well when an unlucky faller here at the Festival in March.
After having joined the Nigel Twiston-Davies' stable during the summer, Easy
Buck showed his well-being with a comfortable win at Newbury.
Still at the right end of the handicap and with the admirable Chris Maude on
board, he has every chance of landing this big prize.
Couldnt Be Better was an impressive winner of the Hennessy but may find himself
tapped for speed and Big Matt and Gnome's Tycoon can fill the places.
Mysilv looks set to enjoy her fifth win over today's course and distance in the
Bula Hurdle.
It was asking a lot for her to make all in last season's Champion Hurdle and
she was clearly tired at the last but had the guts to hold on to fifth place,
clear of Atours and Mole Board.
Atours is expected to be more of a force here but may simply lack the class of
Charlie Egerton's mare.
Putty Road was about the best novice hurdler around last year, and it was hard
to believe that he could be beaten at odds-on in a four-horse race on his
reappearance.
That result, however, seemed a lot less surprising after the winner, Chief's
Song, had gone on to land last week's William Hill Hurdle against strong
opposition.
Putty Road can reassert his top-class status at the expense of Killone Abott in
the Lonesome Glory Hurdle.
It is not much of a tip to note that One Man only has to stand up to win the
feature race at Haydock. Better odds are on offer at Doncaster, where Cogent
has an excellent chance of returning to the winner's enclosure.
This doughty stayer should be suited by conditions underfoot and has the
measure of Scotton Banks.
q THE chances of racing at Lingfield this afternoon disappeared under a frozen,
white blanket yesterday.
A course spokesman said: ``There is still snow on the course and although there
was a slight thaw in the morning, the temperature has again dropped. ``Any snow
that is left will therefore still be there tomorrow.''

PLACE works by Bach and Shostakovich together in the same concert, and the
chances are they will interlock. Do it twice over, and the programme structure
should be all the firmer. In such company, Vaughan Williams last night could
have seemed an uninvited guest.
But there was a connection in the person of the award-winning young oboist,
Daniel Bates, who brought to the English composer's airy Concerto for Oboe and
Strings the same sort of serenity he bestowed on Bach's Double Concerto in D
minor with Clio Gould as his violinist partner. As a result, the provincial
intruder proved not so out of place after all, and his dancing rhythms,
alongside Bach's, brought their own rustic integrity to the evening.
Rusticity, however, was not what Shostakovich's Two Pieces for String Octet, Op
11, were about, any more than was his Eighth String Quartet in its richer-toned
arrangement for string orchestra. Here, with a brilliance of attack that did
nothing to conceal the music's underlying bleakness, the BT Scottish Ensemble
made as strong a case for the inflated version of the quartet as one is likely
to encounter.
Indeed, hearing it in the same concert as the pieces for octet made it sound
all the more convincing. As for the tensions of the latter spiky little
fragments, in which ideas were tossed nervily from one pair of players to
another, they seemed filled with portents of Shostakovich's darker, later
style. A robust, firm-limbed account of Bach's A minor Violin Concerto, with
Clio Gould as soloist, opened the programme.

``This Weimar is a loose town,'' explained Marianne Faithfull as her selection
of Kurt Weill songs veered off into unlikely sounding tales of Harry Nilsson's
funeral and a final scraping of the Irish tradition. The songs she chose, she
said, all had a knife-edge quality.
Life in the raw has long been her stock in trade. Although she's been in the
gutter herself, with her persona of rock's grand-but-frayed duchess she can't
really get away with singing the blues. But she's got a right - and the
personal experience - to sing Don't Smoke in Bed and the required leer to seek
Alabama Song's whiskey bars and little boys.
What her voice lacks in trueness, it more than makes up for in its abrasive
believability. It certainly carried the gig. When her actions threatened to get
over hammy (and this was inevitable in a woman for whom lighting a cigarette
can take on the proportions of a three-act drama) her cracking huskiness
conveyed credible hurt.
With just Paul Trueblood's unfussy piano accompaniment as a backdrop she worked
the stage, adding a little la la-ing dance to a gaunt Boulevard of Broken
Dreams, sitting down for a confidential verse, kneeling for extra pleading
emphasis on Au Fond de la Seine (in convincing French) - and, with a look two
parts relief to one of defiance, getting up again.
Between songs she grew from initial reticence into a kind of still-youthful but
slightly loopy school teacher about to spill beans (if there are any left to
spill) at any moment. She needn't have been shy - grown men were loudly
confessing their love for her. And if her unaccompanied She Moved Thro' The
Fair creaked a bit, this well-used song has seldom sounded more eerie.

A HEADTEACHER died in hospital last night after being stabbed outside his
school.
Mr Philip Lawrence was attacked when he went to help a 13-year-old pupil who
was being assaulted by a gang outside St George's Roman Catholic School, in
Lanark Road, Maida Vale, London.
Paramedics performed emergency surgery on Mr Lawrence after he had staggered
into the school.
A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: ``It appears that as one of the schoolboys
left the school premises he was approached by a small group of male youths. The
teacher, who was in the vicinity, intervened.
``The man sustained a stab wound but managed to stagger back into the school
and raise the alarm. The suspects are believed to have made off on foot into
roads nearby.''
The boy was also taken to hospital with head injuries.
Surgeons had battled throughout the evening to save the life of Mr Lawrence,
48, a father of four, at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington.
One pupil said: ``There was a gang outside the school and they were fighting
with a boy.
``Then the headteacher suddenly ran out and tried to come between them. One of
the gang lashed out with something looking like a baseball bat and then they
grabbed the teacher and stabbed him somewhere around the stomach.
``The teacher looked very pale and the last I saw of him was when he staggered
towards the door of the school.
``I saw the youths run down the hill. I think one was black with sunglasses and
another was Chinese wearing a white top.''
Police were unable to confirm whether the murder weapon used to stab Mr
Lawrence was a machete.
The main school hall was used as an interview room by two dozen or so police
officers investigating the attack.
Mr Albert St Ange, 32, who runs North Paddington Boys Club, opposite the
school's main entrance, said trouble had been brewing between local gangs of
youths in recent weeks.
Some teenagers who use his club had told him of the tension in the area.
He said: ``From what I can gather, there has been conflict between a couple of
groups of kids.''
He said Mr Lawrence had been a asset to the school and ``a real stickler for
discipline.''
A spokesman for Westminster City Council paid tribute to Mr Lawrence, who had
been a head teacher at the school for three years.
He said: ``The city council wish to express its regret that Mr Lawrence should
lose his life in this way and offers its sincere condolences to his family.''
A spokesman for the board of governors said: ``We are shocked and appalled at
the sudden and tragic loss of such an outstanding friend and colleague.
``At the moment our thoughts are with his family and we will be offering them
all the support we possibly can.''
One local resident said he was not surprised there had been trouble. ``When I
come out in the morning to go to work there are kids hanging around smoking
cigarettes and sometimes drugs. There is always a lot of fighting between
different groups.''

THE problem of adapting any poem for the stage is finding a visual equivalent
for an essentially verbal experience. Here, where the subject of Sam Shepherd
and Joseph Chaikin's radio play is an angel lost between earth and heaven, that
problem is doubled because it's already the theme of the poem. Heaven or earth,
abstract or material: the angel can't quite become either. Nor can 7:84's
production.
A luminous, neatly designed set and gently meandering music create the
appropriate impression of limbo. The angel, divided between three performers,
is rendered in three tones of incantation: sorrow of loss, joy of discovery,
and anger in bewilderment. Michael Cannon, Sheila Docherty and Pauline Sweeney
put great intensity into this, but they can't make the poem something it isn't.
It remains words and not drama.
An exception to this may be Michael Cannon. His real-life blindness exactly
partakes of the angel's dilemma. His movements - you are aware - are made
simultaneously on a lit stage and in his own non-visual world. He becomes the
nearest this production gets to a dramatic representation of the poem's ideas.
I didn't understand why he wasn't given the line which reads, ``There was a
time when the light from my eyes was so powerful it would blind the sun. Now
look. No light, nothing.''
The poem was written after Joseph Chaikin suffered a stroke which left him
virtually unable to speak. It draws on the half-world element in such an
experience. 7:84 render this well enough as a recital but don't give persuasive
evidence that the abstract needs to be materialised.

YEVGENY Kafelnikov moved closer to his biggest cheque yet in the sport when he
reached the semi-finl stage of the Grand Slam Cup in Munich after a success
against Jacco Eltingh of Holland.
After having dropped the first set, the Russian battled back to win 3-6, 6-3,
6-2 in the $6m tournament, the most lucrative event in the game.
In today's semi, Kafelnikov will meet Goran Ivanisevic, who reached the last
four without having to pick up his racket after Pete Sampras withdraw from
their quarter-final because of a knee injury.
Three-times Wimbledon champion Boris Becker faces American Todd Martin in the
other semi-final.
There are no rankings points at stake in the German tournament, but the huge
prize money still tempts many of the top players to brave the freezing Bavarian
weather and extend the tournament season into December.
The winner will take home $1.625m.
Eltingh used his strong serve-and-volley game to the full to take the first
set, but he needed to show composure in the decisive stages. Kafelnikov played
some superb returns and passing shots to save several set points before Eltingh
took the set after 33 minutes.
The Russian lifted his form to win the second set and then took the initiative
in the decisive third set with a first break of serve in the fifth game before
serving out for the match.
Becker, who won the inaugural event in 1990, is pleased with his form. ``I
guess it's because of my serve. I don't remember serving like I've been doing
the last three-four weeks.''

<TEXT>
A FARMER who buried his illegally built home under a mound of earth in a bid to
fool planners was jailed yesterday for three months.
He was also told to demolish the house.
Trevor Sedgbeer insisted that, by removing the roof and top storey, he had
complied with an order to reduce it to the original ground level.
However, Mr Justice Sachs said the 47-year-old farmer had been shown
considerable indulgence by the courts and South Hams District Council, Devon.
``The time has now come, whilst it gives me no pleasure, for me to commit him
to prison for three months,'' said the judge. The sentence was for contempt of
court.
Mr Sedgbeer remained defiant as he was led away by the High Court tipstaff to
face Christmas in prison. He will appeal.
``I don't regret what I did,'' he said. ``It just shows what I have said all
along - the courts are always on the side of the council. They seem to get away
with whatever they like.''
He had spent more than #2000 fighting to overturn the council's refusal of
planning permission.
He said: ``They will probably demolish it while I'm in prison but I'll just put
another one up.''
The farmer's continued refusal to pull down the house near Totnes led to a
series of hearings at which he was given more time to demolish, culminating on
April 21 this year in a three-month jail order.
On May 9, council enforcement officer Michael Huxtable visited the site and
found a mound of earth. He took photographs and was convinced the house had
been demolished.
However, in October, when he revisited the site, he discovered the mound of
earth was covering the whole of the ground floor of the house.
Mr Sedgbeer had simply knocked off the top storey, left it as a bungalow, put
soil on top and grassed it over.
Mr Sedgbeer said he and his wife had owned the land for 22 years and lived on
it for many years, with permission, in a mobile home. The house was originally
a cow barn, he said, and he pointed out that three other ``whacking great
barns'' in the locality had been given consent for conversion.
``Our home has the support of the village and neighbouring farmers and property
owners,'' he said.
He told the judge the mound of earth coincided with the original ground level
before construction and as far as he was concerned he had complied with the
enforcement notice.

IN a season when the physical drain on football managers has been manifested in
alarming style, with the dugout collapses of both Paul Sturrock, of St
Johnstone, and Allan McGraw of Morton, it seemed an appropriate moment to
discuss the demands of the job with a man who did take it on for three years at
one of the country's biggest clubs. Willie Miller tackled the impossible dream
immediately following a career as a player which spanned 18 years, much of it
at the highest level.
He went straight from the Aberdeen dressing room where he had been the
unquestioned team leader to the manager's office. No trophies were collected in
his stint as manager but he would point to four cup semi-finals reached, two
cup finals, and two runners-up spots in the premier division as evidence that
he didn't do too badly.
Looking back, he concedes that he was unlikely to survive his last season when
the team was fighting relegation. ``If there were people trying to get me moved
on when we were getting to second place twice in three years I don't suppose I
had much chance when we were struggling near the bottom.''
Miller, who was shrewd enough to make business investments and pension
arrangements as a player which removed at least one burden of the job -
worrying about his own finances - has thought long and hard about most aspects
of the management game, and has some interesting thoughts on the pressures
under which they are put.
``Nowhere else in the world are managers expected to do what they do in this
country. You are responsible for everything, from bringing through young
players, organising a scouting system throughout the country, negotiating
contracts, negotiating transfers, finding new men somewhere to stay, and making
sure their families are happy.
``The work load on managers in Britain is immense, all-encompassing. It is
virtually a general manager and coach rolled into one.''
His introduction to the gaffer's role came suddenly when Alex Smith was sacked
in much the same way that he himself was to be sent on his way three years
hence. The major difference was that Miller had been a huge success as a
Pittodrie player, a little legend of his own in the town, and upon whom immense
expectations were laid.
He acknowledges with hindsight that those expectations were far beyond realism.
``I had some good times, even as a manager, at Aberdeen. Some people forget
what was achieved in those three years. Unfortunately, we did have a huge
problem with the finances at that time which has since been eased slightly by
the share issue and sale of Stephen Wright.
``I would love to have landed one trophy to give me breathing space to put the
long term plans to work.''
He was delighted to see his former team win the Coca-Cola Cup and still has
very soft spot for his old club. ``I think when you have been a big-name player
with the club the expectations are all the higher when you become the manager.
Maybe it is just the old Scottish tradition that if you have been up there they
like to see you fall on your bum.''
Miller is not entirely convinced by the argument that says the route straight
from dressing room to manager's office is a bad one. ``Obviously, any
experience is good and people who have other jobs and learn from others get
good experience, but I honestly don't think I would have tackled the Aberdeen
job any differently. You learn as you go along anyway.''
Miller never had the image of being one of the game's stand-up comics which
makes his next observation perhaps all the more intriguing. ``One thing I did
learn and one thing I do believe is necessary to take the strain off managers
is a sense of humour. I know people didn't think I had one but my friends and
people I work with know differently.
``I learned early on that keeping a sense of humour about the place is
absolutely essential. When I look back at the expectations of the club and my
own expectations which were just as high it was totally unrealistic.
Remembering the financial difficulties, the restrictions on me in terms of
being unable to bring the kind of players I wanted to the club, and the money
that Rangers and Celtic were spending it was not a bad feat to finish second in
the league. But I don't think the fans or anyone else gave that much credit.
``I needed that sense of humour, especially in the second year when the rumour
mongers had me out of the job and someone coming into it. When people demand
those kind of results it certainly adds to the pressure.''
Miller insists that in those circumstances it is a prerequisite to have a
laugh. His conviction is that all managers, even if they are not blessed with a
laid-back nature, have to develop a lighter outlook in order to withstand the
vicissitudes that inevitably will attack them.
``I am not saying you have to treat the game frivolously or anything like that
but you can't just let the worries overcome you. You have to enjoy it even when
you are going through a bad spell.''
The former Scotland World Cup man points out that for at least two hours every
day during the week the football manager is a very happy man. ``That is when he
is doing the coaching out on the park with the lads. He is at his happiest and
most content then. He has to learn to contend with the other 22 hours.
``You have to learn to enjoy those as well and that is when the sense of humour
is required.''
The real test of his ability to handle the pressures would have come at sleep
time when many a manager finds that his mind refuses to go into the overnight
garage. As a player, Miller had the reputation that he could nod off standing
in the middle of Union Street at rush hour. That didn't change when he took on
the major problems of the manager's seat.
``There are so many things go through your mind all your waking hours that it
must be murder to have it during the night as well. I know you wonder about
whether you should play him or not, should you change the system, should I play
Eoin Jess or not even when he is having a bad spell?''
Is it a lonely job? ``Yes, there is no doubt about that. You make the
decisions. You talk to your staff, who in my case were fully integrated into
the decision-making process, but at the end of the day you are a lonely figure
because it is you who will take the stick and you who is let down when they
take your job away. Unfortunately, while a manager has to make long-term plans
they don't matter the way they do in business outside football.
``You have to live from day to day, game to game.''
His own financial acumen meant that the loss of his job did not bring
deprivation but, being a Bridgeton boy, he saw enough of unemployment as a lad
to appreciate the weight of the extended burden of relying on football for your
living.
``That must make things an awful lot worse and I am glad that I did make
provision for the day I stopped playing.''
Not surprisingly, because that is the way managers are, Miller has not vowed to
steer clear of the hot seat forever more. ``If the right offer came along I
would relish and go at it with a will. We love the game and it is great to be
involved.''
Since he left Pittodrie he has been enjoying his exposure as a media pundit
which some see as the epitome of poacher turned gamekeeper. ``I know that I can
be much more forthright in saying things now but when you are a manager you
have to protect your club and players when you talk publicly.
``Now I can give an honest opinion and if it hurts someone, too bad.''
That is a sentence of which he can be sure he will be reminded, if or when the
day dawns he returns to the team-leader role.

ICE HOCKEY
LES Millie has a quick chance of revenge over his former team-mates tonight
when he plays for Fife Flyers against newly-crowned Benson and Hedges Cup
winners Sheffield Steelers at Kirkcaldy.
The Yorkshiremen, currently third in the premier division, hammered
third-bottom Flyers on their own rink 13-3 two weeks ago with Millie failing to
make the scoresheet.
Mark Morrison, the Kirkcaldy club's player-coach, said: ``Les has fitted in
well since joining us from Sheffield and is determined to do well against his
old club. That heavy defeat hurt us and we need points to lift ourselves up the
table. A result against the strongest club in the league would give everyone a
lift.''
Meanwhile, promotion-pushing Dumfries Vikings could have new signing Luc Chabot
in their line-up at home to Telford tonight, and Paisley Pirates are anxious to
halt a run of five straight defeats at Chelmsford tonight.

<HEADLINE>Doctors describe Scottish flu outbreak as `average'</HEADLINE>

THE incidence of flu in Scotland is more than double the rate in England and
Wales but was dismissed by Scottish experts yesterday as only an average
outbreak of the disease.
Counterparts south of the Border have described the situation there as a
fully-fledged epidemic.
One Scottish analyst said the incidence of flu in Scotland was no more than was
expected at this time of year and claimed the use of the term epidemic was
unhelpful and alarmist.
Figures released yesterday show there were 375 cases of flu per 100,000 people
in Scotland in the week ending December 2 compared with 178 per 100,000 in
England and Wales in the week ending December 3.
The Scottish figures increased by about 30% on the previous week's rate of 295
cases per 100,000, while those in England and Wales increased by 40% from 138
per 100,000.
One of the doctors monitoring levels of the infection in England and Wales, Dr
Douglas Fleming, director of the Royal College of General Practitioners'
Birmingham research unit, said yesterday: ``There are sufficient cases across
the country (England and Wales) that we would regard this as just reaching a
moderate epidemic level.''
However, experts at Scotland's national surveillance unit for infection
described this year's outbreak north of the border as ``fairly average''.
Commenting on the Scottish figures, Dr Peter Christie, consultant
epidemiologist at the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health at
Ruchill Hospital in Glasgow, said: ``There is nothing to distinguish this year
from previous years. Last year (1994-95) was quiet, the year before (1993-94)
was busier. This year (1995-96) looks like being somewhere in between the two.''
Asked if experts regarded the outbreak in Scotland as an epidemic, he said:
``It's not a helpful term. Basically we see a lot of flu at this time every
year and, in terms of the past few years, at the moment this looks like being a
fairly average year. To say it is an epidemic doesn't help in interpretation or
action taken. The term epidemic has alarming overtones.''
Dr Christie said the latest Scottish figures followed another 30% increase in
the previous week and a 110% rise the week before that, indicating that the
rate of increase was levelling off.
He added: ``My interpretation of the results north and south of the border is
that the incidence of flu looks similar but we (Scotland) have got going
earlier.''
Meanwhile, Dr Fleming said the increase in England and Wales had been seen in
all parts of the country (England and Wales) and in all age groups.
He added: ``A rate of 178 per 100,000 population is higher than is seen in many
winters, though it is still less than the peak rate of 1993 which was 235 per
100,000.'' He said there were no indications that the current epidemic would
exceed the 1993 level.
Flu accounts for 3000 to 4000 deaths in a typical year but the figure can be
much higher in epidemics. During the epidemic of 1989, there were 29,000
flu-related deaths.
Government scientists had forecast accurately the strain of flu now at large -
``A Johannesburg'' - and there were sufficient stocks of the correct vaccine.
There were an estimated six million people in the high-risk category who ought
to be immunised.
These included the elderly, people suffering from asthma and bronchitis, and
those with weak immune systems. People with heart trouble, kidney failure or
diabetes and patients receiving cancer treatment or being given steroids were
also vulnerable. Others were advised to stay at home and allow the illness to
run its course.
A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ``We would urge anyone in a vulnerable
group to have jabs but flu is not life threatening for ordinary, healthy
people.''

<TEXT>
THE Bosnia peace agreement was under threat last night after France issued an
ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs - return our two pilots or face the consequences.
France's hard-line statement threw the peace implementation conference in
London into some confusion.
Foreign Minister Herve de Charette warned that the situation was critical and
France would take action if the pilots, who were shot down in August, were not
returned.
``This is a critical situation,'' he told the conference. ``It puts in danger
the peace process for which we have worked for solong. France considers that
the fate of the two French pilots of the Atlantic Alliance concerns us all. We
are determined to mobilise all our efforts. We are determined to carry through
all the consequences of a refusal to reply.''
Mr de Charette's warning followed a letter from French President Jacques Chirac
to Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic, in which he set out France's demands
in unequivocal terms.
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, chairing the conference at Lancaster House,
said there was great sympathy for the French concerns. ``We strongly endorse
the desire of the French Government to have this information provided
immediately,'' he said.
There was speculation that the crisis could force the French to delay the
signing of the peace agreement, which is scheduled to take place in Paris next
Thursday.
France could also decide to delay the deployment of the peace implementation
force until the pilots are returned.
It is still not known whether the men, who were shot down over Bosnian Serb
territory, are alive or dead, despite persistent questioning of the relevant
authorities.
Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey pledged his Government's commitment
to do all it could to secure the release of the French pilots.
He said it would be sad if the parties travelled to Paris next week, to just a
few miles from the homes of the pilots and their families, for the official
signing of the peace agreement, without knowing their fate.
``We would hope to go to Paris with them,'' he said. ``That would be a crowning
moment in what we anticipate would be a successful signing conference.''
The pilots crisis cast a dark shadow over the conference, which was called to
mobilise the international community behind the urgent need to finalise
practical arrangements for the peace settlement and the massive reconstruction
programme.
EU negotiator and former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt was selected as the
``high representative'' to co-ordinate the civil and humanitarian operations
and liaise closely with the Nato military commanders.
Mr Bildt will chair the steering board of a peace implementation council, which
the conference announced would be set up with responsibility for all civilian
work in Bosnia.
A total of 42 countries, who are attending the two-day conference in London,
will be represented on the new council.
Opening the conference in Lancaster House, Prime Minister John Major warned
that peace must not be allowed to fail.
``Today we must take one decision above all: that peace in Bosnia cannot fail.
That we cannot allow the nightmare of the past three years to return,'' he said.

IF you are going to stage a comic opera, it's best to ensure you can make it
funny. Opera on a Shoestring have revived Donizetti's Don Pasquale and have
then successfully buried it.
Chief undertaker must be producer James Ross who loaded his production with an
excess of clever-clever props and heavy-handed stage directions. That Act One
playing with a swivel chair, the tug-of-war with bath towels, and the Act Two
pantomime with a ball of wool were all embarrassing equivalents for the true
comedy implied in the text.
It takes more than a PC workstation and a couple of mobile phones to make a
nineteenth-century opera relevant to today's audience.
Assistant undertaker was Graeme Danby in the role of Don Pasquale. He was so
over-the-top he was actually down the other side and into the excruciating. Ham
wasn't in it. Stephen Chaundy as Ernesto at least had some stage presence, but
he appeared to be pushing his voice all night and quite a few times pushed it
too far, especially in that last-act duet - ouch!
Frances Morrison can really sing and if left to be herself could have made
something of her role as Norina. Best of all was Ivor Klayman as Malatesta
performing like a real trouper levitating above the sinking sands.
And how did Studio Performance Group allow themselves to get involved in the
last-act ballet sequence? To be positive, a couple of the duets and all the
quartets demonstrated real potential in these voices if only they had been
placed in a safer pair of hands. If you want to judge for yourself it's
repeated on Sunday and Tuesday, but better wear your thermals against this
venue's Siberian draughts - and oh, maybe a blindfold, too.

WHERE there is hope, there is life - HOPE being the acronym for Hands off
Powderhall Evermore, the lobby group fighting to keep the developers'
bulldozers off one of the most historic tracts of Scotland's sporting turf.
This week, they have taken satisfaction from an Edinburgh District Council
delay in adoption of the local plan which could have approved the site's
rescheduling for housing. Each delay enhances their chances of success.
The English developers want to demolish the stadium in the face of attempts to
have it preserved as a site of historic importance, of some local opposition,
and a catalogue of other objections. Now they have had to postpone their own
application to develop the site which has earned no revenue since speedway
closed down at the beginning of October.
If the developers succeed, it will be at the expense of an irreplaceable piece
of Scotland's heritage.
Built on land owned by the Balfour family of Pilrig - the first laird was a
sponsor of the ill-fated South Sea Bubble and the second was the grandfather of
Robert Louis Stevenson - it owed its name to the fact that William III had
given the first laird the exclusive rights to manufacture gunpowder.
It was on Powderhall's ash surface that track athletics in Scotland had its
respectable roots, after riots at meetings in Portobello and Newington. The
famous professional sprint was first staged there in 1871, and switched to
Meadowbank only after George McNeill had won a century later.
It hosted the first of 16 Scottish Amateur Athletic Association championships
in 1883; Eric Liddell worked out there thrice a week prior to winning the 1924
Olympic 400m title, while whippets were trained on the opposite straight -
hence scenes for the Oscar-winning film, Chariots of Fire, having been shot
there. Liddell won the 100 and 220-yard titles on cinders in 1922 when the SAAA
championships were staged there for the final time.
Scotland's international rugby XV was undefeated on its turf, with an 8-3
victory over Ireland, in 1897, and a 3-3 draw with England the following year.
It was also the home of the former Scottish Football League side, Leith
Athletic.
The Edinburgh Cup, one of UK greyhound racing's most prestigious awards, has
attracted the finest dogs in Britain, most notably Pigalle Wonder, the English
derby winner which won twice.
Howard Wallace, a taxation manager and HOPE spokesman, is one of the greyhound
fanatics whose life has gone to the dogs since the closure battle was joined
when the traps last sprang open, back in January. ``We have to look on the
delay as good news,'' said Wallace, who is also encouraged by the refusal of
Glasgow's councillors to see Shawfield similarly disposed of.
The Edinburgh lobby group drew attention to the Secretary of State's concerns
over housing being built on land susceptible to flooding, and this week
Edinburgh's planning department admitted that construction engineers say the
ground adjacent to the Water of Leith, will have to be raised by two metres if
housing is built.
The Wildlife Trust is also watching developments with interest and concern; the
city's environmental services department is understood to be unhappy at the
proximity of housing to a refuse compaction unit committed to disposing of
three tonnes of waste per week for the next 20 years; and from January 1, the
Scottish Office will direct greater scrutiny on sports ground land rezoned for
housing. The latest delay suggests there will be no planning hearing until
January 18.
Edinburgh Monarchs are used to being let down by the district council, but
would be devastated by the ultimate betrayal which would leave them homeless.
Old Meadowbank, their previous track, was demolished to make way for the 1970
Commonwealth stadium. ``There was no speedway in Edinburgh for six years,
despite council assurances to the contrary,'' said Mike Hunter, the Monarchs'
spokesman.
In 1977, the Greyhound Racing Association welcomed them to Powderhall, but the
city fathers permitted the move by only one vote. Monarchs finances have always
lain uneasy. Sponsorless and given just four days to find #10,000 or face
closure in 1991, they succeeded in raising #18,000 in one night, at a
supporters' meeting. The season just concluded, has ironically again been
without a sponsor, yet was their best at Powderhall. They finished ninth out of
the 21 in the new Premier League.
``We are due to restart at the end of March or beginning of April. We have made
a few vague enquiries about a temporary venue, but our preferred home is
Powderhall.''
Ashes to ashes? We certainly hope not.

OUTDOOR raves in Edinburgh will be allowed only in the summer in future and be
restricted to 12 hours.
The recommendations were accepted by Edinburgh Licensing Committee yesterday
after reports about an outdoor rave at Ingliston in September which lasted from
Saturday noon until 8am Sunday.
A police report said that more than 11,500 people, aged between 16 and 25, had
attended. The weather was described as ``atrocious''. Medical treatment was
required for 264 people, with 54 suffering from hypothermia.
The report added that a rest area had been provided in a restaurant. ``This
facility was intended as a `chill-out' area for dancers to rest, but due to the
severe weather conditions it was more of a `warm-up' area.''
The committee agreed to accept the recommendations for future outdoor raves and
to have talks with promoters.
It then approved an all-night indoor Hogmanay rave at Ingliston for 5000 people
lasting from 8pm on December 31 to 8am on January 1.

SCOTLAND has a second-class legal system as result of fundamental flaws in
making judicial appointments, the Shadow Lord Advocate, Lord Macaulay of Bragar
QC, said yesterday.
Addressing the Standing Conference on Justice's annual convention in Edinburgh,
he said there was ample scope for reform in the wake of constitutional change.
He said the glut of temporary sheriffs ran counter to continuity, consistency
in sentencing, and public confidence in the administration of justice.
``What we have at the moment in Scotland is a second-class legal system. We
have nearly 200 temporary sheriffs wandering about the country who suddenly
appear out of the blue.
``Solicitors and sheriffs in the smaller towns and communities, who know what's
going on in their area, are presented with a member of the Bar or a solicitor
and wonder who he or she is.
``It is a ridiculous way to run things. We must try and build into the Scottish
legal system some kind of permanency within sheriffdoms,'' Lord Macaulay said.
The Labour spokesman in the Lords on Scottish legal matters said there were
similar problems higher up in the appointment of temporary judges.
``A temporary judge is supposed to have full powers of a Senator of the Court
of Justice but I am informed that some temporary judges are not allowed to deal
with rape or murder charges,'' he said.
This had led to some trials being called off, despite witnesses, counsel, and a
jury being ready, because the case had been allocated to a temporary judge.
``The greatest example, however, is the ability of the Lord Advocate to appoint
himself on to the bench.
``In no other profession can you promote yourself. Could you imagine a corporal
making himself a general or a junior doctor making himself a consultant? It is
just a complete nonsense,'' he said.

ATHLETICS
WILL the greatest field events performance in athletics history - Jon Edwards'
two successive world records to take world championship triple jump gold - be
rewarded by the sport this weekend? Or will the International Amateur Athletics
Federation's gala in Monte Carlo again be exposed to allegations of vote
rigging?
As candidates for the World Athlete of the Year title jetted into Monaco last
night, Chris Winner, one of those responsible for organising last year's
presentations, claimed the voting had been rigged, denying Sally Gunnell the
women's title, in order to boost TV ratings.
Winner, the former IAAF spokesman, insists that Britain's Gunnell had topped
last year's poll, having broken the world 400m hurdles record. In doing so she
became the first woman to hold world, Olympic, European and Commonwealth titles
simultaneously. Yet Winner alleges Gunnell was replaced as the female athlete
of the year by American Jackie Joyner Kersee. He also alleges that Britain's
Colin Jackson was demoted from second to fourth in the men's voting.
American Winner said that manipulation occured when the IAAF learned that
neither Gunnell nor Jackson planned to attend the ball at which the awards were
due to be announced. IAAF general secretary Istvan Gyulai last night flatly
rejected the allegations.
Writing in a US newspaper, Winner said: ``I can only express shame for
participating in what amounts to gross vote-rigging.'' He claimed that IAAF
president Primo Nebiolo wanted to ensure the top three athletes in both male
and female polls would attend, making it more attractive to TV.
After advising IAAF officials that Gunnell had narrowly beaten Joyner Kersee to
the top spot, Winner said he had been instructed to add 30 extra votes for
Joyner Kersee - two weeks after the poll had closed.
Edwards, along with double world champion Michael Johnson, is the main
contender for the men's award. Burns victim Anna Quirot, who won the world 800m
title, is the leading female candidate.

THE Camanachd Association, shinty's ruling body have chosen Alastair MacIntyre
of Fort William as their first full-time paid official.
The 57-year-old has been the association's part-time administrator for the last
10 years. A keen golfer and chairman of the Ben Nevis Race Association, he has
one Camanachd Cup-winner's medal from the '60s and two runners-up awards.
He was chosen from a short leet of four which included association president
Duncan Cameron of Glasgow.
The final selection panel met in Oban following an extraordinary meeting of the
association's Executive Council earlier in the week, which was called following
Mr Cameron's decision to throw his hat in the ring.
One of the official's first tasks will be to explain his new function to clubs.
His new role has yet to be fully explained to them and the speed with which the
final specification of the job was drawn up by the game's administrators
already has caused some disquiet.
Mr MacIntyre, who runs a successful bus company, now has a three-year contract
and the backing of the majority of the executive to prove that he was the right
man for the job.
He is due to take up his #18,000-a-year post on January 1.

CHILDREN in Lothian may be travelling to and from school in ``rust-buckets on
wheels'', it was claimed yesterday.
Police, along with the Department of Transport Vehicle Inspectorate, have
launched spot checks on school buses.
A senior police officer said yesterday that, in some cases, ``rust-buckets on
wheels'' had been discovered during their week-long initiative, and a
Department of Transport official admitted that, since deregulation, smaller
operators have been ``cutting corners''.
Of more than 100 buses checked so far, five have been issued with defect forms
- while one had so many faults that its operator is being reported to the
fiscal.
Taxis and private hire cars are also used for transporting children to schools,
and nine have already been found in breach of the conditions of their licence.
Another three were warned to rectify minor faults.
Yesterday, police set up checks at various locations around Edinburgh and
Lothian.
While many transport operators ran vehicles in first-class condition,
transporting children in complete safety, a number had been far too lax, it was
alleged.
Chief Inspector Bryan Lowrie, of Lothian and Borders Police traffic department,
said: ``Our checks have shown some alarming discrepancies in tyres,
documentation, and other aspects of transport.
``Basically, we have found that in some cases, rust-buckets on wheels have been
used to take children to and from school.
``So far, we have checked in excess of 150 vehicles and issued 14
prohibitions.''
Mr David Wilson, of the Department of Transport, admitted that, since
deregulation, smaller operators had been able to ``cut corners''.
He said: ``This is something we monitor continually, in an effort to find the
so-called cowboy operators.
``I would admit that many of the vehicles we have checked are in excellent
condition but, in some cases, it is concerning.''
Mrs Elizabeth Maginnis, Lothian's education committee convener, said: ``We hope
this initiative will dissuade the so-called cowboy operators, because we take
the view that any future contracts would come under serious consideration.''

POLICE in Belfast were hunting two men and a woman last night after a man was
shot dead on a city street.
The shooting is thought to be linked to trade in illegal drugs, and is the
third such killing in recent months.
Paul Devine, a married man in his 30s, was shot as he got into a car parked in
Claremont Street off Lisburn Road.
Witnesses heard between four and six shots ring out. An office worker said: ``I
went downstairs to see the guy lying beside a car in a pool of blood. He had
been hit twice that I could see, once in the back of the head and once in the
chest.''
Devine, who was known to the RUC, lived close to where he was shot. Detectives
ruled out a sectarian motive for his murder.
Two drug dealers were shot dead by the IRA this year.

THE Prime Minister responded angrily yesterday to the IRA's refusal to
surrender any weapons, denouncing it as ``a slap in the face'' to the hopes for
peace of the people of Northern Ireland.
He challenged Sinn Fein to denounce the IRA, after the paramilitaries issued a
defiant statement rejecting demands that they make a gesture on arms
decommissioning to allow all-party talks to go ahead.
Instead, Sinn Fein accused the Government of ``intransigence'' for sticking to
its condition that some weapons should be surrendered as a sign of good faith
before talks can proceed.
The IRA statement confirmed that despite, the British-Irish twin-track
agreement signed on the eve of President Bill Clinton's visit to Northern
Ireland, the principal obstacle to the peace process remains.
Unionists interpreted it as a fatal blow to the twin-track agreement, which
allows preliminary talks to begin while the arms decommissioning issue is
examined by an international commission headed by former US senator George
Mitchell.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionists, said: ``This must
wreck the prospects that Senator George Mitchell had in terms of the arms
commission, and therefore the twin-track process must be dead.''
The Ulster Unionists' deputy leader, Mr John Taylor, added: ``If there is
intransigence it certainly exists with the IRA. It was they who over a year ago
announced a ceasefire and gave the impression that they wished to transform
themselves from being a terrorist organisation into a constitutional political
party.''
In a statement Mr Major said: ``The IRA's intransigence is a slap in the face
to the hundreds of thousands of people in Northern Ireland and the Republic,
who last week demonstrated their massive desire for peace.
``The message of all those people to the paramilitaries was that their day was
over and that now was the time to put away guns, give up violence forever and
make peace.''
Later, he challenged Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams to distance himself from the
IRA.
``Is Gerry Adams the man who wants to bring peace to Northern Ireland or is he
a straightforward spokesman for a terrorist organisation who continues
producing intransigent statements and putting a bottleneck in the way of
peace?'' he said.
The arms question has divided the Government and Sinn Fein since the start of
the cease-fire last year. Mr Adams said yesterday any decommissioning of
weapons would amount to an IRA surrender, which was unacceptable.
``These are not fresh doubts. The doubts arise from the British Government's
refusal to engage positively in this peace process from the inception, by its
repeated bad faith, by it placing a new precondition - and this business of
decommissioning is a new precondition which the British Government put forward
five months after the IRA's decision,'' he said.
The IRA's message, released in Dublin, said: ``There is no question of the IRA
meeting the ludicrous demand for a surrender of IRA weapons either through the
front or the back door.''
Government sources deny Britain is seeking an IRA surrender, and insist it is
up to Sinn Fein to find a way around the issue. Britain rejects the party's
claim that British police and army weapons in the province would have to be
scrapped as well.
In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister John Bruton remained optimistic. ``It is better
to concentrate on facts and the fact is that Sinn Fein stated that they will
speak authoritatively to the international body on the issue of IRA weapons.''

A STUDY to monitor Lothian's declining red squirrel population was launched in
Edinburgh yesterday by the Scottish Wildlife Trust.
It will involve a unique project funded by Lothian region's environmental award
scheme to monitor red squirrel numbers.
``Sticky tubes'' made from short lengths of guttering and with double-sided
sticky tape at each end will be attached to branches and filled with food in 30
sites in East Lothian where the squirrels have been spotted.
A survey team will then analyse hairs under the microscope to assess numbers.
The study is expected to be completed next spring.
The trust fears numbers may drop as dramatically north of the Border as in
England and Wales. Changes in forestry and the environment have been blamed for
the fall.
There are also fears the native population may be overrun by the grey squirrel.
Study team member Jon Durward, said there were an estimated 121,000 red
squirrels in Scotland.
``We hope this study will also help conserve the numbers in Lothian,'' he said.
Red squirrels are now a protected species in the UK.

THE Tron Theatre Company's award-winning production of Dumbstruck showcased
their panache with black comedy and this new comedy musical written by and
starring the ginger bombshell Forbes Masson offers them another opportunity to
strut their skill with theatre noir. Mind you, although the play is set in a
world of morticians and cemeteries it's hardly dark and brooding, Masson
endowing his Faustian plot with a light, frothy touch which makes it
particularly gigglesome.
He certainly doesn't flinch from extracting the full quotient of potential
double entendres in the opening title number, which is stuffed to overflowing
with gags about stiffies. But there's subtlety too - as in the romantic duet
with girlfriend Jennifer Black where he croons that coupledom is being like
gravy going with a deep ashen pie. It's a passion which is surpassed by Black's
later torch song number where she responds to him giving her the elbow with the
acidic invocation Die Soon.
The dialogue, which lacks the cutting edge of David Kane's Dumbstruck, could be
sharpened up a bit but there are plenty of hilarious observations to keep you
chuckling along, such as the description of an award-winning monumental -
that's gravestone to us lay folk - artist as someone who could ``chisel in four
languages and one of them was Gaelic.
Part of the Tron's New Scottish Writing showcase season, we can only fervently
pray that the project will flourish into production next year. This rehearsed
reading of the first act, replete with appropriate onstage corpsing, offered an
entertaining taster of a treat in store. I almost died laughing.

A FATAL accident inquiry report yesterday criticised a surgeon and the Shetland
Health Board, more than two years after an islands' councillor bled to death
following a gall bladder operation.
The health board has already made changes to its procedures.
Sheriff Colin Scott Mackenzie said it was not appropriate for his inquiry to
attribute negligence to surgeon John Parkin, 51. However, he cited evidence - a
report by two independent consultants on behalf of Shetland Health Board - that
``had, in fact, found Mr Parkin to be negligent''.
The sheriff said the death of Councillor Alex Arthur, 68, at the Gilbert Bain
Hospital in Lerwick in July, 1993, ``might have been avoided'' if senior
medical staff had paid closer attention to his condition after the operation
and if Mr Parkin had not ``misinterpreted'' the situation.
He determined that, after unexpected difficulties during surgery on the
afternoon of July 9, 1993, Mr Parkin had acted properly, until he attached a
drain tube in such a way that it later partly dislodged Mr Arthur's gall
bladder from his liver, causing severe internal bleeding.
The sheriff praised nurses who noticed the problem soon after Mr Arthur was
returned to the ward at 4.40pm. At 7.10pm a ``very junior'' hospital doctor
phoned the surgeon at home about the problem, but Mr Parkin did not question
her as closely as he might have.
Mr Parkin phoned the ward at 7.30pm and prescribed drugs. He arranged for blood
to be matched for a transfusion. He did not return to the hospital until 8.55pm.
When a nurse mentioned the persistent bleeding from the tube, he said: ``Panic
not, that is what drains are for.''
After speaking to Mr Arthur's wife, the surgeon decided to go home again while
blood was prepared. The sheriff said: ``In leaving the hospital at this time he
had misinterpreted the seriousness of Mr Arthur's condition.''
He was paged before he reached his house and arrived back at the hospital at
about 10.15pm. More than an hour later, after further delays awaiting
cross-matched blood, he began a second operation to try to save his patient's
life.
Mr Arthur died on the operating table at 1.50am on July 10, 1993.
In an immensely detailed, 50-page judgment, Sheriff Mackenzie had no criticism
of the junior hospital doctors, the nurses who ``had done all that was humanly
possible'', or of the anaesthetist, who ``battled without pause'' to keep Mr
Arthur alive.
Mr Parkin, who retired early on medical grounds last year, had been criticised
with hindsight, the sheriff said. He had admitted errors while working under
stress and should be accorded due sympathy.
Mr Arthur's only son, Alan, 45, in a statement after the judgment, said: ``The
family are satisfied that at last the findings have been published. We hope
this inquiry may lead to safer practices in the future, for the sake of all
patients in Shetland.''
Dr Cox said: ``The board of course deeply regrets this tragic event and would
wish to be associated with the sheriff's expression of sympathy to Mr Arthur's
family.''
Last night Mr Parkin said: ``Obviously my deepest sympathy goes to the family.
I'm very saddened by the fact that an operation undertaken with the best of
motives should have such a tragic outcome.''

SCIENTISTS investigating BSE for the Government were accused yesterday of
failing to conduct obvious experiments which help establish whether the deadly
brain condition could be transmitted to humans.
Dr Helen Grant said researchers should have found out whether monkeys or apes
could develop BSE.
The brain expert told Radio 4's consumer programme, You and Yours, that
deliberately infecting primates with the disease should have been a priority
experiment because primates are the nearest animals in the evolutionary chain
to man.
``They should have used primates in this experiment using BSE-infected material
and they didn't,'' said Dr Grant, former consultant neuropathologist at Charing
Cross Hospital, London.
``I imagine they were terrified it might be positive: that the primates would
get the infection when injected with or fed BSE-infected materials.
``If primates caught the infection from the cows, it would suggest very
strongly that humans might do the same, because we humans are another primate.''
The microbiologist who heads the committee investigating BSE admitted, on the
same programme, that there had been no BSE tests on primates.
Professor John Pattison, chairman of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory
Committee, said that even if a chimpanzee or a monkey developed the disease it
would not conclusively prove that it could be transmitted to man.
However, Professor Pattison, professor of medical microbiology at University
College London Medical School, indicated that BSE experiments might be carried
out on primates in the not-too-distant future.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food said it was
for the committee to decide which experiments were carried out.
He dismissed any suggestion that the Government might have pressured scientists
not to test monkeys for fear of the panic a positive result would cause.
``There have not been any transmissions to primates,'' Professor Pattison told
You and Yours.
``All I can say is that we, at our meeting early next month, are going to
consider the research priorities and we will be considering all avenues of
approach.''
He added: ``These are expensive and long-term experiments. It doesn't in itself
prove that it would transmit to man even if it does transmit to primates.''
On Thursday, he told PA News that it was not possible to guarantee that BSE
could not be transmitted to humans, although the evidence pointed in that
direction.
He insisted that his committee was independent and under no pressure from the
Government to say beef was safe.
Hundreds of schools around Britain have now taken beef products off their
menus. Consumer groups say the Government should hold a public inquiry into BSE
but Ministers continue to insist that beef is safe.
The latest scare was triggered a week ago when another leading brain scientist,
Professor Sir Bernard Tomlinson, told You and Yours that he no longer ate beef
products containing offal because of his concern about the disease.
Many other eminent scientists have also said a link between BSE and its human
equivalent, CJD, is possible.

FAILURE to agree monetary union and greater integration will lead Europe to

has warned.
Speaking in advance of next weekend's crucial European summit in Madrid, Mr
Ashdown said public sector strikes in France and British Euro-scepticism were
combining to reverse the march towards European integration.
In an interview for the BBC programme Scottish Lobby, to be broadcast tomorrow,
Mr Ashdown says that unless monetary union succeeds Europe will see ``the
return to competitive states and in my view war, or at least conflict, either
within the European borders or outside the European borders, within two
decades''.
His apocalyptic scenario is based on European history. War had been the natural
state of Europe for 2000 years. ``The biggest idea, the only idea to come out
of Europe in the last 50 years, is the idea of European unity and European
integration,'' he said.
``It's the only thing that saves us from rising nationalism within European
countries. You see it in Germany. You don't have to go to Sarajevo to see it,
you can see it at the Conservative Party conference in Britain.
``So may it be in no doubt whatsoever, if monetary union fails - and I agree,
it is now in extreme jeopardy - if it fails, then the process of European
integration will go into reverse, Europe will return to competing states, and
given our history, we know where that leads.''
Mr Ashdown's comments are the starkest warning yet of the implications for
Europe if its member states fail to agree on the monetary union and greater
integration by 1999, as prescribed by the Maastricht Treaty.
He pointed to the fall of the Soviet union leaving chaos in the east of Europe,
and warned that Bosnia was not an isolated event. ``Europe is most at danger
when empires collapse.''

THE cast of television soap Coronation Street attended a dinner last night to
celebrate its 35th birthday.
The Manchester Town Hall bash went on as millions of viewers tuned in to watch
barmaid Raquel - actress Sarah Lancashire - marry Curly Watts, actor Kevin
Kennedy.
The hour-long episode was filmed amid strict secrecy and was expected to
attract more than 20 million viewers.
Three different endings to storyline involving dizzy Raquel, her ex-lover Des
Barnes and Curly were filmed before programme chiefs made a late decision on
which to screen.
Arriving at the official party, Miss Lancashire wore a black evening dress with
drop neckline and wore a ruby necklace as she smiled and waved on the town hall
steps.
She arrived arm-in-arm with the show's creator Tony Warren and actresses
Sherrie Hewson, shopkeeper Maureen Holdsworth, and Amanda Barrie, cafe owner
Alma Baldwin.
Last night's episode finally saw womanising Des sweet-talk Raquel into his flat
and into bed after his married girlfriend Liz McDonald ends their brief fling.
Later, in a fit of disillusionment in the cold light of day Raquel decided to
marry long-time suitor, Curly Watts. After the registry office wedding viewers
were still left wondering about the TV couple's future happiness.
Raquel was shown sobbing in the ladies' toilet minutes before the ceremony,
then going through her marriage vows with an anguished look - and a drawn-out
pause before she uttered the words `` . . .  my lawful, wedded husband.''

ROBERT POWELL,
CAMERON SIMPSON
EXCLUSIVE
THE 27p cut on a bottle of whisky in last month's Budget could be wiped out
next year as distillers pass on the rising price of barley and packaging to
consumers.
It is expected cereal increases will add about 20p to the cost of producing a
bottle and Mr John Goodwin, the chairman of Highland Distilleries, which makes
Famous Grouse, said some price rises next year would be inevitable.
Last night, the SNP, which had campaigned for a 10% cut in duty in the Budget,
said the threat was a measure of how the industry had been duped by the
Chancellor.
The cut the SNP had campaigned for would have taken 76p off a bottle, said
party business spokesman, Mr Fergus Ewing. ``The industry has been tricked and
is still paying nearly #1000m a year in tax revenues. The real message of the
Chancellor's Budget is Slainte you suckers.''
The threat was also greeted with dismay by the General, Municipal, and
Boilermakers, the largest union in the Scotch whisky industry. Spokesman Harry
Donaldson said: ``If rising costs mean they would wipe out the Chancellor's 27p
cut then clearly Kenneth Clarke has not gone nearly far enough.
He added: ``My real fear is that the industry will get into a price war. The
pressure will be on for sales and that would have a catastrophic effect on the
industry. Some of the smaller players could be forced out of business.''
Mr Donaldson said he also feared that the consumer would not tolerate any
further price rises and would turn instead to wine and white spirits.
The industry has seen packaging costs rise by up to 30% this year while the
price of malting barley is set to rise by up to 10% in 1996. Maize and wheat,
which are used to distil grain whiskies, are also set to rise by a similar
margin.
This will pile even more pressure on distillers who have felt unable to pass on
rising costs

for the past two years. Instead, they have been discounting heavily to retain
their share of a weak market awash with surplus stocks.
Mr Goodwin said: ``There is a need for some price increases because I think the
price of our cereal purchases for 1996 will be up by somewhere between eight
and 10%. We have also sustained increases over the past year on all types of
packaging so I think we need a modest increase in price.''
Mr Peter Derbyshire, the managing director of Macdonald Martin which makes
Glenmorangie malt, said they had reached a point ``where we really cannot
absorb any more increases in the price of raw materials.'' He said the expected
rise in cereal prices next year would add about 20p to the cost of producing a
bottle of whisky without allowing for any increase in profit margins.
Mr Alan Gray, a whisky analyst with Edinburgh stockbroker Sutherland and
Partners, said the inevitable rise in cereal costs would encourage distillers
to go for price increases that have been overdue for two years.

<TEXT>
WORKERS at the Arnish fabrication yard near Stornoway last night voted to hold
a ballot on industrial action.
The decision, taken at a mass meeting of the men, followed their rejection of a
20p-an-hour pay rise which was management's final offer after two and a half
weeks of negotiations.
Talks were held all day yesterday to try to break the deadlock.
Three weeks ago, all 305 shopfloor workers were sacked after they began an
overtime ban.
They were reinstated by yard operator Lewis Offshore Ltd a few days later after
a deal was reached with a commitment to new pay talks, which ended yesterday.
An official ballot was held during the week which decisively rejected the offer.
Feelings have been running high because LOL managing director Peter Webster
threatened to shut the yard if the men did not go back to work.
It is understood that, despite the yard's considerable work in progress and a
new #1m contract announced only last week, management have still not ruled out
closure if the men take industrial action.
However, the men claim their #7.07 hourly rate is the lowest of any fabrication
yard in the UK.
A joint statement after a further meeting between LOL and workers
representatives, including a GMB union official, confirmed the rejection of the
pay offer and that a formal ballot would be held on industrial action.
The decision to ballot was not unanimous but was carried by a substantial
majority, according to workers leaving the meeting.
Mr Webster was not available last night to comment on the men's move towards
industrial action.

Lama Yeshe was born in Tibet in 1947 and came to Scotland in 1969. He founded a
retreat at Woodstock in the Catskill Moun-tains of the USA, and is now Retreat
Master for 40 students from 16 countries on a re-treat at Samye Ling of three
years, three months and three days. He is also manager and executive director
for projects at Samye Ling Buddhist Temple at Eskdalemuir and has founded the
Buddhist retreat on Holy Island. He tells Leila Farrah about a typical day's
eating.
n OUR Buddhist philosophy says that you should try to maintain a simple
lifestyle so food is not the main thing in our lives. For breakfast I just have
a cup of black tea, some Cheddar on toast and an orange, a habit I picked up in
America because it's good for Vitamin C.
At Samye Ling Temple, there's a differ-ent vegetarian cook every second day
doing their own dishes, but I always try to have yoghurt fresh from the farm
there. Yoghurt is so good for you and it is very popular in Tibet. Everyone at
Samye Ling knows that the Lama likes yoghurt so they always get me a bowl. I'll
have raw carrot, too, then another orange and perhaps a banana.
For the past 13 years I haven't eaten any other solid foods after my daily
lunch. For many people, food is everything but we don't feel that we should
indulge ourselves. I have many students who look to me for an example so this
becomes important, and I have a very strong self-discipline.
If hunger comes to me just before lunch I let it pass, and then I feel strong
and good. I'm not consumed by the need for food: when we become involved in
dependencies, then we jump into bad eating habits, we engage with food too
much. It also means that we have no respect for people without food; so much of
it is wasted in the garbage, and in our philosophy, we can't tolerate that.
Because I visit many different places, although I am a vegetarian, sometimes I
have no choice but to eat meat or fish - I have to be flexible. In Japan it
took me two days to find a vegetarian restaurant; very expensive and not much
food for it.
I have no favourite dishes, as such; I would never allow my mind to indulge in
that. But I am quite chubby and everyone tells the cooks at Samye Ling not to
feed the Lama cakes - sometimes I have a good feeling about cakes .....

The regeneration of
a city, argues Michael Pacione, must be shaped from within, rather than left to
the creative whims of outsiders
THE approach of a new year, and of a new millennium, encourages people to
engage in reflection and stocktaking. It is a time to look back on past
achievements and mistakes and forward to, hopefully, better times. The same is
true for Glasgow. What are the prospects for the city as it approaches the
millennium? How has the city responded to the economic and social shockwaves of
the last quarter of the twentieth century? Have those responsible for guiding
the development of the city been successful? Have the foundations been laid for
sustainable urban regeneration? Or will Glasgow arrive at the millennium party
in old clothes and with a dirty face?
Let's pause to consider the main causes of the problems confronting Glasgow and
examine the effects of recent policies designed to enhance the socio-economic
health of the city and its citizens. Let us seek to identify some of the
ingredients of a prescription for the future well-being of the city.
While it is of little consolation to those experiencing social and economic
disadvantage, Glasgow is not unique in experiencing the pain of economic
contraction and urban restructuring. Many of the world's cities are currently
undergoing social, economic, political and environmental changes of
unprecedented magnitude. Such changes are the outcome of the interplay of
decisions taken by a host of private and public interests operating at a
variety of geographic scales, from global to local. In order to understand the
consequences of these changes for Glasgow it is necessary to acknowledge the
working of the capitalist system and the rise of a global economy.
An inherent characteristic of the capitalist global economic system is the
creation of uneven development which stems from the prosperity of capital to
flow to locations which offer the greatest potential economic return. This
differential use of space by capital in pursuit of profit creates a mosaic of
inequality at all geographical scales.
At any one time certain countries, regions, cities and communities will be in
the throes of decline as a result of the retreat of capital investment while
others will be experiencing the impact of capital inflows. Older industrial
cities like Glasgow have been among the biggest losers in this global
investment competition, with large areas economically and socially devastated
by the effects of global economic restructuring and the deindustrialisation of
the British economy. Within the city the outcome of the uneven development
process is seen in the poverty, powerlessness and polarisation of localities
which, though remaining meaningful places to their residents, are not regarded
as profitable spaces by capital.
Cities vary in their capacity to meet the challenge posed by globalisation and
this is reflected in the extent to which each can shape, or merely react to,
global forces. In the case of Glasgow the harshness of current economic reality
is illuminated by comparing its nineteenth-century status as industrial
powerhouse and workshop of the world with present circumstances in which the
city's development is influenced to a significant extent by forces beyond its
control. Even more striking is the fact that the day-to-day well-being of a
family in Easterhouse can be determined by decisions taken in the boardroom of
a multinational corporation located in one of the ``command cities'' of the
global economy.
Although the power of global forces to influence city growth or decline is
awesome it is not omnipotent. Economic and political action undertaken at a
national level or by regional groupings of nation states (such as the EC) or,
to a lesser extent, by local governments can modify the effects of the global
economic system.
Regulatory and tax policies shape the environments which attract or repel
investors. Decisions about public investment determine whether infrastructure
(such as housing, hospitals, roads, and schools) will be built or allowed to
deteriorate. Government procurement policy, (including the naval shipbuilding
contracts on which Yarrow depends), stimulates the local economy, and the
inter-governmental transfer payments (either directly through Urban Aid or via
agencies such as the Glasgow Development Agency) can prevent the collapse of a
local economy.
Unfortunately for Glasgow, since 1979, the emphasis in Government policy has
been to promote national economic growth irrespective of its geographical
distribution within the country. This has only indirectly addressed the
difficulties experienced by these localities which are marginal to the
market-driven development process.
Recent changes in the relationship between central and local government have
also reduced Glasgow's ability to tackle its problems. In the late 1970s, in
the face of increasing fiscal crises and the consequent search for cuts in
public spending, the earlier consensus between central and local government,
manifested in the GEAR project, was replaced by growing conflict and increased
central intervention in traditional areas of local authority responsibility
such as housing (through controls on capital spending and council house sales
policy), and tight control over local finance. The effect was increased
centralisation of power alongside decentralisation of service responsibility.
The ensuing need for Glasgow to seek financial support by entering into
partnerships with public agencies, such as the Scottish Development
Agency/Scottish Enterprise and the private sector has weakened the leadership
role of the local authority and reduced its ability to develop
locally-sensitive strategies for urban renewal. While some would see this trend
as desirable, others view it as a sign of a continued and unwelcome reduction
in the autonomy of local government.
The latest round of local government reforms which removed the higher tier
authorities also ignored the fact that the functional boundary of the City of
Glasgow extends well beyond its administrative area. While a number of
conflicts arose between the city and the regional authority, not least with
reference to planning and development issues, proponents of regional government
would contend that a major success was its ability to effect resource
redistribution through the tax system. This, of course, is one of the main
reasons why suburban local authorities around Glasgow have long resisted
integration with the city to form a functional city region.
Nevertheless, it is axiomatic that strategic planning at a level which
acknowledges the functional linkages within a city region is essential for
effective government. The question for debate is whether this should be
provided by a regional tier of government, by collaboration between unitary
local authorities for specific programmes, by a body such as a West of Scotland
Planning Commission, or possibly by a unitary system overseen by a Scottish
Assembly. These are important questions for the future.
The depth of Glasgow's current social and economic difficulties was highlighted
first in 1971 when analysis of the census placed Clydeside at the top of the
national deprivation league. Over the intervening years the nature and location
of the city's problems have changed. Between 1971 and 1981 the traditional
tenement areas of the inner city characterised by large areas of substandard
housing, recorded a relative improvement in status. This was largely a result
of a massive clearance and redevelopment programme undertaken by the local
authority combined, in some areas, with modernisation and new building by
housing associations and private developers.
This policy involved the large-scale relocation of residents in a general
process of decentralisation. By 1981 it was apparent that the focus of
deprivation, marked primarily by social and economic problems related to
unemployment and overcrowding, had shifted to the public-sector housing estates
on the edge of the city. The need for policy instruments that reflected this
new geography of need was also starkly evident.
The policy response to this revealed geography of need was unequivocal. This is
borne out by examination of the distribution of capital investment undertaken
by the main public and private agencies responible for Glasgow's development
during the 1980s.
This indicates, and most significantly, the dearth of investment in these areas
by either the Scottish Development Agency or the private sector. During its
lifetime the SDA saw itself as a body to exploit the advantages of the Scottish
economy and not as an agency for the socio-economic regeneration of depressed
council estates. As far as the private sector is conerned the outer estates are
``no-go areas''. In practice, throughout the 1980s, despite their designation
as ``planning priority areas'' the peripheral estates received little priority
in terms of attracting more investment or public-agency activity.
In areas such as Glasgow's outer estates central Government's hope of urban
revitalisation through ``capitalism with a social conscience'' is a chimera.
Glasgow's experience of the operation of pro-growth business coalitions (such
as the Chamber of Commerce), civic boosterism (characterised by slogans like
Glasgow's Miles Better and Glasgow's Alive), and local enterprise initiatives
(eg Glasgow Action) confirms that while the market approach may be a logical
response in areas of significant economic potential, it is extremely unlikely
that such a ``top down'' approach will take account adequately of the needs of
the poor, the unemployed, and the deprived residents of the most disadvantaged
areas of the city.
Justification for the Government's market-led approach to urban regeneration
centres on the concept of ``trickle down'' which argues that, in the longer
term, an expanded city revenue base created by central area revitalisation
provides funds that can be used to address social needs. In practice, however,
these funds are generally recycled into further development activity. Nowhere
has a substantial ``trickle down'' effect been demonstrated. The privatisation
of urban development inevitably means accepting a policy of triage and
concentrating on areas of greatest economic potential, with adverse
consequences for other areas.
In Glasgow, despite some involvement by private housebuilders in the outer
estates, the evidence suggests that large-scale regeneration will not occur if
left to market forces. Indeed, it is unrealistic to expect private capital, the
behaviour of which is conditioned by the precepts of risk minimisation and
profit maximisation, to take the lead in redeveloping the peripheral estates.
Easterhouse, (as well as the other outer estates), contains the population of a
medium-sized town. While its disadvantages are apparent, its advantages include
a location on the national motorway network, large areas of developable land, a
resident trainable labour force, and the not inconsiderable ``sweat equity'' of
the local communities (as demonstrated in the Calvay housing co-operative,
Easthall Residents Association, and Easterhouse Festival Society). The catalyst
required to initiate development is a major Government effort similar to that
invested in the GEAR project, or the post-war new towns.
Despite the stark identification of the problems of Glasgow's outer city by
analyses of the last two censuses, and the rhetoric of the Government's New
Life for Urban Scotland report, little has been achieved to alleviate the
difficulties confronting Glasgow's marginalised people and places. In 1993 the
theme of inter-agency co-operation was restated in the formation of the Glasgow
Regeneration Alliance, comprising the local authorities, Glasgow Development
Agency and Scottish Homes, with a remit to invest #1.5bn over 10 years in eight
``priority action areas'' of Greater Easterhouse, Castlemilk, Drumchapel,
Gorbals, Govan, the East End, Glasgow North, and Greater Pollok.
While the improved correspondence between designated action areas and the
revealed areas of need is a positive step critics have questioned how much of
the investment represents ``new money'', as well as the future of the alliance
following the abolition of the regional tier of government in 1996.
To address Glasgow's problems succesfully, urban policy must possess both a
social and economic dimension. It must be concerned as much about the
distribution of wealth as about wealth creation. Such social criteria fit
awkwardly into the conventional balance sheet of economic progress. An
effective attack on Glasgow's problems requires appropriate action at several
scales.
At the national level, a primary requirement is recognition of the fact that
the disadvantaged position of the poor is linked to the privileged position of
the wealthy. This requires enacting a policy that addresses directly the
fundamental question of the distribution of society's wealth. The position of
marginalised populations would also be improved by the creation of a new form
of partnership involving state, capital and citizens.
This would acknowledge the different motives of the partners and enable each to
achieve some of their goals within a framework that facilitates greater
distribution of wealth and opportunity in favour of the disadvantaged. In the
shorter term, easing central Government controls over local authorities would
enable the lower tier to undertake activities of direct benefit to local groups.
Local authorities could promote new forms of tenure and job opportunities by
operating as landowners and developers, or could employ income (eg from council
house and land sales) for the benefit of the disadvantaged areas. Local
government itself must seek to devise more effective strategies to attract
private-sector funding into deprived areas. This will involve both persuasion
(eg via rates relief or flexible planning) and direction (such as linked
development and leverage schemes), with the particular mix depending on the
strength of the local economy.
Local authorities must also accept the principle of subsidiarity. In practice,
this requires for the empowerment of local communities to capitalise on human
resources, and promotion of aided self-help (as pioneered in housing
co-operatives and community businesses).
This will demand a willingness to devolve financial and political power to the
neighbourhood level, with greater participation of residents in budget
formulation and plan preparation for their area. Implementation of such an
agenda is undoubtedly problematic in the short term, not least because it
represents a challenge to the ideology of current urban policy. However, as the
experience of Glasgow demonstrates, failure to achieve policies with an
enhanced social component will ensure that the crisis affecting large sections
of the city will persist well into the twenty-first century.
Since the turn of the century Glasgow has undergone a series of painful
readjustments to changing global economic circumstances, and the modern city
must strive to establish its position in the new world order. Its position as
Second City of the Empire has long gone, and in European terms it is one of a
number of older industrial cities in the throes of regeneration. The world has
moved on and Glasgow has to operate, and increasingly compete, in new political
and economic circumstances.
Most significant of these, and in marked contrast to a time when the city was
at its peak of prosperity, is the rise of a global economic system largely
outwith the control of a single country, or indeed, city. Of equal significance
at the UK level has been the shift in emphasis in public policy and finance
from local to national government.
Both of these structural trends constrain the power of Glasgow to initiate the
necessary social and economic strategies to resolve its current problems. The
task facing the city - to complete a reorientation of its economic base,
restore its economic fortunes, and to ensure fair distribution of the wealth
created - is a daunting one. Only time will tell whether Glasgow is up to the
challenge.

ONE hundred years ago Vesuvius erupted, created a new crater and initiated the
shockwaves of an earthquake which rocked Florence. John Major's early morning
cup of cappuccino followed by a light lunch of pasta and a glass of Chianti
with the Italian Prime Minister Lamberto Dini in that city this week could well
have the same seismic effect on the Labour Party.
It is part of the Prime Minister's grand strategy to win him the next election.
Increasingly, he is convinced the issue which has dogged him and his
predecessor - Europe - is the wildcard which can trump Tony Blair. Forging an
alliance with Signor Dini to oppose the Franco/German plans for a single
currency by 1999, due to be discussed at next week's Madrid summit, is the
first attempt to play it.
No wonder Mr Blair, with his mind on other things, was so flustered during his
visit to Scotland yesterday that he was offering hostages to fortune over the
tartan tax. Apparently it will not be implemented unless the electorate votes
for it. So the assembly will have to be dissolved each time it is proposed.
Will the same be true of Westminster if Gordon Brown as Chancellor wants to put
up taxes? Or will the parliament in London be ruled with an iron fist and that
in Edinburgh with a limp wrist? When will the Scots confined to their creche on
Calton Hill be able to join the grown-ups?
Unfortunately, this faux pas, like others before it seemed to leave Labour
unscathed and the Tories floundering unable, so far, to find an answer as to
how to derail the Blair bandwagon. It is because the Labour leader is an ad
man's dream. He is good looking, articulate, intelligent and the voters
perceive him as courageous and a man of integrity. The media, sensing the
``near inevitability of his Prime Ministership, have reflected this by
unthinkingly conspiring to give him an easy ride. A luxury never permitted
Wilson or Callaghan.
The Conservatives did try to brand him as ``Bambi'' but his squaring up to the
unions over Clause 4 afforded him the opportunity to display his macho
crudentials. Even the accusations that his few declared policies are a ``con''
or that they are ``vacuous'' have fallen on stoney ground, his poll ratings
accelerating with a speed comparable to the American space probe on Jupiter.
The current scare tactics, dreamt up by Tory Central Office, that Blair has a
hidden agenda of socialism, red in tooth and claw, which he will reveal after
election is also pathetic. The public will never swallow it. He is vulnerable
but not in the way those Tory back-room chinless wonders imagine. They will
never come to terms with the Blair phenomenon until they realise it is
underpinned by the man's shrewdness and calculation. Major, in despair, has
fallen back on his own instinct, as he did in the 1992 election when he ignored
these Oxbridge ponces and stepped via his soapbox back to No 10.
This time he again has spotted Labour's (i e Blair's) Achilles heel, Europe. It
is so obvious only those with a First in Greats could have missed it.
Europe is Tony Blair's post-election escape hatch. He is far too clever not to
realise that even a scaled-down version of Labour's economic policy is doomed,
notwithstanding Gordon Brown's cure-all one-off windfall tax. His other problem
is the left in his party who would have the power, depending on the size of
majority, to make him their prisoner.
However, by signing up to the Social Chapter under the Maastricht Treaty, it
will be the European Commission who will determine the pace of socialism in
Britain not the idealists on the National Executive. Furthermore, while the
implementation will disadvantage us against our non-European competitors he
will hope that the protectionism of fortress Europe will cushion that
uncompetitiveness.
He would also want to be bolstered by a powerful, independent Central European
Bank, which, after we have signed up for the Single Currency, would determine
fiscal and monetary policy. It would be like the good old days under Labour in
the mid-1970s when the International Monetary Fund had to be called in to run
our economy. Only this time Labour would be saved that embarrassment and also
that of a sterling crisis. The financial corset of the Bundesbank would stifle
the Loony Left while ensuring measured steps towards Continental corporatism.
Mr Major can expose this deceitful programme by trumpeting the advantages of
Britain's opt-out from the Social Chapter, which has hugely contributed to the
creation of thousands of new jobs from inward investment, by joining with
countries like Italy and Spain in delaying the possibility of a single
currency, and alerting the voters to the consequences of creeping federalism.
It would also be a strong card to play in Scotland where there has been so much
drivel talked about the ``democratic deficit'', particularly from the
Nationalists with their bogus ``Independence in Europe'' platform. If a
``democratic deficit'' - the gap between citizens and institutions - exists
anywhere it is in Europe.
The last thing we want is additional powers to commissioners who are appointed
by governments and who work in secret. The European Parliament is grossly
unrepresentative with one member per 700,000 constituents and such is the
apathy among voters that they are elected on increasingly low turnouts. It has
little power and although in extreme circumstances it could force the
resignation of the Commission, this is as likely as our Queen dissolving the
Commons on a whim. The real power resides with the Council of Ministers over
which the ordinary voter had no direct influence.
This is a genuine debate waiting to take place and which only the Tories can
initiate. It is not anti-Europe it is anti-Federalist but it could scupper Mr
Blair's agenda and create not just a mythical stretch of blue water between the
parties but a yawning chasm.
Not only would it give the electorate the opportunity to have their say on the
kind of Europe they want to see Britain a part of but would present a challenge
to Mr Blair which so far the Tories have failed to deliver.
They will never get away with depicting Mr Blair as an ogre. But the issue of
Europe will represent a dignified test of his sincerity - or lack of it.

Ann Donald wanders through the rooms of poet Edwin Morgan
FRESH from a jam-packed week of readings and part of Glasgay!, Edwin Morgan,
one of Scotland's best-loved poets, is at home to a nosy journalist curious to
check out the room where the illustrious and industrious 75-year-old has
created such timeless and cosmopolitan works to be found in collections such as
From Glasgow to Saturn, The New Divan, and more recently a translation of the
highly-acclaimed play Cyrano de Bergerac.
Stepping through the frosted-glass sliding doors that separate the
workroom/living room from the rest of the flat, is to a degree like stepping
back in time. Were it not for the hi-tech video and TV then this could very
well be a comfortable, domestic scene imported direct from a sixties sitcom,
with its black shiny vinyl settee and comfy chairs, green mosaic coffee table,
elaborate standing window boxes, and durable ``period'' typewriter which takes
pride of place at the worktable.
``I was one of the first to move into this block when it was built in 1962,''
Morgan says of his 30-year-old home, before adding with a smile - ``I still
think of it as my `modern flat'.''
Given the flat's central location and Morgan's reliance on Glasgow's public
transport system it was ideal when he was lecturing in literature at the
University of Glasgow throughout the sixties, seventies, and eighties. This
particular room, which has the bonus of facing both south and west, and is thus
privy to as near to a Mediterranean amount of sunshine that Scottish weather
permits, also proved to be more comfortable to write in than the proposed
``claustrophobic'' study or indeed his short-lived timeshare holiday home
overlooking Loch Rannoch.
``I'm a real city person so I like to look out of my windows at the people
walking by and listen to the noise of the traffic,'' he reveals before
proceeding utterly to destroy that glorious Wordsworthian myth of the tortured
writer seeking his muse among the bracken and heather of a silent countryside.
``I thought going up to Loch Rannoch I would be able to shut myself away from
all the modern distractions and just write like mad,'' he says. ``But I looked
out at the loch and trees and just didn't feel inspired. I missed all the noise
so I sold it,'' admits the confirmed urban dweller with a shrug.
It is here, then, on his sensible and sturdy original 1962 model of a German
Adler Bluebird typewriter, that Morgan types away in the afternoons or evenings
on whatever constitutes his current project, be it poetry, plays, or
translations. ``This is extremely well-made,'' he nods, giving the machine a
friendly pat, ``and it does for my purposes very well.''
Though not a Luddite by any stretch of the imagination - the hi-tech fax and
dinky photocopying machine in his study testify to this - he is unwilling to
trade in the reliable Adler for an alien computer. ``I bought an Amstrad once
but I never got to really love it,'' he sighs. ``It's just an age gap I suppose
but I like to type and see the whole object in front of me rather than write a
poem on a computer when it may disappear if the computer crashes or there's a
power cut as happened here a few weeks ago.''
The workdesk the compact Adler rests upon has a very orderly army appearance
with the essential tools of any scribe neatly laid out in rows: a stapler, a
punch, multi-coloured glass paperweights, calculator - to calculate those
author advances? - sharpened pencils and neatly stacked piles of notes for a
future project. ``These are for a collaborative work with the saxophonist Tommy
Smith at the next Jazz Festival,'' says Morgan as he flicks through a handful
of picture postcards of wild Scottish animals that form the visual inspiration
for the proposed series of poems called Beasts of Scotland, which are intended
to inspire Smith's own creative jazz juices.
Visual inspiration also comes via the cluster of eclectic paintings that face
Morgan's workdesk and are scattered throughout the flat. A number of Glasgow
Boy Peter Howson's less stridently macho works, unrecognisable in their beauty
of colour and delicacy of touch, decorate the hall and living room.
Turning his gaze from the most recent acquisition - a small allegorical version
of Cain and Abel, Morgan then points out his favourite, The Head. ``I love the
extraordinary expression on the man's face,'' he says peering closer into the
very whites of the portrait's startled eyes. As well as Howson and a
shoe-box-sized Stephen Campbell in the hall, other artists culled from a
typical RSA roll-call include Pat Douthwaite's abstract interpretation of the
pursuit of Greek goddess Rhea by Zeus and a beautiful evocative Joan Eardley
street scene of children outside a sweetie shop, which so moved Morgan that he
was inspired to write the simply titled poem, ``To Joan Eardley''.
The unquestionably dominant interior feature in Morgan's home is of course the
thousand of books which he reveals are to be gifted to the Mitchell Library in
the event of his death. ``They come round every Hogmanay to collect a batch,''
he chuckles. ``It's the only way I have of keeping them under control.'' Indeed
a fleeting glance at the vast selection of English and foreign literature
adorning the walls of his study and hall not only suggest the words ``Brazilian
rain forest'' but makes one realise what a tremendous coup the Mitchell have
pulled off in being the lucky recipients of Morgan's personal library.
In the dark study where he confesses, somewhat abashed, that he only comes ``to
hide from the cleaning woman every week'' there is the Scottish literature
section that encompasses everything from medieval Scots to Irvine Welsh, a
comprehensive A to Z of modern twentieth-century poetry, countless shelves of
musty leather-bound bibliographies, anthologies and dictionaries, before the
paper trail explodes out into the hall which in turn boasts a foreign
literature collection that would give the British Library a serious run for its
money.
Let's hope that the Mitchell have to wait a good few years yet before they get
their hands on the contents of Morgan's workplace.

STUDIES have shown that British people, when faced with American know-how often
have a bit of an inferiority complex. Not that I'm saying Americans are
arrogant, just that when the average American starts to talk, they tend to
speak as though they have a right to be arrogant.
We don't feel inferior to all Americans, especially not those who take part in
TV talk shows dealing with ``human stories''. It's difficult to be impressed by
someone who's bubbling away on national TV while there's a caption flashing
beneath them saying ``Bettye-Soo: Broke up with boyfriend because of his
cocaine-addicted dog''.
So, chat show guests apart, we all agree that the Yanks in general have a good
reputation, and as they say in Louisiana, when they talk turkey, they don't
mean stuffin'. Maybe they get their image from the films, where the hero is
inevitably a square-jawed WASP who has a full grasp of science, arts, and car
maintenance. After watching them for years, we assume Americans are all like
that.
Except Jim Carrey. We know he's not smart because, Hollywood tells us, he is in
the process of becoming a huge star because of his ability to make his face
look funny while speaking in a hilarous manner. Although careers have been
built on this, as per, say Malcolm Rifkind, it's unlikely that he will do as
well as the film bosses think. So except for tele-emotional cripples and Jim
Carrey, Yanks have a fairly good reputation, right?
This is what had me worried when I was there for a few days last week. I had to
go to Baltimore to give a talk on a subject that is far too boring for a
respectable family newspaper. The Americans at the conference were exactly the
sort of smart, Apple Pie guys that would grace any film screen, and that's what
put the fear of Gawd into me. I don't mind making a fool of myself on my home
patch, but I don't want to look too stupid in the Land Of the Free, and if
anyone was going to catch me out it was these smarter, harder working, fitter
more committed Americans.
Everyone in America is extremely pleasant, but they are all congenitally unable
to understand the clear-cut tones and slow diction that characterises typical
Glaswegian speech. After the first two days where everyone thought I was Irish,
Norwegian or German, I had slowed down my words significantly. Even if they
didn't understand what I was saying, at least they all realised I was Scottish.
I thought I was ready for my talk.
On the big day I really felt terrible. The day creaked along slowly, and my
palms got sweatier as the appointed hour got nearer. I remember the chairman
calling my name, and Glasgow being pronounced (as always by Americans) as Glass
Cow. The soundtrack for the next few seconds is just the double boom of the
blood rushing through my head. My voice was at first exactly like the teacher's
voice in the Charlie Brown cartoons, and for what seemed like an eternity, the
audience went quiet.
I got to the punchline of my first gag. Nothing. There were a few loud guffaws
from the back, and slowly the rest of the audience got the cue that I had made
a joke. My nerves disappeared. I had thought that they would all be too serious
to ever laugh. You only have to see any sitcom other than the two good ones to
realise that their tolerance for cruddy jokes is actually quite high.
The next day, I went on a present-buying spree. I make a better job of buying
presents in America than my gran used to. In the sixties and seventies she used
to return from the States with her case full of gimmicky nonsense: case-loads
full of tat like Santa-shaped napkin rings, fridge magnets and Kids' drinking
straws that had been moulded into amusing curly shapes. We had Scotland's
biggest collection of American junk, the entire New York branch of
Fridge-Magnets R Us having been bought up by my gran.
Anyway, as part of a family tradition, I was paying for my collection of
camel-shaped monogrammed coasters when the young blonde cashier spotted my
accent. She said that Scottish accents like mine were, and I quote,
``beautiful''. I drew in my stomach and gave a sort of David Hasselhoff smile,
and in a cool, but basically suave manner, I joked that it would be beautiful
if only people could understand me. She fell for this obvious compliment
fishing. ``Not at all, I understand you easily,'' she gushed. ``You're easier
to understand than some of my friends, and English is their first language!'' I
gave up and sneaked out.

THE tall, bearded figure of Dr John Macleod is a well kent and familiar face
among the small population of North Uist. He's unlikely ever to forget the
faces his patients either, many of which have been captured on film during his
island rounds. More than most of his colleagues, Dr Macleod can provide a
complete picture of the place he lives and works in, and the people who give
the place its unique flavour.
As a keen photographer, he always carries a camera with him, and over the past
20 years he has built up a collection of photographs recording the fascinating
social history of the island.
Today almost all the 1700 patients he shares with his colleague, Dr Peter
Keiller, are acces-sible by car. The practice covers more than a hundred square
miles and is totally rural with the main consulting rooms in the health board
premises overlooking Lochmaddy Bay.
``This is a very scattered practice and we do a lot of work in homes,''
explains Dr Macleod.
Dr Macleod was born and brought up on the island where both his parents were
doctors. He trained in Glasgow and graduated in 1963. Before returning to the
Western Isles in 1973 he worked both in Aviemore and London where he met his
wife, Lorna, a nurse who comes from Bristol.
They have three children, Alasdair, currently studying marine science at
Glasgow University; daughter Beth doing community sport at Strathclyde
University, where she plays rugby for West of Scotland Ladies. She is also in
the Scotland A squad. Their youngest, Torquil, is still at school in Edinburgh.
``This is still a close-knit community,'' says Dr Macleod. ``And the number of
Macdonalds and Macleans can be confusing.''
Crofting, fishing for lobster, crab and prawn and seaweed harvesting plus some
employment with the local authority or the army base in Benbecula, provide the
main source of employment.
People live to a great age on the island with many in their eighties and
nineties. Because of the stable population living in one of the most
stress-free environments in the world, it provides a useful microcosm for
scientific studies. Among the ongoing projects are ones looking at certain
viruses, radioactivity and hypertension. The practice is responsible for
Lochmaddy Hospital which has 23 geriatric beds serving North Uist, Benbecula
and part of South Uist.
Daliburgh Hospital, some 40 miles south, has facilities for basic surgery. The
most common referrals are for hypertension and arthritis both of which are more
common than elsewhere.
The accident rate is very low because the crofters and fishermen are extremely
careful but if an emergency does arise they are flown to Glasgow or Stornoway
using the Scottish Air Ambulance Service or occasionally the coastguard
helicopter.
Dr Macleod is very active in the community and is a keen sailor, fisherman and
gardener as well as photographer. He is an authority on rural medicine and
writes frequently in the medical press on the subject. He is also a founder
member of the World Association of Rural Doctors and the Group for Rural and
Isolated Practitioners in Europe. Next year sees him heading for China in May
where he will be speaking at the first-ever world conference on rural medicine
in Shanghai.
He may well be remembered, however, for his role in recording the history of an
island and its people.

<TEXT>
THE estranged wife of Tory MP David Ashby told the High Court yesterday of the
night her husband pointed a knife at her and said: ``I'm going to kill you.''
Mrs Silvana Ashby, 52, giving evidence on behalf of the Sunday Times which the
MP is suing over allegations that he is homosexual, dropped in at his
constituency home in Ravenstone, Leicestershire, late at night in June this
year.
She found her 55-year-old husband, from whom she separated in November 1993,
sitting with retired civil servant, Mr Edward O'Byrne, in front of the
television.
She thought Mr O'Byrne was a constituent, until her husband said: ``How dare
you come here without being invited.''
She told Mr Justice Morland and the jury: ``I realised then that something
wasn't right.''
She looked at Mr O'Byrne and asked if he was a friend of Dr Ciaran Kilduff,
with whom the paper alleges Mr Ashby is having an affair.
``My husband went mad and flew at me. He grabbed me by the neck and knocked my
head against the wall by the radiator.
``He emptied my handbag. My cigarettes and lighter came out. He lit a
cigarette, took up a lighter, and picked up the corner of my skirt, saying,
`I'm going to burn you'.
``He put the cigarette close to my face and said, `I'm going to burn you'.''
Mrs Ashby said she went into the kitchen and her husband took a very long
knife, pointed it at her, and said: ``I'm going to kill you.''
She dialled 999 but he pulled the plug out of the phone and went at her again
with the knife.
``I was very, very worried. But when he said he was going to kill me, I said,
`Do it, do it, if you have the courage. I will be dead, but you will be in
prison forever'.''
Later, she said to her husband: ``My God, David, you make me sick. First of
all, you are going for young boys. Now you are going for old and crippled men.''
Mr Ashby, MP for Leicestershire North West, is claiming damages over
allegations that he shared a double bed with a man friend during a holiday in
Goa at the end of 1993.
Times Newspapers Ltd and former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil deny libel.
They accept that Mr Ashby did not holiday with a man in Goa but assert that he
was, and is, having an affair with 32-year-old Dr Kilduff.
Mr Ashby's counsel, Mr Geoffrey Shaw QC, said Mr Richard Hartley QC, for the
newspaper, claimed that nowadays no-one thought the worse of a man for being a
homosexual.
``Do you,'' he asked.
``Yes, I do,'' said Mrs Ashby.
The hearing was adjourned until Monday, when Mrs Ashby's cross-examination will
continue.

THE business community got its chance yesterday to put Labour under pressure
over its policies on enterprise and the constitution, but party leader Tony
Blair emerged from his audience with them in Edinburgh without a mark on him.
He won warm applause from a potentially sceptical gathering at the Edinburgh
International Conference when he concluded: ``This country cannot afford the
sterile ideological debates of the past. I believe this country needs a new
start.
``I want to do it with people such as yourselves. We may not always agree but
for heaven's sake let's keep the dialogue going because our country's future is
the most important thing.''
The members of the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce and Enterprise fell to the
Blair charm offensive with surprisingly little resistance. ``The message I want
to bring to the Scottish business community is a simple one,'' he said. ``My
party understands that companies in Scotland and the rest of Britain are
selling in an increasingly tough and competitive world. You need a Government
which backs, not blocks, your efforts.''
He pointed out that business people in London and the North of England were
increasingly warming to the idea of decentralisation and local decision-making
by strategic authorities in their own areas, and the Government's announcements
last week had effectively conceded that there was a problem.
While nationalists would tear Britain apart, he said: ``The economic advantages
of the union, the ties of common history, of family, of common interest are far
too strong to contemplate breaking apart. I would never agree to anything which
threatened the Union.''
Devolution, he said, would leave access to markets, the regulation of financial
services, and business taxation all unaffected, and it was nonsense to suggest
that the power to vary income tax by 3p would automatically be used.
Devolution in Europe had in many cases been an ``aid to prosperity - so too it
can be in Scotland if the opportunity is grasped.''
He told them that under the Conservatives the UK economy had become fragile, a
victim of under-investment, with a neglected infrastructure, too little
innovation and too many people out of work. This could be overcome by a
Government working in partnership with business and taking a more positive
attitude to Europe.
``An underclass isn't just a social evil, but an economic evil as well,'' he
said. ``It should be the task of any government to build greater social
cohesion. I believe we can have a good and decent society in which ambition is
matched by compassion.''
Mr Peter Stillwell, chief executive of Edinburgh Chamber, said Mr Blair had
brought a positive message to businessmen but concerns that Scotland could have
higher taxes than the rest of the UK had not been answered.
The audience had been strangely subdued, given the opportunity to question the
Labour leader. Although the question of potentially higher income tax was
raised the attack was never pressed home.
Businessman Donald Hardie expressed fear that Scots would demand ever greater
public spending beyond the ability of the 3p on income tax to cope. He said the
business community was electorally powerless.
But Mr Blair called this ``intellectually sloppy'' and said we lived in a
democracy where the will of the people had to be accepted, and that politicians
would compete for the votes of the Scottish people.
``I dare say the Conservatives will stand,'' he said.
``It would be odd to have a body with this sort of power that didn't have some
responsibility for its own finance. If you raise taxes you have to face the
electorate - that, after all, is democracy.''
Mr John Mackenzie, managing director of an Edinburgh electrical engineering
company, said later: ``He did not address the problems facing the Scottish
economy, the problems of having a separate government detached from England.
``I employ 100 people, I am concerned about the future.''

POLICE have rescued a British Embassy worker who had been held by Colombian
guerrillas for nearly four months.
Staff Sergeant Timothy Cowley, an assistant to the embassy's defence attache,
was kidnapped on August 12 while on a bird-watching expedition near El Toche,
100 miles west of Bogota.
Alberto Villamizar, who heads the government's anti-kidnapping efforts,
confirmed that police had rescued Cowley, but would not go into detail.
Early reports indicated that a Cowley had been kidnapped by a small left-wing
guerrilla band, the Jaime Bateman Cayon group. However Villamizar said the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC, were responsible.
It is the largest of several rebel bands which have been fighting the
government for more than 30 years.
Rebels often kidnap people and demand large ransoms for their release, but
Villamizar said that neither the British Government nor Cowley's family had
paid a ransom.-AP.

BOSNIA pledged today to remove all foreign Islamic fighters from the country as
required by the Dayton peace deal and to reassure Sarajevo Serbs that they will
be safe when their districts come under government control.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic gave the pledges to US peace envoy Richard
Holbrooke, chief architect of the deal agreed in Dayton, Ohio.
``We are very encouraged,'' Holbrooke said after talks with the Bosnian leader.
``President Izetbegovic assured us, most importantly, that all foreign elements
that are within the control of the (Muslim-Croat) Federation will be removed in
30 days or less.''
In the US, politicians have expressed fears at the presence in Bosnia of an
estimated 4000 foreign Islamic troops, known as mujahideen, who have been
fighting with the Muslim-led government army.
US officials are keen that the mujahideen depart promptly to minimise the
possibility of guerrilla attacks against the 60,000-strong Nato peace force,
one-third of them Americans.
Izetbegovic told reporters that his government would do more to reassure Serbs
across Bosnia of their safety, and would step up efforts to explain the Dayton
accord to those living in parts of Serb-held Sarajevo due to fall under
government control.
``Our opinion is, the Serb part of the population is not fully informed of the
provisions of the Dayton agreement,'' said Izetbegovic. ``They are influenced
by propaganda. We will be sending strong messages to the Serb population that
they will be fully secure.''
Serb residents have been demonstrating against the handover and threatening to
flee after burning their homes.
In Serb-held parts around Sarajevo the mood was one of pessimism and
resignation, as many civilians were reported to be preparing to quit their
homes if their areas come under government control.
``Everyone is preparing to leave, making plans, packing boxes. They're just
waiting for the police to let them drive out,'' said one civilian.
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic stressed there could be no renegotiation
of the Dayton deal and dismissed Serb protests against its terms as ``pure
theatre''.
Silajdzic rejected a suggestion for a blanket amnesty for all Serbs in the
city. However he stressed his government was keen to ensure the Dayton deal was
implemented ``because we can't win (if war resumes) and they can't win. It
would just go on and on.''
PATRICK BROGAN writes: The US Senate faces a difficult debate on Bosnia next
week and a vote on the president's policy on Wednesday, the day after the
Dayton agreement is to be formally signed in Paris.
It is likely that an agreed version will be approved. However in the House of
Representatives, 201 of its 435 members have signed a letter to the president
saying: ``We urge you not to send ground troops to Bosnia.''
Mr Clinton intends to do so - indeed, the first 1500 are already there -
whatever Congress rules, so the debate next week will have a different cast.
The administration, supported by Senator Bob Dole and other leading
Republicans, will argue that the president's decision has committed the United
States, and any attempt to reverse it, by Congress, will be severely damaging
to America's role in the world.

FOUR hundred women may help a Scots doctor discover why affluent women are more
likely to get breast cancer but poorer women are more likely to die from it.
Dr Una Macleod will carry out her research in Greater Glasgow, where the
population of almost a million includes areas with some of the best, and some
of the worst, health profiles in Europe.
Yesterday, Dr Macleod, who is based at Glasgow University's department of
general practice, acknowledged that many of the women in the study will be dead
before it is completed.
Her research will involve women who developed breast cancer in 1992-93 from
across the spectrum of affluence and deprivation.
As many as 20% of the sample will have died before they are subject to detailed
study and the information Dr Macleod needs will come from their case notes.
``I will be talking to the rest but, by definition, I will be talking to some
women who aren't going to survive at the end of the day,'' she added. ``We
won't know which, because breast cancer is so unpredictable. Even after five
years, we can't be absolutely certain it has been beaten for good.''
Why affluent women should be more prone to breast cancer is not known but diet
and reproductive patterns have been suspected. (Starting a family early reduces
the risk.)
Dr Harry Burns, director of public health for Greater Glasgow Health Board,
told The Herald earlier this year: ``More than half of all women who live in an
affluent area and develop breast cancer will survive. Despite receiving
identical treatment, more than half of all women with breast cancer living in
poor areas will die.''
Whether women in affluent areas do, in fact, receive a different standard of
care to those in deprived areas is one of the issues being investigated by Dr
Macleod, who holds the Cancer Research Campaign's research training fellowship
in primary care oncology, the first of its kind in the UK.
The National Lottery is paying the #205,000 cost of the research, which will
also aim to determine the ideal balance of care between hospital and GP care
for women with cancer and whether women from deprived areas have additional
needs for psycho-social support.
The most obvious possibility - that women from deprived areas are in a more
advanced stage of disease before they seek treatment - has already been
discounted, even though women from lower social classes are less likely to be
screened.
``We know from a previous study in Glasgow that women in deprived areas don't
present any later or turn up with nastier cancers,'' said Dr Macleod:
``Contrary to expectations, when they presented they were from a pathological
base that was roughly equivalent. If that had not been the case, the answer
would be relatively simple.
``The Thames Cancer Registery looked at a very similar thing to the Glasgow
study and proved exactly the same thing. They were looking at larger numbers
and came out with the same results.
``So it is nothing to do with time of presentation; that leaves you with
biological factors, lifestyle or patterns of care. There are not a lot of
things we can change but if we detect something different in terms of the
package of care, we can change it - that is why it appeals to me.
``Even if we prove there is no difference in that respect then at least it
points us in another direction. Presumably it is linked up to life-style in
some way, no doubt some hereditary factors could be involved, but that is so
complex.''
``There is no doubt that affluent women are more likely to get it. It is a
significant difference.''
The role of GPs is particularly important since breast cancer is a disease that
tends not to entail prolonged periods in hospital. Questionnaires have been
sent to family doctors in Greater Glasgow, Forth Valley, Lanarkshire, Ayrshire
and Arran, and Argyll and Clyde, and the replies are already coming in to help
form a benchmark.
Dr Macleod and her colleagues will also look at the educational needs of GPs
dealing with breast cancer but diagnosis is unlikely to be the crucial issue.
Dr Macleod said: ``Nowadays, if a woman goes to her GP with a suspected lump on
her breast, it will be treated seriously. Even if he doesn't think it is
anything serious, it will be checked.''
q.Women are three times more likely to develop breast cancer if they encounter
severely stressful events like bereavement, new research suggests.
Scientists at King's College Hospital, London, found that about half the women
they studied who developed cancer had experienced at least one severely
stressful life event in the previous five years.

THE first black Army trooper to ride beside the Queen on state occasions is
considering quitting, it was disclosed yesterday.
But former postman Mark Campbell has refused to make an official complaint of
racism.
The Ministry of Defence confirmed that allegations of racial abuse were being
investigated.
It is understood that when Trooper Campbell, from Sedgley, near Wolverhampton,
was interviewed by the Army's Special Investigations Branch, he said he would
not make an official complaint ``at this time''.
The Army bent the rules to allow a man of his age into the ranks of the
Household Cavalry mounted regiment earlier this year.
But its faith was well rewarded when the 28-year-old won the Jackson Shield for
being the best turned-out cavalryman during his 20-week training.
``When he passed out on August 11, he was clearly a well-trained and good
soldier,'' said an Army source.
At the time, Trooper Campbell said: ``Race should not be an issue; it's no
problem to me. I'm just happy to serve.''
He was immediately thrown into ceremonial duties and made his first public
appearance during the VJ Day commemorations as one of 18 troopers escorting the
Queen.
However, he faced two serious problems - the strain of being the solitary black
face in the Household Cavalry and a serious skin complaint caused by the
traditional plumed helmet and metal chin strap.
He received medical treatment for the rash in October but it did not improve
and that is when the problems began.
As he could no longer take part in ceremonial duties, he was transferred to the
regiment's training section at Windsor. Clearly unhappy to be away from London,
he asked his commanding officer if he could be returned to the capital.
It was explained there was no job available for him in London as he could no
longer take part in duties requiring him to wear the regimental helmet.
Trooper Campbell then made accusations that one of the reasons he was unhappy
at Windsor was because people were using racially abusive words.
The CO immediately called in the Special Investigations Branch to interview
Trooper Campbell, who explained the strain he felt at being a ``novelty'' to
the regiment and the pressure from media attention.
However, he admitted he had never been picked on or harmed in any way and
refused to make a complaint of racial abuse.
The Army is keen to keep Trooper Campbell, who still has two years of his
three-year commission to run, and he may be offered a different post in the
regiment or even a switch to another unit.
``It is a messy situation,'' said an Army source. ``He is obviously a good
soldier and it is a great pity it has turned out this way.''
Accusations of racial abuse surfaced in the black newspaper The Voice, which
quotes a friend of the trooper as saying: ``If people had to go through what
I'm going through, they wouldn't hang on for a week.
``When you have to make a decision between hanging on in there and your life,
what are you going to choose?''
The Ministry of Defence said: ``Trooper Campbell has not been kicked out of the
Army. Allegations of racial abuse are being investigated and, if proven,
disciplinary action will of course be taken.''
An Army spokesman said: ``We condemn all forms of racism. The Services are
committed to a range of measures to increase ethnic minority recruiting.''
The Prince of Wales has played an active part to boost the recruitment of
blacks to elite regiments.
A spokeswoman for St James's Palace, while refusing to comment on individual
cases, said: ``It is well known that the prince called together a group
representing the regiments and the recruitment side to try to get more people
from ethnic minorities into that part of the Army.''
The prince, she said, still believed in the need for progress: ``He has been
following progress with some interest and it is something that he is still
keenly interested in.''

THE CIA now concedes that throughout the 1980s, at least, it supplied false
estimates of Soviet military strength to the American Government.
Soviet agents and moles within the CIA convinced the agency that the Soviet
Union was far more powerful than it was, and the Americans therefore spent more
on defence than was needed.
The director of the agency, John Deutch, made a report to Congress on the
ill-effects of Aldrich Ames, the CIA official who worked for the KGB from 1985
onwards. The report was released today.
Its most paradoxical conclusion is that since the CIA was misled about Soviet
strength, believing that the USSR was a rapidly increasing threat to the West
when in fact it was in the process of disintegration, it induced the US to
build up its armed forces extravagantly. This, in turn, led the desperate
Soviet government to try to match President Reagan's military expansion, and
hastened the USSR's collapse.
This was not what the KGB had in mind when it fed false information to the
unsuspecting CIA. There was a hot debate here during the 1980s on whether to
believe the CIA's alarming reports.
The hawks believed that the USSR was spending 15% or even 20% of a high GNP on
arms, and therefore demanded enormous sums for the Pentagon.
In fact, the CIA was wrong both about the amount of money the Soviet armed
forces were getting and the strength of the Soviet economy. Partly for
ideological reasons - he saw the USSR as an ``evil empire'' and a danger to the
United States - Reagan believed the hawks.
That, in turn, sharply increased the budget deficit and the national debt, a
development that has profound effects on American politics to this day.
The Deutch report specifies ways in which Ames damaged the United States. He
betrayed a long series of American agents to the KGB, and the methods of
espionage and running double-agents. He also helped the Soviets provide
disinformation to the agency.
The CIA came to doubt the accuracy of some of the reports it was receiving from
its supposed agents, suspecting them of being double agents, but all the same
passed on their claims to the president, Pentagon, and state department. The
Senate committee's two leaders both denounced the agency today for knowingly
passing on false information.
Certainly if it did so, presumably because of the dominant ideological mind-set
in Washington at the time, it contributed to the grotesque over-spending by the
Pentagon of the Reagan years and to the present political crisis over balancing
the budget.
q.Russian submarines have shadowed US missile subs and aircraft carriers off
the east and west coasts of the United States in recent months, the US Navy
said today. Officials said the surprising flurry of activity showed a
commitment by cash-pressed Moscow to a hi-tech submarine fleet.

CHIEF Constable Leslie Sharp of Strathclyde yesterday promised the region's
drugs culture that his 7000-plus force would still be sitting on top of them,
although the UK's most successful drugs purge officially has ended.
Operation Eagle has swooped on 6000 people who were charged with drug offences
in the last 180 days. Drugs worth #5m at certified street value were seized,
close on #1m of that in the last week.
Almost 14,000 people were searched, 2673 were detained under the influence of
drugs, 40 guns and nearly #500,000 in cash were recovered. Possibly the most
important figure, however, was that police received 11,000 intelligence reports
from the public.
Assistant Chief Constable John Welsh told a seminar in Glasgow that previous
thinking which had concentrated on the targeting of a handful of Mr Bigs was
wrong.
Eagle had confirmed that the street drug dealers were major players and should
be the key targets. Despite its enormous impact, said Mr Welsh, it had also
confirmed that Strathclyde was awash with drugs.

<HEADLINE>Ebola virus strikes again Liberian has disease that killed 250 in Zaire</HEADLINE>

Abidjan, Friday
A NEW case of the deadly Ebola virus has been found in the Ivory Coast, the
World Health Organisation said tonight.
The patient is a 25-year-old Liberian man who was admitted to a hospital last
week near Tabou, a coastal city on the Liberian-Ivory Coast border.
Tests carried out at the Pasteur Institute in Paris confirmed the disease.
The Ebola fever, whose symptoms include massive internal bleeding, killed 250
people earlier this year in an outbreak around the town of Kikwit in Zaire.
The fear is that the disease could easily spread in the Ivory Coast city of
Tabou, which is jammed with Liberians who fled across the border during their
country's six-year civil war.
Tabou itself is an overcrowded, dirty city, and the villages around it are
little more than refugee camps with dozens of people sharing cramped shacks.
This is the first case discovered since the Kikwit outbreak was officially
declared over on August 24. WHO was told of it on Wednesday and sent a team of
experts to the area within 24 hours.
The French aid agency Doctors Without Borders, the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees, and the Ivory Coast Health Ministry were today all working with the
WHO to prevent a fresh epidemic, the government said.
``The patient's condition is clinically good,'' said a senior health ministry
official. He said the man was under observation in a tiny village called Gozon,
near Tabou.
Ebola, a virus named after a river in northern Zaire where it first appeared in
1976, kills by attacking internal organs and causing massive bleeding. It is
spread by direct contact with infected blood or body fluids and has no known
cure.
Scientists suspect it has a natural host, probably an animal like a monkey,
which under certain conditions can pass it on to humans.
Microbiologists trying to find out where it comes from and how to cure it say
Ebola remains a difficult virus to detect, trace, and fight.
``We have to recognise that this virus is a very rare event,'' said Graham
Lloyd, an expert in Ebola at the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research
at Porton Down, Wiltshire.
Lloyd said his laboratory was trying to find a way to diagnose Ebola infection
quickly. The Ivory Coast case seemed to involve a new strain of the virus. ``We
want to understand whether this strain is as virulent,'' he said.
A cure would be a long way off because Ebola presented the same challenges as
many viruses do - they do not trigger the body's immune system properly, and
mutate as fast as the body can manufacture antibodies to put up a fight.
Any cure would have to involve an approach similar to that used by researchers
battling Aids, influenza, and the cold - tackling how the virus replicates
itself and moves in the body.-AP/Reuter.

MORE than one killer could have been involved in the gangland execution of the
three drug dealers shot dead in a lane in Essex.
Police confirmed last night that ballistic evidence proved that more than one
weapon was involved in the shootings.
The three men were murdered in an attack typical of gangland vendettas. The
victims appear to have been lured to their deaths on the pretext of a
clandestine meeting to set up a lucrative drug deal.
Police yesterday confirmed that the victims were known drug dealers, but added
that there was no connection between them and Leah Betts, who collapsed on her
eighteenth birthday and died after taking an ecstasy tablet.
The three were well known in the area for pushing ecstasy. Tabloid newspapers
were quick to link the killings with Leah's death.
The bodies of Craig Rolfe, Patrick Tate, and Anthony Tucker were found at about
8am on Thursday in a Range Rover on an isolated snow-covered farm track at the
village of Rettendon, near Chelmsford.
Detective Ivan Dibley, leading the hunt, said: ``There is nothing to suggest
that they distributed drugs to Leah Betts or her associates at a nightclub in
Basildon.''
All three men were shot twice through the head at close range. One was also
shot once in the torso.
Rolfe's girlfriend of seven years, Donna Jaggers, with whom he had a
six-year-old child, wept as she told a news conference: ``I would just like
anyone who was with them, who knows anything about what happened to them, or if
they    saw anything, to come forward. We need all the help we can get.''
Mr Dibley said the men were ``quite high up'' the drug-dealing hierarchy. They
were, he said, ``about five out on 10'' on a scale of importance.
Asked what he thought might have happened, Mr Dibley said: ``There could be a
power struggle, or there could be a double-cross which has taken place. It
might be that somebody has owed money and hasn't paid their bill.''

THE new East of Scotland Public Water Authority was warned yesterday that Fife
Council would be playing a watchdog role over its actions once it took over
responsibility for delivering the services.
The Labour leader of the new council, Councillor Alex Rowley, said it was
determined to ensure the public got good value for money. ``We don't want a
Yorkshire Water situation in Fife where the public are paying through the nose
for an inadequate service.''
The regional council, he claimed, was handing over a well-developed
infrastructure and plans for essential future investment to the new public
authority next April. A total of #20m had been invested in improving water and
sewerage infrastructure in Fife.
``We want assurances that the water authority will maintain and, where needed,
increase this level of investment,'' said Councillor Rowley.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth has already pledged that water rates will
not be allowed to rise by more than 6% next year.

THE Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth was accused yesterday of playing ``silly
and futile games'' when he made his recent criticisms of new council structures
as the war of words between the Scottish Office and Cosla resumed yesterday.
In England, Environment Secretary John Gummer did not involve himself in the
structure and operation of individual councils, Cosla's Labour president
Rosemary McKenna told a seminar organised by the Unit for the Study of
Government at Edinburgh University.
She added: ``Cosla doesn't go around criticising the internal structure of the
Scottish Office. That is none of our business and it's equally none of the
Secretary of State's business to criticise the structure of individual
councils.''
If Mr Forsyth was serious about his commitment to devolution and to a new
relationship with local government, he should stop behaving in this way.
The Scottish Secretary had claimed some of the new councils were creating too
large committee structures to allow the payment of special responsibility
allowances to as many members as possible.
Mrs McKenna also warned, in the wake of the financial settlement for local
government next year, that the dawn of the unitary councils would be marked by
the prospect of poorer and more limited services.
She compared the 0.8% increase in spending allowed in Scotland with the 3.1% in
England.
The smaller provision, she claimed, underlined the Treasury's strategy of
trying to bring spending in Scotland into line with south of the border.
Why should it be assumed, she asked, that the right level of spending was the
English one. This was the level which had made 10,000 teachers redundant and
put one million school children in classes of more than 30.
The Scottish Secretary should not underestimate the degree of attachment which
the people of Scotland had to the level of their public services, Mrs McKenna
warned.

MILDER weather will return to Scotland by tonight, according to Glasgow Weather
Centre. However, the respite will be brief, as temperatures are set to drop
again on Monday.
Scotland will have cloud and rain in the far north and north-west today. The
rest of Scotland will be dry with sunny spells, once overnight fog patches
disperse.
``The Western Isles and the north-west have escaped     the worst of the cold
weather but everywhere except the Borders should see a rise in temperature
over the weekend,'' said a Glasgow Weather Centre spokesman.
``The Borders can expect to see more frost but after the weekend it will be
getting slightly colder again for the rest of us.''
After the mildest autumn on record, Scotland has spent the last few days
shivering with the first taste of the cold winter months ahead.
The south of England took the brunt of the bad weather yesterday, with parts of
the coastal region being turned into a ``skating rink'',  according to the
Automobile Association.
The London Weather Centre said yesterday that its forecast up to next Thursday
predicted no more snow but a spokesman added that ``beyond that, we don't
know''.
Meanwhile, skiers are looking forward to the prospects of another bumper season
on the Scottish slopes.
A smattering of early snow is covering the five Scottish resorts but, as yet,
there is not enough to get the tows running over the weekend.

<TEXT>
SCIENTISTS were anxiously awaiting today the first transmission of data from
the Galileo space probe, which they hope will be a key to unlock the secrets of
Jupiter.
Meanwhile, as Galileo spent its first day orbiting the solar system's largest
planet, scientists were studying telemetry sent by the spacecraft on its orbit
trajectory.
``We're in almost perfect orbit so any changes will be minimal,'' said lab
spokesman Jurrie Vanderwood.
The first data from Galileo's probe, which plunged into the heart of Jupiter's
gaseous mass last night, were expected on Sunday.
The data transmission, which will consist of the first 43 minutes of the
75-minute transmission from the probe to its mother ship, will continue until
Wednesday.
It will be repeated twice more next month, when Earth and Jupiter will no
longer be blocked by the sun. Transmission of the full 75 minutes will be
completed in February.
One space scientist said information gleaned by the probe could be ``the most
amazing weather report we've ever had''.
The probe passed through clouds of water, helium, oxygen, and nitrogen and
endured hurricane-like winds of 200mph and violent lighting storms as it passed
through Jupiter's atmosphere.
The mission of the 746lb probe has been likened to a journey to the beginning
of time because scientists believe the information it has gathered could unlock
the secrets of how the solar system was formed.
Wesley Huntress, Associate Administrator for Space Science at Nasa, said
Jupiter, in many ways, was a miniature solar system in itself.
``Within Jupiter's constellation of diverse moons, its intense magnetic field,
and its swarms of dust and charged particles, the Galileo mission should
uncover new clues about how the sun and the planets formed, and about how they
continue to interact and evolve,'' he said.
``Right now, we can still only imagine the discoveries that will flow from
Galileo as it travels for months in this most unusual and unearthly
environment.''
During the next two years Galileo will make 11 orbits of the giant planet,
which is 318 times larger than Earth. The spacecraft will have close encounters
with three of Jupiter's largest moons, Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa. It will
also photograph Io from medium range on each orbit.
The mission is set to end in two years' time, when Galileo will make its
farewell transmission before plunging into the Jovian atmosphere and burning up.
q.Fragments of an old Soviet satellite, some weighing more than 440lb, will
fall to Earth tomorrow or on Monday and could hit land, Russian space officials
say.-Reuter.

PLANS for a #20m National Garden for Scotland were revealed yesterday by TV
gardener Jim McColl.
The Beechgrove Garden co-presenter said the proposal, to create a permanent
centre of exellence for Scotland's amateur gardeners at Plean Country Park,
near Stirling, had won backing from key Government bodies and quangos.
Scottish Enterprise, Forth Valley Enterprise, Scottish Natural Heritage, the
Scottish Tourist Board, and Stirling District Council will meet next week to
consider a consultants' report on the scheme, which could create hundreds of
jobs and attract thousands of visitors a year.
An outline bid has already been put forward to the National Lottery Millennium
Fund to secure a large proportion of the funds needed.
Mr McColl said yesterday: ``What's needed is a centre to serve the amateur
gardeners of Scotland. People are always talking about the lack of information.
You buy a packet of seeds and it says on the back: `Sow in open ground from
March to May.' It doesn't say it's March in Cornwall and May in Caithness. It's
relevant information that people need.''
Plean was selected from more than 16 sites.
Meanwhile, BBC Scotland's Beechgrove Garden, which has more than half a million
viewers weekly, has won the Garden Writers Guild award for best TV gardening
programme in 1995.

<RECORDNO>974979158</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A STABLE owner was convicted yesterday of assaulting a woman with a horse's ear.
Frank Carberry, 36, was found guilty of throwing the severed ear at Mrs Anne
McConnell on June 12, breach of the peace, and a bail offence.
Sheriff Kenneth McIver, fining him #500, described the incident as an ``assault
of a contemptuous nature meant to cause hurt and upset''.
Glasgow Sheriff Court heard that after Mrs McConnell's favourite horse, Fallon,
a thoroughbred chestnut mare, died of grass colic in a field, an ear was sliced
off.
She later received a telephone call from Carberry asking her to collect what
she believed was documentation from a vet relating to the death.
However, when she arrived with a friend, Miss Carol Tracy, at Carberry's
smallholding on Wester Boghead Road, Lenzie, he pulled the ear from a polythene
bag and threw it at her.
She said Carberry had then shouted: ``Here's your f******
documentation.......you'll get the rest of the horse through the post.''
The sheriff added: ``You went out of your way to cause upset to persons who
were deeply involved in horses......''
The court was told that there was a legal wrangle over debts owed to Carberry's
friend, Mr Charles Swann, relating to rental of a field and stables for a
string of trekking horses run by Mrs McConnell and Miss Tracy.
The women admitted that they had previously breached a court order by removing
horses from a field.
Carberry, who said Mrs McConnell owed him money for horse feed, accused her of
dumping the horse's ear on his doorstep.
He claimed he had simply handed the ear to her and suggested she had rubbed the
ear on her jumper to produce a bloodstain to back up her story.
Sheriff McIver said the issue was one of credibility and told Carberry, a
father of four, that he found the Crown evidence preferable and acceptable,
leaving him in no doubt that he       had thrown the ear at Mrs McConnell.

<TEXT>
FORMER Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd yesterday rounded on Tory right-wingers'
demands for greater tax cuts, funded by massive spending reductions.
He warned that failure to back Chancellor Kenneth Clarke would lead to
electoral defeat.
In an outspoken attack which threatens to renew Tory in-fighting over Mr
Clarke's handling of the economy, Mr Hurd said Conservatives would ``certainly
not win'' the next election if the party ``rushed to unreality''.
The Chancellor would need the help of all active Conservatives, Mr Hurd said.
The alternative was not just the election of a Labour government, but the
``collapse under excessive pressure of one or other of the main pillars of our
essential services''.
Mr Hurd told Tory activists in north Oxford: ``A Government which slashed
blindly at public services, pleading some abstract moral imperative or invoking
a political need to put clear water between itself and its opponents, will not
regain sympathy but forfeit it.''
Taxation was too high, he conceded, but only among the ``unreal fevers'' of
Westminster would it seem sensible medicine to sack more teachers in the cause
of cutting taxes even more deeply.
``It is no use blaming the electorate for wanting it both ways. They expect
Government to strike a balance between reasonable taxation and reasonable
public services.''
Mr Hurd's intervention followed sharp criticism of Mr Clarke by senior Tory MPs
after poll evidence showed the Budget had made the Government even more
unpopular.
Mr David Evans, a member of the executive of the influential 1922 committee of
Tory backbenchers said Mr Clarke had ``no nose'' for politics, and Sir Rhodes
Boyson, who also sits on the 1922 executive, said there should have been bigger
cuts in public spending to allow a greater reduction in direct and indirect
taxation.
Meanwhile, in a speech yesterday to Tories in Tiverton, Devon, Treasury Chief
Secretary William Waldegrave said Mr Clarke's Budget paved the way for more tax
cuts.
Mr Kynoch said the centre provided the opportunity for technicians working in
the more traditional industries to upgrade their skills so they could move into
electronics.
All 15 trainees who completed their course this year had gone on to jobs,
mostly in local electronics companies, but the course had been so successful
that two more were now in progesss.
Lets, he said, provided training for unemployed adults in electronics. In
partnership with LEEL, it had helped to train 1000 jobless people for entry
into electronics companies.
Its success rate of trainees going on to secure jobs was 70%.

<HEADLINE>MP accuses judiciary of `mad judge disease'</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A TORY right-winger yesterday blamed ``liberal, socialist-minded judges and
magistrates'' for rising crime levels and called for the reintroduction of
national service and corporal punishment to deter young thugs.
In an astonishing Commons outburst, David Evans, MP for Welwyn and Hatfield,
complained that some of the judiciary was suffering from ``mad judge disease''
and demanded castration of rapists.
He also suggested, in a debate on crime, that judges should be paid a
percentage of the fines they imposed to encourage them to give sentences ``that
fit the crime''.
He said it might be a good idea to double the #10 Christmas bonus for
pensioners who protected their property by shooting burglars.
``The rise in crime is down to a succession of liberal, socialist-minded judges
and magistrates who have lacked the nerve to give sentences that fit the crime.
``They have failed the Government, failed the police and most of all they have
failed the citizens of this country.
``They criticise the victim for not taking enough precautions and they counsel
and cosset the villains,'' said Mr Evans who was a leading backer of John
Redwood in the Tory leadership contest. Mr Evans said prison worked in
deterring criminals. ``One more scumbag behind bars is one less rampaging
around the streets.''
He called for measures to tackle ``pathetic parents'' who cannot control their
children.
If fines against the parents did not work ``we could put them behind bars with
their children.
``This will give the family some quality time together to reflect on the values
of responsibility and discipline.''
In schools, he said, teachers should be given powers to take on troublesome
teenagers.
``Some children need ticking off, some need a clip round the ear and some need
a bloody good hiding.
``How about the reintroduction of national service? Young people need to learn
the values of discipline, teamwork and a deference to authority.''
Junior Home Office Minister Timothy Kirkhope said Mr Evans had ``his own
particular way of putting things across'' and added: ``I cannot see that some
of those things he is suggesting might immediately be part of Government
plans.''
However, Home Office Minister David Maclean said prisoners should work for
proper pay to stop their families being a burden on the state and pay income
tax.
He was responding to Lady Olga Maitland, MP for Sutton and Cheam, who said
during a Commons debate on crime that jail regimes should be ``relevant'' and
``rigorous'' and prisoners should not watch television, but should do work to
earn their keep.
Mr Maclean said he wanted prisoners to do a proper day's work and pay income
tax.
``I am one of those who believes that if they are actually doing a proper day's
work in prison, rather than sitting round their cells, then it makes sense to
pay them a proper wage and, first of all, deduct money to send to their wives
and families, put money in for a nest egg.
``And, also, I want prisoners to face the same penalty the rest of us face:
it's called income tax.
``And I see no point in them being cushioned from that and their wives and
families being on the state, when, if they were doing a proper day's work in
prison and getting better pay rather than pocket money, then they could
actually have those deductions made.''
He said there were pilot studies looking at improved work regimes ``so
prisoners are doing better things than making mail bags''.

A MAN whose lover was killed by a foot-long knife which he was holding was
cleared of responsibility for her death at the High Court in Perth yesterday.
Mr John Burns, 38, denied murdering Ms Marie McIndoer, 35, by slashing her neck
in the flat they shared at Whitevale Street, Camlachie, Glasgow.
Lord Clyde acquitted him after upholding a submission by defence counsel John
Morris that he had no case to answer.
Neighbour Peter Kerr, 41, who was visiting the couple, said that a happy
Saturday evening ended with blood spurting from Ms McIndoer's neck after the
accused unexpectedly produced a chef's knife. Police were called and Mr Burns
was found holding a towel to her neck.
As paramedics tended her, a constable said Mr Burns told him: ``It was an
accident. She walked into it. Look, I love her. The knife is under the cooker.''
During a taped interview, played to the jury, Mr Burns was heard to repeat his
claim that the wound was sustained accidentally.
Then he was heard to break down, sobbing loudly when a detective told him that
Ms McIndoer had died soon after admission to Glasgow Royal Infirmary.

Eight killed in
shop rampage
NEW YORK: A gunman went on the rampage at a Harlem clothing store yesterday,
then barricaded himself inside and set a fire that engulfed the building. Eight
people died and five were injured, three critically.
The gunman's body was found in the store with seven others nearby, who police
said had died from breathing smoke. First reports said the incident was a
bungled robbery, but police said the incident could have been part of a
landlord-tenant dispute.
Lama at risk
NEW DELHI: The Indian Government has been asked to tighten security for the
Dalai Lama after the arrest of three people suspected of trying to spy on the
Tibetan spiritual leader. Himachal Pradesh state has asked for a concrete wall
around the Dalai Lama's house in the Himalayan town of Dharamsala, where he
lives in exile, and a bullet-proof car.
Hunch hangings
LAGOS: Three Nigerians, including a 75-year-old herbalist, were sentenced to
hang for strangling a 15-year-old hunchback and cutting off his hunch for use
in a potion. The judge told the herbalist, his 25-year-old son, and a male
relative that their crime was barbaric and they deserved no mercy.
`Zombie' riot
DURBAN: Drunken youths chopped up coffins with axes and stabbed corpses in a
bid to stop the funeral of 10 ``bewitched'' children killed in a road crash in
South Africa. They believed witches had substituted zombies for their bodies,
reported police who had to fire in the air to disperse the youths.
Leader sits up
ATHENS: Ailing Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou was sitting up in his
hospital chair for the first time in two weeks yesterday, following a
tracheotomy operation to ease his breathing. A government spokesman said he
could go home this month, but the 76-year-old leader is still on life-support
machines. Colleagues are calling for a successor while the press is urging him
to quit politics for his own good.
Nobel delight
STOCKHOLM: Irish poet Seamus Heaney will receive the 1995 Nobel literature
prize from King Carl XVI Gustav in Sweden tomorrow. ``For once in my life, I am
permitting myself the luxury of walking on air,'' he said on arriving in
Stockholm this week. In a separate ceremony, British physicist Joseph Rotblat,
87, will receive the Peace Prize for his efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons.
Siege over
MUNICH: Police in Munich ended their second hostage crisis in under nine hours
yesterday, shooting dead a man who threatened to kill his girlfriend and a
policeman. Commandos stormed a bank on Thursday night and rescued three
hostages held by a gunman, all unharmed.
King rests
DUBAI: King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has been discharged from a Riyadh hospital
after a week's treatment for what US officials said was a stroke. The Saudi
court said his younger half-brother Crown Prince Abdullah would assume some of
his duties while the 73-year-old king recuperated.
Killer jumbo
CAIRO: An elephant in Cairo Zoo trampled to death her keeper as he fed her
breakfast, a newspaper reported. Nadia, 32, picked up the 64-year-old man,
threw him to the ground, and trod on him. Keepers said the elephant had
recently been depressed and had attacked other keepers.
Jackson `stable'
NEW YORK: Michael Jackson was in serious but stable condition in hospital after
treatment for an irregular heartbeat which caused him to faint during a
rehearsal on Wednesday night. The pop superstar was being treated for
dehydration, gastro-enteritis and heart, kidney, and liver irregularities
caused by an electrolyte imbalance, his doctors said. His estranged sister
LaToya, however, told a newspaper it was a publicity move.
Ear eaten
FORT WAYNE: A man bit off another man's ear during a bar-room brawl, then
swallowed it when police confronted him. Stevon Sutton still had the ear in his
mouth when police arrived but refused to spit it out. He sucked it in and out
of his mouth several times before swallowing it, police said. Sutton, 32, was
charged with battery and criminal recklessness.

A LEADING union official told Scots lawyers yesterday that the postal workers'
strike showed it was time to change employment law.
Mr Bill Speirs, Scottish TUC deputy general secretary, said the Government's
employment law had driven the postal workers into taking unofficial strike
action. Yet the Royal Mail, in order to get the strike resolved, had to deal
with the workers' union, even though the action was unofficial.
The danger was, he pointed out, that if a deal could not be done with the union
then the Royal Mail would have no-one left to deal with.
He told the Law Society of Scotland's industrial law group in Crieff yesterday:
``As the unofficial action escalated, the management continued to negotiate
with the union - the only people they could negotiate with.
``As Royal Mail losses mounted to #10m, realisation was dawning on senior
management that they not only had to do a deal with the union officials, they
had to do a deal which was good enough to stick with the members since the
union no longer had any power of disciplinary action because of legislation
introduced by the Tories four years ago.
``The workforce agreed to go back to work on the basis of the deal which the
union had done. But what would have been the consequences if they had refused
to accept their union officials' advice? With whom would Royal Mail bosses have
negotiated, in the critical period running up to Christmas.
Mr Speirs argued that the dispute showed that even some employers may now wish
a shift in the balance of power in employment law back towards the employees.

HE doesn't look like the popular idea of a missionary, this burly,
down-to-earth Scot with unruly hair and tattooed forearms. Nor does he accept
the old stereotyped missionary's role, that of simply saving souls and bringing
enlightenment to the natives. The Rev Brian Attwell follows a much tougher
route - he believes in practical Christianity and he practises it in one of the
Third World's poorest countries.
He has paid a heavy price, suffering hepatitis, dysentery, angina, septicamia,
and heart attacks. After the most recent attack he was warned he had only three
months to live unless he underwent emergency surgery.
Attwell, aged 50, and his wife Betty, as dedicated as he is, have shouldered a
daunting burden. But they know there is no turning back - some 30 children
rescued from the streets of poverty-stricken Peru depend on them for survival.
In the Hogar San Andres, a rambling old house at Chosica, just outside Lima,
the Peruvian capital, they shelter a collection of innocents whose only crime
was to be born. Though one would never guess it from their bright, shining
faces, each of these children, aged from two upwards, comes from a tragic
background.
Crippled Raul saw his parents killed by terrorists. Pancho was found on a
rubbish-dump. Sweet-faced Anne Maried, aged five, had a drug-addict mother.
Pepe Lucho was thrown on the street when his foster parents learned he was
retarded. Henry, an eight-year-old with a flashing smile, had alcoholic parents.
They are a few of the countless children struggling to survive on the streets
of Latin America. Their parents have disappeared, cannot support them, or have
abandoned them because they are handicapped - in a poor family with a dozen or
so mouths to feed there is no room for the helpless. Unwanted children beg or
steal on the streets, prey to drug traffickers and latter-day Fagins.
Birth control is not common in Peru, a Catholic country of ``macho'' values,
although the authoritarian President Alberto Fujimori is trying to promote it.
And the country has virtually no public safety-net for the destitute and
desperate.
The situation worsened over the past 10 yars when Indians fled terrorism and
hunger in the Andes and flocked to Lima. The Peruvian elite, of mostly Spanish
ancestry and notoriously racist, has little enthusiasm for helping these
``inferior'' descendants of the Incas.
So how did a former bricklayer and heating engineer from Inverness become
involved in their troubles?
There were two turning-points in Brian Attwell's life. The first came when he
was working in the Inverness Royal Infirmary (now closed) as a nurse. There he
met and married Betty, from Peru, who was training as a nurse specialising in
caring for children with special needs.
Then, when he was 30, Attwell, an atheist although he had been brought up a
Methodist, became a believer again. Even now he cannot explain exactly how it
happened.
``I can't say I saw a vision or that anything dramatic occurred,'' he says.
``One day I realised I hadn't done much with my life and that there has to be
something more to our existence. Within six months I decided to take holy
orders, was enrolled in a bible college, and four years later I was ordained in
the Free Baptist Church.''
He and Betty gave themselves one year to raise enough money to go to Peru. They
formed a mission in London to raise funds and in 1983 they flew to Peru on
one-way tickets. There they worked to help the poor in Lima's so-called Pueblos
Jovenes (young towns), grim, dusty slums thrown up in the bleak desert around
Lima.
Attwell dreamed of founding an orphanage and the opportunity came when a former
retirement home for British expatriates, run by the British Benevolent Society,
became available.
``We didn't have the money, #20,000 payable
Continued on Page 14
Continued from Page 13
over three years, but somehow it came in,'' recalls Attwell. ``I never know
where the money is coming from to carry on - it's hand-to-mouth. But somehow
when the need is there the cash appears.''
Thus it was with the latest acquisition, a dilapidated mansion adjoining the
Hogar San Andres (literally St Andrew's Home). It was far too costly to buy,
but an English benefactor raised some cash and lengthy haggling reduced the
price to #16,000.
Now the Attwells and their helpers, including unpaid volunteers, are labouring
to renovate the building. Once finished, it will have two dormitories, a
medical clinic for the children and street people, and a day centre for the
children of poor families.
While supervising the work, Attwell admits: ``It would be much easier just to
build a church and do normal missionary work, trying to win converts. Instead
this is a 24-hours-a-day job. I'm in it now and can't back out. All those kids
depend on us. Without this place, they would either be dead or living like
animals on the street.''
Christian teaching at the orphanage is by example rather than indoctrination
and Sunday is a normal working day. ``We give the kids Sunday school and try to
raise them in a Christian way but without any brainwashing. I see our work as a
form of practical Christianity,'' says Attwell.
The youngsters learn to help one another and those capable of it are sent to
school to prepare them for a normal adult life. A trained nurse is on duty day
and night.
When children arrive, they are usually suffering from severe malnutrition and a
variety of diseases - typhus and TB are common in Peru. ``Many have never had
proper food and don't even know what a plate is. Sometimes we have to give them
a name because nobody knows their true name,'' says Betty Attwell.
Almost every day children have to be turned away. Eventually the home will
accommodate about 40. The Attwells say they do not want more because ``we want
this to be a family rather than an orphanage''.
Cash is not the only problem they face. Difficulty in obtaining qualified
staff, corruption, and mind-boggling red tape are other frustrations.
``It's difficult to get the medicines we need,'' Attwell explains. ``They are
much more expensive here than in the UK. The cheaper ones you find here may
have been watered down and `antibiotics' have been found to be powdered milk.
``Medicine worth $600 and desperately needed for our psychiatric cases has been
stuck in Customs for over a year. The officials want more documents for those
16 kilos than for a whole container shipment and they demand duties totalling
more than the medicine cost.''
The daily battle has taken its toll. Betty, addressed as ``Mama'' by her young
charges, suffers from a bad back and arthritis and Attwell himself can no
longer do heavy physical work. In November, 1993, he had to fly to London for a
double heart bypass operation.
The Hogar San Andres relies for funds on efforts by its mission, a registered
charity, in London. Attwell resists using the services of professional
fundraisers because he feels they take too much in administrative costs.
Nor does he agree with children-sponsoring schemes - ``only the nice-looking
kids get sponsored and also people lose interest after a while, but the
children still need feeding and clothing, day in, day out''.
It costs #100 a month to look after each child, taking all expenses into
account. Children like little angelic-faced Luchito, exact age unknown,
prospects uncertain. Luchito insists on hitting his ears until they bleed. Is
he trying to escape from some dark memory? Nobody knows, because Luchito cannot
talk. But when you look into his dark, sad eyes, he smiles . . .
n The UK contact address of Hogar San Andres is Saint Andrew's Evangelical
Mission, 126 Ealing Road, Brentford, Middlesex TW8 0LD.

A #600,000 painting acquired with the help of a grant of #300,000 from the
Heritage Lottery Fund was handed over yesterday to the National Galleries of
Scotland.
Lord Lindsay, the Scottish Office Arts Minister, who performed the ceremony,
said that, given the theme of the painting, the presentation could not have
come at a more appropriate time of year.
The painting was The Madonna and Child with the Infant Saint John the Baptist
and Attendant Angels, by Guilio Cesare Procaccini, one of the leading Lombard
artists of the early seventeenth century.
The National Art Collection Fund contributed #100,000 to the purchase and the
balance of #200,000 was raised from the galleries' own resources.
Lord Lindsay, handing over the painting to Mr Angus Grossart, chairman of the
board of trustees, and Mr Michael Clarke, keeper of the National Gallery,
called the work ``this exquisite oil painting''.
Mr Clarke said the Madonna and Child was widely recognised as one of the
artist's most beautiful small-scale paintings. It was orginally in the
collection of King Charles I.
Procaccini's work was rarely seen outside Italy and this acquisition enabled
the gallery to display permanently the strongest and most varied selection of
his work in Britain, he said.
The painting was owned formerly by the British Rail Pension Fund and had been
on loan to the gallery since 1979.

TWO women in the Borders region have contracted meningitis, Borders Health
Board said yesterday.
A spokesman for the health authority confirmed two patients with meningococcal
infection had been admitted to Borders General Hospital at Melrose earlier this
week. Both are said to be doing well and are expected to make a full recovery.
The cases prompted the formation of an outbreak control committee, led by a
consultant in public health medicine, to meet on Thursday when it was agreed to
continue monitoring the situation.
The health board has alerted GPs in the area and prescribed antibiotics to the
families of the two young women, who have not been named.
The spokesman said that although notification of the infection had risen
earlier this year in England and Wales, this was not the case in Scotland,
where figures had fallen slightly on the numbers reported last year.

<TEXT>
A CIVIL servant with nine years of service has lost his job for taking a pint
of milk without paying for it.
Mr John McArthur, 49, a support manager at the Ministry of Defence's services
unit at Kentigern House, Anderston, Glasgow, had told an industrial tribunal
that there was no-one in the canteen at the time and he intended to pay for the
milk later.
He was seen by two Ministry of Defence police officers.
In its findings, the tribunal said the dismissal procedure had been
``scrupulously fair''.
Management were concerned at the level of thefts from the canteen, which were
running at around #70 a week. They had just held a meeting with the two
detectives.
As they were leaving the restaurant, they saw Mr McArthur walking towards the
service area, take two half-pint cartons from the fridge, and leave. Restaurant
staff were in the kitchen and could be heard but Mr McArthur made no attempt to
attract anyone's attention.
The officers followed Mr McArthur and told him they suspected he was in
possession of stolen property. He said he was going to pay for it later.
Mr McArthur, of Hardridge Road, Corkerhill, Glasgow, said he was on an
emotional high as he was buying his first house and had just received
confirmation of his mortgage. He claimed he was not thinking rationally or
normally.
At his disciplinary hearing, he agreed he had seen notices about pilfering and
the consequences which might follow.
That hearing concluded that he was caught red-handed in the act of theft, the
incident amounted to gross misconduct, his plea in mitigation about his state
of mind at the time was not sufficiently convincing to justify a penalty less
than that of dismissal, and that there was a breakdown of trust and confidence
regardless of the value of goods stolen.
Mr McArthur also had his previous record, which showed no previous disciplinary
action, taken into account.

WHILE you won't actually have to present your child with his first key to the
door when he starts nursery school, he will be taking a big step down the road
towards independence.
The first days or weeks when he is left alone among a group of strangers can be
daunting for all concerned, but ultimately nursery education should be a high
point in his life, and should help his emotional and social development.
What can you realistically expect him to achieve at nursery school? Strathclyde
region has spent more than five years drawing up a policy document. Partners in
Learning, which it published two years ago. This aims to help people in all
sectors of childcare to understand how young children can be helped to learn
and how to introduce high quality practices into their work routines.
The policy is based on research which shows that although pre-school education
brings immediate benefits in the educational and social development of the
young, if these advantages are to be carried through into adulthood, the
quality of the education must be high.
All of which sounds, and is, very laudable and sophisticated, but seems somehow
highly inappropriate to a group of noisy under-fives. All very well in theory,
but how can it be made to apply to the everyday clamour of the average nursery?
Basically, it is put into practice by simple, straightforward measures which
ensure that children learn to have fun in an atmosphere of professional care
and understanding.
Given that children's attention span is short, their time at nursery is usually
divided between intervals of free play when they can go off and do whatever
takes their fancy, and structured activities, when they are guided through a
set task.
The guided activities tend to focus on developing number and language skills,
using basic techniques of colour and shape recognition. Often these activities
are linked to a general theme, such as the seasons or animals, to widen the
child's general knowledge base.
The free play, which in a sense can be just as guided as the set activities,
allows access to a wide range of textures and experiences. Painting equipment
is often available, along with sand and water play, and the various toys which
the nursery has in stock. Teachers are on hand to help the child explore these
areas, and to try to stimulate imaginative play.
Most important of all, however, is the fact that the children are thrown into
the great social melee of nursery life. They come together on a regular and
what is for them fairly lengthy basis with a group of children of their own age
and start to understand that vast, uncharted territory of social relationships.
They learn how to get along with other people, and how to become what every
parent wants their child to be, if not the life and soul of the party, then a
sociable, friendly and polite individual.
Often parents feel concerned that the papier mache masterpieces which greet
them at hometime look more like a plate of porridge than the skilled Eiffel
Tower type edifice hanging from the coatpeg next door. But in fact, there are
much more important things going on at the multiple levels of nursery life than
the number of tissue roses which can be glued to a paper plate.
However, like all aspects of educational life, it is wise to keep an eye on
your child's progress, and to choose a nursery with care. Nursery education
comes in two basic brands, private and publicly funded. State provision for
pre-fives is discretionary, so nursery schools have to compete for money with
all the other claims made on local authority budgets, and the availability of
places varies greatly. Because of the high demand, councils use a strict
allocations procedure, based on need, and it can be difficult to get a place.
Even then, most children attend for only half-days during the week.
These factors mean that parents, particularly working ones, often feel they
have to choose private provision, and many fear the facilities in this sector
are geared less towards the kind of educational standards governing local
authority provision than the more fundamental need to provide childminding
facilities. However, this is no longer the case. The Children's Act 1989
requires local authorities to carry out a registration inspection every two
years of all childcare provision for children up to eight years old.
The criteria are rigorous. The region's staff visit the nurseries to determine
whether the facilities are suitable for the purpose of looking after young
children, to ensure that the health and safety issues are being taken into
account fully, and that the amount of space available is sufficient.
The inspector takes up references from the people in charge of private
childcare, and carries out police checks on them. The region's own staff-child
ratios are recommended, which means one qualified staff member for every 10
children of three years and over, and one to six where there are babies and
toddlers.
When choosing a nursery, go along and see as many as you can and compare the
facilities available. If your child is a toddler, or older, take him along as
well and watch carefully how he reacts to the layout of each nursery, how he
behaves with the staff and how well they handle him. You have the right to see
a copy of the local authority's inspection report for the nursery, which will
give details of any problems which the inspectors identified on their last
visit.
A good nursery education will give your child an excellent introduction to the
more formal world of school. While he's grubbing around in the sandpit or up to
his elbows in plasticine, surrounded by his little chums, he will start to
realise that he is a unique person, with rights and interests which need to be
fulfilled. Hopefully, he will carry this knowledge with him for the rest of his
life.

WE have some bad news for Mr Paul Cullen, recently appointed Solicitor-General
for Scotland. The maverick Labour MP for Falkirk West, Dennis Canavan,
remembers that he taught Mr Cullen when he was a student in Edinburgh.
Mr Canavan told us: ``I never thought I would live to see the day when any
former pupil of mine would become a member of a Tory Government. Maybe I should
have concentrated on teaching him more about politics than maths.
``However, I suppose there is still hope for him. He is constitutionally unique
in that he is the only member of the Government who is not a member of either
House of Parliament. Maybe at the next General Election Tony Blair might find
him a safe seat.''
League campaign
OFF we go to the all-party rugby league group dinner in the Cholmondeley Room,
where the Labour MP for Makerfield, Mr Ian McCartney, has decided to put
himself forward as a candidate to manage the Scottish rugby league team in the
next World Cup.
He has impeccable credentials as the son of Hugh McCartney, the former MP for
East Dunbartonshire, Dunbartonshire Central and Clydebank and Milngavie, and
was a mean rugby union scrum half in his day. He played hooker once, but didn't
much fancy life in the front row after being punched in the face in his first
scrum.
Anyway, he tells the Diary that Scotland did so well in the recent emerging
nations rugby league World Cup that they will be included in the full
competition in two years' time. His greatest ambition is to manage a Scotland
team that will run out to play England at Hampden Park.
Musical spectacle
Who was that man tinkling the ivories at a charity concert in St John's, Smith
Square, earlier this week? It was Tory MP Toby Jessel (Twickenham) who played a
piece by Schumann described by one musically informed source as the ``suicide
sonata''.
More than 100 MPs were present at the concert, which was in aid of the NSPCC,
and apparently Mr Jessel got so worked up playing the piece that he had to keep
mopping his brow and wiping his glasses. So intense did he become, that as he
reached the climax of the piece, his glasses flew off when he struck the final
chord.
His efforts, however, helped to raise #40,000 for the charity, on top of the
#30,000 raised at a similar event last year.
To the point
FASCINATING exchanges in the Lords the other day on the Deer (Amendment)
(Scotland) Bill. All sorts of peers - Baroness Robson of Kiddington, the Earl
of Woolton and Lord Pearson of Rannoch, for example - had to declare their
interest as owners of Highland estates, with Lord Pearson even going so far as
to admit that he was largely an ``absentee owner''.
The whole thing seems to be puzzling Labour's Front Bench spokesman, Lord
Carmichael of Kelvingrove, who is being bombarded by briefings from the likes
of the World Widlife Fund, the Scottish Wildlife Trust, the British Deer
Society, and the Scottish RSPCA.
As he put it: ``I am not by any means an expert on the subject. Looking at the
benches opposite I realise that many people know a great deal about it, but it
is not a subject that is raised very often on the streets of Partick.''
One Scottish peer who did not speak in the debate has robust views on the
matter. ``We shoot deer at any time, day or night,'' he bluntly told the Diary.
``They are classed as vermin. They're lovely to eat, though.''
Caught in Act
INTERESTING information reaches us from the Scottish Office, thanks to a
question from the Liberal Democrats' Charles Kennedy. A total of 94 Acts of the
Scottish Parliament passed before 1707 are still in force.
They include such gems as the Royal Mines Act of 1424, the Lawburrows Act of
1429 and the Liferent Caution Act of 1491. Lord James Douglas-Hamilton says
that while there is a presumption that any Scots Act which has not been
statutorily repealed remains in force, that presumption can be repealed through
application of the doctrine of desuetude. The whit?

A FINAL attempt to delay the first rail passenger franchise contracts, due to
be signed on Monday afternoon, will be made on Monday morning when the Save Our
Railways pressure group will ask the Appeal Court to review their allegations
that franchise director Roger Salmon breached Government guarantees on service
levels.
In a judicial review in the High Court yesterday, Mr Justice Macpherson
rejected claims that the passenger service levels set for the first lines to be
privatised would allow franchise bidders to cut services.
Had SOR won, its victory would have thrown the Government's franchising plans
into disarray. Instead, the judge threw out the suggestion that Mr Salmon had
not complied with the wishes of the Government and stressed that even if he had
not then that was a case for Parliament and not for the courts.
He lifted an obligation on the franchise director to give SOR 48 hours' notice
before franchises are awarded, denied leave to appeal, and awarded costs
against SOR, which includes Transport 2000, the Rail Development Society, the
rail unions, and a growing number of local authorities.
Labour transport spokesman Brian Wilson said the judgment ``removes any
pretence that there are safeguards for services in the rail-privatisation
process'', adding that the franchise director had been given a licence to do
what he liked while assurances by Ministers, both inside and outside the House
of Commons, had been exposed as worthless.
``This will bring rail privatisation into further disrepute,'' he said.
SOR secretary Keith Bill said: ``We are shocked and angered by this judge's
decision.''
The judge had accepted that there could be service cuts and he would not
intervene to protect the travelling public, said Mr Bill.
``The judge had said that if a Minister misled the public `that is a matter for
Parliament'. We don't agree. That is why on Monday morning first thing we shall
go to the Court of Appeal to ask for a hearing and a freeze on franchises
pending that hearing.''
Rail, Maritime, and Transport Union general secretary Jimmy Knapp warned that
if yesterday's judgment was allowed to stand, it would mean greatly reduced
services and the loss of around 22,000 rail jobs.
Transport Secretary Sir George Young said the judgment was ``a vindication of
the Government's approach and a triumph for the travelling public''.
Mr Nick Newton, an assistant director at the Office of Passenger Rail
Franchising, said he was ``clearly pleased with the result'' of the case. He
denied rail cuts were planned.
Mr Nigel Pleming QC, for SOR, said Mr MacGregor had assured MPs and the public
that, although he could not say ``every single train will run at the time it
runs at present'', the privatised services would be based on the existing BR
timetable.
He said that ``allowing substantial cuts of up to 52% in services, cutting out
services completely, changing the times trains stop and start'' was ``wholly
inconsistent'' with what the Minister had been saying.
The judge said the franchising director owed a duty to the Secretary of State
for Transport but had ``important discretionary powers of his own'' and added
that PSRs were not timetables and it was up to the director to decide minimum
service levels. Those who feared service cuts must wait to see whether their
fears were well founded, he said.
Bids to run train services over the east coast line between Scotland and London
closed yesterday. Opraf declined to provide even the numbers of formal bids,
let alone name those who have lodged indicative offers, now subject of scrutiny
and negotiation. A management-employee team from InterCity East Coast has
lodged a bid.

A CANDIDATE in this month's Russian elections has been shot dead on his
doorstep in the second murder of the campaign.
Mikhail Lezhnev, 48, owner of a successful poultry farm, was found dead outside
his home near Chelyabinsk in the Ural mountains overnight. He had been shot in
the head.
His death, less than two weeks after MP Sergei Markidonov was killed on the
campaign trail in Siberia, heightened concern that violence could mar the
election.
Lezhnev was a candidate for Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's centre-right
Our Home is Russia movement, which said the killing was politically-motivated.
He had been married with grown-up children.
Police spokesman Boris Mityurev said Lezhnev had been leading in opinion polls
in his constituency but that it was not clear if his death was linked with
business or politics.
``We do not know who killed him. No-one saw the killing,'' he said. However
local sources said Lezhnev was probably shot by a professional killer as
another businessman survived a similar attempt on his life yesterday.-Reuter.

<TEXT>
THE Government yesterday outlined new laws designed to punish organisers of
child sex tours.
The legislation would target people in Britain who arrange foreign trips on
which adults commit sexual offences against children, and those who encourage
others to travel to exploit children sexually.
Home Secretary Michael Howard said: ``The full force of the law must be used
against the evil people who sexually exploit children for money.
``It is an abhorrent activity. We must do all we can to prevent it and protect
children everywhere.''
The announcement follows a review of the laws on conspiracy and incitement
prompted by the apparently growing numbers of people participating in child sex
tours.
The proposed legislation would allow the prosecution of those who: conspire to
commit abroad a crime which is also an offence in Britain; or incite others to
commit such an offence.
Offenders could face stiff penalties. Conspiracy to commit rape could attract a
life term; to have sex with a girl under 13 a seven-year term; indecent assault
on a boy 10 years; and indecency with a child under 14 two years' imprisonment.
Mr Howard said: ``These depraved people will face the same tough penalties as
they would if they had committed these offences here.''
But the proposals outlined by Mr Howard are likely to disappoint some
campaigners who wanted to see more comprehensive measures against paedophile
sex tourists.
They have argued for legislation which would allow British citizens to be tried
here for sexual offences committed while they were on foreign soil.
Other Western countries have introduced such legislation. Earlier this year, a
Swedish paedophile was jailed for having sex with a child while on holiday in
Thailand.
But the Home Office is known to have had serious misgivings about the
feasibility of legislation introducing such extra-territorial jurisdiction,
because of problems with evidence-gathering and bringing witnesses from Third
World countries to give evidence in British courts.
The plans were outlined in a written answer from Home Office minister David
Maclean to a parliamentary question from David Faber, Tory MP for Westbury.
Mr Howard said the Government was looking for a ``suitable legislative
opportunity'' to progress the proposals. It may well identify a Conservative MP
who could sponsor the legislation as a Private Member's Bill.
Mr David Ould, spokesman for the Coalition on Child Prostitution and Tourism,
an alliance of groups including Anti-Slavery International, Save the Children
and the NSPCC, said Mr Howard was not going far enough.
He added: ``Most of the culprits are individual travellers - this doesn't seem
to get at them at all.

THE solicitor leading the Scottish Office inquiry into the way senior officials
have been appointed for North Lanarkshire Council has appealed for information
from the public.
However, he stressed he did not want any anonymous communications.
Mr Ian MacLeod, a senior partner in Shepherd and Wedderburn WS in Edinburgh and
a specialist in employment law, gave a commitment to complete his report on the
matter to Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth by the end of January.
An official inquiry into allegations of religious bias and nepotism over
appointments at Monklands District Council conducted by Mr William Nimmo Smith
QC ended recently.
Mr MacLeod said he appreciated there was ``a degree of uncertainty and possibly
some unease'' among those concerned with the matter in North Lanarkshire,
particularly perhaps among the chief officers themselves.
Speaking at the Scottish Office yesterday, Mr MacLeod, 58, added: ``I would
like to reassure everyone that I approach my task with a resolve to complete it
in a comprehensive and fair manner by January 31 as requested by the Secretary
of State.''
Mr MacLeod said that although the inquiry was now under way, he did not expect
to be holding any public hearings until early in January.
The decision by the Scottish Secretary last month to set up the inquiry
followed a number of complaints and ``jobs for the boys'' allegations about
some of the senior appointments in the Motherwell-based North Lanarkshire
Council made to the Local Government Staff Commission.
The commission concluded it could not give the council a clean bill of health
and passed the matter to the Scottish Office.
One particular complaint was made over the appointment of Mr David MacKendrick,
64, as the #71,000 a year social work director. There were also claims that
Motherwell district officials were being preferred over employees of other
authorities. Five out of 10 chief officials come from that council.
In a parliamentary written answer announcing the appointment of Mr MacLeod to
conduct the inquiry, the Scottish Secretary said he was to inquire whether
North Lanarkshire had failed to comply with the duty imposed on it by section.7
of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 to make appointments to paid
office or employment on merit and to report on the matter.
Mr Forsyth said the inquiry provided an opportunity to establish whether the
complaints were justified and whether action such as re-running the
appointments procedures was necessary.
Mr MacLeod said he suspected there would be members of the public who had
information which could be helpful to the inquiry. He asked them to write to
him at The North Lanarkshire Inquiry, c/o Shepherd and Wedderburn WS, Saltire
Court, 20 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh.

TRAMPS and businessmen: among all the victims of the vast transport and public
sector strike now entering its third week in France, some are less equal than
others. Touchingly, President Jacques Chirac, attending the weekly Cabinet
meeting on Wednesday between visits to Africa and Germany, had words of concern
for both categories.
The trudging and bicycling mass of the general public, weary beyond mere
irritation and dumb with astonishment that the discomfort of this strike could
actually last so long, might at least count themselves fortunate by comparison
with Paris's thousands of homeless.
For them, the Metro is an almost permanent refuge, which takes them out of the
cold and also, more worryingly, away from basic notions of night and day.
Underground corridors and trains are also means of earning money: from begging,
busking, or selling newspapers produced by and for the benefit of the homeless.
At street level, the Metro's ventilation grids provide warm places to sleep.
With the strike, the tramps lose even that.
Last week, the first sub-zero temperatures and snowfalls of the winter inspired
the Minister for Humanitarian Action, Xavier Emmanuelli, to ask Paris's Metro
and bus authorities, the RATP, to open the disused underground station of Saint
Martin, near the Republique in the East End, as daytime shelter for homeless
people.
Yesterday, more than 100 turned up to be given Army canteen food before being
ferried away by RATP buses at 8pm to hostels in the Paris region.
A government building in the West End of the city has also been put at the
disposal of the medical teams who specialise in treating the physical and
psychological ills of Paris's tramps.
Chirac, meanwhile, at the Cabinet meeting, asked Ministers to assist town
councils throughout France in helping the homeless and to report back every day
on the sort and amount of accommodation being supplied.
Experts are only beginning to measure the damage being wreaked on France's
economy by two weeks without trains, public transport, or post.
Certain sectors (such as Paris's cycle shops, unable to cope with demand) have
made small fortunes. The domestic airline, Air Inter, free from competition of
the TGV train, has been busy scheduling extra flights and the private airline,
AOM, has recorded a 35% increase in passengers.
With people unable to make appointments reduced to doing business on the phone,
France Telecom has had a surge in calls. Messenger services in the Paris region
are providing 60% more trips than usual.
The negative side, however, is greatly alarming a government too proud and too
nervous to show it.
According to a survey carried out by the Chamber of Commerce for the Paris
region, 60% of firms have recorded a large drop in business over the past
fortnight, and 25% fear they could be forced into bankruptcy.
Takings in Paris department stores, which rely heavily on December shopping,
are 50% down on last year. The 22,000 smaller stores in the country have
experienced an average 40% fall-off in business. Wine producers and merchants
are complaining of a 10% drop in sales.
With private haulage companies unable to equal the freight capacities of the
railways, firms lack raw materials and, in many cases, because of the public
transport strike, their staff.
Goods, if they are finished, are difficult to distribute, and the post strike
means millions of cheques are blocked in depots.
The management union, CNPF, launched an appeal last week with the government
for employers late with tax contributions to be exempted from penalties.
At the Cabinet meeting, Chirac invited businessmen who are experiencing
difficulties in meeting tax deadlines to make contact as soon as possible with
their local Inland Revenue offices. The latter, he said, had received
instructions to be particularly understanding. What he did not mention,
unfortunately, was the fact that many Inland Revenue staff were on strike.

STRATHCLYDE Region yesterday was accused of targetting motorists who are coming
to Glasgow city centre for Christmas shopping.
During the build-up to Christmas, traffic in Glasgow's city centre increases by
30%. At the same time, the number of cars uplifted from city streets rockets by
more than 300% from an average 12 a day to more than 50.
At a cost of #105 to become mobile again plus a #20 fixed parking fine, it is a
heavy extra Christmas expense. However, for Strathclyde region and the
contractors who carry out the removals, it is a money spinner which nets more
than #500,000 a year.
In the three years since the scheme started, more than #500,000 a year has been
collected by Strathclyde, with slightly more than 25% going to the contractor,
Bells of Richmond, who secured the three-year contract with a bid of #486,000,
netting more than #162,000 a year.
In the first year, 1993, 5123 cars were removed at a cost of #537,915 to
motorists. The following year the figure was 5416 cars which raised #568,680.
Already this year, including Thursday's figure, 5048 have ended up in the pound
and that figure is expected to increase to around 5600 before Christmas and
pump around #600,000 into Strathclyde's bank account.
Extra removal trucks are drafted in to cope with the rush doubling the three on
call during the rest of the year to six.
No-one escapes if their vehicle is illegally parked or causing an obstruction,
as one wheel-chair bound disabled driver found to his cost when he parked in
Howard Street and returned to find his car had disappeared.
Although the Automobile Association agrees with the concept of keeping traffic
moving and removing illegally and badly parked cars, their spokesman said
yesterday he felt the motorist was being targeted. He called for more
information and signs to alert drivers to the dangers of being towed away. ``It
is a purge against motorists who park illegally. We do not condone illegal
parking but we would ask the police to show a bit more discretion, especially
at this time of year and especially in the case of disabled people. Leaving
them stranded is very distressing.
``Many people do abandon their vehicle because they are not aware of the
situation. Perhaps there should be signs telling them they are in a tow-away
area. However, in the long run, ignorance is no excuse.''
A RAC spokeswoman said: ``It is a purge. We do not like this method being used
as a revenue-raising exercise. Improved sign-posting would help.''
The city centre traffic build-up in the run-up to Christmas normally starts
around mid-November. Chief Inspector Jim Neil, head of Strathclyde Police
traffic specialist services, said: ``We are not targeting motorists. We do all
we can to alert motorists to the problems by broadcasting the situation
regarding the parking situation in local car parks.''
A spokesman for Strathclyde Regional Council said: ``Only cars that are
illegally parked or causing an obstruction are moved. The whole aim of the
exercise is to keep traffic moving.''
Glasgow is not alone in the practice. Edinburgh has been impounding cars for
around two years and the penalty fixed nationally is the same. However, it has
not yet spread to other police forces.
In Aberdeen, a spokesman for Grampian Police said the problem of double parking
had not reached a level where impounding was thought to be necessary.
Northern Constabulary, while aware of the measures being taken in Glasgow, said
nothing similar was planned. ``If a vehicle is parked where it is causing a
major obstruction and we can't get the driver, then we will call someone in to
move it,'' he said.
In Dundee, Tayside Police have their own recovery vehicle for lifting cars but
use it mainly for moving cars to official car parks at football matches, said a
police spokesman.

A SCOTTISH trawler and its crew of 10 were being detained in port yesterday for
alleged illegal fishing in the English Channel.
The purse-seine boat Alert, out of Fraserburgh, was escorted into Plymouth
early yesterday by a Royal Navy fisheries protection vessel.
It was detained within the mackerel ``box'' 12 miles south of the port, an area
where trawlers are not allowed to fish for mackerel.
Outwith that zone, boats use special nets and fish at a certain depth to
maximise their haul of mackerel. The fish are migratory and tend to leave the
North Sea in winter months.
A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food at Exeter
said: ``The Alert was escorted into port by HMS Cottismore for further
inspection.''
The boat's agents, Caley Fisheries in Fraserburgh, said it had no details of
the alleged offence. The Alert is understood to be owned by skipper John Smith.

<HEADLINE>Nuclear test veterans win Strasbourg review</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<TEXT>
EX-SERVICEMEN campaigning for compensation from the Government after they were
used as guinea-pigs during nuclear tests in the 1950s have won the first round
of their fight for justice.
The British Nuclear Test Veterans' Association, pressing for a #2000m award,
claims its members have suffered cancers and other life-threatening diseases
from radiation exposure.
Last night, it was confirmed that the European Commission of Human Rights had
granted a review of the association's case. Now, three individual cases, each
involving Scots, will be examined in detail early in the new year.
The announcement from Strasbourg has delighted veterans who have been fighting
for compensation for 12 years.
The Commission has ordered a full review of the UK's actions in exposing
thousands of young servicemen to high levels of radiation for experimental
purposes.
Commissioners will also investigate why the UK Government attempted to defeat
war pensions claims by withholding vital military medical records from those
claiming that radiation-linked disabilities and cancers stemmed directly from
the tests.
The decision, contained in two judgments just issued, follows the complaints
raised in Europe. One is by the daughter of a Christmas Island veteran from
Glasgow. The woman, aged 28, suffers from a severe condition linked to her
father's radiation exposure. The two other cases are from veterans who suffer
similar conditions but have been denied war pensions.
New York-based lawyer Ian Anderson, a Scottish-trained advocate from Paisley,
who represented the claimants in Europe, said the decision had followed two
years of complex legal argument in which the Government resisted attempts by
the applicants to have their cases heard by the Commission.
He said: ``In rejecting the Government's arguments, the Commission referred
amongst other things to the 1985 Royal Australian Commission report which found
that the UK had displayed `ignorance, incompetence and cynicism' with regard to
the safety of persons - civilian and military - in the vicinity of its nuclear
tests.''
In permitting the full review early next year, the Commission said it was
disturbing that the British Government had withheld vital military medical
records which detailed post-detonation treatment for radiation exposure.
The Commission will look at whether the denial of such access constitutes
``inhuman and degrading treatment'' of the veterans by the UK.
Mr Anderson said the European decision represented the ``first ray of hope''
for veterans, their children and widows who have suffered as a result of the
Government's refusal to admit liability or wrongdoing, while quietly settling
the claims of others.
He added: ``For many veterans who have already succumbed to their
radiation-induced conditions, the Commission's decisions have arrived too
late.''
More than 22,000 servicemen from all over the UK witnessed the bomb testing
programmes between 1952 and 1958.
The latest development was hailed as ``fantastic news'' by Renfrew district
councillor Ken McGinley, 57, who started the bid for compensation in 1983.
The former Royal Engineer was sent to Christmas Island in 1958 and witnessed
six explosions.

THOSE who have, through a slip of the tongue, said funeral when they meant
wedding (or vice versa) will understand the error which crept into last
Saturday's article in this space. Dealing with the wide variation in attitude
toward weddings among my ministerial colleagues, I pronounced that upon
induction to a parish a minister is pledged to marry and baptise those who live
within it. I should, of course, have written marry and bury.
Baptism is a very different matter. More of that in a moment, after I have
apologised to any Kirk minister who in the next couple of weeks will be
confronted by a ``consumer'' waving a copy of last week's column and demanding
that his child be baptised whether or not the family have any connection with
the church.
The fact is that while parish ministers are obliged to conduct weddings and
funerals for those who live in their patch, the conduct of baptism in the
Church of Scotland is limited to those with a definite connection to the
church. Moreover, it leads to even greater diversity of practice among Kirk
ministers than I described in the article on marriage.
Since the three rites of passage (baptism, marriage, and funeral) are the
occasions upon which vast numbers of people have dealings with the Christian
church, it is worth trying to describe what the practice of the national church
is in this regard.
I wish it was simple to do so. First, let us deal with the rules which Kirk
ministers are obliged to uphold. These state that baptism may be administered
to a child with at least one parent who has been baptised and is a church
member (or expresses the intention to become one). So far, pretty clear - but
also pretty strict since many parents who desire baptism for their children do
not fall into this category.
However, an exception is made for those who profess Christianity and are
connected with the congregation in some way even if they don't attend worship
``due to causes which make such attendance a practical impossibility''.
Night-shift working might easily be such a cause, but who is to say that
inability to get out of bed on Sunday morning is not a ``practical
impossibility'' for many young couples?
This raises the question of interpretation. Many ministers think that to
administer baptism in these circumstances is a mockery. Others try to explain
the rules and end up convincing the parents that there is no room at this inn
for them. Others simply bend or ignore the rules.
This is clearly not a satisfactory situation. The Church of Scotland can hardly
claim to be a national church if its local agents in neighbouring villages
implement totally different practices with regard to something as basic and
universal as baptism.
Some Kirk ministers from the evangelical wing are even opposed to infant
baptism. They would prefer believers baptism in which the people being baptised
takes their own vows. Certainly this has the virtue of removing the problem of
complacent parents who don't fit the system, but it implies that infant baptism
is not ``proper'' baptism.
At its worst this attitude leads ministers to refuse baptism to babies and in
some extreme cases to administer baptism again in adult life (thereby implying
the infant baptism was not valid). Several ministers have left the Kirk (or
been shown the door) for this.
At the other extreme are ministers who baptise on demand, even to the extent of
poaching babies from other parishes (and breaking more rules in the process).
The late Rev James Currie was well known for this foible. It made him popular
with the parents and unpopular with his colleagues who were trying their best
to live by the rules.
Understandably they pointed out that he was unable to take any further part in
their Christian upbringing by his ``hit-and-run'' sacraments.
The Roman Catholic and Anglican churches do not have this kind of problem. As
well as the parents they involve ``godparents'' who take vows at the baptism to
ensure the godly upbringing of the baby. If the parents hang loose to religion
then the godparents can be practising Christians, and the requirements of the
rules satisfied. (It is worth noting that the RC church accepts the infant
baptism of the C of S as valid, which makes the attitude of certain RC priests
who will not accept a practising Protestant as godparent, to be both illogical
as well as bigoted.)
It is significant that many Kirk parents have copied this practice unofficially
and turn up complete with one or even two sets of godparents.
I say unofficially because the C of S baptismal service has no vows
specifically for godparents.
However, I believe that godparents may provide the way forward through this
tangled jungle of rules, practices, and motives. If the Church of Scotland were
to change its baptismal laws to be in line with these other traditions it would
lose nothing and gain a great deal. The baby would be baptised and if the
parents did not fit the provisions of Act XVII (1963) the appropriate vows
would be taken in loco parentis by godparents in good standing, and everyone
would be happy.
The 1963 Act is now hopelessly out of step with our times and ecumenical
practice. It is also the kind of legalism which sits uneasily with true
religion. More conclusively, it would have denied Joseph and Mary a baptism for
their baby boy since they did not belong to the parish of Bethlehem.

WHAT is it about panto and the Scots? There was this note of curious bafflement
in the press officer's voice - live art, visual art, films and festivals, he'd
done them all, but this was his first brush with pantomime. And he was
struggling with disbelief.
``Six weeks before curtain up, and the box office was going non-stop. And we
hadn't really done all that much...... the usual posters, a few balloons. But,
weeks in advance, people were phoning up. Six tickets - same seats as last
year, same performance as last year. And then they'd say - `By the way. What is
it this year?'''
For someone who had seen expensively publicised events come and go without a
break-even audience, such droves of spontaneous booking blew ka-whumphing great
raspberries at marketing strategy.
A couple of nights later, and I got the beginnings of an answer to his
question. The taxi driver who picked me up outside the Citizens - I'd just seen
Pinocchio - described, without any prompting on my part, his most abiding
memory of a childhood panto. It was Cinderella. And no, it wasn't the coach and
Shetland ponies that had stayed with him. It was another transport that had
delighted him. For no reason he - or his mum - could fathom then, or now, a
cut-out bus had fetched up on stage. ``A 47, to Castlemilk.'' He was absolutely
sure of the number; it had told the audience where the sketch was coming from,
as it were.
The routine had involved a Glesca clippy - he recalled some of the ``c'moan get
aff'' patter but not who had delivered it. What he did remember, though, was
how utterly gee-ed up he'd felt for days and days afterwards. You could hear
the child in the man's voice, still tickled by the daftness of it all, loving
the awful jokes, the shouting back, the colour and glitz - he hadn't even
minded the songs too much. They were a chance to unwrap your sweeties before
the Dame or the baddie came back. But the best thing, the thing that had kept
him going back as an adult, was that they were live.
But ``live'' in a vastly different way from other kinds of theatre. Pantomime
is, essentially, licensed anarchy - and I reckon that's one reason the Scots
have clung on to its traditions so vehemently. And it's about subverting gloom
in the time-honoured way: by laughing it out of countenance. It's no
coincidence that so many of the jokes are at the expense of poverty.
``We're having a big do(o) this Christmas...... we can't afford a turkey.''
Whether the accent locates it in Maryhill, Morningside or Aberdeen, the
chortles of recognition have erupted nationwide for decades.
Poor? POOR? ``We were so poor the wolf wisnae just at oor door - it had its
pups in the lobby.'' So what did we do? We told more jokes! Or maybe sang a
little song. Or maybe had a wee bit of a greet, until everybody said: `AAAAW.'
And that made us feel better. As in life, so in panto - or vice versa. (Panto
being a great place for vice versa, as you know.)
Hard times weren't the only things to take a drubbing. Authority, pomposity
hypocrisy, priggishness, are year-in, year-out targets. And it doesn't really
matter that these days we are awash with supposedly debunking forces -
newspapers, radio, television, the Internet - because there's one crucial
difference: we believe the Dame.
Well, she reminds us of a granny, an auntie, a woman up the road or - and yes,
folks, I heard this in Edinburgh years ago - ``thet's meh cleaning lady to a
T!''
The same carefully vowelled tones were later to reassure the perjink companion
when things got a tad saucy: ``It's all right to laugh, Mamie - it's Stenley
Bexter!''
It's all right to laugh because, in the end, you are laughing at care, at life,
at yourself. Wha's like us? Gey few - and they're not nearly as funny either.
But is that true? Are Scottish pantos really significantly different? Is this
wishful thinking, cultural nostalgia - tied up with a child's-eye view of
Christmases past, when someone else had the responsibility of paying for that
do(o)?
Actually, I don't think so. A historical reason first - hysterical reasons
later. In the sixties, English pantomimes underwent certain radical changes
that didn't affect the Scottish scene so irreversibly. Managements everywhere
had watched with growing unease as a one-eyed threat had crept into
living-rooms throughout the land. Comedians sat, speechless, in dressing rooms.
They were all quipped-out. That one-eyed box in the living-room corner had
gobbled up the act of a lifetime in one fell spectacular. Even the clean jokes
had been rendered unrepeatable.
It was at this point that many managements down south brought in the pop stars
and the emerging television names, not as speciality acts - pantos had had
those since the earliest of days - but as main players.
Cliff Richard and the Shadows found themselves trussed into cod-medieval
Lincoln Green, guitars hurriedly replaced with bows and arrows, so they could
wander about as Robin Hood and his Merrie Men in some hackneyed version of
Babes in the Wood.
What ho, backers? This will bring in a new, young audience, cried the panicked
management. And to a certain extend it did. But the pantos changed to
accommodate the strength - limitations, more usually - of the pop
personalities, not vice versa. And pantos, as we know, are keen on vice versa.
Could I just say in passing, that pantos and puberty don't really sit well
together. Adolescents are in a perpetual state of anarchy. They have their own
rituals for expressing it. And they certainly don't want to be part of any
anarchy that is subscribed to by their younger siblings or - worst of all -
their parents and grandparents.
Herd adolescent boys into a panto and you are asking for the villain to be
cheered, his henchmen told where the goodies are hiding, and the fairy's every
request for help to be turned down with roars of ``NOooo''. Not even the
Brownies, who probably have a badge in panto-audienceship, can outshout the
spoilsport louts.
Anyway, here in Scotland we didn't run to that many pop stars - though I have
seen Sydney Devine as Buttons. There simply wasn't the same headlong rush to
replace seasoned performers with folk who were famous for advertising chocky
bars on television. And this is where the hysterical reasons come in. Stanley
Baxter. Jimmy Logan. Una McLean. Rikki Fulton. Jack Milroy. Johnny Beattie.
Walter Carr. Phil McCall. And hosts more besides whom I've missed in haste.
These were, still are, ``oor ain folk'' who knew all about us and were allowed
to cast it all up!
But who carries on the tradition? And do younger generations really want it -
or is that old pantophiles going soggy and wistful?
Well, here you have the chicken-and-egg conundrum - should that be
goose-and-golden-egg? If managements choose to stick by the traditional panto,
then there's no shortage of new dames, new Simple Simons, Wishee-Washees,
Buttons et al, ready to carry on in the old ways. Andy Gray, Gerard Kelly, Paul
Young, John Ramage - to name but four - are all likely lads for the Dames,
Bazooms, and tackety boots.
And kids, if taken along, will respond as if some twizzle in their DNA had
predisposed them to laugh at the drop of a voluminous bloomer.
That said, there have definitely been moves away from traditional panto formats
in recent years.
Most noticeably, many repertory theatres, with Perth a resolute exception -
have opted for children's plays, the majority of them penned by the amazing
Stuart Paterson. Here Vaudeville gives way to straightforward storytelling,
albeit with panto elements - Paterson has a wise understanding of the youthful
need for the moment of anarchy: the moments of whopping vulgarity, and
political incorrectness - best summarised in a rip-snorting fart - and the
audience participation that shrieks away feelings of scaredyness and says at
the top of its piping voice: `I'm here. And I matter.'
And then there is, too, the solid rumour of mooted change at the King's in
Glasgow. After 20 years of sharing costs, which can reach the phenomenal
quarter million mark at panto - and swopping shows - Glasgow has parted company
with the consortium that had the King's Edinburgh and Sunderland Empire as the
other partners.
Babes in the Wood - which features Jimmy Logan alongside Cannon and Ball - is
the last Glasgow panto we'll see staged under this past agreement. So far,
Glasgow's Department of Performing Arts and Venues has kept its future plans
for the King's season show under heavily secured wraps. Who knows - maybe a
Phantom of the Panto is set to laser its way centre-stage next winter.
Will low comedy lose out to hi-tech? Will push-button home entertainment push
panto into the margin? If anything, as we inch nearer those superhighways, I
suspect that panto will most surely come into its finest, subversive own.
As nights draw in, wee figures will be seen slipping out of flickering arcades
where motionless bodies will be locked in virtual-reality thraldom. One by one
these cultural revolutionaries will settle into worn plush seats as an old
piano announces the strains of Pantomime, Pantomime. The stage will fill with
our most primitive emotions - fear of the darkness, of poverty, of being ugly
and unloved. The Dame and her raucous vitality will challenge the lot in a
flurry of ancient ambiguities.
And when the evil genius, Mindgrab, emerges from his hacker's lair, claiming
universal sovereignty, his boastful ``I am Lord of All Life Games'' will be
answered by a wee Brownie yelling ``Oh no you're not!''
See Scots? See panto? On a good day, ye canny tell the difference.

ABERDEEN yesterday did themselves and the country a favour by doing a deal with
one of the best young players around, Stephen Glass, which will make sure he
continues to fulfil his potential in the premier division for the next
two-and-a-half years at least.
The piece of shrewd business done by manager Roy Aitken not only gives the
teenager, valued at #2m, a solid base to further his career at club and
international level but also will make him one of the best paid players at
Pittodrie.
The 19-year-old, who is already a probable starter in Scotland's European
Championship finals squad next summer, did not take a lot of time to agree to
the deal, despite the fact that he was very much in the transfer minds of major
clubs in England, like Spurs, Newcastle United and Nottingham Forest. ``It was
not a hard decision to reach. This is one of the best clubs to be with where I
can learn from the coaches and players and become a better player. My family
agreed on that point.
``I knew of all the transfer speculation but just ignored it as I was under
contract anyway.''
Since he forced his way into the first team a year ago, Glass has collected a
Coca-Cola Cup winning medal, as well as being named man of the match in the
final, but seems sensible enough to keep his hat size unchanged. ``I know what
Craig Brown has said about the European Championship finals and I want to be
there, but I won't worry if I'm not. I have plenty of time on my side.
Said his manager: ``He is arguably the best young player in the country and it
was only right for him to be rewarded for his progress. He is now a major part
of my team and been so consistent since the first day he came into the side.''
Aitken will be without suspended captain Stewart McKimmie and striker Scott
Booth for the visit of Motherwell as he aims for three straight home wins in
the next eight days to move up the table.
Motherwell are considering a bid for Oldham striker Darren Beckford as Tommy
Coyne looks unlikely to be fit to return for some time yet. Beckford, 28, cost
Norwich City #900,000 but is available for transfer. Said McLeish: ``There is
no sign of Coyne's injury clearing and we urgently need to get more goals. This
and our injury situation is what is causing all our problems. I have several
players in mind and will move shortly if our goals rate does not improve.''
McLeish believes his team still have a real chance at Pittodrie where they have
done well in the past. `There is a sense of deja vu going back to Aberdeen.
They were struggling in the league last season just as we are now. However, I
do not see this as a long-term problem.
``We will start climbing the table once we get our players back fit again. In
the meantime it is a question of minimising mistakes and maintaining the
fighting spirit.
``There is a freshness about Aberdeen this season and you can see where Roy
Aitken wants the club to go. They are not yet the finished article but have
come a long way since their crisis of confidence had them fighting for
survival.''
McLeish will have Brian Martin and Eddie May back in the side.
Raith Rovers, who slipped up at Falkirk last week after establishing themselves
in fourth place, will be in determined mood against Hearts at Kirkcaldy, but
have two doubts, Shaun Dennis and Jason Dair.
Hearts, who will have Neil Poynton back after a six-week absence, confirmed
that Dave McPherson, who is injured at the moment, is not going to Coventry
City.
There ought to be plenty  of action at Rugby Park where two teams with much to
play for at the wrong end of the table, Kilmarnock and Falkirk, meet.
Certainly, Falkirk's former Rangers and Hearts player, David Hagen, thinks that
will be the case. ``I reckon if the pitch is in good condition it will be a
cracking game.
Both sides like to play attacking football and I don't think there will be any
sitting back.
``Killie will obviously want to win to catch us in the league, but we can open
up a wee gap on them with three points. Whatever the outcome, I'm sure it's
going to be entertaining.''
Hagen hopes for a more rewarding time than his last appearance, which was his
Brockville debut, against Killie, when the Ayrshire lot won 2-0.
``To be fair, I think it was an even game and they caught us with a
sucker-punch, but I hope today will be different and I've got a sneaking
feeling we can win.''
His assistant manager, Gerry Collins, is convinced that a win at Rugby Park
could really set his team on their way up the league. ``Although we're near the
bottom at the moment, a couple of decent results will lift us up the table
dramatically,'' he said. ``Take Hearts, for instance. About a month ago, they
won three matches on the trot and it took them from ninth to fourth.
``Their situation is a massive incentive for everyone in the division.''
Collins was impressed by Kilmarnock when he watched them in midweek during the
game against Aberdeen which was eventually abandoned because of a power failure.
q.ENGLAND gained a diplomatic victory yesterday that could prove crucial to
their hopes of qualifying for the 1988 World Cup finals.
FIFA will meet this weekend to decide the format for Tuesday's World Cup
qualifying draw and favour a system based on their global rankings.
England's position of twentieth in the world and fifteenth in Europe would have
put them in the third group of seeds, with the chance of being drawn in the
same group as nations such as Germany and Italy.
The FA sent letter to FIFA and now have been told their Europe ranking will be
raised to fourteenth, which means they will be in the second group of seeds.

DUNFERMLINE have more lives than a store cat, according to manager Bert Paton's
philosophy, and it seems sound so far as his side have struggled manfully
through mixed form and a list of injuries to top players almost the length of a
pitch.
They are still, albeit on goal difference, top of the first division, but his
warning was clear yesterday when he said: ``So far, the others have failed to
kill us off, and remember, we're getting stronger.''
That strength will be necessary today when the Fifers travel to Dens Park to
take on a Dundee side who not only failed to get the three points against
Dumbarton in midweek that would have taken them top, but also have been
involved in the transfer of Morten Wieghorst to Celtic.
Dunfermline's only doubt for today is striker Greg Shaw, but David Bingham is
back. The best news for the Fifers, though, is that striker Andy Smith is back
in the squad for the first time since breaking a leg in the pre-season friendly
against Bolton in August.
``He's had three reserve games recently, but we'll probably give him another
one before his first-team return,'' said Paton. However, since playing against
Dundee in his Airdrie days was one of Smith's favourite pastimes, even a place
on the bench - he was ``super-sub'' with his former club - cannot be ruled out.
Dundee, meanwhile, have Neil McCann and Dusan Vrto missing injured, but call in
19-year-old central defender Craig Tully to the squad. Player-manager Jim
Duffy, who missed the draw against Dumbarton, also returns, as does defender
Kevin Bain after suspension.
With Barry Smith's signing from Celtic going through in time, the right back
will make his debut - interesting times, indeed, for a Dens Park clash which,
because the covers went down yesterday, may survive the overnight freeze.
St Johnstone are hopeful that their clash against Dundee United also will go on
at McDiarmid Park to allow new signings, midfielder Attila Sekerleoglu from FC
Tirol and winger Leigh Jenkinson from Coventry to show their paces.
The Jenkinson deal was completed yesterday - like the Austrian, he joined in a
six-figure deal - and manager Paul Sturrock still had to make up his mind who
would make way. Up front, he also has Roddie Grant, Derek Ferguson, George
O'Boyle, and Kevin Twaddle vying for two places.
Dundee United, with Rab McKinnon still not fit, will be along the lines of the
team who took eight goals off Dumbarton last week.
Morton are also up there battling for promotion, but they must travel to
Firhill to face a Hamilton side still keen to show that their position at the
foot of the table is false.
Airdrie travel to Clydebank, who admitted yesterday that the continued freeze
might put the game in doubt, while Dumbarton, encouraged by their midweek
performance, want to follow that up with success at home to St Mirren.

Joseph Brattisani, restaurateur; born July 8, 1908, died December 4, 1995
JOSEPH Brattisani, one of Edinburgh's most famous restaurateurs, has died after
a stroke at the age of 87. Known as ``Mr Chips'' in the city, he established
five restaurants there. He came from the second generation of an Italian
family, one of the first to come to Scotland.
Mr Brattissani's father originally opened a fish and chip shop in Stockbridge,
and his was among the first Italian families to do so.
The family came from a humble peasant background but saw their trade in
Edinburgh grow during the 1950s. They introduced generations of Scots to meals
in a restaurant environment, while also providing what was probably the staple
diet of the time - the take-away fish and pudding suppers.
Mr Brattisani was also involved in the running of a bookmaker's business in St
Andrews Square, Edinburgh. He is remembered for his visits to the early fish
market in Newhaven, later opening his betting shop, then returning to his fish
restaurants in the evening.
A well-known figure in the Italian community in Edinburgh, he regularly
attended ballroom dances, important to the Italian Scots of that era. As a
young man, he also played football for the Italian team in Edinburgh.
Mr Brattisani is survived by his wife, Evelyn, his sons Joseph, Charles, and
Eric, and daughter Maria.
His son Joseph said that his father had been in poor health for some years, but
had played an active part in Italian community life in Edinburgh in the past.

THE character actress Kathleen Harrison, who played Ma Huggett opposite Jack
Warner in the radio series The Huggetts, has died at the age of 103.
Miss Harrison's first film - Our Boys - in her long and varied career was made
in 1915. George Bernard Shaw gave her tips on playing Eliza Doolittle when she
studied at RADA - to good effect, for the Blackpool-born actress came to
specialise in below-stairs Cockney cameos. ``For years I always seemed fated to
play someone from the kitchen,'' she remarked in the 1960s.
Plays she appeared in included The Cage (1927), Night Must Fall (1935), The
Corn Is Green (1938), and The Winslow Boy (1946). She also appeared in the film
version of Night Must Fall (1937), Bank Holiday (1938), A Girl Must Live
(1939), and others.
During the Second World War she toured with ENSA in the company of Emlyn
Williams, appearing in the Coward film In Which We Serve and on stage in Flare
Path. Fame arrived with the cosy Huggett series which started in 1948 and ran
for several years. It was a spin-off from the film Holiday Camp, also starring
Harrison and Warner, who became Dixon of Dock Green.
When her old friend Coward cast her with Sir John Gielgud in his play Nude With
A Violin, which opened in Dublin, Harrison played up to her Huggett role,
moving hotels when she learned Coward and Gielgud had also booked into the
fashionable Shelbourne in Dublin as well. ``I would have been so embarrassed
with them. I don't believe in artists mixing with the big boys,'' she explained.
Her TV role as Mrs Thursday, the timorous char who became a millionairess, was
the brainchild of Lord Ted Willis and became an overnight success. The first
episode shot to the top of the ratings, gaining more than 20 million viewers
and toppling Coronation Street. But Miss Harrison also valued her roles in the
Dickens serials Martin Chuzzlewit and Our Mutual Friend, as well as films of
Oliver Twist (1948), Scrooge (1951), and Pickwick Papers (1952).
Miss Harrison was protective of her privacy, rarely speaking of her family. She
leaves her son Michael and a daughter Alice.

ARE you fed up with untidy plugs? Now for people who are thus distressed there
exists a little appliance called Park-a-plug. In fact somebody out there is
going to get one for Christmas. A handy little stocking filler. I know because
I saw one in a festive catalogue. It's a flat white plastic circle with a lip -
like a secular holy water font for one.
All you do is peel off its adhesive backing and stick it to the wall. Pop in
your plug et voila votre plug will no longer be ``a real nuisance, cluttering
up the place, and generally getting in the way''.
I have never thought of a plug as getting in the way although I know people
differ as to what constitutes clutter. I mean some people think undisciplined
bars of soap need little rubber ovals with suction pads in pastel colours to
keep them firmly in their place. Lav and order, or law and ordure, what does it
matter, as long as the loo is maintained as a place where decent people may go?
Once as a child I sat for an hour with legs dangling and my confused heart
beating hard because I could not see any toilet paper and I was too shy to cry
out for help. Finally I lifted up the dolly with the satin crinoline dress and
there it was. (Costume dramas and Delsey are synomymous now, such is the effect
of childhood toilet traumas.)
For myself, I believe a true nuisance is running out of toilet paper, and a
real nuisance is not having a bath at all. To any clean-living European a
nuisance is not having a bidet. My bathroom is too tiny for one, being long and
narrow, but could I afford the cost I would solve the problem by building a
metal wall ladder which would reach a sort of mezzanine bidet area. When
selling the flat I could proudly point it out as a special feature.
I lived in a weird but magical flat in Edinburgh once; the bedroom was
perfectly round, even the door was curved and the windows too. Stand in the
right spot and you could project your voice to win your way out of any lover's
tiff with this terrific echoing acoustic on your side.
There's a word I haven't used for years: tiff. Tiffs are an early-twenties sort
of argument I suppose. As you get older the Grand Canyon is handier for victory
in the volume fight. However at this point, tiffs were made up quickly, and
would have ended in a shared bath, except there wasn't one to share. But did we
care? Well, yes. Eventually . . .
But before I'd ever been, as it were, tiffed, I was on a student drama
expedition in Dumfries, where I stayed at my very first Bed and Breakfast. I
was a virgin to Bed and Breakfasts; and stupidly thought no-one realised - you
know how it is. So with unconvincing confidence I strode down the lino stairs,
deeply breathing in the cabbage, bleach and air-freshener atmosphere, to tell
the landlady that there was no plug in the bath.
Being a polite girl and fearing she might be embarrassed, I told her I knew it
was impossible to keep tabs on all the fixtures and fittings of even the best
kept establishments. My father owns a pub, I told her, so I'm no stranger to
the amazing things which ungrateful clients customarily nick. Not just ashtrays
and glasses, but toilet seats, mirrors, and those ballcocky things from the
cisterns . . .
She glared at me. I briefly wondered whether she was one of those anti-drink
Wee Free people about whose existence I had recently learned. I was 17 and in
my first year at university, so while I knew about the species I was still
pretty vague about them geographically. Well, I was doing English, French and
Drama, not anthropology.
(Anyway, it wasn't my fault Giffnock was a Wee-Free Free-zone. As far as I
knew.)
Helpfully, I suggested that I could pop out and buy one for her, I could easily
leave my bath until after I had explored the town. My confidence was swirling
downwards. If she could just tell me where the nearest . . . couldn't say
plug-shop because she obviously thought I was being cheeky . . . the nearest um
relevant . . . She held out her hand and there on her palm was a big black
plug, the metal triangle at its centre pointing towards me. Ten pence for a
bath, she said, with a voice the Scottish Tourist Board would have shivered at,
and please tell the rest of you. All of me's here, I thought, but I didn't say
that.
I was thinking all this as I was lying in my bath the other night for I do now
have a bath of my own and a paid-up plug, but things are still problematic. The
man who put in my bathroom messed up because he broke the overflow pipe from
the sink, and instead of replacing it - he obviously wanted to get home for his
tea - and sussing that I was no expert in these matters, asked me if it would
be alright to stopper up the wee hole. When he reassured me that this did not
mean the sink would overflow for some reason or other in a way that sounded
convincing, I reassured him back - though older I was still polite - and I said
anyway it looks much neater filled in anyway.
And he was right, the sink did not overflow, but whenever I ran the bath the
plug popped out, unless you held it down with a loofah and just stood there,
while the phone rang, as it always did. I was determined to get him back to fix
things before I spent a penny, so I phoned his firm, which turned out to be his
wife, and told them/her just that. But it seems the cheque I'd forgotten that
I'd already sent had been cashed. (This was a first for me because it's the
sending of cheques I normally forget.)
She then told me he had died in the night. I knew there was no point in saying
``that'll be right'' because I could tell from her voice that it was right. So
every time I run a bath I stand holding my loofah upright, like a soldier at a
watery cenotaph. But that's OK, because now I've got an ansamachine so when the
phone goes, as it always does, I am not missing anything at all.
Of course I should get a better, living plumber to come and sort my suite out,
but I've become rather fond of my daily ritual, my minute of silence, after the
hurly burly of sitting writing by myself. I empty my mind (having practised,
this does only take a minute), I gaze into the empty ladderless wall, and the
long bars on the window where for 10 years a roller blind was meant to be, and
I relax.
Why should I deny myself this meditative pleasure when there are so many things
I'd rather blow my money on? The wonderful thing about leafing through the
festive catalogue with its Gumball dispensers, its machines for turning
newspapers into free firelighters, its Ring Snuggies (``Ideal for slim fingers
and enlarged knuckles! No more slipping rings!'' Good grief.), the mean and
deliciously sneering delight is that although once again Christmas has come
around and slammed into your already painfully extended overdraft facility, you
can still rejoice that you're not that kind of sucker.
Not like Vogue, oh no, not like Vogue at all. I have a tip for you, never read
Vogue unless in very carefully chosen company, though I believe that reading
this festive catalogue is best done in the privacy of an unshared bath.
Otherwise, some sensible person reading over your shoulder will shout in your
ear, ``What lunatic, even if they had the money, would pay #295 for a Gold
Sequined Scarf by Nicole Fahri?'' And it's no use saying, ``Please I'm too
tired for Big Issues, would you defoliate my back?'' Or replying, ``Did you
know she is married to the playwright David Hare? You know, the Keats versus
Dylan debate?'' Or cheaply, ``Well compared to a bad day at the greyhound races
. . . Pucci and Gucci for some are as addictive as the puggie is to others . .
.'' It just won't wash.
I know a Miracle Gel-Tec Microwave ``Hot Water'' Bottle would probably generate
as much heat as a pure cashmere wrap, but I also know which would give me
better dreams. Wrapped in an amazing lightweight Thermal Throw plus a Double
Heat Sheet, I would have nightmares, as sure as eggs can be Asprey eggs. I'd
find myself in a B&amp;B, lying on a single nylon sheeted bed, the room heated by a
hundred red ladders of buzzing electric bars, my toenails catching on pink
synthetic threads, my hands over my ears to drown out the landlady screaming
from the hall; ``She's in there, she owes me #295 for the meter, and she's not
wearing a nightie!'' I would then look down to see my naked body covered with
flat white leeches, dozens of them, circular leeches each containing a
slug-plug.
Whereas, in sequined gold and cashmere, I would perhaps dream I was back in
Dumfries at 17, walking by the river with my friends, doubled up with laughter
at our mistakes that day, giggling and so glad that it was only a rehearsal.

JACK ROSE, the Hollywood scriptwriter who has died at the age of 83, was best
known for his professional association with Bob Hope.
He wrote his first full screenplay, Road To Rio, in 1947 and was credited
thereafter as being the man who gave Hope the best of the slick one-liners
which, over the years, became the great comedy actor's trademark.
Rose, a Warsaw Jew, came with his family to America to escape the uncertainty
of pre-War Europe.
They settled in Brooklyn and the teenage Rose went on to study at Ohio
University. He returned to New York where he set himself up as a press agent.
At the same time he started providing jokes for Milton Berle's legendary radio
shows of the late thirties.
This experience persuaded him to move to Hollywood where he began to provide
the wisecracking material for Hope's radio shows. The relationship continued
into movies.
Rose wrote most of his screenplays in partnership with Melville Shavelson.
The association with Bob Hope continued over the years with films such as The
Paleface (for which he provided the gags only), My Favourite Brunette, and The
Great Lover, and Sorrowful Jones. Rose and Shavelson also found time to provide
scripts for Dean Martin, Doris Day, and Jerry Lewis.
In the 1950s, the pair, not only wrote scripts, but also moved into the actual
making of movies (with Shavelson directing and Rose producing).
Their first effort was The Seven Little Foys, based on the life of the
vaudeville entertainer Eddie Foy and his performing family. Appropriately, it
starred Hope in a rare dramatic role.
Other Rose-Shavelson productions included Beau James (again with Hope); The
Five Pennies, starring Danny Kaye; and Houseboat, with Cary Grant and Sophia
Loren. The partnership split in the early sixties and Rose went on to write and
produce movies on his own.
The best - and most successful - of his later work was probably A Touch Of
Class, the 1973 London-set romantic comedy which starred Glenda Jackson and
George Segal.

THERE are a fair few seal pups bobbing around at the Orkney Seal Rescue centre
bearing what the organisers tactfully call ``double-barrelled'' names. But the
person who opens the envelope on Christmas Day and discovers that they have
adopted - and named - a seal of their own, need never know that they might have
joint custody. After all, visiting rights are open to everybody.
Adopting a seal is just one of hundreds of membership schemes and subscription
ideas throughout Scotland that could make truly thoughtful Christmas presents
this year.
It takes a little imagination and a few weeks forward planning, but you could
give your friends and family a stake in an organisation, or a sport, or a
charity, or a pastime that they support, or an introduction to something they
may enjoy doing for years. The only drawback is that a slim envelope containing
membership details or activity vouchers and maybe a photograph of Sammy the
Seal doesn't cut a great dash among the wrapped and predictable bottles of
aftershave and hairdryers under the tree; but in that envelope could be the
best present they ever receive.
The Orkney scheme costs #25, and you choose the name of the seal pup, one of
the current batch of nine who were abandoned or injured and are learning the
ropes of sea life before being returned to the ocean. You get a certificate
(bearing the sponsor's name), details and a photograph of the seal as a new
arrival, plus reports and a final photograph before the pup swims off to his
new life. Write to Orkney Seal Rescue, Dyke End, South Ronaldsay, Orkney, KW17
2TJ. Telephone 01856 831463.
DOLPHINS
n If dolphins are more your thing you may like to try the adoption scheme from
the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, who have eight of them in the Moray
Firth rejoicing in the names Jigsaw, Sundance, Bubbles, Rusty, Splash, Nevis,
Kess and Sutor. For your #15 (or #12.50 for the under 16s) you get a
certificate, colour print, window sticker and two Echo newsletters on your
dolphin's life during the year. Write to Alexander House, James Street West,
Bath, Avon, BA1 2BT. Telephone 01225 334511.
WILDLIFE
n Or try Scotland's wildlife parks or zoos for a range of animals: Edinburgh
Zoo can give you everything from a tiny poison arrow frog for #20 to a white
rhinoceros at #1100, taking in dwarf crocodiles (#120) and Macaroni penguins
(#140); the Highland Wildlife Park will give you a Timber Wolf for #280.
Or, if an animal costs more than #60 a year to feed, you can buy units at #20 a
time. Recipients get certificate, stickers, fact sheet, complimentary ticket
and newsletter, plus (for gifts over #60) a name entered on a plaque by the
enclosure. For both of the above, write to the Royal Zoological Society of
Scotland, Corstorphine Road, Edinburgh EH12 6TS. Telephone 0131 334 7730.
TREES
n Or you could plant a tree for Christmas. The Woodland Trust plants a tree in
someone's name for a mere fiver - and sends a Christmas card and certificate to
prove it - at plantations in Formonthills, Glenrothes, Fife, or East Whitburn
Mains, Whitburn, West Lothian. For #25 a group of trees are planted, and the
trust sends details of the wood plus a wallchart; and #40 also buys membership
of the trust with information gift pack, woodland directory and carved oak
``pebble'' as a present. Details from Autumn Park, Grantham, Lincolnshire, NG31
6LL. Telephone 01476 74297.
The Scottish Wildlife Trust (individual membership #15) also offers trees as
gifts; 10 indigenous Scots broadleaf trees are planted in your loved one's name
for #25 at one of their many woodland reserves ranging from Ayr Gorge, to
Carstramon Wood in the Borders, to Ballachuan Hazel Wood, south of Oban. (Other
gifts from the Trust include the #8 education pack Wild Wood of Caledon, with
video, poster and book describing Scottish woodland and wildlife, and the
Hidden Wildlife Activity Book for #2.50, uncovering the secrets of central
Scotland's animals - the Highlands are coming later.
There's also an album, Wild Conserves, which ranges from Runrig to pipe bands,
and costs #10.99 on CD and #5.99 on tape.) Details from Cramond House, Kirk
Cramond, Cramond Glebe Road, Edinburgh, EH4 6NS. Telephone 0131 312 7765.
THE ARTS
n Leaving wildlife for the arts, Scotland's galleries, museums, orchestras and
theatres are crying out for help from the public, and most have membership
schemes. The Eden Court Theatre in Inverness, for example, is running a
donate-a-seat scheme to help raise money for refurbishment and #150 (or four
instalments of #37.50) will buy you the seat (there are 568 left to go out of a
total of 800). For your money you also get a future for theatre in the town,
and the name of your loved one inscribed on a plaque in the foyer. Details from
Rhona Kirk, Friends of Eden Court Theatre, Bishop's Road, Inverness, IV3 5SA.
Telephone 01463 239841.
In Glasgow, membership of the Glasgow Art Gallery and Museums Association
(Gagma) brings private views, illustrated talks, outings, social activities,
magazines and discounts at the museum shops. A Christmas gift subscription of
#15 for individuals (#25 couples), or #12 (#15 couples) for senior citizens,
unemployed and students #5, runs until March 1997, and is accompanied by a
special edition Charles Rennie Mackintosh flower painting card. Write to Art
Gallery and Museum Glasgow, G3 8AG. Telephone 0141 221 9600.
Or buy into the history of Scotland. Membership of the Burns Federation offers
quarterly copies of the group's newsletters, the best local Burns Suppers
you'll see anywhere this January, and invitations to regular meetings and the
annual convention - this year held in Galashiels - at a cost of #12 from the
federation at the Dick Institute, Elmbank Avenue, Kilmarnock, KA1 3BU.
Telephone 01563 572469.
Or buy membership of the Saltire Society, only #15 for newsletters and regular
luncheons, talks and Meet the Scots get-togethers with like-minded folk. Write
to 9 Fountain Close, Edinburgh 1. Telephone 0131 556 1836.
POETRY
n The Book Trust Scotland has four elegant Scottish Poetry Posters, A3 size,
featuring images by Iain Cheyne, Anne Redpath, Charles Rennie Mackintosh and
Sir William Gillies accompanying short poems from Alison Fell, Sorley MacLean,
Hugh MacDiarmid and Alastair Reid; #7.50 per set from Scottish Book Centre, 137
Dundee Street, Edinburgh EH11 1BG. Telephone 0131 229 3663. Or buy a bright
children's poster showing animals busy reading in the jungle under the banner
Wild about books! for #2.
MUSIC
n Fans of Highland music could number among the Friends of Balnain House in
Inverness, a restored Georgian house on the banks of the Ness which hosts an
exhibition ``charting the history of Highland music from day one, when people
banged rocks together to make sounds, right through the ages until you have
Runrig and Capercaillie'' - visitors are encouraged to pick up and play the
pipes, harps and fiddles on display, and often go on to take lessons afterwards.
Friends (#15 individual, #25 families, #10 concessions) have free entry to the
exhibition and reduced entry to the regular concerts and ceilidhs, plus
discounts at the music and gift shop. Details from Balnain House, 40 Huntly
Street, Inverness, IV3 5HR. Telephone 01463 715757.
Good causes can make good presents, too. For #12 you could buy someone a stake
in the Highland Hospice Bonanza, a fundraising scheme which provides a vital
and dependable #7000 a year for the institution, which cares for people from
all over the Highland Health Board area. A quarterly draw gives a first prize
of #1000 and 10 prizes of #12. Write to Highland Hospice Bonanza Club, Ness
House, 1 Bishop's Road, Inverness, IV3 5SB. Telephone 01463 243132.
LESSONS
n And finally, lessons also make a wonderful present. Local music shops can
recommend singing or instrument teachers, and dance classes are springing up
all over the place. There are lots of sports packages available; three days at
Ellis Brigham ski school in Aviemore, for example, (01479 810175) costs #86 and
includes instruction, equipment hire and lift pass, although you'll have to
arrange your own accommodation through the tourist office (01479 810363).
Details from Ellis Brigham, 9-10 Grampian Road, Aviemore, PH22 1RH.
Or try the Highland Drovers package; #18 buys an adult a day driving 4x4 jeeps
and quad bikes in the Aviemore countryside (the kids can drive too, if they're
big enough to reach the steering wheel, and over-10s can go on the quad bikes;
#15 for 10 to 16-year-olds and #10 for under-10s); special rates for families
from Highland Drovers, Kincardine, Boat of Garten, Inverness-shire. Telephone
01479  831329.
Other ideas you might like to check out for yourself include horse-riding
lessons, driving lesson packages, flying lessons, balloon flights or simply
booking a 10-pin bowling lane for the evening - and that's one you can join in
with, too.

<HEADLINE>Parisian spring when students' fancy turned to riots The recent unrest in France gives Patrick Brogan a sense of dej vu, except that the half-hearted revolutionaries of 1968 seemed more intent on having fun</HEADLINE>

AH, how it all comes back. Paris in the spring. The smell of tear-gas and
Molotov cocktails in the air, the patter of tiny feet as students scatter from
the riot police, the reassuring thump of baton on skull, the clunk of paving
stones falling on the cops' plastic shields.
The chief difference, this time, is the weather. December is really not a good
time for a riot. In 1968, the first disturbances in suburban campuses, were in
early May, and the full crisis came at the end of the month.
The timing was exquisite. The sun was shining, bliss was it in that dawn to be
alive...... and when they weren't rioting, the students could sit on the
terrace of some cafe and discuss Marxist philosophy and the future of the world
to their hearts' content.
The student strikes soon spread to the transport unions and then all across
France. They included the drivers who delivered petrol to filling stations, and
to the petrol pump attendants, too, so there were no cars on the streets. It
was carnival time in the Latin Quarter, a time of sex, revolution and
rock'n'roll (drugs reached France later).
If there was any particular cause of the explosion, it was the overpowering,
stultifying weight of General de Gaulle, and overcrowding in the universities:
this was at the height of the baby boom. It was also at the height of the
miniskirt, which gave a particular delight to rioters on barricades and even to
police chasing them through the streets.
Students took over the Sorbonne and ransacked the offices of unpopular
professors, and camped in the library. They invited tramps to live in the
Odeon, a classic theatre near there, and were surprised at their insanitary
habits.
They talked, endlessly, about reforming society. They were hereditary
revolutionaries: one of their slogans was ``There are 40,000 communes (villages
and towns) in France - we are on the Second,'' meaning that they were heirs to
the Commune that took over Paris in 1871 and burned a lot of it to the ground.
They weren't, of course. Lenin would have despaired. They much preferred talk
to real revolutionary activity. 1968 was quite unlike all previous moments of
French fervour: no-one wanted to kill anyone. It was not 1944, or 1871, or 1848
- let alone 1789.
The handful of fatalities in 1968 were traffic accidents. It was a bourgeois
demonstration for the students, no more, even though they insisted that they
would overthrow General de Gaulle and all his works, and replace him with a
workers' paradise.
They believed in solidarity with the labouring classes, and were hurt and
offended when the unions declined their pressing invitations to join in taking
on the bourgeois state. The workers followed the students' example, and there
was a general strike - but it was not the strike of communist mythology. The
workers were not in the least revolutionary, least of all the communists among
them: all they wanted was the minimum wage raised.
All the same, it was a close-run thing. For a few days, the Fifth Republic was
on the verge of collapse.
The biggest of the student demonstrations, an evening affair, poured across the
Seine waving torches and threatening to bring down the government. It wended
its way to the Bourse, symbol of capitalism par excellence.
They argued with the porter who abused them through the door. He was
unsympathetic to their cause and wouldn't let them in, so they set it on fire.
Once the fire was burning nicely, they let the fire engines through to put it
out before too much damage was done. A special correspondent of the Sunday
Times carried off the tricolour that had flown over the building (it was
subsequently stolen from his office in London - some people have no shame).
Then the crowd marched along the Seine past the Louvre, but instead of
attacking the Elysee, as their predecessors had attacked the emperor's palace,
the Tuilleries, in 1871, or even the Assemblee Nationale or the Prime
Minister's residence, they simply crossed the river again and marched back to
the Latin Quarter.
The government was paralysed, fearing that the regime would fall. General de
Gaulle fled to Germany, to see his army there, just in case he needed it to
retake Paris. Then he decided that enough was enough and the whole business
must end.
He broadcast to the nation, over the radio, in his best military manner, and
that was that.
There was a huge Gaullist demo, perhaps half a million people on the Champs
Elysees the next day, and then it was high summer, time for vacations, the
strikes were settled and the students headed for the coast.
Now there were a few genuine anarchists and revolutionaries among the posturing
and preaching demonstrators. They turned up later, as urban terrorists, in
Action Directe, just as their German comrades formed the Baader-Meinhof gang
and the Italians produced the Red Brigades. But we didn't hear about them for
several years.
The French authorities learnt their lesson. The most damage had been done and
the best barricades built with the paves, granite blocks weighing about 2lbs
each, that had surfaced the roads of Paris for generations.
The moment the rioters had left on vacations, municipal workers were out
tearing up the paves from the Boulevard St German, the Boul' Mich' and all the
other streets of the Latin Quarter, to replace them with tarmac - an inferior
road-covering but much less dangerous. This year, the barricades are much less
solid than those of 1968, thanks to those hasty road-works.
The French economy took years to recover from the concessions made to get the
general strike called off, and the French educational system was thrown into
turmoil, which continues.
As for the general, he came up with an elaborate reform plan, designed to make
people happier at their work. He offered it in a referendum the next summer,
was defeated, and promptly resigned. In due course, the rioters became
respectable and rose to the tops of their various professions, including the
government.
One of the favourite slogans chanted in 1968 was ``This is just a start - keep
up the fight!'' It was all theatre, and very exciting, too. This year's effort
doesn't look like the real thing, either, but it does look much less fun. It's
too cold - and o sont les minis d'antan?

UNTIL yesterday we knew one thing, for certain, about the circumstances under
which Labour, in power, would use the discretionary taxation powers of a
Scottish parliament.
The devolved power to raise or lower basic rate income tax in Scotland by up to
3p in the pound is one thing, Labour spokesman after spokesman kept telling us.
But using that power is quite another matter, they would intone, without
pausing for breath.
That oft-repeated rubric was designed to do two things. It ensured that Labour
and its Convention partners could be seen to have imposed on a Scottish
parliament some fiscal responsibility for the decisions it would take.
Even 3p in the pound would raise no more than #550m a year, compared with a
current Scottish Office budget of more than #14,000m. Or, as Tony Blair put it
in his Herald interview, less than 5% of the total. But to have included no
fiscal powers at all in a constitutional settlement would have opened the
devolution side of the argument to charges of creating a toothless, client
assembly, dependent on Whitehall for everything it did.
The rubric's second aim was to still latent fears that a Labour-controlled
parliament in Edinburgh would use those powers to the hilt at the first
opportunity. Not to give away 3p in the pound to Scottish taxpayers, but to
impose it. New Labour, after all, is determined to be seen as ultra-responsible
on tax.
That line of argument - power to tax one thing, using said power quite another
- served well enough until Michael Forsyth became Scottish Secretary and
started turning up the heat on what he dubbed Labour's tartan tax.
Let there be no doubt that the Forsyth assault on the tartan tax has hurt
Labour. As Chancellors of both persuasions down the years know only too well,
pennies up or down on the basic rate of income tax have a symbolic significance
in British life out of all proportion to the actual sums involved.
For someone on average earnings, with taxable income of #12,000 say, a 1p
change in the basic rate means #120 more or #120 less in their pocket over a
full year. But, in terms of direct publicity value, no other taxation measure
is anything like as potent.
As the most publicity-conscious Scottish Secretary in the history of the office
drummed on daily about the ruinous tartan tax, Labour found its established
rubric on the issue crumbling at the edges. Privately, a number of Scottish
Labour MPs readily concede they would get off the tartan tax hook if they
could. But a complete U-turn on taxation powers for the assembly would be
another gift for Mr Forsyth.
Short of a U-turn, Labour's shadow Scottish team has gone on repeating the
power-to-tax-one-thing mantra, hoping against hope that the tartan tax jibe
would become time-expired. It hasn't. If anything, it has grown in potency with
time.
The only thing left for Labour to do was to further refine the rubric, to
define more clearly and precisely the circumstances under which the party would
seek to use that devolved taxation power. When my colleague Ben Brogan and I
went to interview the Labour leader Tony Blair in his rooms at Westminster on
Thursday morning, that was the subject at the top of our list.
Mr Blair, we were both convinced, came up with two significant refinements to
Labour's assembly tax plans. The first is that Labour will accept the
``political obligation'' to put to the Scottish electorate, before each set of
assembly elections, any plans it has to use these taxation powers during the
life of that parliament.
As Mr Blair put it to us: ``Taxes will only go up if the people vote for
them.'' That, in itself, represents a significant hardening of Labour's
approach. If the use of the 3p in the pound power is to be subjected, in
advance, to the democratic mandate of the Scottish electorate, some of the
force of Mr Forsyth's tartan tax allegations is undermined.
But the Labour leader said something else, at least as significant. He said:
``There will be no tax raised at all unless the party goes into an election
promising it and succeeds. We have no plans to do that, never mind anyone
else.'' He went on to say that that meant that all the fears stirred up by Mr
Forsyth were ``completely misplaced''.
Maybe I have failed, down the years, to absorb the real nuances of political
speech. But who, reading that, would fail to conclude that Labour is not
planning to raise taxes in the first term of a Scottish parliament, the words
with which we started our front-page story in yesterday's Herald?
Yet Mr Blair and his office now say that is not what he meant. Why? I can think
of only one substantive reason. It is that, by being seen to say publicly that
there are no plans to raise tax in the assembly, he is seen to be dictating
some of the terms, from London, for the first Labour assembly manifesto in
Scotland.
That may not play well with his shadow Scottish team, led by George Robertson.
It may play even less well with a Scottish Labour Party which, in recent years,
has regarded itself as a major player in an increasingly federal party
structure. Hence the charges of misrepresentation, repeated in Alastair
Campbell's letter to today's Herald.
Only one question remains. Did Mr Blair plant the seed deliberately, despite
the subsequent denial? Or did he, in one unguarded phrase, reveal his private
strategy to defuse Mr Forsyth's tartan tax bomshell, then, when upbraided by
some in his party in Scotland, attempt to backtrack?

THE Scottish National Farmers Union is backing moves by the Meat and Livestock
Commission to make the public aware of what the meat industry sees as the facts
about BSE, and the issue will be debated at the Scottish Grand Committee in
Edinburgh on Monday.
The commission is to spend more money this weekend out of its annual #42m
budget in a bid to reassure the public that beef is safe.
In national newspapers, it will be continuing with its ``consumer reassurance
message'' and, in an unprecedented action, is to circulate its 13,000 members
with the latest available information.
The moves show how the meat industry is concerned about threatened public
boycott of beef products and, possibly, even beef.
SFU president John Ross said the farming and meat industries were aware of
widespread public confusion over the consumers' understanding of what is
happening in the beef production system and how it might affect consumers.
He said that Scottish farmers were proud of their reputation as producers of
high quality beef. ``Like farmers throughout Britain, we have given complete
support to Government regulations which deliver the most ultra-precautionary
measures to protect public health,'' he said.
``We are no less concerned about alarmist media reports than the rest of the
public. But the facts, the scientific research, and evidence don't give any
cause for concern about eating beef or beef products.''
At Scottish NFU headquarters, they were maintaining that the message that must
be conveyed to the public is that beef is safe and that there is no scientific
evidence to link BSE with the human disorder Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (CJB).
The Scottish Office maintains that BSE is ``a declining problem with no proven
link to CJB''.
Jim Arbuckle, a leading light in the SFU's beef producing area of Aberdeen and
Kincardine, has called on scientists to pronounce that British meat is safe.
``We need scientists to come out and and speak up for the industry.''
Within the industry, new efforts are being made to decide who should be
responsible for the expense of disposing of specified bovine offal (SBO), the
parts of cattle carcases that are deemed to be unsuitable for any processed
product. It is estimated that the meat industry faces a #23m-a-year bill to
meet stringent health requirements - equivalent to #7 on every beef animal sold
at auction.
Slaughterhouse operators, livestock auctioneers, and cattle producers cannot
agree on who should foot the bill for SBO disposal since the Government has
said it is a problem for the industry to resolve.
In a bid to ease the situation, MLC chairman Don Curry has agreed to act as
independent chairman of a working party involving the Scottish Association of
Meat Wholesalers, the Institute of Auctioneers and Appraisers in Scotland, and
the Scottish Federation of Meat Traders' Associations. It is understood that Mr
Curry had a meeting with Scottish meat industry leaders yesterday.

General Dmitri Antonovich Volkogonov, military commander and historian; born
Anita, Eastern Siberia, March 22, 1928, died Moscow, December 6, 1995
ONE of the most difficult problems facing any society is creating a worthy new
order out of a thoroughly disreputable old one. This was the situation facing
Germany and Japan, for instance, at the end of the Second World War. It is the
morass in which Russia is still toiling as it struggles to get rid of the past
that Lenin, Stalin, and Brezhnev bequeathed to it. And as so often, success
depends above all on the perception and courage of a handful of individuals.
At first sight, General Dmitri Volkogonov must seem an unlikely candidate to be
accorded such an accolade. Revolutions are made by dissidents like Andrei
Sakharov or politicians like Mikhail Gorbachev. Born in 1928, Volkogonov was a
professional Red Army officer from 1949, and for a time he was its senior
propogandist. He served Stalin who had orphaned him when his father was shot in
1937 and his mother was sent to die in the camps. And in Brezhnev's time he
rose to be head of the establishment's Institute of Military History.
Yet Sakharov worked on Russia's bomb and Gorbachev sat in the Politburo.
Society has to use the material it finds. In Volkogonov's case he looked back
on 1941-1945 as the Great Patriotic War; and although he remained ready to
defend his country, he could not in the end do the same for its leaders.
Ironically it was his gradual rise to the institute that gave him access to the
archives that documented the terror though which Stalin had orphaned millions
of other Russians. It was his reflections on these revelations that drove him
back to examine the dictatorship that Lenin established in the name of
scientific Marxism and caused him to question Soviet communism.
And it was Breznev's refusal to sanction publication of his critical biography
of Stalin that led him to work quietly but effectively to help create the
atmosphere in which Gorbachev could emerge as proponent of reform. Gorbachev
authorised publication in 1988.
For outsiders who long knew the catalogue of Stalin's misdeeds it is not easy
to appreciate the impact of Volkogonov's tale. But inside the Soviet Union it
prepared the ground for the banning of the party three years later. His
subsequent biography of Lenin infuriated many communists by turning their
patron saint into a devil but left them powerless to do anything but protest;
and his forthcoming history of the Soviet Union may well complete the
demythologising of Marxism.
The progress of reform turned Volkogonov into at least a semi-politician. He
was elected to the Congress of Deputies in 1990 and to the Duma in 1993, and he
worked steadily to try to bring the liberal reformers together. He became one
of Yeltsin's advisers and eradicated Marxism from the armed forces. In fact, he
had finally become his own man, supporting the storming of the White House in
1993 but opposing the invasion of Chechnya in 1994. On his death Yeltsin issued
a public tribute, while his parliamentary colleagues stood in unusual silence
to honour his passing.
But the purging of the past is far from complete. A new election approaches.
The liberals are divided. Yeltsin is unwell. The Communist Party has been
resurrected and is gaining credibility. And there are some communists who would
now ban Volkogonov's works. However, their new leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, does
not appear to be among them. Perhaps he realises, like most others, that
Volkogonov has done what had to be done. He has exposed the past for what it
was and enabled his countrymen, communists included, to get down to the
long-drawn-out and often frustrating work of creating a better society.

I NOTE that a group of Labour MPs, headed by Clydesdale's Jimmy Hood, had
tabled a Commons motion criticising Dover Tory MP, David Shaw, and inferring
that in pursuing the Monklands affair he is neglecting his own constituents
(December 2).
It is typical of the West of Scotland Labour Party, and the group of MPs known
colloquially as ``the Jimmies'', that they should seek to intimidate one of the
hardest-working MPs in Parliament.
David Shaw is an accountant and a leading expert in local government finance.
For three years he has been of considerable assistance to local Conservatives,
and others of no political persuasion, as we have attempted to get to the
bottom of the Monklands affair.
That is no easy task from the outside, looking in on a Labour council group
which is riven by dissention.
As chairman of Monklands West Conservative Association it has become obvious to
me that David Shaw works very long hours in advancing the cause of the party,
not only in connection with Monklands, and I deplore the tactics which Jimmy
Hood and his friends are about to adopt.
Against the sort of background which prevails in Monklands, the Scottish Labour
MPs supporting Mr Hood may well find that they have bitten off more than they
can chew.
Indeed the exercise of harassing David Shaw may prove to be counter-productive.

<TEXT>
IN the past 10 years we have witnessed various food scares involving eggs,
shellfish, cheese, and even a well-known brand of mineral water. Some of these
scares were based on fact and the sector concerned acted quickly and
efficiently to resolve the matter. Other scares were initiated by prominent
public figures (many with a second agenda) or tabloid media creating a public
issue without a shred of factual evidence. The current BSE debate is most
definitely in the latter category.
The fact remains, BSE is a disease of cattle not humans, and although a similar
disease occurs in humans - Creudtzfeldt Jakob Disease - (not the ``human
equivalent'' as popular myth would have it) there is no scientific evidence to
demonstrate a link between the two. Since BSE was first identified as a disease
affecting cattle, there has been a massive effort by farmers, supported by the
Government, to identify the causes and to eradicate the disease. The industry
has an excellent track record of dealing with such problems and the continuing
drop in BSE cases indicates that the present programme is very much on target.
While this eradication process continues, there is considerable independent
work being carried out to establish whether there is any risk to human health.
None has been found.
We are fortunate in Scotland that our beef herds are relatively unaffected by
BSE. There is a worldwide demand for Scotch beef which is still increasing -
for example our exports to Europe have expanded by 300% in the past five years.
Consumers - at home and abroad - are demanding more information on the source
of their beef and in Scotland we have established quality assurance schemes
from farmer to retailer which are the envy of the world: full traceability from
point of consumption to source of primary production.
Our customers can continue to purchase and enjoy Scotch beef with confidence -
confident that it is a quality article reared and processed to the highest
standards of health and hygiene. When coupled to flavour and taste, that means
that Scotch beef can take its place in a healthy and balanced diet.
Responsible consumers retain their faith in our product. It is a pity that
certain scientists and the tabloid media have not listened to the facts.

RECENTLY the word "fudge" has been much used to describe the peace process in
Ireland.
But this word is confusing. For many, especially the English, it has pleasant
associations since it is also used by them to describe a sweet confection which
in Scotland is usually called tablet.
Perhaps there is indeed a connection between fudging an issue and sweetness.
However, our strict Scottish ancestors probably decided that our language

ABOUT your report, ``Tragedy of parents who give life and death'' (December 4),
I was a teacher in special education for four years. I object to the parents
having all this guilt laid on them. God gives life and death.
The genetic disorder was responsible for the illness or death not the parents.
I object to them being branded as ``carriers'' by geneticists. We are talking
about people not animals.
One in a million is very rare and testing all relatives is ethically and
morally questionable, as is the whole issue of gene therapy.
Did they agree? How much pressure is being put on parents and relatives by
geneticists and medical advisers? Babies and children are not guinea-pigs.
I object to Jeans for Genes Day. Who thinks these Health Days up anyway? Such

James Barrett Reston, journalist; born Clydebank, November 3, 1909, died
Washington DC, December 6, 1995
IF a model of the emigre Scot was needed James Reston, who has died of cancer
at the age of the 86, might have provided it. If, meanwhile, an exemplar of the
immigrant yielding to none in devotion to his adopted country was sought, the
columnist known for 50 years at the New York Times simply as ``Scotty'' would
have been the man.
James Barrett Reston, born in poverty at Clydebank as the second son of a
machinist, became an American only at the second attempt. His family emigrated
when he was a toddler but returned to Scotland when his devoutly Protestant
mother (who entertained hopes of his entering the Church) became ill. When he
was 11, however, they tried again, moving to Dayton, Ohio, where an
all-American life commenced.
It led to Reston breaking some of the biggest stories around, altering the face
of American newspapers, winning two Pulitzer prizes, and becoming, with Walter
Lippmann, the most influential journalist of his day, a print institution who,
as its Washington bureau chief, lent the Times the aura of omniscience that
still allows Manhattan's grey lady an influence greater than her readership.
``I think newspapering is important,'' he remarked, ``to say nothing of being
fun. It not only involves a man in the struggles of his time, thus keeping him
from going to sleep, but gives him the opportunity, unmatched by the university
or the law, to write on the big issues when people are paying attention.''
Reston, who avoided retirement until he was 80, began with small matters,
however. A poor student at the University of Illinois, he majored in journalism
but secured top grades only in sports reporting. In 1931 he was taken on by the
Springfield (Ohio) Daily News as a sports editor at $10 a week.
Declining to linger, Reston in 1934 found himself a position with the
Associated Press in New York. In 1937 the agency sent him to London with a
brief granted to few, then or now: to cover ``sports'' in the summer and the
Foreign Office during other seasons.
In 1939 he joined the New York Times, signing on the day Hitler's troops
marched into Poland. The salary of $85 a week was enviable, but so little
thought did the home office give to its latest hiring that when his first
by-line appeared it followed newspaper tradition and got his name wrong.
He had a good war nevertheless. Matching in print what Edward R Murrow was
doing in broadcasting, Reston helped to shift American public opinion to
Britain's side with his coverage of the Blitz. Like Murrow, he had a ringside
seat from which to observe London's devastation, and his despatches did much to
end American isolationism.
It was after the war, however, that Reston came into his own. As chief
correspondent for the Washington bureau of the Times from 1953 to 1964 he put
himself, in American parlance, ``in the loop'', with matchless contacts, an
acute historical sense, and a fine discrimination of when it was (and was not)
appropriate to unleash the clout of his paper.
By that time he had won his first Pulitzer prize, having been tipped off in
1944 of plans being laid at Dunbarton Oaks for the United Nations.
Reston had the entire story, and parcelled it out over a week in a series of
exclusives. In 1956 his coverage of the presidential elections won him a second
Pulitzer.
He was by then a nationally-syndicated columnist, having begun a thrice-weekly
column in 1953 that was to continue until 1987. His career was briefly marred
in 1968 by a spell as executive editor of the Times, a job for which he had
neither aptitude nor appetite, but from 1969 to 1974 he served as a
vice-president of the paper, an institution within an institution, holder of
the Legion d'Honneur, recipient of the CBE, the Norwegian Order of St Olav, and
the Chilean Order of Merit. Meanwhile, he introduced America to the concept of
the ``op-ed'' comment page.
His influence led to criticism that he pulled his punches. Reston played down a
report of plans for the Bay of Pigs assault, for example, and ``spiked'', at
JFK's request, an exclusive account of the Soviet missiles being sited on Cuba.
The charge was that he had ceased to scrutinise the Establishment and had
become part of it.
In 1980 he replied: ``If you spend your life as a hatchet man - and there's
something to be said for that - then eventually you find that everybody's out
to lunch when you call. You're left with your opinion. I wouldn't like that
because my own opinions aren't that good.''
He was rarely so disingenuous. Of Nixon and Watergate, for example, Reston
recorded the verdict: ``There is scarcely a noble principle in the Constitution
that he hasn't defended in theory or defied in practice.''
But it was of his adopted country that the emigre spoke with love. Interviewed
in 1991, he said: ``In the 50 years that I've been working here there is no
country in the history of the world that has done so much for the human family
as this country has.''
He is survived by his wife, three sons, and five grand-children.

HUGH McLoughlin, like many apologists for Irish nationalism, is strong on
rhetoric but rather weak on the facts (December 1).
In the Irish Republic in 1923 there was one Protestant Cabinet Minister and 14
Protestant MPs. Now there is no Minister and only two MPs.
The census of the population of Ireland, taken in 1881, shows that there were
17,660 Methodists; in 1981 there were 5790. In 1881 there were 56,498
Presbyterians; in 1981 there were 14,255.
In 1881, 317,576 people were members of the Church of Ireland; in 1981 members
totalled 95,366. Over a 100-year period during which Irish nationalism has been
the major force on the island, approximately three out of four Protestants had
fled the Republic.
Should Mr McLoughlin be in any doubt as to the major ingredient in stampeding
Protestants out of the Republic, I suggest that he invest in some history books.
With regard to the Jewish community in the Republic, the record of the state is
appalling. Mr McLoughlin opines that the treatment of Jews in the Republic ``is
to the credit of Eamon de Valera''. The facts tell a different story.
Attempts by Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution to get asylum in Ireland
in the 1930s and 1940s ran up against an official anti-Semitic policy which saw
Jews as a ``potential irritant in the body politic'' and as having
``disproportionate wealth and influence''.
In 1939 Mr de Valera turned down requests from both Mr Bob Briscoe, the only
Jewish Fianna Fail TD, and the father of Mr Gerald Goldberg, later to be a
Jewish Lord Major of Cork, to grant asylum to a German Jew who jumped ship at
Cobh. The man was returned to continental Europe where he was arrested and put
in a concentration camp although he managed to survive the war.
The Irish ambassador who served in Berlin from 1932 to 1939 claimed in his
report to Dublin that ``Jewish emigrants in the countries which they have been
permitted to enter have created, and are creating, grave moral scandals and are
a source of corruption of the populations among which they dwell''.
The Departments of Justice and Industry and Commerce, headed by Mr Gerry Boland
and Mr Sean Lemass respectively, strongly opposed any entry of Jews into
Ireland even after the full facts of the Holocaust were known.
A Department of Justice memorandum on the admission of refugees from the
continent, dated September 24, 1945, had a section on Jews which read, ``The
immigration of Jews is generally discouraged. The wealth and influence of the
Jewish Community in this country appears to have increased considerably in
recent years and there is some danger of exciting opposition and controversy if
this tendency continues.''
I would submit that the record of the Irish Republic with regard to its
Protestant and Jewish citizens is not one to be proud of.

JUST for a change let us look at Europe beyond the self-interest of one
political party in the United Kingdom and see the prospect of a single currency
as perceived by most of the EU's member states. Those in favour are all in the
D-mark zone, unworried by the prospect of the great single currency adventure
ending in tears. For them there won't really be any nasty consequences if
economic and monetary union (Emu) turns out to be a bird that cannot fly.
Theirs, after all, is the kingdom of monetary peace, with or without the single
currency. The D-mark rules, and that is an end to it. How else can you explain
why, for example, 75% of the Dutch support the idea of a single currency, as a
poll showed yesterday? This debate is more about pragmatism than brute
economics among the EU member states who do not share the British
Conservatives' hang-ups about national sovereignty.
But what of the French? They are the real players in this increasingly tense
game. France has been forced to recognise that German economic power really
does rule. France knows its economic self-determination has long since been
lost to Frankfurt. Opting out of Emu would solve nothing. Opting into Emu,
however, would give France shared control of Europe's monetary destiny. It
would give Paris a voice and a vote in the boardroom of the European Central
Bank which would be the French way of winning the political battle after losing
the economic one. Britain please note. This is why Chancellor Kohl and
President Chirac remain close on the Emu issue and why Chirac is prepared to
test the will of his resentful workforce on behalf of Emu's demanding
qualification criteria.
Emu will consign the Bundesbank to history. The Germans stand to be outvoted
and their influence limited, if not neutered. Why, therefore, does Chancellor
Kohl insist that the single currency is the holy grail? Because, of course, he
is a genuine European, and one who carries history on his German back. He wants
a vibrant Europe with a strong currency and a powerful, wealth-producing
Germany embedded politically and economically in a Europe safely distanced from
Russia which is, in turn, why he wants new EU buffer states to the east. That
way, he believes, lies permanent European peace and prosperity. Those who still
cling to romantic notions of British sovereignty being essential to monetary
power might reflect on the fact that there was a time, not so long ago, when
the pound bought 10 D-marks. Now it buys two. Next question, please.

THERE should be little surprise over the IRA's latest outburst about
surrendering weapons. It is a well-worn tactic, another example of their
brinkmanship skills, a talent they have sharpened since last year's ceasefire
and a talent being exercised by every grouping in Northern Ireland.
The timing is important here. Bill Clinton has returned to Washington,
strengthened in his election campaign by the fortuitous a
Intransigence is not the exclusive property of the IRA, however. Loyalist
defiance on giving up arms is as strong as ever and Senator Mitchell is
unlikely to find any chink in their wall of resistance. So, after the explosion
of optimism around the Christmas tree in Belfast's Guildhall Square last week
the hardliners are quickly back to the business of manoeuvring for position and
avoiding loss of face. The people of the province have shown astonishing
resilience over more than 20 years of terrorism. Their patience and courage
deserve greater reward. Senator Mitchell must be at his disarming best to find
a form of words that will satisfy the gunmen. Perhaps a few words from
President Clinton's address in a West Belfast factory would bear repeating to
all sides. ``Engaging in honest dialogue is not an act of surrender, but an act
of strength and common sense.''

THIS week saw the start of the cold spell in Scotland; well they said it would.
We had all those chaps predicting that the country would be awash with cold
fronts from Siberia. We are never sure about predictions: we are aghast at
nonsense about far-away countries. Siberia might be cold and Scotland certainly
is. But we doubt that cold winds from the Steppes result in anything quite as
miserable as the bleakest corners of the industrial belt.
There are those who are happy in this. After all, Scots can't complain much.
They had a wonderful spring with balmy breezes, a summer which demanded girls
in white dresses and an autumn with a leaf left on a tree enough for O'Henry's
short story The Last Leaf. It is, rather like all O'Henry stories a bit
fleeting, a bit slight, a lot important. It was about a dying girl in the
mid-winter. There is some romance about mid-winter, and a touch of melancholy,
and O'Henry got it right. Sadly British weather forecasters do not seem to find
the right note on the matter of cold weather, and indeed many Scots freeze on
this too. The fact is that a cold winter is natural to Scotland and we should
all look forward to it, the way we enjoy hot summers. Blazers and white ducks
in summer are spendidly contrasted with Dents gloves, cashmere scarves, and
Crombie overcoats in the white freeze of the first season of the year.
It is somehow good to be back in winter. Doubtless readers look forward to
coats out of the cleaners, and cheery children with faces red with frost and a
decent bottle of sherry at a fireside. And then spring, and summer, and even
autumn. But Siberian cold is welcome. Comfort in the frost.

CONSERVATIVE politicians complain that the reason for their poor showing in the
polls is that they are not getting their message across, the problem being the
packaging not the product.
There is one issue on which I think the Tories are genuinely not getting their
message across, and that is on the subject of a devolved legislature for
Scotland as proposed by the Constitutional Convention.
One one hand Michael Forsyth and other Scottish Ministers have told us that
such a parliament would be a disaster for Scotland. They have predicted another
Albania, a jobs holocaust, and a stampede of jobs across the Border.
On the other hand Michael Forsyth tells us that such a devolved parliament
would create a slippery slope resulting in the restoration of Scottish national
independence by 2002.
I can only take this to mean that a devolved parliament will be so successful
and popular that voters will demand more and more powers for it.
Which of these predicted outcomes are voters supposed to believe, the jobs
holocaust scenario or the slippery slope scenario? They appear to be mutually
exclusive.
If the devolved parliament is a disaster, there will be no popular demand for
additional powers for it and no slippery slope, instead perhaps a demand for a
return to centralised government from Westminster.
However, if indeed there is a slippery slope, it will have come about only
because it was seen as a success by a majority of the electorate.
Mr Forsyth cannot have it both ways. Would he please get his message across?

UGH Dougherty's Tale of two Hughs sounded familiar, although my wife and I had
a good excuse - our son was born on my birthday.
In the early years we became known to family and friends as ``big'' and ``wee''
Bruce respectively, that is until ``wee'' grew into ``big'' (we're both 6ft
5in).
In correspondence we thought we would overcome the problem by each using our
middle initial, but few replies are received in like fashion; the only time
Junior has the monopoly is on St Valentine's Day.
My advice to Hugh Sen is to encourage Jun to change direction at university and
study medicine, divinity, or such profession that carries a specific title.
Bruce C, studying medicine, has been warned not to take such steps as would
cause him to revert to Mr, although presumably by that time he will be living
at a different address.

HIGHLAND LEAGUE
ELGIN City have made a double signing swoop for two Fort William players.
Keeper Billy Neilson and club top-scorer Alan Moir will both make their debuts
in today's Highland League tussle with on-form Wick at Borough Briggs.
The pair were among five Inverness and Aberdeen-based players put up for free
transfer after Fort William admitted they could no longer afford to pay
travelling expenses.
Experienced defender Billy Skinner is Elgin manager Chico McHardy's next
target, but Clach and Forres are also chasing his signature.
Neilson will replace off-form keeper Dean Lawson, while Aberdeen University
student, Moir, could prove the perfect foil up front for Iain Polworth.
Clach have a welcome rest this weekend, but will give fringe players a chance
to step up their challenge for a first-team spot during a reserve outing.
Nairn County entertain Buckie Thistle, who tore Elgin apart in a 4-1 win last
weekend.
In the game of the day, leaders Huntly travel to play Qualifying Cup champions
Fraserburgh, while title-chasers Cove face unpredictable Rothes.

Mr Blair made the point, as he has many times before, that though Labour has no
plans to raise tax the programme of the Labour Party will be put forward by the
Scottish Labour Party at the time of the elections for the Scottish parliament.
Nothing more. Nothing less.

IT would be sad if the report (December 4) contrasting the treatment of the
Third World workers who make sports shoes with the obscene amounts of money
paid to sports stars for wearing them simply left us with a sense of guilt when
it is positive action that is really needed.
Manufacturers are always telling us they respond to consumer demand: it is time
we started telling them that the injustice suffered by Third World workers is
unacceptable.
It may mean that sports shoes will cost a bit more, but if it means better
health and a fairer deal for the workers it is surely a price worth paying.
What better time than Christmas to be making a point that could bring good
tidings to the poor?

<TEXT>
DARREN Gough's tour to South Africa was under a new cloud last night after he
limped out of England's attack with a knee injury in Paarl.
On a day when Jack Russell again could do little wrong by scoring a century,
Gough pulled up in pain during his fourth over and played no further part as
Boland reached 129 for four in reply to the tourists' 402 for eight declared.
The Yorkshire fast bowler's Test place is already under threat following a
disappointing performance during the Johannesburg draw. And now Gough must not
only show some decent form over the last two days of this match but prove he is
fit enough to warrant a place in a four-man attack when the series resumes at
Durban next week.
``We want to see Darren bowl here,'' said manager Ray Illingworth. ``If we play
a four-man attack in the third Test we couldn't risk one not being fit.
``The injury is a concern but we should have a better idea about it tomorrow
after he's had a night's rest.''
While not much is going right for Gough, Russell has found the Midas touch. A
world-record 11 catches in Johannesburg was followed by his rearguard action
with Mike Atherton to save the second Test.
Now he is celebrating his highest first-class score, the fifth century of his
career, and a second hundred in England colours - six years after having made
128 not out against Australia during an Ashes Test at Old Trafford.
The home side lost four wickets yesterday before the close, with Terrence
Lazard stumped by Russell, Lloyd Ferreira bowled, Kenny Jackson taken bad and
pad, and Bryan Baguley caught at third slip.
England 402-8 dec (R C Russell 129 no, R K Illingworth 57 no, G A Thorpe 56).
Boland 129-4.
q.NASSER Hussain's England A team had to battle hard yesterday in Peshawar to
protect their Test series advantage.
Put into bat after having lost the toss, Hussain's side made sound progress in
the hour's play possible before a lunch interval extended to accommodate
holiday prayers.
But in the afternoon session, batting became more difficult as Pakistan A
seamers Shahid Nazir and Athar Laiq began to swing the ball. ``Seam bowlers
like to use an older ball here because they can get reverse swing,'' sid the
England captain. ``It was reverse swinging both ways here and it made for the
trickiest session we have yet faced on this tour.''
Hussain, Anthony McGrath, and top scorer Nick Knight all fell lbw to the
swinging ball after Akram Raza snapped up Jason Gallian.
q.SHANE Warne moved within sight of a double century of Test wickets as Sri
Lanka struggled to 251 all out on the first day of the first Test against
Australia in Perth. Warne claimed three Sri Lankan wickets and lift his Test
haul to 198.
q A 50-run partnership between Chris Cairns (32) and Roger Twose (44) took New
Zealand to 179 for four in their first innings at lunch on the second day of
the one-off Test in Christchurch as they replied to Pakistan's total of 208.
Stephen Fleming's was the only wicket to fall in the session, stumped for 25.

THE EU has agreed to impose a tax, of #30 a tonne, on wheat exports for the
first time in 21 years. The aim is to safeguard Community supplies by making it
more difficult for farmers to sell on the world market where demand is high.
Auction profits up
RISING livestock prices helped Scottish auctioneer John Swan &amp; Sons increase
interim pre-tax profits to #279,000 from #193,000. The number of lambs handled
at the company's auction yards in Edinburgh and Newtown St Boswells was static
during the six months to October 31 but there was a small increase in the
number of cattle sold.
Arable payments
SCOTTISH farmers will receive a further #64m in arable aid payments over the
next few days. Early payment of about #38m was made in October to 2800 farmers
in the North-east as a response to flooding problems. Agriculture Minister Lord
Lindsay said the pay-outs were considerably earlier this year.

THAT'S it. Ready. . . aim . . . fire! Stirling, kindly extricate yourselves
from the Glasgow set-up if that's what you want. And Glasgow, take a leaf out
of Stirling's history, and embrace the need for some provincial rugby to lead
the way.
There's a solution, and it includes stipulating in black ink that you play for
the province in which you live, and no other.
And the provinces play in Europe. That's the only way to stop players from
moving to England.
If they move to England, then they miss out on European rugby. Read on.
Let's not muck about here. All these high level meetings between the current
``big'' clubs in Scotland are all about how to get money at the expense of the
districts. It has nothing to do with protecting the poor little clubs against
extinction, it's about getting the big clubs into Europe so that they can get
the cash.
In an effort to keep sweet those who don't make it, I am convinced that those
that do will offer to divvy up the cash. Whatever, the money paid to the
provinces when they play in Europe must, in turn, go to the clubs who provide
the players.
I am a big fan of Stirling County Rugby Club. It has become the modern Hawick
in a way. Unlike Hawick, there's no feeder system in the town, but I well
remember Brian Edwards at the start of the season saying that he wanted
Stirling to become, in effect, a provincial side.
And it has. Frankly, however, I find it a farce that you can have five County
blokes in a Glasgow side playing a load of County blokes in a North and
Midlands team. If the SRU, or the provinces only had the bottle, the Stirling
County lads would have to play for a stipulated team. Whichever doesn't matter,
so long as it's just the one.
Where does that leave Glasgow? Well, this little old place should get its
little act together and lay down the foundations for success. That means
getting a team into the first division as soon as possible, and generating a
real city identity which means that if you don't live in it, then you can't
play for it.
Glasgow has a few options. The city could, on the one hand, go to the SRU and
say that they were going their own way by setting up a regional league based
around Glasgow, but there would be two teams put forward for the existing
Premier Leagues - Glasgow North and Glasgow South, which would be selected by
the existing clubs.
I like that idea. I've always liked the two-finger approach. We keep West, GHK,
Accies, Hillhead Jordanhill, Kilmarnock, Ayr, Glasgow Southern and all the
others. They would play each other regularly. It would be fearsome stuff. But
would the North and South teams get support?
On the other hand, West of Scotland, who own their own ground, could hold the
key if they were willing to give up their identity, sell their ground, and use
that money to kick start a Glasgow North team that, again, would be selected by
the feeder clubs and take over the West of Scotland fixtures. Clubs like GHK
would survive, and try to stay in the Premier Leagues.
The third option, and the most likely, is to swallow the medicine and accept
that the current league format is here to stay, and if Glasgow wants a team in
the top division, or maybe even two teams, then some amalgamations have to
happen. Hard, hard medicine.
There's no doubt that clubs are the bedrock of Scottish rugby, and they always
will be. Glasgow immediately must get all of the clubs around the table to sort
out what it is going to do, and then spend the summer training its players as
never before. But there has to be a step up from club level for our players
before they play internationals, and it's the success or failure of the
international team that counts in all of this. And, being a Glasgow chappie,
what matters is the success or failure of the Glasgow side and the city's clubs.
I don't think we're a boot in the nether regions away from a good domestic set
up, even though it takes a statistician's brain to look ahead the way you have
to.
Europe will be exciting, and I think it is plainly unreasonable for the clubs
to want in. Scottish provinces, possibly even joint provinces, must take on the
Baths of this world.
For they are provinces too.
It's up to Glasgow what they do now. The smiling and joking has to stop. Get
the clubs round a big table to get strong clubs and a strong city. The
provinces have to go into Europe, and you can't play for a province unless you
live in it.
It's how Glasgow get clubs into the first division that's the big question.

n THE garden is dank with rotting vegetation and the skeletal remains of
summer's flowers. What better time for getting dug into a gardening book which
mixes advice and information with delightful pictures? Molly Ephraums's Easy
Borders is just such a book - with the additional lure of offering insights
into ``high performance plants for low-maintenance gardens''.
Ephraums's aim is to remove the drudgery of traditional borders with their
labour-intensive requirements. Since she writes from experience of her own
cottage garden in Angus, Scottish readers, used to taking the advice of
southern tomes with some scepticism, can be sure the information relates to
local conditions.
Ephraums started the restoration of her derelict cottage garden 25 years ago.
The remains of its two herbaceous borders affected her then ``in much the same
way as two abandoned strays would affect a devoted dog-lover''. Canine analogy
apart, she has an endearing habit of referring to border plants like children
of varying degrees of naughtiness and good behaviour. Her reports cards are
candid: ``Beautiful they might be but their manners left a great deal to be
desired . . .''
For her the secret of successful borders lies largely in using the correct
plants. Perhaps she overemphasises the problems of unruly vegetation but she
also describes the joys of finding something unusual, like old varieties of
dianthus or double primroses.
Her advice on design includes defining freestanding beds by using a hose pipe
which can be staked out into all sorts of curving shapes; and much else
besides, from general cultivation to the use of weed gloves (a touch sinister,
the last). All this, however, is mere preparation for herbaceous planting plans
for various situations and colour schemes.
Her poolside planting - illustrated in watercolours - looks delectable with
hostas and primulas and astilbes among its range of 18 easy perennials in
shades of pink and blue and white. A golden trollius gives contrast. There's
also advice on pond maintenance.
There are illustrated plans for a variety of herbaceous borders, some involving
shrubs and summer bulbs as well as perennials, and a plant directory -
illustrated this time with colour photographs. Plant lists - showing height,
colour, and flowering season - plus a list of useful addresses pad out this
slim charmer of a book.

THE name has nothing to do with Sardines. Legend has it that when the ancient
Greeks first mapped the Mediterranean, the island looked like a footprint - the
Greek for which was Sardinia.
Those Greeks were among many early visitors. The Carthaginians and Phoenicians
have left tangible evidence of occupation. The Spanish planted vines. Lord
Nelson, recognising its strategic importance, tried unsuccessfully to buy the
island for #500,000. Later, Sardinia allied with the Piedmont region to build
the foundations of the modern Italian State.
It has, however, remained a backwater. At least nine hours by ferry from the
Italian mainland, an hour by air from Rome, it is as remote as Shetland is from
Lowland Scotland. And do not be put off by D. H. Lawrence's petulant
observations in Sea and Sardinia: ``Nothing to see. Sights are an irritating
bore.'' He could hardly have been more wrong.
Around 500BC and earlier, there lived a race called the nuraghi people. We know
as little about them as we know about the Picts. They lived in circular stone
towers - also nuraghi - resembling Scottish brochs, with which they share
several architectural features. There are some 7000 on Sardinia: most ruined,
some undergoing meticulous stone-by-stone restoration.
The nuraghi people had a hierarchy too: the royal palace at Su Nuraxi is one of
the most impressive sites.
In more recent times Sardinia was put on the map by the Aga Khan. In the early
1960s his yacht was hit by a sudden Mediterranean storm and anchored in a
sheltered bay on the north-east coast. Impressed by the clear sea and pristine
white beaches, he built a holiday villa. News spread among the jet-set. A hotel
followed, a marina, a golf course, another hotel . . . and, because the sea is
more green than blue, the area was dubbed the Costa Smeralda, the Emerald
Coast.
A consortium was formed to monitor development along careful environmental
guidelines and today it is one of the world's most upmarket resorts.
Elsewhere, Sardinia slumbers in a time warp. Only in recent years have those
scourges of the visitor, the brigands of Barbagiaolollolia, abated their
activities. Earlier this century travellers dared not visit the mountains of
the inhospitable interior. Kidnapping was rife, usually of the children of the
rich and famous. To encourage prompt payment of ransom, parts of the body were
sent, beginning with the ear lobes.
Community support for this activity has waned. On the last occasion, some years
ago, the entire population of the town of Oliena hung white sheets from their
windows in protest.
St Efisio is the patron saint of Cagliari, Sardinia's capital. On the first
Sunday in May, every year since 1656 (apart from two cancellations because of
world wars) the city celebrates his feast day.
Thousands line the streets as a procession of traccas (floats) decorated with a
riot of flowers and pulled by oxen trundles through the town. Bands play.
Finally an ornate gilded coach carrying the saint's effigy makes its majestic
way out of the city and along the coast road to the chapel dedicated to Efisio.
It causes a traffic jam which looks impressive even by our motorway standards.
Sassari, Sardinia's second city, holds it cavalcata a fortnight later. A
horseback race as spectacular as Siena's Palio is followed by a procession in
which every village on the island is represented in vivid traditional costume.
From Cagliari's tiny station the Trenino Verde (Green Train) climbs for 120
miles through mountains of oak and chestnut, arriving after nine hours and 35
stations at Arbatax on the east coast. Built in the 1890s as rural transport,
the narrow-gauge track is reminiscent of a fairground rollercoaster, with
fantastic gradients, tunnels and bends. The elegant carriages of polished wood
and brass are normally pulled by a diesel, but on occasion the engineers' pride
and joy is given an outing. The little black steam locomotive Goito was new in
1896.
Farther north - if you can drag yourself away from those immaculate beaches and
uninhabited rocky coves - is the province and town of Nuoro. It is home to
Sardinia's chief ethnographic museum. The collection of folklore is
comprehensive, but lacks hands-on appeal. Much more intersting, we thought, is
the tiny museo degli strumenti popolare Sarda at Tadasuni.
Giovanni Dore has collected 450 traditional instruments and he can play them
all. Many are percussive: strange contraptions of wood and string. A curious
drum producing ultra-low frequencies was once used as a weapon of war between
local tribes.
There are accordions ancient and modern. The traditional pipes of Sardinia,
lauddas, typically consist of three reeds: two short ones played by the fingers
and a longer one functioning as a drone. They take a lot of puff, so later a
tartan-covered bag was added and the zampogna bears a striking resemblance to
our own bagpipes. I could not place the tartan, however . . . the McSard,
perhaps?
Music featured on our final Sardinian excurison. From the Capo d'Orso, named
from a bear-shaped rock on the northern tip of the island, we sailed through
the scattered islets of the Maddalena archipelago. Gari-baldi, the Italian
patriot, had his holiday home on one. With Corsica on the horizon, we anchored
off a beach of white sand enclosed by a ring of pink porphyritic rocks set in
an emerald sea. A quick dip is followed by lunch on deck, then the crew produce
accordions and treat us to some Sardinian sea shanties. Bellissimo.
n Getting to Sardinia is easier now that Meridiana, Italy's largest private
airline, has introdicued ten direct flights per week from London Gatwick to
Cagliari and Olbia on the Costa Smeralda. Return flights cost #239-295,
depending on season. Its London office is on 0171 839 2222.
Accommodation: some hotels on the Costa Smeralda are among the most expensive
in the world. Off-season (May and September) they are more affordable. Good
value is the Hotel Capo d'Orso; half-board per person per day #35 low season,
#68. Agriturismo, B&amp;B with a local family, is beginning to catch on. It is run
by the Women's Co-operative of Sheep Breeders and B&amp;B costs about #12 per
night, though there's a minimum stay of seven days. Contact the Coop

UNLIKELY as it may sound to people who know me, I have, in the interests of
this column, been running for Rembrandt . . . in the New York Marathon no less.
It was all a mistake, of course, and could well have ended in disaster.
I was to be in New York on holiday when Sotheby's were showing a magnificent
selection of 122 Rembrandt etchings which span the artist's career and are of
the very highest quality; the sort of collection art lovers will travel a very
long way to see.
The etchings could only be viewed by appointment so I arranged to see them on
the afternoon of Sunday, November 12, at Sotheby's premises in E 76th Street.
Imagine my horror when I turned up on 3rd Avenue and found my way blocked by a
solid stream of puffing, sweating, blank eyed marathon runners.
More than 27,000 people were taking part in the New York Marathon and my route
to the Rembrandts was bisected by them.
``How do I cross the road? I've an appointment over there at two o'clock,'' I
complained to a policeman who merely shrugged and said, ``Can't stop the
marathon for you, ma'am.''
Then, out of the crowd of spectators came my saviour, a tall young man with a
mop of wild curls. ``I'll run you across,'' he said.
``Run me across?''
``Yeah, take my hand and run with me and we'll get across.''
``I'm scared,'' I said, eyeing the runners, a phalanx of bodies, pounding
shoulder to shoulder along the street and none of them looked prepared to stop
for anything.
``They'll run over the top of me.''
By now the cop was in on the act. ``If you run with them, and cross bit by bit,
you might do it,'' he said, and before I knew what was happening, I was running
across the avenue, hanging on to the young man and dodging marathon runners.
We made it without incident and when we reached the other side, he shook my
hand, wished me a good day and disappeared.
The exhibition was worth the effort for it was easily the finest collection of
etchings I have ever seen.
All 122 of the works were brought together with infinite care and
discrimination over a period of 20 years by a Dutch collector called Joost R.
Ritman. He is a supplier of utensils to airlines but his business has hit a bad
patch and he has been forced to put his cherished Rembrandt collection up for
sale.
The etchings will not be sold individually but as a complete collection and the
price is in the region of #20m.
In the interest of alerting serious collectors with that sort of money,
Sotheby's have been touring the etchings very discreetly - some of them were on
view in London and in the Hague, but it was only in New York that they could
all be seen together.
Nancy Bialler, director of Sotheby's Old Master Prints Department in New York,
says there is already serious interest from several private connoisseurs who
want to buy the collection which matches in quality works held by the British
Museum or the Rijksprentenkabinet in Amsterdam.
The etchings give a panoramic view of the work Rembrandt did throughout his
life - biblical scenes, landscapes, genre scenes, portraits, nudes and
still-lifes.
Among the ones that particularly pleased me was a tiny scrap of paper, an
etching of a sleeping puppy, done around 1640. Also impressive was a portrait
of Clement de Jonghe, dating from 1651, which bears in the top left hand corner
a distinct thumb print of the artist.
The star of the show was the largest picture in the collection (383 x 447mm), a
drypoint etching entitled ``Christ Presented to the People, the Ecce Homo''.
This picture was bought by Ritman at Christie's London auction of prints
belonging to the Duke of Devonshire in 1985. He paid #580,000 for it. Nancy
Bailler reckons it is worth around #1m today.
When he bought, Ritman went for quality and from time to time he was able to
buy duplicates of certain prints, done on different sorts of paper or vellum
and when they are displayed side by side, the variations caused by the
different types of paper are clear to see.
He also sought out rarities like one of the few erotic prints Rembrandt ever
made. Called ``The Monk in the Cornfield'', it shows a monk and a peasant woman
caught in flagrante delicto.
Bailler was amused by the reactions of solemn art lovers reverently viewing the
selection when they came across this one - ``They always do a surprised second
take,'' she says.
It is thought that Rembrandt got the idea for this etching from an engraving by
Heinrich Aldegrever entitled ``The Monk and The Nun'' but he stripped it of its
anti-Catholic, pro-Reformation message and left only the erotic.
Rembrandt was superb at portraits and prominent in the selection on show were
two stunning examples of self-portraiture - one of himself in portly old age
and the other of him as a young man with wildly curling hair and a dashing look.
When I saw it, I stood back in surprise and said to Bailler: ``That could be
the young fellow that ran me through the marathon.''
It was uneerily like him. That's a plot for a story now, isn't it?
n Coincidentally, Rembrandt also figures in a major exhibition being staged
until January 7 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Entitled
``Rembrandt/Not Rembrandt'', it displays works by the artist with others that
were once attributed to him but have now been assigned to his pupils or
emulators. Several works that were once thought to be by Rembrandt have been
shown to be by other hands by the use of X-radiographs, cross-sections, and
autoradiographs. Museums and collectors must be shaking in their shoes.

BRITAIN'S Laura Davies set herself up to finish an already fine American season
in a blaze of glory when she teamed up with Mardi Lunn from Australia to win
their first-round match by 4 and 3 against Americans Michelle McGann and Donna
Andrews in the Diners Club matches yesterday in Palm Springs, California,
writes John Ball.
In today's semi-finals, the Commonwealth pair take on Julie Inkster and Betsy
King. Should they win again, the $250,000 prize for the winning side would seem
to be within their grasp.
Davies has won $2.25m since she joined the American tour in 1987 and she has
won twice over here already this year.
``Curiously, I do not like matchplay competitions very much,'' she said.
``Once, in Spain, I was 17 under par for four rounds and still got beaten. It's
frustrating although I always enjoy playing in the Californian desert.''
It certainly seems so, as she smoothly stroked in four birdie putts between
five feet and 25 feet for a score of 32 on the outward nine, at which point her
opponents were four down and with little to look forward to. Scores (USA unless
stated):
Regular tour - T Lehman and D Waldorf beat K Triplett and S Stricker, 1 hole; B
Tway and S Verplank beat D Duval and D Austin, 2 holes; K Perry and J Huston
beat T Kite and B Andrade, 2 and 1; J Gallagher and S Lowery beat P Azinger and
P Mickelson, 2 and 1.
Women's tour - K Robbin and T Green beat J Lidback and A Dibos, 3 and 2; N
Bowen and A Sorenstam (Sweden) beat B Daniel and M Mallon, at 19th; L Davies
(Britain) and M Lunn (Australia) beat M McGann and D Andrews, 4 and 3; J
Inkster and D Mochrie beat B King and V Skinner, 1 hole.
Seniors tour - R Floyd and D Eichelberger beat A Palmer and J Nicklaus, 3 and
2; D Stockton and H Irwin beat T Weiskopf and I Aoki, 2 and 1; J Colbert and B
Murphy beat J C Snead and G Gilbert, 2 and 1; G Archer and D Douglass beat C
Rodriguez and M Albus, 1 hole.
q A DISASTROUS 8 at the 470-metre, par-4 second at Vila Sol yesterday cost
Scotland's John Chillas a share of the lead at the halfway stage of the Algarve
Land of Golf Pro-Am finals in Portugal, writes David Bryden.
The Glenbervie player battled back to finish four behind leader German Garrido,
of Spain, who carded a two-over-par 74.
Antonio Sobrinho, of Portugal, and Spain's Manuel Vargas were one off the lead
on 75.
In the Stableford team event, Glenbervie were the leading Scots team with 76
points, six behind leaders Club de Campo, with Hilton Park on 73. The second
round of the 36-hole tournament is being played today at Palmares.

DERBY, December 9 - The Jacobites have turned around. After getting to within
130 miles of London, Prince Charles Edward Stewart has been forced by the fears
of his Highland chiefs to return to Scotland.
The clansmen left Derby in a hurry three days ago. Tonight they are already in
Manchester where they were met by a violent mob. They quelled it with a show of
force, and exacted a fine of #2500 on the town as punishment. The money was
raised in cash by the merchants, but a platoon sent to collect it was fired on
as it crossed Salford Bridge.
Later, a sniper narrowly missed Colonel John O'Sullivan, quartermaster of the
Jacobite army. It was all a stark contrast to the apparent welcome the
Highlanders received when they passed through on the way south only last week.
The sudden retreat took place after several days of intricate military
manoeuvres against a background of seething discord in the Jacobite camp as the
Scots' qualms about going on grew. The brilliant tactics of their general, Lord
George Murray, had created a gap and let them slip in between the two English
forces trying to intercept them, from the west under the Duke of Cumberland and
from the north under General George Wade.
After leaving Manchester, the Highlanders had reached Derby in a two-day march
on December 4. At that point they were about the same distance from London and
Cumberland, who had got as far as Stafford. They could move faster than the
royal army, and an open road seemed to lie before them.
Still, the Scots' nerve broke. The only intelligence they had was of another
force concentrating against them at Northampton, and of the militia preparing
to defend the immediate approaches to London.
They also knew that the mob in the capital was militantly anti-Jacobite. For an
army of 4500 clansmen to break through and seize it seemed a hopeless task. The
fact that next to no English recruits had joined them clinched the chieftains'
decision to go home.
None of this could easily have been suspected when the Highlanders reached here
five days ago. The Duke of Devonshire, Lord-lieutenant of the county, had fled
before them from his house at Chatsworth, and many leading citizens followed.
Derby was taken by a Jacobite vanguard of just 30 cavalrymen, without
resistance. On the contrary, the people rang bells and lit bonfires in an
effort, familiar from all the other captured towns, to humour the clansmen and
prevent looting.
A corps of 150 lifeguards led by Lord Elcho and several of the chieftains
arrived next. Then came the main body of soldiers under the Duke of Perth,
carrying their standards, accompanied by their pipers, and by a carriage full
of Jacobite ladies.
All looked happy and confident, but reactions among onlookers were mixed. One
thought them ``lousy, pitiful-looking fellows''. Another said their speaking
Gaelic made them sound like ``a herd of Hottentots, wild monkeys in a desert,
or vagrant gipsies''.
The remaining city fathers were forced to parade on the market square in their
robes of office while King James III and VIII was proclaimed. Only then did
Prince Charles appear, at the head of his rearguard. As usual he was on foot
and as usual he made an impression even on those hostile to him. Amid a lively
and curious crowd, he went to his lodgings at Exeter House.
During dinner he assured his officers that ``the people of England, as is their
duty, still nourish that allegiance for the race of their native princes which
they are bound to hold sacred, and if I do but persevere in my daring attempt,
Heaven itself will fight in my cause''.
The next morning, December 5, told a different story. The prince, about to
leave Exeter House with his bonnet on his head, was suddenly accosted by Lord
George Murray, who blurted out that it was high time to think about what they
were doing.
Charles asked him what he meant, if not to march on. Lord George replied that
most of the chiefs thought differently. He ushered the prince back into his
lodgings. In an oak-panelled drawing room on the first floor, an impromptu
council of war was called.
It produced a showdown. All the doubts the Scots had harboured ever since
leaving Edinburgh boiled up. Murray made plain they were against marching on,
for reasons even better than he had given at Carlisle, Preston and Manchester.
One was lack of English support. If a Jacobite party existed in England, they
ought to have heard something from it, at least in the way of money or
intelligence or advice. Nor was there word of the promised French invasion
across the Channel.
Murray asked Charles for documentary evidence that anyone in France or England
was going to help him. The prince could not provide it.
Murray turned up the pressure with information he had from a captured spy of
the British Government, that the clansmen were surrounded by 30,000 men in
three armies, each twice the size of their own. To reach London, they would
have to meet at least one of them, and were bound to suffer heavy casualties
even in defeating it. They would still have the militia to deal with, before
going on to subdue a panic-stricken city of a million people.
If the prince thought this could be done, he was obviously being swayed by
advisers who, as officers in the service of France, would be ransomed if taken
prisoner. The Scots, on the other hand, would be executed as traitors.
According to eye-witnesses, Lord George looked Charles in the eye and summed
up: ``The Scots army have done their part. We came into England at your
request, to join your English friends, and to give them courage by our
appearance to take arms and declare for you publicly as we have done, or to
join the French forces if they landed. But as none of these things has
happened, certainly 4500 Scots never thought of putting a King on the English
throne by themselves. So my opinion is we should go back and join our friends
in Scotland, and live and die with them.''
Murray then asked the other members of the council for their views. The three
most influential chiefs, Donald Cameron of Lochiel, Alexander MacDonald of
Keppoch, and Ewan MacPherson of Cluny, agreed with him, as did even the
prince's Irish adviser, Sir Thomas Sheridan. Only the Duke of Perth and Sir
William Gordon dissented.
Charles was stunned. Until this meeting, he had assumed the only question was
how to get to London as fast as possible. According to Lord Elcho, ``he fell
into a passion and gave most of the gentlemen that had spoken very abusive
language, and said that they had a mind to betray him''.
He did not at this stage give up but, with the help of Sir John MacDonald,
spent most of the day lobbying his officers in favour of continued advance. In
the evening, a fuller council of war was reconvened. On his side the prince had
Colonel O'Sullivan and his secretary, John Murray of Broughton, with the Dukes
of Atholl and Perth and Ranald MacDonald of Clanranald.
In a final effort to win over the rest, he revealed the latest news of the
landing at Montrose by Lord John Drummond, as commander in Scotland over the
forces of the King of France, with 800 men and several times that number
expected shortly. But this did not go down as he hoped.
The other Scots took it as a further and better reason to return to the defence
of their homeland. They assured Charles that the Highlanders could march 20
miles a day. At that pace they would outstrip Cumberland. Once past Preston
they might reckon on reaching the border with their army intact.
As the arguments went on, Murray called in the English spy whose information he
had earlier quoted. Under questioning this man, Dudley Bradstreet, stuck to his
story that 8000 or 9000 troops were lying in wait at Northampton. Prince
Charles, who was listening from a side room, burst in and shouted: ``That
fellow will do me more harm than the Elector's army.''
He turned to the council and said: ``You ruin, abandon and betray me if you
don't march on.'' Then he walked out and slammed the door. But the council's
mind was made up. Later the prince informed Murray: ``In future, I shall summon
no more councils, since I am accountable to nobody for my actions but to God
and my father and therefore I shall no longer either ask or accept advice.''
In the freezing dawn of ``Black Friday'', December 6, the Highlanders began
their retreat, though this was at first unknown to them. As the bagpipers
played reveille, they thought they were marching onwards. They knew that the
bridge over the River Trent at Swarkeston south of Derby had been secured by a
vanguard of 80 cavalry.
But then the clansmen were ordered back the way they had come. An officer,
James Maxwell of Kirkconnell, said: ``They began to suspect the truth, and
seemed extremely dejected. All was sullen and silent on that day.''
The prince left two hours later, mounted on a black horse. For the first time
he was riding rather than marching with his men. Lord George Murray followed in
command of the rearguard.
The change of strategy was so unexpected that the Duke of Cumberland did not at
once grasp what was happening. He believed a retreat impossible because it
could be cut off by Wade, and decided this was just another of the Jacobites'
manoeuvres. Since his soldiers were exhausted by their own, he let them rest.
Even two days later the duke expected the clansmen to turn south again. Still
trying to get between them and London, he set out with his cavalry and a
thousand infantry mounted on borrowed horses. These have now started the
pursuit, but they represent only a fraction of Cumberland's troops and it will
take the rest some time to catch up. The Highland army may therefore well
succeed in getting back to Scotland.
The news of its retreat has been received with immense relief in London. The
reports of panic heard by the Jacobites were true. The spy's story of a fresh
army at Northampton was a fiction. Only the militia, bolstered by a few
regiments of regulars, defended the capital.
Most of its citizens thought an attack imminent. Guards had been posted in the
streets to keep order. There was a run on the Bank of England, which it could
only slow by issuing its reserves in sixpences. Many people packed their
valuables and prepared to flee. The King was reported to have a yacht moored
ready for his escape at Tower Quay.
Once again rumours circulated that the Prime Minister, Henry Pelham, and his
brother, the Duke of Newcastle, were about to switch sides. Some Jacobites out
in the country did actually start to raise men, but the encouraging messages
they sent to Prince Charles at Derby only arrived after he was gone.
Now the most cheering thing to the Hanoverian authorities is the realisation
that he cannot after all have been acting in concert with the French. He would
have carried on if he had been certain an invasion across the Channel was
coming.
The threat of one remains, but the initiative has now clearly passed to the
British Government for the first time. The man about town and son of a former
Prime Minister, Horace Walpole, said: ``No one is afraid of a rebellion that
runs away.''

YOU are that Dancing Queen. You are the Lady in Red. Or at least you may quite
possibly believe you are following a few lethal cocktails at the office party.
For, dearie me, the season of frenetic festivity is upon us once more.
Sadly all attempts to outlaw these potentially disastrous ordeals have
floundered. Work in any environment where the staff exceed one in number, and
some bright spark will insist on arranging a Christmas night out. You know this
is dangerous. Propriety evaporates in direct proportion to sobriety. But a
refusal does offend; so there is no easy escape. You simply have to put on a
brave face (plenty of eyeliner, lashings of lipstick), thrust your best high
heel forward, and - like poor old Gloria Gaynor - insist: ``I will survive''.
Tomorrow, you can search for a miracle hangover cure. Next week, you can
address that trusted agony aunt with the worrying details of any amorous
indiscretion. But your first, pressing priority has to be choice of attire.
Full combat gear. Nothing less will do.
What's cool for Yule in party dressing? The new rule is simple. But sexy. You
may fall for the rock chick chic of a lean-fitting shirt with boot-leg flares.
Perhaps you'll be bewitched by the silver screen allure of a bias-cut frock.
But the real sensation of the season is satin. Taffeta is taboo. And sequins
are out. So untie those straight-laces (which help you maintain a certain
9-to-5 decorum), and slip into something slinky. The fool-proof formula for
night-time glamour this Christmas? Don't glisten - just gleam.

LET there be light. That's how creation starts in most of the genesis stories.
Yet whether light was created by a deity or by the natural wave motion of
photons, it is the fundamental basis of all life. Without it, plants would not
grow, supply us with oxygen and they would not feed the rest of the creatures
of this earth.
Light has fascinated man since he was able to think. Primitive humans made up
tales about the lights in the sky while they sat in the light of their fires.
We use light in fibre optics to communicate around the globe, and to peer
inside the human body. We need it to see where we're going.
It seems however, that animals, and primitive ones at that, have been using
light a whole lot longer than us. Scientists call it bioluminescence, the
natural organic light that living things are able to generate, whether they are
bacteria, bugs, or fish. Now scientists are using advanced techniques to adapt
that light for the greater good of mankind.
In particular, one Aberdeen academic, Professor Ken Killham, has devised a way
of using natural light as an organic toxic contaminant detector which seems to
work better than anything so far devised.
Killham's as happy as a NEWT, which is the acronym for his Novel Ecotoxicity
Water Test which has attracted #500,000 in funding from BBSRC in conjunction
with Yorkshire Water Services and Siemens Environmental Systems. It's based on
the use of the BBB's, which sound like an extension of the brigade, but are in
fact bioluminescent bacterial biosensors. They can be used to cast a light on
pollution and thus make it easy to identify.
As the picture shows, he's turned the old Chinese proverb around. It now reads:
``Many lights make hands work.'' The hand in question is covered with
light-emitting bacteria, shining powerfully enough to let the wearer read a map.
``Genetic modification involves cloning genes from naturally luminescent marine
bacteria,'' Killham says. ``We take the genes and clone then into organisms
which don't naturally shine. In the terrestrial world there are very few
luminescent organisms, because there is little advantage in creatures emitting
light, except for fireflies and glow worms. But in the sea there are many
species of animals, right down to bacteria which produce their own light and
glow in the dark of the deep.
``The amount of light they emit tells us how happy they are. They are
definitely not happy when the water is polluted and shine much less. If light
output declines, it allow us to predict possible contamination.
``At the moment it's very difficult, costly and time-consuming to test whether
a water supply is toxic. But in mere seconds, our system will tell you how
toxic the water is. It's a simple matter of measuring the light. If it's
dimmer, then there's pollution. It tells us, literally, if the shit has hit the
fan.''
Frontiers likes a scientist who tells it the way we can understand.
``Not only that, but we can fix the lux genes to other genes which are involved
in the breakdown of specific toxins. That allows us to make our little bacteria
target specific. If we clone the light genes with the toxin finders, the
bacteria can be programmed to find heavy metals like lead, or mercury and other
poisons in water. That lets us produce a biosensor that tells you whether
there's lead in the water for instance, or even in soil. The bacteria attach
themselves to the metal molecules and then they light up. All we have to do is
measure the light. Basically, in a general situation, we look for less light
for overall contamination, or brighter light from some bacteria which pinpoints
a poison.
``It's very fast indeed. We can take a sample of water, mix in some of our
bacteria and know immediately how toxic it is.''
Killham says the genetic modifications which clone the marine bioluminescent
gene on to a terrestrial bacteria were carried out at Aberdeen University's
Molecular and Cell Biology department under colleague Dr Anne Glover who's the
senior lecturer in the department.
``The gene was put into a whole host of different bacteria,'' he says.
While Killham says that the biosensor bacteria can tell when the solids have
hit the punkah, sewage detection is a little more tricky, because while much of
sewage is pollution, it is not toxic. He does assure us, however that the
biosensor can be designed to pick up the traces of that too. Good news for
beaches. Good news for us all.

IF District rugby is mostly about exposing the country's top players to a
higher grade of competition, then there has to be something wrong with a system
which allows the likes of Gary Armstrong and Derrick Patterson to languish on
the bench.
When the South play North and Midlands tomorrow at Kelso, Gary will be a
replacement, with Bryan Redpath in the side, and when the Exiles come to
Glasgow ``Deek'' Patterson is benching, and Andy Nicol is on from the start - a
reversal of their roles when the Exiles played Edinburgh on Wednesday night.
It may well be that the South plan to rotate their two scrum-halves as well,
but with the country's four top scrum-halves battling for places in two sides
and, obviously, with a couple of them destined to act as spectators for 50% of
the championship, I just cannot see how that fits into the plan to have the top
players in regular, meaningful action throughout December.
That scrum-half situation is the most glaring example of what I'm talking
about, but there are other instances all over the shop. For instance, if they
were all fit, then the South would presumably want to give Tony Stanger, Graham
Shiel, Scott Nichol, and Del Bain a run at centre. Obviously, they can't all
play.
I'm a fan of district rugby, and I believe that the championship is important
in its own right but, on the wider front, if the master plan is to get all the
top players - internationalists and cap hopefuls - into meaningful competition
in the run-up to the Five Nations tournament, then the current system is not
working.
I haven't got a clue as to the answer, but there may be some pointers to be had
from the system that New Zealand are adopting for the new International
Provincial Competition.
The NZRFU want to make sure that all of their top players are involved, and
basically what will happen is that the union will have a list of contracted
players who will be allocated to the hybrid teams which will take part in the
tournament.
Obviously, the district unions over here would not take kindly to that sort of
interference from higher authority but, maybe, it is something that could be
looked at.
Another aspect of the district set-up which needs examination is just who is
eligible to play for whom. The situation, as it stands, is just chaotic. For
instance, Stirling County is part of the Glasgow set-up, but we are also
eligible to play for North and Midlands. That's been great for North and
Midlands, but not so good for Glasgow.
I've chosen to show a bit a loyalty and stick with Glasgow, but I'll not be
playing tomorrow against the Exiles because I've got a knee problem which is
taking longer than I had expected to clear up. I received a knock when we
played against the Barbarians and since then, the knee swells up whenever I
train or play.
I am receiving treatment from the SRU doc, Jimmy Graham, and, fingers crossed,
I should be OK for our crunch premiership game against Heriot's next weekend.
Last weekend, against Boroughmuir, I was delighted to get a couple of tries and
go some of the way towards answering the critics in the media and elsewhere. I
also enjoyed playing at fullback. Craig Sangster has been playing really well
at full-back for us, and it was my first time there since the Scotland tour to
Argentina last year.
Basically, though, it was just good to get a decent performance under my belt
and, hopefully, once Jimmy has worked his medical magic, that can be maintained
next week against Heriot's and beyond.

ANYONE who knows me well will admire the restraint with which I have,
uncharacteristically, shown in only now, at this comparatively late stage,
discussing Christmas. I love Christmas. In fact, it is my best time of the
whole year. I begin to anticipate Christmas about June, and I love the shopping.
I realise by now, to those who don't know me, I must sound like a raving
lunatic. We are beset with statistics of the great numbers for whom the very
mention of the word Christmas induces stress. That, combined with the increase
each year in the commercialisation, tends to produce a collective moan at the
thought of the festive season.
This is tragic, and so much can be done to decrease any rising panic felt by
those who don't anticipate Christmas with the same glee I do. I am convinced
the major reason for such anxiety is the thought of planning and cooking meal
after meal over a period of time when the house will be full of family and
friends, and when entertaining is expected too.
You tend to read so much that is unhelpful about preparing food over Christmas;
in truth, there is a vast amount to be prepared in advance, at your comparative
leisure, and the results frozen. There are two prerequisites to this: that your
freezer has a good clear-out - a task I loathe - to make space for all you are
about to cook and freeze, and that you make a list of what you need to take out
of your freezer, and when, to allow sufficient thawing time.
The anguish I have felt on the odd occasion when I have forgotten to take out
of the deep freeze a vital dish, or the stuffing for the turkey, can only be
imagined. The answer is to live by the lists. I can't rely on my memory at the
best of times, but over the Christmas and New Year season there are just so
many things to remember it is endlessly reassuring to have lists to refer to,
and they should be pinned or stuck in a prominent place.
Christmas lunch or dinner, if you have roast turkey as your traditional main
course, is the easiest and simplest meal of the year - providing you have made
and frozen the stuffings and the bread sauce. None of these deteriorate with
freezing, and I thaw the stuffings in good time to let me stuff the turkey,
prepare it for the roasting, and wrap it in its foil all on Christmas Eve.
I plan to discuss this with you on the Saturday before Christmas Day. The point
of a stuffing is two-fold; to provide a substance which complements the taste
of the bird, and to provide flavours which infuse the meat. We always have two
stuffings - one recipe I give you today - and the other is made of white
breadcrumbs with half the weight in suet, well flavoured with finely chopped
and sauteed onions and plenty of grated lemon rind and chopped parsley - I use
flat leaved parsley for maximum flavour. When you pack your stuffings into poly
bags it is vital to clearly label the bag with the contents - you always think,
when you put something into the freezer, that you will never forget what it is,
but it is frightening how quickly an object assumes total anonymity once frozen.
However fashionable cranberries are, roast turkey would not be complete without
accompanying bread sauce. We are bread sauce fanatics in our family; indeed, I
have a cousin who feels so passionately for this humble fare that,
post-Christmas, he takes bread sauce sandwiches on long walks! I prefer my
bread sauce hot, and, if not with roast turkey, with grilled sausages. But it
must be well made.
For this you need day-old baked bread, as opposed to steam sliced bread which
will result in glue-like sauce. You need, for my taste, 1!s-2 pints of full-fat
milk and one skinned onion, stuck with several cloves. Salt and add a good
grinding of black pepper. The contents of the saucepan should be brought to the
point where the milk forms a skin and then the pan taken off the heat and left
to cool, when the onion and cloves will infuse the milk with their flavours.
I then stir in the breadcrumbs, about 6-8oz and before freezing the sauce I
fish out and throw away the onion. If you cut about 3oz of butter into small
bits - easy when the butter is hard - and stir this into the bread sauce you
will find as it reheats on Christmas Day the butter improves the texture and
taste. Allow 36 hours to thaw the sauce. It can be frozen in a well-buttered
ovenproof dish, needing only to be put into the oven, once thawed.
This amount is suitable for a 12-15lb turkey:
3lbs best quality sausages with as high a percentage of pork meat as you can
find
2 onions, skinned and very finely chopped
2 tablespoons oil - I use olive oil, but sunflower would do instead
A couple of pinches of thyme and plenty of freshly ground pepper
1lb chestnuts - the vacuum packed ones are almost indistinguishable from fresh,
and much less bother. Avoid dried chestnuts which, even after days of
reconstituting, still manage to have the taste and texture of cardboard, but
tinned chestnuts would do.
Slit each sausage with a sharp knife and peel off the skins. Put the sausages
into a large mixing bowl. Saute  the onions in the oil till they are soft -
about four mins - then cool completely. Mix all the ingredients together with
your hand. Mix thoroughly, then pack into a polythene bag. Label and freeze.
Allow 36 hours to thaw. Make sure it is completely thawed before stuffing the
turkey.

THE whole process began innocently enough. A few seeds pressed into a pudgy
childish hand by an old woman. No cow was handed over and no beanstalk
appeared. The seeds produced a blaze of wall flowers that licked their way up
the front of our house.
Friends and family admired the display. My interest spread to a small
strawberry patch and then to vegetables and flowers, and I spent long summer
evenings pottering beside my mother in our over-large garden.
Puberty and a friend's cruel remarks about the potato heads on Gardener's
Question Time conspired to draw a veil over my interest. I couldn't risk guilt
by association. Worse even than being accused of nurturing a prurient interest
in root vegetables, was the accusation of being boring.
The truth is it's never been boring. Not just the wonder of nature stuff;
sowing the seeds, growing the seeds, and what not. Quite miraculous, of course,
but the boredom factor has been held at bay by the fact my passion had to be
secret.
It caused much lewd debate at one party when we - a flushed young disco queen
and the teenage party host - arrived back in from an hour-long bout in the
garden. Their guesses were wrong, of course. Our shared passion, was not for
each other. It was for the garden. And what a garden that was. Night-scented
stock wafted out its sweet stench and white lilies gleamed in the soft glow
from the path lighting. There was an arch leading to a small secret garden at
the back with its own little arbour. No wonder we were dewy-eyed after all that.
We swore each other to secrecy. The agony in the garden would have been nothing
to our punishment at the hands of our cool friends. Fortunately, my sequinned
boob tube was disguise enough for both of us. No-one guessed that behind that
spangly exterior lurked desires only usually found among the green welly
brigade.
The condition has not improved with the years. In fact it's grown worse as my
secret has been forced under ground. There's no street cred in gardening but
the sad fact is I am a garden junky. It's a habit I have, I can't help it. I
try to stay away from them - I don't even have one of my own - but I can't.
I love them, big, small, wild or carefully planned. I consume them all. It's
shameless voyeurism but I can't help it. I stalk the streets of Edinburgh's New
Town peering through railings at the amazing creations some basement dwellers
have lovingly raised. Greenery, flowering shrubs, climbers - even some scents
force their way upwards - uniting in a gloriously subversive force against the
soulless symmetry of the unyielding stone.
I love all the little features people employ in their gardens. Babbling Gre
Foliage by the line obscured some of them during summer but during spring and
autumn there is a clear view. It's not so much that the gardens themselves are
spectacular - though there is one lightly terraced with never-ending flower and
vegetable beds, sun lounging area and an archway that stands out. It's more
that these people seem to do so much in them. Some are little more than drying
areas, others are strewn with toys and paddling pools in season. There are
barbecues, pot-filled patios, green houses, pigeon lofts - oh yes, and lots of
plants. All gardening life is there and all in such a short stretch. At times
I'm tempted to take a detour and drive by to see if their fronts match up.
Most of all, I admire those who garden in defiance of nature. I've seen brave
souls, notably in St Monans and Stenhousemuir, battle the elements and win with
their tropical shows of towering yukkas and palms. These seem to stand tall
right through the winter, laughing in the face of frost and snow.
I, too, laugh in the face of winter. It doesn't stop me in my tracks. It simply
strips away all that summer finery. But that allows a clear view of the real
structure and form of the garden. Nature in the raw, if you like. Then I can
look on and plan and savour what's to come in the spring. All this and I don't
even get my hands dirty.
Now that I've come clean it doesn't seem such a bad habit after all. Maybe
confession is good for the soil . . . and perhaps I'll never grow out of it.

GUILT-edged insecurity: such is the human condition conveyed in the work that
is the world of Tennessee Williams (1911-83).
Think of the tormented body of Laura in The Glass Menagerie (1944), the
tortured mind of Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire (1947), the
trials of Brick and Maggie in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955). Think of Tennessee
Williams and you think of psychic wounds inflicted on souls forever lost.
When Williams died, his brother Dakin described him as the greatest
poet-dramatist since Shakespeare. Dakin was too close to Tennessee to realise
how completely his talent had been confined by a father called Coffin -
Cornelius Coffin Williams - and few would agree with Dakin's family affair of
an assessment, given the competing gifts of such histrionic Americans as Arthur
Miller who praised the ``poetic lift The Glass Menagerie.
Lyle Leverich does not go all the way with Dakin, but goes along with Miller in
honouring Williams as an author who, with The Glass Menagerie, emerged as ``a
poet-playwright and a unique new force in theatre throughout the world''.
Williams was uniquely obsessed by himself.
Williams wrote about the autobiographical basis of his work in Memoirs (1975)
but Leverich, who got to know the dramatist when he staged a production of The
Glass Menagerie in 1976, told Williams he deserved a better book. Williams told
Leverich: ``Baby, you write it!'' And he did, in astonishing detail. This
volume takes the trauma of Williams's life up to the triumphant drama of The
Glass Menagerie. Another volume will follow. The length of Leverich's biography
establishes it as a labour of love: a tribute to a man the biographer regards
as a disturbing genius and a disturbed man dominated by his sexually frustrated
father and emotionally smothering mother and schizophrenic sister.
The theme of the biography is succinctly stated by Leverich: ``Throughout his
life, Tennessee Williams had two overriding devotions: his career as a writer
and his sister, Rose.'' His career as a writer was mainly influenced by his
addiction to the dark art of Hart Crane whose collected poems he carried with
him everywhere. He identified with Crane obsessively. Crane was raised by a
bullying father determined to drive the poetry out of him. So was Williams.
Crane was a self-destructive drinker and homosexual. So was Williams.
When Williams turned 21 in 1932, Crane took his own life by boarding the
steamer Orizaha and jumping into the water some 300 miles north of Havana. It
was Williams's wish that when he died his body be sewn up in a simple white
sack and borne out to sea to rest as close as possible to Crane's remains.
Instead, Williams's body was buried in St Louis - a city he detested since it
was from there that his father attempted to form his character. The decision to
bury Williams was taken by his brother Dakin and by the late Maria St Just, a
trustee of the Williams estate and, apparently, a woman who attempted to block
Leverich's biography.
Williams claimed his classmates at Iowa gave him the nickname of Tennessee. Not
so. He chose the name because he needed to renew himself for a play contest
created by the Group Theatre of New York. The age limit for entrants was 25
and, at the time, Tom was too old to enter so he assumed the name Tennessee -
after his father's Tennessean forebears - and pretended he was born in 1914
rather than 1911.
It was a fabrication he fretted over: ``Long after, Tennessee worried that,
having faked his birth date, his deception would be made public; he even
instructed his agent to warn reporters not to bring up his age at any interview
he might be willing to give.'' As a result, even the Library of Congress gave
his birth date as 1914 until the truth was told. Williams could live with his
lies for long enough to tell the truth in his plays. As Marlon Brando put it:
``He told the truth as best he perceived it.'' He played with perception.
As Leverich puts it: ``Tennessee was a fabricator - that was his profession -
and often, too, that was what he was personally.''
Leverich is clearly the ultimate authority on Williams. He intelligently
analyses his hero's motivation and the many men and women in his occasionally
heroic life. This book tells you everything you need to know about Tom aka
Tennessee until the next volume appears, and all the fans will look forward to
that.

WORLD No.6 Alan McManus completed a 5-3 victory over David Roe to reach the
semi-finals of the German Open in Frankfurt yesterday - the third Scottish
player to reach that stage.
McManus, who also made the last four of the Grand Prix in October, now tackles
fellow Scot John Higgins for the fourth time this season. ``I will have to play
a lot better than I did today if I am to have a chance of getting through,''
said McManus, who has already lost to Higgins three times this season.
``You are better off playing someone you know. I didn't know what to expect
against Paul Hunter in the UK championship, and it was a bad day for me,''
added McManus, beaten in the first round of that event.
``I do know John's game. He is a tough competitor, and I always enjoy playing
him. I didn't make a lot of mistakes, though Dave did, and got away with them.''
Roe, from Derby, said: ``I was careless and I don't think I got the run of the
balls.'' Then he joked: ``All these Scots in the semi-finals is doing my head
in. Can't we English play the game any more? I'll have to go and live in
Glasgow.''
McManus surged into a two-frame lead against Roe, helped by a break of 69 in
the first. But the Englishman, despite scoring only four points in the second
frame, hit back with a break of 51 to win the third, and another run of 55,
without McManus scoring a point, to level at 2-2.
The roles were reversed in the fifth frame, with the Scot hitting a break of 60
without Rose scoring. He took the next by 63-25, lost the seventh by 81-42, and
then closed out the match by taking the eighth frame 69-16.
World champion Stephen Hendry confirmed his place yesterday, making up the
three Tartan players. Until the Grand Prix in October, this had never happened
before, but now the Scots, for the second time launch a three pronged attack on
the two final places.
Ken Doherty concludes the semi-final line-up having beaten Mark Bennett 5.2.
The bad news for Doherty is that Hendry is next.
``After I had won the third frame Mark, who had played well up until then, got
a bit too tense,'' said Doherty. ``I was pleased with the way I played. My game
seems to be coming together again.''

n.WE should all take our hats off to Panama. Without it, we might not even be
here, according to a paleontologist who believes he can show that without the
little Central American connection, the ape-like ancestors of humans would
never have come down from the trees.
The Isthmus of Panama, the narrow strip between North and South America, was
formed three million years ago by a chance movement of the tectonic plates in
the earth's crust, forming a solid barrier between the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans.
The barrier changed ocean flow patterns, preventing warm water from reaching
the Arctic Ocean, which started a cascade of events that brought about the Ice
Age.
The chain of climatic and ecological changes ultimately resulted in the origin
of human beings thousands of miles away, in tropical Africa, according to
Steven Stanley, a professor of paleobiology in the Johns Hopkins Department of
Earth and Planetary Sciences. More arid and slightly cooler conditions caused a
dramatic shrinking of the rain forests.
Humankind's tree-dwelling ancestors, suddenly faced with a dwindling forest
habitat produced by climate change, were forced to begin living on the ground,
setting the stage for the evolution of larger-brained, upright-walking
descendants, Stanley said. His book outlining the theory, Children of the Ice
Age, will be published in April.
The Panama proposal is based on the motion of ocean currents which regulate the
earth's temperature. Previous theories have failed to explain why the Arctic
suddenly grew colder slightly more than three million years ago. Stanley argues
that the glaciers were the result of the Arctic freeze.
Before the Isthmus of Panama, warm water from the Atlantic Ocean mixed freely
with the Arctic Ocean. The barrier cut off that source of warm water and
touched off the Ice Age, sending frigid air and water southward, and bringing
about a dramatic change in global climate.
Scientists have also documented changes in deep sea flora and animal life in
the same time period near the mouth of the Labrador Sea, where fossil records
indicate that the Arctic Ocean grew much colder at that time.
``Previously, it was quite warm in the Arctic,'' Stanley says. Instead of
frozen tundra, the region was covered with something resembling evergreen
forests. ``We didn't have cold winters before the Ice Age. They were much
warmer before the Ice Age, and summers were not as warm as they are today.''
Sounds as if the pre-human days were very much like our Scottish climate.
n.THE deep mud around Rockall off our West Coast has been found to be as rich
in lifeform diversity as the equatorial rainforests. Most of the diversity,
however, is in species of nematode worms, and the Rockall Trough is one of the
deep oceanic trenches where they like to gather in greatest numbers.
n.SURGEONS may soon be using military style night sights in heart operations.
The thermal imaging technology has found yet another peacetime use after
surgeons discovered that blood flowing in arteries, veins and the heart has a
higher temperature than the surrounding tissue.
Now a nightsight camera has been developed specifically for cardiac surgery,
allowing doctors to see instantly if grafted tissue is working properly, or
whether there are any dangerous leaks. It also lets them see how well supplied
the heart muscle is.
n.SPIKING Mortality is a new disease which is wiping out millions of turkeys in
the USA. The disease was only discovered four years ago, but it has spread
across the continent. It kills very quickly, and could eventually affect turkey
supplies the world over. Once the disease strikes, a grower can lose 60 of his
flock in a couple of weeks. So far no-one knows the cause of the disease.

ANNABEL GOLDIE - Deputy chairman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist
Party talks to Ann Donald about her late night reading
n ONE of the most fascinating books I've been reading is by a historian of
great repute called Martin Gilbert about Winston Churchill called In Search of
Churchill. This is not so much a biography than an account of how Gilbert got
on to the track of information about Churchill detailing how he went from one
clue to another.
He constructs it much like a detective story and in so doing the book emerges
as a very honest account of a great man because rather than depend on the
subjectivity of people's opinions it's built on fact and circumstance. A most
illuminating depiction of Churchill.
I don't feel obliged to read all political biographies pertinent to my
position, I read them out of genuine interest. Alan Clarke's Diaries were
absolutely supreme. I'd love to meet him. In fact I don't think that there's a
woman in Christendom who wouldn't like to meet him. I found that I couldn't
take offence at him because there was a refreshing honesty and candour about
his own shortcomings. Contrary to what many people think, I think that takes
humility to admit. Undoubtedly the man has charisma and charm.
Another book that I dip into on a regular basis is Palgrave's Treasury. It's
really a compendium of our most noted poet's work from the Romantics onwards.
My particular favourite is Betjamin. In a funny way he's like a Burns for the
Home Counties because he has the couthy touch and engaging way of using simple
language in a crystal cut fashion that allows him to cut a scene and create a
picture. Like Burns he sees through the pomp and ceremony and manages to prick
the minds of the fashionable London Wimbledon set.

The Ghost Of Tom Joad, Bruce Springsteen (Columbia)
q A dirty-realist dispatch from the scabbier parts of blue-collar America's
underbelly. Ol' Bruce documents desperate lovers, accidental muggers, and
lust-driven thieves; fearful illegal immigrants, and cons who question the
worth of trying to go straight. It's a sombre, stripped-down album, reflecting
Brucie's unease at the many social malaises currently rife in the rootless
Yewess of Ay.
Of course, such problems have a history stretching back to the Depression, as
documented by John Steinbeck in The Grapes of Wrath. Indeed, the novel is
credited on the album sleeve as one of Bruce's inspirational sources - having
given the LP its title - along with a couple of newspaper articles on the
Mexican cross-border trade in human misery.
All this has led to a morally-complex, panoramic album which should see off
Bruce's more mindless Born In The USA-era following. Yet I'm not sure that even
the most dedicated Springsteenophile will be voluntarily immersing himself in
its bleakness too often. Ever considered penning film-scripts, though, Your
Bruceness? The Ghost of Tom Joad has got enough sparse, gripping storylines to
power several Hollywood films.
Anthology, the Beatles (Apple)
q Did you know that ``Anthology'' and ``the Beatles'' is almost an anagram of
``Sell tat-age booty, hen''? Oh, you did? No need for me to mention it then.
Out On The Floor, various (Goldmine)
q Waft me to northern soul heaven! Twenty-five total belters, kicking off with
Chuck Wood's steaming Seven Days Is Too Long. Believe me, seven minutes without
this album rattling your hi-fi will be too long, too. For there can surely be
no more corruscating song of contempt-fuelled revenge than I Dig Your Act by
the O'Jays. There is no finer place to be than Out On The Floor with Dobie
Gray; no more stratospheric a soarer than the Fascinations' Girls Are Out to
Get You. As the Four Larks say: groovin' at the go-go is the only way to be.
DAVID BELCHER
The Rose of the San Joaquin, Tom Russell (Round Tower)
q Too country for the folk market, too folky for the country market, it's been
a heck of a life being Tom Russell these past 20 years. But forget the pigeon
holes and listen to the voice.
Given a regular service to hell and back, this man would have a season ticket.
Not that Russell invites pity. Like their predecessors, this latest batch of
songs are essentially stories. They could happen to anyone. They rock, they
smoulder, they don't waste a word, and if there's any justice, they'll exocet
Russell's well-kept secret status.
ROB ADAMS
Classical Music: A New Way of Listening, by Alexander Waugh (De Agostini
Editions)
q THIS book claims to offer to the readers, especially those who ``want to get
more out of classical music'', an explanation of how to ``navigate your way
through absolutely any piece of music''. However, much of the book, despite its
title, describes an old, traditional way of listening to music - drawings and
definitions of instruments, their sounds (often a bit woolly, here), technical
elements of music (melody, harmony, counterpoint), historical periods, composer
profiles, technical glossary, etc.
Where it is on less sure ground is when it attempts to define and categorise
mood in music (which, of course, is the wrong way round - you cannot prescribe
the emotional reactions of any two different listeners, or their perceptions of
mood in music). The ``new'' element involves ``timelines'' - illustrations
described as a ``computerised image of the music, working on the same
principles as a cardiograph''.
It seems a bit naive to assume that what is essentially an oscillograph
representation of dynamic and textural highs and lows in a piece of music is
actually going to open a door for anybody who is trying to find a way into
classical music. Anyway, it's #14.99. Suck it and see. And let me know if it
works for you. Comes with CD.

SCOTTISH men's champions City of Glasgow Ragazzi showed how much they had
learned about European competition in their opening match in the European
Confederation Cup tournament at the Kelvin Hall last night.
Up against Balkancar Tran Sofia, who had four players in their ranks who had
helped Bulgaria finish fourth in the recent World League, the Scottish side
were expected to have little chance.
However, they kept the Bulgarians on court for more than an hour-and-a-half
before giving way - 15-9, 15-10, 13-15, 15-2 - after one of the most creditable
performances by a Scottish club side in Europe.
In the opening match of the tournament, Paris University Club defeated
Croatians Osijec, 15-11, 15-1, 15-7, with legendary setter Alain Fabiani in
exquisite form.
Sports awards
GAVIN Hastings is Glasgow City Council's sports personality of the year,
following Gary Jacobs, Stephen Hendry, Pat Clinton, and Liz McColgan.
But Hastings was unable to accept the annual award at a civic dinner last
night, and the trophy was accepted on his behalf by Scotland winger Kenny Logan.
Oarsman Peter Haining, the three-times world lightweight sculls champion,
received a special trophy. Other awards:
Service to Local Sport: Frank Hughes (football). Lord Provost's award: Fiona
McLean (netball). Team of the Year: Glasgow Western Klick Photopoint. Disabled
Sports award: Ross Low (athletics). Service to Sport: Thomas Dowens
(Volleyball).
Golf
AMERICAN Clay Devers fired his second consecutive bogey-free 66 to take a
three-stroke lead after the second round of the Vietnam Open yesterday.
The event, being played over the Golf Vietnam, Thu Duc layout, is the first pro
tournament the country has hosted.
Devers, whose 12-under-par total is the lowest halfway aggregate on the Omega
Tour this year, heads the leaderboard from Thailand's Boonchu Ruangkit, who
also posted a 66.
Hong Kong's Dominique Boulet followed his first-round 68 with an eagle, four
birdies, and three bogeys for a three-under 69.
He lies third at seven under, one shot ahead of overnight leader Jeff Senior,
of Australia, who carded an even-par 72. Leading scores:
132 - C Devers (USA) 66, 66. 135 - B Ruangkit (Thailand) 69, 66. 137 - D Boulet
(Hong Kong) 68, 69. 138 - J Senior (Australia) 66, 72.
Curling
Summit Centre: RCCC Henderson Bishop Trophy. Summit final - K Letton 10, A

Speedway
GLASGOW Tigers face one of their toughest races in years if they are to survive
in the Premier League next season.
On Monday, the British Speedway Promoters' Association will convene an
emergency meeting to determine the future of the team after the departure of
owner and promoter Douglas Hopes.
Hopes had his track licence withdrawn by the Control Board earlier this week
following alleged irregularities over payment to riders.
The Shawfield club and its riders may now be put on sale by the BSPA, and any
would-be successor is required to post a bond of #40,000 to take over the reins.
AMERICAN Jack Milne, the sport's second world champion, has died at his home in
California at the age of 88. Milne took the title at Wembley in 1937 and rode
regularly in Britain before the Second World War.
Athletics
RICHARD Singer, Mackie Academy's triple medal-winner in the national track and
field championships, is out of the Scottish team for the TSB Home Countries
Schools indoor multi events match at the Kelvin Hall today.
His absence decreases the Scots chances of deposing holders, England. However
Jackie Tindall, UK under-17 heptathlon champion, is favourite for the women's
under-18 crown.
Badminton
CRAIG Robertson (Fauldhouse) defeated English No.4 Tony Bush yesterdy in the
second round of the Irish Open in Belfast. Robertson lost the opening game
13-18 but took the remaining two 18-17, 15-6.
Gillian Martin (Renfrew) beat Yvonne Naef (Switzerland) 11-1, 11-0.
Squash
RODNEY Eyles, the top seed, reached the quarter-final stage of the Mahindra
Challenge in India after a 15-11, 15-12, 15-12 second-round victory over
Britain's Mark Chaloner. Eyles now meets another Briton, Mark Cairns, who
defeated Egypt's Amir Wagih 15-6, 15-9, 12-15, 9-15, 15-12.
Basketball
EDINBURGH Burger Kings will have a new coach for tonight's inter-city clash
with City of Aberdeen Leopards at Meadowbank. Former Scottish junior cap Paul
Dalrymple steps in for Australian Greg Gurr who has flown home to Perth for
Christmas. Dalrymple also will coach the capital side in the annual Boroughmuir
Tournament at Meadowbank on December 16 and 17.
Beefeater Kool Kats, who are lying second to Polonia Phoenix but have lost four
matches, go for a double over Edinburgh rivals Team Caledonia in the Scottish
Women's League match before the Kings' game tonight.
Meanwhile Edzell Enforcers and Paisley can use home court advantage to
strengthen their chances of a men's Top Five place at the expense of
Boroughmuir and Bruins respectively.
Boxing
GERMANY'S Axel Schulz goes into today's fight against Frans Botha in Stuttgart
quietly confident of clinching the vacant IBF world heavyweight title on a
points decision.
The South African, meanwhile, predicts an early knock-out will give him the
crown abdicated by George Foreman, who won the title in a controversial points
decision over Schulz in April and then retired rather than defend it.

n IF you're planning a fly/drive holiday in America, check the car insurance
policy before you leave. Most US rental companies provide only limited cover
and it is vital you read the whole insurance policy. One company worth using to
get over problems is Inter Assurance (01252 717766). They claim their new
top-up policy at #50 for eight days cover will take care of any situation you
are likely to encounter, while costing no more than the policies you are
generally offered by car rental companies which provide only a quarter of the
pay-outs.
n AVRO have flights to Alicante on December 23 for #174, Malaga on December 21
for #175 and Tenerife on December 19 for #254. Call 0141 303 0303.
n ACCORDING to the Central Statistical Office's latest Travel Trends, France
and Spain are still the top destinations for Brits, accounting for more than
40% of all holidays in 1994. More than eight million visits to Spain were made
last year, compared to only 700,000 visits made by Spanish nationals to the UK.
France accounted for nine million visits by Britons.
Turkey has risen most dramatically as a mainstream destination. 721,000
holidayed there in 1994, compared to 329,000 in 1992.
Tourists from the UK spend an average #363 abroad, #100 less than our inbound
tourists. The good news for our inbound tourism industry is that a record 21

n THOMSON Holidays and Airtours will both use Sandford Airport in Florida next
year for its packages to Orlando. No more will you fly to Orlando, and the
substitute airport is 40 minutes further away from the Mickey Mouse resort.
Operators say the extra driving time will be made up for by the faster
processing time it takes to get through Sandford Airport, which is,
coincidentally, a cheaper option for them to use.
n SCOTLAND'S newest ski area, Nevis Range, is expecting to attract an
additional 12,000 skiers this winter following installation of two new lifts

from Fort William, the area of Back Coire Dubh is now within the resort - good
news as it gets some of the first snowfalls of the season. Catering facilities
have also been expanded with the opening of the snack hut at the Rob Roy tow.
Nevis range will be the location of the British Schools Race on March 18 and
the Ski Centre Club Championship on March 31. On the other side of the country,
Aviemore expects to be given planning permission for its funicular any day now.
The lift will be operational by winter 96/97.

SCOTLAND has more than enough scenery, huffed and puffed a politician (Labour
it must be said) of my acquaintance in the early seventies. He was justifying
the quixotic determination of politicians and planners to bring heavy industry
to the Firth of Clyde at its prettiest reaches between the Hunterston peninsula
and Inverkip.
Till that time, the nuclear power plant of Hunterston A (opened in 1964) was
the only industrial blemish on a stretch of coastline of heart-melting beauty,
with the rolling Ayrshire hinterland and its little seaside communities to the
east and the island-dotted firth to the west, guarded by the miniature
Himalayas of Arran. And as for Hunterston A, weren't school children, after
all, encouraged to be proud of the pioneering nuclear establishment round which
cows grazed? At least it was compact and chimneyless and didn't disseminate
industrial dust and dirt - or so the argument went in those more innocent days.
Then came the proposal of the American oil company Chevron to build an oil
refinery at Portencross on the Hunterston peninsula to the south of the nuclear
station. After a public inquiry that absurd plan was quashed. However, the lure
of deep water facilities and the equally absurd idea of relocating the whole
Lanarkshire steel industry on a green, seaside site combined in an unstoppable
momentum. Fairlie, picturesque haven of yachts and the Arran ferry in bad
weather, was disfigured by the dust and visual aggression of a giant ore
terminal. Two direct iron reduction plants were plonked on adjacent reclaimed
ground at the beauty spot of Black Rock Beach.
The Scottish people - at least as represented by the media, politicians, trades
unionsand civil servants - seemed almost unanimous in their conviction this was
a splendid thing for jobs and the economy. It's not the first time Scots have
manifested a tendency for communal hysteria about something inherently daft.
Shades of the Darien Scheme.
In the event, the direct iron ore reduction plants never reduced a thing -
except the appeal of the landscape. The complex, with its dark towers and
sloping gantries, is grotesquely at odds with its setting overlooking the
Cumbrae islands. The only consolation for the residents of Fairlie and Largs is
that its pollution has remained merely aesthetic.
British Steel's official line is that the rise in fuel prices made the use of
the reduction plants uneconomic. And certainly by the time they were completed
the world steel market was contracting. But didn't this in itself show a lack
of foresight on the part of the planners of the then nationalised industry?
Some people still believed, too, that putting this kind of heavy industry so
close to nuclear facilities was, to say the least, injudicious. Whatever the
reasons, the waste of public money - and who will admit accountability at this
late date? - is staggering.
Today, of course, there is no Scottish steel industry for the mills or the
eyesore ore terminal to serve. The jetty with its massive cranes stretching out
into the channel to intimidate Millport is now owned by the privatised
Clydeport. Access is barred to the casually passing citizen. ``This is a hard
hat site,'' says a sign beside the manned security barrier. Perhaps this
justifies the exclusion of the public, except for organised groups, on safety
grounds - but it marks a diminishing of the freedom enjoyed by previous
generations to wander freely to the water's edge. It's fine to have an oyster
farm and bird reserve on the site, though oystercatchers, if not oysters,   may
have the whole firth for their playground.
What is being imported at the Hunterston terminal now is cheap foreign coal
from South America, Australia, Russia, and Poland. This to the county of
Ayrshire that traditionally was a coal exporter. The imported coal is not even
mainly for Scottish consumption but is merely being rerouted to Northern
Ireland's Kilroot power station. Hunterston's deep water facilities allow
``Cape-sized'' vessels of up to 150,000 tons to berth. Sometimes the coal is
transferred directly to smaller vessels. But much is temporarily dumped in the
enormous coalyard between the steel plants and the Clydeport jetty, there to be
screened, washed, and sized. In spite of automatic sprinkler systems and a
lorry washing plant, the coalyard is a visual scar.
Now irony rather than iron may be Scotland's new heavy industry. For
Hunterston's direct reduction plants are being dismantled - like the industrial
equivalents of London Bridge - to be resurrected transatlantically in Mobile,
Alabama. There they will finally spark into action to serve British Steel's
mill in Tuscaloosa and another joint venture in the southern state. The
preparatory work has been done; 7500 tons of machinery and 2500 tons of liner
for the furnaces will go west, the work probably being completed by next
autumn.
The fate of what remains of the complex is not clear. Will it be razed and the
ground landscaped or adapted for some other industrial purpose? British Steel
understand that Clydeport will take the land over. Clydeport merely say they
have ``an option on the land currently occupied by the BS plant, and if it
became available they would consider exercising that option, incorporating the
land as part of the terminal''.
So major question marks continue to hang over the Hunterston site and the lives
of the inhabitants of the adjacent coastal communities. Understandable unease
is in no way mollified by a consultants' report, dated December 1992, to the
Scottish Office and Scottish Enterprise. This looked at planning policy and
development on the Hunterston peninsula.
Behind the detailed examination of strategies (it being taken as axiomatic that
major industrial use remains a good thing) is an admission of economic
realities: ``The site will need to be marketed actively. Hunterston will not
naturally attract attention, being remote from large centres of demand, unable
to offer superior infrastructure currently and having a limited and narrow
competitive advantage.''
In spite of this (from the report's point of view) dispiriting situation, it
looks at all sorts of industrial possibilities and improbabilities from steel
(now a dead duck) and oil refining (``unlikely to be developed, given its
hazardous nature within the nuclear safety zone'') to aluminium manufacturing,
chemical industries, and waste incineration. Economic factors - or the nuclear
one - vitiate most prospects, except coal importing and trans-shipment. The
fact is that the world economy has moved on, particularly in Asia, and
green-field sites on the extremities of northern Europe are nobody's top
priority.
It's a sad state of affairs; a lovely area has been despoiled without even the
justification of economic necessity. To be fair, some people did foresee this
future, including those who organised the spirited local opposition to the
original developments.
Brenda Dick (now Brown) was a prominent protester. More than 20 years on, she
says she's had her fill of fighting big business and government, but takes a
rueful pleasure in seeing it proved that the ore terminal was not viable
(``Every expert confirmed the steel industry was in a downward trend'').
She also recalls how two decades ago a British  steel boss took her aside
during a sightseeing tour of the  #160 million terminal and told her, ``If I
had lived in a place like this I would have done the same as you.''
She realises in retrospect that ``politicking'' and ``this wonderful promise of
jobs'' had proved too strong to counter. ``It was as though they had looked at
the most beautiful spot on the Clyde and said `How can we despoil it?'.'' Mrs
Brown also claims that the legal requirement for a five-mile unbuilt area round
the nuclear power station had been abandoned; also that a promise had been made
that should developments fail, the ore terminal site would be reinstated. Now,
of course, different people and different organisations are on the scene. The
action group's protests did achieve some results - for example the screening of
the steel works and terminal from the A78 coastal road at a cost of #4!fm. An
effigy of  the then Tory Secretary of State for Scotland, Gordon Campbell, was
burned in symbolic protest, proving that political responsibility was perceived
to span both major parties.
As for the present, Mrs Brown (``I can still get worked up after 20 years'')
fulminates against the unused rail link with its ``ghastly'' storehouse above
the main road and its searchlights, which she considers a hazard to motorists.
Clydeport confirm that the rail link is intact and could be used again if there
were sufficient customer demand.
Hunterston's nuclear facility meanwhile runs rings round its neighbours in
public relations. Visitors are welcomed to Hunterston B (the decommissioning of
the original Hunterston A was completed last year ahead of schedule). There are
guided tours and even tourist paraphernalia, from sweatshirts to sports bags,
to be had.
Eleven few miles north at Inverkip, the 800ft tower of the oil station rears
above the massive generating halls, an example of nineteenth-century technology
erected out of its time. Its basic principle - that if you pour noxious sulphur
gases high enough into the atmosphere they will go and pollute someone else's
backyard - is much less acceptable in these globally sensitive times. Besides
the power station is oil fired - planned that way to offer an alternative to
the then stranglehold of coal.
The Inverkip power station, commissioned in 1976, was never used to any extent,
except during the miners' strike of 1984-1985. It has not generated any
electricity at all since 1987. Contrary to some local rumours, however, its
machinery has not been removed. The plant has simply been mothballed and is
looked after by a handful of maintenance workers. In theory it could be called
into service again, but this is an unlikely option in an industry with
over-capacity (almost half of Scotland's needs are produced by the two nuclear
plants, Hunterston B and Torness).
So the great concrete phallus of Inverkip, erect but impotent, continues to
brutalise the views of the upper firth, diminishing everything in its
proximity. The fact that Scottish Power rents out its deep-water facilities to
passing ships from time to time is hardly justification for its existence. ``I
don't understand why they're keeping it,'' says Christine Gallon, who chairs
Inverkip Community Council.
She recalls that a year-and-a-half ago there was a proposal to bring an Italian
oil rig there for finishing work. More than 200 local people signed a petition
claiming the platform would be visually obtrusive and adversely affect
recreation and tourism. But Inverkip District Council gave the go-ahead on the
basis that jobs outweighed other considerations.
On that front, Mrs Gallon points out that the contract work on the rig would
not necessarily have gone to locals; also that if the rig had not found a buyer
it could have remained at Inverkip indefinitely. She didn't want to see a
Cromarty Firth situation created on the Clyde.
Scottish Power has, of course, merely inherited a problem which an earlier
generation of short-sighted planners didn't address. A spokesman said there
were no plans to get rid of Inverkip but that the future was constantly under
review and obviously there were questions about how long the plant was going to
sit there not doing anything.
But where would the funds come from to dismantle the Inverkip monster? Perhaps
the limitless maw of the EU is the answer.
Meanwhile one may wallow in the wisdom of hindsight. The great mistake of the
1970s, it could be argued, was not just a slavish preoccupation with jobs at
all costs but the lack of a comprehensive fuel and industrial policy for
Scotland, either independently or within the wider UK context. Five-year plans
and national strategies, of course, smack of totalitarian ways and even worse
things might have been perpetrated under them. But the messing of the
Hunterston pensinsula and Inverkip were the results of piecemeal decisions
without consideration of their overall impact on this once idyllic piece of
coastline. The position was exacerbated by the fact that public inquiries of
the time had such narrow remits.
Would things be done differently now when there's a greater appreciation of the
environment and when tourism is one of Scotland's few predictable growth
industries? It would be good to think so. Perhaps, however, those twin
shibboleths of jobs and deep-water facilities would still rule the day.

JULIA   LANGDON
n Stranger Than Fiction, Michael Crick (Hamish Hamilton, #17.50)
Enigma, Robert Harris (Hutchinson, #15.99)
Hidden Lives, Margaret Forster's (Viking, #16)
THE art of biography is not easy to define, but a book which informs and amuses
while also being revealing and interesting about the subject has to be judged a
success. Michael Crick's biography of Jeffrey Archer, Stranger Than Fiction,
was a triumph. It is full of fascinating information and is as thrilling, in
its way, as a detective story.
Robert Harris has thoroughly researched his second novel Enigma, set among the
codebreakers of Bletchley Park during the Second World War. It is a thriller, a
love story and a thumping great read. It really is one of those books that you
decide to miss most of the night's sleep in order to finish.
And there is a detective element, too, to Margaret Forster's Hidden Lives, a
compelling and beautifully written memoir of three generations of her family. I
loved it.
CARL MACDOUGALL
n Ladder of Years, Anne Tyler (Chatto &amp; Windus, #14.99)
Follow Your Heart, Susan Tamaro (Secker &amp; Warburg, #10)
Meshugah, Isaac Bashevis Singer (Hamish Hamilton, #15.99)
WHEN Delia wanders off, her absence is unnoticed for four hours. Neither her
husband nor their three adult children know the colour of her eyes, nor can
they agree on what she is wearing. Ladder of Years by Anne Tyler, forces us to
acknowledge the place of women society takes for granted; in so doing, it makes
shelves of political tracts and argument redundant.
Susanna Tamaro talks of women's lives like dead fireworks, brought to earth by
family and society instead of scoring to the sky. Follow Your Heart, is an
older generation's plea for understanding which is also at the heart of
Meshugah by Isaac Bashevis Singer. He explores a panoply of Holocaust survivors
whose plight is as stark and hoplessly moving as the piles of spectacles, shoes
and human hair that is Auschwitz's most elonquent testimony.
STEPHEN McGINTY
n The Troubles, Tim Pat Coogan (Hutchison, #20)
Rebel Hearts: Journeys Within the IRA's Soul, Kevin Toolis (Pan, #15.99)
The Missing, Andrew O'Hagan (Picador, #14.99)
IT took 23 years to understand the full horror of Bloody Sunday, the day I was
born. Tim Pat Coogan's section on the events of January 30, 1972, when British
Paratroopers shot and killed 14 unarmed people, in The Troubles is clear and
concise. Facts impact like plastic bullets. It is ironic that despite a strong
Irish heritage I should choose the first year of the ceasefire to dig the
emerald isle's blood-sodden turf.
Coogan's book is brilliant, a disturbing portrait of the how, why and where of
bitter men and Britain's fatal arrogance. For illumination behind the black
balaclavas Rebel Hearts: Journeys Within the IRA's Soul by Kevin Toolis is
first class. By journey's end he wears his republican colours with, at times,
shame for the sins of others. And, of course, Andrew O'Hagan's The Missing was
unmissable.
LORN MACINTYRE
n Paula, Isabel Allende (HarperCollins, #14.99)
THERE are those who dismiss magic realism fiction, with its dependence on the
survival after death of the human personality, as an evasion of reality. But
when the 28-year-old daughter of the Chilean writer Isabel Allende sank into a
coma in 1991, the author of The House of the Spirits used her fertile
imagination as a way of communicating with her daughter in the long, silent
vigil by the bedside.
Paula begins: ``Listen Paula, I am going to tell you a story, so that when you
wake up, you will not feel lost.'' In making meaning of Paula's life, Allende
evaluates her own life in this magnificent book which is both biography (the
daughter's) and autobiography (the mother's). Allende recalls her own story and
that of Chile's - and the fact that Paula dies gives this testament an added
poignancy and honesty.
robert mclauGhlan
n The Path to Power, Margaret Thatcher (HarperCollins, #25)
Gladstone, Roy Jenkins (Macmillan, #20)
Gladstone 1875-98, Colin Matthews (Oxford, #25)
MARGARET THATCHER'S The Path to Power, is her first volume of autobiography,
published after the second! It is the better read with less self-justification
and more personal revelation, particularly concerning her most tender years and
her mother's role in them. It is also good on Denis Thatcher who was so
essential to her success.
Mrs Thatcher was either loved or hated. Gladstone had the same experience: his
first biographer said he found half the doors of London closed firmly against
him. Lord Jenkins, his latest biographer in Gladstone, can be recommended with
enthusiasm. His own political experience informs the book at every turn. He is
not uncritical but sustains the high opinion Gladstone has eventually come to
enjoy in a book whose fluent qualities make for easy reading.
Jenkins's book must not be allowed to squeeze out Colin Matthews's Gladstone
1875-98. It is very good and rightly emphasises Gladstone's vital religious
dimension even more than Jenkins.
JACK McLEAN
n Dirt and Deity, Ian McIntyre (HarperCollins, #20)
The Ultimate Giles, Peter Tory (Headline Books, #25)
Jane At War (Pedigree, #14.95)
IAN MCINTYRE'S Rabbie Burns book Dirt and Deity because it gets you arguing,
and that's what these supine Burns Club always want to slide out of. Read it,
yes read it - and bloody well weep for Scotland.
You must get The Ultimate Giles by Peter Tory, if only for the 300 lavishly
reproduced cartoons. The text is a little reverential; bugger the text, look at
the artistry of this draughtsman who invented and interpreted in turns the
Britain in which I grew up, and generations before me too.
Also, a cartoon book: Jane At War. Wartime and the delectable blonde of the
dissolving dress, detaching bra, and gravity-prone panties. Nae wonder we won
the war. The Jerries had a chap with a silly moustache. We had Jane.
FRANK McLYNN
n Palimpsest, Gore Vidal (Deutsch, #17.99)
Millennium, Felipe Fernandez-Armesto (Bantam, #25)
The Oxford Companion To Philosophy, edited by Ted Honderich (OUP, #25)
MY three nominations share a common characteristic: all are wildly uneven but
never less than engrossing and, at their best, are quite brilliant.
Accordingly: Palimpsest by Gore Vidal, a candid autobiography disfigured only
by the rutting episodes; Millennium by Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, a universal
history, great on China, Latin culture and frontiers, but almost throwing the
baby out with the bathwater when it comes to Europe; and The Oxford Companion
To Philosophy, edited by Ted Honderich, which manages the astonishing feat of
running the gamut from outstanding entries to banal, jejune or incompetent ones.
n The Herald books of the year selection continues in next week's Weekend Extra.

CIVIL engineering and flood control are not skills you would normally associate
with medieval warfare but in 1335 a squad of English military engineers could
scarcely contain their delight when they came up with a plan for the Drowning
of Lochleven Castle.
Occasionally, in trawling the backwaters of Scottish history I've come across
brief references to the Middle Ages equivalent of the regiment of engineers.
A few years ago we looked at the spectacular arrivial in Stirling of a
procession of exotically named siege engines, including War-Wolf and All the
World, the former a great towering brute of timber construction which was
reckoned to be the most sophisticated piece of military hardware in Europe in
its day. The engineers were out in force for that siege.
But back to the shores of Loch Leven. Having dealt in successive years with the
exploits of Bonnie Prince Charlie, Rob Roy and William Wallace, the movie
industry might consider turning its attention to this romantic affair in Fife.
Our principal characters would be the hero, Alan de Vipont (cheers!) and the
villain, John de Strivelin (jeers!). Yes, you're right - both were from Norman
stock but that didn't prevent either Bruce or Wallace hitting the big time.
This de Vipont held the castle in the loch (most famously the prison of Mary
Queen of Scots) for David II. With the English invaders traipsing around the
central lowlands, the island fortress was, according to one historian, a
``tempting mark for knightly enterprise and ambition''. You know what those
chivalrous chaps were like. The motto engraved on their hearts was something to
the effect ``Once a King always a King but once a Knight is never enough''.
A blockade was established, de Strivelin building a fortalice in the churchyard
of Kinross on a neck of land looking out across the waters to the castle.
Fleets of boats set out to assault the stronghold but were driven back by the
well-prepared garrison. Then, at a point where the river by the same name
leaves Loch Leven, a strong and high bulwark of stones and turf was
constructed, designed to raise the level of the loch and flood out the
defenders.
As the waters began to rise, de Strivelin was so confident in his masterstroke
he took most of his force off to a party at Dunfermline to celebrate the
anniversary of the canonisation of Queen Margaret of Scotland.
Meanwhile, back at the ranch, four soldiers from the island armed with picks
and crowbars rowed ashore and stealthily approached the dam, reassured that
they had gone undiscovered by the snoring of the nightwatch. Soon they had
undermined the dam and water began pouring through finally bursting on the
sleeping English camp and drowning men as they slept.
Despite de Strivelin swearing terrible vengeance he was eventually forced to
raise the siege and the general opinion of fourteenth-century historians,
notably Fordoun and Wynton, was that the invader got what he deserved, having
sacrilegiously built his temporary fort on the consecrated ground of Kinross
kirkyard.

Loud and
dirty
guests
n MIDWINTER on the Ythan, and a shocking pink dawn over the black dunes. Ice
floes hush against the banks, borne inland on a rising tide. Long-tailed ducks
flight in from their roosts offshore, laying the arctic sky onto the river
where they settle. They make vees on the moving water, then dive, then flight
again, calling out the winter's necessities in a romantic yodel: ``Coal and
Candlelight''. Of all the transliterations of their call, this old name evokes
most strongly the frosty northern coasts where they winter.
It is only since the 1970s that we have found out how many ``Caloos'', as they
are known in the northern isles, winter with us. A great roost was found off
Burghead, ten or 15 thousand strong, too far out to be seen from land. In Scapa
Flow they roost likewise in the centre, where the German sailors must have
heard them in winter of 1919. By day they scatter in little parties off the
coast, diving for molluscs longer and deeper than any other duck: a minute at a
time and well over a hundred feet down.
Off any sandy shore from Barra round to Bellhaven you could pick out twos and
fours through binoculars. They look white against a blue sea, but closer you
see a patchwork pattern of browns and blacks. In flight the long, pointed
tailfeathers show which give them the fowler's name ``sea-pheasant''. By April
you will see bigger parties on the lochs and bays of Orkney, now moulted to a
darker brown with white cheeks. By the Churchill Barriers they perform a rich
repertoire of bowing, stretching, twisting, splashing displays, pairing for the
long flight to the arctic. They look like a different species then, until you
hear that unforgettable, musical cry.
As a child, on first looking into the Observer's Book of Birds, the prints of
the long-tailed ducks, with a wild northern shore behind, held me spellbound.
Every time I see them again, or hear their ``Coal and Candlelight'', the spell
is woven anew.

SCOTLAND toasted success in the men's and women's singles at the Irish Open in
Belfast yesterday.
In the men's section, West Lothian's Craig Robertson moved into the last 16
with two fine wins, while Gillian Martin progressed into the last eight in the
women's competition.
First victim for Robertson was Dane Kim Nielsen, dispatched in three sets,
before the Fauldhouse man notched up a notable, hard-fought 13-18, 18-17, 15-6
success against highly-rated Englishman Anthony Bush.
After having received a bye in the first round, Martin progressed almost as
easily through her second-round clash with Switzerland's Yvonne Naef, the Scot
winning 11-0, 11-1. Results:
Men. First round - C Robertson beat K Nielsen (Denmark) 12-15, 15-3, 15-9.
Second round - Robertson beat A Bush (England) 13-18, 18-17, 15-6.
Women. Second round - G Martin beat Y Naef (Switzerland) 11-0, 11-1.
q THE Scottish squash championships, starting at Heriot Watt University in
Edinburgh next Friday, suffered another blow yesterday with the withdrawal
through illness of No.2 seed Alasdair Taylor.
With Peter Nicol and Stuart Cowie already having informed the organisers that
then will not make the event, Newland's Barry Sutherland has now been elevated
to second favourite behind world No. 30 Martin Heath.

IT is a case of ladies first for Scotland this weekend when the European
championships start in Grindelwald, Switzerland.
Kirsty Hay's team of her sister Karen, and Katie and Edith Loudon start their
round-robin campaign this afternoon against France, and, with tricky games
against Germany and Norway to come, a win today would be a good insurance
policy for the Scottish women as they attempt to qualify for the quarter-final
stages.
With Karen - based in France but who returns to Scotland regularly - in the
team this season in place of Jo Pegg, Hay's quartet is an experienced line-up
and should do better than the sixth place they managed at this event last year.
The Scottish men, Hammy McMillan, Norman Brown, Mike Hay, and Roger McIntyre
won this title in Sweden last year, have set themselves the target of retaining
their crown, a feat never before achieved by any Scottish team.
They open their campaign tomorrow with two games that look relatively straight
forward on paper, against Austria and Hollnd, but following stuttering
performances in their last two domestic tournaments, the Stranraer team
withdrew from last weekend's Edinburgh international to concentrate on
preparing for these championships.
Two victories over this weekend would do their confidence and chances of
retaining the title a power of good.

EUROPEAN DRAWS
NOTTINGHAM Forest yesterday found a Jurgen Klinsmann-inspired Bayern Munich
blocking their path to UEFA Cup glory.
Frank Clark's side, the only British team left in European competition, were
drawn to face the Germans in the quarter-finals when the draw was made in
Switzerland.
The first leg will be in Munich on March 5, with the return at the City Ground
two weeks later.
Klinsmann, who returned to Germany in the summer after his season with
Tottenham, has been in stunning form in the competition, scoring six of his
side's goals in their two-leg destruction of Benfica in the last round.
He also helped knock out Raith Rovers in the previous round.
It will be Klinsmann's first return to England since he quit White Hart Lane
and he is sure to provide the sternest test of Forest's defensive resolve,
which has been the key behind their progress.
``I'm delighted to head over to England again,'' said Klinsmann. ``But Forest
will be a very hard nut to crack. I've a lot of respect for them.
``They play the old British style and put you under pressure with high, long
crosses. Our chances are 50-50.''
Forest have not conceded a goal since losing the first leg of their first round
match 2-1 to Malmo.
In the Cup-winners' Cup, Paris St Germain, who put Celtic out in the second
round, have been drawn against Parma, with the first leg in Italy. Full draws:
UEFA CUP
Barcelona v PSV Eindhoven, Bayern Munich v Nottingham Forest, Slavia Prague v
Roma, AC Milan v Bordeaux. (Matches to be played on March 5 and 19).
CUP-WINNERS' CUP
Dynamo Moscow v Rapid Vienna, Parma v Paris St Germain, Deportivo La Coruna v
Real Zaragoza, Borussia Moenchengladbach v Feyenoord. (Matches to be played
March 7 and 21).

ASK any football gaffer, and he will admit to a gaffe. Everton's Joe Royle did
it in regal fashion yesterday considering that his #4.3m striker, Duncan
Ferguson, had recently spent some time under the guidance of Her Majesty's
officials.
``His problems have not been on the field, and sometimes I wish he was more
aggressive on the field,'' said Mr Royle, obviously forgetting the incident
which led to Ferguson's enforced absence.
``He's had two sendings off down here - one for heavy breathing at Arsenal, and
one for a misunderstanding at Leicester.''
To be fair, Royle was enthusing about the Scottish internationalist being
``bursting to play'' in Everton's live TV game against West Ham on Monday night
after a highly successful comeback.
Ferguson scored two goals and lasted the full 90 minutes of Everton Reserves'
5-0 victory over Newcastle on Thursday night in his first competitive game of
football since August, and his name has been added to Royle's squad for Monday.
The manager added: ``He will feature at some stage. I think it's unlikely that
he'll start, but he'll certainly be in the squad, and we now have the knowledge
that if an emergency arose, Duncan would be ready.
``He did very well for the reserves, and looked sharp. It was a gentle
reintroduction, but he scored two goals and overall I was very impressed.
``He was blowing a bit towards the end, as you would expect, but I was
pleasantly surprised at his fitness level considering the time that he's been
away.''
Royle has no qualms about throwing Ferguson back into the pressure pot after
his spell in prison, but Ferguson may have to cope with West Ham's aggressive
full back Julian Dicks in a game which is being broadcast to the nation.

PHILIP is two months off five and I am older than I should be. It isn't much of
a hill, Beinn Lighe, just a seventh wave on the rolling swell of grassy moor
that runs along the Ross of Mull. We have no hillwalking gear, just lace-up
boots and jackets with a pocketful of sweets. And we didn't leave the house
till after four. But it is just us and we have set off to climb.
As we walk along the road the sheep scurry before us, scrambling over muddy
gaps into the bogs where the irises are unsheathing their green swords. Deep in
the scrub the first willow warbler sings his cadence, overlaying the trickle of
water from a pipe into the roadside ditch. We cross the Iona road and climb up
the side of a taught wire fence. We don't hurry. We do look back. There's no
point in climbing any other way.
The slope of the hill is dry and heathery, with little bosses and promontories
of close cropped grass. We follow a sheep track at a place that suits us both.
A hundred feet or so up, we sit to look north across Loch Scridain and the
ocean beyond.
Staffa sits like a little black box on the silent water, its volcanic angles
echoed by the Treshnish Islands and by the tors of the nearer headlands. Behind
them all, Coll smudges the horizon. There is only the lightest wind. Opposite
us the great cliffs of the wilderness of Ardmeanach rise, scree and step,
fronting the mountains of Mull. Our little hill opens up a grand landscape.
When I talk about volcanoes, I can't tell whether Philip accepts the idea so
readily because everything in the world is possible, or because everything in
the world is incomprehensible. Come to think of it, I don't know which is true
myself. I am learning what any parent could tell me: that talking to your
children is a way of learning about yourself. And more: a way of learning again
how to learn. Metacognition. We'll have some chocolate when we reach that
little cliff on the horizon.
In the dry, grey spring wind birds of prey fly round the hillside. Two
buzzards, then a third, circle with their wings held forward in a shallow vee.
How difficult to mistake them for eagles, with their huge flat wings, that we
had seen the day before cruising the ridges of Glen More - but how often have I
made that mistake.
A pair of kestrels were hunting the field edges on the west slope of the hill,
their wings quivering as they worked the wind to steady their hunting eyes. We
looked over the rough ground to guess what they were hunting. Then we began to
notice the vole holes. At the edge of patches of grass among the heather were
little excavations, burrows an inch wide and a fan of fine soil in front of
them. This was more interesting than geology. Woodmice, aka long-tailed
fieldmice, were suckling the first of their four annual litters in the nest
chambers below our feet. Piles of droppings caused us raucous amusement as we
ferreted among the grass.
We saw where tiny seedlings were taking advantage of the handful of bare earth
to push up. I suggested - very speculatively - that they might be seeds which
the mice had eaten and excreted.
Nor were we far from geology still, for the richness of the rock, and of the
soil it breaks down to, determine the abundance of grass and thence of mice -
and thence, of course, of kestrels and buzzards. Field mice are sedentary - as
well as short-sighted - but field voles are our own lemmings, with population
peaks and crashes, and short-eared owls in particular, as specialist predators,
breed synchronously with these rhythms.
As food chains don't appear in the 5-14 curriculum till Primary 7, I avoided
burdening Philip with this knowledge. The fact that the hawks were hunting the
voles was enough, but being together on the hill was the best of all. It must
be recorded that Philip got more out of the droppings than the birds.
THREE hundred and fifty feet above the sea, we sat on a lichened outcrop and
munched chocolate bars. A few yards off, a ewe started bleating at us, standing
her ground with the sealoch behind her. At her feet a white, red-flecked bundle
lay on the green grass. I walked across and she moved off a pace or two, but
the lamb had been born and died only minutes before. Here was a subject for
Philip's questions. ``What?'' was difficult enough. ``How?'' was just about
possible. But ``Why?'' was beyond my powers. Maybe the best answers were there
before him and needed no words: the ewe's aimless little runs and cries at
nothing, the indifferent grass and the hoodies sliding past. One day, I'll tell
him Hugh Macdiarmid's poem:
I met ayont the cairnie a lass wi' golden hair
Cryin till a bairnie that wis nae langer there.
Winds wi warlds tae swing dinna sing sae sweet
The lecht that bends ower a'thing is less ta'en up wi'it.
It's not a matter of anthropomorphism; the lass and the ewe were crying over
the same thing.
We didn't climb much higher. When we passed our chocolate rock on the way down,
the ewe was already a little further off and the hoodies a little nearer.
Slipping through a patch of deep heather I asked if Philip wanted a roll. He
looked back, hungry, then laughed when he realised his mistake.
We tumbled and rolled sideways down the slope, ran a little and did it again.
Then we lay in the heather for a few minutes, panting and giggling, looking up
at the grey sky - until the crows slid past above us, too. I did say that they
would raise their chicks from the hill's carrion. It even sounded positive. I
would have liked to agree with John Muir: ``But let Children walk with Nature,
let them see the beautiful blendings and communions of death and life, their
joyous inseparable unity.''
But sometimes it's too close to home and then it's hard, impossibly hard.

n.BY pinpointing individual suns in the glare of the most tightly packed
cluster of stars in our galaxy, the Hubble Space Telescope has unveiled the
possibility of either a massive black hole or another remarkable phenomenon: a
``core collapse'' driven by the intense gravitational pull of so many stars in
such a small volume of space.
Astronomers at Santa Cruz have tallied an extraordinary number of stars in the
ancient globular cluster M15, about 37,000 light years away and part of our own
Milky Way family of stars.
While it is local, just a neighbourly group by astronomical calculation, it is
pretty mind-bogglingly distant. Those light years translate into a distance of
approximately 200 million billion miles, give or take a league or two.
Careful analysis of the distribution of the stars suggest that at some point in
the distant past, they converged on M15's core, like bees swarming to their
hive. This runaway collapse, long theorised by researchers but never seen in
such detail, may have lasted a few million years - a mere moment in the
12-billion-year life of the cluster.
The core probably stopped collapsing before many of the stars collided. Rather,
stars near the centre would have settled into an uneasy cosmic waltz, both
attracted to each other by gravity and repelled by close encounters that
slingshot them through space. An alternate scenario could explain the stellar
pile-up: a black hole that formed early in the cluster's history. If it exists,
the black hole would be several thousand times more massive than our sun, and
swallowing up everything within its event horizon, the gravitational pulling
distance.
Fortunately for us all, the solar system is well out of its fatal attraction.

THERE are some jazz pairings which are made in heaven: Lester Young and Billie
Holiday, Roy Eldridge and Coleman Hawkins, Zoot Sims and Al Cohn, Bob Wilber
and Kenny Davern, Howard Alden and George Van Eps, and Ruby Braff and Ellis
Larkins.
The last two have combined only occasionally over the past 40 years but each
time they have gone into the recording studios the results have been sublime.
There was that memorable meeting back in l955 when record producer John Hammond
turned them loose on a selection of Rodgers and Hart gems. Seventeen years
later Hank O'Neal at Chiaroscuro records enlisted Hammond's aid to bring them
together again.
Eighteen months ago it happened again and the initial results have just
appeared on a CD on the Arbors label. Here is Braff, the mellow toned
cornettist saluting that giant of American song, Irving Berlin, with Larkins,
the pianist who remains one of the most in-demand accompanists around New York.
While Braff has always been recognised as a major figure on the mainstream
scene, a cornet player who eschewed bop in favour of the older forms, Larkins's
jazz presence has always been less publicised.
The man from Baltimore was classically trained but his career in jazz began at
Cafe Society in the forties. He played for Mildred Bailey following that and
became her favourite backing pianist.
So accomplished did he become in supporting some of the finest vocalists
around, this became his major role and jazz playing was left to occasional
record dates scattered across the last four decades.
Larkins has long been a mysterious figure in the jazz world and even a lengthy
recording project financed by the late Ernie Anderson, who spent his working
life as PR man for John Huston and then Charles Bronson, and his jazz life
organising such extravaganzas as the entire series of Eddie Condon Town Hall
Concerts and the legendary date at the same venue for Louis Armstrong, seems to
have vanished without trace.
Enough material for seven CDs was recorded but nothing has yet been released .
. . The Berlin tribute, though, is at hand and more is to follow and we can all
be happy with that prospect.
Their obvious mutual admiration shines through on every track with Braff
revealing in the sleeve note how he came to admire Larkins's playing. He first
heard him on an Ella Fitzgerald album which saluted the music of George
Gershwin.
Even now, the songs recorded then had such an impact on the cornet player that
he has dedicated his current CD to Ella.
So now, 40 years on, these two giants meet again combining to add further
lustre to such Berlin songs as Blue Skies, Easter Parade, This Year's Kisses
and How Deep Is The Ocean, among others.
There is also a haunting five- minute reading of Russian Lullaby which is
startlingly appropriate because it was that song which rocketed Braff to jazz
stardom when he recorded it as a member of the Vic Dickenson Septet.
This is melodic jazz at its very finest and Mat Domber deserves praise for
bringing Braff and Larkins back to the studios to make such wonderful music
together. I can scarcely wait for the second volume . . .

EDNA WHYTE's studio on the Isle of Luing is truely magical. Her window, which
slides back so you can hear the seagulls, smell the sea - you can see Scarba,
Mull, Lunga, the Black Isle, even the Garvellachs and Belnahua on a clear day.
``It knocks me over; it's mindblowing!''
How on earth does one paint when the distractions of ever changing moods of
ocean currents, tides, cloud formations and fabulous, breathtaking sunsets hang
on your every glance? These spellbinding scenes from dawn to dusk, in winter
and summer, sun or rain, are grist to her mill: inspiration for her impressive
graphite drawings and oil paintings currently on show at the Lillie Gallery,
Milngavie, later to be seen at Ayr's Maclaurin Gallery.
Whyte is a woman of many talents: artist, designer, illustrator, teacher,
business woman, restaurateur, raconteur. Till 1990 her career spread in many
directions, her Buttery and Gallery winning awards for food, design products,
and prints produced by her Old Rectory Design firm.
But with the backing of business partner, Audrey Stone (who was the chef behind
the Buttery and co-director at their Residential School at Achnamara), in 1990
they chucked in the business to allow Whyte, then sixty, to focus on her
painting. It's been worth it, for her work has proceeded by leaps and bounds.
To understand her new work, I went to visit Luing, near Oban, an island a mere
six miles long and two across. To get there you cross the Atlantic Bridge at
Clachan Seil and follow the road to Cuan Ferry.
Luing is unique, and different to other Hebridean inshore islands. There are no
gold sands. It's a slate island with dramatic black beaches, low white
cottages, and wonderful seafood! Its roof slates, mined till the mid 1960s, can
be found on Iona Cathedral. Whyte first came to Luing at 14. Her uncle had a
house there, which now belongs to her cousin. Family holidays from London to
Aberdeenshire relatives established her love of Scotland - and a sense of
journeying, of motion. ``Those journeys had a big influence on me,'' she says.
Since 1967, her studio has overlooked the Luing lagoon where seals and otters,
mackerel, wild salmon, lobsters, scallops, saithe and lythe joust the waves
under turbulent skies. It's a lonely, isolated place for a gregarious soul like
Whyte, but many friends from around the world frequently come to stay.
``This place matters to me,'' she says. ``I love the starkness of the
landscape, the stubborn rocks, the dramatic bowels of the deserted quarries.
Year round I experience the impact of sea, sky, cloud, vapours, horizon: the
mercurial, rumbustious, evershifting elements of water, air and light. These
elemental forces display their dramatic existence across vast perspectives.
``This perpetual activity sets the problem: how to convey in drawings the
nature of this chaotic, everchanging expression of natual forces?'' Whyte
demonstrates that you don't need colour, only a pencil to recreate Luing's
elemental flux of wind and weather. Her linear concentrations evoke rhythm and
movement. Sometimes her visionary drawings give one the impression of being on
a speedboat roaring at the island through spray and swell towards a blinding
sun. There's an almost scientific, meterological feel to several images.
Sometimes she uses line in an abstract way to express the very fracture of the
elements; energy dissolving in sunlight, raindrops sparkling, rainbows
scintillating - evoking the whole panorama of Argyll's miraculous theatre of
the elements.
Her studio at the top of the house is designed by architect David Meek, of
Oban. It's full of easels, rows, piles and boxes of paints and pencils;
hundreds of brushes.
``You can't pop out to the corner shop here and buy art materials. I use acres
of pencils and wear out a lot of brushes! So I keep a stock in!''
Whyte paints on wood, (``I've been selecting the knots!'') or on gesso where
she can incise turbulent linear activity in monochrome using pencil, paint,
rags and rubbers. ``I've never fancied canvas. The intensity of gesso white is
wonderful and Pelican grey putty rubbers are the best for taking out highlights
from impacted graphite. I use sandpaper and old biros for markmaking too!''
She can only work standing up at the easel and likes to be able to step back
from her work so her studio has ``long runs''. Nowadays, she doesn't sketch at
the sea edge.
``I have it all in my head. I've spent a large proportion of my life looking,''
she explains: ``I work by obliteration. I draw; then scrub out and go on to the
next phase. An image needs energy in it. I use putty rubbers to create
highlights. Surface is very important to me. I don't mind bashing it; pounding
it! I'm quite gestural. I want a drawing to have erosion. As the wind changes
or the water ripples, I destroy and go with the orchestration of what happens
next. Perspectives of space don't satisfy me. I want to achieve tonality by an
intensity of light.''
Whyte went to Kingston Art School at 14. (``As a child I knew I always wanted
to go there''), then to London's Royal College at 19 where she was taught by
Carel Weight, Edward Bawden, Nash and Moynihan.
``I've been exceptionally privileged and have never had to submit to the
tyranny of a restricted life. And the island people also taught me how to see.
They are such sharp observers. It's all to do with song, music and dance. Art
is all music, isn't it?''
As I leave, Whyte confides: ``Both Audrey and I are very keen on surprise. And
remember I'm not the only artist here. Audrey makes designs like Kandinsky from
beautifully selected food, salads and such like, in wonderful colours. Meals
which look good are a colossal pleasure. There's not enough design around these
days.''

n Fruits of the earth: such a variety of delights from the garden could soon be
a thing of the past. It's estimated we have lost around 2000 varieties of
vegetable since the 1970s. Now new laws from Brussels could see an even sharper
decline in the abundance of lesser-known but much loved names.
DO you ever think that vegetables tasted better when you were young? It is not
necessarily pure nostalgia. The vegetables we eat today are dominated by the
requirements of supermarkets and so many of the fondly remembered varieties of
the past have simply disappeared.
``We have lost 2000 vegetable varieties since the 1970s,'' says Jackie Gear,
executive director at The Henry Doubled Research Association's Ryton Organic
Gardens near Coventry.
``It is terrible to see some of our most beloved vegetables disappearing.
Varieties our grandfathers and great-grandfathers would have grown, right back
to the 1700s' need to be protected. They survived in the past because people
used to save the seeds and replant them. People adopt chimps and dolphins, so I
thought why not adopt-a-vegetable.''
At Ryton, #12.59 a year ensures your vegetable's protection by guaranteeing its
inclusion in Ryton's Heritage Library. This contains 700 vegetables in the form
of seeds which are available to Ryton's 3000 members.
The reason so many of our beloved, traditional vegetables have become a
threatened species is because supermarkets want different characteristics from
amateur gardeners.
``Supermarkets want varieties that they can harvest all at once, so their big
machines can harvest all the peas in one day,'' says Gear. ``Amateurs want
varieties that won't crop all at the same time, vegetables that will keep on
coming so they can pick a little every day.
``Supermarkets want things to sit neatly on shelves. They want tomatoes with a
thick skin so they won't get damaged on the shelves. But who wants to eat a
tomato with a thick skin? You want a tomato that tastes good, the thinner the
skin the better. Amateur gardeners couldn't care less about the shape, they
don't want to put them in packets.''
The other reason the beloved British vegetable is under threat is due to Euro
regulations. The Brussels bureaucrats have decreed all varieties must be
registered before they can be sold. Incredibly, it costs around #800 a year to
maintain a vegetable on this list, so all but the best selling varieties of
vegetables have been dropped. And family seed firms whose business was selling
a multitude of varieties have now discovered they can't afford to offer the
same range.
Rooting for Scotland in the gardens at Ryton, I saw a flourishing Laird's
Victory Turnip. The survival of this turnip is something of an adventure story.
``It arrived at Ryton as two flowering turnips in a padded envelope.'' says
Gear.
``The donor, from Dundee, said they had belonged to his neighbour. When he
died, aged 90, his family threw away his collection of seeds. But they left
Laird's Victory in the garden and our donor had rescued two plants. The Laird
in question was not a Scottish ruler but Laird and Sinclair, the old Dundee
seed merchant. It is doing well; safe, we hope, forever.''
There are more than 700 varieties which still need adopting. Who could not help
but want to protect the Lazy Housewife Climbing French Bean: a runner bean with
the intriguing name of Mortgage Lifter; Ragged Jack Kale; Uncle Bert's Purple
Kale; the Lancashire Lad onion; Rat's Tail radish; Lady Godiva Squash or a
Boothby Blond cucumber?
When you adopt at Ryton you get a signed certificate of ownership and your name
is put in a commemorative book. You can also go on to obtain the seed of your
threatened favourite so that you can grow it in your own back garden. But will
the general public empathise with a threatened Silsden Bomb cabbage as easily
as a delightful dolphin?
Sophie Grigson, cookery writer and broadcaster, has adopted the Fablonelystnyj
tomato. ``It has a wonderful hint of Russia and is absolutely delicious with
that marvellous intense tomato taste, a lovely balance of sweetness and acidity
with a delightful fragrance,'' she says.
She couldn't resist the charms of oca either. ``I came across oca in South
America, in Ecuador, it's like a cross between a cooking apple and a potato,''
she says. ``It has the starchiness of a potato and the fruitiness of a cooking
apple with a hint of chestnut. It is related to the nasturtium and is a type of
oxalis like sorrel. I'm growing a small crop in my garden and it's delicious
boiled with butter.''
Less exotic, but just as commendable, are the choices of Dr Ian Allison of
Penicuik, Midlothian, - a Laxton's Exquisite Pea and a Bronze Arrow lettuce.
``I'm trying to grow organic vegetables in my garden here because I don't want
to use pesticides,'' he says. ``Have you ever seen a slug on a supermarket
lettuce? I refuse to use slug pellets, but, of course, a lot of my veg gets
eaten. However, I firmly believe that the old varieties of vegetables, grown
naturally, do taste better.''
Diana Milne of Dalkeith, Midlothian, says: ``I adopted an Oak Leaf lettuce
which is similar to the Salad Bowl lettuce, widely grown by organic gardeners,
and the superb Early White broccoli. I wanted to support Ryton and I am looking
forward to growing them from seed. We have a third of an acre on the River Esk
and try to live off our garden produce. Winter Greens are so vital for good
health and we love to eat vegetables which look and taste that little bit
different.''
However, it is too late for some, like Carter's Sunrise tomato; the winner of
the only First Class Certificate from the Royal Horticultural Society in a
trial at Wisley.
``Although we have unearthed some Carter's Sunrise seed, it has all proved too
old to germinate,'' says Gear. ``And there is no sign of Carter's Fruit which,
according to an old description, `Peels like a peach and can be eaten raw like
an apple at any time of the day'. Where is the luscious sounding tomato now?''
Perhaps, like so many of life's great mysteries. we shall never know.

THE things men do for women. Once there was a Moorish king of the Algarve who
deeply loved his Scandinavian wife. But the bride from the north pined for her
own country and homesickness threatened her life. The king was desperate to
save her. He imported thousands of almond trees from his own North African
homeland and planted them round his castle, between the barrier hills of his
kingdom and the great ocean. When the trees came into blossom the landscape
turned wintry with snowflake flowers, and the queen recovered.
I've promised myself something: my next visit to the Algarve will be in
February, when the almond trees flower. Their history may be folklore, although
it's true they were introduced to southern Iberia by the Moors, but their
reputation is fact. In January, the first buds open and by February blizzards
of blossom cover the hills around Silves and Sao Bras de Alportel, the
butterflies return and the Algarvian spring is under way. From then on it's
wall-to-wall mimosa, cistus, lavender, iris, wild tulips and jacaranda until
the oleander and bougainvillea take over for summer.
I've never seen the Algarve short of flowers, wild or cultivated. When I was
there last, in late August, I expected to see some signs of heat exhaustion but
the gardens were gung-ho and the hills verdant and the grass (more truthfully,
the well-watered lawns and golf courses) was achingly green. Who'd have thought
you'd have to go to southern Portugal last summer to find a patch of green
grass?
Six years ago I'd never seen the Algarve at all. Six years ago I was a
blinkered bigot. Mention the Algarve and it brought out the Jean Brodie in me.
All very well for those who like that sort of thing if that's the sort of thing
they like: golf-courses and time-share complexes, high-density beaches,
concrete coast, sardines with everything, suburban colonies of ex-pats.
And then, at the invitation of an editor who suggested I investigate ``the
alternative Algarve'', I spent a week in a villa near Sao Bras de Alportel and
found the Algarvian alternative was only 20 minutes inland from Faro airport;
while half an hour to the east - in the opposite direction from the
tourist-intensive hubs of Quarteira, Vilamoura, Albufeira and their satellites
- were beaches as long and empty as the strands of Harris, pounded by warmer
waters of the same ocean.
I fell out of the airport's sub-Beaubourg arrivals hall and into a shock of
delight. Within minutes the car left the grisly jostling on the coastal highway
(now supplanted by a sleek new motorway between the Spanish border at Vila Real
and Albufeira) and burrowed into green hills flecked with white houses.
The country roads were pitted with potholes and mysteriously empty. We passed
three cars and a mule and cart. We passed the outskirts of Santa Barbara de
Nexe, which has a parish church celebrated for its Manueline workmanship and
the sardonic soubriquet of ``the Hampstead of the Algarve''. We saw a sign to
Loule, the largest inland town, centre of artisans since the thirteenth century
when the Moors were expelled from its castle and replaced by brass and copper
craftsmen.
We went onwards and upwards, noting the cluster of rented cars in the wayside
forecourt of Maria's Supermercado. Capitalising on fluent English learned in
New York, Maria is the fairy godmother of self-caterers, even if she does hike
the prices of her deli produce. Finally, we reached a fold in the hills, rocked
up a track between olive groves and arrived at Casa da Cruz Alta.
For all the rackety practices of a few low-cost developments - remember those
horror stories about carbon monoxide poisoning in the eighties? - the quality
of self-catering property in the Algarve is high. You can live like rock stars
in the sumptuous villas of upmarket resorts like Quinta do Lago and Vale do
Lobo (Michael Jackson and Madonna have villas among the umbrella pines of
Quinta do Lago - more residential investment than holiday home) but beyond
their cordons sanitaires you can find charm, comfort, seclusion and your own
swimming pool for half the rent you pay for similar billets in France or Italy.
There was nothing flashy about Casa da Cruz Alta, but this converted farmhouse
tucked into a shelf of uneventful countryside 10 miles from the sea became
quite dear to me. From the top of the hill we could see the coast, with some
dreaming towers shining in the sun; distance lent enchantment to the high rises
of Quarteira. The shepherd drove his flock past our door and our next-door
neighbours, a Portuguese family who spent hours in their vegetable garden,
offered lemons and potatoes.
In our own garden were three carob trees, four olives, two kumquats, an almond
and a fig tree, with a prickly pear at the back door and flowers everywhere.
The swimming pool overhung a valley of orchards and terraces and at dusk we
could see the lights of Sao Bras, and hear its dogs bark between cuckoo calls.
When we drove into the little town to shop we passed a derelict canning factory
(tuna fishing was once a cornerstone of the Algarve economy, but in the 1970s
the great shoals of tuna suddenly changed their migratory path and body-swerved
the region) and on its chimney stack was a nesting stork. A stork! I had only
ever seen storks in the illustrated Grimms, or on birth greetings cards.
Casa da Cruz Alta had martins nesting between its cane ceilings and its Santa
Caterina tiles, baked at a plant in the eponymous village on the Tavira road,
and two tall chimneys pierced in the Moorish style. The Moors arrived in the
eighth century, stayed for 500 years, and when they were evicted from their
last Algarvian stronghold in 1253 by Afonso III, king of the youthful nation of
Portugal, the monarch was proclaimed ``King of Portugal and the Algarve''. This
south-west corner of Iberia with its equable climate and marketable 3000 hours
of sunshine a year has since preserved an identity quite distinct from its
mother country. I find the Algarvians a little like sunburnt Scots: reflective,
undemonstrative, a bit dour, perhaps, but with slow-burning kindliness in their
faces. They have the build of peasants and traces of the Moorish gene in their
swarthiness.
The devastating Portuguese earthquake of 1755 (the worst in Europe, flattening
Lisbon and killing 60,000 people) wiped out most of the original architecture
of the Moors. The mightiest of their surviving fortresses is the red sandstone
castle at Silves, built on a site used by the Romans. Today, bee-eaters hoover
the spaces between its courtyard jacaranda trees.
The ghostly influence of the Moors persists, however, in old and new domestic
architecture, in the pierced chimneys of farmhouses and villas and the openwork
balconies of apartment blocks, and in a love of ornamental tiles. Portuguese
azu lejos, painted glazed and assembled into decorative panels, are found all
over the country and have been used since the sixteenth century, but the
Algarvians have a passion for them. They deploy the square clay tiles on all
sorts of building, inside and out.
Churches traditionally use blue and white tiles for their panels of Biblical
scenes but azu lejos come in all colours, and often ornament the entire faades
of buildings. I can think of several humble cottages in Sao Bras with azule jos
faades, and a handsome, three-storey town house in Lagos which is tiled in
glazed leaf green from roof to doorstep.
Lagos, which gave its name to the Portuguese trading post which became the
capital of Nigeria, and which launched the sixteenth century caravelles on
their long voyages to chart the sea routes to India, is the place to be if
you're a student of maritime history. This attractive town and one-time naval
dockyard of Henry the Navigator marks the western boundary of my experience of
the Algarve.
This is a little shaming, because although I've sailed round Cape St Vincent on
a cruise ship I've never explored the wilder extremities of the Algarvian
seaboard, yet I love lonely seascapes. The coast west of Sagres, I'm told, has
been spared the commercial indiscretions which disfigure some of the golden
cliffs and sea-sculpted grottoes between Albufeira and Portimao, and to the
north of Cape St Vincent the exposed Atlantic beaches and 200ft cliffs are now
protected from development.
Portugal has slapped environmental protection legislation on this sparsely
populated region.
Rumour has it that the far west secretes the Algarve's only empty beaches and
unspoiled coastal communities. False rumour. I have found my lonely seascapes
within 20 minutes of Faro (whose peaceful old city, Renaissance cathedral,
Baroque church of Sao Francisco and other quiet satisfactions are usually
ignored by the masses belting through the airport) among the dunes and lagoons
and sandspits of the Ria Formosa Nature Reserve.
The coast around Faro, and between the Algarvian capital and the Spanish
border, is atmospheric rather than spectacular: flat but complex, with long
fingers of sand heaped into peninsular dunes and barrier islands. Sixty
kilometres of coastal wetland are managed by the authorities of the Ria Formosa
Natural Park, who describe their fief as a habitat of world importance for
aquatic birds and other wildlife; and here, from a very luxurious hide in the
Quinto do Lago Hotel (the balcony of my bedroom), I learned the Algarve is
heaven for twitchers.
Twenty per cent of the reserve falls into the Quinta do Lago estate and its
only hotel, a five-star Orient-Express enterprise, has quietly begun playing
the environmental card. Bird-watching may never replace golf as its number one
activity, but the staff have noticed an increase in the number of guests who
borrow binoculars, or bring their own. There's a resident colony of flamingos
on the estuary, and the estate's new nature trail invites sightings of royal
terns, eagles, and every variety of duck and wader. In the last two years the
spoonbill, once a visitor, has started to nest and the migrants include
hoopoes, bee-eaters, azure-winged magpies, golden orioles and Alpine swifts.
Seasonally, African butterflies drop in.
I have a soft spot for Quinto do Lago, which other, ruder and more superior
travel writers call Surrey-by-the-Sea. I took a morning ride through its
pinewoods when I was last there, and the early golfers on the forest fairways
were unfussed, and the Home Counties householders and proprietors sitting on
their blameless lawns by their immaculate villas were harmlessly idle.
Later, I walked across water on a long, rickety wooden bridge to a favourite
(if expensive) beach restaurant, Gigi's, which serves fresh fish and seafood to
die for. But I took my chances and worked off lunch in the breakers of a
boisterous sea: our own Atlantic, which makes the dear, dreamy Mediterranean
seem a little stale. When push comes to shove, however, I know my place: the
humbler end of the eastern seaboard, the etiolated Ilha de Tavira with its
limitless beach, its widely dispersed population of wind surfers and its
strategically placed chip-and-chicken bars. They serve fish and seafood, too,
when the market is kind; and you do yourself a kindness if, en route, you visit
the fish market at Olhao, a port which has lost some of its Cubist charm to the
moribund factories of the canning industry, but where the harbour and its
vessels - everything from deep sea trawlers to bright little inshore craft with
protective eyes painted on their bows - are worth seeing.
On Saturdays, gipsies in their painted carts gather at the market while the
fruits of the sea provide the cabaret. The catch is so fresh that inspecting it
is hazardous: clams spit at you, crabs nip, eels wriggle, monkfish bare their
teeth. You half-expect the swordfish to strike poses and shout ``En garde!''
You can reach Ilha de Tavira by miniature railway from the west side of Santa
Luzia, or by five-minute ferry from the edge of the salt pans at my
best-beloved Algarvian town, Tavira, once its largest town one of the oldest.
Loule is homely, Olhao is functional, Lagos has style, but Tavira has natural
charm. Its centrepiece is the seven-arch Roman bridge over the River Gilhao
(Tavira was once a busy estuary port, but its harbour is now silted up) and on
the riverside promenades you can walk beneath noble date palms and the faades
of Renaissance buildings.
Despite a substantial Roman presence in the Algarve the legions didn't leave
many traces of their passing. There are remnants of the ancient city of Milreu
at Estoi, six miles inland from Faro (in a region not heavily endowed with
official ``sightseeing opportunities'' you can bag two at Estoi, where the
formal gardens of an eighteenth century country mansion are open to the public)
but Tavira's bridge is a handsome memento; and the rest of the town is
delightful.
The castle has a terraced garden and the churches are splendid, rich with
porcelain-blue tiles, while Tavira's jumble of red-roofed houses have made few
rash moves to accommodate tourism. Despite its reputation - the town is
well-known as one of the Algarve's most relaxed and appealing - it remains
largely untainted by development. But I did get one surprise when I was there
in August, my first visit for two years. The Roman bridge now has a rival: the
monster span of the new motorway which leaps across the Gilhao. It looks like
the bridge to Skye.
There is more to explore: the western coast, of course, and the deeper
interior. Everyone goes up to the Serra de Monchique for its chestnut woods and
views and a chicken piri-piri lunch at the roadside restaurants between the
pretty town of Monchique and the peak of Foia, the Algarve's highest. But there
are far lonelier serras and much emptier landscapes between the two arteries of
the Lisbon motorway and the River Guadiana, the Spanish frontier.
For explorers, however, there is this problem with the Algarve: it can't be
rushed. It cultivates lotus-eaters. For my part, once installed in my little
rented farmhouse in the olive-green hills, once submerged in geraniums and
marguerites and the sweet-smelling heat of summer, I find it hard to move;
which is why, some day, I must go back in brisk February for the almond blossom.
n BETWEEN May and October, Faro international airport is served by weekly
charter flights from Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh, with charters from
Glasgow also available from November to April.
Otherwise, TAP Air Portugal - in conjunction with British Midland - offers good

IF there is a team in the basement which Stranraer would have wanted to avoid
in today's first round of the Tennents Scottish Cup it is leaders Livingston.
Jim Leishman's team have collected a number of scalps this season in other cup
competitions, and another run in the major knock-out event could be the tonic
for a team who have yet to win at their new stadium in Livingston.
Stranraer manager Alex McAnespie has watched Livingston and knows that his team
will have to keep an eye on striker Jason Young, whose 12 goals so far this
season is twice as many as anyone their Division 2 opponents can boast.
As at Stranraer a senior club is bound to fall by the wayside after the
encounter between Stenhousemuir and Arbroath. John Brogan, now in charge of the
latter, returns to Ochilview, a ground he knows from his days in charge of
Stirling Albion, who had to play there for a season. Stenhousemuir have found
their scoring touch and should be too strong.
One non-league team is sure to progress as Edinburgh's Spartans visit Glasgow
University at Westerlands. Living up to their name, the existence of a Spartan
can be tough, as their manager, Sam Lynch, explains that the players even pay a
standing order to a bank to help keep the club in funds. The pay-to-play team
from the capital, or the students, will meet East Fife in the second round.
Spartans should be favourites as their ranks include striker Paul McGovern, who
has played for Hibs and Partick Thistle, and central defender Mark Thomson, who
played in the cup last term for Meadowbank before moving across Edinburgh to
rejoin Spartans.

NEW boys dominated the Friday chat yesterday as Celtic paraded their latest
signing, #500,000 Morten Wieghorst from Dundee, and Rangers decided it was time
to give #350,000 midfield man Derek McInnes, formerly of Morton, his chance in
the first team against Partick Thistle.
However, Wieghorst may have to settle for a place on the bench at best against
Hibs after the hectic two days he has had since he first heard that Celtic were
interested.
The Danish internationalist, who has been the subject of a lot of interest from
various clubs, had been hoping for a move this season as he signed
month-to-month contracts at Dens Park but the Parkhead move came as a complete
surprise. It might also have been a little bit unexpected for him to be told he
was wanted as a central defender.
Wieghorst is seen in that role by manager Tommy Burns, who at one time had
tried to sign a similar continental style player in Gordan Petric to Parkhead.
Petric went to Rangers, who were one of the clubs speculated as keen on
Wieghorst. As the Dane joins Celtic, Parkhead defender Barry Smith, who has
been there four-and-a-half years, goes to Dens Park, making the total deal
worth around #600,000 to Dundee.
``I am just delighted to be going to a big club like Celtic,'' said Wieghorst
in impeccable English. ``It is a great opportunity for me, although I know I
first have to secure a place in the team and then build from there.
``In Denmark, I knew all about Celtic as a great club, especially the kind of
football they played in the sixties and seventies, and people realise they are
trying to build a team that will play attack-minded football in that style
again. They are one of the clubs known on the Continent for their tradition.
Anyway, now I am a Celtic fan.''
The tall internationalist, who has had five caps for Denmark, insisted that he
would play anywhere in a Celtic team and added: ``I did play in central defence
for Lyngby.''
He likes Scotland, enjoyed his three years at Dens Park, and hopes he can
increase his chances of more international recognition by establishing himself
with Celtic. ``He will be involved in the squad tomorrow,'' said Burns, ``but
he has not had much sleep during the past couple of days and maybe he needs
time to settle in.
``We see him as a central defender but he can step into midfield if required.
The way the team has been playing it has to be a hell of a good player who gets
into the side and Morten has real quality. He is a very good passer of the
ball, keeps good possession, and is tactically aware, like most continentals.''
The manager said that he had been kept informed of the position regarding
Wieghorst and, recently, Dundee manager Jim Duffy let him know that other clubs
had made their interest known. He decided to make his move then.
Duffy said: ``Morten had made it clear he wanted to keep his options open on
the possibility of a move to a greater stage by signing monthly contracts since
the start of the season. He could have simply signed for another club under
freedom of contract and we would have been left to take the chance on the fee
being settled by tribunal.
``In fact, we consider we have been stung on the last two occasions we were
subject to a fee being settled in that way - when Steve Pittman joined Partick
Thistle and John McQuillan went to Perth.
``There were three firm offers for Morten this week and, in these
circumstances, we felt we had to negotiate the best deal we could.''
Celtic will have fit-again Phil O'Donnell in contention for a place against
Hibs, but Brian McLaughlin is also a challenger for the place in the team
vacated by suspended Peter Grant. The other empty peg, left by another
suspended man, John Hughes, will go to Malcolm Mackay.
Hibs will be without their suspended midfielder Michael O'Neill, but Mickey
Weir is fit again. Striker Keith Wright is confident that his team can end an
11-game run against Celtic without a win, although many of them were drawn.
``One thing is certain, neither team will be looking for a draw this time,'' he
said, ``because we can't let Celtic get further ahead of us and they won't want
Rangers to go further in front of them.''
Rangers first have to beat Partick Thistle and that is always a dangerous
presumption, even if the Ibrox side have a superb record in the league this
season. They will be without suspended Paul Gascoigne, which may make life a
little more difficult for the headline writers, but into his place comes a
player of much promise in McInnes.
The 24-year-old might well have made his first appearance in the top side
against Hibs but had to serve a suspension. He has impressed manager Walter
Smith in two reserve matches and is keen to stake his claim for a regular role.
Alex Cleland is almost certainly out because of a slight hamstring injury.
``Over the seasons, Thistle have had to learn to start fighting against
relegation from the start of the season,'' said Smith, ``and it is to their
credit that they have stayed in it for the last couple of seasons.
``Their result against Aberdeen shows what they are capable of against the top
teams in the league, but, now that we are clear of European commitments, we
would like to keep up our good league form and then take advantage of the
10-day break to work on the fitness of players who have been out with injury
this season.''
Thistle are without suspended pair Cammy Milne and Steve Pittman, but flu
sufferers Gregg Watson and Ian Cameron are fit to return. Goalkeeper Mark
Cairns, who did so well in his first top-team game against Aberdeen last week,
will have his initial taste of the Ibrox atmosphere.

SHE is remembered as the designer of the lobster dress and the hat like a shoe,
and as the creator of shocking pink. But as with the Surrealism which inspired
her style there was more to Schiaparelli than met the eye. If the garments were
dreamlike, so too, was her life.
Elsa Schiaparelli was born in 1890 in the Renaissance pallazo Corsini, near St
Peter's in Rome. Her father was in charge of the magnificent library in the
pallazo so the family lived in an apartment there. Behind the facade of the
building lay a garden and as a child Elsa was surrounded by rich colour,
frescos, illustrated manuscripts, gilded interiors and Roman antiquity.
After a conventional upbringing and with no suitable husband on the scene, the
plain, unhappy Elsa was a worry to her parents. In 1913, at the age of 22, she
visited Paris which she instantly loved. She then went to London where she met
her husband, Comte William de Wendt de Kerlor.
The year 1915 found the young couple living in Nice but here the trail runs
cold. There followed three-and-a-half years of Schiaparelli's life of which
nothing is known. In 1919 the count and countess were living in New York. After
the birth of her only child, Elsa was deserted by her husband.
After a period of hopelessness, beset by poverty and by the illness of her
daughter, Gogo, Elsa returned to Paris. The city was seething with artistic
ferment. Inspired and encouraged by Paul Poiret, Schiaparelli designed
innovative clothes. Her trompe l'oeil sweaters were an instant success. Before
long the smart set was clamouring for her striking sportswear and modern
jewellery. By 1928 her Display No 1 and Display No 2 collections had been
chronicled in Vogue and drew comment from the New Yorker. Elsa Schiaparelli had
arrived.
International high society shopped at her salon in the Place Vendome, or at her
boutique, Schiap (pronounced Scap). She applied witty embroidery, mirrors, and
toy-like buttons to her dresses and jackets. She brought out a circus
collection, a musical note look, and she introduced big shoulders.
Greta Garbo followed her dictate. Film costume departments put Hollywood's
designing females, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis and Rosalind Russell into outfits
inspired by Madame Schiaparelli. The confident jacket and pert, perched hat
were as much part of the 1930s actress's armoury as was brittle repartee.
When in 1936 Schiaparelli showed shocking pink, the colour which was to become
her signature, Salvador Dali used it for his divan in the shape of Mae West's
lips. The Shocking perfume bottle was shaped like Mae West's torso.
Schiaparelli worked with Cocteau who drew profiles to be embroidered on to
dresses and jackets. In 1938 Dali's ``tear'' dress and the torn headscarf were
forerunners of punk design.
There are other surprises in this strikingly illustrated book, Elsa
Schiaparelli by Palmer White (Aurum Press, #19.95), ``She haunted Linton (sic)
in the Borders of Scotland and ranged as far North-west as the isles of Lewis
and Harris.''
After dining with the MacLeod of MacLeod on Skye she incorporated tartan and
tweed into her collection. At the entrance to her 18-room house at 22 Rue de
Berri, Paris, stood two life-sized Venetian figures, M and Madame Satan which
Schiaparelli had bought in an Edinburgh secondhand shop.
Elsa Schiaparelli died in 1973. She was survived by Gogo and by two
grand-daughters, Berry Berenson who married the film actor Anthony Perkins and
Marisa Berenson, jet-setter and actress of Cabaret and Barry Lyndon fame.
Schiaparelli left a legacy of bold and startling garments in wardrobes and
museums across the fashionable world. Yves Saint Laurent and Karl Lagerfeld
among others have acknowledged the debt they owe to Schiaparelli. Both have
paid tribute to her in designs inspired by her brilliant, idiosyncratic work.

AS we sow, reap, and grunt over spades, marvelling at nature's bounty, how many
allotment holders are aware, I wonder, of the controversies that have raged
around our innocent pursuits? It was when I began to dig (naturally) into the
matter that I realised how much our apparently private plot-worlds have been
the subject of public concern.
As well as Acts of Parliament, there has been a Government Enquiry (which led
to the Thorpe Report, 1969), not to mention attempted ``Bills to amend the law
in relation to allotment gardens and to confirm that allotment gardening has
the status of a recreation''. However, the Enquiry made little impact and no
progress, and the attempt by Lord Wallace to pilot a Recreational Bill through
Parliament in 1984/85 was judged by a fellow Lord as ``not apprppriate for
modern times . . . recreational gardening is a matter for education and not for
legislation''. Our bonfires continued unquenched.
Our activities have also brought forth numerous publications on the subject,
the most thumbed of which in my collection is The Allotment: its landscape and
culture by David Crouch and Colin Ward. Published by Faber in 1988, this
enchanting book explores the culture of the allotment and the part it has
played in Britain's life and landscape for 150 years.
After re-reading the first chapter, I emerged damp-eyed and determined to
defend allotments, ``the last bastions of individualism'', against the
``professional designer, municipal tidiness and imposed order'' and from the
zeal of ``reformers'' and others who, like the late Professor Thorpe, viewed
allotments as ``neglected eyesores''. To Thorpe, they carried the ``stigma of
charity'' rather than self-help. He felt they should be replaced by the
``leisure garden'', with sites improved and upgraded as recreation facilities
for all the family (oh please, no paradise patios!).
Amongst other aims, some very sensible such as tidying up the impenetrable
legislation, the Thorpe Report proposed a completely new image for allotments.
It was highly critical of the allotment movement, finding few ``public spirited
allotment holders'', and many ``individualists who consider their allotment to
be as private as their home gardens, who are seldom interested in anything
beyond its boundaries, and who are blind to their further responsibilities''.
Here lies the paradox: many plot-holders (I would guess the majority) resemble
Thorpe's individualists; those like myself for whom the plot is a blessed
relief and means of escape from the daily round so often dominated by ``further
responsibilities''. Yet we know that, threatened with unacceptable regulations
or extinction, we would all rise up, armed with implements and indignation, to
defend our rights and bludgeon our associations into vigorous lobbying activity.
The activities of my own Allotment Association, let alone the local council are
remarkably unobtrusive. They surface only periodically with requests for rent
or notices of forthcoming produce shows. Despite their rules and missives of
let, and strange appeals such as one I received recently ``to desist from the
use of carpets on plots'', the council eye that turns to the wonderfully varied
and makeshift landscape of my own allotment site seems blessedly blind.
For example, to the best of my knowledge, no one has yet been forced to
demolish a hut which did not conform to the specified standards (apart from one
monster sky-scraper around which brassicas drooped in perpetual twilight). And,
I might add, it was mostly off-the-peg huts that sailed skywards from their
moorings in the recent gales - not the ingeniously cobbled together variety,
dismissed as eye-sores by Thorpe and his ilk.
All right, so some allotments have suffered the indignities of regulation huts
and tarmacked paths, and others have been scrapped altogether in favour of more
profitable housing schemes, but on the whole, the prevailing policy seems to be
one of dig and let dig. Some councils, conscious of the increasing size of
waiting lists for plots and of the cost of preparing new sites, are now
encouraging people to take on half-plots as they recognise the growing demand
for would-be plotters to carve out their own patch of rural sanity in the
stressful fast-lane urban world of the 1990s. This is enlightened policy.
But what of local government reorganisation? Are we under threat as the
inadequately funded new councils look for savings? Will this be the moment for
reports to be dusted off and Acts re-written? This we can't yet know, though I
was assured by the allotment officers in both Glasgow and Edinburgh their jobs
would remain in place. However apolitical we wish to be in our apparently
private gardening worlds, we need to be mighty vigilant in future if we are to
preserve and protect our patches from being bulldozed or gentrified. I for one
intend to brush the mould off my allotment notice board and note down the name
of the local association secretary.

n ``Put a tummy on her, real women have stomachs,'' ordered French designer,
Jean Paul Gaultier, when he came face to face with the prototype for his
bottled fragrance.
The body-bottle is clothed in a detachable copper-coloured corset, and what was
originally underneath was too skinny. Gaultier is chubby and broad, he's a man
who loves his food, and he wants everyone else to enjoy theirs too. He decided,
therefore, that Gaultier, the 75ml spray, should smell edible. The fragrance
consists of vanilla and ginger, and suggests the warmth of a baker's and the
sweetness of hot icing sugar.
Interestingly, the high-camp bottled scent does not appeal to young women but
to more mature types. Maybe then you develop the necessary sense of fun to wear
it. Jean Paul Gaultier has an additional bath range including pebble grey soap
which has a hologram of woman inside when you hold it up to the light.
Jean Paul Gaultier 75ml Eau de Toilette Refillable Natural Spray #46.50; Jean
Paul Gaultier 75ml Eau de Toilette Refill #38.00.
n While we're on perfume, a surefire winner this Christmas is Kashaya de Kenzo
by the Japanese designer. Although he is an oriental, he is fascinated with
India and devised this fragrance as a testament to love, after seeing the Taj
Mahal. The 25ml bottle of Eau de Parfum Spray is #26 and smells like a hundred.
A mixture of apricot and blue rose, lotus flowers and Cattleya orchids, it is
lighter than Guerlain's Shalimar, but just as spicy. The bath range starts at
#10.50.
n Hermes, the scarf house, have launched a perfume named after their Paris shop
- ``24, Faubourg'' - a woody, dusty, religious scent with jasmine, ylang-ylang
and vanilla, which smells as if you've just opened a hundred-year-old trunk in
which silk scarves have lain alongside gold, frankincense and myrrh. It is for
strong, mature women, or for girls who want to go for it in the evenings. It's
classy and it's expensive. Parfum 15ml is #88, Parfum 30ml #135, but 50ml Eau
de Toilette Sprays start at #36.50.

FABER VIDEO BOX SETS (retail, #24.99/#34.99).
NOW, as Max Miller used to say, here's a funny thing: why is it that a film
made out of a book is almost always less posh than the book, but films actually
gain status when they're published as books?
A movie becomes accepted as a classic, such as Citizen Kane, when you can buy
the screenplay and read it quietly at home without all those distracting
pictures; but when Kenneth Branagh makes a film of Henry V, not even Kenny's
best and oldest pals would say that it was the Swan of Avon who was on the
receiving end of the compliment.
Maybe Faber and Faber would know why this is; already possessed of the smartest
movie-book list of any British publisher, they've just launched (handily in
time for Christmas) two very snazzy series of book-and-video boxed sets, any
one of which on your shelf (but which shelf? There's always a problem) will do
more for your film-buff cred than a complete set of French New Wave laserdiscs.
The Film Series sets comprise a video, in widescreen and director's-cut version
as appropriate, and a copy of the screenplay. The first three titles are:
Arthur Penn's Depression masterpiece Bonnie and Clyde (1967, cert 18, #24.99),
whose screenplay includes critical essays, notes on the making of the film, and
material on the social and historical background to the story.
Giuseppe Tornatore's Cinema Paradiso (1989, cert 15, #24.99), a loving
celebration of the power and comfort of movies, set around an Italian village
cinema in the 1950s where a young boy falls in love with the succession of
celluloid dreams. The video is the restored 167-minute version.
Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction (1994, cert 18, #34.99), which needs no
further introduction except that it costs more because you get the soundtrack
CD as well.
The first three sets in the Directors Series, which comprise a book by or about
the director and a video of one of his major films, are:
Tim Burton (#24.99) - a copy of Burton on Burton and a widescreen tape of his
heartbreaking suburban-Frankenstein fairytale Edward Scissorhands (1993, cert
PG), starring Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder.
Martin Scorsese (#24.99) - a copy of the new edition of Scorsese on Scorsese
and a widescreen video of his brutal boxing melodrama Raging Bull (1980, cert
18), regularly voted the best film of the 1980s and an Oscar-winner for Robert
De Niro. This one won't be out until January, to coincide with Scorsese's new
film Casino.
Edward D Wood Jr (#24.99), the master of poignant ineptitude and beloved maitre
of Tim Burton, whose biopic Ed Wood is out on video shortly, is represented by
Rudolph Grey's Visions of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D Wood Jr, and by
his finest cinematic hour (such as it is), Plan 9 From Outer Space (1956, cert
PG), starring Bela Lugosi (posthumously) and many folk weird enough to make
poor old Bela look like James Stewart.
Every one a gem, folks: post early up the lum for Christmas.

NOW is the time to get down to some serious wine buying, when there is an
excuse to crash the #3.99 price barrier for the sake of all that turkey that
lies ahead. Most of us, on such occasions, opt for something French - for that
life-enhancing bottle of claret or burgundy we can't usually afford - even if
it means assessing vintages in a way that New World wines make unnecessary.
But as someone who usually spends at least part of December in Italy, it is
upon Barolo and Brunello, on Gavi and Moscato that my own thoughts tend to
dwell. If I can find something new - and Italy these days is awash with new
ideas - so much the better.
A white that fills the bill - a genuinely appetising aperitivo, but equally
good with a seafood starter - is Gianni Gagliardo's 1994 Casa Favorita del
Piemonte which, because it costs #6.99, has been confined by Oddbins to their
``fine wine'' departments in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Favorita, which is the name
of a grape rather than a statement of preference, used to be one of the
nondescript Italian wines about which nobody had much to say.
The Alba area, from which it comes, is so famous for its hefty reds that its
whites don't get much of a look in. With all that quaffable Dolcetto around,
who wants a feeble Favorita?
Quite a few people nowadays it seems, if Gagliardo's name is on the label. Not
only has this north Italian producer shown belief in the grape, he has
transformed it into one of the most luxurious of dry Italian whites,
impressively smooth, delicately rounded, with a flavour of fruit and nut that
is the outcome, on Gagliardo's part, of almost 20 years of loving attention. In
Alba they now call him Signor Favorita, and it is easy to see why.
If you think #6.99 is a crazy price to pay for an Italian white, bear in mind
that even a humdrum Orvieto is likely to cost you #11 or more in your
neighbourhood pizzeria. But if you insist on something cheaper then Sainsbury's
1994 Cortese del Piemonte at #4.49 is a reasonable second-best. The Cortese
grape, like the Favorita, can be boring or interesting, depending on who is
handling it. Since it's the source of top-class Gavi, however, Italians do tend
to treat it with respect. The Sainsbury version, though a bit hard-edged, has
some flavour - that of lemon and pear, according to the label - to compensate.
Another Sainsbury success is its own label 1994 Frascati Superiore which, at
#4.99, is everything a good Roman wine should be. Totally clean on the palate,
this, too, has enough taste to offset accusations of sterility. But if #4.99
seems too much for something as mundane as Frascati then Oddbins will sell you
an even more mundane 1994 Colli Romani for #2.99 - and pretty good it is at so
risky a price.
For a classy Italian red that is neither a Barolo nor a Brunello, a bottle of
Pasqua's 1990 Amarone Vigneti Casterna shows what a Verona wine should really
taste like. It will make you dissatisfied once and for all with the many thin,
vinegary reds that masquerade as Valpolicella. Corney &amp; Barrow Whighams (who
have opened a tasting room at 31 Rutland Square, Edinburgh, in addition to
their Ayr premises) sell it for #8.74. Most restaurants would charge more than
#20 for it.
Finally a sweet fizz to banish memories of the more cloying sorts of spumante.
It comes from Gianni Gagliardo - with whom this article began - and it comes in
a fashionable bottle with a red seal instead of a label. Don't let this put you
off what is a glorious Moscato del Piemonte, #5.99 from Oddbins Fine Wines,
whose Scottish premises are at 93 Mitchell Street, Glasgow, and 5 Queensferry
Street, Edinburgh.

n F Scott Fitzgerald (ed. Matthew J Brucolli). The Love of the Last Tycoon: A
Western (Abacus, #5.99).
THERE is something poignant and perfect about an unfinished book. This edition
of The Last Tycoon, for many readers (partly because of that unfinishedness)
Fitzgerald's greatest novel, is all the more so because of the inclusion of
many facsimile pages of Fitzgerald's working notes. The reader can more or less
finish it off as he likes. The manuscript itself is unchanged except for the
correction of obvious slips and for the title, one of several Fitzgerald
considered for his wish-fulfilment fantasy figure of Hollywood mogul Monroe
Stahr. Brucolli chose it, I think well, because ``Fitzgerald was in fact
writing a Western - a novel about the last American frontier, where immigants
and sons of immigrants pursued and defined the American Dream''.
n Tobias Wolff. In Pharaoh's Army: Memories of a Lost War (Picador, #5.99).
A SEQUEL to that extraordinary American memoir This Boy's Life, this man's book
takes the author through his army service (volunteered for on his regular
principle that it seemed a good idea at the time) and his years in Vietnam -
but don't let the V-word put you off. Avoiding the standard Nam-writing
alternatives of breast-beating self-reproach and tough-guy narcissism, Wolff
recounts his bootneck years with wit, humanity, and a casual swing in his style
that puts one in mind of Catch-22. The result is funny, moving, and honest.
n Phil O'Keeffe. Down Cobbled Streets: A Liberties Childhood (Brandon, #6.95).
DUBLINERS say there are two kinds of people: real Dubliners and people who wish
they were, which gives this memoir of slum Dublin in the 1930s a decent-sized
potential readership. Unsentimental about poverty but full of warm pride in
family, people, and place, Down Cobbled Streets has the dignity and charm of
plain words and simple storytelling. A good example of the informal history of
the Plain People of Ireland - and everywhere else.
n Tamasin Day-Lewis (ed) Last Letters Home (Pan, #5.99).
LOVE and war bring out the best in letter writers, and this Second World War
collection of letters between British civilians and family and friends in
uniform - not all as final as the ominous title might suggest - is, as well as
variously funny, touching, and sad, a remarkable testimony to the articulacy of
ordinary people in times of trial. When the words are really needed, it seems
that most of us manage to find them.
n Leslie Dick. The Skull of Charlotte Corday and Other Stories (Secker &amp;
Warburg, #9.95).
SHARP as broken glass and challengingly erudite, these nine stories about the
(mostly) female condition deal in a far from simple way with the elementary
stuff that T S Eliot sums up as birth and copulation and death. Approaching
their subject from angles as tangential as the Los Angeles earthquake, the
assassination of John F Kennedy, and the strange history of the skull of the
title story, they demonstrate an originality and a chilly humour that is
faintly unsettling but distinctly memorable.

LIKE every man I have my faults, but quite honestly I do not think there is
much anybody in the world can tell me about oxtail. In my lifetime I must have
consumed a whole herd's worth of these delectable appendages, chewing steadily
through the recipes for them in the classical French authorities.
But oxtail is not an easy cut to deal with. It hardly does for an elegant
dinner party, because even when long and perfectly cooked you can only eat it
all by picking it up to gnaw it, a rewarding but sticky and messy business.
Also, you really have to finish the tail at one go, no small task. It does not
keep well once done. If reheated, the outer layer of flesh turns a little black
and hard, and is no longer so meltingly delicious as in its first flush.
Having attained that degree of expertise in the matter, I was surprised to find
an extraordinary recipe in the cookbook by John Burton-Race, a young English
chef with a brilliant reputation. I have never had the pleasure of visiting his
restaurant, which is somewhere in Berkshire. If I did not know it had already
won two Michelin stars, I would never have believed his dish was possible.
The recipe at least has the virtue of setting out everything step by step, and
this is how it goes. First prepare an oxtail, but not in the ordinary way. Buy
a whole oxtail, and cut it in half. Soak the thick part for 24 hours. Dry it.
Brown it. In the same roasting tray, brown chopped-up vegetables and remove
them. Pour out the fat, pour in red wine, reduce it. Add it to chicken stock in
a casserole, and in this cook the oxtail for up to five hours. Take it out and
cool it.
So far, so simple, but now you have to construct an ``oxtail package.'' Mr
Burton-Race is sanguine about this: ``With a small sharp knife, place the tail
on its back and gently ease the meat away from the bones. If the tail is cooked
properly this should be quite easy. The result should be a rectangular piece of
meat that is quite boneless. With a flat spatula, lift the tail on to a large
piece of cling film, still keeping it flat.''
That was the easy bit. Now dice some mushrooms and mix them with chicken
mousse, prepared in advance. Place the mixture down the middle of the oxtail,
where the bone was, then use the cling film to wrap the flesh round it so as to
reform the tail. Twist each end of the film, to seal the whole thing from the
air, then wrap it in another piece of film. Cook the package for half-an-hour
in simmering water, and cool it. When cold, cut it into six pieces. Put more
mousse on one flat side of each piece. Wrap each piece in caul.
Had enough? Mr Burton-Race has not. Heat the oven. Reduce the stock from the
casserole. Place the pieces of oxtail in the stock in a deep pan, ``and cook
for about 15 minutes, removing every now and again to spoon the stock over the
oxtail. This stock will reduce and become sticky while the mousse cooks. Be
careful not to overcook the topping.'' Boil vegetables to garnish. After the
usual last-minute touches, serve.
This strikes me as the kind of recipe which should never appear in any cookbook
whatsoever. From beginning to end, the preparation takes at least 33 hours. The
effort involved is out of all proportion to any conceivable result. At several
different stages, there is a fair likelihood that he entire process will
collapse in disaster, with no chance of rescue. What happens if you cannot
remove the flesh from the bones neatly, and are left with a mangled mess? What
happens if water gets inside the package, and makes it all googly? What happens
if the mousse squirts out when you cut the tail in pieces? What happens indeed,
if, right at the finish of 33 hours' slaving, you manage to burn the sticky
stock in a hot oven?
A lucky chef will, I think, have failed in the initial attempt to chop the
oxtail in half, given it to the dog and decided to serve his guests cheese
sandwiches instead. Better still, they could all go off to Mr Burton-Race's
restaurant and pay him to do the slaving. I wish him every good fortune, and
hope that one day he gets his third star. But he seems to me to show up very
well the fact that great cooks do not inevitably write great cookbooks, for
which certain special qualities are needed: for instance, some regard to the
practical capacities of the long-suffering housewife working alone in an
ordinary kitchen. For her, this recipe is useless.
It is rather a relief to turn to two other books which may set the aspirant
chef on the way to a good domestic cuisine which is not absurdly demanding.
After all most of us, unlike Mr Burton-Race, do have other things to do than
cook.
Pat Chapman's offering is just right for the busy working lad or lassie, with a
taste for curry, who wants to avoid the dreaded microwave meal in plastic.
There is an admirable range of dishes including all the standard favourites and
some interesting variations, none taking - though the claim is perhaps a little
optimistic - more than 30 minutes.
Just as commendable, one level up, is Fiona Hamilton-Fairley's book for those
who would love to entertain at home but have never dared to. She gives a
complete rundown on the equipment and stocks of basic ingedients that every
pantry should have, timed recipes with unmistakable instructions, and again a
varied selection of recipes, from vegan suppers to carnivorous feasts.

WHAT is it, I wonder, about us fishermen that sometimes gives us a slightly
unsavoury reputation among the great non-angling public? Why are we perceived
as less than truthful as we pursue our lonely vigils by the riverbank or enjoy
a cheerful communal day aboard a boat at sea?
The pursuit of fish is one of man's oldest activities; indeed the fish-hook is
one of his most ancient inventions and writings on fishing are among the
earliest of printed works. The vast selection of fishing literature involves
not just straight descriptions of ``how to do it'' but the realisation that
there is a bit of mystery involved.
That tantalising thin sliver of the surface of the water divides us from an
unknown realm. This gives that realm a magic, which was succinctly put to me by
a gillie on the broad lower Tay one day. I gazed across the popples and gurgles
of the water and said, rather inadequately, that I thought it was a remarkable
piece of water.
``Aye son,'' he said, ``and you're just seeing the tap o' it.'' He was a keen
fisherman with many a tale to tell.
Yet look up ``fisherman's tale'' in the dictionary and you will find the
calumny: ``An implausible and boastful story.'' To further impugn the family of
fishermen, a fishwife is defined as a ``coarse and abusive woman''.
I suppose we anglers must suffer from the old ``you should have seen the one
that got away'' syndrome. The monster that got off just as it was about to be
landed or the specimen roach taken by a pike as you drew it over the landing
net. Nowadays, it can only be that kind of blarney that gives us a bad name.
For, if you decide to keep a fish for the table, it isn't possible to make it
any bigger on the way home, is it? And if, as so many anglers are doing, you
decide to return it to the water, there is almost certain to be a camera in the
fishing bag to record the event. Very well, when the pictures come back, you
might want to add a phantom pound or two to that skate, but since it probably
wasn't weighed absolutely accurately because you didn't want to put the fish
under more stress than was necessary, you might still be guessing under its
actual weight.
In fact, when we were filming for a programme on pike fishing down near
Lochmaben, we came across a couple of characters from the St Helens area who
made the journey north regularly to fish in Scotland. They had caught many pike
from the same water and when I asked if they had ever caught the same fish more
than once, a stream of statistics tripped off their tongues. Yes they had. In
fact, they'd had one fish nine times . . . they could tell by the fact it only
had one eye. They called it Nelson and reckoned it had a suntan because if had
been out of the water so often and it knew exactly when to smile for the
camera. The interesting thing was that it didn't get bigger and bigger every
time they caught it. Sometimes it was lighter because of the feeding conditions
prevalent at the time.
One of the great things about the angling fraternity is its diversity. You will
meet people from every facet of society. And I suppose, as with society, you
will always find the odd chap who will want to bend the rules. At one rainbow
trout fishery, I was told of a chap who seemed to be walking rather stiffly
after his short session. He was asked by the management to remove his waders
before getting into his car and eight rainbows, twice the permit limit, slid
out. I've known men in high office (who had to catch more fish than their
colleagues) who would not be averse to flipping a Toby across a pool well away
from the road on a fly-only river.
However, most of the anglers I meet aren't trying to get away with more fish
than they have paid for or wanting to be top dog. Most simply want to enjoy a
day exploring the fascination that water can offer, either alone or with
like-minded companions. So let's hope future dictionaries will define a
fisherman's tale as: ``A story told by one who has something dramatic to tell.''

NORTH and Midlands, after their eight-try romp against Glasgow on Wednesday,
enter the second round of the inter-district championship tomorrow cast in the
unaccustomed role of title-chasers, even favourites, writes Derek Douglas.
They are at Kelso where South of Scotland, in the enviable position of having
the likes of Gary Armstrong sitting on the bench, will provide more of a
challenge than did weakened Glasgow in midweek.
The Exiles, defending champions as well as operating under a cloud due to the
uncertainty surrounding their status next season, are at Burnbrae where Glasgow
will seek to redress the balance after their mauling in mid-week.
It is a big game for international outcast Eric Peters after Wednesday's dreich
outing against Edinburgh at Richmond, and the Exiles also enjoy the luxury of
an international scrum-half on the bench, Derrick Patterson making way for Andy
Nicol. Teams:
Glasgow (kick-off 1.30) - G Breckenridge (GHK); A T Mathewson (Glasgow
Academicals), I Jardine (Stirling County) (captain), A Garry (Watsonians), A
Turner (Stirling County); C MacGregor (Glasgow Academicals), C Little (GHK); J
Gibson (Stirling County), C Docherty, G McIlwham (both GHK), M Begley (Glasgow
Academicals), M Norval (Stirling County), D McVey (Ayr), G Mackay (Stirling
County), I Sinclair (Watsonians).
Replacements - H Bassi, J Sanderson (both GHK), F Stott (West of Scotland), K
Wilson (GHK), G Doran (Glasgow Academicals), J Lynburn (Ayr).

(Bath); P Burnell (London Scottish), M Scott (Orrell), D Hilton (Bath), A
Nesbitt (London Scottish), J Whittaker (West Hartlepool), D Blyth (Waterloo), E
Peters (Bath), S Holmes (London Scottish).
Replacements - M Kemp, L Mair (both London Scottish), D Patterson (West
Hartlepool), M Stewart (Blackheath), N Mitchell (Stourbridge), I Wynn (Orrell).
South of Scotland (kick-off 2.0) - S Welsh (Hawick); C Joiner (Melrose), D
Grant (Hawick), S Nichol (Selkirk), K Suddon (Hawick); C Chalmers, B Redpath
(both Melrose); G Isaac (Gala), J Hay (Hawick), S McColm (Selkirk), I Elliot
(Hawick), R Brown (Melrose), S Bennett (Kelso), J Amos (Gala), B Renwick
(Hawick).
Replacements - G Parker (Melrose), G Armstrong, R Kirkcpatrick (both
Jed-Forest), K McConnell (Selkirk), H Hunter (Gala), S Scott (Melrose).
North and Midlands - R Shepherd (Melrose); S Burns (Edinburgh Academicals), A
Carruthers (Kirkcaldy), P Rouse (Dundee HS FP), J Kerr (Watsonians); M
McKenzie, K Harper, J Manson, R Cairney (all Stirling County), D Herrington
(Kirkcaldy), S Campbell (Dundee HS FP), S Hamilton (Stirling County), D McIvor

Academicals).
Replacements - J Mitchell (Kirkcaldy), B Easson (Boroughmuir), K Troup, M Waite
(Edinburgh Academicals), W Anderson, S Brown (both Kirkcaldy).
q.MURRAYFIELD is the stand-by venue for both district championship games should
the weather intervene. The Murrayfield switchboard (0131 346 5000) will be
manned from 9.15 tomorrow morning and, similarly, for today's club programme,
secretaries are asked to call Murrayfield if games are hit by bad weather.
q EDINBURGH, who have a blank weekend so far as the inter-district championship
is concerned, have put the free time to good use with a trip to Belfast, where
they will play the Ulster provincial side, who will field four
internationalists.
The Edinburgh side, showing six changes from that defeated 17-6 by the Exiles
on Wesnesday night, is:
S Lang (Heriot's FP); D Macrae (Boroughmuir), S Hastings (Watsonians), D Wyllie
(Stewart's-Melville), F Henderson (Watsonians); A Donaldson (Currie), G Burns
(Stewart's-Melville); G Wilson (Boroughmuir), G McKelvey (Watsonians), S Paul
(Jeriot's FP), D Burns (Boroughmuir), M McVie (Edinburgh Academicals), C Mather
(Watsonians), B Ward (Currie), D Clark (Stewart's-Melville).
Replacements - C Aitken (Heriot's FP), D Laird (Boroughmuir), D Rogerson

World rugby's youth
set to have its fling
THE international festival of youth rugby, which Scotland will host in April
1997, is shaping up to be the most ambitious jamboree the world has seen in the
game.
The four-day festival, the brainchild of three Glasgow enthusiasts, now has won
the support of the Scottish Rugby Union, and will be backed by The Herald. The
event is expected to attract more than 10,000 teenagers from all over the world.
The tournament will take place from April 1-4, with the opening and closing
ceremonies and the finals to be staged at Murrayfield.
The competition will cater for four age-groups, with players born in the years
1982-85 participating in simultaneous leagues.
The concept was conceived inititally by Dr Ronnie Graham, a committee-man and
youth coach with Glasgow Academicals. Another Academical junior coach, Peter
Laverie, and Whitecraigs president John Hutton became involved, and the nucleus
of the organising team was born.
Yesterday, SRU director of rugby, Jim Telfer, declared: ``It is a first-class
idea and, to be truthful, I wish that we had thought of it first. It represents
a great opportunity to raise the profile of the game and to bring to Scotland
youngsters from all over the world.
``It will be an opportunity for them not just to play rugby, but to widen their
horizons in a general sense. It's a tremendous step forward for the game as a
whole.
``The overall organisation is being done by Ronnie Graham and his people, and
we will provide the technical back-up with our development officers and so on.
I can't speak highly enough of the work that they have done. It's excellent and
they deserve a lot of credit for bringing the concept this far,'' said Telfer.
A company has now been set up to handle tournament administration, and more
than 6000 brochures providing details of the competition are being sent out
this week to schools, clubs and governing bodies all over the globe.
In addition to the Home Nations, invitations are going to France, Australia,
New Zealand, South Africa, Italy, Argentina, Japan, USA, Canada, Belgium,
Denmark, Western Samoa, Romania, and Spain.
Players and coaches will be accommodated at centres throughout Scotland, and
the proposal is that games will take place in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, St
Andrews, Stirling, the Borders, and Perthshire.
Each team will play 12 games, each of 15 minutes' duration, over the two days
of league competition, with the finalists converging at Murrayfield on April 4.
In addition to the sporting action, the organisers also will lay on a rock
concert, firework display, sightseeing trips, and other recreational activities.
Laverie, who is chairman of Glasgow Academicals' youth section, said: ``What we
wanted to do was to raise the profile of youth rugby, and at the same time to
provide a unique event that would allow youngsters from different countries and
different backgrounds to celebrate the game of rugby as well as taking part in
a meaningful competition.
``Bringing children from all over the world to Scotland also underlines the
global nature of the game and gives them the chance to play rugby and the
opportunity to experience a country that, perhaps, they would not otherwise
have seen.
``We took the concept to the SRU and, right from the start, they were
incredibly enthusiastic and really took it on board. Now that the thing is off
the starting blocks, we've realised that something which began over the
diningroom table requires a full-time effort, and we've set up Keysport
Scotland as the company which will handle the mammoth task of administering the
undertaking,'' he said.
Iain Forbes, managing director of Caledonian Newspapers, said: ``We see our
involvement in the tournament as an extension of our unrivalled rugby coverage.
We are keen to see the game prosper, and an obvious starting point is at youth
and junior level.
``This will be a major event on a global scale which represents a good
opportunity for Scotland to show what we can do. We're already involved in
football with the Herald Sevens national competition, and we're equally pleased
to support rugby at junior level as well.''

The regeneration of
a city, argues Michael Pacione, must be shaped from within, rather than left to
the creative whims of outsiders
THE approach of a new year, and of a new millennium, encourages people to
engage in reflection and stocktaking. It is a time to look back on past
achievements and mistakes and forward to, hopefully, better times. The same is
true for Glasgow. What are the prospects for the city as it approaches the
millennium? How has the city responded to the economic and social shockwaves of
the last quarter of the twentieth century? Have those responsible for guiding
the development of the city been successful? Have the foundations been laid for
sustainable urban regeneration? Or will Glasgow arrive at the millennium party
in old clothes and with a dirty face?
Let's pause to consider the main causes of the problems confronting Glasgow and
examine the effects of recent policies designed to enhance the socio-economic
health of the city and its citizens. Let us seek to identify some of the
ingredients of a prescription for the future well-being of the city.
While it is of little consolation to those experiencing social and economic
disadvantage, Glasgow is not unique in experiencing the pain of economic
contraction and urban restructuring. Many of the world's cities are currently
undergoing social, economic, political and environmental changes of
unprecedented magnitude. Such changes are the outcome of the interplay of
decisions taken by a host of private and public interests operating at a
variety of geographic scales, from global to local. In order to understand the
consequences of these changes for Glasgow it is necessary to acknowledge the
working of the capitalist system and the rise of a global economy.
An inherent characteristic of the capitalist global economic system is the
creation of uneven development which stems from the prosperity of capital to
flow to locations which offer the greatest potential economic return. This
differential use of space by capital in pursuit of profit creates a mosaic of
inequality at all geographical scales.
At any one time certain countries, regions, cities and communities will be in
the throes of decline as a result of the retreat of capital investment while
others will be experiencing the impact of capital inflows. Older industrial
cities like Glasgow have been among the biggest losers in this global
investment competition, with large areas economically and socially devastated
by the effects of global economic restructuring and the deindustrialisation of
the British economy. Within the city the outcome of the uneven development
process is seen in the poverty, powerlessness and polarisation of localities
which, though remaining meaningful places to their residents, are not regarded
as profitable spaces by capital.
Cities vary in their capacity to meet the challenge posed by globalisation and
this is reflected in the extent to which each can shape, or merely react to,
global forces. In the case of Glasgow the harshness of current economic reality
is illuminated by comparing its nineteenth-century status as industrial
powerhouse and workshop of the world with present circumstances in which the
city's development is influenced to a significant extent by forces beyond its
control. Even more striking is the fact that the day-to-day well-being of a
family in Easterhouse can be determined by decisions taken in the boardroom of
a multinational corporation located in one of the ``command cities'' of the
global economy.
Although the power of global forces to influence city growth or decline is
awesome it is not omnipotent. Economic and political action undertaken at a
national level or by regional groupings of nation states (such as the EC) or,
to a lesser extent, by local governments can modify the effects of the global
economic system.
Regulatory and tax policies shape the environments which attract or repel
investors. Decisions about public investment determine whether infrastructure
(such as housing, hospitals, roads, and schools) will be built or allowed to
deteriorate. Government procurement policy, (including the naval shipbuilding
contracts on which Yarrow depends), stimulates the local economy, and the
inter-governmental transfer payments (either directly through Urban Aid or via
agencies such as the Glasgow Development Agency) can prevent the collapse of a
local economy.
Unfortunately for Glasgow, since 1979, the emphasis in Government policy has
been to promote national economic growth irrespective of its geographical
distribution within the country. This has only indirectly addressed the
difficulties experienced by these localities which are marginal to the
market-driven development process.
Recent changes in the relationship between central and local government have
also reduced Glasgow's ability to tackle its problems. In the late 1970s, in
the face of increasing fiscal crises and the consequent search for cuts in
public spending, the earlier consensus between central and local government,
manifested in the GEAR project, was replaced by growing conflict and increased
central intervention in traditional areas of local authority responsibility
such as housing (through controls on capital spending and council house sales
policy), and tight control over local finance. The effect was increased
centralisation of power alongside decentralisation of service responsibility.
The ensuing need for Glasgow to seek financial support by entering into
partnerships with public agencies, such as the Scottish Development
Agency/Scottish Enterprise and the private sector has weakened the leadership
role of the local authority and reduced its ability to develop
locally-sensitive strategies for urban renewal. While some would see this trend
as desirable, others view it as a sign of a continued and unwelcome reduction
in the autonomy of local government.
The latest round of local government reforms which removed the higher tier
authorities also ignored the fact that the functional boundary of the City of
Glasgow extends well beyond its administrative area. While a number of
conflicts arose between the city and the regional authority, not least with
reference to planning and development issues, proponents of regional government
would contend that a major success was its ability to effect resource
redistribution through the tax system. This, of course, is one of the main
reasons why suburban local authorities around Glasgow have long resisted
integration with the city to form a functional city region.
Nevertheless, it is axiomatic that strategic planning at a level which
acknowledges the functional linkages within a city region is essential for
effective government. The question for debate is whether this should be
provided by a regional tier of government, by collaboration between unitary
local authorities for specific programmes, by a body such as a West of Scotland
Planning Commission, or possibly by a unitary system overseen by a Scottish
Assembly. These are important questions for the future.
The depth of Glasgow's current social and economic difficulties was highlighted
first in 1971 when analysis of the census placed Clydeside at the top of the
national deprivation league. Over the intervening years the nature and location
of the city's problems have changed. Between 1971 and 1981 the traditional
tenement areas of the inner city characterised by large areas of substandard
housing, recorded a relative improvement in status. This was largely a result
of a massive clearance and redevelopment programme undertaken by the local
authority combined, in some areas, with modernisation and new building by
housing associations and private developers.
This policy involved the large-scale relocation of residents in a general
process of decentralisation. By 1981 it was apparent that the focus of
deprivation, marked primarily by social and economic problems related to
unemployment and overcrowding, had shifted to the public-sector housing estates
on the edge of the city. The need for policy instruments that reflected this
new geography of need was also starkly evident.
The policy response to this revealed geography of need was unequivocal. This is
borne out by examination of the distribution of capital investment undertaken
by the main public and private agencies responible for Glasgow's development
during the 1980s.
This indicates, and most significantly, the dearth of investment in these areas
by either the Scottish Development Agency or the private sector. During its
lifetime the SDA saw itself as a body to exploit the advantages of the Scottish
economy and not as an agency for the socio-economic regeneration of depressed
council estates. As far as the private sector is conerned the outer estates are
``no-go areas''. In practice, throughout the 1980s, despite their designation
as ``planning priority areas'' the peripheral estates received little priority
in terms of attracting more investment or public-agency activity.
In areas such as Glasgow's outer estates central Government's hope of urban
revitalisation through ``capitalism with a social conscience'' is a chimera.
Glasgow's experience of the operation of pro-growth business coalitions (such
as the Chamber of Commerce), civic boosterism (characterised by slogans like
Glasgow's Miles Better and Glasgow's Alive), and local enterprise initiatives
(eg Glasgow Action) confirms that while the market approach may be a logical
response in areas of significant economic potential, it is extremely unlikely
that such a ``top down'' approach will take account adequately of the needs of
the poor, the unemployed, and the deprived residents of the most disadvantaged
areas of the city.
Justification for the Government's market-led approach to urban regeneration
centres on the concept of ``trickle down'' which argues that, in the longer
term, an expanded city revenue base created by central area revitalisation
provides funds that can be used to address social needs. In practice, however,
these funds are generally recycled into further development activity. Nowhere
has a substantial ``trickle down'' effect been demonstrated. The privatisation
of urban development inevitably means accepting a policy of triage and
concentrating on areas of greatest economic potential, with adverse
consequences for other areas.
In Glasgow, despite some involvement by private housebuilders in the outer
estates, the evidence suggests that large-scale regeneration will not occur if
left to market forces. Indeed, it is unrealistic to expect private capital, the
behaviour of which is conditioned by the precepts of risk minimisation and
profit maximisation, to take the lead in redeveloping the peripheral estates.
Easterhouse, (as well as the other outer estates), contains the population of a
medium-sized town. While its disadvantages are apparent, its advantages include
a location on the national motorway network, large areas of developable land, a
resident trainable labour force, and the not inconsiderable ``sweat equity'' of
the local communities (as demonstrated in the Calvay housing co-operative,
Easthall Residents Association, and Easterhouse Festival Society). The catalyst
required to initiate development is a major Government effort similar to that
invested in the GEAR project, or the post-war new towns.
Despite the stark identification of the problems of Glasgow's outer city by
analyses of the last two censuses, and the rhetoric of the Government's New
Life for Urban Scotland report, little has been achieved to alleviate the
difficulties confronting Glasgow's marginalised people and places. In 1993 the
theme of inter-agency co-operation was restated in the formation of the Glasgow
Regeneration Alliance, comprising the local authorities, Glasgow Development
Agency and Scottish Homes, with a remit to invest #1.5bn over 10 years in eight
``priority action areas'' of Greater Easterhouse, Castlemilk, Drumchapel,
Gorbals, Govan, the East End, Glasgow North, and Greater Pollok.
While the improved correspondence between designated action areas and the
revealed areas of need is a positive step critics have questioned how much of
the investment represents ``new money'', as well as the future of the alliance
following the abolition of the regional tier of government in 1996.
To address Glasgow's problems succesfully, urban policy must possess both a
social and economic dimension. It must be concerned as much about the
distribution of wealth as about wealth creation. Such social criteria fit
awkwardly into the conventional balance sheet of economic progress. An
effective attack on Glasgow's problems requires appropriate action at several
scales.
At the national level, a primary requirement is recognition of the fact that
the disadvantaged position of the poor is linked to the privileged position of
the wealthy. This requires enacting a policy that addresses directly the
fundamental question of the distribution of society's wealth. The position of
marginalised populations would also be improved by the creation of a new form
of partnership involving state, capital and citizens.
This would acknowledge the different motives of the partners and enable each to
achieve some of their goals within a framework that facilitates greater
distribution of wealth and opportunity in favour of the disadvantaged. In the
shorter term, easing central Government controls over local authorities would
enable the lower tier to undertake activities of direct benefit to local groups.
Local authorities could promote new forms of tenure and job opportunities by
operating as landowners and developers, or could employ income (eg from council
house and land sales) for the benefit of the disadvantaged areas. Local
government itself must seek to devise more effective strategies to attract
private-sector funding into deprived areas. This will involve both persuasion
(eg via rates relief or flexible planning) and direction (such as linked
development and leverage schemes), with the particular mix depending on the
strength of the local economy.
Local authorities must also accept the principle of subsidiarity. In practice,
this requires for the empowerment of local communities to capitalise on human
resources, and promotion of aided self-help (as pioneered in housing
co-operatives and community businesses).
This will demand a willingness to devolve financial and political power to the
neighbourhood level, with greater participation of residents in budget
formulation and plan preparation for their area. Implementation of such an
agenda is undoubtedly problematic in the short term, not least because it
represents a challenge to the ideology of current urban policy. However, as the
experience of Glasgow demonstrates, failure to achieve policies with an
enhanced social component will ensure that the crisis affecting large sections
of the city will persist well into the twenty-first century.
Since the turn of the century Glasgow has undergone a series of painful
readjustments to changing global economic circumstances, and the modern city
must strive to establish its position in the new world order. Its position as
Second City of the Empire has long gone, and in European terms it is one of a
number of older industrial cities in the throes of regeneration. The world has
moved on and Glasgow has to operate, and increasingly compete, in new political
and economic circumstances.
Most significant of these, and in marked contrast to a time when the city was
at its peak of prosperity, is the rise of a global economic system largely
outwith the control of a single country, or indeed, city. Of equal significance
at the UK level has been the shift in emphasis in public policy and finance
from local to national government.
Both of these structural trends constrain the power of Glasgow to initiate the
necessary social and economic strategies to resolve its current problems. The
task facing the city - to complete a reorientation of its economic base,
restore its economic fortunes, and to ensure fair distribution of the wealth
created - is a daunting one. Only time will tell whether Glasgow is up to the
challenge.

ONE hundred years ago Vesuvius erupted, created a new crater and initiated the
shockwaves of an earthquake which rocked Florence. John Major's early morning
cup of cappuccino followed by a light lunch of pasta and a glass of Chianti
with the Italian Prime Minister Lamberto Dini in that city this week could well
have the same seismic effect on the Labour Party.
It is part of the Prime Minister's grand strategy to win him the next election.
Increasingly, he is convinced the issue which has dogged him and his
predecessor - Europe - is the wildcard which can trump Tony Blair. Forging an
alliance with Signor Dini to oppose the Franco/German plans for a single
currency by 1999, due to be discussed at next week's Madrid summit, is the
first attempt to play it.
No wonder Mr Blair, with his mind on other things, was so flustered during his
visit to Scotland yesterday that he was offering hostages to fortune over the
tartan tax. Apparently it will not be implemented unless the electorate votes
for it. So the assembly will have to be dissolved each time it is proposed.
Will the same be true of Westminster if Gordon Brown as Chancellor wants to put
up taxes? Or will the parliament in London be ruled with an iron fist and that
in Edinburgh with a limp wrist? When will the Scots confined to their creche on
Calton Hill be able to join the grown-ups?
Unfortunately, this faux pas, like others before it seemed to leave Labour
unscathed and the Tories floundering unable, so far, to find an answer as to
how to derail the Blair bandwagon. It is because the Labour leader is an ad
man's dream. He is good looking, articulate, intelligent and the voters
perceive him as courageous and a man of integrity. The media, sensing the
``near inevitability of his Prime Ministership, have reflected this by
unthinkingly conspiring to give him an easy ride. A luxury never permitted
Wilson or Callaghan.
The Conservatives did try to brand him as ``Bambi'' but his squaring up to the
unions over Clause 4 afforded him the opportunity to display his macho
crudentials. Even the accusations that his few declared policies are a ``con''
or that they are ``vacuous'' have fallen on stoney ground, his poll ratings
accelerating with a speed comparable to the American space probe on Jupiter.
The current scare tactics, dreamt up by Tory Central Office, that Blair has a
hidden agenda of socialism, red in tooth and claw, which he will reveal after
election is also pathetic. The public will never swallow it. He is vulnerable
but not in the way those Tory back-room chinless wonders imagine. They will
never come to terms with the Blair phenomenon until they realise it is
underpinned by the man's shrewdness and calculation. Major, in despair, has
fallen back on his own instinct, as he did in the 1992 election when he ignored
these Oxbridge ponces and stepped via his soapbox back to No 10.
This time he again has spotted Labour's (i e Blair's) Achilles heel, Europe. It
is so obvious only those with a First in Greats could have missed it.
Europe is Tony Blair's post-election escape hatch. He is far too clever not to
realise that even a scaled-down version of Labour's economic policy is doomed,
notwithstanding Gordon Brown's cure-all one-off windfall tax. His other problem
is the left in his party who would have the power, depending on the size of
majority, to make him their prisoner.
However, by signing up to the Social Chapter under the Maastricht Treaty, it
will be the European Commission who will determine the pace of socialism in
Britain not the idealists on the National Executive. Furthermore, while the
implementation will disadvantage us against our non-European competitors he
will hope that the protectionism of fortress Europe will cushion that
uncompetitiveness.
He would also want to be bolstered by a powerful, independent Central European
Bank, which, after we have signed up for the Single Currency, would determine
fiscal and monetary policy. It would be like the good old days under Labour in
the mid-1970s when the International Monetary Fund had to be called in to run
our economy. Only this time Labour would be saved that embarrassment and also
that of a sterling crisis. The financial corset of the Bundesbank would stifle
the Loony Left while ensuring measured steps towards Continental corporatism.
Mr Major can expose this deceitful programme by trumpeting the advantages of
Britain's opt-out from the Social Chapter, which has hugely contributed to the
creation of thousands of new jobs from inward investment, by joining with
countries like Italy and Spain in delaying the possibility of a single
currency, and alerting the voters to the consequences of creeping federalism.
It would also be a strong card to play in Scotland where there has been so much
drivel talked about the ``democratic deficit'', particularly from the
Nationalists with their bogus ``Independence in Europe'' platform. If a
``democratic deficit'' - the gap between citizens and institutions - exists
anywhere it is in Europe.
The last thing we want is additional powers to commissioners who are appointed
by governments and who work in secret. The European Parliament is grossly
unrepresentative with one member per 700,000 constituents and such is the
apathy among voters that they are elected on increasingly low turnouts. It has
little power and although in extreme circumstances it could force the
resignation of the Commission, this is as likely as our Queen dissolving the
Commons on a whim. The real power resides with the Council of Ministers over
which the ordinary voter had no direct influence.
This is a genuine debate waiting to take place and which only the Tories can
initiate. It is not anti-Europe it is anti-Federalist but it could scupper Mr
Blair's agenda and create not just a mythical stretch of blue water between the
parties but a yawning chasm.
Not only would it give the electorate the opportunity to have their say on the
kind of Europe they want to see Britain a part of but would present a challenge
to Mr Blair which so far the Tories have failed to deliver.
They will never get away with depicting Mr Blair as an ogre. But the issue of
Europe will represent a dignified test of his sincerity - or lack of it.

Ann Donald wanders through the rooms of poet Edwin Morgan
FRESH from a jam-packed week of readings and part of Glasgay!, Edwin Morgan,
one of Scotland's best-loved poets, is at home to a nosy journalist curious to
check out the room where the illustrious and industrious 75-year-old has
created such timeless and cosmopolitan works to be found in collections such as
From Glasgow to Saturn, The New Divan, and more recently a translation of the
highly-acclaimed play Cyrano de Bergerac.
Stepping through the frosted-glass sliding doors that separate the
workroom/living room from the rest of the flat, is to a degree like stepping
back in time. Were it not for the hi-tech video and TV then this could very
well be a comfortable, domestic scene imported direct from a sixties sitcom,
with its black shiny vinyl settee and comfy chairs, green mosaic coffee table,
elaborate standing window boxes, and durable ``period'' typewriter which takes
pride of place at the worktable.
``I was one of the first to move into this block when it was built in 1962,''
Morgan says of his 30-year-old home, before adding with a smile - ``I still
think of it as my `modern flat'.''
Given the flat's central location and Morgan's reliance on Glasgow's public
transport system it was ideal when he was lecturing in literature at the
University of Glasgow throughout the sixties, seventies, and eighties. This
particular room, which has the bonus of facing both south and west, and is thus
privy to as near to a Mediterranean amount of sunshine that Scottish weather
permits, also proved to be more comfortable to write in than the proposed
``claustrophobic'' study or indeed his short-lived timeshare holiday home
overlooking Loch Rannoch.
``I'm a real city person so I like to look out of my windows at the people
walking by and listen to the noise of the traffic,'' he reveals before
proceeding utterly to destroy that glorious Wordsworthian myth of the tortured
writer seeking his muse among the bracken and heather of a silent countryside.
``I thought going up to Loch Rannoch I would be able to shut myself away from
all the modern distractions and just write like mad,'' he says. ``But I looked
out at the loch and trees and just didn't feel inspired. I missed all the noise
so I sold it,'' admits the confirmed urban dweller with a shrug.
It is here, then, on his sensible and sturdy original 1962 model of a German
Adler Bluebird typewriter, that Morgan types away in the afternoons or evenings
on whatever constitutes his current project, be it poetry, plays, or
translations. ``This is extremely well-made,'' he nods, giving the machine a
friendly pat, ``and it does for my purposes very well.''
Though not a Luddite by any stretch of the imagination - the hi-tech fax and
dinky photocopying machine in his study testify to this - he is unwilling to
trade in the reliable Adler for an alien computer. ``I bought an Amstrad once
but I never got to really love it,'' he sighs. ``It's just an age gap I suppose
but I like to type and see the whole object in front of me rather than write a
poem on a computer when it may disappear if the computer crashes or there's a
power cut as happened here a few weeks ago.''
The workdesk the compact Adler rests upon has a very orderly army appearance
with the essential tools of any scribe neatly laid out in rows: a stapler, a
punch, multi-coloured glass paperweights, calculator - to calculate those
author advances? - sharpened pencils and neatly stacked piles of notes for a
future project. ``These are for a collaborative work with the saxophonist Tommy
Smith at the next Jazz Festival,'' says Morgan as he flicks through a handful
of picture postcards of wild Scottish animals that form the visual inspiration
for the proposed series of poems called Beasts of Scotland, which are intended
to inspire Smith's own creative jazz juices.
Visual inspiration also comes via the cluster of eclectic paintings that face
Morgan's workdesk and are scattered throughout the flat. A number of Glasgow
Boy Peter Howson's less stridently macho works, unrecognisable in their beauty
of colour and delicacy of touch, decorate the hall and living room.
Turning his gaze from the most recent acquisition - a small allegorical version
of Cain and Abel, Morgan then points out his favourite, The Head. ``I love the
extraordinary expression on the man's face,'' he says peering closer into the
very whites of the portrait's startled eyes. As well as Howson and a
shoe-box-sized Stephen Campbell in the hall, other artists culled from a
typical RSA roll-call include Pat Douthwaite's abstract interpretation of the
pursuit of Greek goddess Rhea by Zeus and a beautiful evocative Joan Eardley
street scene of children outside a sweetie shop, which so moved Morgan that he
was inspired to write the simply titled poem, ``To Joan Eardley''.
The unquestionably dominant interior feature in Morgan's home is of course the
thousand of books which he reveals are to be gifted to the Mitchell Library in
the event of his death. ``They come round every Hogmanay to collect a batch,''
he chuckles. ``It's the only way I have of keeping them under control.'' Indeed
a fleeting glance at the vast selection of English and foreign literature
adorning the walls of his study and hall not only suggest the words ``Brazilian
rain forest'' but makes one realise what a tremendous coup the Mitchell have
pulled off in being the lucky recipients of Morgan's personal library.
In the dark study where he confesses, somewhat abashed, that he only comes ``to
hide from the cleaning woman every week'' there is the Scottish literature
section that encompasses everything from medieval Scots to Irvine Welsh, a
comprehensive A to Z of modern twentieth-century poetry, countless shelves of
musty leather-bound bibliographies, anthologies and dictionaries, before the
paper trail explodes out into the hall which in turn boasts a foreign
literature collection that would give the British Library a serious run for its
money.
Let's hope that the Mitchell have to wait a good few years yet before they get
their hands on the contents of Morgan's workplace.

STUDIES have shown that British people, when faced with American know-how often
have a bit of an inferiority complex. Not that I'm saying Americans are
arrogant, just that when the average American starts to talk, they tend to
speak as though they have a right to be arrogant.
We don't feel inferior to all Americans, especially not those who take part in
TV talk shows dealing with ``human stories''. It's difficult to be impressed by
someone who's bubbling away on national TV while there's a caption flashing
beneath them saying ``Bettye-Soo: Broke up with boyfriend because of his
cocaine-addicted dog''.
So, chat show guests apart, we all agree that the Yanks in general have a good
reputation, and as they say in Louisiana, when they talk turkey, they don't
mean stuffin'. Maybe they get their image from the films, where the hero is
inevitably a square-jawed WASP who has a full grasp of science, arts, and car
maintenance. After watching them for years, we assume Americans are all like
that.
Except Jim Carrey. We know he's not smart because, Hollywood tells us, he is in
the process of becoming a huge star because of his ability to make his face
look funny while speaking in a hilarous manner. Although careers have been
built on this, as per, say Malcolm Rifkind, it's unlikely that he will do as
well as the film bosses think. So except for tele-emotional cripples and Jim
Carrey, Yanks have a fairly good reputation, right?
This is what had me worried when I was there for a few days last week. I had to
go to Baltimore to give a talk on a subject that is far too boring for a
respectable family newspaper. The Americans at the conference were exactly the
sort of smart, Apple Pie guys that would grace any film screen, and that's what
put the fear of Gawd into me. I don't mind making a fool of myself on my home
patch, but I don't want to look too stupid in the Land Of the Free, and if
anyone was going to catch me out it was these smarter, harder working, fitter
more committed Americans.
Everyone in America is extremely pleasant, but they are all congenitally unable
to understand the clear-cut tones and slow diction that characterises typical
Glaswegian speech. After the first two days where everyone thought I was Irish,
Norwegian or German, I had slowed down my words significantly. Even if they
didn't understand what I was saying, at least they all realised I was Scottish.
I thought I was ready for my talk.
On the big day I really felt terrible. The day creaked along slowly, and my
palms got sweatier as the appointed hour got nearer. I remember the chairman
calling my name, and Glasgow being pronounced (as always by Americans) as Glass
Cow. The soundtrack for the next few seconds is just the double boom of the
blood rushing through my head. My voice was at first exactly like the teacher's
voice in the Charlie Brown cartoons, and for what seemed like an eternity, the
audience went quiet.
I got to the punchline of my first gag. Nothing. There were a few loud guffaws
from the back, and slowly the rest of the audience got the cue that I had made
a joke. My nerves disappeared. I had thought that they would all be too serious
to ever laugh. You only have to see any sitcom other than the two good ones to
realise that their tolerance for cruddy jokes is actually quite high.
The next day, I went on a present-buying spree. I make a better job of buying
presents in America than my gran used to. In the sixties and seventies she used
to return from the States with her case full of gimmicky nonsense: case-loads
full of tat like Santa-shaped napkin rings, fridge magnets and Kids' drinking
straws that had been moulded into amusing curly shapes. We had Scotland's
biggest collection of American junk, the entire New York branch of
Fridge-Magnets R Us having been bought up by my gran.
Anyway, as part of a family tradition, I was paying for my collection of
camel-shaped monogrammed coasters when the young blonde cashier spotted my
accent. She said that Scottish accents like mine were, and I quote,
``beautiful''. I drew in my stomach and gave a sort of David Hasselhoff smile,
and in a cool, but basically suave manner, I joked that it would be beautiful
if only people could understand me. She fell for this obvious compliment
fishing. ``Not at all, I understand you easily,'' she gushed. ``You're easier
to understand than some of my friends, and English is their first language!'' I
gave up and sneaked out.

``Who reads this sort of book?'' and end up addicted, with a serious hobby. All
the designs are so attractive and look so straightforward, that the most

Twelve months of literary luxury: Herald writers and regular reviewers continue
their selection of books which impressed, moved and inspired them
LESLEY DUNCAN
n Sophie's World, Jostein Gaarder (Phoenix House, #16.99)
NORWEGIAN author Jostein Gaarder has said endearingly of Sophie's World that he
feared it would fall ``between all stools'' but instead it had fallen on them.
His book is indeed a phenomenon - a survey of Western philosophy embedded in a
magical mystery story. The aim of the Sophie-in-Wonderland plot is to make the
intellectual demands of the core material less formidable. It succeeds.
Millions of copies have been sold worldwide. Readers are kept enthralled by the
sparky heroine's encounters with the messenger dog Hermes and the enigmatic
Alberto Knox. The latter is determined to make Sophia think about the basic
questions of existence (and tell her what successive philosophers have made of
them). The fact that the tale involves reality within reality is itself a
paradigm of the philosophical matter it is handling. Too deep for comfort? Not
a bit of it.
JOHN FOWLER
n The New Naturalists, Peter Marren (HarperCollins, #14.99 paperback, also
available in hard cover)
Naturalist, Edward O Wilson (Allen Lane, #20)
IN wartime Soho, Billy Collins the publisher, the scientist Julian Huxley and
two others met for lunch to discuss a proposed series of nature books to be
written by specialists for the interested general reader.
The New Naturalist books were born. The first volume, on butterflies, appeared
in 1945. Number six was Frank Fraser Darling's Natural History in the Highlands
and Islands, later revised by J Morton Boyd, himself the author with his son of
The Hebrides (published 1990), number 76 in the series. Fifty years on new
titles still appear. Peter Marren's The New Naturalists charts the half-century
history of this enriching library. Lively, shrewd and carefully researched,
it's endlessly fascinating. So is Naturalist, by the eminent American
entomologist Edward O Wilson, which is both a beguiling memoir of his life and
an insight into contemporary views on biology and the natural world.
ANVAR KHAN
n Paula by Isabel Allende (HarperCollins, #14.99)
I NOMINATE Paula by Isabel Allende, because the novel is a sign of strength.
Hers.
Some writers believe you have to give part of yourself in a piece of work. They
say that even fiction demands some truth. Poets ``soul-search'' because they
think good literature is created by loneliness and the unconscious mind.
It was never in Allende's remit, to adopt the writer's version of the
philosophy of aerobics - no pain, no gain. But she decided to make one chapter
of her life a full novel. Her daughter died, and the only way she could recover
was by writing it all down.
A novelist is a tourist with a typewriter, one part appreciation, one part
detachment. But a great writer is someone who was as lost as Allende, but can,
and without cynicism, showcase a talent so big it stands brighter for her
confusion.
n Gridiron, Phillip Kerr (Chatto and Windus, #15)
Dead Man's Walk, Larry McMurtry (Orion, #15.99)
The Paperboy, Pete Dexter (Viking, #14.99)
SCOTS author Phillip Kerr has been threatening to write the Real Belter for
years and with Gridiro, a marvellous edge-of-the-seat thriller set in a
futuristic LA skyscraper, he appears to have finally done it. The genuinely
thrilling result of a wildly fertile imagination and a rare combination of fine
writing and popular appeal. Elsewhere, Dead Man's Walk, Larry McMurtry's
sublime ``prequel'' to Lonesome Dove is worth its weight in gold. A wonderful
elegiac cowboy book. And, finally, a word of praise for Pete Dexter's The
Paperboy, a great novel by a brilliant writer at the peak of his abilities. A
crime book which transcends the genre.
STEWART LAMONT
n Law &amp; Practice of the Kirk, Andrew Herron, (Chapter House, #20)
SCIENCE and theology, once happily married in alchemy, were apparently divorced
last century. Since then, books on theology by scientists were either few and
far between or strictly of the atheist persuasion. Now each year there are
several examples of such books in which biologists and physicists seem to wish
to reclaim theology as ``queen of the sciences''. None are exactly easy bedtime
reading. Even less so must seem my choice, which brings together the uneasy
bedfellows of law and gospel, whose marriage in Calvinism gave the Kirk of
Scotland a character of its own.
But Andrew Herron's Law &amp; Practice of the Kirk, is more than a textbook for
legally minded ecclesiastics. That role was filled by Cox, the tome of practice
and procedure which was essential reading for Kirk cognoscenti but few others.
Dr Herron's book might be described as Cox without the boring bits (ie the
edicts and laws which are now printed in looseleaf form). It blends a guide to
Kirk lore with a commentary that might easily qualify as ``all you ever needed
to know about the Kirk''. The fact that the book is already in its third
printing and has sold more than 2000 copies, suggests that its appeal is a lot
wider that the 1400 manses in which it will be essential reading.
Where else would you learn that a minister, whose glebe borders a loch upon
which the laird enjoys sole fishing rights, can assert his own right to fish if
he has been there more than 13 years? The bulk of the book is less esoteric and
a lot more instructive about the national church than many history books, and
has the advantage of doubling as a DIY manual for those involved in
congregational affairs.

their tracks
CAROL ANDERSON
Snow Falling On Cedars, David Guterson (Bloomsbury, #5.99)
Volume of Plays, Sharman MacDonald (Faber, #8.99)
Voices and Votes, edited by Glenda Norquay (Manchester University Press, #14.99)
So I Am Glad, A L Kennedy (Jonathan Cape, #9.99)
THE novel that has lodged most in my mind this year is David Guterson's Snow
Falling On Cedars, a gripping, intelligent whodunnit set on an island off the
Pacific north-west coast. It offers a sensitive account of relations between
German/Scandinavian and Japanese/Americans, and is often moving.
I'm currently reading A L Kennedy's thought-provoking novel So I Am Glad, but
as I imagine it will be much mentioned, I'll draw attention instead to Sharman
MacDonald's Volume of Plays. And I want to mention an interesting anthology,
Voices and Votes, edited by Glenda Norquay, a selection of short stories, poems
and extracts from novels and autobiographies, dealing with the women's suffrage
campaign of the early twentieth century.
DAVID BELCHER
n High Fidelity, Nick Hornby (Victor Gollancz, #14.99)
alt.culture, edited by Nathaniel Wice and Steven Daly (4th Estate, #12.99)
1996 Guinness Soccer Who's Who, compiled by Jack Rollin (Guinness Books, #7.99)
AFTER the high-scoring success of his soccer memoir, Fever Pitch, Nick Hornby
faced an all-too-inevitable backlash with his first novel, High Fidelity, a
story of love, vinyl and male inadequacy. Too autobiographical, his detractors
sneered. Two-nil to Nick Hornby, we, his fans retort. High Fidelity sits
toppermost of our adult contemporary soul charts, truly.
Unsnared by the Internet? A floating voter in the micro-politics of identity?
Wise up by cyber-surfing through alt.culture, edited by Nathaniel Wice and
former Orange Juicer Steven Daly. Starting with Abortion clinic violence and
ending at Zines, this encyclopaedia of the nineties is as assertively diverse
as the decade itself. But stuff cyber-surfing. Instead, trawl the 1996 Guinness
Soccer Who's Who, comprehensively compiled by Jack Rollin, for players of
promise (and cheapness) to augment Partick Thistle's current heroes.

n Winter Tales, George Mackay Brown (John Murray, #15.99)
The Heart of India, Mark Tully (Penguin, #16)
IF the essence of good writing is simplicity of style, George Mackay Brown is a
master of the craft. His prose is sparse yet lyrical, conjuring vivid images of
his native Orkney through the eyes of generations of seafarers, warriors, and
crofters. His latest collection of short stories, Winter Tales, is as fresh and
vibrant as ever, confirming Brown's position as Scotland's most compelling
story-teller.
A similar economic style, combined with a distinguished journalist's eye for
fine detail, makes The Heart of India, by Mark Tully a fascinating account of
an ancient culture besieged by brash modernity. The short stories from Uttar
Pradesh, based on real characters and incidents, are reminiscent of Kipling at
his best in portraying a complex society with sympathy and understanding.
ALAN BOLD
n The Moor's Last Sigh, Salman Rushdie (Jonathan Cape, #15.99)
Auden, Richard Davenport-Hines (Heinemann, #20)
Michelangelo, George Bull (Viking, #25)
SALMAN RUSHDIE has done it again and I don't mean causing political controversy
with a novel. The Moor's Last Sigh is more than a newsworthy work of faction;
it is a magical fiction about the meaning of fiction. The narrator tells a
story about himself telling a story: ``we are no more than the few tales that
persist.'' This magnificently telling tale, haunted by horror and betrayal,
will persist long after Rushdie is allowed to rest in peace.
``About suffering they were never wrong,/The Old Masters'', so said W F Auden,
whose sufferings are sympathetically considered by Richard Davenport-Hines in
Auden. Interestingly, since so many biographies out macho men as closet queens,
Davenport-Hines outs the openly homosexual Auden as a secret straight in this
admirable assessment of a modern master.
Which only leaves me a sentence to commend an Old Master admired by Auden's
hero T S Eliot who watched the women come and go, talking of Michelangelo.
George Bull's Michelangelo entertainingly puts you in the picture and the
sculpture and the architecture and the poetry.
KEITH  BRUCE
n The Missing, Andrew O'Hagan (Picador, #14.99)
The Road to Xanadu, Orson Welles, Simon Callow (Jonathan Cape, #20)
High Fidelity, Nick Hornby (Victor Gollancz, #14.99)
The Destiny of Nathalie X, William Boyd (Sinclair Stevenson, #9.99)
ANDREW O'HAGAN'S The Missing is a superb piece of journalism, the more welcome
because it comes during a slide towards tabloid values. His melding of family
memoir with sociological and historical analysis, ignited by his coverage of
the Fred West case, is in a proud Scottish tradition in the craft. Orson
Welles, The Road to Xanadu, is biography at its best, fascinated but critical,
and the work of an under-appreciated theatrical polymath, Simon Callow.
William Boyd's collection of short stories The Destiny of Nathalie X, is a
global and philosophical tour of his oeuvre - and proof of what a smart jacket
can do for sales. Nick Hornby's High Fidelity (Victor Gollancz, #14.99), should
be prescribed reading for women everywhere who find us chaps difficult to
comprehend. Too close for comfort from this perspective, but you gotta laugh.
JOHN CAMPBELL
n Gladstone, Roy Jenkins (Macmillan, #20)
Accountable to None: The Tory Nationalisation of Britain, Simon Jenkins (Hamish
Hamilton, #16.99)
FOR sheer historical verve, the biography of the year is Roy Jenkins's
Gladstone. It is a book of fans, admittedly: his critics will think it
self-indulgent, but his admirers will find inimitable delights on every page.
It is not so much a biography, actually, as a sustained narrative reflection,
as Lord Jenkins marvels at Gladstone's amazing physical and intellectual energy
(his life conveniently measured out in quarter-hours) and gently mocks his more
bizarre absurdities, while effortlessly drawing comparisons across 150 years of
political life. Among other surprises he claims Gladstone - father from Leith,
mother from Dingwall - as the most Scottish of Prime Ministers.
The sharpest book on current politics is Simon Jenkins's Accountable to None:
The Tory Nationalisation of Britain - the most devastating account yet of how
Thatcherism, like most revolutions, has produced outcomes contrary to its
professed intentions. Essential reading for all politicians - but will they
read it?
BERTIE DENHAM
n Come to Grief, Dick Francis (Michael Joseph, #15.99)
Beyond the Silence, Ted Allebury (Hodder and Stoughton, #16.99)
The Island of the Dead, Philip Hook (Hodder and Stoughton, #15.99)
IN Come to Grief by Dick Francis, an injured jockey turned investigator puts
one of his best friends, a cult racing television hero, in the dock for a
particularly nauseating crime. This year's offering must stand highly among
Dick's other 32.
Ted Allebury is author of Beyond the Silence.
Lord Carling, who worked for the SIS during the war, was known to have had
left-wing views before it. But did they stop there or could he be the ``fifth
man''? Allebury's best for years.
Rapidly galloping after the other two, Philip Hook, a director of first
Christie's and then Sotheby's, is the author of The Island of the Dead. He
contrives to make the world in which he lives clear as a background for
suspense stories. In one of the London public galleries a valued painting is
vandalised. Why?

THE most common form of planning for the future is savings, and this is where
Scrooge was an amateur. The biggest factor affecting the value of your savings
is the quality of the investment you choose and definitely not investing a few
pence more by what what you save in not burning a few candles.
Douglas McCrea, of Glasgow-based Fraser Insurance Services, has dramatic
examples of the difference the right and wrong choice can make. ``The right
choice can be vital in choosing an account for investment funds,'' he said.
``The difference in performance between investment funds can be vast,
highlighted by the fact that #1000 invested in the best performing insurance
mangaged fund in the 10 years from November 1, 1985, to November 1, 1995, would
have returned #3260.
``This compares with a return of #1620 in the worst performing fund - a
difference of 164%.
``Even in the shorter five-year period the variance is vast, with the top
performing fund returning #2579, compared to #1281 from the worst - a
difference of 130%.''
Investments which can vary so much over the medium and short terms will vary
even more markedly over the long term, and here the right choice is even more
crucial. ``It would be fair to say that people gear the majority of their
financial affairs towards the day they retire,'' said Mr McCrea.
``Many people have set up their mortgage so that it is paid off prior to
retirement. People are well aware that the state provides only limited
assistance in retirement, and many individuals are keen to build up their own
retirement kitty through one of the many different investment vehicles
available to them.''
These different investment vehicles range from straightforward instant-access
building society accounts to personal equity plans, investment bonds and
investment trusts.
With more than 500 different bank and building society accounts available to
the UK investor and 272 listed insurance managed funds, the options available
can be confusing. Only an independent financial adviser is independent of the
companies offering these accounts and funds and can therefore recommend the
correct choice of all the products on the market.
Timing is also critical because investments in equities, or company shares,
depend upon the value the Stock Market places upon those shares. Late last
month the FTSE 100 - or Financial Times Stock Exchange index of the 100 leading
companies' shares - reached its highest point.
``If a client had invested in an insurance company's UK equity fund, which
allows him to invest in a wide range of UK-listed shares under the expertise of
a company's fund managers, the difference in performance as with the managed
funds can be vast,'' said Mr McCrea.
``One thousand pounds invested over the same period from November 1985 to
November 1995 would have returned #3733 in the best performing fund, compared
with #1055 in the worst - a colossal 268% difference.
``In the five-year period, the poorest performing fund would have lost the
client money, returning only #943 compared to the best performing fund which
would have returned a mammoth #2229, a difference of 129%.''
Although they should be viewed as long-term investments, customers do not
necessarily have to stay in a particular fund for years on end. ``The majority
of insurance companies now offer the facility to switch between their range of
funds, allowing one free switch a year,'' said Mr McCrea.
``Gains can be safeguarded by switching from high-risk funds at their peak to
lower-risk funds in order to avoid any downside in the markets.
``The offices of the majority of independent financial advisers are now fully
computerised and have investment performance statistics, comparisons,
up-to-date rates, etc, at their fingertips.''
Many people have existing investments that they have had for years but could
not say with confidence exactly which fund their money is invested in. This
could be costing them thousands of pounds even over the short and medium terms.
The right advice about profit-taking and fund-switching could correct this.
Tax and the thought of the Inland Revenue strikes fear into most people but an
adviser can deal directly with the Revenue and can provide information on
changing tax legislation.
``With the Financial Services Act and the Personal Investment Authority,
financial advisers now have to pass examinations covering areas such as
taxation, the use of trusts and many other vitally important areas,'' said Mr
McCrea.
``Retirement is a time that people should look forward to. An independent
adviser can assist in the enjoyment of your retirement by helping you to
organise your finances in a way best suited to your requirements.''
INCREASING uncertainty about state-provided pensions has led to some alarming
predictions. ``For those in non-pensionable employment it is essential to start
preparing for their income in retirement, or retirement will become a dismal
prospect,'' said Graham Hill of Roxburgh &amp; Co.
``It would be prudent to seek advice from an IFA to keep on the right track
through pension planning.''
Tax breaks offered by some personal pensions mean some investors can roll out
the barrel in retirement. At the highest rate tax relief is available for
contributions and that money can be invested in a tax-free environment.
Careful planners can receive a full quarter of that investment as a tax-free
lump sum on retirement. The remainder can then be used to purchase whichever
annuity the investor chooses.
Kennth Clarke's Budget has had both good and bad effects on pension planning.
``The reduction of basic rate tax, the expansion of the 20% band and increased
personal allowances and thresholds will have an impact on certain individuals'
pension contributions,'' said Mr Hill. ``Relevant net earnings will either be
not subject to tax or will be liable only to tax at 20%. Contributions can be
made net of the new basic rate of 24%. In other words, investors may get more
tax relief than they pay in tax.
``On the other hand, the increase in the higher rate threshold will limit the
amount of relief available. Setting contributions from 1996-97 against those
from 1995-96 may therefore be much more beneficial in the future.''
When planning a pension it is important to remember that it is a two-stage
process - choosing a pension and deciding how best to use it on retirement. The
retirement fund should be built up with whichever pension provider is most
suitable.
Charges vary widely not only between pension providers but also within specific
pension products offered by a single company. These can change depending on the
amount to be invested and the length of time until retirement. Being aware that
no single company comes out top across the board is an important element of
making a choice.
When choosing a plan, the object is to build up as large a retirement fund as
possible from the money being invested. Once retired, it is important to find
the most beneficial way of using that fund. IFA's are committed to finding the
best possible financial result for each individual client, and provide
objective advice.
``New-style personal pensions give the client the facility to improve
retirement income,'' said Mr Hill. ``This is called the `open market' option.
It allows the client to take the retirement fund into the pension market to try
to improve on the terms offered by the holding company. By doing so it is
possible to increase the annuity being offered.''
There is a bewildering array of plans to choose from - single life pensions,
joint life pensions, escalating pensions and so on. An IFA will evaluate the
client's current circumstances and ensure he or she finds the best available
option.
Most people opt for the maximum tax-free lump sum, as annuities are seen as
earned income and are therefore taxable. It is still worthwhile, however, to
take the lump sum and immediately buy a life annuity with tax-free capital
content.
The ``open market'' option does not suit everybody. It can be used to construct
a phased retirement plan which allows control of the pension fund, but an IFA
should be consulted before that choice is made.
The importance of getting it right is highlighted by the problem facing
pensioners in need of full-time care. ``Long-term care is becoming more of an
issue in today's environment,'' said Mr Hill. ``Tax-free cash from your
retirement fund helps relieve this burden.''
NEITHER Scrooge nor his tight-fisted chum Jacob Marley ever benefited much from
their scrimping and saving. For all their years of hoarding every penny,
Scrooge spent his nights alone in a hovel and Marley died miserable, leaving
no-one to care.
The idea that wealth related to happiness was fairly scotched in Dickens's
tale, but in reality the accumulation of a nest egg can guard against some of
the trials of later life.
``Many of us have accumulated some form of wealth as we approach retirement,''
said Les Shields, of Shields Financial Services. ``It might be in the form of a
house owned outright, a nest egg tucked away in the building society and
perhaps some investments in the Stock Market.
``We aim towards the day we can stop working and enjoy retirement.''
Often plans for retirement have no contingency for the unforeseen. A loved one
facing disability or full-time care after an accident or illness, for example,
could lead to financial hardship.
The 1993 Community Care Act transferred responsibility for funding for care to
local authorities rather than central Government. The result was that anyone
with savings of #8000 or more became liable to pay for their own nursing care.
The recent Budget had some element of ``God bless us, everyone'' when Kenneth
Clarke doubled that threshold to #16,000 - but failure to plan for every
consideration could still result in life savings being wiped out by the cost of
care.
``People are living longer today due to better standards of living, improved
health care and medical advances,'' said Mr Shields. ``Increased life
expectancy means the number of people reaching retirement is growing.
``In turn, the elderly population as a whole is getting bigger and will
continue to do so well into the next century. In less than 20 years there will
be 50% more people in Britain aged 85 or over.
``Simultaneously, the working population is declining. By the end of this
decade there will be a drop of more than 15% in the number of 15 to
29-year-olds, which means we are approaching the situation where the state has
to support a growing elderly population resourced by a diminishing number of
tax payers.''
Not exactly tidings of comfort and joy. Mr Shields thinks that in a little more
than 50 years this country may see as much as 75% of its population being
supported by the other 25%. The financial demands on the state will be
significantly increased, and all political parties are agreed that the welfare
state cannot meet the increasing costs of care for the elderly.
The result is that people must increasingly make their own provision for
ill-health in old age, just as they must make provision for retirement and even
for beneficiaries after death.
There have been cases of families having their life savings wiped out by the
costs of nursing care, and the press has featured horror tales of those who
have even lost their homes trying to pay. Typically, a nursing home costs
around #17,500 a year - an amount which will go through any savings all too
quickly.
``Careful planning with the help of an IFA can solve most of these problems in
relatively simple ways,'' said Mr Shields. ``Many are reasonably inexpensive
compared to the loss of capital which might be incurred without them.
``Similarly, many people are reluctant to consider Estate Planning because they
fear they may need the money themselves to pay for care. People therefore pay
unneccessary inheritance tax bills when a little planning would have resolved
the matter.
``This is not only a problem for the elderly - families become involved and
lose out as well.''
IFAs will help find the right financial packages to prevent these painful and
upsetting eventualities. They can advise on gifting a house for example -
leaving it to family but retaining the right to live there.
They can also help find insurance policies covering the cost of long-term care
on a tax-free basis. The earlier planning starts, the less expensive the policy.
``If your are concerned that future loss of health could cause this
unhappiness, contact an IFA and get the facts on protecting your estate,'' said
Mr Shields. ``It's your life - take control of it.''

Catherine Brown is
impressed by the array
of home produce at a
major show, with one
notable exception
AS thousands ate their way around the BBC Good Food Show in Birmingham this
year, their senses challenged at every stand by food sights, smells and tastes,
the food industry revelled.
Walking the aisles was a hungry audience - so what did the producers put on
show? Hi-tech, gosh-factor products? An overkill of foreign exotica? Not any
more.
Since the food scares of the eighties and the subsequent demand for less
mucked-up, more honestly produced food, the message - at this exhibition at any
rate - is that good food is not dependent on a trick. The razzmatazz of the
show came instead from a theatre of extrovert chefs demonstrating to huge
audiences, as well as smaller cooking demonstrations going on throughout the
show, and volunteer children competition-cooking for fun.
Meanwhile, skilled artisans were quietly getting on with their hand-crafted
products. A pork pie maker, Morris,was moulding hot water pastry up the side of
the wooden pie mould; an Indian had installed his tandoori oven and was
manipulating naan bread dough before baking it on the hot walls of the oven.
The queue growing longer by the minute, the bread was brushed with oil and
spiced seasonings. The British public were flexing their gastronomic muscles in
unprecedented fashion.
I had not, however, been invited to the show to linger over a tandoori oven, or
watch a hand-crafted Melton Mowbray pork pie take shape, but to report on the
Scottish contingent of producers who had joined the buzzing throng. Scotland
had taken the largest national area in the show, the Highlands and Islands the
largest individual stand area.
``In the late 1980s and early 1990s,'' said Kevin Gruer, Marketing Development
Manager of Highlands and Islands Enterprise, ``the small, innovative Scottish
producer was having a hard time as the multiples demanded uniformity and bulk.
Now this is completely reversed, and the multiples have recognised the need to
bring character to their shelves with more local products made by smaller
producers.''
From the clear, unpolluted waters of the North, there are gleaming silver
salmon. Gareth Crichton of Orkney Seafoods has developed a number of hot smoked
salmon cures, while on Shetland, Magnus Flaws of Shetland Salmon Farmers is
selling salmon nuggets coated in batter made by Framgrod which have recently
become a speciality at Ashdales, the award-winning fish and chip restaurant in
Aberdeen.
Still on Shetland, the Shetland Smokehouse has become the first producer of a
chilled soup in a clear microwaveable can with a seafood range which includes
Cullen Skink.
From Orkney, the veteran exhibitor and creator of delectable herring cures, Ken
Sutherland, of Orkney Herring continues to develop his range. There is a choice
of thick, thin, hard or crunchy Tods of Orkney oatcakes on to which busy
workers are spreading the pate, developed by Castle MacLellan in Kirkcudbright,
made with crabs caught by members of the Orkney Fishermen's Society. And to
sharpen the palate there is a range of seafood dressings and dips from Orkney
Gold using seaweed such as local kelp.
On the meat front the Scotch Quality Beef and Lamb Association's display of
fine butchery (the best in the show) is getting across the quality meat message
very efficiently. But where is the haggis? What, no haggis!
English good-food-tasters are dismayed. The haggis-exhibitor (MacSweens of
Edinburgh) has been prevented from appearing since he is moving premises. If
there is a flaw in the Scottish stand, this is it.
But there is no lack of flavourful jams, original jellies, piquant chutneys,
sharp pickles, herby vinaigrettes and tangy mustards for use as gifts, or on
festive tables. Murray McGregor of Denrosa Apiaries in Coupar has a huge range,
set out on a table for tasting, including Port, Bramble, Elderberry and Apple
and Rosemary jellies, plus a new award-winning range of colourful aromatic oils.
Sheila Robson, of Marmion's Brasserie in Melrose, has developed two vinaigrette
dressings in handled bottles. Also from the Borders, Neville Talbot, of
Pettigrews, the old-established Kelso preserve makers, has widened the range to
include more chutneys as well as festive cakes and a Christmas pudding with rum
or brandy butter. Next door is Simmers, the only remaining bakers in Scotland
who continue to make a buttery Scotch Abernethy biscuit.
On the drinks front, the whisky industry is out in force providing warming
mouthfuls of whisky and whisky-based liqueurs. But for me, the drink highlight
of the show is Fraoch Heather Ale, made by Scott Williams of Glasgow. No, not a
gimmick, but made according to an ancient recipe using native heather blossom
to produce another distinctly authentic national drink.

IF you arrive in Plymouth, Massachusetts, by coach as I did, you may be excused
for thinking you were in the Stateside equivalent of Gullane
or Joppa with drifts of sand heaped up against every kerb. It's only when you
discover the bus station is actually some distance inland and the shore is
fairly rocky anyway, that you realise this fine grit is part of the soil
indigenous to the area. In fact, this is the medium which has given rise to the
cultivation of one of America's favourite fruits - the cranberry.
Haute cuisine and the supercooks can dictate the fortunes of any food, and the
cranberry has enjoyed a renaissance, partly thanks to the fact that it features
heavily among Delia Smith's new crop of Christmas recipes.
But long before Delia first jellied or sauced them, the first settlers stepped
ashore on Plymouth Rock, and found this tart fruit which played an important
part in the culture of the local Indian tribe, the Wampanog, who used it for
cooking and as a dye for producing the vivid red of their rugs, blankets, and
clothing. It was even used as a poultice for the treatment of wounds caused by
poisoned arrows.
Several names for the cranberry are derived from the Indian language; Eastern
Indians called it ``Sassamanesh'', while tribes in other parts of the continent
referred to it as ``Ataqua'' or ``Pakimintzen''. It is commonly held that our
word cranberry comes from the crane bird frequently seen in the marshlands
feasting on the berries, and also for the delicate pale pink blossom which
resembles the bird's head.
Indian squaws passed on their knowledge and uses for the berries to the Pilgrim
women, who soon adapted it for use in sauces, tarts, and cranberry nog and
wine, but it was not until over 200 years later that Henry Hall of Dennis, Cape
Cod, saw the commercial possibilities of the berries.
Some Americans are often surprised to learn our traditional Christmas fare is
turkey with all the trimmings - including cranberry sauce or jelly - which is
of course their pice de resistance on Thanksgiving Day, with glazed ham forming
the centrepiece of their festive menu.
The cranberry, a member of the Ericaceae family, is a native shrub growing in
bogs and wet heathlands in northern England, Wales and Ireland; there are
trials taking place in Ireland at present to assess the commercial viability of
raising the fruit as a crop.
It is now possible to raise plants successfully in the garden. Although it
prefers areas with rougher weather, do plant it in an area which receives full
sunlight. Minimal fertilizing is required - in fact decay may occur with too
much fertilizer - and usually a simple mulch of compost, peat, or wood chips
will suffice.
Its low creeping habit makes it an ideal groundcover plant for rockeries and
ornamental gardens, with planting carried out in autumn or late winter/early
spring. Plant 8-10 inches apart, working in a little acid peat round the roots.
There is little maintenance other than occasional trimming of the shoots
protruding from the soil, and propagation is carried out by the formation of
runners which can be separated and planted out during the spring.
Cranberry shrubs for planting can be supplied by J Tweedie Fruit Trees,
Maryfield Road, Nursery, Terregles, Dumfries DG2 9TH. Tel: 01387 720 880.
