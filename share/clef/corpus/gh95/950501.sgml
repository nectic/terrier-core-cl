IN THE week just past, the sports pages have been replete with news of
the latest too-good-to-miss innovations about to hit the oval globe.
The World Cup is almost here but now there is talk of Euro Leagues,
Euro Cups, a new super-duper version of the Southern Hemisphere Super
Tens, Northern Hemisphere versus Southern Hemisphere challenges and,
from Australia, a call for players to be put on fat, six-figure pay
cheques.
The great rugby rollercoaster just seems to rattle on and on. Nobody
really seems to know where it is going but, hey hang on, it's a
thrill-a-minute ride.
As someone who earns his living from the game -- with it, but not of
it, as a fellow scribe once famously remarked when quizzed at French
customs as to whether he was a member of the Scottish rugby party in
Paris -- the more the merrier, I say.
But the rollercoaster ride should have caution and warning signs
posted at regular and conspicuous intervals along the route. If all of
the current initiatives come to fruition, then there is only one logical
outcome -- and that is a professional game.
In Scotland next season, the top players will be under more pressure
than ever before. From the first day of the season, elite players will
be involved in crunch league games, on the results of which the economic
survival of their clubs will depend. Then there will be the District
Championship, the Cup, and the Five Nations.
Boroughmuir will play in a pre-season Cup-winners' Cup tournament in
Holland. Players will be away for a week and more. If the
Carnegie-Quintas plan for a Euro League gets off the ground, then
Stirling County, already with a jam-packed fixture list, will have to
find time and space to fulfil their commitments on the Continent.
How will players explain to families -- and, perhaps even more
pertinently, employers -- that they need more time away to play rugby?
With difficulty, one imagines.
I'm all for it. My employers are going to be more upset if I don't
head off on the latest rugby trip. But, you see, that's what they pay me
for. That's not the case with the rising star in corporate finance or
the bricklayer or the blacksmith, who just happen to be good rugby
players into the bargain.
Ultimately, unless someone, somewhere, calls a halt, then the game is
going to go professional. That may be what most of those at the sharp
end want, but if that's happens, and it is not policed properly, then
there is a very real danger that the baby will go swirling down the
plug-hole with the bathwater.
There is about rugby union something special. There is an ethos about
the game which is in many ways undefinable. It is this special ethos
which attracts the big sponsors and the marketing men. Destroy that at
your peril.
If it goes, then rugby union is just another spoiled brat of a
big-money sport. Tennis, athletics, grand-prix motor racing, football --
they have all gone down this path and all have become besmirched by
scandal.
That is why, as rugby union continues its seemingly irrevocable march
down the same rocky path, all of the innovations and latest Big Ideas
should be subjected to the closest of scrutiny.
Finally, I am constantly reminded that all of the foregoing is totally
irrelevant in large chunks of the oval globe. A recurring vignette from
the FIRA Junior World Cup in Bucharest keeps coming to mind.
At the final presentation ceremony, the 24 competing nations were
gathered in all of their finery. The Scots boys and the South Africans
and the French and all the rest were resplendent in team blazers and
slacks. But no, not all the rest. The Russians, the Ukrainians, and some
of the other poorer nations had come in what looked like the only
clothes they possessed, the paupers at a rich man's feast.
They are part of the game, too. They are fellow dwellers on the oval
globe but a professional game will mean nothing to them.

Scotland 10, Italy 12
SCOTLAND came frustratingly close to toppling one of the top countries
in women's rugby in yesterday's international against Italy at
Meggetland.
The Scots went into a 10-9 lead on what appeared to be the stroke of
full-time with a penalty from Elaine Black, only to be penalised for
offside, allowing Italy's outstanding scrum half Michela Tondinelli to
kick the winning goal in injury time.
In fact Tondinelli scored all her country's points, with two earlier
penalty goals and a drop goal to add to her final, match-winning effort.
The light-weight scrum half dominated the game with astute kicking from
hand, merciless harrying of opposite number Sandra Colamartino, and a
swift service that was the key to the Italians' success.
Scotland at least had the satisfaction of scoring the game's only try,
a first-half touchdown by Colamartino from a scrum five metres out.
Teams:
Scotland -- M Cave (Saracens); S Brodie (Edinburgh Academicals), P
Paterson  (Richmond), K Littlejohn (Edinburgh Academicals), D Francis
(Richmond); E Black (Tedington), S Colamartino; J Taylor, A Mackenzie
(all Edinburgh  Academicals), A Christie  (Richmond), L Cockburn, M
McHardy, L O'Keefe (all Edinburgh Academicals), D Kennedy, J Sheerin
(both Heriot-Watt University).
Italy -- L Nave: E Bisetto, B Collodo, C Peguiron, S  Melis; M Tonella
replaced by E Morri 18 mins, M Tondinelli; M Breda, M Cimini, A
Corbanese, A Iannucci, L Fabbri, A Rosetti, M Tonna, C Pescatori.
Referee -- J Bacigalupo (Edinburgh Wanderers).

Welsh Under-18 29,
Scotland Under-18 16
SCOTLAND went down to Wales at a sun-drenched Stradey Park, Llanelli,
but not before they had given the Welsh side a far closer run than the
score suggests.
were scant reward for some fine play, but the Welsh strength and their
ability to convert chances into tries proved crucial.
Three first-half tries put the Welsh in the driving seat, although
after the break their two tries were matched by the visitors.
Centre Robert Steel made the initial opening for the first Scottish
try, and Steel again was involved along with hooker Kenny Day to send
Bull in at the corner. MacDonald's try was the last of the game, the
forward going over in the right corner after intense Scottish pressure.
Welsh Under-19 36,
Scotland Under-19 8
The home side raced to a 17-0 lead through tries by Leigh Davies, prop
Ian Evans, and wing Rob Saddler, two conversions coming from fly-half
Darren Morris.
Fly-half Mike Duncan did get a penalty for Scotland but Welsh full
back Adrian Durston then scored a quite brilliant try to give the
Welshmen a 29-3 interval lead.
Lock Stephen Gardner caught a Scottish throw three metres out for
another try, then captain and scrum half Dan Hawkins ran in from 20
metres out.
To their great credit the Scots refused to give in and No.8 Stephen
Wands had the last word with a richly deserved try which restored pride
in Scottish hearts.

THERE is no point picking over the bones of Scottish football's latest
excursion into Europe, a lacklustre, inept performance against San
Marino, but there was one glaring aspect of two sporting events related
to the quaint little Italian republic which should not be allowed to
pass without comment. It ought to come as no surprise that football is
again shown in a dismal light.
The same day Scotland tackled the part-time players of San Marino, the
travelling circus which is Formula 1 was setting up camp in Imola for
the first of the European competitions, and it would have been useful
had some of the people who claim to be working for the good of football
taken a look.
The activities of the grand-prix world might have shamed Scottish
football's authorities, but then again they might have scuttled off,
ashen-faced at the thought of behaving in such a gregarious fashion.
''What, go out of our way to make the press and the media welcome? You
must be joking,'' might have been the response from some of Scottish
football's officials.
Frankly, football -- which has fallen a decade or so behind in terms
of development -- also has been left somewhere down the road when it
comes to the realm of public relations. Attitudes towards communication
are still locked in the dark ages, and I would suggest sponsors are not
getting value.
Of course, they may see their names on shirts or displayed on
trackside advertising and on programmes, and they might even get to go
on a foreign assignment with whichever club they are supporting.
Wonderful.
But one of these days football sponsors will wake up to the truth,
which is that they are not the real recipients, that in these times of
inflated transfer fees, bloated salaries, and general running costs
which can be crippling, the game needs sponsors more than the sponsors
need football.
Nowhere is the relationship between financial backers and sport
brought more sharply into perspective than at a grand prix, where
competition is not just between racing teams. Sponsors seek to entice
members of the media into their compounds.
The other day Nigel Mansell bumped into a group of journalists and sat
down on a flight of stairs for a blether and posed for pictures. He was
regarded as one of the difficult ones on the circuit, but a team sponsor
says a driver must make himself available.
The point is that drivers -- sportsmen, a few of whom could buy just
about any Scottish football club with one year's salary -- are required
to communicate, to take time out to deal with the media, who in turn
relay the information to the public. It can cost up to #30m a year to
run a competitive Formula 1 team, and the sponsors, who supply this
finance, demand more than their names splashed across the sides of the
trucks which transport the machinery and back-up around the world.
These money-men demand good public relations and it was interesting to
hear David Coulthard say the other day that his future with the Rothmans
Williams Renault team would depend on his performances on and off the
racing track. He and the other drivers must spend time with sponsors and
guests before getting into their cars.
There is never any suggestion of brown envelopes in return for a few
minutes of a driver's time, unlike in football, where the ridiculous
practice of newspapers paying into players' pools before cup finals
still exists. In effect, this greed -- and that is precisely what it is
-- means players are selling their words to their public, who have
already paid these same footballers handsomely.
It is about time football's main sponsors started demanding more for
their money in terms of better public relations and a general
improvement in the behaviour and attitude of club directors, managers,
and players. In fact, part of the contract should forbid managers to
refuse permission to speak to players.
Clearly, football is a sport which has no idea yet how to sell itself
and it was a pity the gentlemen who make decisions which have an effect
on all of us who share a passion for football, could not have dragged
themselves up to Imola while they were in Italy for Scotland's European
Championship qualifying tie against San Marino.

West Ham United 2, Blackburn Rovers 0
BLACKBURN Rovers' first championship since before the Great War was
delayed by at least another week following a ferocious encounter in East
London yesterday.
It was football straight out of the trenches and West Ham, needing
points to secure their own future, stood firmest.
The upshot is that Blackburn stay eight points ahead of Manchester
United, who have two games in hand, the first of them at Coventry
tonight.
Were United to win their four remaining matches, Kenny Dalglish's team
would be left in the uncomfortable position of having to take maximum
points from both of theirs as well -- which are at home to Newcastle
next Monday and then away to Liverpool.
Alex Ferguson has already said that to miss out on the title,
Blackburn would have to fall like Devon Loch in the Grand National.
They are stumbling a little, having dropped eight points out of their
last 12, but must, nevertheless, still be counted favourites.
''The truth is it's still in our hands,'' said Dalglish. ''We might
not need to win another game. It was like a cup-tie today and it'll be
the same for Manchester United at Coventry.''
The sound and the fury generated by a near full house was transmitted
to the pitch and reflected on it, with bookings for five players.
Among them, predictably, were Julian Dicks, Martin Allen and David
Batty, who could well have been dismissed for a dreadful challenge on
Bishop.
The pace and commitment was so unrelentingly ferocious that Richard
Witschge, a Dutch internationalist on loan from Bordeaux and making his
Blackburn debut, must have wondered what he had walked into.
Not surprisingly, he was unable to make much impact from his position
wide on the left, and the service to Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton
suffered as a result.
Marc Rieper, West Ham's Danish centre-half, has had longer to grow
accustomed to frantic football, and as well as subduing Sutton, he won a
crucial header at the other end of the pitch to determine the course of
the game five minutes into the second half.
Rieper rose at the far post to knock in John Moncur's corner and the
home team were on their way.
With Colin Hendry outstanding again, that was almost the first real
chance created by either side. One fierce drive by Tim Sherwood,
deflected wide, was the best that Blackburn had managed until referee
Kelvin Morton ruled out an equaliser from Shearer, ruling that Sutton
had impeded the goalkeeper.
Hendry, tiring at last, was off balance as he directed a header wide
and then failed to stop substitute Matthew Rush using his pace to break
down the right.
Moncur's shot from the subsequent cross was blocked, but Don
Hutchison, standing in for the injured Tony Cottee, drove home the
rebound.
Shearer must have been reminded of his own dictum that ''there are no
easy games in this league -- except for Ipswich at home.''
That game has long gone and there are two very different ones left for
Blackburn.
They would be grateful for one or two favours from United's remaining
opponents in the meantime. Remaining fixtures:
BLACKBURN ROVERS
Newcastle United (home), Liverpool (away).
MANCHESTER UNITED
Coventry City (away), Sheffield Wednesday (home), Southampton (home),
West Ham United (away).

KINGUSSIE powered to their fourth Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup final in
five years with a controlled display against Fort William.
Last year's beaten finalists found the cup favourites in top form,
with Ronald Ross the most significant difference between the teams. Ross
helped himself to a hat trick, taking his total for the season to 60, in
the 3-1 victory.
Kingussie's single-minded approach to their Camanachd Cup campaign now
sees them safely through to the final in Oban on June 3. Between now and
then they have two further opportunities to add to their haul of
silverware, the MacTavish Cup final at Inverness, where they meet Fort
William again on May 20, and the Marine Harvest National league final in
Inverness a week on Saturday, against Oban Camanachd.
Oban also could be their opponents in the Camanachd Cup final, as they
play Newtonmore on Saturday in the second semi.

LAST week Western Klick Photopoint retained the Scottish Cup and on
Saturday they overcame Hyndland 4-0 to put themselves in a position
which their main rivals, Bonagrass Grove, are unlikely to reach,
although they can draw level on points.
In the second division of the men's league, Pender Uddingston have won
promotion along with Clydesdale, following their 2-0 defeat of Devol
Greenock with the help of goals from Scott Baird and Alan McGill.
Results:
Men: Torrie Stockbrokers National League. Division 2 -- Stepps 2,
Stirling 2; Grangemouth 0, Clydesdale 6; Pender Uddingston 2, Devol
Greenock 1; Hazlehead 2, Perthshire 0. Division 3 -- Grove 0, Comware 0;

* IT WAS Scotland men's under-21 side and not the highly fancied women
who had grounds for satisfaction at the end of their weekend's programme
in the European Junior Championship at Genoa, Italy. For, while the men
were beating Switzerland and Gibraltar by identical 3-0 scorelines, the
ladies were being humilated 11-1 by the Ukraine.
The men are now one of three teams in search of the two places at
stake in next season's European finals and both the others, England and
Italy, are on their schedule in the next two series of games, with
England likely to prove a real obstacle.
Scotland's win over Switzerland included scores by Calum Wood, Chris
Anderson, and Graham Joyce, while Wood set Scotland on the road to
victory against Gibraltar by scoring their only goal of the first half.
James McBlane added the second in the fifty-eighth minute, and seven
minutes from time Anderson was responsible for their.
The women, on the other hand, were totally out of their depth against
theUkraine and it will take some time for the 11-1 scoreline to be fully
accepted by Scottish hockey officials. Results:
0
Men: Saturday -- England 9, Gibraltar 1; Italy 1, Portugal 0; Scotland
3, Switzerland 0. Yesterday -- England 4, Portugal 0; Italy 4,
Switzerland 1; Scotland 3, Gibraltar 0.

Scottish Claymores 0, Amsterdam Admirals 31
THE Amsterdam Admirals clinched the first half of the World League
season and booked their place in the World Bowl by beating the Scottish
Claymores in front of 9306 fans at Murrayfield yesterday.
Seizing on the Scots' many mistakes, and capitalising on excellent
field position, the Admirals cruised to victory in the second half after
two touchdown scores in the first and second quarters from receivers
David and Ernie Jones put the Claymores to the sword.
Two field goals from Admirals' kicker Terry Belden, another touchdown
from David Jones, and a defensive safety, all in the third quarter,
moved the game out of reach of the Scots before Belden kicked a
fourth-quarter field goal from 20 yards to bring the total to 31,
leaving the Murrayfield crowd booing.
The Claymores were their own worst enemies, with a dismal offensive
display and a poor performance plagued by errors.
The Scots fumbled the ball five times, Amsterdam gaining possession
twice, with the Claymores' running game, effective last week against
Frankfurt, spluttering to just one first down and accounting for only 31
yards.
Defensively the Claymores went all out to stop the Admirals' dangerous
running game, which, to their credit, they did, limiting it to only 99
yards, but they failed to stop the Dutch side's passing attack directed
by quarterback Jamie Martin, who threw for three touchdowns and 194
yards.
''Offensively we didn't do a good job of protecting the football,''
said Claymores' head coach Jim Criner, ''and in the end we took a good
old-fashioned whipping. Our fans have good reason to be disappointed and
we deserved to be booed. They did their part and stuck with us -- we
just didn't give them a lot to cheer about -- but I promise if they
stick with us we'll give them something to shout about next week.''
The Claymores started the afternoon well with the defence sinking the
Admirals' first three attacks. But a fumble by Siran Stacy on his own
seven-yard line, just as the Claymores looked to have settled, set up
the Admirals for their first score, and Martin sailed over an easy pass
to David Jones after 12 minutes.
Another mistake, when kicker Arden Czyzewski fumbled on his punt
attempts after having recovered a high snap which gave the ball to the
Dutch at the Claymores' 14. One play later Martin completed another
simple pass, this time to Ernie Jones, to place the Admirals 13-0 up.
Things did not improve for the Scots in the third quarter when Stacy
again fumbled, setting up kicker Belden to boot through a 29-yard field
goal.
The Admirals moved further ahead when Martin completed to David Jones
for his second touchdown before Belden nailed a 48-yard field goal.
Quarterback Williamson was sacked in his own end zone for a two point
safety at the end of the third quarter before Belden scored another
field goal.
Amsterdam head coach Al Luginbill, whose side have a perfect 4-0
record, commiserated with the Scots. ''It was one of those days when
nothing went right for them and everything went for us,'' he said.
The Claymores will turn their attentions to the biggest clash of the
season at Murrayfield next week when they take on London Monarchs the
week before they attempt to kickstart the second half of their World
League season, the winner of which will meet Amsterdam in the World
Bowl.
In London, the Monarches were soundly beaten 39-24 by Barcelona
Dragons.

SEVERIANO Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal, generally acclaimed as
the greatest pair in the golfing world, won the Perrier Paris Pairs
Tournament at Saint-Cloud yesterday with a 24-under-par, four-round
aggregate of 256.
They shot an eight-under-par 62 in the last round fourball to beat
Australians Mike Clayton and Peter O'Malley by three shots. The Aussie
pair had a better-ball score of 60 yesterday for 259. Colin Montgomerie
and Ian Woosnam, with 64 yesterday, were one shot further back.
The Spanish maestros, who shared a first prize of #70,000, had eight
birdies and 10 pars yesterday and were never really threatened, although
Clayton and O'Malley had cut the gap to two shots at the twelfth.
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
256 -- S Ballesteros and J-M Olazabal (Spain) 63, 67, 64, 62 (#70,000
per pair).
259 -- M Clayton and P O'Malley (Australia) 66, 70, 63, 60 (#50,000

* SANDY Lyle finished the Volvo China Open in joint thirty-first place
yesterday after a final-round 70, two under par, over Beijing's
international course.
His four-round total of 292 left him 15 behind the winner, Raul Fretes
of Paraguay, who carded a final round of 68.
Fretes, 29, who defeated Colin Montgomerie at the 1993 Alfred Dunhill
Cup in St Andrews, was three clear of Lai Ying-juh of Chinese Taipei.
''This is the biggest win of my career,'' said the current South
American Tour Order of Merit champion.
Lyle was involved in helping China's top junior players, hosting a
coaching clinic with Volvo resident pro Johnny Anderson. Leading scores:
277 -- R Fretes (Paraguay) 74, 67, 68, 68.
280 -- L Ying-juh (Taipei) 70, 69, 71, 70.
282 -- Z Liangwei (China) 70, 72, 71, 69.

* PAYNE Stewart yesterday landed the $1.4m Houston Open when he beat
Scott Hoch at the first hole of a sudden-death play-off at Woodlands in
Texas.
Hoch held a five-stroke lead going into the final round but he then
slumped to a 75 to share the leadership with Stewart, and Hoch's misery

Sydney
RICHARD Corsie completed a hat trick of victories for UK players in
the Mazda International Jack High event in Sydney yesterday when he
coasted to a straight-sets final win over Australian Cameron Curtis.
The Scot himself started the run back in 1993 when he beat Adelaide's
Dave Stockham in the final. World indoor champion Andy Thomson, from
England, added the second leg 12 months ago, also beating Stockham.
Corsie had only scraped through to the knockout stages on Saturday
when he edged out South Africa's Neil Burkett 4-9, 9-7, 9-1. Corsie
saved a match lie against him in the second set before going on to wrap
up a semi-final spot. Once into the knock-out stages, however, Corsie
never looked like anything other than the winner.
In the semi-finals yesterday morning he beat former indoor world
champion Ian Schuback 9-8, 9-3 and then needed just a total of 10 ends
to complete his final demolition of Curtis 9-4, 9-0.
''The opening set against Ian was a real battle and I had to hit back
from 7-4 down, but it was an important set to win,'' said Corsie later.
Schuback agreed. ''Losing the opening set made things really
difficult. With Richard in such commanding form it was virtually
impossible to give him a set of a start and beat him.''
Curtis got to the final with a battling 9-7, 2-9, 9-4 win over fellow
Aussie Steve Glasson in the best match of the event, but could not
reproduce that form in the final.
Corsie got the perfect start with a count of 4 on the opening end and
five ends later a double wrapped up the first set 9-4.
Four more ends and it was all over, with Corsie coasting through the
second set on a 9-0 whitewash to wrap up the title and lift the first
prize of a sponsor's car worth $25,000.
''The opening-end 4 was perfect and helped settle me,'' said Corsie.
''I didn't allow Cameron to get into things after that and it all worked
out a lot easier than I thought.
''This is my second car in three Mazda events. I suppose if I win this
a couple of more times, I can set up my own taxi business in
Edinburgh,'' quipped the 28-year-old Commonwealth champion.
Results: Semi-finals -- R Corsie (Scotland) beat I Schuback
(Australia) 9-8, 9-3; C Curtis (Australia) beat S Glasson (Australia)
9-7, 2-9, 9-4.
Final -- Corsie beat Curtis 9-4, 9-0.

DONALD Blair, who makes his living in the frozen food business,
unexpectedly but deservedly consigned the opposition to cold storage
when, on Saturday, he won the Edward Trophy at Glasgow Gailes. A
Lanarkshire County player and the winner of last year's Glasgow Amateur
title, Blair stole a march on his rivals by one stroke.
For his 36-hole total of 141, one under par, Blair, a tall and
powerfully-built 30-year-old, had rounds of 70 and 71 to edge clear of
two current internationalists -- Alan Reid, who improved on last year's
third place performance by one, and Craig Watson, who shared third place
with a former boy internationalist, Alastair Forsyth.
In dull and bleak conditions Blair over the piece had six birdies and
limited his mistakes to five bogeys. He reserved his best examples of
each until last, laying his approach dead for a 3 at the thirty-fifth
and holing from six feet for a 5 at the last, the shot which secured
victory.
Reid, after a pedestrian 73, followed with 69, one of only four scores
below 70, as the work he had done on his putting stroke during three
weeks of practice in Florida in February made its contribution. ''Of
course, the greens at Gailes are very different,'' he said, ''but they
are just as true.''
Watson, the 28-year-old Scottish Mid-Amateur champion and the winner
at Craigmillar last month, shared the first-round lead on 69 with Hugh
MacDonald, the Old Ranfurly club champion for the last four years.
Neither could sustain that standard -- Watson having 15 pars and three
bogeys and MacDonald three-putting three successive holes from the
eighth.
Watson nowadays grips the putter normally from 20 feet or more, but
rings the changes between orthodox and cross-handed below that range.
Forsyth, aged 19, who was runner-up to Reid for the Scottish Boys' title
in 1992, employed the routine method to convert the six-foot birdie putt
at the thirty-fourth which brought him into the frame. Leading scores:
141 -- D Blair (Bothwell Castle) 70, 71.
142 -- A Reid (Barassie) 73, 69.
143 -- C Watson (East Renfrewshire) 69, 74; A Forsyth (Ralston) 73,
70.
144 -- H MacDonald (Old Ranfurly) 69, 75; G Bolton (Rothesay) 73, 71.
145 -- B Collier (Callendar ) 74, 71.
146 -- J F Mathers (Haggs Castle) 75, 71; J Paterson (Hayston) 77, 69.
147 -- G K Gardiner (Falkirk) 73, 74.
148 -- G Lawrie (Prestwick St Nicholas) 74, 74; M Carmichael
(Greenock) 75, 73.

SWEDE Maria Hjorth, who is in her second year of studies at Stirling
University, came from five strokes behind with nine holes to play to win
the Scottish Women's Open Strokeplay championship at Royal Troon
yesterday and became the first overseas player to carry off the Helen
Holm Trophy. Hjorth, aged 22 and from near Stockholm, came home in 33,
five under the women's par for the championship course, for a final
round of 70 and a 54-hole total of 219, four under, to beat Julie Hall,
the English champion and twice winner of this event, and a compatriot,
Sara Eklund, by one stroke.
Hjorth, taking advantage of the mild southerly breeze, reached three
of the inward par-5 holes in two, but the final flourish by the player
who had already won the Spanish Open championship and the Sherry Cup
this season was decisive.
Hjorth holed from 30 feet for a 2 at the short seventeenth and hit a
closing wedge to four feet for her last two gains.
Seven of the eight Swedes playing finished in the first 17.
Hall, the winner in 1991 and 1993, held an overnight lead of one
stroke from the Welsh internationalist Lisa Dermott and was six ahead of
Hjorth. She missed a difficult chance at the last to tie, but her
stumbling start -- she three-putted the third and fourth to drop three
strokes to the card -- compromised her hopes.
Eklund seemed the most likely winner with five to play, but she
bogeyed the fourteenth and seventeenth. She had a putt of some eight
feet at the last to force a play-off, but the ball was far from firmly
struck. Leading scores (first two over Troon Portland, third over Royal
Troon):
219 -- M Hjorth (Stirling University) 75, 74, 70.
220 -- J Hall (Felixstowe Ferry) 75, 68, 77; S Eklund (Sweden) 74, 72,
74.
221 -- L Dermott Royal Liverpool) 73, 71, 77.
224 -- H Kavanagh (Grange) 80, 71, 73.
226 -- A Berg (Stirling University) 77, 73, 76.
229 -- S McMaster (Dunbar) 77, 72, 80; K Tebbet (East Devon) 76, 72,
81; K Andersson (Sweden) 75, 76, 78.
230 -- H Ohlsson (Sweden) 77, 75, 78.
232 -- J Ford (Gullane Ladies) 82, 71, 79; M Lojdahl (Sweden) 79, 76,
77.
233 -- A Gemmill (Barassie) 78, 76, 79.
234 -- A Laing (Vale of Leven) 77, 74, 83; M McGreevy (Rossmore) 80,
72, 82; R Bailey (Whittington Heath) 79, 78, 77.
235 -- J Lindbergh (Sweden) 75, 80, 80.

SCOTLAND'S campaign to qualify for the European Championship finals
may be significantly advanced by the violence which marred last week's
Greek Cup final.
Stelios Manolas and his AEK Athens team-mate Mihalis Vlahos were both
ordered off for an attack on the referee when he awarded a controversial
penalty, which proved the winner for champions Panathinaikos.
The incident is now under investigation by the Greek FA, who have a
rule that any player who receives a lengthy suspension cannot be
selected for international duty.
They also have a precedent in such extreme cases. When a match
official was assaulted in a previous game, the two players involved were
banned for eight months.
Manolas, captain of the national team, fears the worst. He admitted
yesterday: ''If they suspend us, they can write off the chances of
Greece qualifying. Scotland and Russia will be laughing all the way to
the finals.''
The probe is expected to last two weeks, when a decision on the
punishment will be announced.
* JESUS Gil, controversial owner of Atletic Madrid, may be banned from
football again this week.
His racist remarks about his Colombian striker, Valencia, following
their goalless draw with Longrones a week ago, have infuriated political
leaders and the Spanish Players' Union.
''I will personally cut off his black head and paint it white,'' Gil
was quoted as saying. He now claims this was taken out of context but as
Valencia has been the victim of a hate campaign which will force him to
leave Spain at the end of the season, it was insensitive in the extreme.
A government commission, set up specifically to deal with violence in
football, will consider the complaints on Wednesday, with Gil likely to
face severe punishment.
* MUCH has been made of the coaching system which has brought Ajax to
the final of the European Cup in Vienna next month. Now Bayern Munich,
beaten emphatically by the Dutch in the semi-finals, have asked for
their assistance in laying down a similar scheme.
At the behest of Franz Beckenbauer, Bayern sought and were granted all
the information they required to set up their own coaching network. Jan
Wouters, who had spells with both clubs, will be in charge.
In return, Bayern will provide the Dutch with details of their
business administration and the way links with supporters associations
have been established.
* HOLLAND'S coach Guus Hiddink, with just one win over lowly Malta in
four games, is coming under increasing criticism. Their midweek defeat
by the Czech Republic means the Dutch must win all their remaining ties
to reach the European Championship finals.
Given the success of Ajax and the fact that seven of their players are
currently in his team, Hiddink has been accused, perhaps rightly, of
being unable to deploy the considerable resources at his disposal.
* PARIS St Germain have made an approach for Hristo Stoichkov of
Barcelona, who in turn have declared an interest in their French
internationalist David Ginola. Lazio and Internazionale are also in the
running.

All of the jaded sports writers in the world should get themselves
down to the mini rugby to see how these youngsters go about it
ON FRIDAY night it was the Paisley Rugby Club dinner, an event that
had dissolved into mock battle the previous year when soda syphons were
left foolishly on each table. Bill Nolan, of Irvine, spoke and
enthralled the crowd with such life-questioning thoughts as ''who was
Larry that he was so bloody happy . . .'' and 'live every day as if it's
your last . . . because one day you're sure to be right.''
At the Paisley dinner there was much talk of possible amalgamation,
but more of that later.
''You promised that if we beat Marr in the final, you would write a
line about us,'' said one particularly confident P7 Ayr mini-rugby
player at his club's tournament on Saturday. They did, so I will. In the
semi they had pointed at their opponents. ''We'll hammer you in the
final,'' said the same lad. God, it was good stuff to watch, and all of
the jaded sports writers in the world should get themselves down to the
mini rugby to see how these youngsters go about it.
Me and Big Jill from Haddington were surrounded by a warm glow at the
tournament -- Big Jill especially, as very soon after arrival at
Millbrae she, with Susan Fyfe and Linda Paterson, was stuck very firmly
into a picnic that consisted mostly of sherry. Allan Hosie, complete
with SRU sweater, cooked the hamburgers for a long line of kids with
pocket money, a hunger, and an intense desire to smother everything in
tomato sauce, and the whole day was paradise itself to an old fart like
me.
I find it very odd that I am suddenly at an age that means that my son
plays against, and with, the sons of the men I played with and against
myself. Remember big David Gray from West of Scotland, who played for
Scotland in the second row? Well he was there along with Sandy Service
and Hamish Fyfe. Steve Munro, the international winger, was there too,
as were Colin McCallum and Tony Adair from Ayr. All with sons taking
part.
But life isn't life without the odd story or two. Phil Manning played
on the wing for Glasgow when they won the District Championship, and
then went to play for Carlisle in the land of Rugby League alongside
George Graham of Stirling County. A wee whisper was going around
Millbrae that he has asked to be reinstated into the ranks of Rugby
Union, and he confirmed it in the bar. Manning is in the last year of
his contract with Carlisle, and will contact Hosie to help with his
cause. I wish him well in his case.
And yet the most significant aspect of the weekend for me was equally
apparent at both occasions. At the Paisley dinner, it was pretty obvious
that here, listening patiently in the room to my drivel, was a gathering
of human meat that could do well in top-class rugby. In every rugby
team, at every level, there are one or two players that could be
internationalists if they really wanted to, and Paisley was no
exception. There were blokes in that room as big as the Scottish players
I speak to.
At the mini rugby tournament there were young lads who had skills that
I, and half the players I played with, never had at that age, to be
certain. The East Kilbride boys were superb, quite fantastic.
But will Paisley ever be top-class, and how many of those young lads
on view will get past being very good mini rugby players and develop
into clever club players? Not many, is the answer, and one reason for
that is, I am sure, misplaced club loyalty that prevents the gathering
together of playing and coaching talent.
It seems to me that the way ahead for Ayrshire rugby is to develop an
Ayrshire team, an amalgamation of Ayr and Kilmarnock, and possibly
others, to give those youngsters the target of getting to the highest
level. Likewise, Paisley should try to be at the forefront of an
amalgamation drive to get all of the teams in Paisley to join forces to
give that town a team to be proud of.
On the West Coast, we have more rugby players and more rugby clubs
than the rest of Scotland put together. But the talent is spread too
thin. That's got to be changed, especially with the new league set-up,
and the sooner the better.
That's what I learned this weekend. That and the fact that good mini
rugby is something else to watch.

GLASGOW HIGH/KELVINSIDE reached a new pinnacle of achievement at
Milntown on Saturday when they won the Langholm Sevens to record their
first triumph at a senior Border tournament.
Having recently reached the Melrose quarter-final and the Hawick
semi-final, GHK finally realised their full potential with a thrilling
33-24 margin over a powerful and gifted Loughborough University in the
final to become the first Glasgow club since 1950 to lift a Borders
Sevens title.
It was a signal triumph for a side that put together some brilliant
segments of inter-play in scoring 19 tries despite having no easy
passage in dismissing Kelso and Gala.
GHK had three rumbustious and unceremonious forwards in Murray
Wallace, Dominic Mellor, and Scott Hutton, who replaced Mellor (knee
injury) in the semi-final. Harry Bassi, as hooker, enhanced that element
of pace and guile in the back division, whose running off the ball and
judgment in taking on long scoring runs was exemplary.
Each back made decisive contributions. GHK also spread the try-scoring
load, Gerry Hawkes and George Breckenridge having four each, Bassi,
Steve Hirini, and Wallace three each and Cameron Little two.
GHK, having beaten Kelso and Selkirk, were level at 14-14 with the hot
favourites Gala when tries by Breckenridge and Hawkes clinched a shock
26-14 margin.
Loughborough, meanwhile, had amassed 89 points in seeing off a sadly
under-strength Boroughmuir and Kilmarnock, who had beaten a weakened
Stirling County.
Jed-Forest led Loughborough by 21-7 but they permitted Loughborough
too much ball and went out 35-28.
Down 12-0 after three minutes of the final to tries by Simon Staton
and Peter Atkinson and a conversion by Chris Atkinson, GHK then placed
claustrophobic tackle pressure on the students and sailed into a 33-12
lead with tries from Hirini (two), Bassi, Wallace, and Breckenridge, who
converted four.
Loughborough hinted at the kind of grandstand finish that had
shattered Jed-Forest but GHK regrouped and, although there was a late
try and conversion by Peter Atkinson, they ran out worthy winners.
Results:
First round -- Jed-Forest 24, Edinburgh Academicals 7; Melrose 24,
Hawick 19; Kilmarnock 26, Stirling County 19; Loughborough University
42, Boroughmuir 14; GHK 21, Kelso 19; Selkirk 28, Peebles 14; Langholm
20, Biggar 19; Gala 38, Heriot's FP 12. Quarter final -- Jed-Forest 45,
Melrose 7; Loughborough 47, Kilmarnock 0; GHK 43, Selkirk 5; Gala 49,
Langholm 7. Semi finals -- Loughborough 35, Jed-Forest 28; GHK 26, Gala
14. Final -- GHK 33, Loughborough 24.
GHK -- G F Hawkes, S N Hirini, G M Breckenridge, C E Little; M I
Wallace, H S Bassi, S Hutton.
Loughborough University -- S Cook, N Osman, C Atkinson, B Breeze; S
Staton, P Atkinson and R White.
Referee -- J M Fleming (Boroughmuir).

EDINBURGH'S Alison Bowie enjoyed the perfect celebration of her 100th
cap when she led Scotland's women to the bronze medal at the European
Championships in Amsterdam yesterday.
The Scots, fifth last year, defeated second seeds Germany 2-1, to
finish in the top three for the first time since 1985.
Bowie, who was in that side 10 years ago, provided the perfect start
with a 9-0, 10-8, 9-5 win over Silke Bartel, and it was Scottish
champion Claire Waddell who clinched the medal in an impressive win over
Sabine Baum. In the top string, Senga Macfie went down in straight games
to Sabine Schoene.
In the men's event, Scotland, bronze medallists last year, ended a
disappointing campaign by beating the Netherlands 3-1 in the seventh
place play-off.
0   England retained both titles. The men beat Finland 4-0 and the
women whitewashed the Netherlands.

A TAME, grey weekend mixing a day-long passage race around the island
of Bute on Saturday with a pair of short windward, leeward races in the
channel off Largs marked the start of the Clyde Cruising Club's
competitive sailing season.
Included this year for the first time was a Sigma 33 Class, John and
Hilary Connelly's Sigma Phoenix excelling to take two firsts and a
second.
In Class 1 Geoff Semple's Double Thyme capitalised on good downwind
speed with this final-leg bonus to win. Howard Bryan's big varnished
Dione in Class 2 triumphed by more than seven minutes.
Yesterday Chris Bonar's Tripp 40 Bateleur won Class 1, repeating this
feat in the second race.
In Class 2 the best pair of results came from Angus Spence's First
Class 8 The Black Pig which took a second, then a win, while in the
Sigma Class it was the Wilson brothers, Neil and David, sailing Panache,
who managed to beat Phoenix.

JAMIE Delgado from Warwickshire, Britain's top 18-year-old junior, won
the men's singles final of the first LTA Spring Satellite Circuit at
Craiglockhart, Edinburgh, yesterday, taking the winner's cheque for
$1650, the same amount as the women's.
The unseeded Delgado beat his doubles partner, Lincolnshire's Andrew
Richardson -- also unseeded -- 7-5, 6-2, in 95 minutes.
After taking the first set Delgado, who put out Scotland's No.1 Ross
Matheson in the quarter-finals, raced to a 5-0 lead in the second set,
before 21-year-old Richardson put up some resistance. He took the next
two games and saved four match points before finally succumbing.
Not long after, as might have been expected, third seeds Delgado and
Richardson lost the doubles final to fourth-seeded Australian brothers
Brent and Todd Larkham, 6-2, 6-2.
In an unusual women's final between a qualifier, Denisa Chladkova of
the Czech Republic, and lucky-loser qualifier Karolina Jagienak of
France, the 15-year-old Czech comfortably won 6-2, 6-2, in 63 minutes.
But the Czech, ranked only No.764 in the world, then had to play a
qualifier for this week's second event at the same venue, winning easily
6-0, 6-1, against Frances Hearn from Middlesex, while the French girl
flew off to Spain for a competition this week.

* GFC Prestwick won the under-16 Women's Scottish Cup final, beating
Cumbernauld Cosmos 7-5 after extra time yesterday at Forthbank Stadium.
Goals from Julie Fleeting, daughter of ex-Killie boss Jim, and
Michelle Collins in extra time sealed the Ayrshire side's victory.
The sides were tied at five-a-piece at the close of normal time, with
Lyndsay Picken and Collins both netting doubles for Prestwick, and
Fleeting scoring the other. Aileen Lamb, Kirsty Marr, Michelle Cox, and
Denise Brolly (2) were the scorers for Cumbernauld Cosmos.

GLASGOW Tigers rider David Walsh's first British Championship final
ended in disappointment at Coventry yesterday, when he could score only
four points from five outings.
An opening second place to Bradford's Joe Screen appeared to set up
Walsh for a good meeting, but he then ran two thirds and two lasts to
finish well down the 16-rider field. The British title-winner for a
record third successive year was Coventry's Andy Smith.
In the race-off to determine the last place in the final before the
meeting began, Edinburgh's Kenny McKinna was beaten by Garry Stead of
Bradford.
Glasgow Tigers went down to a narrow 50-46 defeat at Swindon in
Saturday's British Premier League match.
Edinburgh, meanwhile, were on the end of a 61-35 defeat at Bradford.
Berwick Bandits, who led by 16 points from the first leg, clinched the
Fen-Tweed Challenge Trophy with a 68-28 second leg victory over
Mildenhall Fen Tigers.

Glasgow Cup Final
Celtic 1, Rangers 3
RANGERS secured victory for the fourth year in a row over old rivals
Celtic in the Glasgow Cup after having to come from behind, watched by a
bumper crowd of 5500.
Winger Steven Boyack had a hand in all three goals and must be
considered a star of the future, while first-team regular Craig Moore,
whose equaliser brought Rangers level, put his experience to good use in
central defence.
It was Celtic who struck first in 27 minutes with a stunning goal from
Michael Craig. After Moore had fouled Paul Dalglish, son of Kenny, Craig
stepped up and rocketed home the free kick from 25 yards.
Rangers, who had a strong penalty claim turned down when Lee Dair
tumbled in the box, struck back in first-half injury time. Boyack
curling a free kick on to the head of Moore, who despatched it home in
great style.
With 17 minutes left, Boyack secured victory when he set up two goals
in less than a minute.
First his driving run and pass released Paul McShane, who cut inside
his marker before firing home. Less than 60 seconds later he skipped to
the bye-line, where his driven cross was turned home by Dair.
Celtic centre half Jim Slaven was sent off in the last minute and
promising striker Marc Anthony had three bones in his foot broken to
round off a miserable afternoon for the Parkhead team.
Celtic -- McCondichie, McCrindle, Adams, Kelly, Slaven, Wilson,
Walker, Carberry, Craig, Anthony, Coughlin. Substitutes -- Morrison,
Corr, Dalglish.
Rangers -- Rae, Shields, Kerr, Wilson, Moore, Nicolson, McShane,
McGinty, McKnight, Dair, Boyack. Substitutes -- Ferguson, Caldwell,
Brown.
Referee -- T M McCurry (Glasgow).

JOCKEY Tim Reed is likely to miss the rest of the jumps season after a
fall at Hexham on Saturday in which his mount It's The Pits suffered
fatal injuries.
Reed was riding for his boss, Lenny Lungo, when the 9-4 joint
favourite crashed out at the open ditch just after the stands during the
Chesters Stud Novices' Chase.
The jockey was taken to Hexham General Hospital where he remains under
observation in the spinal unit.
Reed's trainer father George said: ''Tim has definitely sustained one
fractured vertebra and could also have damaged one higher up.
''He will be having some special x-rays and if there are two fractures
he could well be flat on his back for three weeks.
''If that's the case, it would mean the end of this season for him.
Even if there is only one fracture, I reckon he'll be on the sidelines
for three weeks.''
Reed has ridden 29 winners so far this term and was on course to beat
his best personal tally of 37 achieved last season.

SUCCESS was tinged with sadness for Len Lungo at Hexham when he took
another step towards winning The Herald Leading Scottish Trainer award,
but lost one of his most consistent performers in a crashing fall.
The Lorryman (9-2), a winner over course and distance a year ago, led
throughout to take the Gilesgate Volvo Handicap Chase by eight lengths
from Ken Oliver's Golden Fiddle, the much-fancied 5-4 favourite.
Two hours earlier, Its The Pits, 9-4 joint favourite for the Chesters
Stud Novices' Chase, had dislocated a shoulder in a heavy fall and had
to be destroyed.
It was the eight-year-old gelding's first attempt at jumping fences.
As a hurdler he won four times in the past two seasons, twice at Hexham,
at Haydock and at Perth.
Tim Reed was taken to hospital and Liam O'Hara came in for the winning
ride on The Lorryman.
It was Lungo's twenty-sixth winner, one less than last season.
Peter Monteith appeared to be making up ground on his rival when Rusty
Blade and Unor gave him a much-needed boost at Perth on Thursday.
He had hoped to maintain the momentum with Back Before Dawn in the
novices' chase, but the eight-year-old crumpled on landing when
appearing to be going well in third place.
Lungo is now eight clear of Monteith with Colin Parker, on 13, the
only other in contention for the #1000 award.
Dawn Goodfellow, continues to lead the permit-holders with eight
winners, but Hawick businessman Alistair Whillans refuses to believe the
contest is over. He is now within two of the leader after Palacegate
King's success in the Northumberland Boys' Clubs' Handicap Hurdle.
Despite carrying top weight, the 3-1 favourite came home half-a-length
ahead of Abbot of Furness. It was Palacegate King's third win this
season and he may now go for a valuable race at Haydock next Monday.
Liz Johnstone, of Duns, breeder of the smart chaser King's Fountain,
had her first success under rules when Royal Stream (9-2) won the
prestigious Heart of all England Maiden Hunter Chase. He had previously
won five point-to-points.

* THE Paul Kelleway-trained Pelder turned the Group 1 Prix Ganay into
a near procession at Longchamp yesterday when spearheading an English
one-two in France's first Group 1 race of the year.
In the final furlong-and-a-half, only Champion Hurdle winner
Alderbrook provided any firm opposition as Frankie Dettori cruised up to
challenge for the lead on 12.9-1 shot Pelder.
Dettori only had to use hands and heels riding to record a
three-length margin over the Paul Eddery-ridden Alderbrook with Richard
of York seemingly the only French rival to act on the very heavy ground,
finishing threequarters of a length back in third.
Pelder's success in the Ganay signified the first British training
success in the race since Rheingold had landed the 1973 running for
Barry Hills.
* PETER Chapple-Hyam's Prince Arthur lost his maiden tag in fine style
by capturing the #59,000 Group 1 Premio Parioli, the Italian 2000
Guineas, at the Capannelle, Rome, yesterday.
It was the Manton trainer's second Italian classic win following White
Muzzle's triumph in the 1993 Derby Italiano.
Mark Usher's Imperial Bailiwick finished fourth of five to the
impressive Imprevedibile in the Listed Premio Cerosa at over five
furlongs at San Siro in Milan.
Chapple-Hyam was out of luck in Germany where Queen's Ransom finished
last of six to Ermbold in the Listed Behr Memorial.

SCOTLAND'S women bowlers celebrated last night after Liz Dickson,
Eleanor Allan, Betty Forsyth, and Frances White won the fours title at
the Atlantic Rim Games in Durban.
Their victory dashed South Africa's hopes of a clean sweep and came
despite a final-round defeat by Joyce Mulholland's Irish quartet.
The host country had won the pairs and triples titles last week, and
Jo Peacock added the singles yesterday -- although she, too, had her
pride dented when Namibia's Jean Joubert beat her 25-24 in her final
game.
The Scots, however, had sealed the fours title on Saturday, when they
overcame South Africa. Their triumph was all the more creditable after
the loss of Sarah Gourlay, who injured her wrist in a fall.
Substitute Eleanor Allan, secretary and team manager, made history by
becoming the first uncapped player to win gold at international level.
Scotland took an early 10-2 lead over Ireland, but loosened their grip
and lost 19-18.

A STYLISH three-under-par round of 67 at the King James VI course in
Perth yesterday was enough to give the on-song Glen Campbell of
Blairgowrie a comfortable victory in the Perth &amp; Kinross Spring Meeting.
Campbell finished the day three strokes clear of his nearest
challengers, Matthew Evans, of Auchterarder, and Pitlochry's Steve
Carruthers, although Evans took second spot by virtue of having a better
inward half. Leading scores:
Scratch: 67 -- G Campbell (Blairgowrie).
70 -- M Evans (Auchterarder) bih, S Carruthers (Pitlochry).
Scratch to 9: 66 -- M Rogalski (King James VI) (9).
67 -- K Buchanan (King James VI).
69 -- S Michie (Kinross) (3) bih, I Wilson (Craigie Hill) (5), S

67 -- J O'Donnell (Craigie Hill) (20).
69 -- J Bremner (Craigie Hill) (17), C Brown (Craigie Hill) (11), N
Robertson (King James VI) (10), D Sneddon (Alyth) (12).
* IRVINE Bogside member Alec Gourlay put his local knowledge to good
use over his home course yesterday to pick up first prize in the
Ayrshire Strokeplay Championship.
Gourlay's rounds of 73 and 71 gave him a two-over-par total of 144,
two strokes ahead of three other Bogside members who finished on 146.
However, with their second rounds taken into consideration, Brian
Singleton took second place after his 70, Robert Scott was third after a
71, while Jim Patrick's second consecutive 73 was good enough only for
fourth spot.
Leading scores:
144 -- A Gourlay (Irvine Bogside) 73, 71.
146 -- B Singleton (Irvine Bogside) 76, 70, R Scott (Irvine Bogside)
75, 71; J Patrick (Irvine Bogside) 73,  73.

JOHN Beattie castigates debenture-holders at Murrayfield and says
''give real fans a chance.''
Thirty thousand debenture-holders did not turn up for the Scotland v
Romania match. Their tickets were, however, on sale at the gates of the
stadium. Where then were Mr Beattie's ''real fans?'' They also did not
choose to watch what was, in effect, a practice match for both sides.
Entertaining -- yes. A guide to World Cup form -- hardly.
Mr Beattie also makes a cheap jibe at the ''cute'' lady spectators who
''haven't a bloody clue about rugby.'' I attended internationals at
Murrayfield before Mrs Beattie was powdering little John's bum.
The girls who were going then are probably of the same breed who, in
fact, know considerably more about the game than the jeans-clad louts
who nowadays fall off the train from Glasgow or Dundee, hotfoot it to
the Roseburn Bar, then spend the ensuing 80 minutes of rugby jeering and
booing at every opposition penalty.
It might also interest John Beattie that not all debenture-holders are
of the idle rich. As I said, I used to pay at the gate until the SRU
stopped this and at the same time ceased to make tickets available
outside Edinburgh.
In order to ensure that I could see at least some internationals, I
spent some #1200 for a guaranted seat.
I still have to pay #22 per ticket (although Scotland v Canada was
only #17 and the Romanian match a mere #12). Add to this #13 for train
fare, #2 for a programme full of adverts, and hamburgers inside the
stadium at #3 a time, and it produces a figure worth considering.
Mr Beattie is also, of course, wrong when he says if a
debenture-holder decides not to go, then nobody else goes. I have to
apply for my tickets (and pay for them) some three months in advance. If
I do not take up the offer, then the SRU sells them to someone else.
As an investment it is a dead loss -- I cannot for instance, make a
profit by reselling the ticket, nor can I rent out my seat.
I do not resent this. I do resent your columnist's snide remarks about
people who have helped to build one of the finest stadia in the land
(albeit for their own benefit).

I READ with interest Jim Traynor's ''Final Say'' on Donald Findlay's
comments on the three-foreign-player rule.
He believes that it would damage Scottish football with an influx of
foreign players. He fails to realise that this rule has now stopped so
many Scottish players from seeking employment in England's top teams.
Ten years ago Scottish players were the backbone of many a top English
side in Europe. Now our players are denied the opportunity to play to a
higher standard.
The three-foreign-player rule means Scottish clubs will never be able
to compete with leading Continental sides -- and our national team will
continue to fade, because not enough of our players have the chance to
play in other countries.

JUST when we thought it was safe to read again, from out of the pages
of The Herald, once more, we had to suffer and bare witness to the
ramblings of that great self-publicist, Jimmy Reid (Ernie Walker article
April 20).
According to Mr Reid's ego, the English FA, managers, and Players'
Union have him to thank for pointing them in the right direction
regarding hooliganism.
According to him, we have Ernie Walker to thank for keeping the SFA
financially afloat. And best of all, UEFA have told Mr Reid how much
they respect our Ernie. With friends like UEFA, who needs a knowledge of
football?
Like James Traynor (April 17), I too was angry at Ernie Walker's
remark about ''Fat Cat'' sports journalists (Radio Scotland, April 15).
Does he not realise sports writers are accountable? First, to their
readers. Secondly, to their employers.
When the hangers-on at Park Gardens return from an overseas trip, whom
do I see for a report? Mr Farry? Aye, that'll be right!
What Scottish football needs is a visionary, not another
administrator. Whoever heard of a visionary administrator?
After reading Mr Reid's article in question, I've come to the
conclusion that the only qualification Ernie Walker has for the job is
that he knows Jimmy Reid.

I ECHO John Beattie's sentiments on the availability of Murrayfield
tickets for the genuine rugby fan.
Like John Beattie, I speak of those like myself who follow their club
to most games, be it a friendly or league, home or away, yet if
international tickets are not applied and paid for in advance (at least
three months for Five Nation tickets), then they have no chance of
getting them.
Some debenture ticket-holders are not supporters, never mind members
of any rugby club, yet find themselves in this privileged position. As
an ordinary supporter, let me ask the SRU, how many of the Scottish club
rugby players who are ordinary working lads could afford a debenture?
I do understand the SRU's need to target the privileged in society,
but what are the SRU doing for the genuine fans, who are, after all, the
bread and butter of Scottish rugby.
Just to end, I am not the owner of an SRU tartan shirt (I can't afford
one). Also, I do not claim to know all the rules about the game, but
know enough to enjoy it.
As for my attendance, I am a Stirling County supporter who missed only
two games this season.
More ink in your pen, John Beattie, as you take up the case for the
real fan.

Hearts 1, Aberdeen 2
WINGER Joe Miller and his Aberdeen team-mates are in no doubt that the
Pittodrie board should hand over the manager's job to caretaker manager
Roy Aitken now.
Miller made that clear after this crucial win over Hearts handed the
Dons the lifeline they have been looking for over the past anxious
weeks.
The result was as important as any the side has achieved in a season
which has brought them one crisis after another. Now Aberdeen have it in
their own hands to escape the drop and at the very worst end up facing a
play-off.
The former Celtic star, Miller, admitted: ''This has not been
something I have ever had to go through before -- and I would not like
to have to face it again. Normally I have been looking for honours at
this stage of the season, not battling to stay in the premier division.
''Honestly, if we stay up then that will give me greater pleasure than
winning any of the cups and titles have done. It would be even more
important than helping Celtic win that double in the centenary year.''
The drive and influence of Aitken has ben a major factor in the
survival fight according to Miller, once a Parkhead team-mate of the
stand-in manager.
Miller said: ''On a personal level he has been important for me
because he has handed me a free role in the side. I think that has
suited me and my own form over the past couple of months has pleased me.
''Roy still has the enthusiasm which he had when he was a player at
Parkhead. I can remember how important that was to that side back then.
Now it has been just as important to us even though big Roy is not on
the field. But he shows it in training still and in the way he motivates
the players.
''I would like to see him get the job because he deserves it. Any of
the lads will tell you just how big his influence has been in the
dressing room.
''He has a lot of good management qualities and he has encouraged us
to attack opposition players and be positive even though we have been in
a dangerous position ever since he took over.''
That position remains hazardous, but after two goals -- one a penalty
-- from Billy Dodds sealed this victory, Aitken recognised that the
club's fate is, to some extent, back in their own hands.
There is the Pittodrie showdown against Dundee United this week and a
victory in that could carry Aberdeen to safety and condemn their fellow
members of the New Firm to the first division next season.
''We now have the chance to put pressure on them,'' he pointed out,
''and see how they react to it. We have had to face up to that, so this
will be interesting.
''Certainly the nerves were jangling a bit out there today but I have
always insisted that if we kept putting together good performances,
which we have been doing for weeks now, the results would follow.
''This was important because now we will decide our own future. By
next weekend we would hope to have a clean bill of health at the club
and we will be ready for that one.''
Poor Hearts now find themselves dragged back into a possible play-off
situation. They should escape that, but manager Tommy Mclean was not
convinced that they would.
''We are not clear of the problem,'' he said after the game. ''Our
problem today as the same as it has been right through the season. We
have been giving away bad goals.
''We cannot go on looking for others to do our work for us by winning
games and helping us out of this position. We have to do the work
ourselves. Injuries have not helped us and players are still going out
there to play when they are patched-up, but we should not be losing
goals the way we did again today.''
The first goal came when Duncan Shearer went down in the box after a
clumsy, typical forward's challenge from behind by David Hagen. Billy
Dodds scored.
Then came the Hearts' equaliser from Dave McPherson which was fiercely
disputed by the Aberdeen players and bench. ''The players were sure it
was offside,'' said Aitken.
Finally, Dodds scored again to become a hero to the Aberdeen fans --
and, according to Joe Miller, a hero in his own dressing room.
The gods had smiled again on Aberdeen because Dodds might have been
ordered off for a challenge on Craig Nelson when he went in with raised
boot and caught the keeper in mid-air. That was before he snatched his
winner.
Then, even later, Peter Hetherston caught Nelson again seeming to
strike him in the face after the young goalkeeper had gathered a ball.
Again it could have been a red card. Instead, the players were
cautioned and can play what is virtually the relegation decider with
Dundee United.
The last word on that came from the rejuvenated Miller, who said: ''We
won't lose that one now. Not one player in the dressing room feels
anything other than confident that we can win the game and get ourselves
out of trouble.''
Aberdeen know now that they can determine their own future. Basically,
you could say, that with one bound they will be free.
That knowledge could be enough to tilt things back in their direction

I AM writing to commend you on your article in today's issue of The
Herald calling for consideration of a voucher system for seats for
internationals at Murrayfield.
It may be impracticable but the principle is right. Many of the better
seats at the Scotland v Romania game were empty, probably for the
reasons you mention.
Like others, I've been to a club game every Saturday through the
season regardless of weather, and stood at the touchline and enjoyed the
atmosphere, but been able to get to internationals only because I know
Craig Joiner and his dad.
I was also at all the inter-district games at Murrayfield and was a
bit frustrated at Mr Elwood and his stewards insisting that everyone sat
in their chosen seats and were not prepared to allow the few spectators
there to move to the edge of the seating area to give closer support and
standing encouragement to the teams. However, I appreciate they were
following the rules of the hierarchy.
One part you didn't mention was the exceptional amount of rubbish
blowing on to the pitch on Saturday. This was clearly down to the
youngsters not bothering to put crisp bags, etc, in their pockets after
munching their way through the contents.
Something imaginative in that direction is required from the SRU (e.g.
rubbish bins?) as well as to stamp out the jeers when the opposition
goalkicker is lining up his kick -- which Bill McLaren quite rightly
condemns at every opportunity.
I also agree with your point about Scott Hastings coming on when his
brother was injured. It was amazing that Graham Law implicity criticised
Craig Joiner for the collision with his captain when Craig had stood up
well in the tackle ready to off-load ball and his captain ran into him.

THE DM Hall Western Union got underway on Saturday with Ayr beginning
their defence of the title. But it certainly was not the best of starts
for the holders, who came off second best to Greenock, or to be more
precise, Tom Black.
The infamous ''TB'' was handed the ball at Glenpark, and with
conditions surprisingly described as damp and overcast, he ran through
the Ayr order, his figures of five for 14 restricting the champions to
just 74.
And 19 overs later, the 1993 winners were 25 points to the good, and
to add to his collection of wickets, Black had bettered his batting
average with an unbeaten 33.
For thrills, though, Hamilton Crescent was the place to be, a draw the
end result of a dramatic game between West of Scotland and a transformed
Kilmarnock side.
Killie pro Asis Mujtaba trapped openers Nigel Clark and Alastair
Storie leg before, leaving Alan Williamson and Jon Williams to make the
bulk of the runs. West were kept in check at 193 for seven, with four
wickets going to Imran Idress.
That total seemed certain to be beaten, Mujtaba knocking up 73 before
he left the scene on 126 for five. Then the fun began.
Jim Hill and Idress posted 58 in tandem before the latter found Craig
Wright on the ropes, leaving Killie requiring 10 runs off four and a bit
overs with four wickets in hand. Easy?
Firstly, Gordon Black was run out, seven runs came off the next over
before Zahir Dadaboy was removed. Hill almost followed in the next over
but was dropped, before a single tied the scores.
Mike Richardson then bowled Imran Pasha with the totals level and
after two dot balls, Hill missed, Mark Townson hit, and West gathered
the greater share of the spoils.
Clydesdale tied up two deals during the winter. One was to hire Aamir
Hanif, the other signing a sponsorship package with Progress Software.
If the hard-hitting Pakistani bats anything like he did on Saturday,
Clydesdale, too, are bound to make progress.
Aamir didn't come in until the sixteenth over against Kelburne, but he
still had time to crash the first century of the new term.
He knocked up an unbeated 118, made off 130 balls in 147 minutes,
stroking 11 boundaries and a pair of 6s, joining in a second-wicket
stand of 173 with Greig Williamson, who contributed 76.
Hanif grabbed three wickets for 39 with the ball to end Kelburne's
resistance on 123.
Ferguslie beat Uddingston, George Reifer's 63 cancelled out by 59 from
David Arnott after Stuart Kennedy and Mike Pawson had done the work with
the ball.
Meanwhile Poloc just did enough to beat Drumpellier at Langloan.
The home side reached 156 for seven and while Sajid Ali (58) made a
dent in that, it wasn't until Neil McCrossan connected with the
penultimate ball which he pitched to the boundary, that Poloc sneaked
home by one wicket.

THE close season decision by the East Assocation to cut back the overs
available to the side batting first in Ryden League matches from 55 to
52 was vindicated on Saturday when all five first division matches
produced a winner.
Defending champions Heriot's disposed of Edinburgh Academicals with
little difficulty at Goldenacre, Jim Love claiming five wickets as
Accies struggled to 145 all out. Mike Allingham, with an unbeaten 87,
and Ian McKinlay with 43, exposed the inadequacy of the target.
A feature of the opening day was the unusual firmness of wickets, and
there were plenty of runs around. Royal High's new signing, Mansoor
Elahi, hit 92 as the home side put Falkland through a baptism of fire,
but it was Paul Fraser's match as he scored 43 and then destroyed the
newcomers by taking eight of their wickets for 10 runs.
At the Tryst, Watsonians must have felt reasonably secure after Kenny
Scott had posted a century and Nathan Ball an undefeated 61, but Graham
Gardner and Ian Philip had other ideas. A half-century from the pro,
some typical blows from Eddie Pollock, and an undefeated 93 from Gardner
saw Stenhousemuir past the winning post.
Highest scorer of the day was Ross Birrell of Freuchie with 126, the
cornerstone of a total that was never within the reach of visitors,
Corstorphine.
There were two centurions at Grange Loan where Carlton's sluggish
innings was galvanised by Robin Singh, their new professional. With more
than half their maximum overs gone, there were only 60 runs on the board
as Graham Hurlbatt, Pete Steindl and Nick Peet kept a tight rein on
things. Singh's first 50 took 105 minutes but then he cut lose and raced
to his century in only 25 more.
Grange thus faced a bigger total than they had anticipated but a rapid
opening stand between skipper Roddy Smith and newcomer Gordon McGurk,
and an even quicker century partnership between Scotland men McGurk and
Johnny Everett maintained their grip on the game. They cruised home with
almost five overs to spare, McGurk not out 104.

Kilmarnock 0, Partick Thistle 0
SOMETHING wasn't right. Like being in the right place at the wrong
time. Know the feeling?
Eyebrows were raised in pleasant surprise by onlookers as for long
spells on the Rugby Park grass, the ball whizzed unerringly, to the feet
of intended recipients. It really was very strange.
After all, was not this a battle for dear life in the top division,
and when are such games ever pretty, far less entertaining?
Yet there we were, sitting surrounded by Kilmarnock nice shiny new
stands and enjoying ourselves. The people who bothered to turn up were
the winners, even if one of the teams did not actually manage to stick
their head in front on the line. But it wasn't through the want of
trying.
If anything, Partick Thistle just possibly deserved to take the full
points, better and more frequent were their scoring opportunities, but
when the final whistle pierced the air, the Kilmarnock lot could not
care too much. It was party time as the point collected meant that they
were seven points clear of second-bottom place, and so, safe from the
drop.
Chairman Bob Fleeting had great difficulty removing a smile as he
rightly went on about how well his men had done in maintaining their
place in the big pool, while three new stands were erected during that
time.
Cash was made available for players when needed, and when manager Alex
Totten required more funds for the purchase of Paul Wright, Kilmarnock
vice-chairman Jim Moffat signed a personal cheque for the large amount
required. ''We are that kind of club,'' said Fleeting.
While the champagne corks popped and Ayrshire people chatted
excitedly, a lonely figure stood, head bowed in thought, awaiting his
turn for comment. John Lambie, the Thistle manager, has not had vast
amounts of the folding stuff with which to wheel and deal, but the job
he is carrying out at Firhill ranks only with the miracles in the Good
Book, and the manager still has more work ahead.
''I thought we did enough to win the game and that we were the better
side,'' he said. ''We are under a lot of pressure. We got one point but
think we deserved the three. The chances were there for us to win the
game, but we will keep battling our corner.''
The third-last hurdle for Thistle must be negotiated tomorrow evening
with a trip across town to the national stadium and a kick-around with
its lodgers, Celtic.
While other sides in the relegation zone are struggling with injuries
and suspensions, Lambie now has no such worries. ''I have a nice problem
for Tuesday night in that they are all back and available,'' he said.
''So we will just have to get ourselves together.''
Thistle's Gregg Watson, one of those with his feet up on Saturday due
to a one-match ban, did not look too cheerful as he made his exit from
Rugby Park. His place in the team against Kilmarnock was taken by Alan
Dinnie, who did not put a foot wrong throughout the 90 minutes. Watson
was quizzed as to the likelihood of his immediate return. ''I'm
available,'' he said, adding more thoughtfully, ''if chosen.''
With strikers Wayne Foster and Rod McDonald -- both sorely missed at
the weekend -- also available it should be an interesting evening in
Mount Florida tomorrow, and do not put too much on a Celtic success; no
use giving more money to the well-heeled bookies is there?
* HEATHSIDE will face Fifers Norton House in the final of the Famous
Grouse Scottish Cup at Hampden on May 13. The Ayr club got through by
beating West Kilbride 3-0 at Kilbirnie, but it was not just as
comfortable as the scoreline suggests.
West Kilbride scorned several first-half chances before Craig Gillon
put Heathside in front on the stroke of half time. In the second half,
Heathside were again under pressure until Gillon grabbed his second goal
in 63 minutes. West Kilbride battled bravely, but Heathside kept their
composure and Gillon completed his hat trick four minutes from the end.

MICHAEL Atherton is to continue as England's cricket captain until at
least mid-July -- but with a clear warning to toe the party line.
Atherton has been told by Ray Illingworth, now England's supremo, that
he must accept committee responsibility on issues such as selection and
tactics.
Illingworth announced at Headingley yesterday that he had appointed
Atherton for the three Texaco Trophy one-day internationals, and the
first three Cornhill Tests against the West Indies.
But Illingworth also disclosed that he had instructed Atherton to be
more careful about what he says in public, and added he had laid down
clear demarcation lines. Atherton, for his part, reacted to his
re-appointment by suggesting he had been irritated that the question of
the captaincy had become such an early season issue.
''I'm glad the speculation is over. Everyone needed to know where they
stand,'' he said.

SCOTTISH international runners Sinead Dudgeon of Edinburgh and Lorna
Silver of Dundee, each scored double victories in the Scottish
Universities Athletic Championships at Grangemouth Stadium.
Dudgeon easily won both sprints in 12.6sec and 24.9sec as she builds
up for next weekend's British Universities Championships at Meadowbank,
where she is hoping for better conditions. She faced a cold headwind in
both races on Saturday, as did fellow British junior cap Douglas Walker
(Heriot-Watt), who won the men's 100 metres in 10.8.
Silver, in addition to winning her speciality, the 400m hurdles, in
61.7sec, took the sprint hurdles in 15.5. The only record-breaker was
Gail Marshall (Glasgow), who added 20cms to her own Scottish native pole
vault record with a clearance of 2.80 metres.
Paul Walker (Edinburgh), the Liverpool Harrier who represented Britain
in the last World Student Games in Buffalo, looks again a strong
contender for the team. He won the 800 in 1min 59.5sec while another
good Edinburgh 800 metres prospect, Hayley Parkinson, won the women's
title.
Colin Bryce (Edinburgh) won the hammer with a throw of 48.62m, the
discus with a modest effort of 30.98, and was second in the shot.
* TWO of Scotland's top road racing clubs, Leslie Deans RC and
Shettleston Harriers, recorded excellent performances to finish ninth

metres races at last year's Commonwealth Games in Victoria, won the
Bathgate Wheelchair 10,000 metres road race in 29min 40sec, with
clubmate Karen Lewis recording an oustanding win in the women's race in

ROSS Matheson had a bad day at the office on Friday, but like any true
professional he's philosophical about it.
Scotland's No.1 tennis player lost 6-1, 6-1 to leading English
teenager Jamie Delgado at a tournament in front of his home crowd in
Edinburgh. The previous week in front of the same crowd he emerged
triumphant with the princely sum of #650 as prize-money.
On Friday he had, as he says, a shocker. ''I went out and did all the
wrong things and got a bit confused. That doesn't happen to me so much
now. It's just one of these things. You can't play great all the time.''
But that is a blip in a career which has seen Matheson rise rapidly in
the ATP rankings from 700 to 250 in the past year. Losing, however, is
always a disappointment in front of those who matter. Matheson, 24,
acknowledges the amount of effort that others have put into his game and
is keen to please them. ''It's very important to me. There are a lot of
people around you who will have a much better day if you win and that
means a lot to me. I feel good about winning matches but I feel better
for other people, almost.''
There was never any question of an alternative career for Matheson.
His family is steeped in the sport. His father, Harry, represented
Scotland a record 36 times and his mother, as Carole Rosser, played at
Wimbledon in the sixties.
''I never wanted to do anything else. As a boy of seven or eight they
used to peel me off the courts at the club. When I played someone who
was better than me I would ask them if they had played at Wimbledon. It
was the first question I would ask. You have your dreams and I'm not
prepared to sacrifice them.''
There were sacrifices, however, as a teenager.
''As tennis became more important it took up more and more time and I
drifted away from a lot of friendships between the ages of 14 and 18,''
he says. ''I wouldn't turn up for a party and friends couldn't
understand that because they saw tennis as being so boring. That's tough
to take as a kid. Luckily my parents understood and guided me in the
right direction.''
That sense of direction has meant that life has been increasingly
hectic since joining the tour in 1992. ''I've had so many ups and downs.
Of course everybody's there to win but only one guy's actually going to
do it.
But the sheer organisation of being a tennis gipsy, always on the move
in the quest for the all-important move up the ATP rankings, is
exhausting in itself.
''The first year was an unbelievable novelty. I went to everywhere
under the sun and had a ball. Halfway throught the second year I
realised I couldn't remember being in any one place for two weeks at a
time.
''One day I was doing my laundry in Korea and I thought 'I'm here
today, I was in Australia yesterday, and I'm off to Britain tomorrow.'
Some mornings you waken up in a hotel room and you have to make a
conscious effort to remember where you are.''
Before this three-week stay at home he had touched down briefly in
Estoril, Monte Carlo, and Barcelona for ATP tournaments. It's a far cry
from the lifestyle of the Samprases and Agassis of the world who are
treated like kings to that of those struggling to make their way up.
Flights alone cost Matheson #15,000 last year.
Yet Matheson the player can also appreciate the sheer genius of the
players at the apex of the tennis pyramid.
Scotland's top player has set his sights on being in the world top 100
by the time he is 27. He cites Jeremy Bates as an example that British
players tend to develop later.
Bates is playing his best tennis now and has his highest ranking.
Matheson has already made remarkable progress in his quest to reach the
top. Some really good days at the office will help him on his way.

* SURREY carved out a historic win after following on in their
Britannic Assurance County Championship match against Gloucestershire at
The Oval yesterday.
It was the first time Surrey managed to turn a follow-on into victory
in a championship match -- and the first time they had done it in any
first class match since 1868 when Cambridge University were the losers
at The Oval.
Alistair Brown reached a career-best 187 in helping his side to make
475 in the 50 minutes the visitors took to wrap up Surrey's second
innings in the morning.
That left Gloucestershire a victory target of 301 from 86 overs. They
slumped to 207 all out as Joey Benjamin picked up his second four-wicket
haul of the game for Surrey, who collected 21 points.
Warwickshire met little final-day resistance as they launched their
championship defence with a 215-run victory over Middlesex at Edgbaston.
The 22-point success was wrapped up when spinner Neil Smith had Phil
Tufnell stumped during the second over after lunch as the visitors
slumped from 60 for one at start of play to 137 all out.
But Middlesex's slim chance of making 353 required for victory was
effectively crushed inside the morning's first four overs with Mark
Ramprakash, John Carr and Paul Weekes out.

* AUSTRALIA were jolted by a brilliant Jimmy Adams catch and a
questionable decision against David Boon on the second day of the fourth
and deciding Test against the West Indies in Kingston yesterday.
The tourists, who began their reply to the West Indies' first innings
of 265 at the start of the day, were 91 for three at lunch with Mark
Waugh (21) and Steve Waugh (4) at the crease. And these two sparked a
fine fightback to have their team at 192 for three at tea.
Opener Mark Taylor was out to Courtney Walsh for eight with the total
only 17, with Adams stretching out a hand at short-leg and clinging on
to a stunning catch.
Then Boon, on 17 and with Australia 50 for one, tried to pull a Curtly
Ambrose delivery which appeared to miss his head and bat.
The West Indies appealed for a caught behind decision and umpire Steve
Bucknor agreed, the Aussie standing his ground before departing.
Opener Michael Slater was next to go for 27 with the total at 73 after
having tried to hook a Walsh delivery.

IF YOU think TV tycoon Rupert Murdoch is a threat to the world rugby
order, have a look at what the Americans are up to. Bill Young, of
Glasgow, passes on to us an advertising campaign on behalf of the Golden
Gate Rugby Club in San Francisco.
It is immediately obvious that the Golden Gate boys do not subscribe
to the philosophy of peace and love for which their city is famous.
I tried to contact the Golden Gate club to discuss further their
sporting philosophy but could get through only to an answering machine
which reminded me to turn up early at the airport and to wear my green
shirt and khaki pants.
Other cheerful slogans in the campaign include:
* They wear numbers because you can't always identify the bodies from
the dental records.
* If you can't find the results in the sports section, try looking in
the obituaries.
It's all good, clean fun, I suppose, in the great American tradition
which gave the world WWF wrestling. But the Golden Gate chaps take it a
bit far with their motto, complete with skull and crossbones, which
proclaims: ''Trample the weak. Hurdle the dead.''
* THERE seems to be no end to the expansion of Rangers FC's business
interests. I was surprised to see that the Rangers News had expanded
into the area of property advertising, but less surprised that the house
for sale was located in Larkhall. The advert told us the property was
being sold ''F.P. #27,500''. Why do they have to bring the poor old Pope
into everything?
* GLASGOW City Council has set its sights on becoming a big player on
the sporting front with a big-money application to the Millennium Fund
to develop sites at Glasgow Green.
But a litle more attention to detail is needed if the city is to
become host to international events. Take the European junior basketball
championships which took place recently at the Kelvin Hall.
The players and coaches from all over Europe were intrigued by
Glasgow's idea of not having any scoreboards. This in a sport where the
score changes with bewildering rapidity.
Problem was that the main Kelvin Hall scoreboard was broken. A chap
from the manufacturers travelled up from Southampton but could find
no-one on duty to let him get at the scoreboard, and returned south
without fixing it.
Glasgow has recently invested in a number of brand-new, portable,
all-purpose scoreboards which could have been used at the Kelvin Hall
but were being kept at the new Scotstoun sports centre to help make it
look nice for a visit by Prince Charles.
Another unusual touch which caused some comment among Europe's young
basketball players was the fresh coat of paint which had been put on the
back-boards. It wasn't dry by the time the championships started and
made their hands a nice orange colour.
* LIFE is tough in the Ayrshire junior football leagues. Just ask
Hurlford United, who are languishing at the foot of division two. To
make matters worse the league table as printed in the Ardrossan and
Saltcoats Herald shows Hurlford as having played 19 games and lost 20.
* CELTIC fans may prefer not to read this item since it contains a
reference to their team losing the Tennents Scottish Cup final later
this month.
Should Airdrie manage a unique first-division cup double over Celtic,
one man is likely to be missing from the open-top bus parade through the
streets packed with ecstatic fans.
Airdrie manager Alex McDonald departs the day after the Cup final to
go on tour with Dukla Pumpherston, the collection of former players, TV
personalities, and Chick Young. They have become legendary and are also
quite well-known for playing charity football matches.
Their first foreign tour takes them to Toronto, where three matches
have been arranged against similarly heavyweight local teams.
* IT TAKES a special kind of footballer to have played for England and
still be remembered with great affection by Scottish fans. Joe Baker is
such a man.
The life and times of the great Hibernian, Torino, Arsenal, Nottingham
Forest, Sunderland, and Raith Rovers centre-forward are recorded in an
unusual form. Two Hibs fanatics, Jim Hossack and Pat Higney, have
compiled the Joe Baker Football Quiz Book, which meanders through his
career.
The Glasgow Hibs fans are also holding a Joe Baker evening at the BBC
Club on Saturday, May 27, with the great man in attendance.

Dundee United 0,
Hibernian 1
ALARMED Dundee United manager Billy Kirkwood will appoint a search
party for a striker within his shell-shocked Tannadice playing staff
this week, as his former Terrors ready themselves for arguably their
biggest ever league task when tackling similarly relegation-threatened
Aberdeen at Pittodrie on Saturday.
The meeting of the premier division's basement pair seems assured of
deciding which of the New Firm fills the automatic entry into next
season's first division, a role which undoubtedly will create
palpitations in both camps.
Few who spectated at United's latest disaster, the weekend's last-gasp
1-0 home defeat by Hibs, will be wagering heavily on their side's
chances in that one, such is the Taysiders insipidness where it matters
these days.
New manager Kirkwood faced a similarly-styled ''crunch'' meeting with
Partick Thistle at Firhill two weeks ago, gambled by fielding central
defender Brian Welsh in a main striking role, and the big fellow
responded with a points-winning double in a vital 3-1 relegation
victory.
Disappointingly for the man whose task is to pencil in winning
combinations in the current crisis, Welsh, Billy McKinlay, and Dave
Bowman had already ruled themselves out of selection for the remainder
of the campaign, due to suspension.
Matters were made even worse on Saturday when ex-Partizan Belgrade
defender Gordan Petric was red-carded along with Hibs comeback skipper
Gordon Hunter, to complete a quartet of unwanted non-starters for the
last two fixtures against the Dons and Celtic.
Mind you, if referee Louis Thow and his far side linesman had had
their way, it would have been Jim McInally and Pat McGinlay who would
have trodden the dreaded paths to their respective dressing rooms, in
what would have been the daddy of all ''mistaken identity'' decisions.
That pair had been nowhere near the incident spotted by the linesman,
although their jersey numbers did exactly correspond with those worn by
the real culprits. After the comedy of errors was sorted out, following
further consultation between the officials, both of the innocent parties
sighed with relief.
Eventual match-winner McGinlay said: ''We were saved only by Jim
putting forward a case to be considered by the referee. He undoubtedly
saved me from being red-carded.''
Jim McInally responded: ''What actually saved us was managing to place
a doubt in the mind of the referee.''
Speaking as a neutral, the question of mistaken identity remains a
mystery, with Petric standing 6ft 3ins, while McInally is a mere 5ft
8ins.
Anyway, although Jim saved Pat at that stage, the Hibs man offered
little by way of thanks, netting the eighty-eighth minute winner which
plunged hosts United deeper into a relegation swamp which is fast
engulfing them.
Frankly, on the evidence of Saturday, the Tangerines are badly in need
of a miracle if they hope to avoid slipping out of the premier division
for the first time since its introduction.

The convener of East Renfrewshire Council is steering a course for
Labour in unchartered territory. JOHN MacCALMAN profiles a leader doing
his best to reassure Conservative residents who fear a socialist
invasion.
DOWN in the leafy suburbs of Eastwood, they're in for a big surprise.
There are stirrings in the undergrowth and the natives fear the worst.
Since the election catastrophe last month which gave Labour its
celebrated triumph in the new East Renfrewshire, residents in the sacred
Conservative territory of Eastwood have been speculating on what form of
municipal savagery will be visited upon them them by the ''bears'' from
Barrhead, Neilston, and Uplawmoor.
There are apocryphal tales of parents threatening their children to
sleep by uttering the dread name of Owen Taylor, the current Labour
leader on Renfrew District Council.
''Sleep, or Black Owen will come round and put up the council tax!''
That same Owen Taylor is now convener of the new East Renfrewshire
Council, incorporating Eastwood, Barrhead, Neilston, and Uplawmoor.
Aware of the fear factor among some Eastwood residents, Mr Taylor has
been doing his best to reassure residents that the advent of socialism
in their midst need not signal the end of civilisation as they know it.
Indeed, he argues it could provide wide-ranging benefits for all.
While admitting that his party's trimuph in a Tory heartland was one
of the sweetest of life's experiences, he is adamant his minority Labour
administration will work with the Liberals, the Independent, and even
the remaining Conservatives to ensure a high quality of lifestyle and
environment for all sections of the community.
''I'm not a Paisley urban animal,'' asserts the 40-year-old father of
two who draws his political inspiration from Harold Wilson and is very
much in the mould of Tony Blair's ''new'' party.
He is a Barrhead man born and bred, and proud of it.
Even better, his wife comes from Eastwood. With these credentials, the
future surely can't be all that ghastly to contemplate?
A further testament to his humanity is the fact that as a firefighter
he is in the business of saving life. Indeed, his occupation earned him
at least one vote during the recent single-tier elections.
He recounts: ''More than three months ago, I was involved in a rescue
of a Barrhead man from a fire and was hailed in the local press as a
fire hero, much to the amusement and consternation of my colleagues.
''On election day, the gentleman strode up to me at the polling
station and asked, 'Are you the fireman that saved my life?'
''I blushingly admitted I was involved in the rescue. Then he went on
to say, 'Well, you've got my vote.'
''I had been involved in resuscitation. But it was my colleagues who
were actually responsible for his rescue. I took a bit of ribbing over
that affair,'' he grins.
Over the course of nearly 20 years in the fire service, he has spent
considerable time in Eastwood, working out of Clarkston Fire Station. He
knows the area very well.
As he manoeuvred a rowing boat on Rouken Glen pond for our
photographer, Mr Taylor emphasised he was not in the business of making
waves in Eastwood.
He wants things to be ''boring'' rather than exciting.
He explains: ''We have to make sure that services are delivered, roads
are repaired, children are educated to the highest standard, and the
elderly cared for and protected.
''Our operation should be quietly efficient. No ripples!''
He is keenly aware that the ''new'' Labour will be under the spotlight
in East Renfrewshire more than anywhere else and will be judged
rigorously.
''We will be taking a very positive, constructive approach whereby we
hope to build on the strengths of both parts of East Renfrewshire, so
that everyone reaps the benefits,'' he states.
Mr Taylor points out that he and his colleagues from Renfrew bring
with them a great deal of experience and expertise of running a large
authority with a budget of more than #100m. They are also used to
running a minority administration, which could be critical in tight
voting situations.
A major priority will be to encourage stability in the education
system. Many parents are apparently concerned that children's education
would be affected in the upheaval.
He explains: ''We'll be able to work with neighbouring authorities in
Renfrew, Glasgow, and Lanarkshire to the best advantage of all the
children.
''We bring a message of reassurance, hope, and choice. We believe we
can offer an improvement in services and facilities.''
He promises to introduce free pre-school nursery education for all
four-year-olds in East Renfrewshire. That will be welcome news for many
mothers whose income is vital to make ends meet in the current economic
climate.
It will also cause a shudder of apprehension through the ranks of
cash-conscious Conservatives who will see the spectre of huge budgets
looming on the horizon.
However, Mr Taylor argues: ''We will also give the people of Eastwood
choice for the first time. Up until now, they have been taken for
granted by the Conservatives. They have been expected to vote for a
Conservative Party that has effectively afforded them no choice.
''We are now giving them the opportunity to see that the new Labour
can offer a better quality of services and also be very cost
effective.''
He cites the case of the recent budget situation in Renfrew district
where there was no council tax increase, no rent increase, and no
charges increase -- and at the same time the council has been able to
''transform'' the town of Barrhead.
In his view, Eastwood's fear of Labour is without foundation given
Renfrew district's track record of dealing with the private sector, the
business community, and private house owners through the council's care
and repairs scheme which gives elderly owner-occupiers assistance for
repairs and improvements to their property.
''The real fear factor for the people in East Renfrewshire was that
their children's education would be disrupted, that schools would be
encouraged or pressured into opting out. That fear has been removed in
these elections,'' he emphasises.
Top of the new administration's priorities will be the launching of a
wide-ranging information and consultation programme to inform the
electorate of the implications of service delivery and to seek their
views on what they consider should be the council's priorities and
targets.
This will involve contacting every school board and all community
groups.
Mr Taylor complains that a ''laissez faire'' situation has been
allowed to develop in Eastwood with the introduction of market forces,
leading to an escalation of crime and a breakdown in the sense of
community.
He says: ''We believe there's much can be gained from developing a
sense of community, involving the police. But you have to show civic
leadership in order to promote a sense of community and a sense of
belonging.''
Another major priority will be the care of the elderly. His
administration will be introducing innovative measures in the fields of
health and nursing care to ensure that the elderly are well catered for
and protected.
He also feels that the elderly, with their valuable experience, have a
major part to play in the community and should become more involved.
There are also plans to introduce recreational programmes, which will
ensure all schoolchildren have access to leisure facilities and can
learn to swim and receive coaching in sports such as tennis and
football.
Attempts will be made to maximise the use of existing district council
facilities and what schools are able to provide.
He comments: ''We must get some benefit from the single-tier authority
and by this cross-reference between leisure and education, we can
achieve some of these benefits.''
The theme of the new administration would appear to be that they are
not in the business of alienation, be it political opposition or any
section of the community.
The local business community will be encouraged to develop a
relationship with the new council which in turn hopes to provide a wider
forum for airing the concerns of business and commerce, especially the
Government's revaluation of commercial rateable properties.
Mr Taylor pledges: ''What East Renfrewshire is going to get is very
much new Labour. We've got policies which we can be proud of. We will be
adopting a common sense, practical approach to improving the quality of
life for everyone in East Renfrewshire.''
He is refreshingly forthright about his own political career which he
claims has developed simply through other people inviting him to take on
reponsibilities.
He insists: ''I'm not a political careerist. I've never stood for
Parliament. I've never sought that as a career. I've got a commitment to
my home town's communities. That's my driving force.''
His rationale is that, in many respects, local government touches on
people's lives more significantly than national government and,
consequently, it is far more rewarding to be in a position to influence
the provision of services and facilities for people than to be stuck in
Westminster where politicians can be detached from essential
decision-making.
He joined Labour when he was 16, developing his political philosophy
during an ''exciting'' time for the party with the advent of the Harold
Wilson Governments.
He grew to appreciate the innovations of the 1945 Labour Government
under Clement Attlee. He recalls: ''My parents were able to explain to
me what life was like before there was a proper health service and the
indignities that people had to suffer.
''I believe that the new Labour Party is very much in that radical
line of the Attlee Government. It will enhance and strengthen the health
service and it sees education as the principal force for improving
people's opportunities in life, to give them a hand up, not a hand
out.''
Pivotal to the new Labour strategy is winning the arguments and
carrying the people with the party.
''That's something we've learned from Harold Wilson. If you win the
arguments, the votes will follow,'' he states.
Mr Owen Taylor is an articulate and engaging fellow, keen to discuss
almost any subject that arises.
However, he assumes a cautious stance when asked about the recent
allegation relating to the Ferguslie Park initiative, and Ferguslie
Community Business Securities.
He responds: ''The links between the Renfrew district councillors and
this affair are very tenuous. No-one has suggested their involvement in
any of the serious aspects at any time and the police have cleared their
names.
''If anyone can step forward with any evidence or information to the
police, I know the Labour councillors would be the first to do that.''
Other difficulties in the local Labour Party structure he attributes
to ''personality clashes'' which should be resolved ''in a very short
time''.
Ever the optimist, always taking a positive line, this talented
councillor is certainly not ''a Paisley urban animal'' and could well
surprise fearful Eastwood with his caring community ethic and sense of
civic pride.

Watching a Formula 1 race from
the side of a straight or at one of
the curves of a chicane is like
a study in the madness of others.
''GOD Save The Queen'' echoed around the Enzo and Dino Ferrari Circuit
yesterday morning a few hours before the red lights died and the greens
blinked, setting the San Marino Grand Prix into frenzied wheel-spinning
motion.
It was a test of the tannoy system, but not of the fates which decided
to smile brightly on Damon Hill after men and machines had been united
and let loose in a roaring surge of adrenalin and high-performance
fuels.
Such a potent mixture often produces performances which take the
breath away from lesser mortals, who can do little more than stand in
awe as the cars scream past at speeds which cannot possibly be conveyed
properly via television screens.
Watching a Formula 1 race from the side of a straight or at one of the
curves of a chicane is like a study in the madness of others. No-one in
possession of enough sense to know that car crashes can hurt would slide
into a cramped cockpit until almost in a horizontal position, less than
a foot off the tarmac, and deliberately try to force extra speed from
monstrously powerful engines which propel drivers at blinding speeds.
Yet, young kart drivers all over the world splutter around tracks
imagining themselves to be in a real Formula 1 machine. Man's
fascination with speed will make sure there will never be a shortage of
would-be world champions willing to take the risks, but there will
always be a distinct lack of drivers with the necessary credentials to
control the cars which lapped at Imola yesterday.
The marriage between man and technology urges the human beast to turn
out in all their varieties when the grand-prix cavalcade rolls into
town, and Imola was the first of the European grands prix. It is also
one of the most passionate affairs, because it is dedicated to the
magical name of Ferrari and also heightens the Italian's particular
fondness for flashy cars with the guts to match.
The Ferrari team of Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger, who started in
fifth and second positions respectively on the grid, were cheered and
applauded every time the 80,000 crowd saw the famous bright-red shape
slither around a curve. It was the same yesterday as Alesi finished in
second place with Berger immediately behind.
The Ferrari cars were swamped at the end by Italian fans and it took a
long half-hour for the security people to clear them away and allow the
engineers in to dismantle, analyse, and crate them at the end of a
pulsating day which began with the arrival of the first drivers around
8am. They always come early to beat the traffic jams which back up miles
along the autostradas on race days, which is wise.
Wouldn't do to have the heroes of the day at a standstill while the
world waited patiently for the moment.
However, even the earliest of these modern-day charioteers would not
have beaten the inhabitants of Rivazza Hill, themselves heroes of the
grand-prix world. The first of them started arriving last Wednesday,
like a long line of lost souls in search of a place to settle.
They came by bicycle, moped, scooter, car, van, and camper. Others
walked miles from nearby towns, laden with back-packs and carrying
supplies to last them through the remainder of the week and then the
full weekend.
The registration plates on many of the vehicles parked everywhere
inside and outside the curcuit showed the crowd to be swelled by
motorsport fans from all over Europe, and after a couple of days basking
in sunshine, an overnight darkening of the skies and heavy rain
throughout yesterday morning failed to dilute enthusiasm. Saturday night
is traditionally party time on the hill, where the real fans congregate
in their own ribboned off areas.
They bring with them old pieces of wood -- some had their own
scaffolding poles and clamps -- and immediately start building platforms
on which they will live for a few days and from which they will view the
racers. Often they ribbon off their own patches, but neighbours are
always welcome to drop by and share the casks and crates of beer, which,
by their abundance, appear to be the most necessary parts of the
survival packs.
From a distance, the hill looks like a refugee camp with the makeshift
dwellings, and that was especially true yesterday with the pallor of
many of the long-term residents at break of dawn suggesting pain and
suffering. The party had been long and extremely indulgent, and row
after row of people sat slumped on their precarious gantries, with the
rain dripping through makeshift coverings of cloth, plastic, and
polythene.
As race time neared, and the rich and the famous promenaded through
the team areas and pit lanes being careful to step over the puddles, the
masses on the hill and all around the complex tried to shake off their
hangovers by stretching and wandering through the myriad stalls, which
seemed to be selling only Ferrari merchandise and memories of the great
Brazilian Ayrton Senna, who crashed and died here last year.
On huge white sheets and red flags dotted around the circuit, which
stretches just more than three miles, were words of sympathy for Senna
and also the Austrian Roland Ratzenberger, who was killed during the
final practice session last year. Before the race started, some of the
drivers also would remember one of their own.
They stood in a huddle as their cars were readied on the grid and
bowed their heads for a minute, each man thinking of a lost comrade.
As they held their private tribute, mechanics and engineers cluttered
around the machines making last-minute alterations using space-age
technology, but nothing it seems is advanced enough to predict the
weather accurately enough.
Rain had not been forecast, but it poured, and after various spins
during morning warm-ups, most teams opted for wet-weather tyres and then
had second thoughts as the clouds dispersed only 10 minutes before the
beginning of the race. Some changed quickly, others decided to go on
wets.
It was a matter of great concern to the team leaders, but the crowds
on the hill were oblivious to these deliberations which were to have an
effect on the running of the race. The masses were more concerned with
their damp living conditions, but perked up dramatically when a group of
Germans arrived waving huge flags with the name of the defending world
champion, Michael Schumacher, on them.
The Italians hoisted their own colours, jeered loudly -- making it
absolutely clear who owned the hill -- and German bravado survived only
as long as 10 laps into the race.
The German flags were lowered when their man spun off at Piratella and
smacked into a wall halfway into his first lap on new tyres. He had gone
in on lap nine to change from wet weather tyres to slicks, which were
cold when he lost his hold.
Schumacher's race was over, but the crowd were treated to a tremendous
spectacle involving their own Ferraris and the two Williams cars,
although David Coulthard, who was less than a second behind Hill, fell
29 seconds off the pace after having spun at Villeneuve and going into
the pits for another change and check. Another spin and more visits to
the pits, one of which cost him a 10-second penalty, left him too far
behind.
The race came down to one between Hill and Alesi and, by the time the
cars had been dismantled and the first of the huge trucks began to
rumble into the night and on towards the next stop in Barcelona, the
hill was only sparsely populated. They were doing their own repacking of
belongings, and draining the remains of their supplies.
It was time to move on and let the grass on the hill grow thick and
strong for next year's carnival.

SCOTLAND team manager Craig Brown seems a touch unhappy about the way
the untidy victory over San Marino was greeted by the Scottish press.
That view from Brown became a weekend whinge on radio which left me
smiling over just how easily bruised the manager appears to be.
He should take a look around the world and examine what happens
elsewhere when national teams fail to provide the performances the
public expects.
I have seen for myself just how different managers are treated by the
press corps of their countries and, believe me, Craig Brown and almost
every Scotland team manager has been feather-bedded in comparison.
Back at the World Cup in England in 1966, the mild-mannered, patient
and polite Edmondo Fabbri, team manager of Italy as they lost to South
Korea, was verbally abused by the journalists and vilified in print.
When he returned home in disgrace he was pelted with tomatoes at the
airport . . .
After that same tournament the Brazil coach, Vicente Feola, and his
eminence grise Dr Hilton Gosling saw their effigies being burned at Rio
Airport when they disembarked after haing been kicked out of the
competition in the first group games.
Their crime was not being able to win the World Cup for the third time
in succession. They were the men who gave the world Pele and Garrincha,
Vava and Zagalo, Zito and Nilton Santos, and in England they saw Pele
booted out of two games by hatchet men from Bulgaria and Portugal -- but
their past reputations and the facts from the matches they played didn't
save the architects of the Brazilian legend.
More recently we saw Arrigo Saachi take his Italian team to the World
Cup final in the United States last season, only to find himself
viciously slated back home.
In Germany, Berti Vogts, a World Cup winner as a player, has been
forced to take court action in a bid to stem the personal attacks which
have been made on himself and his family by one magazine.
Even closer to home, across the Border in England, the two managers
before Terry Venables was appointed, Bobby Robson and Graham Taylor left
the job because of the scurrilous campagns mounted against them.
One English observer in San Marino last week indicated that the
criticism of Brown was mild in comparison to the vitriol which would
have been heaped upon Terry Venables after a similar display.
That is what Brown has to take on board. He has to realise that
criticism goes with the job -- just as praise does.
When the team drew in Moscow with Russia, Brown and his men were given
the accolades which normally go with a victory -- because journalists
and members of the Tartan Army alike were impressed by the performance
and recognised the importance of the result.
Equally, back at the World Cup in 1974 when it was played in West
Germany, tears were shed in Frankfurt by players, press and punters
alike after the brave but ultimately sad end to that campaign.
Incidentally, the Zaire manager, a Yugoslav, faced death threats when
his team crashed to his own country, 9-0 in the game which helped them
through to the second stage of the tournament.
Things have not been that drastic for Craig since he took over from
Andy Roxburgh.
Nor will it. After all, when Roxburgh failed to qualify for the finals
of the World Cup, the first time in 20 years the Scots had not gone
through, he left to take up a hugely responsible, highly paid job as
techincal director with UEFA. Hardly heading for a period of exile in
disgrace, is it?
Now, there is no way I am suggesting that here in Scotland we should
follow the examples of our colleagues abroad. More often that not we
mirror the feelings of the public. That has almost always been the case
in my experience.
I can remember the night Scotland defeated Czechoslovakia at Hampden
to qualify for the l974 finals. Willie Allan, then secretary of the SFA,
remarked rather acidly to myself and the late Jimmy Sanderson after the
game: ''No doubt you will have us world beaters in the morning.''
I seem to remember that we did, but Jimmy and myself also pointed out
to Mr Allan that the 100,000-plus fans on the terracings believed that
already.
Not too much has changed since then.
I was one of the group of reporters in Frankfurt at that World Cup who
were sneeringly dubbed ''fans with typewriters'' by an English
journalist.
Not too much has changed since then, either.
The basic hope among the journalists who follow the international team
is that Scotland are successful. There is also the hope that we will
play well.
Sometimes both things happen and everyone is happy. Sometimes one
thing happens only and there is a disillusioned air, even in victory,
which was the case in San Marino.
Sometimes neither thing happens and that's usually when the team
manager and the press come into conflict.
This time, though, Craig should not protest too much. Things could
have been so much worse if he had been managing another country's team
and the same scenario had been played out on that hilltop in Italy.
'Brown has to realise that criticism goes with the job, just as praise
does'

Navacerrada, Spain
IAN Jardine, the Stirling County centre, will play his comeback game
for Scotland against the Spanish Barbarians in Madrid tomorrow.
The Scottish Rugby World Cup squad is in Spain for eight days'
altitude acclimatisation training in the hill country north of Madrid.
The trip also includes two games -- against Spanish Barbarians and
against the Spanish national side on Saturday -- before the Scots depart
for South Africa on May 16.
The make-up of the side, which will be captained by Scotland A skipper
Kevin McKenzie, was announced by manager Duncan Paterson yesterday as
the squad underwent a gruelling aerobics session at their base 50
kilometres north of Madrid.
Scott Hastings, who won his fifty-fourth cap as a last-minute
replacement for brother Gavin against Romania nine days ago, again finds
himself in the unaccustomed role of full back for tomorrow's game.
McKenzie captains the side in the absence of first-choice hooker Kenny
Milne, who is suffering from a stomach bug and did not make the trip.
The ex-Edinburgh Academical Martin Scott, now with Orrell, has been on
stand-by and was due to fly to Spain last night.
He will be accompanied by Boroughmuir winger Derek Stark, who is being
brought in as cover for Cameron Glasgow. The Heriot's FP utility back is
named in tomorrow's side on the left wing but he has a back problem and
a final decision has yet to be taken on whether or not he will play.
Jardine, who sustained a seriously fractured right cheek in the game
against France on February 18, has not played since then. He experienced
his first taste of contact rugby during a training session at
Murrayfield on Saturday morning.
Paterson, without a hint of irony, said the Spanish trip represented
''make or break time'' for Jardine and everybody who was going to South
Africa would have to play this week.
''It really is make-up-your-mind time. Everybody is now playing for a
place in our opening RWC game against Ivory Coast.
''There is no concern about Ian Jardine's fitness. He has been passed
medically fit and, now, he just has to play rugby. With an injury like
that, it becomes a psychological thing and now it is just a case of him
getting into contact situations,'' said the manager.
Jardine, who was one of the successes of the resurgent Scottish side
until sidelined by the devastating injury -- which required two
surgically inserted plates to put right -- said yesterday that the
injury would not be on his mind against the Spanish Barbarians tomorrow.
''It was fairly well tested during our training session at
Murrayfield. I got a dunt on the face from Kevin McKenzie but everything
seemed okay. If you go into a game worrying about getting injured, then
that's when you do tend to get hurt.''
Derrick Patterson, the West Hartlepool scrum half who has been on the
bench throughout the season, gets an early opportunity to stake his
claim for preferential treatment in South Africa with his selection to
meet the Spanish Barbarians.
He is partnered tomorrow by Graham Shiel, the Melrose man reverting to
fly- half from the centre slot he filled against Romania, alongside Tony
Stanger, who now partners Jardine in midfield.
Jeremy Richardson partners Stewart Campbell in the second row but he
returns home at the end of the week for the wedding of his younger
brother and the Heriot's FP lock Andy Macdonald is in the party to cover
for his departure. Team:
Scotland -- S Hastings (Watsonians); C A Joiner (Melrose), A G Stanger
(Hawick), I C Jardine (Stirling County), I C Glasgow (Heriot's FP); A G
Shiel (Melrose), D W Patterson (West Hartlepool); J J Manson (Dundee HS
FP), K D McKenzie (Stirling County) captain, A P Burnell (London
Scottish), J F Richardson (Edinburgh Academicals), S J Campbell (Dundee
HS FP), P Walton (Northampton), I E W Peters (Bath), I R Smith
(Gloucester). Replacements -- K M Logan (Stirling County), C M Chalmers,
B W Redpath, G W Weir (all Melrose), P H Wright (Boroughmuir).

IF BOWLING clubs are mysterious, cricket clubs are practically science
fiction, and getting to Greenock Cricket Club was a bit like The
Twilight Zone: scary. A lot more scary for Ayr, last season's Western
League champions. They started badly and ended worse. It doesn't help
kicking off with Bruce Patterson, the Scottish captain for heaven's
sake, being bowled out. He was bowled out incidentally by Greenock's
professional, New Zealander Michael Sears (what is it between Greenock
and New Zealand? Greenock's pro last year, Karl O'Dowds, was also from
that Antipodean island), and then the subsequent dismissal of brothers
Alan and Albert Simpson. Both are top-class players. So is the Ayr
professional Adrian Hollshot, a South African glad to be here though
suffering horribly from the climate. He was bowled out in seconds.
Within less than an hour Greenock were knocking out the Ayr opposition
to the tune of 50 runs in 27 overs and four wickets lost. The august Ayr
went through the mill on Saturday though. They ended up with 74 all out.
A rout. A doing. A cuffing. I spoke to captain Charles of Greenock at
tea-time. ''We've done well,'' he said. ''Jesus, we could still lose.
Have you seen how bad WE are!''
He was probably only saying that to mollify the poor bedraggled Ayr
lads in their maroon skip-caps, who were reluctantly shoving down the
funereal baked-meats.
A word about tea in cricket. A word about cricket. It is the only
sport in the world which stops because it rains. This is not because
cricketers are wimps: it is because they have sense. Tea is not sensible
at all. I understand that when Rachel Thingmy Flint was the captain of
the English Ladies Cricket team she forbade tea as injurious to
performance. In this she is certainly right. Yet the fact remains that
cricket, still essentially an amateur sport, has the decency to observe
afternoon tea. Thus the cascade of fishpaste and cucumber sandwiches,
the tea boiled for two hours to a perfection known only to the memsahibs
of the hill stations of the British Raj, and a more important element of
British, and cricket, civilisation, than can be thought of by any
politician of whatever hue. Tea is the answer to moments of despair to
the British soul. A spot of stewed Darjeeling will always bring the
Briton round to his duty. Well it bloody well didn't for Western League
champions Ayr, for Greenock, little lowly Greenock, trounced the
Ayrshire giants something rotten, and I'm glad, I tell you glad.
For a start I'm glad that veteran Tom Black was in such good form. A
few years back he suffered dreadful injuries in a car crash coming back
from an international match in which he played for Scotland against
Holland. He still has back problems, but remains, at the age of 39, the
best player in the Greenock Club. I'm also glad that the little club,
set amidst the stone palaces of this little wet town, (Bud Neil used to
portray Greenock as a small blot with a black cloud over it and teeming
rain pouring down), does so well. It has scarce above 300 members but,
as ex-president Jim Mitchell told me, things are looking up. ''Greenock
is very old, set up in 1862, and we are also a hockey club. The local
authority has built a new all-weather pitch less than a mile away from
us. We used to have to play in Largs, but now we're nearer to home,
well,'' he said with some glee, ''well, the bar-takings have improved
hugely. Mind you, we need more members. Especially the women''.
I spoke to two of the women there and had the quote of the day. They
were quite young women. In fact they were Jim's grandaughters, two wee
girls with dimples for heaven's sake. Amy, aged six, said she wanted
another Coke to go with her grandpa's pint, and Lucy, aged eight, told
me she only liked cricket when there wasn't a match on. ''Then we can
play on the grass,'' she said. Clearly the lass thought these nasty
hairy chaps in white ducks and shirts rather got in the way. I told her
about Groucho Marx who once spent an hour watching the English game at
Lord's and when asked how he was enjoying it all said it was splendid.
''When does it start though,'' he said. Lucy thought about it and then
informed us all that she didn't care if it started or not. But she'd
like to play on the grass all the same. One got the impression that she
is not horribly interested in cricket. And, yes, I bought bottles of
Pepsi all the same.
There is a reason why I am talking of children here. The fact is that
Greenock, as a cricket club, actually started off as a playground. For
children. The only game they were permitted to play, back in 1862, was
cricket, and thus Greenock Cricket Club was born. And here's one for
you. The current captain of Greenock is a Mr D C Thompson. Ideal name. A
Beano for weans isn't it?

AN AIR of anything-is-possible has pervaded Huntly's relentless march
to a third successive Highland League triumph, and on Saturday, in a
footballing sense at least, you believed it.
Extrovert goalkeeper John Gardiner became the unlikely scoring hero
after just four minutes against Fort William when he netted Huntly's
100th goal in just 30 league matches.
That Gardiner's historic goal came from a spot-kick, did nothing to
lift the strange feeling that Huntly had written the script long ago.
Gardiner, a dressing-room joker who usually grabs the limelight if it
is not handed to him, opened the scoring before Doug Rougvie and Gary
Whyte headed two more in a curtain-closing 3-0 win.
The champions, however, couldn't catch Elgin City's record tally of
103 goals -- achieved three seasons ago when Huntly manager Steve
Paterson was in charge.
But a jubilant Paterson stressed: ''Elgin's record wasn't really an
issue -- they had four extra games to make that mark. But we wanted to
give John the kick, because keepers only rarely capture that kind of
glory.''
He added: ''It wasn't just a gimmick. John is fast becoming our No.1
penalty-taker. This was his second from the spot in as many weeks.''
Now Paterson is promising to strengthen his side further --
particularly if wide man Marco De Barros is snapped up by a big club.
Paterson said: ''Marco played only nine minutes on Saturday to protect
a groin strain, before he travels for trial matches for Grimsby Town
reserves against Middlesbrough and York City. Motherwell want him back
for a match trial as well.''
Elsewhere in the league, Cove Rangers confirmed second place in the
table with a 3-1 win away to Clach, while there were goals galore as
Lossiemouth ended Brora Rangers' hopes of finishing as runners-up with a
5-3 win.

ALL of a sudden, there are only two teams remaining with a prize at
stake over the last two games of the season. The fight for the second
promoted place behind Forfar was reduced to a straight fight between
Montrose, who beat East Stirlingshire 1-0 on Saturday, and third-placed
Ross County, writes Bill Sutherland.
The 'Shire have been faltering noticeably in the past few weeks but
they knew that they would be back in the hunt if they could win at Links
Park. Alas, missed chances in the first half cost them dear.
The home side's Colin McGlashan poked the ball home after a free kick
19 minutes from time and Montrose's vastly superior goal difference
means that the six-point gap is enough to rule out the Falkirk team.
However, 'Shire still can have a say in which of their rivals will go
up, as their final game is against Ross County. The Dingwall side have
been fairly consistent, mostly beating the teams that they should beat
-- such as Cowdenbeath at home. Brian Grant shot them ahead after 20
minutes and the win points were secured when Andy Macleod shot in after
a scramble early in the second half.
Forfar clearly intend to finish in style with no slackening off. A
Paul Hannigan double, consisting of a tap-in after a rebound midway in
the first half, and a lob 12 minutes from time, won the points at
Hampden against a Queen's Park team who pushed them all the way.
Barry Moffat had a joy day with four goals, interrupted by a Vince
Conway score, in Alloa's 5-0 romp at home against Albion Rovers. Only
324 fans turned up for a familiar, end-of-season scenario at Recreation
Park.
John Brogan's Arbroath, once anchored in second-bottom place, are now
favourites to finish . . . well, top of the bottom half. They took
outright sixth place through a Lee Gardner double, a drive and a
penalty, for a 2-0 home win over Caley Thistle.

WHILE there's hope, there's life. That seemed to be the philosophy
which manager Alex Smith conveyed to his Clyde players on Saturday when
they followed two lifeless performances with a fighting 3-2 victory at
home to Stenhousemuir.
Promotion is still highly improbable but, from an almost miraculous
combination of results, their needs have been reduced to a much lesser
series of unlikely events -- victory in their final two matches, two
defeats for second-placed Dumbarton, who have difficult visits to Morton
and Stirling, and no more than four points from two games for 'Muir. The
odds against all that are not astronomical.
Graeme McCheyne headed in Clyde's opener just after the interval but
Lloyd Haddow quickly levelled. Most of the five goals involved some
degree of defensive carelessness and McCheyne's second certainly
followed a mix-up. Winger Jack Muir, playing his first game of the
season, seemed to make the points safe eight minutes from time but the
Clyde defence went to sleep as Gareth Hutchison was allowed to pull a
goal back.
Warren Hawke scored a hat trick for Berwick but was on the losing side
at home to Morton, who were 2-0 down at one stage but were helped by the
sending-off of home keeper Neil Young. But the Greenock team had to wait
until four minutes from time before Marko Rajamaki hit the winner.
Dumbarton lost the leadership to Morton when the Sons again failed to
beat lowly Queen of the South, who hit back twice for a 2-2 draw which
inches them closer to safety. Only 144 fans saw Meadowbank beat Brechin
2-1 and Jim Leishman's team must somehow make up six points and 10 goals
on Queens over the final two games. Stirling Albion moved into a handy
third place when Joe McLeod and Colin Mitchell turned it around after a
David Beaton free kick had given East Fife the lead at Methil.

SLOWLY the trap door closes with an increasing number of survivors on
the right side of it and the rest scrambling about helplessly beneath
them.
More than ever, it looks as though Norwich City and Crystal Palace, as
well as Leicester and Ipswich, will have the door slammed shut on them
and find themselves cast down into the Endsleigh League with all the
financial as well as footballing disadvantages that involves.
Estimates of the cost vary from #2m to #5m; Palace are well placed to
judge, as it is only 12 months since they moved in the other direction
as first-division champions.
They had recognised the necessity to strengthen their side, but were
unlucky in that the best of their acquisitions last summer, Ray Wilkins,
played only one match (the opening 6-1 home defeat by Liverpool) before
injury and then the offer of a manager's post elsewhere claimed him.
QPR's gain was Palace's loss, all the more so since the other
signings, Darren Pitcher (from Charlton) and Andy Preece (Stockport),
have not shone.
Palace were in serious trouble even before Iain Dowie arrived to
bolster their scoring record, and his late goal in the 2-1 home defeat
by Nottingham Forest on Saturday was only the team's twenty-ninth in 38
Premiership games.
That is not enough and nor are Norwich's 35 from two matches more.
Having played more times than their fellow strugglers was always going
to handicap the East Anglians on the run-in and, like a steeplechaser
carrying too much weight, they have slipped further and further back in
the final furlong.
It was nevertheless a devastating blow when Ian Rush scored a winning
goal six minutes from the end at Carrow Road on Saturday.
Norwich must now visit Leeds next week before entertaining Aston
Villa, who, they can only hope, will still be catchable.
Villa were also the victims of a late goal, succumbing to Carlton
Palmer, of Leeds, who had been involved just beforehand in the incident
which resulted in Villa's Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich being sent
off.
West Ham, even before yesterday's win against Blackburn, have always
had games in hand, and four other teams previously in trouble all
continued to edge towards safety with goalless draws. Southampton and
Sheffield Wednesday drew with each other, while in equally uninspired
matches, Everton -- without the injured Duncan Ferguson -- took a point
from Wimbledon and Manchester City held Newcastle.
Never mind the quality, count the points: those four strugglers and
Chelsea -- who won their West London derby with QPR thanks to Frank
Sinclair's second-half strike -- have been doing so all weekend, and are
delighted.
The tension generated by Saturday's nine premiership games was evident
from the fact that only Leicester managed to win by more than a single
goal -- their 2-0 victory in the wooden-spoon match against Ipswich
confirming that Mark McGhee will have slightly better material to work
with in the first division next August than fellow Scot George Burley.
The wins by Forest and Leeds enhanced their prospects of returning to
European competition next season, while Tottenham lost ground but
salvaged local pride in coming back to draw 1-1 at Arsenal, with the
football writers' player of the year, Jurgen Klinsmann, answering Ian
Wright's goal.

DAMON Hill celebrated on the winners' podium at Imola yesterday while
David Coulthard, who finished fourth, stood in the background wondering
where and when his first grand-prix triumph will be achieved.
However, if it is left to Ferrari's Jean Alesi, the young Scot would
be facing a charge of careless driving and perhaps an endorsement on his
licence.
Coulthard and Alesi, who finished runner-up 18.510sec behind Hill, had
been involved in a fierce high-speed struggle for second place during
the first third of the 63-lap San Marino Grand Prix. Several times it
looked as though the French driver was about to pass before the Scot
closed the route.
It was exciting driving, heightened by the fact that the defending
world champion, Michael Schumacher, had spun off at Piratella on his
tenth lap. The German's Benetton car crashed violently into a wall,
ripping off a wheel.
The spectacle of battle between Coulthard and Alesi, a Frenchman with
Sicilian blood who is the local hero because of his allegiance to
Ferrari, had the crowd on its feet.
Alesi felt the younger man should have yielded, but Coulthard brought
into play the controlled aggression about which he had spoken before the
start and would not give an inch, much to Alesi's disgust.
''I have driven against many Formula 1 drivers but Coulthard is the
most incorrect one I have seen,'' Alesi said afterwards, and he refused
to change his view when it was suggested the 24-year-old Scot was merely
defending his position with aggression.
''I am not being hard with him because I have been in with Senna,
Mansell, Prost, and Piquet, and they were all aggressive, but Coulthard
was zig-zagging. It was incorrect and I did not like what he did,'' he
insisted. ''Also, he touched my front left wing going into Rivazza, and
I was lucky to stay in the race.''
Coulthard steadfastly refused to be drawn into a second struggle with
30-year-old Alesi, and said: ''He has more experience in Formula 1 and
if that is his opinion, then he must be right.''
It was, however, tongue-in-cheek and the Williams driver added: ''I
had a good race and I enjoyed the early part of it before I made a
couple of mistakes.''
He spun at Villeneuve on lap 27 then had a 10-second penalty imposed
because he exceeded the speed limit while driving out of the pit lane.
He had been trying to avoid spinning the wheels by changing into second
gear instead of holding down the button which restricts speed to 50 mph.
His errors ensured he could do no better than fourth place.
His penalty effectively ended any chance of making up ground on Hill,
Alesi, or the second Ferrari driver, Gerhard Berger, who was third
despite having stalled his engine during a pit stop.
Hill's victory, in a time of 1hr 41min 42.552sec, was his second in
succession, giving him a six-point lead over Schumacher and Alesi, who
are joint-second on 14 points, with Coulthard five points further
behind. The Scot finished second in Brazil, where he collected his first
six points.
There seemed to be bad blood between Nigel Mansell, who was tenth, and
Eddie Irvine, who almost finished in a spin after the former world
champion appeared to clip the nose cone of the Irishman's Jordan Peugeot
on lap 44. Irvine shook a fist at Mansell, who later said: ''I don't
know anything about it, but somebody touched me.''
Irvine also had recovered his composure and said: ''I was only waving
to Nigel because it was the first time in a while I had seen him on the
track.''
Coulthard, who was seen heading off in the direction of the Ferrari
tent, presumably to ask Alesi to explain himself, is still waiting to
experience his first grand-prix success, but before turning towards the
next race in Barcelona in two weeks' time, he said: ''I know I'm not
that far away in terms of speed but I have to hold it all together for
an entire race.''

The company's record is exemplary, but there is no time off for good
behaviour. For, as Mark Fisher discovers, Cat A is performing its new
play about women prisoners for Mayfest with a view to opening minds.
WHEN you visit a prison for the first time there are several things
that strike you. One is the smell. If you thought the disinfected stench
of a hospital was bad, a prison will knock you for six. Inmates will
tell you about the odour of too many human bodies with too many bodily
functions, but on a brief visit to Edinburgh's Saughton Prison a few
years ago, it was the deadening fug of airlessness and institutionalised
hygiene that caught me by the throat.
Then there's the sense of confinement. An obvious thing to say, maybe,
but until you have walked through door upon armour-plated door, bolts
clunking into place behind, it's hard to conceptualise what imprisonment
actually means.
But there's something else; an altogether more shocking realisation.
It's the sudden guilty awareness that however much you've discussed the
rights and wrongs of crime and punishment, you have never actually
addressed the ultimate implication of our penal system -- that the
solution to society's problems is to lock any transgressors away and
more or less forget about them.
Irvine Allan knows all this. He's the artistic director of Cat A
Theatre Company, a small Scottish outfit that burst on to the scene in
1992 with No Mean Fighter, followed it up in 1993 with Dirt Enters at
the Heart and is now about to complete its Take No Prisoners trilogy
with Doing Bird. All were written by brothers Willy and John Maley,
providing a vehicle to allow voices from within prison to be heard
outside -- and those from without to be heard within.
''I don't know if you've ever raked in the bins,'' says Irvine Allan,
''but the most interesting bits are always near the bottom. Prison is a
wonderfully dramatic setting. It's a really interesting way of
telescoping a lot of issues.''
But don't get him wrong. Allan is not in it for quick theatrical
kicks. Perhaps more than any group since John McGrath's 7:84, Cat A
Theatre Company is politically engaged and morally enraged, driven by
the disparities of social injustice and a desire to reclaim a voice for
the disempowered. The company's stated concern is not only with ''the
waste of prisoners' lives inside prison'' but also with ''society's
refusal to accept responsibility for their criminality outside''.
Thus, although No Mean Fighter focused on the prison experience of Red
Clydesider John MacLean, it also compared it to the situation in
Peterhead Prison today. Similarly, Dirt Enters at the Heart looked at
the spread of HIV in prisons as well as connecting it to the influence
of social attitudes to drugs and homosexuality. In its turn, Doing Bird
will attempt to depict the lives of women prisoners and make the links
with their experience of life outside.
Allan, a graduate of Glasgow's RSAMD, knows that there is no room for
agitprop in today's theatrical landscape. ''I think we've proved that we
can make theatre entertaining, poetic and interesting,'' he says,
recalling sell-out shows in community venues even in the face of
glamorous uptown competition. ''If you're not entertaining you're in
trouble. I don't agree with telling people what to think. You can
present situations in interesting ways and if you let different voices
be heard, if you raise the questions, you can let audiences make their
own minds up.''
As the company has progressed, so it has developed an ever more
physical style of performance. For Doing Bird, Cat A has drafted in the
acclaimed choreographer Liz Ranken to join its three-strong female cast,
bringing with her a remarkably broad range of experience with companies
and artists as diverse as DV8, the Grassmarket Project, and the Pet Shop
Boys. She expresses her enthusiasm for the company's working methods and
her commitment to ''anything that would draw people to think with more
compassion about people who are in prison''. Allan is energised by the
stimulus that she will bring. ''I haven't got the money to go away on
directorial trips and learn that way, so I tend to rely on the people
about me,'' he says. ''It's so exciting for me to work with somebody of
her calibre.''
Quite a leap, then, for the Dunoon lad who left school at 16 to be a
professional footballer. The son of a train driver and an auxiliary
nurse, Allan grew up tuned-in to politics -- his mother was a shop
steward for NUPE -- but with little experience of the arts. ''It wasn't
an artistic family,'' he says. ''There was no interest in theatre.''
Leaving school in 1974, he headed north-east to play professional
football for Aberdeen reserves. Two years later an on-field injury led
him to reassess his prospects.
From part-time football, he went on to a succession of jobs as a sales
rep and even did a spell on the rigs. Looking back he can make
connections between his passion for sport and his leaning towards
physical theatre -- ''I'm interested in how people move''.
While he was working on the rigs in the early 1980s, he got involved
with a writers' workshop led by the playwright George Byatt. He dug out
a first tentative stab at writing that he'd buried away in a drawer. ''I
was terrified about showing it to anyone,'' he recalls. ''Eventually I
braved. And everybody quite liked it. Then I got a chance to do some
acting and I really enjoyed it.''
Even now he regards George Byatt as a mentor, crediting him for
influencing his opinions about politics and theatre. ''He gave me the
belief in myself that I had something worthwhile to contribute,'' he
says.
Theatre began to take a hold and he became heavily involved in the
Aberdeen community arts scene. The logical next step was a college
course, but it meant putting behind him a well-paid job and sacrificing
a whole lot more. ''It cost me my first marriage,'' he admits. ''I've
been struggling in poverty for about five years now. Even for this tour
of Doing Bird I've taken a massive wage cut because we don't have the
money we wanted.
''There are sacrifices, but when I was earning good money, I didn't
feel what I was doing was very worthwhile.''
The foundation of Cat A Theatre Company came about by fortuitous
coincidence. Brothers John and Willy Maley had written a play, From the
Calton to Catalonia, about their father's experience of imprisonment in
Spain after fighting fascism in the civil war. Word of it spread to
Billy Elliott, inmate at the time in the Barlinnie Special Unit, who was
intrigued by the play's themes. Elliott made contact with Willy Maley
who was asked to take up the Scottish Office post of writer-in-residence
at the prison. Irvine Allan, meanwhile, had got in touch with the
Special Unit while doing research. He met Maley and Elliott at a play
reading. ''I learned so much that night about the prison service,'' says
Allan, ''and the more I've learned the more disturbed I've been about
what they actually do to people.''
No Mean Fighter was the production that followed, produced by a team
of students and inmates, and it has set the pattern for the company's
work ever since. Each play is reassessed in the discussions that follow
every performance. And the performances, which take place in and out of
prison, don't let anyone off the hook.
''We were worried when we first went into a prison,'' recalls Allan.
''If they don't like it they'll boo you off. They're not frightened. We
were worried whether they would accept a lot of the material, especially
Dirt Enters at the Heart where we were dealing with gay politics. But
you could have heard a pin drop in Barlinnie when we played there and we
got a standing ovation at the end. . . . We were acting out experiences
they had had to go through. It was hard for them, but they still
appreciated that the reality of their lives was at least being portrayed
for once.''
Billy Elliott, now serving his time at Greenock Prison, agrees that
Cat A, of which he is a founder member, provides a valuable alternative
to those ''elitist'' writers whose voices are more usually heard. ''Most
people in prisons like to see entertainment, but their reality is not
really shown,'' he says, explaining how his own writers' group at
Greenock is coming on apace. ''We're dealing with lives that people can
relate to.''
The subtext of the new show, which will play as far afield as Aberdeen
and Leeds, calling in at prisons, theatres and community venues
everywhere in between, is that all of us are ''doing bird'' because of
the restrictions society places on us.
By focusing on a prostitute, a shop-lifter and a battered widow (Annie
George and Molly Innes playing alongside Liz Ranken), Doing Bird looks
at confinement and prejudice in society as a whole, and suggests that
prison drama can exist wherever liberty is curtailed.
The experience has been educational in many ways. ''I was of the
feeling that if they've done something wrong, you should bang them up,''
confesses Allan. ''I thought I was a liberal, a free-thinking radical
and I didn't realise how little I'd thought about the system. The more I
get involved in it, the more passionate I become about trying to change
it.
''Most of the people who are in prisons are not a danger to society.
There are alternatives which should be on offer, especially to people
who are in for not paying fines.
''Prison is a destructive place where there's a loss of consolation,
privacy, identity. It is like a college for crime. We're paying a lot of
money to make people worse. It's madness.''
Allan thinks the system will never be fully improved without changes
in society as a whole, but he believes vehemently in the capacity of
theatre to begin the process of change, to provide a platform that is
free from censorship, that liberates people to speak their minds and to
increase the political pressure on the powers that be. And the Cat A
message is beginning to spread: the company has organised an all-day
seminar on Thursday in Glasgow to discuss the role of the arts in
institutions and the community; and there's also talk of a transatlantic
collaboration with a company in Manhattan interested in the HIV issues
raised by Dirt Enters at the Heart.

SURROUNDED by delicately-carved netsuke and grim Samurai armour in the
Japanese sector of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Save &amp; Prosper, the
unit trust group, last week celebrated the 25th anniversary of its Japan
Growth Fund.
The Tokyo stock market, which earlier this year fooled the experts who
had predicted it was breaking out of the bear phase which had run for
more than five years, remained inscrutable.
The 25th anniversary of a fund which has for most of its life been
remarkably successful was, however, an occasion for satisfied
reminiscence.
It was only the second unit trust to specialise in Japan and in those
far-off days some observers questioned the wisdom of entrusting savings
to what still appeared a somewhat speculative area.
A total of 4045 brave investors subscribed a total of just over #1m.
The fund has now expanded to around #262m. Anyone who invested #1000 at
the start would by the beginning of April this year have had a holding
worth #33,390.
Even the first manager of the fund has done pretty well. Patrick
Gifford is now chief executive of Fleming Investment Management, part of
the Robert Fleming Group which owns Save &amp; Prosper.
For those who like statistics, Japan had a population of 104 million
in 1970 and the count was 125 million last year. Gross national product
was 75.2 trillion yen in 1970 and 473 trillion in 1994.
The unemployment rate is 2.9% and inflation is zero, although a steak
sandwich in Tokyo costs the equivalent of #20. At the end of 1993
someone counted up the number of restaurants in Japan and found a total
of 473,894.
The earth moves pretty frequently there. On average there are 1000
earthquakes a year, most of them ''too small to notice''.
Currency movements have been a crucial factor for overseas investors.
The bear phase in the stock market, now around 5[1/2] years old, has
taken the Nikkei index down to less than half the peak levels achieved
when Japanese shares seemed to have nowhere to go but up.
The Japan Growth units have shown, however, a UK investor a 34.5% gain
in that time even taking into account the fact that if they had been
bought only a year ago they would have shown a loss of 18%.
Once again optimism is returning and the Save &amp; Prosper group view is
that ''current market weakness presents an opportunity for the long-term
investor''.
Despite the Kobe earthquake, which got a lot of the blame for wiping
out the flutter of stock market confidence earlier this year and the
exceptional strength of the yen, the group's view is that ''gradual
economic recovery is now on track''.
Estimates for gross domestic product growth show a rise of 2.3% this
year after 0.8% last year and a further increase to 3.5% in 1996. The
Kobe earthquake is expected to have a negative impact on profits in the
first half of the current year, but ''substantial benefits'' are
predicted from rebuilding and upgrading work next year.
With the bond market rally a helpful influence the comment is that
share price falls have left equities looking ''fair value''.
Rod Birkett, the group's Japanese expert who has been keeping the
units among the top performers in a sector which now totals 87 funds,
aims for below-average risk.
He admits he has ''no idea'' where the Tokyo market is going over the
next month or two. But he goes on: ''We remain positive on a 12 to
24-month view. The problems short-term are associated with the currency.
It is difficult with the yen surging ahead.
''We can see every reason why the yen should be weak on a two-year
view. The problem is what will happen on a two-month view.''
Although he believes Japan will continue to have a trade surplus he
says it will ''contract very sharply''.
To overcome the currency problem he feels the Bank of Japan should
''print money'' which would have the effect of offsetting the huge sums
sitting in a ''black hole'' of bank bad debts.
With the yen ''bubbling like the stock market was in the 1980s'', he
says investors in Japan have to be prepared to hedge against the
currency. ''Otherwise what you make on the market you will lose in the
currency.''
Historically the first stage of yen weakness has been characterised by
flat short-term interest rates and rising long-term rates and an
advancing share market.
The second half of yen weakness sees rising short-term rates, flat
long-term rates and falling share prices. He says: ''You want to be
invested for the first half.''
So for a fund manager prepared to hedge the currency he predicts the
best returns from Japan will be on an 18 to 24-month view.

An outbreak of Sunday night fever as 1000 disco dancers boogie to the
beat.
A TINY leopard has just toddled past me. Sequins are dimpling in every
cheek, from the stardust scattering on her face down to the last
paillette on her tiny lycra costume. ''Wiggle Wiggle,'' booms the sound
system. No need for further urging. By the size of her, she hasn't long
mastered joined-up walking. But right there, in mid-aisle, she starts to
strut her stuff, hips the size of collar-studs shunting from side to
side in meticulous time to the beat.
On stage, a team of over-16s are doing some kind of elaborate Mexican
wave with their legs. ''Enough Is Enough,'' thunders the music. They
spring to attention and advance on the judges, arms pistoning, feet
pounding, huge hair tossing -- and faces positively shining with a mix
of sweat, glitter and utter commitment.
This is Mayfest's championship Discorama, a day-long celebration of
what must be one of the best-kept secrets of the Scottish dance scene.
From behind the closed doors where they practise, over 1000 participants
have poured into Glasgow's SECC, all eager to plunge into a fantasy
world underpinned by the hours of hard work it takes to perfect that
strut, that back flip, that confident shrug of the shoulder -- and that
make-up which will have to stay put when everything else is moving at
high speed.
Believe me, things have changed since John Travolta slipped into his
white suit and swivelled his torso to the strains of the Bee Gees. These
days disco dancing is almost exclusively a female pursuit -- from the
grannies who mind the gear (make-up cases the size of cabin trunks,
costumes the size of tuppence ha'penny), the mums who crimp the hair,
sew on the sequins, do running repairs and wave encouragement, the best
friends who come along as support, braving the ozone-free zones of the
ladies' toilets (where it is wall-to-wall hair lacquer) in order to
assist with the donning of minuscule boob-tubes and glittering shin
guards, through to the competitors themselves, this is primarily a
woman's world.
For the organisers, Jean Sutherland, who suggested the idea to
Mayfest's Paul Bassett, and Robin Flynn, the event was already a huge
success even before folk started queueing up at eight in the morning.
Groups had travelled from Dundee, Edinburgh and Ayrshire to take part
alongside Glasgow competitors.
In fact, there had been so many enquiries from further afield, so many
people desperate to join in, that they could quite easily have scheduled
the event twice over. Which is what is going to happen next year.
''The idea,'' Robin explained to me, ''is to have team events one day,
the solos and pairs on the next. As it is, we're having to run things
almost against the clock -- and I don't reckon we'll be finished much
before 8 or 9pm.''
He smiles as he says this because this is the proof that a hobby which
is rarely given any publicity is a major factor in grass-roots Scottish
life. Jean Sutherland is also amused, but thoroughly pleased, at the
sudden interest -- television cameras, photographers, reporters --
because the Mayfest label has been slapped prominently on to the event.
For those taking part, the day is also, quite obviously, a
mega-delight. Everyone gets a certificate. Some will even carry away a
trophy. They leave behind a twinkling trail of jettisoned sequins,
echoes of beats per minute and the reminder that they'll be here next
year -- which gives us all a 12-month to learn how to get down and
boogie.

<HEADLINE>The BA 'hush money' claim derided as a vendetta</HEADLINE>

A FORMER leading Tory MP said to have been paid ''hush money'' by
British Airways claimed yesterday he was being used as a pawn in a
personal vendetta.
Sir Robert McCrindle, former chairman of the all-party Aviation Select
Committee, said it was ''beyond belief'' that he was paid thousands of
pounds to stop him causing damage to the airline by attacking it in
Parliament.
He believed a grudge against BA held by Mr Brian Basham, formerly its
public relations consultant, was behind the allegation.
Mr Basham was sacked by BA in the wake of the ''dirty tricks'' row
over the airline's campaign against rivals Virgin Atlantic. He told
Granada Television's World In Action programme that BA's former
chairman, Lord King, was afraid Sir Robert might prove a threat in the
Commons.
Sir Robert, former MP for Brentwood and Ongar, left the Commons three
years ago. He had been a consultant to British Caledonian before the
airline was taken over by BA in 1987.
A further claim is made by World In Action that Employment Secretary
Michael Portillo was employed as a BA consultant.
Mr Portillo yesterday confirmed he became a consultant to the airline
on February 28, 1985 and declared the fact to Parliament that day.
He said: ''I held the position until the end of June 1986. My duties
did not involve any lobbying or activity in Parliament.''
The World In Action report being broadcast today claims Sir Robert,
who now works as a PR consultant, was paid #10,000 by BA for one year.
The money was allegedly channelled through a public relations agency run
by Mr Basham, Broad Street Associates.
A report in the Mail on Sunday alleged that together with an ex-gratia
fee when his consultancy came to an end, Sir Robert received a total of
#15,000.
Sir Robert, however, insisted he never acted as a consultant to BA,
but gave general advice on parliamentary matters to Broad Street
Associates, which had the airline as one of a wide range of clients.
He emphasised that apart from three memos he wrote to BA, he never had
direct links with the airline or provided it with useful information.
Sir Robert said: ''The thought that I could do damage to British
Airways is extremely amusing and flattering. It's quite beyond belief to
think that I could have the great Lord King trembling in his boots.''
He said he had supported the recommendation that BA take over British
Caledonian because he felt it was the right decision.
''The whole thing is a frightful storm in a tea-cup,'' said Sir
Robert. ''It's a vendetta by Brian Basham against BA, in which I'm a
pawn.''
The affair was said to be embarrassing for BA because it has stated
publicly that it never recruits MPs as parliamentary consultants or
lobbyists.
BA yesterday insisted it had not acted against its policy. A
spokeswoman said the airline supported Sir Robert's move to Broad Street
in recompense for him losing his consultancy work for British
Caledonian.
Sir Robert was paid #5000 for advising the agency for 12 months up to
March 1989, she said, but never protected BA's interests in the Commons.
Sir Robert said he had been listed in the register of MPs' interests
at the Commons as a consultant to Broad Street Associates.
He claimed World In Action had presented a distorted picture by
quoting only part of a letter he wrote to Mr Basham in May 1989.
World In Action also highlighted what it claimed was BA's policy of
upgrading MPs' flights.
The airline's chairman Sir Colin Marshall is said to have told the
programme: ''Our policy on upgrading is to treat Members of Parliament
the same way as we treat members of our Executive Club.
''These are frequent fliers. Many of the Members of Parliament are
members of our Executive Club because they do a lot of flying.''

The group behind the Millennium Forest for Scotland initiative will
submit its final application to the Millennium Commission today.
The commission is expected to announce which bids have been successful
by the end of May.
As part of its major reforestation plans, the project would double the
core area of native woodland in Glen Affric and Glen Cannon, where
native trees have largely been replaced by non-native woodland.
Other plans include the extension of community woodlands at
Blantyreferme, near Blantyre and Uddingston, and similar projects in the
Borders, in Sutherland, and Craigmillar.
A tourism project at Balmaha and East Loch Lomond would concentrate on
highlighting the significance of the woodland and forest environment and
would include a visitor centre, upgrading of forest woodland trails, and
improved access and other facilities.

ACCESS to university education is ''deeply class-ridden,'' lecturers
claim today.
According to a review of higher education published by the Association
of University Teachers (AUT), the recent dramatic expansion in the
sector has mainly favoured the middle classes, the traditional source of
student recruitment.
The review looks at higher education throughout the UK but does not
provide separate data for Scotland where access to the sector has
traditionally been less class-bound.
The AUT -- which represents 30,000 full-time and part-time university
staff -- says its analysis shows that based on social class there has
been little change in the prospects for 18 to 21-year-olds of
participating in higher education.
AUT general secretary David Treisman said: ''If John Major wants to
take a significant step towards a classless society then the Government
has to commit itself to steady expansion of higher education for the
next 20 years.''
In 1992, 60% of those offered places in the ''old'' universities and
55% made offers by the ''new'' ones -- former polytechnics and
centrally-funded institutions -- were in social-class groups one and
two.
These groups comprised only 25% of the population. The analysis shows
higher participation in the ''new'' universities among social classes
three to five -- children of non-manual and manual workers -- than in
the ''old'' ones.
The AUT recognises that participation rates are increasing more
rapidly among social classes three to five.
But it argues that 200,000 additional places will be needed by 2010 to
meet the goal of equal social class participation, and to guarantee that
it is not at the expense of mature students, aged 21 and over, who now
account for over half of all university students.
Criticising the current consolidation in student numbers, the AUT says
its expansion proposals cannot ''wait for three years to meet the
short-term demands of the Treasury.
''Every year which passes without expansion sees higher education
denied to those who could benefit from it and pushes equality of
opportunity in education further away.''
The AUT document recommends:
* Spending of #5000 per year on each student. This has fallen by 40%
since 1979 and is to drop by another 6%.
* Restoring staff levels and improving pay conditions for university
lecturers.
* Putting part-time staff, who account for a growing percentage of the
total, on an equal footing to full-timers.
* Improving research funding to ''new'' universities so that they can
compete with established universities.
* Launching initiatives to gauge the quality of higher education. The
report recommends this be funded by the Government, and not
''top-sliced'' from existing funding. It says nearly #15m of ''scarce''
university funding is spent each year on quality assessment procedures.
The report welcomes the figures on age and gender, which show that, in
the five years to 1992, applicants aged 21 and over had increased by
215%.
Applications from women outnumber those from men, although the number
of women securing places does not quite match their representation in
the general population, 51.1%.

St Mirren 1, Dundee 0
INSTEAD of putting years on their supporters, St Mirren put them on
the park. In their team selection, they preferred experience.
Jimmy Bone, the manager, afterwards put his picking more plainly. He
had gone for age.
''That's probably the oldest team we have had all season,'' he pointed
out.
His sage decision made sure of survival. It was his aged ones who
produced the unexpected scoreline that reads in Paisley like poetry.
John Hewitt (32), shot the winner which Campbell Money (34) kept safe.
For extra rocks of ages, Saints also selected David Byrne (34) and Paul
McIntyre (28).
Alternatively, of course, age may have had nothing to do with it. An
agreeable spectacle of a game was also edgy. Everybody was jumpy.
How anxiety exhausted even St Mirren's Norrie McWhirter showed how
much both teams were suffering from nerves. The result was always in
doubt.
Although Dundee are working in the rafters of the division, while St
Mirren were in danger of falling through the floor, they contested on a
level.
In the end, the jitters about winning promotion proved harder to bear
than worries about preservation.
Hewitt thumped in the winner early in the second half, latching on to
a free kick that Noel Blake failed to head clear, his deceptively
laconic style proving deceptive than it looked.
Hewitt later volunteered that his shot might as well have landed
outside where a school playground used to be, although even he is not of
mature enough years to remember that.
''Maybe it was just St Mirren's day,'' a drained Jim Duffy, Dundee's
player-manager said. ''It must have been, if John scored with his right
foot.''
Dundee had a torrential spell after the goal. They shredded the
Saints. It was if it was felt their impertinence in scoring should be
punished. St Mirren should have been old enough to know better.
Heroically, it was the goalkeeping of Money, who may not have been
entirely fit, that stood between Dundee and their dreams.
A header by Jim Hamilton, after incisive service by Jim Duffy and
George Shaw, was improbably parried by the goalkeeper.
Three minutes later Neil Duffy had the ball bobbing clear in front of
him only eight yards or so out. He hung fire. His wait seemed eternal.
What was he delaying for? It looked like he wondered whether the turning
ball, like a spinning top, might start playing a wee tune.
Although he had always appeared the likeliest Dundee player to score,
he lifted the ball off the crossbar and out. Perhaps what held him back
was the thought that only a very special effort would beat Money.
In the annals of the St Mirren story, their goalkeeper's performance
on Saturday will surely rank as historic.
Jim Duffy was left to muse on what prospects remain for Dundee. ''We
have made it very difficult for ourselves and it is not going to be
pretty,'' he said.

St Johnstone 1, Raith Rovers 2
AFTER 90 minutes' play at McDiarmid Park, 2500 Raith Rovers fans were
ready to breathe a sigh of relief that they had managed to escape with a
point after a game in which they had been largely outplayed by St
Johnstone, achieved an equaliser thanks to a spectacular own goal, then
survived a strong penalty claim.
After 90-and-a-half minutes, it was all so different as the Fife fans
deliriously cheered an injury-time winner from Steve Crawford, their cup
of enthusiasm filled to overflowing by the announcement of the results
elsewhere.
Not surprisingly, the adrenalin was flowing in the Raith dressing
room, and scoring hero Crawford was naturally delighted in his
contribution to the Kirkcaldy side's eighth successive victory away from
the more friendly confines of Stark's Park.
''It was a great through ball from Barry Wilson which put me through
on the keeper. I looked up and saw Gordon Dalziel square in the middle,
but I decided to go for it and shot through the keeper's legs. I would
have got stick from 'Daz' if I had missed.
''Today's results certainly went our way and this sets us up for
Dunfermline's visit next Saturday. I don't think there will be a lot of
good football played!''
That statement will be at odds with St Johnstone assistant manager
John Blackley.
He said: ''Raith are definitely the best footballing side in the
league. It was important we tried to match them. We created a lot of
chances and we deserved more out of it.
''But that is how championships are won -- you go to the final
whistle. Full credit to Raith Rovers.''
While goalless, the first half was full of good end-to-end football,
with Raith getting little joy up front against a defence excellently
marshalled by man-of-the-match Kevin McGowne.
St Johnstone stepped up a gear with a series of corners at the start
of the second half and it was all they deserved when they took the lead
in 59 minutes. A long clearance from Cherry found Twaddle on the right
and his cut-back was met at the far post by the unmarked Grant McMartin,
who slid the ball home.
Three minutes later the leaders were level, thanks to one of the most
spectacular goals of the season -- but from a St Johnstone player.
Broddle's cross from the left was met by defender Alan Preston, whose
volleyed ''clearance'' from 10 yards out almost burst the roof of the
net.
The turning point came in 74 minutes when Twaddle burst through into
the penalty box and tried to round Broddle, who appeared to handle in
his efforts to control the ball -- but the officials chose to ignore the
impassioned pleas.
Raith raced down the park and only three magnificent point-blank saves
by Alan Main from Dalziel, Crawford, and Wilson prevented a goal.
His efforts possibly were fuelled by anger at the referee's earlier
decision -- or rather non-decision -- an anger which merited an entry in
the little black book.
Had Saints still been in the hunt for promotion, the feeling was the
ref would have needed a few more pages and a pencil sharpener.
But the main drama was reserved for that injury-time winner from
Crawford, after which the young striker was booked for sharing his
celebrations with some of his fans -- but who could blame him.

Dunfermline 0, Airdrie 0
SIX booked, two sent off. The cynics would have you believe it was
just another Saturday for Dunfermline and Airdrie.
Unfortunately, these statistics merely serve to underline the
irrefutable fact that, while our new breed of referees gain pass marks
in understanding the rules and regulations of the game, they fail
miserably to grasp the pressure and passion that drives it.
Call to the stand Stuart Dougal.
Before Saturday, few people had heard of the Burnside man. By this
morning, many never want to hear of him again.
Fussy? He displays more cards than Hallmark.
Dunfermline skipper Norrie McCathie admitted the crime count didn't
surprise him. And there will be some people, including his supervisor in
the stand, to argue that Mr Dougal was only doing his job.
He certainly clocked on early, booking Dunfermline's Craig Robertson
after only four minutes of this ''crunch'' promotion clash.
But, by the interval, he must have been as eager to get a refill for
his ball-point pen as he was a refill for his teacup.
By then, Greg Shaw, Alan Lawrence, Stevie Cooper, and Stewart Petrie
all rated a mention in his book.
John Davies had a chapter all to himself. With only 38 minutes gone,
he caught a Jackie McNamara elbow full in the face, and was sent off for
attempting to return the compliment.
Evidence enough, you would think, that Mr Dougal was a man not to
upset.
But Petrie, who survived a car crash earlier this week, ran straight
into another serious collision, this time with Jim McIntyre.
It resulted in Petrie's particulars being taken for a second time and
the sides being levelled for the remaining 18 minutes.
Allan Moore concluded a busy day at the office for the ref when he
became the sixth player to collect a booking.
The only pity was that, while Mr Dougal never missed a challenge, he
did miss the point.
This was not an end-of-season stroll in the park. This was promotion
football, with mortgages and contracts riding on the result.
Consequently, the 22 combatants should have been allowed a degree more
latitude to get on with it.
Ironically, the only tackle which caused an injury of note went
unpunished. McNamara was caught by Graham Hay and went to hospital for
precautionary X-rays.
Meanwhile, back at the game, the fourth draw between the clubs this
season seemed increasingly inevitable.
Lawrence squandered Airdrie's best chance when beating the offside
trap before running straight into Guido van de Kamp after a poor first
touch.
At the other end, John Martin celebrated his Diamonds' Anniversary --
15 years with Airdrie -- by saving superbly from Ivo Den Bieman's
header.
The result left neither side happy, but neither suicidal. Dunfermline
assistant boss Dick Campbell mused: ''We're very disappointed that we're
the top scorers in Scotland but failed to score at home.''
He added grudgingly: ''I suppose if there was some form of credit from
the game it would go to Airdrie defensively.
''Deep down, though, we are gutted that we didn't win, but it could
have been worse.
''It's still in our own hands because we go to Kirkcaldy to play Raith
next week. And, if we win our last two games, we will be champions.''
Airdrie boss Alex MacDonald was equally disappointed, but proved a
match for Campbell in the optimism stakes.
''We had three clear-cut chances and 75% of the play, so we've got to
feel we should have won,'' was his summation.
''The one consolation is that, with the way results went elsewhere,
and with Raith and Dunfermline meeting next week, we've still got a
lifeline.''
Stevie Cooper won't be on the end of it, however.
MacDonald reckons his booking means the striker is suspended for the
final league game, against St Johnstone. However, he will be available
for the play-offs, should Airdrie be involved, and the cup final.

Hamilton 1, Ayr United 0
AYR United can begin planning for next season in the second division.
Their manager, Simon Stainrod, will be under no illusions about the
task which faces them and there is no doubt they will need to strengthen
their strike force.
Once again during this 90 minutes Ayr created countless opportunities
but, in almost determined fashion, refused to take them.
That upset Stainrod, who worked hard in midfield, and he said
yesterday: ''We got what we deserved.
''I know we have had a lot of injuries this season -- more than many
other clubs -- but I am not going to make excuses.
'' We played well enough in a number of games to create opportunities
but persistently failed to profit.
''This game was yet another illustration of the way we have been
throwing points away. Call it naive or call it stupid, but we do not
score the goals and take the chances.
''As if that's not bad enough, this time we gave away a daft goal in
the last minute.
''I don't think some of our players realised just how important it was
to get the points to stay in the division.''
Certainly Ayr had every opportunity, for Hamilton had to work for 73
minutes with 10 men after Jim Sherry was sent off for a second bookable
offence.
But Justin Jackson was the chief sinner as he squandered a number of
chances. And they were made to pay when David Lorimer, who has made Ayr
pay in the past, got through once again to score.
* HAMILTON'S millionaire vice-chairman Robert Gibb died at the
weekend.
Mr Gibb, 57, had been detained in hospital with head and spinal
injuries after a car accident in North Yorkshire four months ago. He had
a further operation last week, but died on Saturday evening.
Originally from Strathaven, Mr Gibb owned entertainment complexes in
the North of England. He originally was appointed to the board at
Hamilton in 1971 and helped save the club financially.

Stranraer 0, Clydebank 1
CLYDEBANK manager Brian Wright believes his team have staved off the
threat of relegation with Saturday's narrow, but so vital victory at
Stair Park. He declared himself a happy man, saying: ''We are now six
points ahead of Ayr and 14 goals to the good. In my view, we are safe
and Ayr are down.
''We had four good chances, but their goalkeeper Barney Duffy pulled
off good saves and we are absolutely delighted to be in this position.''
Clydebank had stormed into attack from the start and twice in the
opening minutes they came close after defensive blunders.
Then, in the fifth minute, there was another gap on the left when
James Grady picked up the ball near the byeline. His low cross was
turned goalward by Joe Robertson at the near post and when Stranraer
'keeper Duffy fell on the ball and then inexplicably lost it, Robertson
got a second touch to push it over the line and put Clydebank in front.
It quickly became clear that Stranraer had little heart for the
contest and Clydebank pressed forward.
Grady was prominent and Ken Eadie ran and chased for 90 minutes,
pushing and pulling the Stranraer defence every which way. Eadie, in
fact, was unlucky not to score with a header on the half-hour. His
effort beat Duffy but was headed clear by Graham Millar.
Stranraer went in at half-time still one down but ahead in bookings,
most of which were born of frustration. Graham Duncan, Millar, and Tom
Callaghan were their offenders along with Clydebank's Alan Lansdowne,
whose team-mate, Paul Lovering, was cautioned shortly into the second
half.
There could, however, have been a different ending had it not been for
Clydebank goalkeeper Garry Matthews, who kept the drama on course.
Stranraer manager Alex McAnespie rightly praised the Bankies' last man
when he said: ''While I thought we had most of the second half pressure,
their 'keeper must have been 7ft 10in tall when he made a great save
from Darren Henderson's header near the end.''
The blunt truth was that Matthews' superb save was almost the only one
he had to make.
While Stranraer did feature more in the second half, it failed to
worry Bankies and Duffy in fact saved his side from heavier defeat with
a series of inspired blocks and saves.

SUBSTITUTE Scott McKernan is the toast of Beith after keeping alive
their Whyte &amp; Mackay Cup hopes. McKernan scored three minutes from time
to give his side a quarter-final replay against Pollok, whose substitute
Paul McGrogan had put them ahead.
The teams meet again next Saturday at Newlandsfield.
Kilwinning Rangers defeated Western Stagecoach title rivals Auchinleck
2-0 in their quarter-final at Abbey Park. Goals from Peter McKenna and
John Phillips in a five-minute spell midway in the first half gave the
cup-holders victory.
Talbot winger Barry Scott was ordered off three minutes into the
second half.
Shotts will meet Petershill in the quarter-finals following their 3-0
win over Dunipace. Alistair Fraser (two) and Chico Speirs were the
scorers.
Kirkintilloch Rob Roy drew 2-2 with Shettleston in the third round.
The winners will meet either Johnstone Burgh or Benburb.
Arthurlie kept up the pressure on Pollok at the top of the Reebok
Premier Division with a 3-0 victory over Cambuslang. The goals came from
a penalty by Davie Fulton and a double from top scorer Chris Wilson.
The gap is now seven points and Arthurlie have two games in hand.
Cumnock's 2-1 victory over Kello Rovers leaves them requiring only two
points from their final two games to clinch the Western Stagecoach
second-division title.
Hurlford United lost 5-0 to Lugar in their final game, which means
they have gone through their domestic season without winning a game.
Ashfield moved into joint-second place in the Reebok first division
following their 2-1 win over Lanark United. A late penalty by centre
forward Joe Smart, following a professional foul and ordering-off of the
Lanark goalkeeper, secured the points.
Possible reaction to their midweek exertions in the OVD semi-final tie
resulted in Camelon losing 2-1 in the Pendrich Steeplejack Cup and, more
surprisingly, their midweek opponents, Lochee United, going down 3-0 to
Montrose Roselea in the AT&amp;T League.
Glasgow's Kevin Toner, son of ex-Scotland, Celtic, and Kilmarnock
centre half Willie Toner, will referee the Camelon v Whitburn Scottish
Cup final at Fir Park on May 21.

Falkirk 1, Celtic 2
THERE has been little doubt that some of the best football we have
seen in Scotland this season has come from Celtic, who, on their better
days, can provide exciting entertainment. Their better days, however,
have been far too few and it is a fact that they languish somewhere
south of where they would want to be at this stage.
At Brockville on Saturday, however, the Parkhead men showed a side of
themselves which has been lacking for so long -- steel. Seventeen draws
in the league so far suggests that there has been a less-than-determined
attitude along the way.
The chips were down against Falkirk, who were on a run of five
victories and had been unbeaten in their eight previous matches. Jim
Jefferies had taken the club, which at the start of the season had been
widely tipped as likely to go down, into the race for a UEFA Cup place
and Celtic simply had to win to retain their own interest in finishing
second in the table.
A hard, bumpy pitch was not ideal for silky football, but neither was
the situation. This was a good, old-fashioned battle and Celtic rose to
the occasion.
Of course, the best chance for Celtic to qualify for Europe will come
at Hampden on May 27 when they take on Airdrie in the final of the
Tennents Scottish Cup, but it would be unwise for any of the players or
supporters to take that as a foregone conclusion.
Remember first division Raith Rovers in the Coca-Cola Cup final at
Ibrox back in November. Celtic had the class that day and gave the
Fifers the runaround for so long. Raith Rovers had the steel, and at the
end of the day that quality mattered most. Everyone knows where the
trophy is sitting today.
Now, when it comes down to steel and determination, hard graft and a
willingness to sweat, I don't think there is a side in any division in
the country who can match Airdrie. They have proved time and again that
when they apply themselves, which is most weeks, they can compete with
anyone. You can bank on it that they will apply themselves on cup final
day and all the class Celtic may display will in no way intimidate them.
That is a one of the reasons Parkhead manager Tommy Burns was well
pleased with the efforts at Brockville. He knew it would be a slog of a
match, and for that reason he left out little Brian McLaughlin. This
tight arena was no place for artistry. Those who went out to play were
asked to dig deep and they did so -- both sets of players.
Burns said: ''My players showed a great attitude in the way they
competed and I'm delighted. We knew the type of match it would be.
Falkirk are a big, strong side, but we matched them for determination
and maybe that has been lacking in some of our away matches this season.
''We went into the game having lost two matches and if we hadn't got a
result here, the pressure would have started to build up.''
Celtic got off to a great start after just five minutes. Andy Walker,
who was later rather fortunate to escape punishment after an incident
involving John Hughes, sent in a low drive which Tony Parks could only
push out and Phil O'Donnell was first to the rebound to score.
After that it was more like a cup tie than an end-of-the-season
affair, and Maurice Johnston had Falkirk's best chance in the first half
when Pat Bonner had a great save from a 30-yard free kick from John
Clark.
Falkirk did equalise early in the second half when David Weir was
pushed in the box and Brian Rice scored from the spot, but, with 11
minutes left, Celtic grabbed the winner. Boyd made a fine run into the
box and when he cut the ball back, O'Donnell's shot looked like going
wide until the Celtic full back stuck out a foot to steer it past Parks
-- his first goal for the club for three years.
So ended Falkirk's brave run which had taken them out of danger and to
the brink of Europe, but manager Jim Jefferies is convinced the run
should have continued.
''I'm delighted with the determination we showed,'' he said, ''but
they got the breaks and we didn't. For example, Maurice himself probably
doesn't know how that shot of his went over the bar.
''We dominated for long spells and after we scored with the penalty I
thought if there was going to be a winner it would be us -- we certainly
didn't deserve to lose.
''As far as Europe is concerned, the results went against us today,
but the situation can change every week and we will just have to get our
heads back up for next Saturday's match against Partick Thistle at
Firhill.''

Rangers 0, Motherwell 2
AS HE left Ibrox and settled into a chauffeur-driven jaguar big enough
to accommodate him and his cigar, Fenerbahce president Ali Sens might
have been a little confused as to which central defender was worth the
the #2m or so burning a hole in his pocket. He might even have wondered
if Rangers played in claret and amber. It was Motherwell who looked the
better team and it was their defensive mainstay, Brian Martin, who stood
out as a player of quality.
To be fair, Basile Boli, the man the Turks came to watch, had one of
his better games but did not come close to the performance of Martin who
was unquestionably the man of the match. The Turkish delegation intend
to have the Frenchman watched again but that may depend now on their
interest in Marc Reiper, the Dane they watched palying for West Ham
yesterday.
He could not have bettered Martin's show, however he did. ''Awesome''
was how manager, Alex McLeish, put it, and that may have been a touch
hyperbolic but it could have been a deliberate exaggeration, as his
remarks about how Martin had fallen below his own high standards in the
recent past perhaps revealed. ''If people like Brian fall below their
standards others like myself and Andy Watson notice it.''
However harshly he and his assistant may have put their case to
Martin, it seems that the players at Fir Park can cope well enough with
the McLeish ire. As striker Dougie Arnott put it: ''After working under
Tommy McLean I wouldn't say it was too hard to take, but he has been
giving us a bit of stick. We know we have let our standards slip
ourselves anyway.''
They were in the right mood at Ibrox to take full advantage of the
inevitable weakening of Rangers motivation, however much they try to
rouse themselves. Motherwell desperately want another taste of European
football and that incentive is firing them on all cylinders once again.
There was no doubt at all that they deserved their three points, even if
they had to hang on grimly for a spell after the interval, and they have
their sights set firmly on that second top place.
Arnott also reminded us that Motherwell were third in the table last
season after slipping a bit near the end and added: ''If we are second
this time it is not a bad effort to be runners-up to a team like
Rangers. It is so important for the club financially to get into Europe,
and the players all want to have that experience again.''
Arnott, who scored the opening goal, has a habit of doing well against
the Old Firm -- ''That's 11 goals in all I have scored against them'' --
and reckons it is because the pressure is always on the bigger club,
which allows him to relax a bit.
He and his team-mates were flavour of the month with their manager and
fans as they became only the second team to win at Ibrox in the league
this season. ''It says volumes for them that they played like that
against the champions.''
No-one could quarrel with that assessment. Motherwell recaptured their
early season sparkle and in the first half outplayed Rangers with some
well constructed football and tactical awareness.
Rangrs only briefly took charge after the break when Alexei
Mikhailichenko threatened to haul them into contention by himself. The
Ukrainian is a remarkably talented player, even if he is inclined to
doze off when the ball is not in his vicinity, and was robbed of a
leading role in what would have been a magnificent equaliser when he and
Boli worked a superb 1-2 which ended with the Frenchman' shot coming off
a post.
Despite Rangers' superiority at that point, they did not create as
many chances as did Motherwell overall. After Arnott had headed in the
first goal following a fine move begun by Shaun McSkimming whose cross
to the far side was measured for Tommy Coyne to nod into the little
striker's path, Motherwell continued to hold the initiative, with Martin
keeping Mark Hateley in check and various others making sure that Brian
Laudrup got few opportunities to cause havoc.
The Dane did manage one wonderful piece of football later when he
twisted Jamie Dolan this way and that before sending in a pefect chip
for Ian Durrant whose header was just too high.
The clinching goal, 10 minutes from the end, was due to a brilliant
contribution from Alex Burns, who had replaced Arnott a minute earlier.
He played the ball to Coyne who sent it back across field to him and,
when the ball was then laid in front of McSkimming he sent in a shot
that was deflected off the diving Billy Thomson into the net.

Doreen Taylor-Wilkie takes the sea air in a town
given the royal and artistic seal of approval
ASK most people who founded Brighton and the answer would be the
Prince Regent, later George IV, back in the eighteenth century. But he
was not the first.
Brightelmstone was a small south coast fishing village when an
enterprising local doctor, Dr Richard Russell, began to see its
possibilities as a spa. He recommended to his patients and to doctors
far and wide that pure salt water was the cure, to drink as well as to
swim in, and Brighton was born.
Certainly the Prince Regent was responsible for the town's best-known
building, the Royal Pavilion, which he started in 1787, gradually adding
an astonishing mixture of onion domes, spires and minarets, all grafted
on to an old farmhouse.
The sheer lack of inhibition of the pavilion is its great attraction,
particularly in the Long Gallery, which has Chinese furniture and
statues with heads that nod when the floor vibrates. When the young
ladies of the court were waiting for the Prince to arrive, a favourite
pastime was to rush along the Chinese gallery, then race back to try and
reach the end before the heads stopped nodding.
All this, one can see and hear about today on the pavilion tour. Its
present form dates largely from the early 1820s, when it was rebuilt by
Nash in the so-called Indian style, and a recent long refurbishment.
The promenade is perhaps not as elegant as in the days when the
splendid carriage horses trotted up and down but the Palace Pier
remains, this provides one of the best traditional cream teas in the
country at the Palm Court Cafe. Modern visitors can travel the promenade
on the world's oldest public electric railway, Volks Railway, which runs
from the Sea Life Centre to the Marina.
Much of the Georgian terraces and the old hotels of the seafront
remain. The Old Ship Hotel is particularly interesting. It started as a
fishing inn and became famous in 1651 when its owner Nicholas Tettersel
used his ship to save the life of Charles II during the Civil War. After
his restoration, the grateful king gave him a pension. Many famous
performers, such as Paganini and Mrs Siddons stayed at the Old Ship,
Thackery wrote part of Vanity Fair while he was there, and the painters
Turner and Constable both used it as a base.
Another reminder of the past is The Lanes, a network of redbrick
buildings along narrow alleyways, which sell everything from valuable
antiques, books and clothes, to ice-cream, coffee, or a drink in one of
the bistros, bars and restaurants. The name is a corruption of the word
''lines'' -- these narrow alleys were used by fishermen to lay out their
long lines to dry.
Over the past decade, the yacht marina has become important in the
life of the town, so much so that a whole village has grown up here
alongside the yacht harbour, which has a Five Gold Anchor Award to
indicate its high standard. Around the marina are several hundred luxury
flats, with a hotel and sports and leisure complex. A health hydro, and
various shops and stores complete the new district. It is luxurious yet
manages to retain something of a village atmosphere round a waterside
village square.
This south coastal area is not too far from London and yet it is
astonishing how rural it can be, and how quickly you are out into the
open landscape of the Sussex Downs from Brighton and its neighbour, the
town of Hove. The wide open spaces of the Downs still have many old
villages tucked away in pockets of the hills and cliffsides. One of the
most pleasant is Rottingdean with a village pond and church, very
popular for weddings with its old lychgate. Rudyard Kipling lived in
this village and his garden is open to the public.
Just as pretty is Alfriston in the Cucksmere Valley, with the church
of St Andrew, known as the Cathedral of the Downs. Here is also the
thatched roof of the Old Clergy House, the first building bought by the
National Trust in 1896 for a modest #10. With the National Trust holding
its centenary celebrations this year, the Clergy House will host several
events. Already, the Trust has planted the special Octavia Hill Rose,
which commemorates the centenary in the grounds of Clergy House. There
will be a family fete on the Tye (green) in front of the building, and
the National Trust Theatre launches its seasons here in May. But
Alfriston is lucky enough to get two bites at the centenary cherry, with
its own celebrations in 1996, largely based on the village itself.
Brighton and Hove are often called ''London by the sea'' because they
have such good eating places and entertainment. Many London shows have
their pre-London runs in the town and Brighton is famous for its oysters
and fish -- they are something to ask for.
From London, Brighton is a popular weekend resort. From Scotland, the
journey merits a little longer. But there are dozens of events which
easily fill the days and nights. The Brighton Festival in May has every
sort of music and theatre occasion, there are the Brighton Races and,
perhaps most popular of all, the London to Brighton Vintage Car Rally.

Carol Howland embarks on an expedition to some of the world's most
beautiful islands.
THE best reason for taking a cruise is to visit otherwise inaccessible
places in complete luxury. Or put another way, to cover wide distances
without actually moving yourself. The ship moves for you.
A Spice Island Cruise out of Singapore, north to Phuket in Thailand,
then a southern loop around Sumatra, Java and Bali is a relaxing way for
the sybaritic tourist to dip a toe into the tropics.
There are those who take cruises and never leave the boat; those whose
only subject seems to be to display their designer clothes and
jewellery; those who baste themselves in sun oil on a lounger to unwind
and the modestly intrepid would-be travellers who content themselves
with cautious, controlled, guided adventures.
Passengers are treated as grown-up children, with all irrational whims
met with an indulgent Filipino smile. Anchovies on every salad? Iced tea
with a straw, followed immediately by hot tea? Change the entree? Two
desserts? Of course.
First stop was the island of Phuket off the west coast of Thailand,
hardly inaccessible. Without recommendation an excursion to ''James Bond
island'' north of Phuket may be low on a list of must-sees.
Imagine a jade-green sea, studded by dark green-clad boulders rising
from the water to a thousand feet, a suitable inspiration for a
brush-stroke Chinese style painting. Ashore, ''sea gypsies'' sell
bracelets carved from coconut shells, mother-of-pearl hair ornaments,
carved elephants and bamboo handbags.
The island of Nias, off southern Sumatra is altogether different. Past
the town, this time visitors perched on plastic-covered boards spread
across a canopied lorry, we climb to Bawamataluo, a Batak village of
former headhunters.
Nias is as heady, warm, and pungent as the tropical house at Kew, lush
with coconut palms, banana plantations and a few rice paddies -- enough
to drive a winter-loathing European ''to do a Gaugin''.
The Batak are expecting visitors and have donned their red, yellow and
black costumes to perform a war dance. Then insist that we join in.
There is also plenty of time for every man, woman and child in the
village to sell us a carving, necklace or straw bag.
Padang, an unassuming town of 800,000 on the southern coast of
Sumatra, is the next stop. Climbing into the hills the tropical rain
forest is lush with tree ferns, palms, then bamboo and pines.
The Minangkabau, noted for their buffalo horn-shaped roof eaves, are
matriarchal, though devout Muslims. The intricately carved red and gold
Minangkabau house we visit, built only seven years ago, is owned by a
doctor. Five bedrooms ''for the daughters'' open off the long front
communal room, sons sleep at the mosque, taking meals at home.
Jakarta, noted for its pollution and traffic, lives up to expectation.
The National Museum holds possibly the best collection of Chinese
porcelain in south east Asia and the mini-Indonesia theme park permits
innocent exploration of architectural styles throughout the islands.
Next stop, Semarang on the north Java coast, is the departure point
for Borobudur, billed as the largest Buddhist temple in the world.
Statues of Buddha gaze serenely out over the green paddies to the
mountains.
Next stop, Bali, is arguably too accessible and over-visited. Happily
the Balinese cling tenaciously to their community-based brand of
Hinduism, the basis for the exquisite dances, ceremonies and crafts that
attract the tourists. The hotels may be expensive but the crafts remain
attractively cheap. The landscape is pure Rousseau; tropical jungle,
lush green rice terraces, brooding mountains, lakes mirroring temples.
Is there anything more graceful than a sun-glazed coconut palm?
A cruise ship needs certain tricks to lure its passengers back aboard.
A surprise snack of mangoes, chocolates and smoked salmon delivered each
evening to the cabin as the first sitting is called to dinner and the
entire crew lined up on the dock as a welcome party with a band playing
at the end of the day to Borobudur.
There are coffee and croissants on deck for early risers, the poolside
barbecues at lunchtime, and after a show and dancing, the chef's nightly
midnight surprise. A good cruise ship quickly converts the non-aligned
to holidays afloat.

I THOUGHT it was just old romantics like myself who thought they
shouldn't have pulled down the Glasgow Alhambra, that prestigious
building near the Central Station with its long record of theatrical
extravaganza. After all, nostalgia for shows like Five Past Eight, well
remembered for their colour, music, and sheer escapism, is no doubt
uppermost in the mind when we lament the passing of such a tradition.
While offering no apology for nostalgia, I can nevertheless bring you
this morning a more convincing proof that it was utter folly to remove
that great theatre, which was merely replaced by yet another of those
soulless blocks of the sixties.
More constructively, however, I would suggest the powers-that-be can
make amends by turning their thoughts to the building of a new Alhambra,
before Glasgow falls hopelessly behind other cities of the world in
meeting a modern demand.
I make the serious proposal after a weekend encounter with the
remarkable Cameron Mackintosh, one of the most powerful figures in the
entire history of large-scale musicals.
Mackintosh, who has made an incalculable fortune as producer of shows
like Cats, Les Miserables, and Phantom of the Opera, was travelling back
to London from his Highland croft when we kept a rendezvous in Glasgow
for a good old ramble through the current state of the modern musical.
The man with the Midas touch was overjoyed with news of a massive
advance booking for Phantom when it turns up later this year at the
Edinburgh Playhouse. His new production of Lionel Bart's Oliver is
packing them in at the London Palladium and could run for years. It cost
him nearly #4 million to stage and will eventually reach Edinburgh as
part of a tour which will maximise the revenue.
But what of Glasgow, the city which regularly congratulates itself for
out-doing the arch-rival, even in matters of culture? Why is it missing
out on those major West End productions?
Cameron Mackintosh shrugs and points out that there simply isn't a
theatre with the seating capacity and working spaciousness to make them
commercially possible.
''Major cities everywhere are renovating and re-building theatres to
accommodate this kind of thing,'' he told me. ''I had Phantom running in
Melbourne for two-and-a-half years and bringing in 75 million Australian
dollars. But the spin-off to the economy was massively beyond that.
''You need a theatre with 2200 seats. In Glasgow's case, you need an
Alhambra, financially as well as artistically.''
At 48, Cameron Mackintosh is already a legend in his own lifetime,
closely involved with the triumphs of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals
and displaying an instinct for theatrical success which is close to
uncanny.
His family background shows links with the clan chieftains of
Mackintosh, albeit on the wrong side of the blanket, but Cameron grew up
in England, where his father was not only a timber merchant but a
brilliant jazz trumpeter. Indeed, Spike Mackintosh had his own band, a
contemporary of people like Humphrey Lyttleton.
At eight, the boy was taken to see Julian Slade's Salad Days and was
totally won over for the theatre. By 1965 he had met Lionel Bart and
become assistant stage manager for Oliver, a show which has continued to
play a significant part in his career.
That huge production now running in London needs a constant turnover
of Olivers, Artful Dodgers, and 22 other youngsters who are set by the
law to make a limited number of appearances per year.
For that reason, Cameron Mackintosh will have a team at the Theatre
Royal, Glasgow, this coming Saturday to audition boys between nine and
16. It's a wonderful opportunity for lads who are under five feet, have
a good, unbroken voice, can move well, and are prepared for a spell in
London, complete with Cockney accent.
''I'm looking for kids with character,'' he told me. ''And Glasgow can
always produce that.''
Pinpointing Mackintosh's own success is a tricky business. But it was
when everyone else was turning down Side by Side by Sondheim in the
mid-1970s -- and he turned it into a sophisticated success -- that
people began to take notice.
''I suppose I have instinct and reasonably good common sense,'' he
assesses. ''I cannot create but I'm good at being creative once other
people have come up with something.''
He saw the possibilities of Les Miserables and secured the exclusive
rights. But it was Cats (based on T S Eliot's cat poems) which sparked
off a fortune to be measured in tens of millions. Who's counting?
Certainly not Cameron Mackintosh, a bouncy little fellow whose
enthusiasm bubbles with such effervescence you can accept his assurance
that money is never his motive.
Until Cats broke even, however, he was penniless and in debt. Since
then he may have amassed #100 million.
Despite that success, Mackintosh and Lloyd Webber are not working
together these days. The latter has his own production company and,
while they remain apparently good friends, one senses a keenly
competitive edge.
Mackintosh inherited his Loch Nevis cottage and spends much time
there, locally committed and fiercely defending the West Highland
railway. With the Channel tunnel link, he believes it will become as
much an attraction to Europeans as the Simplon-Orient Express has been
to us.
The railway bosses should pay attention. The man's hunches are
extraordinary.

MARC Degryse could become a Celtic player this week. The ball, as they
say, is firmly in the Parkhead club's court.
Celtic made their final assessment of the 29-year-old internationalist
in last night's championship crunch game against Standard Liege in the
Constant Vanden Stock Stadium.
Certainly, Anderlecht general manager Michel Verschueren expects
Degryse to join Celtic in a deal worth #1.3m. He said: ''It is up to
Celtic now. If they want Degryse, they will get him, and I am confident
he will move to Scotland.
''I spoke to Fergus McCann and believe we can do business. Degryse is
no longer motivated by Anderlecht. He has seen and done all he can here
in the past six years. We understand and will not stand in his way.''
The Parkhead club, eager for a place in the lucrative Europe
competitions, hope to enhance their push for second-top place in the
premier division by beating Partick Thistle at Hampden tomorrow night.
Once again, though, they face a major battle, for the Firhill club are
every bit as desperate for the points to escape relegation.
Thistle, whose ability to extricate their heads from the guillotine is
well recognised, helped their cause with the no-scoring draw with
Kilmarnock at Rugby Park.
It may be a tall order, but a victory over Celtic would just about see
the Firhill side safe before they take on Falkirk (h) and Rangers (a).
In the dogfight at the bottom, Thistle are three points ahead of
Aberdeen, who face a major crunch match with Dundee United on Saturday,
while Hearts are five off the bottom. The Tynecastle club, however, must
tackle an Edinburgh derby with Hibs at Easter Road on Saturday, followed
by a home game against Motherwell.
Dundee United, whose new manager Billy Kirkwood has had a hard time
trying to halt the slide, seem to have just as daunting a finale, taking
on Aberdeen first and then Celtic at Tannadice.
The remaining fixtures are:
Aberdeen: Dundee United (h), Falkirk (a).
Dundee United: Aberdeen (a) Celtic (h).
Partick Thistle: Celtic (a), Falkirk (h), Rangers (a).
Hearts: Hibs (a), Motherwell (h).

I HAVE read the Open Forum article, Sucked dry and dumped on the
scrapheap -- aged 44, and I have some sympathy for the position in which
Rick Powell found himself (April 20).
I too was made redundant in July 1991, aged 44, the result of
''rationalisation'' subsequent to the company I worked for over a
10-year period being taken over by a larger competitor. Appropriate
openings were almost non-existent and companies were more interested in
hiring someone half my age at half the salary.
Like Rick Powell, I did not take very well to unemployment, and much
credit is due to my wife for the support she gave me during this time.
It is easy to join the Bitter and Twisted Club, but life goes on and one
must get on with it.
After a lengthy but fruitless search for employment, I eventually used
the residue of my redundancy payment to buy over a small business which
my wife and I have now spent almost three years building up.
Rick Powell's article relates the effects of redundancy on himself and
others. I would now like to focus on the causes.
Not so long ago, a basic business management course would lead
students to believe that an employer had three particular
responsibilities to customers, employees, and shareholders. With the
passing of time comes change, and the changes in emphasis on these three
responsibilities require examination.
Increasing numbers of takeovers and amalgamations have led to a
smaller number of companies in the market-place, creating in many
instances a near-monopoly or cartel situation. Customers are viewed as a
captive audience. Banks are an excellent example of this. Their almost
uniform terms for any loan bear this out.
Companies are forcing redundancy upon employees as a result of
automation, takeovers, and cost-cutting exercises. I can think of no
instance where a company, having made people redundant, has then cut the
cost of its product to the public. Companies are clearly abandoning
their responsibilities to employees by forcing these redundancies to cut
overheads and boost short-term profits at a time when alternative
employment prospects are bleak.
The shareholders are the only group to do well in recent times,
largely because, unlike customers and employees, they have some clout --
they can sell their shares if not satisfied with the company's
performance. Companies are now driven to maximise profits in order to
pay greater dividends than ever before and boost share values.
These changes in emphasis amount quite simply to corporate greed, the
effects of which extend far beyond a few more statistics like Rick
Powell.
This proliferation of unemployment is undermining the stability of our
society. There are people who are unemployed and see no hope for the
future. Many turn to crime, taking the view that if they are caught and
fined or sent to prison, they are no worse off than at present.
I cannot pretend that there is an easy answer to unemployment and its
attendant problems. However, part of the answer surely lies in
redressing the balance between customers, employees, and shareholders.

STEPHEN Hendry confirmed his status as snooker's No.1 player when he
defeated Nigel Bond 18-9 to take the Embassy World Championship in
Sheffield yesterday.
The victory earned Hendry a total of #353,000 -- the #190,000 top
prize, #147,000 for his maximum 147 against Jimmy White, the
highest-break prize of #16,000 -- and a Ferrari from his sponsors, team
SweaterShop.
More importantly for Hendry, though, it was his fourth successive win
at Sheffield and his fifth in six years, both records.
And so, too, was his twentieth successive match victory at the
Crucible, along with 12 centuries in a tournament -- the last clearance
of 103 clinching the match and taking his career total to 294.
Afterwards, Hendry was still happy to be the man to beat. He said:
''There are a lot of players who have come through, but I am still No.1
and world champion.
''I certainly don't produce the form through the season that I deliver
here, but I'm charged up whenever I come back to Sheffield.
''Someone would have to play unbelievable snooker to beat me. But as
for who might in the future, I don't care.
''I don't pay attention to anyone else. There are great players, but I
don't think about who is ready to take over from me yet.''
As soon as the 26-year-old Scot had defeated Jimmy White in Friday's
semi, it wasn't so much a case if Hendry would win, but what the margin
would be.
The bookies offered unbackable odds of 12-1 on Hendry once again
lifting the silverware.
Even when Bond led 4-3 after the first session and again at 5-4,
Hendry was only biding his time before launching his grand attack.
When the defending champion turned on the kind of performance that
only he seems capable of at the Crucible, his SweaterShop stablemate was
reduced to the role of spectator.
The Scot reeled off seven frames on the trot with runs of 60, 81, 70,
66, 124, 60, and 84 to take an 11-5 overnight lead.
Bond resumed yesterday knowing that he needed at least three frames to
avoid the ignominy of defeat with a session to spare in the most
prestigious final in snooker, and the 29-year-old from Darley Dale
achieved that thanks to knocks of 52, 45, and 49.
But the remaining frames were pocketed by Hendry, leaving the
title-holder at 16-8 just two frames from collecting the famous old
trophy yet again.
A clearance of 92 left the wonder Scot one short, only for Bond to
make a clearance of 111 to make the score 17-9.
The Midlander was in first again in what was to prove to be the
decisive frame, but he missed a black into the corner. One of Hendry's
hallmarks is that he severely punishes mistakes and he cleared up with
103, even managing a smile when he got a terrible kick on the final
blue.

TWO wrongs do not make a right, and a whole galaxy of economists
shouting for interest-rate increases does not make it logical or
necessary.
Even the celebrated Milton Friedman admitted that raising the price of
borrowed money was inflationary.
What price-setters need, to sharpen their pencils in a competitive
environment, is a promise of reducing, not rising costs. And one way to
achieve this in the present context would be a generous infusion of
Government-created (not borrowed) money to ease the crippling rates
burden, currently in flux with the new valuations.
Steering the economy by means of interest rates is a malaise
engendered by America's deregulation of finance in 1980. It destroyed
our prosperity in 1988, and then again in 1992 until we got out of the
ERM.
It will destroy it again if wiser counsels do not prevail. When will
the public get mad enough to demand better answers?

CONGRATULATIONS to Andy Wightman on his Herald Essay (April 15) on the
resurgence of the land question in Scotland, the ''increasingly
ephemeral treatment'' of which by the media is the best indication of
its potentially explosive nature.
My only criticism of his essay is that he over-concentrates on rural
land ownership when in fact the far higher value of urban sites makes
these much more important as possible sources of revenue. Indeed, land
reform will only quicken the pulse of the urban electorate when it
becomes equated with the taxation of land values as a replacement for
punitive taxes such as PAYE or VAT.
Since, however, our political parties' leaders are over-influenced by
the most powerful landowners of all, the multinationals, they will not
touch such a policy with a barge-pole until pressure from the grassroots
becomes irresistible.

A POLITICAL revolution may be taking place in at least one section of
Scottish farming.
At one time the local Tory candidate might have taken for granted that
he would get the farming vote. That is unlikely to be the case among
those farmers who happen to be British Coal tenants and who are
currently trying to negotiate the purchase of their farms.
As if things were not bad enough for the Tories in Scotland they have
managed to upset this farming group sufficiently to inspire talk of
setting out on a campaign to embarrass the Government and to expose them
as acting unfairly towards the tenant farmers.
French-style direct action was suggested at a meeting in Fife last
week. One of the group's leaders appeared intent on hitching up a
muck-spreader and setting off for the Perth offices of Bell-Ingram, the
land agents who have the misfortune to be acting for British Coal in
this sell-off.
As an alternative he was prepared to stage a sit-in until he got
satisfactory answers to pertinent questions.
There was some doubt in the minds of his fellow tenants as to the
precise benefits to be achieved from such actions. The matter was
quickly settled, however, by a female voice (very authoritative) from
the back of the hall which said simply: ''He's not going.''
British Coal, the Department of Trade and Industry and Bell-Ingram
might wish that they could find as quick a solution to any aspect of
this affair.
The situation is that British Coal wishes to dispose of the farms it
owns throughout the UK. Initially the plan was to sell in large lots.
Only an outcry from the farming community, backed up by their MPs, won
the concession that sitting tenants would be given an opportunity to
purchase.
However, the prices being demanded are regarded by the tenants as
being beyond their means. There has been great reluctance to discuss
with the tenants how valuations have been arrived at, making it very
difficult for them to challenge the calculations.
Alistair Campbell, an agricultural consultant and valuer who is
advising some of the tenants, said: ''All they know is that the
discounted price is still too high for them to borrow money to buy their
farm and continue in business. No bank is willing to lend the sums
required to pay British Coal the prices it is demanding.''
One tenant told the meeting of an open market valuation of #431,000 --
reduced to an asking price of #280,000 after discounts -- but still too
high, he argued, in the light of improvements to both house and farm
which had been carried out at his expense during a tenancy of more than
20 years.
The depth of feeling over the issue has been intensified by the
difficulty in getting straight answers to honest questions not only from
British Coal and their agents but even from Government ministers.
The National Farmers' Union of Scotland tried to take the matter up
with the president of the Board of Trade, Michael Heseltine, but found
that it is being treated no better than the tenant farmers -- its letter
has not so far been deemed worthy of a reply.
NFUS president John Ross has warned that it will be regarded as
scandalous if British Coal refuses to negotiate a price with a sitting
tenant and then goes on to sell to a third party at a lower price than
the tenant was prepared to pay.
The price offered by any third party would normally be expected to be
less because the purchaser would be inheriting a sitting tenant. There
are fears, however, that some of the likely purchasers would soon be
devising ways of ridding themselves of tenants.
The way forward for the farmers is now opening up on two fronts. All
Scottish MPs are to receive briefing material and a letter from the
tenants group pointing out that despite Parliament's expressed desire
that the system should work in a fair and reasonable way for the tenant
farmers this is not being achieved.
An assurance is being sought that no sale will take place to a third
party at a price lower than a tenant was willing to pay. MPs will also
be asked to lend their support to forcing British Coal to discuss the
basis upon which it has calculated valuations for individual farms.
A possible second front is legal action -- seeking an interim
interdict in the Court of Session to prevent any sale to a third party
at a lower price. That could cost #20,000, lawyer John Dale warned, but
there appeared to be a feeling that #500 a head would be a worthwhile
investment to protect tenants' livelihoods.
Meanwhile the tenants find themselves engaged in a game of poker with
very high stakes. Technically they have 28 days in which to accept the
price demanded by British Coal. Counter-offers, based on the tenants'
idea of a fair prices will not be entertained.
The only way to ''stop the clock'' would appear to be to raise queries
about how the valuation has been arrived at. With the minimum of
information to hand on how the calculation has been made they find it
difficult to pick holes in the methodology.
Later this month Department of Trade and Industry ministers will face
a number of pointed questions in the House. These, at least, will have
to be answered. There is no doubt in the minds of many of those directly
involved that the British Coal game plan all along has been to sell to
institutional buyers.
There is one major ally on the side of the 50 or so Scottish tenants.
That is Sir David Naish, president of the English NFU. He is a British
Coal tenant -- and he wants to buy his farm.

MESSRS McKinley and Barbour are to be congratulated on their recent
letters about sub-contractors in the construction industry.
All too frequently the problems highlighted by them result in the
appointment of an insolvency practitioner. The time then taken to
complete the task is often excessive while the fees charged are in some
cases surplus to requirements.
Has the position not been reached when the remuneration of the
insolvency practitioner should be evaluated on a percentage basis of
creditors' claims with the facility to elevate the percentage when the
task is completed within an agreed time-scale or to reduce it when it is
not?

THE prejudice against foxes is less statistically valid in terms of
lambs rather than rabbits, which outnumber lambs all year through and
constitute a smaller, more vulnerable prey (April 22).
If, further, killing foxes makes no difference to lambing success, it
does make a greater difference to the populace of rabbits.
Both rabbits and foxes can be more humanely shot than hunted, and
lambs transported abroad but only after less cruel slaughter in home
abattoirs.

I SUSPECT I was not the only one with whom Anne Simpson's essay struck
a cord (Newsview, April 24).
It is easily forgotten amidst the animal rights hysteria that the vast
majority of farmers in Britain resemble John Scott of Balkissock;
conscientous, hard working individuals who retain the highest respect
for the land and the livestock that sustains both themselves and their
families.
Like Mr Scott, I am a farmer's son, and have found the recent fracas
deeply disturbing. I find it impossible to square the hysterical
rantings of the welfare protesters with my own experience of living and
working in rural Scotland.
Anne Simpson is to be congratulated for displaying a level of
perceptiveness and common sense so clearly lacking from the mob over
this issue.

I FIND it utterly indefensible that bloodsports will be an integral
part of the management of Mar Estate (April 27).
This lottery-funded purchase was only made possible by public money
and yet the vast majority of the British people oppose the killing of
animals for fun, in the sick name of ''sport''.
This was a golden opportunity to establish an enlightened,
progressive, world-renowned area of real beauty and genuine
conservation. Instead of wealthy ''sportsmen'' enjoying their perverse
pleasures in yet another personal little playground, Mar Lodge could
have been turned into an international conference centre for the world's
conservation organisations.
People would have have had their spirits gloriously uplifted to know
that the destruction of wildlife by moronic bloodsporters would not be
tolerated in this Scottish paradise.
Instead, the Scottish National Trust has jettisoned all its fine
principles, and the Scottish people, and Scottish wildlife, have been
horribly betrayed, yet again.

CLAUSE 4 is dead and gone and is unlikely to surface as an issue
again. This is a relief, for there are greater issues to discuss and, in
any case, there was always the suspicion of an element of the bogus in
the posturing of those who sought to defend it. Behind the rhetoric
there lurked an often-unspoken feeling that the issue could be used as a
handy weapon with which to belabour the modernisers, and Mr Blair in
particular. The Labour leader's victory in the Clause 4 debate is not a
triumph, as some are keen to depict it, but a solid, workmanlike piece
of political persuasion. The whole affair has been an illustration of
his determination to press his own views, but without that determination
an aspiring politician would be lost. Yet Mr Blair now faces the
difficult part, with perhaps two years to go until the General Election
and his opponents hurt, but in no mood to accept defeat.
In the coming months Mr Blair will be under increasing pressure to
detail the policies which a Labour Government would follow. This is only
fair, and we have been among those demanding more facts and less
rhetoric. Nevertheless the Labour leader is in a difficult position. He
can say, as he did yesterday, that he would not rule out a 50p in the
pound top rate of income tax, but just in case this frightens the
middle-earners whose support he seeks, this has to be accompanied by
informed analysis by others which defines those liable to face that tax
rate as those earning at least #80,000 to #100,000 a year. This may
defuse the worries of all but a tiny minority, but it is not a
comfortable way to approach an election. It is obvious that the Tories
will fasten on to his inability to swop specifics; any government always
has an advantage in this area. Somehow Mr Blair and his colleagues must
find a way to expand on their policies without leaving a trail of
hostages to fortune.
Mr Major, obviously enough, has his own difficulties. The local
elections in England and Wales this week will be painful; a rise in
interest rates might well be necessary. On the economy the Tories do
deserve sympathy. The nature of the revival, led by exports, makes
inflation at home a real danger. It can be controlled, but only at a
political price. On the conduct of politics, Mr Major deserves less
credit. His attacks on Mr Blair over the weekend were childish. For
pungent politics of an altogether more sophisticated sort it was
necessary to turn to Mr Heseltine (though not to his PPS, the hapless Mr
Ottaway). The disparity in leadership qualities among the Tories is
becoming more, rather than less, noticeable.

AILEEN LITTLE charts the progress of a couple planning to make a
200-mile Atlantic crossing in a 22-foot kayak
KAREN and Dan Trotter of North Queensferry are expecting a happy
event. ''It's a very emotional thing, very tense,'' comments 32-year-old
Karen Trotter through clenched teeth.
But the birth in question -- scheduled to take place in a workshop
donated by East Ness Marine Development -- will not produce offspring of
the human variety. When deck and hull are finally eased from the moulds
in which they have been encased, the Trotters will see their new
fibreglass double kayak which began construction at New Year. It is the
vessel in which they aim, next month, to be the first kayakists in
modern history to paddle from Shetland to the Faro Islands. ''At 22
feet, it's certainly the biggest kayak we know of. We've to commission
someone to make an extra large rudder blade,'' said Karen Trotter.
The boat first took shape in Dumfries, hometown of 72-year-old kayak
builder Chris Newell. He was charged with the task of designing a craft
spacious enough for Dan Trotter's six-foot four-inch frame to lie down
inside and sleep during the 60-hour, 200-mile North Atlantic crossing.
Now Newell is overseeing the final stages of the long, creative process
within sight of the Forth, where the kayak will soon be launched. ''Dan
and I are absolutely terrified -- Chris is keeping us calm. We'll have a
secret launch first, then a launch party with lots of champagne,''
explained Karen Trotter.
Although the Faroese trip will be the first time the couple have tried
sleeping on board, they are already veteran kayak adventurers. Following
their wedding in 1990 (in kayaks on the Forth) they sold their flats,
gave up jobs (the Trotters met at Aberdeen University where she studied
Psychology and he Law) and committed themselves full time to a new life.
They have dodged salt water crocodiles and man-eating sharks on a
600-mile circumnavigation of the Great Barrier Reef, survived storms and
a smashed kayak on a 1000-mile trip round Tasmania, and endured clouds
of sandflies on a four-month trip around the rainforests of New
Zealand's south island. This was followed by 1000 nautical miles of
paddling from Seattle to Alaska, cruising with killer whales and riding
tidal rapids. They have also weathered terrible rows -- but Dan Trotter
says these are short lived: ''Our expeditions bring us so close we end
up thinking and speaking as one.''
The next frontier, though nearer home, presents a new set of
difficulties. Around May 21 the couple plan to base themselves in John
O'Groats, allowing a month to sort out teething problems before heading
for Shetland in time for the favourable conditions of the summer
solstice.
The Trotters are adept at foraging for sea lettuce and shellfish. They
are busy working out how to reply to calls of nature aboard a kayak and
the problem of how to balance out the ballast on board. Dan Trotter is
twice his wife's weight and so provisions and equipment will need to be
judiciously packed.
It's all a far cry from the swimming pool where the former slalom
champion, coached his partner in paddling technique. Their priorities
have changed since then. ''Philosophically we're very weird,'' says
Karen Trotter. ''We've gone through hunger states, hunting and
gathering. You learn what it means to be human. Away from TVs and
three-piece suites, we feel we find sanity.''
During periods on shore, she lectures part time at Queen Margaret
College, Edinburgh; they both lecture on past expeditions, making
impassioned pleas about de-forestation, overfishing, and the
introduction of non-native species.
Dan confesses homecomings can be tricky. ''You spend the first two
days enjoying using toilet paper and having baths, then you get itchy
feet.'' Using a kayak to bring home trolley loads of shopping from the
supermarket in South Queensferry helps allay the wanderlust.
The Trotters believe their voyage to the 18-island Faroese archipelago
is timely. It is 50 years since British troops left the islands and
since Churchill (Karen has been awarded a Churchill Travelling
Fellowship for the trip) pledged to remember the island fishermen's
sacrifice in keeping Britain supplied with fish during the last war.
''We'd like to re-establish a link of friendship,'' says Dan Trotter.
* The Trotters are giving a public lecture about their trip to Alaska
on Wednesday at the Appleton Tower, George Square, University of
Edinburgh. The talk begins at 7pm; tickets (#3) at the door or from
Tiso's in Edinburgh.

THE letter from Duncan M MacDonald epitomises the faulty logic of all
those advocating a return to the barbaric practices of putting people to
death for murder (April 22). He seems to be saying that as long as the
majority of people advocate it, it is right for the state to commit
judicial murder.
Apart from the fact that in the past 11 and 12-year-olds were hanged
for quite trivial offences, and that in recent years the existence of
the death penalty would have meant that many innocent people would have
been hanged for murders they did not commit, can he not see the crudity
of a democratic mandate as the sole arbiter?
If Mr MacDonald's argument is followed through, and the democratic
imperative obeyed, there is nothing to prevent the popular will from
executing anyone. If I happen to dislike red-headed men and can persuade
enough people to support me, then we can set about executing red-headed
men. It is the democratic will. The same might apply to Catholics, Jews,
or people called MacDonald.
If the state returns to the practice of judicial murder, it is no
better than the murderer himself. The fact that the majority want it
does not alter the moral imperatives involved one whit. Unless the
proponents of a return to the grisly days of the rope can come up with a
better moral argument they should ''haud their wheesht''.
The Americans are barbaric not because the population advocates
judicial murder, but because cowardly and unprincipled legislators cave
in to their demands. On the eve of his re-election to his previous post
of governorship, Mr Clinton allowed a young mentally handicapped man to
go to his death by refusing him a pardon. His campaign manager
reportedly described it as Clinton's High Noon.
I have many reservations about our current system of government.
However, one thing I am eternally grateful for is that unlike America,
but like every other so-called ''advanced'' country, we do not take
people out in the grey light of dawn, put a rope round their neck and
hang them till they are dead.

THE belief is growing that embattled jewellery retailer Signet will
fight off the break-up attempt by US fund managers and Brian Myerson and
Julian Treager's UK Active Value Fund.
Some Preference shareholders have called an extraordinary meeting for
this Friday to pass a resolution demanding the board, led by James
McAdam, should find purchasers for both the UK and the US businesses.
These include H Samuel and Ernest Jones which is in the sights of
Leicester-based Goldsmiths and for the Sterling, formerly Zales,
operations in the US.
The UK Active Value Fund was highly supportive of Glasgow-based
property group City Site Estates when Scottish Amicable's property
director, David Hunter, was considering mounting a bid backed by Paribas
last September.
Signet is burdened with #350m of bank debt and owes Preference
shareholders #100m in unpaid dividends.
The Preference shareholders claim that a break-up of the former
Ratners could raise more than #800m. But Mr McAdam is urging
shareholders to vote against the proposal, saying that the resolution is
fundamentally flawed and uncommercial.
He added that it is asking the directors to put the group's businesses
in what amounts to an eight-week public fire sale.
Fund managers, including Schroders, Barings and Robert Fleming, are
believed to support Mr McAdam's views that the jewellery group's profits
will be restored over time.
In a letter to shareholders, Mr McAdam said: ''In the year to January
1992, pre-tax losses of #122m were recorded. Since then, the group has
moved from that precarious position to the directors' latest estimate of
a profit before tax of #8m for the year to January 1995.''
A sale of the businesses would seriously damage confidence causing
uncertainty for lenders, suppliers and staff and that the main
beneficiaries would be the group's competitors, he added.

THE self-reliance being forced upon Scotland's smaller arts companies
by the shortcomings of this year's Mayfest brochure may prove a useful
education. The lobbying skills being honed on Scotland's arts
journalists to ensure people are aware of their festival productions
will surely find further purpose when the scrabbling for local
government finance begins in earnest. Whatever we of the Fourth Estate
may think, column inches are no substitute for pounds sterling. The
surprise -- and fear -- is that the battle for arts cash from the new
unitary authorities has not already begun.
While it is true that until last month's elections and the subsequent
appointments of the most senior officers of the new unitary authorities
it would have been guesswork as to whom to lobby, the comparative
silence from some sectors of the arts over the whole matter of local
government reorganisation has been baffling. While every grant award of
the Scottish Arts Council is greeted with predictable outcries of
disgust or, occasionally, approval, and the level of private-sector
sponsorship is closely scrutinised and prizes awarded, local authority
support -- which underpins so much of the artisic life of Scotland --
has rarely been the subject of debate, except where it has been to
compare the generosity of one area with the parsimony of another.
Perhaps artists are embarrassed to bring up the subject while
questions still loom large over fundamental issues like the education of
our children, but we doubt it. Not only would such modesty be
uncharacteristic, but arts provision in this country is so bound up with
education that it is folly if attention is not being properly drawn to
those links. Often it is the most effective parts of the education
system that make the best use of the opportunities to work with artists,
to draw out more difficult young people and give wider opportunities of
expression for the gifted. Yet all the evidence is that arts
organisations have been slow to appreciate the extent to which local
authority reform is a threat: some of them must have short memories, or
they would recall that the division of responsibilities after the
two-tier system was introduced in 1974 took a long time to sort out. The
new unitary authorities will similarly not make the arts a priority by
instinct -- there is a lot of lobbying to be done.

TWO groups of golfers are being tested for Legionnaire's disease after
one of their number was struck down with the virus.
Thirty-seven Scots golfers, who stayed at the Hotel Oasis in Magaluf,
have been asked to supply blood and urine samples to doctors at
Ninewells Hospital, Dundee.
The men travelled to the Majorcan resort earlier this month. On their
return, Mr Howard Waldner, the deputy chief executive of Ninewells
Hospital who was on the trip, was taken ill.
He was hospitalised and legionella was diagnosed. He has been released
from hospital but is still recovering from the illness.
Three other golfers who went on the week-long holiday organised by the
Taybridge Bar, Perth Road, Dundee, were also taken ill.
All 17 golfers are being tested and, as a precaution, 20 golfers from
the Fort Bar, Broughty Ferry, Dundee, who stayed at the same hotel, are
undergoing the tests.
A spokesman for Tayside Health Board confirmed: ''We are testing two
groups which returned from Spain for chest symptoms. We are carrying out
further tests for the legionella virus.''

THERE can be few possessions that give a woman more confidence than a
large, drop-dead diamond. In America, where a wife's social standing is
still largely determined by her husband's bank balance, they are not
just a public declaration of his affection, but a visible sign of his
disposable income. In her heyday, Mrs Caroline Astor wore so many large
diamonds that she had to sit bolt upright, finding it too painful to
lean against anything, all of which was merely to out-glitter her rival,
Mrs Potter Palmer, who owned the giant Hope Diamond, and the Star of the
East, and wore them both at the same time.
Aware of modern hostility to conspicuous wealth, the diamond trade
remains cautious about large gems, and awaits with keen interest the
auction in Geneva next month of a perfect, pear-shaped gem weighing
100.1 carats -- only eight carats smaller than the koh-i-noor in the
Crown Jewels. One of the diamond's attractions, apart from an estimate
of #8m, is that it is so far unnamed, which gives its owner a passport
to immortality, like the giant stone named after Sir Thomas Cullinan,
who discovered the Premier Mine in Pretoria.
The British attitude to large diamonds has traditionally been to
suggest that they are in bad taste, although it can sometimes backfire,
as when Princess Margaret suggested to Elizabeth Taylor that her
fabulous engagement ring, a present from Richard Burton, might be a
little vulgar. The film star persuaded Princess Margaret to try it on
her own finger. ''There, it's not vulgar at all now, is it?'' she said.
Alas, not even Scottish women have been immune to jealousy about
diamonds. Mrs Ronnie (Maggie) Greville, heiress of the McEwan brewery
empire -- she remarked that she would rather be a beeress than a peeress
-- hated entertaining guests whose jewels were larger than her own.
After dinner one evening, when a very rich and famous American lady
announced that the principal diamond in her necklace had fallen to the
floor, everyone dropped to their hands and knees. ''Perhaps this might
be of assistance,'' said Maggie to a footman, handing him a large
magnifying glass.

AFTER I wrote my last epistle we had three mornings of snow on the
trot, and that put us further behind with the spraying.
The nitrogen was on but not the chemicals. We had rammed down the
accelerator but found that we had no brake. I am up to date now but I
fear I am well on the way to a great green crop that will collapse if we
get rain.
Mossie phones every day asking if the barley has gone flat yet and if
going to watch Aberdeen and Celtic was really more important than
looking after the crops.
If I do get into trouble then I will not be alone for the husbandry
part of farming in the North-east is far behind and out of kilter. It is
looking well at the moment, but it is growing too fast and so is the
disease. We could need low-cutting bars at harvest this year.
Of course, some of the malting barley men may yet be saved such
embarrassment for their crops cannot go flat if they stay in the bag.
Big Hamish has half of his crop in at the Baronial castle by the sea
and we're trying to persuade him to put in rape in the rest. After all,
it doesn't matter how late you are you still get the big rape subsidy.
The livestock job isn't looking too bright either with the grass so
very slow and straw up another #3 on Friday. To think I sold for a mere
#14.60 a bale.
I'm still holding half my cows inside because, even at one cow to the
acre, there is hardly anything for them outside.
I was tempted to try to hold on to my last year's calves until the
grass really gets going but on Friday I weakened and put 15 heifers to
Thainstone.
You may recall that my heifer sale last year was a pantomine and a
disaster. Everything went wrong. The float arrived far too early. After
chasing them around the place and shaking tonnes of liveweight off them
we just made it in time, only for the sale to run so far behind that
they had another four hours to stand. When they finally came into the
ring it was after six. They were dehydrated and there were only two
bidders left.
I was anxious that there would be no such cock-ups this time. The
float was due at 11am so I had plenty of time to get them ready. That
meant getting them from their court down to the loading bank. That is
where things have gone wrong from time to time, even in the days when
there were staff about the place.
To make quite sure that all the weak links were reinforced and that I
wouldn't have to rely at all on the goodwill of the stock, I had seven
extra gates, the digger, the old Cavalier and the tractor with the
sprayer tied together to make an unambiguous corridor to the loading
bank.
It worked!
The trouble only started when the float arrived. You would have
thought the animal rights people had been at the heifers telling them
about the cruelty involved in transporting of calves. They just blank
refused to enter the float.
We twisted their tails, poked them, and beat them but not enough. We
took them back to their pen a dozen times to see if a fresh start would
get them going but to no avail. We put straw down on the loading bank
and up the taildoor and into the float so that it looked like one big
pen but no.
It was as though there was a door which only the heifers could see and
it was shut. I've seen it like that when there have been pigs in the
float but that was not the case this time.
Eventually we haltered one calf, walking her in. Then, the invisible
door having been opened, they all marched in as if it were the most
natural thing in the world.
All was well. We made the sale in time, the heifers looked good in the
ring and sold well. Indeed my average was up #76 per head at #466. That
was because they were much heavier this year at 384 kilos compared with
300 in 1994.
That huge difference can't all be down to the bad handling of last
year's sale. In fact, at least threequarters of it is good news for our
feeding regime. This year they were wintered on straw and 7lb of cake,
while in 1994 they got silage and about 4lb.
Of course, they did look a bit polished. What the graziers are really
looking for is cattle that are desperate to get out to the grass.
Because they haven't been well done by inside, they can offer
compensatory growth. So my average price per kilo was down from 129p to
119p.
And I had a bonus. The first five were brought by Neil Barclay (yes,
Harry's son at HRM) and I waved acknowledgment from the box. He waved
back with a little gesture which suggested a luckpenny.
I knew he was at least half-joking for the tradition of giving the
buyer a small part of his bid back in cash has all but died out in the
North-east. But when he bought the next five I resolved to give him a
tenner. After the sale I made my way to pay but Neil was gone.
Another tenner saved and 23 of the heifers' big brothers to go next
Friday. Brace yourself, banker.
If you're going to the Ayr Show I might see you. I will be on the
Harbro stand for the two days with nothing more to do than chat and sign
copies of the books of Farmer's Diary.

SOME ministers are privately questioning if the traditional pattern of
worship centred on the Bible being read and expounded in the sermon is
sufficient for the future, a report out today claims.
However, the Church of Scotland's Panel on Worship warns the use of
the main Sunday worship as ''a laboratory for new worship ideas'' was
detrimental to both congregation and minister.
The panel, in its report to the General Assembly, encourages churches
who want to develop their patterns of worship to use alternative
services where ''innovative material can be sampled''.
The report maintains all the good preaching in the world will not
fulfil the desires of those who approached public worship with ''a
pick-and-mix mentality''.
Those who failed to get their ''personal batteries charged'' either
moved to another church congregation or stopped attending, unaware they
were ''exhibiting in their souls that kind of rampant consumerism they
might criticise in the national economy''.
The report, which says prayer has recently been seen as an optional
extra by people unwilling or unable to pray because of pressures of
time, reveals some church members want all-age worship, some insist on
20 minutes of sermon, while others ask for ''visual aids, liturgical
dance, and dialogue with the congregation''.
The minister groans under the weight of such demands, it states.
''Several ministers. . . wonder whether the traditional pattern of
reformed worship centred on the Bible and expounded in the sermon is
sufficient for the future.''

Britain's best-known 'spymaster' claims he has no sources in the world
of intelligence but simply bases his tales on his experiences and then
makes up the rest of the details. And, says Douglas Thompson, he does it
so convincingly it's very hard not to believe him
At the moment I'm very happy without him. Smiley's in retirement now
and we barely speak
There was an extraordinary bitterness at the centre of him . . . I
stole his appearance and his manners
''The avenger stole upon the citadel and destroyed it from within'' .
. . John Le Carre on Kim Philby.
THE ironic is the clarity of the obvious about John le Carre; he has
much in common with his characters. No, not just his shadowy Secret
Service days but also his multiple personalities. He is the reclusive
millionaire writer stalking the yellow gorse-flecked Corniche hillsides
or roaring around the narrow rock-walled lanes in his Mercedes jeep.
Another day, he is a social dazzler on the Manhattan cocktail circuit,
affable and amusing.
Or in some far-flung foreign correspondents' club joshing with the
boys, buying generous rounds of drinks, but always listening to the
details of the territory, watching how the shadows fall and hearing how
the bombs did. He is, said one of the Hong Kong hands, ''like an ant
burying things away for future use''.
Or in a room at his patchwork Cornwall home -- three cottages and a
barn literally knocked into shape -- which has a narrow window
overlooking the cliffs. It allows him to watch the Atlantic surf crash
and sometimes flicker hauntingly in a sea fog: a grey area blurred --
like the mortal dilemmas which corner his characters -- to all but the
most penetrating eyes.
David Cornwell, 64 this year, creator of the le Carre mask and
responsible for some of this century's best and most admired novels,
carries the careless confidence of the British upper class. But that's
another disguise. He calls himself ''fake gentry''. His father Ron, whom
he exorcised with The Perfect Spy, was a superstar con man, a dreamer
and convicted swindler, an Arthur Daley of hugely exotic proportions,
and his son grew up in one secret world only to work in another.
He is witty and clever and robust, the grey hair as neat as his
delivery. He discloses himself the way his books do, in controlled
stages and never entirely. He is disarming and identifies himself as an
upstart deceiver, a parvenu ''advancing into British society with an
undefended back''. It has made him an expert interpreter of the amoral,
desperate, and duplicitous world in which he deals.
With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the thawing of the Cold War and
the spymasters his novel breed were thought of as exhibits for Jurassic
Park. David Cornwell didn't. He rapidly proved it with Russia House, The
Night Manager, and now with Our Game, which introduces a rich cast of
characters involved in a global people-and-paper chase.
Our Game is narrated by Tim ''Timbo'' Cranmer, former spook and now an
early retired wine-grower, who from the moment the novel opens finds
himself immersed in love and conspiracy triangles which take on grander
geometric proportions as the pages turn.
Like The Night Manager, his fourteenth novel revolves around those who
have left or been forced out of the secret world only to be drawn back
into the endless game. It's all here. The ''tradecraft'', the ''joes'',
the espionage trivia of money laundering and letter drops, which have
become part of the general vocabulary through the works involving George
Smiley, and continued with a plot involving millions in stolen Russian
gold, terrorists, and a renegade spy much in the vein of The Honourable
Schoolboy.
Even le Carre devotees have sometimes complained that they wished he
would get on with his tales more swiftly. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy
began a shelf of books which abandoned action for atmospherics. The
plots were as brilliantly inventive as ever but delivered in
ambiguities. When would he return to the edge-of-the-pillow thrills of
The Spy Who Came in from the Cold?
The mood shifted with The Russia House. He had driven himself with The
Perfect Spy, his most autobiographical novel. Then, he says, he was
willing to enjoy writing. And in The Russia House it showed. With The
Night Manager the intrigue was more than matched by the thrills and
spills and the creation of a very apparent and very evil gun-dealing bad
guy.
Our Game keeps up the pace of commanding suspense. The betrayal and
the guilt and disillusionment, the le Carre ''tradecraft'', are there
but this is more a hunt for maggots than moles.
Global politics did not kill off his craft but dramatically enlivened
it. He never believed otherwise. ''The spy story was always certain to
find another identity according to the new winds. After all, the spy
story existed in Somerset Maugham and Joseph Conrad long before the Cold
War. To imagine that writers have to freeze a political situation to
function is simply to discredit the trade.
''The early period of the Cold War had James Bond as its literary
champion and that was an absolute travesty of reality -- it was an
absurdity and a vulgarity. What it created was a great appetite for a
countermarket that I and others supplied. It may have broken Tom
Clancy's begging bowl for a while but I don't write that sort of book.
''I have always written about people caught in an endless ideological
gridlock. The future is mine to play with -- a whole new realm of
imaginative speculation has opened up over the past couple of years.
''I just imagine what goes in the world of intelligence. I have no
sources -- I wouldn't lie. I know nothing. But it's like this. If a
veteran journalist gave up his work tomorrow even 20 years from now he
could pick up a magazine or newspaper and sense instantly the way the
paper is structured and why stories are handled in a certain way.
''So, when I see something occur in the world of intelligence I get a
kind of imaginative read-out, or what probably happened, and quite
likely it's right. It has always been my concern not to be authentic but
to be credible, to use the deep background I have from the years I spent
in intelligence work to present premises that are useful to my stories
and that I knew were rooted in experience.
''It's terribly easy to imagine an operational context when you've
done a few operations.
''Of course, what I don't know I just make up.''
Very credibly. Remember this man deals in duplicity.
His first contact with the secret world is believed to be when he was
17 and studying German language and literature at Bern University in
Switzerland. Two years later he was commissioned in the Intelligence
Corps after being drafted. He went to Austria in 1952. He saw many shady
people, interrogated refugees muddling into Austria from Hungary and
Czechoslovakia. His job was to resettle the good guys, spot the
''baddies'' and potential spies. He dealt with some ''low-key'' agents
in the Soviet Union. He recalls: ''I was shocked to find out how quickly
we had moved from a hot war to a cold one. It was as if the gun barrels
had simply been turned in another direction.''
David Cornwell also turned. Back in Britain he continued his German
studies at Oxford. He married, received a First Class honours degree and
a teaching job at Eton.
The pay was was not good and he grew tired of the school routine. He
got into the Foreign Office and became a diplomat. There is a two-year
gap between his FO examination and his first posting to Bonn. Training?
A safe house? Along with the authorities he will not say where the 24
months went.
Germany changed his life. In August 1961, when the Berlin Wall began
to go up, he was reporting on developments to The Office and helping
East German contacts escape Berlin's Soviet sector before it was too
late.
He had already had two thrillers published, Call For The Dead and A
Murder of Quality, which both featured George Smiley. As a diplomat he
could not use his own name and invented John le Carre -- ''John the
Square'' -- saying it was ''coldbloodedly constructed in three parts to
make it mysterious''. He was wondering about his next book. The Wall
provided it: ''I thought I'd make the wall the beginning and the end of
the story.''
It was quite a story and titled, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold.
His drained, desperately burned-out spy, Alec Leamas -- Richard Burton
on his best form in the film adaptation -- was created from his memory
of a man he had seen at Heathrow airport. ''He had a pitted face, short,
stubby hair, and short fingers. He was someone who had been travelled to
death. There was an extraordinary bitterness at the centre of him and I
stole his appearance and his manners.''
Smiley was also there, in an important but cameo appearance, holding
out his hand to the double-crossed Leamas who disdains it and dies at
the foot of the Berlin Wall.
This was not 007 material. The critics went wild. David Cornwell, who
enjoys the grape (claret) and barley (malt) left the FO. He was now a
full-time writer. He wrote The Looking Glass War, but it was not a big
seller. However, his bank balance was from the film rights to ''Spy''
and its follow-up. He then wrote the disastrous and often unreadable The
Naive and Sentimental Lover, which sent him back to spying which is what
he remains best at.
His marriage ended (''success and money shone a very bright light
through the cracks'') and he moved on to Tinker, Tailor . . . which was
George Smiley's search for the mole buried in The Circus. It loosely
mirrored Kim Philby's defection in 1963. It was also about destruction
from within.
He remarried in 1972 to Jane Eustace, a former book editor who now
acts as his secretary, manager, and trouble-spotter/shooter. They have a
son, Nicholas, and he is also close to his three sons from his first
marriage.
He is enormously wealthy. Most the books have been filmed with Alec
Guinness's unflappable turn as Smiley in the BBC's Tinker, Tailor and
Smiley's People.
For Smiley fans, Guinness was not good for them. His creator believed
Sir Alec was so masterly that future possibilities were exhausted.
''With time I found him a damn nuisance. I didn't enjoy looking at
life through the eyes of such an old and disenchanted person. I found
the limitations of his sex life irritating.''
So Smiley the humanist spy has given way to a younger but still as
able breed. ''Timbo'' Cranmer could well have been one of Smiley's men
and, at 47, he enjoys a lover half his age. He also thrives on ''Our
Game'', as does David Cornwell aka John le Carre.
But Smiley was there at the beginning, a character scribbled in cheap
notebooks by a young diplomat. And he was at The Wall waiting for The
Spy Who Came In From The Cold.
It is difficult to imagine he's not out there somewhere waiting for
his millions of readers. The author says: ''At the moment I'm very happy
without him. He's in retirement and we barely speak.''
But, then, ''Maybe we'll get together later.''

I AM intrigued at the decision to commemorate VE Day with a
''two-minute silence''. VE Day was the end of a campaign, not the end of
the war. Will there be another ''silence'' three months later?
Those who served in the East were ''forgotten'' during the war, and it
would appear when one considers the attention being paid to VE Day, to
the exclusion of VJ Day, that this state of affairs persists to the
present day; many suffered, and died, in the three months after VE Day.
By all means celebrate VE Day, but surely the ''two-minute silence''
should have been retained for the world-wide end of hostilities?

MR ALLAN STEWART'S additional clause for the Criminal Justice
(Scotland) Bill, seeking to allow a Scottish court to sit in a neutral
country, was not accepted by the committee debating it. Labour members
of the committee declined to vote for it.
Mr Stewart, in his visit to Libya, appeared to have obtained the
agreement of the Libyans that their citizens would have been allowed to
attend for trial under Scottish law in a neutral country, while the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office are known to suspect the Libyans of
bluffing.
Who is against a fair trial in a neutral country and why?
Mr Tam Dalyell has made it clear (notably in his adjournment debate
with Mr Hurd) that he does not believe the resolving the Lockerbie
stalemate should be a party political issue. Perhaps those who failed to
support Mr Allan Stewart's clause will explain to the public why they
took this line.

IN your otherwise excellent article on legal aid (April 26) your
reporter has perhaps given a mistaken impression about law centres. It
is neither my belief nor the belief of the Scottish Association of Law
Centres that the forthcoming review of legal aid in Scotland will be
entirely a positive experience.
What I had intended to convey was that the review does indeed present
a threat to the current system for the delivery of justice in Scotland.
A cash-limited system, for example, however dressed up, must be of
serious concern to all those involved in the legal system.
However, while SALC has substantial concerns about the review, we
believe that nevertheless it may provide the important opportunities for
beneficial reforms of the system from the viewpoint of customers of
legal services. Whether such opportunities are presented and seized will
depend on the imagination and foresightedness of the Government and
others concerned with the delivery of justice within the legal system.
I would like to add that Richard Scott, chief executive of the
Scottish Legal Aid Board, appears to be under the impression that law
centres are to be equipped with advice centres and that law centres are
unable to pursue court based solutions. This is very far from the truth.
Law centres thus should not be seen simply as advice centres but
rather as organisations fully able of providing a complete service to
clients ranging from initial advice to complex litigation in the court
of session.

A GAUGE of how strong consumer confidence is will come from a host of
retailers who publish results this week.
There are none reporting today, although Murray Enterprise discloses
its interim results and the biotechnology group Chiroscience announces
its finals.
Tomorrow one of Britain's most famous ''green'' companies, Body Shop,
reports its final results. City analysts will be keen to see whether
sales have been hit by a spell of bad publicity last year.
The company faces increased competition in the UK with the arrival of
the US brand Bath &amp; Body Works being sold through a joint venture with
Next and Christmas trading in the US is thought to have been
disappointing.
Despite this, Body Shop is expected to make pre-tax profits of between
#33m and #34.5m, up from #28.6m previously. The dividend is predicted to
rise to 2.4p from 2p.
Wednesday sees womenswear retailer Country Casuals reporting its
annual results. These are expected to show profits of between #500,000
and #1.5m. The company has been hit by losses in Elvi, its larger
women's brand, and write-offs associated with the disposal of
loss-making Koto, its fashion chain for younger women.
Whitbread, whose interests include Pizza Hut and Travel Inns, also
announces its finals which are expected to show an increase in taxable
profits to around #306m against #234m. Its drinks business, which
includes the Thresher's off-licence chain, is expected to be hit by
cheap beer imports, However, heavy investment is being made in new pubs
and restaurants with the creation of around 700 new jobs in Scotland
alone.
First-quarter results from tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries
are expected to show continued growth in sales of nicotine products to
developing nations. The results are expected to show the benefits of the
#600m acquisition of American Tobacco at the end of last year.
Thursday will reveal interim results from Kwik Save, Britain's biggest
discount food retailer. Continued fierce competition among food
retailers may mean that Kwik Save struggles to match the #65.4m made
previously. David Stoddart of brokers Henderson Crosthwaite thinks that
profitability is under pressure and is forecasting half-yearly profits
of around #60m.

THE decision to sack PC King from his job, for upholding the kind of
justice most of us hold dear, beggars belief, and for his wimp of a boss
to claim he didn't have the right temperament for the job, and to inform
him by internal memo rather than telling him to his face is both
unforgivable and appalling.
It seems to me PC King does have the right temperament for the job.
Surely it's right and proper for any father to protect his family from
all the various types of predators, preying on our society today?
The sad fact is that the Government's claim to be a party of law and
order is seen to be in a total and utter shambles, as the present Home
Secretary, Michael Howard, continues to bury his head in the sand.
The fact is that the ''do-gooders'' who oppose discipline, a
punishment to fit the crime, and even the spectacle of the death penalty
as the ultimate deterrent to serious crime, have won the day!d
The discipline which those of us who served in one of the armed forces
as teenagers had to adhere to never did us any harm, even though we
might not have thought so at the time, and may even have gone some way
to instilling the importance of having some strength of character to
face up to the many complexities of adulthood in later years.
Until we reverse all this ''pussy-footing'' on what is wrong in our
society today, and get each and every issue into its proper perspective
again, the situation is going to continue to deteriorate.

COMPANY doctor Bill Gore returned leading UK diary-maker Charles Letts
to a healthy profit in the year to end-January, writes IAN McCONNELL.
The private company, which is based in Dalkeith, is now firmly focused
on the core activity for which it is best known, having exited from all
of its largely unsuccessful attempts to diversify from its seasonal
diary business.
Mr Gore, who prepared paper group Inveresk for flotation as its
financial director a couple of years ago, said Letts was looking at
possible acquisitions.
Letts posted healthy pre-tax profits of #1.9m, after a loss of
#785,000 in its previous financial year.
Turnover dipped slightly from #23.6m to #22.8m but operating profits
were up 51% at #3.41m.
Lower interest charges and reduced losses from discontinued businesses
also helped the pre-tax position.
Letts, which plans to exploit the marketing benefits which next year's
bicentenary will bring, said the current year had started well in the
UK, North America and other parts of the globe.
Mr Gore, Letts' chief executive, said: ''The turnaround in Letts'
performance has been achieved by a dynamic workforce which understands
the importance of teamwork and is determined to succeed and improve our
position as market leader in the UK.''
Letts, which is expected to seek a Stock Exchange listing at some
point, increased shareholder funds from #4.2m to #5.4m during the year.
The diary-maker is confident of winning further market share in the
UK.
With new management in place in the US and Canada, it believes it is
well placed to increase revenues in those markets.
Mr Gore was brought in two years ago after the company's problems were
highlighted by Sir John Harvey-Jones in his Troubleshooter television
programme.
Around #16m in new funds were secured from the City in December 1993.

THE meeting between the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke,
and the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, on Friday
overshadows the rest of the week when the few official statistics being
released are of limited interest.
The two men are expected to agree on a half-point increase in base
rates to 7.25% in the morning and signal the change to the money markets
in the Bank's noon operations.
With markets in London (and Paris) closed on the following Monday for
VE Day celebrations it would be a risky strategy to defer the
announcement until after the weekend, especially as the outcome of
Thursday's local elections in England and Wales could hit the pound.
Gross domestic product figures last week for the first quarter showed
no sign of the pace of economic activity slowing down. The 0.8% growth
in GDP was well above the trend rate despite evidence of flat industrial
production and weak retail sales.
However, the main pressure for a rise in rates comes from the fall of
over 4% in sterling this year. This is the equivalent of a 1% reduction
in base rates.
Both the Chancellor and the Governor made it clear in the minutes of
the March 8 meeting that if the pound continued to fall, rates would
have to rise.
The monthly monetary meeting coincides with the credit figures for
March which are now compiled by the Bank. Economists expect net credit
to fall back from February's #601m to around #500m in line with British
Bankers' data showing reduced lending to the personal sector.
This morning the April M0 figures are expected to produce growth of
0.7% in the narrow measure of the money supply. This would result in the
annual rate of increase declining from 7% to 6.5%, mainly reflecting
changes in bankers' balances rather than notes and coins in circulation.
Tomorrow's reserve figures for April are likely to post an underlying
fall of around $50m.
TODAY -- M0 (April).
TOMORROW -- Reserves (April).
WEDNESDAY -- None announced.
THURSDAY -- Cyclical indicators (April).
FRIDAY -- Credit (March).

SCOTTISH Enterprise is to set up a new company in the Azeri capital
Baku to help Scottish companies win a share of one of the largest
untapped oil and gas markets in the world.
Announcing the establishment of Scottish Caspian Trade (SCT) on the
eve of the Houston oil get-together OTC 95, Kourosh Bassiti, head of
Scottish Enterprise National's (SEN) Energy Group, said: ''Part of our
international remit is to identify emerging target markets, evaluate the
technological or product requirements in that particular area and match
those requirements against Scotland's manufacturing, service and supply
base.
''Azerbaijan has been selected because the hydrocarbon extraction
requirements and problems are very similar to those encountered in the
North Sea, thus making the market opportunities relatively easy to
understand for our companies.
''In our view, high-technology companies and technology-led product
suppliers from Scotland will experience less resistance than they
encounter in other parts of the former Soviet Union, particularly those
areas involved in offshore operations.''
Mr Bassiti said the Caspian development would also have to use these
technologies to develop their offshore oil and gas fields efficiently
and economically.
''Behind the political and economic uncertainties that presently beset
Azerbaijan we believe there lies tremendous opportunities to become part
of one of the greatest industrial and economic changes of this century.
''Western expertise and knowledge in all aspects of oil services and
supply are in great demand.
''Much of the required technology and skills developed during the
opening up of the North Sea are not emerging as rapidly as expected in
Azerbaijan.
''This leaves a vast area of untapped opportunity where Scottish oil
service and supply companies can comfortably provide leading edge
technology ahead of their foreign competitors.
''Baku is unique among the former Soviet republics in that
Azerbaijan's entire oil and gas exploration, development and production
is centred in and immediately around the city.
''Unlike Western or Eastern Siberia, the Volga-Urals and Kazakhstan,
where hydrocarbon deposits are spread over thousands of miles, the bulk
of these deposits in Azerbaijan are contained within several hundred
miles of Baku.
''From an offshore logistics perspective, access to the end-user is
therefore relatively easy compared with Siberia, consequently giving
greater investment return to companies who base themselves in Baku.''
The role of the new non-profit making company will be to provide
administrative, service and support functions to the Scottish-based oil
and gas service and supply companies who become members.
It will be staffed by an Azeri sales manager and two assistants and
access will be open to Scottish-registered companies in the energy
sector for a membership fee of #5000.
SEN has already successfully launched similar companies in Russia.
The key and immediate growth areas in the Caspian field developments
call, according to SEN, for products and services in the following areas
-- seismic, geophysical, geological data collection, interpretation and
analysis; service and supply vessels with port side support facilities;
fabrication and top side refurbishment (design, build and installation);
corrosion control, management and application of inhibitors; technology
transfer and skills know-how opportunities; subsea completion equipment
to North Sea standards; pipeline design, installation and management;
fluids and gas metering, equipment and qualitative/quantitative
measuring; directional and horizontal drilling control systems and
equipment; environmental management and clean up; and training and
education in most areas of field development.

MR BLAIR looks like a man who can't believe his good luck any more
than Mr Major can credit his ill-fortune. Blair, the ''Iron Laddie'',
achieved a 2-1 vote to abandon Clause 4, for 70 years the
nationalisation bedrock dogma of socialist aspirations. Major was
obliged to try to discount this further turn of the screw.
Blair blinked and gulped at the announcement of the Clause 4 vote. He
looked like a schoolboy does when, expecting to scrape an exam pass, he
hears he's got an A-grade. He also looked like a young man who has truly
discovered leadership.
Major had a pretty good idea that the A-grade was coming for his
rival, but was hoping that the chains of Labour history (as Blair was
bold enough to call them) would rattle louder at the special conference.
He was left to rattle them at the result himself.
There ensued yesterday an odd reversal in the vocabulary used by a
Prime Minister and a Leader of the Opposition. Blair, said Major, is a
mere ''soundbite'' politician, packaging his party like soap powder. He
called him naive, deceptive, shallow, inexperienced,
Tory-clothes-stealing, and self-contradictory.
Major, said Blair, is being ''profoundly silly'', ''foolish'', and
''superficial'' -- the sort of behaviour that Labour Opposition leaders
are customarily accused of by Tory Prime Ministers. It was a top-up to
his devastating, ''Iron Lady''-type retort to Major in the Commons last
week: ''I'll tell you what the difference between us is -- I lead my
party, you follow yours.''
Stung by this, the Prime Minister gave an interview to the Sunday
Times (the very paper that had caused the suspension of two of his back
benchers in the recent questions-for-cash furore) to launch a
vituperative personal attack on Mr Blair. Expect more of this when the
two clash again in the Commons on Tuesday. Expect a lot more of it after
Thursday's local election results.
The Tories could lose as many as 1750 of the 4000 seats they are
fighting south of the Border. Such a result would be further evidence
that the voters like Mr Blair and trust the way he has turned old Labour
around. Mr Major and his cohorts realise that this trend simply cannot
be allowed to continue. Blair must be denigrated.
Star campaigner Michael Heseltine warmed up his engines yesterday;
first to denounce the idea that Major should submit himself to a
leadership election now and, secondly, to start the process of taking
Blair apart. Labour hasn't changed, he said, it is Blair that has
changed.
The real difference between the two is that Mr Major ''has been saying
and pursuing the same philosophy and the same policies throughout his
life. Tony Blair has now had to admit that all the things he believed in
and stood for and argued for, he has had to abandon, even down to having
rather shame-facedly to pretend that he wasn't a member of CND''.
With the political initiative firmly in Blair's hands, this reactive
verbal deployment seems to be the best the Tories can do until (and if)
the voters pass through the pain of higher taxation. It might at least
dent Blair's nominal 30% lead in the opinion polls.
He is accused of being the ultimate turncoat; for example, previously
violently anti-Europe, now rabidly pro-Brussels and verging on
federalist. Major complains that last month Blair was demanding that he
make up his mind on a single European currency, at least half a dozen
years before it might come about. At the same time Blair states that he
will not fix a minimum wage policy two years ahead of a General
Election.
It is surely naive of Major to expect that his rival should not strive
after the best of both worlds at all times. Such is the traditional role
of parties in opposition. Nor should he expect that Blair is going to
announce manifesto details at this early stage and thereby flag the key
battlegrounds of the hustings. That way lies distortion or theft of your
pet political ideas.
To demand that Blair comes clean now on policy -- and such demands
will intensify -- is to travel in hope rather than anticipation, the
normal coin of the party dogfight. Major has two resources, one actual
and one theoretical, that afford themselves to him. The first is his
remarkable resilience and will to hang on to try to manage his way out
of his setbacks.
Blair may have got the better of him last week in the Commons, Major
having just let his rebels back into the party without conditions. But
this ascendency is still fleeting, in no way resembling yet the
harassment that Wilson in opposition gave Douglas-Home, or Thatcher's
hounding of Prime Minister Callaghan.
Blair's triumph over Clause 4 might now give him the moral authority
to achieve this. But if the Tory back benches (if only in desperation)
give Major a breather, he could display his street-fighter qualities to
advantage. He and Blair are well matched and we could be in for some
crackling confrontations.
The theoretical resource that might fall to Major is the price that
Blair may be made to pay by the Labour Party autumn conference for his
Clause 4 victory. He may have given a hostage to fortune by his
declaration that power has been handed to constituency members who, as
he says, now select Labour MPs and therefore members of a Shadow Cabinet
and, in time, a Cabinet.
Having given Blair his Clause 4 victory, these people may well want to
exert their power and insist on policies, even if they are antipathetic
to wavering Tory voters. Furthermore, the signs are that the process of
change in the Labour Party is to continue.
As individual membership increases, the numerical power of the trade
unions is to be diminished further and with it their as yet
unconvincingly unblocked block votes. As Labour councillors build up
their massive gains, the pressure will be on to bring them on to the
National Executive and exclude others. These rearrangements in power
might tempt militants to reinfiltrate the Labour Party.
The chains of old Labour may yet restrain the progress of the new
Social Democrats.

HE IS an unlikely David pitched against the Goliath of one of
Britain's most powerful companies. Since the start of the year,
Professor Joe Lamb has slung a number of wounding blows at British Gas
bosses. By the end of this month, some of these might prove to be
mortal.
However, the significance of this growing shareholder revolt may have
a much wider impact, reaching every boardroom in the country.
The Gas Greed Campaign is run from the equally unlikely setting of
Lamb's semi-detached house in Cupar, Fife. Aged 66, he still works
part-time, lecturing in physiology at St Andrews University.
It started almost by accident in December. Like many other small
investors, he was incensed at the 75% increase awarded to BG's chief
executive, Cedric Brown, taking his salary to #475,000 a year.
The company then lurched from one public relations catastrophe to
another. When the directors were awarding themselves huge rises, plans
were also revealed to cut 25,000 jobs (one-third of the workforce) and
close showrooms, while customer complaints rose to record levels.
Brown and his chairman, Richard Giordano, were then hauled back to the
Employment Select Committee to explain their failure to tell MPs about a
bonus scheme and a secret share option package which would further
inflate their salaries.
The Government's originally supportive line for the company,
vigorously articulated by Michael Heseltine, soon proved untenable and
the Prime Minister completed the U-turn, expressing his distaste at the
increases and inviting shareholders to use their clout for change.
Moral outrage there was aplenty, but Lamb's anger was fuelled by
intellectual insult in the company's reply to his original letter.
''The reason for the salary rise seemed spurious to me. They said they
were a great international company. It turned out they were not,
although they might become one in the future,'' Lamb said.
''The salary rises were also supposed to be linked to performance, but
this was plainly untrue. In almost every measure -- profit, return on
capital, and earnings per share -- performance has declined over the
past four years.''
As the man to kick-start the campaign, his own research interest on
the effects of the stimulant digitalis on the heart, is probably
appropriate.
From a tentative letter to the Guardian, the campaign has mushroomed
to 800 members and now includes a part-time secretary to deal with the
avalanche of mail.
''I have been very surprised by the response. We have had
broadly-based support, from company directors, bank managers, and
accountants to little old ladies sending in a pound to help,'' Lamb
said.
''I think we are just a conduit for people's feelings. A lot of small
investors have also been writing to their insurers or pension funds
asking what they are doing about British Gas. They have never had
letters like these.''
The campaign has forged close links with PIRC, the corporate
governance investment consultancy, which acts for a number of
international pension funds. Both have submitted a motion to the British
Gas annual meeting on May 31, highly critical of its executive pay
policy and calling for its radical overhaul.
At the weekend the stakes rose dramatically with the revelation that
British Gas was fighting back hard to enlist support against the
motions.
In a highly unusual move Giordano has written to the National
Association of Pension Funds asking its members to vote at the annual
meeting. He stopped short of seeking support for the board's position,
but in private meetings British Gas executives have been lobbying
shareholders precisely for this.
''Clearly, they are rattled,'' Lamb said.
''It is not surprising. They have made a shambles of everything and I
think it is because they would not talk to anyone outside the same small
circle.
''They are doing almost everything that a company should not do,
making everyone unhappy: their customers, shareholders, and their
employees.''
For Professor Lamb, the issue touches a much wider malaise within
British corporate governance over the past 10 years. Since 1986 he has
been chairman of the academic campaign group Save British Science, which
is now using the annual meeting as a weapon to probe each company's
research and development policy.
It has had some success in putting science funding on the commercial
agenda and was partly responsible for stimulating the Government's White
Paper Realising Our Potential, the first UK strategic view of science
since the 1970s.
The shrinkage in commercial spending on R&amp;D, decline in academic
science and career structure correlates with the Thatcher period of
short-term profit and get-rich-quick.
As City whiz-kids grew happier and richer, British boffins grew poorer
and more disillusioned, many emigrating to brighter pastures overseas.
Ironically, academics have coined a new Arthur Daleyism after Brown,
referring to a #500,000 research award as a ''Cedric''.
Professor Lamb argues that the overall poor performance of British
industry in the past 20 years is largely the result of failures of
management and not unionised workers.
''If you lose a battle, it is usually due to the general rather than
the soldiers,'' he said.
''I think people now realise that the directors of industry are
inadequate and I am told there is not a market for British executives
abroad.
''Directors also now tend not to be owners of companies. There is a
resultant lack of a longer-term view. It leads to paying themselves
large salaries, and the idea of treating the people who work for them as
chattels. Although they say the workers are the most important part of
the business, they do not actually treat them that way.''
Precisely how successful this shareholder and pension fund revolt
proves to be will be judged over the next four weeks. Meanwhile,
Professor Lamb, wearing his SBS chairman's hat, will be before the
science and technology committee at the House of Lords tomorrow pleading
for a better career and pay structure for scientists.
''We are having difficulty in getting people to enter science as
postgraduates because they do not see any future in it. It is a disaster
area,'' he added.

Challenging and entertaining, the Triple Vision art exhibition is a
Mayfest must, says Clare Henry
IN HIS introduction to Glasgow Print Studio's Mayfest show, Triple
Vision, Auberon Waugh opines: ''It is no accident that nearly all the
new British painting worth a glance comes from Scotland.'' And who are
we to disagree? For this Mayfest exhibition is a must: lively,
entertaining, powerful stuff -- and above all, diverse. Painters Neil
MacPherson, James McDonald and Douglas Thomson -- the Three Amigos --
display radically different styles of work. ''Probably one reason they
have remained friends,'' observed an astute neighbour. Now 40, all three
attended art school from 1974-8, emerging just too early to share the
Glasgow Boys' limelight in the mid-eighties. None the less, they have
stayed the course, proving to be both popular and profitable, with
sell-out shows from Glasgow to Brussels, Munich and Gstaad.
Triple Vision has already gained a good response, with buyers from
Scotland, London and abroad. This is perhaps the more remarkable as none
of the three goes in for easy art. Thomson's huge brooding heads
confront with menace, their disconcerting bloodshot eyes full of
haunting despair. MacPherson's more cheerful surreal Celtic world is
peopled by blue mermen, orange-green horse riders and mysterious seers
and sheep, while McDonald's predilection for ladies' flimsy knickers and
overtly erotic strawberries might worry some if they were not painted
with the skill of a Dutch old master.
To add spice to this hat trick, Original Print Shop Artist of the
Month is John Taylor, whose luminous silkscreens echo his watercolour
technique with drifts of hot reds and blues. Here again some small
editions like Chrysalis are already sold out. Another favourite, of two
figures, has a few left, so hurry. Triple Vision's top price is #4000
with bargains at #450. Taylor believes one of the beauties of prints is
their accessibility, so makes some available at a mere #50.
Triple Vision's paintings all work on several levels. Even McDonald's
realism carries an undercurrent of double entendre, yet MacPherson's
brilliant colour, encouraged by the crystal-clear light of his Caithness
home, can prove so seductive as to render explanations superfluous. You
can just wallow in his imaginative concoctions of rich vermilion, lush
emerald and passionate purple passages as applied to his characters.
Nothing wrong in that. But the subtext is fascinating too, so I asked
him to explain some of the stories.
''Much of my visual metaphor and allegory is based on ancient Orkney
sagas or Celtic tales. Robins are propitious and rowan berries are
associated with pre-Christian worship and warding off evil. Years ago
people planted rowan trees outside a new house to bring them luck. The
Apostle of the North was a real 19th century preacher. He was also a
poet and concluded a blood-and-thunder sermon with a romantic Gaelic
poem.''
McPherson is a relatively new father and his sense of family has grown
along with his small daughter, his work becoming increasingly sculptural
with representations of the family strongly bonded as an entity. The
Flight is his first circular oil, which he found difficult to
orchestrate. It contains a couple on horseback, the girl apprehensively
clinging to her man who looks steadily to the future. ''It could
represent the Flight into Egypt or true love; a couple who have made a
commitment. The circle represents everlasting love.''
He is also aware of life as a game of chance. ''One person succeeds
and another fails. Sometimes it's hard to see why, but in my oil,
Communist Family, there are two windows; one sunny, one grey. In other
words, you can take the right path or make a wrong choice.''
Lord of the Isles shows MacPherson successfully moving towards
abstraction with geometric background shapes acting as islands or a
sheet of rain. MacPherson impresses because he continues to experiment.
So too McDonald's recent move into portraiture which has him in demand
for commissions from Professor Ross Harper, Auberon Waugh, Marti Pellow
of the Wets, his niece Lois, and Dr Wood, an ambitious nude complete
with flying glass phials, bottles and funnels. And if all else fails to
capture your heart, try his Fantin Latour-style roses or chrysanthemums.
Lovely.
McDonald works in series inspired by favourite objects from his
grandmother's farm: a pile of mouldering books, their leaves yellow and
curled with age, spines battered and torn; rusty tools, carburettors and
batteries. Juxtaposing big brutal blowlamps with delicate satin and lace
lingerie was a brain wave, (Still life with Curtain Cord is bravely
divided dead centre: male/female, black/white, steel/silk), and led to
more romantic compositions of love letters, lipsticked coffee cups and
condoms.
''My pictures seem to vary between unashamed romance and outright,
barefaced prurience; sometimes both at the same time,'' he admits, which
infers that every object hints at a chapter of his love life. So is his
entire oeuvre to be read as some Diary of a Sex Maniac? It's all in the
mind of the beholder, they tell us, so over to you.
McDonald's best pictures contain a nice dash of understated wit. His
trompe l'oeil banknotes are inspired, with their added scribbles,
shopping lists and sticky tape -- but especially Fat Lady Bends Down to
Pull Up Her Panties -- in reality a line drawing of a 60-watt lightbulb
on a blue Royal Bank fiver complete with Culzean Castle.

THE FABER BOOK
OF POP
Edited by Hanif Kureishi
and Jon Savage: #16.99
IN seeking to corral half a century of writing about this pop music
malarkey, screenwriter-playwright Hanif Kureishi and journo Jon Savage
are aware of their task's especial problems. ''In some ways (pop) is
anti-intellectual; let yourself go, don't think -- feel,'' Kureishi
acknowledges in his foreword. In addition, an air of studied stupidity
has long been a staple in the armoury of pop poses, occasioning a
chronic difficulty in pop's relations with the printed page.
Back in 1956, for instance, when rock'n'roll attained the mass
currency which transformed it into the socio-cultural force which is
pop, Chuck Berry's Too Much Monkey Business cleverly played dumb in
lamenting the botheration caused by the daily grind of work, whether for
the Army or in a filling-station; by school; by malfunctioning
pay-phones, and above all by marriage.
See, some good-looking blonde wanted to get Chuck hooked; get him a
home, settled down . . . get him to write a book. ''Bah,'' Chuck
exclaimed at this awful prospect, as he did at the end of each of the
song's verses, venting his exasperated derision in near-wordless form
and demonstrating as he did so that one of the paradoxical strengths of
pop's lexicon is that it's a self-limiting one.
In a similar way, any consideration of rock-focused writing is
inevitably tinged by Frank Zappa's definition of rock journalism.
''People who can't write, doing interviews with people who can't think,
in order to prepare articles for people who can't read.''
Chuck Berry is represented here by an extract from his opaquely
orotund autobiography -- ''I love love songs when loving my love, just
as I dig blues when I'm blue'' -- rather than his economic yet allusive
song lyrics. Plainly, this is not as it should be. Meanwhile, Frank
Zappa appears thrice and but fleetingly, in the conversations of others.
Given Zappa's disdain for pop, this is probably about right.
What else have Kureishi and Savage got right? Most crucially, they
have selected lots of informative prose-extracts, whether measured or
zippy, sonorous or celebratory, by people who can certainly write. Here
I doff my cap to wayward wizard of scribble Paul Morley, who, having
been saddled with the job of doing an interview in 1982 with people who
can't think (Duran Duran), ultimately crafted an article so funny and
perceptive that even Frank Zappa would have found it impossible not to
read to the last piquant syllable.
Elsewhere among Kureishi and Savage's 120-odd chosen essayists,
commentators, diarists, novelists, hacks, and interpreters there are
some illuminatory extremes. On the one hand, there is the Runyonesque
Wolf Mankowitz, breezily outlining managerial sharp practice in pop's
Soho epicentre in the fifties. At the other, 30 years later, there is
the dogged Simon Garfield's grippingly detailed fiscal expose of the
music industry's rapacious contractual small print.
There's Keith Waterhouse, in Billy Liar, pinning down the nuances of
adolescent social ritual in provincial coffee bars; Anthony Burgess
documenting cold teenage alienation in Clockwork Orange; Angela Carter
decoding the sign language of punk fashion.
Wise and dispassionate observers like Peter Guralnick, Maureen Cleave,
Richard Goldstein, and Stanley Booth all provide front-line reports from
the sixties: from recording studios in Memphis with the Stax soul
greats, from the heart of swinging London or from bored suburban
America, at Altamont with the Rolling Stones.
Bringing us up to date, there is Andrew O'Hagan's acutely observed and
melancholic dispatch from Hanger 13 and Metro in the wake of the
much-publicised spate of drug-related deaths in Ayrshire last autumn.
You'll also find Malcolm X reminiscing about cutting loose on the
dance floor at Roseland; Andy Warhol being blankly open to everything;
Tom Wolfe and Hunter S Thompson deftly pioneering the journalistic art
of being there without being in the way; Noel Coward being archly
epigrammatic about the Beatles . . . hang on, what did Noel Coward know
about the Beatles?
He went to see them in 1965 and was disturbed, pronouncing the
mop-topped quartet talentless and rather silly-looking. Their audience
of febrile and noisy young women were what most shocked and horrified
him, however. ''I am all for audiences going mad with enthusiasm after a
performance, but not incessantly during a performance so there ceases to
be a performance,'' he fumed, not quite managing to create a Wildean bon
mot.
It's unfortunate that Kureishi and Savage's substantial tome sports
other examples of baffled oldsters' outrage at the latest pop fads, most
of them emanating from Fleet Street. Why is it unfortunate? Because one
outbreak of fearful ignorance, be it occasioned by the Sex Pistols or
Johnny Ray, is very much like any other, and because such ignorance
tells you very little, other than of the need to play on the prejudices
of a blinkered, middle-aged public in order to sell newspapers.
But Coward's outburst is rendered still sadder in being marshalled in
support of an agenda which dares speak its name o'ermuch throughout the
book. Kureishi and Savage wish us to know that homosexual men are pop's
unsung progenitors, principally as entrepeneurs and stylists.
Didn't we know this already, though? I think we did, actually.
Nevertheless, the duo proselytise on, labouring their point with
tangential diary references from Joe Orton and Derek Jarman, dull
anecdotes from Simon Napier-Bell.
Other no-nos? Bob Dylan's poetry, a stream-of-unconsciousness. Tony
Parsons being sickeningly earnest in 1977, as opposed to being as
sickeningly smug as he is today. Germaine Greer being cringe-makingly
hip-to-the-trip in praise of those failed and justly forgotten
late-sixties revolutionaries, the Pink Fairies.
And there's only one wild-eyed bout of soothsaying from Lester Bangs,
which is never enough. Ah yes, dear departed Lester Bangs. Provocative,
inventive, pyrotechnic, improper, comic, grotesque, joyous, compelling,
original. Forever breaking down barriers and forging new ways of telling
you things you never knew you needed to hear till you heard them. Like
pop at its best.
Settle down, stay home, read this book in preference to Psychotic
Reactions And Carburetor Dung, the one by Lester Bangs? Bah . . .

TO see Communicado on form is to see theatrical poetry. There's
something about the way director Gerry Mulgrew can take the most simple
element -- a sheet, an umbrella, a rubber glove -- and in one swift,
economical turn, transform it into just about anything he wants.
Quiz any of the young audience from Saturday night's performance of
Tall Tales for Small People and they'll surely attest that a dark,
apocalyptic horseman really did charge across the stage of Paisley Arts
Centre, that a hunchback really was transformed into a swan, and that a
baby possessed of evil fairy spirits really was thrown from the top of a
raging waterfall. Such was the level of our concentration. Such the
level of our creative involvement.
In Tall Tales for Small People, Communicado has taken a selection of
traditional travellers' stories as told by Duncan Williamson and given
them theatrical form. It's surprising that it's taken so long for a
company to exploit the raw material of what is arguably Scotland's
oldest indigenous performance form -- especially when the theatrical
version, like the oral tradition itself, can appeal to so broad an
audience.
Forget the fact that this show is being pitched at a school-age group.
Lucky children! I have no hesitation in recommending it to audiences of
any age, just as long as they have not lost childhood's great capacity
to imagine, to listen, to dream.
If the work on show at this year's Scottish International Children's
Festival in Edinburgh, where Tall Tales is heading at the end of the
month, is a fraction as good as this, then it will go down as a great
festival. It's simply, beguilingly, thrillingly, yet another piece of
world-class theatre from Communicado.

EACH Sunday afternoon of Mayfest, the Cottier Theatre in Hyndland
Street will host a concert of chamber music. In at the deep end
yesterday with the Royal SNO's Allander Ensemble -- launching Mayfest's
classical music programme -- and a programme containing two full-scale
masterpieces and not a filler in sight.
Beethoven's Harp Quartet doesn't quite fall into the Everest category
of the late string quartets, but it is no pushover . . . even here in
what is called Beethoven's middle-period set of quartets, you can hear
and feel the physical strain building as the great man starts to push
the form and the instrumentalists to the limit.
And it was here that the quartet from the Royal SNO -- section leaders
Edwin Paling, Rosalin Lazaroff, and John Harrington, with cellist
Miranda Phythian-Adams -- seemed almost tentative in their approach. In
a curiously undramatic and inconclusive performance of The Harp --
steadily-paced and almost understated -- they played with little sense
of urgency or bite. Only in the third movement was there any hint of
dash, bravado, and real muscle.
Quite suddenly in the second half, when the quartet was joined by
clarinettist John Cushing for Mozart's seamless Clarinet Quintet, a
transformation of mood occurred. Instantly more relaxed and at ease, the
players produced a performance more fluid and appropriate to Cushing's
unmistakably creamy and lyrical tone. The gorgeous slow movement, in
particular, was beautifully serene. The entire performance was
characterised by poise. Not a bad turnout, though I'd have expected more
for the opening gig. Next Sunday, the Chamber Group of Scotland, 2.30pm.
* Sponsored by the Glasgow Friends of the RSNO.

THE main surprise in Saturday night's gig at The Arches was that Tuck
and Patti, the Californian duo (guitar and vocals) whose names could
have been lifted straight from a Peanuts cartoon, have -- despite the
fact that this was their Scottish debut -- a devoted following.
Indeed, an unignorable faction of their following was not only
devoted, but verging on the deranged. Those of us who had never listened
to more than one of the couple's albums felt like interlopers at a
masonic meeting, as members of the cult of Tuck and Patti pleaded for
particular requests and sang along with tunes they did perform. It made
for an interesting evening.
In fact, it was just as well that the audience provided some diversion
since much of the music was repetitive and unabsorbing. There was a
handful of highlights: Patti Cathcart has a beautiful breathy, and
extremely powerful, voice which was most effective when it was in
storytelling mode. As it was on Jimi Hendrix's Castles Made of Sand; on
the soulful Heaven Down Here and, most memorably, on a folk tune called
You Take My Breath Away -- the kind of haunting tune you wish you could
take home with you.
Cathcart also demonstrated the versatility of her vocals with an
unaccompanied spoof blues on the subject of women's compulsive need to
buy high heels and what became a gospel version (complete with requested
audience participation) of Cyndi Lauper's Time After Time. Her husband,
Tuck Andress, was almost as impressive on guitar, but there was a
coolness about his technical wizardry.
That said, the pair clearly delighted an already-converted audience,
the bulk of whom leapt to their feet when their heroes' time was up.

HATS off to the frocks-off finale of the Carmylites' fifth Mayfest
production, which has the mature ladies of the drama group showing off
their assets in a massed striptease with cheerful bravado and
characteristic panache. The exuberance of their performance, with an
in-yer-face formula which you cannot fail to respond to, transforms what
could have been a humdrum script into a rollicking comedy.
Having created four Mayfest productions in the past, this year the
Carmylites have revised their original play, Hippy Crits, a soap opera
of secrets and suspicions, with every domestic tragedy instigated by a
spouse. Simple-minded Mavis clucks over her husband Dick, worrying about
his ''prostrate glands'', but her friends discover he is having an
affair. Ina's hubby gives her a black eye after he is mistakenly charged
by the police for assaulting her -- an issue handled confidently but
provoking a rather disturbing amused response from the audience.
Gloria, whose social pretensions are signified by the fact that she
''lives in Giffnock and reads The Herald'', is swanning about pretending
her husband is in Saudi on business when he is actually in the Bar-L.
Since their debut five years ago, the Carmylites, who devise their
shows together, have attended writing workshops, but while there is much
evidence of the professional touch in the slickness of the script, its
greatest strength is the earthy, vibrant language; every character is
totally credible and their banter encourages shrieks of recognition. My
favourite line was Mavis fussing ''should I be having a Tupperware party
when I'm heart-broken?'' The resultant striptease provided an empowering
affirmative.

OUR Scottish Secretary, Ian Lang -- he of the Dirk Bogarde looks and
elegant after-dinner speeches -- might be a bit long in the tooth to be
a pin-up boy these days but in Brussels he is a sudden hit with the
Eurocrats.
While being popular with the European Commission might not exactly
guarantee drinks on the house in Westminster or endear him to the
Conservative Party's anti-European crackpot wing, Mr Lang is showing
again that he is very much his own man when it comes to the European
debate.
It seems so long ago now that the Major Cabinet's only distinguishing
feature was its Europeanness. Much blood has flowed under the bridge
since then as the Prime Minister who, in his forgotten phrase, once
wanted Britain at the heart of Europe, has led an unedifying drift
towards the sceptics.
But Ian Lang, the man reputed to be Major's most loyal ally, has
remained true to the Euro-cause. ''I have not changed,'' he confirmed on
a recent visit to Brussels to see his brainchild, Scotland Europa, where
the chaps get a touch embarrassed if you refer to their offices as the
unofficial Scottish embassy.
Last week we had confirmation when it emerged Mr Lang was again moving
against the grain of government centralism by taking direct
administrative control of another area of European Union structural
funding for Scotland. It might not seem a fearfully radical change but
the implications are significant -- and are, in effect, a challenge to
his Eurosceptic colleagues in the Cabinet like Michael Portillo and John
Redwood. (Mr Redwood is so anti-European that he has still to visit
Scotland Europa's neighbour, the Wales European Centre.)
In effect, Mr Lang has devolved to himself the power to deal directly
with the European Commission in all of the various so-called Objectives
under which aid packages for Scotland are made available. He did so when
Objective 1 was secured for the Highlands and Islands, and he followed
this up by taking control of Objectives 2 and 5b (regions in industrial
decline and regions with rural problems respectively).
Last week he announced he had gone one step further and taken control
of Objective 3 which involves money for training from the European
Commission's social fund (ESF). This leads the Cabinet into a
controversial area because training was, of course, traditionally a
Whitehall responsibility until the Scottish Office grabbed control a few
years ago. By taking personal responsibility for ESF spending on
training in Scotland Mr Lang is ramming home the advantage.
This latest twist is complicated by the fact that Objective 3 money is
linked formally to funds in Objective 4, an arrangement which is the
cause of a prolonged and bitter dispute between the British Government
and the Commission. At the heart of the row is the Government's
continued refusal to apply for Objective 4.
By declining to accept its entitlement on principle -- and we are the
only Government daft enough to do so -- Britain stands to lose more than
#500m in aid for retraining workers in threatened industries. Our
Government, in its wisdom, disputes the need to spend money retraining
people already in work in preparation for the day when they lose their
jobs. The money, says the Government, should go only to those already in
work.
Scotland's share of this money is, therefore, in danger of being lost
because of this dispute which is fuelled by forces in London where the
Department of Employment -- responsible for training -- is run by the
aforesaid Mr Portillo whose approach to Brussels is rather like the
Rottweiler's fondness for postmen.
Mr Lang must be aware that this silly dispute is robbing Scotland of
valuable assistance and he must be tempted to cap his assumption of
authority in this area by breaking ranks with Portillo-style resistance
to the European Commission and making a unilateral bid for Scotland's
share of Objective 4. (Yes, I know he will deny any such thing but he
must be tempted none the less).
In these rows with the Commission over structural funding there is
only ever one winner. The terms must be negotiated, and only when the
applicant state accepts the rules will the bureaucrats start writing
cheques. Simple as that. The commissioner in charge of the ESF, Mr
Padraig Flynn, has said as much many times and as this row with
Whitehall rumbles on, Mr Lang is left without Scotland's share of the
money.
His decision to assume direct control of Objective 3 has gone down
well in the Commission where devolution (or ''subsidiarity'' as the
jargon has it here) is a watchword and regionalism is all the rage.
(Sorry, but in EU terms Scotland is still only a ''region'' -- just like
England.)
More entertainingly, Mr Lang appears to have let the genie out of the
bottle because now there are mutterings from the Welsh and the English
regions that direct access to Brussels, Scottish-style, is a grand idea.
Anything which brings Europe's regions closer to Brussels is smiled on
by the Eurocrats these days.
There is nothing much to stop the genie having some fun apart from
Government dogma which, we now see from Edinburgh, can be overcome in
style. Oh, there will be legal weasel words somewhere about the money
technically being paid through London but the effect is unchanged. In Mr
Lang's own words to MEPs, the result of his taking over Objective 3
means that ''within the context of programmes agreed with the European
Commission, actions are tailored to Scottish needs.''
The implications are fun to behold: Mr Lang is a good European, a
Major loyalist, a man talked about as successor to Malcolm Rifkind at
Defence or Douglas Hurd at the Foreign Office. A man, therefore, to have
on the side of the angels.
It would not surprise me in the least if an angel somewhere deep
inside the Commission was discovered sometime soon writing a polite note
to Mr Lang suggesting he might like to continue his policy of by-passing
London by lodging an application for Scotland's share of Objective 4.
The money is, after all, lying there doing nothing and is earmarked for
us.
Mr Lang would do himself a huge and much-needed electoral favour with
his Scottish audience. The only losers would be the Cabinet Eurosceptics
who threaten his friend the Prime Minister and divide the party.
So there. Another problem solved. Sometimes I ask myself why I didn't
go into politics.

THE Mavericks sit very much on the cusp where new country meets the
old style and collides with bar-room boogie.
It's an intriguing conflict, and while it's encouraging to see
Glasgow's traditional country fans warming in big numbers to a young,
goatee-bearded country rock band from Nashville, it is easy for them to
find reassurance in the fundamentally conservative ingredients of the
band's music.
It rarely gets better than the opener and title track of their new
album What A Crying Shame -- a gently seductive piece of country tinged
rock driven along by tight harmonies and rolling piano lines.
Additionally, the more laid-back I Should Have Been True and From Hell
to Paradise are both well-written vehicles for musical competence and
Orbisonesque vocals.
Closer examination reveals little below the surface that breaks with
decades of country tradition. Lyrically the set is a trawl through
broken loves and lives, broken hearts and sentimentality, while
musically There Goes My Heart is the kind of singalong
Nashville-by-numbers song which only just sits on the right side of the
divide between acceptable and Billy Ray Syrus.
Their dilemma is captured in their choice of cover version, which is
ironically aimed at making them ''more hip''. They get it right enough
to pummel Springsteen's new country masterpiece Tunnel of Love but they
get it totally wrong when they bludgeon All That Heaven Will Allow with
the kind of riffs markedly absent from the original.
It would be churlish totally to dismiss the Mavericks, but until they
release themselves from the shackles of convention and crowd pleasing
they will remain untouched by greatness.

A MAN wants to give me a quote but unfortunately he is barely audible,
waving his arms wildly at the stage demonstrating that after four songs
in the Charlatans' set, he is dripping.
The moshpit of flailing bodies is usually confined to the area below
the stage -- for the Charlatans, it extends across most of the hall.
And the band don't mess about. They launch into the set with the
anthemic swagger of Easy Life and two songs later comes the big debut
hit of five years ago, The Only One I Know.
It sounds freshly minted. A stage invader is allowed to approach
singer Tim Burgess during Here Comes The Soul Singer and Tim embraces
him before he's led away.
Confidence and generosity. That partly explains the survival of a band
who might have been replaced by Oasis. (The cunning DJ had already wowed
the crowd with the Oasis version of I Am The Walrus.) Both bands mine a
similar seam of sixties references: melody and hooks that are vaguely
familiar.
Maybe the secret lies in Rob Collins and his keyboards: organ sounds
both funky and stately, crashing chords and psychedelic pulses, as if
Procol Harum had collided with Manchester's baggy brigade to produce
this potent fusion.
But whereas at the beginning you might have thought that the
Charlatans had only one good idea, the obvious truth is that they have
stayed ahead of the game and are currently razor sharp.
The Charlatans are definitely the real thing.

FROM the sweating throngs of a sold-out garage crowd, it must be said:
if Scottish jazz festivals want to continue and not be mere dinosaurs in
five years' time then get hep to this: the JTQ.
The place was full of wall-to-wall youngsters -- some in de rigueur
regulation hats, others there only to dance. These people are tomorrow's
audience, and they are musically astute: by Jesus they even applauded
solos.
Moralising over, first up came Eusebe, courtesy of London's Mama Yard
Collective.
Cool, hot-steppin', groovesome bass-led rhythms reminiscent of
Arrested Development at their very best, ensured their place in the
crowd's hearts.
Their summertime feeling -- a take on Marvin Gaye's Sexual Healing
riff -- should be a potential summer-time hit.
And so to the JTQ. Sure crowd pleasers getting the combination just
right.
All the hits, including Love The Life with vocals ably handled by
Xavier Burnet whose smokin' vocals set the scene, although he could have
done without the call and response chorus -- but by heck, the crowd
loved it.
For encores we had the Starsky and Hutch theme, complementing
Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love (the seminal seventies TOTP theme) and
George Benson's Love Ballad, although it's the instrumentals that count.
All reminiscent of 1970s TV -- post-Ironside, and recalling
Blacksploitation movies.
The titles could well have been High Speed Chase and Machine Gun
Boogie, and not have been out of place.
The audience remained foot-sure throughout as did the rhythm section
-- the quartet augmented by trombone, trumpet, and flute. Jazz reference
of the night came courtesy of Milestones.
This is today's jazz, and tomorrow's, like it or not.

Mogadishu, Sunday
A NEW Zealand merchant adventurer who did business in anarchic Somalia
even after losing one of his sons there, has been murdered, UN officials
said.
The full story of David Morris's death in the southern village of Bur
Gabo is still unknown and his corpse has not yet been retrieved from his
killers.
Morris, 52, owned an Australian-based catering firm which supplied
water and food to the UN army before it evacuated on March 2 at the end
of a failed mission to restore peace. He was abducted by gunmen last
Wednesday.
Few foreigners are brave enough to venture into Somalia, let alone do
business in a country where life is like something out of the Mad Max
film about post-nuclear war Australia.
Morris, a diminutive, work-obsessed and hard-drinking figure, scoffed
at the dangers and drove about Mogadishu in an armoured personnel
carrier guarded by Cambodian gunmen who UN peacekeepers said were
ex-Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
In 1993, a Somali former employee shot his son Tyson, 21, dead in a
Mogadishu street.--Reuter.

Madrid, Sunday
THE day that Interpol got its sums wrong left senior police officers
in Spain bemused and smiling.
A routine message following a raid on a villa at the resort of
Estepona, a few miles from Gibraltar on the Costa del Sol, said that
#50m in cash had been discovered and that a Briton named as Sally
Boustead, 38, and her 46-year-old Danish companion, named only as
Larsen, had been detained for questioning.
But today the chief detective at the resort who carried out the
investigation put things into perspective. He said that a total of
#100,000 in sterling had been found in the raid on February 17 and the
couple questioned.
''It's absolute nonsense to say that this staggering sum of #50m was
found. You would need a truck to carry that lot around. There were 20
million pesetas in cash in sterling -- that's about #100,000.''
The couple were released after questioning.
In Madrid today officers were chuckling about the report of what would
have been one of the biggest hauls of cash in history.
One said: ''Someone seems to have put too many naughts into the
Interpol message. Half the police forces in Europe would have been
jumping up and down if this was true.''
The officer explained that large amounts of cash were often seized on
the Costa in connection with the booming hashish smuggling between
Morocco and Europe.
He said: ''I'm talking about tens of thousands of pounds. But #50m
would have made this the biggest operation of all time.''
The British consulate network in Spain insisted that it had no record
of any arrest of a woman named Boustead.

A MOVE has been made to break the stalemate over allowing two
grandmasters to use the priceless Isle of Lewis chess set.
British grandmaster Nigel Short is to play Viking grandmaster Simon
Adgestein to mark the return of the pieces to the Isle after 164 years.
However, the British Museum, which owns most of the 850-year-old
pieces, has said they must not be touched, check-mating plans by the
Isle of Lewis Chess Club to use the pieces for the #35,000 tournament in
July.
Now organisers of the tournament have written to the museum and
Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell offering to play the match in gloves.
The Norse, hand-carved walrus ivory chess pieces, the most famous and
distinctive in the world, were found on a remote beach on the west coast
of Lewis in 1831.
The best pieces are valued at around #1m each and 83 of the 94 pieces
are in the British Museum. The Lewis Chess Club had invited Mr Adgestein
to create an historical link to mark the return.
In his letter to the British Museum, club chairman Alasdair MacLeod,
says: ''We would request that Nigel Short and Simon Adgestein be
permitted to play with actual pieces rather than a replica set.
''They would of course be expected to wear gloves and would remain
under the continuous scrutiny of security guards.
''The pieces were made to be used and are diminished by being
otherwise constrained.''
The British Museum would not comment yesterday.

IT'S less than a fortnight till the first anniversary of John Smith's
death. A year is a lifetime in politics. He never fought an election as
leader, and he had only a couple of party conferences to make his mark.
For one of those his successor should be mightily grateful. The painful
birth of One Member, One Vote -- an innovation which only just squeaked
through -- turned what could have been a messy defeat for Tony Blair
into a considerable personal triumph.
Of course the balloting of union rather than constituency members
wasn't exactly an advertisement for individual democracy. But already
you can detect how Labour's spin doctors plan to turn the intransigence
of men like Morris and Bickerstaffe into an opportunity to distance
themselves from what they clearly see as yesterday's men. Already the
party line is that here were fellows merely watching their backs rather
than facing the future; already the whisper is that they are bound for
the Jurassic Park of modern politics.
And it may be so. And it may be that trade unionism will survive only
through the brand of ruthless pragmatism practised by union leaders like
Gavin Laird. But before everyone who defended Clause 4 is denounced as
hopelessly myopic, it is worthwhile taking a look at some of their
motives.
Going to the wall for a piece of prose crafted in and for another age
is clearly a futile sacrifice. Most Labour voters not actively involved
in politics would have been hard pushed to know how the clause read
never mind what it stood for before Mr Blair decided to disinter it and
use it as the means of establishing his political virility.
But I sense that in a Scottish context much of the unease surrounding
the ditching of Clause 4 had very little to do with the wording of it.
Many of his supporters in this country weren't much exercised about the
commanding heights of the economy or the ownership of the means of
production. What they were responding to was a gut fear that the newly
sanitised party might gain its electoral credibility but lose its soul.
And its soul north of the Border is a discernibly different affair
from the Essex variety. When John Smith made his first speech as party
leader many puzzled English commentators derided it as more of a sermon
than a rallying call. They were uneasy with the lengthy passages which
talked about the concerns we should have for those less fortunate. Not
very fashionable in the nineties, dear.
Now it would be unfair to suggest that Tony Blair, 15 years younger
and using the language of his time, cares any less about the core values
of his party than the man whose death propelled him on to the bridge.
But sometimes Scots become nervous about the new tone of New Labour.
They wonder if what puts issues at the top of the agenda is not their
intrinsic importance, but how they play in the opinion polls. They
wonder, most of all, how much the things they do care about will change
for the better if Labour is elected. And they get downright twitchy
about the lack of specific commitments to these improvements.
Of course all parties who believe themselves to be the incoming
Government have a series of mantras they recite in the home straight.
Things about not making promises they can't deliver; about not putting
price tags on policies until they've seen for themselves just how bad
the books are. And some due reticence on the fiscal side is perfectly
proper and defensible.
But there are some things you can talk about which don't involve
detailed budgets.
Many Scots inclined to vote Labour want to know not just that the
party doesn't want its water and sewage services run by quangified
boards, but what it intends to do about restoring these services to
public ownership.
They want to know not just that the party is opposed to railway
privatisation but that if the completion of that policy precedes the
election what strategy will be employed to unravel it, and whether or
not that means restoring the previous routes and service frequency.
They want not just a commitment to a National Health Service which is
not budget-led, but some specific reassurances about how the unwieldy
new bureaucracy will be dismantled to help pave the financial way for
adequate medical staff numbers and decent patient resources.
They don't give a toss, by and large, if their bunion operation isn't
available on tap, but they do badly need to know that there will be an
emergency bed as and when needed for a schizophrenic son or daughter, or
an elderly relation in distress.
They would like to feel that care in the community will be given a
priority and that the elderly and the disabled and the chronically sick
will not become used as scapegoats for the burgeoning benefits budget.
They want Labour to make sure the education service doesn't fall to
the forces of darkness as it has in England.
So far there have not been exactly a surfeit of straight answers to
those kind of straight questions. Which leads many voters to fret that
the Treasury Department under Labour might exert the same kind of
stranglehold as the Tory variety.
Nobody would accuse anyone on the Labour front bench of being a
surrogate Lilley or Portillo, but it would be nice, nevertheless, to be
able to suppose that a new Government would unscramble their more
unsavoury philosophical excesses.
It would be nice to feel sure that the hundreds of thousands of young
people made inadvertently homeless would be able to claim benefit again
when they have no prospect of parental support or immediate employment.
It would be good to think that the Child Support Agency wasn't just
painted pink but rethought from scratch. If it's terminally broke don't
just fix it.
David Blunkett recently told Shadow Cabinet colleagues that if they
won this would be the first Labour Government to do more than it
promised. I hope he wasn't joking.

It was hailed as crucial to women's liberation but the latest scare
about its safety is making many think again. In the first of a two-part
series, Alan MacDermid assesses the risks of the Pill
Illustration: CINDERS McLEOD
This is the booklet which accompanies the Femodene pill. Its first 40
pages of print are informative and clear, only on page 41, right, does
the company warn of potential health hazards
A BLOOD clot in the lungs is a frightening experience, not least
because it can prove fatal. It generally originates deep in the veins,
typically in the legs, and breaks off to travel its potentially lethal
course through the system.
Inactivity increases the risk of this deep-vein thrombosis, so chronic
invalids are vulnerable. Obesity and smoking also increase the risk.
However, it is also one of the hazards of being a woman. They are twice
as likely as men to suffer, for two reasons -- pregnancy and,
perversely, their favourite way of avoiding it.
Thrombosis and the Pill are currently a serious health and legal
issue, provoked by an inquest which highlighted one brand whose health
risks were set out in a pamphlet inside the box. Now the lawsuits are
rolling in from relatives of those who have died, or women who have
survived the experience with a lasting legacy of damage to their health.
No-one has taken a Pill manufacturer to court and gone the distance,
but some have reached out-of-court settlements. The problem is that the
risks are well established and the warnings are there, even if you have
to read the instructions. The doctor prescribing them also has a duty to
warn about them.
But women keep taking them, and are encouraged to take them, on the
basis that becoming pregnant is even more dangerous than taking the
Pill. Now it appears some women, perhaps one in 20, already have an
inborn tendency to blood clotting that can multiply the risk of
suffering a deep-vein thrombosis.
At the centre of the current controversy is the prominence of the
manufacturer's warning about risk factors: a coroner recently questioned
the value of Schering's warning starting on page 41 of a product
information booklet in every pack of its Femodene brand.
Sir Montague Levine, who conducted the inquest on lung-clot victim
Beverley Marsh, is recommending to the Committee on the Safety of
Medicines that a warning should appear on the side of the packet.
Londoner Marsh died the day before her 21st birthday from a heart
attack, after the arteries in both her lungs had been blocked by blood
clots. She was described as overweight and smoked, and had been taking
the Pill for two months.
Some drugs have all their product information in one sheet of folded
paper; on the face of it, one has to wonder what on earth Schering has
to tell us on pages 1-40 if it takes that long to get to matters of life
and death. In fairness, however, it is a small booklet -- about 10cms x
4cms -- and designed to be easily read and understood, with at most
eight lines of text per page, and sometimes as few as four words.
After the initial blurb, the index, and a frontispiece, pages four to
eight are taken up explaining about the birds and the bees, followed by
an explanation of how the Pill works, how to take it, what to do if you
miss one or two, alternative contraception, and general advice about
taking other medicines with it, and the big question -- will I put on
weight if I take the Pill?
That takes us up to the first reference to side-effects and
contra-indications, which in fact is on page 31: ''Some women must not
use the Pill. Your doctor will have made sure that you have none of the
conditions that rule out the use of the Pill.''
Users are then referred to the statutory information, which the makers
are required to carry separately from their own blurb, and this begins
on page 38 with a list of contra-indications, in particular a history of
disorders pre-disposing to blood clots.
What appears on page 41 puts this more formally:
''Warnings: There is a general opinion, based on statistical evidence,
that users of combined oral contraceptives experience more often than
non-users various disorders of the circulation of blood, including
strokes . . . heart attacks . . . and blood clots obstructing the
arteries of the lungs. There may not be full recovery from such
disorders and it should be realised that in a few cases they are fatal .
. .''
This goes on until the end of the booklet, at page 55, with advice on
other side-effects and symptoms.
It is probably as simply written as could be expected from something
that goes into that amount of medical detail; they aren't asking people
to read War and Peace.
Nevertheless, a good 15-20 minutes of uninterrupted study would
probably be advised to absorb it all. In reality many people don't have
that kind of attention span; many women may not even have the time or
privacy to do it justice; and some people simply can't read. So the
booklet does not absolve a prescribing doctor from finding out a
patient's known risk factors and making sure she is aware of the risk.
No woman should leave a clinic or surgery with a prescription for the
Pill without being conscious of the risk she might be running, even
before she reads the small print.
Every year about 20,000 women are prescribed the Pill by Greater
Glasgow's Family Planning and Sexual Health Directorate, now part of the
Community and Mental Health Services Trust.
According to Dr Alison Bigrigg, Clinical Director, there has been
remarkably little reaction to the latest controversy apart from a few
inquiries.
''Thrombosis is a known side-effect of all combined contraceptive
Pills, but most of the research was done on the older, higher-dose
Pills,'' she said. ''I don't think we know how commonly it occurs with
modern low-dose Pills . . . there is a presumption that the lower-dose
Pills cause fewer.
''People with risk factors are screened out. For example, women over
35 who smoke would be strongly advised they are at high risk. If you are
25 and you don't smoke, and have no history of thrombosis, you would not
be advised against.''
Not everyone wants to take their doctor's advice. Would Dr Bigrigg
prescribe the Pill to a smoker of 35-plus?
''Yes -- provided they understood the risk. One reason for that is
that if they have a high risk of thrombosis that risk will also be
increased by pregnancy.''
Genetic factors*, she agreed, opened up some new possibilities for
identifying the vulnerable women with no obvious risk factors, but it is
no simple matter yet.
She explained: ''There are a number of different factors which
pre-dispose to thrombosis. It is possible to measure for it and you
could then offer an alternative, but if we screened everyone before they
went on the Pill it would add considerably to the cost. There are
several different haemostatic screens you would have to do.
''The sensible policy would be to screen women who have had a possible
thrombosis or a family history, rather than using it in a blanket
fashion. It has to be placed in the context of other risks.
''I think the warnings in the manufacturer's data sheet are perfectly
adequate. There is always a balance to be struck between sensible advice
and warning of very remote risks. The manufacturers have to cover
themselves, and tend to warn of everything they can think of.''
* A NUMBER of biochemicals which control blood-clotting may be subject
to these genetic mutations. Resistance to one such anti-coagulant
factor, Activated Protein C, was linked last year to a genetic mutation
common in Holland, Factor V Leiden.
In a study of more than 300 Dutchwomen, those who were taking the Pill
had a four-fold risk of thrombosis; those who had the Leiden gene
mutation had an eight-fold risk.
But combined, carriers of the mutation who also took the Pill had a
30-fold risk of a thrombosis over women who were neither carriers nor
taking the Pill.
Professor Jan Vandenbroucke, of Leiden University, who carried out the
study, raised the question in the Lancet of whether young women starting
the Pill should be screened for the mutation and the resulting APC
resistance.
He pointed out that withholding oral contraceptives from all carriers
might be a high price to pay for such a precaution, given the Pill's
advantages over other methods of contraception. Instead, if a woman has
had a deep-vein thrombosis the question of her being affected by the
mutation must be addressed when advising about future contraception.
DOS AND DON'TS OF THE PILL
STOP the Pill immediately if you experience any of these possible
warning signs of a thrombosis:
* Migraine for the first time, or a more severe one than normal, or
unusually severe or frequent headaches;
* Experience dizziness or fainting;
* Sudden disturbance of vision or disturbance of speech;
* Inflamed veins (phlebitis);
* Pains in the chest or abdomen;
* Swelling in the limbs;
* Pain, tingling or numbness in any part of the body;
* Unexplained cough, breathlessness, or pain on breathing.
Before you start, make sure you have an examination of the pelvic
organs and breasts, and blood pressure.

A MULTI-MILLION pound world centre for the study, interpretation, and
enjoyment of Scotland's Gaelic culture and heritage is nearer to
becoming a reality. The centre could be established on Skye in five
years time.
A prime six-and-a-half-acre site has been secured; Hydro-Electric is
interested in installing a pilot sustainable energy power system;
architects are at work; and accountants' calculations completed.
Detailed proposals have now been lodged with the Millennium Commission
along with an application for #15.75m, 60% of the #26.3m it will take to
make ''Bail' Ur Ostaig'' a reality by the year 2000.
Bail' Ur Ostaig, which means the new village or township of Ostaig, is
planned for the shores of the Sleat Peninsula overlooking the Sound of
Sleat to Knoydart and Mallaig. It would be half a mile from the Gaelic
College Sabhal Mor Ostaig, which it would eventually absorb.
If a University of the Highlands and Islands (a project also seeking
commission support) is established the centre would become one of its
campuses. If not, it will work to develop degree-level courses in
association with established universities.
The project is being driven by Sabhal Mor, whose director, Mr Norman
Gillies, said: ''What must be stressed is that Bail' Ur Ostaig is not
just an extension of Sabhal Mor. It is something far more important and
totally new.
''It would be an international resource of huge significance. It would
not just be for the academic scholar but would be accessible to all.
There is nothing really comparable.
''The Millennium Commission was described by its first chairman as a
means of realising visions. Our particular vision is one that is already
being given very real substance by the site we have obtained and the
support we have attracted.''
The plans are ambitious. At the centre of the project will be a
library and archive of books and audio-visual materials, including
digitalised versions of all sound recordings in Gaelic held by BBC
Scotland, the School of Scottish Studies in Edinburgh, St Francis Xavier
University in Nova Scotia, and the Irish Folklore Department at
University College, Dublin.
On the educational front there is likely to be a wide range of
inter-disciplinary courses at various levels from degree-level Nordic
studies and full-time Gaelic immersion to short summer courses.
The approach may owe as much to North Amerian liberal arts colleges as
Scottish universities. Links would be established with Ireland, North
America, and Scandinavia.
The centre would also be the home to the soon to be formed National
Gaelic Theatre company with rehearsal and performance areas, including
an auditorium which would also be used for conferences. There would be
an overlap with training in television and radio work, already pioneered
at Sabhal Mor; music, dance, and visual arts.
Also planned are administrative offices, shops, eating places, a
swimming pool, teaching areas, and accommodation.

FROM sovereignty to the humblest of cobblers and candlestick-makers,
particular trades and professions have run in families from the earliest
chroniclings. Whether it is the result of genes or daily example, there
are endless instances of dynasties not just in businesses, great and
small, but in law, politics, the church and medicine.
Is it lack of imagination on the part of young people who follow so
doggedly in their parents' footsteps, or is it that by being brought up
in a legal, medical or political household they learn by a process of
osmosis whether they have the qualities required for a particular
profession? The question is worth asking as a result of two recent cases
of academically excellent youngsters who have been refused entry to
Glasgow University medical school because of their performance at
interview. One common factor is that both have parents who are doctors.
After 17-year-old Conor O'Reilly's well-publicised rejection by
Glasgow University, a second case has come to light of a girl with five
A-grade Highers after fifth year being refused a place because ''at
interview she did not convey that she had a full appreciation of the
positive and negative features of a clinical life, or of the
characteristics required in a doctor to cope with these,'' according to
the admissions' staff.
Only the girl and her interviewers know what they said to each other,
but her mother, who refuses to allow the family to be named, is a GP and
her father is a hospital doctor. ''It would be impossible to live in
this household and not know that family life is disrupted at all hours
of the day and night because of the demands of medicine but also that
doctors derive great satisfaction from their careers, which balances the
drawbacks,'' said Dr X, the girl's mother.
She thinks it likely that the children of medical parents will see the
commitment and qualities required as so normal as to be not worth
mentioning. ''I am sure that Glasgow gets excellent students, but a
totally subjective judgment based on a 10-minute interview is as
meaningful as selecting candidates with suitable qualifications and
discarding the surplus at random,'' she said.
Glasgow stands by its policy, pointing out that the competition is
fiercer than ever. This year, 21 applicants with ''straight A'' strings
of Highers have been rejected. ''It is like the Olympics. There is a
qualifying heat, but when you get through that you start all over again.
It doesn't matter how well you did in the heat if you don't do well in
the final.''
According to Stuart MacPherson, associate dean of the Medical Faculty
at Glasgow University, coming from a doctor's family is a neutral
factor. He said: ''They understand what a doctor's life is like, but
that is balanced by negative pressure if they feel they have to follow
in their parents' footsteps -- and that is equally true of any other
profession. We ask whether they have had any work experience or talked
to doctors about medicine as a career.
''We do not ask any technical questions because we are not testing
their knowledge but their enthusiasm, commitment and suitability for
medicine. We are looking for people who have gone to see what a hospital
is like or what working as a GP is like.''
There are approximately 10 applicants for every place in a medical
school, and the initial academic hurdle is much the same, but the
selection procedure ranges from allowing no-one in without an interview
(at Glasgow and all the London hospital schools) to offering places on
the basis of the UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service)
form, including exam grades, a personal statement and school report plus
additional character references (at Edinburgh). The other Scottish
medical schools decide the majority of places from the UCAS forms, but
interview a number from whom they want additional information.
Gordon Pont, admissions officer at Dundee University medical school,
said they interview ''the very old, the very young and those whose
personal or medical history raises questions''. An interview normally
lasts 20 minutes in Dundee, while Glasgow allocates 10 minutes to Scots
and 15 minutes to those from elsewhere with the extra time given to
discussion about the city itself.
One of the complaints from both sets of dissatisfied parents about the
Glasgow system is that 10 minutes is not long enough to get to grips
with a teenager's potential.
Cary Cooper, professor of occupational psychology at the University of
Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, agrees. ''On the basis
of a 10-minute interview you are as likely to get the wrong impression
as you are to get the right one,'' he said.
Interestingly, Manchester University has recently changed from a
form-based system to one of interviewing everyone who is offered a
place. That was to coincide with the switch to a modular rather than
lecture-based course which brought a requirement to select students who
favoured that approach.
However, a place on their clinical course is guaranteed to all medical
science graduates from St Andrews, who will be offered a place without
an interview unless they are mature students or switching course.

Dachau, Sunday
SURVIVORS of Dachau and American soldiers who saved them reunited
today to mark the 50th anniversary of the liberation the first
concentration camp the Nazis opened and the model for all that followed.
Speakers said the bleak former camp northwest of Munich, which opened
two months after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, was a ''school of
murder'' where the SS-trained commandants for larger camps such as
Auschwitz.
The US Army's 42nd Infantry Rainbow Division freed Dachau on April 29,
1945, shortly before the end of the Second World War. It was the last
major concentration camp liberated on German soil.
''Dachau illustrates the brutality and inhumanity of the Nazi regime
from its first day in power down to the bitter end,'' Ignatz Bubis, head
of Germany's tiny surviving Jewish community, told over 3000 people who
gathered despite the driving rain.
Max Mannheimer, chairman of the Dachau Inmates Association, called
Dachau ''the foundation stone for the construction of all concentration
camps and later the extermination camps, whose trail of blood led to
Auschwitz, Majdanek and Treblinka''.
Dachau was not an extermination camp like Auschwitz and many inmates
were anti-Nazis, including German leftists, Polish Roman Catholic
priests and resisters from all over Europe. More than 32,000 died from
torture, disease, experiments and executions.
Another 6000 Soviet prisoners of war were killed at the ''SS shooting
gallery'' and several thousand disabled or retarded inmates were sent to
a camp near Linz in Austria to be gassed.
About 180 veterans of the Rainbow Division returned for the ceremony
to Dachau, many for the first time since they blasted the last SS guards
out of their watchtowers and rescued about 30,000 frightened and
emaciated inmates.
John McGovern, president of the division's veterans' association,
said: ''We bitterly resent those whose arrogance imposed their evil on
humanity and, as a result, required the final sacrifice by so many.''
Speaking for the survivors, retired French General Andre Delpech,
chairman of the International Dachau Committee, hailed the camp's
liberators as ''soldiers of freedom''.
Many survivors wore red triangles -- the sign of political prisoners
-- with letters identifying their nationalities.--Reuter.

JUDY MACKIE speaks to Dr Wendy Graham who takes up her appointment as
director of the new Dugald Baird Centre for Women's Health in Aberdeen
today
IN A remote African village, a woman is delivering her baby on rush
matting on a mud hut floor, with her mother and sisters in attendance.
Thousands of miles away, in a large Scottish city, a woman is having her
child in pristine hospital surroundings, aided by a qualified midwife,
obstetrician and nurse, and the latest medical technology.
To ask which culture can learn from the other might seem astonishingly
naive to most health professionals. Not so to Dr Wendy Graham, director
of the new Dugald Baird Centre for Research on Women's Health at
Aberdeen Maternity Hospital.
The 38-year-old international expert on maternal health research
believes the Western world has much to learn from developing countries
when it comes to attitudes to pregnancy and childbirth.
As a former senior lecturer with the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine, Graham, an Oxford graduate, has spent much of her
career working in Africa, South America, the Middle East, and South-east
Asia, where despite poor health care facilities, giving birth is
regarded as part of everyday life.
''What's important is that pregnancy and childbirth are not treated as
pathologies. In the developed world we have tended to lose sight of
that, seeing them as illnesses which require medical intervention and
curative care. Things are getting better now, but it has been a very
destructive phase, which has given women the wrong messages about
themselves and their health,'' she says.
Attitudes to working mothers, childcare, and breastfeeding, too, are
far more enlightened among the communities of developing countries.
''There's a real spirit of the importance of the family and a ready
support network for the working mother, which I think at times is
lacking over here. Breastfeeding in public places is seen as natural and
normal, whereas it causes a great deal of tension and controversy in the
UK.''
Such social issues and their effects on women's health will form an
important part of the work carried out at the research centre which, as
a new branch of the University of Aberdeen's Faculty of Medicine, will
work in tandem with other groups within the Department of Obstetrics and
Gynaecology at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital.
The centre aims to build on existing research into better provision
for women's health by looking not only at the experiences of Scottish
women and the type of care available to them, but also seeing these
issues in an international context.
''Our role is to address priorities in Grampian, Scotland, and the UK,
but I think there is a lot to be learned from a broader vision -- from
other people's experiences and their relevance here,'' says Graham.
This ability to take a broader view will be a key feature of the
centre, which rather than taking the traditional approach of looking at
''snapshots'' of episodes in women's medical histories in order to
address major health issues, will look at their overall circumstances
and family histories for social and psychological factors which may have
an effect on their health.
A valuable tool to research is the Aberdeen Maternity and Neonatal
Databank, set up by Sir Dugald Baird in 1948, which records the
obstetric history of Scottish women (now spanning three generations) and
which may be used, for example, to see if certain problems such as low
birth weight or delivery complications are repeated from mother to
daughter.
Although rare in the West, the idea of a longitudinal approach is
already established in developing countries, due to the fact that
medical information about people is generally gleaned by comprehensive
community health surveys, rather than via health services, which may not
be accessible to most of the population.
Herself the mother of two toddlers -- Alice (3) and Florence (16
months) -- she can fully appreciate the problems women face during
pregnancy and birth. As a petite woman who was pregnant in her mid-30s,
she believes that had she given birth while working in Africa, she might
never have survived the ordeal.
''Both my daughters were delivered in England by Caesarean section and
I was very aware that had I been living somewhere like rural West
Africa, for example, where maternal deaths are common when there is
prolonged and obstructed labour and no access to medical facilities, I
might have ended up as one of my own maternal mortality statistics.''
Closer to home, Dr Graham is critical of long waiting times,
inadequate staffing levels and a slightly bullying attitude towards
breastfeeding in certain hospitals. She is also disappointed by
inadequate childcare facilities and the negative attitudes of employers
to the professional woman who wants to take time out for motherhood and
resume her career where she left off.
She admits she has sometimes found it hard to combine motherhood with
a full-time job which has involved extensive travelling.
''I went through a phase where I wanted to stop, because I felt I was
missing out. Many women share this daily agony of wondering if what they
are doing is right for their children and blaming themselves.''
She believes this guilt shared by working mothers is a form of stress
which may be detrimental to their health. Another debilitating factor
she has experienced, and which affects most new mothers, is chronic
fatigue.
''I'd like to see research done on the issue of tiredness. It sounds a
trivial matter, compared with other problems, but it is something which
is dominant in your life. I'm lucky that my husband, Paul, is so
supportive. Many women have to cope with this overwhelming exhaustion on
their own, with several children to look after.''
Seeing Wendy talk with so much vigour, it is hard to imagine such an
enthusiastic person ever being anything but energetic. She is clearly
looking forward to her new position, as she reveals her vision for the
research centre: ''We will be working with women for women. We want to
move beyond this over-medicalised approach; recognise that childbirth is
not an illness and put it in the context of other issues going on in
women's lives. Above all, we want to listen to what women themselves
have to say about these issues.''

Paris, Sunday
FRENCH presidential candidates Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin today
suspended their campaign to prepare for a two-hour televised duel that
may hold the key to the May 7 election.
Chirac, the 62-year-old conservative frontrunner, and Socialist
Jospin, 57, were to spend most of the next three days closeted with
advisers to prepare in minute detail for Tuesday night's debate which
surveys said could sway a fifth of voters.
Live televised duels, a tradition in French presidential elections,
have proved to be a formidable hurdle in which a one-liner can break a
candidate or make a president.
Playing on each other's nerves, both candidates, asked what they
wished their opponent, told the weekly Journal du Dimanche:
''Serenity''.
Chirac went into the last week to the run-off buoyed by solid
conservative support and a consistent lead estimated by the last
permitted opinion polls at 54 to 55% to Jospin's 45 to 46%.
The conservative camp, split over the failed first-round challenge of
fellow-Gaullist Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, re-united behind Chirac
at the weekend at a mass reconciliation rally in the Paris Bagatelle
park.
Centrists, who had backed Balladur, were prompt to demand a reward for
their support but drew no response from Chirac.
''My objective today is to win . . . we are not yet at the stage of
forming a government,'' Chirac told the Journal du Dimanche.
Short of straightforward endorsement, Jospin won half-hearted backing
from the Greens whose leader Dominique Voynet won 3.3% of the vote last
Sunday.
Rejecting Chirac's policies, the Greens said Jospin had gone some way
towards some of their demands but was shy on others and it would be up
to him to convince ecologists to vote for him.--Reuter.

THE use of National Lottery money to help the National Trust for
Scotland purchase the 77,500-acre Mar Lodge estate on Deeside for the
nation last week was acclaimed on all sides. The Secretary of State for
Scotland offered his congratulations; the Scottish Landowners'
Federation offered its support and promised its members would work hard
with the NTS; the chairman of Scottish Natural Heritage, Magnus
Magnusson, said he was delighted with the acquisition; and the World
Wide Fund for Nature, Scotland, said it was excellent news that Mar
Lodge Estate would no longer be subject to the Russian roulette of the
international property market.
But in the days that have passed since the announcement, certain
misgivings have begun to surface -- some spoken aloud, some whispered in
corners.
Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who is chairman of the National Heritage
Select Committee, was particularly forthright in his comments following
the first award of serious money from the lottery.
While most of the criticism of the Heritage Lottery Fund's committee
was directed at its donation of #13.25m to buy the Winston Churchill
archive, Mr Kaufman found this a more acceptable choice than Mar Lodge.
''At least, whatever they may think about the windfall accruing to
some of the present-day members of the Churchill family, most Britons
have at any rate heard of wonderful Winnie,'' he said.
''Very few, on the other hand, have ever heard of Mar Lodge and not
all that many will ever go there. Yet Mar Lodge is to receive more than
#10m in lottery grants. Mar Lodge is a huge Highland estate. Part of the
money it is receiving will be spent on holiday apartments for
grouse-shooters and deer-stalkers.
''Is this really what lottery ticket-buyers expected when they were
told that a proportion of their stake would go to deserving causes?'' he
added.
As the MP for Manchester Gorton, Mr Kaufman can perhaps be forgiven
for being ignorant of the conservation arguments that have raged about
the importance of the Cairngorms. His colleague, Sam Galbraith, Labour's
spokesman in Scotland on the environment, is not and he was enthusiastic
in his support for the purchase.
Most conservationists are being philosophical in their approach. They
would have preferred the consortium of the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds, WWF, and the John Muir Trust, to have succeeded in
its attempt to buy the estate in 1992. But that was not to be, and they
view the NTS as preferable to a private buyer.
Some, however, are concerned that the National Trust's track record in
managing mountain properties does not leave it best qualified to take
over the stewardship of one of the jewels in the Cairngorms crown. They
point to rows over how the NTS has handled its Ben Lawers and Glencoe
properties, and claims that the trust failed to live up to the wishes of
its benefactor Percy Unna, who insisted that the lands should remain
''no less primitive than they were''.
What, then, will it do with Mar Lodge estate? It certainly has more
money to carry out the job than the consortium would have had if it had
received the #5m it was seeking five years ago from the National
Heritage Memorial Fund.
The NTS says it aims to manage the estate for both conservation and
sporting purposes, although conservation of the natural heritage
qualities of the estate will take priority.
To purchase the property it received #1.5m from lottery funds and #4m
from an anonymous, previously unheard of, trust called the Easter
Charitable Trust. Suspicious minds are already suggesting that it is at
the insistence of this trust that the NTS is continuing to allow field
sports. Some have even suggested that the trust is made up of a small
group of NTS members, committed to the traditional landowner view that
sporting interests must be maintained in the face of growing demands to
ban field sports. There is no proof of this, but the rumour is evidence
of the distrust felt by some conservationists of a body they see as
firmly wedded to establishment interests.
The emergence of the Easter Charitable Trust has done little to allay
the mounting suspicion felt in conservation circles of another,
similarly unknown Trust, the Wills Trust, which bought another prized
Cairngorms estate, Glen Feshie, last year.
Such anonymity merely adds fuel to nationalist politicians who would
like to see a public land register set up. Scottish National Party
environment spokesman Rob Gibson is calling for the people behind these
trusts to be revealed to the public.
''They have to be up-front and public,'' he said.
The NTS also received #8m to set up an endowment fund for the
management of the estate. In addition, it has reached a management
agreement with Scottish Natural Heritage, giving it #170,000 a year for
25 years and also plans to launch a public appeal for help with footpath
repair and other projects. If some feel the trust has more money than
the consortium estimated it needed three years ago -- its annual
expenditure was estimated at #228,000 -- then the NTS would remind them
the estate has an annual deficit of #300,000.
No-one doubts that the estate is badly run down and that deer numbers
need to be drastically reduced. But there are concerns about how the NTS
will go about that task.
A spokesman for the NTS said the organisation would be consulting with
SNH, the Forestry Authority, the Red Deer Commission, and local
deer-management groups. No specific mention of other conservation
organisations, such as the John Muir Trust, or the RSPB, who have
already gained considerable experience in wild land management.
A letter aquired by The Herald shows that two of the foremost experts
and campaigners for conservation and recreational interests in the
Cairngorms, Mr Drennan Watson and Dr Adam Watson, callson the chairman
of the NTS, Mr Hamish Leslie Melville, to form a co-operative group with
other not-for-profit landowners to establish common policies and
management arrangements.
''The NTS has been consistently inactive over Cairngorm issues over
many years and contributed very little if anything to creating the
opportunity that is now being handed to it. Both of us, for example,
have been only too aware of the lack of support from the trust in the
sustained campaign that had to take place to bring matters to the point
where a Cairngorms Working Party was set up.
''The present opportunity has been created by many other
organisations, large and small, who have devoted much time and effort to
protecting the Cairngorms. These organisations have a legitimate claim
to a say on how not only Mar Lodge Estate is managed but also Glen
Feshie Estate, Abernethy, Forest Lodge Estate, and Upper Glen Avon,''
they wrote.
They also warned that the management of Mar Lodge Estate would be a
much more high-profile and publicly scrutinised operation than any other
undertaken by the trust.
The demands for wider co-operation with other bodies and interests
will not go away and the purchase of Mar Lodge for the nation will
impose on it heavier duties than ever before.
Dr Adam Watson said that he would soon be having consultations with a
representative of the estate -- Mr Toby Metcalfe, the factor employed by
the agents Smiths Gore, who factored the estate for its previous
billionaire owner John Kluge.
''It appears that Mr Metcalfe is continuing on the estate and that he
has been asked to carry out extensive consultation with organisations
and individuals,'' said Dr Watson, who added that he was somewhat
surprised that it was not an NTS representative who was carrying out
consultations.
One of Dr Watson's demands will be that the Kluge and Smiths Gore
policy of fencing in trees from deer is discontinued so that the forest
is allowed to expand naturally.
''There is not necessarily a contradiction between having some
shooting and reducing deer numbers to get better conservation of forests
-- but there could be, and that needs to be cleared up,'' he said.
The controversy surrounding the management of Mar Lodge is not over
yet -- only now the public will be demanding a greater say in its
affairs. After all, it has been purchased with the takings from its
lottery tickets.

Bamut, Sunday
GUNS fell largely silent in Chechnya today after weekend clashes, but
Russia's unilateral ceasefire looked shaky after less than three days.
Refugees fleeing Bamut, where Chechen rebels and Russian forces have
fought fiercely in recent weeks, said at least four civilians were
killed yesterday when Russian troops shelled the mountain village in
western Chechnya.
But correspondents who visited Achkoi-Martan, about four miles from
Bamut, said that shooting had died down today, although Russian troops
remained nervous.--Reuter.

Sarajevo, Sunday
THE Bosnian government today rejected a UN plea to extend a battered
ceasefire, offering instead an informal pledge not to attack their Serb
enemies, UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi said.
''We discussed the possibility of extension . . . and I regret the
response we received at this point in time was not positive,'' said
Akashi after talks with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic.
The government refusal was an early setback for Akashi who came to
Sarajevo in a last-ditch attempt to secure some kind of agreement that
might halt a recent rise in the level of fighting across the country.
Akashi said he had not given up hope despite the lack of progress and
arrived late this afternoon at Serb headquarters in Pale, outside
Sarajevo, for discussions with Bosnian Serb leaders. He was accompanied
by the UN commander in Bosnia, British Lieutenant-General Rupert Smith.
UN officials said privately before Akashi's visit that hopes of
extending the four-month truce were slim with the opposition of the
Bosnian government and their separatist Serb foes well known.
The UN hoped it could secure some kind of temporary non-aggression
pact to allow more time for international peace diplomacy to have an
effect. Akashi spoke of a range of options on his arrival at Sarajevo
airport.
However, the Muslim-led Bosnian government seems reluctant to be bound
by even the loosest of commitments. Akashi said the government promised
''maximum restraint'' but that it wished to ''record this attitude
unofficially rather than officially''.
Silajdzic repeated his government's stand that the ceasefire could
only be extended if the Serbs accept an international peace plan
dividing Bosnia which they have repeatedly spurned.
''Talk about extending the ceasefire should not conceal the fact the
Serbs refuse the peace plan. That is the main problem and the main
concern,'' said Silajdzic.
He said the government would restrain its forces from launching
attacks provided the Serbs no longer stopped relief convoys from
reaching his people and halted their bombardments of civilian areas.
The tough caveats placed on the promise reflect a new Bosnian
government confidence that its army is strong enough to deter the
Bosnian Serb military machine once the truce ends at noon tomorrow.
The Bosnian government was also determined not to bow to the frantic
urgings of Western governments to accept a truce extension, seeing in
them another arm of the policy of ''containment'' which seeks to limit
and localise the war.
It regards the threat to withdraw peacekeepers by Western governments
who fear a summer of war as ''blackmail'' to enforce an effective
surrender to the aggression of Serbs who hold 70% of the country.
Silajdzic repeated a long-standing government demand for an end to the
UN arms embargo that limits his army's ability to acquire the heavy
weapons it needs to beat the Serbs. A better equipped Bosnian army is
the quickest route to peace, he said.--Reuter.

Hanoi, Sunday
VIETNAMESE paraded and posed for pictures with their former enemies
today as they celebrated the 20th anniversary of the end of a war that
reunited their country at the cost of more than three million lives.
More than 10,000 soldiers, students, workers and children marched down
a broad, leafy boulevard in Ho Chi Minh City past a reviewing stand
filled with the top government and Communist Party leaders.
Communist tanks rolled down the same road on April 30, 1975, to smash
through the gates of the South Vietnamese presidential palace and seize
power from the last remaining officials of the US-allied government.
Most Americans had fled the city only hours earlier in a desperate
helicopter evacuation.
But there were no recriminations against the United States, with which
Vietnam now seeks diplomatic and trade ties. Mayor Truong Tan Sang
opened the ceremonies by praising the patriotism that led so many to
their death, but never once mentioned the United States.
In the capital of Hanoi, meanwhile, people lined up for a mile to pay
respects at the mausoleum of former revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh.
* Two men stood quietly today by the Vietnam War Memorial in
Washington on the 20th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, a day barely
noticed in the United States.
Official Washington let the day slip by unmarked, a small band of
about two dozen Vietnamese gathered near the memorial. They mingled with
tourists and veterans who came to stand before the black granite wall on
which the names of the 58,200 Americans who died in southeast Asia are
etched.--AP/Reuter.

BY May 29, 1992, Scotland had settled into the early summer of a
heatwave; a country enjoying the foreign pleasure of going to work
without a jacket. That day Amanda Duffy decided to put on her Doris Day
look, a pretty, old-fashioned, button-through dress which she wore with
flat, black, peep-toed sandals and a little boxy handbag borrowed from
Angela, her sister.
She pulled her hair back into a top knot so that her natural curls had
all but disappeared, but no matter how she dressed that hair, the colour
of it shimmered in the light. Glinting like beaten copper, Amanda's hair
was famous in her circle; at first glance her most spectacular feature.
The previous Monday a professional photographer had taken a portrait of
her with hundreds of tiny ringlets spilling about her face as if she
were an early film star. Not Doris Day, this time but Clara Bow.
Amanda had laughed about that photograph. It wasn't her, she said, or
even how she dreamed herself to be, but it was a good shot for her
drama-course portfolio. And the family laughed about it too; all that
ethereal glamour decking out someone they knew as the noisiest creature
in the house.
Later that Friday, home from her studies at Motherwell College, she
took Tillie, the family dog, for a walk and changed into a teenager's
more typical pub gear: a loose silk shirt over a black top and leggings.
Because she had run out of control mousse, Amanda kept her hair pinned
up except for a few stray curls dangling over the ears. She was 19 and
5ft 2in, and had never had a serious boyfriend. ''Boys,'' she said,
''they're naive.'' Anyway, she was going to be independent because she
wanted to be an actress. Amanda had a talent for the theatre; the
college and everyone in her large extended family of 53 had come to know
that. When she was seven she had written a play, a fairytale called 1001
Smarties.
Amanda went out only on Saturdays but this week was different for she
had just received a letter calling her to an audition the following week
at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow. So she was
off to celebrate with three friends and Angela, but at the last minute
Angela opted to stay at home, remembering that taxi drivers had a rule
about not carrying more than four passengers. Yet, if only . . . Those
words are the dry sob in any conversation with the Duffys. If only this
. . . if only that . . . there are a thousand things, beyond Angela's
blameless decision, which swell if only with agonising yearning. Day or
night, over and over again that phrase seeks a reprieve from the
unthinkable. But for almost three years the unthinkable has been a
rampaging sorrow ripping every aspect of this family's life.
Amanda never returned that night. According to friends the group had
started to make its way home around 12.30am, joining a taxi queue near
the shopping precinct in Hamilton's town centre. There Amanda had met
Frankie Auld whom she had known at school. He was 20, an unemployed
mechanic and a body-building enthusiast, and Amanda had left the queue
to chat with him, the two of them walking away beyond her friends' line
of vision.
The following evening at 8.20 a passerby found Amanda in shrubland
near the precinct's local car park, her violated body naked from the
waist up, her face, beneath that radiant hair so savagely mutilated it
was scarcely recognisable.
According to the pathologist she had died around 7.30 that morning.
Joe and Kate Duffy, her parents, had reported her absence at 10am to the
police but as Amanda was an adult they suggested that the Duffys phone
around her friends, and then the various hospitals in case there had
been an accident.
Kate Duffy, from the information she had gathered from her daughter's
pals, attempted to retrace Amanda's sudden, unplanned journey, a route
which by 2pm had taken the mother to the car park. There, just yards
from her, in the thick greenery of that premature summer, Amanda lay
still undiscovered, but from the very start of this nightmare Kate Duffy
says she and her husband sensed the worst of outcomes. By 3pm the police
were at their door in the Meikle Ernock neighbourhood of Hamilton,
accepting by then that enough time had elapsed to classify Amanda as a
missing person.
On May 30, the weather was hotter than ever, a stifling lack of air
making the Duffys' anguish all the more intense. Looking now at that
snap of Amanda in her Doris Day outfit, taken at the college on the day
before she died, Kate remembers the top of her daughter's arms had
caught the sun and were smarting. She was a partial albino with only
six-twenty vision, but she had grown so adept at disguising her poor
eyesight that no stranger would guess her difficulty in recognising
anyone sitting at the far end of the room.
For the photograph she had removed her light-sensitive spectacles and,
just like everyone else that day, was squinting into the sun. But the
photograph of Amanda which the public came to know was not the one she
would have chosen to share. She is in her turquoise bridesmaid's frock
at the wedding of her elder sister, Lynne. There are flowers in her hair
and the slight squint is just discernible, giving her a certain
wistfulness which she loathed.
Before and after the trial in which Frankie Auld stood charged with
her murder, this picture, collected by the police that Saturday, became
a symbol of common mourning, one more terrible reminder of the
unthinkable, the monstrous force that destroys a life in grotesque and
primitive rage.
At Glasgow High Court in the November following the crime the case
against Auld was found not proven, although he had admitted to part of
the charge, that of inflicting a wound to Amanda's right nipple. A love
bite, he had told the police. But among her many injuries this one was
so severe the pathologist had said it would have been excruciatingly
painful.
If that was so, her family asks, would Amanda have been able to go off
with another man, as Auld had claimed? Her bra, found near the body had
shown no traces of blood. And this second man, Joe Duffy asks, who
allegedly knew his daughter and had called to her when she and Auld were
together, how with her poor vision and in such pain, would she have
recognised him?
Twenty brown hairs, snagged on a tree branch next to the body, were
found to match Auld's own. The denim jacket he was seen wearing that
night has never been found. He claimed that he took it off while
climbing trees on his way home later that night, and as a result he had
lost it. Auld declined to give evidence during the trial but recordings
of his interrogation were played to the jury.
When police first saw Amanda's body the barbarism of the assault made
them think it was a ritualistic killing. During the trial the Duffys had
avoided court on the day of the pathologist's evidence, because they
wanted to protect the entire family, defending them each day from the
horror of the facts. But last August Joe and Kate forced themselves to
read the trial transcript in order to be able to proceed with their
civil action against Auld. In those pages they found more terrible
truths: Amanda's nose and jaw were smashed. Twigs and branches had been
thrust into her mouth, one with such ferocity it had pierced the brain
and penetrated her skull.
Today no pain remains more convulsing than the knowledge of the
pathologist's estimated time of death -- 7.30am -- for within that
impersonal record there is the terrible conclusion that Amanda may have
lain dying for several hours, whimpering in agony even, while the nearby
car park turned into the usual desert waste of a Saturday at dawn. The
impact of reading that transcript was like tearing bandages off raw
wounds. Because of stress Kate had to give up the job she loved at an
electronics company. Joe, a mineral water salesman, says they have
refused all medication because no medicine can take away the pain.
But if any of the family manages to gain two unbroken hours of sleep
at night it is a miracle. ''Regardless of whom we think is guilty,'' Joe
Duffy says, ''the person who murdered Amanda is still walking free. It's
an open file and there are no further police investigations. Our civil
action isn't connected in any way to the campaign to abolish the
not-proven verdict. In fact, that campaign won't help us. But after the
trial we knew that this was our last resort; we have to honour Amanda by
seeking justice through the only way that's left.''
The price, however, retards any possibility of personal healing,
although the Duffys, like all such sufferers, insist normality, anyway,
has for them been lost forever. ''We have been advised that this action
could cost us between #30,000 and #50,000. We don't have that kind of
money but it doesn't matter. We bought this house 10 years ago and it
has risen in value because of the improvements we've carried out. So, if
we have to, we'll sell it to pay the costs because when something like
this happens, material possessions mean nothing. Time means nothing.''
It is only a few years later that you realise the finality of murder.
Joe Duffy says that up to that you operate in numbness. ''Somehow I lost
two years of my grandson's life because of this. I just don't remember
the child being two or three.''
The pursuit of the civil action, suing Francis Auld for the ''loss of
society'' of Amanda, was a family decision. ''People think it is only
the parents who suffer,'' says Kate, ''but Amanda was a vital spark to
everyone who knew her: to her sisters and Paul, her brother, who still
can't bring himself to speak about her; to her grandparents who've been
destroyed by this, and to all her friends. We all need rehabilitating
into society, but victim support groups don't know how to deal with
murder victims' families.
''It is only now that I realise I should have insisted on being
allowed to be with Amanda after her body was found. But the police said
no. I know this was partly to protect us, and partly for their own
reasons, but I would have accepted it if the body had remained covered,
and I could have just held her hand. You need to be on your own with
your child. Otherwise you never have the chance to say goodbye and that
is the most terrible thing. It halts the grieving process.''
Much of Joe's anger is also directed at the obscure language of
justice, its intimidating pomp and confusion for lay people suddenly
pulled into its machine.
''Why do they use a vocabulary that went out with Charles Dickens? The
Scottish legal system is said to be the best in the world, but I've only
ever heard that claim from the Scottish legal profession itself.
''Wrongful convictions can be appealed against but what about victims
and their families who feel there has been a wrongful acquittal? We
shouldn't have to resort to a civil action, but for us there is no
appeal.''
Birthdays, Christmas, a sunlit day, even the sight of woods in the
countryside . . . such are the simple joys which have hardened into
blades of sorrow for the Duffys. Kate and Joe had a full social life --
she, a member of a darts team, he playing five-a-side football three
times a week. Now, if they leave their house in the evening they feel
guilty that they're not at home for Angela and Paul. And they have lost
their little mongrel, Tillie, to another family because for months after
the murder, the dog would sit nowhere else but in the porch, waiting and
pining for Amanda's return from college.
''She was a blether, Amanda,'' says Kate. ''But she was very trusting.
She would say to us: 'I want to be up there on a stage because that way
you can be anything you choose, and no-one can hurt you.' She was always
encouraging everyone to live for today but even so she wasn't a girl
with lots of confidence in herself.''
Each person responds to bereavement in a private, hidden way. For Joe,
Amanda's slaying has shattered his Catholicism, forcing him into a cold,
lonely questioning of God. For Kate, a convert, it has both shaken and
deepened her faith. The only moment she feels tranquil is during her
daily visits to Amanda's grave, tending it with fresh flowers, cleaning
the headstone, chatting to her dead daughter about the small importance
of the normal world.
On the wall in the Duffys' sitting room there is a copy of a prayer
Amanda sent to a girlfriend whose father had died. The first line reads:
Death is nothing at all. But as you look at Kate and Joe, stoved in by
sleeplessness and grief, you fear they may be irrevocably broken. With
terrifying ease, murder robbed them of a daughter, and they will never
know how to be at peace with her bright, unfinished life.
Wrongful convictions can be appealed against but what about victims
and their families who feel there has been a wrongful acquittal? We
shouldn't have to resort to a civil action, but for us there is no
appeal

Kigali, Sunday
VILLAGERS beat to death 14 Hutus who had returned home to southern
Rwanda a year after a campaign of ethnic killing, UN officials said
today.
Others were stripped and humiliated.
''They were stoned and beaten to death in the village of Huye, 100
others were forced to flee into the bush while women were subjected to
indignities such as walking without their clothes,'' said Fernando del
Mundo, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
Del Mundo said the killings took place in Huye, near the southern town
of Butare on Thursday. The violence followed the slaughter of thousands
of Hutus by Tutsi government troops in the Kibeho refugee camp last
Saturday.
Reports also indicated 2000 Hutus had been arrested during a
government operation to disperse refugees from camps in the last week,
he said.
In Rwandan villages, Tutsis remember how last year Hutu soldiers and
militias slaughtered between 500,000 and a million Tutsis and moderate
Hutus before they were driven into exile.
Del Mundo said 4000 Hutus had fled to neighbouring Burundi, with 2000
of them moving on to the Zairean town of Uvira. About 250,000 Hutus were
dispersed from the southwestern camps.
Government spokeswoman Christine Umutoni denied knowledge of the
killings but confirmed some arrests had been carried out.
''I know some people have been arrested for being suspected
participants in last year's genocide but I have no information on anyone
killed or forced to march naked,'' she told Reuters.
Rwanda's filthy and diseased prisons are already crammed with more
than 30,000 accused over last year's mass slaughter.
News of the killings broke out shortly after UN special envoy Aldo
Ajello chided the government for cutting off water and food to nearly
1000 Hutus still holed up at Kibeho camp.--Reuter

New York, Sunday
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton, accusing Iran of being the top exporter of
terrorism, said tonight he was cutting off all trade and investment with
the country by US firms, including more than $4000m in annual oil
purchases.
''My decision to impose this trade and investment embargo makes clear
our unrelenting determination to do all that we can to arrest the
behaviour and ambitions of a nation that ranks at the top of the world's
'10 Most Wanted' list,'' Clinton said.
''To do nothing more as Iran continues its pursuit of nuclear weapons
would be disastrous, and to stand pat in the face of overwhelming
evidence of Tehran's support for terrorists would threaten to darken the
dawn of peace between Israel and her neighbours.''
The US contends Iran has been fostering unrest in the Middle East and
in other world trouble spots. It also has been alarmed by deals with
Russia and China which Washington feels would permit Tehran to develop
nuclear weapons.
''I am announcing my intention to cut off all trade and investment
with Iran, and suspend nearly all other economic activity between our
two nations,'' Clinton said in remarks prepared for delivery at a World
Jewish Congress dinner.
He said he was ''convinced that instituting a trade embargo with Iran
is the most effective way our nation can help curb Iran's drive to
acquire devastating weapons and support for terrorist activities''.
American firms are among the top buyers of Iranian oil.
The ban will also involve US exports to Iran, which last year totalled
$326m, most of it involving the sale of industrial equipment and
agricultural products, primarily wheat.
Clinton said he would use the June economic summit of the world's
seven leading industrial nations in Halifax, Canada, to ''urge other
countries to take similar or parallel actions.''
He rejected a proposal now before Congress which would prohibit
foreign firms which do business with Iran from doing business in the
US.--Reuter.

THE Roman Catholic Church in Scotland yesterday confirmed that
Cardinal Thomas Winning is to meet Scottish Secretary Ian Lang today,
but rejected claims that the meeting indicates a closer relationship
with the Tories and a move away from Labour over its pro-abortion
stance.
The Church also denied suggestions that the meeting is designed to
pressurise Labour into changing its position.
It emphasised there was ''no possibility'' of it pledging support for
any political party and said a wide range of issues would be discussed
at the meeting in Edinburgh.
The move follows a weakening of the historic relationship between the
Scottish Catholic Church and Labour and a recent dispute over the
party's decision to ban an anti-abortion stall from its Scottish annual
conference in Inverness for the second year running.
The Conservatives and the SNP are seeking to exploit the rift but
Father Noel Barry, who is Cardinal Winning's press officer, said
yesterday that an invitation to meet Mr Lang had been accepted simply
because this was the first opportunity for such a meeting since he was
created a Cardinal last year.
He said: ''There is absolutely no agenda whatsoever. While the
abortion issue is of fundamental concern to the Catholic Church, there
is a wide range of issues including employment, poverty, and the health
service that are also of concern and will be discussed.
''We are not in the business of suggesting to people how they should
vote, but we are in the business of highlighting issues of concern in
society upon which a Christian voice should be heard.''
Father Barry added: ''My view is that Roman Catholics as much as
anyone else are perfectly capable of making up their own minds. There is
absolutely no possibility of the Church pledging support for any
political party at any time, because no political party has a monopoly
of the truth or wisdom.
''The Catholic Church is not in the business of inducing political
parties. It would be a sad day for the Church if we ever dreamt of
trying to do that.''
However, Father Barry said that with 4,000,000 abortions since the
introduction of the Abortion Act of 1967, it was a matter for serious
concern and would be raised with Mr Lang.
A spokesman for the Scottish Conservative Party said: ''We would
welcome any distancing between the Catholic Church and Labour,
especially with our current standing.''

<TEXT>
THE man nicknamed King Coal, whose company bought most of England's
working mines, was being investigated over his fitness to be a director
at the time of his bid, BBC1's Panorama will claim tonight.
Leading accountants Coopers and Lybrand considered some dealings by
RJB Mining chief executive Richard Budge -- while he was director of
another company AF Budge -- were ''in contravention of the Companies
Act'', the programme will allege.
But President of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine decided not to
take proceedings against Mr Budge.
A month earlier, RJB had been named ''preferred bidder'' in the race
to buy three English regions of British Coal.
Panorama suggests that with no reserve bidder, privatisation could
have been jeopardised if Mr Budge had faced disqualification as a
director.
The programme reports that loans of more than #400,000 to Mr Budge by
AF Budge were discovered by receivers after the company collapsed with
#96m debts.
Administrative receivers Coopers and Lybrand told the DTI's Insolvency
Service that the loan account was ''in contravention of the Companies
Act'', it says.
Mr Budge had used #30,000 a year from the company promotions budget to
finance his racing car hobby, hired a marquee for his son's birthday and
borrowed #10,000 in ''petty cash'', Panorama alleges.
Mr Budge later agreed to pay receivers #325,000 without admission of
liability.
Mr Budge's brother Tony, sister-in-law Janet, and Mr Michael Yates,
all formerly on the AF Budge board, now face court proceedings to
disqualify them as directors, but Mr Budge and other former directors do
not.
AF Budge, initially a construction firm, diversified widely, investing
in a yacht in the Caribbean, racehorses, and even a Scud missile. It
lost millions on London Docklands property deals in the 1980s.
In 1992, Mr Richard Budge bought AF Budge's mining arm for #57.4m and
formed RJB Mining, later floated as RJB Mining plc.
The 47-year-old chief executive earns #290,000-a-year, plus bonuses.

CONFUSION surrounds the future of the air traffic control centre at
Prestwick Airport.
Newspaper reports yesterday claimed Ministers had dropped plans to
privatise the centre. But a Department of Transport spokesman said the
Government was still committed to privatising the National Air Traffic
Services (Nats).
His comments were at odds with remarks made by Conservative Ayr MP, Mr
Phil Gallie, whose constituency includes the airport.
Mr Gallie said there had been a clear move away from privatisation,
which the Government now regarded as a long-term possibility rather than
a firm policy proposal.
Mr Gallie said transport leaders had decided to pay for the new centre
by allowing private developers to invest money, rather than issuing
shares. He said the decision was an important development that would
protect around 1000 Prestwick staff.
But the DoT spokesman said suggestions that privatisation had been
shelved were ''speculation''.
He added: ''The Government is still committed to privatising Nats. We
have gone out to consultation on the proposals and will consider the
results of that before announcing the way forward.''
Meanwhile, Labour MPs and air traffic controllers said the uncertainty
should be cleared up.
Mr Doug Maclean, public relations officer for the Institution of
Professionals, Managers and Specialists (IPMS) and himself an air
traffic controller, said privatisation could jeopardise safety.
But he warned that using private finance to build, equip, and run a
new centre would also cause problems.
He said: ''I knew a Cabinet decision on this was likely to be made
soon and I wouldn't be surprised if they have dropped privatisation.''
He said the centre was self-financing -- making millions of pounds a
year in fees from air operators -- and could afford privately to borrow
the money required.
Mr Maclean added: ''One way or another we would like to see a public
announcement that privatisation has been dropped because, if nothing
else, it would clarify the situation for 5500 Nats staff in the UK who
do not know what is going to happen.''

<HEADLINE>US lawyers offer Scottish parents no-win no-fee assistance against chemicals giant.  Pesticides blamed for eye defects</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>978616592</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE families of seven children born with a rare eye deformity are
seeking large compensation payments from the makers of pesticide sprays
used on the farmland around them.
The children were all born within a few miles of each other in
North-east Fife. Their parents are demanding a health board
investigation into what they claim is a cluster of cases.
The parents believe that the rare disorder is linked to two pesticide
sprays and they are backing a test case against Dupont, the US chemical
giant.
The case will be heard before a Florida grand jury later this year
and, if successful, could could lead to substantial compensation
pay-outs.
The children, all living within a 15-mile radius of Ladybank in rural
Fife, were born either without eyes or with only partially developed
eyes.
An average of 10 babies a year are born in Britain with the conditions
known as anopthalmia or micropthalmia in which the eyes have stopped
devloping in the foetus.
In Scotland there is understood to be a total of 12 cases but in Fife
alone there are seven cases: six in the Ladybank area and in one in
nearby St Andrews.
Five-year-old Jonathan Attenborough was born near the Fife village of
Newburgh with partially developed eyes in November 1989.
On the same day a baby girl was born with the same rare condition 10
miles away.
The previous year, another baby was born in the same village with
partially developed eyes after her mother had gone potato picking during
pregnancy.
Jonathan is blind in his right eye and only partially sighted in his
left eye.
His father, Peter, is the Scottish spokesman for the Micro and
Anopthalmic Children's Society which has been set up to fight for the
children.
He said: ''We don't know what the future will hold for Jonathan. He
could go blind altogether as his left eye will be prone to glaucoma and
a detached retina.''
But Mr Attenborough, of Mugdrum Place, Newburgh, is optimistic about
the outcome of the US court case. ''There is just too much coincidence
in these cases. The American lawyers are happy to work on a no-win
no-fee basis.
''We are confident that we can win and that we will see mid-Atlantic
compensation settlements adjusted to suit each case, just like Piper
Alpha.
''We are claiming that two pesticides -- Benlate and Carbendazim --
are the culprits. That is what we hope to prove in Florida.
''We lived on a farm near here when Jonathan was conceived. The mother
of the girl born the same day used to pass the same fields on her way to
work.
''We thought it was the perfect environment to bring up children. We
never thought for a minute that the tractors spraying the fields might
affect the sight of our unborn son.''

<HEADLINE>Inquiry after region blocks #15m 'shopping village'</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978616593</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
.
A PUBLIC inquiry is to be held into plans for a #15m ''shopping
village'' outside Stirling.
The plan, by British-American consortium BAA McArthur/Glen, was turned
down by Central Regional Council in December by a single vote, after
warnings that the ''shopping village'' would hit trade in the nearby
town centres.
Now, however, the Scottish Office has confirmed that the group has
submitted an appeal and requested a public inquiry.
In contrast to the region's opposition, Tory-controlled Stirling
District Council, due to disappear next year, backs the scheme.
In documents circulated to members of Stirling District Council at the
weekend, Mr Richard Dyet, district planning officer, says the Scottish
Office has asked whether the authority wants to take part in the
inquiry.
He adds: ''In view of the support given by the district to this
proposal it is recommended that the council participates.''
The development, at the junction of the M80 and M9 motorways at
Pirnhall, would feature 50 small stores for lease to desginer-label
manufacturers, including Gucci, Armani, and Yves St Laurent, selling
surplus goods and seconds at discounts.
BAA McArthur/Glen says the village would directly employ up to 400
people, plus many more in spin-off jobs, and boost the economy of
Central Scotland by up to #4.5m a year. Additionally, some 200 people
would be employed building the village.
Consultants employed by the region, however, have calculated that
shops in Stirling town centre would lose turnover of #14m a year while
Falkirk could lose #6m.
Regional planning officials have said that the location of the
proposed development is also a problem -- it is not well placed for
public transport, and would breach both regional and national planning
guidelines.
Insiders say the timing of the appeal may result from the Tories'
drubbing at the local elections.
There would have been little point in going to the trouble of a public
inquiry if planning was being taken over next year by a Conservative
administration of sympathetic former district councillors.
Instead, BAA McArthur Glen will be faced from next April with a
Stirling council won by Labour on a strongly pro-environment manifesto.
Council leader Corrie McChord promised last week the council would be
''greener'' than its predecessors.
South of the Border, Environment Secretary John Gummer has generally
opposed out-of-town developments. Green campaigners will be keen to see
if Scottish Secretary Ian Lang follows Mr Gummer's lead, or whether the
claims of a substantial number of new jobs will swing the balance in
favour of the development.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair's comfortable victory for his constitutional
reforms at the weekend was a personal triumph forged not so much by
winning union backing as by harnessing the support of the
constituencies.
By way of a series of some 30 debates and the use of thousands of
questionnaires followed up by ballots in most of the 639 constituency
Labour parties, the Blair camp has transformed the CLPs from their
traditional Bennite role into staunch leadership supporters.
As a result 27% of the CLPs' 30% share of the conference vote went the
leader's way, giving him a cushion against any union backlash.
Thanks to a last-minute decison by the MSF delegation, modernisers
actually won a majority in the trade union section which carries a total
of 70% of the conference vote.
With the union section dividing 38.23% to 31.77% in Mr Blair's favour
he ended up with a healthy 65.23% endorsement of his aims and values.
The biggest trade union, Unison, stuck to its guns as expected and
voted against the revised constitution. But much to the chagrin of Blair
supporters so did the largest affiliate, the Transport and General
Workers Union, giving the antis a 25% base load from which to start.
At a one-and-a-half hour pre-conference meeting the 75 strong TGWU
delegation decided (with only seven or eight votes against) to stand by
their national executive's recommendation to oppose the constitutional
changes.
In doing so they ignored pleas from national secretary Jack Dromey and
endorsed the executive line put by general secretary Bill Morris.
Mr Morris, who is facing an electoral challenge from Mr Dromey, is in
fact understood to favour the revised constitution, but is bound by
executive policy.
Mr Dromey, moderniser and husband of Shadow Employment Secretary
Harriet Harman, maintains that he would have recommended a membership
ballot had he been general secretary.
As it was the TGWU's vote, worth 14.13% of the total, was cast on the
strength of replies from 67 of the union's 7000 branches. They were the
only ones to respond to requests for views.
Mr Morris, who addressed the conference ''with a heavy heart'', said
later that the outcome was ''a good result''.
Far more combative was Unison's associate general secretary, Mr Rodney
Bickerstaff, who, despite being another union leader overturned by his
policy-making body, made Unison's case most effectively.
Stung by heavy criticism from some of Mr Blair's aides for not
delivering the Unison vote, and keenly aware that he is soon to contest
an election to decide who should succeed general secretary Alan
Jinkinson, he went on the attack.
Why, he asked, were only those unions which opposed the changes
castigated for not holding ballots?
What about the fact that by not holding ballots several millions of
pounds had been saved for campaigning for Labour at the forthcoming
General Election?
And perhaps there should be balloting on the level of the proposed
national minimum wage.
He declared his belief that the late John Smith would have led Labour
to power without altering Clause 4, and ended with the words: ''I oppose
change but support the party.''
The 21-14 pre-conference vote for Mr Blair by MSF delegates who met in
the basement of the conference venue, the Methodist Central Hall in
Westminster, assured Mr Blair of overall victory as well as a majority
in the union section.
In addition to the TGWU (14.1%) and Unison (11.7%) those who opposed
the changes included the RMT and Aslef rail unions, the National Union
of Mineworkers, and the Fire Brigades' Union.
Unions backing Mr Blair included the GMB (12.1%), the AEEU (8.7%), the
shopworkers Usdaw (5%), the CWU communications workers (4.6%), and the
MSF (3.85%).
Voting in the union section was fairly close but the apparent
transformation of the CLPs from left-wing activists kept at bay by the
marshalling of union block votes to ardent Blair-supporting modernisers
could herald further moves to reduce union influence.
There are already outline plans to reduce the union share of
conference votes down from 70% towards 50% as individual party
membership climbs, but that will probably not begin until after the
election.
Before then union influence on the Labour Party executive is likely to
be diluted not by cutting union representatives but by adding local
authority representives.
The final coup de grace would not come until after a Labour election
victory. Then, after using millions of pounds of trade union money, a
Labour government is expected to act swiftly to phase out dependence on
unions by introducing State funding of political parties.

A HIGHLAND laird is set to stalk the stalls of the Chelsea Flower Show
later this month in search of daffodils.
Mr Ninian Brodie, the 25th laird Brodie of Brodie, aims to track down
more than 300 lost varieties and restore them to their original home at
Brodie Castle, near Nairn, Morayshire.
''The castle is famous for miles around for the daffodils but there
are not nearly as many as there used to be'', said Mr Brodie.
''There are over 300 types which have gone missing from the grounds
for one reason or another.''
The castle's flower fame began in the 1890s, when the 24th laird,
Major Ian Brodie, began the collection which he built up until his death
in 1943. He named many new varieties and distributed them to garden
enthusiasts.
Now only 125 varieties grow at Brodie, which the National Trust for
Scotland bought for #405,000 in 1978.
The trust's head of gardens, Mr Duncan Donald, said:
''I have a list of Brodie-bred flowers to compare any of those which
are tracked down.''
Among the varieties he is anxious to trace are those with orange or
orange-red cups or trumpets such as, Pera, Mr Jinks, and Gallipoli.

UNOFFICIAL celebrations for VE Day will be muted in Scotland where one
leading flagmaker said yesterday he had sold only three Union Jack flags
since March.
''It's very much an English thing,'' said Mr Ian Cartledge, a partner
in I D Signs of New Stevenston, which sells flags made by a sister
company in England.
''The Union Jack is seen very much as an English flag anyway, and I
think there might be a polital aspect -- Scotland is more of a
left-wing-motivated country,'' he said.
''I can't give you a logical explanation, but the announcement of the
celebrations came from John Major, and it seems to be too closely
associated with the Government.
''Our sister company in England is selling them like there's no
tomorrow, but I always thought from day one that there would be little
interest in Scotland, and I've been proved right.''
One of the three Union Jack flags sold is for a street party in
Dumfries, and a second is for a similar event in Stranraer. Mr Cartledge
does not know the destination of the third.
In the same period, he has sold more than 60 saltires, but as far as
he knows none was for street parties.
Despite the lack of spontaneous street celebrations, several official
events are being staged in Scotland.
On Sunday, commemoration services are to be held at Glasgow Cathedral
and Elgin Cathedral in Morayshire.
Monday sees the main commemoration service at Edinburgh's St Giles
Cathedral, attended by the Princess Royal.
The biggest VE parade outside London takes place in Perth on May 13
when 500 massed pipes and drums will be joined by hundreds of veterans
for a march.

CAMPAIGNERS fighting to save the West Highland sleeper service will
add a new weapon to their armoury this week with the publication of a
report which shows the service is only losing a fraction of what BR and
Ministers have claimed.
The report, by Edinburgh-based rail consulants Pieda, is to be
published tomorrow. However, The Herald understands that it will explode
as myth the official statistics which say that each passenger is
subsidised by as much as #453.
The report into the service, which is due to be axed on May 28,
suggests the costs have been rigged to allow a mercy killing and that in
reality the real figure is #70 a passenger. That figure is similar to
the subsidies paid to many rural lines in England and Wales.
The report, it is understood, says that if the sleeper service is
withdrawn the savings will be far less than predicted and that the
future of the line would be placed in jeopardy.
The saving from axing the service would be only #2.4m, according to
the report.
News of the report came on the same day as speculation mounted that
businessman Richard Branson could take over the service. Mr Branson was
preparing to take the sleeper train from Fort William to London last
night.
He wants to find out how the service is run and what passengers feel
about it. He believes the idea of such a service is romantic and that
there is a public demand for it.
The sleeper service would be run by London Continental Railways of
which Mr Branson's Virgin group is a partner.
The consortium is also competing to build the Channel Tunnel rail link
and run the Eurostar service between London and Europe. If successful,
Mr Branson has said more sleeper services would be introduced between
British cities and Europe.
Both moves were welcomed last night by Friends of the West Highland
Line which has been campaigning to reverse ScotRail's decision to axe
the service.
A spokesman said the Pieda report backed the group's findings. He
added: ''Our figures show the real subsidy to be even lower at #43 a
head.''
He added: ''There is a hope that Richard Branson may step in. We're in
touch with him and we think his interest is genuine.''
The clout the new report will give campaigners was also welcomed by
the Railway Development Society.
Mr Ken Sutherland, the society's research officer, said: ''What BR is
doing is using fantasy figures. The sum of #450 is highly inflated. With
these figures you could give every passenger a butler and a personal
assistant. The train itself would need to run on gold-plated rails.''

ONE conference, one vote, and now, at last, one leader who has
succeeded in seeing off the party's Luddites and jettisoning Labour's
unfashionable past. Where Gaitskell failed, and his successors failed to
try, Tony Blair has cut the moorings. Clause 4 is dead -- long live the
art of stage management.
The final result was never in any doubt. Do not be fooled by the
anaemic green corporate colours: New Pistachio Labour is an altogether
more ruthless and more organised animal than its red predecessor. On
Saturday it proved it is ready to do what is necessary to make itself
electable.
Six months after stunning the party with his decision to spring-clean
the constitution and throw out its historical commitment to wholesale
nationalisation, Tony Blair had the satisfaction of hearing an emphatic,
vindicating result -- 65.23% for, 34.77% against. Yet another obstacle
to power removed.
It took two-and-a-half hours to get through the formalities.
Days earlier a Labour official, asked what scope there was for the
defenders of old Clause 4 to influence the conference, was not entirely
kidding when he said: ''Hang on -- Stalin isn't completely dead.'' The
script would not allow for surprises.
But the choice of venue made the past impossible to hide. New Labour
returned to Methodist Central Hall in Westminster where, in 1918, a year
after the Russian revolution, Old Labour signed up to the public
ownership of the means of ''production, distribution, and exchange''. On
Saturday the television-friendly pistachio backdrop could not mask the
floor-to-ceiling organ and the gilded plaster ornamentation that
witnessed the adoption of Sydney Webb's ideals.
Seventy-seven years later, the Soviet Union's remaining fans in the
party were on hand, but their participation was limited to a few brief
speeches. Instead they were there to undergo a public humiliation, a
symbolic stripping of epaulettes and breaking of swords. And
democratically achieved at that. A delighted Adam Ingram, MP for East
Kilbride, pointed out: ''Stalin shot his opponents -- we just persuade
them.''
Tony Blair's speech was everything it needed to be: impassioned, well
argued, and brief. The extent of the consultation, and the numbers that
took part, allowed him to claim with pride that he was a leader in step
with his party. He attacked the Tories, and the BBC for giving up under
pressure its plans to broadcast the conference: ''The BBC says it's
something to do with snooker. Great game. Fifteen reds for every blue.
Sounds like the local election results.''
He was interrupted by applause at least 20 times, but his analysis of
where Labour had gone wrong was received in silence.
He cited the example of a Glasgow woman met on his tour of the country
and her struggle to raise children in an estate ruined by drugs and
unemployment. '' 'Do something for us,' she pleaded. She's not a Tory;
she's Labour. And it's high time we were back as the party speaking up
for her and a million like her.''
There was little need to sit in the hall and listen to the rest. The
acoustics were bad, the contributions predictable, and the outcome in no
doubt. Arthur Scargill tried to delay the conference and was
slow-clapped into silence. Union leaders tried to justify their decision
to vote against change and failed; and a string of Blairites, marked by
their well-cut suits, said what a neat thing democracy was.
Instead, the life of the conference moved to the corridors.
The delegates filled the air with smoke and gossip; Neil Kinnock shook
hands; a Spanish journalist took the absence of espresso and the
dominance of milky tea as evidence that New Pistachio Labour still has a
long way to go; and those who found it all too much drifted out towards
the pubs, past the beefy stewards calmly keeping the red flag and silly
pamphlet brigade firmly out on the pavement.
The Scots MPs present were in self-congratulatory mode. John McFall
from Dumbarton wore a pistachio blazer -- no doubts what he voted for;
Eric Clarke from Midlothian, cigar-chewing, pro-change, and
self-confessed member of the hairy-arsed wing of the party, rejoiced in
the ruthlessness of it all: ''We've always known how to keep the left
out of these conferences.''
Even Donald Dewar, whose Garscadden constituency was the only one in
Scotland to vote to retain Clause 4, took pride in the fact that at
least it had balloted. Other constituencies in Glasgow (step forward
Maryhill) hadn't.
The debate's final speaker was the hero of the Scottish conference,
Cunninghame North MP Brian Wilson. When the chair announced it could
''squeeze him in'', everyone recognised a fix.
Tony Blair wanted him to speak, and justifiably so. Where others had
tiptoed, he put the boot in, withering in his attack on the left's
claims that the party was a flock of sheep following its leader's gang
of one.
The left had failed to address why so many people in the party had
voted for change. ''Those who voted for change are not cabbages and they
are not sheep. We are not so much a party of one as one hell of a party.
Gangs of one do not hold consultation exercises involving thousands of
people,'' he said.
By the end the applause from those in favour of change began to sound
annoyed, as if by the force of their clapping they might drive out the
sullen minority that had held them back for so long.
Up in the balcony the ranks of Old Labour MPs alongside Tony Benn sat
in sour disapproval, bad losers to the end. Below, New Labour returned
the compliment and turned its collective back on them. A visibly moved
Tony Blair told his party it was a day of destiny. And The Red Flag was
not sung.

AN American lawyer who flew to Scotland to find his Russian girlfriend
and propose to her will travel home today with the engagement ring still
in its box.
Despite walking the streets and plastering posters on lamp posts, Mr
Anthony Penoso failed to track down Miss Vera Plaxina, 27, who he
understood was attending a seminar in Edinburgh.
Mr Penoso, who runs a legal firm in Jacksonville, Florida, will now
have to wait a month before he meets up with the economics professor in
Moscow where he plans a proposal and a return trip to Scotland as soon
as possible.
The 36-year-old lawyer met Miss Plaxina when on holiday in Copenhagen
18 months ago. They wrote to each other and he visited Moscow last
November.
When she told him she was attending the seminar in Edinburgh in a few
months time he said he would meet her.
Miss Plaxina said she would fax details of where she was staying but
on the day she was due to pass them on his fax machine was turned off.
When he telephoned her in Moscow her parents said she had already left.

LORD Thurso, one of Scotland's most prominent land owners, has died.
He was 72.
He had been suffering from emphysema for some time. His condition
worsened ten days ago and the Liberal peer died at his Caithness home on
Saturday afternoon.
Lord Thurso's father was the late Sir Archibald Sinclair, Air Minister
in Sir Winston Churchill's wartime Cabinet and a former leader of the
Parliamentary Liberal Party.
Lord and Lady Thurso established a firm friendship with the Queen
Mother, who visited the Castle of Mey twice a year.
Lord Thurso's heir, the Hon John Sinclair, who runs the East Sussex
National Golf Course, was yesterday flying from France after being
notified of his father's death.
The Lord Lieutenant of Caithness, Lord Thurso controlled 50,000 acres
of sporting lands, farms, and crofts and was also a director of several
companies.
Lord Thurso, who was known locally as Robin Sinclair, also had
property interests and owned the Ulbster Arms sporting hotel in the
village of Halkirk, Caithness.
He was appointed the Queen's representative in 1973 and would welcome
the royal family as it disembarked annually at Scrabster harbour for a
visit to the Queen Mother at the Castle of Mey.
He had already organised arrangements for next week's VE Day
celebrations in Caithness, and was looking forward to welcoming visitors
from Thurso's twin town, Brilon, in Germany.
Lord Thurso was educated at Eton, New College, Oxford, and Edinburgh
University and had been active in the House of Lords where he had been
the Liberal spokesman on aerospace, agriculture, energy, and Scottish
affairs from 1983-88.
He was the founder and first chairman of Caithness Glass in Wick and
he served as a councillor for Thurso burgh and Caithness county from
1949 until the early 1970s.
He unsuccessfully fought East Aberdeenshire as a Liberal in 1966. He
inherited the title as the second viscount in 1970.
Lord Thurso served in the Royal Air Force in the Second World War as a
flight lieutenant, mainly on reconnaissance duties.
Over the years, he held many voluntary offices, including president of
the North Country Cheviot Sheep Society, president of the Association of
Scottish District Salmon Fishery Boards, and president of the Boys'
Brigade.
Lord Thurso is survived by his wife, Margaret, his sons, John and
Patrick, and a daughter, Camilla.
The funeral arrangements have yet to be finalised.

IT seems like a towering breach of good manners. For 40 years, Mr
Hastie Forsyth has lovingly cared for a sixteenth century Border
stronghold. But now Historic Scotland has told him his services are
being taken over by a contractor and written off his efforts in a
three-line letter.
Mr Forsyth, a 78-year-old widower, took over as part-time custodian of
Greenknowe Tower, Berwickshire, in 1955 while he was working as a mason
and bricklayer. His original payment of #32 a year from the old Ministry
of Works has risen to #594.
However, Mr Forsyth pointed out that money was never a factor. He
said: ''I identified with the place and took a lot of pleasure in
keeping it in good order. People who wanted to go round used to have to
call at my house in Gordon and collect the keys. I have a visitors' book
with thousands of names in it from all over the world.''
When Mr Forsyth retired from his full-time job, he offered to retire
as custodian of the tower. But he said: ''They said they wanted to keep
me on until I was 80.''
Now, however, he has received a letter signed by M Forbes,
superintendent of works, saying the grass cutting and maintenance is
being taken over by a public works contractor. The letter offers brief
thanks for Mr Forsyth's 40 years' service and concludes: ''I offer you
my best wishes for the future.''
Mr Forsyth said: ''Forty years is more than half my life and it must
be some sort of a record for this type of job. I am pretty fit and could
have happily carried on for another two years.''
Greenknowe Tower was built by James Seton in 1581 as a refuge for his
family when marauding English headed across the Border into the rich
lands of the Berwickshire Merse.
Now the tower is left open during the day with no-one to tell tourists
the story of its past. Nor will it benefit from Mr Forsyth's nightly
checks and proprietorial pride, although he said he intended to return
from time to time.
A spokesman for Historic Scotland said: ''We did not guarantee to
employ Mr Forsyth until he was 80 but at this stage I cannot go into any
further detail.''

THE Shadow Chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, is to unveil the next stage of
Labour Party modernisation: proposals for a radically reshaped
consumer-led economic policy, with scope for more competition.
In a speech at Westminster, he aims to announce plans to merge the
investigative arms of the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, creating a new body with new powers to root out
monopolies and restrictive practices and fine guilty parties.
Mr Brown will tell business leaders at a meeting of Labour's finance
and industry group: ''A dynamic economy requires a government that is a
champion of consumers.
''I am convinced that the profusion of different decision makers --
the OFT, MMC, Restrictive Practices Court, and the Secretary of State
for Trade and Industry -- impede fast and effective remedial action for
the consumer.
''That is why Labour is considering a new competition and consumer
standards office that replaces two quangos -- the MMC and the OFT -- to
bring together the investigative functions of both.''
The new office would have a presumption in favour of competition.
Labour wanted to achieve a dynamic market economy, while the Tories
were the party of ''vested interests at the expense of competition,
consumers and economic dynamism''.
He said Labour believed that to modernise the economy, government and
industry needed to work together to enable people and firms to succeed:
the Tories believed in a crude form of laissez-faire economics.

Odyssey to 2001
-----------------------------
Those 85+..............Up 20%
Lone parents...........Up 54%
Housing benefit.......Now 63%
In work..............Down 4.7%
Homeless pleas.........Up 121%
Death rate...7% above average
POLICIES pursued by Strathclyde Regional Council during its tenure of
office emerge in figures out today as having been little more than a
sticking plaster on social problems.
The fourth, and final, social trends survey, compiled by Strathclyde,
continues to show a depressing picture of life in the region.
In the past 20 years, poverty has more than doubled and the financial
circumstances of the poor have deteriorated compared with the rest of
the population.
The survey looks at changes and trends in 11 areas: population,
households, housing, employment, unemployment, poverty and incomes,
health, crime and safety, multiple deprivation, education, and social
work.
Only 838,000 people were employed in 1994, a fall of 5.3% from 1981.
Only the service sector saw considerable growth in this period. Between
1991 and 2001, the economically active population is expected to drop by
4.7%.
With a regional unemployment average of 16%, some areas still had a
figure exceeding 40% for male unemployment. In mid-1994, some 44,700
people had been unemployed for more than a year, or 36% of all
unemployed people. Of these, some 37,800 were men.
Taking into account dependants and partners, 23% of the region
population received income support in 1994. More than 63% of tenant
households were receiving housing benefit, taking in 79% of lone parents
and 67% of single elderly people. Both groups were expected to increase
substantially by 2001.
There were 196,750 social work referrals in 1993-1994, an increase of
38,000 from 1991. Community care and welfare benefits/advice were the
largest categories. Between 1990 and 1993, substantial shifts were also
noted in the focus of long-term care for elderly people and other adult
care groups, from hospital provision to care in the community.
In a changing distribution of deprivation, Glasgow and some of the
other built-up areas -- the urban core of the region -- have become
poorer compared to the rest of the region. Glasgow's share of the
working population declined from 38% in 1971 to 31% in 1981, and 26% in
1991.
An analysis of small-area deprivation showed two key trends: an
increasing concentration of the very worst areas in Glasgow, Paisley,
and Greenock/Port Glasgow.
Regional policies had neither prevented nor wholly compensated for the
effects of these trends. But they had managed to make the quality of
life better than it would otherwise have been.
The survey shows a net loss of people from Strathclyde to England,
Wales, and Northern Ireland falling dramatically from a high of 9400 a
year in the 1980s to around 1000 in the 1990s. A drop of 28% in the
18-29 age group is expected by 2001: those aged 85+ are expected to
increase by around 20%.
By 2001, the number of households will rise to 976,200 or an increase
of 49,000 on 1993. Single person and lone parent households will have
increased by 25% and 54% respectively, between 1991 and 2001.
In housing, a ''fundamental shift'' is seen taking place from rented
housing to owner occupation. The period 1981-1993 saw a 121% increase in
homeless applications. Despite substantial improvements to many older
houses and in peripheral and other housing schemes, poor housing
remained a problem for many people.
More than 44% of all primary school children are receiving clothing
grants, with 40 primary schools having 90% or more children getting this
grant.
The attainment levels for O and Standard Grades and Highers continue
to rise. The proportion of pupils staying on at school increased
substantially between 1981-1991, and 38% of school leavers now enter
further or higher education.
In terms of health, the region continues to fare badly. It has the
highest mortality rate of all regions in Scotland, at 7% above the
Scottish average. Some districts have a figure 18% higher than the
average. Despite this, the issue reports considerable improvements in
infant mortality, from changes in obstetric practice and a trend towards
smaller families.
Recorded crimes and offences fell back substantially between 1991-1993
in the region, with a similar pattern in almost every district. The
number of total crimes detected was 31%, only slightly lower than the
34% for the rest of Scotland.
Road accidents and casualties fell dramatically between 1991-1993, and
the number of fire fatalities continued to fall also, with 52 in 1993
compared to 72 in 1991.
Some concern is noted about whether the succeeding unitary authorities
will be able to continue the production and provision of the important
basic data the trends cover.

TAYSIDE Tory Bill Walker continued his campaign for change in party
policies over the weekend, and in a television interview yesterday
claimed Scottish Conservatives were ''going down the chute''.
Spurning his leaders' attempts to find consensus, and overshadowing
today's launch of the agenda for next week's conference in Glasgow, he
declared: ''We've got to stop being seen as a London-orientated party
led by what my own supporters have called Scottish Tory toffs with
English-sounding voices.''
In an extraordinary series of pronouncements, Mr Walker implied that
Tory leaders in Scotland and Westminster should step aside, and raised
publicly for the first time a question mark over his party's
contradictory stance over elected forums in Belfast and Edinburgh.
Meanwhile, Mr Struan Stevenson, the prospective Conservative candidate
for Dumfries, yesterday called on disaffected Tories in Scotland not to
create a ''bloodbath'' at the annual conference, by using the occasion
to voice publicly their concerns about its unpopularity and criticise
the leadership.
While the leadership held crisis meetings in Edinburgh and Glasgow in
the wake of calamitous local election results, Mr Walker followed up his
hard-hitting speech to his constituency party's annual meeting on Friday
with an interview on BBC television last night.
''The future for the party in Scotland, unless we address the things
that are worrying our voters and supporters, is that we are going down
the chute,'' he said.
Mr Walker said he had specifically warned the Prime Minister last year
about the problems facing the party but his confidential report had gone
unheeded, forcing him now to go public. ''We have to address the
Scottish dimension,'' he said.
Describing the row over the future of Scottish Nuclear as a perfect
example of what was wrong, he said he had told both the Prime Minister
and the Secretary of State for Scotland of his concerns before going
public.
Asked whether his views amounted to a call for Mr Lang and party
chairman Sir Michael Hirst to go, he said: ''Either they change and take
note of all the things that are concerning our supporters, or they move
over and let other people do it.''
Of Mr Major's future he said: ''Unless he can demonstrate very clearly
that he is providing leadership then it is his job that is on the
line.''
The maverick right-winger accepted that the policy of reopening
Stormont in Belfast while denying a forum in Edinburgh was a problem.
His solution was to redesignate the Northern Ireland body as a local
authority, implying that giving Scotland an equivalent body with
suitably limited powers might offer a way out of the Tories' current
policy dilemma.
Otherwise, he warned his party leadership in an observation mirroring
that of Eastwood MP Allan Stewart's talk of a ''wipe-out'' of the party
north of the Border: ''There could be only one or two Tories left in
Scotland and I expect to be one of them. We are all vulnerable.''
On the impending by-election in Perth and Kinross, Mr Walker said:
''Unless we change, our candidate is on a hiding to nothing. It will be
extremely difficult, if not impossible, to hold on.''
Mr Stevenson said grass roots Tories should express their concerns and
make fresh appeals for a new approach at private meetings, such as two
held with Scottish Ministers on Saturday, but not at the conference.
However, many members of the party's rank and file who attended the
meetings with Scottish Secretary Ian Lang in Glasgow and Scottish Office
Minister Lord Fraser in Edinburgh, described them as productive and
would not indicate whether they would also seek to raise their concerns
at the conference.
One constituency association, in the Cathcart area of Glasgow, made an
attempt to organise a private conference for Scottish party members to
express their opinions to the Prime Minister. Mr Lang refused, but is
still considering the possibility of such a forum and may seek support
from other constituencies.
Glasgow district councillor John Young, who represents Cathcart and
was one of the local party members who attended the Glasgow meeting,
said yesterday: ''We put forward the suggestion for a special conference
before we knew about the two meetings this weekend. These were very
productive and the one I attended was the frankest I've been at in my 36
years in the Tory party. Mr Lang took detailed notes and listened
intently.''
Mr Stevenson said disaffected Tories should exercise their right to
comment on the leadership, but ''in the proper way, through the proper
channels''.

SUPPORT for an end to all discrimination against homosexuals,
including their right to legally recognised weddings and adoptions, was
hailed by Scottish Liberal Democrats yesterday as the most progressive
approach ever taken by a party in Britain.
The party leadership in Scotland was clearly angry about the refusal
of delegates at Perth to refer back the most controversial part of the
motion, and party leader Jim Wallace commented tersely afterwards that
he would not be moving any amendment to current Westminster legislation
to reflect the new policy.
''As far as political parties go, this is the biggest single step
forwards,'' said one young Liberal Democrat delegate, Mr John Stewart,
who had held up his hand during the debate on Saturday and pointed out
the wedding ring he wore had no legal recognition because his partner
was gay.
Mr Stewart said a section of a broader motion calling for an end to
legal discrimination on ''cohabitation, parenthood, and adoption'' was
crucial to the issue and he said the leadership's attempts to refer back
that clause would have amounted to stigmatising the gay community.
Speaking after the debate, the proposer, Mr Richard Coxon, said the
Liberal Democrats had shown that only they had the courage of their
convictions in backing the motion.
The policy convener of the Scottish Young Liberal Democrats, Mr Derek
Young, called the vote a landmark in gay rights and said their party was
the only mainstream political group prepared to fight on this issue.

A MOVE to scrap a pact with Labour to boost the proportion of women in
a new Scottish parliament has been overwhelmingly rejected by the
Scottish Liberal Democrats.
The informal commitment to field women as 50% of all candidates for
the first election to New Parliament House in Edinburgh had been
condemned as too close to a statutory quota system by activists from
Edinburgh South constituency.
However, the party big guns swung round in favour of the pact and
warned delegates at the weekend that their leaders' negotiating position
would be seriously undermined if the move went through.
Following that intervention from party leader Jim Wallace and other
leading figures such as Mr Menzies Campbell, the conference decided to
back the official line, and the Edinburgh activists found themselves
isolated.
The deal with Labour, which aims to achieve gender equality in the new
parliament, also hinges on a system of proportional representation.
Mr Wallace had warned delegates that a vote which ended the current
delicate negotiations between the two parties on the Scotish
Constitutional Convention could wreck the future of cross party
concensus on a Scottish parliament.

MANAGEMENT at the closure-threatened Rolls-Royce plant in East
Kilbride have withdrawn threats to impose 25 compulsory redundancies
from yesterday, according to union officials.
Managers at the works are believed to have made the threats last week.
However, unions said such a move would be met with immediate and
indefinite strike action.
The works' convener, Mr Graham Irvine, welcomed the backdown but said
it was ''too early to claim victories''.
He said: ''This is a step forward but we still have a long way to go
in this dispute. But 25 people threatened with redundancy are still
working and that leaves the opportunity for discussions to continue with
management.
''It is a positive move and we would remind managment that the door is
open for negotiations. We are hoping they will now come back to the
table with something more worthwhile.''
Rolls-Royce wants to close the aero-engine design unit and transfer
production to two plants in England, with the loss of around 500 jobs in
Scotland.
Mr Irvine said there would be a two-day stoppage every week for the
next three weeks to fight the plans.
No-one from Rolls-Royce was available for comment yesterday.

THE passing of the years may have taken its toll of one of the most
celebrated physiques in cinema history, but there was no mistaking the
twinkling eyes and cleft chin of a Hollywood legend yesterday.
There was one anxious moment for Kirk Douglas as he climbed from the
limousine outside the Glasgow hotel where he spoke last night, but the
panic passed as the 78-year-old actor found his footing and produced the
entrance of a professional.
The buzz amongst the waiting knot of photographers and reporters -- a
paltry knot, no doubt, considering the batteries of press faced at
countless premieres and Oscar nights over the years since the son of
illiterate Jewish-Russian immigrants hauled himself, via bit parts and
B-movies, to the status of cinema icon -- would be that Kirk wouldn't
talk.
It was rumoured that he would be difficult, an old-style star adopting
the new-age petulance of some of those now elevated to stardom through
film.
One tabloid reporter had even donned a hired dinner suit and bought a
ticket for the #70 a head fundraising dinner as a precaution to try and
rubberneck a quote from the screen giant.
Security guards also moved discreetly, trying to pen the press behind
a tiny red barrier.
But no, Kirk played the game as ever.
With a copy of his latest book clutched, front cover clear and bright,
to his chest, Kirk went straight to the pressmen, cleft chin thrust
forward in the explosions of flash lighting.
The white-haired Douglas produced the smiles and did his job. Pictures
done, the actor, who played a devious reporter in the film Ace in the
Hole, threw the waiting journalists a line too.
The movie star, in a vigorous voice still bearing the traces of his
New York childhood, told The Herald of his kinship and knowledge of
Glasgow.
''I've heard about Glasgow and Gorbals for a long time. One of my best
friends, Bill Henderson, was from Glasgow. I feel like I'm home.''
Then off he was whisked, one of the world's most famous men, to be
presented to several hundred guests at the Jewish National Fund
Charitable Trust dinner.
That the man who declared famously: ''I am Spartacus'' was in Glasgow
at all was due to the cheek of a city businessman, Mr Stanley Lovatt.
Mr Lovatt had made the first phone call to Douglas's agent in a spirit
of ''if you don't ask, you don't get''. The first he knew his approach
had paid dividends was when he answered his phone to hear the
distinctive tones of Douglas himself, accepting his invitation to talk
at a Glasgow dinner.
If that didn't surprise him, Douglas's insistence on waiving his
#47,000 speaking fee and paying his own expenses certainly did.
Douglas will also talk at a dinner in London tonight, all trying to
raise money for a #3m children's park in Israel.
Last night, Douglas's efforts must have bought more than a couple of
swings as the 500 guests at the dinner waited with chequebooks open to
become the latest converts to Kirk's square-jawed charm, with the press
dispersing, one tabloid reporter in search of ''this Glaswegian guy
called Henderson. Apparently his mate's quite famous''.

FIFTY Scottish Nuclear managers yesterday put their weight and their
wallets behind a workers' campaign in support of an independent company.
The managers, from Hunterston and Torness power stations and the
company's head office at East Kilbride, agreed individually to put #1000
of their own money into the campaign support fund.
The managers fear job cuts and a transfer of operations to England
would follow the Government's planned merger of the company with
Cheltenham-based Nuclear Electric. They are also concerned that
Government promises of a Scottish identity within the new company would
prove groundless.
After their two-day annual conference at the Stirling Management
Centre, the managers stayed behind to discuss how best to support the
workers' campaign. It has already attracted wide backing from trade
unions, MPs of all parties, business people, and the local communities.
Mr Duncan Hawthorne, Hunterston engineering manager, said last night:
''I have never seen such unanimous strength of feeling on any issue. All
the managers feel it is important at this time that we do all we can to
help support the workers' campaign.
''Our record speaks for itself. We have increased our output and our
profits and we have demonstrated we are able to stand alone as an
independent company.''
He added: ''In the past five years, people in the company have been
given the opportunity to become much more actively involved in making
the company profitable and to develop their own potential. We must not
lose that.''
Since separating from the South of Scotland Electricity Board in 1990
and forming a company in its own right, Scottish Nuclear has seen steady
financial growth: from a #33m loss to #150m profit in 1994/95.
The company, which employs 1750 at Hunterston, Torness and East
Kilbride, and 4000 more through sub contracts, has seen generating costs
fall to 2.2p per kilowatt hour from 2.9p, making it the lowest unit cost
for a UK nuclear generator. It is on track to achieve a target of 2p a
unit by 1998.
In this month's pay cheque all staff received a flat rate bonus of
#1500 for surpassing targets set on electricity output and costs. A
Scottish Nuclear spokesman said: ''The message is that everyone is
pulling together to keep the company independent.''
Mr Robert Armour, director of performance development and company
secretary, added that a number of options were available for
privatisation. ''One being actively considered is a management buy-out
or management and staff participation in a purchase by a consortium of
financial institutions.''
* Trade President Michael Heseltine yesterday derided claims the
Cabinet was so split over nuclear privatisation that the full decision
on whether to sell off power stations would be Mr Major's alone.
Ministers overseeing the nuclear industry were said by Whitehall
sources to be ''hopelessly divided'' over whether privatisation should
take place before the General Election.
A report in the Observer said Chancellor Kenneth Clarke was pressing
to revive controversial plans to sell eight power stations, raising up
to #3500m to help finance tax cuts, but he faced strong opposition from
Environment Secretary John Gummer, who claimed safety and environmental
concerns would be sacrificed in the drive to make the sale acceptable to
the City.
Mr Heseltine told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ''The article
was about as inaccurate as most articles I read in the newspapers most
days.''
He said: ''When we have finished the nuclear review, I will announce
it, and I will defend Government policy.''

<TEXT>
A CUT-PRICE edition of John le Carre's latest novel Our Game goes on
sale today as the High Street book war intensifies.
The publishers said it is the first new major hardback blockbuster to
be sold widely at a heavily-discounted price -- outside the Net Book
Agreement which has controlled book prices for almost a century.
Hodder &amp; Stoughton, who recently withdrew from the agreement, said
sales were already ahead of le Carre's most recent book, The Night
Manager, which was published within the agreement.
Our Game is now expected to top bestseller lists this summer.
Le Carre's first novel for two years, it is set amid ethnic bloodshed
in the rubble of the ex-Soviet Union and tells of a former spy embroiled
in personal rivalry and espionage.
Supermarket chain Asda said it had placed its biggest order for a
title and will sell the thriller for #8.49 -- the recommended retail
price is #16.99.
Dillons, Menzies, Safeway and Sainsbury also plan to slash the cover
price.
The big retailers and publishers have cut prices and boosted sales in
a growing legal challenge to the agreement -- and in a fiercely
competitive book market.
Mr Tim Hely Hutchinson, chief executive of Hodder Headline, said:
''There is no doubt that this initiative will bring le Carre to a wider
market than ever before and will set the agenda for the future expansion
of the book market.''
But the Publishers' Association said that while it welcomed the
expansion into new markets, it sought to prevent new authors and smaller
outlets being squeezed by huge chains and top-selling writers.

<TEXT>
A SIX-YEAR-OLD boy became a key witness in a murder hunt yesterday
when he saw a man with his throat slashed collapse and die below his
bedroom window.
The terrified boy shouted to his mother, who ran into the street and
tried unsuccessfully to revive the man.
Police cordoned off the street in Reading, Berkshire, as they carried
out house-to-house inquiries to discover the identity of the victim. He
was in his 20s and believed to be have been playing dominoes in a nearby
street before the attack.
Police were waiting to interview the six-year-old witness when his
parents decided he had sufficiently recovered from his ordeal.
A neighbour of the young witness said yesterday: ''The man went up an
alleyway next to my friend's house, and it was her son who saw him
staggering up the road.''
She said her friend went outside after her son had told her what he
had seen. The woman took the man's pulse but realised he was dead.
She added: ''We don't know who this man is, and this is the sort of
area where everyone knows each other.''
Another local resident said the whole neighbourhood was in shock after
the brutal attack.
''This is a very quiet area,'' he commented. ''We don't have fights or
trouble round here. Everyone knows each other and there is a great
community spirit.''
Police spokesman, Inspector Martin Elliott, said: ''All we know at
this stage is that the victim is a white male believed to be aged in his
20s.''
The boy's 34-year-old mother said her son had come running to her and
said: ''Mummy, mummy, there's a man lying down with blood all over
him.''
''We thought he was having us on. We thought he was joking.
''I went into the alleyway and saw this scruffy-looking man lying
there.
''The body was still warm and I took his pulse but he was obviously
dead.
''I wasn't frightened, there's no point in being frightened.
''I had never seen him before, but he had short brown hair and brown
eyes. There was nothing I could do for him so I went and called for an
ambulance.''
The mother-of-four said that the boy was ''fine'' despite his ordeal.

THIRTY-FOUR hospitals in Scotland have been casualties of the
Government's NHS reforms, Labour claimed yesterday.
The closures were among a national toll of 245 across Britain,
equivalent to losing one in seven hospital beds, said the Shadow Health
Secretary, Mrs Margaret Beckett.
She said the figures revealed the truth about the Conservative health
''reforms'' and the number of hospitals that have shut since 1990.
The party had to conduct a five-month investigation in the Commons
library to compile the figures. The information was not available
through Commons questions, the normal channel for MPs to find out such
statistics.
Of the bed losses, the greatest cutbacks have been in psychiatric and
geriatric care units.
One in seven of all hospitals have been shut with 35,992 bed losses --
a 14% reduction -- in the three years 1990/91 to 1993/94.
There has been a 24% and 18% decline respectively in the numbers of
these beds, with 12% of maternity beds and 6% of acute beds lost over
the past three years.
* The NHS pay dispute has intensified with Unison putting a #10m ''war
chest'' at the disposal of its 450,000 health service members, writes
Roy Rogers, Industrial Correspondent.
Regional days of protest are planned for the week beginning June 5 and
a national demonstration is being arranged for the 47th anniversary of
the founding of the NHS on July 5.

A CLIMBER died last night after he fell on one of the most popular
mountains in the West Highlands.
He was found about half way down the 2009ft Stac Pollaidh, north of
Ullapool, by a coastguard helicopter from Stornoway after a search which
was hampered by poor visibility and fading light.
The alarm was raised shortly after 5pm and police in Dingwall alerted
the Dundonell mountain rescue team and the helicopter.
The victim, who was with at least one companion, had not been
identified by police last night.
The climber's body was flown off the mountain to a nearby road then
taken to Ullapool.
A coastguard spokesman said: ''The operation was made more difficult
by heavy drizzle which reduced visbility and the fact that darkness was
falling.''
Stac Pollaidh, which is in the Inverpolly estate, is a popular
hill-walking attraction for thousands of visitors to the Highlands.
A survey by Scottish Natural Heritage showed that 15,000 hill walkers
visited it last year.

AN English Conservative MP provoked a furious response from Scottish
politicians yesterday when he described Scotland as a region of England
while speaking on national television.
Mr Richard Ottaway, who is the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the
President of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, was speaking on
the BBC's flagship weekly political television programme On The Record
when he made the embarrassing faux pas.
Mr Ottaway, MP for Croydon South since April 1992, was unavailable to
comment on his remark yesterday, but a Conservative Party spokesperson
in London apologised for any offence caused to Scots and described his
remark as an innocent mistake.
The incident arose during film of comments from several politicians
and political observers.
It was screened immediately before presenter John Humphrys interviewed
Mr David Hunt MP, the Citizen's Charter Minister and Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster, about the Tories' unpopularity in parts of its
traditional stronghold of middle England and the implications of this
for the forthcoming local government elections in England and Wales.
Mr Ottaway told the programme that there was no guarantee of an
upswing in the Tories' political fortunes.
''I believe that we can actually come along at the moment and offer
#1000 to every house in the country and there will still be a certain
amount of hostility to the Conservative Party.
''The most prosperous region of England is Scotland and yet we got 11%
of the electorate there . . . so coming along and offering this and that
and a package of things on the expectation that it will produce support
for the Conservative Party is misguided.''
A spokesman for the BBC's news and current affairs department and
Opposition party members said they did not believe Mr Ottaway was being
ironic when he referred to Scotland.
His remark was seized upon by an indignant SNP leader, Mr Alex Salmond
yesterday, who said: ''I think Mr Ottaway's remark rather betrays the
real reason why the Conservative Party has been reduced to 11% in
Scotland.
''That is because they think of Scotland, and its resources, as an
appendage of greater England and it is because they are seen as a
southern dominated and focused party that they have fallen into a
position of such ridicule in politics.
''Mr Ottwaway doesn't speak for England, but he speaks volumes for the
attitude of England's Tories.''
He added: ''It is always revealing when Tory MPs are caught telling
the truth about how they view Scotland. It is a good job for his party
that Mr Ottaway didn't speak out like this before the Scottish local
elections otherwise Tory support would have crashed even further.''
Scottish Conservatives were also angered by Mr Ottaway and Tory
Glasgow district councillor John Young said he found his remark deeply
offensive.
''This sort of comment is grossly insulting to all Scots and worrying
for Scottish Tories.

<HEADLINE>Blair warning for the union leaders. Tories set for Black Friday. Tory chiefs braced for a Black Friday</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TORY leaders are bracing themselves for ''Black Friday'' this week
when the party is expected to be counting savage losses from the
previous day's local elections in England and Wales and the Chancellor
is likely to decide to raise interest rates by another half per cent.
Tory morale is currently so low that not losing more than 1500 of the
4000 seats they are defending would probably be greeted with relief by
most MPs and party officials.
On the principle of getting all the bad news over at once, the
interest rate increase may be announced immediately after the Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke's Friday meeting with the Governor of the Bank of
England, Mr Eddie George.
The rise would take the base rate to 7.25% and is likely to hit home
owners. There is little prospect of the mortgage lenders not passing the
increase on, having held back after February's half per cent rise.
Perversely, from a political point of view, it was publication of
figures showing that economic growth was stronger than expected in the
first quarter of the year that will lead the Chancellor to raise the
rate to dampen inflationary pressures.
Labour's prospects in the elections have been strengthened by Mr Tony
Blair's convincing victory in abolishing the old Clause 4 commitment to
full scale nationalisation by a 65%-35% vote at the party's special
conference.
The pace of modernisation was quickened last night. Mr Blair issued a
sharp warning to union leaders to learn the lessons of his Clause 4
victory.
The Opposition leader said it was ''unhealthy'' that some union chiefs
were so badly out of line with ordinary Labour members over Clause 4,
and he warned them they would not be able to boss his Government around.
He was backed by senior Labour sources, who said the party's task now
was to prepare to ''think the unthinkable'' about key areas of economic
renewal. Policies on crime, health and education would be consumer-led.
''There will be no more cutting deals in smoke-filled rooms,'' one
source said.
Mr Blair told the Daily Mirror: ''We have a situation where the party
supporters voted 9-1 in favour of change. It is strange that two large
unions, who on the whole represent ordinary Labour supporters, were
against change.''
As the Labour leader appeared to be hogging the limelight, the Prime
Minister led a fierce Government attack on Mr Blair's claim that ''new''
Labour is now well set to be the next Government.
In newspaper articles, Mr Major said Mr Blair was packaging his party
like a soap powder and denounced his style of politics as ''naive,
deceptive, shallow, inexperienced, and self-contradictory''.
The special conference, he said, was the biggest con trick since the
wolf dressed up as Little Red Riding Hood's granny.
Mr Blair, interviewed on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost, described
these remarks as ''profoundly silly''. The conference had been a
''seminal event'' that could change British politics.
The Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Paddy Ashdown, on GMTV, also said Mr
Major's remarks were ''personally rude, totally unnecessary, and will
not do him any good. It's an example of what people don't like about
politics''. They did show, he said, that the Tories were panicking.
Mr Blair sought to put in perspective media reports that Labour
intended to raise income tax rates for higher earners.
He said Labour did not intend to write its tax policies until much
closer to the General Election when they could assess the circumstances
at the time, although he declined to rule out a new 50p in the pound top
rate of income tax.
He promised that Labour would announce all it intended to do before
polling day. ''We are not going into the election with something in our
back pocket we are not telling people about,'' he said.
He added that he did not personally believe that Labour's plans would
include any extension of VAT.
Mr Blair also declined to put a date on further changes to the party
constitution such as altering the composition of the national executive
committee so that, for example, local government councillors would be
represented, or reducing the union share of the conference vote, already
agreed in principle, from the present 70% to 50%.
He appeared to strike a cautious note on the issue of lifting the ban
on homosexuals serving in the Armed Forces.
He said: ''We have said we will work with defence chiefs of staff to
see if we can get a sensible solution to it.''
Earlier this month, Shadow Defence spokesman Dr David Clark said the
ban was unacceptable in a civilised society, adding that Labour's policy
at the next election would be that homosexuality would not be a reason
for dismissal from the Armed Forces.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, the Conservative Party chairman, appearing on the
same programme, dismissed suggestions that Mr Major would invite a
challenge to his leadership soon if the Conservative local election
losses were heavy.
He said he did not believe there would be a leadership challenge in
November when the opportunity is there under party rules.
That looks less certain if Labour maintain their present huge lead in
the opinion polls. The parliamentary party might then look to the
President of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, to save them from
apparent electoral disaster.
In a BBC Radio Four interview, he said Mr Blair was the first leader
to call a special conference ''to apologise to the British people for
being wrong on all the major issues of our time''. He added: ''How can
you seriously credit this man as a Prime Minister when, on all the most
important issues, he has been wrong?''
Senior Ministers, like Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, still
think that Mr Blair will come unstuck closer to the election when he has
to reconcile the promises of his party spokesmen with a credible line on
taxation.

<TEXT>
SCORN was poured on New Labour yesterday by the Scottish Liberal
Democrat leader, Mr Jim Wallace, who said that without a commitment to
basic fairness at local level Mr Tony Blair could not criticise the
quango culture of the Conservatives nationally.
On a day when one delegate in Perth categorised the Labour approach
north of the Border as the ''Cosla Nostra'' Mr Wallace used his summing
up address to his conference to distance himself from Labour -- some
delegates clearly felt the Liberal Democrats were becoming too close to
Mr Blair.
Mr Wallace said that proportional representation in local government
would boost accountability and he issued a challenge to Labour to extend
its agreement to proportional representation for a Scottish parliament
to local authority elections too. He said it should accept the principle
that Cosla membership should be representative and that council
committees should reflect party balance.
''New Labour could end their monopoly membership of municipal
quangos,'' said Mr Wallace in a jibe at Labour's promotion of itself
being akin to a soap powder advert. ''Labour could -- but we know it
won't because new improved non-ideological Labour is the same old
product, and it just doesn't wash.''
He pointed out that even on the East Kilbride Equal Opportunities
Committee Labour had excluded all but its own members and he called on
his activists to begin what he dubbed Labour Watch.
He said they should monitor Labour activities and report back on its
bias in public life. ''Get me the evidence so that we can expose them to
the wider electorate and show that behind the glitz, smiles and
constitutional amendments of New Labour, rotten-red real Labour lives
on.''
Mr Wallace also laid into the Government for its record on sleaze. He
cited the Home Secretary who broke the law and the Foreign Secretary who
used an aid budget to finance an arms contract, neither of whom had
resigned.
''It's a Scottish Secretary who squandered millions of pounds of
public money on an ill-conceived private health care project -- and he
is still there too. They are selling out Scottish Nuclear. They are
selling off NHS assets in Stonehaven, and they are selling us all short
by paying out a #12.5m Lottery bonanza to one of their own back
benchers.
''They are a Government which has run out of principle, run out of
steam and should be run out of office and the sooner the better.''
Earlier yesterday the conference passed a wide ranging motion aimed at
improving standards in public life. Mr Robert Maclennan, MP for
Caithness and Sutherland, told the conference that the Government and
its Tory placemen had become nonchalant in their disregard for public
standards and quangos had become a haven for self-serving Conservatives.
He said: ''Nothing less than a constitutional resettlement will remove
the stench of malpractice and corruption from the air. Let us not mince
words. People entrusted with public responsibilities are using these to
feather their own nests. That is repugnant.''
The conference passed overwhelmingly a motion criticising the
standards of personal probity in public life and demanding strong
measures to apply a statutory code of practice to Ministers, MPs, civil
servants and members and officials of all public bodies.
The Scottish Liberal Democrats want to see an independent standing
commission to oversee this and in addition they want curbs on spending
by political parties and full disclosure of donations.
A further measure called for the protection of so-called ''whistle
blowers'' who disclose matters of legitimate public interest, an audit
of quangos to identify and scrap unnecessary bodies, and the opening of
all meetings of quangos to the press and public on the same basis as
local authorities.

THERE are ''very real'' fears that Edinburgh's showpiece Festival
Theatre could be plunged into bankruptcy within the next five weeks
unless cash is found to cut its #3.1m deficit.
Lord Provost Norman Irons, vice-chairman of the trust which runs the
theatre, said last night: ''Some people outwith the board seem to think
such a thing like bankruptcy will not happen to such a new, prestigious
building. Unfortunately I can tell them that unless we shout loud enough
that is exactly what will happen.
''Extra cash must be found to help bail it out. To that end I will be
talking to council officials and Lothian regional councillors this week
to try and work out what we can do.
''I will also be asking the Scottish Office to allow both councils
extra borrowing consent to help us give extra funds to the theatre. I
also believe there should be fresh approaches made to get money from
Lottery profits.''
Mr Irons praised Lord Younger, the chairman of the trust's board of
directors, who he said had been working incredibly hard to try and find
a solution.
''Lord Younger is a very experienced and well-connected man and if he
sees the theatre's trading position as precarious and insecure people
should sit up and take notice.''
Since the theatre opened box-office revenue has exceeded expectations
through a wide range of shows, from comedy nights to classical music
concerts.
Much of the financial problem stems from costs incurred renovating the
building. The theatre has an overdraft facility of #1.9m which ends on
May 21 and is unlikely to be extended.

MEMBERS of the environmental group Greenpeace yesterday took control
of a disused North Sea oil installation -- to protest against plans to
dump it at sea.
Four men boarded Shell's Brent Spar, a former tanker loading terminal
118 miles north-east of Shetland in the Brent oil field.
They evaded a Shell standby vessel before using ropes and winches to
haul themselves up from inflatables from the Greenpeace ship, Moby Dick.
A Greenpeace spokeswoman said the four would stay there until the
Government promised to remove the installation altogether.
She said: ''The UK Government promised that disused oil installations
would be removed completely . . .
''Yet the Government has now granted Shell permission to choose the
cheaper option of dumping at sea.
''Shell is going for the cheapest disposal method. The UK Government
must stop them dumping and ensure that the Brent Spar and all disused
oil installations are removed and dismantled on shore.''
She claimed plans to dump Brent Spar at sea would release toxic waste
and present a constant threat to fishermen and marine life.
''The Brent Spar contains over 100 tonnes of hazardous materials,
including waste oil and heavy metals such as cadmium and arsenic,
together with over 30 tonnes of radioactive scale,'' she said.
''Many of the contents are persistent and do not break down in the
environment but build up in sediments and in the bodies of marine
wildlife.''
The 14,500-tonne Brent Spar was the scene of an offshore helicopter
disaster which killed six men in 1990.
The men, five oil workers and a pilot, died when a Sikorski S61
clipped a crane on the terminal, spinning out of control and crashing on
to the helideck.
The tragedy, one of the worst ever North Sea disasters.
In a statement, Shell Expro said: ''We can confirm that several
persons from the Greenpeace vessel Moby Dick boarded the Brent Spar
installation without permission.
''The situation is being monitored closely and Grampian Police have
been notified.''
The disused terminal has been out of action since August 1991.
Permission for its disposal in a deepwater Atlantic site was given in
February.
Shell said the go-ahead followed full evaluation of the technical,
environmental, safety and cost factors.
In a statement Shell Expro said: ''We are concerned that the group of
individuals that have boarded the Brent Spar could place themselves in
danger since they are unlikely to be familiar with the detailed layout
of the structure.
''The structure has been abandoned for a number of years and has no
life-support systems. Having made their protest the group should act
responsibly and leave.''
