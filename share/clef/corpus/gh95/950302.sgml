From DIANE STORMONT
Hong Kong
LOCAL movie mogul Raymond Chow is not averse to a gamble; so he took a
chance with an American-born, Hong Kong-bred actor and martial artist.
Bruce Lee's films promptly broke all industry records, surpassing the
Sound of Music for the highest profit-to-investment ratio.
Chow gambled again when he gave the go-ahead in a long-distance phone
call to an off-the-wall script that every studio in Hollywood had
scornfully rejected.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles proved another smash hit.
Now Chow has bold plans to expand throughout the region, a market that
includes China and Vietnam and is expected to lead the world's growth
curve.
However, as of yet, he has no thought of floating the division of his
company that is closest to his heart: the filmmaking arm of Golden
Harvest.
''I list my profession as film producer. Film production is very much
in my heart,'' Chow said.
Born in Hong Kong in 1927 and educated in Shanghai, he made his first
venture into commerce while still in high school by starting a sports
newspaper and coaxing friends to work for him.
The paper made money. ''Not much,'' the quietly-spoken Chow said with
a smile. ''Just pocket money.''
He was persuaded by his mother to return to Hong Kong in 1949 as the
Communist revolution swept China.
Chow, who took his degree in journalism at Shanghai's St John's
University, worked first as an underpaid reporter for the Hong Kong
Standard, an English-language newspaper in the colony.
He moonlighted in six other jobs at the same time to make ends meet
before going on to start up the Voice of America's operations in Hong
Kong.
He was wooed away to take care of publicity for Sir Run Run Shaw,
credited as almost single-handedly founding the Hong Kong film industry.
It was production rather than publicity that interested Chow, and,
armed with rather more enthusiasm than practical knowledge, he jumped
into the field with both feet.
His decision to branch out on his own in 1970, when he formed Golden
Harvest, led to bitter rivalry with his former employer. This
intensified when Chow made a determined attempt to woo the young Bruce
Lee.
The first Chow-Lee film, Big Boss -- released worldwide as Fists of
Fury -- was filmed in Thailand on a shoestring budget of just 50,000 US
dollars.
''That was probably the world's most profitable film,'' Chow recalled.
''The returns were more than 500 times, or even 1000 times more than the
original investment.''
As for the Ninja Turtles, it was the name that intrigued Chow, despite
the mound of rejection notices the script had generated.
''It was funny, it was unique. What a contradiction in terms; mutants
and healthy teenagers, slow-moving turtles and swift, deadly ninjas,''
he said.
''I gave it the go-ahead but set a limit of US$5 million.''
Costs soon crept up, forcing Chow to fly to the States to consider
whether to cancel. He came away convinced that even if costs rose to
US$15m, the project would still work.
''It was a bit of a gamble, but only a bit of one. It exceeded
expectations by many, many times,'' he said, without giving numbers.

KPMG partnerDonald Adamson looks at the changing tax situation in the
British contruction industry
ONCE upon a time non-payment of tax flourished in the construction
industry. There was an atmosphere of ''like it or lump it'', and back in
the halcyon days of the 1960s the ''lump'' was at its peak.
Around that time it was rumoured that the sons of Hibernia and
Caledonia, having been paid on London building sites, were not keen to
hang about and pay tax. Indeed it was even suggested that goodly numbers
flooded back across the Irish Sea or north of Hadrian's Wall leaving the
Exchequer well and truly socked. Hence the development of the current
construction industry tax deduction scheme first implemented in 1971.
How the present system works
Where a contractor carries on construction work, and pays a
sub-contractor then the payer must deduct and pay over to the Inland
Revenue 25% of the sum involved (excluding cost of materials) UNLESS the
sub-contractor has an exemption certificate. This is the ''714
certificate'', which allows the sub-contractor to be paid gross, and
which is issued and controlled by the Inland Revenue. The aim of the tax
inspector is to ensure that sums paid gross do end up being reflected in
the sub-contactor's accounts, and hence taxed.
So everything is coming up roses?
Well, actually, no. The system is under increasing strain as the
numbers of sub-contractors have constantly increased; it is costly to
administer, and it is subject to abuse.
Despite the Inland Revenue's best efforts to police the system, and
you are statistically much more likely to end up in court for a
sub-contractor offence than any other fiscal misdemeanour, it has proved
to be only a partial answer.
Consequently the 1995 Finance Bill contains legislation which will
substantially tighten the present position. In the future, these
proposed changes will mean that tax deductions will have to be made from
most payments to subcontractors. Contractors will be under great
pressure to deduct the minimum amount of tax, as sub-contractors lose
their cherished ''714 card'' status. These changes are likely to be
fully in force by the end of 1998.
The new system
The main features of the proposed scheme are:
* Exemption certificates giving entitlement to tax free payments will
only be issued to subcontractors with high business turnovers (the
qualifying level is still to be announced). Up to 80% of subcontractors
will no longer qualify for certificates; on 1991 figures that is about
500,000 subcontractors
* Tax will be deducted at a rate closer to the average rate of tax for
subcontractors who do not qualify for an exemption certificate rather
than at the basic rate as now
* Gross payments will have to be made by electronic funds transfer
* Tax deducted from payments to a subcontractor will be set off
automatically against that person's tax liability using a credit card
slip system, in place of the present SC60 certificate.
Although not yet confirmed, the Inland Revenue may introduce a
controversial proposal that would seek a mandate allowing access to the
bank account of the sub-contractor to ensure payments had all been
declared in the sub-contractor's return.
Effect on Sub-contractors
If the level of witholding tax proves excessive for a particular
contractor then any overpayment will not be given until his tax affairs
for the year are resolved. This is unlikely to be before January 1
following the year of assessment. The adverse cash flow effect of this
is unlikely to be popular.
Effect on Contractors
Contractors will have to administer a tax deduction scheme on the
majority of payments made to sub-contractors and account for large
amounts of tax. Not only this, but as a tax deduction will only arise on
the labour element of the payment, contractors will be under pressure
from sub-contractors to deduct as little as possible. This is likely to
cause a growth in disputes about how payments should be split between
labour and materials, and contractors who do not control this could be
left liable to the tax on any inflated material element paid.
Contractors will also have to operate an electronic fund transfer
scheme to pay the larger sub-contractors.
What to do now
* Check to see if you fall within the construction industry tax
deduction scheme on the present basis -- especially if you're not in the
building trade but incur considerable (#250,000+) expenditure on
construction work.
* Make sure that you are complying with the present system as regards
paperwork and annual returns. This can be onerous in clerical time, but
will save you from a nasty surprise when the Inland Revenue calls to
inspect the records.
* Question whether your present systems and staff are able to cope
with the changes proposed which will result in a large increase in
numbers who will need to have tax withheld.
* Obtain advice as to the proportions of the payment that can be
discounted from the calculation of liability.
* Set up systems ready for 1998 to enable details of tax withheld to
be produced by computer, thus saving time in form completion.
The bottom line
The Government is continuing to transfer responsibility for collecting
tax from itself to the private sector. The administrative burden is
considerable, but the costs of ignoring the point will be far greater,
as the Inland Revenue police the construction industry tax deduction
system with increasing vigour.

From MARCEL MICHELSON, Toulouse
THE area around Toulouse, near the Pyrenees mountains, is turning into
a new Silicon Valley with a growing number of high-tech companies.
Like its Californian model, Toulouse, fourth biggest city in France,
offers an attractive climate and lifestyle to researchers and
executives.
It has qualified labour, good transport links, and boasts a number of
top-level research institutes. But it took a focused marketing effort to
convince foreign companies to set up their European sites.
Traditionally, Toulouse industry has been dominated by aerospace. Ever
since aviation pioneers such as Antoine de Saint-Exupery used a Toulouse
airstrip, the city has been the centre of France's plane- making
industry.
Airbus, Aerospatiale, and ATR are the big names on an imposing roll
call.
Electronics, chemistry, and biomedical activities as well as space,
computing, and biotechnologies are also booming.
''We try to offer a one-stop service,'' said Ignacio Antona, project
manager at Technopole Toulousaine, a body promoting the area to foreign
companies. ''We can help with sites, financing and access to research
institutes.
''Our aim is that a foreign company, setting up business here, has the
same access to research facilities as a local company,'' said Technopole
chairman Didier Bernadet
Access to laboratories was one of the factors that helped Toulouse
gain the 150 million franc (#18m) high-tech European plant and research
centre of US group Storage Technology.
Storagetek makes data storage and retrieval systems, using a robot
that quickly picks up data cartridges from a library and puts them in a
computer data server.
Jean Barcellini, managing director of the site, said he hoped to start
production next month and would have 470 employees in 1998, of whom 170
would be researchers. He was now busy hiring staff to start production
with 160 people.
More recently, Motorola Semiconductors decided to invest another 700
million francs (#94m) at Toulouse, where it has been based since 1967,
partly in a new joint research laboratory with Toulouse institute LAAS
and the CNRS national research centre.
One of the research institutes in Toulouse that combines fundamental
research with industrial applications is the CERFACS European Centre for
Research and Advanced Training in Scientific Computation.
In a white, spacious building adorned with in-house gardens, some 50
researchers combine their brain-power with the most powerful parallel
processing computers in the world to develop such things as a computer
model to simulate wind-tunnel testing for aircraft parts.
This cuts time and costs compared with the current practice of
building prototype parts and putting them in giant wind tunnels to test
future behaviour in flight.
Closely linked to France Meteo, it also has a team working on
improving weather forecasts. As a tribute to its international standing,
it will host the 1995 World Linear Algebra Year.

One man's cherished legacy can be another chap's albatross. Take, for
instance, the case of Scottish Ballet and Swan Lake. Tonight the company
open a shiny, new revival of the work and in doing so open up old areas
of dissension.
For the Swan Lake which takes to the stage in new plumes by designer
Jasper Conran is not the version choreographed by the company's founder,
the late Peter Darrell.
To many who have loyally followed the company since its early days
this seems yet another indication that Darrell's name, and repertoire,
are being shoved into the background. This concern -- which I regularly
hear -- extends to the very character of the company itself.
Some express it as a grievous loss of individuality, and point out
that there is, these days, precious little to distinguish the Scottish
Ballet repertoire from that of any other common or Covent Garden
classical company. Others are frankly disappointed that Darrell's own
works aren't given more prominence -- I've lost count of how many times
I've heard nostalgic cries for Tales of Hoffman, or some of the early
one-acts.
Hoffman, I should say now, won't happen. It has slipped off the edge
of the known repertoire and -- according to some sources -- the sets and
costumes are no longer held by Scottish Ballet. As for the one-acts,
well Cheri will be revived this spring, in a double bill with a new Mark
Baldwin ballet.
Meanwhile there is the new Swan Lake. Or perhaps one should say, there
is the old Swan Lake. Staged by the company's artistic director, Galina
Samsova, it returns -- in this, the centenary of its St Petersburg
premiere -- to the version made by Petipa and Ivanov (who revamped
Reisinger's less than successful Swan Lake of 1877).
And here is where the concept of legacy becomes interesting and
possibly problematic. For Samsova, trained in the technique and
traditions of Russian classical ballet, the legacy lies in the steps she
followed as a ballerina in the Soviet Union. And those steps lead back
into the very foundations of ballet history. The Darrell legacy -- which
defined the identity of Scottish Ballet for almost twenty years -- lies
in guiding those steps out of the nineteenth century myths and into the
recognisable realms of flesh and blood people.
His Swan Lake has the Prince seduced by a pipedream of perfect love.
In reality he has been dazzled by a courtesan supplied -- like the opium
that induces his illusions -- by his ambitious, manipulating friend,
Benno. At the time -- 1977, coincidentally the centenary of the first
Swan Lake -- it was seen as radical, even controversial.
What's absolutely magical, however, is the transformation of opinion
across the years. In recent months I have chatted with various Scottish
Ballet regulars who loathed Darrell's reworking of Swan Lake at the time
but now see it as having more real meaning for our times than the
romantic classic. And they are perplexed at its abrupt displacement from
the repertoire. I've even heard it described as ''disloyal''.
At which point, one suddenly remembers -- it's seven years since Peter
Darrell died. And yet, a substantial number of folk still see Scottish
Ballet as ''his'' company and expect to see his work at the forefront of
every season.
Frankly -- despite my great personal enthusiasm for the man and his
work -- I find this worrying. Seven years seems a fearfully long period
of transition, especially when it's still not clear what the outcome
will be, or is meant to be. But as yet, nothing that one could badge the
company with as a sign of specific individuality has emerged. And
individuality was the hallmark Darrell gave it.
His legacy wasn't just a collection of works -- some of which he
himself never wanted to see again! -- it was an attitude. It was all to
do with making classical ballet connect with modern times, even if that
involved shock tactics.
One of the last things he ever said to me was: ''I don't want to be a
Grand Old Man of Ballet. I want to -- oh, fart on stage. Ruffle a few
feathers, darling.'' If Scottish Ballet now choose to have a Swan Lake
with feathers groomed by classic tradition then maybe it's time for some
other company to emerge, assume the Darrell legacy (if not necessarily
the repertoire) and leave the current team to do their own thing.

BRIAN KILLEN, Moscow
RUSSIA'S long and bitter war against the separatists in Chechnya is
severely jeopardising plans by an international oil consortium to pump
oil across the troubled North Caucausus region.
The consortium, formed by Azerbaijan last year, had signed a $7.4
billion contract, expecting to export early output through Russia's
Black Sea port of Novorossiisk.
However, there is a major snag: the route, which calls for reversing
the flow of an existing pipeline supplying Azerbaijan's refineries,
crosses Chechnya.
Western oil industry analysts say there are no obvious alternative
routes for early output from the three big Caspian Sea fields, due to
come on stream within 15 months.
One company executive gave his view: ''The Azeris may now be leaning
more towards southern routes (to Mediterranean ports), which hold their
own risks and which Russia would certainly oppose.'' Azerbaijan, in a
state of virtual war for seven years over the ethnic Armenian-populated
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, is counting on ''the contract of the
century'' to revive its shattered economy.
The republic's oil industry is in deep crisis, lacking money to drill
new wells or even to maintain old ones. Crude output fell to 9.6 million
tonnes last year from 10.3 million in 1993.
''Implementation of this document will have great positive
significance for the development of all sectors of the oil industry and,
of course, for the crisis in the economy,'' President Heydar Aliyev told
the consortium last month.
The consortium, led by an alliance between British Petroleum and
Norway's Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil), includes the
American companies Amoco, McDermott International, Pennzoil, and Unocal.
Other members are Britain's Ramco Energy, Saudi Arabia's Delta Nimir,
Russia's Lukoil, and Turkish Petroleum. Azerbaijan is represented by the
state oil company, SOCAR.
Western oil industry analysts say the main problem is finding a
suitable export route, therefore Chechnya has complicated their task.
The most likely alternatives to crossing the volatile North Caucasus
are routes through Georgia, Turkey, or Iran.
Georgia is relatively calm for the moment, but a 1992 conflict with
secessionist Abkhazia could easily flare up again.
Turkey has problems with Kurdish rebels that have threatened to
sabotage any pipeline unless they receive revenue from it.
However, Ankara has been lobbying hard for a new pipeline from Baku to
the southern Turkish Mediterranean port of Yumurtalik.
This would avoid any sharp increase in tanker traffic from Russia
through the congested Bosphorus Straits and provide Turkey with revenues
from transit fees.
But Russia, whose giant Lukoil company is a member of the consortium,
wants any new pipeline to cross its territory.
As for Iran, the US companies involved in the Azeri consortium are
unlikely to accept this.
Washington has been vociferous in accusing Iran of sponsoring
international terrorism on a large scale, and has already objected to
Azerbaijan offering Tehran a five percent stake in the deal.
''A pipeline crossing Iran would be like rubbing salt into the
wound,'' the Western analyst said.
Ironically, Russian oil output and exports will suffer little as a
result of unrest in Chechnya. ''It's a pittance,'' said Deputy Prime
Minister Oleg Davydov, describing possible oil losses.
Chechen crude oil output is a tiny fraction of Russian output -- about
1.5 million tonnes in 1993 compared with Russia's overall output of 354
million.
Chechnya's oil refineries, which have an annual capacity of more than
20 million tonnes, have been working well below that total since
specialists left in droves following the declaration of independence
almost four years ago.
Pipeline flows have also slowed to a trickle, with only 139,200 tonnes
of crude exported from Chechnya in 1993 compared with total Russian
exports of more than 80 million tonnes.
At one time, it seemed possible that pipelines crossing Chechnya might
be used to export oil from the giant Tengiz field in western Kazakhstan.
However, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), comprising Russia,
Kazakhstan, and Oman, made it crystal clear last in January that this
option was no longer under consideration.
Russia's contribution to CPC assets is a stretch of pipeline in
southern Russia estimated to be worth $300m.
''This does not touch events in Chechnya. The route selected (for the
CPC project) does not cross the Chechen republic,'' Russian Fuel and
Energy Minister Yuri Shafranik told a news conference.
The CPC plans to build a relatively safe pipeline for Russian and
Kazakh oil exports, looping around the north Caspian and cutting across
southern Russia to a new Black Sea terminal.
However, the CPC project, the first phase of which should add 15
million tonnes of export capacity within the next three years, will do
little to help Azerbaijan, despite an invitation to participate.
The Chechen hostilities have deprived Azerbaijan of its only existing
link to the planned CPC route -- the Tikhoretsk-Grozny- Baku line.
A Western company executive explained: ''The only other way of
exporting early output will be through swop arrangements with either
Russia or Iran. Alternately, they could consider using barges across the
Caspian to the Volga-Don river system.''

CINDERELLA is at the ball. In fact, at countless functions throughout
Scotland she's dancing the night away, a shimmering Scarlett O'Hara in
rich silk taffeta, a dazzling Joan Collins in glamorous sophistication.
Whether in swirling satins of gorgeous rainbow colours, or sleek and
elegant simplicity in plain black velvet, she is always arrayed in
stunning style.
The fairy godmother who has made it all possible is Jill Greenhalgh of
Cinderella Gowns in Coatbridge.
And as owner of an evening-gown hiring business with 10 franchised
outlets in Scotland, which collectively owns more than 2000 dresses,
there is no shortage of choice for any lady who wants to bowl over her
Prince Charming, to be the envy of her friends, be the belle of the
ball.
Cinderella Designer Gowns has come a long way from its foundation in
1986 as a small, part-time business that Jill hoped would fit in with
running her home and young family.
As a young wife and mother with an active social life, she saw at an
early stage that there was a niche in the market for ball-gown hire.
It seemed to her remarkable that men's dinner suits, which essentially
remained untouched by fashion, were widely available for hire, while
ladies' gowns, of which a fashion conscious and sociable woman might
need several in any social season, were not.
Jill had always been interested in fashion, dress-making, and design.
So taking steps to create a profitable business by filling this gap and
combining it with family life seemed an obvious career move.
She was lucky that at the same time new chemicals and machinery had
just been developed which so improved the dry-cleaning process that
dresses could be regularly restored to fresh and uncreased perfection
within 24 hours instead of possibly 10 days.
Jill's first step as a novice entrepreneur was to go to the local
enterprise centre in Motherwell. Here, she received great support, both
in terms of finance (an enterprise allowance) and training (she
undertook a basic business course which included accountancy, marketing,
and advertising).
With an investment of #5000 of her own money she bought a stock of
dresses, rails, mirrors, and so on, and set up business in the spare
room of her home in Motherwell.
Jill advertised in the local paper, arranging clients' visits on an
appointments system so that family life would continue uninterrupted,
and pitched her prices at a level that would be good value for customers
as well as profitable for Cinderella Designer Gowns.
From the outset, the growth of the business was as dazzling as the
evening dresses that jostle on the rails in such luxurious and colourful
profusion before they muster on the dance floor to waltz and shimmy, to
twist and shake, or to reel and strathspey.
The demand was so great that, from the start, Cinderella Designer
Gowns was growing by 100% a year, and by 1989 Jill was beginning to
think about franchising operations.
Once again, Motherwell Enterprise were most helpful with advice and
contacts, and by the end of the year Cinderella Designer Gowns was up
and running -- this time as a franchise company.
Since then it has become one of the biggest evening wear hiring
businesses in Scotland.
The 10 franchises are spread over the country, from Ayr in the
south-west to Kincardine and Keith in the north, Whitecraigs and
Bearsden to Coatbridge, where Jill's original business and headquarters
is now situated.
This year, plans are already well advanced to widen operations in
England: a number of franchises are planned for the Manchester area,
while the Blackburn franchisee has already been trading successfully for
a year.
The result is that Jill is heading a completely different outfit from
the initial enterprise of nine years ago -- she's running a service
business on behalf of her franchisees, who are now her main customers.
And their profits and success can be attributed to a variety of
factors. The terms of the franchise formula are obviously crucial.
Like most franchisees, they pay a fee for using the name, a charge for
initial training and stationery. and they buy the stock of garments.
Then a fixed weekly fee (less than the hire of one dress) is paid.
This covers the costs of monthly meetings, training sessisons, and the
constant availability of consultations and advice.
There are also, of course, strict rules on the running of each outlet
and the quality standards of the stock.
The care and attention taken by Jill in the individual selection of
the franchisees is very important -- dozens of would-be entrepreneurs
are unsuitable.
It is vitally important that, apart from the obvious attributes of
fashion-consciousness, intelligence, outgoing personality, and so on,
they are able to participate enthusiastically in the Cinderella team.
The third aspect of Jill's franchise success must lie in the quality
and choice that the size of her business is able to offer to the dress
hiring public.
With its collective buying power, the company is in a position to buy
designer dresses at competitive prices, and so is able to provide high
quality dresses at very reasonable hiring rates.
The size of the business also means that designers are keen to supply
them -- Cinderella Designer Gowns uses around 20 different dress
designers.
It also means there is a wide choice for the customer -- any outlet
has a stock of between 80 and 140 dresses of all sizes, with the ability
to call on 100 more if necessary.
Every age group, from the ingenue at her first pre-teenage ball to the
septuagenarian at a golden wedding anniversary, can be catered for.
However, says Jill, their biggest group of customers is perhaps the
creme de la creme of Scottish businesswomen who need a variety of
dresses for their wide and contrasting range of social functions.
To meet their needs, the evening appointments available at most of
Cinderella's outlets are invaluable.
And flexibility in the timetable is not restricted to the early
evening arrangements -- neither Jill nor any of her fairy godmothers
insists on the midnight curfew.

And it is also promising to further erode shareholder income by
forecasting a mere 12.5p for the current year.
The reaction was to push the shares ahead 7p to 317p with the
reasoning that BICC has just passed a watershed of some magnitude and
ignoring the impact upon income funds which will now become sellers of
the stock.
Although chairman Sir Robin Biggam would not concede that the company
had been over-distributing in the preceding three years and arguing that
the cash flow and prospects were strong enough to justify the payments,
some observers were less inclined to that view.
It is still hard to swallow that BICC paid out 58.08p for the 1991-93
financial period on total earnings of just 17.6p.
But with Alan Jones, chairman of GKN's Westland Aircraft, taking over
as chief executive in a month's time and Sir Robin moving on to being a
three-day-a-week chairman next year, there is a definite change promised
in management style although its nature may not be apparent for several
months yet.
The dividend decision points to Mr Jones being promised a clear run
with the painful decision as to the relationship with shareholders taken
before he arrives and so that he should be able to point to a more
soundly-based dividend progression from 1996 onwards.
The move has been accelerated through the cash-flow problems as a
result of escalating copper, aluminium and polyethylene prices in recent
months which reduced cash generation by #97m to #112m. That has resulted
in gearing rising from 11% to 46% and net debt to almost #300m and the
prospect of significantly higher interest costs this year.
At first glance the 28% increase in pre-tax profits to #1131m on
turnover little changed at #3973m is encouraging. However, that conceals
a sharp contrast between cables, where the outlook is reasonably sunny,
and construction, where Balfour Beatty's prospects in the UK are very
clouded, which accounts for 80% of the business.
Sir Robin was happy to point out that Balfour's margins are the
highest in the industry and almost twice those of Tarmac and Trafalgar
House Construction. But that is not saying much as Balfour's amount to a
fraction over 2%. However, UK infrastructure work will remain very much
on ice until the private finance initiatives such as British Rail
privatisation, the Channel Tunnel Rail Link and Devonport Royal Dockyard
become reality.
That could take another two years during which time there is a strong
possibility of a change of government which may take a somewhat
different view.
The contruction industry is assuming that the traditional Labour
attitude has been more sympathetic to it than the Conservatives because
of bigger public sector spending. Since the 1990 peak, UK construction
has fallen by 30% and another 10% seems possible over the next two
years.
Balfour increased its operating profits by just #3m to #43m although
that was after a #5m gain on the sale of Eurotunnel shares and warrants
granted back in 1986. However, the overseas content is rising and should
soon approach 30% with the overall subsidiary order book now equivalent
to a year's turnover at #1700m.
So the overall improvements in BICC group profitability which will be
more modest than in 1994 will come from the cables activities where
price increase of 5%-6% are being pushed through.
The impetus in the UK is coming from fibre optic where the outlook is
decidedly rosy and from power cables in export markets. However, BICC
which is the most profitable company apart from Alcatel of France was
more than implying yesterday that there is scope for rationalisation in
the sector. GEC Cables are loss-making and Delta is scraping along in
low-voltage cables on tiny margins -- would it be missed?
Current year profits seem likely to show little change which would
leave the shares trading at 16 times likely earnings while yielding 4.9%
on the reduced forecast payout. The Jones factor provides the interest
to what is otherwise a somewhat unexciting near to medium-term
performer.

SINCE being floated off by its parent company BTR in March 1994,
builders' merchants Graham Group has operated against a difficult
housing background, writes CHRIS STONE.
The company has performed credibly and while the shares at 168p, up 1p
yesterday, are below the issue price of 183p, they have not suffered as
much as some in the sector.
Last year pre-tax profits climbed 36.5% to #18.9m on turnover up 11.9%
at #418.8m. Operating profit ahead of interest charges was up 38.2% at
#21.1m with margins improving to 5% from 4.1% in 1993.
Earnings per share rose 30.5% to 10.7p and a final dividend 3.50p
gives a total of 5.25p, as expected.
Since flotation, Graham, which was founded in Glasgow in 1936 and is
now based in Huddersfield, has been concentrating on boosting margins --
gross margins improved by 0.3% over the year to 22.07% rising 0.6% in
the second half.
Investment as well as cost control has paid a key part in the
company's progress. It has also focused on higher margin products and
higher margin methods of distribution.
Investment in showrooms appears to be the main spur. The capital
investment programme gathered pace in the second half. Altogether 42
showrooms have now undergone a rebranding and refurbishment programme,
26 in 1994. And the rebranded showrooms have achieved increases in sales
of 44% against 6% for other showrooms.
The distribution system and new counter development programme has
benefited Graham's high-margin Collect business which is now showing
sound growth trend. The company regards this a particularly pleasing as
the market in 1994 was characterised by new housing growth, with its
emphasis on lower-margin direct and delivered sales.
Graham was able to attract higher-margin sales of kitchen and bathroom
furniture from the new household market which complemented the more
traditional lower-margin heavyside sales to the sector.
Not so happy was the performance of Goodman Croggon, now rebranded
Goodman, which did not perform up to expectations. Action has therefore
been taken to strengthen the management team. The company is confident
that its strategy at Goodman of concentrating on agricutural, fencing
and building product wholesaling offers scope to advance its earnings
concentration.
Graham is looking for further progress. Meanwhile, the shares sell at
approaching 16 time historic earnings and yield 4.2%.

CAUTIOUS optimism is the phrase which most readily springs to mind
when commenting on recent recessionary trends affecting supply and
demand in commercial and industrial property in Ayrshire and South-west
Scotland.
Despite the well-publicised difficulties which continue to have a
significant effect on town centre retailing, most Ayrshire-based
surveyors would accept the view that this area has, in non-residential
property terms, fared rather better than most in Scotland, with the
possible exception of the North-east, which still benefits greatly from
oil related activities.
Those involved in local property are hopeful the recession really is
over, but it will take considerable time to redress the spectacular loss
of confidence it engendered.
There is little doubt, however, that many developments which have
taken place over the last year or so, coupled with renewed
entrepreneurial interest in a wide range of non-residential
opportunities, give cause fo optimism.
Retail
Demand for most types of retail property in or close to prime pitches
remains extremely disappointing. While the large number of agents'
boards attached to display fascias has fallen lately, this is primarily
due to a change in marketing emphasis, or in some cases the conclusion
of various short-term tenancies at economically unattractive rental
levels.
High Street in Ayr, King Street in Kilmarnock, Rivergate and
Bridgegate in Irvine and Dockhead Street, Saltcoats have all been
affected along similar lines, although agents for vacant units in good
secondary localities, particularly within the Ayr and Kilmarnock areas,
are now seeing an uplift in enquiries and anticipate an increase in
concluded bargains.
It should not be overlooked, however, that many traditional High
Street traders have recently located to retail parks. These have the
attractions of unrestricted parking and proximity to major routes,
making this trend unlikely to be reversed. Most district councils and
locally-based retail trade associations recognise the problem and are
endeavouring to combat the attraction of out-of-town centres through
pedestrianised shopping initiatives. Hopefully these will bear fruit
over the months and years ahead.
Offices
For many years, Bell Ingram has been heavily involved in office
development throughout Ayrshire and South-west Scotland. Our recent and
continued appointment as sole letting agent for the new 32,000 sq ft
office complex in Carrick Street, Ayr, now partially let to The
Employment Service, has led to similar involvement in four additional
schemes in this general locality.
However, despite the issue of a large number of property schedules,
follow-up interest remains at a relatively low level, and rentalised
building costs of #12-#13 per sq ft are largely unattainable.
Ayr has long been regarded as a prime office location in Ayrshire, and
since the market is unable to support speculative development at the
moment, developers will undoubtedly turn their attentions to more
lucrative and certainly more dependable sources of return on investment.
On an optimistic note, the demand for traditional town house office
accommodation providing a rental rate of #8-#9 per sq ft in Ayr, #7 in
Irvine, and only #5-#6 in Kilmarnock remains high, although most
interested parties regularly express a preference to purchase rather
than lease.
Industrial
The recent successful disposal of the Irvine Development Corporation
industrial property portfolio for a sum reportedly in excess of #27m has
undoubtedly confounded many central belt cynics who reasoned that
existing road and transport disabilities would colour the view of
industrial sector investors.
Such fears have been comprehensively dismissed by the high degree of
interest show, and by the number of competitive bids lodged by a wide
range of seriously interested parties.
Irvine Development Corporation has an enviable record for attracting
high-calibre industrial concerns to the Irvine area, and it is hoped its
imminent winding-up will not adversely affect Ayrshire's ability to
attract quality industrial investment in this highly competitive market.
New retail warehouse developments in Ayr, Irvine and Kilmarnock have
provided similar cause for optimism in the local market place, and
planning enquiry reports relating to Queen's Drive, Kilmarnock and
Heathfield, Ayr for additional retail warehousing and/or supermarket
development will shortly be published. Decisions reached at this time
will determine the shape of retailing in Ayrshire for some time to come.
As professional property advisors to PIK, the new owner of Prestwick
International Airport, we confirm the widely held view that the single
most important factor in providing assistance to the Ayrshire-based
industrial community is the rebirth and continuing rejuvenation of the
airport and its immediate environs. PIK, assisted by Enterprise Ayrshire
and cross-party political support at both local and national level, has
already made great strides in laying the foundations for a healthy and
prosperous future. We are confident that expansion of this nature will
provide a catalyst to complimentary industrial redevelopment throughout
the region.

SAVING money through greater efficiency is a message companies
constantly drum into their employees, yet often these same companies are
unable to recognise huge potential savings in relation to the buildings
they occupy.
By comparing running and future maintenance costs before selecting a
building, and by ensuring proper management of an investment in the
buildings they occupy, companies can avoid pouring huge sums of money
down the drain.
As the majority of leases are FRI (full repairing and insuring), the
cost of maintaining the building falls totally upon the tenants during
their period of occupation and particularly on termination of the lease,
when the property must be reinstated to the condition it was in when
taken over.
Did you document the condition of your building at date of entry?
Usually, the landlord appoints an agent to manage the building and the
tenant picks up the tab for all the costs and management fees. The agent
may not be wholly familiar with the building and its services, nor able
to advise the tenants on the best means of operating the systems. Often
he or she has little incentive to consider ways of improving conditions
or saving costs.
This is certainly not in the best interest of the tenant and
ultimately, therefore, not in the long-term interest of the landlord
either.
Landlords need to attract good tenants and make sure they want to
stay, especially as long-term leases with no break clauses are becoming
less common. The investment value of a particular building is determined
to a great extent by the covenant of the tenant and the lease terms and
conditions.
So who is looking after the requirements and interests of the tenant?
I am convinced there is a need for a new kind of professional in the
property world, one dedicated to ensuring buildings are run as
efficiently and beneficially as possible for the tenant. This may
initially involve the landlord investing time and money, but it is
important to take the long-term view -- the rewards in terms of cost
savings and tenant satisfaction can be substantial. After all, the next
rent review is only just around the corner.
A lot can be done by both the landlord and the tenant to eliminate
unnecessary expenses and reduce running costs. Selecting a building
simply on floor area, without proper space planning or surveying it and
its services, invariably leads to problems with inappropriate space,
power, lighting, heating or ventilation. This can involve costly
alterations in order to comply with health and safety regulations and
building control restrictions.
For example, do you know how many lavatories you are legally required
to provide for your workforce, or what category of lighting you need to
provide for VDU users?
The space plan and service requirements should be completed before the
tenant approaches an agent and should be a determining factor in the
final choice of building.
Before finalising a lease, the incoming tenant should commission a
complete survey of the building, including the mechanical and electrical
services, lighting, heating, ventilation, water, lifts and so on, to
ensure the systems installed comply with current legislation and are
''fit for the purpose''.
This survey forms the baseline for the landlord to ensure the charges
proposed are competitive and commensurate with the services being
offered. The two main cost elements are electricity consumption and
maintenance. Over and above these charges, the tenant has his or her own
office running costs.
By monitoring energy usage, planned maintenance and taking advantage
of current technological advances, there are immediate savings to be
made, with additional long-term reductions in maintenance costs.
For example, the installation of energy-efficient lighting and control
systems in one building showed savings of up to 60% of energy consumed,
as well as improving the working environment.
The introduction of water meters for a property in Lothian Region
showed savings last year of up to 80% compared with paying fixed water
rates based on rateable value.
Property management is a continuous process as business needs
constantly change. A regular dialogue between landlord and tenant is
essential and not just prior to impending rent reviews.
Energy efficiency, cost savings and an improved working environment
can be achieved in most buildings by consulting an experienced
professional.

EDINBURGH'S office market is continuing to undergo structural changes
as occupiers embrace new technology in order to maintain a competitive
position at the leading edge of their respective markets.
Constraints on space have fuelled the expansion of the historic office
core to the south-west of the city, creating a new business district
known as the Exchange. It is only a few minutes' walk from Charlotte
Square and Princes Street.
Anchored by the new Edinburgh International Conference Centre and
headquarters buildings for Standard Life, Scottish Widows and Baillie
Gifford, if one includes Capital House and Saltire Court, more than
800,000 sq ft of offices have already been developed or are under
construction.
The attraction of The Exchange as a business location is easy to
understand. All city centre facilities are on the doorstep and the
Sheraton and Caledonian Hotels form an integral part of the scheme. Many
of the city's best shops and restaurants are within easy walking
distance.
Further commitment to The Exchange was provided recently with the
announcement that Exchange Plaza, the office flagship of The Exchange,
will be developed on a speculative basis by CALA Morrison, a
joint-venture partnership between two of Scotland's leading development
companies. The development is pre-funded by the Railways Pension Fund
Trustee Company.
Exchange Plaza will extend over seven levels, offering 100,000 sq ft
of open-plan offices, with space for 48 cars in its integral basement
garage. The building also has potential to provide a banking hall and
retail/restaurant facilities.
The main floors will offer from 13,638 sq ft to 16,878 sq ft of
open-plan space and each one can be sub-divided into two zones, offering
a good degree of flexibility not only in terms of space planning but
also in control of services installations.
CALA Morrison is confident its detailed research into client demand
has produced a building capable of adapting to all tenant requirements,
both from the space planning and services installation view points.
Construction is due to begin on Exchange Plaza this summer with
completion anticipated in 1997. At this very early stage, it is
encouraging to note that there are a number of companies already
expressing tentative interest. The joint letting agents on the project
are Ryden, Jones Lang Wooton and Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.

GLASGOW is now regarded by many national retailers as the most
important retailing city outwith London. As a consequence, new names and
concepts guarantee change in the prime locations, which will in turn
filter through the whole property system and encouraging movement in
various sectors of the market. Kookai, Ortak, Karen Millen, Strand and
Tower Books are all new faces on the Scottish High Street and they will
be joined by many more.
Further change is guaranteed and the question asked by many is: why
not let it be? To answer this, it is worth considering a few of the
fundamental characteristics of retailing and shopping patterns.
Recent retailing history has seen a major shift to out-of-town
locations pioneered by the supermarket and DIY chains. In-town
department stores have gradually disappeared from the High Street.
Escalating costs and an inability to keep pace with changing shopping
patterns means many famous names, including Arnotts, Lewis's, Pettigrew
&amp; Stevens, Daly's and Goldbergs, have disappeared from the city.
Another characteristic has been the in-town positioning of discount
operators, often confined to off-pitch locations and, in many instances,
selling seconds or inferior goods.
Why did this move out of town happen? Retailers increasingly agreed
that items such as furniture and large electrical goods would be best
sold out of the centre, which is why retail warehouse parks have become
a major feature over the past 10 years. They allow operators larger,
more affordable space with more convenient parking.
Change in this particular sector may, however, be on the way as the
Scottish Office has recently released draft planning guidelines in an
effort to protect town centres. This follows a Government directive to
tighten up on out-of-town developments and bring Scotland in line with
south of the Border. Basically, the proposal is to encourage retailers
to look to the town centre and minimise the heavy reliance on private
transport generated by out-of-town shopping.
These development restrictions should, therefore, boost the
performance of High Street shopping and perhaps the re-emergence of some
department store type operators. Evidence of this can already be seen --
Gerald Weisfeld, found of the What Every Woman Wants chain, has
purchased the former Goldbergs flagship store in Glasgow. He is believed
to be planning to convert it into a discount clothing emporium following
the refurbishment of the currently derelict 350,000 sq ft building.
Not all the city centre department stores have disappeared. The House
of Fraser store in Buchanan Street is regarded as one of the most
attractive retail outlets in Europe.
Could we be moving full circle with the re-emergence of in-town
department store operators? The large amount of space they require is,
of course, a major restriction. With few alternatives available to the
John Lewis Partnership, which has raised its space requirement to
330,000 sq ft, it is not surprising that work is due to begin on the
Buchanan Centre at the elbow of Sauchiehall and Buchanan Streets later
in the year. This is a rather depressing pocket of Glasgow city centre,
in desperate need of investment, despite the prominence of the concert
hall. Assuming the surrounding owners are willing to accept realistic
property advice, there should be an impressive overall facelift to this
location.
Everyone loves a bargain and Scotland may shortly see factory outlets
offering well-known brand names and the opportunity to sell quality
goods at a 30% to 50% discount on High Street prices. A scheme under
consideration by McArthur Glen in Stirling has accelerated interest in
similar developments in other parts of the country. However, this
American concept may be the first casualty of the new planning
guidelines restricting out-of-town development.
The Braehead Park retail development on the Clyde will be another
major change. Capital Shopping Centres has recently been appointed as
joint development partner for the #225m shopping-led scheme being
promoted by Sainsburys and Marks &amp; Spencer. There is concern over the
effect a development of this size would have on other centres. However,
this challenge is by no means new. For the past decade many towns and
cities have been forced to adapt and retaliate to competition. I believe
the completed Braehead scheme will draw people from all over the region,
rather than just the city.
Retaliation in response to improved retailing facilities elsewhere can
be seen in Lanarkshire where Hamilton, Coatbridge and Motherwell are all
experiencing the effects of the spectacularly successful East Kilbride
development. One of our own clients has been chosen by Motherwell
District Council to develop approximately 50,000 sq ft of prime retail
accommodation due for completion in July. Smith Newiss is joint agent
with King Sturge, and we are confident other retailers will follow
Woolworths into the scheme, which we expect to be fully pre-let at rents
around #45 per sq ft.
Those Scottish towns which refuse to invest in professional property
advice to help them keep pace with the changing retailing environment
will suffer a slow death. No amount of Government intervention will
revitalise a centre which does not provide the consumer with the
required choice and high standard of service. This has been the
experience not only in other British towns and cities, but also other
countries including the US.
Glasgow and many of the surrounding towns are certainly not standing
still. Through healthy competition and a sensible degree of planning
control, the retail environment should improve to the ultimate benefit
of the consumer, who is, after all, the most important person.
Retailers agree that items such as furniture and large electrical
goods would be best sold out of the town centre
The Scottish Office has recently released draft planning guidelines in
an effort to protect town centres.

THE disposal of property under the auctioneer's hammer has been a
well-used sales method south of the Border, but in Scotland there has
been a reluctance to adopt this method and its potential has not been
fully realised.
With the impending need for the New Towns to dispose of assets at the
best possible prices for the Development Corporations, those companies
in Scotland offering auctioneering will have a new avenue to exploit
their services.
The current directives for asset disposal incorporate guidelines which
the Development Corporations and their advisers must follow, namely:
1. Comprehensive marketing.
2. Secure the best possible price in the current market conditions.
3. Obtain disposals within pre-determined time scales.
Due to the limited time scales set down by the Scottish Office,
auctions might prove the only effective way of securing sales complying
to the guidelines, particularly with regard to competition for similar
types of asset disposal.
The recent asset disposals of Scottish Enterprise, controlled by
similar guidelines, is a perfect example.
One firm saw the advantage of auctions early on. McEvoy Vigers, now
part of Grimley, undertook its inaugural sale in Glasgow in 1984, when
such a concept was virtually unknown. The Scottish Region of the British
Rail Property Board supplied the first 45 lots and 44 were successfully
sold at levels substantially above their reserves.
Following this initial success regular auctions have been held in
Glasgow, and occasionally in Aberdeen and Edinburgh, for an
ever-increasing variety of individual, corporate, and public-sector
clients.
With the merger of Grimley J. R. Eve in 1992 this programme has been
maintained. Indeed, the two post-merger sales have been among the most
successful in terms of receipts, with Scottish Enterprise being the
primary client in each case.
While we continue to see a positive future for auctions in Scotland,
there has been a reluctance for others to follow this route. This might
be attributed in part to the fact that in Scotland, the invitation of
offers in excess of a quoted figure is common -- almost a blind auction
-- and the legal system goes some way to avoiding the ''subject to
contract'' delays that can bedevil private treaty sales in England.
Few people tend to offer their highest figure when offers-over are
sought. Rather they bid the lowest figure at which they estimate they
will be successful.
This might, of course, be substantially in excess of the estimate of
other prospective purchasers and the system has the obvious advantage
when one party has special interests and competition is unlikely to be
fierce.
The timescale to co-ordinate an auction varies between eight and 10
weeks, with the marketing process taking place over the last four weeks.
Solicitors acting for the sellers are required to provide the relevant
Special Conditions of Sale and Articles of Roup for inclusion in the
catalogue and to make the titles available for inspection by prospective
bidders or their solicitors.
An auction has particular merits when public assets or those being
sold by executors, creditors, or receivers are concerned, where justice
should be seen to be done, and where time is of the essence.
A deposit, normally 10%, is taken in the saleroom and the balance of
the purchase price is payable on a pre-determined date, usually 28 days
later.
The bidder is deemed to have completed all investigations relating to
the title, tenancies, and planning prior to the auction and buys on the
basis of Articles of Roup and the General and Special Conditions of
Sale.
Failure to complete a purchase on the date of entry requires the
defaulting purchaser to compensate for any deficit on resale.
The fixed time scale between the auction and completion reduces the
risk of delay to which suspensive conditions can often give rise.
Lots tend to be offered at an undisclosed reserved price fixed to the
lower end of the range of reasonable expectation, since most people
attend auctions in the hope of securing a bargain. This rationale,
however, might be forgotten when the subjective influence of overt
competition takes over.
If the reserves are set too high, not only will those lots fall flat
but the impetus of the entire auction might be lost. For this reason the
auctioneer reserves the right to withdraw any lot if the seller insists
upon an unrealistic reserve.
It must, however, be recognised that an auction cannot guarantee a
sale and a seller must be reconciled to the possibility that the reserve
price will not be exceeded.
The auction disposal method comes into its own where competition can
be anticipated, where public exposure is desirable, and where the
property is such that leisurely deliberation would be unlikely to result
in an offer or where uniqueness suggests that the market should
establish values.
We have now established a sound platform for commercial property
auctions, but the residential market to which the traditional Scottish
bidding system might have been thought to provide an easy introduction
has proved difficult to conquer.
This is perhaps due to the innate suspicion, possibly at times
encouraged by some solicitors, that property coming to the market in
this way is suspect and of low quality.
That is a battle yet to be entered on any meaningful scale but an era
of considerable opportunity for firms in the future.
In the meantime, auctions will continue to provide a quick, clean, and
high-publicity medium through which to sell properties and the market is
only now realising the opportunities that lie ahead.

WILSON Jamieson never imagined when he was standing in front of his

or adding the finishing touches to Givenchy scarves.
It would be wrong to describe Sterling Embroidery as Mr Jamieson's
second career as he had several others before joining the teaching
profession. He started off his adult life as a house painter before
going into retail management and eventually lecturing.
However, he had always fancied being his own boss and three years ago
took early retirement from his lecturer's position at Jordanhill College
in Glasgow.
He was undecided on what type of business to enter until a
computerised embroidery machine at a franchise exhibition at the SECC
caught his eye.
Wilson Jamieson was uncertain about committing #25,000 to buy the
machine as he had no experience in this type of business when out of the
blue a Stirling based school outfitting firm contacted him about the
possibility of him providing sweatshirts with the local school logos
attached.
''They had considered buying one of the machines themselves but
decided that they would only really be using it for two or three months
each year but the firm who supplies the machines recalled my interest
and put them in touch with me,'' he said.
The retired lecturer decided to take the plunge backed by the promise
of orders from the school outfitters.
''It turned out that they were actually a bit over-optimistic about
the number of sweathshirts they would sell with the logos attached but I
did not know that at the time, and started the business.''
Sterling Embroidery now supply more than 30 schools around Stirling
and have moved into other areas of business including stitching the Al
Italia airline logo on to scarves as well as for the French perfume
company Givenchy.
''Our process actually builds up the design stitch by stitch on the
material but it is all computer controlled,'' explains Wilson Jamieson.
Many of Sterling Embroidery's orders comes from golf and bowling clubs
but before the New Year they were asked to stitch Transmitting Live on
to 1000 Runrig wooly hats for their live appearance in Edinburgh at
Hogmanay.
One more unusual order was for a farmer who breeds Limousin cows.
''The farmer's logo is a picture of a cow facing the other way and the
words Carse Limousins across its rear end, it was certainly highly
orignal,'' smiled Mr Jamieson.

WHEN any bank or financial institution considers a lending proposition
there are certain key factors which are taken into consideration:
* Who is it lending to?
* What is it lending on?
* How will the loan be repaid and serviced?
* What is the asset/product being advanced as a security worth?
* How easily can the value of the assets be realised if a sale is
required?
Obviously, experienced commercial bankers will have the ability to
judge the character of their potential clients, consider in detail any
business plan put forward to service the loan, and generally be in a
position to evaluate the overall transaction.
They do require advice however, particularly with respect to
investments in commercial property, on the value of the property both in
terms of bricks and mortar and the lease upon which it may be held and
as such the security of the income flow.
Nowadays, it would appear many of the lending institutions are looking
for an additional service from commercial valuers. Not only do they want
to know the value of the property assets, they are now looking for the
surveyor to provide what can only be described as an insurance against a
substantial drop in value -- say more than 10% over a relatively limited
period.
In recognition of this change in perception of the valuer's role, and
particularly in light of the level of claims made against valuers,
insurance companies dealing with professional indemnity -- those left in
the market that is -- are increasing premiums to a level which do not
leave the surveyor in a position to undertake the work at an economic
level.
Within the next three to five years, unless the situation changes
significantly, there will only be a very restricted number of chartered
surveyors available, or rather prepared to undertake valuation work. The
problems associated with this will not simply be that the remaining
practices, having taken out huge professional indemnity policies, will
charge in a similar manner but, and probably more important, the quality
and accuracy of valuations will reduce dramatically.
Anyone involved in the instruction of valuation work will appreciate
that there are two types of report that may be received.
There are those produced in immaculate form, using the standard house
style of the major international practices. While instruction will
usually be given to a senior member of staff or partner, the work will
not necessarily be carried out by them. Such larger practices have a
broad awareness of the UK market but may not necessarily have the same
detailed knowledge as some of the local ones.
The second option for banks is to use the small to medium firms with
detailed knowledge of their patch, where the local bank manager has a
close working relationship with his or her valuer contact and can rely
on a quick and accurate report in a succinct form which has already been
tried and tested. They will also be able to make the off-the-record
telephone calls which can often be of more value than the written and
qualified report.
When only relatively few firms have the financial capability, in terms
of professional indemnity, to undertake commercial reports and
valuations, clients can forget the 24 or 48-hour response. They will
have to book time far in advance. Partner level contact/input will all
but disappear as will in-depth local knowledge.
So what are the options? First, surveyors could form limited liability
companies, insure for any individual claims up to, say, #250,000 and be
prepared to liquidate if an inordinately high claim was warranted.
Second, individual firms could take out a policy for a single claim
of, say #250,000, and in the event of any particular instruction being
more than, say, #500,000, a specific fee would be agreed for the job
together with an individual insurance policy. It must be noted, however,
that such a policy would have to allow for run-off for a minimum of five
years. How many clients would be prepared to pay such an amount for a
single valuation?
A third option, and one which I would strongly recommend, is that
valuers undertake to accept responsibility for the first #250,000 of any
claim, would insure accordingly, and thereafter the lender would have to
suffer any further loss. While this may at first seem abhorrent to
lenders, it is the banker's job to take the risk -- and the reward --
unless, of course, it can be shown the valuer acted fraudulently.
The valuer's role in the property lending market is to advise the
lender and, indeed, the client on the value of a particular property or
group of properties. He or she is not there to provide an insurance
service against potential losses. Unless the current situation is
changed dramatically, lenders and clients will be faced with a select
band of national practices who do not have in-depth local knowledge,
cannot respond within an acceptable time scale, and whose fees would be
astronomical.

A #30,000 investment by Scotch Premier Meat at its Edinburgh abattoir
and meat processing factory could extend the season for Scottish lamb.
The company, part of the Inverurie-based ANM Group, will soon be using a
new section of its lamb line for the electrical stimulation of carcases
to give enhanced tenderness.
Stuart Gorman, general manager of the Edinburgh plant, explained:
''After the end of the year the lamb quality drops as the animal gets a
bit older. Because of seasonality the quality of lamb imported from New
Zealand at this time of the year has been seen to be a bit better.''
However, he said, most customers would, out of loyalty, prefer the
home-killed product if they could be guaranteed the right quality and
consistency.
Scotch Premier has, in fact, gone to New Zealand for the new
technology it is applying to its lamb line. The theory is that
electrical stimulation will counteract the shrinkage of the muscles
which occurs after slaughtering and makes meat a tougher. ''This
equipment relaxes the muscles and makes the lambs more tender,'' Mr
Gorman said.
''This innovation is being viewed with a great deal of interest by
existing and potential customers, who tend to switch their lamb-buying
policies region by region throughout the UK as the season progresses. If
we can develop the system and it is accepted we would like to think we
could create a more consistent lamb business, slaughtering over a longer
period throughout the year.''
The current season for Scottish lamb tends to start in late August,
about three months after the south of England. At the peak of the season
Scotch Premier Meat would expect to be slaughtering between 6000 and
8000 lambs a week, tailing off to about 3000 at this time of the year.
Electrical stimulation would not be required for young lambs but would
be introduced as a means of extending the season with slightly older
ones.
The method is already being used in one Irish plant but the company
believes it will be the first to introduce it in the UK.
Since becoming part of the ANM Group about 18 months ago, through-put
at the Edinburgh abattoir has increased enormously. Cattle numbers have
doubled to reach about 1000 a week on average. A similar number of pigs
are also slaughtered in an average week.
The Scotch Premier plants at Edinburgh and Inverurie supply both
supermarket chains and High Street butchers throughout the UK.
Roy Smith has just joined the Edinburgh operation as senior sales
executive with particular responsibility for increasing supermarket
business. For the past 10 years he was senior fresh meat and poultry
buyer with the William Low group.
The company is also developing export markets in Italy, France,
Belgium and Holland with full-time sales staff appointed in Italy and
France.
As the company name implies, all of its output comes from livestock
reared on Scottish farms.

OLE Willumsen is a Dane who works for a Swedish company and is based
in Scotland.
He arrived in Scotland last November to take over the position of
managing director of DP Nova's operations in Glasgow.
DP Nova is Sweden's largest dental laboratory company who took over a
Glasgow dental lab in 1989 to give them a foothold in the Common Market,
as it was then known, with the aim of exporting ''falsers'' to other
European countries.
Since setting up in Glasgow DP Nova have spent #1.2m on new laboratory
facilities, and are introducing titanium into our dentures.
According to Mr Willumsen, titanium has a number of qualities which
make it ideal for false teeth, though most uf us know it as a metal
associated with golf clubs and missiles.
Although titanium is as strong as stainless steel it is very light
and, because it is a pure metal, there is less danger of people being
allergic to it. These qualities make it very suitable for use in
dentures.
''In Sweden we do about 12,000 titanium castings every year, and we
believe this type of denture has got a big future in the UK,'' says Ole
Willumsen.
At present DP Nova's Glasgow lab supplies not only dentists in
Scotland but also practices in Ireland, and as far south as Birmingham.
The company has already started to export with regular orders going to
Iceland.
''We came here because of the Common Market. In Sweden our industry
does not export at all but we believe we can export from Scotland. There
is no real problem with this as the business is conducted through the
post,'' explained Ole.
At present DP Nova employ 54 staff in Glasgow but they hope to build
this up to 80 as the popularity of their titanium impressions grow.
''At present we do around 20,000 dentures a year from our Glasgow base
but we are the only company in Scotland with the equipment to produce
the titanium denture, and the machine costs #55,000 alone,'' says DP
Nova's managing director.
When he is not worrying about other people's teeth you can normally
find Mr Willumsen on a golf course. He enjoys the sport and can boast a
handicap of five, although some of his colleagues have suggested that
they must count differently in Scandinavian countries.

BRITAIN's 27,000 dairy farmers are expected to share a bill of at
least #40m for over-production in the past year, Agriculture Minister
William Waldegrave said yesterday.
In addition, he promised his Ministry and other officials were giving
the highest priority to tracking down producers trying to escape the
penalties by dealing in black market milk.
''Where there is evidence that offences are being committed the
offenders will run the risk of heavy fines, possible imprisonment, and
payment of super levy on undeclared sales of milk. I hope that everyone
who hears my words will take this message to heart.''
Mr Waldegrave, who was speaking at the opening of the Royal
Association of British Dairy Farmers' annual two-day conference at
Malvern, went on to dismiss suggestions that speculators -- such as
football clubs or celebrities -- had been pushing up the price of
quotas. There was no hard evidence of this.
''A much more plausible explanation is that higher milk prices have
resulted in higher than usual production as a result of which there has
been an increase in demand for the limited supply of leasable quota,
thus forcing up quota prices. This is elementary economics.''
Quotas were here to stay at least until the year 2000, he said. But
while it was the Government's ultimate objective to eliminate them
altogether, he added that realistically the continuing high prices would
encourage excess production and elimination would be difficult. Downward
pressure on prices was the other route.
''Unless there is some unexpected development in the next five years,
I think the debate on the future of the quota system will focus on ways
of easing the current restrictions rather than removing them
altogether.''
There would be further pressure for a cut in quotas as a result of the
GATT agreement. But this would be resisted by Britain in favour of
further cuts in support prices.
''There is clear evidence that successive reductions in support prices
over the past three years have done much to stabilise the market for
dairy products in the EU without resorting to a quota cut. We want to
see more of the same.''
At the same time, he promised to continue to press for temporary quota
transfers across national boundaries.
He urged dairy farmers to get into perspective the relatively small
loss of total farm income resulting from disruption to the veal calf
export trade.
''Moreover, it is vital that we sell any extra meat we produce because
of reductions in live calf exports, rather than relying on subsidy
schemes such as beef intervention or the calf slaughter scheme.''

Hillier Parker Research's Office Rate of Return Index for May 1988 to
November 1994 (left) shows returns on Scottish offices (top line), all
offices (middle line) and West End offices (bottom line). May 1988 is
taken for the base indice of 100
AN eminent politician once referred to the green shoots of recovery in
an attempt to convince us that an economic upswing was just around the
corner. Unfortunately, it was some time before this sighting could
actually be confirmed, by which time the optimistic politician was
pursuing other interests.
If one were a cynic, and of course this animal does not exist within
the property sector, it could be argued that he had been attempting to
talk-up the market. It could also be argued that we have been guilty of
the same practice. However, commentators throughout the nineties have
remained optimistic. Indeed one journal in 1993 ran an article entitled
''Steady demand fuels evolving market''. This was in a year when office
take-up was at an all-time low and Edinburgh's New Town was being
deserted by the likes of Shepherd &amp; Wedderburn WS, Dundas &amp; Wilson CS
and KPMG.
While agents talked of limited stock and rising demand on the one
hand, they were busy introducing a code of conduct to control an ever
increasing number of letting boards on the other. Meanwhile, the recent
acquisition of Bell Ingram by Chestertons is evidence of over-capacity
in a market undergoing radical change.
With so many false dawns, it is easy to be cynical about talk of
recovery. However, the recession which rolled into Edinburgh in the
nineties has distracted attention from a radical restructuring of the
capital's office market, which has left it far better placed to face the
upturn which both economic indicators and an increasing number of
enquiries for office space suggests is underway, albeit at a cautious
pace. For the first time, Edinburgh can compete on the British and
international stages on an equal footing.
What is also perhaps often overlooked is that, despite the adversity
facing it, the city's office market has continued to out-perform all
other geographical regions. The Office Rate of Return Index, produced by
Hillier Parker Research, incorporates capital values and investment
yields. Since November 1989, Scottish offices have shown increasing
rates of return against declining rates in the all office and West End
indices. This has been achieved while the market has undergone the most
radical restructuring in its history.
The Edinburgh office market has struggled to reinvent itself in the
face of a recessionary tide in the early nineties which reduced take-up
by more than 35% and witnessed prime rentals falling from #26 per sq ft
to under #20 per sq ft. Traditionally, the market has been artificially
sustained by the tight planning controls restricting the development of
the historic New Town. The result has been a limited pipeline of
development, a healthy excess of demand over supply, and a rather less
healthy scenario of major companies trading from space inadequate for
their requirements or severely in need of upgrading.
What is now emerging is a revitalised Edinburgh well positioned to
benefit from an improving market. This has involved three significant
changes.
The first stage was the relocation of some of its premier Charlotte
Square occupiers to Scottish &amp; Metropolitan's Saltire Court at Castle
Terrace. The landmark building, totalling 190,000 sq ft, was let at
record rents upon completion in 1992. This confirmed a demand for such
space and in one blow seized the crown so long worn by Charlotte Square.
The second stage has been the emergence of the business park. This was
an inevitable reaction to the constraints on central Edinburgh, and
several of the city's larger users are taking advantage of the lower
rental levels, high levels of car parking and pleasant
micro-environment.
It is interesting to note, however, that Lothian Regional Council
recently indicated it would be looking long and hard in future at
reducing the level of car parking attached to such developments. This
may involve securing significant contributions from occupiers to improve
public services to such sites, making them less attractive to potential
occupiers.
However, Scottish Equitable (305,000 sq ft), John Menzies (48,000 sq
ft) and ICL (32,000 sq ft) have already taken space at Edinburgh Park,
the 138-acre scheme currently being developed through the joint-venture
vehicle of Miller Developments and Edinburgh Development &amp; Investment.
McQueen, an American software company, has leased the 34,000 sq ft
Calder House at Pentland Gait, another business park development by EDI.
The third phase of this restructuring involves the proposed
development of up to two million sq ft of offices around the Edinburgh
International Conference Centre at Lothian Road. This has changed the
shape of the traditional rectangular office core between St Andrew
Square, George Street and Charlotte Square.
We are witnessing the development of a business core akin to that of
the City of London. The impressive EICC is providing the perfect focal
point for this. Two major schemes are currently in the pipeline, with
EICC's 30,500 sq ft Conference House already under construction. This
area will compete more with the tenants who would otherwise seek
business park accommodation than with buildings in the New town.
And the result of this metamorphosis undertaken in the depth of a
recession? A new improved Edinburgh that offers both existing occupiers
and those considering a relocation to the city a range of opportunities.
Historically, the capital has struggled to offer modern floor space
capable of satisfying today's business user. For the first time the
occupier has a choice. Edinburgh is now able to accommodate a range of
users. Those seeking high specification large floor plates will be able
to choose between the modernist developments on Lothian Road, a business
park location and equally highly specified redevelopments behind
existing facades in the New Town.
The redrawing of the office map would have been painful at any time,
but in the depths of a recession its effect on the traditional New Town
has been significant. This is an unavoidable consequence of
restructuring. Occupiers who until recently had little alternative to
the often inefficient Georgian buildings have moved out. Touche Ross,
for example, is in the process of relocating to a modern development at
39 George Street. Larger occupiers find open-plan space more efficient.
Indeed, it is this sector of the open-plan market, from 10 to 25,000 sq
ft, that may well face a shortage of space in the near future.
Small users, however, are often happy to remain in more traditional,
refurbished accommodation. Hillier Parker recently relocated a tenant
into one of the buildings formerly occupied by Shepherd &amp; Wedderburn in
Charlotte Square. It had been one of the terrace occupied by the
solicitor. The property has been returned to its previous configuration.
Some former New Town office buildings are being returned to
residential use. Hillier Parker and Chestertons are negotiating the sale
of three adjoining buildings totalling 17,000 sq ft in Drumsheugh
Gardens to a residential developer. This trend will continue, especially
on the periphery of the core office area, and only the better quality
buildings will secure occupiers.
The economic indicators are supported by increased activity within the
office market in Edinburgh. Rumours currently circulating indicate deals
have been agreed at Apex House and 3/11 Melville Street for the letting
of more than 20,000 sq ft. Both buildings have been on the market for
some time.
Speculative developers are also becoming increasingly confident, as
buildings with refurbishment potential attract increasing attention.
Underlining this new found confidence, the TSB Group Pension Trust has
taken the decision to begin refurbishment of 7200 sq ft of office space
at Melville Street. It will be marketed through Hillier Parker at a
rental of #14 per sq ft.
The market is, therefore, not simply being ''talked-up''. Both
property indicators and activity are reacting to the improving economic
conditions. The office stock has fallen from 1.75 million sq ft in
September 1993 to under 1.5 million sq ft. The Edinburgh that enters the
last five years of the 20th century is a quite different one from that
which began the decade.

Janet Reid is enlightened by a couple who are keeping the rich
tradition of fine stained glass alive in Scotland
BETWEEN 1890 and 1910 Glasgow was the best place in the word for
stained glass. As the second City of the Empire, its wealth and artistic
patronage extended from the grand scale and magnificent variety of
dozens of impressive Victorian buildings in which stained glass was
incorporated into splendid cupolas and into huge and glorious, richly
coloured and vivid illustrations from literature, to the many relatively
modest middle-class homes where tiny, beautifully depicted pictures on
windows, fanlights, and stairlights were common.
How very fortunate then, that exactly 100 years later, there is a
company capable once more of producing the high-quality stained glass
for which Glasgow was famous. Because, as we approach the twenty-first
century, not only is the great art and architecture of Alexander
''Greek'' Thomson, Charles Rennie Mackintosh and a whole generation of
talented architects and designers and artists in stained glass now being
at last appreciated, but also a great deal of restoration work is
proving vitally necessary in order to preserve and restore the
splendours of the Glasgow Style of 100 years ago.
The company which has contributed so much towards this restoration and
preservation is the Stained Glass Design Partnership of Kilmaurs in
Ayrshire. Indeed, says Susan Bradbury, one of its two founding partners,
on Glasgow's Open Doors Day, there is scarcely a building open to the
public with which the firm has not been associated.
Yet this firm, which has made such a crucial contribution to the
stained glass of so many splendid centenarian buildings in Glasgow (and
to many outwith the city too) is a relative youngster. It was
established in 1982 in a disused byre in Irvine by two young artists in
stained glass -- Paul Lucky and Susan Bradbury.
From its small beginnings -- the two of them, says Bradbury, were only
just able to scrape a living which was so bare that they couldn't even
afford to buy a vehicle: they had to hire one when they needed one --
the firm has expanded to become the biggest of its kind in Scotland. A
company capable of designing and executing large-scale windows of
stained glass of a quality superior enough to be comparable with the
works of the talented Victorian and Edwardian craftsmen in glass for
which Glasgow is so renowned.
But their expertise and the excellence of their artistic and practical
stained glass skills relies more on chance than the above might suggest.
For Bradbury was once a primary school teacher in London who wanted to
learn a contrasting manual skill. She joined the queue for car
maintenance evening classes; and it was only because the queue was long
that she saw a poster for stained glass making. It captured her
imagination. She abandoned her original intention, joined the stained
glass evening class, and within a year she had thrown up her job and was
enrolled at Swansea Art College. Here, the only Art College in Britain
which runs courses for stained glass alone, she was able to build upon
and explore every aspect of the craft which she had fallen in love with
at her evening class: the subtleties and the glorious palette of colours
of handmade glass, the beautiful textures, the limitless scope for
creating pictures -- whimsical abstract designs, designs based on
heraldry, illustrations from poetry and the Bible, historic scenes, and
so on -- and the feel and the flexibility of the lead which holds the
jigsaw of stained glass together.
The three year course at Swansea was unusual in that it combined the
practical with the artistic, historical and creative. The result was
that when she left, she carried off a City and Guilds Diploma as well as
an Art Diploma: a thorough understanding of buildings and structural
criteria, and practical skills in mixing mortar and pointing stonework,
as well as an appreciation of art history, skills in life-drawing and
the knowledge and artistic capacity to design and produce stained glass
windows. And she also carried off her partner in the Stained Glass
Design Partnership: Paul Lucky had also been a student on the course.
And after two temporary years of separation in which Bradbury worked
as artist in residence for Irvine New Town, and Lucky did something
similar in Wales, they united once more to establish their stained glass
business. From the outset the firm built a solid foundation, and since
then every project accomplished has strengthened its reputation. The
first two achievements of their early years contrasted sharply. They
were commissioned to design and execute a vast sweep of windows for a
new art college in Newcastle: 33 square metres of windows on the theme
line and tone; and in Edinburgh they took out and restored the whole of
the Great South Window in Parliament Hall (originally installed in
1868). Some 8000 pieces of glass were removed, cleaned and repaired as
necessary and then reglazed into new lead before being reinstalled with
new supporting bars.
By 1989 the Stained Glass Design Partnership had outgrown the disused
byre. They moved to a redundant church building in Kilmaurs. Here there
is plenty of space and light for them and their six-strong team of
craftsmen, for drawing, designing, and cutting templates and then
cutting the glass itself from the stock of hundreds of subtly different
colours and textures which they keep; room for the workbenches for
painting and etching the glass, for assembling it into its leaded
jigsaw, and soldering the sealing it so that it is strong and waterproof
before final installation. Here windows have been made for all manner of
customers: the biggest stain glass window made since the war (larger in
area than a tennis court) was made for the Norwich Union Insurance
Company, incorporating in its design the elements of fire and water; a
window, its design based on the wings and verse from the psalms, was
produced for the RAF for its new church in Lossiemouth; and the
beautiful Pre-Raphaelite stained glass windows which illustrate
Tennyson's Idylls of the King in the recently refurbished Greek Thomson
mansion in Great Western Terrace have been brilliantly restored by
Bradbury and Lucky's team.
Approximately half of their current work is for new commissions --
many of these in England, and some abroad. The rest of their time is
spent in the wide range of restoration work, most of this done in
Scotland for a variety of different buildings in different parts of the
country. And though there's a huge number of projects on the horizon,
Bradbury and Lucky have no intention of expanding to the extent that
they are unable to be involved in the creative process itself -- after
all it's their own expertise that has made their lucky reputation; and
many a Scottish building has been the lucky beneficiary.

DURING our Nerd House coffee break yesterday, The Braces' newspaper
started to rustle and then to shake. When his face finally emerged from
behind, it was in full chuckle-mode.
''That Tony Blair,'' he said, ''what a marvellous script-writer he
has. 'Monopoly managers paying themselves Monopoly money'. Brilliant,
absolutely brilliant.''
But Ms Angelica Banana-Skyne, the High Whitecraigs polymath, was
stirring her second cup with that non-commital, pursed-lip expression
which usually means trouble. ''No it's not,'' she said. ''It is deeply
inaccurate and misleading.''
The chuckle-mode left The Braces' face as if erased by a wet haddock.
''Are you going to tell me,'' he asked Angelica, ''that a #2m pay
package for rattling something called a grid is a fair and reasonable
return? Have you been so long in the financial services sector that all
humanity has deserted your soul? Don't you feel envy any more, for
example?''
''That was not the point,'' said Angelica. ''The point was about the
term 'Monopoly money'.'' This was hardly a realistic jibe to make under
the circumstances. She would explain.
In ''Monopoly'', it was possible to buy a house in Trafalgar Square
for #150. Heavens, you were even allowed to build a house in Trafalgar
Square, planning permission apparently rubberstamped, for the same
amount. Mayfair was dearer, certainly, but you could rent a house there
for #200. ''Maybe that's for a couple of hours,'' she said
sarcastically.
She had also memorised some of the hazards and golden handcuffs that
lay in wait for ''Monopoly'' managers. ''Make general repairs on all of
your houses,'' she quoted. ''For each house pay #25. For each hotel pay
#100. Good grief,'' she added. Then there was ''your building loan
matures. Receive #150.'' That wouldn't give you more than a decent
dinner for four, with wine.
The Braces looked crushed: ''But it's the er, the metaphorical, er . .
.'' he mumbled.
By this time, though, Angelica and I had the bit between our teeth.
''Pay school fees of #150,'' we quoted. ''Drunk in charge: fine #20 . .
. Bank pays you dividend of #50.'' If this was really ''Monopoly''
money, there was little for Mr Major to do a U-turn about.
But the Braces doesn't give up easily. ''Do you realise that in
''Monopoly'', you can rent Fenchurch St Station for #25? This suggests
that the railways have been secretly privatised all along.''
We pondered this for a bit. We felt that Mr Blair's scriptwriter was
getting himself into deep water with this board game. We thought we
might sent him a fax: ''Forget Monopoly -- try Scruples.''
In the end we didn't bother, but it was a useful thought.
* THE Bank of Scotland is launching a credit card exclusive to
Trekkies, fans of the ongoing Star Trek cinema and television saga.''
And so . . .
In the twenty-third century, Spock stood uncertainly beside a
hole-in-the-wall machine in the Gork galaxy. He fingered his Trekky
card. Admiral Kirk stood beside him.
''Listen,'' said Spock, ''are you sure this is going to work? I've
never seen a creature like this before. It doesn't seem real.''
Kirk said: ''It's simple, Dr Spock. You shove in your card, the right
way up, then you enter your PIN number. It asks you what you want --
money, a print-out of your balance, a short homily on interest rates.
And away you go.''
''What's a PIN number?'' asked Spock. Kirk smote his forehead. There
would be no Indian carry-out for them that night.
* The difficulty in tracking down Mr Nick Leeson, formerly of Barings
Bank in Singapore, has puzzled us more than somewhat. We assume that an
all-cars message went out saying: ''Subject was last photographed
wearing a blazer in vertical stripes of gold and black, with clashing
tie. Do not approach without sunglasses.''
We have always wondered why dealers in the more exotic exchanges have
been made to wear such horrible livery -- pinks and lime-greens. Now we
know: but it's funny that it hasn't worked.

THE collapse of Pentos, the Dillons bookshops and Rymans stationery
chain, will arguably be keenest felt by Terry Maher, founder and ousted
chairman of the company in 1972. Mr Maher, a working class boy from
Manchester who left school at 16, bought Pentos for #100 and over the
next 20 years built it into a #250m retailing empire.
He was dubbed the consumers' champion as he led a vocal campaign
against the Net Book Agreement (NBA) in a bid to cut the price of books.
Mr Maher was credited with transforming book selling by opening large
stores in prime sites and stocking a huge amount of specialist and
general interest books.
However he is largely credited by the current management and many City
analysts with sowing the seeds of the group's destruction by
over-expanding during the consumer boom of the 1980s. The bulk of the
shop portfolio was located on high rent sites.
This left the group dangerously exposed when consumer confidence
collapsed during the recession. So much so that in 1993, the year when
Maher was forced out of the group, Pentos made a pre-tax loss of #70m on
sales of #240m. Rapid expansion of the group's retail operations
combined with declining profitability led to bank borrowings peaking in
1993 at about #87m.
In the first six months of 1994 there was a further pre-tax loss of
#36m, while the operating loss for those six months was almost as great
as that for the whole of 1993.
A Pentos spokesman said yesterday that, ''the new management worked
hard to rectify the problems they inherited but unfortunately Mr Maher's
legacy proved to be a poisoned chalice''. However, Mr Maher claims that
most of the problems Pentos faced in 1993 could have been overcome and
blames the current management of Sir Kit McMahon and Bill McGrath for
the group's collapse.
Following his appointment as chief executive in January 1994, Mr
McGrath initiated a comprehensive review of the strategic options
available. The review highlighted the group's weak financial position
and the need for decisive action. Following the review there was a #45m
rights issue at 25p a share to try to restore the group's balance sheet
and reduce debt.
Although the business concept for Pentos was good in the beginning, Mr
Maher failed to move with the times. ''He took his eye off the ball,''
said one close to the Pentos situation. There was little if any
investment in retail systems such as Electronic Point of Sale (EPOS), in
contrast to competitors such as market leader W H Smith. Stock control
and inventory management were also poor. Given consumers' continuing
caution when it comes to spending, it is vital for all retailers to
boost their operating efficiency in areas such as sales and distribution
if they are to grow profitability.
There will be those among booksellers and publishers who will be glad
to see the demise of Dillons as an independent entity given its
marketing strategy of selling cut-price books. The loss of one major
player in the bookselling market -- number two to W H Smith with 149
branches and annual sales of more than #140m -- paves the way for the
remaining groups to improve margins and increase their share of what is
a difficult market. A similar situation will occur in the DIY market
when price-cutting Texas Homecare is acquired by Sainsbury's Homebase.
However a spanner could be thrown in the works if Barnes &amp; Noble, the
leading American cut-price book retailer enters the UK market. It owns a
network of more than 200 bookstores across the US and has approached
Pentos in the past about a joint venture to build up a chain of book
superstores in the UK.
Barnes &amp; Noble discounts as much as 40% off the publishers'
recommended price. Its stores with their coffee shops, browsing areas,
and other facilities, are said to be replacing singles bars as a way for
unattached New Yorkers to meet. The stores stay open seven days a week
from nine in the morning until late at night and often offer
entertainment, ranging from string quartets to poetry reading and puppet
shows for children.
If Dillons and Rymans are acquired by rival organisations and stripped
of their own trading names they will join a growing list of High Street
casualties. These include Clydesdale, the Scottish electrical chain,
Zodiac Toys, supermarket group Fine Fare, and shoe retailer Timpsons.

IT took Marco Giannasi more than three years to buy Battlefield Rest
in Glasgow to turn it into a bistro.
His first two attempts failed when the local authority accepted other
offers to rent the premises but these ventures never came to anything
and Marco won through at his third attempt.
He explains: ''I first showed an interest in 1990 but someone else
offered a higher rent but I kept my eye on the building and nothing
seemed to be happening. I contacted the Estates Department and I was
told that the first person could not carry on with his plans but they
were offering it to another person but again nothing happened so I
phoned them again, and it was a case of third time lucky.
Marco believes that if you want something bad enough you will
eventually succeed.
''I finally ended up buying the building rather than renting it, but
it had become very dilapidated through many years of neglect,'' says
Marco.
The Italian restaurateur had studied architecture in his youth and
admits that he was, ''more excited about the building than the
restaurant side of the business''.
Battlefield Rest was built in 1914 and was originally a tram station
known in colloquial terms as a ''bundy'' where tram workers would check
in to show they were on time, and shift changes were made.
It is one of the few remaining buildings of its kind, being completely
clad in a particular type of tile.
''It cost #60,000 just to replace the tiles on the outside of the
building,'' explains Marco who was born above his father Luigi's Canasta
restaurant in Parliamentary Road, Glasgow.
Marco however was sent by his parents to Italy when he was six years
old to be educated, and did not return to Scotland until 1972 when he
was 18.
His father had by this time opened up the L'Ariosto restaurant in
Glasgow, and after his father's death in 1974 Marco ran the restaurant
until 1979.
He was running the Toscana bistro in Milngavie when he spotted that
the disused Battlefield Rest building was on the market.
Marco finally bought the building, and together with his partner Joe
Moretti whom many people will remember from his time as food manager in
the Holiday Inn, Glasgow and Cameron House set about creating another
bistro.
Restoring the building was an expensive operation, and the entire
project cost #240,000.
''We received #100,000 in various grants but it was still a big
investment for us.''
At first the bistro did not have a licence and customers had to bring
their own wine, but this difficulty has now been overcome.

A FEW moons ago, I found myself writing an article on the Glasgow
office market and, in usual commercial property agent style, I was
highly optimistic. I adopted a ''get them while they're hot as they
won't last long'' approach. The last couple of years have shown this to
be a somewhat misplaced optimism, and the Glasgow office market has
endured an extended period of relative flatness.
At the risk of being accused of crying wolf again, it does seem that
1995 will see a return to a more balanced market.
The buyer's market conditions are continuing, but the terms a
prospective occupier can command now will not be available when Santa
visits us all again.
The supply of new office stock stands at around 530,000 sq ft but of
that 90,000 sq ft is formally under offer. Even excluding the sale of
the former BP headquarters at 301 St Vincent Street to Abbey National
(325,000 sq ft), the total amount of new office space taken up in 1994
extended to around the 10-year average of 350,000 sq ft. The office
stock available, therefore, now equates to just over a year's supply.
Office take up statistics for 1995 were firmly kick-started by the
letting by P&amp;O Properties of the whole of the Grosvenor building
opposite Central Station in Gordon Street (52,000 sq ft) to Scottish
Amicable. The building was one of only two or three capable of providing
a large amount of floor space.
In addition, TSB has re-occupied No 2 Atlantic Quay (70,000 sq ft),
the Greater Glasgow Health Board is to re-occupy 225 Bath Street (86,000
sq ft), and there are rumours that The Prudential is considering setting
up a new operation within Kirkstane House in St Vincent Street, which
would involve a substantial part of the vacant space there being
re-occupied.
But, I hear you ask, what of demand? Certainly occupiers are still
cautious in committing to new accommodation, but there are a number of
transactions in the final stages of legal negotiation. Somewhat
unbelievably, we estimate the total floor space required to satisfy all
the potential requirements known to us would be in excess of 650,000 sq
ft. Realistically, one must treat this figure with a degree of
scepticism, questioning the seriousness of some of these requirements.
Some may also be tempted to new out-of-town accommodation.
But even if a modest percentage of these requirements find a home in
1995, the stock of new floorspace available will be substantially
diminished.
Demand has tended to be reasonably strong, if still cost conscious, in
the sub-5000 sq ft range, and there are a restricted number of options
available to the larger occupiers seeking 40,000 sq ft plus. Even that
Goliath of a building Tay House (162,000 sq ft) is close to welcoming a
further occupier, adding to the 50,000 sq ft already let.
One of the more serious manifestations of this shortage of larger
accommodation is that the highly successful business relocation team at
the Glasgow Development Agency is continuing to attract inward
relocating interest from footloose financial services organisations.
However, its members now run the risk of not being able to accommodate
them within the city's existing supply of new or even second-hand
buildings.
The Enterprise Zones and promotional bodies outwith Glasgow now have
their best opportunity of securing such occupiers to well specified
business park accommodation.
All this, one might think, is a classic recipe for creating more
offices. However, securing funding for speculative development on
economic terms has been not at all easy recently, as the major lending
institutions have been working through a history of bad debt situations
across the UK and abroad.
Only a limited number of developments are under way. The 31,000 sq ft
redevelopment of the site at 227 West George Street by Newland Assets
has recently revealed its stonework to the world as it nears completion.
Newland has also started work on the corner block at 183 St Vincent
Street to provide approximately 16,000 sq ft, and the floors are taking
shape at London Wiltshire's 129/131 St Vincent Street redevelopment
(23,000 sq ft).
At the larger end of the market, Friends Provident has recently
announced plans to proceed with demolition of the old Alhambra House in
Waterloo Street, and work will start on its replacement (92,000 sq ft)
later this year. Scottish Amicable has announced the purchase of Ashley
House in West George Street, where it plans to redevelop a large top
quality building of some 80,000 sq ft. At the Broomielaw, demolition has
started as part of the site clearance operations in connection with
phase II and the future phases of Bellhouse &amp; Joseph/Pillar's extensive
waterfront project. In the meantime, the only building under
construction is the comprehensive refurbishment of 48 St Vincent Street
by Scottish Life.
Further activity is planned but development and funding institutions
are cautious, being very much aware of the disastrous consequences a
couple of years down the line of a rush of development leading to
substantial over-supply again. Occupiers themselves are making their
buildings work harder by focusing on the density of occupation and total
cost. They are tending to take on leases close to the exact level of
floorspace they require and, where at all possible, a tenant's option to
break the lease at some point provides business flexibility.
Such is the drive for efficiency in office occupation, one wonders how
long it will be before some of the more major occupiers become involved
in the design of multi-million pound office developments and, indeed,
whether Glasgow will begin to see pre-let or bespoke office development
in addition to the speculative. Government departments and one or two of
the major accountancy and legal practices already have a clear view of
the type and specification of floorspace they are seeking. A logical
extension is that they should be involved in the design process.
Thanks to the Grosvenor and other transactions already nearing
conclusion, there is much more activity in the Glasgow office letting
market than this time last year. The developers and institutions with
buildings constructed in the late eighties and early nineties are seeing
an end to their pain.
Tenants are still able to command a healthy package of incentives when
taking office space, but the days of writing your own ticket appear to
be over. Developers are, quite rightly, taking a cautious, realistic
approach to the specification, design and pricing of new buildings.
Hopefully all this will result in the market moving to a state of
equilibrium rather than the old swingometer, lurching wildly from a
seller's to a buyer's market and then back again. We'll just have to
wait and see.

THE search is on to bring recognition to the driving-force companies
behind Renfrewshire's proud record as Scotland's industrial powerhouse.
Renfrewshire produces one-third of the country's manufactured exports
-- worth #2.5 billion each year -- and 40% of our total exports to
Europe; and it brings together the varied cultures of industry and
commerce, from traditional engineering and ship repair work to the
hi-tech worlds of computer production, silicon chips and international
finance.
Now The Herald and Renfrewshire Enterprise are joining forces to
introduce The Renfrewshire Business Awards. ''These are designed to
recognise excellence and achievement,'' says Jim Cunningham,
Renfrewshire Enterprise's Business Development Director. ''Many
individuals and companies earn their own rewards for hard work and
innovation but seldom achieve deserved public recognition.
''The Renfrewshire Business Awards will remedy that -- and also act as
a catalyst to help local companies promote their activities.''
Entries for the seven award categories, each recognising key sectors
of business activity, must be received by noon on April 7 and forms
detailing conditions of entry are available from Caren Hopkins, at
Renfrewshire Enterprise, 27 Causeyside Street, Paisley, or by calling
(041) 842 3522.
Entries will be examined by a panel of experts and those shortlisted
may be asked to meet the judges. Winners will be announced on May 25 at
a dinner presentation attended by 250 business persons.
Competition is sure to be strong as there are no fewer than 6000
businesses behind Renfrewshire's success story.
Some of Renfrewshire's big players are world-class names -- IBM,
Compaq, National Semiconductor, Chivas Brothers -- but there are
thousands more and all are constantly striving for excellence.
Companies employing up to 500 people are eligible and can submit
entries in as many of the seven award categories as they wish:
* Best New Business -- for companies which have recognised a market
niche and made an impact in the past two years. They will also be
looking for excellence in quality and customer satisfaction, in tandem
with a clear vision and realistic long-range plans.
* Export Achievement -- for companies which have addressed potential
export markets in a structured way and improved overall performance
through sales abroad.
* Best Skills Development -- recognising excellence in the
introduction of skills and training programmes over the past two years.
These must have had an impact on the development of individuals and the
competitive edge of their companies.
* Innovation -- to reward new thinking that has made a commercial
impact over two years. Innovation can apply to marketing, management or
human resource development, as well as technology.
* Best Growth Business -- the category for companies which can
demonstrate genuine growth and the introduction of best practice over
two years. Growth may be reflected in output, turnover, or profitability
but also new products or services or diversification into new activities
and new markets.
* Young Manager of the Year -- to be awarded in conjunction with the
Institute of Management and open to any manager under 35 on March 31,
1995. The judges will be seeking qualities such as skill, energy, drive,
enthusiasm and a focused approach which has had a tangible impact.
Nominations should be made by a senior manager, managing director or
chief executive.
* The Marketing Award -- to recognise an approach which illustrates a
thorough knowledge and understanding of the competition. The judges will
be looking for evidence of marketing as an integral part of overall
efforts.

IN the early days of Scottish business parks during 1989 developers
often thought the success of a business park depended primarily on good
motorway access. Slightly over five years down the line, with outline
planning permission for almost 16,000,000 sq ft of class 4 space in
Scotland, the majority in Strathclyde, the lesson is now being learned
that road links are only one of a number of important factors. This is
why there is little likelihood of the full 16,000,000 sq ft being built.
Pioneering companies who moved out to the early business parks, such
as Edinburgh West in South Gyle, found that although they benefited from
modern open-plan accommodation, reducing occupational cost compared to
similar city-centre property, and easy car access, they suffered from
high support staff turnover. This was primarily due to the lack of
facilities such as shopping, leisure, restaurants/bars and good public
transport.
The larger occupiers who moved to South Gyle, such as the Bank and
Royal Bank of Scotland, were also not immune to staff turnover. In the
case of The Royal Bank, this was despite providing a gymnasium, fitness
suite and canteen that is more akin to a restaurant. The problem lay in
the surrounding infrastructure which, five years ago, could not support
a business community that was expanding rapidly. It was not until the
opening of the Gyle shopping centre in September 1993 that the
infrastructure caught up and, as a result, the public transport system
improved dramatically.
New Edinburgh, the developer of Edinburgh Park, had from the outset
planned for a nursery, health and fitness club, restaurant/bar, hotel
and convenience shopping to cater for a potential 12,000 to 15,000
employees. In addition, a strip of land bisecting the park has been
reserved for the proposed route of the metro, although this is more
likely to be utilised for a bus way. There are also proposals for an
Edinburgh Park Railway Station on the main Glasgow-Edinburgh line.
South Gyle is rapidly becoming a new town in its own right, and on
completion of the retail park at Hermiston Gait the business community
will be well provided for into the 21st century.
However, this is an example on a grand scale with a number of parks
located adjacent to each other. What of the business park in isolation?
The needs of the business occupier are all important, especially the
changes in operational techniques. Many companies particularly in the
sales and service sector, but also accountants and other professional
firms, are becoming more mobile. This has led to an increase in hot
desking, with employees spending more time at clients' offices than in
their own. A business park location is, therefore, very attractive in
terms of road communications and cost.
Mercury has led the field in this respect, opting to move its sales,
marketing and customer strategy staff out to a purpose built 65,000 sq
ft office in Strathclyde Business Park.
Although business parks attract certain types of occupier, to appeal
to a broader range and continue to grow rather than stagnate they will
need to cater for the demand for leisure, shopping, restaurants, housing
and a good public transport.
This can already be seen today with the highly successful in-town
business park developments of Academy Park in Glasgow and Beaverbank in
Edinburgh. Meanwhile, two out-of-town multi-use developments are well
underway at Broadwood in Cumbernauld and Springkerse in Stirling.
Broadwood, which covers more than 200 acres, includes a residential
development, sports stadium with leisure, conference and banqueting
facilities, proposals for a retail park and a 250,000 sq ft business
park of which phase I (32,000 sq ft in two buildings) is now complete.
Some 21,000 sq ft was recently let to ScottishPower.
Springkerse already has a 167,000 sq ft retail park, with a 65,000 sq
ft Safeway superstore, fast-food units under construction and Forthbank
Stadium providing leisure and conference facilities adjacent to the
business park, which has planning permission for up to 300,000 sq ft.
Phase I, comprising a 25,000 sq ft open-plan office has recently been
completed. Phase II consists of a managed business centre offering
office suites from 250 sq ft to 4400 sq ft for small to medium size
companies. This is due for completion by the end of March.
Parks that are already in existence are also now responding to the
need to improve facilities, with the larger ones looking towards
providing hotel, leisure and restaurant facilities. Improvements to
public transport links are also being looked at more closely, mainly
thanks to Planning Policy Guidance Note 13, which more local planning
authorities appear to be adopting.
Business parks are here to stay and will continue to adapt to cater
for business demand well into the 21st century. In future the focus will
potentially be on multi-use developments, creating new parks close to
existing facilities such as retail parks or in-town developments so they
can take advantage of a mature infrastructure.
The needs of the business occupier
are all important, especially changes in operational techniques.
Business parks attract certain types of occupier, and if they want to
continue to grow rather than stagnate they will need to cater for the
demand for leisure, shopping, restaurants, housing and a good public
transport.

THE #38m Edinburgh International Conference Centre, which opens in
September, is set to go off with a bang.
Scotland's only purpose-built, city-centre, convention venue has
already secured 40 international association bookings which will bring a
net #30m to the city and Scotland. Conferences have been booked until
the year 2003.
Two major conferences which will be held simultaneously will be among
the opening events.
The first, LAN '95, on October 3 and 4, which will attract an
international audience of 400, will combine a network computing
conference and exhibition.
The exhibition is expected to draw more than 5000 visitors to see
product displays and technology demonstrations from some of the world's
foremost names in networking.
A spokesman said that LAN '95 had been conceived to meet the growing
demand for a conference and exhibition which would reflect the evolution
and growth in the reach of networking.
Networks were evolving past their natural boundaries to encompass the
most remote outposts and branch offices, which, until recently, were
rarely catered for in the corporate plan.
Teleworkers and nomadic workers were demanding the same resource and
facilities as central headquarters staff.
Networking was beginning to penetrate markets and environments never
before addressed by the network vendor community.
The spokesman said that LAN '95 was being deliberately staged in a
regional centre. The Edinburgh International Conference Centre was a
venue so modern that it came completely wired for networking.
''With business television services at every square metre and built-in
cable and satellite links, there has never been a better venue to stage
a networking event,'' he said.
''It is no coincidence, either, that Scotland benefits from an
assisted status in terms of telecommunications provision and that, per
business, Scotland invests more in information technology (IT) than any
other region in the UK.''
The spokesman added that the conference programme would combine three
tracks, technical, education, and strategical, and give delegates the
opportunity to cover every aspect of networking.
A live network linking a myriad of technologies, applications, and
operating systems would run throughout the event.
LAN '95 is to be launched in Edinburgh tomorrow. The keynote launch
speech will be given by Mr Ian Fraser, vice-president of Novell in
Europe. The Novell company is one of the leading sponsors of LAN '95.
The second conference, ISM '95, to be held on October 4, will be on
information systems management and will address the topic: ''Can
corporate Scotland survive the information revolution?''
It will bring together 100 senior business executives from finance,
banking, insurance, and assurance sectors.
A spokesman said the information revolution promised to split the
world into a two-tier economy of first and third world economies.
Companies could meet the challenges and achieve premier league status
or sink into the lower divisions.
The aim of the conference would be to show how businesses had already
begun to embrace the digital information revolution and were beginning
to make a positive difference.
Organisers of both of these conferences praised the Edinburgh centre.
Scotland was internationally regarded as a high-innovation country, a
fact supported by the influx of foreign, high-techology companies. This
made Edinburgh an excellent forum.
When the centre opens on September 17, its first convention will be
hosted by Kwik Fit, the automotive parts, repair, and replacement
organisation.
To celebrate its silver jubilee, Kwik Fit will hold a one-day group
conference to be attended by 1200 of its staff.

Anne McKelvie meets David Statt, a psychologist who rates the personal
touch in management above the quick fix
FORGET the ''quick-fix'' solutions peddled by the management gurus.
Forget their ''mythical'' statements. According to David Statt, Scots
managers have the common sense and resources to come up with their own
solutions -- they just need the confidence to trust their own judgment.
Statt's ''ground-up'' view of management stems from personal
experience. Born and raised in the Gorbals, he went to work at 17 as a
clerk in the personnel department of Glasgow Corporation Transport.
This early involvement with human relations shaped his career.
Night-school qualifications took him to Glasgow University, where he
graduated in psychology, and thereafter to the US, where he took a PhD
in organisationtal psychology at the University of Michigan.
Statt's spell there gave him with valuable insight into the American
style of management. Part of his training focused on the local car
industry in Detroit. He returned to the UK in 1978 via Quebec and New
York -- where he acted as a consultant to the UN -- and London.
He's now back in Scotland, not because it's where the work or money is
but because it's where he wants to be. And he's brought back his own
''healthy dose of Scots scepticism'' which he feels needs to be
encouraged in Scots managers.
''Most people think management is about manipulating people,'' he
says. ''It's not. And most of the things people believe to be true about
management aren't. For example, that the higher up you go in the
hierarchy the more stress you're under. You're actually under more
stress the lower down you are, because of lack of control.''
Statt applies psychology to the world of management, giving it what he
terms ''the cold shower treatment''.
''The gurus find examples of something wonderful, like bosses who
listen to people, but what they conveniently ignore is that the vast
majority of people don't work for shining examples.''
''Most people have to work for bosses who were never trained in
management, don't really know what it is, perhaps don't even want to be
managers and are just trying to hold on to their jobs too.
''So what do these managers do when they're under pressure from above?
They look for the 'quick fix', for the list of techniques they think
will achieve the desired results, rather than try to understand what
management is all about -- relationships with other people.''
Statt believes management is about relationships, and psychology can
teach us about relationships. This is the theme of his most recent book
Psychology and the World of Work, which forms the basis of a series of
six seminars, being run by UnivEd Technologies and TRC Ltd at Edinburgh
University over the next six weeks.
Statt describes the series as ''an exercise in debunking the
inspirational literature'', exploding what he has identified as the Top
15 Myths, including ''Team work is essential'', ''People will only work
harder for more money'' and ''New technology has radically altered the
workplace''.
For example, take the statement ''Leaders are born, but leaders are
also made''. Neither is the case. There are a number of factors at work.
The task to be performed and the people to be led have to combine with
the personality of the person in the leadership post. ''After all,''
says Statt, ''if the Second World War had never happened we wouldn't
have known that Churchill was a great leader.
''People are also fascinated by charisma, it's what they think of as
being leadership. But charistmatic leadership is neurotic leadership. He
(and it's almost always he) says, 'Give up your sense of responsibility
for your own behaviour to me, I'll take decisions for you'. It's what
charismatic political leaders do, some business leaders too. It's very
seductive, but it's an unhealthy regression to childhood.''
Statt wants to foster a healthy scepticism about management advice, to
encourage Scots managers to go back to first principles and ask
common-sense questions.
''Managers of the future are going to be thrown back on their personal
resources more.
''You have to be more self-reliant, get to the bedrock of people's
relationships with each other, which is hard because when you do,
there's nowhere to hide.''
And when you've stripped away people's illusions, what do you leave
them with? Statt makes no apologies. ''Their own resources. But then,
it's not something the Scots have ever been short of.''

Edinburgh until 5 April. For information contact: Hamish Macandrew,

From NARAYANAN MADHAVAN, New Delhi
IF EVER there was a backhanded compliment to Indian Prime Minister P V
Narasimha Rao's radical economic reform programme, it is that the
country's foremost communist party is now wooing private investment.
The Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM), which vehemently opposed
the reform programme started in mid-1991, still swears capitalism is
wicked.
But in West Bengal, the only state the party rules, the communists are
snuggling up to their class enemy.
West Bengal's ageing Chief Minister Jyoti Basu, now compared with
China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping for his pragmatic courting of
private capital, recently launched an industrial policy that offered tax
breaks, investment subsidies, and cheap industrial loans to private
investors.
''West Bengal today enjoys renewed investor confidence. A newer,
bolder, more mature spirit of enterprise is clearly visible,'' the
state's government-owned industrial development corporation says in an
advert.
Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, architect of India's economic reforms
that shed decades-old socialist controls on private investment, said the
policy signalled a national consensus on Rao's reforms.
''Just look at our friends in West Bengal,'' he said, as proof that
the reforms were irreversible.
Basu announced the new policy last September in the state's capital,
Calcutta, without discussing it with the party's decision-making central
committee or the all-powerful politburo, local news reports said.
Hardliners in the party do not like his pragmatism, but Basu is not
yielding.
Senior colleagues seem to agree with him. CPM is now finalising a new
approach to investment at the national level, widely expected to endorse
Basu.
''We cannot keep our eyes closed. Even Cuba is changing now. We are
not interested in committing suicide,'' the party's powerful General
Secretary, Harkrishen Singh Surjeet, told the magazine Sunday.
On the record, the party claims there is no change in its position.
''There has been no deviation in the policy approach,'' West Bengal's
industry minister, Bidyut Ganguly, was quoted as saying in a four-page
business feature in Delhi's Hindustan Times daily.
A surprise foreign entrant to Calcutta's investment market is George
Soros, one of the world's best known market players. His plans include
investing in a West Bengal petrochemical plant.
Since the communists came to power in the state nearly two decades
ago, Calcutta's few foreign investors have been film-makers producing
movies on the filth, the squalor, and the poverty of the city that is
home to Nobel laureate Mother Teresa.
The state is also gaining from Rao's new steel policy that has lifted
government-administered price controls. As a result, the eastern region
enjoys a special advantage, as it is two of India's top steel plants and
rich coal and mineral belts.
The Calcutta government may gain from cheaper steel which can lure
investors to set up their plants in the region.
''The centre's liberalisation of economic policy brought in its wake
decontrol of steel, removing in one stroke a major handicap for West
Bengal,'' a writer said in a business article.
The communists proudly display the fact that West Bengal's power
utilities are more efficient than most in India's woefully-inefficient
power sector. Several new projects are planned or under construction to
produce more power for private industry.
''West Bengal's turnaround in the power scenario is being widely
talked about,'' the state's power development corporation boasted in an
advert.
The communists say their new policy aims to strengthen industrial
infrastructure, but it is quite clear that they want private investment
by the billions.
There are no easy answers to whether West Bengal's pampered trade
unions, which shooed off investors, will fall in line with the
industrial glasnost. But the Basu government means business.
''There is no doubt that trade unions cannot survive if workers don't
survive, and workers cannot if industry doesn't survive,'' Jibon Roy a
leading trade unionist and CPM lawmaker told the Sunday magazine.
For Basu, said to be a connoisseur of Scotch whisky, who takes his
annual holiday in London, this is just a way of keeping proud Calcutta,
once the industrialised capital of British India, from falling off the
world map.

THE Angolan army commander pointed down a slope to a dark mass of
vegetation 300 yards away on the muddy outskirts of the northern city of
Uige.
''See those plants under the tall trees? That was all coffee,'' he
said. ''But we can't get to it.''
Uige once lay at the heart of an industry that made Angola the world's
fourth largest coffee producer. But 19 years of civil war between the
government and UNITA rebels cut production to a tiny fraction of its
former output.
Before independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola produced more than
200,000 tonnes of coffee annually. Latest official figures put that
closer to 1000 tonnes today.
Angola's robusta coffee, grown mainly by Portuguese landowners, was
regarded as second only to Brazil's because of its consistent quality.
''The land around Uige now is like a forest,'' said Vicky Matesso,
country director of Angola's National Coffee Institute.
''The farms are abandoned. The trees are all old, most of them more
than 30 years. They have not had attention since the wars started. There
is a lot of work to do.''
Matesso said that if a peace agreement signed last November worked,
Angolan coffee could be re-established.
''We want to rehabilitate 300,000 acres of the old land. I would like
to see 40,000 to 50,000 tonnes produced annually by Angola in three
years' time,'' he said.
But the ceasefire is fragile, and diplomats and ordinary Angolans are
pessimistic over the prospects for lasting peace.
Uige itself, a government-held town surrounded by UNITA troops, has
been described by UN peace monitors as a potential flashpoint.
''We are still not in a position to know what exactly has happened to
the coffee around Uige. Nobody from our side is able to cross the lines
yet,'' Matesso said.
''I know some was burned while UNITA was here, partly to make
charcoal, partly to make way for food crops.
''But I do not think more than 7 or 8% has been destroyed. The rest is
intact, and it will be reasonably easy to rehabilitate.''
The Marxist-Leninist MPLA government, which took over on independence
nationalised all the farms, and coffee production declined rapidly as
smallholders turned from cash to food crops.
People in Uige said that since 1975, a few traders had continued to
buy small amounts of coffee from peasant farmers in the area, taking it
north to Zaire for sale.
''We want to organise these rural markets so they are working again,''
Matesso said.

LASMO has reassured its supporters that they were right to turn down
the hostile #1600m bid from Enterprise Oil last summer as it emphasised
the positive developments on the horizon while reducing 1994 net losses
from #118m to #3m.
That was despite a fall in the average oil price from $17 to $15.81
per barrel thanks to a good performance on the costs side and a 6000
barrels per day increase in output of oil and gas to 173,000 bpd. The
costs of the bid defence amounted to #24m.
This higher output reflected increased production from some of the
smaller North Sea fields, offshore Nova Scotia and more gas shipped to
Japan from the Sanga Sanga gas operations in Indonesia.
Chief executive Joe Darby said that Lasmo is studying with its
partners the economics of building a eighth gas train at Bontang in
Indonesia in addition to the seventh now under contruction.
Altogether Indonesia accounts for 46% of the company's gas reserves --
it is in the fortunate position of being more gas rich than most and
where the price potential is much more positive than that for oil which
seems unlikely to move very far from around $17 a barrel.
It has spent heavily on exploration and is particularly excited about
discoveries in Algeria where both development and lifting costs
aggregate under $5 a barrel. Discoveries so far announced by the
Anadarko Petroleum operator are between 850 million and 1150 million
barrels of oil with there still being considerable upside for further
additions to reserves.
The current year should see the 20%-owned Liverpool Bay gas discovery
coming onstream -- under the previous management, 5% was sold by the
then cash-strapped company.
A 1.25p foreign income dividend is being paid.
The shares closed little changed at 153[1/2]p.

STAKIS chief executive David Michels said yesterday that the
resurrected hotels and casinos group would consider major acquisitions
if the opportunities arose.
At a packed annual general meeting in Renfrew, outgoing chairman Sir
Lewis Robertson received a rousing endorsement from shareholders, having
completely reversed the once-ailing company's fortunes during his
four-year term.
He is succeeded by former Clydesdale Bank chief executive and deputy
chairman Richard Cole-Hamilton.
Having more than doubled pre-tax profits to #20.2m in the year to
October 2, Stakis is now firmly on the acquisition trail, with a string
of purchases since the year-end. The buying focus is on hotels, purely
because of the availability of those offering the returns Stakis
demands.
Speaking after the meeting, Mr Michels said: ''If a larger opportunity
was to present itself, we would consider it.''
Whether purchases during the current financial year will be greater
than the #32m during the previous 12 months depends entirely on the
number of attractive opportunities.
Mr Michels said: ''We have a target of spending the money wisely. If
we can spend it more quickly, we will. If we can't, we won't.''
The group's most recent swoops include the #4.7m purchase of the
Westpoint Hotel, near East Kilbride, and the #1.5m acquisition of two
Bournemouth casinos. Stakis has 38 hotels and 23 casinos.
Sir Lewis said the new financial year had started well, with the
period to December seeing good trading. January was predictably quiet
but he was confident for the year as a whole.
He added that recovery in demand continued to be patchy but was
consolidating.
Mr Cole-Hamilton, who paid tribute to the ''marvellous'' job done by
his predecessor, said: ''Probably more important than anything else is
the confidence that the City and the Bank of England have always placed
in Sir Lewis.
''I believe a great deal of this confidence has rubbed off on to this
company. We will guard it well.''
Referring to his new role, which he compared to running a bank branch
network, Mr Cole-Hamilton said: ''It is really business as usual but
still moving forward.''
Shareholders unanimously agreed to increase the company's authorised
share capital from #50m to #66.5m through an additional 165 million 10p
shares.
Without this, the company would have had only 22 million unissued
shares, 13 million of which have already been earmarked for options,
executive options and savings-related option schemes.
Shareholders also renewed directors' power to make rights issues or
allot up to 5% of the issued share capital to investors not currently on
the register. Sir Lewis said a small issue of shares might be
appropriate if the group acquired a new unit.

BAD weather is again the problem this week but moves are afoot to help
Oban Camanachd's match against Skye in the Camanachd Cup go ahead, both
clubs having been put on standby to travel to a neutral venue if
Mossfield Park is unplayable.
The clubs' pitches will be inspected tomorrow, and if they fail the
test, then another venue, possibly Spean Bridge, will be brought into
play.
Inveraray's fourth-round tie with Fort William looks in grave doubt.
Glasgow Mid Argyll also were faced with pitch difficulties, but have
secured the use of Pirie Park, where they will meet Oban Celtic, also in
the fourth round.
The visitors will be without Colin Sloss, who is in hospital following
an accidental blow to the head from one of his own team-mates last
weekend. A win for Celtic would be just the tonic to get him back on his
feet.
Kingussie, meanwhile, should continue on their winning ways when they
face Lovat, who conceded eight goals to them in the Camanachd Cup last
weekend.
This time they meet in the MacTavish Cup at the Bught Park, Inverness.
Lovat's main problem is how to stop Ronald Ross, who is in good form
with 18 goals in his last four outings. He is close to establishing a
new Kingussie goals record in a season as the league champions set about
achieving another clean sweep.
The north second division clubs take a break from league action with
first-round ties in the Valerie Fraser Cup. The pick of the matches is
the one between Lochcarron and Kilmallie at the Battery Park.
The MacTavish Juvenile Cup also gets under way with three ties.

LYNN Harding, the Scottish Commonwealth Games marathon runner, will
defend her Inter-county 20-mile title this weekend at Luton -- but not
in West of Scotland's colours.
And the girls who won the team event for West last year will also be
absent, the first victims of the financial crisis that has struck the
Scottish Athletics Federation.
Harding, from Milngavie, but who works in Sunderland and runs for
Houghton, led West to victory last year at Corby. The event has been
switched to Luton, but funds do not permit West to send a team.
The SAF West District offered to fund accountant Harding on her own,
but not the whole team.
''Since it is a team event, that would be a bit pointless,'' Harding
said yesterday.
''I would happily have paid my own way, but since my residence makes
me eligible to run for North-east Counties, I have agreed to run for
them.''
* THE Scottish junior teams (under-20, under-18) which meet France and
Belgium this weekend at the Kelvin Hall in the first indoor multi-events
athletics international between the countries, face formidable
opposition.
The French team, though only a regional one, from Savoy, boasts three
pole vaulters capable of more than 4.00 metres -- a height that only one
Scottish senior cleared at the national championships in January.
Indeed, one of the French, Arnaud Verguet, 17, has topped 4.80m, which
is better than the Scottish senior native record in the event. .
The Scottish teams will be led by Aberdeen's Mark Dobbie and Richard
Singer, from Banchory, respectively national under-20 and under-17
champions. Teams:
Men's heptathlon. Under-20: M Dobbie (Aberdeen), D Cuthill
(Kilbarchan), K Oag (Elgin), D Graham (Arbroath). Under-18: R Singer
(Banchory), C Low, P Herron (both Arbroath), P Stephen (Cumbernauld).
Women's pentathlon. Under-20 F McWhinnie (Basingstoke), A Carr (Stoke),
K Toger (Inverness), E Gray (Victoria Park). Under-18: L Whigham
(Kirkintilloch), G Stewart, L Gauld (both Edinburgh AC), F Hunter
(Arbroath).
* THE German sports federation is investigating allegations of drug
abuse by track and field athletes.

DORILEEN FORBES was Heriot Watt's heroine at Cramond yesterday,
booking their place in the semi-finals of the British Universities
championship by scoring the winner in a 4-3 home defeat of John Moore's
from Liverpool.
Heriot Watt, the defending champions, twice surrendered the lead by
''gifting'' goals.
However, they levelled through strikes by Gillian Soutar and Val Neil,
90 seconds from the end of normal time, then Vickie Walker shot them
ahead in the 14th minute of extra time.
Internationalist Susan Gilmour was sent off for talking back to the
umpire, and as the team tried to readjust, Brown equalised.
However, Heriot's forced a corner in the dying minutes for Forbes to
net.

EUAN Stewart heads off to Lanzarote next week, but the fortnight in
the sun will be anything but a holiday for the Scottish swimming
internationalist.
''It will be two weeks of very hard work to get me fit for the
European championship trials next month,'' said the 25 year-old, who
made an impressive start to the long-course season with victory in the
100 metres butterfly at last weekend's British Grand Prix Meet in Leeds.
England's James Hickman is his main rival for the butterfly place, and
Stewart reckons he may need to break Neil Cochran's eight-year-old
Scottish record of 54.30sec to make the side.
''I'll be looking to hit 54,'' he said. ''I managed 55.3 at the same
time in Leeds last year, but the Sheffield pool is much warmer and
faster.''
Stewart is one of a 17-strong squad heading for Lanzarote. The camp is
part of the preparation for the Multi-Nations Tournament to be held at
Edinburgh's Commonwealth Pool on April 15 and 16.

THE UK television industry's strong resurgence in advertising revenue
was highlighted yesterday by HTV which enjoyed a 6.5% rise in income
last year to #91.2m.
The rise in advertising income was achieved as the Cardiff-based
broadcaster maintained market share of national ITV advertising income
at 6.1%.
Chairman Louis Sherwood said strong advertising income during the
first half was not sustained during the second six months of the
financial year.
''This was the result of the widely-publicised disruption suffered by
most ITV companies changing sales houses and the weakening of the
underlying ITV markets in the second half of the year, said Mr Sherwood.
''The difficulties of the transition are behind us and with the
highly-experienced support of our new sales house, TSMS, we can now look
forward with confidence to 1995.''
He added: ''In 1995 we expect to see further real growth from
advertising revenue with costs firmly under control.''
The group more than doubled taxable profits to #7.3m from #3.3m.
Shareholders will see their payout jump by 1.25p to 2.25p on earnings
per share 50% higher to 7.2p from 4.8p.
Its improving fortunes has boosted substantially its cash position.
The broadcaster now has #5.1m in the bank compared with borrowings in
1993 of #18.9m.
During the year HTV rapidly expanded its interests by providing local
programming for Avon Cable (Telewest) as well as facilities and
management services for Wire TV.
It also has a contract to provide live programming and teletext
services to Windsor cable (General Cable) and has started to make
programmes for a number of national cable and satellite services
including The Learning Channel, UK Living, The Children's Channel, The

WOOLWICH Building Society yesterday hinted that it may give up its
mutually-owned status as it announced a rise in annual pre-tax profits
to #303m.
''Although we believe that at present there are many advantages in
retaining mutual status, we will be keeping the position under regular
review,'' said Donald Kirkham, chief executive of the Woolwich, the UK's
third-largest building society.
''No steps involving change of status or merger will be proposed or
taken without careful planning and regard to the best interests of our
members,'' he added.
The profits advance last year from #229m in 1993 was achieved thanks
to a plunge in loan loss provisions from #123m to #56m.
Mortgage lending totalled #3300m last year, up from #3000m, and net
receipts from investors -- including interest added to their accounts --
edged up to #1200m from #1100m.
Mr Kirkham said the group's fixed rate bond, in particular, had proved
very popular. He also emphasised the growing importance of subsidiary
businesses such as unit trust, life assurance and Continental home loans
which were helping to offset the recession in the core UK markets.
Tax changes and higher interest rates were likely to restrain both the
housing and savings markets in 1995, said Mr Kirkham. However, he
predicted a 2% rise in house prices during the year and a 5% increase in
the number of home sales.

RETAIL business in the Ayr town centre will receive a major boost from
the completion of the M77 link, according to local shopkeepers.
''Two hundred years ago Ayr was on its knees -- then the town was
linked to Glasgow by the railway network and its fortunes were
transformed. The M77 will bring even more business to a town centre
which is thriving,'' said Brian Smart, chairman of the town's retail
association.
Ayr's retail property sector was an early victim of the recent
recession, but major investments by public and private sectors in
upgrading the town centre have brought back the crowds. Improvements
include a pedestrianisation scheme, the cleaning of town centre facades,
car parking improvements, the redevelopment of the Fish Cross, and the
refurbishment and upgrading of shopping facilities.
Meanwhile, Safeway is expanding into much larger premises on the
former cattle market site close to the town centre.
The rapid increase in retail business has created a 'queue' of major
retailers who are seeking properties in the town, Mr Smart said.
Donald Stewart, the largest local commercial property agent, said
several off-market property transactions show that the town is
attractive both to investors and to retailers.
''Although Ayr was hit hard in the early 1990s, the retail sector is
now vibrant and there is a growing demand for space in the town. The M77
will make Ayr even more accessible and we can expect even stronger
demand from retailers,'' he said.
Meanwhile, town centre improvements are continuing, said Mr Stewart.
''The Principles store is undergoing a re-fit, the former Millar's
ironmonger store is being redeveloped to create four new shop units and
a creche, and there is a planning application to upgrade a rather tacky
looking amusement arcade.''

LIKE vultures attracted to a carcase, potential buyers of Barings'
operations were busy talking yesterday to Ernst &amp; Young, administrators
to the crashed merchant bank as the need for quick deals became rapidly
apparent.
There were growing fears that key employees would be quickly snapped
up, reducing the value of the corporate finance and securities
businesses, while the fund management side would see a haemorrhage of
investors, reducing the funds under management and upsetting Far Eastern
markets, where Barings was something of an expert.
Last night ABN Amro, the largest Dutch bank, emerged as favourite to
clinch the corporate finance arm and the asset management company with a
bid of #300m.
The highly-regarded fund management business is thought to have
attracted interest from 10 possible purchasers, with Merrill Lynch said
to have put the highest bid on the table so far.
Other players thought to be eyeing parts include National Westminster
Bank which has said before that it wants to build up its asset
management and advisory services and HSBC.
Possible foreign bidders include German commercial bank Dresdner which
would like to expand its London investment banking operations; ING,
another Dutch group, keen to expand its capital markets activities and
which has plenty of resources to spend; and Munich-based Bayerische
Vereinsbank.
Meanwhile pension funds and others with money on deposit with Barings
were busy adding up their exposure to the crash, though these are low
relative to total assets. Funds actually under management are not
considered to be in any danger because they were ring-fenced from the
rest of the group but only the small proportion of cash on deposit
pending investment is at risk. Any individuals will be covered by the
depositors' protection fund.
Investment trusts in the Barings stable are also vulnerable and
Tribune said it had exposure of #8.5m, representing 4.7% of its assets.
The trust has decided to pay its final dividend of 5.05p as usual.
Final details of the Bank of England's inquiry into the disaster were
being completed yesterday. The nine-member Board of Banking Supervision,
which is to carry out the investigation, will meet shortly.
A Bank of England spokesman explained they would be following three
main lines of inquiry -- what actually happened in Singapore where the
fatal futures positions were built up; the way in which Barings'
Singapore subsidiaries were managed from London; and the role played by
the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, where the positions were
taken out.
The three top Bank officials, Governor Eddie George, his deputy Rupert
Pennant-Rea and executive director Brian Quinn, will serve on the board
but they are outnumbered by six independent members who include Jon
Foulds, chairman of the Halifax Building Society. If they are in
disagreement with the Bank officials they can go straight to the
Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Nick Leeson, the man behind the disaster, remained elusive. Rumoured
sightings of him and his wife Lisa in the Far East multiplied, while it
also emerged that Lisa Neeson worked in the back office of Barings'
Singapore operation which is concerned with the book-keeping related to
deals carried out during the day.

LONGNIDDRY'S Hilary Monaghan, one of only two uncapped players in the
nine-strong squad, headed the Scottish challenge on 74, two strokes
behind Italian leader Maria Cassati after yesterday's opening qualifying
round of the Spanish Women's Amateur championship at Las Brisas.
In ideal conditions, although scoring was affected by the
lightning-fast greens, the 19-year-old's two-over-par score left her
well placed to qualify for tomorrow's matchplay stage.
Stirling's Alison Rose, who will make her British team debut in South
Africa next month, was also well placed on 76, with Lindsey Roxburgh
(Tain) a further shot behind. Other Scottish scores:
79 -- L Nicholson (Haddington), F McKay (Turnberry), S McMaster
(Dunbar). 80 -- V Melvin (Stirling University), J Ford (Gullane). 90 --
C Agnew (Eastwood).
* ENGLAND'S Laura Davies holds a lead of almost 110 points over
nearest rival Beth Daniel of the United States on the latest Ping
Leaderboard, the women's world rankings table. Leading positions:
1, L Davies (England) 328.15 points; 2, B Daniel (USA) 218.18; 3, L
Neumann (Sweden) 216.65; 4, B King (USA) 186.30; 5, D Andrews (USA)

Fairclough (England) 44.50; 71, A Nicholas (England) 37.32; 77, H
Wadsworth (Wales) 33.50; 82, D Reid (Scotland) 30.65; 88, S Strudwick
(England) 28.25; 95, L Hackney (England) 25.75.
* SCOT Peter Downie, former assistant professional at Gullane, could
afford the luxury of running up two triple-bogey 7s at the final two
holes before winning the PGA of Europe World Dubai Pro-Am yesterday.
Downie, now director of golf at the Dubai Creek club, was leading the
72-hole event by nine strokes before hitting three balls into water for
a closing 81. His aggregate of 292 was still three shots better than
second-placed Nick Allen of Shirley Park.
Downie left Gullane in 1984 and worked in administrative golf roles in
Florida and with the Hyatt Regency Corporation at the Jack Nicklaus
Resort in Grand Cayman Island before moving to Dubai in 1992.

A BATTLING two-over-par 74 from Cowglen's Les McLaughlin helped
Scotland's C team into second spot in the Nations Cup tournament at the
Club de Campo in Malaga yesterday. McLaughlin's 74 was added to Barclay
Howard's 76 -- with David Downie's 84 discarded -- to give the Scots a
team total of 150, two behind leaders Sweden.
The southern Spanish venue has not seen rain for more than two years,
and with wind gusting up to 30mph yesterday, control of the ball into
hard greens was a problem.
Scotland's two other trios also found the going tough with only Craig
Watson in the A team managing to break 80. His 78 added to Simon
Mackenzie's 82 gave a team total of 160. From the B team, Craig Hislop's
80 was best, and added to Ronnie Clark's 82, gave a total of 162.
All teams play the second and final round today and at the conclusion,
the top 32 individual players will progress to compete for the Spanish
Amateur championship title. Leading scores:
148 -- Sweden.
150 -- Scotland C (L McLaughlin 74, B Howard 76, D Downie 84 - did not
count).
Other scores: 160 -- Scotland A (C Watson 78, S Mackenzie 82, B
Collier 89 - did not count). 162 -- Scotland B (C Hislop 80, R Clark 82,
M Brooks 84 - did not count).
* GORDON Sherry is almost certain to qualify for the final matchplay
stages of the Argentinian Amateur championship at the Jockey Club,
Buenos Aires, after shooting a two-under-par 70 in yesterday's first
round. He is in joint second place, two strokes off the early lead.
Ireland's Padraig Harrington shot a 71.
* THE winner of this season's Scottish Assistants' Golf Championship
at Newmachar in July will have an extra prize to slip into his bag
alongside the cheque -- a ticket to the Ryder Cup in America.
The trip to Oak Hill Country Club in September has been organised by
sponsors Titleist and Foot-Joy, and it also is available to the
assistants' winners in the Midlands, East, North, South, and West
regions, plus Ireland.

From supplying raw materials for war efforts to providing vasts tracts
of leisure space, the Forestry Commission has grown and evolved into one
of our most popular indigenous industries, as Harry Conroy discovered
IT took the First World War to draw attention to the fact that
Britain's forests had largely disappeared.
Simply keeping the home fires burning, and the industrial revolution,
had denuded Great Britain of much of its source of timber. In Scotland
the ancient Caledonian Forest had all but disappeared.
The Russian Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 further added to our concerns
as by 1913 half of our timber imports came from Russia.
During the First World War the country had difficulties finding enough
timber supplies to meet the demand for pit props and for shoring up our
trenches on the battlefields.
With the war still in progress the Government established the Acland
Committee to locate future supplies of timber. The committee recommended
that the country could not secure enough timber unless the Government
intervened.
In response Lloyd George set up the Forestry Commission in 1919
despite opposition from the Treasury on grounds of cost.
The Treasury's opposition proves that at least one Government
department is consistant as only last year the Treasury was leading the
fight to have the Forestry Commission privatised, a battle which
thankfully it again lost.
Lord Lovat, was the Forestry Commission's first chairman, which had
its headquarters first in Grosvenor Gardens, then 9 Savile Row, London!
The committee's remit from the Government was to establish a strategic
reserve of timber and a target was set of 1.77 million acres of conifers
to be planted by the end of the century.
The Second World War however intervened causing huge areas to be
felled and, during the war years, employment in the industry swelled
from 14,000 throughout the UK to more than 44,000 including several
thousand members of the Women's Timber Corp who were christened the
''lumberjills''.
Despite the increased felling during the 1939-45 years the commission
has already surpassed its 1.77 million target. A large proportion of the
planting has been in Scotland, which explains why the commission's
headquarters are now in Edinburgh.
Doctor Alan Low is the Forestry Commission's chief conservator in
Scotland, and as such is in charge of the Forestry Authority north of
the border.It is responsible for implementing Government policy in this
area and overseeing the Forest Enterprise, which, in turn, is
responsible for the management of the national forests.
Establishing a strategic reserve in the event of war is no longer a
key objective of the commission says Dr Low, as most people recognise
that any future major war would likely to be short and sharp.
Today the commission's aim is to creat multi-purpose forests which not
only provide timber but also can be used for recreational purposes,
improve the landscape and also provide a habitat for wild life.
Important as the new emphasis on environmental and leisure aspects may
be, they should not be allowed to diminish the economic impact the
Forestry Commission has had in rural areas.
Employment in the forestry and wood processing industries in Scotland
now amounts to almost 17,000 jobs with around 3000 in the commission
alone, and close to a further 4,000 on private estates.
The existence of a ready source of timber has attracted the wood
processing industry including 65 sawmills.
In 1987 the Kymmene Corporation of Finland decided to build an
integrated pulp and paper mill at Irvine designed to produce 200,000
tonnes of lightweight coated paper each year.
The #215m cost of the Caledonian Paper plant was, at that time, the
largest single inward investment ever made in Scotland. It produces
193,000 tonnes of paper for use in glossy magazines and brochures with a
17.5% of the market share.
Earlier in 1983, Caberboard started production of particleboard also
in Irvine and has a 70% UK market share for medium density fibreboard
used in the furniture and general construction industry.
Norbord Highland is also an important player in the wood processing
industry.
Indeed, the Forestry Commission can claim to be a success story having
been instrumental in creating an indigenous industry which now supplies
25% of Britain's timber requirements and provides much needed employment
in remote areas throughout Scotland as well as other parts of the UK.
However, the commission has been criticised for ruining the landscape
of many of Scotland's scenic areas with uniform rows of conifers.
Dr Low says: ''There has been a tendancy to exaggerate the uniformity
of post-war planting. There is more diversity than we have been credited
with.''
The Government, however, did take note of the public disquiet about
the uniform landscape being created in large tracts of the Scottish
Highlands and Uplands, and in 1988 the taxation reign was altered to
encourage private landowners who play an important role in the industry
to plant more diversified species in future.
This change, says Dr Low, ''did lead to a substantial increase in the
planting of broadleave trees''.
The Forestry Commission, when it is replanting areas it has felled,
also now uses a greater diversity of species.
To support Dr Low's view that the uniformity argument was overstated,
the commission can point to the support given by them to our tourist
industry and the fact that there are more than 50 million day visits to
Britain's forests.
In Scotland there are nine camping and caravan sites, 188 picnic
places, an amazing 319 forests walks and nature trails, and 10 visitor
centres.
The commission also has 67 forest cabins and holiday houses, all of
which play a part in attracting tourists to Scotland.
Certainly, when there was talk of the Forestry Commission being
privatised all criticism of their planting policy was quickly forgotten
and environmental organisations joined to sing the praises of the work
carried out by the commission, and the free access it gave the public to
the land it owned.
Perhaps an example of better the devil you know?

THREE of the four quarter-final matches in the European Champions' Cup
ended in draws last night, with the supporters of champions AC Milan the
only ones to go home happy.
Two second-half goals from Marco Simone in the San Siro gave Milan
their 2-0 success against Portugual's Benfica. The striker broke through
Benfica's tight defence after 63 minutes, reacting quickly to pounce on
a Marcel Desailly header and turn the ball past Belgium's World Cup
keeper Michel Preud'homme.
Simone claimed his second -- and fourth in this season's European Cup
-- in 75 minutes, superbly controlling a cross from Christian Panucci
before rounding Preud'homme.
Two goals down, Benfica gave up their defensive tactics, and eight
minutes from time, Claudio Caniggia had the ball in the Milan net but a
goal was disallowed.
The result leaves the Italians, who are chasing their third successive
European Cup semi-final place, with a big advantage.
In the Nou Camp, George Weah's seventh goal in Europe this season
spared keeper Bernard Lama's blushes as Paris St Germain fought back to
draw 1-1 away to Barcelona.
Lama gifted the home side the lead after 48 minutes when he turned a
harmless cross from Igor Korneyev into his own net. But six minutes
later Weah, a constant threat to the Barcelona defence, headed home a
Candido Valdo free-kick after having been pulled down on the edge of the
box.
Ajax Amsterdam, the Dutch champions, were thought of as odds-on
favourites to see off Hajduk Split in Croatia, but in the end they had
to settle for a 0-0 draw.
Ajax dominated the game but seldom broke through the close-marking
Croatian defenders, and with both keepers rarely tested, this match was
far from a classic.
The visitors managed just two shots on target, with teenage striker
Patrick Kluivert blowing the first after 12 minutes when he shot from
almost point-blank range straight at Hajduk keeper Gabric. Then three
minutes later, Finnish internationalist Jari Litmanen's close-range
drive was held by the diving Gabric.
In Munich, injury-hit Bayern's hopes of reaching the semi-final stage
suffered a setback when they, too, were held to a goalless draw, this
time by Gothenburg.
The Germans had a number of good chances but were largely frustrated
by a well-organised defence and keeping Thomas Ravelli.
Bayern, deprived of influential captain Lothar Matthaeus and French
striker Jean-Pierre Papin because of injury, face an uphill battle in
the second leg.

SMALL investors are to get a bigger slice of the Government's #4000m
National Power and PowerGen share sale than originally planned after a
rush of applications.
The so-called public offer for smaller investors closed at mid-day
yesterday about 1.7 times subscribed, according to latest calculations,
with an average application for about #3000 worth of shares on a fully
paid basis.
Smaller investors were to get ''not less than'' 40% of the offer, but
the Treasury now expects to increase their slice beyond 40% following
the flood of applications.
Details will be announced later, advisers to the offer said.
A big rush in demand for the shares is also expected from City
professionals and institutions worldwide whose side of the offer closes
tomorrow.
The advisers said that latest estimates from share shops appointed to
handle the sale indicated that about 900,000 applications had been
received.
About 3.2 million private investors had registered their interest in
buying shares at share shops.
The offer to private investors involves an intial minimum outlay of
#352.
Individuals who successfully applied for shares through a share shop
will be entitled to incentives such as bonus shares and will receive
preference in allocation over other members of the public.
Private investors who were not registered and applied for shares on
public application forms will not be eligible for incentives or any
preference in allocation.

Florida
COLIN Montgomerie, at the start of four straight weeks of golf in
sunny Florida, was in as good a mood as any man might be, similarly
situated.
After two days of practice at the Doral Golf Resort and Spa,
Montgomerie said: ''It's great to be here. I think this is the best way
to get ready for the US Masters, acclimatise myself fully for four
weeks, rather than just show up at Augusta as a one or two-week thing. I
get to play good golf courses, with good practice facilities, the
weather is better than in Europe, and there is strong competition. You
can only get better when you play against strong competition.
''I'm actually very happy with what I'm doing right now. But if I
don't play well, I have a good week to play next week in Fort
Lauderdale, and if I don't play well then, good weeks coming up at Bay
Hill and the Players' Championship.
''Obviously, I'd like to win any week I play, love to win in America,
but if I can keep improving every week leading up to Augusta, and play
well, even without winning, I'll be satisfied. There's no pressure on me
here. There are certain expectations on me in Europe that don't exist
over here, which makes it nice and relaxing.''
Although he plans to work hard to improve his record at Augusta, the
real goal for Montgomerie this year is the US Open. ''That would be the
ideal for me. I've come close twice, and no European has won in 25
years. To win the US Open would be the most gratifying thing I could do
this year, even with the Open Championship being at St Andrews.''
Montgomerie is one of several international players plumping up the
importance of the Doral Open this week. Severiano Ballesteros is also
here, as well as Nick Faldo, Bernhard Langer, Greg Norman, and Ernie
Els.
There are a few notable absences, however. Nick Price declined to play
for the first time in many years, preferring to take a week off between
playing last week in South Africa and defending his Honda Classic title
next week, and Fred Couples, a last-minute withdrawal.
Couples injured his back here at Doral last year while warming up on
the range for the final round of play, which he would have entered in
seventh place. That injury kept Couples off the Tour for three months,
and prevented him from entering both the US Masters and Open
Championship.
He aggravated the injury last week in Los Angeles, and decided to
withdraw yesterday as a precautionary measure, saying: ''My back is a
little sore, but it's nothing as serious as last year.''
* JOSE Maria Olazabal, who played his last tournament in Japan three
months ago, begins his competitive comeback at the Andalucia Open in
Huelva, Spain, today -- just four weeks after having foot surgery.
Olazabal has had the bone in the big toe of his right foot shortened,
but although he admits to ''a little pain'' when pressing down on his
foot it has not affected his swing.
The 29-year-old Spaniard, who began practising last week, is not happy
with his game however. Always a perfectionist, he said: ''I've recovered
from the operation pretty quickly, but I'm not hitting the ball the same
as before.
''There was a doubt about me playing here this week but I wanted to
compete as soon as possible because I shall only have four tournaments
before the US Masters.''
Olazabal won his first major championship at the Masters in Augusta
last year and is anxious to regain top form before he starts his
defence.
He invariably takes a two-month break during the November to January
period but his foot problem, which first affected him last year, has
forced him to wait longer before returning to tournament golf.
''I played only two events in America before winning the Masters last
year, so three events in the States should be enough,'' he said.
Olazabal, who shot a one-over-par 72 in yesterday's pro-am
curtain-raiser, is naturally keen to win the US Masters again but says
that he never sets specific targets.
''My aim is to hit the ball as well as I can. I do not think you have
to say you must win this tournament or that tournament. If you
consistently strike the ball well the rewards will come,'' he said.
''I played well with one bad foot last year. Maybe I will do better
with two good feet. We shall have to wait and see.''
Olazabal is the class player in the Andalucia field, but there is no
lack of opposition with five of his 1993 Ryder Cup colleagues -- Sam
Torrance, Barry Lane, Peter Baker, Sweden's Joakim Haeggman, and Italian
Costantino Rocca -- among his rivals.
Also competing are 13 former Ryder Cup players and three men -- Jarmo
Sandelin and Robert Karlsson of Sweden and Spaniard Santiago Luna -- who
have won European Tour events already this year.
A total of 11 Scots are entered -- Sam Torrance who was joint second
in Valencia last week, Sandy Lyle, who will be anxious to improve on his
joint forty-fourth finish, Bernard Gallacher, Gary Orr, Andrew Coltart,
Adam Hunter, Paul Lawrie, Ross Drummond, Stephen McAllister, Craig
Ronald, and Dean Robertson.

WHEN ABTEX Computer Systems decided to launch an assault on Central
Scotland, it chose the somewhat unlikely corporate location of
Easterhouse.
However, as it celebrates its first birthday in Summerlee Street, the
information technology specialist views it as an ideal base from which
to boost its market share in the central belt.
ABTEX, which raised turnover from #22m to #25m in the year to
December, supplies desktop computer products and services to such
companies as oil giants Shell, Texaco, and BP. British Telecom, Scottish
Nuclear, the Scottish Office, and GEC Ferranti are also customers.
It has particular expertise in guiding customers along the sometimes
baffling information superhighway, with its approach emphasising the
importance of networking, or linking up, hardware.
In a survey of the top 100 fastest growing companies during 1994,
conducted by accountants Price Waterhouse, ABTEX came fourth in Scotland
and 38th in the UK. In spite of the recession, it achieved 55% growth in
sales terms between 1989 and 1993.
Although ABTEX reckons it commands between 20% and 25% of the market
in the Aberdeen area, it is looking to increase its share of less than
5% in Central Scotland. It believes the retrenchment of national
companies down south has left a vacuum in the marketplace.
In 1992, it expanded by acquiring AppleCentres in Aberdeen and
Glasgow, and re-seller Calibre Microsystems in Edinburgh, boosting
annual turnover by about #7m. However, the purchases caused travel
headaches for joint managing director Jim O'Hagan and created a need to
consolidate operations.
He said: ''From a location point of view, Easterhouse was ideal. It is
right beside the M8. We can be in the centre of Edinburgh in 40 minutes
and be in the centre of Glasgow in 20 minutes.''
About 30 of ABTEX's 145 employees work in the 9000 sq ft Easterhouse
sales and logistics centre, which may increase in size by half as it
becomes the company's sole bulk storage facility.
With ABTEX practising what it preaches as far as networking is
concerned, the Easterhouse premises have become something of a working
showcase, providing a ''comfort factor'' for customers who may find
high-tech purchases daunting.
Mr O'Hagan, who founded the company with fellow joint managing
director Jim Duncan in Aberdeen in 1979, said: ''We do a lot of
presentations to corporate clients. Virtually everyone we have brought
in here has gone away saying they were going to do business with
ABTEX.''
He believes that, with the market still expanding, the growth
potential of ABTEX is enormous.
Mr O'Hagan said: ''I think it'll get to saturation point where every
single person has a PC on their desk. However, these computers can't
work on their own and the growth is going to come in networking.
''I can seen that in our own business. I don't play telephone-tag all
day long. Instead of sending something to someone in the post, I can
send it to them and it will be there in five minutes.
''The information flow is much more rapid and you can collate
information from a variety of sources much more quickly.''

SCOTLAND was once home to the world's entrepreneurs. Our enterprising
spirit forged pathways into future horizons and took our inventions all
round the world. John Logie Baird, Andrew Carnegie, Alexander Fleming,
James Watt, Alan Pinkerton, Alexander Graham Bell -- need I go on? We
can take pride in that heritage.
So what happened? Look around now. Where have all our entrepreneurs
gone? Where are the thriving industries built on the back of our
inventions and initiatives? Once it was our inventions that spread
across the globe, now it is our inventors who leave our shores. Many of
them become frustrated with the lack of encouragement in this country
and decide to take themselves and their ideas to another location.
More than one quarter of all scientists in the UK were educated at
Scottish universities, yet most of them will pursue their careers
outside Scotland or even outside Britain. We have the resources and the
people to become a major innovative player in world-wide markets, so why
do we lose so many of our enterprising pioneers?
It has already been established that we have an attitude problem in
Scotland; we have almost become an anti-entrepreneurial culture and
unless we do something about it Scotland's economy will suffer and our
dole queues grow longer.
I know a lot of people who run very successful businesses yet many are
treated as second class citizens because they don't have a ''proper''
job. In one recent survey, Scottish people rated entrepreneurs below
plumbers and bus drivers in a list of admired professions!
What does that tell us? I believe it tells us that the entrepreneur is
not understood. It is the entrepreneur who is the provider of jobs. It
is they who are the wealth creators and Scotland's future depends on
them. I am always extremely disheartened when I hear of someone who has
worked hard to develop a viable business idea and then given it all up
because they were offered a ''real'' job. The big companies, by and
large, will not be the providers of the extra jobs we need. Is there any
large company in Scotland that has not ''downsized'' during the past 10
years?
Scotland's professional advisors must accept some of the blame.
Accountants, bankers and lawyers need to become more
entrepreneur-friendly instead of frightening off prospective
entrepreneurs at their first approach for help.
I spent a number of years in Ottawa where I built a company, floated
it on the Toronto Stock Exchange and then formed another successful
business in venture capital. Everywhere I looked, people were
prospering. Over the years I witnessed an entire geographical area being
transformed from one that was dominated by large corporations into an
economy that was buzzing with small start-ups.
When I came to Scotland I wanted to re-create that Ottawa phenomenon;
I wanted Scotland to have that same bustling excitement, the thrill of
self-discovery and the support mechanisms to make it all happen.
I am encouraged by the effort that is now being put behind the
Scottish Enterprise awareness-raising campaigns and the practical steps
that are being taken to support our budding entrepreneurs. At
Dunbartonshire Enterprise, for example, we are now operating our First
Steps Initiative and through it, in collaboration with other LECs, we
hope to re-light Scotland's entrepreneurial fervour with the ultimate
objective of increasing Scotland's business birth rate to at least match
that of the rest of the UK.
But a lot more needs to be done and by all sectors of the business
community. We have to change those attitudes. Through powerful media
campaigns we have managed to persuade people that drinking and driving
is socially unacceptable. Can we now manage to convince ourselves, and
others, that being an entrepreneur is socially acceptable and, perhaps,
even admirable?
I hope the answer is yes. Scotland needs her entrepreneurs in order to
thrive and flourish into the next millennium. As an economy, we need to
embrace good business ideas and as a society we must encourage and
support our entrepreneurs today -- they are our business leaders of
tomorrow.
David Pearson, director of Enterprise Development at Dunbartonshire
Enterprise, was talking to Yvonne Wightman.

HAMMY McMillan's Stranraer team got off to a winning start in the
Macallan Scottish Curling Championships at Perth last night with a 4-3
victory over Warwick Smith of Perth.
After four ends, Smith had a 2-1 lead, thanks to a steal of a single
at the fourth, but the turning point came in the fifth end, when
McMillan nudged out Smith's stone to score 2 for a 3-2 lead. McMillan
followed this with a steal of one at the sixth end, when Smith's
attempted promote slipped past McMillan's counter.
Smith managed to hit back in the seventh end with a single to reduce
McMillan's lead to 4-3, but in the eighth end McMillan, with his last
stone still to play, lay three and Smith conceded the game.
On the next rink, Gordon Muirhead of Livingston had a straightforward
draw into an empty house with his last stone to seal victory in the
tenth end, but came up substantially short and had to play an extra end
against Struan MacNee of Murrayfield.
In the play-off, MacNee managed to hide one of his stones in the
four-foot ring behind a string of front guards and the Muirhead team
were forced time and again to try to break through this defensive wall.
With his last stone, Muirhead finally slipped past the guards -- but his
stone rolled on beyond the MacNee counter to lose out by millimetres and
a game score of 6-5.
Also starting off their campaigns with victories were Robin Gray, Drew
Tasker, and Philip Wilson. Results:
First round -- McMillan (Stranraer) 4, Smith (Perth) 3; Muirhead
(Livingston) 5, MacNee (Murrayfield) 6; Gray (Forest Hills) 6, Adam
(East Kilbride) 3; Tasker (Letham Grange) 4, Kenny (Kinross) 3; Wilson
(Greenacres) 5, Prentice (Lockerbie) 4.

IT is, as Paul McStay said yesterday, all about standards and a fierce
determination not only to set them but to maintain them, something the
Celtic captain himself has found extremely difficult in recent times.
Celtic supporters look to McStay more than any other player to provide
something different, to give his team a touch of genuine class, and
after years of shouldering that burden a toll has been taken.
His recent form was not good enough to satisfy the manager, Tommy
Burns, and McStay was dropped, but an encouraging performance against
Real Madrid in Malaga on Tuesday night has moved the midfield player
back up the order.
The likelihood is that he will play against Aberdeen at Hampden Park
on Sunday.
''I though Paul played reasonably well and that he looked busy
again,'' said Burns. ''He is right back in my thoughts for Sunday.''
Both Burns and McStay were extremely impressed by the quality of Real
Madrid's play, and both agreed that the match was worthwhile, even
though the Spaniards, in making it look so simple, also highlighted
Celtic's mediocrity.
''But we saw a team that lives entirely by its own standards, and
while we are a long way off that kind of football, this is the direction
in which we have to move,'' said McStay.
''I believe Scottish football has to hold up its hands and say that we
are not doing it properly, and if the younger players in the Celtic side
are willing to learn from what they came up against the other night,
then they and the club will benefit.''
McStay was especially grateful for the match, because it gave him an
opportunity to prove to the manager that his fitness level remains high
and that his appetite has not been diminished, even though he had
managed only one game in seven weeks prior to Tuesday night.
Suspensions and loss of form have kept him idle, and he admitted it
has been difficult watching his team-mates perform without him.
However, his enforced break gave him the opportunity to look at the
team from afar and identify one or two problems which he will hope to
rectify on Sunday -- or whenever Burns invites him back into the fray.
''It isn't nice on the sidelines, but my confidence is still good and
I suppose in a sense it is a compliment when people continue to expect
so much of you, although I have to say I didn't feel my form was too
bad.
''Perhaps, though, I haven't maintained the standards I set in 1992,
when I thought my form was especially good, but it is up to me to ensure
that I play at that level consistently.''
McStay admitted that the unfortunate events of the Coca-Cola Cup
final, when he missed in a penalty shoot-out against Raith Rovers,
pushed him to the forefront for the wrong reasons.
But he also feels he recovered quickly from that setback, although
many would say that's where his troubles of this season began.
Meanwhile, manager Burns will continue to press the board of directors
for the finance to invest in proper facilities so that he can centralise
all of his coaching ideas.
He wants outdoor and indoor pitches for his club so that training,
coaching, and developing can continue regardless of the severity of the
Scottish weather.

SCOTS companies in the important small to medium-sized sector will be
millions of pounds better off following a visit to Scotland on Monday by
the European Investment Bank.
It is the first official visit by the EIB for many years and bank
president Sir Brian Unwin will open his global cheque book ready to sign
loans carrying special job creation interest rates.
A contract-signing session is planned with at least two Scottish
banks, for the financing of growth of small and medium-sized businesses
which account for up to 90% of the country's marketplace.
Furthermore, borrowers whose investment plans lead to new jobs are set
to benefit through a special EIB interest rate rebate scheme.
A spokesman at the bank's Luxembourg headquarters said the exercise
will also involve the European Union's long-term lending institution
having talks with the Scottish Office and Scottish Enterprise.
The bank is keen to increase funds for industrial activities including
proposals for large infrastructure and energy projects in Scotland, the
spokesman added.
Also on the agenda will be participation in schemes involving the new
water bodies together with inward investment support.
In the past five years, the EIB has authorised Scottish loans of more
than #1000m for capital investment, ranging from the Skye Bridge and
various road schemes to regional water supply and waste water treatment
schemes.
Other areas the bank has backed have included North Sea oil and
industrial gas projects, silicon wafer production for integrated
circuits companies, and the construction of a new dairy.
The EIB is going to consolidate its job creation initiatives in
Scotland with a visit by a small delegation in a few days.

A DECISION on European financing for an economically beneficial
transport link in the north is expected next week.
But it has already emerged that the completion of this link will
generate further pressure for even more infrastructural investment in
one of the most peripheral areas of Scotland. According to those
lobbying for the project to get the go-ahead, a car ferry to link the
south of Harris and North Uist will transform the economy of the Western
Isles.
Scottish Office funds have already been guaranteed for the ferry,
which will cost around #2m, provided that Objective One financing from
the European Union's regional development fund is forthcoming. A
decision on EU money is expected on Wednesday, and if it is positive,
the contract will go out to tender shortly afterwards.
''We hope to be in a position to order a vessel by the end of March,
and to start the service by May 1996,'' said Colin Paterson, managing
director of ferry company Caledonian MacBrayne, which will operate the
ship.
According to Western Isles Islands Council's director of technical
Services, Murdo Murray, the importance of the proposed Sound of Harris
car ferry service cannot be overstated. ''We have been working on the
project for a number of years.
''It is a vital link in the council's policy of a transport system
allowing uninterrupted travel between the Butt of Lewis and Vatersay.
This will benefit the economy, by allowing workers and tourists to cross
the Sound of Harris, and it will allow people to travel to the north or
south islands and back in a day,'' he said.
At present, a passenger only service links Berneray and Leverburgh in
South Harris, while a small car ferry links Berneray with North Uist.
Car users have to travel by a Caledonian MacBrayne ferry via Uig in
Skye, if they want to travel between Uist, and Lewis and Harris. The new
ferry, which will call in the island of Berneray to justify the
economics of providing the service, will eliminate this round trip.

Meanwhile, callers to Dillons' Glasgow store yesterday found business
going on as normal, apart from a brief hiccup in the morning as receiver
KPMG began its search for a buyer for the chain.
The store was thronged with shoppers at lunchtime perhaps on the
search for bargains as the news filtered through of Pentos' demise.
They were to be disappointed as prices remained at their previous
levels, with the store operating ''very much as normal'', a spokesman
for the receivers said.
Earlier yesterday morning that was not the case as the doors remained
locked for some time, with a notice apologising for the inconvenience.
Five assistants could be seen in the bookstore. However, they refused
to come to the door which remained locked even to those with
appointments.
John Kettle, an art book salesman from London publisher Thames and
Hudson, arrived for a 10am appointment but was not admitted.
He said: ''The speculation in the trade was that something like this
was likely to happen. The Pentos chain has been in difficulty for some
time, and recently they insisted publishers sign a 90-day sale or return
agreement on their books before Dillons would stock them.
''It's a real shame because they are a fine book chain, with some
excellent book sellers. I'm sure they'll soon find a buyer.''
Dillons also has stores in Aberdeen, Inverness and Stirling, but the
receiver was unable to confirm last night how many people were employed
in the shops.
Yesterday staff at the Glasgow store were remaining tight-lipped,
having been instructed not to talk to the media.
Store manager Graeme Wilson refused to comment, referring all
enquiries to Dillons' regional office, which in turn passed questions on
to Pentos' London-based public relations company.

PENTOS, owner of Dillons bookshops and Rymans stationers, gave up its
battle for survival yesterday and called in the receiver.
The move came as its bankers refused to extend any further credit to
the group which has struggled to drag itself out of the financial mire
during the past two years.
The collapse of the business places almost 3000 jobs at risk. Dillons'
main book store in London's Gower Street, close to London University,
was shut first thing yesterday morning with large notices posted on its
doors and windows.
However, there is a very good chance that at least the Dillons
business will be sold by the receiver, KPMG. ''Dillons is an extremely
well-known High Street name with an outstanding reputation throughout
the UK,'' said KPMG insolvency partner Stephen James. Dillons has 12% of
the market for new titles, including its Hatchards chain bought in 1990.
Former chairman and founder of the group, Terry Maher has been
mentioned as a possible buyer along with Barnes &amp; Noble, the American
discount chain, Richard Branson's Virgin Group and John Menzies.
W H Smith appears to be ruled out as a possible buyer because it
already sells books through W H Smith books and its specialist chain
Waterstones.
Mr Maher said he was ''deeply angry'' that the group had collapsed.
The Booksellers' Association said it was ''shocked and dismayed'' at the
news.
Trading within Pentos was said to be recovering but at the end of the
day the estimated extra #20m of working capital the group needed was not
forthcoming from its banks, led by Barclays and Midland.
''Despite strenuous efforts by the board, discussions regarding a
refinancing of the company with both the company's banks and other
interested parties have not proved successful,'' the company said.
This was perhaps not surprising given its already high level of
indebtedness with #50m borrowings at the year-end, a figure set to rise
to as much as #75m by the end of this month as the group pays suppliers
and its next quarterly rent bill. During the past few weeks Pentos has
been trying to secure lower rents from its landlords and easier payment
terms from its creditors.
In January it put its Athena poster and greetings cards High Street
chain into administration in an attempt to try to focus on saving the
Dillons chain. Around 600 jobs were lost in Athena. Buyers had been
sought for Rymans stationery and the Pentos Office Furniture businesess.
The latter is not currently in receivership.
Pentos management is headed by Sir Kit McMahon, former deputy governor
of the Bank of England, and Bill McGrath, a former director of the
Wickes DIY chain. Its shares were suspended at 4.5p on Monday.

IN the highly competitive world of surgical supplies, one
Dunbartonshire company has not only carved a niche for itself but has
now moved ahead of its competitors -- showing a quite literal ''clean
pair of heels'' as it powers on.
And when you consider that the competition includes multinationals
Johnson and Johnson and Kimberley Clark, the success of February's
TrailBlazer of the month is all the more exceptional.
From his offices in Cumbernauld, managing director, Robert Cumming,
oversees the activities of Ashfield Medical Systems Ltd, a company
dedicated to the manufacture of disposable surgical drapes and gowns for
the UK and overseas market.
Originally working under licence from an American company, Ashfield
began trading in 1991 using funding from Dunbartonshire Enterprise. The
funding helped put it on a course that, in three short years, has seen
the organisation develop into one of the LEC's 15 growth partners -- a
flagship programme for companies who have been identified as having
exceptional growth potential.
Quickly identifying that its products would have to be tailored to the
needs of the European marketplace, Ashfield bought out the American
party and proceeded to establish its trade arm, Eurodrape, as a key
supplier of quality medical equipment at home and abroad.
''It wasn't long before we realised that our products would have to be
adapted for European requirements,'' says Cumming. ''Now our business is
centred on supplying European kit packers with all their draping
materials.
''We see ourselves as partners to our customers and we do what is
necessary to make their jobs easier.''
To manufacture the company's range of towels, wraps and covers, the
raw material is bought in roll form, cut to size and then packed in
pouches for distribution. Sterilisation, if required, takes place in
Derby.
Whatever the product, Ashfield's quick response times and flexibility
of designs have been key ingredients in the success of the venture and
have given the company a headstart in its bid to become established in
the highly competitive European market.
''We have developed a flexibility of design that allows us to cater to
the specific needs of individual customers and consequently their
customers,'' explains Cumming. ''We pride ourselves on being able to
offer a wide range of products form a standard range of raw materials.''
A growing demand for preparation trays -- containers incorporating all
the components required for a standard operating procedure -- provided
the ideal opportunity for Ashfield to expand the business. Although not
in a position to manufacture the trays themselves, the company made
contact with the kit packers, negotiating a deal to supply them with all
their draping needs.
As a result Ashfield has now expanded its workforce to 25 with its
products selling in the UK, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany and Holland.
''We are also in the process of developing a relationship with a
company in South Africa,'' adds Cumming. ''We feel the next stage is to
buy products outwith the EEC because our research shows that we can
import certain products at lower cost than our present customers are
buying, thus enabling us to offer a wider range of products.
''The idea is that the company will buy our products, sterilise them,
and sell them in South Africa. In return we will buy bulk non-sterile
products from them and supply to our customers.''
The expansion plans are impressive but Ashfield is not content to
restrict growth to geographical areas and is now pushing ahead with a
development programme in other medical disciplines. Although primarily
involved in cardiology, the company now has designs in opthalmology and
orthopaedics.
''We are always trying to identify new markets and I personally feel
opthalmology and orthopaedics represent a promising growth area for the
company.''
Identifying opportunities is vital for the survival of any business,
and the medical world is no exception. The manufacture and preparation
trays may have been out of Ashfield's reach but as their marketing
strategy changed and floor space became available, the company saw a
golden opportunity to utilise on-site facilities.
The purpose built cleanroom didn't stay vacant for long and Ashfield
were soon in a position to subcontract assembly work for two American
catheter companies who find it easier to get their new products to
market in Europe than in the United States.
One company makes catheters for use in infertility treatment and the
other for the treatment of heartbeat irregularities (cardiac
arrhythmias).
Although this side of the business is relatively small at the moment,
the company is keen to encourage future expansion.
Commenting on the company's development plans, John Ker, Head of
Owner-managed Business Services at Ernst &amp; Young, says: ''Ashfield is
clearly not content to dwell on past achievements and it is very
encouraging to see the company embarking on such an ambitious expansion
programme, not only in Europe, but in a variety of overseas markets.''
Having successfuly negotiated three years of trading, Ashfield is now
looking to a second phase of development which will involve significant
capital expenditure. Funding this development has proved to be a
time-consuming exercise but Robert Cumming is confident that the
anticipated increase in production capacity will allow the projected
turnover of #1m for 1995 to double again in 1996.
This may appear bullish but from the company's complex programme of
expansion it is clear that Ashfield Medical Systems is in fighting-fit
form, emerging from this TrailBlazer check-up with a perfect bill of
health.

BEIJING: Education officials have demanded an end to corporal
punishment in Chinese schools after a nine-year-old schoolgirl died of
injuries caused by a beating from her teacher, newspapers said
yesterday. The appeal was in response to reports that teachers at a
school in Hubei province routinely beat pupils with wooden canes and
rubber pipes.

TOMMY McLean the Hearts manager, awoke yesterday morning and admitted
that he could not believe statements from former internationalist
striker Mo Johnston that he had won his battle with the Tynecastle club
over a settlement to leave.
Johnston, who was reputedly on #3000 a week and who had been frozen
out of the first team at Tynecastle, signed for Falkirk on Tuesday, and
announced that he had won his point, saying he had a cheque from Hearts
and that he was satisfied he had won his point.
However, last night McLean said: ''If Mo is talking about winning a
battle, then I'm prepared to lose battles like that all the time.
''I don't normally discuss business deals, but in this case I feel I
owe it to our fans. I can state categorically that this deal cost Hearts
#50,000, and for that we got a player from Falkirk, Colin Cramb.
''If Mo is saying that he got a cheque from Hearts, then fine, but I
say that any money he received came from Falkirk, not us. And, at the
end of the day, the shareholders of both clubs will find out the true
facts of this whole episode.''
I understand that Johnston's ''settlement'' was in the region #75,000,
but McLean insisted: ''The money certainly didn't come out of our club.
I just want our fans to know that. Now the deal is over and the player
has moved. I don't want to be involved in a slanging match -- I just
want to get on with the job of doing the best I can for Hearts.''
* PARTICK Thistle have failed in a bid to bring former winger David
Elliot back to Firhill in an effort to help the club fight against
relegation.
Elliot, who joined Thistle from Celtic in 1989 before moving on to
Love Street two years later, was keen to make a return to the premier
division but the deal has fallen through.
The Maryhill side were prepared to offer Bobby Law and striker Wayne
Foster in exchange.
* ERIC Cantona is set to return to Manchester United for training.
The Frenchman, banned from football until September 30 after a
well-publicised incident at Crystal Palace, is expected to help coach
the club's youngsters and assist at their school of excellence during
his eight-month ban.

BRUSSELS: The European Parliament yesterday vetoed controversial
legislation to grant legal protection to patents for life forms, in a
major defeat for Europe's biotechnology industry. The parliament, using
new powers under the Maastricht treaty, rejected the text by 240 votes
to 188, with 23 abstentions, thus killing the legislation.

ABERDEEN will put every one of their players up for sale if they lose
their fight for premier division survival. Chairman Ian Donald revealed
the move yesterday as part of drastic contingency plans that have
already been drawn up.
He said : ''If we go down -- and we remain optimistic this will not
happen -- the entire club will be restructured. Costs will be slashed
right across the board, and one of these will be to put all our players
up for sale.
''Apart from Rangers and Celtic, our players are the highest-paid in
the country. We could not afford to continue paying premier division
salaries in the first division. It is now up to the players. Their
careers are on the line, and the ball is in their court.
''What happens in the coming weeks has nothing to do with anyone
except our players. It doesn't matter who is chairman or who is on the
board. It is all about pride in performance.
''It is up to them to prove they are battlers. That is the quality
needed most of all to take us out of our present position,'' he went on.
''If we go down it will show they do not possess this quality when it
matters most, in the last quarter of the season.
''Frankly, how could you continue with the same players in a league
where, more than anything, it is all about fight and determination to
win promotion?
''Changes would then have to be made out of necessity to bring the
right type of players into the club.
''A great deal rests on the next 10 games. I could not evaluate the
cost to the club that relegation would bring.
''It is enough to say it would be a catastrophe for all concerned,''
Donald said.
Relegation would hit Aberdeen's plans for a share launch this summer,
and would slash demand for the corporate entertaining facilities at
Pittodrie.
With Aberdeen already #2m in debt, the board would be forced to reduce
overheads.
Meantime, Aberdeen received a welcome boost yesterday when defender
Colin Woodthorpe, out for the past four months with a back injury, was
given the all-clear to re-start training.
The #400,000 buy from Norwich City looks certain to be back later this
month.
Caretaker manager Roy Aitken said: ''Woodthorpe has worked very hard
to get to this stage. Now he wants make up for lost time and get himself
match fit.
''He is a very important member of our squad and, hopefully, will be
available within a few weeks.''
Motherwell agreed to switch their reserve game with the Dons to
Pittodrie today after Fir Park was waterlogged.
This will allow Pittodrie midfielder Brian Grant to tune up for
Sunday's televised game against Celtic at Parkhead.
* STENHOUSEMUIR yesterday failed in their request for a blank midweek
ahead of their Tennents Scottish Cup quarter-final against Hibernian.
They will now meet Berwick next Tuesday in a second division promotion
match just days before the cup-tie.
The problem for Stenhousemuir arose after the league match between the
two was washed out by the heavy rain two days ago.
Meantime, the premier division match between Partick Thistle and
Motherwell, also cancelled on Tuesday, has been re-dated for Tuesday,
March 14.
Thistle are already scheduled for action next Tuesday against Dundee
United.
Other re-scheduled games that night are in the third division, with
East Stirling playing Albion Rovers and Forfar facing Montrose.
* EDINBURGH rivals Hearts and Hibernian remain locked in dispute over
the fee for midfielder Brian Hamilton, who recrently moved to
Tynecastle.
As they have failed to agree, a transfer tribunal will be held in
Glasgow today to settle the fee. Hibs want #425,000 for Hamilton, while
Hearts have offered #175,000.

THE Scottish Rugby Union is to carry out its threat to pinpoint
individuals attending Saturday's Murrayfield match against Wales
courtesy of tickets purchased on the black market.
The SRU had threatened to invoke the ''embarrassment factor'' by
pasting notices on seats occupied by those identified as being in the
ground on unofficially sourced tickets.
The Herald understands that a large number of seats are to be given
the pasting treatment, and corporate hospitality guests will be
confronted with the sign which state that they are sitting on seats
obtained through the black market.
Carnegie Sports International, the SRU's Murrayfield debenture
advisers, have been carrying out an undercover operation for the last
two home games in a successful attempt to identify the source of tickets
used in conjunction with unofficial hospitality operations.
The SRU runs the only official hospitality facility at Murrayfield and
claims that pirate operators are costing the Scottish game hundreds of
thousands of pounds a season.
As a result of the Carnegie operation it has been discovered that a
number of ''blue chip'' Scottish companies have been entertaining
clients at Murrayfield games using unofficially sourced tickets.
At least one merchant bank and an renowned company have been
identified as having entertained customers with tickets bought on the
black market.
* THE debate over the venue of the 1999 World Cup continues today when
the International Board meets.
Wales has bid to host the finals and they are being supported by the
RFU, the quid pro quo apparently being that two semi-finals are staged
at Twickenham.
Scotland and Ireland have been offered selected pool games, but
Scotland is insisting on staging pool games plus a Murrayfield
semi-final.
THE announcement of a cup competition for Scotland is expected soon. A
major league upheaval is scheduled next season, but whatever is finally
decided about the league structure, a Scottish Cup competition will
become a reality next season.
In its early stages the cup would be fought out on a regional basis,
with cup final day taking place at Murrayfield.

<HEADLINE>Surge in manufacturing growth as demand rises</HEADLINE>

MANUFACTURING growth accelerated last month, but price pressures
remained at a high level, according to the latest findings of the
Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply.
The seasonally adjusted Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 57% in
February from 53% in January, arresting the slowdown over the previous
six months.
Any figure above 50% indicates that manufacturing output is
increasing. The manufacturing economy has now expanded for 27 months in
a row.
Official figures from the Central Statistical Office have suggested
that manufacturing slowed down in the second half of last year, though
it remained the main driving force behind economic growth.
The latest Purchasing Managers' Index comes as confirmation of last
week's CBI survey which indicated that export orders were at a record
level.
The new orders index bounded up from 49.5% to 57.8% and contributed to
the rise in the main index. The index had been falling back since June,
but in February the number of purchasing managers reporting an increase
in order books rose, particularly in response to demand from overseas.
A sharp rise in the seasonally adjusted output index, which jumped
from 51.3% in January to 56.1% in February, also contributed to the rise
in the main index.
Higher prices continued to cause concern, although upward pressures
eased slightly. The prices index retreated from 75% in January to 72.6%.
It was the eighth consecutive month in which the prices index
registered over 70%. Raw materials prices rose, particularly for steel,
paper and plastics, as did a growing number of manufactured items.
Capacity constraints were also reported to have contributed to the
rise in prices, and the employment index rose from 54.2% to 56.5% as
manufacturing recruitment speeded up.
''Rising prices of both inputs and raw materials, compounded by longer
delivery times, appear to be creeping across the supply chain,'' Peter
Thomson, the institute's director-general, said.
''The good news is that purchasing managers are reporting a renewed
strength in manufacturing activity, reversing the previous slowdown in
growth. This has been caused by a jump in new orders, particularly from
overseas, and a sharp rise in productivity.''
Order books are strongest for electrical, electronic and metal-based
products, and the improvement in output is least pronounced in
consumer-based industries.
Purchasing managers' indices are married to official figures from the
CSO and the Bank of England to produce a leading indicator of inflation.
This signals a rise in retail price inflation this year and next,
though it remains historically low throughout the period. Prices are
expected to peak late next year.

EXPORTS and imports of cars continue to provide a strong boost to
Associated British Ports, the UK's largest ports group.
British-based Japanese manufacturers, including Toyota, whose Derby
factory production is being exported through Grimsby, helped ABP to lift
profits 29.3% last year, from #62.1m to #80.3m before tax. First-half
growth continued into the latter half.
Chairman Sir Keith Stuart yesterday reported that the year has seen
''excellent progress'' in all aspect of the business.
A recommended final dividend of 3.5p takes the total from 4.65p to
5.5p, covered by earnings per share 18.3% ahead from 12.8p to 16.4p.
The results were much in line with expectations and the shares slipped
3p to 262p.
The group's port and transport operations contributed #68.5m, up from
#55.9m, reflecting growth in trade and reduced costs of severances,
while port-related property income also rose significantly, from #20.7m
to #23.9m.
Aside from vehicles, there were higher volumes of timber and other
building materials, steel, minerals and petroleum. There also further
strong growth in container business. The total number of passengers
using ABP facilities increased from 4.5 million to 4.9 million.
ABP enjoys a growing income from non-direct port property including
parking land for car exporters such as Toyota and importers VAG. At
Grimsby, a new 50-acre car storage and distribution terminal came into
use in December for the whole of VAG's northern import and distribution
activities.
The company said its property investment and development programme
made encouraging progress during the year, particularly at sites located
near its ports.
Outside the port locations, the property development and investment
portfolio is almost 100% let.
Sales of properties are being made when attractive opportunities
arise, and during the course of the last 12 months, Grosvenor Square
Properties, the wholly owned property subsidiary, has chalked up sales
of around #36m including, more recently, the sale of the group's 50%
interest in the Buchanan Centre at Glasgow.
However, the Athenaeum development in Glasgow has been stuck on 39%
let for some time.
ABP's gearing continues to fall and stood at 46% at the end of 1994,
compared to 52.5% a year previously. Strong cash flow from operations
financed capital expenditure of #47m, in the ports and transport
business, and #12m on investment properties.
The company has the advantage that rising revenues feed swiftly
through to the bottom line because of excess capacity in UK ports and
its fixed costs nature. It will be benefiting substantially from
Britain's export led recovery.
Looking ahead, the chairman said: ''The ports are attracting new
business on a substantial scale, underpinning strong investment-led
growth.
''Our property activities are also making an increasing contribution
to overall performance. I am confident that we shall continue to make
good progress.''

STERLING was nervous ahead of last night's vote on Europe.
While the markets expected that if there was a Government defeat,
Prime Minister John Major would win any subsequent vote of confidence in
Parliament, there would be a general air of uncertainty until the second
vote took place. But it would in any case increase the nervousness of
those holding sterling assets.
The pound is under slight pressure as a consequence of the increased
liquidity pumped into the market by the Bank of England in the wake of
the Barings crisis which has lowered overnight rates to the extent that
there is about a 1% differential in favour of switching into the German
mark.
There was a little profit-taking in the mark with some of the
peripheral currencies such as the Italian lira and Spanish peseta making
gains against the German currency.
The pound recovered over a pfennig against the mark to DM2.3189 and
was unchanged against the dollar at $1.5830. The trade-weighted index
eased 0.1 to 86.7.

ST ALOYSIUS College are hopeful that their often-postponed Schools Cup
quarter-final tie against Peebles High will go ahead today.
The match, delayed because of flooded pitches and inter-district
games, was rescheduled for Millerston on Tuesday, but again bad weather
intervened.
However, the frustrations of St Aloysius' cup campaign have been
offset by an encouraging season, in which their first XV has won 12 and
drawn one of their 20 matches so far. And this with a relatively young
side.
''Most of the boys in the first XV are only in fifth year, and it is
likely that 11 will be back next season,'' said coach Phil Crampsey.
''They are maturing and that is showing in results.''
The biggest win this season was against Glenalmond (42-3), but there
have been fine victories over Heriot's (29-25) and Strathallan 15-12,
both at Millerston.
''We won home and away against Presentation College in Bray, the first
time we have succeeded in doing so against the Irish school,'' said
Crampsey, who admits that his biggest risk this season was playing
Boroughmuir in the School Cup without the services of wing, James Craig.
''In the event we held them to a 0-0 draw to force a replay, which we
then won 34-13,'' Crampsey recalled.
With so many members of the first XV likely to return next session, St
Aloysius College can look forward to an exciting season, the culmination
of which should be a tour to Zimbabwe in the summer of 1996.
''We have been invited by St George's, Harare, to take part in a
celebration tournament, at which there will be teams from other parts of
the UK, South Africa, and Australia,'' explains Crampsey, who is aware
that the exercise will involve a considerable amount of fund raising.
Also looking to the future are North Schools, who got the taste of
success earlier this week. While the Under-18 side were going down 58-0
against Lothians in the inter-district championship, the North Under-16
team, on an adjacent pitch, delivered a warning shot about future
commitement with a 15-13 victory over their Lothian counterparts.
And this success is a reflection of a successful system that has been
put in place. ''We target talented players and bring them together on a
regular basis,'' said Graham Cormack, the SRU youth development officer
based in Dingwall.
''That means that when we coach the boys at under-18 level, we will
not have to work on basic skills. We hope that we will be able to give
the likes of Lothian harder games in the future.''

LAST year's Challenger tank order transformed prospects for Vickers
and the group's results statement for 1994 has a confident air about it.
Recovery in Rolls-Royce cars and the Cosworth motor sport engine
business propelled profits up from #32.3m to #44.8m even after
restructuring costs of #6.7m against #1.2m.
The final dividend of 3p raises the total from 3p to 4.75p, though
this still leaves them less than half the peak seen for 1990.
Vickers ended the year with net cash of #51m, which has enabled it to
step up investment snd consider acquisitions.
Cosworth is putting #8m into a plant to make engines for the new
Jaguar AJ26. Rolls-Royce is to build its own body shells rather than
contracting the work out to Rover. A Finnish company, FFJet, was bought
to add to the existing KaMeWa's waterjet activities.
Rolls-Royce is preparing for the next new models due out toward the
end of the decade and has lined up BMW to supply engines and other
parts. In fact, BMW's total contribution could amount to 50% of the new
range.
Sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars rose by 4% to 1414 last year as
a result of a 24% increase in the UK. This is still well under half the
peak seen in 1990.
The recovery stemmed from restructuring and a better product mix which
improved margins. Before restructuring costs the automotive contribution
to group operating profits doubled to #21m, which represented 40% of the
total.
Included in the division is Cosworth whose year was marked by the
winning of the Formula 1 drivers' world champion by Michael Schumacher
in a Benetton-Ford powered by a Cosworth developed engine.
On the Indy circuit, Cosworth engined cars scored four race victories.
The road engines business won contracts to offset lower sales of the
Ford Scorpio and RS Escort. Increasingly the company is supplying
specialist components as well as complete engines.
Defence profits are ticking over, at #12.7m last year, ahead of the
benefits of the Challenger 2 contract which involves 259 new tanks. This
took the order book to #1500m.
The award increases the chance of an eventual order from Saudi Arabia
but chief executive Sir Colin Chandler said this was unlikely to arise
before the end of 1996 or early 1997.
Propulsion technology enjoyed mixed fortunes, ending with profits
barely changed at #9.3m. But the business is said to be in better shape.
The medical business, which includes the world leader in neonatal
intensive care products, slipped back as healthcare spending came under
pressure. But recovery is expected this year.
Overall, chairman Sir Richard Lloyd says prospects are encouraging and
forecasts further earnings growth. Analysts agree and are scaling up
their 1995 forecasts.

CHARLIE Nicholas was summoned back from football's twilight zone, life
in the reserves, to play in Celtic's challenge match against Real Madrid
in Malaga the other night.
The match could have provided him with a platform on which to display
some of the game's lost arts, but even one of the finest talents
produced in Scotland had to stand back in appreciation.
''We were all given a lesson in how the game should be played, and we
also saw how beautiful it can be when done properly,'' said the
33-year-old, who had been concerned about ever winning back his place in
the first team.
Even though Nicholas started the match, he is wise enough to know that
his time may be up not only at Celtic Park but in football, and he faces
a difficult decision. His contract expires at the end of this season and
he has no idea what the future holds. He admits to feeling ''confused''
at times and has taken to reflecting on his life and career.
Whenever someone starts to analyse and question his contributions it
can be a sign that time is running out, that his or her power is on the
wane. Nicholas was more expansive than most, admitting that he may have
made a mistake when he opted for Arsenal earlier in his career instead
of Liverpool. He also spoke of his disappointment and frustration that
his full potential was never realised.
''Now that I'm at this late stage in my career, it is impossible to
look up and say what's ahead,'' he said. ''I really have no idea and I
don't even know what I want, but I would like now to make the right
decision.
''I had a few decisions to make earlier in my career and, looking
back, I went to Arsenal when I should perhaps have gone to Liverpool. I
arrived at Highbury as a 21-year-old, and there were a lot of players
there who simply stood back and said, 'Alright Charlie, it's up to you.'
''
Nicholas travelled to London some time after his reputation, and
although he had his moments with Arsenal he did not enjoy the success he
anticipated. Adulation all around and bright lights did not offer him
the best environment in which to concentrate fully, and the game
subsequently was denied the best of Nicholas.
Even so, he was a player of sublime skills, but no-one will ever know
just how good he might have become. ''I think about that and I wonder,
too,'' he said.
''I look back and I know I didn't fulfill my potential. I blame myself
for a lot of it, and perhaps I never adjusted to the physical demands
and maybe I didn't look after myself the way I should have.
''There was a lot of passing and movement, but these things came
easily to me and I got bored. Nowadays, though, everything is on speed
and strength and I don't have the legs for that.
''However, while my legs may be slower than a lot of the current
players, I'm still quicker than them mentally.''
Nicholas has been in most of Celtic's first-team squads -- ''Tommy
Burns has helped make me feel I'm still part of things'' -- and he has
watched a lot of matches at close quarters. He doesn't like what he
sees.
''All I seem to be looking at are players who are fitter than I am,''
he said. ''I also see that people are forgetting the basics, how to pass
and even when to pass.
''I see young players doing extra gym work to improve strength and
speed, but I don't see many of them working overtime on their basic
skills. There is no imagination in the game and even the 20-year-old
Charlie Nicholas would struggle to keep up with the pace and power of
today's Scottish game.
''Yet, in Malaga the other night we saw genuine pace applied to
explosive skills and the blend is formidable. That is the way football
should be played.''
Nicholas feels it is difficult at this stage to look much further than
the present, but perhaps he really doesn't want to think too deeply
about what will become of him in the game at the end of this season.
''Maybe I don't know what I want to do, I don't even know if I want to
stay in the game,'' he said.
''I do know, however, that this is the most difficult part of my time
in the game. Watching is really hard, especially when I don't see many
players who are better than I am.''
He has looked at players like Davie Cooper, who appears content
dropping down a division and continuing to perform there, but Nicholas
might not bother.
''If I have to leave Celtic perhaps other teams, you know, teams in
lower divisions, might feel they couldn't afford me and others might
regard me as being too opinionated,'' he said.
''There's nothing wrong with saying what you think and I believe you
should always go with the skill. The game should not be about mediocrity
and athletes.
''How many times do you hear managers complementing players on their
work-rate, praising them for having put in a hard shift? You know, it's
getting to the stage in our game where you are disadvantaged if you have
skill.''
Even though Real Madrid played the game on a different level it was
still a treat to watch them, and Nicholas, who was substituted at
half-time, felt more at home among genuine players than he has for some
time.
Real Madrid are leaders of the Spanish first division and look to be
on the verge of again dominating the game not only at home but also
abroad.
Celtic and their younger players were given another lesson, but if
that can make them aspire to better things, then the 2-0 defeat will
have been well worth the effort.
As for Nicholas, he felt comfortable among kindred spirits.

ABOUT his voice and singing ability there was no doubt on Monday
night: Jeff Buckley is the vocalist as we near fresh twenty-first
century vistas. When not insinuating himself into your heart with his
plaintive whispers and intimate, little-boy breathiness, Buckley is
unrolling vast, creamy swoops or raw-throated, free-form,
higher-register shrieks.
His voice floats and flutters, feather-light, embodying a complex mix
of pain, pride, and bewilderment. Or it keens and roars with a brutal
proto-punk edge. The effect on an audience is invariably the same:
spine-tingling and awe-inspiring.
But as for Jeff Buckley's own songs and his on-stage presentation . .
. well, the jury remains out. His half-dozen or so self-composed songs
conform to a samey-sounding formula best summed up as plangent grunge.
No wonder then that Monday's genuine show-stoppers were covers.
His version of Lilac Wine, immortalised by Nina Simone prior to
ruination by Elkie Brooks, was eerily astounding. Concluding with
Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah, Buckley left us rapt, arrested, astonished,
sated.
Earlier, though, we'd seen him slough his shirt and jacket with an
unattractive, self-loving shimmy. His jokey between-song chats were less
than necessary too.
Or, to quote the two Paisley women standing next to me in the sell-out
crowd, ''Start the singin' and stop the comedy!'' Otherwise, they kept
bellowing ''AC Milan!'' in hormonal appreciation of Jeff's resemblance
to Paolo Maldini. Moral? Keep your feet on the ground and your eye on
the ball, Jeff.

CONDUCTORLESS nights, especially if they include a work for strings,
are among the SCO's most welcome side attractions. Yesterday's had
Dvorak's string serenade as its high-point, a rapt, idyllic performance
directed by James Clark from the leader's desk, in which every melody,
rhythm, contour, and change of mood had been contemplated afresh.
Clark, it was clear, adored the music, and seized his opportunity to
bring out little details -- some billowy passagework for the violas
especially sticks in the mind -- that conductors sometimes pass over.
Yet the effect was never inert, even in the flowery phrases of the slow
movement. Where bite was needed, it was there, and the tender
recollections of earlier movements were drawn skilfully into the
structure of the finale without enfeebling its impulse.
But feebleness, earlier in the programme, was not entirely kept at
bay. Franz Krommer's concerto for two clarinets contained its own brand
of Czech charm, but otherwise possessed not a single arresting feature.
Though dating from 1815, a not unimportant year for Europe, it was
content to be a piece of genial escapism, which was how Lewis Morrison
and Ruth Ellis sensibly treated it.
Happily, Haydn's Surprise symphony had already given the concert a
properly arresting start. Though the treatment of the minuet, with too
many intrusive slow-ups, proved that Haydn's humour works best when not
overstated, the rest of the performance was robustly enjoyable.

ONE of the temptations to any organisation that contains multiple
resources is to show all its strengths at once: like trying to display
all the best goods in one small window -- overcrowding and lack of focus
can result.
To a degree that's what happened last night when the Northern
College's School of Music put on a flagship show of around a dozen acts
that, one suspected, wasn't so much a display of strength as a display
of just about everything they have. The risk is that the total result
doesn't equal the sum of the parts.
Everything from choirs to saxophone group and swing band, from violin
quartet to flute solo, had their chance. Rich though the variety was, it
almost distracted from what gives the Northern College its distinctive
voice -- the world music centre. And this was interesting.
The samba band which opened the evening has potential, though they
sounded constrained -- a burst of spontaneity and the odd vocal whoop
would have spiced it up. The small, African-sounding choir, with some
more earthiness in their singing, will get very close to something
authentic and moving.
The sumptuous gamelan orchestra and Ghanaian drum section crown the
centre. Beautiful to look at, hypnotic to the ears, not only are their
sounds infectious and colourful in their own right, but it's fascinating
to hear the musical seedbeds from which so many modern composers have
filched their ''new'' ideas. We will hear more of the world music
centre; no doubt about that.

RAINDOG'S study of poverty and exploitation in urban Glasgow drives
headlong into the Tron with a blast of high voltage, hardcore
techno-theatre. The stroboscope flashes, the sound system pulsates, a
collage of low-budget porn films jump across the backdrop, and the
17-strong cast rant and rage, or bump and grind.
The thesis of this devised drama, performed on Kenny Miller's bleak
set of distressed brick, torn sheeting, and industrial debris, is that
our society is complicit in a chain of abuse in which sex is a saleable
commodity and drugs are the ultimate goal. Set in the backroom of a
seedy sex cinema, it concerns a no-hope band of dropouts, alcoholics,
and addicts who have been coerced into producing bottom-of-the-market
blue movies.
The sex industry aspect is the most prominent addition to this version
of Wasted, which has just undergone a second period of development after
its first run last year.
Such a long-term approach is a sensible way to treat this kind of
work, which by its nature is always open to further development. The
technical aspect has certainly gained volumes in confidence and
ambition, I only wish I could say the same about the play itself, which
after its thrilling opening salvo dissolves into an aimless succession
of well-acted, often funny, sometimes affecting scenes, none of which
add up to very much.
Where the first production maintained its edge through its exposure of
the bleak realities of street life, this version -- though hardly
pleasant -- seems decadent, less driven, less purposeful by comparison.
All the analysis and most of the insight gets turned out in the first 10
minutes, leaving a production crying out for a playwright's linguistic
precision and dramatic overview.

THE weights for the Coral Cup Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival were
announced yesterday, and connections of Chief Minister could hardly be
more pleased.
The gelding, trained near Dundee by Tom Dyer, will set out on the
754-mile return trip to the Gloucestershire course with high hopes of
really making a name for himself.
The six-year-old, a recent winner at Newcastle, has been allotted 10st
3lb in the two miles five furlongs race, in which Dorans Pride heads the
weights with 12st.
Bobby Dyer, the trainer's brother and assistant, was delighted with
the gelding's weight. ''We couldn't have asked for better,'' he said.
''Peter Hobbs, who has ridden him this season, should again take the
mount.''
Chief Minister is a 16-1 chance, but Dyer added: ''There's a lot of
local interest in him and I doubt he'll stay that price for long. He is
very well.''
* KEVIN Anderson can break his duck this point-to-point season at
Saturday's Tynedale meeting, where he has five rides, writes Tom
McConnell.
His best chance could be on Jimmy River in the Land Rover Open. His
mount has yet to win this season but likes the track at Corbridge, where
he had two of his four successes last year.
He was just beaten by Royal Jester at the recent Berwickshire meeting
after having led until approaching the last. That defeat was no disgrace
as Royal Jester will next run in the foxhunters' race at Cheltenham.
Anderson felt his mount needed the race and, given the soft ground he
loves, should win.
Andrew Parker, with four winners so far, not only has a substantial
lead in the Northern Area but is in joint second place in the UK men's
championship.
Parker's best chance of success at the weekend could be Bogarts Disco,
a close third to Wudimp in a maiden race last month.
One of the biggest shocks at Berwickshire was the defeat of Steele
Justice in the women's open. The winner of 12 such races, partnered by
area champion Pauline Robson, could find nothing from two out and had to
be content with third place behind veteran hunter chaser Sporting
Mariner.
* THE course at Leicester passed a fitness test yesterday. Nick Lees,
the clerk of the course, said: ''No further inspection is planned, but
the forecast is not good.'' Fingers crossed.

Papeete, Wednesday
RECLUSIVE Hollywood superstar Marlon Brando has won a legal battle to
protect his private Tahitian atoll from an unwelcome tourist invasion.
A Tahitian court has ordered a local entrepreneur who set up a
floating hotel on Tetiaroa island's lagoon to vacate the premises before
Friday, officials said today.
Once the playground for Tahitian royalty, Tetiaroa now hosts a
sanctuary for thousands of sea birds as well as the aging actor.
Hotelier Teiki Pambrun, who has been putting up an estimated 6000
guests a year, faces a fine of #3400 a day if he fails to comply, the
officials said.
Pambrun said he plans to comply with the ruling but regrets it will
cause the loss of a dozen jobs.
Tetiaroa, which Brando bought in the 1960s, is one of 115 islands that
make up French Polynesia.--Reuter.

Mary Brennan points out that Glasgow is the place for the strange, the
wayward and the truely remarkable in dance.
SOMETIMES it takes an outside voice to make you appreciate what's on
your own doorstep. A London chum, who works in dance, was on the phone
chatting about who was doing what. ''You do realise'', she said in mock
amazement, ''there's more happening in Glasgow this month than in
London. Or Amsterdam.''
Afterwards I scanned various international listings. London. Paris.
Amsterdam. Guess what? She was right. Thanks to New Moves Limited -- aka
Nikki Milican and Jill Scott -- during March, Glasgow is the place to be
for fans of the new, the strange, the downright wayward and the truly
remarkable in contemporary dance.
Just by dropping into the Tramway -- nine separate programmes, over a
dozen different performances -- you can sample work from Canada, Spain,
France, the UK. You can meet the dance-makers, see works in progress
from four Scottish-based choreographers, take part in a discussion
between Canadian and Scottish practitioners or browse around an
exhibition based on last year's New Moves Across Europe. You can . . .
but will you?
Probably yes, if you've been to any or all of the previous seven New
Moves seasons. You'll know by now that Nikki Milican has a wise eye when
it comes to selecting work.
Over the years she's become a stickler for good technique. But then
you could say that this is actually part of what she sees as the
''integrity'' of any performance. Seasoned dance buffs needn't fret,
therefore, that New Moves Across Europe is a gather-up of extremists
with no discipline and no background of proven training! New Movers tend
to be dance-makers who have studied and performed with fully-paid-up
figures of influence -- they become independent because they have too
much creative individuality to stay within someone else's vision.
This year those New Movers include the intriguingly named Holy Body
Tattoo from Canada. If you've seen the stunning postcards billing the
various performances you'll know that the name reflects their belief
that ''powerful experiences leave marks on the soul . . . They are like
tattoos . . . They cannot be stolen or erased.''
Their presentation of powerful experiences comes through dance that
has been variously described as awe-inspiring, frenzied, electric and
viscerally physical. It sounds a bit like . . . ''Eurocrash!'' says
Nikki with a grin. Eurocrash being the buzz word for the high-speed
brinkmanship, the running-jumping-crashing-and-rebounding style found in
the work of Wim Vandekeybus (brought to you first by New Moves,
remember?). The point is: Holy Body Tattoo have ideas, and that's why
Milican chose to bring them over.
As in other years, the programme mixes several strands. Some
performers are entirely new to Britain -- in fact there are eight
companies making their UK debut at New Moves -- with groups representing
particular international connections, the Canadians, for instance. Hence
the presence of Peter Boneham, artistic director of Canada's only centre
for dance development, Le Groupe Dance Lab in Ottowa.
He has been the inspirational mentor for a host of well-regarded
choreographers. Scottish choreographer Marisa Zanotti spent time working
with him last year -- she described it as being given confidence in
yourself and in your own creative voice.
During New Moves, Boneham will not only work with four Scottish
choreographers -- Alan Greig, Andy Howitt, Frank McConnell and Tristan
Borrer -- he will take technique classes to which all professional
dancers are welcome.
Yes, it's all happening dance-wise in Glasgow this month. But that's
because Milican has trekked off the beaten circuit to find strong new
work while Scott has chased increasingly elusive pennies at home. This
year's budget is #83,000 -- some #18,000 down on last year because
there's no input from the Foundation for Sport and the Arts. The dynamic
duo are reluctant to bleat or whinge, so I'll say it instead. Audience
figures count. Don't assume that New Moves will continue without your
visible support.
Not even brilliant festivals -- and this is a leader in the field --
can happen if nobody sees what's on their own doorstep.

PRINCE Naseem Hamed will step into the ring at Livingston on Saturday
night, knowing that his next fight could be for the world
super-bantamweight championship.
A deal is close to being finalised for the 21-year-old to challenge
World Boxing Association champion Wilfredo Vargas, of Puerto Rico, and
Hamed is certain to get his big chance in Britain, because Vargas does
not want to fight at home. In fact, the Central American likes to fight
''away'' every time, because it means more money for him, and he spends
it almost as quickly as he earns.
Hamed's promoter, Frank Warren, says that a challenge against Vargas
is ''90 per cent there.'' It is hoped to fix a date in June, and a
Scottish venue has not been ruled out.
Hamed became an instant hit with the Scottish boxing public when he
made a defence of his WBC International title at Glasgow's SECC in
January -- he bombed out Armando Castro inside four rounds -- and when
he makes another defence of the title against Argentina's Sergio Rafael
Liendo in Livingston this weekend the promotion is sure to be a
sell-out.
Another sparkling performance will almost certainly clinch a world
title shot, and Felix Zabalah, who manages Vargas, said: ''I'd love to
come to Britain. Vargas is a travelling champion with nine defences, all
overseas. He's never fought at home since winning the title.
''Vargas is 33 years old and he travels to make money. He doesn't want
to fight at home to make $50. He wants to prove to the people that he
can fight overseas, and he is used to fighting in front of big,
screaming crowds.
''I've not seen Hamed fight. I don't have to, because Wilfredo is a
great champion. He's just beaten Orlando Canizales, one of the best
pound-for-pound fighters in the world with 16 bantamweight title
defences.
''I've heard Hamed is one of the best prospects on the planet, but
it's not going to stop Vargas taking this challenge.''
The champion does most of his training and preparation in Miami at
Zabalah's gymnasium, which he has bannered: ''Wilfredo Vargas Knockout
Drops.''
Zabalah added: ''Wilfredo may be 33, but they say at home he is like
wine . . . the older he gets the better he gets. His secret is no big
secret. He trains very hard and is still hungry -- because he's spent
all the money!''
* DONNIE Hood returns to action tonight after a 12-month lay-off, when
he tops the bill at the Hospitality Inn, Glasgow.
The 31-year-old former WBC International bantamweight champion -- with
one fight under his belt since January 1993 -- makes his comeback
against Birmingham's Rowan Williams. On the Brummie's last visit north,
he lost to Paisley's Neil Armstrong.
The joint main event features Walsall's Peter Till against Blackburn's
Karl Roberts. Glasgow's Rocky Ferrari hopes to avenge his only defeat,
when he clashed with Hartlepool light-welter Kevin McKenzie, and
Saltcoats newcomer Jim Montgomerie makes his pro debut against Blackburn
lightweight Scott Marshall.

THE sudden death format used to resolve drawn matches in Japan's
J-League could be introduced by FIFA in the 1998 World Cup finals in
France.
In the J-League, the team which scores the first goal in extra time
wins the game. If the result is still deadlocked after extra time a
penalty shoot-out follows.
FIFA spokesman Andreas Herren said yesterday in Zurich that a proposal
was before the 1998 organising committeee to adopt the format from the
second phase round of 16.
It has already been used successfully -- from the quarter-final stage
of the 1993 World Youth Championship in Australia.
The J-League became the first professional league to bring in the
sudden death system on an experimental basis, with FIFA's blessing, when
it was inaugurated in 1993.
''The proposal was submitted by FIFA's working group Task2000, which
was given the job of finding ways and means to make soccer more
attractive to the public,'' said Herren.
Sepp Blatter, FIFA's chief executive, said in a recent interview that
the J-League experiment was a great success with every game a sell-out
and FIFA had approved its continuation.

EDINBURGH Racers have a chance to prove their British championship
potential when they line up against Grand Slam chasing Nottingham
Panthers in Edinburgh tonight.
The Panthers have been the outstanding side in the Premier Division
this term and come into the game with a two-point cushion over Sheffield
Steelers at the top of the table, thanks to a 6-3 victory over Durham
Wasps on Tuesday.
The Midland side have already claimed three wins out of four over the
Scots, including a 19-2 thumping, but Racers' coach Jock Hay can point
to a 9-6 victory over the league leaders in Edinburgh in mid-November.
Five wins in six games have boosted confidence in Racers' ranks and
their only recent reverse came last Saturday in Nottingham, when the
Scots were tied at 7-7 with 22 minutes left.
Hay said: ''We should have beaten Nottingham, and there's no doubt
that penalties upset our rhythm. We're improving as a team every game
and that's important with the play-offs looming. Victory tonight would
be a massive boost to the team.''

IAN Rush's record-chasing FA Cup heroics for Liverpool may have
stunned Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear into silence -- but not bad boy
Vinnie Jones, whose loud plea for a recall against QPR on Saturday can
now hardly be ignored.
Jones sat fuming in a private box at Selhurst Park as his Dons pals
crashed out of the FA Cup to Rush and the big red Anfield machine.
His three-match first team exile, imposed by Kinnear in the wake of
the infamous Dublin nose-biting incident, had been extended because the
manager did not want to change a winning team -- even to accommodate his
rugged Welsh internationalist.
But the winning stopped when Dons were shunted off the road to Wembley
in a 2-0 fifth round replay crash which included Rush's forty-first FA
Cup goal to equal Denis Law's post-war record in the competition.
And to make matters worse, centre back Andy Thorn is now out for six
weeks with damaged ankle ligaments.
Scott Fitzgerald, another centre half, had already recently joined the
casualties with injuries sustained in a car accident. So no wonder
Kinnear, who the day before the match had lost his driving licence for a
year following a court case, was rendered speechless after the defeat.
But he will surely now have to respond to Jones, whose midfield
aggression was badly missed.

Keith Bruce anticipates a call from Gilmorehill's First Lady.
BEFORE Marion Fraser relinquishes her role as chairwoman of Christian
Aid in three and a half years time, I will not be surprised if my
telephone rings when she believes I can be of some service to the
charity. Lady Fraser is not, one feels sure, a woman to forget a name or
a face.
Married to Sir William Kerr Fraser, who retires this year as principal
of Glasgow University, it is her connection with concert pianist Imogen
Cooper that has given the university's development fund a high-profile
launch for its appeal to build a new centre for the study of theatre,
film, and television on the edge of the campus.
The year after the couple moved in to the principal's handsome
residence in 1988, they took a walking holiday in Italy as part of a
group of eight. Over ten days lasting friendships were forged,
particularly between the Frasers and the pianist and her photographer
husband John Batten.
''We shared a lot of good meals and bottles of very good wine,'' Lady
Fraser remembers, including a boisterous celebration of Imogen Cooper's
birthday. Music was the substance of much of the conversation. A former
pupil of Hutchesons' Grammar School in Glasgow, Lady Fraser is no mean
pianist herself and a graduate of both the university and the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music.
Anxious to make a contribution to the university's fundraising before
she and Sir William leave for their new home in Gifford, East Lothian,
she contacted Cooper and asked if she would give a concert. It takes
place in the university's Bute Hall on Saturday with a programme that
includes Mozart, Schubert, Debussy, and Janacek.
Lady Fraser is enthusiastic about the plans for the new centre, a
response to the high reputation of the university's theatre studies and
film and television departments which are attracting increasing numbers
of overseas students.
''This is an upfront way of saying that we're in the modern world.
Visions like this are what the university has to look at. Although the
old disciplines are very important, we need a new and imaginative
approach to what young people are going to need in the future.''
Her own sensitivity to the needs of young people were audible from
upstairs for as we spoke an undergraduate played the Steinway grand
which Lady Fraser's aunt had bought new in the 1920s, and which has just
been tuned, should Cooper feel the need for any practise at her lodgings
in Glasgow.
The student's access to the instrument is indicative of Lady Fraser's
sense of community with the university -- building the sense of
belonging at Gilmorehill has been Sir William's stated aim during his
time as principal. The couple came to the task with many advantages. A
week on Sunday their youngest grandchild will be baptised in the
university chapel, where they were married, having met as undergraduates
in 1951.
Lady Fraser is sure that today's students have a much more difficult
time than she did (''things were more hopeful then'') and is
characteristically self-deprecating about herself in those days,
although she served as president of the women's union.
''I could never have believed that I would come here as the
principal's wife when I was a silly little student.''
The university, one feels sure, will have cause to remember the
contribution of Lady Fraser for many years after she and Sir William
leave Professors' Square.

DUNCAN Ferguson should be top of Craig Brown's strike list when the
Scotland manager finally gets around to naming his team for the vital
European Championship qualifier against Russia in Moscow later this
month.
That is the view of someone who should know what he is talking about
-- Andy Gray, who himself played for Scotland 20 times and would have
almost doubled that tally but for injuries. He also was a hit with the
fans throughout a career with Dundee United, Aston Villa, Wolverhampton,
Everton, and Rangers.
Like Ferguson, Gray also quickly became a hero on Merseyside during
his spell at Goodison Park, during which he won league, cup, and
European honours, and he is not in the least surprised that Ferguson has
been such a smash-hit.
When he was Ron Atkinson's assistant manager at Aston Villa, Gray
recommended the 6ft 4in striker, who was then playing for Dundee United.
Brown has hinted that Hibernian's Darren Jackson will be in against
the Russians, but Gray, now working as a television pundit, said:
''Duncan is in the sort of form that would boost the Scottish side in
Moscow.''
But, even if Ferguson misses out on a Scotland recall, Gray reckons he
is on course for one extra-special award -- the freedom of at least half
of Merseyside. ''When I signed for Everton, the fans took to me right
away, just as they are going for Duncan in a big way,'' said Gray. ''He
is the sort of big, raw Scot who will excite them and they just love
centre forwards.''
Gray also believes the best thing the 23-year-old player did was to
leave Rangers for Everton. ''He has swopped two similar cities in moving
from Glasgow to Liverpool and I think that has helped him to settle so
quickly.
''But there isn't as much of the nonsense on Merseyside as there is
surrounding the Old Firm in Glasgow. I expected Duncan to do well, and
the best is yet to come, for he can still improve.''
Gray told of how impressed he had been with the teenage Ferguson in
his early days with Dundee United. ''I was assistant manager at Villa
and I told Ron Atkinson about him. We made a bid, but Jim McLean wanted
more and Villa wouldn't pay it.
''But now he has got the chance to make it big with a club where he
will be idolised, and in England he isn't the big fish in the small pool
he was at Ibrox, so that makes it easier for him.''

BRITISH Olympians do it, swimmers do it, and the Scottish women's
bowling team has struck gold with it. Mind games matter, and on Saturday
at Murrayfield, the Scottish rugby side which does battle with Wales
will have done it too.
Psychology is the name of the game. The power of positive thought is
the mantra which is sweeping late twentieth-century sport. Since
November the Scottish rugby side have added a new back-room boy to the
team which ministers to the players' well-being.
Dr Richard Cox, a psychology lecturer at Moray House College,
Edinburgh, is, out of college hours, an accredited sports psychologist
and a chartered psychologist with the British Psychological Society. He
is, too, a member of the British Association of Sports and Exercise
Sciences.
More pertinently he has, for the past few years, been working with the
British Olympic swimming team, goes to the US this summer with the
Olympic squad, and for five years has been closely associated with the
successful Scottish women's bowling team.
Since he became involved with the bowlers they have become British
champions and picked up gold medals at the Commonwealth and world
championships.
Bowling buffs call him the: ''shrink on the rink,'' a term which he
will not thank them for, careful as he is to delineate the differences
between the two mind sciences, psychology and psychiatry.
Cox began working with the Scottish rugby side at the invitation of
SRU director of rugby, Jim Telfer, before November's game against South
Africa. The Scots slumped to their ninth game without a win, so it was
not a particularly auspicious start. Since then, though, with three wins
on the trot, the results would appear to speak for themselves.
''What happens is that people think that a sports psychologist might
be a good idea,'' said Cox, ''especially when a team or an individual is
having a bad run. The vast majority of people who seek my services are
not doing well and so they come to someone like me in the hope that we
can turn things around.''
Cox chooses, first of all, to speak to the team as a whole. ''Speaking
to individuals at that stage is a bit threatening. People are generally
confused. Mention psychology and they think of psychiatry,'' he says.
Cox, a former wing-threequarter with Newcastle Northern, knew that the
Scottish side was going through a lean spell and he reckoned he could
help.
''What I try to do is to get players to focus on the things that they
can control themselves. For instance they can't control the result of
the game, winning if you like. But what they can control is their own
performance which would lead to that winning result.
''Players know that they have to do something to get into a winning
situation, but so often they lack the specific information that enables
them to achieve that. They know that they have to do something different
but they are not sure precisely what that something different should
be,'' he declares.
''I tell players that if each person takes 100% responsibility for
their role on the park and carries out that role successfully, then
nobody can ask more. But what is that role? So we go through all 15
positions and through the constituent parts of that position. I get the
players to say what the important parts of their position are.
''The over-riding question that I put to them is, if your peers, or
the press or the public, are judging your performance from the
touchline, as they will, then what is it that you want them to judge you
by?
''How do you want to be assessed, because you will be assessed,
everyone will assess you. So then we go through every position and
identify the criteria by which the players wish to be judged. We
pinpoint the individual roles that they want to improve, with the
long-term aim of providing the player with a personal performance focus
over which he has control.''
Cox is most involved before home games. He saw the team, and
individuals, before the matches against Canada and Ireland. There was
less time before the historic French trip for a full-scale session, and
he will be back with the side tomorrow before the game against Wales.
''In speaking to individuals you can get down to the specific
requirements of a particular position. For instance, forwards would say
that they become tired near the end of a game, which is natural, and
that they tend to lose concentration.
''We would then devise a strategy to help them overcome this. For
instance, they could make an association with a single word which would
be enough to trigger off the behaviour that they want. At the end of a
game, as a forward becomes tired, his body position becomes more
upright.
''The body needs to get more oxygen into the system and so it becomes
more upright to allow this to happen. That is a natural, biological
reaction. A forward has to drive in low and hard and so the word that
they should keep in their minds is 'low.' That is the one word which
should occupy their mind in the later stages of a game,'' he says.
Cox says that these crucial ''reminders'' can be physical as well.
''In one case a Scottish player is wearing a wrist bandage. That is a
visual reminder for the player to remember the specific skill that he
wants to be uppermost in his mind for the entire 80 minutes of a game.
''International rugby is a very emotional business. But emotional
exhortation taken to extremes can be counter-productive. When I was
playing we leapt up and down in the dressing room for 10 minutes before
a game. Goodness knows why.
''Maybe it was to frighten the opposition, who could hear you through
the dressing-room wall. Maybe it's understandable for prop forwards to
be banging heads off the wall, because they are going to be involved in
physical confrontation early on, but I was a winger and we weren't.
''If I didn't use my brain to get out of trouble and get into scoring
situations then I was doomed. In other words, if I switched off
intellectually and became an emotional animal like so many of the
players around me, then there was no way that I could function,'' says
Cox.
Sports psychology is gaining gradual acceptance across the sporting
spectrum. In addition to his work with the bowlers and the Olympians,
Cox is also helping out in premier division football in Scotland.
There is a reticence, though, in the football world to admit that
psychology might have a role to play. ''I do work in professional
football, but they don't like me talking about that. The people
concerned, in the main, don't think that the professional football game
is quite ready for sport sciences.''
There is no such reticence in rugby where, if Auld Nick himself could
provide succour to the national cause, then he would be recruited in
double quick time.

Kigali, Wednesday
THOUSANDS of decomposed corpses -- including opposition party leaders
-- have been unearthed in Rwandan mass graves, the latest ghoulish
evidence of last year's genocide, a senior government official said
today.
''This is the reality of Rwanda; graves with so many bodies we can
only only count the skulls,'' said the Rwanda army's chief political
commissar, Colonel Frank Mugambage.
Some 4500 skulls had been counted so far.
The colonel told Reuters the new graves, including that of Frederic
Nzamurambaho, leader of the Social Democratic Party, were first
discovered last Friday in the grounds of Kigali's central hospital
Workmen who went to the hospital on Friday to repair its drainage
system initially came across one mass grave but by today up to 20 graves
had been dug up, Mugambage added.
Nzamurambaho's decomposed body, its skull shattered, was discovered in
a hospital refrigerator buried on a vegetable plot near the main
hospital complex.
His son Raymond identified the body and told Reuters: ''I will give
him a dignified burial in a plot reserved for dead ministers.''
Alongside Nzamurambaho's body were those of his party's vice-president
and secretary-general.
The Social Democratic Party was a breakaway faction of the former
ruling party led by President Juvenal Habyarimana, whose killing in
April last year led to genocide by Hutu troops and militiamen. The party
was dominated by the Tutsi minority.
Between 500,000 and a million people, mainly Tutsis and moderate
Hutus, were massacred between April and July last year.
During the early days of the mass slaughter, thousands of bodies were
dumped at the hospital but they were removed by convicts and buried
outside the city after the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) army won a
three-month war in July.
A team of 65 Rwandans wearing long rubber gloves and equipped with
face masks have been working with hoes, forks and shovels since Friday.
The work is expected to continue for another week.
Every few minutes they unearth another cranium, another body wrapped
in a blanket.
The bodies will be given a state burial as part of a programme of mass
reburials launched by the United Nations Childrens Fund and the
government to help heal the nation's psychological wounds.

and a number of attackers were killed but no soldiers were hurt,

Lady Claire Macdonald, wife of
the Chief of the Clan Donald,
renowned hotelier and much-
admired cook, joins The Herald
on Saturday to give readers a
slice of the grace and flavour of
the Highlands. Lesley Duncan
meets the woman with more
fish to fry than most.
LADY Claire Macdonald's kitchen windows have a view far removed from
suburban garden or townscape. In the foreground, a lawn hemmed by lime
trees slopes down to a hidden, rocky shore. In the distance, the
white-icing mountains of Knoydart glitter in the winter sun beyond the
Sound of Sleat. Otters and seals sometimes disport themselves in the
quiet inlet of Loch na Dal which Kinloch Lodge overlooks. Golden eagles
haunt the hill behind the former shooting lodge -- now a hotel -- in
this secluded corner of southern Skye.
The setting suggests island calm, but of late all has been bustle,
inside and outside the lodge. Bulldozers have been tearing up brambles
and scrub rhododendron between lawn and loch for a garden. This will be
a memorial for Culloden (the 250th anniversary of which falls next year)
and mark the 25 years that Lady Claire's husband Godfrey has served as
high chief of Clan Donald.
Inside the lodge when I arrived, all was organised disorder, as
carpets and upholstery underwent a professional spring-clean before the
hotel reopens next week. Surrounded by damp but immaculate green
carpeting, upturned furniture, paintings, and a forlorn stag's head,
Claire Macdonald remained unflustered. Combining the role of wife of the
28th clan chief and eighth baron with those of hotelier and cookery
expert seems not to daunt her in the least. With her blonde hair, bright
blue eyes, and enviably white smile, she radiates energy and a warmth
which encompasses all around her -- family, assorted women assistants,
taxi drivers, this passing journalist, the two household whippets,
Buster and Tom.
The Macdonalds have been running Kinloch House, and feeding their
guests, for more than 22 years now. ''We just go on and on learning,''
says Claire Macdonald. She comes from Lancashire and, her commodore
father being in the Navy, travelled the world as a child. She thinks
Skye is ''a glorious place to live''.
She's a self-taught cook. Before her marriage she and a friend used to
cook for people. ''We managed to muddle along'' is how she puts it. Old
Cordon Bleu magazines provided a point of inspiration. She cooked a
little after marriage too, but ''proper cooking started when we came
here''. She and her husband had moved to Kinloch from Edinburgh when he
inherited his title and the attached financial problems. The hotel was
then in a dilapidated state -- in contrast to its present trig and
highly rated condition.
Claire Macdonald recalls these first days of catering as a nightmare.
''It was fine the first day or two but come days three, four, and five,
when I realised it was going to go on and on, I began to get quietly
desperate.''
Her solution was to get an old ledger and write in it 14 days of first
courses, main courses, and puddings, giving a choice of two at each
course. With the addition of soup, that has remained the pattern for her
menus.
''Soup is such a Scottish thing, you can vary it so enormously,'' she
enthuses. ''This is what is so exciting about cooking in Scotland. We've
the very best of ingredients in the world. But I don't think we should
be hampered by old Scots recipes. Many years ago when a Taste of
Scotland first started it fell down because it was stuck fast in the
rumbledy-thump and crannoch mould, whereas now it is an excellent
institution. I think food is the greatest draw to any place, or country,
or area.''
She has seen a revolution in the availability of fresh materials for
cooking. ''When we first started I don't think you could buy a fresh
tomato down in Ardvasar. You could hardly buy one in a tin! The hardest
thing of all to get delivered was fresh fruit and veg. The only fish
used in these days was salmon.''
I mention that a friend had recently used a recipe for monkfish from
one of her books. ''Did she enjoy it?'' Yes. ''Oh great,'' says Lady
Macdonald, ''I'd never heard of monkfish 20 years ago!''
She has long remedied any such gaps in her piscine knowledge and is
indeed writing about fish for her first column today. ''The best fish in
the world comes from Scotland,'' she maintains. ''It's sought after by
people all over the world.''
Its only drawback, she says, is that all too often people in Scotland
equate fish with haddock -- ''usually shrouded in breadcrumbs and
batter''. She's not a haddock aficionado. ''I think haddock smoked is
delicious but haddock when it isn't smoked is a very dreary fish in
comparison to something like cod.'' A controversial statement in these
northern parts. She also thinks plaice has a better flavour than lemon
sole.
She's not just an advocate of fish, but of shellfish -- and of course
game and meat. She gets all these locally. Her butcher buys his meat
from the Dingwall slaughter-house and it's ''just excellent''. Game
comes from Inverness; venison ''from the hill behind the house''. A
network of Scottish suppliers covers her range of raw materials from
oysters to herbs.
She likes to use seasonal ingredients in her recipes and laments that
to make a strawberry and orange terrine at a demonstration soon she will
probably have to buy Israeli strawberries.
The need to feed hotel guests encourages her to develop new recipes.
Does she also experiment on her family? ''My goodness, yes I do, and
aren't they honest too!'' Two of her four children (three daughters and
a son) love kidneys and liver; the other two hate them. Kidneys are such
a good convenience food, she thinks. Which leads her to contemplate a
piece on student eating for September.
Back to her own brood. ''The sad thing is they don't like puddings.
The younger two like sorbets. I want them to have good vanilla homemade
ice-cream with fudge sauce. I have to watch it otherwise I end up making
those sorts of things for myself!'' The lady confesses to having to rush
with empty bowls to the sink to resist the temptation of licking them
out.
Expertise can have its price. She says rather wistfully: ''If you
write about food people say 'I'm so scared of having you'. But anything
cooked by anyone else is such a treat.'' She loves baked beans and toast
and Marmite. ''Writing about food doesn't make you a sort of
intellectual eater.''
As she points out, a brilliant gourmet meal in the wrong company is
''often far less fun than a plate of pasta and a bottle of wine and
salad with friends -- providing the pasta's well cooked and it's got a
good sauce!''
Of her own cookery Claire Macdonald says: ''It's a simple style
because the ingredients are what matter most.'' Nor is she ''given
over'' to sauces. If she buys a chicken she likes it to be ''a
free-range one that's scratched around a yard somewhere, not something
that's never put a claw to the ground, poor animal.''
She'll perhaps write about veal soon. ''It's never been a British
meat, but we're going to have to eat more veal to prevent it going to
mainland Europe.'' She adds with inescapable logic that ''cows have got
to go on having calves to produce the milk to make the dairy products
that we need''.
She has to cater for a lot of people who don't for some reason or
another eat meat. That's fine with her. ''You can make utterly delicious
meatless food.'' But she does recall her first taste of ''militant
vegetarianism''.
She compares the soldiers in that cause with the London chefs who come
and swear at you when you ask for salt. If you ''want to pour tomato
ketchup over everything they've cooked, you're entitled if you're paying
for it!''
Her first cookery book, Seasonal Cooking, was published in 1983 and
she managed one year to write two, Delicious Fish and The Harrod's Book
of Entertaining (''I don't know how I did it but I did''). She also
gives cookery demonstrations, in her own hotel at the beginning and end
of the season and as far afield as Lincolnshire and County Durham.
The recipes she is going to share with readers in the next few weeks
include hot-cross buns and a lemony cake for Easter celebrations. Though
bunnies sometimes cavort on the lawn at Kinloch they are unlikely to
figure endearingly on the decorations.
Meanwhile, I caught a glimpse of the master cook in action in her own
kitchen with its decorative tiles of fat pink-and-black saddleback pigs.
I felt a bit of a pig too when, invited, I stuck a finger in the excess
mix for chocolate mousse. It was delicious raw and, later, baked.
* In Weekender on Saturday, Lady Claire Macdonald serves up fish with
a frisson.

Playwright Iain Heggie makes a robust response to an article last
month by Sara Villiers which asked what had happened to Scotland's
playwrights
ACTORS, playwrights, directors, actor-playwrights,
playwright-directors, designers, designer-directors, novelists whose
work is adapted for the stage, all have more in common than they have
separating them. They are in short or long term involved in making
theatre. There's a tedious odour of journalistic opportunism about Sara
Villiers's article. Playwrights in the red corner, novelists in the blue
corner. That'll make a story. Away we go.
It is true that novels have some advantages for some directors. The
novelist is either dead or arguably ignorant of how the theatre works.
The director who prefers authority to collaboration can play
know-it-all. There are directors who need collaboration to be at their
best. The Scottish rush-rush assembly line production system makes it
very hard for them to survive.
I would like to hear from A L Kennedy's own mouth what happened with
her adaptation of Salman Rushdie's Haroun and the Sea of Stories. The
only thing that could be gleaned from Sara Villiers's under-researched
article is the well-worn director's and journalist's cliche about
writers: preciousness. Kennedy didn't like them tinkering with her
words. Show me a Scottish theatre company curious and sorrowful about a
displeased writer. Defensive dismissiveness is the norm. I would be very
surprised if the private reaction of most novelists to seeing their work
on a Scottish stage isn't somewhere between clueless ambivalence and
outrage.
Novel adaptations are best undertaken by highly-skilled, dedicated
ensemble theatre companies who don't underestimate the scale of the
task. There is no such company in Scotland. Certainly experienced
Scottish playwrights are, to my knowledge, seriously wary about having
their work done by any Scottish theatre company in the present set-up.
Scotland, as John Clifford rightly noted last year, could be producing
world-class theatre. Fat chance.
When you walk into a Scottish theatre company, what do you see? A room
full of administrators of various sorts, one of whom is occasionally
allowed to direct plays. They sit round working out what play to do
next, who to cast, and articulating their ''artistic policy'' to send to
the newspapers and the funding bodies. When the decisions are being made
actors (and playwrights), with all their knowledge and experience, are
nowhere in sight. A tiny proportion of the money we give to the theatre
every year goes into actors in rehearsal. Do the funders know what they
are spending our money on? Glasgow and Edinburgh host two of the largest
theatre festivals in the world, yet between them they employ not one
solitary full-time actor.
We've had the rest of the world coming and showing us how to make
theatre for years now. But we stubbornly refuse to learn. We persevere
with a fragmented, administrator-heavy theatre company structure, short,
over-intensive rehearsal and performance periods, ad hoc casting,
inflexible scheduling, too many productions, hugely talented but
dubiously trained and disenfranchised actors, wholly untrained
directors, and yes, of course, impractical, home-loving playwrights.
These factors taken together explain why so many Scottish theatre
performances seem tense, forced, and synthetic. Just like Dutch
tomatoes. They also explain why Scottish theatre companies have wrecked
so many perfectly promising new plays. In a fragmented structure lessons
are learned very slowly. Young companies and young directors and
inexperienced writers are making exactly the same mistakes that were
being made when I first came back to Scotland seven years ago.
Commissioning too late, insufficient testing and development work,
exposing too soon, and scheduling too inflexibly. Experienced directors
seem to have learned the lessons. But their hands are tied in our
restricting system. The kind of teamwork and genuinely creative theatre
that can only come from permanent companies where everyone works
together all year round is nowhere in sight.
Adapting novels for the stage successfully is extremely difficult to
do well. Scottish theatre companies get round that problem the same way
they get round every other problem: by not bothering to insist that it
is done well. The ''success'' of recent adaptations has really been
about the audience being able to make, for once, confident assumptions
about a night at the theatre. No matter what they do to it, something of
the beloved original will surely remain. Successful novels (or films)
are attractive to theatre companies because they offer a priceless
commodity: a pre-existing publicity hook.
What new plays need is to be introduced to the company's repertoire
very gradually. The writing, the performing, the relationship with the
audience, and the public profile developing hand in hand. This is a
facility no Scottish theatre company can offer. Also many directors are
ignorant of and ambivalent about dramatic structure. They like the
''freedom'' of fiddling with bits of ''writing'' from a novel and
calling it an ''adaptation''. Because the end result isn't like a play
they can pretend they are up at the frontiers of creativity.
Since it is not possible to earn a living from serious theatre writing
in Scotland, there is really no such thing as a full-time theatre
playwright here. The relative technical inflexibility of the theatre
play compared to the screenplay, the radio play, and the novel makes its
disciplines much more exacting. No Scottish playwright I know is in a
position to give the medium the total dedication it demands.
In writing plays for Scottish theatres two things are going to happen
to you. One, you're going to get poor. Two, you're going to get
miserable watching your work being destroyed. Small wonder Scottish
playwrights aren't finishing their plays. Even if they had the time, who
would want to? The real miracle is that any performable theatre plays
get written and submitted at all.
Comparisons with the novel are therefore meaningless. The contemporary
Scottish novel? It's a doddle by comparison. The novelists don't have to
spend the whole writing period fretting about how to wring remotely
tolerable work out of a hard-pressed theatre company.
What am I saying? Apparently the novelists are all queueing up. That's
why I didn't like Sara Villiers's article. (There's always a personal
motive.) It depressed me. Even the novel I am now writing isn't, after
all, necessarily free from the disreputable advances of Scottish
theatre.
If, for argument's sake, the contemporary Scottish novelists are
investing unblinkered optimism in Scottish theatre in its present form I
can only echo my old mother's words: hell mend them.

Southampton 2, Tottenham 6
After extra time. 90min: 2-2
RONNY Rosenthal completed a magnificent hat trick and an astonishing
FA Cup comeback by Tottenham in extra time at the Dell last night to set
up a quarter-final return to his old club, Liverpool.
Southampton looked home and dry at 2-0 up when the 31-year-old
Israeli, who had scored just one goal all season, was sent on in the
forty-third minute.
But he slammed home two goals inside two second-half minutes, the
second a thunderbolt from nowhere, and then turned a Titanic clash in
the eleventh minute of extra-time.
Bruce Grobbelaar was completely deceived as Rosenthal, picking play up
from David Howells, let fly again from 25 yards, the ball swerving
wickedly inside the post and into the Southampton keeper's top
right-hand corner.
Jurgen Klinsmann set up Teddy Sheringham, Nick Barmby ran in a solo
goal, and Darren Anderton supplied the coup de grace in the last minute
as Spurs turned this fifth-round replay into a rout.
Alan Ball's men had given fate a run for its money. But Tottenham have
been convinced their name has been on the FA Cup since the FA were
forced to readmit them in December.
Southampton looked in too determined a mood for Spurs when they took a
sixth-minute lead with Neil Shipperley's first home goal since his
#1.25m move from Chelsea.
Stuart Nethercott dithered when Jason Dodd cut in front of him on to
Jim Magilton's angled pass. A low ball gave Shipperley a simple
right-foot steering job from a couple of yards in front of goal.
Southampton then added what looked like the killer just before the
break from spot-kick king Matthew le Tissier.
When Dean Austin clipped the ankles of Neil Heaney, the England star
stepped up to dispatch his thirty-fifth successful penalty conversion
out of 36, and his seventh of the season.
It looked all over. But a substitution that smacked of desperation
turned to inspiration for manager Gerry Francis when he hauled off
Nethercottand pushed on Rosenthal.
* CRYSTAL Palace were just two minutes away from a penalty shoot-out
with Watford in their FA Cup replay before George Ndah sealed a 1-0
victory at Selhurst Park victory and earned them a home quarter-final
against Wolves.
* REVISED draw for the FA Cup sixth round: Liverpool v Tottenham
Hotspur, Crystal Palace v Wolverhampton Wanderers, Manchester United v
Queen's Park Rangers, Everton v Newcastle United.

Mexico City, Wednesday
MEXICO plunged deeper into political crisis today as the chief
prosecutor appeared to link former president Carlos Salinas to last
year's murder of ruling party leader Francisco Ruiz Massieu.
Prosecutor Pablo Chapa Bezanilla said the crime was motivated by
''interests'' of both Salinas and his brother Raul, who was arrested
yesterday in connection with the killing.
Carlos Salinas immediately denied the allegation, calling it
''absurd''.
Chapa had dropped a political bombshell with the arrest of Raul
Salinas, the older brother of the ex-president, on charges he
masterminded the September 28 killing of Ruiz Massieu.
But he stepped into uncharted territory today, saying in a radio
interview the motive for the crime appeared to have been both personal
and political.
''(Ruiz Massieu) could have got in the way of some projects . . . of
the Salinista project,'' he told Radio Red. ''He could have got in the
way of certain interests.''
He gave no details of what those interests may have been, describing
them only as ''Salinista''. Asked if he meant the interests of both Raul
and Carlos Salinas, he replied: ''That's right.''
Former president Carlos Salinas, who left office on December 1,
telephoned the radio within minutes, telling an interviewer: ''The
suggested motive seems absurd to me.''
''(Ruiz Massieu) was a moderniser within the modernisation programme
which I encouraged,'' Salinas said. He reiterated his belief that his
brother is innocent.
The Attorney General's office later issued a terse statement saying
the motive of the crime has not been determined. ''It is important to
state that it will be known at the end of the respective legal
process,'' the statement said.
Chapa said yesterday that Raul Salinas, a powerful figure in business
and political circles, had ''without any doubt'' masterminded the murder
of Ruiz Massieu, secretary-general of the long-ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI).
The arrest, which had the clear backing of President Ernesto Zedillo,
broke one of the strongest unwritten rules of the Mexican political
system, which bars incoming presidents from attacking their
predecessors.
In another twist, Chapa said the dead man's brother, Mario Ruiz
Massieu, who headed the investigation of the assassination during the
Salinas administration, appeared to have withheld evidence by removing
references to Raul Salinas from official investigation documents.
There was no immediate comment from Mario Ruiz Massieu, who could face
criminal charges if the allegation is true.
Political commentators said today that Zedillo had unleashed a virtual
political revolution in Mexico by arresting Raul Salinas, 48. Some were
not sure whether he could control it.
Zedillo ''is a legal puritan and is profoundly ignorant of the Mexican
political system'', commentator Raymundo Riva Palacio wrote in Reforma
newspaper. ''That is to say he is the perfect combination to push
through changes.''
''We will just have to wait, and not for long, to find out if he
really knows what he is doing and, more importantly, if he has the
strength to manage the unarmed political revolution he has unleashed,''
he added.
The political firestorm sparked by the arrest came as Mexico battled
to overcome an unrelenting economic crisis sparked by the devaluation of
the peso last December 20.

Pretoria, Wenesday
WINNIE Mandela's Cabinet career appeared to be at an end tonight after
police raided her luxury Soweto home in connection with a massive fraud.
Lawyers prevented police from removing documents from her redbrick
mansion pending a Supreme Court decision on a bid to prevent the search.
But senior sources in the ruling African National Congress said she
would be fired from the government anyway.
Mrs Mandela, in the Ivory Coast on a West African tour she had been
ordered to cancel, said in a statement she was ''astounded and
unspeakably angry'' over the corruption allegations and vowed she would
survive this latest crisis to engulf her.
But sources said today that President Mandela had decided to sack his
troublesome estranged wife after being briefed on the allegations
against her 10 days ago.
''In the President's mind she is no longer in government. She will be
fired as soon as she gets back,'' a senior government source said.
Tonight 61-year-old Mrs Mandela was heading home from her tour of
Ghana, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast -- a journey her husband had told
her not to go on.
''That was why he told her to cancel the trip. He knew he had to
implement the decision,'' an ANC source said.
Armed police surrounded her home early today and raided the
Johannesburg offices of her Coordinated Anti-Poverty Programme.
Police spokesman Captain Dave Harrington said the raids were carried
out after police received information Mrs Mandela used her position and
influence to win low-cost housing contracts for a firm in which she had
financial interests.
A government source said associates of Mrs Mandela could face more
wide-ranging charges, which could severely damage the image of the ANC.
Uniformed police with automatic rifles were stationed around the high
walls of her home in Orlando West, on the outskirts of the sprawling
Soweto township near Johannesburg.

Moscow, Wednesday
RUSSIAN Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said today the army should
easily be able to capture the remaining three rebel strongholds in
Chechnya, Interfax news agency reported.
Grachev, heavily criticised for a series of blunders during the
12-week campaign to crush the region's independence bid, told Interfax
he was not expecting much resistance in the towns of Argun, Shali and
Gudermes to the east of the capital Grozny.
''Firstly, these towns are significantly smaller than the Chechen
capital,'' Grachev said.
''Secondly, the Chechen units defending them are much less
well-equipped than the defenders in Grozny and thirdly, 90% of their
armour has either been destroyed or seized by federal troops,'' he said.
Grachev said the armed forces would rely on different tactics from the
ones used during the storming of Grozny, which was largely destroyed in
weeks of savage fighting.--Reuter.

IN his parliamentary defence of the just published British Gas results
for 1994, the Prime Minister pointed out that large business profits
produced large corporation tax bills. I assume he was claiming this was
a good thing, for which we should all be grateful.
Let me, however, give a different interpretation. British Gas prices
are too high. The Treasury takes a hefty slice of the resultant gigantic
profit.
In other words the Government has found yet another means of
increasing indirect taxation -- especially on those domestic consumers
whose fuel bills form a disproportionately large part of their living
costs.
I mean, of course, the very poorest in society. It is they, not the
shareholders in British Gas, who in reality foot the bill for the
corporation tax.
Few of us who applauded the Government's failure to introduce the
second stage of VAT on domestic fuel can have anticipated it would so
quickly find a way, effectively, to increase fuel taxes regardless.

WHY aren't questions being asked as to why the nationalised concerns
didn't make the same profits then as they now make as privatised
concerns? Did the Government handicap them?
Why was it not possible to provide all the telephones that were wanted
then when BT can now supply anything?
When the same executives are still in place, getting their exorbitant
rewards, should we ask if they had a change of heart about success
because of these personal riches?
Are tax-payers having to provide dole money for ex-British Gas or BT
employees?
Rather than subsidising services which most people need, are we having
to subsidise the profit seekers and also all those given the boot?
How much does unemployment cost each week?
One wonders if John Major is serving the people of the United Kingdom
or just the few whose only wish is for more and more profit?

MISTAKES may have been made about the Ayrshire children whose return
home has been ordered by the Court of Session (February 28). The current
situation, however, presents a dilemma that cannot be resolved merely by
reversing a decision.
The clock cannot be turned back for the children. Decisions taken now
must be based on their welfare as the paramount consideration. The
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that, if
the children have views on what should happen, these must be listened to
and taken into consideration.
We must ensure that, in our eagerness to ''put things right'', we do
not compound the tragedy.

THE report of the Scottish Council for Independent Care on community
care has hit the nail on the head (February 25).
Though some local authorities are working well with the private sector
there are many others who seem determined to freeze out private care for
ideological reasons.
Though their public statements suggest that they support private care
they have a two-faced attitude. Often community care plans hardly
mention the private sector, though it is the major provider of care, and
inspection guidelines and community care contracts often contain rules
that have one objective -- the artificial elevation of cost.
The real losers are Scotland's elderly, who are being denied the right
to choose private care. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many heavy
nursing cases are being placed in local authority residential homes
rather than private nursing homes.
This is technically illegal, since residential nursing care can only
be provided in a registered nursing home or hospital.
The local authorities have blamed the Government for underfunding
community care but if cash really is short then why are vast sums of
public money (up to #60,000 per client per year) being used to keep
people at home when the same amount would pay for five people to go into
private residential homes?
If homes have to close, why should it be the private homes costing
#230 per week and not the local authority homes, which can cost up to
#440 a week?
Some local authorities are kicking sand in the face of the Government.
They are putting politics before people. Firm action is required to
bring them in line now.

MR McNEILL should produce some of his ''real evidence'' that NHS
trusts are improving patient services (February 22). Given the fact that
these trusts have come into being fairly recently, there are few
researchers worthy of the name who would be prepared at present to
pronounce one way or the other.
One upheaval which we certainly don't want to repeat is the one in
services for the elderly -- at one time the top priority in Scotland --
which has taken place in the nineties.
In England the Minister has conceded that a disgraceful episode in the
care of the elderly has occurred in the south because hospital trusts
ran out of money. We also know from Professor Marshall at Stirling
University that the Takare homes, which have mushroomed in the West of
Scotland, are profoundly ''disabling'' institutions in so far as care of
the elderly is concerned.
Mr McNeill may be able to assure us that in his neck of the woods
continuing care beds have survived unscathed. That is certainly not the
position elsewhere in Scotland.
The NHS reforms have been an upheaval because, with the marks of a now
discredited Thatcherism all over them, they inflicted the pain of market
forces on a value-based public service.
Relieving pain is a very different process from inflicting pain. The
sooner we begin to reverse present trends and get back on course the
better it will be for all of us.

THE report on the Waverley must have created credibility problems with
many of your readers who surely cannot believe that the agency
responsible for development in Glasgow cannot get agreement from the
SECC company to enable necessary work on Bell's Bridge to allow the
Waverley paddle steamer downstream in time to complete her refit, thus
placing the whole Waverley Trust at risk of bankruptcy (February 25).
I understand the SECC is effectively controlled by its majority
shareholders, Strathclyde Regional Council and Glasgow City Council,
which presumably support the SECC chief executive in his desire to have
Bell's Bridge removed.
In your article on the competing development proposals for the garden
festival site (February 22) Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of GDA, is
quoted as saying, ''I think the people behind the festival gardens
project are being very dishonest and unfair to the people of Glasgow.
They are promising something that is a chimera. It is not deliverable.''
He is also quoted as saying of the Miller Development Company's
Pacific Quay proposals, ''We have developers who are ready to deliver
it. It's real.''
Does this mean that during Glasgow's Year of Architecture and Design,
1999, the Pacific Quay will have every building shown on the planning
application complete and occupied; 2000 new jobs filled; and that
Glasgow will be able to enjoy, during that festival year, the Millennium
Tower, Scottish Science Centre, Imax, and multiplex cinemas, and other
enticing public goodies? Will such a target be met?
Is the poor Waverley Trust the meat in the sandwich in the dispute as
to how the old garden festival site is to be developed? Whatever the
reason, it is disgraceful.

IT is entirely wrong that the future of the PS Waverley should be put
in jeopardy by the intransigence of the SECC management in failing to
face up to its responsibilities.
The Waverley Steam Navigation Company would be fully entitled to sue
those responsible for the bridge for loss of earnings due to their
inaction in carrying out repairs.
In this age of high technology it is surely possible for Bell's Bridge
to be cleared of whatever is preventing it from being turned to open the
channel, or is it a case of lack of the willing mind on the part of the
SECC?

The medical care administered to our little boy was of the highest

dealt with us made the whole event seem less traumatic.
There were moments when we thought the worst about our son's condition

HOW dare Councillor Allan Steele suggest the Conservatives cease to
use the Union flag (February 24). If commitment to the United Kingdom is
to be the criterion for being allowed to use the flag then the Tory
Party is the only party with that right.
We have Labour hell-bent on breaking up the United Kingdom with talk
of parliamentary assemblies not only for Scotland but for the English
regions and Wales. The Scot Nats want independence, and the Liberals
also want a Scottish parliament.
We Conservatives are proud of the Union flag. It is after all the flag
of the United Kingdom but then Labour is always talking down the
achievements of this country.
What flag will Labour use if it achieves its aim of a fragmented
Britain? The red flag of communism which it dropped in favour of a red
rose, or the pirate skull and crossbones, a warning to Britain that
Labour will plunder your earnings and ruin your standard of living.
I suggest only the Tories are a patriotic party, the only party fit to
govern this great country of ours. The rest want to sell it and Scotland
down the river.

YOU don't have to rush for a prescription for minor ailments. An
increasing number of people are turning to natural remedies for a whole
range of ailments from sunburn, insomnia, dandruff, and the common cold
to migraine. The problem is finding out the best way to harness nature's
resources.
However Belinda Grant Viagas has just written a useful book, Natural
Remedies for Common Complaints (Piatkus Books, #8.99 paperback), which
looks at the underlying causes of the complaints and at suitable herbal,
or natural solutions, many of which have been used for thousands of
years. One way to help ease chronic pain, such as arthritis, is to have
a groaning session, says Viagas. ''Take a deep breath and go for it,''
she advises. Just make certain you are out of earshot of your
neighbours.
* GETTING young people to realise they have a mental health problem
that cannot be solved by them alone is difficult. Yet many experience
symptoms of a mental illness for the first time between the ages of 16
and 25.
Now a new leaflet made by young people for young people on behalf of
Glasgow Student Mental Health was launched yesterday at the Art Gallery
and Museum, Kelvingrove in conjunction with the Out of Mind, Out of
Sight exhibition.
Cath Bailey, a research psychologist at Strathclyde University who
helped write the leaflet, says: ''If you become ill, just having a chat
with a student counsellor isn't enough, you urgently need information
and access to treatment. Better still, people should know about mental
health before it affects them personally.''
The leaflet gives facts about mental illness, its causes, and various
methods of controlling illnesses. It also explains how psychiatrists,
psychologists, and self-help groups can help -- and provides useful
local addresses and telephone numbers.
* THE special needs of elderly people in care who are partially
sighted is a neglected area despite the fact that there are over 200,000
aged over 75 years in this category.
Often they are in homes without staff trained to understand their
requirements. In a bid to improve the training of carers, the Royal
National Institute for the Blind has launched a comprehensive training
package for care and Nursing Staff working with older, visually impaired
people in residential accommodation.
Called ''New Independence'', it is divided into six modules and seeks
to raise awareness of the nature of visual impairment and covers such
topics as ''Vision and Ageing'' and ''Changing the Environment''. This
material can be used by individual staff for self-directed study or in
groups with a facilitator. Further details from the Royal National
Insitute for the Blind, 224 Great Portland Street, London, W1N 6AA.
Phone: 071-636 1153.
* A NEW natural throat spray claims also to alleviate summer insect
stings and even sunburn. Called Propex, it is a natural antibiotic made
by bees from the buds and bark of specific plants and trees.
Bees line their hives with propolis to protect the inhabitants from
bacterial and viral infection. This substance was known to the Ancient
Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans and used for thousands of years. Propex is
now available from health food stores for #4.85.
* TWO new guides for menopausal women have been produced by the
medical charity, Amarant Trust. One deals with premature menopause,
before the age of 40, and the other motherhood and the menopause. Copies
of these leaflets can be obtained by sending a SAE to the Amarant Trust,
56-60 St John Street, London, EC1M 4DT.
* KEEPING the house warm, at around 21 degrees C, can reduce the risk
of a heart attack. Deaths in most countries, including Britain, are 10%
to 25% higher in winter compared with the rest of the year, says a
report in Monitor Weekly, the doctor's magazine.
Now Dr Kay-Tee Khaw from the Clinical Gerontology Unit at
Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, says the key to reducing the
increased number of deaths from heart attacks in winter is to raise the
room temperature. Social and economic policies that support
energy-efficient housing and central heating are good for health, he
concludes.
* THERE'S growing evidence that an aspirin a day reduces the risk of
stroke by as much as one third in high-risk patients. If you want to
find out more the Stroke Association issue free leaflets, Aspirin and
Stroke. For a free copy ring 071-490 7999.
* A DISTURBING report in the British Medical Journal suggests that a
patient who goes to a GP with a self diagnosis of ME is less likely to
be accepted on the doctor's list. The report, from Edinburgh University
Department of Pyschology, says GPs fear such patients are less likely to
accept treatment, will pose problems, and will take up a lot of time.

CAN anyone please explain why it is possible to raise #1m for the
restoration of a dilapidated, disused railway viaduct (February 23) but
not possible to pay for upgrading the west coast rail route, maintaining
the Forth Bridge properly, continuing to operate the Fort William
sleeper service, or building a rail bridge across the Dornoch Firth?

IT is with some interest that I have been reading your recent coverage
of the unveiling by the Government of its proposals for the future
administrtion of Northern Ireland.
Robbie Dinwoodie quite properly draws attention to the supreme irony
of a Prime Minister who on the one hand exhorts the people of Northern
Ireland to embrace legislative and executive devolution while at the
same time urges the people of Scotland to disavow such constitutional
arrangements as injurious to the Union which he purports to defend
(February 24).
From Mr Lang's reference to the ''glorified town council'' being set
up at Stormont, it is clear that the Secretary of State for Scotland was
either ill advised on the Government's intentions for Northern Ireland
or he was being economical with the truth in his response to the
widespread feeling in Scotland that constitutional reform is overdue.
While there are differences between the constituent parts of the
United Kingdom, the similarities between Northern Ireland and Scotland
scarcely need to be pointed out. Rather than being an alien political
environment, Northern Ireland is part of a political continuum that
embraces the whole of the United Kingdom.
There are parts of Northern Ireland where the Conservative Party is
represented on district councils, and parts of England, Scotland, and
Wales where it is not. There are districts in Northern Ireland where
nationalists do not even bother to contest elections, and districts in
Scotland and Wales where nationalists have the upper hand.
Ultimately what seems to unite Northern Ireland and Scotland more than
anything else is the determination of John Major's Government to ignore
the wishes of their peoples.
It is in the context of years of duplicity on the part of the Northern
Ireland Office that Ulster Unionists read the present Framework
Document. The Ulster Unionist Party has commanded widespread electoral
support throughout Northern Ireland for the 75 years of the province's
existence and has never believed in indulging political astrologers in
preference to dealing with political realities.
The Framework Document is unworthy of the people of Northern Ireland
in that it offers only proposals that have been rejected spectacularly
in the past. The Downing Street Declaration of 1993 seemed to be a
genuine departure from the cliches of the past, yet the agenda set by
the Framework Document is one which implies the nationalist outcome
rejected time without number by a very substantial majority of the
Northern Ireland electorate.
But in dismissing the document, Ulster Unionists are determined to
clear the way for administration which can command the consent of
Northern Ireland's people.
Just as the Major Government has found it convenient to misjudge
Scottish opinion on the future administration of Scotland, and will not
be allowed by its people to get away with it, so it has chosen to
underestimate Northern Ireland's capacity to insist upon institutions of
government which command the respect and allegiance of its people and to
reject an agenda which places a premium on the views of the Government
of the Irish republic, which, conversely, is entirely without a mandate
in Northern Ireland.
Councillor F E Crowe,
Ulster Unionist Group Leader, Craigavon Borough Council,

CARE in the community is a phrase which pushes all the right emotional
buttons. To care is undoubtedly good, and to care in the community in
which most people have lived and in which they function best is doubly
good. Thus far everyone is in agreement. Yet care in any community, be
it for those with psychiatric difficulties or for the frail and
vulnerable elderly, can only work if it is properly organised and
sufficiently funded. On those last two points the version of care in the
community under which we struggle at the moment is utterly insufficient.
This was illustrated, though he will be appalled to hear it, by Scottish
Health Minister Lord Fraser when he made his first appearance at the
Scottish Grand Committee yesterday. Though he rarely raised the level of
his contribution above the languid, Lord Fraser's words appeared to
acknowledge deficiencies. He agrees that the English version of the
policy has got slightly out of kilter, though this is a whopping
understatement. In Scotland we will not repeat those errors because we
will go more slowly if necessary, he insisted. Yet the launch of care in
the community took place two years ago, and even Lord Fraser is forced
to admit that much must still be done to make it fully effective.
The core of the problem lies in the Treasury-driven nature of the
Government's approach to all of its reforms. Even those which are based
in sensible thinking, like the basic theory of care in the community,
cannot function because proper funding is absent. Lord Fraser will think
this unfair, especially as he announced an extra #4m for the care of the
mentally ill in the community, but this will still only take the total
available funding for the current year to #18m; in the context of
continued proposals to close hospitals this is nowhere near enough.
Other problems present themselves. Those critics who say that the
concept of NHS care from the cradle to the grave has been removed are
correct. Old folk, who hoped to pass on their savings or assets to their
children, are forced by Government diktat to use their assets to pay for
their own upkeep in expensive residential or nursing homes. The line
between treatment of the elderly and the care of the elderly is, indeed,
one which must be drawn in the interests of the efficient functioning of
hospitals. Too often it is drawn on the side of forcing those who may
need hospital care into private residential or nursing care.
Then there are the carers, on whose behalf we should feel righteous
anger. The British Medical Association's community care committee spoke
eloquently yesterday about selfish attitudes and the lack of care for
the carers who are the unpaid, often unseen, and rarely lauded army of
men and women who look after the sick, the disabled, and the elderly.
The ageing of the population means that more and more elderly people
must choose between a nursing home or being cared for by a relative. The
strain imposed on carers, who too often struggle on without monetary or
practical support, can be immense. Nor are they a small group. Some
700,000 Scots are carers, and for more than 150,000 of them it is a
full-time duty. Dutiful sons, daughter, and neighbours save the State a
great deal of money. If these heroic people break down (and many of them
seem near this point) the State will have an enormous bill to pay.
Carers should be helped much more, both financially and in practical
ways. Government ideologues won't like it, but common sense and ideology
were never close partners.

SOCIETY needs watchdogs. There is nothing wrong with having a
whistle-blower, everything wrong with having censors. The Broadcasting
Standards Council's study, published today, about violence, sexual
activity, and bad language on television during 1994, is a welcome blast
on the whistle. Times and standards change. The problem with television
is that if we sit back and take as permissible what the broadcasters
decree we risk ending up victims of the ratings game. Robert Redford's
film Quiz Show is not about violence or sex on television, but about
game show contestants lying for the sake of high ratings and the
responsibilities to society that programme makers, sponsors, and channel
owners must shoulder. Television stations and programmes compete for
audiences, just as newspapers do for readers. The danger is that should
excess pull in an audience it will be considered justified financially
in today's cutthroat world of proliferating channels. Stuart Cosgrove's
defence today of Channel 4's Red Light Zone series is impressive. Part
of Channel 4's remit, fulfilled honourably, is to extend the frontiers
of television, but there is just a hint of special pleading.
Broadcasters can set a programme's agenda; they cannot set the viewer's
agenda. The series may well prove illuminating to many, and dispel
damaging ignorance among some, but others will react in baser ways.
Channel 4 has not discovered a new formula. The combination of
erudition and eroticism has long been used by magazines like Playboy to
lend respectability to their semi-pornographic centrefolds. Red Light
Zone goes out late at night, but the nine o'clock watershed, a
palliative at best, was never going to work in practice. EastEnders and
Brookside regularly tackle topics that breach the nine o'clock barrier,
programme makers arguing that the issues are ones families should
confront and that soap operas provide the ideal platform. The important
thing is the audience's expectations are not confounded. What is
permissible on Brookside is outrageous on Coronation Street. Viewers
hate being taken unawares. Forewarned, they accept levels of violence,
sexual activity, and bad language on television which would otherwise
cause at the least concern, at most outrage. The acceptable level of
violence shown on the news, for instance, is higher than that for a
fictional programme. As for parents who get upset about what their
children see, there is such a thing as parental responsibility. Against
that, however, one must put the fact that this is the age of the
multi-set household. This requires a high level of social responsibility
from television.
Today's report, the third carried out by the BSC, is a snapshot view
of British television. Establishing trends requires time. The findings,
based on two two-week periods in May and September, could, as has
happened before, be affected by the language, sex, or violence content
of one programme. That does not detract from the value of the BSC's
statutory role as the viewers' whistle-blower, a body programme makers,
planners, and channel owners, like Rupert Murdoch, should heed. We do
not, however, need the services of a small-screen Doctor Bowdler.

IT is not only Clause 4 which the Labour Party is jettisoning. When
the comrades convene in London on April 29 to debate whether capitalism
is a good or bad thing, another long and proud tradition will have been
abandoned.
It is the pooled fares system whereby travelling expenses are paid
equally and not according to geographical location. An average national
fare to the conference venue is calculated. Each delegate pays this
average fare into the pool and the funds are used to pay the train fares
of each delegate regardless of distance.
With the pooled fares system scrapped by the leadership there will be
no financial assistance for delegates from Scotland and the far north.
Where, just by chance, much of the opposition is to be found to Tony
Blair's plans to scrap the venerable institution of Clause 4.
Just me and
my shadow
ALLAN STEWART, the Tory member for Eastwood recently liberated from
ministerial duties, has been relating that his postbag is overflowing
with letters of support from constituents over the M77 pickaxe affair.
He is now predicting an increased majority at the next election. When he
was asked how it would feel being the last Tory MP in Scotland, his
answer was: ''Great. I'd get to be Shadow Scottish Secretary.''
That's the spirit
ANOTHER now-it-can-be-told story involving the late Sir Nicky
Fairbairn. It concerns whisky, a substance to which the great man was
not averse.
He had the good fortune to represent the city of Perth which is not
short of distilleries. An informal arrangement existed with one whisky
producer that a case of the stuff would be delivered once a month to Sir
Nicky's office at the Commons.
Sir Nicky had the misfortune that his office was close to those
occupied by Tom McMillan, the Labour MP for Glasgow Central, and Harry
Selby, the Member for Govan. On more than one occasion Nicky's case of
hooch went mysteriously missing, an event which coincided with brothers
McMillan and Selby appearing to have a wee glow on.

A NAE Luck Award to one Martin Hannan, a rugby correspondent of the

Watsonians-West of Scotland match transmitting his purple prose via his

of white paint as used for painting the lines on the pitch. The match
result was 12-13, hardly a whitewash at all.
Sudden-death
decider
THE new streamlined waiting-list at the prestigious Deeside Golf Club
on the outskirts of Aberdeen has been the talk of the 19th hole among
those lucky enough to be members.
Would-be members can languish as long as 20 years on the waiting-list,
with members putting down the names of their offspring the minute they
were born.
The committee recently pruned the list by removing those who had moved
away from the area, had died, or were too old to swing a club before
they were offered the opportunity of paying #600 for their first year.
Some ungrateful sprogs had informed pater that they had no interest in
golf.
This exercise reduced the waiting-list to 400 and it was decided to
open the list for a further 400 applications which doubled the number.
This is good business since the club charges a #5 annual administration
fee for each applicant.
The new applicants were balloted for position with a few words of
consolation for the poor unfortunate who is number 800. ''We'll all have
to die twice before he gets to play here,'' one member observed.

Nine things you always wanted to know about a party girl
THE revelation that SNP Perth and Kinross hopeful Roseanna Cunningham
had a relationship with an unattached male colleague 18 years ago is
only the tip of the iceberg.
We can reveal further details of Ms Cunningham's private life which
cast serious doubt on her fitness to be MP for Perth and Kinross:
* At school she was once kissed behind the bike shed.
* Every year on February 14, Roseanna would send lurid love poems to a
boy in her class.
* At a party in a friend's house she once participated in a group sex
frolic called Postman's Knock.
* SNP sources tell us that at almost every party conference ceilidh,
Ms Cunningham has been seen dancing with men, sometimes two or three
different men a night, and many of them wearing kilts.
* She once experimented with drugs by eating an entire packet of
Tunes.
* Ms Cunningham has been seen on more than one occasion on her own in
a pub.
* She has been known to wear a short skirt.
* She openly admits to having a passion for Mr Spock of Star Trek.
* She admits to dressing up in funny clothes and wearing a wig but
claims it is something to do with her job as an advocate.
* The above church notice from the Dundee Courier seems to imply a
lack of personal hygiene on the part of Broughty Ferry Girl Guides.

On the day the Broadcasting Standards Council launches its report on
violence and sex on television during 1994, Stuart Cosgrove,
commissioning editor for Channel 4, explains the philosophy behind the
channel's Red Light Zone series
TELEVISION is a promiscuous medium. It has a phenomenal appetite for
sex and sexuality, but more importantly, it has a lust for new ideas
which is virtually impossible to satisfy.
Each week, the number of television channels available to British
viewers multiplies and new approaches to programming come on stream. It
is an environment that encourages television's promiscuity, and erodes
the basic principles of broadcasting. The loyal viewer is already a
thing of the past; there is now a receding generation of people who can
be relied on to tune in same time, same place, next week.
Facing a more competitive and less certain future, television is
hurriedly following the manufacturers' lead, and is busy creating a set
of recognisible brand-names which they hope will assert an authority on
the viewer's mind. This process is known as stranding -- the television
term for grouping individual programmes into a strand, a series, or a
season. Channel 4 has already created several significant strands -- The
Big Breakfast in the early morning, the Happy Hour from 5pm-7pm, and
seasons of programming, like Bloody Bosnia and Dinomania, which housed
very diverse programmes about war and dinosaurs.
This month, Channel 4 launches one of its most ambitious programme
strands, the Red Light Zone -- more than 24 hours of programming which
will be broadcast late on Saturday nights exploring the sex trade,
prostitution and pornography. The idea is simple; to create a late-night
zone of adult programming which will question some of the issues and
ideas that can be found in the red light districts of most major cities.
It is an ambitious idea, and one fraught with problems, particularly
when set against a backdrop of increasing moral concern about
broadcasting standards and the erosion of taste and decency. But the Red
Light Zone has been programmed with issues and ideas very firmly in
mind. In this respect it welcomes the inevitable controversy, not for
the sake of controversy itself, but for the wider discussion it will
provoke. The programmes that Channel 4 intends to broadcast have been
chosen precisely because they raise questions about power and pleasure
in the sex industries.
The Red Light Zone has chosen as its motto the phrase ''You Can't
Police Desire'' -- a challenge not to moral orthodoxy, but to Channel
4's own unique status as a broadcaster obliged by its remit to encourage
innovation and difference. It is an initiative more likely to divide
opinion than to unite it, and will broadcast programmes that are as
likely to challenge feminism as much as Christianity, and to question
motivation as much as morality.
The programmes in the Red Light Zone add up to more than the sum of
their sexual parts. A number of significant themes recur across the
range of programmes -- the role of woman in the sex industries, the
diversity of sexual pleasure, and the tensions between sex, money and
self-interest.
The series opens with a short film report from New York, entitled NYPD
Nude, filmed by the Derry-based director Margo Harkins. The programme
revolves around the experiences of Carol Shaya, a police officer working
in a busy and violent police precinct in the Bronx. Pursuing a career as
a model, Shaya sent photographs of herself to Playboy magazine, and
agreed to appear in the pages of the magazine.
As the pages of Playboy unravel she is seen arresting a felon, then
stripping off the various layers of her police uniform, lying naked
against a police car, and finally sitting legs akimbo with her police
baton acting as a phallic partner.
The photos caused a furore inside the New York Police Department and
the film charts the progress of the argument -- Shaya's suspension from
duty, her appearance on nationwide talk shows, the anger of other women
in the precinct, and the wider issue of constitutional rights. The film
hinges on one central dispute. Appearing naked in Playboy is Carol
Shaya's constitutional right under the free speech provision of the
First Amendment, but her decision to appear in a police uniform and
implicate it within the realm of sexual fantasy was an imposition on
other women officers who were dragged into the dispute against their
will.
Using rights and duties as the spine of its argument, the film
inevitably touches on questions of pornography, sexual harassment in the
work-place and the role of women in the police.
White Jazz, a film by the Glasgow-based film-maker Nicola Black, takes
a very different view of the world of sex and crime. In a stunning and
compellingly shot film she focuses on the dark and obsessive world of
the cult crime writer James Ellroy, as he investigates his own mother's
murder in the red light zones of post-war Los Angeles.
Ellroy's vision is pure dystopia. The streets are populated with
freaks, perverts and third-world bug-eaters. No-one lives in anything as
simple as a house; they live in flop-shops and two-bit freak-shacks.
Moving effortlessly and sometimes imperceptibly, the film is a voyage
through the debris of two simultaneous murders; the infamous death of
the Black Dahlia, a sexually promiscuous dreamer whose body was found
decapitated in South Central in the years after the war, and the
unsolved murder of Ellroy's mother, strangled by an unknown assailant
she picked up in a singles bar.
The film is a career gift. How many world-famous writers collaborate
with a young Scottish film-maker and agree to re-open the case of their
murdered mother? White Jazz accepts the gift with an assurance; the
cinematography screams style, mixing old 16mm black and white with
deep-burnished sunsets, and time-lapse images of downtown LA.
Most of the films scheduled to be broadcast across the first eight
weeks of the Red Light Zone go beyond the sex industries and touch wider
social concerns. Paul McGuigan's Go-Go Archipelago appears on the
surface to be a film about strippers, but ends up being a metaphor for
migration. The strippers in question are the Russian immigrants who have
fled the former Soviet Union to embrace capitalism in all its naked
intransigence and work as go-go dancers in America's biggest Russian
ghettos, near Coney Island and Brooklyn's Brighton Beach. As blue-collar
Americans stand desperate and alone in cheap-skate bars stuffing dollar
bills into the cupped breasts of the Russian dancers, the whole question
of sexual power wriggles with uncertainty. Rich American, poor Russian.
Lonely man, confident woman. Resident and illegal immigrant. Old and
young.
The film views the go-go bars from the vantage point of the strippers.
It listens to their views of Amercia, and its huddled masses. The girls
appear in various states of undress, sometimes naive and sometimes
deliberately naughty. They are often cynical about their work and
frequently reminisce about home -- Odessa, the Black St Petersburg. They
talk about mothers and fathers, and babies back home. They tell you they
hate America -- in a loving kind of way.
Despite the arguments for and against pornography, nothing is absolute
in the Red Light Zone.
The films frequently act as a front-room response to tourism. They
offer the viewer a perspective on societies they may know only by
reputation. The series travels from Sunset Strip to Thailand, from the
Philippines to Soho, and from 42nd Street to the transsexual prostitutes
who live beneath the gaze of Islam in the red light districts of
Istanbul.
The legacy of power is a brooding presence throughout another new
film, Manningham Diaries by the Leeds-based film-maker Dominique Walker.
Her film is structured around a series of real extracts from diaries
kept by prostitutes in Bradford's Manningham district, an area where the
Yorkshire Ripper claimed several victims.
Manningham is a red light zone virtually stripped of myth and romance.
There is no stylised Americana here, just women with gravel voices and
red-brick lives, selling their bodies for food, for rent, and inevitably
for drugs. Set in a derelict mill, and on the streets of Bradford, it
offers sex as a dismal reality, stripped of all the fictionalised
erotica of Sunset Strip. Manningham is as much a survival zone as a red
light zone.

The tobacco industry, aware that the day is approaching when open
advertising of cigarettes will be banned, is switching to more insidious
forms of marketing, as Ann Shaw reports
WALK down any street and you will see young girls smoking. Why do they
do it? The answer is simple. Advertising today is aimed unashamedly at
them. Take the current issue of Cosmopolitan magazine: its fashion
supplement has two models posed seductively with cigarettes. And with
supermodels like Kate Moss lighting up in front of the cameras, it is
easy to get the idea that cigarettes are glamorous fashion accessories.
So much so that next month sees the launch of a new campaign by the
Health Education Authority backed by leading fashion names to persuade
the image-makers that smoking and glamour do not mix.
Even the television ''soap'' EastEnders regularly shows one of its
characters, Pat Butcher, lighting up under stress.
''Advertisers don't need to spend money pushing their products when
fashion and style magazines, along with television, do the job so
well,'' says Doreen McIntyre of Glasgow 2000, the anti-smoking lobby.
While there has been a steady decline in smoking throughout the
population over the past 20 years the number of young people taking it
up has remained steady according to the 1993 survey by the Office of
Population Censuses and Surveys.
Twenty-six per cent of 15-year-old girls and 19% of 15-year-old boys
smoke regularly. The bad news is that teenagers who smoke have greater
difficulty in giving it up later in life than adults, says the latest
research.
Advertisers realise that the day is approaching when open advertising
of cigarettes will be banned so they are already looking for more subtle
methods of getting through to their key market: new smokers.
So today they are switching from billboard advertising to a more
insidious form, targeting young people in nightclubs, even giving away
free cigarettes, sponsoring modelling competitions, style magazines, and
sporting events.
You've only got to look at the amount they spend every year -- #200m
promoting their products against the much smaller #5m by the health
lobby -- to see that they are not prepared to give up this lucrative
market without a fight.
Schools are doing a lot of curriculum work to discourage smoking but
they ignore the hidden agenda, says Doreen McIntyre. ''Teachers smoke in
their staff rooms then walk into classrooms stinking of smoke. So pupils
are getting mixed messages.''
Pupils who belong to SmokeBusters often write to Glasgow 2000 and
complain about ''smelly teachers''. There is nothing in Strathclyde
region education policy that forbids teachers smoking in front of
children but it is an accepted unwritten rule that they don't.
There is also the problem that teachers turn a blind eye to the
smokers' corner. Every school has one, every teacher knows where it is,
but they do nothing, says McIntyre.
Are there any basic tips to stop smoking? Yes, think about why you use
cigarettes and realise that:
* Its nicotine addiction, and
* If you are using them to control weight or stress then tackle each
issue separately.
Alternative therapies such as hypnosis and acupuncture can be helpful
but Doreen McIntyre advises first to ''check the person belongs to a
professional body. You should be aware that complementary medicine is
only a tool to help your own efforts. It may be a useful tool but you've
got to be committed in the first place.''
Here's a cautionary tale of a woman who plucked an alternative
therapist out of the small ads.
Mrs W. from the South Side of Glasgow decided she would do something
about her husband's smoking so she booked an appointment with a
hypnotist.
He agreed because he too wanted to stop smoking. But he got more than
he bargained for.
Under hypnosis it had been suggested to him that the reason he was
smoking was that he was stressed due to sexual problems in their
marriage. So he left his wife. And returned to his mother.
Coincidentally, the hypnotist also ran a sauna business.

IT SEEMS like a sick joke, selling cigarettes called Death with a
white skull and crossbones on a black background. But it's a serious and
highly successful bit of niche-marketing dreamed up by a young
London-based entrepreneurial company called The Enlightened Tobacco
Company.
Manufactured in Holland, the cigarettes were launched in the UK in
December 1991 ready for the Christmas market. At the festive season
packs of Death cigarettes are sold in a gift box-shaped coffin.
This macabre sense of humour strikes a chord with many young people
reared on a television diet of violence and crime.
''They sell very well,'' says a spokesman for Tower Records, in Argyle
Street, Glasgow, one of the Scottish outlets for the cigarettes. A
packet of 20 costs #2.29p. They carry all the required health warnings
and the manufacturers claim to be selling the ''first honest smoke'' and
say they will donate 10% of their profits to cancer charities.
Some shops are running special promotions inviting people to write
their own epitaph and win a black leather ''Death'' jacket.
Anti-smoking campaigners have made their opinions on the brand clear.
David Pollock of Ash says:''Death kills as efficiently as any other
brand. This is clever niche-marketing that will have a definite appeal
to some young people. The claim that they will put people off smoking is
superficial.''

HAD fate been kinder, Ken Loach could have had the perfect title for
his 22-minute video in defence of Clause 4. One Rogue Trader: strikes
just the right note, don't you think? One junior tycoon, upwards of
#600m lost on a demented snowball bet, 4000 jobs washed away like the
slops from a City wine bar, the pound bludgeoned, and every august
personage in the land running around like chickens whose heads have been
demerged. And just, as the publicity might have said, when you thought
it was safe to go back into the markets.
As it is, Loach has put together (in a day and a half) a reasoned
denunciation of laissez faire capitalism. It isn't the best film he will
ever make, and it won't win him any prizes, but that is not its purpose.
Its talking heads give a telling account of precisely how vicious
market forces can be -- a former security guard recalling, for example,
how his dog was earning twice as much as he was -- but it doesn't
explain why Clause 4 is the only useful response.
In part, this may be because Loach took the party leadership at their
word when they said they wanted a debate. With Tony Blair now informing
audiences he does not even believe in the aspirations expressed in the
Webbs' clumsy formula -- while making it clear he'll have his reforms
come what may -- Loach and his fellow workers can be charged with
naivete.
The debate, such as it was, has already happened. This is important in
itself, for it gives us a taste of what we can expect from a Blair
government. This is a leader, famously, without baggage. His roots are
shallow and his allegiances weak. His is neither the old Labour right
revived nor (and here previous insults stand to be corrected) the SDP in
thin disguise. Blair comes naked to the political world, starting from
scratch with only a set of assumptions about community and capital to
cover his intellectual modesty.
Nick Leeson, the Singapore bookie, ought to have pulled the leader and
his supporters up short. Instead, the opposite has happened. Rather than
take the Barings scandal as an example of what a Labour government must
oppose, they depict it as proof that there are things no government can
resist. So too, of course, do the Tories. If that thought inspires you,
even Valium will seem a touch racy.
Thus we had one Blairite commentator noting this week of Barings that
''before the mighty power of electronic markets, the plaint that neither
Whitehall nor Threadneedle St could control what happened in Singapore
is all too persuasive''.
Another argued that ''All leaders of any stripe now have to work
within the global economy; those old socialist tools of macroeconomics
are useless, except, possibly, on the European level''.
All this, mark you, from writers on the left. Here we have conjured a
vision of impregnable bond markets, of an electronic juggernaut, and of
democratic politicians who must pretend to run countries while bowing
the knee to the global empire. Small truths -- such as the fact that
computerisation makes control easier, not more difficult -- are
airbrushed from the picture. Small facts -- that much of this
trans-national imperium is run from the unregulated City of London --
slide off the agenda. You can like rampaging capitalism or lump it.
In this discourse the greatest virtue ascribed to any politician is
humble realism, as though reality is always something made for you, not
something that can ever be altered. If Nick Leeson runs amok that is
just a regrettable anomaly, one rogue trader, a lone crook or madman,
rather than one hell of a rogue system.
You can hunt out the freak, improve (ironically enough, given the
Clause 4 debate) your controls, but for some reason you can do nothing
about the circus that breeds such freakishness, that places hypothetical
bets on hypothetical events and makes its excuses when the bills come
in. Just lie back and think of the Bank of England.
Yet Blair and his supporters seem to want it both ways. While
stressing convenient home truths they also present themselves as the
champions of regulation, as the boys and girls who will end the
''excesses'' of low pay and executive avarice, who will ensure that free
markets are cajoled into partnership with the people. They say that
nothing can be done yet act as though something will be done. Which is
it?
Ken Loach's modest film has received a predictable reaction from the
party hierarchy. Its maker has been smeared and insulted while the bien
pensant groupies have had a good laugh at socialist simpletons. For all
its faults -- and preaching to the converted is the most conspicuous --
it deserves better, but then so do the voters.
Try this last thought for size: Blair doesn't actually care about
Clause 4. He would, without doubt, have ignored it while in office but
he needs to destroy it now to establish his plausibility. Given the
opinion polls, it seems unlikely that the voters needed to be convinced.
So whom does Blair seek to please, if not the commercial and media
machine that recently victimised one of his predecessors?
Perhaps the leader is awaiting the outcome of Michael Foot's libel
action before he addresses the question of ownership. Or is Murdoch now
a shining example of partnership with the people? For the record, that
gentleman has already said he could envisage supporting Blair. Plainly,
there is at least one global gambler just terrified of what lies ahead.

THE Labour Party, as you young 'uns may have cause to find out one
day, has an appalling record, once in office, of not doing anything
right, particularly in relation to the economy. Under the mantle of that
empty old blusterer Lord Healey, the rich and the International Monetary
Fund got richer, the poor got rampant inflation.
No, what the People's Party are really good at is spotting what is
wrong, exploiting a grievance, rubbing salt into a wound, making the
public feel cheated. The champion of this tactic is undoubtedly Mr
Gordon Brown, an honours graduate in gloom, a Grand Master of misery, an
ever-present pebble in the Government's shoe.
Gordy and Bambi, as they probably call them in the drawing-rooms of
Islington these days, know only too well that what we all like to know
most is how much other folk are being paid. Particularly rich people.
Thus, on a daily basis it seemed, they have been taunting Mr Major's men
about the swelling pay pokes of executives in the privatised utilities.
And when Mr Brown cried: ''It is time to sweep away the secretive and
unaccountable practices of the privatised utilities and make the running
of the companies transparent and accountable,'' Mr and Mrs Joe Public
shouted ''Hear, hear''. I did so myself.
I was frankly appalled by the obscene manner in which the boys and
girls, though there will be few of the latter, of the former gas,
electricity, and water boards, have awarded themselves 75% increases and
been granted share options worth millions.
This is not a reward for a job spectacularly well done, nor a hike
born out of huge profits; this is pure, unadulterated greed.
The most oft-spoken excuse for paying these megabucks is ''we have to
compete in the open market''. This is on the same lie-scale as ''the
cheque is in the post'' or ''I'll ring you soon about lunch''. There is
no competition involved in the operation of the National Grid.
A second plea in mitigation is ''it would cost us four times as much
to replace him'', another from the Joseph Goebbels' School of Truth.
What about the deputies to these pampered, part-time chairmen -- is
there no-one with ambition or ability prepared to take over?
What would happen if old David or Cedric, perish the thought, were to
keel over in the street, fall beneath the wheels of that bus which used
to go looking for Prime Ministers? Would we, any of us, notice the
slightest diminution in standards, would there be fewer gas leaks? Not a
chance.
These are not inventors or even venture capitalists who have risked
all their own wealth to become millionaires. If Mr Hoover invented the
vacuum cleaner, good luck to him, he deserved to make his pile; the man
who set up Direct Line insurance was worth every penny. We are talking
here about glorified civil servants lining the pockets of their pals.
So, I say to my friends in Government, of whom there are still a few,
I am delighted that this week the Prime Minister has decided the time
has come to intervene. It is not enough for Mr Major to say how
distasteful he finds the matter, we need, and demand, prompt action. The
British public perceive these rises to be unfair; they expect their
Government to do something about it.
How can you justify pay restraint for nurses and at the same time
decide nothing can be done about the pin-striped piranhas who stagger to
the bank with their lolly each week? These rises have insulted the
intelligence of the nation.
I would first, dear Prime Minister, make it clear that none of these
over-paid executives can expect anything by way of public recognition,
no gongs, now or in the future, unless they return some of the
ill-gotten gains. A small step, perhaps, but the sight of a disappearing
''K'' often concentrates the mind wonderfully, particularly that of the
good lady wife.
Secondly, I would pinch, or adapt, at least one of Gordy's ideas. The
regulator should not have the power to stop massive increases but he
should have the right to summon meetings of shareholders to discuss
them. He should also be encouraged to say when he believes them to be
excessive.
This is a real opportunity for the Tories to do something popular.
While I am on the subject of cleaning up the act, chaps, I think you
ought to be aware of another current irritation felt by the general
public. It fairly gets up folks' noses when they observe ex-Government
ministers racing into the board-rooms of companies they often helped to
privatise. They think that stinks.
I trust the Nolan Committee, charged with bringing back a little
honour into public life, will suggest a time-lag, say of about three
years before this can happen in future. I trust the Government will act
on any such recommendation.
As an elected member I cannot be immediately employed by my local
authority if I lose my seat, or even give it up. Similar restrictions
apply to certain military personnel and civil servants; there is no
reason why ministers should be treated any differently.
There is a pressing requirement for this Government to stop fighting
among themselves and start convincing the electorate that they are
fighting instead in their best interests. This U-turn is a swerve in the
right direction.  An election cannot be all that far away -- it may come
sooner than some expect. I remember Labour Governments, I have
absolutely no desire to see them wreck the economy once more.

NEW RELEASES
Shawshank Redemption (15)
Dir: Frank Darabont
Pret a Porter (15)
Dir: Robert Altman
Bandit Queen (18)
Dir: Shekhar Kapur
William Russell samples three films with fine ingredients, blended to
give dishes which are tasty, bland and stimulating
SOMETIMES a film can be better than the sum of its parts, and Frank
Darabont's stylish prison drama, Shawshank Redemption (15) is a case in
point. Little more than a ragbag of bits from every Hollywood prison
film from Brute Force to Birdman of Alcatraz, the result is an
engrossing, skillfully scripted, handsomely photographed and very
well-acted film. A left-over stew perhaps, but a truly tasty dish.
Robert Altman's Pret a Porter (15), a would-be satire on the fashion
industry, is the reverse. The parts are, on the whole, fine, the sum
deeply disappointing, the satire blunt. In the past Altman has managed
to weave a huge cast and an apparently random collection of story lines
into a satisfactory whole. Here they remain threads.
In Shawshank Redemption Tim Robbins plays a New England bank manager
sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his unfaithful wife and
her lover. Naturally he is innocent. The other routine ingredients in
the stewpot include a corrupt, bible-punching warden (Bob Gunton), a
sadistic chief guard, a benevolent lifer fixer, who becomes the hero's
friend (Morgan Freeman), an old lag, a prison librarian who keeps a pet
bird and has been there for centuries (James Whitmore), a naive young
lag who comes to a sticky end, and assorted sadistic homosexual rapists.
Robbins gets thrown in the Hole, that pitch-dark cell reserved for
solitary confinements, is raped by the ''Sisters'', as the gang of
homosexual convicts are known, and bonds with Freeman, Oscar-nominated
for his performance, in the nicest possible way.
Darabont's script is based on a short story by Stephen King, and while
one follows the slowly told tale with interest, he has stretched the
basic material rather too far for comfort. What the film is working
towards is showing us just how Robbins escapes from this maximum
security hell. The scheme proves breathtakingly preposterous.
The plot is simple. Robbins exploits his banking skills to corrupt his
jailers and make friends with the prisoners who matter. The chief guard
is won over when he fixes his alimony, the warden after he sets up a
series of tax-dodging companies to handle the money the malevolent old
shyster has been stealing from the State.
It is good to see Whitmore, one of the great Hollywood character
stars, back as the old man who cannot, when he is eventually paroled,
face up to love outside, and Freeman is good as the best friend,
although that Oscar nomination is pushing things a bit. It is Robbins's
performance, however, which holds the film together. You know he is up
to something, but you never quite know what. Roger Deakins's cool blue
and grey photography is what lends the film its greatest distinction,
conveying perfectly the feeling of a life in cloisters.
The first half of Pret a Porter provides considerable pleasure. ''A
designer creates the woman he wants to be with, or in most cases the
woman he wants to be,'' someone perceptively remarks as a jolly
collection of faggots, real and fictional, parade across the screen.
There is also Sophia Loren's return to the big screen in a glamour role
to enjoy. La Loren manages at 60, admittedly with the help of some
well-crafted foundation garments, support stockings and a camera keeping
a discrete distance, to repeat her famous striptease for Marcello
Mastroianni featured in Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow, a case of -- Eat
your heart out, Joan Collins.
But there is no plot to bind the ingredients together, and eventually
it all proves tiresome and self-congratulatory. A mystery man,
Mastroianni arrives in Paris during ready-to-wear week, meets Loren's
husband (Jean Pierre-Cassel) who dies choking on a ham sandwich.
Mastroianni, suspected of murder, goes on the run. Meanwhile the badly
dressed gorgons who edit British Vogue and Harper's Bazaar (Linda Hunt,
Tracey Ullman and Sally Kellerman, the last two overacting shamelessly)
try to hire the exclusive services of a famous photographer (Stephen
Rea), who takes compromising pictures of all three for unfathomable
reasons, and Simone Lowenthal (Anouk Aimee, every bit as well preserved
as Sophia), who runs a fictional fashion house, has her collection
stolen by her son (Rupert Everett).
Tim Robbins appears as a sports writer told to cover the supposed
murder; he is forced to share his hotel room with a novice fashion
reporter (Julia Roberts), who, when under the influence of drink, is a
great lay. They spend the entire film in bed, emerging only to have a
spat.
Richard E. Grant is quite funny as a male Vivienne Westwood, but the
best moments go to Kim Bassinger as the sort of telly journalist whose
brains are in her cleavage. She acts as chorus, interviews celebrities
real and fake, and eventually stalks off in disgust when the big moment
comes and the fashion journalists behave like those people who applauded
the Emperor. It is not all that big a moment, but I shall not reveal any
more than I have already done. Maybe the high-fashion world is just too
ludicrous for satire. After Altman's last two films a more substantial
dish than this collection of camp canapes and nubile nibbles should have
been on the menu. Don't expect too much, however, and you could be
pleasantly surprised.
The week's most challenging film is Shekhar Kapur's Bandit Queen (18)
based on the life of an Indian outlaw, Phoolan Devi, a village girl who
became leader of a band of dacoits and something of a national heroine.
She has disowned the tale, objecting to the way her story has been
treated. But that was possibly inevitable. It is a powerful indictment
of a social system which still exists in India under which low-caste
women are chattels to be exploited by men.
Seema Biswas gives a moving, powerful performance as Devi. Maybe one
should not make films about persons still living, but the intention is
patently not to exploit her story. Bandit Queen, uncomfortable watching
at times, is a most stimulating film which has things to say about a
society whose ways must change. How the change is made is not for the
developed world to say, and the film offers no solutions, but no woman
should be fated to endure the life Devi managed to leave behind.
* All films open tomorrow.

Los Angeles, Wednesday
THE judge in the O.J. Simpson double-murder trial today dismissed a
black juror who had been accused of misconduct and replaced him with a
38-year-old white woman.
Summoning the remaining jurors into court on short notice, Judge Lance
Ito told them he found ''good cause'' to remove the 46-year-old man, but
provided no explanation for the change.
Juror 620 -- the fourth person to be booted off the panel -- had been
the centre of controversy for several weeks and prosecutors had strongly
pressed for his dismissal.
The man, who works as an express courier, was reportedly investigated
for allegations that he offered to bet a co-worker a week's salary that
Simpson would be acquitted in the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown
Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.--Reuter.

JUST as the implementation of an equal opportunities policy marked out
progressive employers in the 1980s, so a well-thought-out occupational
health strategy may discriminate between the good and bad employers in
the future. Many employers remain unaware of the long-term problems
which may arise should they ignore their employees' working environment
and health. The issue of health and safety at work is moving up the
corporate agenda, with the European Commission also getting in on the
act.
One could be forgiven for believing that the lower incidence of
illness associated with work in traditional industries such as
coal-mining, chemicals, and agriculture means that there is no longer an
issue of occupational health. However that is not the case. The hazards
of working in these industries remain. What has improved over the years
is the risk management, which means that fewer cases occur of
occupational diseases such as asbestosis.
In place of these ''blue collar'' diseases have come a variety of
arguably more complex, often psychological, illnesses such as stress and
viral infections such as ME, known as ''yuppie flu''. These are
afflicting growing numbers of essentially office-based employees in the
service sector. Insurance statistics show that there are now as many
illness as accident injury claims. Insurance companies are currently
paying about #400m a year on disease claims.
Although there remain millions of people looking for work, those who
do have jobs are often working twice as hard, with many businesses
preferring to push their existing staff to the limit rather than take on
new employees. Fear of unemployment means, perhaps not surprisingly,
that people are reluctant to tell their boss that they cannot cope with
their workload. However, there are very few of us who can continue to
function at our best if under sustained pressure, with little back-up,
for any length of time.
In terms of working hours Britain leads the way in Europe but in a
negative sense. Figures from the European Commission show that Britons
average a 43.4 hour week. That compares with 41.3 hours in Portugal,
40.8 hours in Greece, and 39.7 hours in France and Germany. Over a
working lifetime the average British manager is estimated to spend five
years reading and writing letters, four years commuting, three years on
the telephone, two years in meetings, 1.8 years waiting at
traffic-lights, a year in the loo, but no more than 10 months talking to
their families.
Stress psychologist Dr David Lewis believes that stress resulting from
hard work is not in itself a bad thing, indeed it can be beneficial, but
if it is not understood and controlled it can potentially be extremely
harmful. Dr Lewis recommends that people learn to recognise their
arousal level which falls midway between the extremes of boredom and
panic and is similar to tuning a violin string. ''Too slack and you
can't play a note; too taut and the string is at risk of snapping.''
Given the escalating costs associated with employers' liabilities,
businesses both small and large will benefit from having a
well-thought-out occupational health strategy because the health
problems of today will be the liability claims of tomorrow. In any case
there are possible benefits to both employers and employees. A healthy
workforce means that the business should be able to increase its
performance in areas such as staff productivity.

Mogadishu, Wednesday
MAYHEM erupted at Mogadishu's airport today after UN troops abandoned
the outer perimeter and hundreds of gunmen and looters moved in.
A US Marine shot and killed a Somali civilian after he fired a
rocket-propelled grenade launcher at a group of marines on the beach at
Mogadishu, a Defence Department spokesman said.
Lieutenant-Commander Scott Campbell said the Somali kneeled down to
load the launcher, stood up and fired in the direction of marines
stationed in foxholes. A marine returned fire.
Earlier Somali militias fired wildly into the air to clear hordes of
robbers from the former peacekeepers' base.
Watching American and Italian marines dived for cover behind sand
dunes as bullets whistled over their heads.
The gunfire came from ''technical'' cars mounted with mortars and
anti-aircaft guns.
''We watched them for a while. We never saw the technicals aim at
us,'' said American Lieutenant-General Tony Zinni.
Zinni watched the chaotic scene from the top of a sand dune in the
grey dawn light.
Several grenade or mortar bombs exploded at one end of the airport
runway.
It was not clear who fired them, but Somalis said it could have been
other militia gangs angry at not sharing in the plunder.
American Super Cobra attack helicopters swooped over the scene and a
''Spectre'' AC-130 gunship circled the sky throughout the day.
Events began at dawn when the rearguard of 1500 Pakistanis pulled back
from the outer walls of the airfield base in a long convoy of tanks and
armoured vehicles bound for the sea port.
The Pakistanis are due to leave by ship tomorrow and are expected to
be followed later in the day by the 1800 US marines and 400 Italian
soldiers who swooped in before dawn yesterday to cover the UN retreat.
Somali militias outside the airport gates and local United
Nations-trained police inside had been positioned to stop crowds from
invading.
But the looters scaled the walls and moved through deserted warehouses
and old troop camps stealing everything from rations to mattresses.
In a bold gesture today, Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed visited
the airport gates to order his militia commanders to stop the looting,
witnesses said.
It was his first public appearance for a month and Somalis say he has
been lying low because of fears that American forces could take revenge
for the deaths of dozens of American peacekeepers who served with the UN
force during its deployment over the past two years.
At the airport he was well within range of US marines, some of whom
remember their comrades' deaths with bitterness.
The Pakistanis heading for the port today were the last of a
30,000-strong UN force from 28 nations sent to Somalia to try to end
famine and restore peace and government.
However, Somalia's warlords have failed to reconcile their differences
and the UN is pulling out.--Reuter.

Benedict Brogan examines the controversy over the reappointment of
Lord Wyatt, an odds-on Tory favourite, as chairman of the Tote
LAST summer Woodrow Wyatt bet #500 on a Tory victory at the next
General Election. The Tories' Voice of Reason may not have the gift of
the oracle, but he certainly knows who pays his #95,000 salary as
chairman of the Tote. Surprise, surprise, on Tuesday his confidence in
Mr Major was duly rewarded: the 76-year-old peer was reappointed as
chairman of the Horserace Totalisator Board -- the Tote.
The two-year posting will be his last and will fill the gap to the
next General Election. Lord Wyatt will be expected to carry out a review
of the body, which finances the racing industry with proceeds of pool
betting, based on a recommendation that its control be transferred from
the Home Office to the racing industry.
The decision has outraged the Opposition, who claim it is yet further
evidence of the ''jobs for the boys'' mentality which governs quango
appointments. Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw described it as ''a
favour too far''. The post was not advertised, despite the Government's
pledge to be more open about quango nominations.
Those who know Lord Wyatt are not surprised. He is the Government's
best friend in the press. His weekly columns in the News of the World
and the Times are famed for their slavish devotion at a time when even
die-hard Tories have trouble finding anything nice to say about Mr
Major.
He is one of the weirdest figures in British politics. In the 1980s
the former Labour MP and left-wing journalist took one look at Margaret
Thatcher and transformed himself into an ardent right-winger, whose
dog-like devotion has earned him recognition as the Government's
sycophant-in-chief. With his flying hair and wobbly chin Lord Wyatt
evokes the loving, though slightly addled, gaze of a King Charles
spaniel.
The timing of his reappointment to the post he has held since 1976
could not have been more ill-judged, coming as it has in the midst of a
running public debate on the Government's use of highly-paid but
unaccountable quango posts to reward its friends. Only last week the
Nolan Committee examining standards in public life was asked by Liberal
Democrat MP Alan Beith to investigate the matter, and in particular the
role of Home Secretary Michael Howard.
By a strange coincidence, Lord Wyatt happens to be the Home
Secretary's greatest fan. He has repeatedly used his columns to defend
Mr Howard against calls for his resignation. A string of fiascos, from
the handling of the Criminal Justice Bill to the discovery of Semtex in
a maximum security prison, have not been enough to shake Lord Wyatt's
faith. When Mr Howard said on Tuesday: ''I think it is very desirable
that we continue to benefit from Lord Wyatt's experience'', it was
heartfelt.
Woodrow Lyle Wyatt was born in 1918, educated at Oxford, and served
with distinction throughout the Second World War. He was mentioned in
despatches in Normandy. He has married twice, each time to women with
aristocratic connections, and his glamorous daughter, Petronella, is a
star writer with the Sunday Telegraph. His career as a Labour MP -- from
1945 to 1955 for Birmingham Aston and from 1959 to 1970 for Leicester
Bosworth -- did not stretch to a Cabinet post.
His conversion to the far right of the Tory party is all the more
striking because of his record as a journalist: like fellow right-wing
convert Paul Johnson, he worked on the New Statesman, and began Panorama
on the BBC with Richard Dimbleby. His books range from an edition of the
collected short stories of O Henry to the intriguingly titled Exploits
of Mr Saucy Squirrel. His appointment to the Tote in 1976 by Harold
Wilson on the recommendation of Roy Jenkins, was a Labour idea. He was
made a life peer in 1987.
The post carries with it enormous social cachet. The sport of kings
attracts money and power and Lord Wyatt has made the most of the
connections it has brought. He is on intimate terms with present and
former Cabinet ministers. He is said to be close to Rupert Murdoch, a
fact editors keep in mind when pondering the merits of his journalism
(the News of the World must have its tongue in its cheek when it flags
his attacks on Europe as ''the Voice of Reason'').
Friends describe him as an expert courtier, who knows how to laugh at
the jokes of others, who is generous in his hospitality, and knows how
to accept it as well. He is a great friend of Norman Lamont's and once
famously predicted that he would go down as one of history's great
Chancellors. Weeks later Mr Lamont was sacked.
Opinions vary on his tenure at the Tote. He has boosted its profile,
but not its profits, which over the past five years have barely
improved, from #8m to #11m. There are no shareholders to vote him out:
the statutory body is overseen by the Home Office. Its critics are
clamouring for change. They want a dynamic businessman, rather than an
ageing superannuated politician, to take over and transform racing's
fortunes.
Lord Wyatt does have admirers in strange places. Labour MP Lawrence
Cunliffe, vice-chair of the all-party Racing and Bloodstock Industry
Committee, says the chairman has achieved ''remarkable'' things. ''He
has certainly improved the Tote's efficiency and enhanced the standards
of the Tote's contribution to the racing industry,'' he says. In
particular he applauds Lord Wyatt for moving the Tote away from its
traditional roots in the Home Counties aristocracy.
But on the Voice of Reason's politics, Mr Cunliffe demurs. Like all
traitors, Lord Wyatt is reviled by Labour. The veteran MP Tam Dalyell,
who has done battle with Wyatt on many occasions, says the hatred runs
deep: ''History goes back a long way with Woodrow's unpopularity. With
Labour he is five-star, absolutely mega unpopular.''
Mr Howard has tried to head-off criticism by emphasising that Lord
Wyatt will only serve another two years. Labour is understood to be
relieved no new chairman has been found who would then be in place well
into the next Parliament. Instead the way is clear for a Labour
government to impose its own placeman on the Tote.

STRATHCLYDE councillors accepted yesterday that they should not
discuss the Ayrshire child sex abuse investigation until a full report
had been submitted by the social work department later this month.
Chairman of social work the Rev David Laing made a brief statement to
this effect at the full regional council meeting, following the Court of
Session judgment earlier this week that the seven children taken into
care should be allowed to go home.
He stated yesterday: ''I did call a meeting of local members this
morning to appraise them of the situation and a further meeting will be
called in due course.
''I shall be refraining from comment until we have looked at Lord
Hope's judgment in depth.''
Conservative leader Councillor Iain Drysdale started to ask questions
about the allegedly ''flawed'' methods of taking evidence in this case,
but was quickly discouraged from going any further by Convener William
Perry and Chief Executive, Mr Neil McIntosh.
Mr Neil McIntosh explained: ''We're dealing with a very extensive
report and very sensitive issues. It would be very unfortunate if the
consideration of the council, prior to the director's report being
submitted, were in any way prejudiced by discussion at this stage.''

<HEADLINE>Report highlights safety fears three years after 11 die in Cormorant Alpha disaster Helicopter life-jackets 'inadequate'</HEADLINE>

LIFE-JACKETS on North Sea helicopters are still inadequate, according
to a report into a 1992 crash.
Air Vice-Marshal Brian Huxley, chairman of a review into helicopter
safety and survival in the wake of the Cormorant Alpha disaster,
expressed surprise at such a state of affairs in the oil industry.
His report not only recommended improved lifesaving jackets, but a
change in the layout of seats and a standardisation of emergency exits.
A survivor told the review's steering group, which was commissioned by
the Civil Aviation Authority, that the life-jacket he wore was ''totally
inadequate''.
He said a weak or unconscious survivor would have drowned, and that a
redesign to stop the jacket riding up over the body was required.
Mr Huxley commented: ''It surprised us that there are still so many
inadequacies in the life-jackets.''
Eleven men died when a Bristow-owned Super Puma crashed seconds after
taking off from Shell's Cormorant Alpha platform in appalling conditions
en route to an accommodation platform nearby in March 1992. Six,
including the pilot, survived.
The report said the CAA should review life-jacket and immersion suit
specifications; introduce a standard method of emergency exit release;
and look at cabin layouts for ease of escape.
The report also recommended oil companies review guidance on flights
in bad weather; improved radio coverage in the North Sea; and the CAA's
looking at the whole question of crashworthiness, flotation, and
stability of helicopters.
The CAA will also be asked to make helicopter crew wear immersion
suits.
The offshore union OILC, although welcoming the conclusions, warned
the industry may, for commercial reasons, be slow to act.
Mr Ronnie McDonald, OILC general secretary, alleged too many
manufacturers had defended their own corner over standardisation of
survival gear, and added: ''There has been a disinclination on the part
of the industry to get its act together. I honestly cannot see it being
implemented with any urgency, despite the fact that it has now been
highlighted in crystal clear terms.''
The report was prepared by North Sea operators, helicopter
organisations, safety groups, and CAA experts.
A ban on offshore North Sea flights in weather ''unsuitable for
ditching'' was rejected as impractical and illogical. However, a clear
warning was issued to oil rig and helicopter operators not to use that
finding as an excuse to ignore weather conditions.
The report declared: ''It would not be defensible to allow flights to
proceed in conditions such that, if an accident were to occur, survivors
did not have a realistic expectation of being picked up alive.''
The question of some form of weather restriction on flights proved the
most contentious of all issues for the steering group.
Agreement was finally reached on the logic that the risk of ditching
is no greater than that of a forced descent over equally inhospitable
terrain by non-offshore flights.
The group argued that if the Cormorant Alpha accident had occurred at
an airport, it was most unlikely that anyone would have survived the
impact.
At the fatal accident inquiry, Sheriff Alexander Jessop mainly blamed
pilot error but, in listing 11 matters of concern, also effectively
imposed weather limitations on shuttle flights in the industry.
Mr Huxley's report follows the sheriff's recommendation that the CAA,
with others, considered restricting flights in adverse weather
conditions.
Mr McDonald agreed it would be unrealistic to try to ban flying in
conditions unsuitable for ditching, but said that ''flying should be
prohibited in weather that makes search and rescue highly problematic''.
CAA chairman Christopher Chataway described the report as the most
wide-ranging review of offshore helicopter safety ever undertaken in the
UK.

AN eviction order was granted yesterday, effective from March 29,
against the Graham family of Alexander Road, Glenrothes. Details of
their anti-social behaviour have emerged in court hearings over several
months.
Mr Gordon Graham, 39, and his wife Anne, 35, were in a van parked
outside before yesterday's hearing at Kirkcaldy. Heather, eldest of
their five children, was in the public foyer with her own child.
When Sheriff William Christie granted the decree to Glenrothes
Development Corporation and ordered the Grahams to pay costs of #1797, a
court officer called the case throughout the public areas. He returned
to say there was ''no appearance'' by the Grahams.
There was a chip pan fire on February 21 at the house in Alexander
Road, and a flood was caused by burst pipes the following night. The
Grahams moved out of the house, which subsequently had its windows
smashed. It is now boarded up. The family, who have not given up the
Alexander Road tenancy, are staying with relatives.

THE Parliamentary Ombudsman yesterday was urged to investigate
allegations of gross incompetence and ignorance at the Scottish Office
in the case of George Beattie, convicted of the Carluke murder, and due
to be released on parole from Edinburgh's Saughton prison.
It is the latest move in a campaign to clear Mr Beattie's name. Now
aged 40, he has always protested his innocence.
''George Beattie's life has been ruined because of the falsehoods
issued from the Scottish Office and their cohorts in the Crown Office,''
Mr Jimmy Hood, his Member of Parliament claimed yesterday.
Mr Beattie has been in prison for most of the past 21 years -- but for
periods when he was released either on licence or bail -- for the murder
of 23-year-old Margaret McLaughlin, repeatedly stabbed and killed as she
walked from her home to Carluke railway station.
In a lengthy document to the Ombudsman, Mr Hood, Labour MP for
Clydesdale, has listed six grounds for complaint against the Scottish
Office alleging incompetence and ignorance.
An application for a royal pardon will also be made to Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang within the next few weeks.
Failing that, Mr Lang will be pressed to order yet another appeal in
the case.
Mr Hood claims Mr Beattie's right of appeal was delayed so long by the
Scottish Office and the Crown Office that he was denied a fair appeal in
1994 because the leading witnesses at the 1973 trial were all dead.
The MP also points out that, in 1986, the Crown Office refused to
release a report concerning blood sub-groups found at the scene of the
crime. The refusal caused a seven-year delay in an appeal.
Mr Beattie was released on licence after serving 13 years. Six years
later, he was recalled to prison after an incident involving a social
worker. He was given bail pending his appeal last year but returned to
prison in November when it was rejected.

FORMULA One driver Damon Hill faces a race against time to qualify for
the start of the new Grand Prix season after being banned from the roads
for seven days for speeding.
The runner-up in last year's Formula One world drivers' championship
will not be able to apply for a racing licence until the end of the ban.
It will then take a further 15 days for him to apply for a competitive
licence, leaving him just four days before the start of the season on
March 26.
Yesterday the 35-year-old admitted driving at 102.7mph on the M40 at
Adderbury, Oxfordshire, on December 5 last year.
Magistrates at Bicester also fined Hill #350 with #25 costs.
As Hill was ushered away from the court his solicitor, Mr Michael
Breem, said his client's future hung in the balance.
The court heard that Hill had been on his way to the BBC's Pebble Mill
studios in Birmingham for a lunchtime interview when he was stopped by
police.
His barrister, Mr Tom Price, said Hill, of London Road, Ascot,
Berkshire, had faced a hectic schedule after the end of the last Grand
Prix season during which he was beaten into second place by the German
Michael Schumacher.
''On finishing last year's Formula One championship, Mr Hill was
promoting a book about that particular season,'' said Mr Price.
''On this day, he had to attend a live interview at the Pebble Mill
studios. He freely accepts he did not leave as much time as he should
have to get to the appointment and as a result his speed went slightly
above what it should have.''
Mr Price said a driving ban may force Hill to sit in the pit lane at
the Brazilian Grand Prix on March 26.
He added: ''It may well be that disqualification by this court could
stop him participating in one or more Grand Prix this season.
''The effects of missing out on one race and the valuable points he
could pick up in that race are rather like asking a boxer to go into the
first round of a 15-round contest with one hand tied behind his back.''
Mr Price told the court Hill had ''a clean driving licence and on this
one occasion has erred''.
He added that the governing body of Formula One had its own discretion
to take further steps against Hill if it thought them necessary.
Magistrates' chairman Maurice Humphris, sentencing, told Hill: ''We
try to deal in an even-handed manner with everybody who comes before the
court, whoever they may be.''

THE detective in charge of the Bonnyrigg murder investigation
yesterday called for a posthumous bravery award for David Dunn, an
honest and decent family man whose heroism in tackling three callous
bank raiders cost him his life.
Detective Superintendent John McGowan said: ''David Dunn was one of a
number of brave individuals who tackled the gunmen and secured their
arrest. Unfortunately, he paid the ultimate price for his intervention
and his bravery and public-spirited action ought to be recognised.
''These were ruthless men, all carrying firearms and prepared to use
them against anyone who stood in their way. From the point of public
safety, I am glad that they have been brought to justice.''
In a statement issued by Lothian and Borders Police on behalf of Mr
Dunn's son, Davie, the family said they would be haunted by the death.
''Our father was an ordinary man who was widely respected because he
was honest and decent. To his family he was a loving husband and father
who brought up his children to know right from wrong and respect the
law. No-one who knew him was surprised that he went to tackle these
armed men without a thought for his own safety. It is tragic that
because he had the courage to have a go he should have been killed in
cold blood.
''Now that the trial is over we will try to get on with our lives but
we will be haunted by his death.''
Detective Constable John Duffy, whose life was saved by a gun that
didn't work properly, said: ''The tragedy is that Mr Dunn had to die
because these men went out armed with guns to commit crime and were
willing to use them. I feel deeply sorry for the Dunn family because I
can understand what they must have gone through.
''One moment I was walking along the street doing my shopping when I
was confronted by these armed robbers and the next few minutes will stay
with me for a long time.''
Mr Duffy, who is just getting over the incident, added: ''My wife and
family have been a great support and I have also had lots of support
from my colleagues which has helped me come to terms with the trauma of
that day.
''I reacted instinctively to a dangerous situation which could have
threatened the public. It was not a conscious act of bravery and I know
many police officers who would have done precisely the same, but I would
advise members of the public not to tackle armed criminals.''
John Girdler, another of the brave men who had a go at the killers,
talked yesterday of his relief that they had now been put out of
circulation. Mr Girdler, 48, an ex-RAF policeman and now a civilian
employee with Lothian and Borders Police, added: ''I cannot put the
events of that morning out of my mind but I hope that the end of the
trial means that I can begin to come to terms with it.
''I would like to express my sympathies to the Dunn family and say how
brave Mr Dunn was in trying to tackle these men. But he paid a terrible
price. I went to help because I knew these men did not care who they
hurt and would be prepared to use their guns again if they got away.''
Asked whether he would do the same again, Mr Girdler replied: ''Common
sense tells me that it would be wiser not to get involved. You cannot
guess how you will respond in the heat of the moment. It all happens
very quickly. I think my military training took over and I responded
instinctively.''

BONNYRIGG, a quiet Midlothian town, had never experienced anything
like it -- a bungled bank robbery by armed, dangerous, and determined
men, and the tragic death of a 63-year-old grandfather shot in cold
blood during his efforts to thwart the raiders.
An even bigger tragedy was averted only because guns used in the raid
failed to fire on five occasions, as ballistic tests carried out by
Lothian and Borders police later showed.
The raid took place on a busy October morning, when the area around a
High Street branch of the Bank of Scotland was thronged with shoppers,
many of whom were mothers with young children.
The #185,000 raid, however, was doomed from the start, although Smith,
McQuade, and Bootland, the ''wheel man'' in the getaway car, thought
they had planned with precision.
Unknown to Smith and McQuade, they had been captured not only on a
security camera in the bank but had been filmed on another -- outside
the Royal Bank of Scotland -- as they ran to the car where Bootland, the
youngest of the trio, was racing the engine for a quick escape and a
rendezvous with a second vehicle in nearby Loanhead.
It was 11.05am when Smith and McQuade entered the bank and began the
hold up, pointing hand guns at staff, two members of Securicor who had
just made a delivery of cash, and two customers.
They made off with four bags of money, all recorded in a 50-second
sequence on camera, and they were spotted running from the bank by Mrs
Margaret Smith, aged 48, a nurse, of Sherwood Crescent, Bonnyrigg, who
was the first to raise the alarm, asking an assistant at a nearby travel
agency to dial 999.
Within five minutes, police were to receive 10 calls, and Scottish
Ambulance HQ two more -- after Mr Dunn, a grandfather, and quiet family
man, lay dying.
During the escape bid, a story of heroism and tragedy was to emerge.
This involved off-duty Detective Constable John Duffy, 42, a friend,
Duncan Milliken, 47, police station turnkey John Girdler, 48, a group of
students, and Mr Dunn.
The Musselburgh-based detective, who was chatting to Mr Milliken as
the two robbers ran past, still wearing masks, told him: ''Phone the
police -- I'm chasing them.''
Students Ian Hutchison, 17, from Haddington, Graham Willis, 18, and
Alexander Burnett, 17, both of Dalkeith, also joined in the chase, but
were stopped in their tracks when McQuade turned round to point a
long-barrelled gun, later found to be a Webley, at them.
The detective did not see the gun, and launched himself at the gunman
as he reached the car park from a vennel.
McQuade had, in fact, fired two shots at the policeman -- who only
returned to duty in January as a result of the trauma -- but the bullets
jammed. Detective Duffy's hand was scorched by the blast as he grabbed
the barrel.
Seconds later, Mr Girdler arrived on the scene and ran to help the
detective detain McQuade in a fierce struggle as other shots were fired
at them from the getaway car.
Ballistics tests found again that there had been misfires -- three on
this occasion.
The real tragedy was now set to unfold, because the next time a gun
was fired it did go off, with horrific results.
Mr Dunn, who had been in the bank only 10 minutes before the raid,
arrived on the scene, opening the door of the getaway car and hitting
Bootland on the head with a carrier bag, although Smith, also in the
car, was armed and about to fire.
Bootland was also armed with a Browning handgun, but it was never
fired.
Mr Dunn fell back from the car, dying, after being shot through the
chest in what was a bizarre happening. With one pull of the trigger, two
bullets burst from the barrel in what ballistics experts call a ''double
tap''.
As a mobile emergency team was summoned to the scene, in a vain effort
to save Mr Dunn, Smith made his escape, dropping the magazine from his
weapon as he scaled a wall. It was later recovered by police.
An alert pensioner was to seal Smith's fate. She saw him hiding in a
bush, and told police officers Michael Stark, 25, and Steven O'Hara, 33,
where he was.
Despite suspecting he was still armed, they coolly told him to come
out with his hands up in a successful act of bluff.
Smith surrendered. The gun was later found buried under the bush.
Mr Dunn, a former mining engineer, was given a hero's funeral in his
home town. Bonnyrigg came to a standstill, as more than 500 people
gathered outside his local parish church.
Sir William Sutherland, chief constable of the Lothian and Borders
force and two of his senior officers saluted his coffin as the cortege
was driven away after the service.
Sir William described him as ''a very brave man indeed'', adding:
''His actions on that day were heroic, and I cannot praise them highly
enough.''
The Rev John Mitchell, who conducted the service, said that the loss
of life had brought fear and shock to the whole community, leaving scars
on the lives of those who witnessed it.
Those who committed the crime had deprived a family of someone who was
absolutely central to them -- ''a father who put his life on the line
without thought''.
For Lothian and Borders police, the death of Mr Dunn incensed hardened
detectives. Had he not lost his life, the arrest of the three men would
have been a ''great result'', according to one senior officer.

THEY were an unlikely alliance: Smith, an AWOL lance-corporal in the
Life Guards, veteran of Ireland and Gulf War campaigns, who had no
previous convictions; Bootland, a young man from a respectable Edinburgh
family; and McQuade, from Glasgow, who has a criminal history which
including armed robbery.
Yet Smith is the man thought by police to have been the armourer for
the Bonnyrigg bank raid.
He joined the army at the age of 16. He was christened Roberto in
Leeds, although he preferred Robert, later serving throughout the world
in a career highly rated in reports by senior officers.
His rank was lance-corporal of horse, the equivalent of
staff-sergeant, commanding a tank in the Gulf War.
Former Army Major James Hewitt -- said to have been linked
romantically to the Princess of Wales -- gave evidence that Smith was a
highly professional soldier and strongly recommended him for promotion.
Significantly, he also told the court he did not think the man he
trained and worked with would lose his nerve under pressure.
Smith was married in 1984, and had no family. But following the Gulf
campaign, he was investigated by the Special Investigation Bureau for
having brought back ''trophies of war'' when he was posted to the north
of England -- and went AWOL in 1993, on the run until he was arrested in
Bonnyrigg on the day of the shooting.
A concern for police is that they are unaware of his movements over
the past year.
He carried a Glock model-19 semi-automatic weapon, McQuade, the
Webley, a First World War long-barrelled hand gun, and the third weapon
was a Browning 9mm semi-automatic -- all classic military weapons.
Smith formed a relationship with a girl in Slough, and later, with
another from Glenrothes.
As part of the detailed investigation by Lothian and Borders police,
detectives discovered he spent the night in Fife before the raid, and
that his girlfriend, Fiona Agnew, had run him over to Edinburgh,
although she was not involved in their investigation.
McQuade, twice married, has a two year-old son, and a violent criminal
past.
In 1974 he was given a four-year sentence for armed robbery, in 1982
three years for another, and in 1987 he received three years for
handling the proceeds of another armed raid.
He and Smith are thought to have met in an Edinburgh bar while the
soldier was on the run.
Bootland, however, is the enigma, the son of a respectable family who
run a bakery business.
One of a family of four, his father, Mr Hinton Bootland, is a
well-known amateur golfer in Edinburgh and the East of Scotland, who was
on holiday with his wife, Mary, at the time of the bank robbery. The
couple are said by friends to be shattered by their son's involvement.
Police think that he formed a friendship with McQuade after leaving
home to work in Glasgow in 1992, returning a year later to work in the
family business, and he partied with McQuade at various nightspots in
Edinburgh when the Glasgow man visited the capital.
On the morning of the raid, he worked from shortly after 5am until
only a few hours before the robbery.
According to police sources, he played his part, with the armourer,
Smith, and McQuade, the hardened criminal. When he was disarmed,
however, his gun was not cocked.

SAFETY experts began an inquiry yesterday after the death of a
schoolboy who choked on a pen top.
Parents and schools across Britain were being asked to check
children's pens.
The 12-year-old boy, from York, is thought to have died because the
imported felt tip pen was made without a hole in its top, which got
lodged in his windpipe.
British standards stipulate that pen tops under 16mm in diameter, and
which are likely to be used by children under the age of 14, should be
ventilated either by air holes in the cap or around the outside by means
of a clip.
North Yorkshire Trading Standards launched the inquiry after a coroner
asked for a report before the inquest on the boy, who died last week.
The tragedy was the sixth nationwide in recent years to have involved
children and pen tops. The pen involved was an old model, made in
France.

A MAN confined to a wheelchair after a road accident settled an
#850,000 damages action out of court yesterday.
Mr William Given, 23, of Townhead, Catrine, Ayrshire, was at the Court
of Session for the hearing of evidence. But Lord Milligan was told that
the case would not go ahead because the parties had come to an
agreement. Mr Given had sued Mr Ian Templeton, of Sorn Street, Catrine,
after the accident at a crossroads in Catrine in 1990.
Mr Given was driving a Suzuki 125cc motor cycle. He claimed that Mr
Templeton, who was driving a van along Sorn Street, made a U-turn into
his path without warning.
Mr Templeton was later convicted of driving without due care and
attention.
Mr Given suffered spinal injury and had to give up his work as a
joiner.

A HOSPITAL trust has been criticised for considering plans to open a
private ward -- without consulting staff.
Raigmore Hospital Trust, Inverness, today will discuss plans put
forward by UK Private Healthcare to convert a purpose-built NHS chest
ward and infectious diseases unit into a ward for private patients.
However, a former consultant at the hospital has said the move added
to a ''climate of mistrust'' between hospital workers and management.
Mr Ken Whyte, who has since resigned from Raigmore and now works in
New Zealand, made his comments in a letter to trust chairman James Kyle.
The letter was written while Mr Whyte still worked at the hospital and
was circulated among his colleagues and pinned on the ward notice board.
Mr Whyte said that although the privatisation proposals might not be
accepted by the trust, the fact the management was willing to explore
them gave doubts as to whether it had its ''finger on the pulse''.
A trust spokesman said a working party paper on the private company's
suggestions would be considered by the board at its meeting. ''But,
there will be the proposal that there should be no further action on the
development of private health care within the forseeable future,'' he
added.
The trust yesterday circulated a staff notice on Mr Whyte's open
letter, saying it was sorry to lose him but it would serve no useful
purpose to respond to his comments one by one.

THE condition of one of the seriously-ill babies in the special care
baby unit at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee has worsened. The unit was
closed on Monday after the death of a two-week-old girl from a lung
infection.
Last night Mr Malcolm McInnes, public affairs manager, said: ''Senior
medical staff have become increasingly concerned about the condition of
one of the babies who is seriously ill.''
It is understood that the child has failed to respond to antibiotics.
Another baby remains ''seriously ill''. A third, whose condition is
described as stable, has shown a marginal improvement.
Scientists from the hospital's microbiology department remain
mystified as to the source of the outbreak.
Mr McInnes emphasised that expectant mothers admitted to the maternity
unit in another part of the hospital were not at risk from the
infection.
Meanwhile 10 patients at the Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline
have been isolated after discovery of an infectious organism.
A spokesman said the strain had been identified as
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, which is widely present in
the community.
It causes the skin to break up and slows down healing processes. The
infection is not life-threatening and the hospital is confident it will
not spread further.

Greenpeace campaigners were arrested yesterday after they blockaded a
lorry carrying spent nuclear fuel at a motorway service station south of
Carlisle.
The activists were following the lorry when it pulled into the M6
Southwaite service area just before 7.30am. They moved to surround the
fuel transport vehicle shortly afterwards.
A statement issued by the pressure group claimed the two drivers and a
colleague from an escort vehicle had left the transport flask unmanned
while they went for a tea break. The anti-nuclear group claimed the
lorry was carrying enough radioactive material for half a nuclear bomb.
The protest, which lasted four hours, involved 12 activists chaining
themselves to the tarmac around the lorry, which was carrying spent
nuclear fuel rods from British Nuclear Fuel's power station at
Chapelcross, Dumfriesshire, to its reprocessing plant at Sellafield, in
Cumbria.
One activist, Ms Kate Johnston, said: ''The drivers and guard just
walked off and left it. When this stuff is imported it is
highly-guarded, but this flask was left alone while they went for a cup
of tea.'' She claimed it was not the first time that the lorry had been
left unguarded.
''They looked pretty shocked when they came back and found it
surrounded,'' she said.
A spokesman for Cumbria Constabulary in Penrith later confirmed that
16 people had been arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage. He
said they would be interviewed by police throughout the rest of the day.
Greenpeace says it has tracked 10 shipments of spent nuclear fuel
between Chapelcross and Sellafield this year -- an amount it claims
contains enough plutonium to make five nuclear bombs.
The pressure group wants the waste stored instead of being reprocessed
and claims the reprocessed plutonium is placed in military stockpiles
for use in nuclear bombs.
BNFL later dismissed the Greenpeace action as a publicity stunt which
''had yet again misinformed the public''.
The company said an escort vehicle had been directly behind the
transport flask, which had two drivers, when the protesters struck. An
immediate message had been sent to the transport controllers.
A statement said: ''The cargo of spent fuel was safe and secure at all
times. The transport arrangements complied with all national regulations
and posed no danger whatsoever to the public.''
The statement added that similar transfers had taken place between the
two sites for almost 30 years. BNFL had covered 16 million miles without
a single incident involving release of radioactivity, it said.

Brussels
MR NEIL Kinnock yesterday moved to block individual EU member states'
governments from making bilateral deals with America for cheaper air
travel.
In his first big test as Europe's new Transport Commissioner, he won
unanimous backing from his 20 colleagues at the weekly Commission
meeting in Brussels.
Mr Kinnock was responding to private approaches from the American
authorities to several EU states, including Belgium, Denmark, Austria,
Finland, Luxembourg, and Sweden.
In each case, the Americans had asked these countries -- mainly the
smaller EU nations -- to sign agreements which would mean better access
for American airlines in Europe.
Mr Kinnock, acting in the belief that the Americans were trying divide
and rule tactics in Europe, has reminded the EU states that the
so-called open-skies policy is a matter for negotiation at EU level
only, and that individual states cannot negotiate their own terms with
third countries.
''It is a hugely sensitive issue,'' a Commission official remarked.
''We have to ensure that any deals done in the EU are properly
reciprocated in the US.''
The open-skies policy in America has brought cheaper air fares for
ordinary travellers, although in many cases the standard of service has
fallen as airlines have fought each other for business.
The EU, where air fares are dearer, is trailing behind the Americans
and is still at the stage of cutting subsidies to loss-making national
carriers and encouraging privatisation. The long-term objective is an
internal EU open-skies system to rival the American model.
A Commission spokesman said that if the member states defied the
Commission's stand on this matter, they could be taken before the
European Court of Justice. Britain is not immediately involved and is
thought not to have been approached, on this occasion, by the Americans.

THE body of a climber who fell through a snow cornice on a mountain
near Kinlochleven was found by rescue services last night.
The man is thought to have fallen about 100ft from the summit Am
Bodach in the Mamore Mountains. The accident brings to 12 the number of
deaths on Scottish mountains this year, compared with a total of 14 in
climbing or hill-walking accidents by the same date last year.
The climber's body was being brought down by members of Glencoe
mountain rescue team last night.
White-out conditions had hampered their efforts to reach the man, who
was seen by another climber falling through a cornice, an overhanging
slab of wind-blown snow, on the 3382ft peak.
A Sea King helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth succeeded in taking members
of the team on to the mountain but the aircraft was forced to return to
its base because of heavy snow showers and poor visibility.
Police in Fort William said the dead man would not be named until next
of kin were informed.

MORE than 150 lecturers staged an unofficial walk-out from a further
education college yesterday in protest at the use of disputed
disciplinary procedures against one of their colleagues.
Lecturers at Clydebank College, all members of the Educational
Institute of Scotland, took the action after, they claimed, they
discovered the college's management intended to use new disciplinary
procedures in hearing a complaint against a tutor.
One lecturer said they disputed the new procedures which, he said, had
been imposed despite lecturers' objections.
Following a meeting, which decided on the stoppage, a substantial
number of classes were cancelled. The lecturer said: ''This was the
straw that broke the camel's back. There's a growing disquiet about the
style of management and the ethos they are trying to create. We feel
that this strike is a way of making our feelings known to the
management.''
The lecturers will return to work today. The Clydebank College
Principal, Mr Bill Greenock, confirmed that a ''substantial'' number of
his 220 staff had participated in the walk-out, which he was told about
by EIS branch secretary Mr Allan Ferguson at lunchtime yesterday.
He said the college regretted the disruption caused by the action but
added that many students had used the time for private study instead. He
said the college ''hoped to talk further'' with the lecturers.
Neither Mr Ferguson nor EIS officials could be contacted last night.

ELEVEN companies worldwide are understood to have shown interest in
buying the HarperCollins book printing operation at Bishopbriggs, near
Glasgow, which has been threatened with closure.
The Herald revealed in November that a search was under way to find a
buyer for the loss-making plant, which employs 470.
The London-based merchant bankers, Robert Fleming, have been working
with senior management to secure a buyer.
Their task initially involved compiling a list of around 40 potential
buyers who might be interested in taking over the plant as a going
concern.
Of the 40 contacted, 28 requested a summarised information memorandum
on the business.
Eleven companies, based in the US, Europe, and the Far East (not
Japan), have requested detailed information. This is understood to have
been given to them only after they agreed to sign a ''confidentiality
contract''.
The company expects to hear from the interested parties by the end of
this month or early next month, although one source said: ''That does
not mean we will have a buyer. We will then have to decide who we want
to start serious negotiations with.''
Earlier this week, Mr Eddie Bell, executive chairman of HarperCollins
in the UK, briefed staff on the progress.
Senior managers remain hopeful that the future of the workforce can be
secured, although they warn that ''the possibility of closure can't be
discounted'' if a buyer is not found.
A sale should not affect 700 other workers employed at Bishopbriggs in
distribution, finance, and administration, although some employees have
privately expressed fears that the move could put the entire Westerhill
complex at risk.
Mr Bell could not be reached for comment yesterday.
A sale would bring to an end Collins's 175-year link with book
manufacturing in Glasgow. The company was bought for #400m by Mr Rupert
Murdoch in January 1989 after a bitter takeover battle.
Although it is associated with several best-selling authors,
management have conceded they have failed to attract enough business for
the manufacturing side, which can produce about 60 million volumes a
year, because other publishers regard them as a competitor.
It is understood that ''crazy prices'' in the book trade, caused
mainly by cheap printing deals offered by book publishers in the Far
East, have also contributed to the plant losing about #3m in the past
year.

AN ARMY of anglers was out in force yesterday re-stocking streams and
rivers in Renfrewshire following a number of pollution disasters.
Members of the Abercorn Angling Club spent the day distributing mature
brown trout in the feeder burns for the rivers Gryffe, and Black and
White Carts.
A total of 5400 fish, ranging in size from six to 12 inches, were
released.
Some of the money used to purchase the stocks -- more than #5000 --
came from a compensation settlement by the National Chrome Tanning
Company at Bridge of Weir which accidentally polluted a two-mile stretch
of the Locher Burn three years ago.
Several of the rivers in the Abercorn Club's area have been hit by
pollution incidents in recent years, the worst involving a mystery oil
slick which appeared on the Black Cart at Johnstone and a spillage of
raw sewage which hit the Gryffe.
Club members are hoping yesterday's re-stocking will correct some of
the damage.
The anglers recently called for an investigation after raw sewage
began to overflow from drains into the Kilbarchan Burn during periods of
heavy rainfall.

SCOTLAND would have to fight hard against the danger that fewer big
foreign companies might want to invest in greenfield sites north of the
Border in future, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang warned yesterday.
In a Scottish Grand Committee debate, he painted a glowing picture of
the success so far of inward investment, largely thanks to the
activities of Locate in Scotland, but he said there were a number of
trends which could leave Scotland ''vulnerable.''
It was, therefore, becoming more important to focus on maintaining the
companies already in Scotland and encouraging them to reinvest and
expand. This had been increasingly recognised by LIS, which last year
had appointed a full-time executive to work on encouraging further
investment by the already installed base of companies.
The ''trends'' to which Mr Lang referred included South-east Asia and
mainland China providing twin opportunities to inward investors of
rapidly developing economies and low operating costs, which were proving
highly attractive.
The growth in consumer markets in central and eastern Europe also
presented challenges and oportunities, although where in those countries
infrastructure was poor, Scotland should retain an advantage.
Mr Lang insisted there was much to be optimistic about. There already
were around 350 overseas-owned manufacturing plants in Scotland
employing a total of 85,000 people directly. Last year had been the best
since LIS was established in 1981, with 95 projects announced involving
planned investment of #588m and the creation or safeguarding of over
11,000 jobs.
However, he added, it was important not to be complacent.
From the Labour Front Bench, Mr John McFall (Dumbarton) said that Mr
Lang's glowing picture did not look quite so good when the figures were
examined. Job losses in manufacturing, engineering and other sectors
meant that, since 1979, 360,000 jobs had been lost, while only 108,000
jobs had been attracted.
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Malcolm Bruce (Gordon) reflected the
views of some other MPs when he argued that confusion over the
Government's policy on Europe was damaging its inward investment
prospects while, for the SNP, Mr Andrew Welsh (Angust East) warned that
Scotland's ability to attract inward investment was deteriorating.

<HEADLINE>Opposition 'despises success'. Portillo at odds with Major on directors' pay</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979599640</RECORDNO>

EMPLOYMENT Secretary Michael Portillo yesterday attacked the
''politics of envy'' with a hint of right-wing reluctance to tackle
directors' pay.
He championed Conservative policies of the free market, incentives,
and the need for personal responsibility in a speech to the
Parliamentary Press Gallery lunch.
However, his virulent attack on Opposition demands to control high pay
came only a day after the Prime Minister paved the way for a crackdown
on excessive boardroom salaries.
Mr John Major surprised the Commons on Tuesday when he said that
''distasteful'' pay rises should be tackled, with legal backing if
necessary.
Departing from his stock response that pay within private companies
was a matter for shareholders, Mr Major said he would consider forcing
companies to ensure executive pay rises and perks were justified by
company performance.
Shadow Employment Minister Ian McCartney said: ''Michael Portillo is
putting clear blue water between himself and the Prime Minister in his
defence of executive pay bonanzas.
''It is obscene that Ministers are defending these bonanzas while
opposing a minimum wage for the low paid. Michael Portillo's remarks
were a defence of the politics of privilege.''
Cabinet strains appeared to be showing as Mr Portillo attacked Labour
for wanting to place curbs on pay levels: ''The attitude that is growing
up among the Opposition is one that despises success, that wishes to
build people up only for the satisfaction of tearing them down, that
believes that people should be held back, that high pay is itself
something to be castigated and to be controlled.''
Film maker Lord Attenborough had called for tax breaks for foreign
film directors operating in Britain, arguing that this would create
jobs.
''The case that Lord Attenborough was making was the case for the
Conservative system of incentives,'' Mr Portillo said.
''If it is true of film directors, it is true of any other directors.
That if you can attract them to this country, if you can make them set
up businesses here, they will create wealth and they will create
jobs...''
Rounding on Labour, he added: ''This is no time for Britain to give up
the successful policies of the free market in order to turn to the
policies of envy and the policies of Government control and Government
intervention.''
However, Mr Portillo denied that there was any light between himself
and Mr Major on boardroom pay and he welcomed the inquiry by the
Greenbury committee of company chiefs -- which was set up by the
Confederation of British Industry to examine the issue and which may yet
recommend an improved legal framework.
''If they make such a recommendation for legislative constraint, the
Government has made it perfectly clear that it would be prepared to
consider acting upon those recommendations,'' Mr Portillo said.
Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay said: ''Michael Portillo has revealed the
true intentions of the Prime Minister on top salaries -- do nothing.
''It is now clear that they will hide behind the loaded jury of the
Greenbury committee and only 'consider' some legislative action.
''We cannot expect any curtailment of the top salary abuse from this
committee. It would be like turkeys voting for Christmas.''
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce said: ''Mr
Portillo's outburst is astonishing, coming only one day after Mr Major's
U-turn on executive pay.
''Mr Portillo already appears to be dictating European policy, now he
is trying to dictate economic policy.''

<TEXT>
THUNDERBIRDS creator Gerry Anderson yesterday launched Britain's most
expensive TV series, the #24m alien police show Space Precinct.
The series, which begins on Sky One on March 18 and will be screened
by the BBC this autumn, is costing #1m an episode to make. Most of that
will be spent on special effects.
It is set in the year 2040 and is said to be a cross between NYPD Blue
and Doctor Who, with humans and aliens policing a tough city on the
planet Altor.
Anderson, who tried to get backing for the series for 10 years, said
each episode's budget was four times the cost of a Thunderbirds show.
He said: ''Despite the size of the budget, we have still had
difficulty in bringing what we brought to the screen with the money
available.''
The aliens are expected to become the stars of the series, which is
being shot at Pinewood studios.
The maker of the series, Menton Films, hopes to recoup the cash from
extensive merchandising and overseas sales -- more than 45 countries
have already bought Space Precinct.
Anderson, 65, insisted the series took a strong moral lead: ''In this
show, the role models behave impeccably and I am quite sure that they
will set a good example to all watching the programme.''
The series, which is already being screened in the US, features Ted
Shackelford -- Gary Ewing in Dallas -- as crime fighter Lieutenant
Patrick Brogan. His sidekick is played by Rob Youngblood.
Anderson said he regarded Space Precinct as a British production even
though its stars are American.
He said: ''We are here in Pinewood studios, we are also in Shepperton
studios, and we have 200 British technicians aboard.
''The finance comes from America and I would be delighted if the
finance had come from this country but it's better to take finance from
America and make a British show as opposed to seeing Pinewood studios
closed as it was two years ago.''

THE impact of Government health policies on Scotland came under
Opposition fire in the Scottish Grand Committee at Westminster
yesterday.
Scottish Health Minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie was making a
statement on community care policy. Instead, a succession of MPs lined
up to argue against planned hospital closures.
Lord Fraser took the line that no final decisions had been reached and
that closure proposals were out for consultation, but he was forced to
agree to hold a series of meetings with individual MPs to discuss
proposals as they affect particular areas.
Later, in a separate debate on the floor of the Commons, Rutherglen
Labour MP Tommy McAvoy raised the planned closure of Rutherglen
Maternity Hospital. Again he was told by Scottish Office Minister Lord
James Douglas-Hamilton that no final decisions had been taken and that
his representations would be taken into acount.
In his statement, Lord Fraser announced a new appeals procedure to
allow patients and their families in Scotland to question community care
decisions. The new process would be led by a clinician and would offer
''an added perspective on the appropriateness of the arrangement for the
care of the individual patient.''
Lord Fraser also announced an extra #4m for care of the mentally ill
in the community, taking the total for 1995-96 to #18m, and said
comprehensive guidance governing community care in Scotland would be
''refined.''
However, Labour MP Tom Clarke (Monklands West) said community care in
Scotland was in chaos, while Ms Rachel Squire (Dunfermline West)
produced a new policy paper in which she claimed that community care
legislation had ignored the needs of carers and the financial, physical
and emotional burden they bear.
Lord Fraser told the committee that much had been achieved in helping
to improve the quality of life for vulnerable people since the launch of
care in the community two years ago.
''For the mentally ill, there is no doubt that living at home or in
community placements is preferable to living in an institution, but
there must be careful safeguards built into the process.
''I am aware that members of this committee are always concerned that
new community services should be established before old, outdated
institutional forms of care are replaced.''
He continued: ''Let me emphasise that I give any proposals for
hospital closure careful attention to ensure that new services have been
established . . . ''
From the Labour Front Bench, Mr John McAllion (Dundee East) complained
of a ''savage reduction'' in the number of beds being provided for the
frail and elderly under the Government's changes, and accused Ministers
of effectively ending their entitlement to free NHS care.
* The Government is saving #34 bn a year because an army of unpaid
carers is looking after the sick, disabled and elderly, leading health
experts claim today.
A British Medical Association report shows that one adult in seven
looks after a friend, neighbour or close relative.

<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979599645</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN independent inquiry was yesterday reported to have found a hospital
guilty of sending home a baby with a needle lodged inside his body.
However, officials with the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, at the
centre of the dispute over baby Ben Jones, refused to publish details of
the inquiry's findings.
Mr Brian Milstead, the trust's chief executive, said that the inquiry
was incomplete and it could not be finished until Ben's parents handed
over the needle they allegedly discovered sticking out of his back.
Steve and Andrea Jones, who are locked in a row with Treliske
Hospital, said they were vindicated by the reported findings of the
inquiry.
The BBC said preliminary findings showed that Ben was sent home with
the needle inside him and that doctors misinterpreted an X-ray, which
should have shown up the needle.
A paediatric registrar is reported to have studied the X-ray, but not
shown it to a qualified radiologist, who might have spotted the needle.
Faced with the claims, Mr Milstead insisted he could not act on the
basis of incomplete evidence. ''Our primary concern is to get to the
bottom of this incident as quickly as possible,'' he told BBC Radio 4's
The World at One.
Mr Jones, 31, a Royal Navy Lieutenant, and his 24-year-old wife, from
Helston, Cornwall, said the 1[1/2]-inch needle came out of their
premature Christmas Day baby's back, one week after his January 12
discharge from the hospital in Truro.

TOUGH measures to make congregations meet their financial commitments
to the central funds of the Church of Scotland before they can call a
minister will be considered again by the General Assembly of the Church
of Scotland this year.
When proposals were put to last year's Assembly, a decision was
deferred for the views of presbyteries to be considered.
A report issued today shows that the next Assembly, in May, will be
asked to approve a proposal that congregations with a cash shortfall
would have to present a case to their presbytery when they want to call
a minister.
The onus would be on each presbytery to hear the congregation's
explanation and decide if it was justified.
Nevertheless, draft legislation which would be sent for the
consideration of presbyteries contains a provision for the Assembly's
committee on parish reappraisal to concur with the presbytery's
decision.

PROPERTY developers are scrambling to be in with a chance of getting
their hands on quite an address -- 121 George Street, Edinburgh, the
headquarters of the Church of Scotland.
The ''for sale'' is expected to go up early next summer, subject to a
study into the pros and cons of deciding to cast off the financial
burdens attached to what is familiarly known in Kirk cirles as ''121''.
Around a dozen firms have expressed interest should the General
Assembly agree to the move. One is so keen to be considered that it has
said that it would be prepared to give the Church of Scotland the
difference between the sale price, which would be millions, and the cost
of finding, buying, and upgrading another city centre building -- an
amount which the would-be developer has said would be enough to endow
the upkeep of the new premises for many years to come.
The scale of the commercial interest in 121 was revealed yesterday by
the Rev Ron Blakey, secretary to the Assembly Council, whose report to
this year's General Assembly, in May, provides a full update on a review
that began in 1993 of the building's future.
The council's view is that a new headquarters, if that turns out to be
the chosen path, should continue to be owned by the Kirk, not leased,
remain in Edinburgh, and be very central, convenient for rail and bus
stations.
It states that the council would only recommend selling 121 ''if the
financial advantage to the church was to be significant''.
An ad hoc committee conducting the current review is involved in a
thorough inspection of 121 and accurate assessments of the costs of
remaining and upgrading as against a move.
The committee is also gathering information on alternative premises,
but has not met or entered into any kind of agreement with any property
developer.
This year's Assembly is being asked to approve the ad hoc committee's
course, and a further report will be put to the 1996 Assembly for the
big decision.
Mr Blakey said yesterday that, if the Assembly so decided, 121 could
be sold for use as offices as it stood, demolished and the site
redeveloped, or undergo redevelopment behind the existing facade. It
comes under planning restrictions because of its George Street site.
He hoped that the Assembly would approve what was being done. ''With
1300 people involved, I wouldn't like to predict what would happen,'' he
said.
''The idea is that a developer would buy the offices, buy new ones for
us, and get the other building ready for us before we had to move in.
''It would be a good trick if we can do it.''
Edinburgh property valuers approached by The Herald yesterday were
reluctant to become involved in making even a guess at how many millions
such a deal would involve.

DEFENCE Secretary Malcolm Rifkind yesterday announced Government plans
to upgrade the role of the Western European Union and to provide it with
a formal structure should member states choose to deploy troops in
theatre (James McKillop writes). .
The proposals were intended to prove that the Government is European
at heart. However, at the same time Mr Rifkind hedged his bets in favour
of Euro-sceptics within the Conservative Party by making it clear that
in a major confrontation Britain would rely on Nato for its defence and
that in any case no soldier should be sent into battle in Europe -- even
if only on humanitarian grounds -- without the explicit approval of his
or her national government.
Mr Rifkind proposed yesterday that the WEU should be strengthened. At
the same time he ruled out any notion of a European Army, and emphasised
the continuing importance of Nato in Europe's collective defence.

<TEXT>
FEWER police on the beat, with stations closed at times and no
manpower for big public events, were forecast yesterday by the chief
constable of Lothian and Borders.
Sir William Sutherland was speaking at the Joint Police Board in
Edinburgh, in one of a series of meetings over the next few days to
finalise whether the hoped-for freeze on council tax charges takes place
in Lothian.
Councillor Ross Martin, chairman, said ''unpalatable'' cuts had been
forced on authorities to avoid capping by the Government. He reminded
members that the force would still have more officers than four years
ago.
Sir William responded: ''There are going to be fewer police officers
about. We will have to reduce some of the specialist sections, drugs and
serious crime. One has to accept there is going to be pain.''
Overtime would be ''hammered''. This would mean a curtailment of
patrols at weekends and public holidays. The force had no money for the
policing required for events such as the Hogmanay Celebrations, which
last year attracted 150,000 people to Princes Street, or for the Tall
Ships Race.
The non-filling of civilian posts meant that some police stations
might be closed for periods during the day when officers were out on
duty.
Lothian's Labour leader, Councillor Keith Geddes, pointed out the
region had to make reductions of #20.5m in its budget to avoid capping.
They were expecting a 2% reduction from education but the cut in the
police budget was just 1.6%. A #1.89m cut in police costs was voted
through.
Last-minute expenditure items in the district component mean that,
privately, some councillors believe they might have to put up the
council charge by at least 1%.

READERS will, I am sure recall Quintus Fabius Maximus, surnamed
Cunctator. He was the Roman general who, feeling that if he took on
Hannibal the great Carthaginian, he would get hammered, instead went for
a campaign of attrition, even when much of the Senate were urging him to
get stuck in. Cunctator means delayer.
Yesterday, we saw Fabius Major adopting the same tactics in perhaps
even more trying circumstances as he was being urged not to take just
one but two decisions and, as Hannibal Blair pointed out they were
diametrically opposed to each other..
Some, like Sir Teddy Heath say he must promise now to join a single
European currency. Some, like Sir Teddy Taylor, say he must promise now
never to join one. You please one Teddy, you outrage the other.
Worse, some of the Cabinet are keen on one option, some on the other.
What is a chap to do? Give leadership, urged Hannibal Blair, and Scipio
Ashdown. But like Fabius Maximus, Fabius Major feels that to take the
plunge now would be to invite disaster with one's army fighting even
more publicly among themselves and Hannibal Blair being enabled to carry
out the political equivalent of the Sack of Rome.
He had to squirm through an excellent though easily written forensic
speech in which he was asked which of his Ministers' differing views he
agreed with and, unable to respond when one of his own quotations on
Europe was read out, heard his opponent remark to great chortles from
his soldiery and soldierettes that ''the Right Honourable Gentleman
can't even say if he agrees with himself.''
Enjoying his own speech, Mr Blair declared: ''Anyone would think I'm
asking him to do something quite extraordinary. I'm simply asking him to
agree with his Chancellor.'' Being at the heart of Europe or retreating
from it were both coherent policies, said Hannibal. ''What is
unacceptable is to have no direction at all.''
In the midst of all this flashy swordplay, it was quite easy for him
to slip in a sentence saying that he favoured a single currency if the
economic circumstances were right.
This, in fact, is probably Mr Major's policy as well, although he
always feels obliged to say that if the economic circumstances were not
right he would not join. That also, the Sketch thinks, is Mr Blair's
position, but not being in government, he has more leeway in not having
to set that out.
Yesterday, though, Mr Major was obliged like the earlier Fabius to
make the best case he could for delay -- not running away but not
charging into battle either.
One reason for his tactics is undoubtedly the political one. His party
might well split if he said a definite Yes or No at this point. After
even delaying himself getting to the best bit of his speech, he argued
that the evidence for a definite decision simply does not exist at the
moment and that the best course in the national interest was to wait.
In the sarcastic words applied by Churchill to earlier leaders, he was
''resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift.'' Indeed, he rather
bravely said that he was refusing to take a decision now as a matter of
public policy.
Refusing to make up your mind can never be the basis of a great
parliamentary performance. He gave a careless answer to Mr James
Molyneaux, which made the Ulstermen look even grimmer and when Mr Blair
yet again asked him if he agreed with his Chancellor that a single
currency did not threaten the nation state he was driven to the not very
glorious response: ''You are trying to tie this up into tiny little
parcels.''
If it is possible to vacillate doggedly, that is what he did and if
inglorious it may not have been ignoble or unwise. After all, when the
Romans made up their minds to attack and dumped Fabius they were
annihilated in battle and had to call him back. The Tories who may be
thinking of dumping Fabius Major should perhaps recall that in the end
Cunctator was successful and his epitaph reads ''Unus homo nobis
cunctando restituit rem -- ''One man by delaying restored our
fortunes.''

<TEXT>
TORY former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath last night warned John
Major that a referendum on a European single currency would be
''unthinkable''.
Speaking soon after the Prime Minister told the Commons that he was
keeping the referendum option open, Sir Edward demanded: ''What's going
to happen to our own currency while we spend four or six weeks stomping
up and down the country arguing whether we should go in or stay out?''
The currency speculators would react to every opinion poll, he warned in
the Labour-led debate.
' He said that the Conservative Party always had opposed referendums:
''I don't want to depart from that principle.''
Sir Edward urged Mr Major to launch a fresh campaign to tell the
British people about the benefits of EU membership.
He said there were now five world powers: the US, Russia, China, Japan
-- and the EU.
''What chance have we got against those powers unless we are in the
Union?'' he asked.
''And what chance has the Union got unless we put our whole hearts
into it, and souls into it, and minds into it, and make it the success
which it deserves to be?''
Sir Edward protested: ''Not a single good thing has been said about
Europe and the EU by the Government or its representatives over the past
15 years.
''We have had nothing but condemnation, quite unjustified, and no
information for the public as to the good things.''
He told Mr Major: ''I would ask you to set in hand at this moment a
fresh campaign to tell them all the good things which come from the
Union.

AS he scraped home in the crucial Commons debate on Europe last night,
the Prime Minister left doubts over his policy on a single currency and
he struggled to avoid answering Mr Blair's central challenge: ''My
position is clear -- is the Prime Minister's?
Although the Government defeated by five votes, a Labour motion
condemning the Government's policy towards the European Union, former
Tory Chancellor Norman Lamont stunned colleagues by marching into the
lobby with Labour -- serving notice on Mr Major that Tory divisions over
Europe are far from over.
Mr Major said that a single currency would mean sweeping economic and
constitutional changes whether Britain joined it or stayed out.
Before a packed Commons Chamber, Mr Major repeatedly refused to say
whether he thought a single currency would threaten the British nation
state. Instead, he said it was too early to know its effects.
Under pressure from Labour and some of his own back benchers, Mr Major
said: ''For that reason, I believe it is in our own national and
economic interests to keep open the option of going into a single
curency and, equally, to keep open the option of deciding it will not be
in our national interest if we go in.''
He promised he would not accept any change in Britain's position that
would threaten its right to veto, and conceded that a referendum might
be necessary if an issue of ''great constitutional importance'' arose
over a single currency.
However, it was on the Government's policy on a single currency that
Mr Major refused to be drawn. ''I make no apology now or will in the
future for deciding as an act of policy, in the interests of this
country, that we should not make such a decision without the facts at
our disposal to know what the right answer is,'' he said.
Joining a single currency would require fixing exchange rates, making
the Bank of England independent and handing control of monetary policy
to a cental European bank. ''One can see the turbulence and difficulty
of moving forward in this direction,'' he said.
''Such changes would be the most sweeping changes in fiscal and
monetary management which this House, with its history of control, of
supply, had ever considered and accepted in all its long and proud
history.
''I am wary of a single currency for these economic reasons, wary of
its economic impact, wary of the serious political and constitutional
implications as well.
''If some of our partners do go ahead, there will be implications for
this country in any event, albeit different ones. There is no way we can
sit out this argument without it affecting us in one way or another. If
we go in, we have the changes I have set out. But if we stay out, there
are serious implications to consider as well.''
Mr Lamont asked if Mr Major agreed with another former Tory Chancellor
Lord Lawson that monetary union inevitably meant political union -- or
with Mr Clarke, who said monetary union was possible without political
union.
To Opposition jeers, Mr Major replied: ''With one important
qualification, I do believe that it is possible to move forward to
monetary union without necessarily moving forward to political union.
''But the qualification depends on the nature and style of monetary
union.''
Mr Lamont raised the matter again, during the wind-up by Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd, saying: ''This is an issue of principle.''
Mr Blair's speech opening the debate brought cheers from his
backbenchers. He appeared at ease, mixing jokes with savage ripostes to
the interruptions from the Tory benches.
He said the choice facing Britain was between being at the heart of
Europe or on the sidelines.
When challenged by Mr Lamont over Labour's policy reversal on Europe,
Mr Blair said:.
''I would prefer to be leading a party that was anti-European and is
now pro-European than leading a party that was pro-European and is
becoming anti-European,'' he said.
Tory Euro-rebels appeared to dominate the party, he said, while its
pro-Europeans appear increasingly beleaguered.
He reviewed recent statements on Europe by Government Ministers and
said the Cabinet was in disarray. ''We are therefore in the
extraordinary position that Government Ministers, including the chief
economic spokesman of the Government of Britain, can't speak on a vital
issue of national importance.''
To an interruption on the need for a referendum from Euro-rebel MP Sir
Teddy Taylor, Mr Blair said: ''A referendum does not in the end absolve
you of the need to decide what your position is on these matters. A
referendum is a means of obtaining popular consent. It is not a
substitute for government.''
In a series of questions, he asked Mr Major if he agreed with his
Cabinet colleagues' various opinions on Europe. ''Do you agree with your
Chancellor that a single currency is not a threat to the nation state? I
say that your Chancellor is right. I assume you say the same.''
When Tory MPs began shouting ''This isn't a quiz'' Mr Blair retorted:
''It's precisely to hold the Prime Minister to account that we've called
this debate. Anyone would think I was asking him to do something quite
extraordinary. I'm merely asking him to agree with his own Chancellor.''
The Cabinet was divided on an issue of constitutional importance.
''These are not people, postponing the decision on a single currency.
They are merely postponing the fight over which side wins. And that is
not in the interests of Britain.''
The anti-European view would prevail if it was not challenged, Mr
Blair said. ''What is defeatist is to believe that Britain's identity is
so fragile, its character so weak, its will so unimpressive, that we
cannot cooperate in Europe without destroying ourselves as a nation.
''I reject that view. And I say that this country should be and can be
a leader of nations in Europe. That is its destiny. It should be leading
in Europe. And it can lead in Europe, but only under a different
government.''
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said he believes some of Mr
Major's words would ''come back to haunt him later on''.
He insisted: ''The Prime Minister asks us to vote tonight to express
our confidence in the policies of the Government on Europe. To do so
would require either a blind loyalty to the Conservative Party or
suspension of judgment, or probably both.
''The Government's policy on Europe has been frankly a catastrophe for
the Conservative Party and a tragedy for the country.''
Europe was the most important issue facing Britain but it had been
''dragged down to an internal spat in the Conservative Party. about how
far the Prime Minister is willing to appease a tiny minority of his own
right wing''.
He also warned Mr Blair that Labour had a large group of rebels too
who would not agree with their leader's view on a single currency.
Leading Tory Euro-sceptic Bill Cash (Stafford) -- who abstained in the
vote on the Labour motion -- said: ''I heard the Prime Minister's speech
today with some misgivings and sadness.
''I believed we had a tremendous opportunity today to hear a speech
which would have defined a new way forward for a new Europe, instead of
which it was effectively an endorsement of the position under the
Maastricht Treaty itself.
''Unless and until we renegotiate that treaty, I fear we are locked
into a legal framework from which there is no escape.
''What I was looking for today was a commitment that we would not have
a single currency at all in principle.''
There were profoundly good economic reasons as well as political
reasons for rejecting a single currency.
''But above all else, it is a question of principle. It is a question
of the democracy of the UK and the question is: who governs Britain?''
Whipless Tory Christopher Gill (Ludlow) -- who also abstained -- said
popular opinion on Europe was being ignored.
Mr Gill said he had been inundated with thousands of letters, the
majority saying three things: ''We agree with you, thank goodness
someone is at last standing up for what we believe in, don't give in.''
Most signed at the end with words like ''Disillusioned Tory, ex-party
worker or former Tory voter''.
He warned: ''The Government must listen to the people. Sooner or later
the political classes will have to obtain a mandate for their European
policies.''
Winding up for Labour, Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook accused Mr
Major of making ''a passionate speech for the don't knows''.
Returning to the question of sovereignty posed several times by Mr
Blair, he asked if the Prime Minister agreed with the Chancellor that a
single currency would not threaten British sovereignty?
''Given that he assured us that the Cabinet was united, if they are
united why can't he say in a spirit of unity that he agrees with his
Chancellor?'' Compared to the Prime Minister's speech, the Euro-rebels'
manifesto was a model of decisiveness, conviction and clarity.
Winding up for the Government, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said:
''The choice of a single currency or not is not now before the House. It
will not be before the House for five or six years at least.
''If and when that choice comes to us the Government will take that
choice and recommend it to Parliament in the light of all the facts
which are valid at the time. The facts at the time are not the hunch at
the present.''
To jeers Mr Hurd said that by calling the debate Labour had given the
Commons the chance to draw the line under divisions and discontents
which have been very real. ''There is a danger in constantly fighting
and refighting old battles,'' he said.

AT the end of the debate, the Government defeated the Opposition
motion condemning Ministers' policy on Europe by 319 to 314, a
Government majority of five.
A Ministers' amendment rejecting Labour's policy towards Europe then
was carried by 326 votes to 313, a Government majority of 13.
Five of the whipless Tory rebels abstained on the first vote. They
were: Mr Christopher Gill (Ludlow), Mr John Wilkinson
(Ruslip-Northwood), Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay), Sir Teddy Taylor
(Southend East) and Mr Tony Marlow (Northampton North). They were joined
by Mr Bill Cash (Stafford), who also abstained.
Those who voted with the Government on the first vote were Sir Richard
Body (Holland with Boston), Mr Michael Cartiss (Great Yarmouth), Mr
Richard Shepherd (Aldridge Brownhills) and Mr Nicholas Budgen
(Wolverhampton- South West).
The Ulster Unionists backed Labour in both votes.
During the deabte, Tory former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath warned
Mr Major that a referendum on a European single currency would be
''unthinkable'' and urged a fresh campaign on the benefits of EU
membership.
Sir Edward said of a referendum: ''What's going to happen to our own
currency while we spend four or six weeks stomping up and down the
country arguing whether we should go in or stay out?''
The collapse of Barings bank would be ''child's play'' compared with
what currency speculators could achieve in those circumstances.
Mr Marlow said afterwards he did not think it was now possible for the
Government to recommend a single currency. ''There is no way we could
ever consider going for a single currency before the year 2000. We are
still miles away from the popular concerns about Europe,'' he said.
Sir Teddy Taylor said the Government, the Opposition and the whole of
Parliament was split over Europe. ''Why can't we put an end to all this
business by letting the people of this country have their say in a
referendum,'' he said.
Liberal Democrat European spokesman Charles Kennedy described it as a
hollow, pyrrhic victory for the Government. ''Despite all the hype they
just scraped home,'' he said.

A CONSERVATIVE peer claimed last night that the lack of public
information on the threatened Fort William sleeper service had caused
problems to the travelling arrangements of senior Tory party members.
Lord Pearson of Rannoch outlined the difficulties his friends,
including Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, have
had trying to get to the peer's Perthshire home.
He said that he also had to help out the former Home Secretary, Mr
Kenneth Baker, and the Chief Whip, Mr Richard Ryder, with details for
trips north.
Lord Pearson, who has spoken out against the axing of the Fort William
sleeper service in the House of Lords, said that bad marketing had led
to the service making a loss.
He said: ''Many people don't even know the sleeper service exists.
''I tell friends like Jonathan Aitken not to have his secretary call
Euston station any more for information.
''Guests who have come here in the last 18 months have had all sorts
of wrong information given to them from Euston station.
''One lot were told there was no direct service and they had to change
trains at quarter to four in the morning in Glasgow. They were told they
would have to get off at Central Station and walk across town to Queen
Street.
''Others were told the sleeper service to Fort William didn't exist.
Another group said they would have to go up to Inverness first.
''There is no wonder the service, which is a valuable one, is making a
loss when nobody knows it exists.
''At this time of year they should be targeting skiers from the
South-east of England.
''Many of these people don't even know there is a direct link from
London to Fort William where they could go skiing.
''Thousands could be leaving on the sleeper on Friday night and going
back on the Sunday night sleeper to London.''
A spokesman for Inter-City West Coast said he was amazed at Lord
Pearson's comments.
The spokesman said: ''Although the marketing of the sleeper service
becomes the responsiblity of ScotRail from Monday, we have been
marketing it all the way up until now.
''We have a very professional team in place at Euston station giving
out information and we are delighted with the work they do.
''As far as skiers are concerned we have made a conscious effort to
make sure they know all about the service to Fort William and had a
massive campaign to tell them about the service at the start of this
year.''
Meanwhile, pressure from train drivers for a strike ballot over pay
will be unstoppable unless British Rail makes an offer above the rate of
inflation, their union leader warned yesterday, writes Roy Rogers.
Aslef members had already indicated by an ''overwhelming majority''
that they were prepared to take industrial action to achieve a
''substantial'' rise, BR was told.
The warning by Mr Lew Adams, the general secretary of the Amalgamated
Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, came as leaders of the
three main rail unions, representing 115,000 workers, met BR bosses for
the opening talks on this year's settlement.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and
Transport union, said executive board members had seen their performance
bonus payments rise by 21.9% over the past year, while productivity of
rail staff had increased by 5.2%, yet they were still the lowest-paid
rail workers in Europe.
0 The basic weekly wage of a train driver is #215.90 although average
earnings are more than #400 with nine hours overtime. Rail operators
have a basic of #149.65, with senior conductors on #181.20.

THE National Savings Bank yesterday announced 322 redundancies
throughout the UK. Fifty-one of them are in Scotland, at the Cowglen
complex in Glasgow.
A bank official said the cuts had all been achieved voluntarily. They
were necessary to comply with a cost-cutting campaign, announced last
year in a White Paper, which demanded savings of 3% in Government
departments and agencies.
However, a union official claimed the decision to let people go on
''an early release scheme'' would result in extra pressures on the
workers who remained.
The NSB's branch in Durham will bear the brunt of the cuts, with 207
of its 1570 workforce being cut. The 51 jobs will go from a total
workforce of 2313 at Cowglen, with 50 being lost in Blackpool and 14 in
London.
A bank official said an announcement seeking volunteers had been made
on January 16, and the required numbers had been achieved. Those who
applied for redundancy were told yesterday that they could leave.
The official said trades unions had been ''kept in the picture''. He
said there could be a further early release scheme in April next year,
although he declined to comment about what numbers might be involved.
Mr Colin Young, deputy branch secretary of the Civil and Public
Services Association at Cowglen, said: ''We are concerned that the
management plan to let people go through their early release scheme will
put extra pressure on the workers who remain.
''This decision basically amounts to a management admission that they
can't afford to pay those being made redundant because of the budgetary
problem brought on by the Government's cost-cutting campaign.''

THE publishers of the Daily Star newspaper yesterday were fined
#10,000 for contempt of court at the end of the Bonnyrigg murder trial
at the High Court, Edinburgh.
Lord Osborne found the Daily Star in contempt over a front-page story
published during the trial. The story headed ''Rat Faces Book Quiz''
involved Major James Hewitt, former companion of the Princess of Wales,
who was cited as a defence witness for Robert Smith, one of the accused
who was jailed for life.
Defence counsel Derek Ogg, for Smith, complained that the article
undermined Mr Hewitt's credibility. The front-page story stated: ''Royal
Rat James Hewitt faces a courtroom grilling over his kiss-and-tell
affair with Princess Diana''.
The allegation that the former Life Guards major was coming to give
evidence at the High Court, Edinburgh to ''aid a pal'' was only one of
seven inaccuracies in the story, he claimed.
Mr Ogg said Mr Hewitt had been compelled by citation to come to court
to give evidence on confidential service reports compiled on Smith, a
lance-corporal of Horse who had been a tank commander in Mr Hewitt's
squadron during the Gulf War. The article alleged Mr Hewitt would be
''quizzed'' by the prosecution about the book Princess in Love.
Lord Osborne cleared the editor and Scottish reporter of blame and
found the publishers, Express Newspapers, guilty of contempt of court
because of the risk of prejudice to a trial in progress. The court heard
that the reporter's copy had been altered in the London office.
Fining Express Newspapers #10,000 for contempt Lord Osborne said: ''I
have to regard any interference with the course of justice as a matter
which is serious . . . I am gratified to hear that arrangements have
been made by the publishers to introduce greater checks than previously
executed.''
Mr Neil Murray, QC, for Express Newspapers, said procedures had been
instituted and checks put in place to prevent any recurrence.

THE cult youth TV show, The Word, was criticised last night for
planning to take runaway schoolboy Peter Kerry on a free trip to the
United States today.
Peter, 14, of Harrow, north London, flew to Malaysia using his
father's passport and credit cards, sparking an international hunt and
fears for his safety.
The zany Channel 4 youth show has arranged another trip for him, with
presenter Danni Behr -- just 48 hours after he flew back to Heathrow.
But Mary Aspray, of the National Missing Persons Helpline, said The
Word was very irresponsible to award Peter ''this prize''.
She told Radio Five Live's Ruscoe on Five: ''We have been keeping an
eye on some of the children that may have gone missing this week because
of the glamour of Peter's trip.
''And we also feel we have many vulnerable missing children -- and yet
to get publicity for them is really difficult.''
Tory MP Harry Greenway said: ''This boy is being lionised. They should
not try to make a hero out of him, because he is certainly not a role
model for other children.''
A spokesman for The Word's makers, Planet 24, defended the trip,
saying: ''There are many, many TV companies who want Peter to appear on
camera.
''But we are doing it differently by giving him a trip to somewhere he
has never been and wants to see.''

<HEADLINE>The moment an armed gang brought terror to a bank. Life for the getaway killers</HEADLINE>

THREE killers who shot dead a brave grandfather, Mr David Dunn, in
their panic-stricken flight from a #185,000 bank robbery were jailed for
life yesterday.
Lord Osborne told Robert Smith, Gerald McQuade, and Paul Bootland:
''Tragically, David Dunn has paid with his life the price of assisting
in bringing you to justice.'' The judge also praised members of the
public whose courage foiled the escape.
Mr Dunn was shot in the chest by Smith at a range of no more than a
foot as he leaned into the robbers' getaway car and lashed out with a
bag of shopping.
After a 17-day trial at the High Court in Edinburgh the jury took more
than six hours, and an overnight hotel stay, to return guilty verdicts
against all three accused on charges of murder, attempted murder, and
bank robbery.
By majority verdicts they convicted Smith, 33; McQuade, 40; and
Bootland, 25, of murdering Mr Dunn, a 63-year-old retired mining
engineer in a car park at Bonnyrigg, Midlothian on October 19 last year.
The most difficult task for the jury was to decide whether all three
accused, including getaway driver Bootland, who never fired a shot, were
responsible for everything that happened. They decided that because all
three had gone on a bank raid armed with loaded weapons, each was
responsible for the other's actions.
All three were also convicted of attempting to murder off-duty
policeman John Duffy, along with Mr John Girdler and Mr Duncan Milliken,
two members of the public who risked their lives to help Detective
Constable Duffy thwart the escape.
They tried to shoot their way out of the car park near the Bank of
Scotland in High Street, Bonnyrigg, which Smith, a Life Guards
lance-corporal on the run, and McQuade had robbed of #185,000 moments
earlier.
If Bootland had not stalled the car, the gang might have escaped,
sparing Mr Dunn's life.
The judge saw grounds for distinguishing between them, given that
McQuade, of Prospecthill Road, Toryglen, Glasgow, had a criminal record;
Bootland, of Greenend Grove, Edinburgh, had played a comparatively small
part in the robbery; and Smith, on the run from the Army, was a first
offender with an exemplary Army record.
For the robbery charge he jailed McQuade for 20 years, Smith for 15
and Bootland for 10.
The judge went on: ''The sequel to the robbery was of course the
appalling series of events in the nearby car park. Through the
courageous and commendable intervention of members of the public your
escape was fortunately foiled.
''In this connection I should like to recognise publicly the bravery
of the late David Dunn, of John Duffy, John Girdler and Duncan Milliken.
Also, of course, I recognise the valiant efforts of the two security
staff, Robert Bourhill and Ronald Allan.''
Mr Bourhill and Mr Allan were the Securicor men robbed at gunpoint in
the bank on October 19. They chased Smith and McQuade as they made their
escape. Lord Osborne added: ''You, Smith and McQuade, were prepared
callously to make use of the loaded firearms in your possession in order
to make good your escape, an action which I can only describe as
contemptible.''
For murdering Mr Dunn, he jailed all three for life, the only sentence
open to him.
For the attempted murder of Mr Duffy, McQuade, who actually fired the
shots, was jailed for 12 years; Smith for eight; and Bootland for six.
For the attempted murders of Mr Duffy, Mr Milliken, and Mr Girdler,
who were fired at by Smith, Smith got 12 years; McQuade eight; and
Bootland six.
The judge gave all three five years each for firearms offences and
ordered all the sentences to run concurrently. He chose not to recommend
a minimum sentence to be served on the murder charge.
During the trial, the jury heard how the bank raid itself had gone
like clockwork. Smith, a Gulf war tank commander, and McQuade had
calculated that it would take them no more than a minute. In the event,
they were in and out of the bank in 55 seconds.
From then on things went badly and, for Mr Dunn, tragically wrong.
The raiders could never have dreamed that so many ordinary citizens of
Bonnyrigg would be prepared to ''have a go'' and turn their flight into
a fiasco.
The shoot-out in the car park could easily have claimed several more
lives. McQuade fired his Webley revolver twice at DC Duffy at point
blank range as the off-duty policeman grappled with him: amazingly, the
only physical injury was a powder burn to the policeman's hand.
When the revolver was exmamined later two bullets were lodged in the
barrel.
Then, after Duffy, Girdler and Milliken, had pinned the struggling
McQuade to the ground, Smith shot at them three times from the getaway
car with a pistol he had smuggled back from the Gulf.
Again, the gun failed to work properly. Tests later revealed it also
had a fault.
Ironically, Bootland's Browning semi-automatic pistol appeared to be
the only gun working properly, and it was never fired.
After the verdict, Lord Osborne told the three men: ''You have been
convicted of an armed robbery of serious character which was plainly
executed after careful planning some time in advance.
''A considerable number of security staff, bank employees and members
of the public were assaulted and no doubt terrified by their having
presented at them firearms. The result was the abstraction from the bank
of a very substantial sum of money which happily has been recovered.
''Your crime as regards the robbery can only be seen as one of the
most grave of its kind involving an outright defiance of the criminal
law and of all decent standards of conduct, carried out in furtherance
of your own greed.
''For that, in my opinion, you must be severely punished.''

CHURCH of Scotland headquarters staff have been given an early warning
of possible redundancies that could follow sweeping changes of emphasis
in the Kirk's work being called for at the General Assembly in May.
The changes, following a review of the work of the Kirk's boards by
the Assembly Council, would come into force in two years' time.
In its report to the Assembly, the council highlights the threat of
job losses being required, saying that it believes that the Kirk would
want to give as much notice as possible to staff who might need to look
for other work.
If the Assembly agrees, the board of stewardship and finance will be
directed to consider what redundancy deals could be offered.
The main thrust of the proposals is to give priority to getting the
Christian message over to the people of Scotland, which would involve
more training and support for the ordained ministry and field staff.
The changes would affect the boards of ministry, national mission,
world mission and communication.
Around #400,000 would be added to the maintenance of the ministry
committee's budget and #70,000 to that of national mission for fieldwork
at parish level. But national mission would lose #180,000 which supports
its industrial and university chaplaincy work and the society, religion
and technology project.
The communication board would have #100,000 mission and aid support
chopped in 1997 and be required to make economies in its publicity,
audio visual and publishing sections.
World mission would lose #140,000 and have to cut back in Europe and
Israel.
Virtually all other boards and committees would see their present
budgets preserved, but they would be tied in the future to the ups and
downs of the mission and aid fund.
The report also urges kirk sessions to strive to reverse the emptying
of the pews, and congregational financial boards are told that they must
convince members to put more in the collection plate.

THE Football Supporters Association in England yesterday criticised
the tactics of the Belgian police, accusing them of ''incompetence''.
Trouble broke out again this week at Chelsea's Cup Winners Cup game in
Bruges, with 354 fans arrested and expelled between Monday and the match
last night.
Hundreds of visiting fans were also thrown in the cells just hours
before the game with Club Brugge.
FSA international officer Steve Beauchampe said: ''By any standards,
the police's behaviour was wholly unacceptable.
''It was the culmination of several days of indiscriminate policing,
which time and again failed to distinguish between would-be
trouble-makers and genuine supporters.
''A catalogue of aggression and incompetence is building up. Fans had
tickets confiscated and ripped up, supporters were forced to leave
possessions in their hotels and deported, and fans aged from 16 to 60
locked up without having committed any offence.''
Coming a month after Dublin, where England's game with the Republic of
Ireland was abandoned after 27 minutes because of rioting fans, the
issue of keeping English supporters at home has again raised its head.
The National Federation of Football Supporters' Clubs is adamant that
must not happen.
Chairman Tony Kershaw said: ''The nutters would travel abroad anyway,
like they did when England played in Poland, and pick up tickets easily.
''The priority has to be to root out these maverick fans and stop them
travelling early. Then perhaps the genuine fans won't have to suffer
like they did in Dublin and Bruges.''

POLICE are concerned as to the whereabouts of a student who was last
seen leaving a party in Dundee's Cowgate, in the early hours of Saturday
morning.
The disappearance of Mr Alan Greenwood, 35, a post-graduate computer
studies student has worried his flatmate at Dundee University's Wimberly
residences.
Mr Greenwood is 5ft 10in, of slim build, and when last seen was
wearing a maroon jacket, green jersey, and black corduroy trousers.
Flatmate Rauls Velins, a 33-year-old medical education student from
Latvia, said: ''Nobody knew Alan very well, we have no idea where he has
gone.''

POLICE are investigating possible links between child-killer Robert
Black and the murder of a nine-year-old girl in Northern Ireland nearly
14 years ago.
Last week, the Appeal Court in London dismissed Black's application
for leave to challenge his conviction on three counts of murder and
kidnapping.
Several police forces, including the Royal Ulster Constabulary, are
now set to interview Black about a number of unsolved cases.
It is understood that Black, 47, who worked as a van driver delivering
posters nationwide, made a trip to Belfast within days of Jennifer
Cardy's abduction. She went missing a few miles away at Ballinderry,
County Antrim, in 1981, while cycling to meet a friend.
Black was found guilty last year of the murders of Susan Maxwell, 11,
Caroline Hogg, five, and Sarah Harper, 10, and the kidnapping of Teresa
Thornhill, then 15.
He was sentenced to three life prison terms, with the recommendation
that he serve a minimum of 35 years. He was already serving life for the
abduction and sexual assault of a six-year-old girl who was found bound
and gagged in his van in July 1990.

EXCLUSIVE
THE Labour Party leadership's case for reform of Clause 4 at next
week's Scottish conference in Inverness has been thrown into turmoil by
a procedural hitch.
A key aspect of Labour leader Tony Blair's reforming stance was the
alternative wording drafted by one of his trusted Scots lieutenants,
Cunninghame North MP Brian Wilson. This was proposed by his constituency
as an amendment to a conference resolution defending Clause 4, submitted
by the Co-op Party in Scotland.
A straight choice would have been put before the conference between
the two contrasting viewpoints -- a motion defending the party's
tradition versus a modernising amendment taking the party into the next
century.
However, the last-minute withdrawal of the Co-op motion means the
crucial amendment is stuck in limbo. Last night, party officials and
conference managers were frantically looking for ways to get the Wilson
wording back on to the conference agenda.
The original statement of aims demands: ''To secure for the workers by
hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most
equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of
the common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and
exchange and the best obtainable system of popular administration and
control of each industry and service.''
Mr Wilson's alternative, penned during a train journey and using the
same number of words, reads: ''To enhance the birthright of every
citizen to fulfil his or her potential consistent with social justice
and the equitable distribution of wealth; to cast out poverty, nurture
enterprise, and promote common ownership; cherish and advance democracy;
all in order to bequeath to the next generation a better world than the
one we inherited.''
Party managers looked at the 26 motions on Clause 4 intended for
Inverness, which are overwhelmingly hostile to change, and decided that
they would seek to amend the motion by the Co-op Party in Scotland.
This opened by welcoming the modernising process but then said changes
to the party constitution ''shouldn't be carried in the mistaken belief
that the principles contained in Clause 4 are electorally unpopular''.
It added that the clause is of ''vital importance if we are to retain
the confidence of all our present supporters and gain the support of
those electors who crave an alternative to 16 years of Tory misery''.
It was planned to add Mr Wilson's alternative wording to this motion,
with the blessing of Mr Blair's team of advisers. However the Co-op
party, following national discussions, has asked its Scottish section to
withdraw the original motion.
A sources at the Scottish Labour Party headquarters in Glasgow said
yesterday: ''We have to examine the rule book on this. There is a valid
argument that if a motion is moved and accepted in good faith, and then
an amendment is accepted in good faith, should the amendment fall if the
motion is withdrawn?''
On Monday night, the standing orders committee of the party will meet
and it may be down to it to sort out a procedural wrangle which
threatens to damage the ability of Mr Blair's leadership to get its
arguments across at a forum in Inverness which is already set to be
hostile.

<HEADLINE>Diver made five suicide bids, inquiry is told</HEADLINE>

A DIVER who died during an operation to recover smuggled drugs from a
wreck off the Scottish coast had made five attempts to kill himself, a
fatal accident inquiry heard yesterday.
In the 18 months before his death, Mr Stewart Locke, 24, tried to
slash his wrists and took an overdose of paracetamol, the inquiry was
told.
Mr Locke, from Strichen, Aberdeenshire, died during an operation to
recover #20m worth of cannabis off Scotstown beach on October 13, 1993.
He left a widow, Claire, and two young children.
The inquiry, at Peterhead, has heard that his safety and communication
lines appeared to have been deliberately cut during the fatal dive and
that he had removed his air tank and helmet.
Dr R A Ramaswami, a medical adviser with the Health and Safety
Executive and an expert on diving medicine, said yesterday Mr Locke had
attempted suicide in April 1992.
''Mr Locke was seen by a psychiatrist following an attempt to slash
his wrists,'' he said.
The diver was also admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in February
1993 after taking an overdose of paracetamol and half a bottle of vodka,
the inquiry heard.
Mr Gordon McGregor, solicitor for Mr Locke's employers, J. Allan
Diving Services, asked Dr Ramaswami: ''It would be fair to say there are
five attempted suicides disclosed in the medical notes of Mr Locke?''
The doctor agreed.
Dr Ramaswami said the only reasons for the suicide attempts in the
medical notes were a fragmented upbringing and domestic problems.
He said Mr Locke did not have a proper medical certificate for diving.
But Mr Alex Thomson, a partner in J Allan Diving Services, said Mr Locke
had shown him an up-to-date medical certificate.
Mr Thomson said he left instructions with Mr Locke not to dive that
day; there had been an ''atmosphere'' between his team and the police
divers.
Constable Douglas McGillivray, 47, a diving supervisor with Grampian
police, was also questioned about the possibility of suicide.
Mr McGregor said the diver had removed his air tanks and helmet while
keeping on his weight belt.
Under re-examination by depute procurator-fiscal Ray Craig, Constable
McGillivray said he would never remove his face mask. ''I would rather
suffocate than drown,'' he said.
The inquiry, before Sheriff Frank Keane, continues.

NEARLY #22m of European aid was yesterday approved for projects in the
Highlands and Islands under the Objective One programme.
They included #3.48m to Stornoway Pier and Harbour Commission and the
Western isles Council for a new ferry terminal in Stornoway; #1.725m to
the council and Caledonian MacBrayne for a ferry and terminal for a new
Sound of Harris service; and #2m to Mallaig Harbour Authority for a
breakwater.
The Goverment said the moves answered the programme's critics.
The Highlands and Islands Minister, Lord James Douglas Hamilton, said:
''These decisions will ensure that the Highlands and Islands will feel
the benefits from the Objective One Programme. We now have almost 500
projects funded, the perfect answer to the jaded Jeremiahs who claim
Objective One money is being wasted.''

THE proposed electricity interconnector between Scotland and Nothern
Ireland will only benefit the power companies and not the people of
South Ayrshire, a public inquiry was told yesterday.
The inquiry in Ayr, which is expected to end next week, was told by
members of the Stop the Overhead Powerlines (Stop) campaign that the
project will have severe consequences for farming, forestry, and
tourism, on which the local economy is almost wholly dependent.
In his closing submission, Stop's Mr Struan Stevenson told the inquiry
that, given the level of opposition to the project, especially among
those who will be directly affected by it, serious consideration must be
given to those concerns.
ScottishPower and Northern Ireland Electricity are applying jointly to
build a 40-mile line of pylons to take electricity from Coylton near Ayr
to the coast at Ballantrae, and an undersea cable to take it to the
Antrim coast.
Mr Stevenson added: ''The level of compensation being offered by the
applicants is woefully inadequate and completely fails to take into
account people involved in the tourist industry.
''It is wholly unacceptable that private companies like the applicants
should receive vast profits at the expense of entire communities,
especially when these communities will suffer economic disbenefits and
receive no share of the profits.''
Mr Stevenson was speaking on the closing days of the inquiry before
Scottish Office Reporter James McCulloch, which has been running since
the beginning of October. Council representatives are expected to sum up
tomorrow, with counsel for the applicants, Mr Donald Mackay, QC,
beginning his final submissions next week.
Mr Stevenson said: ''The environmental cost, especially given the
current climate of sustainable development, is far too high. Imposing
pylons and powerlines across areas of such outstanding beauty is nothing
less than sacrilege.
''In the balance between environment and economy, it is clear that the
financial benefits for the applicants have taken priority. This is
contrary to all principles of environmental awareness. The environment
is a natural resource, it should not be destroyed in the pursuit of
private profit.
Mr Stevenson, assisted by colleague Mr Denis Sullivan and advocate Mr
Gordon Steel, argued that there is a variety of other ways to meet the
electricity needs of Northern Ireland, some of which have not been
properly evaluated, and the proposal does not fit well with EU or UK
Government policies.
He concluded: ''This is not a paper exercise. We are dealing with a
matter which affects people's lives. Why should the people of Ayrshire
suffer so that the applicants can increase their profits.
''The Secretary of State is under an obligation to decide whether this
project will be of benefit to Scotland. Clearly the people of Ayrshire
do not believe any benefit will come of it.''

THE SNP president, Mrs Winnie Ewing, is facing a backlash from local
activists in Perth and Kinross over her role in the downfall of Roseanna
Cunningham as candidate in the by-election.
There is now talk in the area of putting up a candidate to oppose her
as president when the party meets in Perth in September for its annual
conference.
Such a move would have no chance of success, given Mrs Ewing's power
base within the party. However, the post is usually confirmed unopposed
and forcing it to a vote would be a way of signifying displeasure over
the events of recent days.
There were indications from party headquarters in Edinburgh last night
that this was seen as talk spurred by short-term frustration and that,
in the longer term, such action was unlikely.
However, Saturday's national conference in Stirling seems certain to
be a stormy affair, with many activists bitter that Ms Cunningham, who
previously ran the Conservatives to within around 2000 votes in the
constituency, should lose out because of unfair and unfounded
allegations about her private life dating back 18 years.
She withdrew after the allegations were made during the selection
meeting at the weekend and were subsequently leaked. An internal inquiry
has already been ordered into the procedures and the eight members of
the election committee can expect a tough time this weekend over their
handling of the process of reducing the six applicants to a short-list
of three.
Mr Michael Russell, chief executive of the party, said he expected
unity in the run-up to the by-election, in which the SNP is favourite to
gain from the Conservatives following the death of Sir Nicholas
Fairbairn. Thereafter, he believed the row would eventually blow over.
''The important thing here is to identify what is real and what is
transitory and focus on what is real and lasting,'' he said.

INWARD investment agency officials yesterday dismissed speculation
that the Government encouraged Scotland to pull out of a battle to
attract a #100m factory, in the belief that the project would then go to
Northern Ireland.
The Hewlett-Packard plant, which will manufacture printer ink
cartridges and create 1150 jobs over the next four years, has been
landed by the Republic of Ireland.
As reported in The Herald earlier this week, reports in Dublin
suggested that Scottish Enterprise had been competing against the Irish
Industrial Development Authority, the Northern Ireland Development
Board, and the Dutch authorities for the project, but that the Scots had
baffled Dublin officials by pulling out of the race.
A spokesman for Scottish Enterprise's inward investment arm, Locate in
Scotland, yesterday confirmed that it had tried to secure the project,
but he added: ''There is absolutely no truth at all in suggestions that
Scotland was asked to back off.'' It had remained in the race, he said.

A REVIEW of all records of 40,000 women who have attended the East of
Scotland Breast Screening Centre at Dundee Royal Infirmary since 1989
has been carried out without the glare of publicity.
It follows flaws after a woman who was diagnosed as having breast
cancer lost almost two years of treatment because of a mistake made at
the infirmary.
Dundee Teaching Hospitals Trust disclosed last night that, after a
routine check on the woman's screening history last December, it was
discovered that there had been ''a procedural error'' at the infirmary's
breast-screening centre in February 1993.
''The woman should have been recalled for assessment following
screening, and she was not. She has now been receiving treatment,'' a
spokesman said.
Five more ''procedural errors'' have been discovered. However, the
spokesman said that the five had all been contacted and no further
cancers had been identified.
''There are no further women yet to be approached,'' he added. He went
on to say that breast-screening was a complex and high-turnover
programme, but errors of the kind involved in the case were very
unusual.
''This was a mistake in procedures, not in the interpreting of the
mammogram,'' he said.
He explained that the review carried out after the error was
discovered was undertaken without publicity because of the right to
confidentiality of the patient in question.
It was the ''clear clinical opinion of the doctors treating her that
she should not be told until the appropriate time in her treatment''.
The trust's medical director, Dr Derek MacLean, said: ''We very much
regret this error. We have acted throughout on clear, clinical advice
and have carried out the fullest of checks on all other records.
''Every effort has been made to ensure a system in which all women
using the service can have the fullest confidence.''

MOTHER-OF-TWO Mrs Linda Stone did not think it was worthtravelling 30
miles to have her favourite painting valued by Antiques Roadshow
experts.
However, her sister, Mrs Debbie Murchison, took the picture along when
the show visited Inverness, and on Sunday millions of viewers will watch
one of the most astonishing ''investments'' in the history of the BBC
programme.
For the picture Mrs Stone, from Grantown-on-Spey, Moray, bought for
just 50p at a car-boot sale three years earlier, turned out to be a
minor masterpiece.
The oil painting, titled Mischief, shows a 19th century living-room
scene with a terrier snuggled contentedly on an armchair while a cat and
kittens play in the background.
Viewers will see Roadshow expert Peter Nahum tell Mrs Murchison the
painting, by Belgian artist Henrietta Ronner-Nip (1821-1909) could fetch
#15,000 at auction.
However, Mrs Stone collected a cheque for #22,000, equivalent to a
4.4m% increase in value within three years, when it went under the
hammer at a Christie's auction in Glasgow.
Now a blown-up photograph of the painting adorns the living-room wall
of Mrs Stone's family home, which she shares with her council
works-supervisor husband, Richard, and sons Rory, 14, and Fraser, 12 .
Mrs Stone said yesterday: ''To say that I was surprised when my Debbie
told me about the painting would be a gross understatement. I frankly
did not think that anything we had was worth very much. But, just like
many other people, we thought it was worth taking advantage of the
Antiques Roadshow's rare visit to the Highlands just in case . . .''

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang yesterday dismissed calls for an
investigation into his handling of a plan to create a huge rubbish dump
on the outskirts of Newton Mearns, near Glasgow.
Last month, the European Commission announced that the Scottish Office
appeared to be in breach of European Union directives in its treatment
of the plan to develop the dump at Pilmuir Quarry.
That prompted Strathclyde West Euro-MP Hugh McMahon, who has long
campaigned against the development, to write to Prime Minister John
Major demanding an investigation into the conduct of Mr Lang and other
Scottish Office Ministers.
However, Mr Lang yesterday repeated the Scottish Office's assertion
that it does not accept that it has breached any EU directive, and he
denied there was any need for an inquiry into his handling of the case.
In a letter to the Euro-MP, Mr Lang explained that the Prime Minister
had asked him to reply as the matter fell within the Scottish
Secretary's responsibilities.
Mr Lang wrote: ''Your letter contends that in dealing with this case,
the Government has breached several EU directives, that it has ignored
warnings from you, and that an inquiry is needed into its handling of
the case.
''I do not accept any of these contentions.''
In all cases involving effects on the environment, considerable care
and attention is given by competent authorities in Scotland, including
the Scottish Office, to ensuring that the requirements of EU law are
met. The Scottish Office's approach in the Pilmuir Quarry case had been
no less rigorous, he said.
He believed that an opinion given by an Advocate General in a case
recently considered by the European Court of Justice, concerning roads
in Bavaria, had ''largely vindicated'' the Scottish Office's
interpretation of EU law.
''It believes that the environmental implications of the proposed
development were satisfactorily examined during the planning process
and, accordingly, it remains firm in its view that, in this particular
case, there is no obligation to carry out an environmental impact
assessment.''
Mr Lang said he was aware that Mr McMahon had taken a close interest
in the case, but he did not agree that Mr McMahon had issued warnings
which he and his colleagues had ignored.
The Scottish Office had been aware for more than two years that the
Commission was considering complaints about the case, and had supplied
it with full details of the consideration given to it.
''There is, therefore, nothing to investigate at this stage. The
Commission has invited the UK to comment on alleged breaches of EU
directives which it will do.''

THE Prime Minister took the Commons with him last night on his
wait-and-see policy on Britain's future in Europe.
It had been a test of the Prime Minister's personal authority, which
he put on the line by deciding to lead for the Government in the debate.
Key majorities in two votes of five and 13 dispatched the prospect of
a crisis confidence motion in his Government today, which might have
further undermined sterling on the world markets.
The Commons votes presage a reconciliation between the Prime Minister
and his nine Tory rebels: five abstained in the first vote, and all
supported him in the second. This support was doubly welcome, because
the Ulster Unionists voted with Labour twice.
However, the previous Tory Chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, stunned MPs
by voting with Labour the first time, helping to reduce the Government
majority to five. But in the second vote Mr Lamont supported the
Government, contributing to a 13 majority.
Mr Lamont negotiated the Maastricht Treaty three years ago with Mr
Major, but turned against him in the first vote projected by Labour
declaring that the Prime Minister's European policy is against the
nationalist interest. Mr Lamont believes the Prime Minister was against
a single European currency in principle at the time of Maastricht and he
wanted to emphasise this change in Mr Major's position.
Before going into the Labour lobby, Mr Lamont was seen having an
animated discussion with Mr Michael Forsyth, Home Office Minister of
State, who appeared to be trying to persuade him to support the
Government.
Mr David Hunt, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said: ''I am
rather confused as to why Norman Lamont voted with the Labour Party.
After all he and John Major negotiated our opt out on the single
currency.''
Others were more forthright. One furious senior Minister dismissed him
as ''a shit and a spotty little runt''.
When the second vote came on Mr Major's amendment, claiming Labour's
policy on Europe is worse, the former Chancellor supported the Prime
Minister.
When asked later why he had voted against the Government, he said: ''I
listened to the speeches, I didn't believe what I heard. I asked various
questions, but I didn't believe the answers.''
The vote by the Ulster Unionists was an indication to the Prime
Minister that if he wishes to stay in power for another two years he has
to take them into account when he considers the next step in the
Northern Ireland peace process.
The Prime Minister has survived a test which he described to the
Commons as the biggest decision Britain will have to make this century.
Today, the Prime Minister will be relieved he is not facing a
challenge to his Government which might have brought on an early
election. And the pound can settle down to coping with the normal market
forces without a political crisis.
The votes had an immediate effect, financial markets reacting
positively to the Government's win, with the pound gaining 0.65 cents to
$1.5912 in Far East trading.
The judgment on Britain's long-term future in Europe, Mr Major
insisted, has to be taken on a global decision: political, economic, and
constitutional. Profound decisions will be based on stark pragmatic
assessments, he said.
Labour leader Tony Blair goaded Mr Major: ''You can either have
clarity without unity or unity without clarity, but you can't have
both.''
Mr Major responded: ''No-one can be entirely certain what the
implications of staying out of a single currency might be.''
He went on: ''For that reason, I believe it is in our own national and
economic interests to keep open the option of going into a single
currency and, equally, to keep open the option of deciding it will not
be in our national interest to go in.''
Mr Blair failed to pin down the Prime Minister on this issue. He
declared: ''There may well be debate as to what the policy should be.
But there must be a policy.
''There is only one choice -- to be at the heart of Europe or in
retreat from it. Both are coherent positions. But they take the country
in different directions. What is unacceptable is to have no direction at
all.''
Mr Major told him that such monumental decisions cannot be
parcelled-up. Decision time is a long way off, he said, and when the
time comes for it to be taken it will be after the next General Election
and for a different Parliament to decide. The Prime Minister agreed with
Mr Blair that whatever Cabinet is in power at the time the decision has
to be taken will have to carry the Commons and the nation.
He insisted his Government would maintain the freedom of choice he
obtained at Maastricht ''because the decision that may have to be taken
is the single most important economic decision that will have faced this
country this century.''
Mr Blair posed the key question calling for a decision in principle
from the Government -- does it support the idea of a single European
currency and a European bank? The Prime Minister said this is a question
that cannot be answered.
Mr Blair promoted the Commons debate last night in order to clarify Mr
Major's views of the principle and pragmatics of the Government's
approach to the apparent drive from a powerful majority of our European
partners for further integration of economic and political policy.
Mr Major detailed the massive difficulties that face the EU in
establishing a single currency.
He went as far as he could to tell his Euro-sceptics that he will veto
a single currency. Furthermore, if it comes to it in the next two years,
he will put the decision to the nation in one way or another.
The Prime Minister made it clear he would not move on this assessment
purely for short-term political interests and he challenged Mr Blair to
take a different attitude. Mr Blair did not oblige him by committing the
Labour Party to a single currency, or indeed further political
integration within the EU.

One boy's view: 'It's brilliant here, you learn stuff, they let you
chop logs and abseil'
SCOTTISH Militant Labour councillor Tommy Sheridan was yesterday
described as ''The Pied Piper of Pollok'' over his stance on
schoolchildren playing truant to join the M77 protesters.
At a meeting of Strathclyde Regional Council, Mr Ken Murray, a Labour
councillor said: ''School pupils are being led into danger. It appears
the Pied Piper of Pollok has been inducing hundreds of children to come
along and protest.''
He did not name Mr Sheridan, but there was no question in anyone's
mind whom he meant.
Mr Sheridan responded: ''I cannot even play the flute. And if that is
the level of response we are to get from a leading Strathclyde
politician, then it's no wonder we are in the mess we are in at
Pollok.''
Mr Sheridan, district councillor for Pollok, said he did not believe
any pupil's decision to join the protesters was dangerous. He said it
would only be dangerous if Wimpey did not follow the proper precautions
and stop work as soon as the safe boundaries were broken.
Mr Sheridan said: ''If a 14-year-old was killed or seriously injured
it would have nothing to do with the M77 protest, but it would be a
tragedy to the parents and the community and to try and relate the loss
of life to the success of a campaign is just totally irresponsible.''
However one spokesman for the ''Pollok Free State'' admitted a
fatality could destroy the campaign. He said that because of the huge
size of the children's support a safety officer would be appointed.
He said: ''The children are more powerful than we are, all they need
is a little training. We'll be training them in non-violent direct
action. What to do if they are arrested.''
Mr Sheridan said he had encouraged the pupils of both Bellarmine
Secondary School and Crookston Castle secondary to form a Student's
Union which would fight for the right to join protesters during school
hours.
He had also suggested they speak with their headmasters and contact a
representative of the Educational Institute of Scotland.
Meanwhile Strathclyde police have launched an investigation into the
actions of some adult protesters who, they believe, are inciting school
pupils to rebellion, including raising false fire alarms to get out of
school early.
Leaflets are being distributed at Bellarmine Secondary and Crookston
Castle promoting The People's Free University Of Pollok, organised by
protesters and allegedly providing such courses as ''political
empowerment'', ''living skills'', and ''spirituality''.
Strathclyde's education chairman, Councillor Thomas Farrell criticised
the ''highly irresponsible behaviour from adults who should know
better''.
All this week dozens of school pupils have played truant among the
trees of Pollok Free Estates, swopping studies for abseiling and log
chopping at the so-called People's Free University.
The flyer circulating at the schools explains that entry requirements
and educational aims include ''respect and service to ourselves, others
and nature'', ''Gender, ethnic and social justice'' and ''standing up,
speaking out and being true.''
One 14-year-old boy said: ''It's brilliant here, you learn stuff, they
let you chop logs and abseil but only if someone is watching . . .
school's crap.''
A 13-year-old girl denied the pupils had been incited by the
protesters. She said: ''If this didn't mean anything to us we wouldn't
be here in the rain, at weekends and after school. This is our future.
We'll quit when Wimpey does.''
On Tuesday about 150 pupils from Bellarmine and 182 pupils from
Crookston Castle left school during the day to join protesters.
Police are now trying to identify who encouraged pupils to defy school
and breach the peace. One of the cases they are looking into took place
on Monday when someone set off a fire alarm at Bellarmine.
A police spokesman said: ''As far as we are concerned there is no
doubt that these children are being manipulated and we are carrying out
inquiries into who is inciting children to commit breaches of the peace.
''This is an extremely dangerous situation to get children involved
in. On Tuesday children scattered across Barrhead Road in front of
traffic and if one of them had been killed it would be on the
protesters' conscience.''
Police said two boys and a girl had been arrested during scuffles on
Tuesday then later released into their parent's custody.
Both Mr Sheridan and the district councillor for South Nitshill, Mr
Nicky Bennett, have made complaints to Strathclyde Police about
excessive force by officers, and sexual harrassment by security guards
during Tuesday's scuffles.
Meanwhile in both schools, seats sit empty.

COMEDIAN Spike Milligan yesterday branded his friend the Prince of
Wales a ''moral coward'', just weeks after he jokingly described him as
''a little, grovelling bastard''.
Milligan, 76, said: ''He's very intelligent, and his mind journeys
quite wide. There are areas where I disagree with him; for example, I
don't believe he should have taken his two boys hunting.
''Nor do I believe he should allow a museum to be built in the grounds
of Elgar's cottage. I told him it was going to be Disneyland and that
the Elgar family were very unhappy.
''But he just said: 'What can I do?' In that respect he's a moral
coward,'' he said in an interview published in the Oldie magazine.
The family of composer Sir Edward Elgar has failed in its campaign
against the museum being built at his cottage at Broadheath, near
Worcester.
Milligan, named Oldie of the Year last month, criticises the Royal
family and adds: ''I'm not a Royalist at all. But what are you going to
put in place of Royalty? Clinton and the Marines?
''But the Queen is not a very charismatic woman, I've never been moved
by any of her speeches, because she's got such a cold voice -- 'My
husband and I don't get on . . .'
''And she likes hunting and shooting, which is just murder.''
He said he had sent a telegram to the Prince of Wales after his remark
at the televised British Comedy Awards in December.
''I got my manager to phone the Palace and speak to his equerry, who
said the Prince had been watching it and he had been in hysterics. He's
never had that said about him before,'' he said.
Milligan has been hailed as a comic genius since the first radio Goon
Shows in 1952 which he made with Peter Sellers, Harry Secombe, and
Michael Bentine. The Prince was a great fan of the show.
It was a letter of congratulation from the Prince, read at the comedy
awards, which prompted Milligan to make the ''grovelling'' remark.

HUNDREDS of jobs could be lost at Scotland's charities and voluntary
organisations because of public expenditure cuts and local government
reorganisation, a conference in Glasgow was told yesterday.
At present, such bodies receive #90m a year from Scottish councils,
but as these councils face Government spending cutbacks, the charities
fear they will be seen as an easy target.
Much of the money goes to small-scale organisations, such as community
groups, pensioners' organisations, pre-school activities, and youth
work, which the councils have no statutory requirement to provide.
Mr Stephen Maxwell, the assistant director of the Scottish Council for
Voluntary Organisations, has appealed to the Scottish Office to provide
additional funding over the next two years to safeguard charities by
setting up an emergency fund.
