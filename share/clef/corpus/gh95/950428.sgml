William Russelllooks at the life of the man whose book forced
Britain's secret services into the open.
HE became a millionaire, defeated the Establishment, and rocked the
Thatcher Government, causing the then Cabinet Secretary, Sir Robert
Armstrong, to utter in the witness box his immortal confession about
being ''economical with the truth''. Peter Wright, the MI5 man who
spilled the beans about the ineptitude of the British secret service in
his book Spycatcher, published in 1987, died yesterday aged 78 from
pneumonia in hospital near his home in Tasmania.
In the book, banned in Britain, subject of a notorious trial in
Australia when the British Government sought to ban publication there,
he accused 23 fellow agents of trying to topple Harold Wilson's 1974-76
Labour Government. He also claimed that Sir Roger Hollis, head of MI5
from 1956-65, was the ''fifth man'' in that notorious ring of Soviet
agents, Burgess, Maclean and Philby, who had infiltrated Whitehall, and,
in the person of Anthony Blunt, the corridors of royalty. Wright was the
spy who came out of the cold into the heat of public controversy.
Over the years Spycatcher sold some five million copies throughout the
world, its initial sales boosted by the blinkered determination of the
Thatcher Government in 1986 to have it suppressed. Mrs Thatcher warned
that if he ever returned to Britain from his exile in Tasmania he would
be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act, which was used to ban the
book in Britain on grounds that it was a threat to national security. If
even a quarter of what Wright alleged was true, however, there were
other, greater threats. The two-year legal battles cost the taxpayer
#2.2m and because all attempts to have it suppressed abroad failed it
became a sine qua non for travellers to bring a copy back to Britain.
Peter Wright was born in Chesterfield in 1916. It was inevitable he
should end up a spy since his father, Maurice, a leading research
engineer with Marconi, was in MI6 during the First World War. Wright,
also an electronics engineer, spent the Second World War in the
Admiralty Research Laboratory and in 1949 became an external scientific
adviser to MI5. Four years later he was appointed its first full-time
salaried scientist, and among his first jobs was recording the
interrogation of the ''third man'', Kim Philby. He spent the next five
years bugging and burgling his way across London. His targets included
the Egyptian Embassy's cypher room, enabling MI5 to read Egyptian
messages during the Suez crisis.
He retired in 1976 with the rank of an assistant director, suffering
from ill health, and disillusioned with the old-boy espionage network.
He found Hollis, appointed in 1956, impossible to get on with, and,
after the captured Soviet spy Gordon Lonsdale alleged that a high-level
Russian mole was operating inside MI5, Wright decided it had to be
Hollis. When Hollis retired in 1969 Wright interrogated him
unsuccessfully, but remained convinced he was the traitor, writing: ''I
had faith in his treachery, as another man might have in God or
Mammon.''
The fact that MI5 haggled over his modest #2000-a-year pension did not
improve Wright's temper and led to his writing his memoirs while living
in Cygnet, a small town south of Hobart in Tasmania, where he bred
Arabian horses. The British press resisted being gagged and three
newspapers, the Times, Guardian and Sunday Times, which had published
extracts, were awarded costs when the Law Lords in October 1988
unanimously rejected the Government's demand for a blanket injunction.
The book promptly went on sale in Britain.
The question, still unanswered, is whether Wright was just an
embittered man, obsessed with conspiracy theories, making unfounded
accusations, or a genuine whistle-blower. His actions, however, led to
the lifting of the veil behind which MI5 and MI6 had sheltered. In 1989
the Security Service Act put MI5 on a statutory basis, and a second Act
passed last year dealt with MI6 and GCHQ. Their existence is admitted,
their heads' names known. Without Peter Wright's breaking the code that
would never have happened.
He is survived by his wife Lois, two daughters and a son.

CRICKET
DESPITE defeats in both their Benson &amp; Hedges matches the selectors
have decided only to add Poloc all-rounder Keith Sheridan to the
Scotland squad for next Tuesday's match against Yorkshire at Hamilton
Crescent.
Director of Cricket Jim Love explained: ''He would have been in the
squad before now but he returned only last week from New Zealand, where
he had a very good six months. He is match fit and, naturally, is in
with a chance.''
One man who would have been included in the Scots' squad is Gavin
Hamilton. But Yorkshire realise his potential and have included him in
their side this season, although he is bound to be disappointed at being
named only as twelfth man against his countrymen next Tuesday.
Ayr begin the defence of their DM Hall Western Union title tomorrow at
Glenpark, where they play the champions of two years ago, Greenock.
The champions will be without Aussie Marty Haywood but have signed up
South African Adrian Holdstock, while the return of Bruce Patterson will
help.
The visitors to West of Scotland are Kilmarnock, who have joined
forces with NKOA and are much changed on the field. Killie have lost the
talented Drew Parsons to Ayrshire but in their ranks will be Pakistan
Test star Asif Mujtaba, previously with East Kilbride.
The Ryden East League's new season also opens tomorrow. A newsletter
issued by the East of Scotland Cricket Association confirms that
discussions are on-going with the Scottish Counties which might well
lead to some form of amalgamation.
That would entail a new structure and clubs in the nether regions of
the respective leagues could anticipate playing at a lower grade.
The pick of the card looks to be the visit of Grange, boosted by
recruitment and sponsorship, to Carlton, who have made a shrewd
professional signing in Robin Singh, whose ability and dedication at St
Modan's were widely acknowledged.

<HEADLINE>Anti-terror laws sought as blast toll rises to 110</HEADLINE>

Oklahoma City, Thursday
THE death toll in the Oklahoma City bombing reached 110 today as
searchers found 11 more bodies in the rubble of the American government
building blown apart more than a week ago.
Meanwhile, congressional leaders were expecting swift action to boost
anti-terrorism measures and awaiting an FBI briefing on the blast.
As the pace of digging through the ruins accelerated, officials said
the toll was expected to rise quickly. Nearly 100 people are still
missing, including five children.
At least 15 children died in the massive blast, most of them in a
second-floor day care centre which took the full force of the two-ton
bomb.
Ray Blakeney of the coroner's office said it may take another week to
recover all the bodies.
The only man so far accused of the bombing, former soldier Timothy
McVeigh, was due to appear before a judge later today in the prison near
Oklahoma City where he is being held.
Prosecutors will ask for him to be kept in custody.
So far little of the evidence has been revealed, but federal
prosecutors must disclose enough to convince Magistrate Roland Howland
to hold McVeigh without bail.
An intense hunt has so far failed to find a second man suspected of
renting the truck with McVeigh,
McVeigh, 27, an embittered member of right-wing paramilitary militias,
has been held since last Friday at the El Reno prison. He was arrested
for a traffic offence only 90 minutes after the blast but police did not
realise he fitted a sketch of one of two suspects until two days later.
Jailers said the tall, crew-cut McVeigh was quiet and polite, but
watched everything with ''eyes of steel''.
Detectives are said to have tried every trick -- even showing him
photos of dead and dying children caught in the blast -- but have been
unable to crack his stony silence.
The FBI want McVeigh to help them find the second suspect, a
dark-haired, tattoed man who is still at large.
However there is little they can offer him as an incentive to
co-operate. Officials from President Clinton down have pledged to seek
the death penalty for anyone convicted of the bomb outrage.
Prosecutors in Wichita, Kansas, say that McVeigh told his friend Terry
Nichols three days before the blast that ''something big will happen.''
The disclosure came in a hearing for Nichols, who has been charged
with conspiring with his brother James and McVeigh to build bombs on
their Michigan farm. All three men have been linked to right-wing
paramilitary militia groups in Michigan.
The FBI said it has pursued some 6000 leads to the second suspect's
identity. Investigators are considering the theory that he died in the
blast.
Meanwhile, congressional leaders today predicted swift action to enact
new laws to meet the threat of terrorism.
However Attorney General Janet Reno said the new steps proposed by
President Bill Clinton would not necessarily have prevented last week's
blast.
''We see no indication that these tools would have helped us avoid
it,'' Reno said at her weekly news conference, cautioning that it was
necessary to be ''realistic'' about what these measures could accomplish
in preventing future domestic terrorism.
Her deputy, Jamie Gorelick, and FBI director Louis Freeh were to
testify today on counter-terrorism measures to the Senate judiciary
committee later today.--Reuter.

DEREK Forsyth, the coach of Scotland men's under-20 squad, has set a
target of maximum points in their opening matches against Switzerland
and Gibraltar in their European Junior championship qualifying
tournament in Genoa, Italy, to put them in line for a place in next
year's finals.
Their campaign starts tomorrow against Switzerland in what should be a
lucky omen for Forsyth, who took Scotland to the finals of the World
Junior Cup in Spain last year. He has never lost to the Swiss.
England, the favourites, step into their firing line on Tuesday and on
current form that test might be beyond them. In the final phase, Italy
and Portugal will be their opponents.
The women, who are competing in Poznan, start their programme on
Sunday. Like the men, they are seeded No.2, but will have an easier task
having been drawn against Poland, the Ukraine, and the Czech Republic.
Mike Gilbert, their coach, has not been so savagely hit by withdrawals
as Forsyth and he will be happy that there will be an additional place
in their finals.
Should Scotland play to form then they will unquestionably reach the
knockout stages.

SCOTLAND have accepted an invitation to take part in the French
Federation Melun Sevens in Paris on Saturday, May 6, at which The
Netherlands, France, Italy, England, Ireland and Wales will also take
part. The eighth team in the tournament will be a Melun Select Seven.
The Scots intend to compete in the next World Cup Sevens in Hong Kong
in just under two years, and so it makes sense that they begin their
preparations now.
Yesterday, Jim Telfer, the Scotland director of rugby, said: ''It is
essential that we get our management structure for the 1997 World Cup
Sevens into place as soon as possible.''
The Scotland Sevens squad for Paris will not not contain any of the
World Cup squad, nor those players involved in the Zimbabwe tour have.
With the exception of the Stirling pair, Mark McKenzie and Gordon
Mackay, all the players selected for Paris were involved at some stage
in Scotland's preparations for the last World Cup.
Andrew Ker, former Scotland and Kelso stand-off who was an inspiring
sevens player, will coach the team, managed by Andy Little. Squad:
F Henderson (Watsonians), M Moncrieff (Gala), M McKenzie (Stirling
County), C Little (Glasgow High/Kelvinside), G Farquharson (Gala), N
Crooks (Gala), R Kirkpatrick (Jed-forest), G Mackay (Stirling County), A
Roxburgh (Kelso), N Penny (Stewart's-Melville).

* THE Rugby Football League will have a special meeting in
Huddersfield on Sunday -- and the formation of the revolutionary new
Super League as a 16-team line-up is high on the agenda.
It was a meeting in Huddersfield -- the birthplace of the sport 100
years ago -- which led to the acceptance of media tycoon Rupert
Murdoch's big-money backing three weeks ago.
And, even though plans for a 14-strong Super League were approved
unanimously by all 32 professional clubs -- three weeks of rows have
followed.
A string of clubs have refused to go ahead with proposed mergers,
while Super League outcasts Keighley have said they are taking legal
action against the RFL.

SQUASH
SCOTLAND suffered a double blow in yesterday's opening round of the
men's European Championships in Amsterdam when Peter Nicol saw his
record of 24 internationals without defeat come to an end in a 3-1 loss
to Finland.
Nicol, the 22-year-old Scottish champion from Inverurie, lost 3-9,
5-9, 9-3, 7-9 to Sami Elopuro, ranked seven places lower at No.12.
With Martin Heath also suffering a shock 3-1 defeat, to former British
Open junior champion Juha Raumolin in the second-string match, and Dave
Gordon going down 3-0, Scotland's hopes of improving on last year's
bronze medal suffered a severe blow. New cap Stuart Cowie gained the
consolation point.
Scotland must now beat Germany and the Netherlands today to reach the
semi-finals.
The Scottish women stayed on course for the last four when they
bounced back from a 3-0 defeat from top seeds England to beat Ireland
2-1. Results included:
Men -- Finland 2, Scotland 1 (S Elopuro beat P Nicol 9-3, 9-5, 3-9,
9-7; J Raumolin beat M Heath 4-9, 10-8, 9-3, 9-6; K Peltonen beat D
Gordon 9-4, 9-2, 9-4; V Sistonen lost to S Cowie 9-3, 3-9, 2-9, 1-9).
Women -- England 3, Scotland 0 (C Jackman beat C Waddell 9-2, 9-3,
9-1; F Geaves beat A Bowie 9-4, 2-9, 9-0, 9-7; J Martin beat H Macphie
10-8, 9-3, 9-3).
Scotland 2, Ireland 1 (S Macphie lost to A McArdle 9-4, 9-4, 6-9, 3-9,
2-9; Waddell beat J Finnegan 9-0, 9-1, 9-0; Bowie beat A McGeever 9-2,
9-1, 9-3).

WHITBURN made it an all-East Scottish Junior Cup final with this win
at Love Street and will play Falkirk's Camelon at Fir Park on May 21.
Glenafton struck in only four minutes. Tom McKenzie bore down the
right and passed to Scott Archer. His centre was converted by Davie
Walker from eight yards.
Burns brilliantly saved a John Millar shot one-handed but Scotland
striker Davie Scott came close three times for Whitburn.
Whitburn did draw level up six minutes into the second half. Michael
McAvoy split the Glens' defence with a pass and Keith Jardine shot low
past Kelly.
Jardine struck again with only 11 minutes left. Paul Taylor sent a
pass through to him, and he cut inside Rennie before his shot rebounded
off the bar and struck Kelly before trundling over the line.
Five minutes from time Taylor curled in a superb 22-yard free kick to
make the game safe.
GLENAFTON -- Kelly, Lowe, Adams, Rennie, Kennedy, McFarlane, Walker,
Archer, Quigg, McKenzie, Millar. Substitutes -- Gray, Rodger, Moore,

<HEADLINE>Rosyth unions claim on Trident refits  Nuclear safety 'cheating' fear</HEADLINE>

UNION leaders at Rosyth dockyard fear that the Government is planning
to take Devonport docks back into Crown ownership to circumvent
stringent civilian rules over nuclear safety.
They feel the goalposts will be moved to allow the West Country yard
to carry out a #5000m refit programme on the Royal Navy's new generation
of Trident missile submarines from 1999.
It would also avoid the embarrassment of admitting that the decision
to award the contract to the English bidder was taken for political
rather than financial or practical reasons.
At the moment, Devonport is struggling to meet the Nuclear
Installations' Inspectorate specifications for a drydock capable of
handling the giant submarines safely during a two-year refit cycle.
The main problem, as revealed exclusively in yesterday's Herald, is
that Devonport is built on unstable, porous limestone. It would take a
major and highly-expensive effort to create a watertight berth which
could withstand an earthquake -- one of the NII rules.
The key consideration is that when a submarine's hull is cut open to
allow the removal and replacement of spent fuel rods, it is vital that
no water be allowed into the reactor compartment. If that happened,
there would be danger of an explosion which could release a cloud of
radioactive contamination.
Mr Bernie Hamilton, secretary of the industrial trade unions at the
Fife dockyard said: ''Devonport's programme is slipping. But we believe
the Government will do anything necessary to ensure that Trident goes
south. That could mean privatising Rosyth while taking Devonport back
into Crown ownership.
''Under those circumstances, they would be free to do whatever they
wanted with the minimum of safety interference. Crown property is
largely exempt from the normal rules. But all restrictions would apply
to us.
''The decision to award everything to Devonport was taken for reasons
which include the fact that there are more Tory voters in the West
Country than there are in Fife, and up to 30,000 jobs are directly or
indirectly bound to the future of that dockyard. It hinged on pure
political bias and little else.''
Both yards are currently run by management teams. Babcock Defence Ltd
operates Rosyth, and Devonport Dockyards Ltd runs its southern rival.
The managements have just submitted bids for outright purchase under
the Government's privatisation plans for the industry and are awaiting a
response to their offers.
When Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind announced that the Trident work
was being awarded to Devonport, he threw Rosyth a lifeline by promising
it the bulk of the Navy's surface warship refits over the next 12 years.
Now, even that 18-ship promise seems to be in doubt. The unions are
convinced that a trade-off will be arranged to allow Devonport to refit
one of the UK's three aircraft carriers, a lucrative #100m deal.
In return, Rosyth will refit at least two more nuclear hunter-killer
boats while Devonport's safety problems are ironed out by fair means or
foul.
Mr Hamilton added: ''We are not building up our hopes on Trident. But
Devonport does have its problems. Our fight is not and never has been
with fellow workers down south. It is with a Government that has
cynically stage-managed the ordering decision as a vote catcher.''
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said Mr Rifkind had
denied a report in The Herald yesterday that the contract for refitting
the Trident submarine fleet was likely to be moved from Devonport to
Rosyth because the English port could not obtain a safety licence from
the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate.

ALL but three of Shetland's stranded Bulgarian sailors are on their
way home, at the end of a bitter three-month strike and sit-in aboard
the fish-processing ship Rotalia.
The trio who stayed behind are believed to be seeking political asylum
because they fear physical reprisals..
Shetland friends of the 23 returning crew share worries that they may
be victimised after their partial victory in the first strike of its
kind by Bulgarian workers since before the Second World War.
The fears were reinforced by apparently sinister last-minute hitches
on the klondiker ship Rotalia, in scenes veering from melodrama to
farce.
At 10am, ship's agent David Ash walked up the rickety gangplank
carrying a haversack stuffed with dollar bills.
Under an agreement to end the strike and occupation on the ship, each
man was to receive pay arrears dating back as much as three years.
However, the money was found to be $30,000 short of the agreed $90,000
and it took Mr Ash a further three hours to raise the rest.
The men then left the rusty hulk of the Rotalia for the last time,
almost a year after leaving the Black Sea port of Burgas.
At Sumburgh Airport, they boarded a flight to Glasgow, where they were
due to take a chartered plane late last night to Burgas.

THE only sustainable future for European agriculture in an
increasingly open world market is one based on efficient farms capable
of competing effectively with third country producers, Agriculture
Minister William Waldegrave said yesterday in London.
''This must be a guiding principle of Common Agricultural Policy
reform,'' he said.
The Minister made it clear that Britain would not be willing to share
the task of paymaster in helping either present EU members or applicant
countries restructure their industry to compete.
Reiterating his assertion that further radical reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy was inevitable, he said the only realistic direction
was to change policies so that EU farmers were able to export to third
countries without the need for subsidies.
''The new model CAP must maintain a level playing field in which
efficient players are allowed to score goals and the less efficient to
leave the game, if necessary supported by programmes of social support
other than the CAP,'' Mr Waldegrave told a European Policy Forum
conference.
He claimed that reducing production-related support in conjunction
with international tariff reforms would lead to substantial increases in
world prices which would in part compensate farmers. He said
liberalisation would also enable the removal of physical constraints,
such as land set-aside policies, production quotas and bureaucracy. It
would also ease pressures created by further EU expansion to include
central and East European states.
He warned that the UK would not be willing to continue to finance farm
structural change throughout Europe. Britain had already evolved a
modern structure at its own expense. ''We must not end up paying for
other member states' adjustment,'' he said.
''That means that although we should not stand in the way of member
states who want to pursue policies whose aim is largely socio-economic
or regional in nature, we must insist that they be wholly or largely
nationally financed.''
He denied that Britain was scaremongering in raising these issues.
Farmers had more reason to be scared of politicians who did not face up
to the realities. He received some backing from Dr Julia Walsh, chief
executive of the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service which
co-sponsored the conference. Change in the CAP was inevitable and would
involve pain, she said.
''The longer we fail to recognise the scale of change required the
more difficult the transition will be. The option of rapid evolution
still exists but a failure to grasp the nettle now will require change
later at a revolutionary pace.''
The advisory service also published its latest Agenda for Progress on
CAP Reform yesterday as the London-based Country Landowners' Association
was presenting its publication, A Rural Policy for Europe to the opening
session of the European Parliament. This also highlights continuing
economic inefficiency of the CAP and criticises recent reforms as
''fatally flawed''.

A GLARING hole in the regulations covering the use of farm vehicles
pulling livestock trailers has been highlighted following recent actions
by police in North Yorkshire with major implications for farmers
throughout Scotland who haul their own stock to markets.
The police claim that many vehicles need to be fitted with tachographs
identical to those in heavy goods vehicles recording details of journey
time and speed to comply with European legislation. The widely-held view
among farmers is that Land Rovers and similar four-wheel drive vehicles
are exempt but this is only correct when a combination of the vehicle
and trailer are under 3.5 tonnes and it is used within a 50km or 31-mile
radius of the farm, or to take stock to the farmer's local market or
abattoir.
This in effect means that most farmers with a fully-laden trailer are
frequently breaking the law. The definition of what constitutes a local
market is also highly contentious. For example in the catchment area of
one of Scotland's busiest marts at Lanark, a farmer who is nearer to
Strathaven Mart is in breach of the regulations by not using Strathaven.
Similar circumstances would apply in the situation of Huntly and
Thainstone, Oban and Dalmally, Castle Douglas and Carlisle as well as in
a host of other locations. Scotland's largest police force, Strathclyde,
admitted that this was the case but also agreed that so far it was not a
rule that they had pursued with any great vigour.
A spokesman for the NFU agreed that the industry was likely to face
difficulties, quoting EC regulations 3820 and 3821 passed in 1985 and
the UK Transport Act of 1986. He also added: ''We are anxious that the
definition of a local market should take full account of the passage
which says 'appropriate to the livestock in question'.'' That he said,
did not always mean the nearest market because it could often be argued
that certain marts specialised in particular categories of livestock.
The Road Haulage Association has long been critical of the exemptions
afforded to farmers transporting their own stock frequently claiming
that the law is being flouted and that its members are losing out
financially.
Meanwhile a senior official with the Department of Transport in
Bishopbriggs attempted to clarify the situation: ''If the trailer weighs
more than 1020kg or the combination more than 3.5 tonnes, then the
operator should have a tachograph fitted although if he is using it
under those conditions which are exempt, then he does not need to fit a
disc.''
Several farmers have already approached the Department of Transport
for advice but the spokesman added: ''It may well be that some farmers
are contravening the law.'' So far there have been few prosecutions,
largely because inspectors are thin on the ground, but the penalty can
be onerous with fines running up to #2000. Fitting a tachograph is
likely to cost around #700.

* A SUPERB display of controlled golf saw Donna Jackson capture the
Renfrewshire Ladies Championship at her home Cochrane Castle club
yesterday.
The scratch golfer was three under par in the morning semi-final in
which she beat Paisley's Pearl Orr by 7 and 6.
Jackson showed little less mercy in the afternoon, covering the 13
holes required to beat Haggs Castle's Dorothea Hastings 6 and 5 in one
under par. Results:
Semi-finals -- D Jackson (Cochrane Castle) beat P Orr (Paisley), 7 and
6; D Hastings (Haggs Castle) beat A Wilson (Haggs Castle) 3 and 2. Final
-- Jackson beat Hastings, 6 and 5.
* QUALIFIERS for the Inter-county Foursomes from the Dunbartonshire
and Argyll Ladies Meeting at Windyhill yesterday were:
Scratch: 83 -- S Coster and L McDonald (both Hilton Park). 88 -- M
Myers (Clober) and E Grant (Douglas Park). 89 -- H Faulds and G Campbell
(both Bearsden) bih.
Commonwealth Spoons qualifiers (handicap): 71 -- K McColl and M
Campbell (both Hilton Park, 23). 72 -- M Duncan and I Telford (Cardross,
18). 77 -- B Beith (Douglas Park) and G Donnelly (Hilton Park, 15) bih.
* BARCLAY Howard will defend the St Andrews Links Trophy over the Old
course on May 27 and 28 against a widely representative field of 150
which includes the respective national champions of Scotland, England,
and Wales -- Hugh McKibbin, Mark Foster, and Craig Evans -- and Padraig
Harrington, the Walker Cup player, who was runner-up in last year's
Irish close championship.
The designation of the tournament as one to be attended by Walker Cup
selectors has attracted 18 of the squad who attended the recent training
session at Royal Porthcawl supervised by Ryder Cup captain Bernard
Gallacher. Among them is Gordon Sherry, who is the back marker off plus
four, and seven other players whose handicap is plus three.
* CRAIGIE Hill's Elaine Wilson was leading qualifier with a
five-over-par 76 at Alyth last night for the matchplay stages of the
Perth and Kinross Ladies Championship.

I WAS privileged to be in the audience at Sunday evening's recital in
the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, given by Felicity Lott and Graham Johnston.
It was outstanding and Felicity Lott's programme choice with the theme
of roses was inspired.
How, therefore, could the management of the Theatre Royal be so
miserable as not to provide a bouquet for her at the end of the recital?
There were plenty of tubs of plants on the stage but not one bloom for
her.
There would have been a wonderful opportunity to complete the
evening's theme by presenting Felicity Lott with a bouquet of roses. Can
I urge the management not to be so miserable in future and not to shame
Glasgow by not providing floral tributes to international artists who
visit the city?
The Theatre Royal must be one of the only venues to be so
penny-pinching and discourteous to international guests as not to
provide floral tributes.

IAN SPINNEY raises a key point in the debate, not only on cycling, but
transport generally (April 25). When a government agency, based in
Glasgow, finds no problem in paying #5 per day for an employee to park,
but cannot find a mechanism to pay #1 in subway fares for him to travel
this way instead, something is wrong with the system.
A company car, when parking place and all other costs are added up, is
unlikely to cost a company less than #6000 per year. Yet a company
operating principally in Central Strathclyde could offer a Zonecard
(#600-#800), with an allowance for up to #30 per week on a taxi account,
and still be amply in pocket.
The occasional journey to Edinburgh would cost #11, with ScotRail's
self-service 10-journey ticket (every half-hour), or even less for the
longer, and less roomy bus service (every 20 minutes). This would still
leave around #2500 to divvy up with the employee as a bonus.
Naturally, with increased use of public transport, service levels and,
hopefully, quality would go up in a virtuous spiral with a proven added
bonus. A retail manager I know never uses his company car to get to the
store, and during the train journey can read every company memo, and the
occasional novel; his car-using colleagues are always rushed and never
up-to-date with their notes.
Even the family shopping trip is a costly affair in both time and
money -- queueing for 30 minutes to park and causing massive congestion.
The recent Mayfest offer of weekend and evening travel by train at only
#1 for the family accompanying the cardholder must make this the bargain
of the year so far and without the wait to get parked at St Enoch.
I despair when I pick up tourist leaflets which completely ignore a
rail station across the road from a nature reserve yet advertise free
parking (RSPB), or fail to give any information on the tourist bus
direct to the site, and any other public transport (Cathedral).
A ray of hope is the consistent ''Scotland Street School -- Opposite
Shields Road Subway'', but this is swept away when the newly opened
Scotstoun Leisure Centre only gives directions from the Clydeside
Expressway, and is impressively difficult to reach from the nearest
station, despite being tantalisingly visible from passing trains. How, I
wonder, do the young swimmers of Whiteinch propose to get there?

I READ with interest Anne Johnstone's feature on the dangers of
inner-city cycling (April 24). Coupled with Rob Robertson's report on
the latest Speedwatch campaign, anyone doubting the need for safe cycle
routes and consideration for cyclists in general must surely pause for
second thought.
I sincerely hope that both of these articles are well read by all
forms of road-users on wheels and that speeding motorists be aware of
just how little chance of surviving a collision with a fast-moving car a
cyclist has.
I have driven for 22 years and cycled for most of my 42 years. On both
forms of transport I have avoided numerous minor bumps by a mixture of
luck, fast responses, and hard-earned experience but last year
miraculously survived my first true cycling accident when I was hit by
an oncoming car -- on my side of the road -- at a speed of 30mph.
My safety helmet shattered completely on impact with the road and
probably saved my life. I hope, however, that the intense fear I now
have of cycling in heavy, inner-city traffic will diminish somewhat in
the years ahead and allow me to resume this excellent form of
recreation.
I envy not the police, the road-safety associations, and the driving
standards agency the ominous task of promoting responsible driving (and
cycling) by whatever means they choose, but I firmly believe the bulk of
the impetus has to come form the drivers/riders themselves.

ACCORDING to the Pedal Power article (April 24) I belong to the 1% who
commute to work on a bicycle. I started to brave the traffic and the
elements because I became fed up with waiting 20 minutes and more for
the elusive 57 bus.
I am also fortunate to live within a 15 minute ride of my office where
both a garage and shower await.
I first took to my bicycle a year ago, fully expecting to give up
during the winter months, but I continued to ride throughout the year.
Only once has a high wind deterred me.
I have discovered a new freedom. Despite the traffic fumes I enjoy the
wind-in-the-hair feeling of exhilaration which accompanies a downhill
spin. Uphill climbs -- and Glasgow is full of them -- are helped by the
latest breed of multi-geared bicycle.
The exercise, even taken at a leisurely pace, must be beneficial while
the saving on a year of bus fares has equalled the cost of the bike.
Until floods swept away the Kelvin Walkway, I used this to bike from
the Botanic Gardens to Kelvingrove. Now I risk life and limb among the
buses and articulated lorries, but I am cautious, constantly reminding
myself that I have no need to rush when I am already saving time.
People ask if I am put off by the rain/hail/wind/snow. I reply that I
would get just as wet/cold/windblown waiting for a bus. At least I am
going somewhere.
Why not come and join me?

NOW that the better weather is here we are reminded once again of how
good cycling is for us and how cars pollute the environment (April 24).
No-one would disagree with this argument, but cycling all year round
in this country has many drawbacks; wind, rain, snow, ice, steep
inclines, pollution from exhausts, injury or death by accident, etc.
If cycling is to be made attractive all year round then steps must be
taken to overcome these drawbacks. One solution would be to build not
just cycle tracks but purpose-built covered-in cycle tracks, similar to
the walkway at Glasgow Airport.
These super cycle tracks would eliminate most of the problems and
would be lit at night for safety and monitored with miniature TV video
cameras for security.

A SCOTTISH company, bought from the receivers three years ago,
yesterday achieved world recognition after being presented with AT&amp;T's
highest performance award. Moorfield of Kilmarnock was sold to BJK
Aitken (Holdings) by liquidators Coopers Lybrand in 1992.
Now the restructured company, Aitken-Moorfield, manufacturers of
security containers for automatic teller machines (ATMs), has been
granted the S1 award by AT&amp;T Global Informations Solutions (Scotland).
The award recognises that Aitken-Moorfield has attained the highest
standards of production and supply of security containers.
Aitken-Moorfield supplies AT&amp;T's Dundee plant, the largest producer of
ATMs to financial institutions worldwide. The Dundee plant was awarded
the Queen's Award for Export last week.
AT&amp;T's director of materials management, David Ramsay, said: ''This
award says that this company is the best we can find at doing what they
do. Not every company will get there and all awards are reviewed every
year.
''We like to work in partnership with our suppliers to achieve the
very highest standards. S1 recognised that those standards have been met
and we take it very seriously.'' BS5750 is regarded by AT&amp;T as a
prerequisite of the award but S1 goes much further.
Jim McColl, managing director of Aitken-Moorfield, said: ''We
recognise the importance of this award and are very pleased that we have
made the grade.
''Since Aitken-Moorfield first supplied Dundee three years ago,
everybody in the plant has worked closely with AT&amp;T to attain the
exacting standards they require. It is a testament to all the employees'
hard work that we have achieved it.''

FROM being ''best keeper in Europe'' earlier this season, Rangers'
Andy Goram has been downgraded to Scotland's No.2 by team manager Brown.
It was Brown who tagged him as Europe's best, and now it's Brown who
has decided that veteran Jim Leighton will stay the man in possession,
even when Goram is fit and ready to play for his country again.
He explained yesterday: ''I still believe Andy is one of the best
goalkeepers around -- but I'm fortunate to have two top class men for
the one position.
''Jim Leighton has been playing superbly well. Quite simply he is not
losing goals for us and unless he is injured or he suddenly loses form
them Andy will just have to wait for his chance to return.
''Jim had to stand by for a spell when Andy was in the team. Now Andy
will have to be patient. I cannot do anything other than stay with Jim
after what he has been doing for us.
''Everyone in football has been praising him this season, and that is
not surprising. He has been immense.''
Brown stressed that he was not criticising the Rangers' man, whose
comeback began in the reserves at Queen of the South last Sunday. Goram
could play against Motherwell this week after shaking off the long-term
injury which he sustained playing for Scotland in Greece in December.
But the Scots' manager seems intent on showing loyalty to the Hibs'
man and leaving Goram to sit it out when the European campaign begins
again in the summer.
Meanwhile, the manager is convinced his striking problems could be
cured with the return of some of his injured stars. He points out:
''John McGinlay and Duncan Shearer have done well for us in different
games, but they know that they are not first-choice players.
''We are hopeful that people such as Scott Booth, Duncan Ferguson,
Kevin Gallacher, and perhaps even Ally McCoist, will be fit to play at
the start of next season against the Greeks when they come here in
August.''

<HEADLINE>Scots consumers still cautious on economic prospects</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978665631</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THERE is a distinct lack of a ''feel-good factor'' across the UK which
is perhaps not surprising given higher taxes and the prospect of a rise
in UK interest rates next week, writes NICOLA REEVES.
A quarterly consumer survey published today by Gallup and Business
Strategies, the economic forecasting group, shows that people in most
parts of the UK are worried about higher inflation, still concerned
about the state of the economy, and at best think they are experiencing
a ''feel-average'' recovery.
There are marked differences in consumers' expectations, with local
economic news able to have a marked effect on sentiment.
While Scotland did not face the deep recession which had a
particularly depressing effect on the economies of South-east England
and the Midlands, it was not totally immune and it is taking time for
confidence to recover among Scottish consumers.
Spending is still less than a year ago, down 0.3% on an annual basis
in the first quarter. However, this is an improvement on the 0.6%
decline recorded in the final quarter of 1994.
Charles Burton, joint managing director of Business Strategies, said:
''Scottish consumers remain depressed by UK standards, although their
views about economic prospects have improved slightly since the last
survey.''
Scots have been consistently more cautious than their counterparts
south of the Border. However, confidence about the economy has increased
in Scotland with 21% of consumers now expecting to see things improve
over the next 12 months, compared with only 20% in January.
Confidence about the economy is much higher in some other parts of
Britain with 28% in the East Midlands expecting to see things improve
over the next 12 months. In East Anglia the figure is 37%.
The expectations of Scottish consumers about their own personal
finances have improved. Thirty-four per cent say they are now saving,
48% say they are ''making ends meet'' and only 17% say they face rising
debts and falling savings. A year ago, the figures were 32%, 52% and 15%
respectively.
The overall level of debt in Scotland is lower than in most parts of
Great Britain.
The improved expectations probably has a lot to do with reduced fears
about unemployment while concerns about inflation remain unchanged from
the last survey. This contrasts sharply with the position in most of the
rest of Britain, where concerns about inflation have risen sharply since
the fourth quarter of last year, particularly in London and South-east
England.
Nationally, the scepticism of official data and caution on economic
matters being displayed by consumers leads BSL to conclude that whatever
measures the Government takes to try to boost economic confidence among
consumers, such as tax cuts, it is almost certain to fail.

Craig Brown takes a pot at the snipers . . . Stephen Hendry takes a
pot of gold
SCOTLAND manager Brown seemed genuinely bewildered yesterday at the
criticism he and his team faced after the scrambled 2-0 win over San
Marino.
Predictably, the press took the blame as far as Brown was concerned
and he told that to a management conference when he addressed them in
Aberdeen yesterday afternoon.
''An average, but professional performance is never good enough for
the press,'' he maintained. ''In all my years involved with the national
team it has had to be either brilliant or bloody awful. What we did in
San Marino was win a difficult game and do it professionally without a
lot of flair -- and no-one thinks that's enough.
''I think that with the score at 1-0 and just 10 minutes or so to go,
the pressmen had their minds made up that this was a disaster, and they
put their heads together and that is how we have been criticised.''
Then Brown added: ''This kind of criticism affects the fans and that
makes things all the more difficult for the team.''
There are several things wrong with that kind of assessment, of
course. First of all, those foot-soldiers of the Tartan Army who went to
the game in the mountain-top principality recognised the lack of quality
in the performance by chanting ''What a load of rubbish'' as Brown and
his team trudged from the field.
They had not had the benefit of reading the reports by then. They were
examining the evidence at first hand -- and they did not like it. At
home, those of us who watched on television, were dismayed at the lack
of invention shown by the Scottish side.
Surprisingly, the team manager's commentator brother Jock, so often a
publicist for the team nowadays, was forced to admit that the forward
play had lacked the required class.
So even the family are at war on this one.
Craig has to accept that in recent years the fans have been turning
their backs on the national side -- in their thousands.
Once, they were ready to accept the role of gallant losers, following
a team which might never find a great deal of success but could always
be counted upon to produce memorable moments even in the darkest of
defeats.
What they don't seem to want is a team which scratches results from
mediocre performances in places such as San Marino, once unknown dots on
the European map.
There is no use blaming that on the press. The fans have made up their
minds. Until the performances improve then the criticism from the stands
and from the newspapers -- perhaps even from the family -- will
continue.
We remain a strange nation when it comes to football. In l967 when
Scotland defeated the reigning world champions, England, at Wembley
there was an opportunity to go on to win by a greater margin than the
3-2 victory which is in the records.
But Jim Baxter decided that he wanted to enjoy himself and he played
keepy-uppy. He did run rings around the English, and he may even have
sat on the ball that day though memories play tricks, and Alan Ball has
always insisted that didn't happen.
Baxter encapsulated the punters' dreams of how the beautiful game
should be played. Scotland won by just a single goal, but for everyone
there, that match, and Baxter's display, remains a gem from an era when
skill would always be preferred to sweat, when ball control would always
be ahead of work rate.
I know that we will never return to these golden times, but, surely,
we cannot continue to follow the road to mediocrity which has driven
away the support which once turned up slavishly with their Lions Rampant
and their Saltires, dreaming of glory.
Brown must recognise that romanticism in some way, even perhaps
embrace it.
I can see why Craig Brown would react against the criticism. As a
professional he sees the result and possible qualification for the
European Championship finals as all-important.
In his terms that is right, but if the country is not happy with the
team's efforts then the country cannot be ignored.
As Brown rightly says: ''We are in a very strong position now to
qualify, and we have the easiest run-in of all the other nations. If we
don't blow it then we can be in England in 1996.
''The defeat Greece suffered may stop their bandwagon rolling on
because they now have to come here, as well as going to Finland and
Russia. We can qualify. There is no doubt about that.''
The doubts which plague some of us though, is what happens if we do
qualify and face up to the major European powers?
By then, hopefully, the team will be more settled. Perhaps it will
even be entertaining. That is what the public want, and they don't need
me or any other pressman to tell them so.

THE Confederation of British Industry in Scotland yesterday laid out
its plans for turning the nation's creative potential to its advantage
in the global market place.
With Scotland's recent economic recovery based on booming exports,
amid rapidly rising productivity and restrained consumer demand, CBI
Scotland believes the nation has its best chance in 50 years to tackle
long-term economic challenges.
The CBI wants to harness the research capabilities of universities,
the world-class standing of the financial services community, and
Scotland's manufacturing and engineering abilities to create wealth and
improve the country's standard of living.
It is also looking to exploit the potential of the uniquely Scottish
flavour of products and services such as whisky and tourism.
Lex Gold, director of CBI Scotland, said: ''We all want to see our
standard of living grow and the way to do that is to capture a greater
part of the world trade.
''We do that by using our creative ability -- keeping the added value
here in our country.''
Central to the CBI's message is the idea, put forward in its
Manufacturing Matters report published last September, that wealth must
be created before it can be spent.
Scotland's manufacturing base has taken a battering in recent years.
This sector, which accounted for 32% of gross domestic product in 1966,
contributed less than 20% in 1991.
To redress this and other matters, CBI Scotland believes UK investment
must be increased to at least 20% of GDP, from its current level of
between 14% and 15%.
This would put it on a par with its major European competitors,
although still well adrift of Japan, where investment accounts for about
30% of GDP.
In order to do this, CBI Scotland said, the Government will have to
reduce the share of GDP which it spends, as part of a shift in emphasis
from short-term spending to investment.
Heavy investment in infrastructure, particularly rail transport, and
increased spending on education and training are also central to the
CBI's strategy.
CBI Scotland, which will be launching a series of key reports on
factors critical for success in the coming weeks, will also initiate a
three or four-month consultation process.

GLASGOW could shortly be hosting a series of international sporting
events, provided a #45m submission to the Millennium Commission is
approved.
Part of the city council's proposed #78m regeneration project for
Glasgow Green and its surroundings, announced yesterday, includes the
building of a #30m multi-purpose indoor arena. It will have a running
track, operated hydraulically, as well as the capacity to be transformed
into an a ice rink.
''It would be our intention to apply for European and world indoor
athletic championship events,'' said Mark England, the city's community
recreation services manager.
Parks and Recreation director Bernard Connolly confirmed that world
ice dance and figure skating championships and world curling events also
would be on the city's shopping list.
The capacity of the new arena will vary depending on its use:
7000-8000 for athletics, 10,000 for gymnastics and ice events, including
ice hockey. The maximum, 12,000, would be available for boxing as well
as entertainment, such as concerts. Fight promoter Tommy Gilmour, who
staged Scotland's first world-title fight for nearly 50 years, said: ''I
would now hope to be the first promoter to put on a world-title fight at
the Millennium Arena.''
Plans include a football centre of excellence, with two full-size
all-weather pitches and 10 similar surfaces for five-a-sides.

ANDERLECHT have given Celtic permission to approach their #1.3m-rated
star Marc Degryse. Michel Verschuren, general manager of the Belgian
champions, said yesterday: ''Celtic faxed us asking for permission to to
talk to Degryse and we have agreed.''
Anderlecht expect Parkhead manager Tommy Burns to attempt to finalise
the deal after Sunday's match with league leaders Standard Liege. Burns
and his assistant, Billy Stark, were believed to be locked in
negotiations in Brussels last night after having seen the player in
action.
Degryse, watched by the Parkhead pair, operated behind the two
strikers, but had an indifferent game in the 2-0 home win over Cyprus
which keeps alive his country's hopes of qualifying for the European
Championships next summer.

FORMER Scotland defender and Dons diehard Brian Irvine believes that
winning Aberdeen's survival fight would equal any of their past
successes.
The club faces relegation for the first time in it's history and the
dominating centre back admitted before the key clash with Hearts at
Tynecastle: ''It's scary what is happening.
''In 10 years here, I have experienced every emotion.
''If we stay up, we will celebrate as much as when we won silverware.
That would nicely round off my career.
''We all recognise that we must win our last three games. To do that
we must push ourselves as if a championship is at stake.
''We have done well in the past at Tynecastle and can do so again.''

SNOOKER champion Stephen Hendry was left speechless after scooping
#147,000 yesterday with a superb maximum 147 break in his Embassy World
Championship semi-final with Jimmy White.
The delighted but mentally exhausted Scot excused himself from a news
conference after his brilliant maximum 147 break in the twelfth frame.
His manager, Ian Doyle, said: ''I apologise for Stephen not being
here, but he put so much concentration in that he's gone back to the
hotel. The most important thing now for him is to win the match.''
The 26-year-old is only the third player to achieve the feat in the 19
years since the tournament moved to Sheffield's Crucible Theatre.
The maximum -- Hendry's first in front of TV cameras -- came after he
had knocked in 119 in the previous frame, and it took him only 11
minutes and 48 seconds.
''It's the finest break I've ever seen,'' said John Spencer, the first
player to compile a maximum, against Cliff Thorburn in 1979. There have
been 22 other 147s since 1979, six of them in front of the cameras.
Hendry had said earlier in the competition: ''Making a maximum at The
Crucible is one of the few ambitions I have left.'' From the moment he
sank the first of the 15 reds, his slice of history looked a
possibility.
He eventually needed to produce an excellent positional shot on the
final red into the green pocket, screwing back for the black, before the
problems really began to loom.
Ahead, he could see the blue and pink almost touching around the blue
spot.
After potting yellow, green, and brown, he sank the blue in the yellow
pocket. He took the pink into the middle bag but watched in horror as
the cue ball trickled past the black towards the top cushion, leaving
him a difficult cut. But he made the perfect contact and the black
disappeared.
White, the last player to compile a 147 at Sheffield, in 1992, said:
''That was a fantastic break.''
But Hendry scored only 65 points thereafter as White battled back from
8-4 down to trail to just 8-7 overnight, and the match is far from over.
It looks very much as though the winner will be playing Nigel Bond in
the best-of-35-frames final. Bond last night was held up just one frame
short of the winning post as Andy Hicks delayed what seemed to be
inevitable defeat with a run of three frames after the interval.
But Bond recovered to take the last frame of the evening and requires
only one more today to book his final place.
He began the semi-final as the underdog but has outplayed Hicks in
each session, moving from 6-1 to 11-3 ahead and then to 14-4 at last
night's interval.  World No.33 Hicks took the next three frames, two of
them in black-ball finishes, before Bond calmed his nerves to go to bed
15-7 ahead.

JAMES TRAYNOR in San Marino
A FAMILIAR whine returned to Grand Prix racing yesterday when Nigel
Mansell finally eased himself into his McLaren machine, but not for
long. The former Formula 1 world champion spun off after four laps as he
re-acquainted himself with the San Marino Grand Prix circuit which was
open a day earlier than normal because of changes to the track on which
two drivers were killed last year.
Both Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna, arguably the greatest
driver the sport has known, lost their lives in high-speed pursuit of
glory on the Circuit Enzoe Dino Ferrari and modifications costing #4.5m
were made to three curves, the Tamburello, Villeneuve, and Variante
Bassa. As a consequence the top speed will be slowed to a frightening
189mph.
Mansell's apart, in the first session the cars passed in a blur of
bright colour and one of the quickest was David Coulthard, who took his
Williams car round the 3.132-mile circuit comfortably enough trying to
feel through his hands and body for any faults in the machine's
performance. Today and tomorrow the 24-year-old Scot and the others will
vie for pole position.
''I felt good today. The next few days might be good fun,'' he said.
''I had pole in the last Grand Prix, the Argentinian, and I have to say
it was probably the greatest feeling of satisfaction I've had in my
whole life.''
As for Mansell, he said he was pleased to be back at last and paid
tribute to his team for having built a car to fit his girth in only 33
days. ''A remarkable achievement, now let's see what I can achieve with
the car. We could have a big race on Sunday,'' he said after having
closed for the day with the eighth fastest lap time.
His spin came as a result of him reaching in the wrong place for the
clutch and finding the brake. ''My fault, I forget where the clutch
was,'' he said.
Coulthard was second fastest, 0.367sec behind Jean Alesi, who clocked
the fastest lap of 1min 30.081sec in his Ferrari much to the delight of
the local fans.
As Coulthard sat down in a corner of the paddock where the huge
travelling circus of articulated trucks bearing the famous names of
Ferrari, Williams, McLaren, Benetton, and others striving to become
great, one of his team's advisers stopped to say: ''Be gentle with our
wee one, won't you?''
It was an unnecessary request because Coulthard's boyish looks
disguise a tough character. He has already shown he will not be pushed
around on the track and pointed out: ''I don't like confrontation or
argument, but when I change into my overalls and approach the car a
controlled aggression takes over. On that track I can push as hard as
the next driver.''
Coulthard, from the Border town of Twynholm, has been readily adopted
by his new family, but he knows he must produce for them. ''I just hope
I'm around next year,'' he said while stealing glances at the vast
complex of parked trucks which carry the cars, all the pieces needed to
make them work, and the back-up teams who delve into the body of their
cars like a team of surgeons.
''The real thing won't start happening until tomorrow, but already I
can feel a warm tingle inside. Another race is near and that excites me
because it is another chance to win and that's what all this is about.''
Sunday's race brings him into competition with Mansell for the first
time since Williams made their decision to go with the Scot instead of
the Englishman, who had returned from the Indy Circuit in America.
''Nigel would have been the safe option for the team, but they chose me,
they decided to take the risk,'' he said. ''Also, I was the hungrier and
also the cheaper option, but they must have seen something else in me.
''Look, Williams are not in this to give young drivers opportunities.
They need results and performances and they wouldn't give just anyone a
break. I may have been unknown to the world when Williams chose me, but
I was known to them because I was their test driver, and then when
Ayrton was lost last year I had eight drives.
''I scored 14 points and like to think I did something to help the
cause. I am in a privileged position and it is up to me to do make the
most of it.''
The deaths last year of Senna and Ratzenberger have cast a shadow over
this year's event, but the Williams (Senna) and Simtek (Ratzenberger)
teams are doing their best not to dwell on the double tragedy.
''I wasn't a close friend of either driver,'' Coulthard said, ''but I
remember I was at a 3000 race last year when the accidents happened and
I didn't want to race. I remember asking myself 'Why? What was the
point?' However, you have to find places in your mind for everything and
keep them there. This is my passion and drivers know they are facing the
danger of a potentially fatal accident when they go on to the circuit,
but in the main I don't experience any more fear about driving my racing
car than you do about driving your car to work in the morning.''
Coulthard prefers the company of his girlfriend Andrea and a few close
friends as well as his family and laments the fact that business
prevents him from getting home to Twynholm as often as he would like.
''My ideal break would be a week there with the family playing with my
nephews and going to the pub with my friends,'' he said. ''After five
minutes or so Grand Prix talk is over and I catch up with the local
gossip.''
His mum Joyce and father Duncan are with him in Imola but his brother,
also Duncan, and his sister Lynsay will select other races in which to
suport their brother who they, like many people connected with this
sport believe is a champion in waiting.

I HEARD with great interest Prime Minister John Major's declaration on
war on the problems in the sprawling urban jungles of Britain. He
advocates a close working relationship between local authorities, the
public sector, and the private sector to create urban regeneration. Fine
words, but I can't help but be left with feelings of deja vu and
bewilderment.
I seem to remember the same (or similar) words being used by Margaret
Thatcher in 1989 and having some of the same bewilderment Mr Major's
words have brought in 1995. The bewilderment comes from wondering what
urban regeneration organisations such as Drumchapel Opportunities were
created for.
Local development companies, such as ours, have been co-ordinating
urban regeneration using multi-funding packages put together from local
authorities, development agencies, the Scottish Office, European funds,
and the private sector for a long time now. If Mr Major is considering
renewing his Government's commitment to these existing organisations --
more monies from central government would always be welcome -- then that
is good news.
But surely there has to be some co-ordination between government
departments to make it effective. For instance, Mr Portillo is
advocating cutting the weekly hours available to undertake training from
21 to 16 for those on benefits. This can only hinder and lessen the
chances of unemployed people improving their skills, and re-entering the
jobs market.
At present 21 hours makes it hard enough for us to continue our
success stories -- an average 500 a year into work, 20 new businesses
set up a year, and around 1500 people given skills and employment advice
annually since our inception in 1989 -- but with the hours cut to 16 Mr
Portillo would be making it even more difficult to get the long-term
unemployed into a decently-waged job.
To quote some of his ministerial predecessors, it is better to be a
tax-giver than a tax-taker, so why penalise the unemployed further?
Better to get off their backs and give the greatest encouragement and
incentive to get a job which yields a taxable wage for the Treasury.
Less rhetoric (particularly before local elections), less restrictive
legislation, and more upfront investment would go a long way to
continuing the transformation of the urban jungle.

AS the VE Day commemoration approaches, it would appear to be very
timely that the name of Sir Winston Churchill features quite prominently
in the media. However, on this occasion Churchill is the subject of
considerable debate.
There are two issues which need to be addressed with respect to
Churchill: the acquisition of his papers from the Churchill Foundation,
and the comments of Corelli Barnett, a Cambridge academic, in the Daily
Telegraph.
One would not want to appear to be ungracious or irreverent on
Churchill's contribution to the fall of the Nazi regime during the
Second World War. Unfortunately, it would appear in the light of recent
events that Churchill's role has been somewhat exaggerated. It should be
firmly borne in mind that the war was not won single-handedly.
It is somewhat incredible for Corelli Barnett to state that we ''owed
our deliverance in 1945'' to Winston Churchill. Has he lost sight of the
fact that our deliverance was given to us by the many thousands of
people, both military and civilian, who made the sacrifice of their
lives in the defence of the realm? At this time of remembrance it is
both discourteous and inflammatory to credit one single person with
securing liberty for Britain and Europe.
The second bone of contention is the acquisition of the Churchill
Archives, supposedly in the interests of the nation, using funds from
the National Lottery to the value of #13m. It is somewhat paradoxical
that if Churchill is viewed as our ''deliverer'', his correspondence is
now valued at #13m which will be paid directly to the Churchill
Foundation, with Churchills being the beneficiary.
There are two problems that are difficult to reconcile here. First, do
Churchill's letters and speeches constitute artefacts of prominent
historical and cultural significance and, if so, why were they not
generously donated rather than acquired for an exorbitant sum?
Secondly, wouldn't it have been more appropriate if the #13m of
National Lottery funding had been proportionately allocated to those
ex-servicemen's (and women's) organisations to support their arts and
cultural activities, eg the Royal British Legion, Earl Haig Fund?
At a time of remembrance, such as this, historical facts must be made
clear and not manipulated so as to be rather one-sided. Furthermore, the
value placed on Churchill's papers will be of little consolation to
those most adversely affected by the atrocity and inhumanity of war.

I WAS very interested to read the extensive coverage concerning
Channel 5 (April 27). However, I would like to clarify one of the many
issues raised in William Russell's article.
It is not correct to say the Independent Television Commission has no
option other than to give the licence to the highest bidder. In
exceptional circumstances the ITC can award the licence to a lower
bidder. This is possible if the quality of service proposed by an
applicant is exceptionally high and substantially higher than that of
the highest bidder.
Assuming there is a successful application for Channel 5, the licensee
must meet certain programming requirements. These refer to the level of
originally produced or commissioned programmes and minimum amounts of
news, current affairs, children's and religious programmes which must be
broadcast. The proposed service must also transmit programmes of high
quality and appeal to a wide variety of tastes and interests.
Far from these commitments being platitudes that can easily be
ignored, a failure to meet licence conditions would be publicly
highlighted by the ITC in an annual performance review. The ITC is also
able to impose sanctions including fines and even the withdrawal of a
licence. As the recent #500,000 fine on Granada shows, the ITC is
prepared to take action when required.

Ross Finlay finds the
new Rover has extra bite
THE most remarkable thing about the Rover 620 turbo diesel saloon is
that here is a fast, stylish, and comfortable car which eats up the
motorway miles, enjoys being let off the leash on winding roads, and yet
puts up fuel consumption figures which look like hilarious misprints.
The official returns suggest that it will manage 51mpg at 75mph, 70mpg
at 56mph, and 48mpg around town, with an overall figure, according to
the standard arithmetical calculation, of more than 55mpg.
Rover worked hard on the outward appearance and interior layout of the
600 series, which is -- although for just a few weeks more -- its most
up-to-date saloon showroom line. There is a good variety of engines at
prices between #14,995 and #23,495, working up to the storming
turbocharged petrol unit fitted to the 620ti. All 600s are elegant
looking cars, and they come with attractively presented passenger
cabins.
The 620 SLDi I have been driving costs #17,995. Over more than 1000
miles, it seemed to me to be one of Rover's best compromises between
performance and economy. There is no sense, on the open road, that this
is a lumbering economy special. Quite the opposite. It will sprint to
60mph in just under 11 seconds, go on to a test track maximum nudging
115 mph, and in the middle speed band shrug off most other cars which
try to muscle past it on acceleration.
Of course, it is the turbo diesel's torque characteristics which give
it that massive mid-range whoomph. While the peak power output is 105bhp
at 4200rpm, the engine's formidable torque curve climbs on to its summit
plateau, showing 155lb ft, at 2000rpm.
The 620 uses Rover's own design of turbo diesel, and its acceleration,
top speed and combined economy figures defeat all its direct rivals.
Rover engineers decided to go for direct fuel injection -- as well as
a catalytic converter and exhaust gas recirculation -- in the L-series
diesel's specification, and they have given it a state-of-the-art engine
management system in their quest for not just fine performance and
economy, but also much better flexibility and throttle response than you
find in many of the opposition.
A direct injection diesel produces different sound effects from the
ones you hear in the more familiar indirect injection types. Tickover
comes with not so much a rattle as a muted staccato. A big acoustic
cover is fitted over the whole engine, and there are smaller covers of
the same kind over individual components, with the result that noise
levels in the cabin are low.
In SLDi trim the car comes well-equipped, with such features as
anti-lock brakes, an effective alarm and immobiliser system, and
electrically heated door mirrors all on the standard list. The test car
was in British Racing Green, with a metallic finish at #395 extra, the
same as is charged for a passenger's-side airbag under an ugly cover,
the driver's being included in the standard price.
I like Rover's interiors, not only for the general layout but also for
the fabrics and textures chosen. But even after 1000 miles I still felt
that the beige interior clashed with the black used for the instrument
cowl, the fascia vents and the centre console.
With the driver's seat well reclined as I usually have it, kneeroom in
the rear is only just OK for a long run. The boot is well sized and
proportioned, and this is one of those non-hatchback saloons which
nevertheless has a 60/40 rear seat fold-down split.
Sometimes I do not enjoy turbo diesels, because there are makes which
may offer good performance and economy, but are a little restless to
drive and still rather jerky when the boost wafts in. Rover has spent
#30 million on the new L-series engine, and the magic ingredient no
table of statistics can reveal is a level of refinement which most rival
companies so far can only envy.

IF there is a secret of eternal youth to be found (and who bar Barbara
Cartland and Joao Havelange would seek it?), maybe research should be
centred on the football manager, but not so much on those in employment
-- rather the men who get sacked.
It occurs to me that the way to take years off anybody's life is to
get the chop as a team gaffer.
It was as though that occurred while watching a clear-skinned, smiling
and bright-eyed Willie Miller offering his thoughts as an expert
commentator in the BBC TV studio during Scotland's uninspiring -- but
entirely predictable -- performance against San Marino on Wednesday.
Miller, although born in Glasgow, spent so much time at Pittodrie that
he became the archetypal suspicious northerner, wary of all things
emanating from the central belt, especially the west. It was a trait
learned at the feet of the original old groaner himself, Alex Ferguson,
who became a tower of Aberdeen resentment until he had battered us all
into submission and his team had won everything bar the Glasgow Cup.
However, while Willie was very much an integral part of that process,
his management days were not long, or successful enough, to allow him
the luxury of sniping from his northern lair.
His chat on television on Wednesday was sensible, interesting and
honest, not to mention entertaining. Like so many managers before him,
he seems to be a different man when the shackles of team responsibility
are removed. Willie, unhampered by suspicion of the question or
questioner -- unworried about protecting his players or his club -- told
it like it is. He criticised when it was due, gave informed tactical
expertise when it was needed, and highlighted the good when there was
any to be seen.
He was correct to keep returning to the quality of the John Collins
goal -- although the old chestnut about how we would all have raved
about it for a week if it had been a Brazilian goal is undeserved. If it
had been a Brazilian goal, it would have been the cream in delicious
coffee, not the cream in stale tea.
Miller highlighted the ball control, skill and enterprise involved in
the goal scored by the Celtic man, all of which was justified. Watching
the score again, it seemed to me to confirm that -- apart from Brian
Laudrup -- Collins has been by far the most skilful player in the
premier division this season.
He has the rare ability, usually reserved for foreigners, to have the
ball at his mercy with his first touch, the trickery to manoeuvre
between, around and, sometimes it seems, under opponents and the special
asset of being able to put the ball in the net.
Maybe most important of all, however, is that Collins tries to play
that kind of ball game every time he takes the field. If he has an
off-day, when nothing is working out, he sticks by the game plan,
attempting to combat energy with skill.
If anybody was going to find a way past a packed defence in the
current international squad, Collins was surely the one. Like Willie
Miller, he had a good night.
* THERE will be a lot of cynical people watching events at the Kelvin
Hall next month when Frank Bruno fights whoever it is he is fighting --
forgive me, but it may have changed as I write. The latest flabby farce
when George Foreman lumbered around the ring to beat, officially at
least, German Axel Schulz, was another of the multitude of examples that
boxing at what is supposed to be the top level is guilty of mass
deception.
Schultz would not have been allowed to hold the punch bag for the
Foreman of 15 years ago, yet probably did enough to win. That is of no
consequence. What really infuriates anybody who likes to see fair play
is the sheer brazen impudence of promoters setting up contests which are
a prostitution of the sport.
Whoever turns up opposite big Frank on May 13 had better be up to the
job.

IT would indeed have been a shock back in the late 1950s to have seen
Leadbelly striding across a stage in denim dungarees or zoot suit and
tie (Jack McLean on The myth I can't miss, April 21), as he would have
been dead 10 years, having died in 1949.
I can however vouch for Jack McLean's biographical notes on Ramblin'
Jack Elliot's lack of hobo credentials. When I saw him in 1965, on a
bill with ragtime guitar genius the Rev Gary Davis, he had a foot in
plaster. Was this the result of a tumble when riding the rods of a
freight train?
One may have reasonably surmised this from his repertoire of songs. He
admitted the cause was a skateboarding accident a few weeks before the
gig. No matter -- he's definitely a myth not to be missed.

<HEADLINE>Operators get a boost as the price of Brent crude breaches $19 a barrel. Oil goes sharply higher</HEADLINE>

SHARPLY higher oil prices in recent weeks are set to boost revenues
from the North Sea, just when output is expected to go into seasonal
decline.
The outlook for prices is now significantly more favourable than three
months ago, Mark Shea, energy economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland,
said in a bullish analysis accompanying the bank's latest oil and gas
index.
This month the price of Brent crude has breached $19 a barrel,
compared to an average price of $16.90 in the first quarter of the year.
Mr Shea added: ''The price increase is an unexpected boost to North
Sea operators and will help to offset crude production, which has
started its seasonal decline.
''The rise in price has been stimulated by continued lack of progress
on the UN initiative to restart limited Iraqi exports. This has pushed
back the prospect of Iraq's full re-entry into the market and had added
some stability to oil prices.
''Sluggish European demand has helped to halt the upward trend for the
time being, but world demand is expected to be stronger this year, and
that should help to ensure the recent gains are maintained.''
Combined oil and gas production from the North Sea fell during March
for the second month in a row. The Royal's oil and gas index dropped by
3%, but was still 12% higher than a year ago.
Oil production, which had risen in February, declined by around 2% to
an average of 2.65 million barrels a day due to production problems on a
small number of North Sea platforms. Despite the setback production in
the first quarter was still 11% higher than in the same period last
year.
Gas production fell by over 4% as domestic heating demand declined
from its winter peak, but the seasonally-adjusted index advanced by
nearly 2%.
The fall in output, which was largely caused by seasonal factors,
combined with a slight decline in the sterling price of oil, reduced
North Sea oil and gas revenues by 4% to an average of #45.2m a day.
Oil revenues were affected by the weak dollar which led to the average
sterling Brent crude price falling 6% to around #10.60 a barrel.
However, the decline masks a strong underlying performance by the
industry with oil and gas revenues being 21% higher than they were in
March last year.

AS one who was taught gardening by his Irish grandfather, planting
main-crop potatoes around Easter is an emotional experience.
I have just planted his favourite Kerrs Pinks. His favourite potato
dish was made by mashing boiled potatoes with a little milk, a knob of
butter, seasoning, and chopped spring onions mixed in. (My mother called
them syboes. He called them scullions.) The resulting dish was eaten by
itself. She called it mash, he called it champ. It's really delicious,
try it, but do not use new potatoes.

* SIMON Yates, the Coca-Cola Open winner at Shenzhen last week, was
leading Scot in the inaugural $400,000 Volvo China Open in Bejing
yesterday, though an opening 77 places him 11 shots off the early pace
set by Taiwanese Lin Keng-chi and in danger of missing the halfway cut.
His five-over-par score was one better than Sandy Lyle and three ahead
of Kings Links professional David Thompson in a Scottish contingent of
just three.
With a strong field present at the Beijing International Golf Club, it
was favourite Keng-Chi, a former caddie for Chen Tse-chung a former US
Tour tournament winner, who took control across the 6956 yard layout,
shooting a course-record 66.
Lyle continued his poor form to finish tied for seventy-second
position in an event in which only the top 60 and ties qualify for the
final two rounds. Leading scores:
66 -- L Keng-chi (Taiwan).
68 -- S Conran (Australia).
69 -- P Jonas (Canada).
70 -- L Ying Juh (Taiwan), M Zerman (Italy), Z Liang Wei (China).
Scottish scores: 77 -- S Yates. 78 -- S Lyle. 80 -- D Thompson.

NOTHING matches the life and sparkle of water in a garden. A pond adds
a focus while providing a natural environment for a host of aquatic
plants. Fill a pond with fish, and you've got a mini zoo to which
children will flock.
But laborious digging and a liability of cracks in the concrete seal
put most people off a garden pond until fairly recently.
The advent of the preformed, plastic pool has seen demand mushroom.
The main advantage of pre-formed pools are their ease of installation,
strength, and resistance to puncture.
Little wonder, then, Findlay Clark have enlarged their water garden
enclosure to include many more preformed pools, watercourses,
rock-effect cascades, various species of fish, and aquatic plants.
The pools, made from high-density polythene, come in all shapes and
sizes but are made to two different specifications.
The first type is the formal pool, often rectangular in shape and
generally built to add an decorative touch to an ornamental garden.
Exotic fish such as shubunkins, black moor, Japanese fantail, Koi, and
red comets, are introduced to provide movement and colour. These are
reasonably priced at around #7.95 for a multi-coloured shubunkin, though
a foot-long red comet will set you back by #35.
But many people now leave a part of their garden to nature, with
nettles and wild flowers to attract insects, birds, and animals.
An extension of this ''greening'' process is the wildlife pond --
which will help to attract frogs, newts, birds and animals to drink.
The secret of building a natural pond is get the pond, rocks and
surrounding plants to merge together without distinct borders.
The sloping edges to the pond stocked at the centre encourage wildlife
to come and go from the water by creating ''marsh borders''. These
shallow borders hold soil and stones preventing them from toppling into
the pool so that the edge can merge into the water level.
Prices start at #24.99 for the pools and rise to #260 for the largest.
''Rockform'' watercourses and cascades are also proving popular to
install next to a pool to create a little waterfall. These start at
#13.99.
Findlay Clark also stocks many aquatic plants such as water lilies,
floating fairy moss, and oxygenators -- which will grow in any depth of
water. A variety of marginal plants are also available.
But whatever your apsirations are regarding a pond, Findlay Clark has
the stock and the expertise to advise on everything from filtration to
fountains and let customers really make a splash with the neighbours.

CLAY County (10-11) ended a sequence of 17 losing favourites on
Scottish racecourses with an easy victory on the second day of the Perth
Festival yesterday.
The front-running 10-year-old, to be sold at Doncaster next month, had
no difficulty in holding off Political Tower by a length and
three-quarters to win the RMC Catherwood Little Bay Handicap Chase.
The last favourite to win in Scotland had been Master Bracken in the
last race at Ayr on Friday, the second day of the Scottish Grand
National meeting.
Rusty Blade (9-1), who fell when going well at Newcastle a month ago,
got up on the final stride to beat Richardson, the 7-4 favourite.
It was Rusty Blade's third win this season for his owner, Mrs Margaret
Nisbet, wife of Kelso director Mark Nisbet.
Rusty Blade was giving Peter Monteith his seventeenth winner of the
season and the Rosewell trainer went on to complete a 50-1 double when
Unor (7-2) won the Perth Hunter Chase.
Monteith is now seven behind Len Lungo in The Herald Trainer's
Championship.
Earlier, his father, Colonel William Monteith, had paid 6000 guineas
for Electric Committee (8-1), the Irish-trained winner of the American
Bankers Selling Hurdle.

AFTER wins for Richard Corsie two years ago, and Andy Thomson last
year, the Australian contingent hit back with a vengeance yesterday.
Corsie and Thomson both tumbled to defeats in their group matches in
Sydney -- while Ireland's Ian McClure lost both his games, writes Gordon
Dunwoodie.
Corsie can reach the semi-finals, but went down to Australian
Commonwealth Games pairs gold medalist Cameron Curtis 5-9, 8-9.
Thomson tumbled to a second successive defeat, losing 7-9, 4-9 to
Australia's top woman bowler Daphne Shaw.
Group A -- I Schuback (Australia) beat I McClure (Ireland) 9-8, 9-2; D
Shaw (Australia) beat A Thomson (England) 9-7, 9-4; S Glasson
(Australia) beat McClure 9-3, 9-7.
Group B -- R Johnston beat N Burkett (South Africa) 9-8, 9-8; C Curtis
(Australia) beat R Corsie (Scotland) 9-5, 9-8; Burkett beat C Anderson
(Norfolk) 9-2, 7-9, 9-0.

THE purpose of the Lottery is clear; it is to provide funds for sport,
charities, arts, heritage, and the millennium fund. Along the way it
will give a modicum of fun to players. It was not designed to enrich the
descendants of a great man whose latter-day relatives may well qualify
(if reports of their haggling and threats of sale are correct) for a new
coat of arms bearing grasping hands, couchant, on a field of greed. The
historic papers of Sir Winston Churchill are the latest source of
controversy over the manner in which the revenues of the lottery, other
than those which have gilded Camelot, are spent. This is not a simple
issue despite determined efforts to portray it thus. There are some 1.5
million items in the collection, ranging from childhood letters from the
misery of boarding school to Sir Winston's mother, to documents
enriching and throwing light on great matters of state. Labour MPs who
complain that the papers are only the product of the fact that Sir
Winston was Prime Minister, and that they should therefore rightfully
belong to the nation, are wrong. The Heritage Secretary, Mr Stephen
Dorrell, who insisted yesterday that the papers belonged to the
Churchill family and that the purchase price of some #13m was fair, is
equally wrong.
Put simply, the Churchill papers are a mixture of private papers and
public papers and it should require no great intellect to sort out which
is which. Once this is done the public papers, dealing with matters of
state during Sir Winston's times in office, should be given over to the
state. Private papers should be retained by the family and if the nation
wishes to buy them a price can be negotiated, though well below the sum
of #13m. The Heritage Secretary gave the game away on this issue
yesterday when he admitted that lawyers were split over whether the
papers were public or private. This is not surprising as they were
merely attempting to follow the commonsense procedure outlined above. Mr
Dorrell's fear is that letting lawyers loose on the division of 1.5
million items of paper could prove expensive. Well and good, keep the
lawyers away. Labour's undynamic shadow Heritage Secretary, Mr Chris
Smith, suggests that an independent eminent historian could deliver an
opinion. At the current rates paid to British academics this should come
pretty cheap and the job need not take as long as the publishing of the
Dead Sea Scrolls. This approach would have the benefit of retaining
state papers for the state, by which we mean all of us, and allowing the
Churchills to earn what they can from the rest.
Nevertheless there are other matters, notably of precedent, which must
be considered. There is a tradition of senior politicians gifting their
working papers to the nation. This has been taken to extreme lengths in
the United States (particularly in the establishment of a Ronnie Reagan
archive) but the principle is sound. There is clear anxiety that papers
created by and on state business can be left to relatives by great men
and then disposed of for large sums of money. This would be a retrograde
step though it could, incidentally, blow a substantial hole in the cult
of state secrecy so assiduously cultivated by a succession of British
Governments. Another precedent has already been set and it bears
directly on the current issue. Sir Winston's widow, Lady
Spencer-Churchill, donated her husband's papers from the post-war period
to Churchill College, Cambridge. These were not private papers, on the
lines of the criteria we have described, and Lady Spencer-Churchill's
gesture was both generous and correct. Such thoughts do not appear to
have crossed the minds of present-day Churchills who appear to have
wrung the #13m from the trustees at the Heritage Lottery Fund through
two years of threats to sell the papers abroad. They must bear the
responsibility for their own actions, but we should not bear the cost.
On the wider issue of the use of Lottery funds, there is much work yet
to be done. Mr Dorrell insists that the effect of the Lottery on the
revenues of charities, including medical charities, is being monitored.
The implication is that once the detrimental effect has been
established, something will be done. This should happen, and speedily.

EVERYTHING came up roses -- red ones, as it happens -- for Scotland's
women bowlers in the Atlantic Rim Games at Durban yesterday, when they
enjoyed their best day of the championships, as they took the lead in
the race for the fours title.
Facing the red roses of England brought the best out of the Scots --
Janice Maxwell handing out a 25-22 defeat to the holder of the singles
title, Norman Shaw, and Frances Whyte's quartet beating Mary Price's
rink, 23-15.
Scotland claimed another double against Jersey, when Maxwell pipped
Val Stead, 25-24 and the Scottish quartet triumphed 23-18.
Maxwell in her unaccustomed singles role, had to fight back from 4-10
in the morning clash with Shaw. The Castle Douglas star scored 16 shots
to six in 13 mid-game ends, to lead 20-16, but fell behind again 20-22,
before a double and three singles gave her a 25-22 win.
Drained by her 29 ends ordeal, Maxwell had lunch and faced Stead in
another gruelling marathon of 36 ends.
Stead led 12-8 after 16 ends, but five ends later, Maxwell was ahead,
17-12. Consistent accuracy was impossible because of a gusting wind, and
the match went to 24-24, before Maxwell claimed the winning single.
Liz Dickson, Eleanor Allan, Betty Forsyth and Frances Whyte were
always in front of England in the fours, and won by eight shots.

GOLF: THE PERRIER PAIRS in Paris
JOSE Maria Olazabal was on the ball yesterday with seven birdies in
the Perrier Paris Pairs at Saint-Cloud which left him and fourball
partner Severiano Ballesteros on seven-under-par 63, four strokes off
the lead.
Afterwards, Ballesteros who managed just one birdie, was quick to
admit: ''Jose Maria was fantastic. He sank putts from everywhere, but I
made only one bogey, when I three-putted the fifth, and I was often
there without having to putt.''
This is a unique tournament for the European Tour with a fourball
yesterday, a foursome today, a greensome tomorrow, and another fourball
on Sunday.
Ballesteros added: ''We have a very good record in foursomes and the
important thing is to keep the ball in play and not make too many
mistakes. It could be very different tomorrow.''
In the lead were John Bickerton and Daren Lee, two little-known
English professionals who played some of the best golf of their careers
to shoot an 11-under-par 59.
It was a case of perfect teamwork with 25-year-old Bickerton, from
Worcester, grabbing six birdies and 30-year-old Lee, from Wanstead,
notching five. It left them only one short of the record 58 set by Peter
Baker and David J Russell in this tournament last year.
Bickerton and Lee, beginning at the tenth, were soon into their
strides. Lee, a Challenge Tour player who went down with ME in 1987 and
was ill for four years, began the fireworks with birdies at the
eleventh, thirteenth, and fourteenth. Then Bickerton birdied the
sixteenth, seventeenth, first, third, fourth, and eighth with Lee coming
in again at the sixth and ninth.
''We've never played together before though we know each other from
our amateur days,'' said Lee, who was the leading amateur at the 1992
Open Championship at Muirfield. ''We just went out to enjoy ourselves
and we certainly did that.''
They lead two other golfing journeymen, Frederic Cupillard and Fabrice
Tarnaud, both of France, by two shots, but as Bickerton said: ''There is
still a long, long way to go.''
Colin Montgomerie and Ian Woosnam shot 64. Montgomerie, who shot three
of his team's seven birdies, was disappointed when he and Woosnam both
took 5 at the par-4 eighteenth, but admitted: ''We both hit bad drives
and we were punished for it. Tomorrow is the important day. Foursomes
make a big difference. There are a lot of people bunched around the
62-to-65 mark, but in foursomes you cannot afford any bad shots.''
Richard Boxall and Derrick Cooper, recent winners of the Sunningdale
Foursomes, could be strong contenders following their 62 yesterday for
joint third place, with Boxall holing in one at the 153-yard sixth with
a No.7 iron.
The rookie Scots pair of Gleddoch-based Dean Robertson and East
Kilbride's Craig Ronald, the new West Alliance champion, were well
placed with an opening 63. Leading scores (British or Irish unless
stated):
59 -- J Bickerton and D Lee.
61 -- F Cupillard and F Tarnaud (France).
62 -- A Cejka and H Thul (Germany), P Fulke and M Gronberg (Sweden), R
Boxall and D Cooper, J Robson and S Watson.
63 -- E O'Connell and P Walton, P Broadhurst and R McFarlane, R
Claydon and P Eales, S Ballesteros and J M Olazabal (Spain), D Robertson
and C Ronald, S Cage and I Pyman, O Edmond and B Telleria (France), D
Clarke and P McGinley, R Burns and C Mason, M Mackenzie and D Ray.
64 -- C Montgomerie and I Woosnam, R Chapman and P Way, P Baker and D
J Russell, M Besanceney (France) and V Fernandez (Argentina).
65 -- M-A Jimenez and J Rivero (Spain), C Larrain (Venezuela) and D
Westermark (Sweden), J Bland and J Hawkes (S Africa), P Moloney and T
Price (Australia), B Lane and M Roe.
Other score: 70 -- B Longmuir and M Stokes.

HONG Kong is a volatile society, a place where today's rumour can
become tomorrow's fact. The reports of growing gloom there about what
will happen after the handover to China in 1997, given the lack of
progress about the transition process in the Joint Liaison Group, have
to be viewed with that in mind. The Foreign Secretary is well aware of
how the Hong Kong media, not to mention financial analysts, can find
mountains where there are only molehills, which is not to say there are
no mountains left still to climb. There are some formidable ones ahead
for the JLG to tackle. Mr Hurd, therefore, was putting the best gloss he
could on the situation in yesterday's debate in the Commons and was
also, wisely, intent on sending a positive message to Beijing where his
words will be subject to equally intense scrutiny.
The talks about setting up a final Court of Appeal, to replace the
Privy Council, resume today with Britain and China disagreeing about the
number of foreign judges whose presence is intended as a guarantee of
the tribunal's judicial independence. Mr Hurd, carefully casting no
brickbats, hoped China would give early support to the Hong Kong
Government's draft Bill so that the court could be set up in good time
and good order. There are certainly plenty of opportunities ahead for
talking to the Chinese. Next month Mr Michael Heseltine, President of
the Board of Trade is to visit Beijing and Shanghai at the head of a
massive trade delegation -- the importance of overseas trading links for
China should not be underestimated -- and the Chinese Foreign Minister,
Vice Premier Qian Qichen, is coming to London for talks. Mr Hurd saw him
last week in New York and sought his help on getting progress in the JLG
where what remains to be tackled is daunting. A huge raft of Hong Kong
legislation has to be made compatible with China's basic law, and the
confidence of the Hong Kong Civil Service about its future must be
reinforced if senior figures are not to emigrate in droves, and what is
to happen about the new Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport
holders must be settled.
Mr Hurd was right, therefore, to emphasise how vast is China's stake
in the future of Hong Kong. The colony's economy now corresponds to 26%
of China's GDP, an increase of 8% over the last three years. Foreign
analysts say: ''Stay out. Don't invest.'' Pro-Chinese businessmen think
otherwise, as does the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. Hong Kong is
an entrepot for over a quarter of China's external trade, a key conduit
for foreign investment. China is booming. One way to damage that would
be for China to mishandle the handover to it of the world's eighth
largest trading economy.

MUCH more than a garden centre, Findlay Clark has grown relentlessly
to become a one-stop leisure complex catering to a vast array of indoor
and outdoor pastimes from golf and horse riding to exotic fish.
But it has not forgotten its beginnings, and the first sensation on
arrival is the dazzling array of colourful blooms, followed almost
immediately by wave after wave of sweet scents from begonias, marigolds,
and a host of others.
This spring the centre is putting an accent on plants for the patio,
and features just about every conceivable shape, colour, and type of
plant and container to transform a courtyard or paved area into a riot
of colour and growth.
And, in keeping with the one-stop Findlay Clark thinking, composts,
containers, and planters in all shapes and sizes are sited next to the
new enclosure containing the bedding plants. Terracotta pots and
troughs, glazed, plain, or decorated, are displayed in their hundreds
alongside hanging baskets, wooden tubs, window boxes, and wicker work
containers.
Staff at the centre are keen to encourage new planting combinations to
give originality to displays. For example, the traditional strawberry
pot looks well draped in greens with the glow of ripening fruit behind
the leaves. But brightly-coloured pansies planted through the pots make
for a pleasingly haphazard effect, while a selection of small herbs will
sit comfortably in the planting pockets by a doorstep -- and provide the
freshest of flavours for the kitchen. Mint, marjoram, welsh onion,
variegated lemon balm, curry plant, and chamomile are just some of the
subtle smells and flavours already in Findlay Clark's stock. Why not put
some in yours?
Roses, and long-flowering plants such as petunias, pelargoniums, and
fuchsias will help to ensure a summer-long display of colour, while
foliage plants can be used to give height and shape to any paved area.
Ivies, for instance, look stunning grouped together and allowed to
cascade from larger pots.
Findlay Clark also keep many examples of dwarf shrubs and box trained
spirals and balls to provide a cultured, decorative look. On top of
which the centre can boast a large stock of yucca, japonica, ferns,
acers, bamboos and grasses, not to mention a selection of wooden,
plastic, cast aluminium, and canvas furniture to turn your patio into a
palatial sun trap.
But for those who prefer the outback to the back garden, the centre's
saddlery has a comprehensive collection of all things equine, allowing
unbridled admiration for the smell and feel of worked leather and
quality clothing for the outdoor type.
Now well established at Findlay Clark, the saddlery sponsors horse
trials at Scone, Hopetoun House, and several smaller events in the area.
Next door the new golf shop stocks all the major brands including
Ping, Calloway, and Cobra, with beginners' woods for as little as #10.
It offers also a part-exchange facility; a ''try before you buy ''
scheme, and a ''customer fit'' service.
Under the main enclosure a selection of fine foodstuffs comes as
something of a surprise, and perhaps reflects a taste for the finer
things in life with rainbow-coloured tagliatelle, cider vinegar,
barbecue marinades, and hand-made cookies.
Appetite whetted, it's only a stroll over to The Famous Coffee House,
where the extensive range of hot food includes the likes of chicken
tikka at a #4.25, which can be followed by double dairy ice cream
courtesy of Nardini of Largs.
Also available are toasties, pastas, quiches, and Danish open
sandwiches. Suffice to say Egon Ronay, the Tea Council, and The Herald,
have all seen fit to recommend it.
Unashamedly operating at the quality end of the market, the centre
stocks some unusual and innovative products.
Anyone who has ever felt the damp rising up through a picnic spread
will want to try a Riviera travel rug for size. At #49.50, it's not
cheap but the water-resistant backing means no damp patches on the
knees, or anywhere elsewhere for that matter, and it folds up into a
convenient travel bag with its own handles.
And why pack in the patio picnic when the sun begins to fail when a
garden lighting system could keep the party in full swing?
Equally useful for the security minded, modern systems are flexible,
safe -- due to the low 12-volt power supply, easy to fit and move,
extendable, and will create highlights and atmosphere wherever
installed.
Queries and problems are dealt with by staff -- including a
full-trained horticulturist -- at the information desk in the middle of
the complex. They will advise on everything from directions round the
large centre to the best balance of colour and greenery in a basket or
display.
The spring party is already underway at Findlay Clark. Why not take a
piece of it back to your patio?
You may never say ''not in my back yard'' again.

I WAS in Dover yesterday, doing my bit for the local election
campaign. This is the constituency of Mr David Shaw, that specimen of
Tory manhood who has devoted so much attention to the affairs of
Monklands.
Mr Shaw might have done better to attend to his own back yard. The
Tories lost control of Dover for the first time 18 months ago and Labour
is now set to gain overall control. Kent County Council is run by a
Lib-Lab coalition, after more than a century of Tory rule.
If even half the straws in the wind which one picks up on such visits
are of substance, then the direst predictions of Tory collapse south of
the Border next Thursday may prove to have been under-optimistic. They
are in a gratifying state of meltdown.
References to the ''South-east'' as some generic land flowing with
milk and honey were always rubbish. The difference now is that the
almost tangible sense of contempt for the Government and all its works
is on the verge of becoming the majority culture, with startling
political implications.
This time next week, the shoogliness of the nail on which Mr Major's
jacket hangs will have been greatly exacerbated. Many hundreds of
ex-Tory councillors will be blaming him, rather than themselves, for
their loss of office. Tory MPs will be calculating the implications of
local swings for hitherto healthy majorities.
On top of everything else at this particular time, I would have
thought the Tories could have done without the conspicuous reminder from
Mr Winston Churchill minor that when greed and patriotism come in
conflict it really is no contest. Dover, with its white cliffs and war
memories, was not a bad place to gauge public reaction yesterday.
No amount of convoluted pleading can contradict that which appears
obvious to every man and woman in the street. The records which relate a
former Prime Minister's time in office are the property of the nation;
all the more so in the case of war records drawn from an era when
thousands were paying with their lives.
The idea that the originals of such epic addresses as ''We shall fight
them on the beaches'' and ''This was their finest hour'' can be turned
into lucrative commodities which the nation has had to buy back, 10 days
before the celebration of VE-Day, certainly represents a striking
example of market forces at work.
But it feeds into the prevailing public mood, which is that the net
result of all the great upheavals of the past 16 years is that the rich
have got richer while the poor have become poorer. That is the phrase
which keeps coming up. Crucially, those in the middle are now more
likely to categorise themselves with the poor rather than the rich.
While Mr Major sinks further into the mire, there is no doubt that the
standing of Tony Blair goes from strength to strength in all parts of
Britain. I have been through too much to assume that this happy state of
affairs will continue indefinitely, but the current mood is certainly
remarkable.
All around England the message is of Tories coming straight over in
droves to the Labour Party, rather than stopping off at the traditional
staging-post of the Lib-Dems. I am sure that they, too, will do well
next week, but not where it matters for Labour in terms of parliamentary
seats. That will be another important yardstick.
The impact of this movement of opinion against the Tories in all parts
of England is, of course, just as welcome in Scotland where the same
thing happened first. It took longer for the tide to turn there, in
response to economic conditions, but now that it has, the force is no
less strong.
Getting out and around England reminds one of just how intermingled we
all are and how common the problems we share. I suppose that to some,
mention of Kent must conjure up images of orchards and suburbia. But
where I was yesterday the reality is of a coal industry destroyed, town
centres in terminal decline, and unemployment rates similar to my own
constituency.
When Tory citadels fall next week we should be cheering no less
enthusiastically than a month ago when their Scottish wipe-out was
confirmed. It will be the same kind of people suffering the same kind of
conditions who have delivered the blow. And ultimately, winning Dover
and Basildon will be just as crucial finally to getting rid of the
Tories as Stirling and Ayr.
After next week's elections we can look forward to celebrating VE-Day,
even if it is in rather more frugal style than Mr Winston Churchill MP.
Yesterday I had cause to reflect that the triumph of freedom over
tyranny manifests itself in some peculiar ways.
At Dover I paid a visit to the demonstrators protesting against the
export of live animals. There were about 100 people there and no signs
of trouble or belligerence, while the police presence was large and
oppressive.
Whatever the detailed arguments, the right to protest on this issue is
surely beyond dispute. Yet throughout the time I was there, a police
squad dressed in what can only be described as paramilitary gear
ostentatiously focused hand-held video cameras on every movement.
Presumably the intention is to intimidate, identify, and investigate
everyone who turns up to express an opinion. One wonders who has
approved the assumption that this is either necessary or desirable.

PARTICK Thistle's Inter-Toto Cup opponents remained a unknown last
night -- but at least the Firhill club now know where they are going.
Thistle are among 60 clubs who will take part in the summer tournament
-- which this year will have the incentive of taking four of them into
next season's UEFA Cup competition.
Despite the fact that all the places have not yet been filled, and all
teams not yet known, the draw still went ahead in Geneva on Wednesday,
but it was not until yesterday that UEFA faxed the SFA with the details.
And Thistle, who have not played in European competition since 1972,
will open their campaign in Austria on June 24 or 25.
Thistle's first home match will be against Iceland's representatives
on July 1 or 2. Their full programme is:
June 24/25: Austria (2) away; July 1/2 Iceland home; July 8/9 France
away; July 15/16 no match; July 22/23 Croatia home.

* CRYSTAL Palace's Darren Patterson will make a plea in mitigation
after an FA charge of bringing the game into disrepute after his Cup
semi-final sending-off against Manchester United.
United midfielder Roy Keane, shown the red card during the holders'
2-0 replay success at Villa Park, has been allowed until Monday to
deliver his verdict on whether or not to appeal against a similar FA
charge.
Both players were given a three-game ban after the incident in which
Patterson reacted after Keane stamped on Gareth Southgate.
* REPORTS last night indicated that French striker Eric Cantona was
likely to sign a long-term contract with Manchester United today worth
between #1m and #3m.

<TEXT>
THE Investors Capital Trust held its second-quarter dividend at 1.325p
despite seeing its performance dented by falls in its large holding of
electricity shares.
The equities-based trust, which is managed by Edinburgh-based
investment manager Ivory &amp; Sime, said that despite the setback it was
still on track to achieve its target of a full dividend of 5.3p per
share for the financial year to September 31.
The Investors Capital Trust aims to achieve a total return in excess
of the FTSE-Actuaries 350 index by investing in UK equities and
equity-related securities.
But Ivory &amp; Sime said net dividends reinvested on a quarterly basis
showed a return of 2.3% during the first six months of the trust's
current financial year, well below the 4.2% total return from the
Actuaries 350 index over the same period.
It said the trust had suffered from maintaining overweight holdings in
the electricity sector, where share prices plunged earlier this year as
a result of action by Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator.
Looking ahead, Ivory &amp; Sime said there was a risk of retrenchment in
some equity prices after the recent stock exchange rally and a further
modest rise in interest rates was likely.
''That said, earnings and dividend growth should remain robust
throughout the current year leaving the UK equity market attractively
priced,'' it concluded.

THE first time I encountered Moliere's satire on the medical
profession was when doing French at school. It was in a musty,
dull-green, hardback book and we read it aloud painfully slowly. It
wasn't funny.
By the sounds of it, actress Valerie Bournet-Car had much the same
experience. In one of a couple of English-language interludes in this
robust adaptation by Cartoon Sardines Theatre, she explains that her own
opinions of the play were coloured by the similarity of her teacher to
the devious Beline, wife of the titular hypochondriac, and on said
teacher's blatant typecasting of Bournet-Car's fellow pupils.
This four-strong production is, therefore, a sock in the eye to all
deadly classroom theatre. For Moliere to work at its best, it has to be
all about the art of the actor. Cartoon Sardines takes this belief to
its limit in a brisk, circus-style all-in-one version that is endlessly
inventive. Bournet-Car herself plays all the female roles, jumping from
the angelic Angelique to the brassy Beline to the scheming servant,
Toinette. Angelique's snitching sister, meanwhile, is played by an
obsequious miniature puppet in gold lame.
Most of the male roles go to Robert Grozdanic, like the others,
clipping in and out of his costumes like a 3D Ennio Marchetto and
playing everything from a roller-skating romantic to a stunted lawyer.
Sparklers sizzle, the musical soundtrack warps, and everyone (for there
seems to be hundreds) runs rings around Patrick Ponce's hapless Argan,
the hypochondriac, played with an athleticism which makes his claims of
fatal illness all the more ludicrously absurd. Formidable, as they say.

Mark Fisher talks to writer Mike Cullen about his play,The Collection,
a study of the cut and thrust of desperate poverty
OVERNIGHT success came late to Mike Cullen. It took seven years as an
electrician in Bilston Glen Colliery, Loanhead, three years on income
support, two unpublished horror novels (terrible by his own admission)
and a late degree in linguistics from Edinburgh University before he
ended up where he wanted to be. Now he's there, it seems he can't put a
foot wrong.
You have to keep reminding yourself that as playwrights go, Mike
Cullen is pretty new to the game. To date he's had only one play
produced, and even that was by an unfunded profit-share company. That
was The Cut, a political thriller that looked at the nervous aftermath
of the miners' strike and the dog-eat-dog values of the Thatcher
generation.
It was produced by Wiseguise Productions on a budget so small that
actor Kenny Glenaan nearly had to sell his house to get it on the road.
Poverty or not, the script was strong enough to get Cullen shortlisted
for a couple of awards and is even now several drafts along the road to
being turned into a film.
As he balances his time between two television projects -- one for the
BBC, the other for Channel 4 -- his second stage play, The Collection,
opened last night at Glasgow's Tron Theatre, performed by Edinburgh's
Traverse as part of Mayfest.
So much success so quickly is as much a surprise to Cullen as to
anyone, although he's getting a little fed-up with the
working-class-lad-made-good media coverage he has tended to attract. The
explanation for his good fortune, he suggests, could be that he is the
only person to be writing in his chosen style -- a modern, urban Scots,
influenced by American theatre and film.
That may be true, but it is also something to do with his ability to
deliver accessible stories (he reckons The Cut was a Hollywood Western
in disguise) which are loaded with resonant contemporary themes. Just as
The Cut was less about the mining industry than it was about the decline
in working-class solidarity, so his new play, The Collection, is not
only about the seedy world of the debt-collector but also about the use
and abuse of power, the low price of personal morality, and the confused
world of gender politics.
''I like to bury as much as I possibly can in the thematic side of a
play,'' says Cullen, a prodigious reader of film and theatre theory. ''I
tend to adopt a vehicle -- The Cut was a fairly standard thriller and
The Collection is pretty much a standard psychological thriller -- so if
people don't want to get into the thematic side of it, they can enjoy it
simply as a thriller.
''I find that wearing a theme too much on your sleeve is a bit of a
turn-off. If you want to put in some work you'll find a lot of
allegorical stuff which is all deliberately placed, but deliberately
concealed as well.''
Reminiscent of Glengarry Glen Ross in its portrayal of hard-bitten men
doing soul-destroying work (Cullen acknowledges David Mamet as a key
influence and is flattered by the comparison), The Collection tells the
story of a debt-collector who goes to pieces after one of his clients
commits suicide, only hours after he has refused to have sex with her.
His attempts to deal more humanely with his remaining clients is at
odds not only with the machismo of his office environment, but also with
the expected relationship between collector and debtor.
''I think it moves away into a different territory from Glengarry Glen
Ross,'' he says, admitting that one similarity with Mamet is his
preference for writing male parts. ''You tend to go for safety and it's
always safer to write voices you're comfortable with.
''Obviously, being a man, I'm comfortable with male voices. There's
always that question in the back of your head: 'Am I fairly representing
the woman's voice here?' You want it to have credibility.''
Cullen, however, could not be called a lazy writer. In The Collection,
which is directed by Ian Brown and will transfer to Edinburgh after its
Glasgow run, he pushes himself into some decidedly murky areas of male
sexuality and violence that might have been easier to avoid.
''I think actors like working in my pieces because I do get very into
character when I'm writing,'' he says. ''I am interested in discovering
aspects of my own character that I never knew existed, because at the
end of the day it's all me. So yes, my wife gives me funny looks and
audiences might say 'Well, that guy's peculiar', but you just have to be
really honest with yourself, and if that offends people and if they
think less of you as a result, then so be it.''

RUSSELL Walls has certainly had an interesting if not testing time in
the past few months. He has just been appointed finance director of
British airports operator, BAA. Scots-born Mr Walls succeeds Nigel Ellis
who is retiring at the group's AGM on 14 July.
Walls moves to BAA from Wellcome which he joined at the beginning of
this year, just weeks before the drug company was the subject of a
hostile bid from rival Glaxo. Mr Walls resigned from Wellcome on 11
April. Prior to Wellcome, he spent a long career at textile group Coats
Viyella, serving in a number of posts both in the UK and overseas.

IT was 1956 and there was a cafe down the road in Townhead, a bit
seedy really, and what were then called Teddy Boys used to go there.
They weren't very good Teddy Boys and rather jejune for the role, and
even to me at my tender years seemed a bit miscast. I mean, they had
Tony Curtis hairdos and plenty of grease, but spots and thick Celtic
hips. Sultry like James Dean was what they aimed for. In fact they
looked as though they had just been belted by a physics teacher. Their
clothes were admirably ambitious but somehow lacked the notion of
success in that direction. Yet they were a strange group, set aside.
They were called teenagers. And anyway the cafe had a jukebox.
In 1956 I was 13 and still in short trousers and I suppose it was an
odd thing for one such as I to be going down to the Splendide Cafe in
Townhead to spend sixpences to listen to Elvis and Jerry Lee and Carl
Perkins and Chuck Berry, but I did. I was astounded at it. Suddenly I
didn't have short trousers, or indeed a short back and sides, or a short
physique. When I played Jailhouse Rock I had an unseen drape jacket and
drainpipe trousers, white shoes, black shirts, sideburns, no mum and
dad, freedom: suddenly I had liberty. Called rock'n'roll.
Dear heavens it was indeed freedom. All those awful years of Lita Rosa
or Donald Pears. Frank Sinatra cooing his well-modulated tones about
Manhattan and dames. And now here was a sound which sounded like pink
suits and pinker Cadillacs, and sounded too like something I had never
heard. I had heard some country and western -- back then it was called
either hillbilly or, a curious but apt phrase, western swing -- I'd
liked all that, but then came the rock'n'roll.
Sure the clothes and style were interesting, and indeed I came under
the spell of it all, of 1950s teenhood, later on, but it was the music
which enthralled me. A colleague once wrote, many years back when both
he and I wrote for other blatts, a burst of such an atrabilious tone
that I was forced to reply: it was about Elvis Presley.
Have you ever been to a wedding or any sort of social occasion when
that anathema of the mid-fifties, a rock'n'roll band, gets up to play? I
should know because I played in them. The little ones, the toddlers, the
little boys and girls, the teenagers, the young marrieds, the people my
age, the granddads and grandmas, they all get up to dance, or at least
tap a toe on the floor. For the magic of original rockabilly would have
the Holy Father himself wanting to jitterbug, and place a shrivened palm
around a young girl's waist and her in a sticky-out dress and bobby-sox.
The Pope would have been 36 when Elvis had his first US hit. He'd have
been 16 when Cab Calloway was giving it Hi-De-Hi.
I mention all the above for a reason. Listen to a splendid programme
on the World Service of the BBC. It is called The Origins of Rock'n'Roll
and has been attempting for weeks to prove the new -- not old -- canard
that rock'n'roll was stolen from black music. In fact the programme goes
at length to insist that all those poor ol' darkies from the Deep South
were exploited by the white capitalists. Well they were, but so were the
poor white trash, and something more. I have listened to the original
race records by people like Arthur Big Boy Crudup. Elvis recorded a
number of his songs, the first being That's All Right Mama. Elvis sings
it better, believe me, and with a lot more passion and more feeling. In
fact in the early days Elvis sang all the songs he heard from the black
community with more emotion, and more style and class. So did the rest
of the early rockabillies, the Western Cats. They simply took the music
they had heard and turned it into something else. In the meantime the
blacks were doing the same. Destroying their own traditions.
Listen now to black music. Rap and crap. Black music has lost every
direction. From the genii of jazz and the remarkable passion of blues
and gospel all has been lost. Perhaps, though they didn't mean it; the
Ertegun brothers who kicked off Atlantic Records and may be said to have
damn-near invented soul music, at least commercially, were to blame.
Ahmet died some years back and may have been able to save the soul of
soul, but soul is now not just merely commercial music, it is a lot
worse. It appears to many, probably most, black people throughout the
world as their own, new, out-of-the-West music. Jazz is damn-near dead.
Elvis and the rest certainly dae, and contumely is heaped upon them.
In the meantime the black music consists of sophisticated primitivism:
what one critic said of rock'n'roll and Presley. The Hootchie-Koo.

STERLING had a firmer tone moving up against both the dollar and the
German mark.
However, trading was quiet with most currencies moving in a narrow
range.
Sterling gained two-thirds-of-a-cent on the dollar at $1.6168 and
added over half-a-pfennig against the mark at DM2.2237. The pound's
trade-weighted index remained at 84.7.
There was no UK data to give a lead to the pound but attention was
focused on the US first-quarter GDP data published today. Trading is
expected to be quiet with most European markets closed for a holiday on
Monday.
Market expectations are still for a half-point rise in UK base rates
to be sanctioned when Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and
Bank of England Governor Eddie George hold their next monetary meeting
on May 5.
This is just a day after the local government elections in England and
Wales when the Tories are expected to be trounced. City nerves ahead of
the election results could see the pound move lower.

LET me just see if I've got this right. Successive Tory governments
over the past 15 years have wrought a dramatic transformation in the
British economy. Cripplingly high corporate taxes have been slashed.
Inefficient state enterprises have been reborn, streamlined and
competitive, through being privatised. Markets have been liberalised.
Union power has been curbed.
I know I've got that bit right. I could recite it in my sleep, given
the number of times I've sat through speeches by senior members of the
Major Cabinet, reciting that relentless litany of achievement as if
they'd all swallowed the same autocue on their way out of some
television studio. But let me just see if I've got the rest of the
message straight.
In our biggest export market -- the rest of Europe -- British
competitiveness has been given a razor-sharp new edge by the Major
Government's gritty refusal to have anything to do with the social
chapter of the Maastricht Treaty. In export markets, in general, British
trade has been boosted by the sizeable devaluation of sterling since we
were bundled out of the European exchange rate mechanism.
Ministers might quibble over that precise interpretation of our ERM
exit. You know how touchy the Tory Party is these days about its
internal fault lines on Europe. But it's the next bit where I'm not at
all sure the message is as I thought I heard it.
Fifteen years on, there is, apparently, a report lying on ministerial
desks in the Department of Trade and Industry analysing the UK's market
share in our top 80 markets. Despite the aforementioned transformation
of corporate UK under the Tories, the survey does not, it seems, make
encouraging reading.
It reports that our share of these key markets continues to erode; and
that share continues to shrink because Britain, which can boast some
global stars in its corporate firmament, still has far too many
second-rate enterprises which are being cuffed by the opposition,
despite everything this Government has done for them.
Worse, these poor performers are being cuffed not by competition from
the emerging economies of Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America, where
wages and conditions are even lower than social chapter-free Britain,
but by high-wage mature economies, like Germany and Japan.
You think I'm making all this up? Well clearly you weren't listening
to Wednesday's keynote address to the Institute of Directors' springfest
in London's Albert Hall by the president of the Board of Trade, Michael
Heseltine. Heseltine was uncompromising in his warning that
self-congratulation and complacency over what has been achieved since
1979 is ''dangerous and self-deluding''.
He's the one with the report on his desk. He told the IoD: ''One stark
lesson stares out of the figures. Our market share has not been eroded
by low-cost Asian economies. The toughest competition we have
traditionally faced has come, and is coming, from high-cost, well-paid
Western European, North American, and Japanese companies.
''In far too many of the 80 markets it is not the UK which has the
largest share, but Germany. Germany is a country which, up to now, has
overcome its higher costs by higher productivity, producing top quality
products that customers want to buy. It has achieved this through high
investment and a highly skilled workforce.''
The president of the Board of Trade went on to argue that the best of
British companies are equal to anything to be found in Germany. ''But
too many of our companies are not; and it is averages that count, and
the UK has a long tail of under-achievers. You know it, I know it,
survey after survey shows it.''
I salute Heseltine's honesty. But the implications of that depressing
report, and his acceptance of its findings, for the party of which he is
a prominent member (and which, according to those who know these things,
he still aspires to lead) are profound.
If British industry is to be revived, in depth, to the extent that it
begins to win back market share around the globe, more is clearly needed
than top-rate tax cuts, rejection of the Maastricht social chapter, and
a lot of hollow hype about the enterprise culture.
Mr Heseltine makes it clear he knows that more is needed. Germany has
overcome the higher costs of the social chapter, he tells us, through
high investment and a highly skilled workforce. The conclusion is
unmistakable. We must invest more in productive capacity and the skills
of our people if we are to turn the tide.
By coincidence, CBI Scotland published its Business Agenda yesterday,
following through a process started last September with the challenging
Manufacturing Matters report. The Agenda extends the Heseltine analysis.
''We have failed,'' it says, ''to convert our immense intellectual
property to its full potential of competitive products and tradeable
services. Our productive investment, infrastructure, and skills have
fallen behind our key competitors.''
But the Agenda's authors are not content with adding to the existing
piles of depressing comparative analysis. They offer a framework for
action which they intend to debate with an array of other interest
groups in Scotland in both the public and private sectors.
The Agenda starts from the assumption that wealth must be created
before it can be used to raise the living standards and quality of life
right across our society. I doubt if New Labour would demur from that
any more than the Tory Party, Heseltinian wing or not.
CBI Scotland goes on to propose a number of targets on economic
fundamentals and future levels of productive investment, on education
and training, and on infrastructure, which are benchmarked against
world-class standards. Thus we should strive to invest more than 20% of
gross domestic product, spend the same GDP percentage as Germany on road
and rail infrastructure, and so on.
The source of this approach may rankle in some political quarters.
But, given Michael Heseltine's welcome admission that all is not as it
seems in Britain's economic miracle, isn't there something here on which
to build a consensus for action before it really is too late?

AS an exploration of the world of debt collectors this Traverse
Theatre production of the new play by Mike Cullen strikes an appropriate
but overwhelmingly gloomy note. The men who hound the debt-ridden
survive by cultivating an ugly streak of cynicism, exemplified in the
grasping, exploitative morality of the Recovery Manager, Joe Cravis,
played with an ugly nasal whine by Michael Nardone.
Like David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross the action is centred around
the men's workplace, and like that play the plot is propelled by
redundancy-threat and cut-throat tactics of betrayal and revenge.
Bob Lawson is for the chop; known in the trade as The Truck -- ''he
always delivers'' -- he has just collected a conscience, following the
suicide of one of his female customers. Plunged into a moral morass
which has him simultaneously questioning the erotic kick he gets from
the power over the women he collects from and exacerbating this
power-play by secretly recording their pleading entreaties, he fails to
do his job properly.
Cullen's muscular dialogue is redolent with callousness, crudity, and
emotional corruption. Characters continually interrupt one another and
often, failing to pin down the language they need to describe feelings
that haunt them, they falter. The silence of these heavily-laden
ellipses can be singularly revealing and the melodramatic snatches of
guitar riff which punctuated this production, directed by Ian Brown,
seem an unnecessary distraction.
Frank Gallagher is excellent as Lawson, gradually revealing a frailty
and despair, and Kenneth Bryans was chilling as his explosive colleague
Billy Shaw. Less impressive was Pauline Knowles's over-hysterical
portrayal of Elena, who is manipulated by all three men to various
degrees of gratification.

ABTRUST New Thai Investment Trust has made a little headway in its
year to February 28 despite a 10.4% decline in the sterling-adjusted
local stock market index.
The Thai market fell by 15.5% in the second half of the #27m trust's
second half. Over the year as a whole Abtrust New Thai increased its net
asset value by 1.6% to 181.86p.
Dividend receipts have risen strongly and earnings per share jumped
from 1.37p to 2.60p. The final dividend is 1.1p (1.0p) on top of which
there is a special dividend of 0.65p.
The trust's chairman, Alan Henderson, said: ''With the stock market
having effectively marked time over the last year, it now stands on a
prospective price earnings multiple of around 15.
''We consequently view the outlook for 1995 with confidence.''

SCOTLAND continued to be the star performer for the CWS retail
operations last year with its contributing an extra 22% of profits at
#26.1m on sales 5.7% higher at #442m.
That has resulted in a highly-commendable 5.9% margin given that many
of the 186 shops are in remote areas with low levels of turnover but
benefiting from the same price list as in urban areas.
Chief executive David Skinner said that margins had increased through
higher efficiency and a strong market position with like-for-like sales
last year improving 2%.
At present they are level pegging, maintaining the Scottish Co-op's
market share at over 12% of the Scottish grocery market.
In some areas, it is actually gaining share. This was confirmed
independently by a food-processing company which has seen higher volumes
destined for Scotland.
Agriculture, chiefly in Aberdeenshire, has also performed well.
However, the results for the rest of the UK were less buoyant although
most regions did show an improvement.
Overall profits before share interest and dividend more than doubled
from #24.2m to #57.2m. That was struck after provisions for redundancy
and other costs totalling including #7.3m for peripheral activities.
Milk was under pressure with its contribution down #3.6m, helped by
the chaos created by the new quota system and the situation whereby
Britain is not allowed to be self-sufficient as well as by the decline
on doorstep deliveries.
Funeral profits held steady on higher turnover.
Merger talks with the Co-operative Retail Society which has a 2% share
of the UK grocery market compared with the near 3% of the CWS are in
abeyance.

WITH an unprecedented gap of 1000 points between the Dow-Jones and the
FTSE-100 share index Baillie Gifford's flagship Scottish Mortgage and
Trust has been selling stock on Wall Street and reinvesting the proceeds
in the UK.
The #1067m trust suffered a fall of 5.7% in its net asset value to
241.56p a share in its year to March 31. This compared with a drop of
1.5% in the All-Share index and 3.1% in the sterling-adjusted World
Index.
The trust, which has 12% of its funds in gilts and other bonds, is
doing much better on the revenue front. Earnings per share jumped by
26.5% to a record 5.21p, and shareholders are to get an
inflation-beating increase of 7.3% in their dividend with a final of 3p
raising the total to 4.4p.
Max Ward, who manages this large internationally diversified
investment trust, has invested a net #33m in UK equities on the back of
the good performance of the economy and strong results from the
corporate sector.
This has been largely financed by net sales of #26m in the US. Mr Ward
thinks that American valuations are unattractive and that it will be
difficult to return the US economy to a sustainable growth rate in an
orderly fashion.
The bulk of the switch was carried out in the final quarter of the
financial year. Mr Ward said that the UK economy was in much better
shape than the US and that sterling was undervalued against the dollar.
The pound had been dragged down by the dollar for the wrong reasons.
In the UK, dividends had been significantly ahead of expectations and
he expected this to continue in the current year.
Although Scottish Mortgage's asset showing in the latest year was
uncharacteristically weak, the longer-term performance remains strong.
Over five years net asset value rose by 48.2%, well ahead of the 38%
advance in the All-Share index and the 32% rise in the World index.
The upsurge in earnings is mainly attributable to the gilts portfolio
built up over the last two years. A further #69m was invested in gilts
towards the end of last summer taking the total to #128m by the end of
the financial year.
This portfolio has been effectively financed by variable rate sterling
borrowings which have consistently provided a generous running margin.
At March 31, 51.2% of the trust's assets were invested in UK equities,
14.4% in Continental Europe, 5.1% in the Americas, 3% in Japan, and
13.4% in Asia Pacific.
Mr Ward said the main portfolio emphasis continued to be on the UK,
Continental Europe, and the smaller Asian markets at the expense of the
US and Japan.
Unchanged at 225p the shares yield 2.4%. Despite the uncertain
background in the US, Scottish Mortgage is optimistic about investment
prospects. Mr Ward said the interest rate environment was becoming less
hostile.

SIR Denys Henderson bowed out as chairman of ICI yesterday in
spectacular fashion as he revealed a huge jump in first-quarter profits.
Before exceptional items they more than trebled from #93m to #221m as
the upturn in the chemical cycle came through in a dramatic way. He also
indicated there was a good chance of higher dividends on the way.
Sir Denys announced the figures at his final annual meeting, after
which he retired. His eight years at the top saw major changes in ICI,
the major one, of course, being the demerger of Zeneca.
Sir Denys had to overcome some scepticism in the boardroom over this
but it has certainly turned out to have been a sound move.
Apart from this Sir Denys stamped ICI with a new determination to
deliver shareholder value through promoting efficiency and reshaping the
portfolio into more growth areas.
ICI managed to hold its dividend through the recession but sensibly
decided not to increase it last year, even though the upturn had began
to come through. It was necessary to build cover before sanctioning an
increase. Now this is approaching the target level of 1.5 to two times
so a rise looks likely.
Rising volume and prices on a lower cost base in industrial chemicals
was largely behind the first-quarter upsurge. Trading profits of the
division jumped by #101m to #143m on a 21% increase in sales to #1101m.
Prices were particularly firm in petrochemicals and fertilisers, after
several years of depression. This enabled higher raw material costs to
be more than recouped and firmer prices also helped paints, explosives
and materials.
Overall turnover was up 15%, with volume up 10% and prices 8%, partly
offset by divestments and exchange rate movements. ICI maintains
industrial demand remains firm but consumer confidence in North America
and Europe, including the UK, is still subdued and will continue to
restrain businesses which are near to the end-users. This relates mainly
to paints, where ICI's Dulux brand is the best known in the UK. Here
profits actually fell from #17m to #14m despite a 7% sales gain.
Higher volume and firmer prices were insufficient to offset higher raw
material costs. Sales were strong in North America and Asia Pacific but
weak in Europe.
The geographically diverse regional business contributed 89% more at
#34m, with Australia and chlor-chemicals in Canada making the running.
ICI is continuing to take steps to improve its performance and is not
just relying on a recovery in its markets. Over the past year it has
floated its joint venture PVC company, EVC, and sold its remaining
holding in AECI in South Africa, while increasing its interest in
explosives, used in the mining industry.
The explosives business worldwide has been reshaped and ICI has
withdrawn from nitro-glycerine following the death of 11 employees in
South Africa.
On the investment side, ICI has been busy, planning two large plants
in Taiwan and Pakistan to make textile fibres; building a plastics plant
for soft drink bottles in North Carolina and a polyurethane plant in
Europe; expanding the acrylics business bought from DuPont; and
investing in paints in South-east Asia.
This will be carried forward by ICI's new chairman, Sir Ronnie Hampel,
who was previously chief executive, a post now occupied by Charles
Miller Smith who for many years was with Unilever. Among his priorities
will be to keep costs in paints and explosives under tight control.
ICI shares climbed 12p to 770p and analysts were pleased enough with
the first-half outcome to revise their full-year estimates upwards. But
some are worried that the cycle for industrial chemicals may already be
nearing its peak so are not keen on the shares, though they look
modestly rated at about 11 times prospective earnings and yield of
perhaps 4.8%.
ICI reckons the chemicals upturn still has quite a way to go,
particularly in Germany, where recovery is now coming through. But it is
likely to remain difficult to raise prices the nearer the product is to
the consumer.
Though it has stripped out #500m worth of costs over four years, the
group reckons it can still do more to manage the cost base even better.
And it could add that Sir Ronnie will want to prove he is a worthy
successor to his dynamic predecessor.

Margaret Hughes discovers the marvels of the Perth Food Festival, a
celebration of the best in the shire
IF you were going to choose anywhere in Scotland to have a food
festival then Perthshire, with its rich larder of local produce, would
have to be a natural choice. So, it is not surprising the Perth Food
Festival, now in its second year, is going from strength to strength.
This year the festival runs for 10 days, from yesterday until May 6,
and embraces a wide range of events from the Gala Dinner -- at the
Station Hotel on May 3 -- to Victorian dishes recreated in Brambles
Coffee Shop.
Although events will be taking place throughout Perthshire, Perth is
the hub of the festival. Douglas Stanfield, general manager at the
city's Station Hotel and chairman of the Perth Food Festival organising
committee, explains the philosophy behind the event: ''The idea is to
help raise awareness of Perthshire as a tourist destination, but also as
an excellent place to set up in business.
''It is also a good opportunity to show that as well as having some of
the best produce in the country, we also have some of the best cooking
talent.''
The Perth Food Festival grew out of the Food Proms, which last year
moved to Glasgow. Stanfield says the success of the Food Proms prompted
the festival's continuance.
The Gala Dinner features 12 local chefs and a wide range of excellent
fare. At #50 for a ticket, which includes a champagne reception, wine,
and liqueurs, it is excellent value for money.
Last year's Gala Dinner was a sell-out. Stanfield believes its success
will be repeated this year. He says: ''Last year we had no problem
filling the 150 places. This year we have increased it to 180 and are
optimistic we will sell out.''
REALISTICALLY events like this are more likely to attract serious food
fans and corporate diners, but as the organisers stress, the festival
has something to attract everyone's tastes and pockets.
Vivaldi -- The Four Seasons brings together classical music and
seasonally themed food in the Willows Coffee Shop &amp; Restaurant. Members
of the Perth Youth Orchestra will play a selection of musical
accompaniments as guests wend their way through a calendar of courses.
At the Huntingtower Hotel the Auld Alliance dinner will celebrate the
relationship between Scotland and France with a menu themed around
Scottish and French cooking.
Vegetarians are not forgotten. At the Stakis City Mills Hotel
vegetarian dishes will feature throughout the festival.
For those who wish to replicate some of the dishes they encounter at
the festival, Starters for 10 is a series of lunchtime cookery
demonstrations. Peter Graham and his brigade of chefs will prepare and
allow you to sample 10 different starters for the price of one.

* WITH store wars showing no signs of abating, high street shoppers
have seldom had it so good. But you might do still better -- with the
Factory Shop Guide for Scotland, just out in a new edition by former
zoologist Gill Cutress.
She applies an analytical mind to classifying local manufacturers
selling direct to the public at bargain prices.
Food and drink, clothes, knitwear, carpets, curtains, furniture,
pottery, electricals, and a whole lot more make the guide -- complete
with maps and phone numbers, a snip at #4.50. From bookshops, or phone
0181 678 0593. Also worth keeping in the glove compartment: the Which?
Guide to Country Shopping, out this week, lists hundreds of small
businesses selling specialities like smoked salmon, cheeses and
preserves, and handicraft goods. Price #13.99.
* A CLARION call has gone out for every Scots biker to take to the
road on May 20 -- M-Day, the culmination of National Motorcycle Month.
According to Don Rutherford, of Scotbike Motorcycles, Glasgow: ''The
sight of all one million of us out that day will reinforce the message
that bikes exist and take up little road space.'' To join in, call Don
on 0141-331 1199.
* IF your reference dictionary doesn't list Tony Blair, chances are it
will also fail to enlighten you about such recent linguistic arrivals as
barfly jumping and reverse engineering. The 15,000 extended entries in
the new edition of the Oxford English Reference Dictionary (from OUP,
#19.99) includes ableism, telecottage, and unprofor -- a word generated
by the war in Bosnia. They join business and hi-tech buzzwords like
kaizen, genco, buckyball, and viewgraph. Maradona merits ten lines, but
Eric Cantona's Kung-fu kick just missed the deadline. However community
service order has made it.
* VEGETARIAN Week starts on May 14 and the supermarkets are staking a
claim in an increasingly lucrative market as health and animal welfare
issues turn millions off meat. Sainsbury leads the way with a tasty
range of quick and nutritious meals, including vegetarian sausages,
spicy beanburgers, chilli, and cottage pie.
* BUDDING social climbers can get an early start with Early Learning
Centre's climbing frame. As well as working off excess energy, the frame
-- according to the centre -- encourages development of social skills
and conversation as children play together. Cost: #69.95. Other
springtime specials include a see-saw roundabout for #29.95 for
under-sevens and a large slide at #59.95.
* LEAVE Sunday lunch to the menfolk this weekend and head for
Scotstoun Leisure Centre is the advice from Glasgow City Council's
women-in-sport team. The #7 entry fee to Women's Activity Day (starting
10am) buys seven hours' access to indoor tennis coaching, aquafit,
swimming, aerobics, box'r'cise (useful if you're late home),
aromatherapy, and health suites, plus a healthy lunch. Creche facilities
are available, with a duckling's class for parents and toddlers.
Juveniles pay #3.50. For details phone 0141-227 5933 or 0141-305 7645.

MICHAEL FRY serves up a sprinkling of cookbooks
MAGGIE BLACK &amp; DEIRDRE LE FAYE: The Jane Austen Cookbook British
Museum Press, #10.99 KATHRYN HAWKINS: Light Chinese Dishes Salamander
Books, #8.99 LOUISE PICKFORD: Feasting on Fish Salamander Books, #12.99
MANY people think Oriental cuisine too light, fish suppers on the way
home being a notorious sequel to nights out in Chinese restaurants. But
recent research has found them guilty of that most horrible of modern
sins, using a lot of fat. Kathryn Hawkins's book reassures us that
Eastern food can be prepared to the most rigorous Western standards of
healthy eating, and even reckons up the cholesterol in each dish for us.
This may not be altogether necessary because, as far as I know,
Chinese use of fat is more or less limited to oil, and that not of a
very saturated variety. True, Mongolians love to chew lamb's tails, but
they do not really count as members of the Middle Kingdom.
My old friend Professor Liu Wei of Hangchow, Red China's greatest
expert on Edmund Burke, told me during one of his scholarly visits that
his compatriots can think of nothing more disgusting than dairy
products. If they ever hear about the concept of cheese, they find it
utterly revolting, and even butter would make their toes curl.
This conversation proceeded as we sat down to a gastronomic evening at
his favourite restaurant in Edinburgh, and he invited me to compare
those sensations with my own if I learned of some delicacies he liked.
''My favourite is owlets,'' he went on, ''such juicy little things,
though you do have to mind the claws.'' That did not strike me as too
bad, but I had heard that the Chinese ate dog. ''Oh yes,'' he said, ''I
adore a spicy haunch of dog.'' And, er, rats: ''Only during famines!''.
Still, no such shocks await Ms Hawkins's readers, for she primarily
sets out to show that Chinese cuisine is compatible with our current
food-consciousness.
There is nothing really inauthentic among her recipes, except those
for turkeys -- surely a bird of the New World rather than the Orient? On
the other hand, Chinese methods of preparation, such as steaming and
stir-frying, fit her bill exactly. Not all ingredients will require you
to stray beyond your local high street, though it would certainly help
anyone wanting to employ this book systematically to have ready access
to a Chinese supermarket. Exotic items such as bok choy and hoisin crop
up often.
As good a way as any to test a new cookbook is to open it at random
and make the first thing you see. In my case, this was cod with vinegar
sauce, not the most exciting of the recipes, but hearty and toothsome.
You just grill oiled cod-steaks and add a coating made of shallots,
vinegar, sugar, soy sauce, and stock, reduced, thickened and seasoned,
garnished with chives. It was simple, but if you did not want to take
even that amount of trouble, a fish supper might be a perfectly adequate
substitute.
I tried the same test on Louise Pickford's book about fish. It is
beautifully produced, with mouth-watering photos by Gus Filgate. It
ranges widely, from snacks and starters to grand dishes for a dinner
party. Most, even of the latter, appear sensible, a virtue when many
rival collections of such specialist recipes call for types of fish that
seem impossible to buy.
Still, my initial impression was slightly deceptive. In this case, the
volume fell open at monkfish baked with bay leaves and garlic, a
scrumptious prospect. But the flavourings, together with slices of
lemon, were to be laid inside a monkfish's tail big enough to tie round
them. This proved a problem.
Perhaps Scottish fishmongers just cut the creature differently from
those where Ms Pickford lives, slicing the flesh away from the
cartilaginous spine rather than fiddling about to extract the spine from
the flesh. I have anyway a distinct impression that the tails have been
getting smaller in recent years, no doubt as even the bottom-dwelling
monk is overfished.
In any event I could find no piece that might hold a stuffing, and
without that it might dry out disastrously.
The problem was solved by reference to a classic French dish, filets
de lotte au gratin, as served most famously in the Charreton restaurant
at Les Halles, near Lyon. You slice the fish and mix it with its
flavourings -- it has such a robust taste that it will go with almost
anything -- add white wine and oil or butter, then bury the lot under
breadcrumbs. The topping takes the heat from the oven and browns, while
the fish stays moist. This was predictably delicious and, I think,
rather less bother than Ms Pickford's recipe.
Bother was ever a cook's lot till the twentieth century, so it has
always seemed to me curious that anyone should want to resurrect
historical recipes. Our cuisine assumes fresh ingredients of high
quality, to be prepared by one or two pairs of hands with a certain
amount of mechanical aid, and to be served to guests wishing to end up
satisfied but not bloated. In the past, meat was usually high and
sometimes stinking, hordes of servants did all the hard work, while
their betters ate and drank themselves into a stupor.
Even so, people do produce volumes of modernised recipes from ancient
Rome, medieval Florence and so on. Another example is the Jane Austen
Cookbook. It shows what an estimable lady might have eaten, if what she
stuffs into the characters in her novels is anything to go by. Its main
interest is literary rather than culinary.

CHRISTIAN Salvesen has shed the last of its manufacturing activities
with the sale of its Vikoma oil spill recovery subsidiary to Southern
Vectis for an initial #4.4m.
The disposal was already forecast with Salvesen in recent months
having sold its successful brick-making business to a management buy-out
group supported by CIN-Ven for #63.5m and also its far less than
successful Light &amp; Sound Design rock concert lighting business for #2m
or at an #8m loss on the purchase price in 1991.
Vikoma lost #400,000 in the first six months helped by the low oil
price but it is thought to have made an overall profit for the full year
which ended last month. Normally, it should make on-going profits of
about #1m.
Southern Vectis is a bus operator on the Isle of Wight -- Vectis is
the Latin name for the island -- and is financially strong.
The sale has occurred because Vikoma, which has won a Queen's Award
for Exports, is a non-core business.
Salvesen chief executive Dr Chris Masters said that the
Edinburgh-based company is in the right strategic shape now,
concentrating on international distribution, specialist hire and food
services.
In distribution, it is in the top three in Europe with the barriers
actually now falling.

DAWSON International has sold Premier Fabrics to Yorklyde for a total
of #3.35m, including the Yorkshire-based specialist woven fabrics
company, taking on #700,000 of Premier's debt.
In the year to April 1, Premier contributed #6.7m to the textile
group's sales and incurred losses of #400,000.
Finance director George Fairweather said that it had been finding life
difficult as its produces the fabric for airline inner walls and seat
covers for Airbus and Boeing at a time when the world aircraft industry
has been under pressure.
Dawson is currently transferring machinery from Premier's Ayr factory,
which has been closed, to Peebles.
Yorklyde is very much the natural buyer of the business as its Alex
Begg subsidiary's factory is adjacent to Premier's British Replin
operations in Ayr.
There are no other disposals contemplated apart from the sale of the
Dawson Home Fashions business in the US which is going through the
details of the contract with Springs Industries.
Yorklyde also has Scottish representation through Arthur Bell of
Langholm which is now busier than it has been for several years, helped
by Far East orders.
It is raising #2.3m through a placing and open offer at 245p per
share. Last year, it increased pre-tax profits 36% to #4.1m and is
raising the dividend total from 6p to 7.25p.

THERE continue to be mixed fortunes for Britain's retailers, writes
NICOLA REEVES.
Shares in Betterware, the direct household goods retailer, lost
3[1/2]p to 43p yesterday as the company reported a sharp drop in
profits.
In the year to February 25 its pre-tax profits slumped to just #1m
compared with #14m previously. Turnover was down 8% to #58.3m. The
dividend was cut from 1.95p to 1.75p.
Betterware blamed the result on lower sales volumes in the UK caused
by a fall in the size of the salesforce. However, the company said it
was confident that sales growth could be restored despite the recent
increase in competition.
The business and management are said to have been restructured and a
significant cost-reduction programme has been established. Betterware
chairman Andrew Cohen said he felt ''confident that these measures will
improve Betterware's position and prospects''.
In contrast, Austin Reed continues to benefit from increased
productivity both in its stores and manufacturing operations. Profit
before tax rose by 6% to #7.3m last year on 9% higher sales. Profits
were boosted by #1.3m of exceptional income from a rates rebate on its
flagship store in London's Regent Street.
The company also has stores in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Perth and Aberdeen.
Strong demand for its Sportsman leisurewear range across the group
helped to boost trading as new younger customers were enticed into the
stores. Its manufacturing business benefited from increased orders from
North America and Continental Europe. There is a final dividend of 4.0p,
making a total of 6.0p for the full year, an increase of 9%.
So far, trading in the current year is said to be tough. However,
further productivity gains are expected to enable profits to move ahead.
Despite the good results Austin Reed shares lost 14p to 211p.

SAATCHI &amp; Saatchi, now a subsidiary of the new holding company
Cordiant, has received a shot in the arm by winning a major account,
writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Kingfisher is moving its #24m account for its Comet chain of
electrical shops to Saatchi from Abbot Mead Vickers, which has had the
business since 1988.
The move makes Kingfisher Cordiant's largest client with accounts
totalling #75m as it already handles the group's other divisions, B&amp;Q,
Woolworths and Superdrug.
Dixons' decision to follow Maurice Saatchi and quit Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
paved the way for Comet to come as the agency could not handle two
competing electrical chains.
Comet chairman Eddie Styring commented: ''We wanted to take a new look
at our advertising and this enables us to do that at the same time as
going to an agency with outstanding creative and brand-building
strengths, proven retail strengths, proven retail technical skills and
that is within a group committed to Kingfisher.''

It used to be that a glass of milk was one of the simplest things
around -- but these days, go into a supermarket and you will be
confronted with a bewildering array of varieties. Settle back with a cup
of tea while Jennifer Cunningham guides you through what's on offer
Long-life milk is tolerable in coffee, but intolerable in tea
THERE are exceptions to every rule, but almost all of us pour milk on
our breakfast cereal. That's why it is one of the most stable items in
the grocery trade -- to the extent that a drop or increase of 0.5% in
retail sales is significant.
Not subject to the seasonal or fashionable fluctuations which affect
exotic fruits and vegetables, or even varieties of cheese which move in
and out of favour, milk is no longer just milk. The discerning customer
has to choose first between whole cream and semi-skimmed: with each now
holding about half the market share. Skimmed, or ''virtually fat free''
as the retailers describe it, has few takers, accounting for only 5% of
the market, mainly on health grounds.
There are now several different competitive events going on in
different parts of the milk lake. As well as the traditional straight
sprint to the lowest price, there is the niche competition, split into
two sections: health and quality. Ease of handling lines up against
environmental friendliness in the packaging stakes.
Health includes soya, rice, and goats' milk for people allergic to
cows' milk and for vegans who will not eat any animal products. Quality
includes organic milk and specialist products such as Ayrshire milk and
Jersey milk. Despite the increasing choice, presumably fuelled by
demand, the niche market remains small: less than 1% of the overall
market according to the chief executive of the Scottish Dairy
Association, Donald McQueen.
Those who have moved into it say their customers are so enthusiastic
about high quality products that they are unswervingly loyal. Marks &amp;
Spencer switched to selling only Ayrshire milk (from Ayrshire herds
farmed in Ayrshire) in its Scottish stores 18 months ago. ''We chose it
because it was a quality product and there was a separate collection and
transport system available. We sell it in the three grades of whole,
half-cream, and virtually fat-free and it has been selling very well,''
said their spokeswoman.
Paul Knight, a member of the co-operative which runs Grassroots in
Glasgow, which specialises in organic and vegetarian foods, said soya
milk and goats' milk were both bought on a regular basis by people with
allergies to cows' milk, with some customers buying three or six months'
supply in frozen or dried form.
Demand for soya milk in Glasgow has increased enormously in 10 years,
due mainly to people allergic to cows' milk, according to Martin
Netyard, of wholesalers Greencity Wholefoods. ''We started in 1984 and
now we sell pallets of it. Sales of organic milk are also increasing. We
started in August with six pallets a week and now we are up to 18,'' he
said.
Netyard attributes the demand to increasing concern for animal welfare
from people who are willing to pay a little more for milk from a source
guaranteed to meet certain requirements. ''The taste of soya milk has
improved. It used to have a chalky aftertaste, but they seem to have
overcome that,'' he added.
It is reassuring to learn that taste still plays a major part in our
choice. The failure of UHT milk to take more than 3% of the market,
attributed to caravanners, campers, and others without fridges, is
linked to a taste not favoured by the British palate, although it
outsells fresh milk in some areas of Europe. It could be because we are
a country of tea-drinkers: ''Long-life milk is tolerable in coffee, but
intolerable in tea,'' said Donald McQueen.
The announcement this week by one of the biggest supermarket chains,
Tesco, that in five months' time all their milk will be sold in plastic
bottles, has rung in a new round in the packaging battle. Tesco's
spokeswoman, Josephine Wan, said: ''At present, only four-pint and
six-pint are available in plastic bottles, but our research shows that
92% of people prefer them.''
Naturally Tetrapak, the carton-makers, are fighting their corner.
Plastic bottles will push up the price, according to their man, Jimmy
Hartley. ''Our new plastic ring-pull carton has been greatly welcomed,
especially by elderly people, who find it easy to open and close.
''The dairies like them because they can be filled very fast, at the
rate of 9000 an hour. A recent increase in the cost of polyethylene from
#300-#400 per ton to #800 per ton on a world basis also makes paper
cartons very economical.''
The drawback of cartons is that they cannot contain much more than a
litre, so large plastic bottles of four or six pints can be sold at less
per pint. Plastic containers have been very important in allowing
supermarkets to offer price discounts.
Four-pint plastic bottles have established a central place in a new
pattern of buying milk, especially in suburban areas, which includes a
regular delivery of one or two pints a day backed up by a large
container from a shop once or twice a week. That change in turn has
reduced the amount of milk sold in returnable glass bottles.
Doorstep deliveries were never as high a proportion of the retail milk
business in Scotland (where they now account for 18%) as in England (now
45%). According to Donald McQueen, the stronger tradition of buying milk
in shops caused the supermarket trade in milk to develop more rapidly
here, and shop sales are now 50% in multiple retailers and 50% between
corner shops and ''symbol'' chains of independent retailers like Spar.
Since it is obviously easier to return a bottle to the doorstep than
to a shop, most shop sales are now in ''one-way packages'' -- roughly
40% cartons, 60% plastic. The average glass milk bottle in Scotland
makes 10 journeys, although some dairies claim as many as 56. It is more
expensive to produce than a carton but becomes very economical if it
makes multiple journeys, with break-even point at about six.
The original cardboard milk carton was invented by an American, Victor
Farris, whose 1930s patent made him a fortune once estimated at #200m.
His Scots-born wife, Celia Lipton, later donated much of it to charity.
The environmental arguments are complex. Returnable bottles are
environmentally friendly, but not if they end up as broken glass under a
hedge or on the pavement. They also weigh more, so a van-load requires
more fuel to move it. The best prospect for some time is a new,
re-usable polycarbonate bottle successfully re-filled in Germany and
Holland.
George Baxter, of Friends of the Earth Scotland, says non-returnable
cartons and plastics are a backward step. ''Our priority is to encourage
re-use over recycling. It makes more sense environmentally and is
clearly the way forward. Without discounting the glass bottle, the
polycarbonate returnable scores well on environmental grounds and would
gain our support over non-returnables.''

LET me just see if I've got this right. Successive Tory governments
over the past 15 years have wrought a dramatic transformation in the
British economy. Cripplingly high corporate taxes have been slashed.
Inefficient state enterprises have been reborn, streamlined and
competitive, through being privatised. Markets have been liberalised.
Union power has been curbed.
I know I've got that bit right. I could recite it in my sleep, given
the number of times I've sat through speeches by senior members of the
Major Cabinet, reciting that relentless litany of achievement as if
they'd all swallowed the same autocue on their way out of some
television studio. But let me just see if I've got the rest of the
message straight.
In our biggest export market -- the rest of Europe -- British
competitiveness has been given a razor-sharp new edge by the Major
Government's gritty refusal to have anything to do with the social
chapter of the Maastricht Treaty. In export markets, in general, British
trade has been boosted by the sizeable devaluation of sterling since we
were bundled out of the European exchange rate mechanism.
Ministers might quibble over that precise interpretation of our ERM
exit. You know how touchy the Tory Party is these days about its
internal fault lines on Europe. But it's the next bit where I'm not at
all sure the message is as I thought I heard it.
Fifteen years on, there is, apparently, a report lying on ministerial
desks in the Department of Trade and Industry analysing the UK's market
share in our top 80 markets. Despite the aforementioned transformation
of corporate UK under the Tories, the survey does not, it seems, make
encouraging reading.
It reports that our share of these key markets continues to erode; and
that share continues to shrink because Britain, which can boast some
global stars in its corporate firmament, still has far too many
second-rate enterprises which are being cuffed by the opposition,
despite everything this Government has done for them.
Worse, these poor performers are being cuffed not by competition from
the emerging economies of Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America, where
wages and conditions are even lower than social chapter-free Britain,
but by high-wage mature economies, like Germany and Japan.
You think I'm making all this up? Well clearly you weren't listening
to Wednesday's keynote address to the Institute of Directors' springfest
in London's Albert Hall by the president of the Board of Trade, Michael
Heseltine. Heseltine was uncompromising in his warning that
self-congratulation and complacency over what has been achieved since
1979 is ''dangerous and self-deluding''.
He's the one with the report on his desk. He told the IoD: ''One stark
lesson stares out of the figures. Our market share has not been eroded
by low-cost Asian economies. The toughest competition we have
traditionally faced has come, and is coming, from high-cost, well-paid
Western European, North American, and Japanese companies.
''In far too many of the 80 markets it is not the UK which has the
largest share, but Germany. Germany is a country which, up to now, has
overcome its higher costs by higher productivity, producing top quality
products that customers want to buy. It has achieved this through high
investment and a highly skilled workforce.''
The president of the Board of Trade went on to argue that the best of
British companies are equal to anything to be found in Germany. ''But
too many of our companies are not; and it is averages that count, and
the UK has a long tail of under-achievers. You know it, I know it,
survey after survey shows it.''
I salute Heseltine's honesty. But the implications of that depressing
report, and his acceptance of its findings, for the party of which he is
a prominent member (and which, according to those who know these things,
he still aspires to lead) are profound.
If British industry is to be revived, in depth, to the extent that it
begins to win back market share around the globe, more is clearly needed
than top-rate tax cuts, rejection of the Maastricht social chapter, and
a lot of hollow hype about the enterprise culture.
Mr Heseltine makes it clear he knows that more is needed. Germany has
overcome the higher costs of the social chapter, he tells us, through
high investment and a highly skilled workforce. The conclusion is
unmistakable. We must invest more in productive capacity and the skills
of our people if we are to turn the tide.
By coincidence, CBI Scotland published its Business Agenda yesterday,
following through a process started last September with the challenging
Manufacturing Matters report. The Agenda extends the Heseltine analysis.
''We have failed,'' it says, ''to convert our immense intellectual
property to its full potential of competitive products and tradeable
services. Our productive investment, infrastructure, and skills have
fallen behind our key competitors.''
But the Agenda's authors are not content with adding to the existing
piles of depressing comparative analysis. They offer a framework for
action which they intend to debate with an array of other interest
groups in Scotland in both the public and private sectors.
The Agenda starts from the assumption that wealth must be created
before it can be used to raise the living standards and quality of life
right across our society. I doubt if New Labour would demur from that
any more than the Tory Party, Heseltinian wing or not.
CBI Scotland goes on to propose a number of targets on economic
fundamentals and future levels of productive investment, on education
and training, and on infrastructure, which are benchmarked against
world-class standards. Thus we should strive to invest more than 20% of
gross domestic product, spend the same GDP percentage as Germany on road
and rail infrastructure, and so on.
The source of this approach may rankle in some political quarters.
But, given Michael Heseltine's welcome admission that all is not as it
seems in Britain's economic miracle, isn't there something here on which
to build a consensus for action before it really is too late?

WHIPPED OUT, they have been roped in with a velvet lasso. But the
obliging return of the Government's Euro-rebels makes me wonder if they
really know why they rebelled in the first place. None of them is young,
with the certainty of the young and that clarity of vision which allows
the young such flawless definitions, such perfect perceptions of their
own motivation. Me, I find the older I get the more incomprehensible my
behaviour becomes.
Take, for example, a summer day in Interlaken in the near-past. I have
nipped into the Victoria Jungfrau Hotel to use its imperial loo, and I'm
now sitting at a table on its terrace. A waiter approaches, with a
desire to serve. This being German-speaking Switzerland he uses the
polite interrogative ''Bitte?'' which instantly expends one of my three
words of German. ''Rien,'' I reply. ''J'attends quelqu'un.''
Here is the mystery: why should I find myself impulsively speaking
French to a German-speaking waiter in a Swiss resort where almost
everyone in the tourist sector speaks some English? I can only conclude
I was ashamed to use my native tongue; that the deployment of any
language from continental Europe was preferable to the lazy option of
English; that I didn't want to be identified with the linguistic
hegemonists of the English-speaking world.
Cultural snobbery, I suppose; a peculiar kind of inverted xenophobia.
I'm not ashamed of being British, but I am embarrassed about being
British and unable to speak any foreign language other than halting,
conversational French and monosyllabic trattoria Italian. Among the many
primitive emotions (and few rational arguments) which inflame the
popular debate on our European future is, I'm convinced, the
Anglophone's fear of the reflexive verb. Must we all learn languages
which construct their sentences back to front and give their common
nouns gender identities?
Language, or lack of it, is the Achilles heel in the body corporal of
British self-esteem, and the sense of humiliation about our poor
performance in other European tongues amounts to more than a footling
weakness.
The ability to make ourselves understood -- even to communicate the
most simple needs -- is crucially tied into our feelings of worth, and
the shock of deprivation returns us to the nursery.
It isn't always arrogance which causes the Fawltyesque British
traveller to raise his voice to foreigners. It's more often tension,
even terror: the schoolboy's dread of the playground taunt of ''Dummy!''
If there was one thing I envied about the luminaries of the
international community I met in Marbella the other week, it was not
their villas, their Mercedes or their credit lines at the Monte Carlo
Sporting Club, but their fluency in several languages.
Spanish, English, German, and French were passed round the dinner
table like the salt and pepper. (Not always to good purpose: one remnant
of the Austro-Hungarian empire told me she used her faultless English to
follow the O J Simpson trial on CNN, and even videoed it when she went
out.) Their conspicuous affluence and social celebrity didn't make me
feel inferior; their many tongues did.
I'm not alone. A Yorkshireman once told me that when he went to live
in Bordeaux he spent two months eating nothing but ham and peas because
''jambon'' and ''pois'' were the only shopping words he remembered from
his classroom French. ''I couldn't bring myself to point or use sign
language,'' he said. ''It made me feel like an idiot.''
There spoke an honest Englishman, confident of his place in the world,
secure in the knowledge that he need only return home to recover the
power of speech. It doesn't take much imagination to see how his
experience must crushingly affect the incomer who is already
disadvantaged by race or colour. Every language has its minefields of
nuances for the non-native speaker, but the French produce a
particularly unhappy catch-22 for their African immigrants.
If the African learns his French from the natives he may develop an
unwittingly maladroit ''tu-toi'' habit. The French are themselves now
less fastidious with the distinction between the familiar ''tu'' and the
respectful ''vous'', but those who ''tu-toi'' their immigrant employees
or neighbours are not being friendly. At best the form patronises, at
worst it puts them down.
Many Africans never learn to use the more formal ''vous'' and in turn
''tu-toi'' the French indiscriminately, which offends them . . . fuels
their prejudices . . . and so on. Our own language may not have such
precisely-engineered pitfalls, but I've seen the same response of tight
lip and dagger glance when Asian shopkeepers call their customers
''dear'' or ''love''.
For all their finger-in-the-dyke struggle to maintain the purity of
the French language and resist the imperatives of US street argot, for
all their very British sense of cultural superiority, the French have
long since shown themselves open to the need to master at least one
other language, usually English. (As well they might, the smug
Anglophone will say; it is, after all, the language of international
commerce and diplomacy, and it's just hard cheese that in the nineteenth
century French was the lingua franca of the civilised world).
When I took a sabbatical in Paris in the seventies, I used to earn
spare francs by ''animating'' classes of business personnel who were
learning English through the state-subsidised provisions of ''formation
continue'' -- the adult education system available to all French
employees.
In my role as ''animateur'' I gave little talks on Scotland and
answered questions (they only ever asked about the Loch Ness Monster)
and I didn't have to speak French at all, not even at lunch; which was
good for their English but rotten for my French.
In the time I spent in Paris the process of recovering something of my
Higher certificate French was an exquisite torment. I took lessons with
a school which specialised in a kind of linguistic mining -- digging up
buried knowledge from the bowels of the unconscious -- but even so I was
inhibited by the neurosis which most handicaps the foreign language
student: the compulsion to get it right.
Simply making myself understood wasn't good enough; I had to speak the
language correctly, which made me horribly slow. I'm afraid in those
good old days of neo-Freudian self-analysis I blamed my father, whose
ghost still stands at my shoulder correcting tenses when I try to speak
French. He was a gifted linguist but he was also an old-fashioned
dominie who taught French and German to immaculate standards; whereas
the people who speak foreign languages most easily and joyfully are
those who loosen their tongues with wine and goodwill and let the devil
take the Past Historic.

THE good news about this Mayfest is that those nice people at Opera on
a Shoestring get to have a crowd scene. Shoestring, for the unitiated,
is a small company set up last year to give your divas and Pavarottis
who are a bit lower down the scale a crack at the big roles.
Their previous shows have been of the greatest operatic hits variety
where three on the stage at any time was a crowd. Now they are doing a
full production of La Traviata with up to 15 at a time milling about the
stage at the Cottier Theatre in the West End of Glasgow. Except they
won't be milling because they have been rigorously rehearsed by a chap
called Terry Gilbert.
Gilbert is a famous choreographer whose vast list of works includes
Ken Russell's film Women in Love, complete with the Alan Bates-Oliver
Reed wrestling scene. He was also a main man in Four Weddings and a
Funeral.
Gilbert, who is used to working with huge film and opera house casts,
is busy putting the Shoestring people through a week of gruelling
14-hour-day rehearsals in a style which he describes as Hitlerian.
Christina Dunwoodie, the company's chief diva and bottle-washer, has
been rewarded for persuading Gilbert to take on the director's job by
his great idea of having her sing a rather difficult aria flat on her
back.
Gilbert promises us ''an elegant and engrossing production''. It will
be ''emotionally involving'' he says because it is being done in the
round. Which means the cast are in the middle and will be only feet away
from the audience they are singing at. It will be very different from
those seats away up in the gods which your average opera-goer can
usually only afford.
La Traviata, as you probably all already knew, is a tale of a sweet
young girl drawn into a life of greed and depravity. Which makes it an
ideal show for the West End of Glasgow.
As well as directing the show, Gilbert is busy trying to persuade the
Millenium Fund to put up cash for a new 24-hour TV channel which will
show opera, theatre, concerts, and other cultural goodies. He wants to
call it TV2000 and says it will reach a whole new audience apart from
''the usual old trouts'' who go to opera.
''Please don't upset our potential audience by referring to them as
old trouts,'' said Christina. We wouldn't dream of it.
La Traviata starts on Wednesday and there will be six performances. We
are sure old trouts and small fry will enjoy it equally.
All in the mind
A BOOK published by the national Council of Churches in the
Philippines has been brought to our attention. It is called Axiology and
Teleology of the Epistemology, Missiology and Praxology of Human Rights:
Understanding nature, Society, Culture and Consciousness.
It has chapters on such subjects as Thinking and Being: the Chicken
and the Egg, Empirio-Criticism or Machism, and the Implications of
Gnosiology. We were going to serialise but will settle, instead, for the
concluding paragraph:
''Clearly, there is a close relationship between being and thinking.
One has to think well in order to express well natural, kingdomistic,
interspeciesistic, human, social, and class realities. Hence, one must
have a careful axiology and teleology of the epistemology, missiology,
and praxiology of human rights. Then and only then can one engage in a
meaningful discourse or debate with others on questions related to human
rights matters.''
We couldn't agree more.
Head hunted
KILWINNING has a new parish priest. Airdrie-born Father John McClorey
takes over this week at St Winning's Church. Father McClorey is
eminently qualified for this post in Ayrshire's Burgh of Culture, having
spent the past 30 years working among head-hunter tribes in Borneo.
Grin and wear it
DIRECTORS from Icelandic Software of Reykjavik have been in Glasgow
visiting their sister company, Atlantic Information Systems. (Haud on,
it gets marginally more interesting.)
A Scottish evening was laid on for the visitors at Stonefield Castle
up Tarbet, Loch Fyne way. The male Icelanders were duly decked out in
full tartan fig and bused to the Highland venue. To while away the time
on the bus, a native guide proceeded to explain the various items of
Highland dress.
Struggling a bit to explain the sporran, she came up with the word
''smock''. Which left the Icelanders even more confused but quite
entertained. Smock being an Icelandic word for condom.
Couldn't be worse
OUR last mention, honest, of the Lobey Dosser Birthday party tomorrow
at the Halt Bar, 160 Woodlands Road, Glasgow at 2pm. As well as the
Lobey Lecture by Cliff Hanley and the music and wonderfully bad poetry
by Walter McCorrisken and the cheap beer and the free stovies and the
chance to be sworn in as a deputy sheriff of Calton Creek, you can also
avail yourselves of some items produced by Dosser Industries. These
include the jigsaw, the postcard, badges, and the T-shirt.

AS Oscar Wilde might have said, to be Irish and a patriot is bad
enough in English eyes, but to be homosexual as well looks like
carelessness. Alex Ferguson's apologia for the Dublin-born Sir Roger
Casement, executed for high treason just after the beginning of the
Easter uprising in 1916, makes no bones about the English
establishment's delight in discovering Casement's sexual orientation.
It allowed them to hang him not just for cavorting with the then enemy
-- Germany -- but to silence appeals at home or abroad (notably the US
where elections were pending). Condemnation twice over.
Casement therefore became a martyr to the cause. But as Ferguson's
historical epic also makes plain, he was, to some extent, also the
architect of his own downfall. In Corin Redgrave's excitable, vulnerable
and idealistically naive Casement, the Irishness that put him
instinctively on the side of oppressed people even as a consul for HM in
Africa, appears to have allowed his dreams of Irish Independence to run
away with him.
He believed the Germans when they promised to help arm his Irish
Brigade (the antiquated armoury when sent couldn't have won an argument,
even less a war, remarked one Irish colleague cryptically); he was
devoted to his young lover Adler, who later betrayed him to the English
and typically, when he was smuggled back to Ireland, it was to warn his
countrymen against the uprising.
Ferguson's unashamed anti-English bias may be too much for some
people, but Corin Redgrave and Gillian Hambleton's sweeping, stylish
production makes absorbing drama whichever way you look at it. Above
all, it casts recent Anglo-Irish-American events in a new light, as well
as being a keen reminder of England's long and dubious involvement in
Irish affairs.

THE defence rests. If 7:84's adaptation of the works of Peter
Sichrovsky is an example of the ensemble work that a Scots company can
come up with given a longer rehearsal period, let's have more of it. As
a nation gears up to celebrate the end of the Second World War (and
somehow that is not quite how it is coming across), this look at the
legacy of that conflict for the German people could not be more timely.
The surprise is that it is concerned as much with the effect on future
generations of the victims -- the Jews -- as much as it is with the
vanquished -- the Germans. It is a huge achievement that the piece
manages to amass so many points of view and so many arguments without
losing its audience. Director Iain Reekie and dramaturg Rainer Lau have
totted up the questions, the contradictions, and the absurdities of 50
years of post-war history and steadfastly refused to offer any clear
answers, and certainly not one unambiguous one.
Technically the show is also something of a triumph, integrating video
that uses documentary footage and section titles (Principles, Mistakes,
What Did You Know About The War?), songs and some very clever
choreography (by Vanessa Smith). The performances are also as uniformly
excellent as the grey serge of the costumes.
Alexa Kessalaar is a believable German archetype, and Anne Kidd's
working-class racist resentment is the only Glasgow accent. Michael
Perceval-Maxwell's Rudolf is a genuine homosexual hero, but the minority
-- or nationalist -- voice is always questioned as much as it is
supported.
I want to be proud that this piece of theatre originated in Scotland.
But then again.

IT may be 300 years since Henry Purcell wrote his music for The Fairy
Queen but last night's performance at the RSAMD demonstrated it can be
as entertaining today as it was meant to be way back then. Essentially a
concert production with some minimal staging the Academy Chamber Choir
joined forces with the Orchestra of the Early Music Course. Directing
was Catherine Mackintosh who tapped straight into the vitality of these
apprentice professionals inspiring with her own bubbly effervescence.
The show got off to a splendid start with the performers taking full
advantage of Purcell's gift of an opening scene with the Drunken Poet.
Richard Burkhard gave life to his verses ably spurred on by Jennifer
Nunn and Felicity Hammond. Hot on their heels came an all-round
convincing account of the echo episode with off-stage choruses and
trumpets on perfect cues. The second act was brought to a stunning close
with Iain Paterson, choir and orchestra evincing a deeply moving chorus.
Robin Greenway and Alexandra Rutherford turned out to be the next
stars with a nicely judged comic routine to wind up the third act. The
last two acts after the interval may have had less fun but were
compensated with some highly effective solos and choruses. Julie
Flanagan, Peter Van Hulle, Caroline-Louise Fairbrother and Wilma
McDougall making particularly strong contributions. And then there was
the orchestra who played their socks off all night for a dynamic,
supercharged Catherine Mackintosh.

SCOTTISH Nuclear's high road to success in an industry fighting for
every inch of pavement space is quickly turning into a race to avoid the
fast track to merger and sell-off.
Five years ago the operating loss of Britain's nuclear power stations
was a major factor behind the Government's decision not to expand its
privatisation of the electricity generating industries -- the cost of
decommissioning a string of outdated Magnox reactors was another.
However, the irony of the announcement this week of Scottish Nuclear's
record profits of #150m for 1994/95 and the strengthening of the
Government's desire to merge it with the English-based Nuclear Electric
has not been lost on those whose jobs and future are linked to the
industry.
The surge of Nuclear Electric's performance from a #14m deficit in
1990/91 to #361m profit in 1993/94 is a further indication of the main
road to privatisation.
Scottish Nuclear has in turn seen its raison d'etre for growth and
private ownership under a Scottish flag turned by political forces into
a flag of tax-cutting convenience, which has engendered cross-party
opposition, including that of a former Scottish Office minister and
other Tory MPs.
Despite indications in 1988 that the Thatcher Government would include
the nuclear industry in its privatisation plans, a year later they were
sidelined due to the cost of nuclear electricity, the poor performance
of the Advanced Gas Cooled Reactors (AGRs), the back-end liabilities of
the Magnox stations and the construction risk associated with Sizewell
B.
Since then operating performance has improved dramatically, back-end
liabilities have become more clearly defined and Sizewell B has been
successfully commissioned.
Stockbrokers and top company analysts James Capel UK yesterday said it
expected the UK nuclear generating industry to be privatised in the
summer of 1996.
Capel supports the merger of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear as
a move which would ''enhance the attraction of both companies and
produce a low-cost generating company with a 23% share of the UK
generation market.''
It predicts that the two companies will be privatised as a single
entity. The privatised company would consist of the five AGR stations at
Hinkley Point B, Dungeness B, Hartlepool, Heysham 1 and 2, and the new
Sizewell PWR currently owned by Nuclear Electric; and the two Scottish
AGR stations at Torness and Hunterston B.
However, the new privatisation scenario offers a threat rather than a
promise.
Scottish Nuclear's preferred option of privatisation under its own
banner -- or at worst a four-four split of the nuclear generating
stations -- has been sidelined by the Government's proposal to swallow
Scottish Nuclear into Nuclear Electric in the infamous 8-0 merger
option.
As leak and counter leak from the Treasury and Scottish Office add to
a state of confusion and speculation within Scottish Nuclear's East
Kilbride headquarters, the company is fighting to maintain its
independence from the ''English carpetbaggers''.
Until five years ago, Scotland's nuclear assets were a significant,
but financially unidentifiable, part of the South of Scotland
Electricity Board (SSEB). In 1990, the two Scottish privatised
electricity companies, Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric were created
and the nuclear assets transferred to the state-owned Scottish Nuclear.
Scottish Nuclear has seen steady financial growth from a #33m loss in
1990/91 to #150m profit in 1994/95.
Output from the two AGR stations at Hunterston B and Torness is sold
to Scottish Power (74.9%) and Hydro-Electric (25.1%). The company is
also responsible for decommissioning the old Magnox station Hunterston
A, which closed in March 1990 after 26 years of operation.
Scottish Nuclear provides 1750 jobs at its three sites and many more
indirectly through the contracts placed each year by the company. It
also injects more than #100m every year into the Scottish economy.
In December 1994, Scottish Nuclear set up a new subsidiary company,
Scottish Nuclear International (SNI) to carry out the company's growing
overseas market.
The road to success has seen generating costs fall to 2.2p per
kilowatt hour from 2.9p -- the lowest unit cost for a UK nuclear
generator. The company is on track to achieve its target of 2p per unit
by 1998. This is despite a run-down in production in 1993/94 to allow
for essential maintenance work.
It now predicts that further increases in output will be achieved when
modifications to the Torness fuel route enable on-load refuelling to be
carried out -- probably in June this year.
Chief Executive, Dr Robin Jeffrey, said the company's performance had
put it in a strong position to ''take on the challenges'' of
privatisation.
A high level source within Scottish Nuclear revealed that
privatisation re-appeared on the nuclear agenda in February 1993 after a
series of informed articles in the national press.
These articles were to form the forerunner to the Government's own
review of the nuclear and coal industries.
''Prior to that our only concern was to turn the business round from
loss-making to profit,'' explained the source.
In October 1993, it was revealed that although Scottish Nuclear was
on-course for privatisation, Nuclear Electric had dismissed the services
of three merchant banks who had each told their paymaster it was unable
to be privatised.
A nuclear symposium for Members of Parliament in November 1993 allowed
chief executive of Nuclear Electric, Dr Robert Hawley, to speculate on
the future. He argued for a positive PR campaign by the industry to
improve its public perception. Only in the light of recent developments
does the reasoning for this position become evident.
However, Dr Hawley also admitted Nuclear Electric's inability to
compete on a cost basis with Scottish Nuclear. He said: ''If we are
allowed to go-ahead with Sizewell C, it will be operational in the year
2001 and will be generating electricity at less than 3p per unit.''
Scotland's own AGR stations are already producing at a rate well below
that. The first indication of the Government's position regarding
privatisation came as MPs spoke on the terms of reference of the Nuclear
Review in May 1994.
Trade Minister Tim Eggar said the Government believed the role of
nuclear power in the future of the UK's electricity supply ''will depend
on it proving itself competitive''.
He said: ''The review will examine possible options for introducing
private sector finance into the nuclear industry.''
But the rub was to ''address the question of how best to manage the
substantial nuclear waste and decommisioning liabilities''.
Scottish Nuclear's response was a positive play to privatisation as a
single Scottish entity. Chairman, Mr James Hann, and Dr Jeffrey issued a
joint statement in which they mapped the way forward as a continued trek
to commercialisation in tandem with a ''restructuring'' to separate the
sucessful AGR reactors from the decommissioning of the old Magnox
liability.
''We believe this should then lead to privatisation and so continue
the transfer of the risk from the public to the private sector and
complete the Government's strategy for the electricity industry,'' they
said.
The construction of a new power station to replace Hunterston B after
2006 was financially ''only achievable'' if Scottish Nuclear was in the
private sector, they asserted.
''To secure a long term future, the company has to be put on the same
commercial footing as other generators; this can only be done by
privatising Scottish Nuclear plc.''
The case for privatisation was put in straightforward terms: Scottish
Nuclear plc to own and operate the AGR plants at Torness and Hunterston,
with the Magnox liabilities placed in a holding company which would be
either a limited company or a Government agency, to ensure that
decommissioning is properly and safely carried out.
Last night, a Scottish Nuclear source said that at the turn of the
year a number of leaks emanated from the Treasury that ''the best way
forward was division of the eight power stations into two groups of
four'', with Scottish Nuclear inheriting two English stations prior to
privatisation.
''We were told that the 8-0 merger option was not on,'' said the
source.
Five weeks ago, The Herald's Economics Editor Alf Young revealed
concerns by Scottish Nuclear that the merger option had become a
Government reality and the company was facing a ''hostile takeover bid
by Nuclear Electric''.
''We heard the rumours and renewed leaks, but it was only a fortnight
ago that these were firmed up and we realised what was at stake,'' said
the Scottish Nuclear insider.
''There's now incredible speculation and rumour. The threat to jobs is
real, but more worrying is the complete demise of a profitable and
highly efficient Scottish Nuclear industry into a non-competitive
conglomorate.''
Meantime, Scottish Nuclear is using evry avenue open to it to lobby
against the 8-0 merger option, pressing the argument that a two-year
run-in to a 4-4 split or a sell-off of the Scottish Nuclear entity makes
greater economic sense.
''Obviously we have to consider that a forthcoming Labour Government
would not wish to push ahead with privatisation, but even that option is
preferable to the corner we have been forced into by this Government,''
added the source.
Political opposition parties have wasted no time in seizing on the
likely merger and privatisation.
Labour's industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, said: ''It is absolutely
clear that privatisation is unwanted and unnecessary. The sole
motivation for selling off nuclear power stations is to fund Tory tax
cuts.''
Last night, the SNP's energy spokeswoman Ms Nicola Sturgeon said that
if nuclear power remained a Scottish option ''it must be a Scottish
company which controls it.''
However one of the most prominant figures to the defend Scottish
Nuclear's independence is Sir Donald Miller, the former chairman of
Scottish Power.
On Tuesday, Sir Donald told The Herald that a merger would be a
''breach of faith'' by the Government and another assault on Scottish
institutions by ''a Whitehall bureaucracy and London-based advisers
insensitive to opinion North of the Border.''
Sir Donald revealed that when chairman of Scottish Power he had made
an agreeement with the then Scottish Secretary Mr Malcolm Rifkind that
Scottish Nuclear stations would remain a separate Scottish entity.
He said the merger would create the ''type of monolithic structure
which the Government has gone to such lengths to avoid in recent
privatisations''.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang's statements in the House of Commons on
Wednesday gave little comfort to those looking for a resolution of the
issue.
Mr Lang ruled out continuance of the nuclear industry within public
ownership, which he said would create ''a twilight zone''.
He promised that Scottish Nuclear would remain a ''distinct Scottish
entity'' and but refused to elaborate on whether that would be within a
broader company in which Nuclear Electric was the big brother.
Meanwhile nerves continue to jangle within Scottish Nuclear.
The Scottish Nuclear Workers Campaign, which represents the interests
of workers at Hunterston, Torness and East Kilbride last night called on
the Government to back down.
A statement declared: ''There is a real groundswell of opposition to
selling off a prime publicly-owned Scottish company to pay for
pre-election tax cuts.
''Mr Lang must accept the strength of that opposition. He must surely
recognise that even his own Scottish Tory MPs are resisting the Nuclear
Electric takeover.''
The workers concern mirrors the management's anguish revealed last
night in a letter to staff by Mr Hann.
''We had all hoped that by now the Government's Nuclear Review would
be complete and that the uncertainty which it caused, particularly over
recent weeks, would be over,'' he said.
''On an issue of this importance, we really do want our staff to
receive reliable information from us. The trouble is that we ourselves
do not know exactly what is going on in Whitehall or in the Scottish
Office.
''However, it is clear that no firm announcement is likely to be made
until May 9 when a White Paper is expected to be published. It would
therefore seem that the question of privatisation, the vexed issue of
whether we merge with Nuclear Electric or not, and the structural
details will not be known until then.''
He adds: ''Dr Jeffrey and the Board are all anxious to see an
alternative to the merger which is being suggested.''

From Terrell, the name-dropper, to our own singular Sydney -- David
Belcher reports on the latest from the world of country life and strife
TERRELL is the singular monicker to note, his two mundane Christian
names having been consigned to history. And with his new album, Angry
Southern Gentleman (on the Pointblank label), Terrell is inspiring
critics to deploy other much-revered surnames all the better to bring
his work to the attention of ''devotees of the laid-back but
sharp-toothed wit of Lovett, Lyle, and Newman, Randy.''
Terrell has also been described as hailing from ''just beyond the
junction of Parker and Hiatt, with the misanthropes and bar-flies''. Yet
another convert located him as ''a man with one foot in the swamp and
the other in that dusty place where Americans keep their sense of
irony''.
Elsewhere, Terrell has been hailed as a new hero and a genuine
original. I'll merely add another name -- Waits -- and advise you not to
wait too long before you sample Terrell's gravelly, unravelling
country-blues folk-stomp.
Who is Terrell? Where's he from? Where's he at? Where's he going?
Originally, he is from Albertville, Alabama, a humdrum town in which
Terrell modestly does not expect to be widely remembered and whose claim
to fame was as ''the used-car capital of the world in the seventies. At
that time you didn't need to show the titles to a car if you were
selling it in Albertville, so a lot of them were stolen.''
Standing in line to register as a student of architecture at Auburn
University, the teenaged Terrell suddenly decided he had to steal away.
''Both my parents had gone to Auburn and there was an expectation I
would, too, but I snapped and split. I decided that music was what I had
to do. It had to be more than a hobby.''
His love of music had been born in church. ''I was raised plain
Episcopalian, southern Baptist. We didn't have congregations going into
religious trances and people falling to the floor, screaming. No
snake-handling. No strychnine-sipping. I always pined for that.''
His first record purchase was Age of Aquarius by the Fifth Dimension.
''That sparked an interest in buying albums, things like Elton John's
Tumbleweed Connection and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and from that I
began to get interested in lyrics, which led to Joni Mitchell, John
Prine and of course Dylan.
''Plus James Brown and Sly Stone, who may not be the most literary
songwriters, but they write with a rhythm, and I truly learnt how to
sing words from what they wrote.''
Seeking to embrace the musical life full-time, Terrell found himself
earning a living by disparate and occasionally desperate means. ''I was
a movie usher, which I thought was the most uncool job till I found out
that John Lee Hooker had once done it. I was a picture-framer, a
courier.
''My most insane job was at Vanderbilt University. I needed extra
money to get out of the south to LA, and so I volunteered for medical
experiments. It was hilarious and scarey and exciting. Every day they'd
take some blood out and put some chemicals in. I would read Anne Rice
novels to get in the mood.''
At various times Terrell has been further provided with literary
inspiration by Flannery O'Connor, William Faulkner, James Thurber,
Charles Bukowski and John Fante (''He's like Hemingway, check out his
novel Ask The Dust'') as Terrell's own free-wheeling song lyrics bear
ample testimony.
Strange dreams loom large in Terrell-land. Dreams in which the devil
pops up in a polyester suit, pledging to dispense shiny Cadillacs and
looking kinda cute. There's also a phantasmagoric allegory called
Toystore in which an ill-met host of famous names get together to play
around pointlessly and waste time. As they do, they demonstrate that
good songwriters shouldn't. Which is what Terrell, who is a good
songwriter, intended.
He has lived a few wasted years, you see. ''I've just had three years
of hard times, living in 20 places all over LA. Surviving off the
goodness of women. I hope the LP sells a few so I can buy somewhere of
my own and get my books out of boxes.
''In 1990, I had a record out, On The Wings Of Dirty Angels, that went
nowhere. I was managed by Miles Copeland, and everything that could go
wrong, did. There's a certain hopelessness in being on your own in a
small room at 3am, thinking you've lost everything good in your life.
Thinking you're the only one who knows you have something. Being filled
with doubt.
''For a year my focus was on getting another record deal and I lost
sight of the music. Then I went out solo in small clubs and was
re-reminded of the joy of where it starts . . . with songs. So I figure
now that I've beaten the odds twice and I'm not taking anything for
granted.''
A cheap video, shot by a friend in the Mojave desert, was what alerted
Pointblank's Scottish boss, John Wooler, to Terrell's existence. It must
be said that he is possessed of a mighty visual appeal, part muscular
fairground roustabout, part sensitive boho-hobo troubadour. In fact,
what Harry Connick jun has done to promote the swing era among young
folks, Terrell might do for the blues . . .
Don't talk to him about image-manipulation, though. ''There are credit
lines on my album sleeve for styling and wardrobe, and I went through
the roof when I saw them. I've been trying to find someone to blame.
Everyone is going to think: 'This deal is a manufactured picture'.
Actually, the best photograph on the sleeve is the one my brother took
in my mom's living-room of me holding a 60-watt light bulb, and it cost
a roll of film.
''Of course, we did do a photo-shoot in LA, with limos and stuff, at
which I felt a complete idiot . . . whenever I'd be helping the wardrobe
girl pick clothes up, I'd get told: 'Don't do that, you're the star!'
''I've worked as a production assistant in the past in similar
circumstances, and I'd always be getting yelled at for bringing people
the wrong tea.''
Ironic, that. As well as real and humorous. Like Terrell.
CENTURIES old, I am the wizened seer of the groove continuum, and I
thought I had seen everything. But Sydney Devine -- that Sydney Devine,
the epitome of Lanarkshire uncool -- wearing a baseball cap and a
trendsome Dolce et Gabbana T-shirt, being adoringly felled by a frenzied
mob of non-ironic young people on a TV studio stage after having rocked
the house with a kickin' techno version of Sydney's self-pitying Tiny
Bubbles?
Yup. Strange but true. And although they were there, acting as
Sydney's band during the pilot-recording of a Beeb Scotland chat show
hosted by Nicky Campbell, the three-man Fini Tribe couldn't believe it,
either, as Davy Miller reveals. ''When they toppled him, I kept
thinking: 'Sydney's just had heart by-pass surgery! They're going to
love him to death!' It was as alarming as it was bizarre.''
Yet not as bizarre as the musical union between oor ain ambient,
now-a-go-go Finis and stolid country-pancake-vendor Sydney. ''Sydney
couldn't be further from what we do, or further from what he normally
does, but the reaction to the new uptempo, disco-ey Tiny Bubbles has
been incredible.''
Tiny Bubbles will be emerging soon as a single on the Finis'
critically-credible label, ffrr, while the pairing will be repeated
twice in performance during the group's UK tour, at London's Subterranea
on May 18 and a week later at Edinburgh's Music Box.
Should the Nicky Campbell TV show go ahead, the Finis will be acting
as its house band, with Marsha Hunt tentatively scheduled to sing on a
new version of Age of Aquarius from Hair, the hippie stage-musical in
which Ms Hunt first made her name nigh on 30 years ago. The
Edinburgh-based trio are also due to resume collaborations with Sparks,
working alongside the Mael brothers on an all-star double album of
Sparks' covers.
More immediately, the Fini Tribe have released their own rather
splendid album, Sheigra (ffrr), a thoroughly hypnotic and propellant
assembly of brilliant tunes, shimmery burblings, and melancholic
poundings. Throughout, the unique sound of Sydney Devine is, you may or
may not be reassured to discover, entirely absent.
ECHOBELLY are hereby unveiled as the eighth name on the list of bands
for this year's welcome second instalment of T In The Park, scheduled to
take place in Strathclyde Park on August 5 and 6. They join the
Beautiful South, the Boo Radleys, M People, the Prodigy, Goya Dress,
Radiohead and Menswear.
Tickets, due to go on sale nationwide in a fortnight's time, will cost
#42 for the complete weekend if purchased before the end of June. Leave
it later and they'll cost #45. One-day tickets cost #25.
For your money you'll get around 60 bands, plus an expanded array of
bizarre peripheral entertainments, including demonstrations of
skateboarding and waterski-ing. Most bizarre of all, however, is the
persistent rumour that two leading Jock-rock figures will be
consummating their long-standing romantic relationship by getting very
publicly married at T In The Park on-stage.
Who's getting wed? Chartbite stars Ewan MacLeod and Mari Steven? Me to
Justin Currie? Rod Stewart to another blonde bird? Watch this space.

On the eve of the Clause 4 debate, party leader Tony Blair says he's
reclaiming Labour's traditional values not ditching them
TOMORROW, at a special conference in London, Labour Party members
will, I believe, vote to change our constitution. New Labour will be a
reality. It will be a defining moment in the party's history: a day not
to mourn the loss of an old icon but to be proud of a new statement of
aims and values that brings clarity and honesty to our core beliefs.
By having the courage to change ourselves, we will be sending the
clearest possible message to the British people that we have the courage
to change Britain. Through new Labour we will build a new Britain.
New Labour means tackling mass unemployment; it means ending the
commercialisation and privatisation of the NHS. New Labour will
guarantee each person minimum rights at the workplace; tackle crime and
its causes; give people the chance of financial independence instead of
depending on benefits.
New Labour will mean we build a competitive economy that serves the
interests of all the people, not just an elite, as has happened under
the Tories. People are turning to new Labour across Britain. The public
want a new and fresh start in British politics. They are listening to
new Labour and liking it.
There were those who said new Labour would put off voters in our
traditional strongholds. Labour's triumph in the Scottish local
elections put paid to that myth. Labour won a stunning victory. The Tory
vote collapsed and the Nationalists slumped. Far from putting off
traditional Labour support, we are consolidating it and increasing it.
We made gains from the Nationalists in traditional Labour areas such
as Falkirk and Dundee, while also winning seats from the Tories in areas
we had never represented before, such as Eastwood, Troon and Dunblane.
We are back as the mainstream party in Britain today, and that is where
we belong.
The lesson I have learnt from the past 15 years is that hatred of the
Tories is not enough for Labour to win. If that were the case, we would
be in government now. Something more has to happen. People have to know
Labour and trust Labour; we have to have confidence in our fiercely held
beliefs, and discipline in how we apply them.
It was to cement that trust, by reclaiming the values that brought us
into the party and the values that drive the vast majority of British
people, that I embarked on the change to our constitution. It is through
honesty about what we stand for that we will be able to win the trust of
the people.
Our ambitions as a party should be bold. I want nothing less than for
Labour to become the natural party of government. That means that we
must reconnect with the mainstream majority. It means we want not just a
change of personnel or a change of programme, but a change in the
governing philosophy.
I want to lead a government that will turn its back on the years of
selfish individualism; a government whose instincts are clear; that
supports working people instead of utility bosses, the consumer rather
than the bank manager; that raises standards in all our schools rather
than settling for high standards in a few.
What has struck me with great force as I have travelled around Britain
debating the issues with party members, is that when the arguments have
been put, the support for change has been overwhelming. That has been
reflected in the results of the ballots of party members that have been
coming in.
Ballot results have already come in from 377 constituencies, and 374
have voted for change. In Scotland, the results have been overwhelming.
Of 35 constituency results, so far 34 have voted for change; 86% of
party members in Scotland who have so far voted have backed the new
Clause 4.
Wherever ordinary party members have been given the chance to express
their view there has been a decisive vote to update our aims and values.
The Scottish results are extremely important. They nail the lie that the
leadership is out of touch with members. Where ballots have been held in
constituencies and unions, the support for change has been huge.
Those members have contributed to the widest and most democratic
process the party has ever seen; and those values that they wanted in
the constitution are now in it -- values that I believe strike a chord
with the public. Collective action for the common good: power, wealth
and opportunity in the hands of the many and not the few; rights matched
by responsibilities, and a just society based on solidarity and mutual
respect.
The constitution also states what we really believe about the economy.
Of course we believe there is a role for public ownership. That is why
we succesfully fought off Post Office privatisation, and that is why we
are fighting to stop rail privatisation. But we also believe in a
thriving private sector.
As we have reasserted those values -- the values that motivate working
people -- some foolishly accuse us of becoming Tory. That shows a
sneering disregard for the aspirations and anxieties of those who most
need a Labour Government.
There is something arrogant and patronising in accusing Labour of
stealing Tory clothes or pitching for the middle ground because we talk
about higher standards in schools, rights being matched by
responsibilities, family stability and tackling crime.
When David Blunkett embarked on his crusade to raise standards in our
classrooms, he spoke for parents across Britain; and he spoke for those
whose children get a sub-standard education, many of them in Labour's
traditional areas. It is plainly absurd to suggest that only Tories or
the rich want better education.
When I made a speech stating the importance of rights and
opportunities being matched by responsibilities, this was also dismissed
by some as stealing Tory clothes. They can never have been to a big
housing estate. When I spoke at a Clause 4 consultation meeting in
Glasgow recently, a woman spoke of the nightmare of raising children and
grandchildren on an estate beset by mass unemployment, crime and drugs.
It was to her, and for her, that I was speaking. It is people like her
who have the greatest desire for the common acceptance of decent values.
These are Labour values, traditional values. We have placed them in a
modern setting.
Take the issue of families. If you ask working families across the
country, Labour supporters and non-supporters, about what is important
to them, almost all of them would put their family first. Yet some say
it is Tory for Labour to talk about the family. This is nonsense.
People made the same charges of ''Tory clothes stealing'' when I was
Shadow Home Secretary. They said there was something Tory about wanting
criminals punished properly. They said it was Tory to be tough on crime.
But then they saw that every time I went to a party meeting or a union
meeting, or a meeting in my constituency, and talked about being tough
on crime and tough on the causes of crime, the response was
overwhelming. Crime is an issue that affects all of us -- the less well
off every bit as much as the affluent.
If high standards in schools, tackling crime, promoting personal
responsibility and providing quality services are seen as Tory values,
then that could explain why we have lost the past four elections. We
were out of touch. The truth is that they are traditional Labour values
that for too long we allowed the Tories to claim. We are reclaiming
them.
Labour is back as the party of law and order; back to give support to
the family; back as the party of high standards in our classrooms; back
speaking for the mainstream majority in British politics. It is a big
change, and explains why the Tories are scared. But we should not let
those on the far left, or those still in thrall to Thatcherism, get away
with painting Labour as a watered-down version of the Tories. We should
have the confidence to define ourselves.
The Prime Minister showed on Wednesday, with his speech on the inner
cities, that if anything the Tories are coming on to Labour territory.
There are too many people who are still too defensive after four
election defeats. They think there is something grubby about being
popular -- that it must mean we are betraying our principles.
There may be a simpler explanation. It is that when our strong Labour
values, now in the new Clause 4, are clearly articulated, people
actually want to vote for them. It is by reconnecting with our values,
not abandoning them, that Labour will regain power and have the strength
and direction to govern. We won't win power despite our principles, but
because of them.
The dividing lines between the parties could not be clearer. The
Tories still preach the failed dogma of crude market economics. Labour
believes that a modern economy must be based on a partnership between
public and private sectors.
The Tories believe in the slow privatisation of the National Health
Service. Labour believes that the health service should be a national
service, based on a public service ethos, that puts patients first
instead of business contracts.
The Tories have doubled welfare dependency since 1979. Labour believes
in getting people off welfare and into work. And how does the claim that
we ape the Tories square with our policy of restoring power to the
people of Scotland through a Scottish Parliament, and the Tories'
arrogant disregard for the views of the Scottish people and dogmatic
support of the status quo?
In the past few months Labour has put forward costed proposals to end
long-term unemployment by giving employers #75 tax relief if they take
on someone who has been unemployed for more than two years.
We have put forward a comprehensive set of proposals for small
businesses, for tackling crime, and for education. We have succeeded in
providing the one tax cut people have enjoyed in the past two years --
by stopping the second stage of VAT on fuel; and we have campaigned for
the important principle of a minimum wage in Britain.
These policies are not isolated from our values, they flow from them,
and are guided by them. Those values should be in our constitution.
Labour is a party of change. It sees the world as it is, and says that
is not the world as it should be. It is a party -- unlike the Tories --
that is never complacent. Labour will never settle for second best. On
Saturday, I believe we will show that we are a party that believes in
change and has the courage to change. We will be back, truly, as the
people's party.

Margaret Vaughan reports how the Churchill papers affair has exposed
misconceptions over a flutter for good causes
IN CAMELOT, the myths and magic are for punters. Like the Scots who
head the queue to buy impossible dreams for #1 against odds of one in 14
million of winning the top prize.
The jackpot goes to executives of the consortium who understood that
the way to win was to run the show. The strategy has succeeded beyond
their wildest imaginings. They expect to net profits of between #18m and
#20m this year. They won the contract to run the show with a projection
that they would not make money until the fourth year.
Winners do not necessarily have to buy a ticket. Like the Conservative
MP whose grandfather was a famous Prime Minister and war leader. Winston
Churchill Jun has emerged as principal beneficiary of the #12m lottery
money paid for his eminent ancestor's historic papers.
This amazing redistribution of wealth from ordinary people to the
aristocratic Churchill family is not what most folk expected to happen
to money from the lottery.Even if they did not win a fortune, they
thought that cancer research, Oxfam, the elderly, struggling charities,
would benefit from their flutter. So what is going on?
To begin to find an answer requires another question. What is a good
cause?The lottery was sold hard as a Lady Bountiful. Early advertising
from the organisers played so hard on the philanthropic card that the
company was warned to tone it down by Oflot, the lottery's regulatory
body. Even so, the idea seemed to lodge in the public mind that somehow
the lottery is ''for charity''. The reality is rather different.
For every #1 ticket, 27 pence is for ''good causes'' which is split
five ways. Charities get just 5.6p in the pound. The rest of the 21.4p
is divvied up between such worthy bodies as the Millennium Fund, Sports
Councils, the Arts Councils and the National Heritage Memorial Fund,
which exists to fund projects important to preserving the country's
history.
The purchase of the Churchill papers was among the heritage fund's
first grants doled out yesterday, along with #10m to buy and maintain
Mar Lodge on behalf of the National Trust for Scotland.
The director of the Heritage Lottery Fund -- one of five
government-appointed bodies disbursing lottery money -- is Georgina
Naylor. Last week she said the heritage fund had received only a
fraction of the applications forecast, and still had #43m to give away.
Only 263 applications had arrived for the fund's #67.9m budget.
''Lottery money is not just a question of winning on a Saturday night.
It's a question of making Britain a nicer place to live so that everyone
can point to something paid for out of lottery money,'' she said.What
may have confused many of the country's 30 million lottery players is
the idea that a good cause would include paying out #13m to keep a
politician in the sort of lifestyle punters dream of enjoying if they
win.
Peregrine Churchill, a nephew of the wartime leader and one of the
trustees of the settlement, had no regrets about selling the papers to
the nation rather than donating them: ''The trust had no money: like all
Churchills, we were poor. It was necessary to raise money to fulfil Sir
Winston's wishes.''
The family had long tried to sell off the only valuable asset left
when Sir Winston died in 1965. It made private approaches to both
Sotheby's and Christie's to try to sell the archives of pre-1945 letters
and speeches to the nation on the open market. The papers include
Churchill's letters to his mother as a schoolboy and correspondence with
sovereigns, as well as first drafts of famous war broadcasts.
The irony that the papers include the full texts of his VE Day radio
broadcast may not be lost on those involved in the VE Day celebrations
next month.The behaviour of his grandson contrasts with that of Sir
Winston's widow, who donated his post-1945 papers to Churchill College,
Cambridge.
Lord Rothschild, chairman of the trustees at the Heritage Lottery
Fund, has commended Mr Churchill's generosity, and said the family would
have got substantially more money if the collection had been broken up
and sold: ''I don't think the State has any right to assume these things
should be just given for free.''
While the heritage fund has now made its first donations, so far the
lottery has not given any money to charities. The National Lottery
Charities Board is locked in a consultation exercise to sort out who to
give money to. The priorities in the draft list included poverty,
children, those with mental and physical disabilities, the homeless and
unemployed, ethnic minorities, refugees and alcoholics and drug addicts.
It is being revised after protests from environmental groups, animal
charities and even the lifeboat appeals.
The first payouts will not be made until the autumn, when the lottery
will be almost a year old.That there are vast misconceptions about what
happens to lottery funds was made clear in a survey for the National
Council for Voluntary Organisations earlier this month. Two-thirds of
people polled believed buying lottery tickets was a good way to help
charity. They thought the full 27p in every pound went to charity.
If the NOP survey proves correct, then by the end of the year
charities and voluntary organisations will have lost #212m in income
because of competition from the lottery. In contrast, the amount of cash
generated for charity by the National Lottery is expected to be around
#150m.
The lottery clobbers charities from both directions. On the one hand
it scoffs #1 coins which might have ended up in collection tins. On the
other, it allows people to make a donation to charity in the hope of
something in return: like a #20m jackpot prize.
The director of communications at Camelot, David Rigg, responds by
pointing out that charities will be net beneficiaries over the seven
years of the lottery licence, receiving an estimated #1.8b. He does not
dispute that charitable giving may be affected by the lottery. The
evidence is mixed. It is, he says, too early to know for sure.
The introduction of the #1 Instant scratch cards, which took #10m in
the first four days on sale, has pushed up numbers playing the game from
around 25m to 30m. Figures to be released soon will show that Scotland
is playing a bit more than the rest of the UK.
A recent study by the Henley Centre showed that more than half the
adult population of the UK plays the lottery each week, spending just
over #2 on average.Camelot -- which brings together Cadbury Schweppes,
De La Rue, GTECH, ICL and Racal -- is believed to have had start-up
costs of about #30m. Sales are #62m a week higher than expected at this
stage.
The company's financial year ended earlier this month, and it is
understood that its revenue will top #1.2b -- or nine per cent of total
lottery sales. This is to reflect start-up costs and is supposed to drop
to an average of five per cent, plus five per cent for retailers'
commission.
The Government takes 12% in tax. In comparison with other countries
the tax is high. In Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal, only
the winnings are taxed. In Spain, Ireland and Belgium there is no tax at
all. For the past three years, the Danish government has foregone the
tax to free up money for two humanitarian charities and other good
causes.
David Rigg does not deny the consortium is making more than it
expected. ''Camelot will make profits. That's the whole basis of the
process, and sales are ahead of expectations at this early stage. We are
doing better than we hoped.''
But he says the contract stipulates that as sales go up, the
percentage return goes down. For every #1 in lottery sales above #3.5bn,
Camelot will get two pence in the pound to cover costs and generate a
profit. ''Margins are extremely tight,'' argues Rigg.
The total lottery take is split five ways: tax is fixed at 12%. The
retailers' share is 5%. Good causes get 25.85%. The punters get 45%.
Camelot gets the rest.
The regulator of the lottery, Peter Davis, chose Camelot over Richard
Branson's UK Lottery Foundation, which would have given all profit to
charity and good causes. He said this was because the wording of the
National Lottery Act forbade him from taking Branson's non-profit pledge
into account.
As the country has gaily hooked itself on the game, few voices have
been inclined to be heard above the clamour of the national obsession
with jackpot winners. One is Tony Banks MP, who asked Heritage Minister
Iain Sproat why the lottery had not been made a charitable foundation.
This would have allowed the Treasury's 12% take to be added to the fund
for good causes. He got no good answer.
Another is classical music composer Denis Vaughan, who heads a
pressure group monitoring Camelot's progress. He had long lobbied for a
UK lottery similar to the one which paid for the Sydney Opera House in
his native Australia.
He insisted yesterday that the lottery proceeds were being squandered,
and should have been used to invest in the fabric of the country. ''The
money spent on the Churchill papers should have been used for the
regeneration of youth; it could have been spent on investing in leisure
pursuits for them.
''Instead it's being thrown away on papers that were never going to be
sold outside the country anyway. It's a disgrace and a betrayal of the
original ideals.''

Julia Langdon breathes more easily after the shattering experience of
a panic attack
IT SHOULD have been any journalist's dream: I had a scoop, a real
humdinger which was going to lead my newspaper the next day and would
top all the news bulletins for days. The only trouble was that,
physically, I found myself unable to write it.
I couldn't concentrate, I couldn't breathe properly, my vision seemed
blurred, and I felt shaky and tingly. I went home and slept for a couple
of hours, wrote the story, and wondered what on earth had come over me.
I didn't know it then, or for several weeks afterwards, but I had been
suffering the classic symptoms of a panic attack.
In fact, I didn't even know what panic attacks were. A few days later,
however, I was stuck in a traffic jam on a hot day and something similar
happened: I felt claustrophobic, out of control, and abandoned my
journey and went home instead, as soon as the traffic would allow. The
experience was odd, but I put it down to something I had eaten and tried
to forget it.
What took me to the doctor was backache. My shoulders were agony and I
was recommended for physiotherapy. ''Your back is as stiff as a board,''
said the physio. ''It's tension. What sort of life do you lead?''
I told her a bit about it and then, casually, mentioned the ''odd''
experiences of feeling shaky. She had noticed me yawning, although we
met in the middle of the morning, and she explained that this could be a
symptom of someone who was breathing incorrectly and whose body was
trying to compensate. She suggested I return to the doctor and tell her
about the breathing problems.
My behaviour in the surgery that morning surprised even me. I started
to tell the doctor what had happened to me and before I knew it I was
bouncing off the walls. She suggested that having a small child and a
high-profile demanding job and going out a lot and travelling abroad
frequently and running the house and organising the child care, was a
difficult combination. I went to bits and she told me to take at least a
week off. It was eight weeks before I went back to work.
By then I knew all about panic attacks, the sensation of tingling
hands and feet brought on by hyperventilating, breathing in short,
shallow puffs which expel the carbon dioxide from the lungs but leave
behind a too-rich mix of oxygen. It was still frightening when it
happened, but at least I knew what was happening and what to do --
breathing into a paper bag, for example, will quickly correct the air
mix in the lungs. In the longer term, swimming, singing, and just lying
on the floor and breathing deeply are also good exercises. I learned to
sit upright so that my back was straight and I wasn't hunched into a
ball of tension.
My NHS doctor was terrific. She has a therapist who comes to the
surgery and who taught me how to breathe properly from the bottom of my
lungs. She has a practice nurse who is a trained masseuse who massaged
my back and taught me to relax. She herself (unlike my editor, who
appeared to think that I was malingering) was sympathetic and
understanding.
The most important thing I did was to sack the nanny. The girl who had
been looking after my then two-year-old daughter was, obviously, trusted
by me but she had kept letting me down in unpredictable ways.
On one occasion, for example, I had returned home earlier than
expected from work, at about 7pm when I was not due until at least
10.30pm, to find the house empty. There were no notes, no messages,
nothing. She had been due to take the child out to a small local funfair
that afternoon, so I sat and imagined them in casualty and wondered what
I would tell the police when I rang. What could I tell them? She walked
through the door at 9pm with my exhausted, tiny daughter and a boyfriend
I had never seen before or heard about. And, yes, now I realise I should
have sacked her on the spot. I was so relieved I just cried.
There was another incident a short time later, only this time I was,
for heaven's sake, in Kiev. The doctor's view was that it was probably
the anxiety that I was caused which triggered my illness.
Illness? It is difficult initially to accept that one has a mental
illness but, in fact, I had been here before, nearly 20 years earlier. I
had learned then that it was possible to suffer physically from a
mentally-induced condition. I had learned about stress and how to
control it and I had been foolish enough to forget.
The symptoms then were a recurring pain in the chest which could not
be attributed to any physical cause. Then, too, eventually, I broke down
in the doctor's surgery. I couldn't be ill, I cried. I had taken a
week's holiday from work because I had so much to do. I was a local
councillor and I had speeches to write for that week's council meeting;
I had two magazine articles to complete; I was researching a book which
I had to deliver in a few months; I was painting the flat from which I
was moving and the house which I had bought, and I was giving a party
for 100 people on Saturday.
That doctor, also wise -- and also, incidentally, a woman -- said
thank goodness I had explained what the matter was and if I cared to
come and lie down on this couch I would be taught how to breathe
properly.
My present doctor warned me that even having traced the cause of the
problem it could take months, or years, to feel free of anxiety. That
was five years ago and she was right. I don't have panic attacks any
more because I have learned the confidence to control them and thus to
prevent them but, absurd though it sounds, I am not free of the fear of
panic attacks.
I have a tendency to claustrophobia. I have always hated locking the
door of the loo in an aircraft -- particularly if I am travelling alone
and no-one will notice if I don't return to my seat. I feel a bit
oppressed in windowless rooms, or places from which I feel I cannot
escape without making a fuss. I don't much care for lifts or even,
sometimes, small, stuffy hermetically-sealed broadcasting studios, or
traffic jams.
What has helped, however, is discovering how widespread these kind of
anxieties can be, how many people have had similar experiences, how many
apparently capable people are also unexpectedly affected. I first read
some time ago that Imogen Stubbs, the Shakespearian actress, has
suffered in the same way and thought how brave it was of her to talk
about it. She will be doing so again tonight in a television programme,
which is part of the series on mental illness, States of Mind. Anyone
who is worried about panic attacks would be wise to watch it.

JUDGE Hugh Morton was a big man in every sense of the word. His
imposing physical stature was matched by his courage and constant
concern for the ordinary people that the law is meant to serve.
Honest and straightforward were the words that cropped up most
frequently in the tributes paid by friends and colleagues after his
untimely death from cancer on Wednesday at the age of 65.
His habit of speaking his mind, usually in fairly blunt terms, did not
endear him to every advocate who appeared before him and sometimes when
he shot from the hip he got it wrong.
However, unlike some who dish out criticism, ''Big Shug'' could also
take it without complaint.
Last year, he was subjected to a stinging attack by the Dean of the
Faculty of Advocates for ''unfairly pillorying'' members of the legal
profession and acting in a manner ''not in keeping with the high
standards we have come to expect of our judiciary''.
This came after comments by Lord Morton that what he described as a
simple damages case had lasted seven days. He thought it could have been
done in half the time.
Yesterday, such differences were forgotten as the Dean, Andrew Hardie
QC, acknowledged the qualities that set Hugh Morton apart.
''He was distinguished by many things, among them a strength of view
which he was never afraid to express.''
It is unlikely that the criticism caused Hugh Morton to lose any
sleep. He called the shots as he saw them and was not a man who spent
his life worrying about what others might say or think.
Glasgow solicitor Joe Beltrami, who graduated from Glasgow University
with him in 1953 described him as ''a very strong person and a
formidable opponent. He was a hard man but that was coupled with honesty
and integrity.''
Long before he ascended to the heights of the Scottish court bench in
October, 1988, Hugh Morton had won the respect of fellow lawyers for his
straight dealing.
He was at the eye of the storm in June 1980 when he successfully
defended a man accused of strangling and stabbing a 13-year-old Glasgow
schoolgirl.
The case was thrown out because the accused man, who had severe mental
problems, had not been told by police of his right to remain silent
after being cautioned.
When the then Solicitor General, Nicholas Fairbairn, implied that the
accused had been guilty, Mr Morton wrote an angry letter to The Herald
strenuously defending his former client.
As a judge, he showed the same determination not to shirk hard
decisions. In two highly-publicised murder trials, he refused to allow
the case to go to the jury because he thought there was insufficient
evidence to convict -- the easy way out would have been to pass the buck
to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
Some of the courtroom clashes stemmed from his impatience with the
tradition that in civil cases, the job of a judge was not to discover
the truth but to act as an impartial referee, leaving the conduct and
length of the case to the competing sides.
He said: ''The trouble with that approach is that the public quite
rightly regard that as nonsense. The public consider that the judge's
role is to do justice between the parties and that justice is vitally
connected with the truth.''
In the same House of Lords speech last November, when his illness had
already begun to take its toll, he condemned procedures in the Court of
Session as outdated, slow, and costly.
He often expressed irritation at the way witnesses and jurors were
''mucked about'' to suit the convenience of lawyers and he once
apologised to potential jurors kept waiting because cases were postponed
at the last minute.
He informed them that the situation appeared to be due entirely to the
''rank incompetence'' of the legal profession.
Hugh Morton will be greatly missed by the court staff who accompanied
him on circuit and with whom he would sometimes share a dram at the end
of a hard day in the High Court.
Journalists certainly will miss his mordant sense of humour.
Once, presiding over a case of a man who claimed he had been beaten up
by the police, he was regaled with details of the detention procedure in
which the suspect had allegedly been pounced on, wrestled to the
pavement, his arm forced up behind his back, and bundled unceremoniously
into a police van.
''Presumably, they were wanting a voluntary statement,'' remarked Lord
Morton.
Somehow, Parliament House won't be quite the same without him.

THE skipper of the Scottish trawler which had a run-in with two
Spanish trawlers misunderstood danger warnings from the Spaniards.
Skipper William Jack, from the Black Isle, thought the Spaniards'
shouts of ''haul your gear'' and their flailing arms were insults. When
the Spaniards edged closer to make him change course to avoid their
lines, the Scots skipper thought they were trying to ram him and
panicked.
Mr Jack, of the 57ft Inverness-registered Cameo, reported the
''dangerous encounter'' off Lewis, in the Western Isles, on Wednesday
evening. Yesterday morning, Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency (SFPA)
officers from the cruiser FPV Norna caught up with and boarded the
Spanish trawler Goitia for an explanation. The Cameo crew were also
questioned.
An SFPA spokesman said: ''It would appear the Cameo was trawling a net
near long lines set by the Spaniards. Although the Cameo's skipper did
not see any buoys to indicate lines were set, the Spaniards were alarmed
their fishing gear would be damaged.''

ONE of Scotland's best known and most respected public relations
consultants, Mr George Hodge, has died suddenly at the age of 64.
He became ill on Wednesday night at Peebles Hydro, where the Scottish
Police Federation was staging its annual conference. He was taken to
Borders General hospital, where he died shortly after being admitted.
SPF delegates stood in silence as a mark of respect for Mr Hodge who
had acted for the federation for a number of years.
There were numerous tributes yesterday for the popular media figure
who was born in Edinburgh and studied at the city's Broughton School.
He is survived by his daughter Lesley, 37, an accountant, his son
Derek, 39, a partner in his business, and a 10-month-old grandson,
Robbie. His wife Isabelle died 20 years ago.
Mr Hodge began his media career as a journalist with the Daily Record
before being appointed Scottish correspondent of the old Daily Herald.
He switched to a public relations post in the early 1960s and about
six years later formed his own business, George Hodge Associates.
He built up an impressive list of clients including Fife region, Forth
Ports plc, Edinburgh Airport, Rolls Royce, Edinburgh's Queen Margaret
College, and the Forth River Purification Board.
He was a member of the National Union of Journalists all his working
life and was a past chairman and president of Edinburgh Press Club.
His funeral will take place at Warriston Crematorium at 4pm on Tuesday
and thereafter at Edinburgh Press Club.

A DRUNK man, who murdered a young rugby player by stabbing him through
the heart on Boxing Day, was jailed for life yesterday.
Kevin Maxwell, 31, was barracked by members of the victim's family
after the jury returned their verdict at the High Court in Edinburgh.
The murder victim, John Frater, 17, was the vice-captain of Jed
Thistle -- a feeder team for the senior Borders rugby side Jed-Forest --
and had been voted their Player of the Year.
The talented flanker was described as, ''a rather quiet lad, only
speaking when he felt it necessary, although never afraid to make his
opinions known'' by his rugby coach, Mr Barry Hughes.
''John played the game of rugby as it should be played'' said Mr
Hughes.
After the court hearing, the victim's father, Mr John Frater, 42, of
Priors Meadow, Jedburgh, said of his son: ''He was a quiet, hard-working
lad.''
Maxwell, a farm labourer, of Queens Drive, Hawick, had denied
murdering John Frater in Crown Lane, Jedburgh, on December 26 last year,
by stabbing him on the body with a knife.
After a four-day trial, the jury of 10 men and five women took just an
hour to return a unanimous verdict of guilty.
The court heard that the teenager had died hours after attending a
Christmas Day family gathering at his grandmother's home in Jedburgh.
He had been walking ahead of his younger brother Steven, 16, through
the streets of Jedburgh when his younger brother got involved in a
confrontation with Maxwell after the older man made an offensive remark
about his brother's girlfriend.
He had walked away from the scene after trying to prevent trouble but
Maxwell caught up with the group of youngsters and made the fatal attack
after an argument flared.
A doctor and paramedics tried to save the teenager's life after the
stabbing but the single knife wound to his heart was fatal.
The court heard that Maxwell had later told a couple he met that he
had stabbed a man.
Maxwell, originally from Glasgow, had been drinking whisky before
going on a pub crawl in Jedburgh in an attempt to track down a former
girlfriend.
The father-of-two had a ''hazy'' recollection of events, said his
defence counsel, Mr Neil Murray QC.
Maxwell had several previous convictions, many of which were drink
related, the court heard.
Lord Milligan told Maxwell: ''You are well aware there is only one
sentence that I can pass for the crime of murder. You will go to prison
for life.''

A SHERIFF yesterday rejected a social work recommendation that a
former policeman pay compensation to two young women he had indecently
assaulted in his taxi.
Stirling Sheriff Court heard that a social work background report had
recommended the compensation scheme in the case of Joe Boyle, 38, who
had been a constable with Central Police in the 1980s.
Sheriff Robert Younger sentenced Boyle, who now works as a cleaner, to
160 hours community service.
The sheriff told him: ''To put a price on this kind of activity is
almost impossible. I wouldn't know what sort of sum to suggest and you
wouldn't be able to pay it anyway.''
Boyle, a married man, was appearing for sentence after being found
guilty last month of the assaults.
Boyle had attacked a 23-year-old woman after he had driven her home in
his cab, grabbing her by the wrist and putting his hand inside her
blouse.
In the second attack he had grabbed a 24-year-old woman and put his
hands inside her clothing.
Boyle, of Morrison Drive, Bannockburn, had denied the offences.

AN Englishman who claimed racial discrimination against a Scottish
health board has been ordered to pay #250 expenses.
The award was made after Mr Gary Wilson failed to turn up at a Glasgow
industrial tribunal convened to hear his racial discrimination claim
against Greater Glasgow Health Board.
Mr Wilson, whose address was given as Queen Square, Strathbungo,
Glasgow, had claimed racial discrimination after he applied
unsuccessfully for a job with the board's health promotions department
last year.
He claimed his application was treated unfairly because he was
English.
He failed to appear for the hearing earlier this month and the health
board asked tribunal chairman Mrs Doris Littlejohn to order him to pay
its expenses.
The health board claimed #500 in expenses, alleging that Mr Wilson had
acted frivolously, vexatiously, and unreasonably.
Preparation of the case had cost considerable time by solicitors at
#75 an hour. In addition there was the cost of copying in preparing
productions.
The tribunal agreed that expenses should be awarded against Mr Wilson
but decided #500 was excessive. He was ordered to pay #250.
Mr Wilson had earlier tried to get the hearing postponed, claiming he
had an interview in England, but he failed to respond to a request to
contact the tribunal or give more information about his case.

Pretoria, Thursday
PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela today celebrated South Africa's first year of
democracy by cutting the jail sentences of tens of thousands of inmates
in overcrowded prisons.
''In the spirit of goodwill that accompanies this, our first Freedom
Day, I have decided to grant a special remission of sentences of
one-quarter for all prisoners, with a maximum remission of six months,''
he told 5000 people at a rally at the Union Buildings in Pretoria.
Mandela's inauguration as South Africa's first black president on the
same spot on May 10 last year followed elections the previous month in
which his African National Congress won 62% of the vote, hammering the
final nail in the coffin of apartheid.
''As dawn ushered in this day few of us could suppress the welling of
emotion as we were reminded of the terrible past from which we come as a
nation, the great possibilities that we now have, and the bright future
that beckons us,'' Mandela said.
He told the crowd: ''The ultimate goal of a better life has yet to be
realised.''
He added however: ''If any one day marked the crossing of the divide
from a past of conflict and division to the possibility of unity and
peace, from inequality to equality, from a history of oppression to a
future of freedom, it is April 27, 1994.''
Mandela said the amnesty would apply to everyone charged before
December 6 1993 with possession of arms ''associated with political
conflicts of the past, irrespective of their political affiliation''.
Previous amnesties have already freed most political prisoners.
Mandela told the crowd: ''We have learnt over the first freedom year
that there is no short-cut to making South Africa the country of our
dreams. It requires hard work by those entrusted with positions of
responsibility in government.''
As he spoke, about 20,000 supporters of the Inkatha Freedom Party led
by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi marched through Durban to protest at the
ANC's failure to accept international mediation of rumbling
constitutional disputes.
Right-wing white extremists said they had nothing to celebrate today.
''We regard it as a day of sorrow and regret,'' said the Afrikaner
People's Front. ''We will fight for the country that was taken from
us,'' said Andrew Ford, leader of the Boer Resistance Movement.--Reuter.

Moscow, Thursday
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin has signed a decree halting fighting
against rebels in Chechnya, his press office said today.
The decree, signed yesterday, orders a unilateral halt to military
actions from midnight tonight until May 12 -- meaning that it will cover
events in Moscow marking the end of the Second World War which are to be
attended by world leaders.
However Russian forces in Chechnya will respond ''according to the
situation'' if they come under attack, the decree warns.
Almost 50 world leaders, many of them critical of Russia's bloody bid
to crush Chechen independence moves, are due in Moscow for the VE Day
commemorations on May 9.
President Bill Clinton telephoned Yeltsin today to welcome the halt in
fighting and urge him to make the ceasefire permanent.--Reuter/AP.

Boston, Thursday
THE widow of black leader Malcolm X will meet publicly with Louis
Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam head she suspects of involvement in
plotting her husband's assassination 30 years ago.
Farrakhan's fiery statements about race relations in America have made
him a controversial figure among blacks and whites.
Malcom X's widow, Betty Shabazz, is to appear with Farrakhan at the
Apollo Theatre, New York, on May 6.
A Nation of Islam source told the Boston Globe that some proceeds from
the joint appearance will be used to pay for the legal defence of
Shabazz's daughter, Qubilah, who has been charged with plotting to kill
Farrakhan.
Farrakhan has said he believes the allegations against the younger
Shabazz are an attempt by the US Government to divide the black
community.
Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan have not met since she said in a
television interview last year that she believed he was somehow involved
in the 1965 killing of her husband, which Farrakhan denies.--AP.

From MURRAY RITCHIE European Editor Brussels
A MAJORITY of Britons, 58%, favours more integration, and hence
sharing more sovereignty, within the European Union, according to the
latest survey.
However, the findings put the British towards the bottom of the league
of 15 member states in their Euro eagerness.
Those most keen on further integration are the Italians, of whom 83%
were in favour. They were followed by the Belgians (82%) and Spanish
(79%), with the French showing 75% support for the idea.
Those least in favour were the more Eurosceptic Danes, of whom only
42% approved the idea. Finland, one of the three new EU members, also
showed minority support for more integration, with only 46% in favour.
Another newcomer, Sweden, scraped a majority of 53%.
The poll was carried out by the European Commission and discovered
that most Europeans are still unaware the whole integration process is
up again for review when the Maastricht Treaty on European economic and
political union is renegotiated next year at an inter-governmental
conference (IGC).
Only 17% of Europeans realised this.
Those most aware were the Danes (42%) and those least aware were the
Germans and Dutch (both 14%). In the UK, 76% were unaware of the IGC,
suggesting that much of the political debate about Europe's future only
rarely strikes a chord with ordinary citizens, despite the EU's attempts
to bring itself closer to the people.
Less than half of all Europeans (46%) were satisfied with the way
democracy worked in the EU but 57% took the view that membership was ''a
good thing'' for their own country.
In the UK, 41% thought British membership of the EU was a good thing
(an increase of 4%) and a further 27% said it was neither good nor bad.
Only 23% thought it a bad thing.
Enthusiasm has declined in Sweden, Finland, and Austria only three
months after they joined the bloc, according to the findings.
Only 33% of Swedes, the lowest figure of the member states, thought
membership a good thing and 36% thought it a bad thing: the highest
negative figure in the survey. In Austria, 37% approved of membership
while 28% did not.

THE #13m grant from the National Lottery to buy the Churchill papers
was condemned last night by the convener of the Kirk's stewardship and
finance board.
The Rev Iain Paton said: ''It is a good example at the outset of the
very dangerous and difficult road we are going down. It is going to be
very divisive, in view of the huge number of good social projects
waiting to be done.''
Mr Paton said the grant illustrated the reality behind the fast-buck
mentality of the lottery, where dreams were often dashed.
In its report to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the
board said the Kirk must rely on Christian giving and not the lottery.
Nevertheless, Mr Paton said the church should not seek to disadvantage
itself because of the lottery. It had long received State funding for
the fabric of historic churches and should not refuse future support
from Heritage Scotland simply because it had an element of lottery
money.
The board said its appeal to congregations over the financial
difficulties facing the Kirk had produced a good response: the 2.7%
budget shortfall for 1994 was the lowest on record. Income rose by #2.4m
to #68m.
Meanwhile, the Moderator of the General Assembly, the Right Rev Dr
James Simpson, yesterday called for a revival of wider moral values to
replace self-interest and materialism.
''The tragedy today is that many don't have anything really worthwhile
to live for,'' he told the Kirk women's annual mission meeting.

SIR RON DEARING said yesterday he was stepping down as chairman of
National Lottery operator Camelot because of a series of health
problems, including cancer.
The top Government education adviser and former Post Office chairman
said he had ''been through the mill'' and thought he needed to ''take it
easy for a while''.
He will continue working for the Department of Education but has
decided to leave the boards of several other firms with which he is
involved, including the Northern Development Company, Ericsson, and IMI.
Sir Ron, 65 this year, stressed that his decision to bid farewell to
Camelot had nothing do with the controversy over alleged scratchcard
fraud or the row over the use of lottery cash to buy the Churchill
papers.
He said he was delighted with the progress of the lottery since its
launch in November and did not think the publicity about alleged
cheating by ticket sellers would do any long-term harm.
''I have been through the mill in the past six months,'' he said.
''The problems I have had have included prostate cancer. But I am having
treatment and expect to make a full recovery. What I am hoping is that
if I take it easy for a while my general bodily health will recover.''
Sir Ron said it was to be expected that there would be teething
problems with a project as big as the lottery -- and added that the row
over the Churchill papers had nothing to do with Camelot.
''I think the lottery has gone extremely well -- better than I dared
hope,'' he said. ''When you have 20,000 retailers, it is not surprising
that some problems emerge, especially in the early days. But the
machinery we have is the best in the world and that is why we can spot
these things happening.''
Camelot chief executive Tim Holley said Sir Ron's contribution had
been ''inestimable''.
Sir Ron is being replaced by 59-year-old industrialist Sir George
Russell, chairman of the Independent Television Commission. Under ITC
rules, Sir George would not take part in any discussions at the
commission concerning television advertising by Camelot or any of its
competitors, said Camelot.
Sir Ron has been best known in recent years for his work in education.
Former Education Secretary John Patten headhunted him from the world of
industry two years ago to review the failing national curriculum and he
is now chairman of the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority.
Earlier this month, Education Secretary Gillian Shephard announced
that Sir Ron was to head a review of academic and vocational
qualifications for 16 to 19-year-olds.
Sir Ron said he would now be concentrating on his educational work and
foresaw no problems in completing the report.
* Meanwhile retailers suspected of ticket frauds have been warned they
could end up in court.
Camelot has taken action against five retailers over ''alleged
irregularities'' in sales of Instants tickets. A Camelot spokeswoman
said that any evidence of wrongdoing would be passed to the police.

DEFENCE Secretary Malcolm Rifkind yesterday won an interim interdict
to stop from Greenpeace protesting against nuclear submarines on the
Clyde.
It was believed to be the first time the Ministry of Defence had taken
legal action against an environmental group.
The interdict was served on Greenpeace yesterday morning. It had
stopped HMS Vanguard, a submarine which carries Trident missiles, from
going on patrol for six hours on Saturday.
Greenpeace used nylon ropes, nets, plastic containers, and other
obstacles which, the Defence Ministry claimed, were highly dangerous.
A statement said: ''This placed at risk the lives of Vanguard's crew,
other MoD personnel in attendance, and other protesters, as well as the
safety of the submarine itself.
''The MoD deplores unreservedly the actions taken by Greenpeace and it
is to prevent any recurrence that this interdict has been served.''
The Greenpeace protest was timed to coincide with talks at the United
Nations in New York on the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
It said Britain faces increasing criticism over Trident.
Greenpeace activist Janet Convery said: ''The UK Government is
embarrassed by the Greenpeace protests against Trident, particularly at
a time when the UK obligations to disarm are under international
scrutiny at the NPT talks.''
Greenpeace has 21 days to go back to court and make a formal response.
Vanguard, the first of the four giant submarines equipped with 16 D-5
missiles, began its initial patrol last December.

GLASGOW today will lodge an application for Millennium Commission
funds which could secure a #78m urban regeneration programme at a cost
to the city of just #10m.
If its bid is successful, not only will the Clyde riverside areas of
Glasgow Green, Fleshers' Haugh, and Richmond Park, be uniquely
revitalised, but the city will be on the starting blocks for a number of
world and international sporting events.
Glasgow City Council yesterday unveiled details of a Millennium
submission for #40-#45m, which confirms exclusive revelations in The
Herald last month. The commission is due to approve a dozen major
projects throughout the UK, and the fate of Glasgow's bid will not be
known before late August.
The city is competing against other major regeneration projects known
to include waterways, the Caledonian forest, and former Garden Festival
site, as well as one for a theme park in central Scotland.
Glasgow's parks and recreation department project is dependent on
additional funds which the city is seeking from various agencies,
including the European Community. This would allow the city to embark on
what Councillor Colin McNicol described as ''the most outstanding urban
parkland renewal intiative ever undertaken in Europe''.
At the heart of the development is a proposed Millennium Arena, a
12,000-capacity multi-function indoor national stadium with underground
parking for 1300 cars. An international competition, reflecting
Glasgow's status as 1999 City of Architecture and Design, will ensure a
unique high-technology structure capable of hosting a range of sports.
It will also be used as an entertainment and concert venue and have
the facility to provide managed workspace for arts and crafts, dance,
sound studios, and community space in response to local demand.
The director of leisure and recreation, Mr Bernard Connolly, confirmed
the specific arena cost as #30m: ''But the net cost of the whole
regeneration project to the city, if all our submissions work out, would
be #10m, repayable over five years.''
The location would be immediately adjacent to the Clyde, on the Fifty
Pitches, but football would continue to be catered for with a centre of
excellence for the sport on the remainder of that part of the site.
The vision of the future embraces other leisure facilities including a
watersport centre, upgraded walking and cycle routes, and model boating
centre. There will be a play village for families, wheels area for
go-karts, bikes, and skateboards, and an indoor soft-play area.
The parks will host horticultural displays of international quality
and there is the promise of all-year-round colour, a scented garden, and
thistle maze. There will be replanting of 80% of tree stock, tree-lined
boulevards, piazzas, and fountains.
''The project will trigger further economic and social benefits
throughout Glasgow and, in particular, the East End of the city, and
offer a major boost to the renewal of Gorbals and the Merchant City,''
said Councillor McNicol.
''With a projected visitor level of 1.5 million each year, direct and
indirect job creation of 500 jobs, the contribution to the local economy
is of considerable and permanent value.''

LABOUR moved yesterday to step up the pressure on the Government over
the future provision of hospital services in Grampian.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson sent letters to both
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang and his front-bench colleague, Mr George
Kynoch, MP for Kincardine and Deeside, demanding answers on the issue.
The row has been sparked by the announcement that Grampian Health
Board has been told to invite open competition for the future provision
of health services in Stonehaven.
The Government insists services will remain free at the point of
delivery for those who need them but Labour insists this is a clear move
towards full privatisation of the NHS.
In his letter to Mr Lang, Mr Robertson said he was extremely concerned
about the decision to sanction the privatising of two hospitals in
Stonehaven.
He said: ''It would be indefensible for the operation of the medical
services of these two hospitals to be handed over to the private sector.
Such a move could have potentially disastrous consequences for staff and
patient care and would be a firm step down the road to the privatisation
of the NHS.''

THREE more men have appeared at Paisley Sheriff Court after the latest
moves by the intensive police operation codenamed Dragon.
Two people arrested on Tuesday night -- Mr George Docherty, 35, and Mr
Robert Pickett, 30 -- were remanded on Wednesday on a number of charges
involving intimidation and the use of threatening behaviour.
The three who appeared in court in private yesterday are named on
several of the charges involving Mr Docherty and Mr Pickett.
They were Mr William Gillespie, 39, of Ferguslie Park Crescent, Mr
Stewart Gillespie, 35, of Glencoats Drive, and Mr Steven McNamara, 21,
of Dalskeith Road, all Ferguslie Park, Paisley.
Mr William Gillespie is alleged to have menaced Mr George Weir, 22, in
the premises of FCB Securities, 38 McKenzie Street, Paisley, on December
21 by threatening him with violence and placing him in a state of fear
and alarm.
He is also accused of committing a similar offence against Mr David
Bremner, 27, by telling him he had ''hits'' out on him and Mr George
Weir.
It was also alleged that he menaced Mr George Weir on December 27 in
Blackstoun Road, Ferguslie Park, by threatening to blow up his car if he
saw him near his building sites or anywhere in Ferguslie Park.
He has been accused of threatening Ms Helen McLaughlin and threatening
violence to Ms Jemima McLaughlin and her daughter, Andrea, by shouting,
swearing, and banging his fists against the window of their home.
Mr William Gillespie and Mr McNamara are alleged to have conspired
with others in the premises of FCB Securities Ltd to threaten, menace,
intimidate, and assault Mr David Bremner and Mr George Weir, placing
them in a state of fear and alarm.
They were also charged with placing both men in such a state of fear
that they fled from Paisley.
Mr McNamara, it is claimed, menaced Mr David Bremner while acting
along with others on January 7 by placing themselves outside his home
equipped with a firearm, and menaced Mr George Weir on January 15 while
acting along with others by placing themselves outside his home.
Mr Stuart Gillespie is charged with driving a vehicle recklessly
towards another vehicle, while acting along with Pickett on April 18 in
Ferguslie Park Avenue.
The other vehicle, it was claimed, was driven by James Duffin and
occupied by Andrea McLaughlin and Anton McLaughlin, aged 20 months, and
it was forced to swerve to avoid a collision, to the danger of the
occupants.
Mr Duffin and Andrea McLaughlin were also said to have been placed in
a state of fear and alarm on the same date, by the carriageway in
Dalskeith Road, Ferguslie Park, being obstructed.
Mr McNamara is also alleged to have been in breach of bail conditions.
Defence agents Denis Coffield and David Tod said none of the accused
had made any declaration during their appearance.
The three accused were remanded in custody for further investigation.

From KEVIN LIFFEY Bergen-Belsen, Thursday
GERMANY'S president marked the liberation 50 years ago of
Bergen-Belsen concentration camp by calling for a new generation of
Germans to take up the torch of remembrance of Nazi horror.
Roman Herzog told some 5000 guests, including 500 survivors, at a
ceremony on the site of the infamous camp that, with witnesses dying
out, Germans would soon run the risk of viewing Nazi atrocities merely
as history.
''Now we must do our utmost to speak of the past, convey it, and
remember it in such a way that young people feel it is their own
responsibility to make sure it can never be repeated,'' Herzog said.
''This is a decisive duty of our generation. Only those who remember
can prevent future danger,'' he told the guests on the day that Jews
around the world remember the Holocaust, in which the Nazis murdered six
million of their number.
Most died in ''extermination camps'' such as Auschwitz, in Poland.
Yet the images recorded by the British liberators of the 60,000
skeletal figures they discovered at Belsen, ravaged by brutality,
hunger, thirst, or typhoid, are among the most enduring images of the
horrors committed on German soil. This was why Germany's Jews chose the
site for their central war commemoration.
Peter Carter, a Polish Jew now living in Australia, weighed just 4st
at the liberation, when he was 19.
''It was a time of epidemics, beatings, they worked us to death, we
were infested with bugs and lice,'' he said. Asked why the guards had
beaten the prisoners, he replied: ''It was sadism, just simple sadism.''
Former Israeli president Chaim Herzog, who saw Belsen's horror with
the British soldiers, told the gathering: ''I do not bring forgiveness
with me, or forgetting. The only ones who can forgive are the dead --
the living have no right to forget.''
Ignatz Bubis, head of Germany's small Jewish community, struck a
similar note, saying: ''We must not keep silent, for the sake of the
dead but also for the sake of today's and future generations. How else
shall we learn from history?
''How shall our children learn that, for instance here in
Bergen-Belsen, conditions were so inhuman that after the liberation
another 13,000 people died who were so weakened by their internment that
they could hardly absorb nutrition?''
Some 30,000 Jews were among the 50,000 who died at the concentration
camp itself, following perhaps 50,000 Soviet soldiers who perished
earlier in equally inhuman conditions at the adjoining PoW camp.
All lie in mass graves, now covered by heather-covered mounds which,
apart from a stone memorial obelisk, are all that mark the moorland
landscape as the site of such horrors.
Many survivors, returning to the site of their torment for the first
time, stood sobbing quietly near the graves of their loved ones as
Hanover's Jewish cantor Marcel Lang intoned the Kaddish, the Jewish
prayer for the dead.
However even amid the memory of such horror, there was time for a kind
of reconciliation at the Belsen ceremony.
''We have forgiven you -- but not forgotten what you did to our
fathers and grandfathers,'' read a placard held by concentration camp
survivor Dan Karmel.
German President Herzog recalled Anne Frank, the girl whose diary is
one of the most moving accounts of the Holocaust, and who died with her
sister at Belsen.
Urging his audience not to look away from injustice, he cited Frank as
an example of moral fortitude.
''On April 11, 1945, Anne Frank wrote in her diary that she was
already figuring on the possibility of death. She found the courage to
add that it would have to be a sacrifice for freedom, truth, and
justice,'' he said.
''That is her legacy. Let us take it on.''--Reuter.

From JANET GUTTSMAN Moscow, Thursday
A HUGE explosion at a gas pipeline in northern Russia today sent a
pillar of fire high in to the night sky and made nearby residents think
war had broken out.
No deaths or injuries were reported, but local people said the fire
rose hundreds of yards into the air and the crew of a Japanese airliner
reported seeing flames miles high.
Tass said the blaze near Ukhta, an oil-refining centre 800 miles
north-east of Moscow, had been so intense that no-one could get within
half-a-mile of it.
''Everybody was so scared. People thought that a war had started,''
said Tatyana Nekrasova, 48.
Speaking in Vodny, some six miles from the explosion in Komi Republic,
she added: ''The flames were so bright that at first we thought the
whole village was on fire.''
She said dazed people poured into the street after the blast around
2am, many making the sign of the cross in fear.
The crew of a Japan Airlines jet broke the news of the blast after
passing overhead on a flight to Tokyo. They reported seeing flames
rising to a height of between 10,000 to 20,000ft.
Officials from the gas producer Gazprom said the fire could not have
risen more than 400ft into the air.
However pilot Akira Nakagawa told a news conference at Tokyo's Narita
airport that clouds ahead of his plane had been turned bright red by the
blaze and there was a black column of cloud of the kind associated with
an explosion.
One passenger on the flight from Frankfurt told the same news
conference: ''It was as if the sun was climbing upward.''
Russian officials portrayed the blast, almost exactly nine years since
the world's worst nuclear accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in
Ukraine, as a routine incident.
''There was a leak of gas, and a spark probably set off the fire,''
said an official at the Ministry of Emergency Situations said by
telephone. ''Everything is OK now.''
The leak which caused the accident, the latest in a series to hit
Russia's troubled energy sector, occurred in a section of pipeline 55in
in diameter.
''It was a big fire because it was a big pipeline -- you can almost
stand in it,'' said an official at gas producers Gazprom, which is 40%
state-owned.
In Washington, the Central Intelligence Agency confirmed that the
fireball had been spotted by satellite but said there was no security
alert.
The dollar rose on news of the explosion, as Tokyo dealers speculated
that it could have been caused by a nuclear blast.
Oil prices followed as Russia is a big producer and a exporter of both
oil and natural gas.
Gazprom officials in Moscow were quick to give assurances that exports
would not suffer.
Deputy chairman Valery Remizov said the pipeline was shut down soon
after the accident but the fire burned itself out after burning several
million cubic metres of gas.
He defended the safety of Gazprom's pipeline network despite
international concern. ''It was the second such accident in the whole
history of the national gas industry,'' he said.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
THE Scottish Liberal Democrats gather in Perth for their spring
conference today with an unaccustomed whiff in their nostrils -- the
heady scent of political power.
Not the full-strength perfume, perhaps, but at least a splash of
toilet water behind the ears.
They travel buoyed up by their best-ever council results -- 123 seats
(25% up on their district tally), share of power in three councils, the
balance of power on one and the largest opposition party on four more.
Not a bad showing for a party which some predicted was heading for an
electoral wipe-out of, dare one say it, Tory proportions.
Not only that, but fortune has smiled on the party in terms of the
timing and venue of the conference, given that the Perth and Kinross
by-election is likely to be held in June.
Using high-profile debates on rail privatisation, education and
standards in public life, the party will attempt to use this weekend to
kick-start its by-election campaign.
Delegates are also being asked to help mount a major leafleting effort
on behalf of the local party and candidate Veronica Linklater.
However, there is one more factor which is of longer-term, possibly
even historical significance, as the conference is asked to endorse the
negotiations which have taken place between Liberal Democrat women and
their Labour counterparts with a view to finding an effective but
non-statutory mechanism to ensure that a Scottish parliament will have
something approaching gender equality.
If such a deal is conceded to the more militant Labour women, the SLD
hopes this will gain it vital leverage in ensuring that the Scottish
parliament achieves a level of proportional representation, which
historically Liberals have been able only to dream of at Westminster.
Being Scottish politics, nothing ever runs this smoothly. The gender
equality measures, which do not go far enough to satisfy some Labour
women who want 50:50 enshrined in statute, are now being resisted by
some Liberal Democrats who abhor the idea of coercive enforcement of
positive discrimination.
And for Labour, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson, set his
cat among the Lib-Dem pigeons by coming out strongly against a Scottish
parliament of more than 112 members. This dashes Liberal Democrat
aspirations for proportional representation. As a result, a fiery debate
is certain in Perth tomorrow, and further tough negotiations lie ahead.
The logic of this political conflict is set out in a policy paper
drawn up by SLD headquarters staff which applies the various proposed
new electoral systems to previous election results. It is a complicated
number-crunching exercise but in essence it shows that the bigger the
parliament on Calton Hill the more fairly representative it can be made.
The 73 constituency MPs (on existing boundaries but with one each of
Orkney and Shetland) would be elected on a first-past-the-post basis --
that in itself a major concession by the Lib-Dems who prefer a
transferable vote system.
There then would be a number of additional members for each of the
eight European constituencies -- nine for each, suggest the SLD --
elected on a corrective basis to produce overall party proportionality.
With five additional members in each European constituency, Labour
would gain an advantage in a 112-seat house.
However, if the number of additional members were increased to nine in
each European constituency in a house with 144 members, then other
parties would get a share of seats almost identical to their percentage
vote.
If Labour holds firm on 112 seats (or 113 if Orkney and Shetland get
their own MP) it will face the accusation internally that it has
jeopardised a gender equality deal, and externally will stand accused of
destroying the consensus built up in the Scottish Constitutional
Convention for the sake of narrow electoral advantage.

THE SNP yesterday launched a detailed attack on the Government over
housing policy, and confirmed that Scottish housing is the subject it
has chosen for debate in the Scottish Grand Committee at Westminster
next week.
SNP vice-president Andrew Welsh told a Westminster news conference
that there was a huge unmet housing need in Scotland and that this was a
tragedy for thousands of Scots.
He said: ''There is no shortage of evidence, including the Scottish
House Condition Survey, to show that the right to a warm, dry, secure
home is one that continues to elude too many of our citizens.
''95,000 Scottish houses are below tolerable standard; 267,000
Scottish homes suffer from dampness; 392,000 Scottish homes have
condensation.''
He said that under the SNP there would be a new structure, with a
six-point plan including a Minister for Housing, a restructuring of
capital housing debt to release money for new building, and the
abolition of Scottish Homes.
It would be replaced by an agency with the sole purpose of providing
''good quality housing and a high standard of public sector
management.''
The SNP attack coincided with a defence by Mr Major of his record when
Lambeth Council's housing chairman.
He dismissed Opposition charges that he had been responsible for two
of Britain's ugliest council tower blocks.
To loud Tory cheers at Question Time, he said: ''The buildings I am
supposed to have been responsible for were designed and approved by the
Labour council before I was elected to the council, let alone became
housing chairman,'' he said.
Mr Major's strident defence of his actions 25 years ago followed
Wednesday's row over his attack on socialist planners, when he accused
them of creating soul-less concrete wastelands in the country's inner
cities.
He told Labour leader Tony Blair: ''You talk about higher standards in
politics and you let the Labour Party indulge in falsehoods, day after
day.''

NEXT, the Major papers. MPs tired of denouncing Winston Churchill Jnr
for supposedly clearing a cool #13m for the sale of the old hero's
private papers are now clamouring quietly for the Major papers to be
promised as a bequest to the nation.
The Sketch has learned that they include a scribbled list of his
preferred English cricket team against Australia in 1956 from his
Rutlish Grammar School days; part of a shorthand note by an admirer of
his first soapbox speech at Brixton aged 16; and a note scribbled on
Standard Bank notepaper listing his choice to represent England against
the West Indies in 1973.
In the Commons, he set the record straight about his housebuilding
record. Following his visit to a dismal high-rise council estate the
previous day, Labour's Environment spokesman Frank Dobson claimed that
Mr Major was condemning the very blocks he had been responsible for
erecting when chairman of Lambeth's housing committee.
In fact, said Mr Major demolishing Mr Dobson as he was inclined to
demolish the blocks, they were designed and approved by Labour when in
office before he was even elected to the council. The Major archives
will enable scholars to delve more deeply into this incident when they
are opened to the nation.
Mr Major thought he saw Mr Blair or Mr Prescott, it was not clear
which, ''shift uneasily'' as he made this rejoinder. For all its
leader's fine words -- he might have been thinking of ''I lead my party,
you follow yours'' -- Labour indulged in falsehoods ''day after day
after day.'' Messrs Blair and Prescott demonstrated they were top-class
politicians by not blinking an eyelid.
Mr Major moved on to sort out the Churchill papers controversy but,
needless to say, not everyone was satisified. The Opposition is prepared
to approve winning the Second World War and obtaining a ceasefire in
Northern Ireland, but feels that is really as far as any self-respecting
Opposition can go.
Ms Diane Abbott (Hackney North -- Lab.), who had just finished polling
them, said her constituents were ''amazed'' that this money, which they
had donated had been splashed out on these papers -- what a colleague Mr
Bernie Grant (Tottenham -- Lab.) had dismissed as ''just words.''
The Attlee family had donated Clem's personal papers to the national
gratis, she said complacently.
Mr Toby Jessel (Twickenham -- Con.) reminded Labour that, had Old
Winston not inspired us, we might have been governed by Adolf Hitler.
That would have been considerably nastier than anything that had
happened in the last 50 years, so, as Mr Jessel spluttered out, we owe
Sir Winston.
''But not him,'' snapped Mr Dale Campbell-Savours (Workington --
Lab.), indicating that area where the current Winson Spencer Churchill
is wont to sit but was, probably prudently, not sitting at the time.
What correspondence did actually belong to Winston rather than the
nation he saved was raised by Mr Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North --
Lab.), with the implication that he thought the right answer was ''not
very much.''
Mr Tony Newton, the Commons Leader, rather neatly replied that he
hardly thought letters from a schoolboy to his mother could be classed
as state papers.
He also withstood furious Opposition allegations that he was ''gagging
parliament'' by having steadfastly refused to give Labour a day to
debate a subject of its choice for a whole six weeks.
The Shadow Leader, Mrs Anne Taylor, who, one suspects, likes Mr
Newton, softened her tirade by supposing that heavy pressure had been
put on him.
Labour wants to debate the NHS, confident that some London Tories are
so incensed with Mrs Bottomley's plans for their areas that they will
decline to support the Government.
It suspects that the Chief Whip, Mr Richard Ryder, may have scribbled
a note ''Dear Tony. Don't give them an NHS debate. We'll lose.
Richard.'' Mr Newton denied any such thing had happened. In that respect
at least, the Newton papers look like being a disappointment.

DAMASCUS: Junior Environment Minister Lord Ullswater concluded the
first official British visit to Syria in over a decade yesterday. He

OSLO: Norway's high court has ordered a 26-year-old man to face a new
trial for assault after ruling that his girlfriend's irritating
behaviour did not justify repeated beatings. A lower court had acquitted
the man, even though he admitted attacking his girlfriend. Its finding
that ''a woman must accept violence if she makes provocation part of her
lifestyle'' was condemned as a huge step backwards by rights groups.

BEIJING: The legend that Marco Polo was the first Westerner to travel
China in the thirteenth century has been debunked by veteran China
researcher Dr Frances Ward. His writings, she claims, fail to mention
the binding of women's feet, tea-drinking, or the Great Wall, and his
alleged route and itinerary make no geographic sense. She believes an
early ghost writer included other travellers' accounts of what they had
seen, leaving Polo, who probably reached no further than Constantinople,
to take the credit.

El Reno, Oklahoma, Thursday
THE prime suspect in the Oklahoma City explosion was seen driving a
truck used for the bomb the day before the attack, a court was told
today.
FBI agent John Hersley said that witnesses saw suspect Timothy McVeigh
in the rented truck on April 18, the day before a huge explosion
devastated a federal government building in Oklahoma City.
Hersley was giving evidence at a court hearing at the El Reno prison
outside Oklahoma City where McVeigh, 27, has been held since last
Friday. A federal magistrate was hearing a prosecution application to
keep McVeigh in custody.
Hersley said the licence plate of the truck was found intact after the
explosion.
Witnesses had said they saw McVeigh in the truck outside a motel in
Junction City, Kansas, about 250 miles north of Oklahoma City, in the
early hours of April 18.
Two court-appointed lawyers for McVeigh asked to be relieved from the
case, saying they had several friends killed in the blast. The
magistrate rejected their application.
He also rejected an application for the case to moved outside Oklahoma
because defence lawyers say McVeigh cannot get a fair trial there.
The hearing was continuing.
McVeign, a member of right-wing paramilitary groups, showed interest
at the hearing only once, when a defence lawyer read out the story of
President Clinton visiting Oklahoma City for a memorial service.
An intense manhunt has failed to find a second suspect alleged to have
rented the truck with McVeigh.
FBI Special Agent Weldon Kennedy said at least a dozen ''lookalikes''
had been reported to police, but none was the dark-haired, tattooed man
shown in a police sketch.
In Washington earlier, FBI Chief Louis Freeh warned the Senate
judiciary committee that individuals and groups in the US were arming
themselves against law enforcement agencies and called for a greater
intelligence effort against them.
Freeh said he was greatly concerned about terrorist attacks on
American soil in which the aim would be to ''murder as many as possible
through a single blow''.
Freeh said the FBI had been at an extreme disadvantage in tracking
potentially-dangerous armed groups because the agency had no
intelligence or background information on them until their violent talk
became deadly action.
''I do not support broad and undefined intelligence collection
efforts, but law enforcement has to know something about those
individuals and groups . . . The first rule of self defence is to know
the enemy who intends to destroy you.''
Senate Republican leader Bob Dole today introduced an anti-terrorism
Bill that included many measures sought by President Clinton after the
bombing.
The death toll from the blast reached 110 today as search crews found
11 more bodies in the rubble of the building.--Reuter.

THE biggest star of the BBC TV series Hamish Macbeth is being put out
to pasture.
Heather the Highland cow, seen in more than one episode lumbering
through the main street of the fictional Highland village of Lochdubh,
is to be sold.
The 10-year-old Skye-born beast has become a victim of her own
popularity.
Her owner, Mr Dolan MacKenzie, 56, at his home in Plockton -- Lochdubh
to followers of the TV series -- said yesterday: ''It's a sad business
but I am getting rid of her on safety grounds. She is the nicest,
gentlest beast I've ever owned but with those big horns of hers there
could be an accident.
''Visitors to the village recognise her from the TV and cluster round
her taking photographs. Just yesterday she was lying on the village
green and five tourists were taking it in turn to kneel at her side
while the cameras clicked.
''I heard that on another occasion a child was placed by her head for
a photograph. Well, Heather just has to toss her head to avoid flies or
something and someone could be accidentally injured by her horns. I
could never have it on my conscience if a child or someone lost an
eye.''
Mr MacKenzie is asking #1000 for Heather but whoever buys her will be
getting two for the price of one -- she is expecting a calf in November.

TWO of the leading lights of the Scottish art world were interviewed
on Tuesday for the post of head of the Victoria and Albert Museum, in
London.
Mr Julian Spalding, director of Glasgow museums, and Mr Timothy
Clifford, head of the National Galleries of Scotland, who is based in
Edinburgh, are among only nine candidates to be granted interviews. A
decision on who gets the post, which pays at least #60,000 a year, is
due in three weeks.
The V &amp; A has a budget of around #30m, is the national museum of
decorative art and has major sculpture, photography, and ceramic
exhibits. The present director, Ms Elizabeth Esteve Coll, is resigning
to become vice-chancellor of East Anglia University.
There are five external candidates and four applications from people
working within the V &amp; A. Mr Clifford and Mr Spalding are believed to be
among the front runners, along with Mr Alan Borg, head of the Imperial
War Museum. Both are high-profile candidates with a wealth of arts
experience and neither is a stranger to controversy.
Mr Spalding caused an uproar when he passed over Ms Elspeth King for
the job of curator of social history around five years ago. Mr Clifford
had to apologise, in the recent row over the Three Graces, when he
claimed that Mr John Paul Getty had not got on with his father.
On the positive side, Mr Spalding helped guide Glasgow through the
European City of Culture events in 1990, opened the McLellan Galleries,
and conceived and helped open the St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and
Art. He is currently working on a new project to open a gallery of
modern art in Glasgow next year.
Mr Clifford has been director of the National Galleries of Scotland
since 1984. He has great contacts in the arts world and is a leading
member of a variety of leading arts groups.

CALLOUS killer Kenneth McGuire, who twice threw a man from his fourth
floor window during a Hogmanay party, was jailed yesterday.
Lord Osborne, who described the murder as ''primitive barbarity''
recommended that McGuire, 35, serve a minimum of 15 years.
The body of Mr Kenneth Syme, 48, of Fullers Gate, Faifley, Clydebank,
was found with horrific injuries, stuffed into a wheelie-bin, more than
10 hours after the party.
The judge told McGuire, who sat impassive in the dock at the High
Court in Glasgow: ''Decent people will find it quite appalling that
after the injured victim was carried back up, after being first thrown
out, that you ejected him once again.
''To my mind, that demonstrates a sheer wickedness and a complete lack
of human feeling. I regard it as breath-takingly savage behaviour.''
A jury unanimously found McGuire guilty of repeatedly throwing Mr Syme
from the window of his fourth floor flat at Watchmeal Crescent, Faifley,
on January 1 last, and murdering him, and assaulting another man, Mr
John Slevin, 39, at the party to his permanent disfigurement.
After he was led to the cells, McGuire's place in the dock was taken
by his friend and flatmate Michael Fay, 29.
During the trial, Fay's plea of not guilty to murder was accepted by
the Crown and he admitted a reduced charge of attempting to murder Mr
Syme by helping to throw him out of the window the first time.
Lord Osborne jailed him for nine years.
Raymond Henfry, 28, also had his plea of not guilty to murder accepted
during the trial and subsequently gave evidence. He admitted a charge of
helping to move Mr Syme's body in a wheelie-bin, but the Crown did not
move for sentence and he was released.
Mr Syme's body was found doubled up head down in the bin by a
nine-year-old boy on New Year's Day.
He had multiple fractures and internal injuries but medical evidence
showed he might still have been alive when he was crammed into the bin.
Henfry told Mr Ian Duguid, prosecuting, he looked into a bedroom in
the flat about 1.25am and saw McGuire and Fay holding Mr Syme out of the
window.
When he tried to pull the man back by the legs, he was pushed aside by
McGuire.
Henfry told the court: ''The man was trying to hold on to the sides of
the window but he disappeared over the edge screaming: 'No, no'.''
Henfry returned to the party with the two accused and said McGuire
told him Mr Syme had owed him money.
Then he said he persuaded Fay to go downstairs with him and together
they assisted the victim back to the same bedroom.
Henfry said Mr Syme was still breathing and he used his knowledge of
first aid, gained in the Territorial Army, to check for any fractures
and found none.
As he was checking Mr Syme, McGuire burst in and shouted: ''What the
f*** is that bastard doing back here?''
McGuire then pushed him away from the bed, grabbed Mr Syme by the back
of his neck and trousers and threw him out of the window again.
Henfry, a barman, who has moved to an undisclosed address, admitted
that later he went down with McGuire and claimed the accused put Mr Syme
in the wheelie-bin and pushed him to a lock-up garage.
Other witnesses agreed they were so frightened of McGuire that they
all continued to drink at the party and that none of them telephoned for
help.
The jury heard that, during the party, McGuire flew into a rage when
he heard Mr Slevin call another party-goer ''An Orange bastard'' and
kicked and punched him unconscious.
McGuire's bedroom was full of Rangers photographs and colours, and the
bed-spread on which Mr Syme was laid was in the Ibrox club's colours.

SNP leader Alex Salmond yesterday said he had worries about the lack
of self-confidence among Scottish youngsters.
He said the phenomenon of the ''silent Scot'' had hindered efforts to
make Scotland pre-eminent as a commercial and industrial powerhouse, as
it had been 100 years ago.
He told the annual conference of Catholic secondary school
headmasters, meeting in Crieff, that when he was a student, his fellow
Scots had an inferiority complex which, he suspected, was still the
case.
Mr Salmond emphasised after his speech that he did not think Scottish
schools could learn anything from English private ones.
In his address, he recalled that at St Andrews tutorials, Scottish
students sat in silence while those from English public schools spoke
garrulously.
However, he said, the ''silent Scots'' knew more about their subject
than those who were doing the talking.
Mr Salmond reaffirmed his party's commitment to denominational
education for as long as the Catholic community wanted it.
* THE head of a Catholic secondary told the conference that an ''enemy
within'' was compromising efforts to promote denominational education.
Mr Dick Lynas, head of Taylor High in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, said:
''It seems to me that there are many of our teaching colleagues, dare I
say it our head teachers, for whom the local Catholic comprehensive is
not good enough for their children.''
Earlier, he had asked Cardinal Thomas Winning if he agreed that there
was a growing number of ''enemies within''.
The Cardinal said he regretted that more Catholic parents were sending
their children to private schools or schools in better areas for social
reasons.

INSTITUTIONAL investors would prefer to see Britain's two nuclear
power generators privatised as a single concern and many would be happy
to buy the shares provided the numbers were right, analysts at
stockbrokers and fund managers said.
Several of those contacted by The Herald were cautious in their
comments, saying details of the Government's plan to sell off Nuclear
Electric and its smaller Scottish counterpart Scottish Nuclear for an
estimated #2000m next year were still sketchy.
A few, like Gavin Suggett, the managing director of Alliance Trust,
said they would probably stay clear of nuclear privatisation completely.
''It's a sector which we are not too keen on really,'' said Mr
Suggett, whose Dundee-based firm manages #1300m of trust funds.
''Our exposure to electricity is very small and has been running
down,'' Mr Suggett noted, adding he was sceptical about the quality of
management and the prospects for growth in privatised utilities
generally.
Some analysts said memories of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident in
the Ukraine and the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in the US in the
1970s, would put many investors off the nuclear privatisation, whatever
the economic arguments put forward.
But others, such as Mr Guy Cameron of Edinburgh-based fund managers
Baillie Gifford, said they expected investors to look at the nuclear
industry in the same way as any other investment.
''The nature of the nuclear issue is long term, so you need some
guarantees,'' Mr Cameron said.
But he added, ''We would look at it in the same way as any other
long-term investment and if the price was right we would invest.''
John Reynolds of London brokers James Capel was upbeat about the
prospects for selling off the two nuclear power stations operated by
Scottish Nuclear at Hunterston on the Clyde and Torness near Dunbar, and
six more operated by Nuclear Electric in England and Wales.
He and Mark Whittet, a spokesman for Scottish Nuclear, said the risks
and costs involved in the nuclear industry were much lower now than when
the Government aborted initial plans for privatising the sector in 1989.
Mr Reynolds said a milestone in fixing long-term costs for the nuclear
power generators was the signing of agreements between Scottish Nuclear
and Nuclear Electric and British Nuclear Fuels in early March for the
reprocessing of spent radio-active deal.
The two deals, which between them are worth about #7,000m, have fixed
the costs of reprocessing spent plutonium for the next 10 years at
least, he noted.
This figure covers reactors set to be privatised, not Magnox reactors.
The Scottish Nuclear spokesman said decommissioning costs were
officially calculated at 10% of the 2.2p cost of producing each Kilowatt
hour of nuclear generated electricity.
But he added that experience so far in dismantling old Magnox reactors
suggested that the real cost of closing down power stations would
actually be much lower.
The problem is that once a nuclear power station is shut down and
dismantled at the end of its useful life, it takes at least 100 years to
eliminate the risk of dangerous radiation from its remains.
Several analysts noted, this is a long period for any investor to be
sure of his costs on, but none thought the government was likely to
offer private investors a cap on the amount they would have to spend on
decommissioning.
''I don't think they would be very likely to give that kind of
guarantee,'' said Mr Cameron at Baillie Gifford.
Mr Reynolds at James Capel and other analysts said investors would
definitely prefer to see Scottish Nuclear merged with Nuclear Electric
as a single concern before privatisation, even though this would
constitute a political snub to Scotland.
''The larger the entity, the greater the economy of scale, the smaller
the risk and the lower the impact of the removal from operation of an
individual power station,'' Mr Reynolds said.
''You would then have a company that was big enough to take part in
the international market and this would give it potential for future
expansion which is very important,'' he added.
At present only the US and Japan have privately owned nuclear power
stations, but Mr Reynolds said he saw potential for building and
operating privately owned nuclear power plants in large developing
countries such as China and Indonesia.
Analysts said a further attraction of amalgamating Scottish Nuclear
and Nuclear Electric into a single concern would be the cost savings and
increased efficiency that could be achieved as a result which would lead
to windfall gains in the early years.
Mr Reynolds estimated that efficiency gains from a merger could cut
nuclear generating costs to 2.0p per kilowatt hour from 2.2p at present,
but Scottish Nuclear, which is fighting to preserve its independence,
aims to achieve this by 1998 anyway.
Mr Reynolds estimated that a merger of Scottish Nuclear with
Cheltenham-based Nuclear Electric, could produce savings in
administration costs of up to #15m, but other analysts who declined to
be named said the figure could be much higher.
Mr Reynolds said that although present Government plans aim to weld
Scottish Nuclear and Nuclear Electric into a single firm before
privatisation, the new company would establish a headquarters in
Edinburgh and retain a separate operating division in Scotland. This
would help preserve a separate Scottish identity.
He denied suggestions that the industry's future private owners would
then simply shift operations south of the Border.
''I think investors will accept that one has to have political
sensitivities and that there are certain head office functions which can
quite rationally be based in Scotland,'' Mr Reynolds said.
Analysts said they expected strongest demand for nuclear power shares
to come from British institutional investors, but did not see the
already privatised electricity distribution firms as major bidders.
Few saw much foreign interest, especially in view of the sharp price
falls suffered by Powergen and National Power immediately after their
final phase of privatisation earlier this year in reaction to comments
by the electricity industry regulator Stephen Littlechild.
One analyst who did not wish to be named, said Japanese investors
would probably be put off by the risk of currency fluctuations.
Two of those contacted by the Herald reckoned the sale of Scottish
Nuclear and Nuclear Electric, stripped of their Magnox reactors, could
raise about #2000m but several other analysts said it was too early to
estimate their market value.
Mr Reynolds of James Capel said the Government could supplement income
from the privatisation by a further #1000m by prolonging the life of
several Magnox reactors for two years beyond their originally planned
shutdown date.
The Magnox reactors produce about 30% of Britain's nuclear generated
electricity.

THE political crisis enveloping the Scottish Nuclear industry was
triggered on Tuesday April 18 when the Treasury Ministers realised that
the Government had missed its public sector borrowing target for last
year by #1,200m.
Suddenly, and quite unexpectedly, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke found
himself with less cash in hand to spend on tax cuts.
At that time, there was no obvious connection between another set of
bad figures and the future of a successful Scottish industry. However,
for Mr Clarke, faced with pressure from worried Tory backbenchers to
deliver a pre-election tax cut, the figures were unwelcome news.
By borrowing more last year than it had planned to -- #35,500m instead
of #34,300m -- the Government has been brought up short.
Sources claim that within days the Treasury began looking around for
something to sell quickly and for maximum profit. With little left to
privatise, the nuclear power generating companies were obvious
candidates.
The Scottish Office has always been assiduous in promoting Scottish
Nuclear's interests, and its wish to be privatised as a separate company
either on its own or by the so-called four-four option, transferring two
stations from Nuclear Electric which would leave the two companies
evenly matched.
However, Nuclear Electric, led by chairman, Mr John Collier, and his
chief executive, Dr Robert Hawley, has been a shrewd player in the
lobbying game, insisting all along that the very least it would be
looking for would be to hold on to the six modern reactors it currently
operates.
According to sources, however, the public sector borrowing figures
triggered a mild panic at the Treasury, and killed off any chance of a
considered approach: speed and a high return were now paramount.
Treasury Ministers let it be known they believed the industry would sell
quickly and profitably as a single entity. In a flash, the Scottish
Office's concerns had been swept aside by political imperative.
Last week, on Wednesday night, the Cabinet economics sub-committee met
to discuss the sale. Ministers present included Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang, Trade President Michael Heseltine, Environment Secretary John
Gummer, Treasury Chief Secretary Michael Portillo, and Welsh Secretary
John Redwood. The options were set out and officials were sent away to
draw up a submission for yesterday's full Cabinet meeting, at which a
final decision would be taken.
That, at least, was one version of events. However, a number of
sources have told The Herald that the prefered option had in fact
already been decided upon before the sub-committee meeting.
One source claims that well before the Ministers sat down Treasury
officials were telling a select number of trusted journalists that the
nuclear generators would be sold off in one block.
At 9.30 the next morning the departments involved had the decision for
an all-in-one sale confirmed. News of the decision began to filter out.
Scottish MPs with a close interest in the industry had been alerted at
the Commons, and the word spread. On Thursday night the last shuttle
from Heathrow to Glasgow and Edinburgh is usually packed with MPs. One
person working the phones that afternoon said: ''We made sure the right
people were alerted. The shuttle departure lounge was our jungle drum
mechanism.''
Scottish Nuclear managers were not told officially until Friday
morning. For some the news was not a complete surprise. A few weeks
earlier, Nuclear Electric put out a newsletter in which Mr Mark Baker,
executive director of corporate affairs made an impassioned case for the
all-in-one privatisation.
Those who understand the industry heard alarm bells. In particular,
Nuclear Electric's promise that it would preserve the Scottish
operation's ''Scottishness'' was received with disbelief. Scottish
Nuclear chief executive, Mr Robin Jeffreys, is said to have asked:
''What's that supposed to mean? That they'll have us working in kilts?''
For Labour the future of Scottish Nuclear has become a campaign issue.
The batch of questions tabled yesterday by front bench spokesman, Mr
John McFall, is just the latest step in a closely co-ordinated strategy,
deemed important enough to be discussed at length at Wednesday's Shadow
Cabinet.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson was alerted on Friday by
trade and industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson. A succession of telephone
coversations with nuclear industry contacts and colleagues including
Shadow Trade and Industry Secretary Jack Cunningham followed. It was
agreed that the issue was a crucial one for Scotland.
On Saturday, Mr Robertson put out a press release, only to find to his
astonishment that the Sunday press ignored it and relegated the story to
the business pages.
By Monday, however, the story had picked up steam. Scottish opposition
MPs were preparing their strategy for Wednesday's hour-long session of
Scottish Questions. Mr Ian Lang prepared for it that morning by briefing
journalists in his Commons Office. He gave no details but made clear he
was fighting for a solution that would not harm Scotland's interests --
and he said it would not be coming up in Thursday's Cabinet meeting
after all.
Tory MPs were equally busy. Ayr MP, Mr Phil Gallie, a former power
station manager with close links to Scottish Power, heard the news from
a reporter on Saturday night. Back in London on Monday, he took steps to
better inform himself. He held an informal meeting with Energy Minister
Tim Eggar, who denied an announcement was imminent.
At first the Scottish Tory backbenchers showed signs of incipient
rebellion, in particular the Eastwood MP and former minister, Mr Allan
Stewart. However, by Scottish Questions on Wednesday afternoon their
objections had become muted. Labour claims its good behaviour in the
Commons was bought with the promise of a private meeting with Mr Lang,
which took place later on Wednesday afternoon.
The meeting lasted more than an hour. Mr Lang refused to detail his
plans, but the MPs emerged reassured that he would not present them with
an unacceptable solution. Later, they spoke of a good result, having
made clear to Mr Lang that they were seeking guarantees that Scottish
Nuclear's management should stay in place.
Scottish politicians are unanimous in their admiration for Mr James
Hann, Scottish Nuclear's chairman, and chief executive, Mr Jeffreys.
They are credited with transforming the company. And they are not
considered Tory placemen. One MP said of Mr Hann: ''He was appointed by
the Secretary of State, but he's not one of them.''
MPs expressed astonishment that he was not consulted by Ministers,
although this week he had two meetings with Scottish Office officials.
Nuclear Electric is politically strong at Westminster. It has a number
of obvious allies among English Tory MPs. It helps that a number of
Cabinet Ministers, for example, have nuclear reactors in their
constituencies: Dungeness is in Home Secretary Michael Howard's,
Sizewell is in Environment Secretary John Gummer's. And, according to
the Register of Members Interests, Croydon South MP, Mr Richard Ottaway,
accepted a day's sailing for his family from Nuclear Electric. By some
coincidence, he is Mr Michael Heseltine's Parliamentary Private
Secretary.
With the White Paper and a Cabinet decision apparently deferred until
after the English local elections on May 4, speculation at Westminster
now suggests that the Government has tested the waters and discovered
the temperature is too hot. By defering an announcement, it has given
itself time to put together a commercial case which, it hopes, will mask
the fact that this decision is being taken for strictly political
motives.
Unfortunately for Scotland, the Government's only doubts about this
sell-off centre on the likely reaction of the electricity regulator,
Professor Stephen Littlechild, to the creation of a monopoly company,
who is forcing other generators to reduce their capacity. Nationalist
moanings from north of the Border have no political weight at all.
There is some suggestion that the Scottish Office and Mr Lang are
working on finding a way to sell the four-four solution to the Treasury
as a quick and profitable sale. The idea would be to find a way around
the seemingly insoluble delays posed by the strict rules governing the
transfer of safety licences that a split up of the industry would
require. Even if a way were found, however, there is no evidence that
selling the two companies separately would raise as much money as one,
near-monopoly giant would.
Labour is promising to make as much of this issue as it did of water
and the Post Office. However, because it is still working out its own
attitudes to nuclear power, it will not go all the way and promise to
return a privatised nuclear industry to the public sector.
''Scottishness''? What's that supposed to mean? That they'll have us
working in kilts?
Mr Robin Jeffreys

A PILOT scheme for young Scottish entrepreneurs -- pioneered in US
ghettos -- was launched yesterday at an education conference in Glasgow.
Mr Steve Mariotti, president of the US National Foundation for
Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE), unveiled details of the Scottish
scheme. It is based on a model developed in rundown areas of cities such
as New York and Chicago.
Mr Mariotti said the classes in how to start up businesses had tackled
poverty and reduced social problems such as drug abuse and teenage
pregnancies.
In Scotland, 12 teachers have been trained to NFTE standards and Mr
Mariotti added that the project could eventually be open to all Scottish
youngsters. Scottish Enterprise is funding the first year of the scheme
and hopes to attract private sector investment of #50,000 a year if the
classroom project is to succeed beyond 12 months.
Speaking at the international Education Business Partnership
conference, Mr Mariotti said: ''Hopefully, every child in Scotland will
learn how to start a new business at a young age.''
He said Scotland should learn lessons from the social problems in US
cities: ''You don't want to end up like we have ended up. It's a bad
situation. I urge you to be very, very careful with your society.''
Mr Mariotti said the history of Scottish people as inventors, traders,
and entrepreneurs was an ''enormous advantage'' and the strong education
system would help young businessmen and women.

FORESTRY workers and firefighters tackled another major forest fire in
Dumfries and Galloway last night amid warnings of the danger of yet more
outbreaks.
Several square miles of hill land and a small section of a forest were
destroyed at Craigenveoch Farm, in Glenluce, in the second big blaze in
less than 12 hours.
More than 50 firefighters and forestry workers were drafted in when
the fire was thought to have got out of control on an area of hill land.
The flames swept forward on a 1000m front and more personnel were
placed on standby.
The fire spread to a mature plantation of trees but a wind change
saved the forest.
Earlier, a fire 15 miles away at Glenvernoch, Bargrennan, was brought
under control by more than 100 workers and firefighters from seven
brigades from Dumfries and Galloway and Strathclyde.
They fought the blaze for nearly 10 hours.It destroyed around 700
acres of grass and shrubs and at one stage was burning on a one-mile
wide front.
Mr Stan Cochrane, of Forest Enterprise at Newton Stewart, said
yesterday: ''We have been working round the clock and many of us have
not been to bed.
''At this time of the year, everyone has to help out.
''It is a critical time for us. We have men standing by, ready to go
into action.
''During the night, we had a very serious situation when a 1000m front
of flames was sweeping down to a forest plantation and it was only
stopped by a great effort and by a firebreak.
''It was literally a few metres from the trees.''
A Forest Enterprise spokesman said: ''This is the worst time of the
year with the ground drying out, the grass dry, and hill farmers needing
to burn off the old grass.
''It is very bad this year with a number of fires and the danger of
more, especially over the holiday weekend.
''We are appealing to people visiting the countryside to take extreme
care with matches and lights because it takes very little to start what
could be a major fire.
''It is also very easy for controlled burning to get out of control.
Everyone must take great care at this time of the year.''

TREASURY Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken yesterday carried out his
threat to take legal action against Granada Television over allegations
about his business affairs made in its World in Action programme.
In a short statement issued at Westminster, Mr Aitken said he had
issued a writ for defamation against the company following the current
affairs programme on April 10.
Mr Aitken had threatened to sue if the programme repeated allegations
about him that were contained in the Guardian earlier this month.
On the eve of the broadcast, he announced a libel action against the
newspaper for publishing ''wicked lies'' about his business activities.
Granada went ahead with the 30-minute programme, updating it to
include sections of Mr Aitken's statement denying the main allegations.
When Mr Aitken announced he had issued a writ for defamation against
the Guardian, he said he would fight against the ''cancer of bent and
twisted journalism''.
A Granada Television spokesman said: ''We stand by the programme and
this action will be vigorously contested.''
It is not yet clear whether whether Mr Aitken will take legal action
against the Independent newspaper.
On April 12, Mr Aitken said he was examining a transcript of the World
in Action programme with his legal advisers and would also be looking at
recent press articles -- particularly those in the Independent -- about
his role as non-executive director of a Grantham-based arms company.
The Independent said yesterday it had not received any indication of
legal action against it from Mr Aitken.

Robbie Dinwoodie, Scottish Political Correspondent, examines the
issues facing the Scottish Liberal Democrats as they gather for their
conference
THERE will be a move by Liberal Democrat activists to tear up the
electoral deal proposed with Labour to improve gender equality in a
future Scottish parliament, when they meet for their spring conference
in Perth, which starts today. The strong objection to the mechanism to
get as many women MPs as possible into the new parliament comes from
Edinburgh South constituency party and reflects wider unease that the
plan for a voluntarily entered but binding ''electoral contract'' with
Labour to field equal numbers of male and female candidates is too
coercive.
It is planned to use at least one of the two female SLD councillors
from the constituency -- Councillor Moyra Forrest or Councillor Sue
Trittin -- to move or second the amendment rejecting the deal, according
to local party secretary Mike Falchikov.
He said the use of a woman and man as proposer and seconder would be a
signal that the party was not against greater numbers of women in
elected public life but was against artificial mechanisms to achieve
this.
''The strong feeling that is shared by many women in the party is that
they would rather be elected on merit than on some artificial quota and
that this electoral contract comes rather too close to being such a
quota,'' he said.
The electoral contract on gender balance, which Labour most wants, is
bound up with the related issue of using the additional members system
to create proportional representation in the new Parliament, which the
SLD has long argued for.
Digging in on one principle could jeopardise the other, but Mr
Falchikov said: ''We sense that Labour is moving away from the deal
anyway. They are feeling very pleased with themselves after their recent
election results and some of us are a little sceptical about why we
should be helping them to solve what is one of their problems.''
SLD leader Jim Wallace said yesterday that he expected a fiery debate
on the subject, but he hoped delegates would take a balanced view of
what has been achieved.
''It has to be recognised that both sides are making concessions and I
am not sure that some in the Labour Party have recognised how much we
have conceded.''
His message to delegates in Perth was: ''Don't let the best be the
enemy of good. Don't let us reject was is a good solution because we
haven't got an ideal solution. Let's maximise our influence and
recognise how far we have come within the Scottish Constitutional
Convention.''
THE loss of local accountability and the rise of the quango in
Scotland will come under the spotlight at the Perth conference tomorrow
(writes Frances Horsburgh).
A fringe meeting backed by the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities will look at ''Countering the Quango Culture'' a problem
which Cosla's Labour president Rosemary McKenna calls the insidious
drift away from democracy.
She said yesterday: ''When the new unitary authorities take over next
year there will be just 1200 locally-democratically elected councillors
in Scotland, yet there are at present around 7000 quango members.''
Councillor McKenna has received some criticism for accepting a number
of appointments on quangos herself but she insisted she had done so as
someone who had a responsibility to the people of the country who had
exercised their democratic right in electing her.

STRONG calls were made yesterday by police officers for sectarian
marches to be banned on Scotland's public roads.
Delegates at the Scottish Police Federation's annual conference in
Peebles heard a Lothian and Borders constable claim the marches incited
hatred on the streets.
Constable Norman MacLeod said he believed the vast majority of the
public would rather have money spent on crime prevention and detection
than see valuable resources being used ''to escort intolerant bigots
through our towns and cities''.
He was submitting a motion from his force's joint branch board asking
the SPF's Joint Central Committee to recognise the serious disruption
caused by sectarian marches and to seek amendment to legislation
''precluding the use of any road for such processions''.
Mr MacLeod stressed he was not a bigot and the motion had nothing to
do with his own religious or political beliefs but was brought for
purely practical policing reasons.
He was not advocating people should be deprived of their democratic
rights, although he considered it inappropriate they should be allowed
to display their intolerance towards the views of others by marching in
public thoroughfares.
''Let them meet in public parks if they so wish. That would be
considerably easier to police.''
Seconding him, Constable John Finnie, from Northern Constabulary, said
bigotry was ''a horrible beast which carries various flags, wears an
assortment of insignia and colours, and regrettably is not extinct in
Scotland''.
He highlighted the efforts of the neo-Nazi organisation Combat 18 to
recruit support from among Hearts and Rangers supporters and said this
should ''set alarm bells ringing''.
Mr Finnie said Irish Republican and Loyalist extremists had long found
support in Scotland and large numbers of ''misguided individuals'' had
been more than happy to display visibly and audibly that support on
sectarian marches.
''I remain unconvinced by tales that these marches are long-standing
historic ceremonies of religious significance. Were we to accept that
view, then we would have some difficulty with the casting of first-born
male babies into rivers or the burning of witches.
''I would like to think every one of our citizens, of whatever race or
creed, could feel free from the intimidation, direct or indirect, which
these legacies from the Dark Ages engender.'' The conference later
approved the motion.
This week, the James Connolly Society in Scotland appealed to
Loyalists to call a truce over a planned march in June in memory of the
Edinburgh Republican. Loyalists, however, have pledged opposition.
Mr Jack Ramsay, Grand Secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland,
said later the motion did not apply to them: ''There is no category
taking the definition of the word sectarian that the Orange Order falls
into.''

A STRATHCLYDE police officer at the conference yesterday called for a
degree of sanity to be introduced into weapons legislation.
He claimed some people saw the carrying of a knife as a necessity and
''almost as a design fashion accessory''.
Constable David Yule said: ''There are more replica Ghurka knives in
Glasgow than the Royal Regiment of Ghurkas has.''
Proposing a licensing system for knives, he said that over the years,
certain types of weapons such as switchblades and flick knives had been
specifically proscribed with not just possession being an offence but
importation and sale also being banned.
He said: ''Certain elements in our society see the carrying of a knife
as a necessity, almost as a designer fashion accessory to put in the
pocket of a good suit on the way to the pub.''
Constable Yule, proposing a Strathclyde Joint Branch Board motion,
accepted there could never be any effective blanket ban on knives.
''Every kitchen drawer is an armoury and we have to accept the risk of
criminal use of common objects.''
The motion, however, was about ''fearsome'' items which could have no
inconceivable legal use whatsoever or a very restricted one.
He spoke of items which were on open and legal sale, sometimes by mail
order, and which seemed to him to be merely ''instances of a serious
assault looking for a locus''.
Displaying to the conference a baton revealing a 10-inch knife, he
also highlighted a stiletto blade inside a ball-point pen available over
the counter for under #5 and a 14-inch Rambo knife with serrated
sections and a sharp-spiked handle -- ''yours for only #39.99 by mail
order''.
The conference approved the motion asking the Federation's Joint
Central Committee to seek new legislation.

<RECORDNO>978665747</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Two major moves
against crime were unveiled yesterday by Strathclyde Police Chief
Constable Leslie Sharp.
He told members of the regional council's police and fire committee of
plans to increase the force by 258 constables.
It was only in January this year that the force actually reached its
establishment for the first time in its history. Now it could meet a
Government requirement to increase numbers further without increasing
the police budget.
Mr Sharp added a proposal to use #93,000 of seized drug-dealing money
to buy special radio equipment which would prevent criminals from
listening to police operations.
''The Government keep moving the goalposts,'' Mr Sharp told the
committee. ''To get any more constables, we have to do it without
spending new money.
''I propose to do so by cutting back on overtime. Some savings may
arise from rationalisation of our rank structure also.''
He admitted that cutting overtime would be a very bold step, as it
would create practical difficulties. It would mean using #1.5m of the
#12.172m 1995-96 overtime budget, with a further #2.53m to meet the
1996-97 costs.
As far as the #93,000 was concerned, this had undoubtedly been
intended for the purchase of illicit drugs, he added, and had been the
proceeds of previous drug dealing. Using it in enforcement of drug
legislation seemed to him ''a most appropriate use''.
He said later: ''The extra constables, assuming we get approval from
the Secretary of State, will be used on the street. It is in response to
the unquenchable thirst by the public for more police on the beat.
''The special radio equipment means that, if criminals do listen in to
our operations, all they will hear is a white water sound. The equipment
is expensive and we have some already. This money will help the drugs
squad enormously. The criminals will not know what is going on.''

VETERAN rocker Rod Stewart may today have his plans to stage a concert
in Aberdeen's Pittodrie stadium rejected by councillors.
The pop star aims to hold a concert in the football ground in June --
one of only two Scottish gigs he is performing as part of his
forthcoming world tour.
Tickets for the event, when he will be backed by Gaelic group Runrig,
are already selling well in the city.
However, Aberdeen councillors are known to be angry that tickets were
available before they have given approval for the event.
They will hear from their environmental development director, Mr
George Duffus, that the stadium is an unsuitable venue and the show
would create a noise nuisance.
In his report, Mr Duffus says that despite numerous attempts to
contact the promoters, Marshall Arts, his department has been unable get
details of sound and power equipment, lighting and staging to be used.
Local residents have been vociferous in their objections, with more
than 400 signing a petition against it.
If the committee gives the concert approval, Mr Duffus recommends it
should be over by 10.30pm and closely regulated by his staff ''to ensure
noise levels are kept to a minimum''.
Meanwhile, Hibs supporters from the world of showbusiness will turn
back the clock, and look to the future, by staging a concert in
Edinburgh's Usher Hall next month to help the club raise money for the
development of Easter Road.
Players from the fifties to the present day will be introduced on
stage to recall their memories, as two of the club's most famous sons --
The Proclaimers --head a night of entertainment.

LABOUR MPs John McFall and Adam Ingram will today meet trade unionists
representing the Scottish nuclear power industry, as part of the
campaign to halt privatisation.
Mr McFall, Labour front-bench spokesman and MP for Dumbarton, has
tabled a series of parliamentary questions on the Government's plans for
Scottish Nuclear.
He wants to know what discussions Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has had
with the chairman of Scottish Nuclear on the company's future, what is
his estimate of the asset value of the nuclear energy industry in
Scotland and what measure he has made regarding the security and safety
implications of a privatised nuclear industry.
He also wants to know from the President of the Board of Trade, Mr
Michael Heseltine, what plans he has to privatise the nuclear energy
industry, and is asking about the compensation to Scottish consumers in
the light of the Government's intention to end the nuclear levy in
England and Wales.
The matter was not raised at Cabinet yesterday and Mr Robertson said:
''The Government is deliberately resorting to confusion in this area
because it is in a flat panic over the privatisation of the nuclear
industry. It is running scared.''
He added: ''With every word spoken, it becomes clearer that this is
simply a ploy by the Treasury to make money for tax cuts.''
Labour's position is that it is reviewing its policy on nuclear power
-- though its existing policy is that no more nuclear power plants
should be built. Its clear commitment at the moment, however, is to see
the industry retained in the public sector, mainly on the grounds of
safety and jobs.
The Scottish Office continued to take the line that Mr Lang was
battling hard to secure an agreement which would be in the best
interests of Scotland and the Scottish nuclear industry, and that both
Labour and the SNP were committed to running down the industry.

Sir Patrick, speaking ahead of the first exploratory meeting next week

decommissioning had to be ''an ongoing process'' to show good faith.
In earlier exchanges, United Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux
urged Sir Patrick to hold talks with the Clinton administration ''with a
view to designing measures to extricate terrorists, including those
posing as political parties, and removing from their hands all
instruments of terror and destruction''.
Sir Patrick replied that some time ago President Clinton had described
the need for a worldwide campaign against terrorism.
''I don't doubt for one minute that recent tragic events have
reinforced that opinion. It's one that we certainly share.''
Mr Seamus Mallon (Newry and Armagh -- SDLP) said public perception of
the Government's handling of the peace process recently had been one of
''vacilation and of clumsiness''.

THE Government can see see ''no good reason'' why China should
dismantle democratic reforms put in place in Hong Kong in the run-up to
the colony's return to Beijing rule, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd
insisted yesterday.
He told the Commons there was ''still a great deal to be done and
little time to do it'' before Britain's lease runs out on June 30, 1997.
However, common interests and links between Britain and China ''go far
beyond the differences which have from time to time divided us'', he
said.
During a debate on China and Hong Kong, Mr Hurd said: ''We have come a
long way and achieved a good deal since the Sino-British Joint
Declaration was signed in December 1994.''
He added: ''Together, we need -- as Britain, China and Hong Kong -- to
build a stronger and deeper partnership for the 800 days up to the
transfer of sovereignty and indeed thereafter.''
Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said there was anxiety and unease
in Hong Kong about the future.
He warned there would be disappointment in the colony that the
Government had offered no new initiative to break the ''deadlock'' in
talks with China.
Mr Cook said: ''Nothing would go further to boost the confidence (of
Hong Kong people) than for China to accede to the international covenant
on civil and political rights developed by the United Nations.''
Tory former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath, who recently visited
China and Hong Kong, welcomed Mr Hurd's ''quiet and conciliatory''
approach.
However, he urged the Government to be ''realistic'' about the future
and not to ''lecture'' China on matters like human rights.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair last night appeared to extend an olive branch
to the Liberal Democrats by expressing warmth about the prospect of
co-operation with Paddy Ashdown's party in government.
In advance of Labour's special constitutional conference tomorrow to
modernise the party, Mr Blair was scathing about the political left in
the 1960s and 1970s, saying its philosophy became dominated by a ''crude
form of Marxism''.
In an interview in today's New Statesman and Society magazine, the
Labour leader was relaxed about the involvement of Labour back benchers
in plans for a parliamentary Lib-Lab discussion group.
''It doesn't trouble me at all; it's sensible,'' he said.
He appeared relaxed about co-operating with the Liberal Democrats in
government, saying: ''The most important thing is that we have a
government that doesn't just say 'We're the masters now, things have
changed', but is deliberately trying to change the politics of the
country.
''That requires working to achieve the broadest possible consent.''
Dismissing critics who claimed his emphasis on responsibility was a
ploy to win support from middle-class voters, Mr Blair was scathing
about the refusal of those on the hard left to embrace his approach.
THE Labour leader yesterday urged the largest party affiliate the
Transport and General Workers' Union to support his Clause 4 reforms
after an opinion poll showed its members backed him by a margin of two
to one, (writes Roy Rogers, Industrial Correspondent).
The union's national executive opposes Mr Blair's plans to re-write
the clause which commits Labour to wholesale nationalisation.
However, the findings by Mori for the Today newspaper, increased
pressure on the union delegation which meets immmediately before the
special party conference in London today and could yet reconsider.
Mr Bill Morris is facing a stiff challenge for the leadership of the
union from Blair loyalist Mr Jack Dromey, who claimed the findings
showed that the union's executive was out of step with the rank and
file.
One in five of the 380 union members contacted in the telephone poll
said they were not even aware of the modernisation debate, prompting
national secretary Mr Dromey to complain: ''The voice of each individual
member should have been heard. The union should have balloted all of
them.''
Even if denied the TGWU's 14% vote Mr Blair looks certain to romp to
victory after securing the support of other key trade unions and
widespread support among constituency parties. However, he said
yesterday: ''I hope very much they (the TGWU) decide to back it.
''The fact is that the members of the Labour Party, where they have
been asked what their views are, have voted overwhelmingly for change
because the Labour Party is a different and changed political party
today.''

WHISKY firm Allied Distillers yesterday announced plans to reduce its
workforce by 200 and introduce more flexible working practices.
The company, which is the world's second largest producer of whisky,
employs more than 1900 staff at 21 sites in Scotland, the majority at
its blending and bottling plants in Dumbarton.
Its portfolio includes Ballantine's, Teacher's, Long John, and
Laphroaig. It also bottles products for sister companies within the
Allied Domecq group.
Company officials said it was hoped all of the redundancies would be
achieved over the next 12 months, through voluntary means and natural
wastage.
Managing director, Mr Andrew Dewar-Durie, said the need for ''far
reaching'' change was dictated by the state of the whisky industry
across the world.
He said: ''The continued pressures on the global whisky market, which
has been flat since 1990, remains a real concern. These pressures are,
of course, felt by our competitors, most of whom are in the process of
re-organising and restructuring.''
He said: ''We are seeking to develop a partnership with employees
through a process of open communication, which will include the creation
of an employees' forum, skills development, and a programme to involve
employees in the decision-making process.''
Strathclyde West Euro-MP, Mr Hugh McMahon, said he was ''extremely
perturbed'' at the announcement. He had discussed the matter with the
main union at Allied, the GMB, and was seeking an urgent meeting with
the firm.

TIME is running out for women who want to claim cash for sex
discrimination on the grounds that they were discharged from the armed
forces because they became pregnant.
They have until ''close of business'' today to lodge their complaints
against the Ministry of Defence.
The deadline comes as a result of new Government legislation.
Already the cost of claims against the armed services has run into
several million pounds, with industrial tribunal hearings still going on
throughout the country.
Most claims relate to women forced to leave because they were pregnant
but there have been a few from women seeking damages because they claim
they were forced to have an abortion to remain in service.

THE areas of greatest wildlife significance in Britain lie in Scotland
yet its share of public money for environmental support is falling as it
rises dramatically in England and Wales.
Mr Stuart Housden, Scottish director of the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds, has criticised the situation.
He blames the Scottish Office for the fact that crofters are being
paid ''peanuts'' to change their work practices while farmers in the
south of England can be paid tens of thousands of pounds for wildlife
conservation.
Mr Housden was in Inverness yesterday to launch, with the Scottish
Crofters Union, their joint blueprint for supporting a prosperous
population in the Highlands and Islands while enhancing the area's
natural environment.
Mr Housden said: ''There is a UK budget for the Environmentally
Sensitive Areas scheme and the share coming to Scotland is going down
proportionate to what is happening in England and Wales, where it is
rocketing up.
''We are pouring money into areas which are of far less importance
than what we have up here.
''Not only is the Scottish Office not fighting its corner effectively,
they are actually putting in artificial constraints which prevent the
schemes being as widely available and as useful as they are south of the
Border.''
He pointed out that farmers in England and Wales were paid by the
hectare for conservation of protected species, such as the redshank,
while there was a ceiling on payments to crofters of between #4000 and
#6000 to help safeguard the much rarer corncrake, requiring radical
change in work practices.
0 Mr Housden said he was happy that the RSPB was now working with the
SCU on projects such as their joint report, Rural Development and the
Environment, published yesterday.
Mr Alistair MacIver, the SCU's acting president, admitted they still
did not see eye-to-eye on every issue but had worked well together on a
difficult subject: ''The most important element of Rural Development and
the Environment is the explicit recognition that people have a pivotal
role to play in the Highlands and Islands.''

THOUSANDS of victims of lung cancer brought on by exposure to asbestos
may have been deprived of compensation because of misdiagnosis, doctors
say today.
The criterion used to implicate asbestos -- fibrosis (thickening) of
the lung tissue or lining -- overlooks many cases in which this is not
visible on X-ray, according to a report in the Lancet.
The new evidence comes from a study led by Professor Corbett McDonald
from the National Heart and Lung Institute in London on the X-rays of
271 confirmed lung cancer patients and comparing them with controls.
They found that those who had definite or probable exposure to
asbestos at least 15 years previously (the minimum latency period) had
an increased risk of lung cancer; using the scoring system for measuring
small lung shadows they found that those who met the threshold score had
double the risk of those with no exposure history; those who didn't
nevertheless had a 56% higher risk.
Professor McDonald said: ''The study indicates that asbestos exposures
which do not cause small opacities on the chest radiograph may none
theless increase the risk of lung cancer.''
Mr Tam Campbell, a researcher with Clydeside Action on Asbestos, said:
''This report supports our belief that asbestos exposure should in
itself be an indication for asbestos-related lung cancer but doctors
aren't looking for it hard enough, especially if the patient smoked.''

A PORTRAIT of film director Bill Forsyth by his friend, artist Steven
Campbell, was unveiled at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in
Edinburgh yesterday. It is believed the commission cost around #16,000.
The painting of Mr Forsyth is the latest in a long line of
commissioned paintings of contemporary Scottish personalities on show at
the gallery. Others include footballer Danny McGrain, musician Sir
Alexander Gibson, and miners' leader Mick McGahey.
Mr Duncan Thomson, Keeper of the Portrait Gallery, said he was
delighted with its latest acquisition.
Mr Forsyth first met Mr Campbell 10 years ago in New York and they
have remained friends and fishing companions.
Mr Campbell said he was approached to produce a picture of a famous
Scottish person and because ''Bill is the only famous person I know and
a pal'' he decided to do him.
The portrait is the centre-piece of the gallery exhibition, titled
Being Human, after Mr Forsyth's last film, which featured Hollywood
superstar Robin Williams. The painting features Mr Forsyth and his two
children Sam, 10, and Doone, eight.

<HEADLINE>Forged titles fooled rich Americans Buyers of bogus 'lordships' promised exclusive rights to socialise with the Queen</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

WEALTHY Americans were duped by two conmen into buying forged manorial
titles that promised such exclusive rights as a priority on the Queen's
''social list'', a court heard yesterday.
Another totally fictitious royal benefit offered to a holder of one
particular Domesday Book lordship of the manor was the opportunity to
ride in the 18th carriage of the Queen Mother's birthday procession.
Southwark Crown Court was told that #85,000 was paid into overseas
bank accounts by unsuspecting buyers. The biggest losers were Florida
couple Ron and Peggy Berle, who forked out more than $63,000 for a
number of titles they had bought as an investment for their Down's
syndrome child.
Mr Stephen Waine, prosecuting, said travel company director Stefanos
Kollakis and co-conspirator Martin Lewis went to great lengths to
convince their victims the transactions were genuine.
The various layers of deception they used included false names and
passports, bogus companies -- one with a Latin motto meaning ''virtue is
the way'' -- a non-existent set-up called the Institution of Heraldic
Affairs, and a firm of solicitors.
Kollakis, 26, of Hillcroft Crescent, Ealing, west London, and Lewis,
also 26, of Woodmanstone Road, Carshalton Beeches, Surrey, pleaded
guilty to a conspiracy to commit forgery.
The charge detailed the various false documents drawn up by the pair.
They included conveyances of honorary titles, certificates and histories
for them, sale guarantees of purchases, coats of arms, and letters from
the National Office of Heraldry.
Mr Waine said: ''It was a simple scheme, in the sense that it worked
on the basis that there are in England titles that can be bought and
sold and that there are people outside England who don't have such
titles but who have the money to buy them.''
He said 13,000 lordship of the manor titles existed altogether, most
dating back to 1086 and listed in the Domesday Book.
The barrister said the two swindlers even ''resurrected'' an ancient
process called sub-infudation, a system of splitting and increasing the
number of titles available which was actually outlawed in 1290.
Among titles the two claimed they had the right to sell were the
lordships of Bodardle in Cornwall; Godington, Oxfordshire; Glodwick,
Lancashire; Ellesmere, Shropshire, and Breckenthwaite in Cumbria.
Among the most exciting sweeteners -- sold in a title to American
attorney Jeffrey Schnepper -- were promises to be given priority on
''Her Majesty the Queen's social list'', and the opportunity of
attending various royal functions.
In addition, he was told he could look forward to the right to attire
himself with ''heraldic robes of nobility''.
Another promised he could occupy the 18th carriage in the Queen
Mother's birthday celebration procession.
The two men advertised the titles in a variety of publications,
including the Wall Street Journal, magazines called Her Majesty and
Barons, and The Economist. They frequently flew abroad on Concorde to
meet potential victims and entertain them over lunch.
Mr Waine said the two men's activities were finally brought to a halt
when Dubhai journalist Lyn Jeffs and her husband Paul answered one of
their advertisements in an English speaking newspaper.
Mrs Jeffs realised the material they received was ''sham'' and decided
she could be on to a good story. She contacted Kollakis, who later flew
out to see her. The couple strung him along as they were given further
details about the Lordship of Hesketh, priced at more than #12,000.
At about the same time, Dr Simpson became suspicious with what he had
bought and after vainly demanding his money back, tracked Kollakis to
his home.
Dr Simpson grabbed Kollakis's passport but, while he brandished it
outside the house, police arrived amid accusations that he was guilty of
theft.
Mr Waine added Lewis was jailed for 12 months at Peterborough Crown
Court in 1993 after being found guilty of obtaining false passports with
a view to selling them to Hong Kong businessmen.
Judge Geoffrey Levy QC then adjourned sentencing until May 19 so
social inquiry reports could be prepared and police could make further
inquiries into the men's assets and the question of compensation. Their
bail was continued.
Outside court, Detective Sergeant Paul Phillipson confirmed that
Kollakis was the nephew of shipping magnate Lou Kollakis, who has been
described as one of the most powerful and secretive tycoons in the
world, with a fortune worth up to #250m.

SPANISH police last night arrested a 27-year-old Scot in connection
with the death of a Spanish man in a street fight at the resort of
Sitges, south of Barcelona.
Mr Robert Drummond, from Dumfries is being held in Barcelona's main
prison charged with killing Spaniard, Fernando Carbonnel, at the
weekend.
Police said Mr Carbonnel was left lying on the pavement with fatal
head wounds and died in hospital.
At first, the alleged killer was said to be an American. However,
police later confirmed they were looking for a Scot after the
authorities in Barcelona contacted British consular officials and
Scottish police.
A police spokesman said: ''We now believe that this man is Robert
Drummond. But he was using several aliases and false identity papers.
The spokesman said two men, a father and son from Manchester, had also
been remanded in prison after the alleged street attack. The two were
named as Mr Stanley Teasdale, 64, and his son, Russell, 29.

A FORMER Glasgow University student yesterday claimed that his teeth
were broken by police during an alleged racial attack.
Mr Mohammed Aamer Anwar, 27, is suing Strathclyde Chief Constable, Mr
Leslie Sharp, for #15,000, claiming he was the victim of a racial
attack.
It is believed to be the first case of its kind in Scotland and has
taken three-and-a-half-years to get to court.
Mr Anwar said he had to drink through a straw and suffered nightmares
after the alleged attack in November, l991.
He denied a suggestion by Mr Charles Hennessey, the solicitor acting
for the chief constable, that he was injured in a fall while fleeing
from police.
Mr Anwar, now unemployed, told Glasgow Sheriff Court that he was
caught fly-posting in Ashton Lane, Hillhead, near the university.
Earlier, he had been part of a students' demonstration which had
occupied an area of the university, including the principal's office.
He claimed someone had shouted ''police'' and he and four other
students ran down the lane.
He was carrying posters and a paste can when, he claimed, he felt a
blow on his back and he was knocked face down.
Mr Anwar told Sheriff George Evans: ''My head was pulled up and my
face slammed down on the ground. My teeth were chipped. ''Again my face
was slammed onto the ground. I felt my teeth being smashed.''
Mr Anwar, who gave his address as care of his Glasgow's solicitor's
office, claimed he was dragged by a policeman and a policewoman back
down the lane and kicked.
He told his lawyer, Mr Tony McGrade, that police threatened him with
more violence unless he gave them the names of other students who had
been fly-posting with him.
Mr Anwar said: ''I was crying. I kept asking them why they had done
this to me and I called for help from passers by.
''The police told me that if I didn't give them the names they would
take me to the cells and give me a proper going over.''
He was taken by ambulance to the city's Western Infirmary for
treatment.
His limbs were bruised in the alleged incident and he now has to wear
false teeth.
Mathematics teacher, Mr Mark Davidson, 24, of Kent Road, Charing
Cross, Glasgow, told the court he was a Glasgow University student at
the time of the alleged attack and was on his way home through the lane.
He said he saw a figure lying crouched on the road, whom he now knew
as Mr Anwar.
He claimed a policeman kicked Mr Anwar, who asked him: ''Why did you
kick me? Why did you do it, why did you beat me up?''
Mr Davidson said there was also a policewoman nearby.
He told the court: ''My impression was the police officer was taunting
him, almost leering at him.
''I could tell this from his facial expressions and body movements.''
He added: ''It was quite horrific to see the policeman kick someone on
the ground. Police are there to protect you.''
The hearing continues.

TRUST managers from Law Hospital in Lanarkshire will play host to
about 75 finance, construction, and management companies next week in
the latest step towards private sector participation in the NHS.
Preparations for the get-together in an Edinburgh hotel next Thursday
were under way yesterday as health unions reacted angrily to the
proposals by Grampian Health Board to throw hospital services in
Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, open to market testing.
The health union, Unison, claimed the introduction of private sector
involvement was bringing privatisation closer and with it the
possibility of patients having to pay for treatment.
The move means the existing Grampian Healthcare Trust and its staff
will have to compete with private sector companies for the provision of
services they already provide.
What is being proposed for Law does not go as far down that road --
the existing trust itself is being left to invite tenders for the
construction, lease-back, and management of the replacement hospital for
Law on a site already earmarked at Netherton, near Wishaw. The trust
would continue to be responsible for all clinical services and employ
the doctors, nurses and paramedics.
The Stonehaven hospitals are served by doctors based at Aberdeen and
local GPs, but other clinical services are expected to be provided by
the successful bidder -- whether in-house from Grampian Healthcare, or
from the private sector.
Last night, Grampian MP and Scottish Office Minister George Kynoch was
condemned for his remarks that the proposals were simply to ensure that
the local people received the best possible health care.
''What does he think that does for the present nursing staff who are
giving care at the moment,'' said Mr Gordon Wenham, of the Aberdeen
office of the Royal College of Nursing.
Mr Wenham said he was deeply concerned about the proposal and that
while they were used to developments involving the private sector for
the care of the elderly, there were also an accident and emergency unit
and GP beds at the hospitals in Stonehaven under debate.
Mr Ken Thomson, chief executive at Law Hospital, said next week's
meeting was to give companies likely to be interested information on
what would be expected.
''We are expecting finance companies, construction companies, and
facilities management companies on equal measure to come forward, and it
is quite likely you will get some of them forming consortia to put in
tenders,'' he said.
The aim is to provide a new district general hospital by 1999 to
replace Law, most of which -- apart from the three-year-old maternity
unit -- is an encampment of huts built in 1940 to cater for troops; it
was intended at the time to have a working life of three to four years.
The new hospital is to have 500 beds and, at current prices, the
current budget is #70m capital cost and about #45m in annual running
costs.
The current staff is 2050, mostly doctors, nurses, laboratory workers,
and paramedics, who would remain employed by the trust.
''About 300 cleaning, catering, portering, and maintenace staff would
transfer to the new employers with their conditions employed by the TUPE
regulations,'' said Mr Thomson.
However the health committee of the public sector union Unison
yesterday decided to seek a joint approach with Shadow Scottish
Secretary George Robertson and Mr John McAllion, the shadow Scottish
health spokesman, to challenge Mr Ian Lang on the proposals, pointing
out that the Government's plans for the NHS have already been rebuffed
by the public.
''We are appalled at what is going on and astonished that they haven't
got the message from the opinion polls and the locals election
results,'' said Unison regional organiser Jim Devine.
Last autumn, following an extensive consultation procedure, a variety
of options were considered by a working group and Grampian Health Care,
proposed to the health board that Woodcot hospital, a former workhouse,
and Arduthie hospital, a former fever hospital, be replaced by a single
new hospital on the Arduthie site.
The board subsequently made that recommendation to the Scottish Office
but this week the board were told to invite open competition for the
future provision of hospital services.
Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, the Scottish Health Minister, said last
night: ''The new hospital can be financed either conventionally through
the NHS or from other sources possibly involving the private sector. It
is important all funding options are fully explored. The Chancellor of
the Exchequer has said publicly, in his November 1994 statement, that no
public sector capital projects will be approved unless the scope for
involving the private sector has been fully explored.
''The outcome of this exercise may be that the new hospital will have
to be conventionally funded but if that is the case then it would have
to take its place in the queue for central resources.''
Local GP Dr Graham McIntosh, who was a member of the option-appraisal
group said he was surprised at the reaction to the announcement. His
initial reaction had been that it was an opportunity to improve services
in Stonehaven.
Grampian local health council are to convene a meeting as soon as
possible to discuss the implications of the proposals.

PRESSURE on the Government to concede 3% pay rises to all 600,000 NHS
nurses increased dramatically yesterday as the Royal College of Nursing
moved to ditch its historic no-strike rule.
The RCN's ruling council decided it wanted to see the no-strike clause
in its constitution replaced with one allowing for limited action.
Nurses, angered by the Government's 1% national pay rise with local
top-ups, are now set to be balloted on the change which marks a reversal
in policy. The health service union Unison also said its 240,000 nurses
were strongly rejecting the deal and an industrial action ballot was
likely to be held later next month.
Despite these moves, the Government appeared to be standing firm. In
the Commons, Mr Major said the nurses had seen their pay rise by 78%
over the last six years ''twice as fast as in the economy as a whole''.
Labour leader Tony Blair demanded: ''Is not the effect of Government
policy on the health service now to pit nurse against nurse, hospital
against hospital, doctor against doctor? Divide and rule,
commercialising it, demoralising it, breaking it up, when people want to
see the NHS run as a proper national service for the people.''
Mr Major retorted that no Government had funded the NHS as well as the
current Tory administration. He said: ''Can you explain whether it is
fair or unfair that nurses pay has risen by an average of 78% in the
last six years, twice as fast as the economy as a whole.
''Under the period of the last Labour Government, nurses' pay actually
fell. It did not even maintain its value. The nurses have what they have
always sought -- an independent pay review body that is independent.''
The Prime Minister said that ''a great many'' nurses had accepted
local pay settlements.
His comments drew a furious response from Unison, which claimed no
nurse had accepted a settlement. Mr Bob Abberley, its head of health,
said Mr Major's claims were ''grossly misleading and just plain wrong''.
The RCN's ruling council, meanwhile, decided on an emergency motion
which, if adopted by the union's annual conference next month, would be
followed by a ballot of members, two thirds of whom would be required to
endorse a new rule sanctioning action as long as it does not harm
patients.
This would change the union's constitution but there would still need
to be an industrial action ballot before any action could actually be
taken.
This would aim to hit NHS trusts: moves being considered includes
sanctions targeting administrative work crucial to financial management.
Ms Christine Hancock, RCN general secretary, described the unanimous
decision by the 25-member council as a ''very serious moment in the
history of this organisation''.
Nurses were furious at the way they have been treated by the
Government which had given them a 1% pay rise nationally with more
supposedly on offer locally, although only about one third of the 520
trusts have made offers.
The issue is particularly acute in Scotland, where only one third of
the 27 NHS trusts have made local offers and only one, North Ayrshire,
has offered the full 3% without ''strings''.
The tardiness of Scottish NHS trusts in making local offers was
virtually conceded in a circular sent out by Mr M R Sibbald, director of
human resources for the NHS in Scotland, stressing that they should be
in a position to make local offers ''and we encourage you to do so''.
Ms Pat McManus, chair of RCN's Scottish board, raised this issue at
yesterday's council meeting and successfully argued that, in the
interest of solidarity, no 3% ''no strings'' offers should be accepted
unless or until they are widely available.
Ms McManus, who works at Hawick Health Centre, was strongly supported
by the other Scottish member of the council, Mr Eddie Kelly from
Larbert, who is a care manager at the Royal Scottish National Hospital
and Community Trust.
Yesterday's move by the RCN follows a decision last month by the
112-year-old Royal College of Midwives to end its policy of no
industrial action. A similar move is expected today from the Community
and District Nurses Association.
Ms Hancock stressed there was no question of nurses taking any action
that would hit patient care: ''We will never harm patients. We will
never take action which will put them at risk. That doesn't mean we
don't want to hurt nurses' employers.''
Responsibility for yesterday's historic decision lay with Health
Secretary Virginia Bottomley, who has refused to listen to nurses, Ms
Hancock added.
Meanwhile, Mr Abberley welcomed the RCN decision: ''It has always been
clear that only by having the ultimate sanction of industrial action can
stubborn employers and the Government be shifted.
''Unison's 240,000 nurses have shown over the years that it is
possible to take effective industrial action without harming patients.
''The RCN decision confirms Unison's view about the growing anger
among nurses and health staff about the 1% pay offer and local pay. It
will strengthen the campaign for NHS pay justice.''
However, Mr Ken Jarrold, NHS director of human resources, said
industrial action had ''no place'' in the health service and warned that
even ''limited'' action could dislocate services and disrupt patient
care.
Mr Jarrold revealed that he too he had written to all trusts urging
them to make offers ''without delay''.
''It is local negotiation, not industrial action, that will work for
staff and ensure that services to patients continue to improve,'' he
added.

A SCOTTISH war hero who shot down a Japanese kamikaze plane as it
attacked a merchant cruiser with 1500 officers and Lord Mountbatten on
board has finally received his war medals.
Mr Edward Dickson, 68, who is originally from Coatbridge and now lives
on the Isle of Wight, almost certainly saved the ship, the RMS Arundel
Castle, and the lives of its 150 crewmen and the 1350 returning Royal
Australian Air Force officers.
He was Lord Mountbatten's steward on board the cruiser at the time of
the incident, which happened near Tahiti in the Pacific Ocean in 1944 as
the ship was taking the Anzac crewmen from Liverpool to Sydney,
Australia and Wellington in New Zealand.
As a result of his bravery -- he suffered both physical and mental
wounds -- Mr Dickson spent 38 years in Hartwood Hill Hospital in Shotts,
Lanarkshire, but is now looking forward to displaying his four medals as
part of the VE day celebrations next month.
Steward/Gunner Dickson was just 17 when his heroism manning an
Oerlikon gun helped repel a sea and air attack. ''This kamikaze plane
was coming straight towards us and it was a case of him or me, and
luckily I shot him down,'' said Mr Dickson.
But the gunner suffered a severed artery, serious internal bleeding,
and complications which eventually led to him being admitted to hospital
on a long-term basis.
''But in 1978 a marvellous specialist called Dr Caroline Mitchell was
able to finally help me, and with newly-devised treatments and
occupational therapy I was allowed out,'' Mr Dickson said.
Now wheelchair-bound, Mr Dickson lives with his wife Barbara in
retirement in Ryde on the Isle of Wight. He was amazed when recently,
after a 50-year wait, his war medals came through the post.
He received an Atlantic Star, Italy Star, Pacific Star, and 1939-1945
Star.
''Now I can really wear them with pride for the VE Day celebrations,
and at the Merchant Navy reunion I have been invited to at Portsmouth in
September.''
Mr Dickson married for the first time last March.

VILLAGERS in Ayrshire have been told to settle bills or make insurance
claims for damage caused by flooding in the gas mains.
Now their MP and councillor are asking British Gas to re-consider and
give those affected compensation.
Large parts of the village of Coylton were without gas supplies for up
to a week when pipes were flooded after the mains water supply ruptured.
Although water and gas supplies are both now restored, many people had
to call in plumbers and heating engineers to inspect appliances and
heating systems.
Now they have been told that British Gas will not accept liability for
any damage and that any work its engineers do will be charged at the
full rate.
The news has angered Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and
Doon Valley, and Councillor Agnes Davies, who lives in the village and
represents it on Kyle and Carrick District Council.
Mr Foulkes is awaiting a response to a strongly worded letter to
British Gas chairman Mr Richard Giordano, in which he is critical of the
original incident, the standard of roads and paths after work was
completed, and the insistence that householders should meet bills.
Mr Foulkes said: ''I think it is outrageous that a company which is
making millions of pounds every day should turn round and insist that
people should pay for repairs when any damage caused was not their fault
in any way.''
The last figures recorded for British Gas show the company made annual
profits of #1245m.
Councillor Davies added: ''I cannot for the life of me see why the
people of Coylton should have to stump up or go cap in hand to their
insurers for something over which they had no control and for which they
have no responsibility.
''I will support George Foulkes in every way possible in his campaign
to win compensation for local people and for this daft insistence on
paying up to be changed.''
A spokesman for British Gas said it was in dispute with Strathclyde
region, the water authority, over liability, a situation confirmed by Mr
Bill Gow, depute director of Strathclyde region's water department.
Mr Gow said: ''I can understand and sympathise with the concerns of
the people of Coylton. Unfortunately, if we accept liability, it would
set a precedent for all other cases of this kind.''

STAGECOACH, the Perth-based bus giant, was yesterday ordered by the
Government to sell its 20% stake in Glasgow-based Strathclyde Buses on
public interest grounds.
The Department of Trade and Industry decision is the second major blow
to Stagecoach's aggressive expansion strategy in as many months -- with
the bus group recently having been instructed to divest its 20% holding
in the Mainline Partnership bus group in South Yorkshire.
A separate competition ruling, also issued yesterday, cleared the
#11.1m acquisition in October of Kelvin Central by Strathclyde Buses
group SB Holdings.
The latest setback for Stagecoach came on the same day as the company
was criticised in a BBC Scotland programme for its ''aggressive
tactics'' in tackling opposition.
The makers of Frontline Scotland claimed the Stagecoach directors had
refused to be interviewed for the programme. However, a Stagecoach
spokesman said while the directors had no comment to make about the
film, they had instead taken out full-page adverts in the national press
today in response to the documentary.
The advert criticises the BBC for methods used in making of the
programme, which Stagecoach believes demean a highly successful company.
The advert claims to be ''taking the high road'' while the BBC had
chosen to ''take the low road''. It highlights the company's 15 years of
achievement and says it did not take part in the documentary because the
producers' methods were ''questionable'' and one of the participants was
''expressing a biased view''.
Last night, Labour's Shadow Transport Minister, Mr Henry McLeish, said
companies like Stagecoach, which has been referred more than 20 times,
were continuing to treat the Office of Fair Trading with contempt, and
he called for an inquiry.
Corporate Affairs Minister Jonathan Evans has asked the Director
General of Fair Trading to seek undertakings which will prevent
Stagecoach entering into any future agreement which inhibits it from
competing with SBH.
Following its acquisition of Kelvin, SBH became the largest bus
operator in and around Glasgow, with more than two-thirds of the market
in several districts.
The presence in neighbouring areas of three national operators, each
larger than SBH, was the main factor, in the eyes of the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, which constrained any attempt by the enlarged group
to abuse its strong position.
Stagecoach, which owns Western Scottish, is one of the national
operators with a strong presence in and around Glasgow. The other two
are British Bus, which owns Clydeside 2000, and Aberdeen-based GRT, the
parent company of Midland Bluebird.
Edinburgh-based broker Bell Lawrie White believed the ruling was as
much a rap on the knuckles for the industry as a whole as for
Stagecoach.
Stagecoach, which was also ordered to give up its seat on the SBH
board, yesterday insisted there would be no change in its fundamental
strategy.
Company secretary Keith Cochrane said: ''I think you have got to bear
in mind that Stagecoach still has only 12% of the market share and there
are still a lot of opportunities out there.''

PRINCE Charles may be on course to abandon his beloved peak of
Lochnagar . . . for the more lowly heights of nearby Bennachie.
After opening a #400,000 visitor centre yesterday on the popular
hillwalking spot, the Prince was invited to become a Bailie of
Bennachie.
The bailies are the elite band of men who look after the conservation
and history of the distinctive 1700ft hill, which offers panoramic views
over the rolling Aberdeenshire countryside. The invitation to join them
was made by their chairman, Mr James MacKay.
The Prince, who immortalised 3700ft Lochnagar -- which provides the
backdrop for Balmoral -- in a children's story, carried out a number of
engagements in the Inverurie area yesterday, including opening the #1.5m
Garioch Sports Centre.
It was confirmed last night by his office that the Prince is to make
his first official visit to the Irish Republic in the summer.
It will be the first time in many years that a senior member of the
royal family has paid an official visit to Dublin.

TORY MP Winston Churchill yesterday fiercely defended the use of
#12.5m National Lottery cash to buy his grandfather's papers, and played
down the storm of protest.
He rejected as ''misconceived'' the view that the nation was
purchasing property it already owned: ''One appreciates that people who
do not have the facts at their disposal very often leap to rather
mistaken conclusions.''
He was supported in the Commons by the Prime Minister. Mr Major said
it was necessary to ensure that the collection which, with State papers,
makes up the Churchill archive were kept together in one place.
However, there were reports last night that the deal did not include
the copyright, and that Mr Churchill would therefore be able to benefit
further from the papers.
The MP said that if the trustees had been prepared to allow the
archive to be sold in the world market and be exported abroad, then it
would probably have fetched double the sum: the official valuation was
#25m. ''I think this is probably a very fair deal all round.''
He claimed that in 1946, when Sir Winston arranged for these papers,
of which there are 1.5 million, to be put in trust, it was at a period
in his life when he was ''at a very low point in his personal
finances''.
Mr Churchill said: ''At that moment, he had little more to his name
than the suit he was standing up in, apart from this mountain of papers
covering the first 70 years of his life.
''It was his decision to put these papers in a trust for the benefit
of his male heirs, that is for the descendants of his only son, my late
father, Randolph Churchill.''
It ''was the only thing he had to leave''. Sir Winston, he said, was a
dynast who believed in doing what he could for his family.
He wanted his heirs to benefit from his lifetime's labours, Mr
Churchill said.
He said the collection also included Sir Winston's personal
correspondence up to the end of the war.
''A very important element is the actual drafts of his speeches for
the most part annotated and corrected in his own hand.''
Mr Major also told the Commons that it was Sir Winston himself who had
decreed through his trustees that the papers should go to his
descendants.
He said an assertion by Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Paddy Ashdown,
that Lottery money had been used to purchase papers which were already
the property of the State was wrong. Mr Ashdown said Sir Winston must be
''turning in his grave''.
Mr Major said the decision by the independent National Heritage
Memorial Fund to purchase the personal papers had been followed by a
Government decision to transfer the state papers also to Churchill
college, Cambridge, so that the complete archive should be available to
scholars and the public.
Labour's National Heritage spokesman, Mr Chris Smith, said in a
statement: ''I am sorry that the present Churchill family did not feel
able to follow the example of Churchill's widow, who made a gift of all
her husband's post-war papers after his death.''
He called on the Government to appoint a panel of historians and legal
experts to determine exactly which of the papers were State property and
which were personal.
Mr David Mellor, a former National Heritage Secretary, told ITN that
it could appear as if ''there has been this transfer of money apparently
from the have-nots to the haves''.
Mr Martin Sime, director of the Scottish Council for Voluntary
Organisations, questioned whether the Churchill family was an
appropriate destination for the funds while charities were suffering.
''It is poorer people that are buying lottery tickets and this money is
being redistributed to rich families.''

UNIONS last night pledged that the fight to save Rolls-Royce's East
Kilbride plant would continue after dismissing a management peace bid as
contemptible.
They also warned that an all-out, indefinite strike will begin by
Tuesday at the latest, if management carries out earlier threats of 25
compulsory redundancies from Sunday.
The company yesterday altered its position on a number of issues after
staff voted unanimously earlier this week to escalate industrial action.
In exchange for ''full co-operation'' in transferring the engineering
and design centre's work to Derby and Bristol, management offered to put
the transfer timetable back from June to September.
Other changes include reinstating enhanced redundancy terms and adding
a one-off payment of #1500. The firm also promised to defer compulsory
redundancies until mid-May.

SOME of the most spectacular art treasures in Scotland -- religious
murals completed by artist Phoebe Traquair -- will be saved following
intervention by Edinburgh District Council's planning committee.
The murals in Mansfield Place Church in the city's Broughton area are
in need of emergency conservation work and their fate has been in the
balance for years, because the church is disused.
The artist, who was born in Dublin in 1852 but lived in Edinburgh
until her death in 1936, took seven years to complete the murals.
They include a spectacular host of saints, angels, elders, and wise
and foolish virgins rendered in blue, crimson, and gold, and are
considered treasures from a flourishing arts revival in Edinburgh at the
turn of the century.
In the winter of 1992-93, the council spent #16,000 on emergency work
to make the building wind and water tight and, a year later, approved
#3000 for a survey on the murals' conservation.
Earlier this year, the council agreed to spend a further #5000 towards
a feasibility study into the future use of the church.
After the committee had been told that extensive areas were already
lost due to water staining and the instability of plasterwork, a report
recommended that, as an emergency measure, paper could be used to
''bandage'' the murals to the walls on which they are painted.
It recommended spending #8831 to carry out the programme.
