THE celebrations all were in the North-east on Saturday, with Forfar
being presented with the championship trophy after their 4-1 home win
over Arbroath, and Angus neighbours Montrose clinching the second
promotion place by winning 4-0 at Cowdenbeath while Ross County were
losing the Highland derby 3-0 at Inverness. The Forfar party was watched
by a crowd of more than 1000. Sandy Ross's opener was quickly followed
on the half-hour by an Alan Morgan counter, with David Bingham hitting
goals on either side of the interval. Steve Florence got a late
consolation for Arbroath. Next week it will be Alloa's turn to visit
Station Park and to try to stop the champions from totalling 80 points.
Veteran Colin McGlashan set Montrose up by scoring after only six
minutes against Cowden, one of his former clubs, and their task was made
easier with the sending-off of David Fellenger in the first half. The
other half of Montrose's scoring act, Alan Kennedy, came on as
substitute and proceeded to hit a second-half hat trick.
East Stirlingshire and Alloa, erstwhile contenders, may have been
thinking of what might have been in their 1-1 draw at Firs Park. Peter
Dwyer opened for 'Shire and Danny Diver levelled against one of his
former teams.
Little Gary Orr struck early for Queen's Park at Coatbridge and
substitute Brian McPhee struck 15 minutes from time. Rovers' misery is
not yet complete, however, as they must visit jubilant Montrose next
week.

Partick Thistle 0, Falkirk 0
JUST about everything John Lambie says comes out passionately, but
when the Partick Thistle manager had finished analysing the third season
in succession that he and his team had defied the premier-division
guillotine, he expressed a desire for change which clearly was deeply
felt.
''I would not like to go into a fourth season the way we went into the
last three,'' he said, ''and we have to try to get a bit more quality
here.''
The manager who defied all previous form by becoming the first to
steer his team away from relegation after being bottom of the table at
the turn of the year, might be able to face up to another season of
constant running uphill, but he is not sure the Maryhill faithful can
take any more.
''Maybe I need to take the valium, but what kind of state must the
guys who pay their money on the terracings be in?''
Lambie, as a director of the club, knows the financial restraints at
Firhill and admitted that there is no multi-millionaire spender
available on the board. Yet he still believes something has to be done.
''We can't go on doing this. We have to be start thinking positive. If
we had gone down, it would not have been easy to get out of the first
division. If you look at the teams who could be going down, Dundee
United, Hearts, or Aberdeen, you can see how tough it will be.''
Delighted that his players had grasped the single point they needed to
complete one of the finest comebacks of any side in any league, the
manager hopes that now the stadium has been finished, money can be found
for team improvement.
''The chairman has said that, after the stadium was completed, any
cash available would go to buying players, and once we get down to
talking about the future I hope we can find a way to move forward.''
Lambie had only a short interval to discuss the great escape before
going home to change for a Player of the Year dinner at Firhill. Ian
Cameron was the chosen one but, if Lambie had his way, all of them would
have been up on the rostrum.
He must have been given some welcome himself, considering this
down-to-earth, emotional man has performed something close to the
miraculous in his days at Firhill. Thistle were second-bottom of the
first division when he joined the club four seasons ago, but they won
promotion and have hung on ever since.
''Somebody up there likes me,'' he said and then remembered that he
and his players will be tackling serious competition during the summer
when all their rivals will be on holiday.
''We will be starting the Intertoto Cup next month and play right
through until July, but we will treat it is as our pre-season work.
There will be no climbing hills for us this summer.''
By the time that is over they might well have defied all other logic
and won their way into the preliminary round of the UEFA Cup. Nothing is
impossible down Maryhill way.
You might have wondered a bit about such a remark, none the less, if
you had turned up to watch them for the first time on Saturday. They
looked like a team that had been thrown out the dressing-room the way a
debutant parachutist is despatched from a plane.
Thistle did not want the ball, maybe afraid of making a mistake, which
left Falkirk trying to find a way of getting it past a packed defence,
particularly in the second half.
The Brockville side are not used to this tactic, invariably finding
themselves chasing and working to win their share of possession. They
didn't handle the domination too well, although they might have scored
on a few occasions, especially one great chance that fell to Stevie
Kirk, whose header scraped the top of the bar.
Their manager, Jim Jefferies, might have been critical but, after a
season in which his team have climbed from the basement to chasing a
European place, he was not inclined that way. Instead, he made the valid
point that three teams, his own, Thistle, and Kilmarnock, warranted
praise.
''The three of us were touted as relegation bets at the start of the
season. I think the clubs have shown what can be achieved.''
His feelings were echoed by the Partick captain, Albert Craig, who
said: ''When you look at the teams below us you would take their squads
ahead of ours, but we have battling qualities which others don't have.''

Dundee 2, St Johnstone 1
WHETHER or not Dundee succeed in their quest for promotion to the
premier division, manager Jim Duffy's priority is to persuade
goalkeeping hero Michel Pageaud to remain with the club.
The former Valenciennes player made clear his intentions to return to
France even before his wife and two daughters headed home a couple of
months ago. Unfortunately, they have failed to settle on Tayside.
And with his wife expecting another child, the popular 28-year-old
does not want to be parted from his family longer than is necessary.
Pageaud said: ''My family is the most important thing to me, but my
commitment to the club is something I respect as well.
''Dundee allowed me to tell my agent in France to find me a club back
home. So far, he has failed to do so, and if that continues, I will have
to return to Dens Park next season and continue my career in Scotland.''
Player-manager Duffy will accompany Pageaud to France in a bid to
convince his keeper to return to Tayside. Duffy said: ''At the moment I
would say that at best I have a 50-50 chance of succeeding.''
After Pageaud's outstanding contribution to Dundee's vital derby
victory over neighbours St Johnstone on Saturday, Duffy will have the
backing of the entire Dark Blues' support, who watched in admiration as
the keeper made several outstanding saves.
The McDiarmid Park men were pushing for victory after George O'Boyle's
penalty in 79 minutes cancelled out a Jim Hamilton spot-kick for Dundee
17 minutes earlier.
But after Pageaud had denied them with marvellous saves from Gary
McGinnis and Kevin McGowne, Saints were caught by a perfect sucker-punch
from George Shaw in the last minute.
Jim Duffy gambled by sending defenders John McQuillan and Noel Blake
forward and they combined to set up the chance for Shaw to score.
The full points kept alive Dundee's hopes for promotion. Now they must
win again at Stranraer this weekend and hope for a slip from rivals
Raith Rovers (away to Hamilton) or Dunfermline (home to Clydebank).

Ayr United 3, Stranraer 0
ONLY pride was at stake at Somerset Park on Saturday, both sides
already condemned to relegation to the second division. This seemed to
be insufficient incentive for the players, particularly the visitors,
and we were presented with a soulless encounter which sprang to life for
a mere 20 minutes.
The entire first half was played at walking pace, with United totally
dominant.
Indeed, their season-long failure to convert chances was highlighted
midway through the half when Justin Jackson, Brian Bilsland, and Duncan
George all missed golden opportunities in the space of two minutes.
As the half meandered to its conclusion, United broke the deadlock
with a strike of real quality. Centre half John Sharples rolled the ball
forward to Ross Tannock, who had acres of space in midfield. He took a
couple of steps, took aim, and fired home a rocket from 25 yards.
Ayr's lead was extended in 53 minutes when Jackson turned home Simon
Stainrod's corner kick.
With his side now cruising, the player-manager took his chance to
demonstrate what a showman he is with cheeky flicks and back-heels. To
cap it all he scored the third goal himself, direct from a corner kick,
bowed to his crowd, and performed the perfect hand-spring. His routine
complete, he substituted himself. With his departure, the match finished
in the most benign of fashions.
Stainrod can now only look to next season and hope his stay in the
lower divisions is a short one. He knows only too well where his
problems lie. ''If we get John Traynor and Vinnie Moore back, then we
are defensively sound, but up front we're hopeless.''
He also called for more backing from his local council to aid United
off the park. ''A football team can be the focal point of a community. I
want to give the town something to be proud of.''
Citing the example of neighbours Kilmarnock, he said: ''When I first
came to Scotland they were a very poor team, but with the backing
they've had they've been very successful.''
Stranraer manager Alex McAnespie also has his thoughts on next season.
''My directors will be in no doubt that we need three or four new
players for next year, but we will be in the top three.''

Airdrie 0, Hamilton Accies 1
THREE youngsters kicked a ball around within a long throw-in of
Broadwood on Saturday while the big boys huffed and puffed inside the
ground in search of first-division points.
The little guys seemed to be enjoying themselves, arms being thrown up
in glee when goals were scored, eventually going home tired but
apparently content.
The same was not the case after the ball had stopped bouncing inside
the stadium, but the ones in Airdrie's kit had justification for feeling
a touch miffed at full-time.
Picture the scene. John McLelland, making his first-team debut at 18,
is standing 10 metres inside his own half, side on to his goal. He's
excited when the ball comes zooming his way, throws a leg at it, makes
contact only with a shin, and the ball balloons high into the warm air
before being caught by Airdrie keeper John Martin.
The Accies people raise their arms and only then did referee Jim
McGilvray decide something was perhaps amiss and awarded Accies a free
kick, claiming young John had intentionally passed the ball back to his
keeper.
Well, you know what happened next. It was ''Good afternoon, Airdrie,''
as Hamilton substitute Gary Clark scored.
Airdrie manager Alex MacDonald, as ever, was in good form after the
match, but as children or people with a reserved disposition may read
this newspaper, what the little man said cannot be reported in infinite
detail.
''It's very, very (he mentioned the word very, 21 times) disappointing
to go so many games before that bit of skill came out,'' he said
sarcastically.
Of course, Airdrie have the cup final to occupy their thoughts in a
few weeks, and with this in mind MacDonald chose not to select Graham
Hay, Alan Lawrence, and Jimmy Sandison for fear of them gathering more
penalty points, which would rule them out of the Hampden jamboree.
''To see the disappointment in John Davies' face at being ruled out of
the final,'' said the manager, ''I could not have that happen to the
others.'' He then catalogued reasons as to why these men were marked
absent at the weekend.
The pain of missing out will be numbed if Celtic are put in their
place on Saturday fortnight. Then it will be the turn of Airdrie's lot
to throw their arms in the air in merriment, and maybe Saturday's three
youngsters will put their boots to one side that afternoon and take in
the action. It could be well worth it.

Clydebank 2, St Mirren 1
IF THINGS had worked out right it would have been Davie Cooper's
farewell game at Kilbowie. But nothing has been perfect or near it for
Clydebank. There is an air of desolation about the place.
On Saturday, they played without regular spectators or players. They
appeared not to have enough energy left to sell programmes. Yet they
performed a small miracle.
From their weary mood at almost the end of a disheartening campaign
the Bankies scored a rollicking victory. It was a triumph out of
tiredness.
For a start, they seemed to have run out of players. The names of
Eadie, Sweeney, Currie, Flannigan, Lansdowne, and Crawford were missing.
Scott Murdoch was reluctantly taken off injured after the interval and
after he had scored with a penalty.
How the Clydebank bench had expected him to carry on for the second
half emphasised some belief on their part in the impossible. They must
have thought Murdoch is made of the same stern stuff that used to go
into the construction of Jim Fallon.
Although during the interval the stadium clock stopped short never to
go again, the players kept ticking away, improving so palpably it
cheered up the mainly vacant press benches.
Clydebank made it 2-0 with a header by Gary Bowman from a cross by
Steve Kerrigan. Compared with Kerrigan, some of his mates had names so
unfamiliar the team might have been put together by chapping doors
around the park.
They drew much of their strength from the courage and confidence of
goalkeeper Garry Matthews -- what a size he is!
Craig Tomlinson helped with some walloping clearances and hard work.
St Mirren contributed what artful touches there were, especially Ricky
Gillies. Steve Watson volleyed a fine goal. But whatever has ailed
Saints all season continued to ail them.
They might have done better to give an outing to more of their
apprentices as Clydebank were forced to. Gavin Galloway, 16, had a neat
first half, although he gave away the penalty from which Murdoch scored.
Jimmy Bone, the St Mirren manager, created more crowd excitement than
his team by getting a row from the referee. How Mr Bone could have
become so worked up was a mystery. Of course, he may have been
protesting about the stopped clock. Perhaps he only asked if he might
have a programme, please.

RENFREW MP Tommy Graham last night hit back at allegations that he was
involved in paying for Labour Party subscriptions of some elderly women
in the Linwood section of his constituency two years ago so he could
retain a parliamentary seat.
Mr Graham, Labour MP for Renfrew West and Inverclyde, said last night:
''There have been allegations made that I have paid for memberships of
other people. The only memberships I have paid are those I am entitled
to pay -- my wife's and family's.''
He said: ''There is an inquiry and I am confident it will completely
and utterly clear me.'' He added that, under the rules of the inquiry,
he was not at liberty to go into any further details.
A Sunday newspaper claimed that within two months in 1993, membership
of the Linwood branch in Mr Graham's constituency had increased from 57
to 199 following a recruitment drive in pubs and a pensioners' club.
At the time, proposed boundary changes threatened to make Mr Graham's
Renfrew West and Inverclyde seat highly marginal. Linwood was expected
to become part of the adjacent Paisley North constituency and Mr Graham
was considering challenging its sitting Labour MP, Mrs Irene Adams.
Labour party activity has been effectively suspended in the
Renfrewshire constituencies of Renfrew West and Inverclyde, Paisley
North, and Paisley South following allegations of manipulation and
corruption and also of links with FCB Enterprise Security Ltd, a local
security firm which is being investigated by police over allegations of
drug dealing and money laundering in the Ferguslie Park housing scheme.
The Labour Party in Scotland is carrying out an internal inquiry. The
party's secretary, Mr Jack McConnell, said last night he hoped it would
be completed by the end of May.
He said that if the allegations about pensioners' subscriptions being
paid were made to the inquiry, then they would certainly be
investigated.
''If anyone can provide evidence of anyone in the Labour Party in
Britain paying large numbers of memberships for other people, then that
would be contrary to party rules,'' Mr McConnell said.
It is understood the Labour Party in Scotland received a complaint
that the subscriptions of one or two pensioners were paid for but that
the investigation found that while the local Labour Party branch might
have paid for a small number of subscriptions, there was no evidence
that Mr Graham or any other individual was involved.
Mr McConnell said: ''I am confident that the inquiry will deal with
any outstanding matters.''

Raith Rovers 0, Dunfermline 0
YOU'VE heard it often -- the craggy features of game-show Brucie
proclaiming that points mean prizes.
In Dunfermline's case though, goals also could make the difference
this year between languishing yet again in the highly-competitive first
division, or at least making a play-off place against Hearts, Dundee
United, or Aberdeen.
But hold on. Raith Rovers, with one game remaining, are three points
clear of Dunfermline and Dundee. They travel to face Hamilton Accies at
Firhill next week, while Dundee go to relegated Stranraer, and
Dunfermline entertain Clydebank.
A skoosh, as many punters will point out. But there is a horror
scenario as far as Raith are concerned. The Coca-Cola Cup holders, lambs
ready to enter the European arena, are still on a tightrope.
Manager Jimmy Nicholl will not even contemplate the fact that if his
side lose next week, and Dundee and Dunfermline win, the Kirkcaldy side
would end up in third place.
Who said it was a funny old game?
Dunfermline, prolific scorers in the early part of the season,
suddenly have dried up in the goal-taking department, but thanks to the
versatile and mostly unsung Andy Tod -- ''that was a #5000 bargain from
Kelty Juniors and the lad does not get all the credit he deserves,''
according to manager Bert Paton -- skipper Norrie McCathie, and full
backs Jackie McNamara and Derek Fleming, there are few goals going past
keeper Guido van de Kamp, either.
But Paton is worried about the lack of fire-power through injury and
suspension. ''We scored five up here last time, but the scorers Kenny
Ward, Hamish French, and Stewart Petrie all were sitting in the stand
this time,'' he said.
Certainly the facts speak for themselves -- 34 goals in the first 17
games and a total of 61 in 35, including two non-scoring events in the
past couple of weeks as nerves take a hold. But that still has them
eight ahead of Raith and six in front of Dundee.
Paton said after the Stark's Park game: ''I could have written the
script beforehand. Both defences were superb. Our back four have come
through two pressure games, and when the lads up front are not scoring,
it puts the onus on the lads at the back.
''That is our fourth clean sheet in a row.'' But he added wistfully:
''You know, I can't remember when one of our strikers last got a goal.''
Nicholl, the Raith manager, was his usual honest self. ''It was hard
going and definitely not a classic. But the title is still in our own
hands. We are on top because of sheer hard work, and I cannot fault the
players for their efforts. That will stand us in good stead for next
week.''
There's little doubt Raith could have wrapped up the points and taken
the champagne out of the fridge had Jason Dair's ninth-minute volley hit
the back of the net instead of the bar, but as Nicholl also admitted:
''We could easily have lost today.''
Scott Thomson's double save from Tod had a lot to do with that as
Dunfermline tried to use their height to advantage, especially at set
pieces.
Even when they ran on to the park in front of a full-house of 9300,
the Dunfermline players still seemed to dwarf the Raith lads. With both
managers, Jimmy Nicholl and Bert Paton, as well as their assistants,
more out of the dugouts yelling at players than in them, you could have
cut the atmosphere with a knife.
Yet there was calm. Apart from Thomson, that wily old bird David Narey
was as impeccable as ever, greatly helped by his ever-improving young
sidekick, Robbie Raeside, and David Sinclair, who, despite his work-rate
and commitment, occasionally still gives his gaffers -- and fellow
defenders -- palpitations. Keeps the fans on their toes, mind you,
sometimes for all the wrong reasons.
Next Saturday should see dancing in the streets of Raith. Their own
VE-Day if you like. In the Rovers' case, it would be victory and Europe
-- all in one amazing season.

IT WAS high time for a twist in the relegation tale, and for a long
while on Saturday afternoon Norwich City looked likely to provide one.
Stuck in an apparently endless groove of defeat, and written off by just
about everyone with two games to play, they suddenly shocked Leeds
United with a goal utterly against the run of play by Ashley Ward and
sent shudders of alarm coursing through half-a-dozen clubs immediately
above them.
Sadly for Norfolk, a disputed penalty allowed Gary McAllister the
opportunity to equalise and just to rub things in, Carlton Palmer
inflicted a seventh successive defeat on City in the last minute,
ensuring relegation after all. So Norwich return to the lower divisions,
18 months after impressing the whole of Europe with their exploits
against Bayern Munich and Inter Milan.
Injuries have not helped, but the overiding fault has been the ruinous
philosophy of selling good players and buying inferior ones.
Crystal Palace, tipped for some time to accompany them down, allowed
hope to live on with a 1-0 defeat of West Ham, but their two remaining
fixtures offer little prospect of enough points to drag anyone else into
the mire.
They must visit Leeds tomorrow and then Newcastle next Sunday, when
relegation after one season will surely be confirmed.
Whether or not Palace avoid defeat tomorrow, varying degrees of
anxiety will still afflict several other clubs. West Ham, Everton, and
Coventry also have a game in hand but there is only one more fixture for
Aston Villa, who desperately needed Saturday's 2-0 win over Liverpool
(two headers from Dwight Yorke). Villa's good fortune is that they play
at Norwich next Sunday.
Of the others, West Ham have the best goal difference but must meet
Liverpool (Wednesday) and Manchester United (Sunday). Coventry, like
Villa, appeared to have been dragged clear of the quicksand after a new
managerial appointment, only for Ron Atkinson to find his feet sinking
in again. Their 2-0 defeat at Ipswich was an awful result and they may
need to win their last game, at home to the cup finalists Everton, to
avoid dropping out of the top division for the first time since 1967.
Yesterday Tranmere confirmed their place in the first-division
play-offs at the expense of Barnsley. In the two-leg semi-finals, they
will meet Reading while Wolves play Bolton.

Aberdeen 2, Dundee United 1
VETERAN Dundee United defender Jim McInally left Pittodrie after this
game admitting that his team now need a miracle if they are to escape
the drop into the first division.
Few who were at this New Firm derby would disagree with that sad
summing-up as manager Billy Kirkwood saw his side slump to yet another
defeat.
But McInally was quick to stress that the damage to United's cause had
been done long before the disastrous end-of-season run under the new
manager.
He stressed: ''We didn't play with the kind of spirit we showed, at
times, today earlier in the season and that was when the damage was
done.
''We are not in this position simply because of recent results. It
goes back much further. Now we do look as if we need a miracle to
escape. The odds are against us but we have to go out to beat Celtic
next week and then look for other results going in our favour.
''Aberdeen won't have a couple of their players because Billy Dodds
and Peter Hetherston are now suspended, and going to Brockville will be
difficult.
''The playing surface there won't suit Aberdeen so we just have to
hope that things can still go our way.''
That certainly did not happen at Pittodrie. Goals from Dodds and
Duncan Shearer, one in each half, took Aberdeen away from the bottom
spot, where they had been anchored for so long.
The second goal from Shearer was the kind of superbly executed strike
which leaves you wondering just how Aberdeen, with so many good players
available to them, could struggle throughout the season.
Midfielder Hetherston, one of their Saturday successes, had a short,
sharp answer to that question.
''I wasn't playing in the first team often enough,'' he joked.
Then, the laughter over, Hetherston became serious about the team's
plight and about his own role at the club he joined in a transfer deal
last summer.
The midfield man, who will sit out the last-day Brockville clash,
admitted: ''Next week will be the worst 90 minutes of my life. It is not
going to be easy to sit in the stand and watch the game, knowing you
should be out there playing.
''It was going to be my first time back at Brockville since leaving
the club and I was looking forward to it. It has been a very awkward
time for the club.
''I mean, the players here are not used to scuffling at the foot of
the table and trying to fight relegation.
''It has been different for me because that's what I have been used to
in my career. I suffered this kind of battle with Falkirk and with Raith
Rovers. It is something I have been used to.
''The other lads have been more used to playing for prizes at the
other end of the table. That is certainly why I came here in the summer.
I was looking for medals and they have not arrived.
''The other week I met Gordon Dalziel and he pulled his Coca-Cola Cup
winner's medal out of his pocket and said to me: 'You would have had one
of these.'
''He was right. Instead of winning that medal I was trying to get into
the first team, and there was time when I would have left the club,
given the opportunity.
''I was not happy. The manager was not picking me and I thought he was
wrong. I am not having a go at Willie Miller here, because I have a lot
of respect for him, but I disagreed with him leaving me out so often. I
thought I could do a job for the side.
''Hopefully, I have now demonstrated that over the last few matches.
Roy Aitken has helped me a lot. In fact, he has helped all of us a lot.
If you remember Roy as a player and all the enthusiasm he had, then you
have an idea of how he is as a manager. He has retained all of that
enthusiasm and that has rubbed off on all of us in the dressing room.''
That will be needed more than ever at Brockville this coming weekend
when Aberdeen, as Aitken himself admits, must continue the good work of
the past few matches.
Their worry is how they will be affected by the absence of Dodds and
Hetherston, because it has been clear that United have been suffering
from the absence of their own suspended stars, Dave Bowman, Gordan
Petric, Billy McKinlay, and Brian Welsh.
Says manager Kirkwood: ''We have had to hand the job to the youngsters
and that has not helped us at all. The job has proved harder than I
thought it would be, and there is a bit of heartbreak in the dressing
room today. But this will make the good times all the more enjoyable
when they come along.''
One of the youngsters, Robbie Winters, a second-half substitute,
scored their goal five minutes from the end. If they are to survive then
they must move into attack against Celtic much sooner than they did in
this game.
Otherwise it is all over for the team who won promotion more than 30
years ago and have remained in the top division since.

AS AN entourage from Caledonian Thistle descend on Christie Park,
Huntly, tomorrow night, the hosts may have the uncomfortable feeling
they are a club under siege.
The official business in hand is a friendly between the Scottish
League newcomers and a Highland League select.
But moves are afoot to lure Huntly's talented manager Steve Paterson
westwards to the Highland capital to replace departing Sergei Baltacha.
Thistle director Doug McGillivray said: ''Steve is in charge of the
Highland select and we have sought permission to talk to him.''
However, Paterson is content in his social work job, and will have to
be convinced that a full-time post with part-time players is desirable.
Paterson said: ''I am happy to find out what Caley Thistle have to
offer, but it would take something special for me to leave Christie
Park.''
Paterson, without a trace of arrogance, also believes Huntly are
superior to Thistle.
He may be able to demonstrate that point on Tuesday as eight Huntly
men are in the Highland squad.
The match will help the Highland select prepare for a clash with an
English FA select, pencilled in for May 19.
Meanwhile, Fort William and Brora drew in the final Highland League
tie of the season. Fort led through Rankin, but Ross levelled.

OVD Cup finalists Camelon and Whitburn both had convincing victories
on Saturday.
Camelon travelled to Arniston in the Whyte &amp; Mackay Cup and won 2-1 --
David Flynn and Jim Ellis were their scorers.
This win sets them up for a semi-final tie against Hill O'Beath.
In the Pendrich Steeplejack Cup, counters by McPhee, Scott, and an own
goal gave Whitburn a 3-0 win over Fauldhouse United.
A crowd of more than 1000 saw Pollok overcome Beith 3-1 in a Whyte &amp;
Mackay quarter-final replay.
After a dour uncompromising first hour Pollok got the breakthrough in
65 minutes with a headed goal from Sinclair. Grainger added a second
from the penalty spot and despite McCorriston pulling one back in 83
minutes, substitute Willie Wilson scored a third with minutes to go.
Pollok will now meet Kilwinning Rangers in the semi-final.
Arthurlie continued to reduce the gap on Pollok in the Reebok League
by beating Lesmahagow 3-1. There is now a four-point difference, with
Arthurlie having a game in hand.
Relegated Lesmahagow made them fight all the way and it took late
goals from new signing Billy McCafferty and a penalty conversion by
Davie Fulton to pull Arthurlie through.
Dunipace ensured premier-division survival with their 4-0 victory over
Vale of Clyde, but this result means that Rutherglen Glencairn are now
relegated to the first division.
In the Reebok first division, two goals from Scott Gilbertson and a
further strike by Gary Burns gave Kilsyth a 3-0 victory over relegated
Lanark to keep Kilsyth on target for one of the three promotion places.
A goal by Forth Wanderers' Ricky Thomson saw them defeat Vale of Leven
and move clear of the relegation zone.
Cumnock, undefeated in the league this season, became the Western
Stagecoach second-division champions following their 2-1 win over
Muirkirk. A double from Norman Montgomery secured the points.
Glenafton suffered their third defeat in a row since their exit from
the OVD Cup. Depleted by injuries, they went down 6-5 to Maybole on
Saturday.
St Joseph's 5-1 win over Carnoustie saw them overtake Tayport at the
top of the AT&amp;T league.
Stoneywood lifted the GNT Cup following their win over Sunnybank in
Saturday's final but only after coming from behind with two goals in the
last eight minutes from Collins and Leslie. Results:

* REAL Madrid could manage only a 0-0 home draw against Real Sociedad
last night, but remain hot favourites to take the Spanish first division
title.
The result puts Madrid seven points clear of second-placed Deportivo
Coruna -- 1-0 home victors over last year's champions Barcelona
yesterday -- with six games left to play.
Neither the league leaders nor their Basque visitors looked likely to
break the deadlock, despite the presence of the division's two top
scorers -- Madrid's 27-goal Ivan Zamorano and Sociedad's Meho Kodro, who
has hit 21 this term.

SCOTLAND'S Claymores drew just short of beating the Auld Enemy, going
down 11-10 to the London Monarchs in front of 10,481 fans at Murrayfield
yesterday.
The difference between the close rivals was a first-quarter 52-yard
field goal converted for four points by London Monarch's kicker Don
Silvestri.
In the World League a kick of more than 50 yards is awarded four,
rather than three, points and ultimately Silvestri's effort edged London
to the win.
The Scots looked to have buried the ghosts of three defeats in their
past four games when their defence came up with a huge interception at
the start of the second half, which was returned for a touchdown by free
safety George Coghill to give the Claymores a 7-4 lead.
Kicker Arven Czyzewski then put the Scots further ahead at 10-4,
retrieving himself from a dismal spell of kicking by booting a 42-yard
field goal at the start of the fourth quarter.
But the Claymores were left stunned when London quarterback Brad
Johnson fired a 16-yard touchdown pass to receiver Larry Wallace to tie
the scores with less than 10 minutes to go before kicker Silvestri made
no mistake with the extra point to give the 11-10 win.
The Claymores tried to come back with two minutes remaining in the
game but quarterback Matt Blundin's desperate ''Hail Mary'' pass was
intercepted by London safety Edward Buck to finish off the Scots
chances.
The loss was all the more galling for the Claymores, who had played
the better football throughout the day with great running from Siran
Stacy and superb defensive play from the Claymores' defensive backs, led
by the game's Most Valuable player, Jocelyn Borgella.
''That was the most hurtful defeat we have suffered to date,'' said
Claymore's head coach Jim Criner. ''London are our biggest rivals and we
have to live next door to them.''
''We did a good job and were just edged out, but we've got to remember
how well we played and come back for the second of the season.''
Scotland had their chances to defeat London but incomplete passes by
quarterbacks Blundin and Lee Williamson stalled the Claymores' offensive
attack.
Running back Stacy tried to get Scotland moving in the first quarter
but fumbled the ball, giving possession to London at Scotland's 46-yard
line.
Monarchs' running backs Tony Brooks and Phil Bryant pounded out the
yardage for London to set up a 48-yard field goal attempt. However, a
penalty for delay-of-game brought the ball back five yards, setting up
Silvestri for his four-point kick, which he converted with ease.
Quarterback Blundin tried to move the Claymores but was intercepted on
the Scots' next drive by linebacker Dave Hoffmann as he attempted to
find receiver Tim Barnett.
The Claymores had a chance to level the score with their own 50-yard
field goal attempt with five seconds left in the first half, but Allen
DeGraffenreid, stepping in for out-of-form kicker Czyzewski, missed to
end the half 4-0 to the Monarchs.
The Scots got on the scoreboard at the start of the second half. The
kick-off was fumbled by London returner Robert Jackson and linebacker
Tim Brown recovered for the Claymores at the Monarchs' 20.
Matt Blundin's third-down pass to DeGraffenreid flew off the
receiver's hands and he was intercepted in the London end-zone by Kenny
McIntyre.
But Scotland's defence answered back when Borgella picked off Brad
Johnson's first pass and lateralled to George Coghill, who took the ball
in from London's 10-yard line. Allen DeGraffenreid kicked the extra
point.
But despite Czyzewski's excellent field goal to put the Scots three
points up, London made a fourth-quarter comeback to leave the Scots
losers again.

RED tape, small-town politicians with delusions of grandeur, and a
shocking lack of public relations among a group of football directors
have combined to slow Airdrie's progress towards a new stadium on the
outskirts of their Lanarkshire town.
That, plus the Scottish Office announcement at the end of last week
that Strathclyde Region should decide on a planning application rather
than Monkland District, represents one more delay.
It is a nonsense that a club which could be playing in next season's
European Cup-winners' Cup will have to continue without a home for at
least another year.
Also, when Airdrie are finally allowed to send in the builders, the
stadium of their dreams will remain precisely that because, while the
first-division club's ambition to build a new ground was being
obstructed, construction costs continued to rise.
Every day's delay makes it more likely the new ground will have two
main stands with seats and two shells without, one behind each set of
goals.
The club had approximately #5m after the sale of their Broomfield
ground to Safeway, but that will not build much of a stadium at prices
which will apply when work eventually does begin.
It will be at least two months before the region makes a decision on
the green-belt site known as Raebog, and will take around 10 months more
to build the stadium, which means that Airdrie, who have already
approached Clyde for an extension on the let of Broadwood, must continue
playing in Cumbernauld.
The club will be given a grant, perhaps in the region of #1m from the
Football Trust, but had Albion Rovers adhered to the sensible approach
to the future -- that is, ground-sharing with Airdrie -- the maximum
grant of #2m would have been awarded. That august body regard
ground-sharing as part of tomorrow's world, but not the mighty Rovers.
Airdrie first started talking seriously five years ago about a new
ground and had the people involved in the Lanarkshire side's struggle to
move struck a less intransigent pose, the matter would have been
resolved long ago.
Neither the District nor the Regional Council appear to have gone out
of their way to assist the club and there is a general feeling in the
town that the Labour-controlled Monklands council looked unfavourably on
Airdrie's plans and did little to help them find a site.
Eventually they went along with Raebog, but more than 30 conditions
were attached to the planning application, and Airdrie would have to
spend approximately #600,000 addressing these problems.
A site in the town's Brownsburn area had been preferred by Airdrie,
but they were told by the council that a golf course was planned there.
When the club and a housebuilding firm suggested they could build a
stadium, houses, and a golf course, the word was that the land could not
be used for commercial development.
It will be interesting to see if the local council maintain that view
with regard to the site in question.
Airdrie, whose directors should have done more to win over public
sympathy, will survive, but what of the Rovers? They have undergone
boardroom change with a whole team of new directors. There are now nine
of them -- which is almost as many as the supporters -- running the
club, who are now backing out of selling Cliftonhill and moving in with
their neighbours. Bad move, lads.
The new directors believe they can turn an ailing operation into a
healthy one by remaining at Cliftonhill, a ground which should have been
closed down decades ago.
Word in the district is that this club have debts of #250,000 and to
bring the ground up to decent standard could cost as much as #500,000.
The fact is that Albion Rovers, who are bottom of the game's bottom
division, are in a parlous state and hardly anybody cares, otherwise
they would draw more than a handful of fans to their games.

Manchester United 1, Sheffield Wednesday 0
DAVID May threw down the title gauntlet to his old club Blackburn
yesterday, but the Manchester United hero could now miss the dramatic
climax to this thrilling battle.
The 24-year-old centre half scored the sixth-minute goal which slashed
Rovers' lead to just two points with two games to go and piled on the
pressure in today's Ewood Park clash with Newcastle.
One more slip by Kenny Dalglish's men, who have dropped eight points
in their past four games, and United, who have a far superior goal
difference, can steal in to lift their third consecutive crown, perhaps
returning to the top as early as Wednesday, when Southampton are next up
at Old Trafford.
But May, standing in for back victim Steve Bruce, pulled a muscle in
his own back in the pre-match warm-up and left the action after only 23
minutes, leaving United sweating on their captain's return against the
Saints and their final game at West Ham next Sunday.
It could be another heavy blow for a United side who have kept up the
challenge despite the absence of players such as Andrei Kanchelskis,
Ryan Giggs, Roy Keane, and Eric Cantona.
However, manager Alex Ferguson was a happy man afterwards. He
gleefully twisted the psychological knife when he said of Blackburn's
clash with Newcastle today: ''It's a difficult game for them now. It
could be tight, but Newcastle can enjoy themselves while Blackburn have
simply got to win.
''We know what that's like from three years ago (when Leeds pipped
United). Once your form goes, you become helpless.''
Wednesday, still in danger of relegation, rarely threatened to end
Peter Schmeichel's 17-match Old Trafford run without conceding a league
goal.
So the game hinged really on the first few minutes and the
contribution of the much-derided May, who cost United #1.2m, a sum
Ferguson insists was well spent.
May almost scored in the fifth minute after Denis Irwin's low,
swerving shot had been touched aside by Chris Woods. The former Rangers
and England goalkeeper made an even better save from Lee Sharpe's
corner, flicked on by Gary Pallister and met with a powerful May header.
Woods showed all his old reflexes to touch it against his right-hand
post.
It was only a temporary reprieve as Paul Scholes had the corner from
the left returned to him and brilliantly cut along the bye-line before
setting up May to drill in from 12 yards.
Sadly, May's celebrations of his first Old Trafford league goal gave
way to agony and he had to make way for 20-year-old Gary Neville, elder
brother of right-back Phil, for his home league debut.
After three consecutive, damaging goalless home draws, Ferguson had
been dreaming of an early goal. But, after their perfect start, United
almost immediately took their foot off the accelerator, a dangerous
tactic even though Wednesday had not scored for three games and, for all
their good intentions, struggled to improve on that dismal record.
When United roused themselves, they looked capable of winning by the
sort of 5-0 margin of last season. Sharpe volleyed just wide from Brian
McClair's deep cross, and then Mark Hughes impeded the Scottish
midfielder, whose shot was well saved.
Fergie gingered them up at half-time, especially Paul Ince, who began
driving through midfield in true ''Guv'nor'' fashion, with Nicky Butt
restored alongside him as substitute for Scholes.
But, while the second goal eluded them, their position remained
uneasy, heightened by the arrival in 62 minutes of former England winger
Chris Waddle.
He had barely stepped foot on the pitch when McClair's cross gave Andy
Cole, Monday's two-goal hero at Coventry, his first chance, Woods
spilling his crisp downward header round the near post.
Hughes shot wide and then headed over from Irwin's cross as United
sought a big finish. But they were frustrated by Woods when he superbly
parried a fierce, swerving shot from Butt in 79 minutes. The outstanding
Des Walker hooked clear the loose ball as Hughes and Cole menaced.

SAM Torrance maintained his reputation of always playing well in a
Ryder Cup year by winning the Italian Open with a nerveless last round
of 67 in Milan yesterday.
The 41-year-old Scot finished with a 19-under-par aggregate of 269,
two ahead of Jose Rivero. He was never really threatened -- even though
his Spanish rival, playing just ahead of him, birdied three of the last
four holes.
But so did Torrance, and he said later: ''Every time Jose got one of
those last three birdies he only got to within one shot, and then I
birdied the same holes to go back to two in front again.''
It was his nineteenth victory on the European Tour. His ambition is to
make the Ryder Cup team for the eighth successive time at Oak Hill, New
York, in September, and the #61,716 first prize sent him from tenth to
fifth in the points table.
After his course-record 63 on Saturday, Torrance began the final round
one ahead of Irishman Ronan Rafferty and Italian Costantino Rocca with
Rivero two shots further back. But while Rivero had a last-round 66, six
under par, neither Rafferty nor Rocca could make a similar challenge.
Torrance had six birdies -- three in each half -- with only one bogey,
at the eleventh, where he drove into the rough behind a tree.
The Scot had pulled a muscle at the top of his left leg on Thursday
and did not decide to compete until just before he was due to tee off in
the first round. ''I decided to play and you could say it was the best
decision of my life,'' he said. Leading scores (British or Irish unless
stated):
269 -- S Torrance 69, 70, 63, 67 (#61,716).
271 -- J Rivero (Spain) 66, 70, 69, 66 (#41,119).

* FORMER Open champion Mark Calcavecchia ended a three-year drought by
winning the US$1.3m BellSouth Atlanta Classic yesterday.
Calcavecchia, who had not won since the 1992 Phoenix Open, carded a
six-under-par 66 for a two-stroke victory at Atlanta Country Club.
He took the lead for the first time with a birdie at the difficult
452-yard par-4 fifteenth, and further birdies at the two closing holes
gave him a 17-under total of 271.
Fellow American Jim Gallagher, who led until he bogeyed the fifteenth,
finished outright second on 273 after a 70.
US-based British club pro Stephen Keppler finished third after a
creditable 71. Keppler, 34, who has lived in Atlanta for a decade, teed
off tied with Gallagher and, although he never looked like winning, the
former Walker Cup player birdied the final hole to cap off an

TOM Murray is chasing the biggest athletics pay-day of his career
after moving into second place in the Northumberland Castles Challenge,
an all-terrain series of six races adding up to the marathon distance
which concludes today with a four-mile road race at Bamburgh. Spango
Valley's Murray, already guaranteed #1150 from the #52,000 pot, can
collect a further #4000 if he can protect overall second place. He is
also second in the King of the Mountains' standings, carrying a first
prize of #500.
The three-time Scottish cross-country champion won yesterday's
4.1-mile hill race, in 22min 56sec, 13 seconds clear of overall leader
Martin Jones. Murray was second to Adrian Passey in Saturday's
cross-country. Overall standings:
Men: 1, M Jones (Horwich) 1hr 49min 42sec; 2 T Murray (IBM SV)
1-50-02; 3, C Thackery (Hallamshire) 1-50-24; 4, C Robison (IBM SV)
1-50-34. Women: 1, A Hulley (Leeds) 2-07-39; 2, F Roba (Ethiopia)
2-07-54; 3, H Heasman (Kent) 2-08-39.

DENISE Lewis demonstrated what a rare breed she is when she contested
four events in the opening match of the UK women's league at Crownpoint
on Saturday.
Lewis, Commonwealth heptathlon champion, was one of the few British
stars to appear in the division which should be the platform for the
country's best female talent.
But the threat of mediocrity was relieved by Lewis, three excellent
victories by Commonwealth sprint bronze medallist Paula Thomas, a native
record in the women's hammer by Edinburgh Helen McCreadie, and a fine
team performance by depleted City of Glasgow, who were surprised to
finish second.
Lewis won the high jump (1.80m), despite it clashing with the 100m
hurdles, in which she finished second (13.8), then took third in the
shot (13.58m), which she also had to interrupt, in order to run the
relay for her club, Birchfield.
''I like a bit of fun,'' laughed the Midlander, the only athlete to
seek out officials, join them in a post-match glass of wine, share some
banter, and pay eloquent and gracious tribute to their efforts -- sadly
a rare occurrence.
But she also had criticism: ''I think it's pathetic the way any big
names avoid competition,'' she confided. That jibe could well have been
directed at some of her own clubmates, for her team finished fifth, just
ahead of Essex, whose captain, Sally Gunnell, was the most notable
absentee.
Thomas took the 100 and 200m with legal times of 11.6 and 23.4sec, and
also won the long jump with 6.03m, then helped Trafford win the relay
and overall match.
City of Glasgow overcame their absences and had important A string
wins by Alison Grey (shot 14.39m), and Jane Low (400m hurdles, 60.0).
Glasgow's ability to field competitors in every A and B event --
including marathon woman Elaine McBrinn, who took third in the A 3000m
-- amassed vital points.
McCreadie, 20 on Wednesday, confirmed a prodigious talent with a
hammer throw of 46.48m which surpassed her own native record by 2.60m.
But the Woollen Mill woman could not prevent her team from placing
second-last, when just four more points would have let them leapfrog
Essex and Birchfield.
Their failure to have anyone in either 1500m, the B 3000m, and B 800m,
was sorely punished. However internationalists Emma Lindsay, Caroline
Black, Sinead Dudgeon, and Alison Curbishley, competing at the British
Universites' Championships, will all be available for the remaining two
matches. Placings:
1, Trafford 192pts; 2, City of Glasgow 175; 3, Shaftesbury 170; 4,
Sale 156; 5, Birchfield 136; 6, Essex 135; 7, Edinburgh Woollen Mill
133; 8, Coventry 60.

CAWDER assistant Alan Tait broke the Buchanan Castle course record
with an eight-under-par 62 on Saturday on his way to a resounding
victory in the pro-am at the Stirlingshire course.
The current Scottish national pro-am champion, who set a new record of
64 at Carnoustie's championship course last year, carded six birdies and
an eagle 3 at the 482-yard fourteenth.
The previous best pro score was 66, shared by David Huish and Willie
Milne.
Carnoustie's Lee Vannet betterd that by one, but his 65 was good
enough only for second spot. Leading scores:
62 -- A Tait (Cawder). 65 -- L Vannet (Carnoustie Golf Links). 67 -- B
Kelly (Callander), G Law (Uphall), P Smith (Deeside), C Elliott (Dubai
Creek), R Weir (Cowal), J Greaves (Glasgow). Team: 53 -- Fraser &amp;
Crawford (Lee Vannet (pro), James Roxburgh, Iain Steven, Hugh Houston).

PRINCE Naseem Hamed seldom does things in an orthodox fashion.
For instance, he downed a large plate of sandwiches just a couple of
hours before defeating Mexico's Enrique Angeles at Shepton Mallett.
That would horrify the majority of fight traditionalists, but the
Sheffield extrovert does not like working on an empty stomach, even
though his punching power is putting him on a short-time schedule these
days.
And before Hamed went out to win his fourth defence of the World
Boxing Council international super-bantamweight title in just 3min
55sec, he danced in the dressing room to digest his supper.
Brendan Ingle, his coach, trainer, and manager, needs no reminding
that his man is on such a roll that it would be unwise now to alter the
day-to-day menu -- like often training between 11pm-2am, and going out
for midnight strolls before ''chilling out'' to music, as he did on the
eve of the Angeles fight.
And he is even hungrier in the boxing sense, being within shooting
distance of one of the four world titles, but is looking so good that
those champions are, at present, likely to fight shy of satisfying the
young man's appetite.
Promoter Frank Warren will be working hard to get Hamed his wish by
autumn. ''I'm sure I can get something together by then, and Naz will be
champion, I've no doubt,'' he said.
Hamed's next outing could be in London on the Oliver McCall-Frank
Bruno heavyweight title promotion, set for July 22. And a spot on Mike
Tyson's return bonanza night in Las Vegas on August 19 is a possibility
-- because the American pay-per-view network, Showtime, want to parade
him Stateside.
''I reckon my performances can only get better,'' said Hamed. ''When I
box for a world title, I'll take it with both hands, I know it's within
my grasp. I'm ready, but until then I'll keep knocking over who they put
in front of me.''
Angeles had never been on the floor in 30 fights, but was first
bewildered and then overwhelmed by Hamed's reflexes and hand speed
before the Mexican, with bloodied nose and cut left eye, was counted out
on one knee by referee Larry O'Connell.

FOR the second time this season, Bathgate's Stephen Gallacher
relegated his countryman Gordon Sherry to the runners-up position in a
major amateur event in winning the Lytham Trophy at Royal Lytham and St
Annes yesterday with a closing four-under-par 67.
The European Amateur champion finished with a round which was a
solitary stroke outside the new amateur course record for the historic
6685-yard Lancashire links -- set yesterday by Craig Evans of West
Monmouth -- to deny his Scotland team-mate.
Gallacher, the 20-year-old nephew of Ryder Cup captain Bernard,
followed up on a win at the Scottish Champion of Champions at Leven last
month, and Sherry again had to be content with second place following a
double bogey at the fourteenth and a bogey at the fifteenth.
Prior to those late lapses, the Kilmarnock Barassie player had failed
to register a bogey.
He revealed that a driving tip from his coach Bob Torrance had brought
an upturn in fortunes after his dismal display for Scotland against
Sweden at Loch Lomond last week.
A run of six 3s brought him storming into the lead yesterday
afternoon, the most impressive being a No.3-wood fired 240 yards to six
feet at the eleventh to set up an eagle. Leading scores:
281 -- S Gallacher (Bathgate) 75, 69, 70, 67.
282 -- G Sherry (Kilmarnock Barassie) 70, 71, 69, 72.
285 -- M Eliasson (Mark) 74, 71, 72, 68.
286 -- M Blackley (Hayling) 76, 69, 69, 72.

TODD Larkham provided an upset by beating Miles Maclagan in the final
of the LTA Spring Satellite tournament at Craiglockhart yesterday.
The Australian coped better with the tricky conditions to win 6-4,
6-4, and went on to add the men's doubles title with his brother, Brent,
defeating Britain's Jamie Delgado and Andrew Richardson.
Maclagan was never ahead after having lost the opening game of the
match to love on his own serve. The Scot did break back in the fourth
game, but Larkham broke serve again immediately which proved decisive in
the first set.
Maclagan saved two match points at 3-5 down in the second, but threre
was little doubt that Larkham was the better man on the day. Results:
Yesterday -- Men. Singles final -- T Larkham (Australia) beat M
Maclagan (GB) 6-4, 6-4. Doubles final -- B Larkham-T Larkham (both
Australia) beat A Richardson-J Delgado 6-4, 6-4.

WITH reference to current and planned developments on park land in the
West of Scotland, I am appalled at the assumption that by building
''Superstadia'' we will, at a stroke, create a nation of sporting
excellence. The only achievement of such proposals will be to enable the
fat-cat bureaucrats of the SFA and their ilk to drool over the
possibility of setting up and attending endless committees to plan,
fund, and waste the resources at their disposal.
I play in a Saturday morning Churches League, affiliated to the SFA
(and therefore paying subscriptions to support it), and the facilities
we have to make use of are in most instances a disgrace, with regularly
unplayable pitches and prehistoric changing facilities. As a veteran of
38 years, happy to be playing, it is not the end of the world. To the
countless numbers of youngsters, who are the future of the game, it is
unacceptable and should be a source of shame to the local authorities
who neglect to provide the facilities and to the SFA, who have
contributed nothing to the grass roots provision of our national game.
The vision of the SFA should be to ensure that the basic facilities
are in place, for example a combination of well-maintained grass and
astro-turf pitches and decent changing facilities across the country.
There are examples where decent facilities can be found, like in
Strathclyde Park, but these are the exception rather than the norm.
Forget the Superstadia, forget the centres of excellence, forget the
junkets to foreign places. Look after the roots, and the tree, which is
our beautiful game of football, will flourish. What better use of money
from the Millennium Fund could there be than to upgrade our public
playing fields to a standard which would be the envy of the world?
Arthur Harvey,
22 Castle Wynd,

SUSAN MacDonald was on target three times for Scotland at the weekend
to help her side take a two-match Test series with Belgium in Brussels.
The Scots opened the series with a 5-1 victory on Saturday, with goals
from Susan Fraser, Rhona Simpson, Alison Ramsay, and two from MacDonald.
Yesterday, the confrontation was much less spectacular as the Belgians
adopted safety tactics to blunt the Scottish attack, but there is only
so long that MacDonald can be kept out of a game. She broke the deadlock
after 45 minutes and 10 minutes later Wendy Fraser added the second.
Results:
Saturday. International -- Belgium 1, Scotland 5.
European Under-21 Championship qualifying. Final -- Holland 2 Ukraine
1; 3-4 play-off -- Czech Republic 0, Ireland 0 (Czechs won 3-2 on
penalties); 5-6 -- Italy 3, Poland 0; Scotland 8, Finland 1.
Men. National League: Division 2 -- Stronachs AGS FP 6, Grangemouth 0;

MR MARTINI can defy top weight today and land the #30,000-added
Jubilee Handicap at Kempton. After a spin on the all-weather in January,
Clive Brittain's charge wasn't seen again until producing an
eye-catching performance in the Lincoln handicap.
Badly drawn that day, he proved best of a group of nine runners who
steered a course down the far side, and came within just more than
half-a-length of landing the spoils, finishing behind Roving Minstrel
and Moving Arrow.
A drop back to seven furlongs next time proved disappointing but he
bounced back in terrific style to land a 10-runner one-mile rated stakes
at Sandown, beating one of today's rivals, Air Commodore, by a neck.
Although 1lb worse off with that rival, he can confirm that form and
continue his trainer's fine start to the season.
Castle Courageous can give compensation of sorts to the Angmering
stable of Celtic Swing's trainer Lady Herries by landing the Pegasus
Conditions Stakes.
Despite looking burly after an eight-month lay-off, the eight-year-old
made a pleasing reappearance at Nottingham last month when finishing
fourth to Khamaseen and will be in much better condition for today's
mile-and-threequarter event.
At Haydock, Yorkshire trainer David Nicholls can land the Listed
Haydock Park Spring Trophy Rated Stakes courtesy of Venture Capitalist,
ridden by his wife, Alex Greaves.
Benefiting from a step up to six furlongs, the Never So Bold gelding
put up a sparkling performance when winning at Thirsk last month.
This further step-up in distance should not be an inconvenience and a
double is on the cards.
Henry Cecil sends Lyrikos up to Doncaster and he can supplement his
recent impressive Newbury debut victory.
This son of Lyphard was sent about his business a furlong-and-a-half
from the finish in his Newbury outing and he stretched clear in good
style to put five lengths between himself and the second horse. Further
improvement is likely.
* DOUBLE Eclipse was a disappointing eighth of nine to Rifapour in the
Group 2 Prix Hocquart yesterday at Longchamp.
Mark Johnston's raider was in a prominent position throughout the
early stages but the writing was on the wall when Cash Asmussen went for
his whip three furlongs out.
Poliglote, the even-money favourite, who took up the running from
pacemaker Fifty Four in the straight, was pipped on the line by
Rifapour. The colt was the second leg of a big-race double for the Aga
Khan, who earlier had watched Valanour win the Group 3 Prix de Guiche.

WORLD snooker champion Stephen Hendry held a five-frame lead after the
first session of the Dr Martens European League final at Irthlingborough
yesterday.
Hendry, who played well when defeating Jimmy White in Saturday's
semi-final, reeled off the first six frames on the trot yesterday,
reducing Irishman Ken Doherty to a mere spectator as he built up a 7-2
lead.
The highlight of the session was a superb 129 clearance in the second
frame. Hendry needs just three more frames to take the title for the
fourth time, and the #50,000 first prize to take his earnings for the
season to more than #750,000.
Rare lapses of concentration let Doherty take two of the last three
frames to salvage some pride, but he will have to take his game to new
dimensions to overturn the high flying Scot.

1000 GUINEAS
SHEIKH Hamdan Al Maktoum's Harayir gave trainer Dick Hern an emotional
1000 Guineas win at Newmarket yesterday to mark the fiftieth anniversary
of the end of World War Two in Europe.
The 5-1 shot, a chance ride for Richard Hills, swept home an
effortless two-length winner from Sheik Hamdan's other runner, the 3-1
favourite Aqaarid.
For once, classic specialist Willie Carson picked the wrong horse as
he was also given the chance to ride the winner.
Moonshell, who wintered in the desert sunshine of Dubai and flew in
specially for the race, ran on well three-quarters of a length behind to
land third prize.
Hern, who has been confined to a wheelchair since a hunting accident,
and revered as one of Britain's greatest trainers, said: ''Little did I
think that 50 years on I would be standing in the winners enclosure at
Newmarket. In 1945 I was on the River Po in Italy with my regiment.''
For the capacity 25,000-strong crowd enjoying the first day's racing
in Britain when they could bet on and off the course, it was an
emotionally charged classic.
Sheikh Hamdan, owner of such great classic heroes as Epsom Derby
winner Nashwan, paid rich tribute to his trainer's expertise, telling
reporters: ''He just lost his legs, not his mind.''
Richard Hills, given the chance for his first classic win thanks to
Carson's rare slip-up, was gulping with emotion when he shook Hern's
hand and said: ''Thank you, sir. This was the greatest moment of my
life.
''I pulled out and showed her daylight and she said 'I'll go when you
want to go.' When I asked, she just flew.''
In the hotly-contested race at a sun-drenched Newmarket, Epagris,
Bring on the Choir, and Harayir led the 14-strong field up the daunting
straight at the headquarters of British racing.
But the writing was on the wall around four furlongs out. Harayir was
going easily, Hills had a real handful, and the race looked well sewn
up.
He pressed the button two furlongs out and went clean away,
spreadeagling the field.
Sheikh Hamdan was full of sympathy for Carson's pre-race agonising
that lost the jockey the chance of another classic but concluded: ''I
think Harayir was a better filly on the day.''
* PENNEKAMP was yesterday hailed an exceptional winner of the 2000
Guineas with the potential to emulate the great Dancing Brave.
The French colt has been allotted an official rating of 130 for a
performance equal to that achieved in the classic by Dancing Brave in
1986 and Zafonic two years ago.
Chief rival Celtic Swing, beaten a head by Pennekamp, has been dropped
1lb to a mark of 129 by the BHB's mile handicapper Richard Dangar.

an extra-time win over Newtonmore in the second semi-final of the

Newtonmore played well but Oban's gamble in playing Dave McCuish,
appearing in his first game since breaking an ankle, eventually paid

He netted the winner after 13 minutes of extra time, firing the ball
home from 20 yards below keeper MacArthur's legs. Results:

BRAD Bannister, Selkirk's Australian pro, justified the SCU's
dispensation that allows the South, Scotland's Cinderella district, to
beef up its side with one ''outsider''. At Forthill he hit a
half-century and took the only wicket North lost as they opened their
defence of the Royal Bank Quaich in majestic style.
Then McGill, a late addition to the North attack, bagged five wickets
as South stumbled to 149 with the final wicket going down in the
fifty-sixth over. Bannister shared in the best partnership -- 41 with
Douglas Wilson for the fourth wicket.
Strathclyde West overhauled Central's 245 for six with one ball left
at Boghall. Resuming after lunch at 167 for three with 19 overs left,
Central started slowly and finished 40 runs light. West stuttered when
Bruce Patterson was run out, backing up, for 91 in the fifty-third over
and Drew Parsons went in the next over.
It was Strathclyde East who lost their way in a rain-affected match
with Edinburgh. Chasing 242 for six, they saw Alistair Storie out to the
last ball before tea and George Reiffer out to the first ball after the
rain interruption. They finally fell 17 short of the revised target of
234.

RANGERS once again are upping the ante in their quest for a place at
European soccer's top table. That is the only conclusion which can be
drawn by their move to sign Paul Gascoigne -- possibly the boldest
transfer bid the Scottish champions have yet made.
If Gascoigne does arrive at Ibrox in the summer, there are several
ways the signing can help the Ibrox club.
* It would raise their profile in Europe yet again.
* It would give them another player of extravagant skills to boost
their dreams of playing in the Champions' League again.
* It would add to their appeal to the television channels and
advertising moguls who influence the choice of seeded clubs named by the
European Union.
If they were either handed a seeded place in the league or Gascoigne
inspired them to victory in the qualifying round, then the money spent
would be recouped immediately.
These are the stakes that Rangers are playing for.
However, there may also be a hidden agenda for David Murray and for
the other soccer moguls who control some of the biggest clubs across
Europe.
Growing rumours suggest that the Champions' League -- an idea which
was first floated by Rangers -- is no longer enough for the major
European teams. Many of them would like to see that concept extended so
that the leagues are bigger and the games more frequent. In essence,
they are looking for a European Super League which would run alongside
the current national championships.
Already UEFA have recommended that leagues should not have more than
34 matches in any season. That looks more and more as if Europe's top
officials are clearing the way for the extension of the Champions'
League that bigger clubs are demanding.
Rangers, of course, are one of these clubs. They are in a difficult
position because while Scotland remains a separate soccer nation -- and
will always remain that way -- the television purse-strings and the
major multi-national sponsors are controlled, in the main, from London.
Scotland does not represent a major market even though Rangers would
outdraw most other European champions when it comes to actual
attendances. That is why if, for instance, Blackburn Rovers win the
English Premiership this season they are likely to be placed ahead of
Rangers in any seeding.
That will happen because England is a bigger country, can provide a
bigger television audience, and the sponsors will happily go along with
all of that. Yet, in football terms, Blackburn's European record began
only last season and ended very quickly at the hands of a team of
Swedish part-timers.
A club's football pedigree is not the surest way to recognition in
these times of huge investments in individual clubs by millionaire
entrepreneurs.
Money talks. It always has been so, but it is even more obvious now.
Ibrox supremo Murray recognises that. He must also recognise that
there is no need to spend many, many millions of pounds on Gascoigne, or
Jesper Blomquist from Gothenburg, or any of the others who currently are
being linked with the club, simply to keep on winning the Scottish
title.
That can probably be achieved with some minor team-strengthening moves
in the summer. Therefore, it is clear that Murray's sights are set well
beyond the confining horizons of our own championship.
Yes, they would still play their league games and they would still
have to win that championship to play in the Champions' League, but if
they continue to move in their current direction then that will be
achieved.
The problem for the chasing clubs in Scotland is that once the Ibrox
club are in that elite, it will be even more difficult to catch them.
The money which will be generated from more and more top-class European
games will add to a spending power which is already greater than any of
their rivals.
Celtic are attempting to close the gap now, but, even after their new
super stand is completed this summer, the Parkhead club will still have
to find funding for two more stands at either end of the ground.
Rangers, on the other hand, do not need any huge investment in their
stadium, and if their European ambitions are realised, then the money
will pour into the Ibrox coffers as never before.
It cannot be a particularly attractive scenario to the other Scottish
clubs because, basically, the tide of European cash could push Rangers
on to another plane altogether.
That is why manager Walter Smith and his chairman can justify a gamble
on Gascoigne. Looking only at his enormous ability, then there is little
to criticise in the transfer bid.
When you take into account the fact that Gascoigne often has been the
unacceptable face of English soccer, a lager lout look-alike on too many
occasions, then question marks arise.
But when the stakes are this high -- and you are looking at a
situation where Rangers could join the big guns of European football on
a more or less permanent basis -- then there are persuasive arguments in
favour of the signing.
Nine years ago the Ibrox revolution was begun by Graeme Souness, a man
who also had his problems on and off the field.
If Gascoigne arrives and can add something extra to the foundations
laid down by Souness and Smith and all their other major signings, then
the rest of the domestic game will be forced to face many more winters
of discontent.
That may be good for Rangers but it leaves me worrying over the fate
of the other clubs . . .

EAST LEAGUE
TWO Ryden East League matches unfolded within a matter of yards in
Edinburgh on Saturday and both finished as draws. But there the
comparison ends.
Grange were inserted by Royal High, rattled on to 231 four four in 48
overs, and then suffered frustration as the visitors set up a holding
operation from the word go.
Peter Steindl's 81 was the fulcrum around which Grange's total
developed with attractive support from Alec Davies, Mike Everett, and
newcomer Neil Ritchie.
There was a colourful contribution from ex-president of the Scottish
Cricket Union, Dougie Lawrence, pressed into service as High substitute
when Abdul Rehman was crocked going for a low catch.
Pausing only to leave his bus pass in safe keeping, the former
internationalist leapt into energetic action resplendent in pink sweater
and blue slacks.
High were successful in their limited ambition of avoiding defeat,
thanks mainly to a watchful defence by Paul Fraser, who survived for
more than half the innings, latterly in partnership with his dad.
This kind of match is grist to the mill for those who advocate that
the draw should be eliminated from league cricket.
But powerful evidence that it can be a valid outcome was provided
across the road, where Edinburgh Academicals and Stenhousemuir arrived
at the closing stages with all things still possible.
Accies had recovered from a precarious 61 for five to reach 196,
losing their last wicket off the final ball of the fiftieth over.
The recovery was largely due to another newcomer, New Zealander James
Doughty, who hit 69, mostly in tandem with keeper Richard Eglinton.
Ian Philip and John Bell looked in contol in launching the reply with
a 50 partnership, but once Accies drew blood, the innings began to
buckle.
Crucially, Eddie Pollock remained and as long as he was there,
Stenhousemuir were in with a chance. However, home pro Craig Symons
trapped him leg before with just one over and a bit to go and the
tailenders held out for a draw.
Elsewhere, Heriot's encountered stiffer resistance than they might
have anticipated in winning at Falkland, while Robin Singh was Carlton's
match-winner at Corstorphine.
Freuchie had the better of the draw with Watsonians at Myreside.

ENGLAND captain Mike Atherton maintained his impressive early-season
form with another century as Lancashire opened their AXA Equity &amp; Law
League season with a comfortable victory against Durham.
Tom Moody also reached three figures, for Worcestershire as they
inflicted Essex's heaviest-ever Sunday League defeat, while defending
champions Warwickshire slumped against Surrey at Edgbaston.
All-rounder Adam Hollioake, who hit 54 and took four for 22, played a
major role in Surrey's success. He added 105 with England's Graham
Thorpe (60) as Surrey reached 192 for five before the hosts were
dismissed for 145.
Atherton shared a fourth-wicket stand of 140 with Graham Lloyd (63)
while hitting his third ton of the season, reaching 103 in 97 deliveries
as Lancashire beat Durham by 84 runs.
Lancashire made 249 for seven before dismissing the visitors for 165.
Phil Newport's career-best Sunday League return of five for 32 plus
Moody's ton helped Worcestershire to a mammoth 178-run victory against
Essex, who were routed for 75 when chasing 253 for six.
Worcestershire had been boosted by a second-wicket stand of 160
between Moody and Graeme Hick (80).

WESTERN UNION
POLOC turned in a comprehensive all-round performance to dump Paisley
visitors, Ferguslie, by 123 runs in Saturday's DM Hall Western Union
encounter at Shawholm.
Sajid Ali was the Poloc hero, taking apart the Ferguslie bowling
attack. At the end of 50 overs, Poloc had reached 201-8, Sajid
undefeated on 121 with nine boundries and a couple of 6s during his
glorious knock.
Replying, Ferguslie reached 21 for the loss of Justin Gayfer. But
after that, seamers Ronnie McGregor and Ian Holten sliced their way
through the visitors' batting, reducing them to 43-6.
Hired hand Mike Pawson managed to stop the slide. Keith Sheridan's
introduction, however, proved decisive, the Scotland spinner in the
space of 3.4 overs collecting 3-10 and Poloc securing victory.
Meanwhile at Titwood, Aamir Hanif was helping Clydesdale to a
comfortable eight-wicket win against a Drumpellier side who struggled to
make good on a lively strip.
Anjum Aslam attempted to pull and collected one in the teeth from
Greig Williamson, and although Saleem Sajjad contributed a half-century,
the Coatbridge side's total of 169-9 always looked reachable.
Aamir, partnered by Clydesdale skipper Scott Weir, had little trouble
in knocking off the required runs.
It was a similar tale at Bothwell, where Greenock made it two wins
from as many starts when they beat Uddingston by three wickets.
Uddingston crawled to 70 without loss after 31 overs, Euan Stirrat
making 47. George Reifer added a further 34, but the home side still
needed the additional four overs to reach 142-6.
Reifer kept Greenock in check, the Scotland cap taking five wickets.
Tom Black, though, and a handy hit from Kenny Godsman enabled the 1993
champions to limp home with two balls to spare, the Thomson Twins,
Ronnie and David, in tandem at the time.
The pace of Roger Telemachus was just too much for Kilmarnock, earning
Kelburne maximum points. The South African professional ripped though
the opposition line-up, a four-wicket burst sending Killie tumbling from
55 without loss to 67-5.
While Asif Mujtaba chipped out a useful 57, Telemachus finished with
6-46 as Kilmarnock totalled 140. Telemachus and Dougie Wylie were the
main run-makers as the Whitehaugh hosts swept home with 15 overs to
spare.
Champions Ayr looked poised for a decent total when on 104-4 with 10
overs to go against West of Scotland at Cambusdoon -- but instead
finished all out for just 116.
West also struggled, with Andrew Baird making inroads, while pro
Adrian Holdstock upset West's middle order. With nine down, the
last-wicket pair of Colin Mair and Mark Townsend survived for what
seemed like an eternity before straight spinner Bruce Patterson cleaned
''Dobbin'' to ease some of the home club's worries.

AS A part-time supporter (about 15 games a year) of the relegation
Houdinis in Red, Black, and Gold, I decided on the spur of the good
weather on Tuesday to make the 150-mile pilgrimage south to see my
favourites in their vital away clash at Hampden Park to Celtic.
To my dismay, on my arrival to the ground, I discovered that the match
was all-ticket -- and I didn't have one.
I was not the only one. There was a fair crowd milling around outside,
so I joined them. It turned out that there was a Portacabin somewhere in
the South Stand car park selling tickets, so I tried that but there were
a few hundred in the slow-moving queue. There were three windows, so a
lot of the crowd were giving up and going home. When I got to the front
of this queue, just before half-time, I couldn't get a ticket for the
Thistle end.
You may think me naive, but consider it as a business. They have what
The Herald report called a ''relatively sparse'' crowd inside and a
sizeable crowd outside, numbering in the hundreds -- possibly more than
a thousand -- all dying to part with their hard-earned cash. What is the
financial sense in that? Who is being naive?
Obviously for a game where demand will outstrip supply, pre-selling
tickets before the game is desirable. But when you're not even going to
half-fill the stadium? And if you are going to allow tickets to be sold
on the night within 50 metres of the ground, why not just sell them at
the turnstiles?
At a time where Scottish football needs every penny it can get I do
not see the sense of locking people out of a half-filled stadium.

SCOTTISH COUNTIES
ASHOK Malhotra again proved his worth with the bat for Fifeshire at
Prestwick Oval. The man who topped the averages last season with two
centuries, five scores of more than 50, and eight innings not out,
rescued his squad with an unbeaten 90 as they battled to 154 for 4.
And with opener Ewan Ogilvie and Azam Raza out without scoring, making
the Fifers four for 2, Malhorta's contribution and that of Wayne
Sullivan with 30, was put into perspective.
Drew Parsons had hit 52 as Ayrshire rattled on the highest counties
score of the day -- 218 for seven, but in the end, they had to settle
for the draw.
Champions Strathmore began their season the same way as last year --
gaining the better of the draw against Aberdeenshire. Skipper Mark
Kelaher had a useful knock for 46 in an all-out total of 130.
But Andy Monteith continued where he left off last season at the top
of the bowling averages. He had a record of 31 wickets at an average of
11.45 runs. He's already ahead of the game after Saturday's four for 25
as the Mannofield side hung on at 81 for nine.
Stirling County professional Kyle Wealleans proved how much a force he
will be in this season's championship when he hit 54 in his sides's 165
for six -- which was a total big enough to pass West Lothian's 162 for
nine at Williamfield.
The Linlithgow side seemed to be in a good position on a wicket not
famed for producing runs with 91 from Sanjay Patel. But last year's
Stirling professional, who admitted not to have had his best season for
the club, then put West Lothain to the sword with bowling figures of six
for 49. Another plus for West Lothian was Gordon Hollins taking five for
61.
Mike Howell was unbeaten on 84 for Clackmannan at the North Inch, yet
his colleagues could only get a team total to 150, Perthshire's Kash
Kalil taking four for 61 and Jim Muir three for 33. Bruce Ferguson
knocked up 42 runs, and Chris Galloway an unbeaten 69 as the home side
eased to 151 for two.
Bruce Robertson was in fine form with the ball, taking five for 72,
Jim Girolami pitching in with four for 29, as Forfarshire bowled out
Arbroath for 141.

PARTICK Thistle are the in-form team of the moment. It is a shame,
therefore, that it is so peculiarly difficult to watch them.
Wednesday evening's game against Celtic at Hampden Park was poorly
attended. This may have been because several hundred Partick Thistle
supporters and lay members of the public were unable to pay at the
turnstiles to enter the ground.
Instead, a Portacabin with a queue the length of the main stand was
the only point of ticket sales.
Gaun yersel, Scottish football!

Navacerrada, Spain.
HELLO mother, hello father. Here we are in Camp 'Cerrada.
You will remember, of course, the sixties comic ditty in which the
misadventures of a US teenage summer camp were recounted in an audio
postcard. You don't? Well, I'm a bit hazy on details, too, but, as I
recall it, the camp in question was Camp Granada, or something similiar.
I'm a bit hazy, too, on just where Granada is, although I'm virtually
certain that, in addition to being a TV station, Granada had something
to do with Spain.
And in Spain we are, and have been these past eight days.
In temperatures which often soared to the mid-eighties, Scotland's
rugby World Cup squad have worked out twice a day. Scotland may not come
home from South Africa with the William Webb Ellis trophy but, if the
Spanish experience is anything to go by, it certainly will not have been
for the want of trying.
The past eight days have been trying, too, for the press posse
accompanying the squad. The scourge of the late twentieth-century journo
seeking to keep the readers back home informed is still the inadequacy
of telephones systems the world over.
This epistle is being written on what is called a Tandy. It sounds
like a cuddly toy. Sadly, it is not. The words you read are transmitted
from the lap-top computer down a telephone wire direct to the office in
Glasgow. One blip on the system, though, and Tandy decides that it has
had enough and goes into a telecommunications huff.
The frustrations of the scribe, though, are but minor irritations
compared to those of the photographers on the trip. The snappers travel
with enough excess baggage to give airlines corporate heartburn,
transmitting home with the aid of multi-thousand-pound boxes of tricks
that, once again, rely upon perfect telephone lines. Time and again they
are caught out by rogue hotel switchboards.
Here in Navacerrada the snappers have been close to mass suicide.
The problem was solved in novel fashion. There is in this small
village in the Sierra Madrid mountains a bar by the name of Figon el
Rumba, run by a splendid Spaniard called Jeorge. Mine host has a sister
who is a casino croupier in Madrid.
Jeorge's sister's house stands empty while she is at the tables in
Madrid. The snappers, tears spilling all the while into their beers,
were recounting their plight to Jeorge. What they needed was a direct
telephone line which did not go through a pesky hotel switchboard.
Jeorge immediately offered them the keys of his sister's house and it is
from there that the photographs that you have seen in this paper these
past eight days have been transmitted. Jeorge may well become the patron
saint of photographers.
The press posse have lived cheek by jowl with the players throughout
the week. Every training session has been attended and if there is such
a thing as fitness by association, then I am in better shape than I have
ever been!
Dammit, I even scrummaged against the Scotland pack the other day.
Admittedly the press pack was just making up the numbers on the
scrummage machine sledge but we gave them a hard workout. It will
certainly have been the heaviest pack that Scotland have faced this
season!
For the players, though, the week has been one of sun, fun, toil on
the training paddock, and some serious rugby. All of which is money, as
manager Duncan Paterson puts it, in the bank for South Africa.

I WOULD like to add to Ian Paul's comments (April 28) regarding Willie
Miller's performance on the BBC panel at the San Marino v Scotland
match.
The columnist was correct to praise Miller, who consciously
side-stepped the urge to make negative comparisons between past and
present Scottish sides.
This easy cynicism has become endemic among television ''experts'' and
critics when talking about the decline of Scottish football in general.
Consequently, the scope for constructive thinking in our game has been
reduced.
Willie Miller's approach, although critical, was less resigned and
refreshingly honest. It was a lesson to all those who instantly recall
unrelated heydays when things begin to go wrong in the present.
If the current mood of defeatism continues to stalk our game, then we
can expect only to lapse further behind more progressive footballing
nations.

Spain 7, Scotland 62
THEY didn't quite hit Gavin Hastings' pre-match target of 70 points
but it was still a 10-try fiesta in Madrid, and Scotland leave for the
Rugby World Cup tomorrow week in good heart and with spirits high.
The Scots lost focus in the third quarter as the energy-sapping,
intensely humid comditions began to take their toll, but they rallied to
score 21 points in the final 20 minutes and, perhaps even more
importantly, denied the physical Spaniards any sight of the Scottish
line.
Craig Joiner, as he did against a Madrid County select on Tuesday
night, romped over for a hat trick of tries and rewarded the selectors
who had stuck by him throughout the early Five Nations' games as he
battled to come to terms with the demands of international rugby.
It would be wrong to read too much into the final scoreline -- Spain
after all are no New Zealand, nor, even, France who are the bogymen in
Scotland's RWC pool in South Africa -- but the Scots displayed for much
of the game the intensity of purpose which had been so lacking in the
display against Madrid Select.
Damian Cronin, who went into the game suffering from a strained left
hamstring, came off after 27 minutes as he felt the offending limb
tighten up but he has done enough to confirm his passage to Pretoria. Of
more interest to the Scotland management was how the arm he damaged so
seriously against France in February would react to the heat of battle
and in this regard the medical report was filed under category A1.
Rob Wainwright had a fine game. His two tries were the icing on an
appetising cake and, with the rejuvenated Doddie Weir, he was the pick
of the Scotland forwards.
Craig Chalmers has played some of the best rugby of his career this
season. The Melrose stand-off was another to get among the tries but,
like Wainwright, his touchdown was just a tangible reward for a
performance which oozed authority and commanding presence. The
autograph-hunting Spanish youngsters who mobbed the Scottish side as
they left the pitch had it spot on when they slapped Chalmers on the
back with the commendation ''Bravo, maestro.''
Stewart Campbell, who came on as replacement for Cronin despite
suffering the flu-like side-effects of infected insect bites to the leg,
was another who showed up well. And his elevation from the bench
provided ammunition for sports quiz question-masters as Ian Morrison
retired hurt after a couple of hefty knocks. Weir slotted into the
back-row and from the bench to fill the vacant middle-row slot came the
Orrell hooker, Martin Scott.
The centre partnership of Shiel and Stanger worked well, with Stanger
showing power and pace, and particularly so in the lead-up to
Wainwright's second try. Shortly thereafter both centres were replaced
by benchmen Scott Hastings and Ian Jardine. More properly, as it later
transpired, Shiel and Stanger were substituted, as opposed to replaced
on medical grounds.
Coach Dougie Morgan said they had wanted to have another look at
Hastings and Jardine, so on came the subs. ''The Spaniards were doing it
and so we reckoned why couldn't we,'' he said with a twinkle in his eye.
Scotland opened the scoring after seven minutes with almost a repeat
of the move which brought Shiel a try against Romania. Chalmers went on
a dummy run from scrummage ball and it was Hastings this time who went
in for the touchdown which he also converted.
Nine minutes later Joiner went over for his first try from a Peters
pick-up and link work by Redpath and Chalmers. Hastings scored his
second try after Chalmers, Shiel, and Stanger had carved open the
Spanish defence.
Next came Wainwright's first try, the army doctor touching down at the
posts, Morrison having secured lineout ball with Redpath and Chalmers
making the initial foray over the gain-line. Hastings converted.
Morrison's try, which came just after the half-hour mark, was the
touchdown of the evening. It began deep inside Scottish territory,
Redpath serving Hastings and the captain displaying great vision to put
Morrison into space.
Logan, Weir, and Stanger took the ball well into Spanish territory
before Morrison reappeared to harvest the seeds sown 70 metres upfield.
Three minutes before the interval Logan went over for his try, which
stemmed from a bone-jarring tackle of Spanish fly-half Xabier Gerediaga
by Peters. The ball was won by Scotland, and Stanger, Shiel, and
Wainwright sent Logan in on his ''wrong'' wing, the Stirling County man
still having a fair bit to do before reaching the line. The captain
converted and Scotland were 36-0 in front at the turn.
Six minutes into the second period Spain opened their account, Pablo
Gutierrez punishing Scottish defensive errors with a break-out try which
originated near the Scottish line. Gerediaga converted.
Scotland let their game slip for the next quarter of an hour but, even
so, the Spaniards could make little headway. The Scots came back on song
after 58 minutes, Shiel sending Joiner over for a try after Weir,
Campbell, Weir again, and Wright had put the side back on an even keel.
Wainwright's second try came six minutes later, Hastings converting.
Next it was Chalmers who breached the Spanish line, the Melrose fly-half
doing well to reach the goal line from a lineout 10 metres out. Hastings
made it 7-55 with the conversion.
Joiner's hat trick arrived just a minute from the end, the ball
zipping along the threequarter line, and Scott Hastings showing
commendable pace before sending young Joiner home. Hastings Sr,
converted and Scotland were eight points short of their target but still
on course for a RWC campaign which is full of South African promise.

WE CRICKET enthusiasts here in the West of Scotland rely on you for a
report on all the weekend's cricket. After your coverage of the first
League weekend, however, I think you'll need to try just a wee bit
harder.
Your Western Union report waxed lyrical about Aamir Hanif and his 118
not out. Unfortunately, he did not appear on the Clydesdale scorecard.
The result at Hamilton Crescent was a tie, not a draw.

TAXI drivers call it a No-Job. It means that some customer has
telephoned for a car and not turned up. It is an irritation to drivers
and also to other customers who can't get a cab because an idjit has
kept the poor driver from picking anybody else up while he waits for
ever, for nothing.
Yesterday, at Murrayfield Stadium, I had a No-Job. The Scottish
Claymores versus the London Monarchs. American football -- you know the
game, the one with big shoulders and helmets and it all takes hours. And
helmets cost #150, padding #200, and the livery enough for a jet engine.
But I had a No-Job and I will tell you why.
Despite the fact that American football, and especially the
newly-formed Scottish Claymores, puts out more pre-publicity than almost
any sport I have ever encountered, the one thing it can't, well at least
Sunday's event couldn't, do was tell me anything.
I'd intended to turn up about an hour in advance of the kick-off time
of 4pm (on a Sunday for heaven's sake, ideal for a sports page), but let
us go back to taxis. There was not a taxi in Western Europe on a Sabbath
which involved a Rangers and Celtic game at Hampden Park. But I arrived
at Murrayfield in time for the start but not in time to catch the people
who want to matter in this much-publicised new sport. I couldn't even
get a programme.
In truth I wanted to know much, much, more about American football.
Despite the glamour of it all and all those copious movies (there was
one which starred a very unlikely quarterback, well the actor was.
Anthony Perkins would pass for Olive Oyle on a diet).
I have never seen the glamour at all. It seems to me like Rugby League
for wimps. They have to sport the padding because they're feart to get
hurted. Only Yanks could think it up.
I did manage to speak to a very courteous and pleasant American footy
chap who in fact hails from Carluke, a Mr Richard Orr, from the
Clydesdales Club.
Richard, at 33, admits to being a little elderly in his sport but
maintained that it was smashing for families, and so it is. His wife and
weans were in the crowd of just over 10,000 at Murrayfield, a big crowd
indeed by today's soccer standards.
And incidentally Murrayfield, which is now an astonishingly
magnificent stadium, and which possessed large American-type screens to
watch the close-ups, is so enclosed that even that crowd made more noise
than you could hear at a Glasgow nightclub just before the curfew.
My problem was that I could not penetrate the family of players or
officials.
They have a level of security which would do credit to a V E Day in
Belfast starring the Queen Mother. I managed, with considerable
difficulty, to obtain a press pass.
Turned out it wasn't enough and the police, who were thoroughly
polite, pleasant, and amazed at the security imposed upon themselves --
let alone the press -- told me I couldn't get on to the track-side. I
spoke to a sergeant who informed me that there was no reason other than
orders why I shouldn't be able to go walkabout at all. There was. In
American football while the game is on, all the officials are too busy
cavorting about with walkie-talkies to speak to anything as humble as a
spectator, let alone a journalist.
It was all a great shame for there was everything out there which I
wanted to write about, like why are so few of the Claymores Scottish? Is
it like ice hockey in which young and inexperienced college boys come
across The Pond to do a wee European apprenticeship? Why does it take so
long for a match in the first place? Where do they recruit the
Cheerleaders?
I may say I was especially interested in the Cheerleaders, who were
wonderfully enthusiastic and seem to be mainly students from physical
education and drama colleges and such, and whether the girls thought
their efforts were pandering to drooling sexists like myself or whether,
like American girls, they thought it was a smashing opportunity to show
off.
These are a lot of questions. Unanswered.
For in a day in which much mindless bigotry in the West of Scotland is
celebrated -- the Rangers and Celtic game -- one would hardly have
thought that so much mindless bloody security was needed at an American
Football match with wives and weans and decent chaps like Richard Orr
telling me as much as he could about the sport he has played for the
last 10 years and wants to promote. He and his assistant were very
embarrassed. I wasn't. Bloody angry. Edinburgh's bad enough without a
No-Job.
The Claymores lost.

two memorable experiences when Kelso swept Gala aside by 28-22 in the
final of sun-drenched Jed-Forest Sevens.
Notwithstanding hamstring damage that required pain-easing spray after
it had appeared likely to eliminate him from the final, he yet thundered
70 metres for a wonderful try that, with Graeme Aitchison's conversion,
gave Kelso a 14-12 half-time lead they never relinquised.
Then, as Kelso captain, he limped forward to accept the Riverside
Trophy and signal a famous triumph that avenged their defeat by Gala in
the same event a year ago.
In one of the great finals that enthralled the biggest Jed-Forest
Sevens crowd for years, Kelso took a leaf from the Gala book with robust
and unceremonious forward operations, instant engagement of the opposing
ball carrier. Kelso also showed feverish intent to provide support in
both retreat and advance operations.
This was epitomised in one magical sequence. Ian McArthur failed to
check ball on the floor in the Gala 22 and Gavin Dalglish, who had
already scored a remarkable zig-zag individualist try to reduce Gala's
deficit to 21-17, launched a hack and chase over 70 metres that was
thwarted on the Kelso goal-line by the same persistent McArthur.
With admirable presence of mind, he kept his cool in launching a
counter-attack involving Clive Millar and Stuart Lang and, 100m later,
Gordon Laing scuttled home for a breathtaking score that, with
Aitchison's eighteenth conversion (he also had four tries for 56
points), transformed a possible Kelso deficit of 24-21 into a handsome
cushion of 28-17 with one minute left.
Gala lead 12-0 early in the final from tries by Chris Dalglish and
Michael Dods who converted the first. Tries by Laing (after Gala dissent
advanced an offence kick) and by Bennett were converted by Aitchison.
The elongated Lang then became top try-scorer of the tournament with
his seventh and there was that astonishing sequence for Kelso's safety
margin before David Bolland raced clear for the last try of a riveting
contest after which all 14 players were given a lengthy ovation.
Gala had swung into gear early with seven tries against
Stewart's-Melville FP, five against Heriot's FP -- after having given
them a 10-0 start -- then had to work a bit harder to overcome Selkirk.
Kelso excelled in moving ball out of the tackle while seeing off
Currie, then Boroughmuir, for whom Darren Burns showed quarter-miler
style in registering four tries in two ties. Boroughmuir had given
Melrose a 21-0 lead before rallying for a 28-21 victory.
In the lower semi-final, Jed-Forest, for whom Kevin Liddle and Kevin
Amos had been in sparkling form, had to reorganise their back division
after having lost stand-off Chris Richards and just could not tie down
Lang, who romped away for four tries, while Aitchison contributed 24
points in a Kelso landslide. Dods, with six tries and 13 conversions,
tied with Aitchison as top scorer with 56 points.
The #2000 prize for the Radio Borders/Kleenex Tissues Kings of the
Sevens series has been won by Gala with 41 points, and Kelso won #500
for second place with 37 points. Results:
First round -- Gala 45, Stewart's Melville FP 0; Heriot's FP 12,
Langholm 0; Selkirk 24, Stirling County 12; Hawick 31, Edinburgh

WILL Carling could be reinstated as England's World Cup captain.
The sacking of England's skipper took a new turn last night when Rugby
Football Union president Dennis Easby -- the man who sacked him on
Saturday and then said only yesterday: ''I stand by the decision, and
there is no chance whatsoever that it will be reversed'' -- agreed to
meet Carling to discuss the immediate future. Easby's move followed a
meeting with Carling's agent John Holmes.
In another twist, the 25 other players in England's World Cup squad
issued a statement supporting Carling, asking the RFU to reconsider
their decision.
Both Rob Andrew and Dean Richards stated firmly that they would not
accept the captaincy in the present circumstances.
In a statement the England players said: ''The full England World Cup
squad respectfully request that the officers of the Rugby Football Union
reconsider the decision to dismiss Will Carling.
''All the players stand fully behind Will as captain of the England
team.
''We hope this matter can be resolved speedily in order that we may
concentrate on preparing for the World Cup without any further
disruption.''
Easby, whose mood became more conciliatory than punitive, said: ''That
is a very reasonable statement. I have had a talk with John Holmes and
he proposed that I should meet Will, and I am prepared to do so as early
as possible.''
The fact that Easby is ready to discuss the issue with the player, who
is now officially the ex-England captain, suggests that one of the most
widely condemned sporting decisions in modern times may be reversed.
Richards and Andrew would be among the leading candidates to take over
from Carling if the decision stood, but both have made it clear that
they would not be prepared to take on the role.
Carling apologised for his offensive remarks the day after the
broadcast was made but by then the top brass of the RFU had arrived at
their decision.
However, it seems that second, calmer thoughts might prevail, though
Carling seems certain to have to come up with further back-tracking,
grovelling apologies, and pledges to give the RFU committee full public
support.
Carling expressed his gratitude to his colleagues: ''I am touched by
the support of the players,'' he said. ''It is very comforting, but all
I can do is wait and see how things develop.''

CELTIC chief scout David Hay was at Firhill on Saturday keeping tabs
on Falkirk pair David Weir and John Hughes as they turned out against
Partick Thistle.
Hay had already checked on Brockville skipper Hughes, who is out of
contract this summer.
Full back Weir was a target earlier this season for Rangers and
Liverpool. Ibrox manager Walter Smith and Anfield chief scout Ron Yeats
both checked on him. However, interest cooled and now Celtic could be
set to make a summer swoop.

FOOTBALL can relax. The Negotiator, Ian Doyle, has decided to pass
over the country's national sport.
The notion of dabbling in football passed through Doyle's mind and was
allowed to keep on going, which should come as a mighty relief to
chairmen, managers, and even players themselves. The world and attitudes
of many of these people would have changed beyond recognition had Doyle
decided to expand his managerial operations into Scottish football.
Instead Doyle, who has a business mind and an eye for an opportunity
which function as sharply as the cueing action of his protege, Stephen
Hendry, is easing into the world of golf and has just struck a
three-year deal with an emerging talent, Dean Robertson. ''Watch him,''
Doyle advises, ''he's only 24 but he's going to be big-time. Mark my
words.''
Others who may think they know better might sneer, but they would do
well to remember Doyle spoke the same way about Hendry when he was
unknown. ''Look at him now -- Stevie Wonder,'' says Doyle, a headline
writer's dream, but a man who should never, ever be underestimated.
The 55-year-old from Carntyne has been called many things in his life
and most of them even he would find it difficult to argue against, but
it would be unwise to approach Doyle believing him to be an easy touch
or some kind of innocent just because he seems to spend much of his time
in darkened snooker halls watching his Team Sweater Shop players.
In fact, only the other week, when Hendry was playing Ronnie
O'Sullivan in the quarter-finals of the Embassy World Snooker
Championship, Doyle had to retreat to an even darker room. He felt the
pressure build at a particular time in that contest and had to find a
place of his own within the bowels of the Crucible Theatre, eventually
finding a room which was no more than a cupboard, but which had a
television set inside.
Doyle sat inside, alone, watching the remainder of Hendry's match.
''At that time I had to get away from it all and focus on what was
happening,'' he admitted. Even hard-nosed businessmen like Doyle have
moments when they feel vulnerable, but they emerge from them stronger
people.
In the sporting world, especially at the sharp end where the big-money
deals are conducted, image is important and in that respect also Doyle
has what it takes. There is about him an air of confidence. His
sometimes world-weary, clean-cut demeanour and finely-tailored garb
suggest he has seen it all and done it all, too.
His speech comes in great all-encompassing passages and many of his
conversations quickly become sermons, and people listen when Doyle
talks, often because they are waiting for him to pause. They have been
known to wait for some time, some frozen out almost from start to
finish.
Doyle is one of these people who holds a view on most subjects and, if
in the course of a discussion he comes across a new field, he'll find a
way to link it to something about which he is aware. He probably talks
in his sleep, no doubt striding across his dream-scape driving hard
bargains and browbeating wayward clients.
''I've heard people say I'm a disciplinarian in the way that I handle
the players in Team Sweater Shop, but I like to think that if I'm
anything then it is professional, and that I've made Stephen the
professional that he is today.
''I've certainly taught him how to handle money, although he can
sometimes be embarrassed by his riches. Only the other day I told him
never to be embarrassed by his wealth, because he has earned every penny
of it.
''People don't realise that a typical day for Stephen can be 16 hours
long by the time his commercial work, practice, travelling, and playing
times are added up. There is absolutely no reason why he should be
embarrassed by whatever he has.''
What 26-year-old Hendry has is millionaire status and a burgeoning
business portfolio, and he would be the first to admit that his earnings
would never have been as healthy without Doyle's input. Hendry has the
skill and the desire to be the best snooker player the world has ever
seen, but Doyle has the ability to market the individual.
It is another misconception that Doyle himself has become wealthy
because of his share of Hendry's earnings. He had a successful hardware
business before he took the young snooker player under his wing, and
indeed, he is a millionaire in his own right, although the man who tells
Hendry not to be uncomfortable with wealth is coy about talking about
his own figures.
''I will admit to being a millionaire,'' he said, ''but how much am I
worth? How can I say? Any businesses and properties a person may have
are worth only what someone else is willing to pay for them.''
The business, built by Doyle and his partner of 30 years, Jim Marley,
includes the hardware operation which was started when each man put up
#500, property and leisure interests, black cabs in Glasgow, and Doyle
has also entered the world of television, selling sporting coverage
around the world via Trans-World International.
So far he has restricted this venture to snooker, but the intention is
to move into golf coverage and, of course, it would help if Robertson
lives up to Doyle's expectations. ''When he came to me asking if I would
take him on, I listened and it was like sitting in again with the young
Hendry,'' Doyle said.
''I'll move into golf, but before I do I'll go to as many major
tournaments as I can and learn as much as possible about the business,''
he added.
But what about the people's game? Why has Doyle -- whose son-in-law,
John Philliben, plays for Motherwell -- never entered into football?
''Simple,'' he said, ''there are too many hangers-on in that sport and
also there is a lack of professionalism in Scottish football. Sport is a
dirty business and the stars are not always properly looked after,
because too many of the people who should be looking after them enter
wondering what is in it for them.
''My snooker players are looked after better than any others and Dean
Robertson will be given the same treatment, but it would be too
difficult in football, because there are too few people who want to give
the time and dedication necessary.
''The indiscipline in football annoys me and I sometimes I get angry
that football is the main sport yet there are so many things wrong with
it. There is no skill, and that is because the game has neglected its
responsibilities.''
Doyle believes football does not learn from past mistakes and does
little for its sponsors, who have become necessary to the financial
well-being of the game. ''Listen, I could provide Bells with better
value than they are getting for their millions from football if they
came to me with even just half a million,'' he said.
''Sponsors of the game in general and club sponsors should be
demanding more, they should be telling managers that in return for the
cash, the players must behave with dignity and be available to the
press. This practice of banning players from talking to journalists is
ridiculous.
''Sometimes I wonder who they think they are. I think they should be
told that while they may be superstars at Ibrox or Parkhead, that's
about the extent of it.
''Scottish football has been too inward-looking when the real game is
being played elsewhere. For instance, I don't believe Walter Smith, who
has swept all before him in Scotland, can be judged until he has won on
the world stage and, in fact, Rangers are too big for the league in
which they are stuck.
''We used to be able to play, but not now -- and, please, I don't want
to hear we are doing all right for a small nation, because we are a
small nation in snooker also, but we could have three players in the
world's top six.''
Doyle insists Scottish snooker players are among the best because the
problems were addressed more than a decade ago, when the focus was on
England and a decision was taken to go out and open up to younger
players. The benefits are obvious every time Hendry, John Higgins, and
Alan McManus perform at their best.
Football, he says, should have been alive to its problems decades ago
instead of just waking up to them now. ''Ernie Walker has been appointed
to correct the wrongs, but was he not the same person who was secretary
of the SFA for a number of years?'' Doyle asks. ''Is this the way ahead?
''No thank you, but I'd just as soon stay out of football. I really
don't think it's for me.''
Hendry, a variety of business interests, and perhaps also the
satisfaction of shaping the golf career of Robertson will keep Doyle
ticking over, but it is a pity. He would have ruffled a few feathers and
brought some professionalism to the game. He might even have given some
players a little discipline.

ENGLISH clubs could be banned again from Europe if there is trouble at
next summer's European Championships, UEFA president Lennart Johansson
revealed yesterday.
He said: ''If it turns out badly, we will be back in the situation
where English clubs will be out of Europe. I am very concerned after the
violence which happened in Dublin and Brugge.
''Following talks with the English FA, I have been reassured that
everything possible will be done to have a perfect tournament. The
danger is not at the stadiums, where security will be strong, but in the
city centres.''
Speaking in Belgium, where the Under-16 championships were staged,
Johansson also discussed several other problems.
On the Champions' League, he said that any further profits raised from
sponsorship would not be spread among the clubs competing but instead be
handed to the national associations to distribute to those in need.
Rising debts, he said, left clubs vulnerable to the match-fixers
seeking to infiltrate the game.
''There is too much money involved,'' he insisted. ''There is a whole
industry behind football run by people who will do anything to win. This
is why the Colombian player was murdered after the World Cup -- his own
goal cost a certain person a lot of money.
''We must do something, and I will be recommending to the UEFA
congress that clubs be relegated from their premier divisions if they
cannot present a proper balance sheet, and promoted clubs will not go up
if they are in debt.
''This is the only way to prevent money from overtaking football. Too
many clubs are doing everything they can to win, without looking to see
if they have the money to do it. This cannot be tolerated any longer.''
Johansson said that UEFA may have acted prematurely in admitting
Croatia and the former Soviet countries to their ranks.
''Maybe we brought them in too soon, but we wished to prove that
football can bring people together. Maybe we were naive. What is
happening right now in Croatia is very worrying.
''UEFA would certainly never send teams there while the conflict
continues.
''That will present a big problem. When we decided to throw Yugoslavia
out of the European Championships and call in Denmark as their
replacement, there were threats against my life for three months.
''I am certain we will need the police outside our headquarters if the
same action is taken against Croatia.''
* AC MILAN have demanded a decision on the future of Marco Van Basten
this week. The Dutch striker has played just once in the past 30 months
because of an ankle injury.
A return is unlikely as his surgeon, the Belgian Marc Martens, said he
can do no more. However, if he comes back, he will play for Milan for
nothing next season, which is a condition of his contract covering
long-term absence.
His countryman Ronald Koeman has caused a rift within his family for
reneging on his agreement to join FC Groningen next season. Only last
month his father, Martin, the club's chief executive, had announced that
the Barcelona defender would finish his career there.
Instead he will now join Feyenoord, but admitted: ''I realise this is
a big disappointment for my father. It was an old dream to work with him
again, but nostalgia is not enough reason to return there. I had to do
what is best for me.''
* FOLLOWING the defeat by Deportivo la Coruna, Barcelona are now in
serious danger of failing to qualify for Europe. The prospect does
nothing for the humour of coach Johan Cruyff, facing his first season
without a trophy at the Nou Camp.
''Players have become spoiled with success,'' he insisted. ''That is
the reason for their poor form. Major changes will be made to freshen up
the team.''
* THE former Poland keeper, Jan Tomaszewski, lasted only three days in
charge LKS Lodz before being dismissed last week.
* PSV Eindhoven's plans to sell season tickets only to those
supporters who purchased shares in the club are now in turmoil. Their
fans, around 23,000 of them, reacted by showing red-cards to the
directors at last week's game against Heerenveen before walking out at
half-time, leaving the stadium deserted.

Motherwell 2, Kilmarnock 0
MOTHERWELL are just one point away from qualifying for Europe for the
third time in their history. They could even qualify for the UEFA Cup if
nearest rivals Hibernian fail to beat Celtic at Easter Road on Wednesday
night, but no matter what happens manager Alex McLeish, in his first
season at Fir Park, feels a lot has been accomplished.
After having watched his side comfortably ease past Kilmarnock on
Saturday, McLeish said: ''Even if they failed to make Europe, I'd still
be proud of them. They have proved time and time again this season that
they have the bottle -- they have responded when it mattered.''
In a season when Rangers have stormed off with the championship, only
Motherwell presented any sort of challenge, and, on their day, the Fir
Park men have produced arguably the best football of any side.
Long-term injuries to key players such as Tommy Coyne, Dougie Arnott,
Chris McCart, and Miodrag Krivokapic blunted the challenge, but if, as
expected, they do finish second, they will have deserved it.
Said McLeish: ''There is no point moaning about the injuries, because
every side gets them, but we were hit particularly hard. However, after
a sticky spell we have bounced back with three good wins over Aberdeen,
Rangers, and now Kilmarnock.
''Today we had a great result. It was a vital match for us, but my
players had an edge to them. They were ready and rose to the
challenge.''
None more so than little Dougie Arnott, who scored the first goal on
Saturday, and Tommy Coyne, who set up the second. Both were missing for
long spells at vital stages of the season, but despite that, they have
formed a deadly striking partnership.
Said Arnott: ''When Tommy joined the club at first it was difficult to
blend with him, but by playing and training together we now have a good
understanding. He's a very clever player and I think I've learned more
from him than he has from me.''
Arnott, who finished off a delightful move from Jamie Dolan, Billy
Davies, and Eddie May by slotting in the opening goal after 36 minutes,
thought that Motherwell had qualified for Europe when referee Herald
blew the final whistle. ''At half-time, we knew Hibs were losing to
Hearts, so at the end of our match we all gave the fans a wave, thinking
we had made it. However, when we got back to the dressing room, we found
out Hibs had won and things went a bit flat.
''Okay, we're not there yet, but if we have to get a result against
Hearts at Tynecastle next Saturday, we'll be ready for it.''
Motherwell's second goal killed off the match, and it was beautifully
set up by Coyne, who gave May a quality pass in the box, and the full
back -- ''I really shouldn't have been there'' -- beat Bobby Geddes with
a shot on the turn.
Afterwards Kilmarnock manager Alex Totten, wearing a plaster on his
hand, said: ''I burst my hand against the dressing room wall, so you can
take it I wasn't pleased with our performance. The better side won,
there's no doubt about that, and Motherwell deserve to be where they
are. Alex McLeish had a difficult job in following Tommy McLean, but he
has done magnificently in his first season as a manager.''

ASK someone to describe the perfect sportsman and a picture usually
emerges of a clear-eyed, lean, athletic, thoroughbred. Certainly the
image would not be of a 35-stone man sitting spread-eagled while trying
to touch his chest down on to a dirt floor. Cellulite probably wouldn't
be mentioned.
In the past few years the upsurge of interest in a wider range of
sport and the television coverage of some fringe activities has seen the
absurd and ridiculous brought to the screen. American football became
something of a cult and yesterday the Scottish Claymores took on their
English rivals, the London Monarchs, at Murrayfield. The razzmatazz is
far removed from the days of Tiger Tim at Parkhead, but for many the
intricacies of the actual game are a total mystery.
Recently hurling has had some coverage and for a while on a Saturday
morning there was a whole programme devoted to kabbadi, a kind of team
tig. Played largely in the Indian sub-continent, it seems to be akin to
Red Rover, Red Rover, let wee Jimmy come over.
The world tiddlywinks championships could be next for Match of the
Day.
In the days of black-and-white television people used to huddle round
their sets on a Saturday afternoon to watch the cult game of the time as
Mick MacManus hurled his opponents around the ring, and to marvel as
they merged from locks which would have troubled Harry Houdini. But
that, too, faded from the screens and wrestling only re-emerged as a
passing fad with the introduction of coverage of sumo wrestling bouts
from Japan.
This highly ritualistic sport, said by the Japanese to come from the
gods, is certainly for the seriously fat. Unkindly described as a game
for fat men in nappies it is, in fact, a graceful sport.
But Weight-Watchers would have a lean time looking for converts at the
15-day Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, which opened yesterday in Tokyo.
However, the kudos drives young hopefuls on.
Last month 115 boys entered a special training school dedicated to
providing the champions of the future. Only a handful of them will make
it to the top. For those who do, the rewards will be as large as for top
athletes anywhere: fame, fancy cars, and large sponsorship contracts.
Their training involves all manner of stretching and fighting
exercises. Wearing the traditional thick belt wrapped between their legs
and round their waists, they squat, and slap each other, then try to
touch the floor with their chests. Meanwhile, a group of older wrestlers
stalk them, pushing and smacking them with short bamboo sticks, scolding
and screaming encouragement.
After their three-hour workout the boys, usually 15 and 16-year-olds,
spend two more hours covering the basics of Japanese social studies and
the details of sumo rules and history. It's the only education many of
them are likely to get from now on. They have put their future in the
hands of a stablemaster who will promise to house, clothe, and very
importantly, feed them in exchange for their unquestioning loyalty.
The boys come from all kinds of backgrounds. One was recommended as a
prospect by the owner of his local eel restaurant. But it has become
increasingly difficult to recruit in recent years, as parents no longer
want to risk their children missing the final three years of public
education.
It must take a serious amount of sushi and rice for these boys to turn
into the bulky champions like Konishiki, the mountainous 43-stone
Hawaiian-born champion, familiarly known as Dumptruck, although he has
been out of form in the past two years because of excessive weight and
the curse of sumo wrestlers, bad knees.
The two highest-ranked wrestlers, Akebono and Takanohana, each will be
seeking their ninth title during the next fortnight as they display
their speed and strength.
Akebono, a mere 36-stoner from Hawaii, is favourite to emerge as
winner although, after haing been short-winded at a pre-tournament
public workout, he was urged to go on a diet, surely anathema for a sumo
star.
For the young hopefuls in training a life of privilege beckons with
success. But, for those who don't make it, a career as a kitchen helper
in restaurants owned by former sumo champions will be their reward. It's
unlikely there will be low-fat yogurt on the menu.

Hibernian 3, Hearts 1
JUST 24 hours before Hampden showed large gaps in the stands for
yesterday's Old Firm derby, the Edinburgh football fraternity also
turned its back on Hibernian and Hearts.
Saturday's match was one of the most important between the teams in
the past two decades, with Hibs chasing Europe and Hearts fighting for
their very survival.
Yet only 7140 paid to watch one of the more exciting games in a dreary
season, some 1300 short of an already slashed capacity due to
refurbishment work at Easter Road.
It was an appalling response to a game where Hibs claimed their third
victory over their city rivals this season and ended more than a decade
of derby disaster.
Alex Miller's players looked far enough ahead to embark on a period of
ascendancy in the fixture after 12 years of having to select a derby
night watering-hole with great care.
For Hearts their agenda is much less appealing. There is something
badly amiss at the whole club at a time when the future looks fraught
with danger.
There is precious little spirit about the team, which is costing them
dearly, after they existed sometimes entirely on togetherness during
their rapid progress in the 80s.
Although never at any time matching the variety and speed of Hibs'
play, Hearts edged into the second half still leading by David Hagen's
header in 34 minutes, having absorbed Hibs' best efforts.
However, as soon as Mickey Weir headed Miller's team level in 62
minutes, the resilience evaporated from the Hearts players. Two further
goals followed from Keith Wright and the impressive Kevin Harper, all
inside seven astonishing minutes.
With confidence so brittle and heads so ready to droop, first-division
aspirants will swiftly choose the Edinburgh team as play-off opponents,
were such a selection available.
Two moments swung the game Hibs' way. One featured Jim Leighton, at 36
the oldest player on the pitch, and the other involved 19-year-old
Harper, the youngest man playing.
After 59 minutes, John Robertson pulled the ball back to Hagen eight
yards out and Leighton dived and stretched low to his left, to concede a
corner and deprive Hearts of a two-goal lead.
Three minutes later, substitute Harper, who had replaced Kevin
McAllister, crossed from the left to engineer the Weir goal, and
eventually claimed the third for himself to kill the contest.
''Kevin certainly turned the match our way. The timing of his runs and
his pace caused the Hearts players problems, and we never looked back
from the equaliser,'' reflected Wright.
''Now we'll all be Hearts fans for the day next Saturday and hope they
get themselves out of trouble and do us a favour against Motherwell at
Tynecastle.
''We have Celtic in midweek and if we can win that, we end up at
Kilmarnock on the last day.
''But even taking six points, we would need Hearts to draw at least.''
It has been an astonishing first season for chairman Chris Robinson,
who must find some way of pulling every Hearts man in Edinburgh together
for one last push on Saturday.
But first he must gather each member of the staff at Tynecastle around
him, and try to bring some kind of team spirit to 90 minutes that will
be the longest and most anguished of his life.
The squabbles with former chairman Wallace Mercer and mid-season
disagreement with Tommy McLean now attain some perspective.
Hearts are in deep water without a lifebelt. The chairman has six days
to find one.

TO FIRHILL to laze on a sun-drenched terracing and watch Partick
Thistle complete their Harry Houdini trick of avoiding relegation. Vital
end-of-season games up Maryhill way usually end up a 0-0 draw and are
rarely enjoyable.
Fortunately, there's often other diversions at Firhill. Like reading
John Lambie's address to the fans in the match programme. His article,
on the trials and tribulations of the past few months, carries the
headline ''My heid's buzzled.''
Reaching for our Scots dictionary we find the verb to buzzle:
''Pertaining to grain crops; to rustle, indicating readiness to be
carted home.''
Pondering the merits of Mr Lambie getting carted, I went for a
perambulation around the terracing, a rare treat in these post-Taylor
Report days.
The home terracing at Firhill is now crowned with a very smart brick
building which, from my previous vantage points in the stand, I had
assumed to be some sort of Pizza Hut or Burger King premises furnishing
fast-food delicacies to the fans. Closer inspection revealed no hatches
for serving food but plenty of wire-meshing around it. Had John Lambie
built himself an executive doocot? No.
Even closer inspection revealed that it is a police station where the
boys in blue sit in great comfort watching video screens to ensure that
none of the fans has smuggled in a can of Irn-Bru in contravention of
the Criminal Justice (Keep The Fans Thirsty While The Boys In The
Executive Boxes Are Drowning In Champagne) (Scotland) Act of 1986.
Food is, in fact, being dispensed from a van offering, among other
delicacies, chips, and curry sauce. The operatives wear T-shirts with
the slogan ''007 Catering. Licensed to Grill.''
Firhill for Grills, I mused as the Tannoy began playing an extremely
dreary song called Firhill for Thrills.
Strange minds think alike. The match programme has an advert for the
Lex Audi motor people. Their slogan is ''Firhill for Grilles.''
On the field it is certainly not Firhill for Skills. A couple of magic
touches from Mo Johnson and that was it. But the Thistle fans were
well-pleased to be free finally of the threat of relegation. No more
need for all that painful post-match mental arithmetic over a pint in
Munns Vaults.
On to Hampden for the Old Firm match and to sample the hospitality
suite courtesy of Brian Gilda, even though I did not buy my last car
from his Peoples garage.
At the lunch, the fish dish is something called Delice of Salmon
Condorrat. The origin of this dish is obscure until someone recalls that
Celtic chairman Fergus McCann was born and brought up near Condorrat.
The wee man is even making his personality felt on the menu.
Still on the food front, we read in the programme that Pierre van
Hooydonk loves chicken curry. ''This is my favourite food and I eat it
before a game,'' he says. Which might explain why he finds himself with
so much space in the opposing defence.
Despite the victory over Rangers and the prospect of winning the
Tennents Scottish Cup in two weeks' time, some of the well-heeled Celtic
supporters are worried about next season. Most of them have bought
shares in the club and are about to be issued with green blazers.
At a recent meeting, an investor asked Fergus McCann if the blazers
were compulsory. Some are afraid to wear the jaikets in case they look
like a phalanx (I think that was the word used) of Michael Kellys.

SECOND DIVISION
ANY doubt about whether manager Allan McGraw would keep his promise
and resign if Morton failed to win promotion was settled on Saturday
when they deservedly beat Dumbarton 2-0 to clinch the championship.
However, one has to sympathise with Sons' player-manager Murdo MacLeod
over the manner of the first goal.
Cappielow was a scene of joy as many of the division's record crowd of
6242 invaded the pitch to acclaim their heroes.
But McGraw confessed to relief rather than joy. ''It's been a long,
hard season,'' he said, ''and we've had times of doubt. Before today's
game, this was the most nervous I've been in 30 years with this club.''
Home keeper David Wylie was forced into a superb reflex save after
only 13 minutes but thereafter Dumbarton raids about as scarce as Tory
council leaders, and the breakthrough came after 64 minutes in
controversial circumstances.
Morton skipper Derek McInnes won an aerial duel on halfway and his
headed pass released Marko Rajamaki. Defender Jim Marsland's tackle was
judged by referee Martin Clark to be a penalty, and Derek Lilley made no
mistake with a low right-foot kick.
Whether the tackle was fair or not was difficult to tell. It did show
just how hard it is for a retreating defender to tackle from behind
without fouling -- or allowing the attacker to take the soft option and
go down.
The points were sealed three minutes from time when Marsland left a
through ball to keeper Ian McFarlane, who, challenged dubiously on the
edge of the area by Rowan Alexander -- the substitute jumped at him --
hit his clearance off defender Steve Gow and the ball broke to Rajamaki.
The skilful Finn chipped perfectly from 30 yards.
The Sons have another chance next weekend, when they visit Stirling in
a straight fight for the second promotion place, but now Albion need
only a draw following their 2-0 home win that killed off Clyde through
second-half shots by John Gibson and Joe McLeod.
Steve Ramsay's shot and a Duncan Campbell header guaranteed Queen of
the South's survival, sentenced Jim Leishman's Meadowbank to relegation,
and ended the promotion hope of Queens' visitors, Berwick. Gavin Price's
header equalised Robert Scott's nod for East Fife at Brechin.

DIEGO Maradona has said that he is resigning as coach of Argentinian

The former Argentine World Cup-winning captain told reporters that he
was quitting because Racing Club president Juan Destefano lost the
election in which he was seeking a third term.
Maradona had warned earlier that he would quit if Destefano was not
re-elected. The outgoing Racing Club president lost his re-election bid

THE drive from Europe to see land taken out of food production and
devoted to other purposes could change the face of the countryside --
although perhaps not always for the better.
It is already changing the English language. The agricultural world is
especially prone to the use of acronyms and Dr Graham Dalton of the
Scottish Agricultural College has come up with two which were new to me.
One was AFE (alternative farm enterprise) but the second was more
puzzling -- OGA -- which we now know stands for ''other gainful
activity''.
Dr Dalton was speaking at a workshop organised by the Scottish Land
Use Association to consider ways of ''widening the economic base of the
countryside'' for which, as yet, no acronym has been suggested.
In a close study of 200 farms in Argyll and Caithness, Dr Dalton did
not come up with a range of original, sure-fire, money-making schemes.
He did conclude at one point, however: ''If you were rational you
wouldn't farm, and make a lot more money.'' In his view farming was no
longer as competitive with other sectors as it once was.
The biggest money-spinner his computer programme suggested was the
creation of golf courses -- estimated to offer the prospect of profits
of #200,000. The downside to that, of course, is that even in the most
suitable of locations there is probably only room for one new golf
course. At a more humble level the bed-and-breakfast market is not
unlimited. One new entrant can mean reduced profits all round.
However, the development of alternative sources of income can lead to
less intensive farming and it does have the advantage of reducing a
reliance on subsidies, for which the farming community is often
criticised. In his computer programme Dr Dalton, who heads the SAC
agriculture and rural economics department in Aberdeen, found that the
existence of subsidies did not make a huge difference.
His own view was that subsidies could deter some farmers from taking
risks in areas which did not attract support. A case, perhaps, of
''always keeping hold of nurse for fear of finding something worse''.
Hill farmers in particular could not afford to take financial risks.
Many of them, he found, were poor people who did not have as much
resources as was tied up in a modern tractor. The biggest risk of all,
he suggested, was to do nothing.
One area of disagreement did open up between Dr Dalton, who saw
cashmere goats as only a marginal possibility for diversification, and
Dr Angus Russell of the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute who is an
advocate of cashmere and fine wool production as alternatives for the
Scottish hillside.
It was very difficult for any new venture to compete with existing
high levels of support, said Dr Russell. His suggestion was that farmers
should have the option to transfer existing subsidy from sheep or cattle
to goats. He calculated that a national herd of two million breeding
females could produce all the cashmere needed for the UK textile
industry, worth about #100m a year. Instead of seizing this initiative
Scotland was in danger of losing out to Greece, Italy, Spain and
Portugal where annual premiums were payable on both sheep and goats, he
said.
In her closing remarks, Mrs Marina Dennis, who works a family croft at
Nethy Bridge in Strathspey, took issue with the use of the word
subsidies in an agricultural context. She preferred the word payment.
The people who had planted the spring bulbs blooming all over Aberdeen
had been paid by the council to do so. No-one said they had been
subsidised, she argued. The same attitude should be adopted towards
farmers who cared for the countryside.
She had her own little personal observation on diversification into
tourism. Tenants at her holiday cottage were always presented with free
range eggs on arrival but they never came back to purchase more. The
reason was that they arrived well stocked up from their supermarket at
home and consequently gave little custom to local shops.
Ostriches, which are causing some excitement as a new source of farm
income, were never mentioned. Neither was the creation of smokehouses to
give added value to wild venison from the hill. Leo Barclay of Rannoch
is making a success on that front.
The bank holiday last Monday, I know, proved a bumper day for another
diversification project -- the wildlife centre at Auchingarrich in the
hills above Comrie, which has been created on a former hill sheep farm.
Owner Nigel Carter, when I saw him, had counted 500 people through the
cafe by late afternoon with more cars still rolling in. His success, of
course, means that anyone else who wants to change land use in that area
has to come up with something different.

Celtic 3, Rangers 0
CLEARLY, with their manager, Walter Smith, out of town most of last
week in pursuit of Paul Gascoigne, Rangers' players obviously thought
holiday time had arrived and, in fact, they played like tourists in an
environment for the first time as they wandered around Hampden Park
while Celtic ran away with the points.
Of course, with a seventh consecutive championship safely back in the
Ibrox trophy room, Rangers had no real need of more points, but pride
alone should have stirred them to greater effort than they produced
yesterday.
Billy Thomson didn't so much give up as capitulate when he was
dismissed after having fouled Brian McLaughlin nine minutes from time.
The Celtic winger was about to round the keeper when he was hauled down,
leaving referee Les Mottram with only one choice.
Celtic, of course, have much to play for yet and their comfortable
triumph in the season's final Old Firm game will strengthen their
confidence for the Tennents Scottish Cup final against Airdrie on May
27, when the atmosphere at Hampden will be much more charged than it was
yesterday.
Only 31,025 supporters showed up, which suggested Rangers' fans also
had decided the season was over, while a number of Celtic's followers
will be conserving energies and money for the cup final.
Those who stayed away missed little in the first half with Celtic
reserving their best for the second period, during which they scored all
of their goals, with Pierre van Hooydonk leading the way. His goal was
his seventh for Celtic and he was especially pleased, since he was
making his Old Firm debut.
The two other goals came courtesy of an own goal by Craig Moore and a
25-yard free kick from Rudi Vata.
It was a pass from McStay early in the match which first brought
Celtic's followers to their feet, and his precise delivery found Simon
Donnelly, who touched shoulders with Alan McLaren. The Rangers man went
down, leaving the young striker clear inside the box. However, his shot
was poor and Thomson had only to drop down and smother the ball.
Pat Bonner's task in grasping Mark Hateley's swerving shot from just
outside the penalty box was equally straightforward, but the ease with
which the striker had escaped Brian O'Neil was alarming.
Collins might have found the net first after he had intercepted a
poorly directed pass by Alex Cleland, but the midfield player, who ran
unchallenged to the edge of the box, shot a yard wide.
John Brown, who body-checked McLaughlin and was booked, injured
himself in the process and hobbled off, with Neil Murray pressed into
action after 27 minutes.
O'Neil became the second player booked after he had tripped Laudrup
and then the Dane had to suffer a degree of ridicule after he had tried
a back-heel pass which went wrong. Celtic's fans jeered him roundly, but
he took it all in good humour, bowing to them almost apologetically.
Such banter is unusual in Old Firm matches, but it added to the
peculiarity of the atmosphere of this one.
However, it became much more like the real thing five minutes into the
second half when Celtic scored a splendid goal, engineered by the
diminutive McLaughlin, who had darted through Rangers' defence on the
left. The winger looked up and rolled the ball across the edge of the
18-yard line to van Hooydonk, who beat Thomson to his right with a low
shot.
Suddenly Celtic's fans were ecstatic and 10 minutes later they were
lifted to even greater heights of joy when Craig Moore hooked the ball
into his own net. Simon Donnelly had been released on the right by
McStay and when his cross curled into Rangers' box, the unfortunate full
back, whose balance was all wrong, tried to clear but turned the ball
into Thomson's net.
Five minutes later Donnelly limped off and Willie Falconer took over,
and soon afterwards Rangers took off Ian Ferguson and sent on
Mikhailichenko. Celtic's second substitution was made 15 minutes from
the end when Phil O'Donnell relieved van Hooydonk.
Rangers may have felt two goals was to be the extent of their
punishment but Rudi Vata added to the misery by scoring from a direct
free kick 25 yards from goal nine minutes from the end. Cleland had
handled the ball and Vata surprised everyone, including himself, by
beating Thomson with a low shot which crept in low at the keeper's
left-hand post.
Thomson was probably relieved when the referee sent him off for his
foul on McLaughlin.

THERE has been no snow for a week and spring is here. The first
blackbird's nest is hatched, the pheasants are hard at it, the elm trees
are in flower and we are already heartily sick of rhubarb.
Dodd is away on his holidays. Gowkie always borrows my bull for a
three-week warm-up before he goes in among our cows on the first of
June. But Gowkie has only six cows at the moment and when we let Dodd
out of the float he looked a bit disappointed. He seemed to be thinking:
''There must be more to life than this.''
I hope it will make him all the more eager when he comes home.
The cows are all out and very happy about it. For all they have done
well on the treated straw, it isn't the same as spring grass. They have
38 calves, only two of which I saw being born. There were two losses and
two sets of twins so we look set for 100%. I will make my quota of 39.6
if 1.6 calves are born alive to the remaining two heifers and a cow.
Last year's bull calves did me proud at Thainstone on Friday. The
oldest was just 13 months old and yet I got a top of #700 for a pure
Simmental bull. Only two of them had made half-a-tonne, but still I was
pleased with my treated straw. As long as we can grow cereals and sell
it, I can't see how we can ever make silage again.
Top price per kilo was ''only'' 139p but they were carrying a good bit
of liveweight, which is code for ''they had full bellies'' and the
butcher doesn't give much for gut-fill.
The 23 bulls all went to their new home in the one float, for they
were all bought by John Fowlie of Aberdour House.
My last week's buyer having left before I got to him with my
luckpenny, I took my time over going to speak to him. There was no such
luck this time so I slipped a note into his pocket and said: ''That's
the price of your dinner.''
''Oh, that's fine now. I'm going to Thainstone House as it happens.''
Now, I know a man who complains that he was charged 10p for an ice
cube when he went to a wedding there recently so I don't suppose you get
in the door for a fiver.
I had to explain that I had had the mart cafe in mind when I selected
the note. In fact, I only had two notes with me and I needed lunch
myself.
Anyway, Mr Fowlie and I then worked it out that we had spent #350 on
commission to the mart for arranging this deal. Not only that but I had
to take them to market in an expensive float, and they would have passed
Little Ardo on their way home to New Aberdour. Then again, with 3000
cattle there from all over Scotland who knows what the cattle might have
picked up at the mart?
Surely, two neighbours could get together, fix a price, split the
commission, and take one float journey between our farms. We resolved to
at least look at that for next year.
But I would be sad not to get to the mart to sell. It is fine to
expose your stock to the ridicule of your neighbours, and it is a chance
to get off the place, for it is often lonely on a farm nowadays.
This last two weeks I have enjoyed meeting the Irishman at the mart.
He has a good sense of humour and, having given Mossie a king's ransom
for his outfarm, he needs it.
It turns out the Irishman is new to what we would call farming. He has
made it thus far by spending his time looking at cattle in auction
markets until he can tell the weight of dangleberries on housed cattle
from 50 yards. He must have bought cheap and sold dear to build enough
credit to buy from Mossie, and he still hasn't sold his 40 acres in
Ireland.
He was bowled over by the sheer scale of it when he came to see
Mossie's farm. When he'd arrived Mossie had ordered the Irishman's wife
to look at the house and told yer man to jump in. Then he drove like a
maniac right into the middle of a 145-acre ''paddock''. The Irishman,
used to the big field being one that was one-and-a-half acres, got a bad
attack of agoraphobia.
''I was sinking down into my seat and putting a wee prayer that he
wouldn't ask me how many acres I had in Ireland. If I'd had to tell him
that, he'd have put me out, right in the middle of that paddock. In 145
acres of rape about that high, I'd never have found my way out.''
And he discovered another thing about Mossie. The truth varies
depending on whether he's buying or selling. ''When I was looking at the
place he had two main words: 'It's a show' and 'It's tops'. But as soon
as I had her bought he had another much longer word: 'disaaaster'.''
And the Irishman has a lot more to learn before he makes a right job
of his new farm. Mossie's doing his best to help with the growing of the
winter barley and rape. He's giving him all the good advice he has been
giving me, but at least I was brought up to expect crops to cost
something to grow.
He told the Irishman the other day: ''You'll need to get on and spray
your crops. You've got every disease except BSE in there.''
''But, did I not spray them in the autumn?'' said the Irishman,
aghast. ''And did it not cost a fortune? Don't tell me I have to spray
them again.''
''It's a disaaaster, but it's up to you. You dinna need to spray your
crops unless you intend staying on for another year.''

<HEADLINE>Argyll chairman calls into question quality image of Scotch beef</HEADLINE>

THE quality image of Scottish beef has been called into question by
supermarket chief Sir Alistair Grant in evidence to the Scottish Affairs
Committee's investigation on the future for Scottish agriculture.
Producers had been relying on a somewhat outdated and historic concept
of quality Scotch beef and the tag now had little real significance in
the marketplace, he said.
This was a result of bringing in imported breeds to replace native
stock. Scotch beef would never be a true premium product unless there
was agreement on core breeds and how these should be developed.
Sir Alistair, a registered Aberdeen-Angus member with two animals,
said Scotland should take a lesson from the Burgundy area of France
where only Charolais cattle were seen. It would be pleasing to see
Belted Galloways, Galloways and Angus cattle throughout Scotland.
Ayr MP Phil Gallie asked how much responsibility supermarkets had in
influencing beef trends. Sir Alistair, who is chairman of the Argyll
Group which includes Safeway and Presto, admitted that in the early days
supermarkets were essentially appealing to younger shoppers, their fads
and fancies. Now they were appealing to all ages.
Rob Murdy, assistant managing director, agreed that the move towards
lean beef had been driven by the American influence but the company was
now experimenting more with traditional breeds such as Angus and
Hereford. There was no doubt that Angus were incredible for taste and
flavour.
However, Colin Smith, Tesco's commercial director with responsibility
for meat and fresh produce, disagreed. Scottish beef and other meat
products still enjoyed an undeniable demand. This had been proved by the
group's success with the Scotch label now seen in over 200 of its
stores.
Breed was far less important than treatment of the animal after
slaughter, he said. The post-slaughter handling regime led to improved
guarantees on eating quality.
While both groups, who control nearly one-third of the Scottish market
between them, claimed to source as much as possible from Scotland, they
also differed on their preferred buying methods.
Sir Alistair said they preferred to deal with powerful suppliers and
he was enthused by the idea of farmers giving more muscle through group
formation.
Colin Smith, on the other hand, condemned farmer co-operatives as an
alien culture to British farmers and said the company would continue to
deal as far as possible with processors.

THE relegation battle, which was expected to be decided over the past
two weeks, will now go to the last premier-division games of the season.
And, as Tynecastle manager Tommy McLean forecast last week, his club
remain in danger after the Aberdeen revival.
Six points for the Dons, from Hearts and then Dundee United, have
dragged the Edinburgh side back into danger and condemned the Tannadice
team to the play-off at best.
Aberdeen now are two points clear of their New Firm rivals at the
bottom and two points behind Hearts. And Roy Aitken, the Pittodrie
acting manager, maintains: ''I have always believed that we would be
able to escape the drop. We have had our rewards over the past two games
but, honestly, we have been playing well for some time.
''We have earned the improvement and the squad effort has been
fantastic. I cannot talk too highly about my players.''
If Aberdeen beat Falkirk, and Hearts and Dundee United lose, the
Pittodrie men are safe. If Hearts win, Aberdeen and United will face
relegation or the play-offs.
United's recently appointed manager, Billy Kirkwood, has the toughest
job of all. And he knows that. So do his players, and defender Jim
McInally admitted after the 2-0 defeat from Aberdeen: ''It looks as if
we need a miracle.''
In the first division, the last day will be equally intense, with
Dunfermline and Dundee still capable of pipping Raith Rovers for the
title and even for a play-off place.

RANGERS were alerted to the possibility of Paul Gascoigne being
allowed to leave Lazio six weeks ago and, as always in these situations,
the Ibrox club moved swiftly into action.
Manager Walter Smith went to Rome to see Lazio take on Roma in the
city derby game and, with that visit, he let it be known to the Italians
that there was interest at Ibrox in the wayward English genius.
That is the way business begins in these massive transfer deals, a
kind of ritual dance between the selling club and the potential big
spenders.
When the Scottish champions were eventually given the nod from Lazio,
Smith and Rangers chairman David Murray immediately set up the crucial
meetings with the Italian club.
They took place secretly in London with Lazio president Dino Zoff --
the man who took Gascoigne to Italy when the former Italian goalkeeper
was manager of Lazio -- and the major shareholder Sergio Cragnotti, over
a two-day period.
The most important aspect of these discussions was for Smith and
Murray to convince the Italians that they meant business.
They did that and it was then that the Ibrox men were given permission
to make an official approach to the player.
Smith jetted to Italy to handle the person-to-person talks with the
player he met on holiday in Phoenix, Arizona, a couple of years back.
The Ibrox manager told close friends then that he had been impressed
by Gascoigne and that he had found him quite unlike his tabloid image.
That may have been an influence on the Ibrox thinking when the
decision to make their move for the player was made.
But, while the preliminaries have gone well for the Glasgow giants,
there is a lot of talking still to take place.
Gascoigne, like most top players, will be guided by his advisers.
They will put together a signing package and then Rangers will become
involved in the heavy bargaining which goes on behind the scenes.
Last season it was Smith who convinced Brian Laudrup that he could
resurrect his career with Rangers.
Now his persuasive powers will be put to use again.
Gascoigne had to come into the frame as a possible summer sgning when
other options were closed off.
There had been suggestions that Dutch star Denis Bergkamp was the main
target.
But the former Ajax striker has opted to remain at Internazionale, who
will reward him with a #27,000-a-week salary.
When that door closed, then another opened, and Gascoigne was the
player who stood on the threshold.
The next few weeks will decide whether he walks through the double
doors of Ibrox and into the welcoming marble halls.
In the past, Rangers have always been able to see off opposition from
England when they want a player.
You would bet on them doing that again!

A NEW report on the risks associated with the use of organophosphorus
sheep dips has been dismissed as ''fundamentally flawed'' and given a
not proven verdict by industry leaders. .
The report, compiled by the Institute of Occupational Health and
published in The Lancet, compared the health of 1540 sheep farmers and
workers using the dips with a control group of quarry workers.
This showed there were no differences in short or long-term memory or
learning capacity between the two groups although sheep dippers took
slightly longer to perform tasks requiring sustained attention and
mental activity.
The report brought an angry reaction from Paul Tyler, the Liberal
Democrat farming spokesman, with a call for immediate action from
Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave to help speed up compensation
for those workers who claim they have suffered ill health due to
exposure to the dips.
But Karl Linklater, director of the Scottish Agricultural College
Veterinary Services, said he felt the report indicated a ''not proven''
verdict.
''I still have an open mind on the subject after seeing the report. I
would also add that from the point of view of animal welfare this
chemical is extremely important,'' he said.
There were a great many other imponderables to be examined before any
hard and fast conclusion could be drawn.
For example, he said the research had not considered the role of other
compounds, such as endotoxins formed in the dip solution, in causing
symptoms.
''Medically speaking, no-one really knows what the chronic effects
are.''

IT WAS a stern-faced Rangers manager who confirmed yesterday that a
fee has been agreed with Lazio for the transfer of Paul Gascoigne.
Walter Smith hopes to conclude an audacious piece of business when he
meets soon with agents acting on behalf of the wayward England
internationalist. The signs suggest Rangers are close to striking a
deal.
Smith is prepared to pay #4m for the 27-year-old, even though he has a
history of injury and has often behaved off the field as though he has
yet to mature into adulthood. However, Smith was unwilling to discuss
the fragility of Gascoigne's temperament or talk of his medical record.
''Rangers have agreed a fee with Lazio for Paul Gascoigne, who is a
player I like and who is available,'' he said. ''I met him last Friday
and spoke to him about joining Rangers, but I have still to meet with
his agents.''
Smith was talking after having watched his team produce a lacklustre
performance in the 3-0 defeat by Celtic. He was disturbed by his
players' lack of determination even though they have already won the
championship.
The determination on show at Hampden came from Celtic, whose manager
Tommy Burns said: ''We played as Celtic players should. With our hearts
and our heads.''
Rangers had no-one with the inspirational qualities of a Gascoigne,
but the team should still have given more to their fans, who tend to
fret for long periods over defeats by the ancient enemy.
It is into this environment that Smith and his chairman, David Murray
wish to introduce Gascoigne, who has undoubted ability, but is in danger
of failing to use it to the greatest effect.
Before it became clear Gascoigne was their target, players such as
Dennis Bergkamp and Jurgen Klinsmann were linked with Rangers, but they
are on much better deals with their clubs, Inter Milan and Tottenham
Hotspur respectively. Bergkamp is thought to be on #27,000 a week with
Klinsmann on #21,000.
Gascoigne doesn't earn significantly more than Rangers' top players,
which is why the Ibrox club made their move. Of course, the player would
demand a massive signing-on fee, but stories of the club offering him
mansions and rambling country estates as incentives can be dismissed.
''I don't know the people who write these stories,'' Smith said
dismissively.
Gascoigne, of course, may have given indications that he would be
willing to sign for Rangers, but Smith has been involved in enough deals
to understand that if another club move in with a better offer, all bets
would be off.
The same situation could confront Celtic in their bid to sign the
Belgian, Marc Degryse.
Parkhead supremo Fergus McCann has made a hush-hush visit to Brussels
for talks with Anderlecht and their skipper about the proposed #1.3m
transfer.
The signing of Degryse has become a major priority for Celtic and when
there were indications that several Continental clubs were also ready to
move in, McCann jetted to the Belgian capital.
I was told from Belgium last night: ''Marc is still looking towards a
move to Celtic. Fergus McCann was in Brussels for talks and so far Marc
has been impressed with everything he has been told about the Glasgow
club.
''Anderlecht, however, are waiting to see what is on offer from Paris
St Germain. There have been suggestions that Brazilian star Rai could be
offered in exchange and that interests Anderlecht.
''Celtic remain the first choice for the player. But if Anderlecht
qualify for the European Cup again, they may look on a swop deal with
Rai as being more important.''
Degryse, 29, insists he is unhappy at the lack of ambition shown by
his club. Celtic, certainly have ambition and while their fans wait and
wonder what big names will be coming to Parkhead, they at least went
home happy yesterday.
That is a situation that delights manager Burns, who said after the
Hampden victory: ''I was especially pleased for the supporters. They
have been loyal, even though we have taken them on an emotional
roller-coaster this season.
''But I have to wonder why we can produce this kind of performance
against Rangers and be so inconsistent against others.
''The players have to realise they must produce their best in
bread-and-butter games also if they are to be successful. They are
judged game by game, but winning the Scottish Cup would help remove one
particular monkey from our backs.''
Burns was referring to the pressures which have come to rest on
Celtic's players because the club have gone five years without a trophy.

BEER consumption in Britain is falling sharply notwithstanding
marketing gimmicks aimed at stimulating sales -- widgets that make
canned beer foam like draught ale, ice in the brewing process that lures
with the joint promise of cool refreshment and state-of-the-art fashion
in a bottle.
In the past 15 years, beer sales in Britain -- draught as well as
canned and bottled beers for home consumption -- have fallen by 15%.
In Europe, as a whole, beer sales are flat, while, in America, beer
drinking has dropped by around 3% in the past decade.
To help buck the trend and put a head back on profits Britain's
brewers are now looking to expand Third World markets -- largely
untapped by the heavyweights of the brewing industry as long as the
thirst of a native drinking public with little to spend was by and large
slaked by home brew and boot-leg liquor.
Now the Indian Government, concerned at the loss of duty from the
official sale of beer as well as the health risk posed by boot-leg
products with a legacy more deadly than a mere hangover, has turned to a
Scottish university to supply brewing expertise, teach its brewers the
tricks of the trade and put India's beer consumption on the up and up.
Heriot-Watt University's International Centre for Brewing and
Distilling has been signed up to put a sparkle into the Indian beer
trade by ensuring that what goes out from the local breweries is well
worth drinking.
At present Indians scarcely drink beer at all -- officially at any
rate. In Britain last year the 55-million strong population poured down
a cool 40,000,000 hectolitres of the stuff whereas India's teeming
masses, 900,000,000 at the last count, managed scarcely a tenth of that
-- notwithstanding summer temperatures steadily in the nineties.
Professor Graham Stewart, director of the ICBD at Heriot-Watt
University, explained the five-year contract between his department and
the new Indian School of Malting and Brewing at Mysore: ''The idea
behind it is to legitimise brewing. Not only is there a huge loss of
duty but some of the boot-leg beers made in India are very dubious --
more methanol than ethanol.
''The value in this from our standpoint is prestige, we are clearly
recognised as a centre of excellence. We will go out there about twice a
year to keep an eye on the course once we have set it up this summer.''
The market for beer in India, according to Professor Stewart, is
almost without limit. ''Seventy per cent of the population is Hindu and
they suffer no restriction on the consumption of beer. That makes for a
huge potential market and the mere fact that so many millions of people
drink just a tenth part of what is consumed here in Britain shows
clearly how much room there is for an expansion of the legitimate
brewing industry.''
The product which the Indians will be taught to produce to win the
market -- with every major brewer waiting in the wings -- will be
lager-type beer with the Heriot-Watt University's experts concentrating
on consistency, stability of product and a longer shelf life. The heat
in India, said Professor Stewart, can leave some beer with a stale
taste.
''In many ways the long-term potential for beer in India is greater
than China -- certainly from the standpoint of the long-term investor.
There are strong links to Britain in India -- the Raj, the language, the
law -- that make the whole thing run more smoothly,'' he said.
The Heriot-Watt University team will have a direct involvement in the
Mysore project for the first five years and will arrange for an external
examiner. There will be about 20 students at a time and the courses will
run for nine months although there will also be two-week sessions for
those already in the brewing industry. No figures of the cost of the
university's involvement or the fees it will receive are being given.
Heriot-Watt University has an almost century old link with the brewing
and distilling industries -- its International Centre for Brewing and
Distilling being set up eight years ago.
In addition to the techniques required for the brewing of good beer
the students at the Mysore school will also be taught about the base
materials required. Barley is already grown in some parts of India but
hops and malt are widely imported. New maltings are now being built.
Also on his way to India from Heriot-Watt University this summer will
be Professor Geoff Palmer who will advise on cereal biochemistry and
physiology. Malt, an essential ingredient of beer, has a history in
Scotland every bit as intoxicating as the beer it goes into, said
Professor Palmer.
''The astonishing thing is that the Scots, though prepared to sign the
Treaty of Union in 1707, absolutely refused for many years after that to
agree to the malt tax. It is as if they valued their beer more than
their nationhood.
''The malt tax remained a bone of contention simply because given the
inferior barley used in the malting process in Scotland brewers here
would have been at a disadvantage. Only barley was allowed and the tax
was levied not on the quantity of beer made but on the quantity of malt
used to make it,'' he said.
''The Scots, for good scientific reasons, said 'no'. The bald truth
was that their barley was inferior and they knew they were on a hiding
to nothing with it. With the malt tax volume equalled weight and that is
where the Scots drew the line.''
It became a major issue and there were riots in Glasgow. During one of
these a local MP, a Mr Campbell, had his house burned to the ground by
the mob. Said Professor Palmer: ''The Government compensated him with
the then enormous sum of #7000 with which he bought the island of
Islay.''
Eventually the malt tax was imposed in Scotland and remained in place
until 1880, a strict rule being that all adjuncts -- for example, maize,
rice, sorgum, in fact, any cereal with starch -- were banned from the
mash tun.
''Then Prime Minister Gladstone got rid of the malt tax and maize,
wheat, anything you liked, could be put in the mash tun. After that
Scottish brewing took off,'' said Professor Palmer.
Gladstone's interest in the plight of Scottish brewers labouring under
the iniquities of the malt tax may not have been unconnected, says
Professor Palmer, with his family's links to the Border town of Biggar
where relatives grew barley.
Beer, he maintains, is much more than a drink. ''In many cases it
reflects the nature of a culture -- bound up with its production is the
history of social scientific developments.''
Of the Indian project, Professor Stewart, for many years in the
brewing industry in Canada, said: ''Our collaboration with the Indian
Government in this is really exciting for us as well as being
recognition of where we stand in the esteem of the brewing industry
worldwide. The potential for Indian brewing is enormous.''

THE annual meeting is drawing to a close. The chairman has made his
statement and the routine business is moving along.
Directors are re-elected, the board is given authority to fix the fee
for the auditors, the report and accounts are received and the final
dividend is approved.
Although many directors maintain that the annual meeting is a
highly-important occasion one suspects that they go on parade
reluctantly viewing the occasion as something of a waste of time and
seldom expecting anything of significance to happen.
Most have fairly small shareholdings themselves but they know that the
weight of the institutional shareholders will be behind them -- the
institutions virtually never speak out in public although they do from
time to time stir things up behind closed doors -- and so far as the
dividend is concerned shareholders will either consider themselves lucky
to get one or will be satisfied with the increases which a lot of
companies have been paying recently.
For the most part, shareholders seldom query a company's dividend
policy or even ask what it is. The dividend is, however, when you get
right down to the essentials, the whole reason for buying shares.
Some shares are bought because investors want high immediate returns,
others are purchased on astronomic price earnings ratios and miniscule
dividend yields but the justification for the high ratings is the
prospect of fast growth in earnings and therefore increasing dividends.
Shareholders should therefore pay quite a lot of attention to the
dividend. The Government certainly does. It has already reduced the
value of the tax credit which companies can set against their
corporation tax and which non-taxpaying shareholders can reclaim.
That was, perhaps, a surprising move from a Tory Government which is
generally supposed to be friendly towards shareholders but that same
Government also reduced the tax concessions on mortgage interest
payments which is arguably one of the reasons for the plight of the
housing market.
There is not a lot shareholders can do about that other than write to
their MP who is, of course, likely to be a Labour MP in Scotland anyway.
Company earnings in total are currently running at a record proportion
of the nation's gross national product. Some observers argue that this
is simply because state privatisations have added a lot of companies and
a lot of earnings to the total but in any case it is a clear temptation
to the taxation authorities of any government.
There are, even in the Tory Party, some people who seem to feel that
paying dividends is rather a waste of money and the cash would be better
spent by investing in the business.
Where there are prospects of good returns that is, of course, a
sensible argument but that sort of thinking also leads companies into
making takeover bids and venturing into diversifications rather than
returning surplus money to shareholders.
Some companies are generating more cash than they need for maintaining
their existing businesses -- regional electricity companies bare an
example -- so shareholders turning up at annual meetings might well
consider asking for it to be paid to them if they do not feel that is
already being done.
The privatised companies mostly have regulators who may at some future
date and possibly under a different government, tighten even more than
at present.
So there is a powerful argument for the directors to pay out the cash
rather than keep it or spend it on diversification into a non-regulated
area which might seem a logical thing to do but which may not be
satisfyingly successful. There have been examples of this.
A lot of big UK companies also have sizeable earnings overseas. They
are now able to pay what are called foreign income dividends, FIDs for
short, as part of their dividend payments. For high taxpayers these
might turn out to be quite attractive.
The company can pay a FID without generating an advance corporation
tax liability. The FIDs are neutral in what they do to a company's tax
liability. In effect the Government says it will consider that part of
the dividend as having paid 20% tax. Non-taxpayers, however, cannot
reclaim that.
So far the number of companies paying FIDs is comparatively small.
That is something else which a shareholder in a company with an
appropriate earnings structure might like to ask the chairman about when
he calls for questions or when he puts the resolution to sanction the
final dividend.
Shareholders traditionally like to see their company have a reasonably
covered dividend. It gives the comfort that even if earnings fall a bit
the dividend should still be paid the next year.
But too high a cover could be regarded as something of a luxury these
days. Average cover has fallen from over twice the dividend to a little
under twice. But with earnings forecast to grow both this year and next
and future taxation policies uncertain there is something to be said for
having the money now -- the bird in the hand.

In Navacerrada, Spain
''THE next time we pull on the Scottish shirt it will be for real.''
Gavin Hastings was speaking after Scotland's ten-try, 62-7 rout of
Spain in Madrid.
That ''next time'' will be in the Olympia Park Stadium, Rustenburg, on
May 26. Scotland's opponents will be Ivory Coast and the Scottish
campaign to better the 1991 Rugby World Cup fourth place will be under
way in earnest.
Two wins in Spain -- that against Madrid less than convincing and
Saturday's rout of Spain pleasing in so many respects -- has provided a
solid launch-pad for the trip to South Africa.
Both, it has to be said, were in marked contrast to 1991, when the
Scots lost both warm-up games, plausibly to Romania and much less so to
Edinburgh Borderers at Murrayfield.
Coach Dougie Morgan was well satisfied with Saturday evening's
performance. ''In the first 20 minutes of the second half we could have
battened down the hatches, but to score 62 points is a reasonable
achievement in anybody's language.
''The heat tonight was difficult. We have done a lot of work out here,
training twice a day, and we expected that to have an effect.
''We have been up in the mountains, where the air was clearer. The
boys all said that they found conditions much more difficult down here
in Madrid.''
Gavin Hastings said that the performance against Spain had represented
a huge improvement over Tuesday night's display against a Madrid Select.
''We have proved that we are still capable of scoring lots of tries
and we go to South Africa in good heart.''
There was praise for Hastings from the coach, who said that, like all
of the senior players, the captain had provided a telling influence on
the youngsters in the side.
Craig Joiner was a case in point. The young Melrose wing has scored
six tries on this trip, three in each game, and he has noticeably grown
in confidence as the international season has progressed.
Joiner himself added: ''I've been happier with my game this week. Hat
tricks back to back certainly do a lot for your confidence! The week has
been great. It has brought the squad back together again after the break
since the Five Nations.
Immediately after the final whistle on Saturday, the Scottish side
were besieged by autograph-hunting Spaniards. Some members of the side
were still out on the park half an hour after the game ended.
David Hilton was the star. The Bristol butcher signed autographs by
the score, had a Spanish badge pinned to his shirt, and had to refuse an
offer from one Spanish punter to swop his Scotland jersey.
The Scottish squad leave for South Africa tomorow week. The past eight
days in Spain have been put to good use, with two games and two training
sessions a day.
''Dougie has been telling us that all the hard work we've done is
money in the bank for South Africa. Maybe we'll get some easier sessions
when we're over there,''said Hastings.
From the look on coach Morgan's face, the skipper would be unwise to
put his last peseta on it.

<HEADLINE>Life firms risking further alienation over plans to allocate surplus funds</HEADLINE>

HAVING already lost people's confidence over the pensions mis-selling
scandal, insurance companies are risking further alienation through
plans by the shareholder-owned companies to allocate more of their funds
to their owners.
A proportion of the with-profits life funds of the proprietary
companies has always belonged to shareholders but the exact size of this
proportion is a hazy area which the companies are trying to clarify to
the shareholders' advantage.
It only concerns the proprietary companies. The mutual societies,
which are of course particularly strong in Scotland, are not affected
because they are actually owned by their policyholders who therefore
have firm title to the whole of the life fund.
Policyholders will react with disquiet to plans to give shareholders a
larger stake in the company's funds, yet shareholders do have a
legitimate interest in them. Unfortunately for the companies the subject
is complex and difficult to explain to policyholders who have every
right to be sceptical given the events of recent years.
The ball was really set rolling by a little-known company, United
Friendly, which after lengthy talks with the Department of Trade and
Industry, which has a statutory duty to look after policyholders'
interests, secured agreement for the re-allocation of #275m to
shareholders. This does not mean they actually receive a capital
repayment of this amount. It stays within the life fund but future
investment returns from it will belong to shareholders.
Now other companies like Legal &amp; General, Britannic and Refuge are
seeking to follow suit and it is estimated that some #4500m in total
could be switched to shareholders.
Traditionally 10% of the investment return on the with-profits fund
has been allotted to shareholders, a proportion which is rather
arbitrary. However, companies are on firmer ground when they define
which funds legitimately belong to shareholders and which funds are
surplus to policyholders' requirements.
They can arise in various ways. For example, in the past the companies
may have issued non-profit policies and the investment surpluses on
these should have gone to shareholders but were instead absorbed into
the fund, contributing towards bonuses on with-profits policies issued
later.
In some cases, shareholder capital was actually used as seedcorn for
the life fund. With-profits policyholders might have benefited from
diversification funded by shareholders. In these cases it is fairly
clear that policyholders are entitled to some of the life fund's gains.
However, the ownership of a surplus built up because of excessive
caution in bonus declarations on with-profits policies is less clear, as
it is where the life fund benefits from poor surrender values on the
many policies which are not sustained until maturity.
The firm's actuary has a statutory duty to look after the interests of
policyholders and funds left over from what is required to meet
policyholders' ''reasonable expectations'' can be allocated to
shareholders.
Actuarial techniques have been improved but subjectivity has to enter
into it -- no-one actually knows how big the life fund would have to be.
The actuary's skill lies in the assumptions he has to make.
It could be argued that all such surpluses should belong to
policyholders. In practice it is established that shareholders qualify
for part of it. After all policyholders and shareholders do depend on
each other to some extent.
Policyholders may not think they get any advantage from shareholders
but this is not so. It makes incentivising staff easier and enables the
company to develop other interests at no risk to policyholders, whereas
the latter may benefit if they are successful.
Even the rises in the share prices of the proprietary companies in
anticipation of a re-allocation of funds to shareholders could be viewed
as positive for policyholders in improving morale in the company.
If it is a positive disadvantage to have shareholders then the mutuals
should consistently outperform the proprietary companies in terms of
returns to policyholders. This is not the case.
Policyholders have a rather unlikely champion in Sir John Nott, the
former Cabinet minister who became a leading figure in the City of
London and was for a time deputy chairman of Royal Insurance. He has a
policy with Legal &amp; General and appealed to the company to have an
independent actuary assess shareholders' interest in the life fund.
He claimed there was a conflict of interest between the appointed
actuary's role as protector of policyholders and his role as an employee
of the company. The insurance companies would reject claims that their
appointed actuaries are compromised but United Friendly did establish
something of a precedent in bringing in an outside actuary.
Clearly companies must show themselves whiter than white in deciding
the shareholders' allocation and policyholders would no doubt be happier
if they knew they had a representative acting exclusively for their
interests rather than relying totally on a Government department.

FRENCH financial markets celebrated conservative Jacques Chirac's
presidential election victory last night, powering the French franc
sharply higher.
The currency jumped 1% against the mark in special Sunday trading as
projections showed Chirac beating his Socialist rival Lionel Jospin by
four percentage points.
Shares and bond markets were closed but index futures in both soared
on electronic dealing screens.
The French franc traded at DM3.5350, up from DM3.57 on Friday.
Futures in the CAC-40 index of leading shares climbed to 1973.5 from
1925 at Friday's close and dealers said the Paris bourse was set to go
higher when it reopens tomorrow. Today is a public holiday.

FIERCE pressure is expected to be exerted on the pound this week
following the Government's decision to keep interest rates at 6.75%.
Some City dealers are bringing in staff today, even though it is a
Bank Holiday in the UK, to cope with expected pressure in key world
markets where trading resumes as normal.
Sterling is expected to be sold after many currency dealers decided
that the no change decision on UK rates was politically motivated.
Analysts say there is a feeling in the City that the Government
ignored Bank of England pressure for a rise to keep the lid on
inflation.
The pound has been wobbly recently against the powerful Deutschmark
and a rate rise, probably of 0.5%, was expected to have steadied the
currency.
But now there is little to prevent it slumping further.
Analysts predict that the pound will quickly fall to a new low against
the Deutschmark of DM2.15, from Friday's close of DM2.19, because of a
loss of confidence in the Government's anti-inflation fight.
One said: ''I am convinced the Bank pushed for a rate rise. Watch out
for the currency markets. Sterling is in for a pounding.''
The Bank publishes its quarterly inflation report on Thursday.
Officials refused to be drawn on whether it would show an increase in
the Bank's inflation expectations, or on whether the Governor pressed
for a rate rise last week.

THE celebration of VE Day has been a satisfying affair. Although there
are still marches, speeches, and parties to come, the memories of that
momentous day a whole half-century ago have been reconstructed in a host
of different ways. More than the flag-waving, the patriotism, and the
colourful bunting, it is the memories of ordinary men and women which
count. As time goes by these memories tend to fade and drift, often into
outline rather than solid three-dimensional colour. The real purpose of
the festivities of these days is to touch in the colour, to fill out the
shape, feel, and substance of times which mark a watershed in the lives
of so many. In addition, it is fitting to remember the end of a phase of
a conflict rather than any of the victories which it encompassed,
although for many the thoughts of VE Day will be dimmed by the loss of
those who died subsequently in a world war which had not yet ended.
Memories, then, are necessary for us all; in the case of conflict the
hope remains that they may help to avert other wars and other victims.
Yet there is another important aspect of these celebrations which the
Queen touched on in her speech at the weekend. While remembering the
casualties and the victims of war, she expanded on the tasks which must
always be undertaken at the end of a war. These include reconciliation
and the rebuilding of old partnerships and the crafting of new. Rightly,
she pointed out that if anyone doubted the wisdom of reconciliation and
the benefits and successes it can bring, they need only ask the younger
generation. This is particularly true of Europe which, though still
shadowed by some ghosts from the past and by a number of distressingly
repellent modern-day equivalents, still represents a good example of
where our hopes for the future might realistically rest. The Queen spoke
hopefully of re-establishing a European family of nations and this,
above all else, should be a lesson to ponder for the xenophobes of all
shades and degrees who still exist, whether in Scotland or in England.
One further point requires consideration. The Queen reminded us that
we are on the brink of a new century and of a new millennium. By the
time another decade has passed we will have embarked on that new
millennium and the celebrations of the present will be part of the last
century. This will be an appropriate time to lay the celebrations of VE
Day, and perhaps of other aspects of our past, to honourable rest. The
heroes and victims of the war years would not deny us this; they, above
all others, suffered for the future and their voices would urge us
onwards to that future if they could be heard. Therefore we should enjoy
the celebrations of the present, while setting ourselves firmly to face
the future.

IT is confidently asserted that the Almighty never answers prayers
that involve personal gain, such as asking for hints about lottery
numbers, football results, etc. Some authorities, indeed, claim that He
does exactly the opposite, and gives out wrong information. It would
even be wrong, they say, for a divinity student to seek guidance on exam
questions. Such arguments are persuasive, but there does seem to be a
curious correlation between going to church and worldly success. A
Harris poll not only found that 40% of Britain's upper classes are
regular worshippers, four times the proportion of the general public,
but that a clear majority believe their prayers have been effective in
gaining results.
Part of the solution may be that they are more successful in gaining
God's personal attention, without interruptions. This, indeed, may have
been why so many castles, stately homes, etc, had private chapels. In
the Old Testament, at least, it is quite clear that He is open to a good
argument, and even willing to do deals. Nevertheless, it is obviously
important that he should be able to listen, which is why the
congregation at the Blessed Sacrament Cathedral at Greensburg,
Pennsylvania, is taking legal action this week against two fellow
worshippers, Joan Sudwoj and Cynthia Balconi, for praying too loudly.
Unless they are quieter, said Father Richard Kosisko, the private
prayers of other people are being disturbed. The pair are already
reported to have been banned from another church.
The need for a quiet dialogue, rather than a self-centred monologue,
was always emphasised by Dean Inge. ''Prayer gives a man the opportunity
to know a gentleman he hardly ever meets,'' he said. ''I do not mean his
maker, but himself.'' The efficacy of divine help can surprise even
clergymen. The American bishop William Lawrence once came across a
motorist, swearing profanely and struggling to remove a flat tyre.
''Have you tried prayer, my good man?'' he asked. The desperate driver
fell to his knees, lifted his eyes to heaven, and when he next used the
lever, the tyre came free. ''Well I'm damned,'' said the bishop.

<HEADLINE>Moscow should block Iran reactor deal, says Clinton</HEADLINE>

Washington, Sunday
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said today ahead of a summit with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow that Russia would be endangering its
own security by selling Iran two nuclear power reactors.
''If this sale goes forward Russian national security can only be
weakened in the long term,'' Clinton said in remarks prepared for
delivery tonight to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
Clinton leaves tomorrow for Moscow to observe 50th anniversary
ceremonies marking the end of the Second World War in Europe, to meet
Yeltsin and to visit the Ukrainian capital Kiev before returning to
Washington next Friday.
In his remarks Clinton said disputes over Iran's nuclear programme and
Russia's fighting in the breakaway region of Chechnya are disagreements
that must be handled ''candidly, constructively and resolutely''.
Clinton said the fact that Iran wants to buy reactors and other
nuclear technology -- even though it has more than enough oil to meet
its energy needs -- plus other evidence about its nuclear programme
supports only one conclusion: ''Tehran is bent on building nuclear
weapons.''
''I believe Russia also has a powerful interest in preventing a
neighbour -- especially one with Iran's track record -- from possessing
these weapons,'' he said.
US Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole today predicted that Clinton
would persuade the Russians to forego the proposed sale of nuclear
reactors to Iran.
''If (Clinton) can't get it done then we've got a real problem. I
think it will really cool relations with (Russian President Boris)
Yeltsin, with the Russian Republic,'' Dole said on CBS television.
''But I think he can get it done. I've gotta believe that the Russians
understand that we're much more important to them than this sale might
be to Iran,'' he added.--Reuter.

HITLER'S legacy is by any standards a very serious topic because it is
a constant reminder that no matter how civilised a nation is, and how
vigilant it may be about protecting its values, nevertheless events,
conditions, and individuals can, either by accident or design, conspire
to destroy it.
Since Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire historians have
been concerned with those factors that undermine civilised values, and
go on from that to speculate about legacies. On the significance of
Hitler, much has been written, but John Macleod's contribution (April
29) is an embarrassment to a newspaper which should be able to carry the
leading and best informed opinions in Scotland.
John Macleod is not concerned to explain, or to allow his readers to
understand, anything. He embarks on an ego-trip in purple prose,
cluttered in rhetorical exaggeration and repetition rather in the style
of a Hitler speech or the Volkisher Beobachter, the intention being to
provoke hatred for the subject matter rather than to explain it.
He does not address the issues: he merely attacks the villain of the
piece. But this needs some skill. If you dismiss Hitler in a speech as
''red-faced, hoarse, screaming, spit-spraying'', you have to explain how
this held an audience transfixed for hours. If not, your sources may be
suspect. I would not regard Queen Mary as a good source for a Hitler
speech.
Anyone who understands German, from whatever ideological persuasion,
has to acknowledge from the footage the energy and power of Hitler's
delivery, and the relevance of his message to the German people, however
mistaken that may have been.
The article does not really deal with the Hitler legacy at all: it is
merely a digest of Macleod on Hitler, a digest littered with error and
contradictions.
He says the war ended with the death of Hitler. Close enough, I
suppose. I still think VE Day (May 8) is a better option. He says Hitler
was born ''evil''; in fact the frequency of this word is often in
inverse proportion to one's ability to explain the problem rationally.
The more you use the word, the less you explain.
This article dwells on ''evil'' quite a bit. It asks who was less
''depraved'', Hitler or Stalin. Stalin wins ''on theory'', ''peace,
love, brotherhood'', not a great consolation to the inmates of the
gulag, or the 40 million souls who perished under his rule.
Inconsistencies abound in this article. If Germany before 1870 was a
''hodgepodge of dukedoms, etc'' how did it, the ''land'' (singular!),
produce Goethe and Beethoven? Some people in Scotland dream about this
amount of decentralisation or devolution. In the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries it was precisely this that gave German states the
opportunities for patronage. Arts and science alike benefited from the
''hodgepodge''.
Decentralisation remained a hallmark of the Kaiserreich. Germans were
not ''smashed into a cohesive land'': this ''political infant''
developed an advanced welfare system that seriously embarrassed Britain
at the end of the nineteenth century. Also, liberal and socialist values
were more sophisticated than in Britain.
The Weimar Republic was the most developed of its kind, the
constitution a model of excellence; women had equal franchise with men
in 1919 (unlike Britain); the turnout over eight elections (1919-32)
averaged 80%; the first socialist-democratic coalition had the backing
of 76.4% of the voters.
And yet the article chants ''a republic without republicans; a
democracy without democrats'', rhetoric for the sake of rhetoric, drivel
for the sake of drivel. The real problem for the Republic was the
economy, not its democracy.
The Kaiser did not ''launch a terrible war''. In both World Wars it
was Britain who declared war on Germany. Britain was not part of
Hitler's plan, ostpolitik, the main focus being Russia.
The article does not realise this, and the claim, ''Hitler opened a
needless second front by invading Russia'', shows just how far it has
drifted from the facts. The objective was Russia and this explains the
delay over Dunkirk which John Macleod sees as a ''remarkable
evacuation''.
It remains a piece of incontrovertible logic that if Britain had stood
aside in 1939 to let Hitler get on with the self-destructive war in the
east, not a single British casualty would have been recorded in the
Second World War. More accurately, this war might not have existed. It
would have been the Russo-German War, very much an affair in eastern
Europe.
Charmley and Ponting are only providing the facts, no matter ''how
dangerous''. The article recognises this in the phrase ''one crazed
dictator could save the other'', but it balks at the obvious conclusion
and shifts ground to the non-sequitur of ''lightly esteemed'' dictators.
If in danger of getting it right, change the subject.
The article's description of Hitler in the Bunker and the manner of
his death in April 1945 (lifted from the now-discredited version of
pathologist Hugh Thomas), is very similar to the invented version which
Beria (to outwit his enemies in Smersh) was determined to impose on the
four Bunker eye-witnesses (Misch, Linge, Gunsche, Bauer) who had been
taken to Moscow for interrogation.
Beria's Operation Myth had no basis in fact (BBC1, Hitler's Death: the
Final Report, April 30, 1995) but it forms the basis of John Macleod's
account of Hitler's last days.
The only ''legacy'' I can find in this article is ''you will feel a
strange fear of the occult, of some Hitler rising again''. I don't think
so. But I have a need to avoid being disappointed with The Herald in the
return of this sort of article.

FRANCES CAMPBELL explains why a new university post is causing great
interest to watchers of sexual equality
THE announcement that Scotland was to get its first Professor of
Gender Relations was made at the same time as the job advert appeared in
the recruitment pages of the national press. Liberally slashed with the
she/he pronoun, Dundee University's advert made it clear that the post
was open to either sex, and the Scottish media now await with bated
breath whether a male or female gets the job.
Overstatement? I don't think so. Remember the outrage when BBC
Scotland appointed Andrea Calderwood -- ''A wee lassie'' -- as head of
television drama? The new Chair of Gender Relations, if male, may face a
similar barrage.
But why should she/he be female, you might ask, if gender relations is
not a gender specific term? The answer lies in the words that gender
relations have replaced.
According to a contemporary report in Harpies and Quines, a Chair of
Woman Studies was what the university was looking for in 1992. Fife
artist Gillian McFarland, Harpies went on to say, had already sculpted a
splendid professorial Chair for the incumbent who, unfortunately, had
yet to be appointed due to lack of funds. Was the title ''softened'' to
attract a sponsor perhaps, or is it part of a wider movement, however
well meaning, that will end up writing women out of the language again?
Try looking for the heading Women's Issues in your local bookshop now.
Try finding Feminism. Chances are you'll be directed to a stack marked
Gender Studies -- a nice, non-threatening phrase.
But as I look at the bright signs bearing this new classification I
wonder: is it a sell-out, or will women genuinely benefit from being
absorbed into an umbrella group where their limited resources may be
called upon to fight discrimination against men too?
A teacher friend, profoundly traditionalist in her views, recently
showed me a news sheet produced by her education authority. Called
Gender Matters, she displayed it as a sign that she was moving ahead
with the times. ''Boys,'' she said, ''need extra attention at school.
It's a well-known fact that they under-perform compared to girls.''
But as adults they're consistently better placed. Is it a priority for
women to see that men enjoy more opportunity in every walk of life? Call
me intolerant, but I feel the old anger rise as I see men enter
traditional women's spheres, taking the few jobs that used to be
reserved for women.
It makes for gender equality, sure, but at the lower end of the scale.
Will more boy checkout assistants lead to more women managers in
superstores? Will a bigger percentage of male typists in Whitehall
achieve equal representation at parliamentary level?
No. That won't happen until male MPs move over and make room for
women. And if -- because of personal ambition or a pressing political
agenda -- they can't bring themselves to drop out of the race, perhaps
their supporters can help them with a little negative action.
Like Dr Mike Donnelly, a Labour Party election agent and senior
academic who says: ''I have taken the personal decision to no longer
actively campaign for male candidates. I'm putting my support behind
women until equal representation is a fact.''
Virtuous sentiments. Echoed by the company who have funded the new
Chair of Gender Studies at Dundee A T &amp; T Global Information Solutions
(Scotland) Limited are quoted as saying: ''It is vital to our business
and our global competitiveness that we draw on the best human resources
available, and it would be folly if we were to ignore a sector of the
population.''
In Dundee, it is further hoped that the new professor will be able to
shed light on why women now out-perform men in many areas of education
but remain seriously under-represented in decision-making. Now, without
going so far as to aspire to a Chair, I would suggest that it may have
something to do with the fact that most education jobs, apart from the
very high ranking, are structured round school hours and holidays.
But it looks as if businesses and academia will have to change anyway.
The old order is crumbling. Women no longer necessarily see it as in
their own economic interest to support their husband's careers. Wives
are no longer prepared to follow their ambitious husbands to the other
end of the country.
I know one senior lecturer who let a professorship go because his wife
could not face giving up her own job-share post, uprooting their
children, and travelling south to an area that held no definite job
prospects for her.
Ironically, that man and others like him in the field of Human
Resource Studies could soon find themselves battling it out for the new
Chair of Gender Relations in Dundee whatever you call it -- Gender
Studies, Women's Issues, Feminism, -- the battle of the sexes still
going on.

A desperate mother is seeking justice over the kidnap of her two sons.
Julia Langdon describes the consuming tragedy that has engulfed her
life
THIS is an extraordinary story of the kind that will send the blood
running cold through the veins of any parent. It is about losing your
children: not through any of the casual terrors that beset us; not
accidentally, or through tragedy, or illness, or even murder, but
through abduction by the other, estranged, parent. ''Kidnap'' has been
in use as a verb since 1682, according to my dictionary. It originally
applied to carrying off children for service on the American plantations
and was then adapted for the illegal theft of any child.
That is what has happened to Catherine Laylle: her children have been
kidnapped. She knows where they are, that they are alive and protected,
but that does not make her horror any easier to deal with. In the past
nine months she has seen her two sons, Alexander, aged nine, and
Constantin, seven -- two sons who had lived with her all their little
lives until last July -- for just over three hours and they have been
told to scream if they see her. She has not even spoken to them since
early December.
Her story reflects something that has happened many times before in
our socially fragmented society, and will probably occur with increasing
frequency as there are more relationships crossing international
boundaries and a rising incidence of marital breakdown. What is shocking
about the story Catherine has to tell is that she is meant to have the
law, the decision of the British courts, on her side and yet even so she
has been able to do nothing to secure the return of her children from
their German father in Germany.
She is a desperate woman, 42 years old, attractive, charming,
vivacious, but desperate. She has the light of obsession in her eyes --
and who could blame her? -- for she is obsessed. She is a businesswoman,
a bond dealer in the City of London for an international firm of
bankers, but you can tell that there is nothing about her professional
life that matters in comparison with this consuming tragedy that has
engulfed her life.
She is very businesslike, direct, forthright, matter-of-fact even, as
she describes coldly the facts of her story, as she has told it again
and again to anyone who will listen. She talks of little else. She
thinks that publicity for the unfairness of what has happened to her may
be her most powerful weapon. I met her at a party with some politicians
whom she had approached for help and we have talked again probably at
least half a dozen times since.
It was only on the last occasion, late in the evening on the
telephone, when suddenly I could hear her voice cracking up and sensed
that her dignified resolve not to give in to emotion was difficult to
keep up all the time. She sounded as if she was crying and it was enough
to make anyone with any human sympathy cry for her, too.
Catherine is the child of French parents but has lived in Britain
since 1965. She went to school and university here and supported herself
in London when her parents retired to France. She has both French and
British passports and she became even more of a European when she met
and married a German doctor, Hans-Peter Volkmann. They were married in
Britain, their first child was born here and both of their children
carry the three passports of their three European countries. The
European ideal, a Europe without frontiers, a community of nations
working together and respecting common laws does not mean much to
Catherine Laylle, however.
After their marriage she had risen to become a highly successful
commodity broker and was the major earner in the family. Her husband,
who had never found satisfactory work in Britain and who did not enjoy
her success in the City did not like this. They agreed that for the sake
of his career it would be better to spend two years in Germany, so she
sacrificed her job and they moved. Secretly, though, it was because he
wanted her to be a hausfrau. ''He had to take me back to Germany under
false pretences,'' she says. The two years became six.
They were six difficult years in which Peter was frequently out of
work or changing the direction of his career and in which Catherine
could not get a proper job because her German was not sufficiently
strong. The marriage did not stand the test, her husband returned to
live with his parents and Catherine returned to London with their sons.
It was legally agreed that they should live with her, attend the French
Lycee in London, and holiday with their father in Germany, and so two
years passed. The boys did well at school, Catherine struggled to resume
her career but is now established as a senior account executive.
On July 6 last year the children went to Germany for their summer
holidays and that is almost the last that Catherine has seen of them.
Her husband wrote to inform her that the children were not returning and
did not wish to do so and she discovered that he had embarked on a
custody action in the German courts without telling her. By the end of
August the boys had been made wards of court and the High Court in
London had ordered their immediate return to their mother under the
requirements of the Hague Convention of which Germany is a signatory. In
September, after much frenzied legal activity, a German judge ordered
their return and their father was given half an hour with them to say
goodbye.
Instead he stole them. He bundled them into a car and drove off and at
that point all the barriers of a nationalistic, provincial German
society were erected to protect the father's attempts to keep his
children and to prevent their mother if possible from ever seeing them
again. The court order could not be served because the local lawyers
shut up shop for the day and Catherine and her lawyers took four hours
to find a bailiff. By then they couldn't find the family and by the time
they did, Peter had applied to a higher court on appeal. Eventually, in
October, he won it without Catherine being heard or her evidence
considered.
The judge decided that the children should remain in Germany because
this was their will. The children repeated robot-like that they were
German and wished to live there. The costs were awarded against
Catherine who says that, not including the court costs, the fight has so
far cost her #55,000 in fees and travel costs which she has not got. She
has sold her jewellery, her mother has sold hers, they are trying to
sell paintings. But money is irrelevant.
Catherine found out that the children had been taken to a psychologist
five hours' drive from her husband's home for a 10-day period before the
court hearing. She believes they have been brainwashed, but her husband
and his family and helpers still know that the bond of mother and
children is so strong that they dare not let her see them.
On the few occasions when Catherine has managed to talk to the boys it
was always in intimidating circumstances with other people monitoring
the conversation. The first time she saw them in six months, at the
beginning of December, it was in her husband's house. He locked them in
and although he was not meant to be there himself, he stood guard
outside and a neighbour in a truck blocked the driveway to the remote
property.
In written evidence she has prepared Catherine wrote: ''It was then
that I realised the full horror of my boys' existence. I shared the
world of two tiny prisoners held in a lonely, secluded house, cut out
from the rest of the world, on whom months of obvious hysteria,
oppressive seclusion, and authoritarian discipline left its deep mark.
They were drawn, pale and obviously too frightened by these intimidating
circumstances properly to relate to their own mother. What particularly
struck me was that their rooms were bare, strict, and devoid from any
cuddly toys. My husband also knocked down the walls so that he sleeps in
an open-plan area in between both boys' rooms, as if to 'control'
them.''
If there was any evidence needed about the prejudice against an
outsider in this community it is perhaps provided by the fact that there
was a local German court hearing on December 23 to decide whether
Catherine could see her children for Christmas. The judge gave his
decision on December 27.
And there the situation remains. The father has now won a custody case
in the German courts giving Catherine visitation rights after July 1 for
three hours a month, in Germany, under supervision, and only with the
will of the children. Catherine has had their status as wards of court
lifted, so that they can be named, so deperate is she to get help. She
has been besieging politicians, English and French, she has visited Lord
Mackay, the Lord Chancellor -- ''he responded as if I had lost a pair of
socks'' -- she has been trying every avenue to draw attention to her
case and to make a fuss. She does not understand why the British courts
and the Foreign Office have failed to make the German courts comply with
international law.
The granting of her limited visiting rights has dismayed her further.
It has been delayed until then, she believes, because the time lag is
crucial: the elder child will be 10, which has legal implications on his
status, and they will have been in Germany for a year. She does not
believe that the boys will ''wish'' to see her, their mother. But she
knows that given half a day alone with them, she could reach them and
they would say: ''I want to come home please Mummy.''

Clare Henry explores a fun exhibition which encourages the hands-on
approach, and warns of a risk to art education
HANDSOME Felix and his lovely Paola were exploring the ''new'' fun
McLellan Galleries. They had run the gauntlet of the ultraviolet sea
creatures in Jock Cousteau's entrance tunnel; visited the Enchanted Wood
and were busy writing their names on the paintbox computer at the top of
the grand staircase, to be projected giant-size on the curved marble
walls.
Beautiful twenty-something Paola smiled happily, then posed on the
balcony in front of her screen name while Felix took a photo. A
twentieth-century hi-tech version of carving hearts on oak trees or a
chance tableau of interactive art?
It was artistic guru Joseph Beuys who said everyone is an artist. Now
Glasgow Museums and Strathclyde Regional Council are saying it too. The
McLellan's Art Machine '95, claimed as Scotland's biggest interactive
event, encourages a literal hands-on approach. (The paintbox/video piece
is the idea of Darnley's artist-in-residence Steve Hurrell and computer
whiz Charles Sandison.) There are also lots of buttons to press, things
to touch, even a chance to try animation for yourself.
How successful it will be remains to be seen, for it is an ongoing
project and depends on the response of the public in general, and
teachers in particular, to use and develop the show during its
five-month run to September 25.
Yet from one angle Art Machine '95 highlights an established local
achievement too often overlooked, at best taken for granted: the
phenomenally wide range and high standard of all levels of art teaching
in Glasgow and Strathclyde.
For more than 20 years Strathclyde has benefited from strong art
staff, artists-in-residence and various special programmes like Castle
Toward summer school, to give west coast kids a head start in art. With
the setting up of the Visual Art Studio, Project Ability, and Gorbals
Art Project in the mid-1980s, Strathclyde pupils raced ahead. Last year
30 students from the Visual Arts Studio in Washington Street gained
entry to art school. Jackie Donachie, who has just won a prestigious
Fulbright Award to study in the United States, told me: ''I'm a product
of the Glasgow education system. I'm 26 now and you first wrote about me
when I was 14 and at Castle Toward.''
Local government reorganisation could put all this artistic excellence
at risk. Smaller areas will have smaller education budgets and less
opportunity for specialisation. The new local education authorities must
find a way to preserve the current system: a form of art education which
is unique in Britain and has proved itself time and time again.
Without it we may not have had the famous Glasgow Boys in the 1980s
and the equally well-known 1990s internationalists of Transmission
Gallery. Without it many disadvantaged young people would be much worse
off. Without it, Glasgow could lose its high profile as a centre of
artistic excellence. Politicians take note.
The Visual Art Studio features prominently at the McLellan (spot the
more sophisticated totem poles), but also fills one room with an
impressive black-and-white installation of decorated pillowcases strung
out like washing over a king-size bed. Twenty-five portfolio students
took the line, Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep as inspiration for pillow-time
dream images in liquid light or photogram, varying from realistic
portraits of a sleeping child to abstracts and text.
Art Machine '95 has also called on well-known artists to exhibit
alongside hundreds of kids from Campbeltown to Coatbridge; Giffnock to
Girvan. Simon Biggs, head of digital arts at Holland's Academy Minerva,
uses the latest computer-generated technology to link three huge screens
and sound. One screen sports a mouth which talks, another a man swinging
upside down, the last a row of nine naked figures who squat, roll, and
kneel. Movement in the darkened room triggers them to walk towards you:
an uncanny affair which inevitably produces the ''how did he do that?''
syndrome.
Biggs and the Clydeside Room are two sides of Art Machine's coin. Kids
from Golfhill Primary, aged nine to 11 years, produced a 75ft cyclorama
mural of the river. Directed by Julie Brook, they drew on the spot,
later transposing their observations on to huge panels on the floor.
''They couldn't have done it without going outside. Their drawings are
very observed,'' she said. Excellent photos document the process.
Art Machine is curated by Kathleen O'Neill in collaboration with
Richard Lazell, author of Live Art in Schools. Layzell's strategies to
target new audiences for contemporary art involve performance plus Tap,
Ruffle and Shave: ''an installation to meddle with''. A textured wall of
soft carpet, rough wood, cold metal and scratchy wire is there to be
touched while four giant wood constructions contain little doors to be
opened. This activates sound, light, smell and noise from all sorts of
clever, fascinating gizmos inside.
The programming of the McLellan, refurbished to the tune of #3m in
1990, is not good. Too often closed for weeks at a time and with a mere
four exhibitions a year, it has not lived up to expectations. The
potential is great yet five years have produced few memorable shows
(Scotland Creates and St Phalle qualify). Visitor figures are low.
Admission charges don't help.
Financing the McLellan seems a problem. I suspect that Art Machine is
a cheap way to fill five months. Nevertheless, it gives educationalists
a great chance to state their case for future generous arts funding.

NINETY young musicians staged a 24-hour sponsored play-in at the
weekend to fulfil their hopes of a US tour, including a White House
concert. A US sponsor had pulled out, leaving Ayrshire Fiddle Orchestra
#8000 short of budget.
The venue was Holy Trinity Episcopal Church in Ayr. The orchestra's
marketing manager, Mr Roddie Crooks, whose son David, 17, is leader of
the orchestra, said it would be a ''day or two before we know how much
has been raised''.
The tour is scheduled to begin on June 25. The players would live in a
mix of university accommodation and as guests of American families. The
planned events include a first stop at the University of Michigan at Ann
Arbor to take part in the famed American String Music Festival.

With Rob Roy set for its premiere in Edinburgh this Sunday, Marshall
Fine speaks to its star, Liam Neeson, about the rebel with a cause
AHH, the kilt question. ''That's about the 6000th time I've been asked
that,'' Liam Neeson sighs after the query (about what a Scotsman really
wears under one), sipping the first cup of a potful of tea he'll drink
in the next hour. ''I wish I had a witticism to answer with. Now, if you
were a young attractive girl . . .'' he adds with a smile.
It's a Sunday, Neeson's day off from filming Before and After, the
story of a couple facing trial for their son's murder, with Meryl Streep
in Massachusetts -- and he looks beat. Despite a six-day-a-week shooting
schedule, he's hopped down to New York to talk about his newest film.
The $25m Rob Roy, a historic tale of honour and revenge, set in
eighteenth-century Scotland.
Yes, he wore a kilt (with Marks &amp; Spencer cotton briefs underneath) to
play the rebel with a cause, Rob Roy MacGregor. In the film, kilts are
part fashion statement, part sleeping bag -- and all man. Even in a
skirt Neeson is still sexy. ''They wore them for ease and comfort in
fighting,'' says the strapping 6ft 4in tall, 42-year-old Neeson. ''They
used these enormous two-handed swords called claymores. You really
stretch your legs to handle one.''
Rob Roy deals with thievery and duplicity that pit the honourable
peasant MacGregor against his benefactor, the Marquis of Montrose (John
Hurt), over a matter of honour. Though MacGregor is the victim of
grievous wrongs, Neeson plays him as a man of steely will and infinite
patience. Another of his flawed men who rise to heroism.
''Well, if he exploded with temper, then he wouldn't be a hero,''
Neeson says. ''The thing about characters like Rob is that they're
slightly larger than life. You recognise their weaknesses but you want
to see them slightly elevated. Drama at its best is heightened reality.
It's about putting a man in the landscape and giving him beauty. You see
the struggle and hardship -- but also the beauty and potential.''
Words such as ''hero'' and ''honour'' roll off Neeson's tongue with an
urgency that belies the gentle burnish of his Irish brogue. To him,
there's a nobility and strength to characters who live by their
principles, no matter the cost. ''You switch on the TV and see images
that make life seem so disposable,'' Neeson says. ''Everything these men
stood for -- dignity, honour -- has been suppressed and, subconsciously,
we've grown up thinking what's the point of having ethics or principles?
And our leaders don't set an example.
''For Rob Roy and his clan, you were either a man of your word or you
weren't. There were no grey areas. But today, with the world leaders we
have, you don't know who to trust and that's bad.''
And what's replaced the concept of honour? ''MTV!'' Neeson says
mockingly. ''All over the bloody world. Fast images -- don't think,
don't question, just accept. The individual is being crushed.''
Neeson playing a man of honour is hardly a stretch: ''He has a quality
that Gary Cooper had -- you can tell he has a good soul,'' says Sam
Raimi, who directed Neeson in Darkman. ''He's a very sweet and
hard-working gentleman -- he can't seem to hide that part of himself.
He'd make an interesting villain.'' While Rob Roy's director Michael
Caton-Jones says: ''Liam has a deep romanticism. You can't invent that
stuff on people; he understands it in his bones. It's a million tiny
little things: the bracing cold winds, the way the clouds go, what you
get taught as a kid, the way the Scottish people and the Irish people
talk to each other. You start off with 'F*** you' and get warmer. To
other people that seems a very extreme way of behaving, but Liam
understands it intimately.
''Liam and I come from a Britain that is not Shakespeare or Merchant
Ivory. We're working-class boys who scuffed and kicked our way up.'' As
a boy Neeson's sport was boxing. Father Darragh, his parish priest in
Ballymena, owned two pairs of boxing gloves. So three times a week
Neeson and seven or eight other lads cleared the bingo cards off the
church-hall floor, arranged the chairs in a square and paired off.
''I got sort of into it, but it always scared the living daylights out
of me,'' Neeson says. ''Even smelling gloves now, it's a real love/fear
thing. I loved and feared the nakedness of it, the purity of it. There's
nothing to hide behind. Father Derragh's boy was Northern Ireland
champion three years running. He earned the bump on his nose in his
third championship bout, at the age of 15. At 16 he took a serious jab
to the head that rattled his brain, and lost all heart for fighting --
though he continued to train and spar for another year.
When he has children (''even if they are girls'') he will push them
towards boxing, he insists. ''It's an extraordinary discipline, and a
kind of poetry can develop with someone, a kind of communication.
There's guys I boxed in my teens that I remember vividly, and I know
that they would vividly remember me because we shared something on the
edge -- actual physical combat, albeit with rules and regulations, but
you are still a kind of gladiator, a warrior,'' says the star of Willie
McIlvanney's The Big Man.
After he finishes Before and After, Neeson will tackle the role of
Michael Collins, the founder of the Irish Republican Army, for director
Neil Jordan. He'll follow that, he hopes, by playing another tall,
romantic hero, Oscar Wilde in a film biography of the Irish playwright.
The playwright David Hare is writing the script. Mike Nichols will
produce and Neeson says Hugh Grant may co-star as his lover, Bosie --
Sir Alfred Douglas.
''I read (Richard) Ellmann's genius biography of Wilde when it came
out about six years ago,'' Neeson recently told Vanity Fair magazine.
''God, what a hero this guy was! Not just in his artistic beliefs but in
the trials and tribulations he went through, the horrendous time he had
in Reading Jail -- to come out with the wonderful dignity and belief in
what he had done. I feel about Wilde the way I do about Ignatius of
Loyola: certain men and women, you get the chance to really glimpse
their soul.''
Any qualms about love scenes with Grant? ''Darling, absolutely not,''
he drawls. ''Wilde was passionately in love with Bosie. That has to be
seen.''
Playing Wilde fits the profile set by Rob Roy and Michael Collins:
''Oscar Wilde is a real hero,'' repeats Neeson. ''He could see his fate.
Umpteen times, he could have run away to France or Italy. But he said,
'No, I'm going through this I have no other choice'. That's what Oskar
Schindler (whom Neeson played in Speilberg's Schindler's List) said: 'I
have no other choice'.''
Schindler has proved to be a pivotal role in Neeson's career. It moved
Neeson up on to the A List, giving him an earlier shot at the better
scripts. Yet the film spoiled him in a sense, he admits, noting that he
didn't work for a year after finishing Schindler's List because he
couldn't find a script that met his demands.
''When you do a piece of work that has the stamp of quality that
Schindler did, it's a standard you want to carry to the next one -- and
it can put you out on a limb,'' he says. ''I found I was obsessed with
Schindler and the Holocaust era . . . You've got to replenish your
batteries.''
The true turning point for Neeson, however, had come almost a year
before that film was released, when he decided to abandon Los Angeles to
move to New York to work onstage. His performance in the Roundabout
Theater Company's Anna Christie in 1992 won him a Tony nomination and
the title role in Schindler's List. It also introduced him to his wife,
actress Natasha Richardson, with whom he is expecting a child in June (a
boy, he hinted to Barbara Walters on American television recently). They
live in a spacious two-bedroom apartment in New York, which has views of
Central Park, and own an 1810 farmhouse which is a two-hour drive away
from the city.
Richardson, daughter of Vanessa Redgrave and the late Tony Richardson,
says of her husband: ''He's incredibly kind, and very funny. I mean,
very funny. But there is this real Celtic spiritual-loner thing about
him. He's a genuine person. He is so much who he is that I couldn't
quite believe it. I think when you come from his background, and your
life has been a struggle, and then you get to a place where it isn't so
much of a struggle, I think it's hard to trust it. I think he probably,
on some level -- although he wouldn't say it -- wakes up every morning
thinking, 'Isn't it great I'm not driving a forklift truck?' ''
Neeson had been acting for 20 years before finding himself at the
forefront of a major Hollywood movie. ''There was a wind of change
happening in my life, a call to go back to the stage that occurred as my
discomfort with physically living in LA happened,'' he says of his
decision to take on stage work. ''It was interpreted as my giving up the
movie business, which was rubbish. I wanted to get back onstage and flex
muscles I hadn't used in seven years. It was a total coincidence that
Schindler came along. It was like a zen thing. If you're hungry for
something and you go chasing after it, it will always be one step ahead
of you.''
But it wasn't simply luck; Neeson's presence onstage convinced Steven
Spielberg, who says simply that ''when Liam Neeson is playing a
character he ceases to be Liam Neeson'', and virtually everyone else who
saw him that he was a star waiting to happen. ''As a stage actor, he has
unbelievable magnetism and force -- I don't know what makes a star, but
he has it,'' says Todd Haimes, the Roundabout's artistic director. Yet
Neeson's best friend, the English actor Richard Graham, says: ''Liam's
ambition wasn't to do all the classics at the Royal Shakespeare Company.
He wanted big parts in big movies, and I always knew he would succeed.''
Graham also says Neeson is a loner -- ''he's always liked his own
company. There's part of Liam that nobody will ever know''.
Nowadays Neeson is seen as the heir apparent of another loner -- with
Sean Connery he shares a sweeping romantic grandeur, a gentleness, a
grace under pressure, and masculinity without machismo. All qualities
which shine through on screen. Though he's booked up with films, Neeson
longs to return to the stage again soon: ''I get offered stuff that's
very tantalising -- like playing Cyrano. The trouble is, if it's for
Broadway, they want a minimum commitment of six months, and that I don't
find appealing.''
Neeson's other role -- as newly-wed and imminent father -- is not open
to discussion. He deflects questions about marriage and parenthood with
a wary shrug. Just the way he used to dodge the gossip columnists when
he dated some of the film world's most glamorous women like Barbra
Streisand, Julia Roberts, Sinead O'Connor, Brooke Shields, and Helen
Mirren (who apparently still speaks fondly of him). He says, flatly:
''It comes to the point where you feel raped, where nothing is private
and everybody and his f***ing mother knows something about my personal
life,'' he says. ''You come away feeling cheap and tacky.''
He has no such reluctance when discussing the Michael Collins film.
''I've waited 10 years to do this,'' he says. The role, once mentioned
as a vehicle for Kevin Costner, marks Neeson's first acting job in his
native Ireland (he grew up in Ballymena, where his father, ''a quiet
fella'' called Barney, was a school janitor who died several years ago)
since 1981.
''It will be great to be back in Ireland, especially doing this
project and with what's happening in Irish politics,'' he says. ''The
troubles are 400 or 500 years old; they're embedded in the soil itself.
So peace is a delicate and long process. I'm proud of it; I never
thought it would happen in my lifetime.
''I think they've taken a leaf from what's happening in South Africa
and the Middle East. There's a reign of peace that's happening all over
the world -- at least that's my theory. Maybe the people in the former
Yugoslavia will say, 'If the Irish can do it -- and you know that
they're like -- we can do it too'.''

UFA Fabrik is a cluster of buildings in Berlin humming with life,
where people live, work, eat, or just take in some entertainment.
Doubtless many of those who visit are never aware that the former film
studios there made Nazi propaganda (and before that the movies of Murnau
and Fritz Lang). Sculptor George Wyllie -- who worked with the
children's circus there in 1988 -- made the point in his introduction
that this Mayfest visit by the troupe could hardly be bettered as a
positive way to mark VE Day.
The German troupe's numbers have been swelled by an innumerable number
of local children learning to tumble, juggle, and dance during the past
two days. The very young made up Captain Hook's Flying Pirates, and the
Wild Animals. That's the nearest this ideologically sound venture gets
to livestock -- seven nippers in catsuits -- but it worked because their
''trainers'' never abandoned the pretence that they were vicious beasts.
Magician Daniel was charm itself, and the dance took the form of a
flamenco solo from one of the Berlin girls and the fruits of the
break-dancing workshop into which the Pollokshields youth had flung
themselves with some enthusiasm. A wide age range was entertained, with
the older boys gasping at the football skills of one of the jugglers and
the older girls at his rock-star looks.
He and Daniel provided the finale of flaming torches, but that
couldn't detract from the performance of the kids. Best moment: when
young Felix passed his spinning plate to the lass next to him (who was
having problems getting her's going) and nonchalantly started another
for himself.

THERE are many emotions the theatre deals with every night. Fear, for
some reason, is not one of them. Perhaps it's because cinema can do it
better; or perhaps because a theatre audience's suspension of disbelief
will accommodate laughter, pain, tragedy, empathy, but not genuine
terror at what is plainly the creation of fellow human beings acting in
one corner of the same room.
All the more credit, therefore, to director Anna Newell for brewing up
a real chiller of a production of Liz Lochhead's Dracula. Without
recourse to technical trickery, she draws the audience in, enveloping us
like a film and, even at the most melodramatic moments, somehow
sidesteps what should be the evident silliness of 300 people finding
credulous a story of a man who lives on human blood, refuses to die but
doesn't much care for garlic.
Not that Lochhead's script is in any way trashy. Full of linguistic
jokes and with a wise-talking mental patient (excellently played by Mark
McDonnell) who could be a Shakespearean fool, her play pulls us into a
heart of darkness that holds our carnal selves up to examination. The
sexual aspect of the myth is there, though it's largely internalised
(nightmares of lighthouses and orgasmic earthquakes), but the motif of
consumption -- the madman eating sparrows, the virginal Lucy (a
mesmerising Veronica Leer) refusing to eat at all, and the repeated
emptying of the slops centre stage -- links us all, incriminatingly,
with Dracula's own taste for blood.
Another fabulous set by Gregory Smith, a cracking performance by Irene
Macdougall as the nurse, and crowning it all a truly frightening Kern
Falconer as the vampire whose slow, measured concentration sucks in
every last bloodcurdled drop of our attention. Bloody good.

WE don't give reviews headlines on this page anymore but if we did,
this one would read: ''Portable phone stops show''. Mike Bradley was a
minute or so into his drum solo when his phone rang, causing puzzled
looks on stage. Was it some yuppie telling him to get on with it? His
mum asking what time he'd be home? We'll never know. ''Actually, I'm in
the middle of a drum solo right now. Bye,'' a suitably embarrassed
Bradley told the caller and proceeded to power the Nigel Clark Quintet
towards an energetic coda.
Bradley isn't the sort of drummer who needs chivvying along. His
business-like drumming was always at the heart of a set which avoided
the excesses of jazz/rock and gave us the latter's excitement in
generous proportion to the former's skill and phrasing.
Guitarist Clark and saxophonist Tim Garland's unison playing of
intricate melodies such as the aptly named High Wire was bebop for the
1990s. Not that it was all speed freakery. The acoustic duet by Garland
and pianist Brian Kellock, Not Lost At All, produced much thoughtful,
genuinely creative playing and the following No Romance showed a
collective talent for controlled drama that can be every bit as
nail-biting as hearing them take on the Latin-flavoured sprints of 26th
Samba or Over the Moon.
Nitin Sawhney's mixture of jazz with Indian classicism, flamenco and
North African influences, despite impressive contributions from his
flutes-and-tablas-playing colleagues, sounded like work in progress,
with Sawhney's guitar and keyboards work technically capable but
carrying no real personality or emotional impact.

IT was after the dance of the Daleks that the puppets appeared. Once
the reconstructed shopping trolleys, wired with lights, had waltzed and
left the stage, a warped puppet in a trilby hat and trenchcoat dragged
on the corpse of a young girl. Then left her, after first stroking her
face. Good, thought I, marking ''sinister'' and ''chilling'' in my
notebook, we're in for a noirish treat. Sorry, Manchester's Doo Cot
Theatre Company took a right on Pretentious Trunpike, crashed, then
burned.
Watching the latter carnage wander before my eyes I wondered: Is it
enough just to list our social evils such as pornography, prostituion
and drugs or is it essential to interpret, to dare to question why. Doo
Cot using puppets, live music and computer animation did little more
than present the ills of today's city streets. We know what they are,
and, next, the point is? The point is there was no point, no rhyme, no
reason. Fair enough, free-form images, just go with the flow, but Odd If
You Dare was swept away in its own slipstream. Maybe it knew what it was
talking about, we certainly didn't.
And by the end we didn't care, an angel unveiled robes of condoms, a
girl gives birth in a deserted graveyard, disturbing, tragic images, but
ruined by the sense of so what. At the end the play's puppeteers came
out and sang loudly while images of diseased human hearts, kidneys, and
lungs were projected on a screen. There were no turds, which seemed a
missed opportunity. However there was half a brain.

THE last time I met Nicky Fairbairn he was in good form in the Babbity
Bowster. Perhaps he knew then that his time was not long. ''Whatever
they write,'' he growled, ''I hope they don't say that I was really a
nice chap.'' And, tapping the top of his lum hat, he took off into the
night.
Nice or not, Nicky Fairbairn's last act for reporters was to bequeath
us the Perth and Kinross by-election, for which we should be grateful. I
shall miss the campaign but here's hoping for a dirty fight -- they are
always best.
Some of us are old enough to remember the Kinross and Perth
by-election of 32 years ago. It made George Younger, who is the only
Scottish Tory I can recall reaching the top by standing down.
The young Younger, if memory serves, dropped out as Tory candidate to
make way for the new Prime Minister, Lord Home, who had the tricky
problem of not actually being elected by anyone. Home could not,
therefore, sit in the Commons. The dependable Unionists of Perth and
Kinross were required to confer electoral legitimacy in a quickie
by-election -- which they duly did, bless them. They knew their place.
Gentleman George later found his reward in the form of a safe seat.
The SNP's Roseanna Cunningham almost wrested Kinross from Fairbairn
three years ago. She was expected to win and her failure surprised
everyone, especially Fairbairn, who was in the doghouse for making a
racist remark just before polling.
Later, I wrote something to the effect that to understand his
supporters you needed not a political scientist but a psychiatrist.
Fairbairn exploded and promised a writ. Well, I guess it will never
arrive. Pity. I bet it would have been my first on scented paper.
Here's hoping for an SNP victory because no other result will stir
Scottish politics, certainly not the election of another Labour drone or
space-invading Tory alien. Ms Cunningham can expect a rough contest in
which she will suffer all the old lies about an independent Scotland's
prospects.
She has one thing going for her in this battle: it is called the
European Union.
The first lie, a long time dying, is that an independent Scotland
could be kicked out of the EU. That is easy to answer because there is
not a snowball's chance in hell of it happening (expulsion I mean, not
independence). There is only one precedent and that is Greenland whose
problem was escaping the EU, not joining. The fact is that the Scots --
independent or not -- are European citizens under Maastricht and cannot
be stripped of that status without their consent.
The next lie should have disappeared years ago. It is that an
independent Scotland would need new customs arrangements and a separate
currency from England, possibly even Border posts. Well, the EU has seen
to all of that, too.
The Scots pioneered the idea of a single currency -- we shared the Ecu
with France during the Auld Alliance -- and as Brits or independent
Scots we are certain to join in the monetary union process again when
the EU states amalgamate their currencies under Maastricht. There might
be a hiatus while the English fuss about their precious sovereignty but
their pound is far too weak to stand alone against a world-dominating
new Euro-currency. So forget scares about separate currencies.
Customs are going anyway as the European single market progresses and
border posts are disappearing inside most of the EU except, temporarily,
in Britain. Some of the southern British still believe that hordes of
foreigners are desperate to swarm up the White Cliffs of Dover,
oblivious to the fact that they could equally head for the beach at Juan
les Pins if they were not so desperate to get to Bradford.
So far, no problem. A more insidious lie comes next. The Tories and
probably Labour and the Liberals, too, will wheel out the ultimate
argument: we can't afford independence because the Scots, uniquely in
Europe, are too small and remote and poor and stupid to look after
themselves.
I gather Mr Ian Lang put figures to this argument last week and no
doubt some people even believed them. We will hear how England
generously subsidises Scotland, saving us from bankruptcy.
Well, let's see. Britain is the poorest of the EU member states if you
discount the so-called ''cohesion'' countries -- Spain and Portugal,
Greece and Ireland. This is why we are gradually paying comparatively
less into the EU as we get poorer while the richer states pay
comparatively more. But we are still a net contributor and a long way
ahead of the poorest four.
The two economies in Europe most resembling Scotland's are Finland's
and Norway's. Finland -- forestry, electronics -- once had the strongest
currency in the West and is an EU net contributor. Norway -- oil, fish
-- is one of the world's richest countries and did not even feel any
economic need to join the EU.
In truth no-one knows exactly how well off an independent Scotland
would be. Oil revenues would be significant; we would have to negotiate
our share of British embassies and properties around the world and
calculate income from major sources like whisky duty. But of this you
can be certain: the EU is increasingly a club for smaller nations which
are almost without exception those with the best economies.
But let us suppose -- just for argument's sake, you understand -- that
the Scots really are a basket case. In that event the EU would assume
responsibility for subventions as it does for all its weaker economies.
No-one I know in Brussels believes that would be necessary. Most assume
Scotland would be a net contributor.
Finally, there is the libel that Scottish nationalism is
quasi-fascism. Yet it was gentle, Scottish-style nationalism which kept
alive the hopes of the Poles and Czechs and the other new East European
democracies during a generation of totalitarianism. It is a bit rich for
New Labour to denounce the leftish SNP for being right wing. Scottish
nationalism is motivated by internationalism, especially Europeanism.
The only skinheads I've seen in Scottish politics have been Militant's.
Most Scots still respond more to the sentiment of being British than
to the facts. Wouldn't it be helpful for once if we could discuss the
facts of constitutional change without the lie machine?

I'LL say this for them; the folks who don't want a Gallery of Scottish
Art in Glasgow sure have staying power. Now they've come up with yet
another diversionary tactic in their long drawn-out battle to keep
Scottish paintings out of the hands of the occidental visigoths. The
latest wheeze is to scrap any notion of a new gallery (especially over
there!) and ease the National Galleries chronic storage problem by
sending art parcels out to starving galleries all over Scotland.
This is a pretty shrewd suggestion, given that nobody is likely to
respond by saying that Aberdeen, Perth, Inverness, Dundee, Stornoway et
al shouldn't be allowed to improve the desirability count of their
collections even on a lengthy loan basis.
It's also a pretty ruthless one, since they've wheeled in some heavy
artillery in the shape of those Scottish aristos who already allow many
of their masterpieces to be hung in the National Gallery in Edinburgh.
Asked on the wireless the other morning if the Duke of Sutherland might
whisk his finest back north if the new strategy were turned down, a
spokesperson feigned horror that anyone would even imagine His Grace
could stoop so low as common blackmail.
OK. But how about moral blackmail? How about this group of well-born
plotters knowing fine well that National Galleries Director Timothy
Clifford, to name but six, would freak out at the thought of a single
Titian falling off his plush red walls. How about them having calculated
that this allegedly bolshie nation of ours still has a distressing
tendency in too many quarters to touch its metaphorical forelock when
confronted by anyone with a season ticket for the second chamber.
However, let us examine the credentials of their proposal with as much
sanguinity as can be mustered in this seemingly endless soap opera.
First: is it a good idea that the national collection which belongs to
all Scots should be seen by as many of them as possible in as many
places as possible? Well yes, in theory it is.
But how can it be that the group now pursuing this admirably
democratic philosophy with such vigour are, in many cases, the selfsame
chaps and chappesses who were hollering, not so very many months ago,
about the sanctity of the National Gallery in Edinburgh. About how its
treasures must not be diluted. About how it was absolutely essential
that the capital must be the showpiece for the best we had to offer the
touring classes.
If that's still true, why now argue for sending shipments of the stuff
hither and yon? Unless, of course, all you plan to send is that stuff
left to the nation by Lady Philistine which you wouldn't normally want
to let out the storeroom for fear it frightened the natives.
Of course there have been other more legitimate protests about the new
gallery being built.
One deployed by many respected names is that the actual notion of
having a gallery devoted to the art of Scotland is intrinsically wrong
headed. That's a perfectly respectable viewpoint which I don't happen to
share. Not least because a Gallery of Scottish Art which incorporated
Scottish design and Scottish architecture would have a very important
and wide-ranging story to tell. Logically, of course, it should have
been told in tandem with the equally fascinating material being
assembled for the new Museum of Scotland. In an ideal world without
competing bureaucratic and geographical dynasties one project would have
sufficed for both.
But here again some of the opponents of a Gallery of Scottish Art seem
to have undergone a logic bypass. Because many of these voices were also
prominent in the stout defence of a Scottish Portrait Gallery. How dare
anyone vandalise something specifically celebrating a unique part of our
Scottish heritage they cried. Indeed. But, equally, how dare anyone now
deny that we have other facets to our visual arts heritage which also
cry out for celebration?
There is another argument, with which I have some sympathy, that
galleries themselves might be considered a dated concept and that as we
approach the twenty-first century we shouldn't be in the business of
constructing more museum pieces, which by their very nature, limit the
number of people who will have access to them and militate against
adventurous deployment of the material.
The second half of that worry can be addressed by imaginative and
creative use of space and new technology as the plans for the new Museum
of Scotland are already demonstrating.
As for accessibility, for me the main reason for siting such a gallery
in Glasgow is down to sheer force of potential visitor numbers. It's
difficult to get past the fact that half of Scotland lives in
Strathclyde and that existing Glasgow galleries have massive attendances
compared with anywhere else. And, as my friends in Edinburgh often
remind me, the M8 is just a 44-mile corridor between our two principal
cities. It means the glories of the Edinburgh Festival are less than an
hour distant. And, gosh, it will take just the same time in the other
direction for art lovers.
I would love to think this latest bid to ditch the Glasgow gallery in
favour of Scottish works doing a circular tour was prompted by a
genuine, if somewhat late-developing, consideration for those not able
to travel to Edinburgh regularly.
But sadly cynicism prevails. I think the scheme has been cooked up by
people who hope a hand-knitted compromise with modest cost implications
will have custom-built appeal for the Scottish Office. Perhaps it was
even knitted with some tacit advice from the man who runs that shop.
After all, if the Duke of Sutherland and sundry other ermine-clad chums
are in favour of the scheme how can it possibly be flawed?

THE new head of CID in Lothian and Borders Police said yesterday that
while the continuing downward trend of crime was encouraging, he was
concerned about crimes involving weapons such as knives and firearms.
Chief Superintendent Peter Wilson, who takes up his post today after a
two-year attachment with HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, said: ''The
modern criminal has new technology at his disposal and it is important
that the police respond to this.''
Edinburgh-born Mr Wilson, 41, joined the former Edinburgh City Police
in 1973 and after promotion to sergeant took a law degree at Edinburgh
University. Two years later, he was promoted to detective inspector.
He was later involved in the Lockerbie investigation, co-ordinating
the management of linked incident rooms in Germany and the United
States.
In 1989, Mr Wilson was promoted to detective chief inspector in charge
of the Fraud Squad and, two years later, became superintendent.
In 1992, Mr Wilson, who attended a three-month course at the FBI
academy in Washington, was appointed deputy divisional commander for Mid
and East Lothian and a year later was promoted to chief superintendent
at Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary.

BUCKETFUL of bands? Pass me a bucket. Presented by everyone's
favourite large, blond, bearded music ''journalist'' Ewan McLeod, this
gathering of a slice of Scotland's talent was, in the embryonic stage, a
great idea.
Somewhere along the line, the publicity guy got hopelessly lost and
failed to, well, publicise. Had there been more media coverage
emphasising it was not just another gig, but an event to exploit new
bands, more people would have turned up. Hence, more atmosphere, more
fun. And, as it was, it turned out to be just another gig.
Expecting a multitude of nineties Generation X slackers, I was taken
aback by the event's lack of ambience and human bonding. Too many guest
passes and groupies and not enough ordinary music-loving punters to give
the happening a sense of down-to-earth normality.
Hanging around seemed like a chore, with an underlying feeling of
something big should happen.
When it did -- around the time Travis came on -- it was a regular
three-courser. Travis provided a mouth-watering taster of
Lennon/McCartney harmonies and soft-rock melodies. Our appetites were
whetted. Finally, something to chew on.
But teeth really started to grind when Baby Chaos graced the hall with
their delicious presence. The Baby Chaos Show -- that's what it should
have been called. They rock, they shock, they wear beige socks. My
kisses are not worthy of their feet. How unsatisfying that they were not
headlining.
The official top of the bill Thrum, with Monica ''I'm from Motherwell
in the US of A'' McQueen fronting, were a mere wafer-thin mint to the
Babies' t-bone steak of a main dish.

With 1999 in mind, Clare Henry senses the winds are set fair for a new
Scottish urbanism
ONE thousand architects gathered in Glasgow at the weekend to discuss
their visions for the future. The occasion was the 1995 Royal
Incorporation of Architects in Scotland convention, the largest event of
its type in Europe; its theme, Cities on the Edge; its purpose to bring
world-class ideas and debate to Scotland.
Speakers included Calatrava, the Zurich-based Spaniard, who was
awarded an RIAS honorary fellowship; Ted Cullinan, brave enough to
tackle projects at both Stonehenge and St Paul's; Henri Ciriani and
Odile Decq from Paris; eminent architects from Sweden, Denmark, Athens,
Iceland -- and from Ireland, for the convention involved both the Royal
Institutes of Ulster and Eire.
As it was an international event, Glasgow had the grace not to push
its position as UK City of Architecture and Design 1999. After all, it
is over three years away. Moreover there is a hiatus -- more accurately
a deadly civic silence -- on the subject. But the broad issues -- where
are we going, and how do we celebrate the millennium? -- were implicit
in all the speeches, and are surely at the back of every Glaswegian's
mind.
British architects have had a bad time recently. Attacked by both the
recession and Prince Charles, they've had to compromise to survive.
Some, like Per Kartvedt, argue the halt in the frantic building of the
1980s was perhaps ''a blessing in disguise''. He went on to pose that
vital question, ''What are they doing about the Clyde? Surely there must
be plans for it?'' Another deadly silence.
''Architects need to come off their pedestals and take the criticism
of lay people; listen to the client,'' said the RIAS president. But in
Glasgow this already happens. The modern Medicis are the housing
associations: the Medicis of Maryhill, of Reidvale and New Gorbals.
Charles McKean, professor at Dundee, but who, as former RIAS director,
planned the conference, believes the winds are set fair not only for the
development of a new Scottish urbanism, but for a new architecture which
is both Scottish and modern.
''There is no greater task for the end of the twentieth century. There
are precedents: Mackintosh and Lorimer, then Basil Spence and others in
the thirties. Good, modern Scottish architecture could take off again.
We just need the cultural climate and cultural confidence to take a
risk.''
In Europe, things are different. There is room and money for the grand
gesture. With Gallic passion, Ciriani announced that architecture ''is
not about construction. It should be a monument to magic; something that
transports and transforms!''
Scandinavia's 60-year track record of attention to architecture was
obvious from the speakers' presentations and brought sighs of envy.
Even Dublin has the urge to build ambitiously. You need powerful
people to get anywhere now that conservationists and retro-ites
outnumber the progressives. Cullinan has found his man in Jocelyn
Stevens, the spoilt rich kid with no inhibitions about yelling at
Ministers. Dublin's Charles Haughey has taken a leaf out of his friend
Mitterrand's book and gone for immortalisation via a cultural quarter
called Temple Bar, which impressed me on a recent visit.
However, I found Scottish contributions to the convention among the
most dynamic. Murray Grigor lambasted centralism with his usual
razor-sharp wit and then showed a clip from his new, acclaimed American
film on Charles Gwathmey. Gavin Stamp's BBC slot on Greek Thomson has
persuaded the city to help preserve his St Vincent Street church, the
venue for the convention. Sandy Stoddart's controversial address on
classical adornment was fabulous.
Coinciding with the convention is Interact, an impressive annual
international student competition which attracts about 80 entries. This
year's task was to design the new Centenary Building for Glasgow School
of Art. The winners, Escriba &amp; Fontova (both women) from Barcelona beat
Paris (2 girls, 1 guy) and Glasgow, (two guys, 1 girl) into 2nd and 3rd
place, so pushing up the number of women involved over the weekend
considerably. The architectural future is obviously female.
''Investors and politicians all want something they have already seen.
Architects are trained to see that which is not yet there,'' said one
speaker. With 1999, Glasgow has the opportunity to take advantage of
inspired architects. I hope it has the courage to do so.

THE parallel stories of witch-hunting that created Arthur Miller's The
Crucible (at the Arches from tomorrow) might be better known, but it
would be a wise woman who acquainted herself with the story of Erzsebet
Bathory, a Transylvanian Countess, accused -- at the end of the
sixteenth century -- of bathing in the blood of virgins.
Yvette Boszik is clearly a wise woman. She has taken the story of
Bathory's accusation and incarceration and made a performance (it could
as easily say ''dance'' at the top of this notice) that -- quite
wordlessly -- poses dark questions about the way we relate to beauty and
truth, and to innocence and experience, then and now.
Madonna has a line in the film Dick Tracy: ''You don't know whether to
hit me or kiss me -- I get a lot of that.'' Men have persecuted women
who cause that reaction for centuries. Women less powerfully naturally
endowed have assisted.
A woman that remains as attractive and youthful looking as the
Countess has surely been using some nefarious means, from witchcraft to
plastic surgery. Perhaps Boszik herself is not as young as impresario
Ricky Demarco believes.
Exaggerated mannerisms, recognisable classicism, stylised repetition,
and casual naturalism are all present in the repertoire of movement she
has drawn on for herself and Kata Pentek.
The piece builds from the deceptively languid (but breath-catchingly
sensual) to an equally deceptive take on speed-induced dancefloor frenzy
-- all of it in astonishing correlation with Jean-Philippe Heritier's
specially composed music.
In its own way the music is just as extraordinary -- a mesmerising
cocktail of synthesised sound, percussion, voices, and Gothic organ. To
miss this show would be insane.

OVER a year ago, writer Janice Galloway and composer Sally Beamish sat
in a studio discussing the neglect of female composers for Radio
Scotland's The Usual Suspects. After a lively debate they concluded that
the problem lay not in a lack of creative talent but in a lack of
recognition. A year on, Galloway has collaborated with Beamish's Chamber
Group of Scotland on a fascinating presentation, giving four female
composers the recognition they deserve.
''Why do they shut me out of Heaven? Do I sing too loud?'' -- the
poetry by Emily Dickson which served as the starting point for
Galloway's text. Read with eloquence and understanding by Morag Hood,
Galloway's basic source material came from the words of the composers
throughout the ages, placing the music in historical context and adding
insight into their often-thwarted musical lives.
Janet Beat's Five Projects for Joan removes itself from her usual
sphere of electronic music. A collection of short studies for solo
cello, these showy miniatures demand the utmost in technical brilliance.
Robert Irvine couldn't have done a better job, his cello revealing all
of Beat's eccentricities.
In Piano Trios by both Clara Schumann and Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel,
the Chamber Group demonstrated the music's versatility. An oft-quoted
excuse for neglect is that women never attempted the symphonic test,
preferring to stick to small-scale works. In these two trios, there was
nothing miniature, both rich in invention and dramatic conviction.
Lili Boulanger's Nocturne and Cortege are exquisite salon pieces,
brimming with intoxicating impressionist harmonies well projected by
Ruth Crouch, violin, and Graeme McNaught, piano. This is an excellent
and important project which deserves another performance outside
Mayfest.

IN his interesting article, Hitler's legacy (April 29), John Macleod
refers to the Nazis' use of ''Masonic symbolism''.
As he uses a capital ''M'' he presumably means Freemasonry, and I have
to point out to him that Freemasons were among the many independent and
liberally minded institutions feared by the Nazis and suppressed by them
after they came to power. It is hardly likely that Masonic emblems would
have been taken over by the new regime.
Maybe he is confusing the adoption by the Nazis of ancient runes
venerated by the old Germanic tribes. Originally taken from an Etruscan
alphabet, they were endowed with occult and magical powers which could
be invoked when the occasion demanded.
Their simple, stylished shapes lent themselves to the perverted
heraldry of the Third Reich; the folk-memory of their potency and
association with the early Germans appealed to the Nazis' corrupted
notion of patriotism.
Perhaps the most sinister was the double blitz forming the dread
letters SS; the wolf's tongue rune, and the Tyr rune (Tyr was the son of
the war god Odin) were other examples.
I am always intrigued that the life rune, which was used by the SA
(Storm Troops) medical units, reappeared later in inverted form and
surrounded by a circle, as the CND logotype. No doubt the coincidence
was quite fortuitous.
However, John Macleod could have misread his sources, as variations of
the old runes were sometimes used as masons' marks in medieval times to
show responsibility for work done. These can be seen today carved into
the stonework of ancient churches.
The chief Nazi symbol was, of course, the swastika -- the hakenkreuz.
It was not a runic device but much older, at least dating back to the
fifth millennium BC. It meant many things to different civilisations and
religions but always seems to have had a positive image, expressing good
fortune, prosperity, health, life, happiness; a good-luck token.
Its honourable and well-regarded reputation was utterly ruined by its
selfish and cynical usurpation by the Nazi Party. I doubt if mankind has
enough time left to see it restored to the respectability it enjoyed
prior to 1933.

THE Tories' disastrous local election results were not caused by party
disunity but the wrong policies, particularly on taxation and law and
order, according to Mr Murdo Fraser, the Scottish director of the
right-wing Tory pressure group Conservative Way Forward.
The Government has also to combat the perception in Scotland that it
is anti-Scottish, he added, citing its decision to merge Scottish
Nuclear with Nuclear Electric as a move which had angered Scots.
Mr Fraser said: ''There was an opportunity for the Government to
privatise Scottish Nuclear separately and to establish a large new
Scottish limited company.
''I cannot believe that there are any tremendously persuasive economic
arguments against doing that, and it adds to the perception that the
Government is not interested in Scotland.''
Mr Fraser said he disagreed with the interpretation made by Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang and other politicians -- that problems within the
party had disillusioned the electorate.
''That was not an issue on the doorsteps when we were campaigning. We
have to look at policies. If we are going to regain the votes we got in
1992 we have to change our policies, in particular on taxation.''
On law and order, the party needs to allow more representation of the
views of victims of crime at the time of sentencing and to combat the
perception that sentencing does not reflect the public view of crime, he
said.
Mr Bill Walker is the only Scottish MP who is member of CWF, but, said
Mr Fraser, Mr Allan Stewart, Mr Michael Forsyth, and Mr Phil Gallie are
sympathetic.

The Tory-inclined middle class - thegrowth sector of the Thatcher
eighties -- has spoken again. Those, like ''Essex man'', who aspire to
vault a class barrier or two, have also spoken. They think that this
Government has deserted them and Mr Major must now let them dictate the
agenda.
I think this assessment cuts through all the cant that we have been
subjected to since the Tories have been reduced to 13 councils in
Scotland, England, and Wales. Correction: 13 in England, zero in
Scotland and Wales. Get back to basics, Mr Major, or else.
Last Thursday was only the latest and most pungent of warnings from a
succession of elections of all sorts over the past three years. Ignored
before, the middle classes shouted it out this time. They either refused
to vote or they went straight over to Labour or Liberal Democrat.
Dare I say it? On the whole, they don't much care if Major stays or
goes. Or if Jeremy Hanley remains as party chairman, or whether Douglas
Hurd is Foreign Secretary, Kenneth Clarke, Chancellor. It is a matter of
total indifference to them whether the Tory Party at Westminster sticks
together or sinks together.
They couldn't care less if the Tory Party panics, or how it panics in
the wake of such catastrophic election results. Mr Major can have as
many reshuffles as he likes, as many Commons defeats as may happen while
he clings to power ''for the greater good''.
It matters little if Tory back benchers lose and regain the Whip, or
lose it again. This arcane discipline cannot work while Tory MPs insist
that they know better than their leader. What it has demonstrated
dramatically over the past year is that a party that cannot unite,
cannot anticipate the support of the voters.
What is required is that the middle classes must be appeased, not
patronised. They must be given what they want if the Tories are not to
face a General Election disaster that will not only throw them out of
power, but deny it to them well into the next century. What is it that
is required? It is this: security in their homes, for which they want
preference. Couple this with much smaller classes to be taught by
well-educated teachers. I suspect that nursery education for all is more
important to the middle classes than the flaws or otherwise in the NHS.
These voters are smart enough to know that no Government can promise
full employment or indeed lifetime security in a white-collar job like a
bank or ICI. They are also sufficiently intelligent to realise that this
Government is attempting to regain their loyalty by returning to them
only what it has taken away in general taxation.
A succession of theoretical Tory Chancellors have taken away their tax
privileges in return for decreasing direct taxation. The misguided entry
into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism exposed this fragile deal with
the middle classes. While indirect taxes were piled on, the Treasury was
still whittling away mortgage tax relief and other perks like tax
advantages of company cars.
Stand on your own feet was the cry while the ground from under those
feet was being cut away. There was nothing to cushion these voters from
a recession that was deepened by Government financial policy. Now a
Cabinet that at last realises that it hangs together or will be hanged
together whimpers that it is doing unpopular things because in the long
term they are right for the nation.
That's as may be. But it is not enough to be forgiven, let alone to
re-galvanise Tory support. Nor is it enough to issue bleak warnings
about what Mr Blair may or may not do if he attains power next time.
(Wouldn't you know it? The Liberal Democrats are considering throwing in
their lot with Labour.)
The Tories have been aware for some time that tax cuts, however
trenchant, will not be enough to swing it their way again. What the
Cabinet and the parliamentary party need to do now for survival is make
a quantum leap back to the dogma of the eighties. They must reassert the
basic Tory belief in a property owning democracy.
That means compensating all those who lost out in the crash and are
left with homes that are a negative equity. Have they considered writing
off their debts, just as they write off the debts of industries they
intend to privatise? It means increasing, not decreasing, mortgage tax
relief. As long as the middle classes and those who aspire to middle
class are left holding the can for mistakes of their Government, it will
be their Government no longer.
To those who say that this would simply lead to another property boom
and bust, the disaffected middle classes say ''Bah''. If Government
needs to tamper at all, it can regulate mortgage lenders to pledging no
more than three times the income of the borrower, or some such, as it
used to be.
Homes and housing need a dramatic fresh start and a Tory manifesto in
two years' time will be too late to do it. Do it now and Mr Major may be
able once again to pass through a Tory council's domain, should he wish
to walk from Land's End to John O'Groats.
Naturally Cabinet Thatcherites like Michael Portillo will have to
swallow their theory of market forces to achieve this. Stephen Dorrell,
who thinks we should invest in stockbrokers, not mortgages, might be
upset. Who cares? What we are talking about is buying back voters who
have been sold out.
Since the Prime Minister believes that a single European currency
cannot come about until the next century why does he not state that he
would resign office rather than take us into one before then? It would
upset the Europhiles? Who cares? Those like Kenneth Clarke and Douglas
Hurd will have to swallow a much tougher line on Europe.
Positive bloody-mindedness is what the Tory middle classes require
from this Government when it is embroiled in resisting federalist forces
in the coming months. Thus far and no further is the line that Essex
man, followed by all-other-counties' man, now requires. Plus a
referendum on the result of the next Inter-Governmental Conference
negotiations.
Despite the ERM experience, for which the middle classes paid the
price, they still sense that this Government is fudging and trying to
lead them by their noses into something that their instincts abhor. That
goes for Blair's policy as much as Major's. The desire for a referendum
is becoming paramount.
But it is no good conceding this until people have been given their
homes back and the incentive to invest in their own homes is returned.
If Mr Major doesn't do it, I would not be at all surprised if Mr Blair
does. Tories who tell you that this is not as easy as it sounds are
Tories who have given up the ghost.

THAT our present Government is insensitive is amply exhibited in the
programme of celebration of the anniversary of VE Day.
It is not only that a major event which should involve all Britain is
centred in London but that the Megaconcert in Hyde Park -- supposedly a
tribute to all the Service men and women who were in the Forces
throughout the war -- will culminate in a 3000-strong choir singing
''There'll always be an England''. Perhaps the Government and the Royal
British Legion have forgotten that England did not win the war
singlehanded!
I served in the Army throughout the war as did many other Scots -- and
Irish -- and Welsh as did others in the Navy and RAF. We did not fight
''for England'' but against Hitler and all he stood for and for our own
way of life in Britain.
While the representatives of the present Government continually
emphasise the advantages of being a ''United Kingdom'' they do nothing
to advance their case in the present circumstances when the
glorification of ''England'' is an affront not only to the Scots, Irish,
and Welsh, but to all the Commonwealth countries who may be included in
the event on Saturday, May 6.

SCATHING criticism of the National Lottery was made by the Church of
Scotland's influential church and nation committee in a report issued
yesterday.
The report said the lottery was ''an ethically undesirable method of
raising public funds, primarily because of the immediate damage which it
does to civic responsibility and secondarily because of its likely
harmful consequences''.
To fund important public purposes, including the arts, the national
heritage, and the work of many voluntary organisations by this means
rather than through taxation or direct charitable giving was to
undermine the social responsibility both of government and individual
citizens.
Funding through a lottery militated against socially responsible
sharing. The committee said: ''It is by contrast an official
encouragement of acquisitiveness, a national legitimation of greed.
''It is a powerful symbol and reinforcement of the philosophy that the
purpose of life is to get rich, that people are and will remain
self-seeking, and that if all individuals pursue their own self-interest
the common good will automatically be served.
''It also militates against democratic decision-making in that
decisions about disbursement of the funds are taken by a body which is
not publicly accountable.''
The committee will ask the General Assembly to regret the setting up
of a National Lottery and urge the Government to ensure that funds
raised by it are not used as a substitute for the provision of a
responsible level of public funding.
On the possibility of a new political settlement in the United
Kingdom, the committee said that the times called for profound political
creativity.
It recalled the Assembly's statement in 1989 that the State's
sovereignty was relative to the fundamental sovereignty of a people
accountable to their Maker. ''This is the only secure and lasting basis
for any remoulding of democratic control of Scottish affairs within a
British and a European context.''
The committee wants the Assembly to urge the Government to increase
public funding of services to support victims of crime, and work ''to
counter further victimisation through the judicial process''.
* Lottery punters who have have failed to cash in their winning
tickets can start to panic -- they have just nine days to trace those
elusive paper slips to claim up to #600,000.
They are winners from the first weeks of the draw, which began last
November. In all, #17m is unclaimed, says the organisers, Camelot.
The deadline for the first week's winning tickets is May 17. If the
money is not claimed, it and accrued interest goes to the National
Lottery Distribution Fund and will be divided among five good causes.
The largest single unclaimed prize is #342,398 from the Christmas Eve
draw, but most of the unclaimed prizes are worth #10 each.
Three winners share this week's jackpot, each netting #3,097,415. They
won their share of the #9,292,245 pot by picking the six numbers: 5, 14,
17, 35, 43, and 48. The bonus number was 22. The 88 tickets which
successfully matched five plus the bonus number will get #32,490 each.
The 1047 tickets which matched five balls will receive #1706 each,
55,022 with four #71, and 1,035,673 with three #10.

THE Rev Alistair Dunlop interprets the argument, set out so clearly
and persuasively by Sir Donald Miller in favour of the retention of
Scottish Nuclear as a Scottish company, as a battlecry of nationalism
(May 2).
Perhaps it should be recalled that the accomplishments of the South of
Scotland Electricity Board, Scottish Power plc, and latterly Scottish
Nuclear within the past 25 years have not been achieved wholly without
contribution from English and Welsh colleagues.
There come to mind Lord Tombs of Brailes and Roy Berridge (chairmen);
Tony Pexton (engineering director); Roy Beatt and Don Green (chief
engineers), and Bpb Trotter and Derrick Evans (nuclear generation
engineers), to name but some.
I am sure that Sir Donald would be the last person to wish their parts
to be forgotten.

IS the Scottish National Party not being somewhat disingenuous in
arguing that the timing of the Tories' Scottish conference with the
Perth and Kinross by-election will give the Conservatives an advantage
in the contest (May 2)?
Everyone knows that the Tories have given up all hope of winning
by-elections in this parliament. The timing is much more to do with
saving the bacon on John Major and Ian Lang at their conference. The
Conservative Party is calculating on loyalty and disinclination to rock
the boat during the by-election campaign.
Perhaps the SNP's threat of legal action has more to do with feelings
of guilt over its failure to stand up for Scotland with Labour and the
Liberal Democrats at the time of the proposed Panorama interview with
the Prime Minister.

<HEADLINE>Plan is to replace 'equidistance' with 'independence'. Ashdown takes Lib Dems to the left</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978501856</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LIBERAL Democrat leader Mr Paddy Ashdown is planning to abandon his
party's policy of neutrality between the two main players and move
closer to Labour, it emerged yesterday.
A policy paper to be published next month effectively ditches the
party's much-vaunted ''equidistance'' between Labour and the Tories,
stressing its ''independence''.
The document is sure to spark controversy when it is debated by party
members at their annual conference in the autumn, some of whom will be
angry at moves to cosy up to ''new'' Labour.
As the next General Election approaches, voters will want to know
which side the Liberal Democrats would back in a hung Parliament. Mr
Ashdown warned they must make up their minds soon.
When asked whether the time had come for them to signal a preference,
he said: ''I think the party has to face up to a decision of this sort.
''It has to face up to it, in my view, quite soon,'' he told Channel
4's A Week in Politics.
''I believe the important thing for our party is to tackle this debate
in a very clear way at the right time and to make sure the party is
united in this process. That will happen, in my view, over the next
months and up to the autumn.''
He added: ''It is very difficult to decide where you are between two
vacuums.
''The Government is divided. No-one knows what they stand for. The
Labour Party is a blank space.''
Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat MP for Southwark and Bermondsey,
said the party could no longer refuse to say what it would do after the
next election.
''In the past, we have fudged that answer and it has neither been of
help to people fighting Labour . . .nor to people fighting the Tories,''
he told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend.
''The honest thing to do is to face up to that question and, well in
advance of an election, provide an answer.''
However, he warned against formal pacts with Labour, which he said
would go down badly in the many areas where the old-style Labour Party
still ran councils.
He added: ''I think the party will say not that we are equidistant but
that we are independent and that we agree on our policies where there is
agreement.
''There will not be a formal coalition. I don't believe there will be
a coalition government with us and Labour in it unless there is no
overall majority for the Labour Party.''
Labour firmly denied there were any moves on its part to ''cosy'' up
to the Liberal Democrats before the next election.
A spokesman for Labour leader Tony Blair said: ''There are no pacts.
There are no deals, and how the Liberal Democrats position themselves is
entirely a matter for them.''
He added that the leadership would also not be sending any signals to
Labour groups in hung councils over whether to make deals with other
parties.
Councillors are engaged in discussions around Britain to decide how to
share power in local authorities where no party has overall control
after the local elections.
Shadow Chancellor Mr Gordon Brown said: ''This is an important
recognition by Mr Ashdown that it is no longer tenable to hold the view
that somehow the Liberal Party could support a Conservative Party after
the next election.
''Mr Ashdown is recognising it is Labour that has been leading the
debate in this country. We are the party of new ideas,'' he told Radio
4.
Although the leadership is cool about links with Mr Ashdown's troops,
some Labour MPs would like to see closer ties.
This week, Mr Calum MacDonald, MP for the Western Isles, will launch a
group called Labour Initiative on Co-operation to discuss closer
co-operation with the Lib Dems.
Although the leadership is not involved in the group, Mr Blair is said
to be quite relaxed about it and happy for MPs to talk about the issues.

YET another dispirited report blaming the slump in retail sales on the
lack of the elusive feel-good factor (Business Herald).
The reason is really much more obvious than that. The frantic scramble
to put up more and more retail centres means that the cake no longer
goes round. You can drop prices until they are out of sight but if the
retail capacity exceeds the available spend, it's a meagre outlook for
all.
Here in Strathaven we are grasping the challenge of survival in the
face of the present over-capacity with both hands. Many small towns
share our problems. But we are confident we have the right approach to
maintaining our share of consumer interest.
Retailers, cafe owners, hoteliers, almost entirely family businesses,
are pulling together to market our town as a whole. Prices are
undoubtedly competitive, the merchandise is refreshingly different from
that in the mall chain stores, and service to the customer is paramount.
We are out to prove, by the excellence of our product, we can exist in
the face of over-capacity and enormous competitive forces.

AS A long-standing resident of Eastwood, now East Renfrewshire, I read
the article by John MacCalman with not a little amusement tempered by
irritation (May 1).
Why is Eastwood always a ''leafy suburb''? And to describe it as
''sacred Conservative territory'' is journalistic waffle. The electors
of Netherlee, for example, have again returned an excellent councillor
on an Independent ticket who will act and vote independently, pace Brian
Meek.
As citizens we accept the democratic verdict and do not view Mr Owen
Taylor as a bogyman or his administration as ready to sweep on Newton
Mearns as Alaric and his Visigoths intent on the sack of Rome.
Mr Taylor and his administration will be judged on their performance
and not pre-judged before their posteriors have warmed the council
seats.

There are two very good reasons for learning and using Esperanto.
First, it is the only language in the world that is likely to be

KONIN: A QUEST
By Theo Richmond Jonathan Cape: #18.99
IN the forest, in season, mushrooms poke through a rich litter of
undergrowth. Once, it's said, the mushroom gatherers found a gold ring
cushioned on a soft white dome pushing through the ground. The ring must
have belonged to one of the thousands of Jewish victims stripped naked
and flung into lime pits in the Kazimierz forest in 1941.
Kazimierz was where Jews from the Polish country town of Konin once
picnicked. Now it's the site of a mass grave. Theo Richmond read about
it in the Konin Memorial Book, a compilation of 800 pages put together
in Israel by Jewish survivors 20 years after the war ended.
Theo Richmond's Jewish grandfather left Konin long before that, in
1913. Richmond, raised in London, had only a passing interest in the
book, to which he subscribed more from a sense of duty than from
particular interest. Mostly it was in Yiddish, which he couldn't read
(and which he took at first to be Hebrew because they share the same
characters). The passage about Kazimierz was in Polish, equally
inaccessible. The book lay neglected in his home in London.
Idly thumbing through the pages eight years ago he came on a long list
of names which he realised was a roll call of all the Konin Jews killed
in the Holocaust -- the Shoah, in Hebrew. Under the letter R came
several entries for people called Ryczke, the family name before his
father anglicised it. These lost people were his relatives.
''I turned over the pages and knew that a decision had been made for
me'', he explains in the introduction. ''I must write a book of my
own''.
It is a spellbinding work. There have been numerous accounts of the
Shoah. Some, like Martin Gilbert's The Holocaust, are detailed
histories. Others are accounts of personal sufferings. Richmond's book
is neither of these. The subtitle explains his purpose: it is a quest to
discover who his forebears in Konin were, how they lived, what they did
and what happened to them when the great darkness fell. In the course of
this quest he discovers a way of life that is lost forever, he peoples
the story with a host of brilliantly observed characters, and he infuses
it with the excitement and suspense of painstaking detection.
Konin stands some 200 kilometres west of Warsaw on territory which was
Russian before 1914. It has little claim to fame. It features only once
in Martin Gilbert's magisterial overview, rating a couple of lines
because Jewish prisoners set their camp there ablaze in a futile act of
defiance. Gilbert does not mention the dreadful massacre in Kazimierz
wood.
Richmond restores it vividly to life. He gives an account of its
history and describes the daily life of its bustling Jewish quarter --
where, on September 1, 1939, when Poland was invaded, Jews formed almost
25% of the town's population.
Even the endpapers tell a story. At the front is a map of the town
centre -- just a gridiron pattern of streets and squares bounded by the
river Warta. The same map is printed at the back but this time
overwritten with a network of spidery notes and scrawled arrows showing
where different families lived, where shops were situated, where
activities took place, the result of Richmond's meticulous researches.
There is the park where a ''Russian Army band played in Sundays in
summer'', the distillery where ''Ryczke family and others drew free hot
water'', the block containing the ''Kosher slaughter house'', the
riverside where ''live fish kept under water in slatted crates'', the
''Town Jail -- hostages taken from here'' and, close by, ''hostages shot
here''.
The two men executed were Aleksander Kurowski, a Christian, and
Mordechai Slodki, a Jewish cloth trader aged 70, both picked at random
from a group of hostages rounded up in the first days of the Nazi
occupation. A photograph shows the scene in the cobbled square, with the
two men blindfolded against a wall, the firing party lined up with guns
raised, and a steel-helmeted German guard turning to look at the camera.
A small boy called Isador Hahn (whose fair hair and blue eyes disguised
his Jewish birth) squeezed into the crowd of Poles summoned to watch the
assasinations. Later the same Izzy Hahn, now running a successful
business in London's East End, proved to be one of Richmond's most
useful contacts, even volunteering to accompany him to Konin as guide
and interpreter.
Inevitably Richmond reflects on the attitude of the Poles towards
their Jewish compatriots, which too often betrays an anti-Semitism
endemic in Polish society. The double killing of Christian and Jew
failed to bring the threatened community together. There were notable
instances of selfless bravery but many cases of villainy and treachery.
Richmond is not partisan. He appreciates the warmth of working-class
Jewish life in Konin and he can respect many of its traditional values
and beliefs, even though he may not share them. He is affectionately
amused at their excesses. His discussion of anti-Semitism is balanced
and rational (he mentions the awful revenge some death camp inmates took
on fleeing German families after liberation). Habits of dress, religion,
speech, and attitude, ingrained and meticulously protected, isolated
Jewish communities from their neighbours. He points out that ''Jewish
apartheid, which began with compulsory segregation in the medieval
ghetto, persisted not solely as a result of Christian prejudice but
through choice. Ethnic exclusivity was a means of preserving the
species''.
Richmond's years of research took him to America, Israel, and finally
Poland. His description of arriving at Konin and of discovering the
places he already knew well in his mind is graphic -- I shared his
growing excitement vicariously.
Vibrant personalities fill these pages. There is Lola Birnbaum, a
redoubtable old lady with pebble glasses whose sentences tumble out in a
confused mixture of Yiddish and Brooklyn English -- she arrived in
America after the war with only a few clothes, a pillow, a spoon, an
iron, and two dollars. There are Ignac and Miriam Grossman, still
touchingly devoted to each other after years of adversity. And many
more. And there is Richmond himself, an unobtrusive, sympathetic
listener (not to mention a superb writer).
Standing at the doorway of the Ryczke home in Konin, he looked up at a
balcony which ''belonged to the apartment where my father's eldest
brother lived. The Germans murdered him and his wife''. Below it lived
the Leben family. The same. And his father's sister and her family. The
same. His grandfather's people. The same.
The passage echoes a comment by Konin's most famous son, a fellow
scientist with Einstein. In 1963 Leopold Infeld returned briefly to the
town he had left in disgust 40 years earlier. ''I have tried to find out
what happened to my best pupils'', wrote Konin's former reluctant
schoolteacher. ''Always the same answer: murdered, murdered, murdered''.
They live again by grace of Richmond's book.

FIFTY years ago tonight, in my native village of Maud in
Aberdeenshire, we raised a pile of rubbish on a disused site and lit the
bonfire which symbolised that Victory in Europe. It was the simple
celebration of a rural community, as much as we could do to mark the end
of a war which had torn into our lives in the most unimaginably
devastating way.
In reality, it would take another three months before the atomic
bombing of Japan would finally end the Second World War but, for us, the
biggest conflict in human history was now over.
Those flames which licked the evening sky were the surest sign that
the black-out days were gone, lighting up a world which might be hard to
recognise in the aftermath of those nightmare years.
To a 14-year-old schoolboy it was a curious emotional experience, one
which almost certainly affected the rest of my life. That early
childhood, well remembered from the 1930s, had seemed like a golden
decade of summer days and picnics at Fraserburgh beach, Louis Zanre's
ice-cream and the first stirrings of love in the infant class of Maud
School.
The smell of jotters and Miss Catto's cocoa and the gentle perfume of
the girl beside me teased the senses into anticipation of a wonderful
world which lay somewhere beyond our village horizon.
In our remote community, the highlight of my 1930s childhood had been
the family outing to the Empire Exhibition at Bellahouston Park,
Glasgow, just a year before war broke out. When they lowered the lights
on that greatest of all Scottish spectacles, 365,000 people were singing
and dancing in the rain. The Lambeth Walk it was.
Little did that crowd realise that the lights which dimmed over
Bellahouston that night would symbolise not just the end of an
exhibition but the end of an empire as well.
Chamberlain was already on his way back from Munich and soon that
golden age of childhood was tarnished in the name of Hitler's war. Gone
for the next six years were the picnics and the ice-cream, the oranges
and bananas.
Gone were the bright-lit streets which had so recently, with the
coming miracle of electricity, replaced the flickering oil-lamps of
Victorian days.
Gone were the young men of our community, waving bravely to those left
on the station platform, some never to see their beloved Buchan fields
again.
Gone were the summer days of childhood with their glamour and gaiety
-- or so they seemed to the young innocent still blissfully unaware of a
Depression or the gathering Nazi menace.
In place of all that came darkness, the scudding clouds of war and the
blacking out of all lights. We carried gas-masks to school, in case
Hitler might resort to poison, and welcomed children from Dowanhill and
Hyndland Schools in Glasgow as our evacuee guests.
All life took on a dimmer hue. But the common danger, with its
prospect of extinction, bound the people in a genuine spirit of caring
and helpfulness which I have not seen repeated in the past 50 years.
What a pity it takes a war to do that.
For a schoolboy, there was the consolation of whole battalions
descending on a village scene to train for the battles ahead. Naval
convoys passed up our Buchan coast and reports of a crashing German
aircraft sent us scampering out of school to stand mesmerised by the
wreckage.
But after D-Day in 1944, the excitement of war began to pall, even for
the schoolboy who saw it now only in terms of dimmed lights and lost
bananas, of deprivation and bleakness, not to mention the heavy hearts
that came with the postie's dreaded telegram.
The end could not come soon enough. And as the Allied forces closed in
on Germany and Montgomery prepared to take the unconditional surrender
on Luneberg Heath, we listened for the promised announcement of VE Day.
Listened, that is, to the wireless which dominated our lives
throughout that war even more than television does today. Even now I
have not lost that wartime affection for the BBC.
To me, Broadcasting House in Langham Place was one of three symbols of
hope and stability, the others being Winston Churchill and the chimes of
Big Ben. Whatever attempts are being made to distance Scotland from the
VE Day commemorations, I trace my willingness to remain British as well
as Scottish to that wartime link. It was Scotland's war every bit as
much as England's.
So, when we lit that bonfire in Maud on May 8, 1945, I had one ear on
the wireless, listening to the celebrations in London, with its crowds
thronging Piccadilly Circus, the Mall, and Trafalgar Square.
Churchill was out on the balcony of Buckingham Palace and, already
with the potential newspaperman's nose for news, I had a sense of being
in the wrong place. The ''story'' was mainly in London.
So, with the approach of the fiftieth anniversary, I vowed that that
was where I would be this time -- milling around the Mall, Hyde Park,
and Buckingham Palace. I have even booked a hotel room looking directly
across the street to Broadcasting House.
And that's where I'll be on this fiftieth anniversary -- remembering
that day when I sought to resume an interrupted boyhood.

A MURDER inquiry has been launched in Clydebank after a man was
attacked by a group of men and left dying from his injuries in a pool of
blood.
The victim, Mr Edward Maxwell, 28, was playing football with friends
on a grassy area in Kirkoswald Drive near Tarbolton Square in Clydbank
when a red car drew up and a group of men got out at about 9pm on
Saturday.
The men then attacked Mr Maxwell, of Atlas Cottages in Clydebank,
before making off in the car.
An ambulance was called but Mr Maxwell died from his injuries at the
scene. The car was found abandoned a short time later in Abbeylands
Road, Clydebank.
Local residents yesterday laid flowers at the spot where Mr Maxwell
died.
Police, who have set up an incident room at Clydebank police station,
have not been able to establish whether there was a link between the
murder and recent incidents in the area.
Detective Inspector Robert Bryce said: ''There have been a number of
violent incidents in Clydebank in recent months. However, at the moment,
we are not able to establish whether this latest incident is linked.''
The police have appealed for any witnesses to the incident or the car
being abandoned to contact them.
A report is to be submitted to the procurator-fiscal.

LITTLE more than a week ago we noted two little opportunistic
snowballs trickling down the sides of Mount Ashdown and Mount Blair,
those majestic twin peaks of opposition. The snowballs consisted of the
merest whispers of hints that the Liberal Democrats and New Labour have
realised at last that they are not all that far apart on a number of
issues and that it might make sense for them to consider some sort of
co-operation in the future. Now, everyone knows what happens to
snowballs as they roll downwhill; they get bigger. Judging by the
conclusions of some commentators over the weekend these particular
snowballs have not just got bigger; they are now enormous and about to
join together to form an avalanche. Specifically, the charge is that Mr
Ashdown and Mr Blair are considering the formation of an anti-Tory
alliance in the aftermath of their respective successes in the local
election results right across the country, from Scotland to deepest,
darkest England.  This is nonsense. It is such complete nonsense that
there must be suspicions that it is intended to drum up some sort of
sympathy for the poor Tories, knocked about in the playground by
individual school bullies and now dismayed to find that the bullies have
joined together to do a better job in tandem. Such sympathy would be a
waste of time. Nor does the thesis of an anti-Tory pack hang together.
Mr Ashdown has properly warned his party that its policy of
''equidistance'' between Labour and Tories is no longer sustainable and
he is right.
The Liberal Democrats must abandon this pretence and define those
areas of policy in which they are closer to one of the major parties
than to the other. Inevitably, given their long and honourable history,
this will mean that they have more in common with Labour than with the
Tories. It is perfectly respectable to say so. The electorate will
appreciate it, as will open-minded party workers. A firm pact or
alliance would be fatal, as both party leaders know perfectly well.

THE History of Anaesthesia Society is holding its summer meeting in
Glasgow and part of the programme is devoted to a mini-symposium on
Scottish scientists whose work has important applications in
anaesthesia.
Among these is Glasgow-born Thomas Graham (1805-69), a statue of whom
stands in George Square.
Graham was a founder and the first president of what is now the Royal
Society of Chemistry and was a vice-president of the Royal Society.
A recent inquiry revealed that neither of these bodies had any record
of where Graham was buried. He died in London, but a survey of the great
London cemeteries drew a blank. Inquiries further afield brought the
information from the Mitchell Library that according to a local
guidebook he is buried ''in the grounds of Glasgow Cathedral'' (St
Mungo's).
Within days of his death The Glasgow Herald carried a long obituary
notice, but I have not been able to find any report of his funeral.
Our members like to know where people are buried, and it rounds off a
talk nicely, so if any readers has knowledge of the exact location of
Thomas Graham's grave, I and at least one somewhat embarrassed learned
society in London would be most grateful for the information.

NO BRITISH footballer since George Best has made more headlines than
Paul Gascoigne, and, like Best, he has managed to tunnel from the back
pages into the front far too often for his admirers' liking.
Gascoigne has wept more often than any of his international peers,
cracked more jokes, delighted and infuriated more fans and managed to
play less football in a career that has been regularly interrupted by
serious injuries, off-the-field scandals and public rows.
He can be class on the field and crass off it, yet at 28 there is
plenty of time for this immensely talented Geordie to reach the pinnacle
that is his for the scaling if he can focus entirely on what he does
best.
Gazza, as his team-mates and the tabloids inevitably tagged him, has
not had the best of fortune since the day he was carried off after
lunging recklessly at Nottingham Forest player Gary Charles in the FA
Cup final of 1991. He suffered ligament damage which was exacerbated
when he fell down after being punched in an apparently unprovoked attack
in a Newcastle nightclub. There were many who felt the injury was so bad
it would finish his career but there is no shortage of courage in the
complex Gascoigne make-up, and he was transferred from Tottenham Hotspur
to Lazio in Italy for #5.5m in July when he was still recovering.
He made his debut for the Rome club that September but since then has
been hampered by a series of injuries, culminating in a badly broken
leg, suffered in training, a year ago.
There were further mutterings about his playing days being finished
but the man from Gateshead has bounced back once again, making his
return to the Lazio side a month ago.
What happens next will depend greatly on the persuasive powers of
Rangers manager Walter Smith and chairman David Murray, but Lazio have
declared their desire to see him off the premises to make way for
another foreign signing. Wherever he goes, the chances are he will make
news.
The volatile nature of the man who was an apprentice at Newcastle
United when Kevin Keegan and Peter Beardsley were the star turns is such
that the spotlight never fails to pick him out.
Yet if Bobby Robson, who was later to become England manager, had
predicted correctly when he was in charge of Ipswich Town, the most
famous England internationalist of the past decade would not have made
it as a professional. Robson, who was to become his boss and mentor at
national level on that famous, or infamous, occasion in 1990 when
Gascoigne broke down and cried during the semi-final of the World Cup in
Italy, once told the schoolboy Gazza that he was too small.
The chubby, cheeky 5ft 6in boy who loved Mars Bars became an
apprentice at Newcastle, where he once was caught draining the dregs out
of the glasses in the directors' lounge and perhaps warranted the
description some time later by the Newcastle chairman as ''George Best
without the brains''.
In June, 1998, he was transferred for #2m to Spurs but it took some
time before he convinced Robson, now England's manager, that he was the
man for his country. By the World Cup finals of 1990, however, he was
established as the midfield playmaker of the England show, but that
unpredictable temper was still inclined to get him into trouble. He was
booked in the semi-final, realised that meant he would miss the final
(which England didn't reach, in any case) and wept.
Other Gazza escapades had exercised the tabloid headline writers and,
ironically, as he considers moving to Rangers, he was the subject of
much conroversy in a pre-season tournament when he spat at Iain
Ferguson.
His arrival in Rome prompted great expectations but the Lazio fans, as
temperamentally uncertain as their new hero, have had few opportunities
to sing his praises. He missed almost half of his first season because
of fractured ribs, a hamstring injury, thigh problems, and an Achilles
tendon injury.
Along the way he made the other type of headlines, when he was told to
appear before a Rome court on an assault charge; when the club warned
him they would take ''serious meaures'' after he failed to turn up as
ordered at a game against Napoli; when he emptied a plate of spaghetti
over a team-mate; and when he refused to play in a friendly game,
preferring to go to Euro Disney with his girlfriend, Sheryl and her
children.
He did not endear himself to the Norwegian public when, in advance of
an England World Cup qualifying match with Norway he offered a message
to that country's fans, thinking the cameras were not rolling: ''****
off'' was his advice.
The following year he was fined #9000 for belching into a mike on live
TV when asked for his views on being left out of the Lazio team, was in
trouble with the club when he appeared to be overweight at the start of
the season, and had a punch-up with a photographer.
He broke down in tears after a clash with coach Dino Zoff, whom he
swore at during a traing session. Other lowlights included an assault on
a photographer as he flew back to London for hopsital treatment (he
poured a glass of water over him).
In Rome he moved into a #2600-a-month villa with four bedrooms, a
swimming pool, and a private lake. He and his pal, Jimmy ''Fivebellies''
Gardner, are reputedly fond of Newcastle Brown Ale. He is an incurable
prankster but had to parade his shame when admitting that he had been
violent towards his girlfriend.
He went on TV last summer to confess that he had failed to come to
terms with his fame. ''I'm a young lad and I shouldn't have to take this
pressure,'' he said. ''I get it more than anyone else in England and
sometimes I can't cope. I try to be funny but at the end of the day I am
a serious person.''
Terry Butcher, the former England captain, said this week that the
Ibrox dressing-room could anticipate a non-stop series of pranks from
the man whose nervous energy works both for and against him, and Hibs'
Scottish internationalist Darren Jackson, a former team-mate of
Gascoigne's at Newcastle, has no doubt about the impact he would make on
Scotland.
''The Ibrox fans have loved Brian Laudrup but they would go absolutely
nuts about Gascoigne,'' said Jackson. ''He is the most incredible man, a
charismatic player who, had he not suffered so many injuries, would have
been the No 1 player in the world by now.''
Gazza the clown or Gazza the genius? Maybe the truth is that he comes
in a package deal. You get more than you pay for.

Sarajevo, Sunday
SHELLS killed nine people in a Muslim area of Sarajevo today in the
first major attack on the Bosnian capital since a ceasefire ended a week
ago.
The bodies of six men and two women were taken to the city morgue and
hospitals treated 10 seriously wounded after the Butmir suburb was
shaken by five explosions in 15 minutes.
One man died later as surgeons tried to save his life.
Across the country in Banja Luka masked Bosnian Serbs today blew up a
Roman Catholic church and monastery, killing an 80-year-old monk in an
apparent revenge attack for last week's Croatian army blitz which
recaptured a Serb-held enclave inside neighbouring Croatia.
Serbs in Banja Luka in northern Bosnia have already destroyed its
historic mosques, some of them several hundred years old.
Sarajevo was shelled as the United Nations withdrew an earlier threat
to order Nato air strikes against Serbs bombarding the Bosnian Muslim
town of Bihac. UN sources said they feared Nato intervention would
worsen tensions.
Mediators are struggling to stop Bosnia sliding back into all-out war
and chaos after the Muslim-led government and Bosnian Serbs refused to
extend the ceasefire.
The Nato threat was made after civilians in Bihac -- a so-called
''safe haven'' -- had been shelled daily since the truce ended last
Monday. One attack narrowly missed a hospital crowded with 800 patients.
Meanwhile, Serb civilians fleeing a Croatian army blitz were found
dead in burning cars after apparently being caught in crossfire, UN
sources said today.
The refugee column may have have been riddled by small arms fire or
hit by shelling as it wound through the hamlet of Nova Varos in western
Slavonia on its way to a bridge over the Sava River and into
neighbouring Bosnia.
Retreating peacekeepers saw bodies in seven or eight vehicles but
could not be certain how many there were.--Reuter.

EVIDENCE of CIA misconduct in the Lockerbie investigation continues to
mount, with accusations that the Central Intelligence Agency misused the
cover of national security to shield reckless activities, abuses of
power, and amoral conduct.
A film, The Maltese Double Cross, to be aired in Germany this month,
reveals the CIA's chief investigator, Vicent Cannestero, ran a two-year
dirty tricks campaign against Libya in the 1980s, out of the White
House. It is also alleged that Cannestero was not brought into the
Lockerbie case until the American Government determined that it was
politically expedient to lay the blame for the bombing at Libya's
doorstep. The US Attorney General who announced the Libyan indictments
was William Barr, a former analyst at the CIA. He had worked at the spy
agency under the director George Bush. President George Bush appointed
Barr the country's chief law enforcement officer in 1990.
Cannestero spearheaded the charges that two Libyan agents planted the
bomb on Air Malta flight KM 180, which was then transloaded aboard Pan
Am flight 103 in Frankfurt. However, a civil action last year in a
London High Court, Air Malta versus Granada Television, proved no such
bag ever existed. One solicitor close to the case was quoted as saying:
''The American and British case against the Libyans has now turned to
dust.''
In the day after the crash, CIA agents removed evidence from the site,
according to witnesses, and may even have removed a body from the scene.
At least five US intelligence agents were aboard Pan Am flight 103 that
fateful night in December 1988, one of whom was Daniel O'Connor of the
American embassy in Cyprus -- whose name never appeared on the list of
the dead. The film also says one of the passengers, Kalid Jafaar, was a
US informant placed on the plane by the CIA and accompanied by Mathew
Gannon, a CIA officer. The American Government has repeatedly denied
Jafaar had any affiliation with the CIA or any other agency.
But Jafaar's grandfather, Mustafa, said from his home in Lebanon's
Bekaa Valley, Kalid's travels were arranged by the American Government,
through the Drug Enforcement Administration office in Cyprus. The Cyprus
DEA office was working closely with the CIA. Disclosures of previous
joint covert co-operations have been confirmed in court records in the
US and in Italy.
The CIA is the most skilled practitioner of undemocratic arts, but far
from the only one. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pentagon,
the State Department, and the White House have invoked state secrecy to
hide misdeeds. One of Richard Nixon's first gambits to shut down
Watergate investigators was to instruct the CIA to tell the Justice
Department the matter involved security secrets too sensitive to pursue.
Other incidents include plots to assassinate foreign leaders, the
oppression of domestic dissent during the Vietnam War, the covert
bombing of Cambodia, and the Iran-Contra affair.
Anyone who doubts that secrecy is still a Washington disease need look
no further than House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Gingrich's recent response
to Congressman Robert Torricelli's efforts to expose a CIA-backed murder
of an American citizen in Guatemala, is revealing. Mr Gingrich attacked
his colleague for causing ''a public embarrassment to the United
States''.
The CIA told the Senate Intelligence Committee: ''The case simply
slipped under the carpet, in all honesty.'' ''That's a big carpet,''
responded Senator Richard Shelby, as he and others on the Senate panel
accused the spy agency of misleading Congress.
CIA complicity in the 1990 murder was leaked to Torricelli by someone
using National Security Agency letterheads. The NSA is the super secret
electronic spy agency controlled by the Pentagon. It is no secret among
Washington insiders that the Pentagon and the CIA have been conducting a
secret war with each other, under threat of huge Congressional budget
cuts. ''It's a fight for survival,'' a Pentagon budget expert explained.
President Truman created the CIA in 1947 to make the intelligence
function directly accountable to the President. Its predecessor, the OSS
at the Pentagon, was dissolved in the process, reflecting Truman's
distrust and disdain for the military, amplified by General Douglas
McArthur's misconduct in Korea -- and Truman's subsequent firing of one
of America's military icons.
But by 1964 Mr Truman had to admit the CIA itself was out of control.
''The CIA was set up by me for the sole purpose of getting all the
available information to the President. It was not intended to operate
as an international agency engaged in strange activities,'' the retired
US President wrote from his home in Independence, Missouri.
With each scandal-ridden derailment at the CIA, the Pentagon began
retrieving bits of the intelligence puzzle, piece by piece. Today, of
the $28 billion America spends on gathering intelligence,
Pentagon-managed agencies absorb four-fifths. Former CIA director
William Colby calls the Pentagon's intelligence structure ''the
900-pound intelligence gorilla''.
The secret Iran arms deal to funnel funds to the Contras in Nicaragua
was opposed by the Pentagon from the beginning. It was the creation of
CIA director William Casey, in the Reagan administration. The military
saw Casey as reckless, out of control, and dangerous. It was determined
Casey's diabolical creation, directed by Oliver North, had to be watched
closely, and when politically advantageous, exposed.
The Pentagon did just that on November 3, 1986. Super secret spies
with the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) in Lebanon leaked detailed
accounts of Oliver North's visits to Iran, to organise the sale of TOW
missiles to Ayatolla Khomeini's government. The story broke in a Beirut
newspaper. The resulting scandal wrecked the secret arms deal and
ultimately forced President Reagan to fire North. Upon getting the news,
it is said, the Defence Secretary, Casper Weinberger, danced a jig in
his Pentagon office.
The DIA was created during the Kennedy administration. According to a
recently published study by Georgetown University's Institute for the
Study of Diplomacy, the DIA was supposed to subsume the separate army,
navy and air force intelligence organisations. Instead, the report says:
''A robust DIA was added to a robust set of service intelligence
structures.''
The DIA, with a budget of $600m is not restricted by civilian
oversight from Congress or the White House. While the CIA's director is
subject to presidential appointment and Senate confirmation, the DIA's
directorate is cloaked in secrecy. Today, the DIA duplicates many of the
functions normally attributed to the CIA, including running its own
human intelligence (HUMINT) covert operations around the world. It has
quietly built close alliances with America's intelligence allies,
including the British (MI6), who have always felt uncomfortable dealing
with the CIA, where politicians, not professionals, have the final say.
The latest element of the CIA-Pentagon turf battle is being played out
in the back rooms of Capitol Hill. Pro-CIA elements are advocating
budget cuts at the Pentagon. If the Pentagon hierarchy has its way,
however, it will be the remaining scraps of a dysfunctional CIA that
will be gobbled up by the ''900-pound intelligence gorilla''.
Consequently, America's future secret dirty laundry will be hidden
away in the bowels of the Pentagon, and Harper's Magazine editor, Lewis
Lapham's prediction will likely come true -- ''America is evolving from
a democracy into a national security state''.

A REMARKABLE three-year row over a rickety shed at a holiday house on
a remote Scottish island has been settled.
The wrangle centred on the siting of the weather-worn, 30-year-old
wooden toolshed near the shoreline of the Firth of Lorne -- and it went
right to the Scottish Office.
Inquiry Reporter William Patterson has ruled that Argyll and Bute
District Council was wrong to order removal of the hut at 27 Cullipool
on Luing, south of Oban. Mr Patterson reckoned the felt-roofed toolshed,
owned by Mrs M Stewart, actually enhanced the area.
In his determination of Mrs Stewart's appeal against the refusal of
planning permission, the Reporter found the two-metre-square shed was of
modest size and of a type of construction that must have fallen out of
use many years ago.
''A visitor noting these features, together with the shed's weathered
paintwork, might well suppose that it had been in its present position
for decades,'' he said.
''My overall conclusion is that the little building has an accidental
and slightly shabby charm that is fitting for the location and that it
enhances rather than diminishes the character and appearance of the
conservation area.''
The hut stands on a grassy area by the shoreline opposite 27
Cullipool, a terraced settlement of slate quarrymen's cottages, at the
north end of the island. Before being moved, according to Mrs Stewart,
it stood in the garden of 11 Cullipool for about 25 years.
Argyll and Bute District Council issued an enforcement notice on
September 15, 1993, alleging that the shed was erected without
authorisation in a prominent site, was of an unsympathetic design, and
directed that it be removed within one month.
Mrs Stewart, of Tarland, Aberdeenshire, who uses the cottage for
holiday lets, appealed against the order, claiming she was told that
planning permission would not be required and that she needed it to
store bikes, garden tools, and boat parts.
After a site visit, Mr Patterson found that the shed's position was
actually traditional in Cullipool, where terraced cottages were built
without back doors. Many of the original structures were used as
lavatories.

THE prospect of councillors moving out of Glasgow's magnificent City
Chambers, leaving it to be used for purely ceremonial purposes and
opened to the public as a museum cum tourist attraction has triggered
alarm among district members.
It seems many of the newcomers elected last month to the new
''shadow'' City of Glasgow Council are more impressed by the facilities
available to councillors at Strathclyde House and would prefer to be
based there than amid the architectural grandeur of the City Chambers,
which has been the centre of civic government for more than a century.
''Old guard'' councillors are horrified at the prospect, however,and
senior Conservative, Bailie John Young, has promised to lead a sit-in at
the City Chambers should the new order suggest de-camping to the
regional council's modern office complex at India Street.
A furious Bailie Young said: ''I would disagree very strongly with any
such move. I think they've got a downright cheek. They're not in the
place five minutes and they want to turn the City Chambers into a
mausoleum. It's just not on.
''I think there would be a sit-in among a whole group of district
councillors of various political persuasions. We're just not going to
India Street. This move would be resisted every inch of the way.''
Describing Strathclyde House as ''a most barren place, resembling a
Social Security office,'' he advocated that the complex should be sold
off as quickly as possible.
He reminded new councillors that the City Chambers was the focal point
for all the citizens of Glasgow. They had never looked to Strathclyde
House, and most would not know where it was.
''As far as I'm concerned, the Lord Provost is the First Citizen and
the City Chambers is the centre. And that's the way it's going to
stay,'' Councillor Young said.
Recently, new members of the ''shadow'' authority were given a tour of
Strathclyde House and were impressed by the facilities available to
members there, especially if many of the large regional functions
continued to be run from Strathclyde House rather than being transferred
to the City Chambers.
Councillor Robert Gould, Labour leader of both Strathclyde region and
the new City of Glasgow Council, emphasised that there were no proposals
for councillors to be based at Strathclyde House but indicated that the
issue would be considered if it were raised by members.
He said: ''The whole atmosphere of Strathclyde House is different.
It's a comparatively new building and there's a lot of brightness in it.
''Some of the people who haven't had any experience of the City
Chambers don't feel any great commitment to it. When they go about the
dark corridors of the City Chambers, they might feel things could be
brighter at Strathclyde House.''
Likewise, he said, there were no plans for the future utilisation of
the City Chambers. However, it was possible some people might consider
the City Chambers could be used as ''some sort of Lord Mayor's House''
for receiving dignitaries and holding banquets, as well as being the
venue for the full council meeting.
Councillor Gould commented: ''I'm not saying that's how things should
be at this stage but I have heard some members making the comment that
they might consider basing themselves at Strathclyde House because it's
brighter than the City Chambers.
''All the big service departments are at Strathclyde House and that's
80% of the business of the new council.''
What would he suggest for the future use of what is possibly the first
council headquarters in Europe?
''I think we could turn it into a first-class asset for the city.
''We should give the building back to the people and, whatever that
takes, we may consider doing that.''
While Councillor Gould refused to be drawn further, it is understood
this could involve using it as a city centre museum, converting the
councillors' dining room into a cafeteria.
Informed sources have suggested that a move to Strathclyde House would
take the warring McFadden and Lally factions out of their natural
habitat at the City Chambers and perhaps lead to an improvement in
behaviour patterns.
''That wouldn't be a bad thing,'' concluded Councillor Gould, who is
committed to ending Glasgow's infamous factional warfare.

SEAMEN who man the 24 Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels supplying British
Servicemen and women, including those in the United Nations peacekeeping
force in Bosnia, are moving towards unprecedented industrial action over
pay.
Talks are to be held in Portsmouth tomorrow in a bid to defuse the row
which has been simmering for more than a year after the 1200 civilian
crew members were offered 1%, compared to increases of between 3 and
4.5% made to the armed forces.
Pressure from their union, the Rail, Maritime and Transport union
(RMT), led to the offer being improved to 2% but the Ministry of Defence
insisted that would remain unconsolidated -- would not count for
pensions or premium payments -- unless crews agreed to
performance-related pay.
The 2% unconsolidated offer was subsequently rejected by a 2-1
majority. Since then a series of meetings has been held, including
several under the auspices of the conciliation service ACAS, resulting
in a ''final offer'' of 2% unconsolidated backdated to April 1, 1994,
and a further, as yet unquantified, unconsolidated payment from April 1,
1995, with both payments to be consolidated if a joint working party on
performance-related pay reaches an ''acceptable'' position.
That ''final'' offer was thrown out by 629 votes to 93 by crews who
went on to indicate their willingness to back industrial action,
including 24-hour stoppages in ports, by a vote of 490 to 70.
The results of that referendum will be put to MoD negotiators tomorrow
with a warning that unless the offer is improved then a legal industrial
action ballot will be staged.
RMT general secretary Jimmy Knapp said: ''What a way to treat the
forces back-up staff who are asked to perform critical and dangerous
work almost anywhere in the world.''
It was quite ludicrous to insist on profit-related pay for crews who
might have to to sail into areas where their lives were at risk, he
said, adding that it was ironic that these workers, often seen as the
fourth element of the armed forces, should be forced to the brink of
unprecedented industrial action at a time when the nation was
celebrating VE-Day.
RMT national shipping officer Tony Santamara said he was confident the
anger and frustration communicated to the union from ships across the
world would result in a vote to support industrial action.
RFA vessels can be away from their home bases, which include
Portsmouth and Rosyth, for up to nine months. Several are currently
supporting the Falklands garrison and in the Adriatic off Bosnia. Their
crews are civilian but expected to man weapons in the event of
hostilities. Crews currently earn between #10,000 and #16,000 a year.

THE famous herd of reindeer in the Highlands has been beefed up by
arrivals from France.
It is the first time reindeer have been brought in to Scotland since
the herd on the Cairngorms was established in 1952.
They were gifted to Cairngorm Reindeer Centre by French herdsman
Pierre Marc, who could no longer look after them. The 38 reindeer were
transported to Scotland last week in two massive articulated lorries.
''We got a letter from him out of the blue saying he could not keep
the animals any more, that he had heard of us, and did we want 38
reindeer,'' said Mrs Elizabeth Smith, who tends the Cairngorms herd with
her husband Alan.
''You do not look a gift reindeer in the mouth so we said yes,'' she
added. Their surprise was all the greater because ''we had never even
heard of him''.
The herd run by Mr Marc, at Les Rousses in the Jura Mountains, was the
only other one in Europe outside the animal's Arctic homeland.
At first kept in quarantine before leaving France, the Smiths now have
them isolated at their farm on the Crown Estate Commission's Glenlivet
Estates in Morayshire.
Mrs Smith said she plans to mate the French deer with the existing
Cairngorms herd as soon as they are ready.
''It is all very exciting. They are tremendous stock and I am certain
they will improve the bloodlines. We will get a great genetic
diversity,'' she said.
She and her husband were surprised to get the letter from Mr Marc
offering them the reindeer free. In it, he explained that the herd was
no longer profitable because the French Government had banned the use of
snow-scooters to draw sledges full of tourists to mountain resorts.
''We want to avoid zoological parks and to select only mountain
reserves where the climate suits for reindeer,'' he wrote. ''I propose
to give them to your company gratis because we know that our reindeer
would have a free and natural life in your area.''
Mrs Smith said there was talk of locals mounting a demonstration to
prevent the reindeer being taken away but the only protesters were two
tearful, little girls holding placards saying: ''Leave the Reindeer''.
After they had been on the hills for only a day, Mrs Smith said she
could recognise many of the French deer.
They are being named after French place-names like Dijon, Lyon,
Toulon, and Champagne, and will join the more established Cairngorm
reindeer such as Mull, Skye, Emperor, and Trout.
The Highland reindeer, some of which starred in Santa Claus -- The
Movie, are a tourist attraction for visitors to the Cairngorms.
At Christmas, they are taken on a nationwide tour pulling Santa's
sleigh through shopping centres the length and breadth of Britain.
The Smiths now hope to have a secondary herd at Glenlivet.

<HEADLINE>Lilley to set limits on funeral benefits</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978501891</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MEASURES to curb the spiralling cost to the State of funerals for the
relatives of people on benefits are to be announced this week by Social
Security Secretary Mr Peter Lilley.
A cap of #500 will be put on the fees of funeral directors, although
other burial costs will be met in full, Westminster sources said.
However, Labour attacked the new charges as ''mean-minded'' and warned
it could lead to funerals ''stripped of dignity''.
Mr Lilley's decision follows a large increase in the costs of paying
for funerals from the Government's social fund. The number of people
claiming help almost doubled from 40,000 in 1988/89 to 72,000 in
1993/94. Funeral costs more than trebled over the same period, from #18m
to #63m.
Mr Lilley believes some funeral directors are milking the system.
Under the new proposals, the Government grant covering funeral
directors' fees will be limited to #500.
Costs for cremation, burial plots, death certificates, ministers, an
organist, and flowers will be met in full.
In addition, payments will be available for special religious
requirements, embalming, and transport.
People on benefits such as income support, disability working
allowance, and housing benefit are covered for payment of funerals out
of the social fund cover. It is different from the pauper's funeral,
paid for by the local authority where no relatives of the deceased can
be found.
Mr Lilley has embarked on a major programme to tighten his
department's belt to control its mushrooming budget.
The cuts are expected to save the Department of Social Security around
#12m a year, cutting average payments for a funeral from #920 to #700.
Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar warned: ''The new cap on
funeral directors' fees looks mean-minded and falls well below previous
charges.''
He said it followed a previous Government proposal of a maximum charge
of #875 for a whole funeral.
''It may be that, having been forced to retreat on the overall charge
of #875, Ministers are trying to achieve the same end by stealth.
''Labour will want to look at the small print. But if, as I fear, the
outcome is a funeral stripped of dignity or grieving families
desperately trying to add to an inadequate grant, it will be strongly
resisted,'' he said.

A WOMAN in Irvine who is being pursued for a poll tax debt, which
Lothian Regional Council has admitted she does not owe, has been
threatened with a warrant sale by sheriff officers.
Her MP, Mr Brian Donohoe (Lab -- Cunninghame North), has called for an
immediate inquiry into the circumstances and compensation for the
inconvenience and worry she and her family have suffered.
Mrs Anne Raeside, 26, of Lugar Avenue, Irvine, has received a series
of letters from Lothian Regional Council and sheriff officers acting on
the region's behalf over unpaid community charges of #174.06.
As disclosed in The Herald last week, Mrs Raeside and Mr Donohoe have
both had assurances from the region that it admits she does not owe a
penny and that her liability has been cancelled.
Despite these assurances, and letters of apology from Lothian region,
further threats arrived at the weekend from the Edinburgh company of
sheriff officers acting for the council.
Mrs Raeside lived for a year in Edinburgh, while studying occupational
therapy at Queen Margaret College, returning to Irvine in the summer of
1990. The outstanding claim is for 1991, when Mrs Raeside was paying
community charge in Strathclyde.
She said: ''To make matters worse, the letters have been arriving at
my father's address and he is undergoing psychiatric treatment. He is
worried sick and these letters are making his condition worse.
''I just cannot understand why they keep getting it so wrong. Does the
left hand not know what the right hand is doing in that place?
''This whole business is upsetting me and my parents who live apart.
My father is not well at all and this is the last thing any of us
needs.''
The latest letter is a notice of arrestment or poinding, which can
lead to wages being stopped or goods sold to cover a debt. In this case,
the address involved would be that of Mrs Raeside's father, Mr John
Redmond.
Mrs Raeside is seeking legal advice and may pursue a compensation
claim, a move which is backed by Mr Donohoe.
He said: ''The insensitivity and ineptitude of the people behind this
series of errors is quite breathtaking. I will be writing to the local
authority Ombudsman about this matter, and as soon as the doors of the
region open again after the holiday I will be demanding an inquiry at
the very highest level.
''I cannot believe this is continuing to happen after a series of
assurances dating back to last summer and a grovelling letter of
apology.''
Last week Lothian region blamed a breakdown in communications between
two departments and computer problems for the series of errors. This
week there was no-one available for comment.

HIS name was Jeffrey Miller and he was lying on his front, head
twisted awkwardly to one side, a broad slick of blood seeping away from
him towards the sidewalk. Beside him, a young woman had dropped to her
knees, face stretching into a scream, arms flailing in horror.
It was the defining image for a generation galvanised by the bloodshed
of the US involvement in Indo-China -- a student, one of four, cut down
by troops in riot gear during a protest on the Kent State campus on a
bright, cloudless morning in early May.
Those who knew Miller and the others who died say they embodied the
spirit of the age; the willingness of ordinary Americans to become
involved, to display a level of passion for a cause never seen before or
since in the US.
John Filo was a 20-year-old photojournalism student at Kent State when
he took the picture. He had been in the middle of the crowd snapping
shots of protesters facing up to the thick helmeted lines of National
Guard troops.
''I had just taken one shot of a student waving a flag at the guards
and then minutes after, the guardsmen opened fire on the crowd, and as I
turned I saw the body of Jeffrey Miller,'' he said. ''I realised he was
dead. Then the young woman, Mary Veccio, came running up and knelt down
beside him. I was running out of film and wondering whether I should
take the shot or not. Then she let out this scream and I reacted to her,
to her movement and her voice.''
Filo, now middle-aged and working for Newsweek, won a Pulitzer for the
image. ''My generation in college had been having mixed feelings about
the war and finally made up their minds that it was an insane
operation,'' he said. ''At that time in America it was the closest we
came to a real movement where we were actually getting some things done.
I think the people who were there, the people who experienced it,
learned something. The Government seems to need to learn on its own. But
those days are gone.''
In the intervening years, Filo says he has watched anti-government
activism mutate from the widespread Vietnam protests of the late 60s and
early 70s into the random acts of violence by fanatical fringe elements
such as those who blew up the Alfred Murrah federal building in Oklahoma
City.
''I think there's no common cause uniting everyone, affecting a
generation. There does, however, seem to be a swing of the pendulum.
These fringe elements are immensely afraid of the Government because
they think it's going to take away their assault weapons.''
Allison Krause was also among the Kent State dead. She was a
19-year-old freshman who had a shy smile, a distinctive flip hairstyle,
and kept a kitten hidden in her dorm room.
Jill Sell, a sophomore who lived along the corridor from Krause and
joined her in the campus protests, said the dead girl wasn't an activist
but was moved to demonstrate by a deep-seated belief that the Government
was wrong and could be persuaded by public pressure to withdraw from
Indo-China.
''She tended to be on the fringes of the protests. There were many
people at that time who would normally just have been observers who
became doers, people who felt they had to take a stand,'' said Sell, now
a 45-year-old mother. ''It galvanised people who went to college
thinking 'I'm going to get a good education, a good job, be successful'.
Suddenly all of that became secondary. We thought we really have to do
something, we have to show that the war in Vietnam is wrong. I don't
know if we taught the world a lesson but it certainly held up a mirror
and made us all examine what was going on.''
Sell now has a son at Kent State and worries that his generation of
young Americans has lost the sense of social responsibility, the
willingness to take a stand that their parents experienced.
''I suppose there are so many different topics; women's rights,
environmental concerns, gay rights, that type of thing, that it has
probably become diluted, maybe more spread out. Maybe that's where it
should be. I do worry, though, that perhaps the passion is gone, that
they're not looking for something other than their own gain. For the
world we really need to focus on these issues, these concerns.''
Commemorations are held every year on the Kent State campus, but for
the 25th anniversary the university has set aside an entire week to
discuss the implications of what happened, what lessons, if any, have
been learned. Speakers include gun-control activists and Vietnam
veterans.
''It's a milestone for us,'' said Paula Slimak, a university
spokeswoman. ''We feel it's a lesson we taught the world, the lesson
that we need peaceful conflict resolution. We helped coalesce the sense
of the war, to ask more questions about whether we should have gone into
the war. History in the US is starting to show that Kent State and the
students who fell really did play a critical role in having the country
and the elected officials think again about whether or not we should be
there.''
The university planted 58,165 daffodils at the scene of the shootings
to remember each American soldier who died in Vietnam. ''It's just awash
with yellow and it's where the bodies fell and the blood spilled,'' said
Slimak. ''About two-thirds of the campuses in the US were having very,
very strong protests around the country but Kent State had, of course,
become the focal point of the world. We were then, and we still are, a
very conservative mid-western campus, very academic. It was an unlikely
place. But had this not happened, had they not died, we may have had
many more than 58,000 daffodils planted out here today.''
Slimak insists that student activism is still alive and kicking, just
spread more broadly across a variety of issues, but Dr Alastair Durie,
of Glasgow University's history department, thinks young Americans are
constrained by the same economic shifts which are affecting Scottish and
other young people.
''There has been a very distinct change, some it of paralleled over
here. People now are desperate for jobs,'' he said. ''It's a much more
difficult jobs market these days and people have to concentrate to get
anywhere. Political attitudes and campaigning trends have changed
direction too: there are far fewer protests than there used to be.''
Stephanie Arellano, of the US National Students Association in
Washington, says the protests are still there but they are focused -- by
necessity -- on personal issues like funding and career opportunities.
''The average student today is over 25 and has a child. It's difficult
for them to focus on what's happening in Nicaragua when they can't get
money to go to school.''

THE announcement this week of May 25 as polling day in Perth and
Kinross invites comparisons, some of them revealing as well as
nostalgic, with another occasion in which a by-election focused national
attention on that part of Scotland.
Indeed, Kinross and West Perthshire, November 7, 1963, was the most
celebrated of post-war by-elections, although the outcome was never in
doubt. For it was the only one which had a Prime Minister as a
candidate.
In the coming weeks, much of the same rural territory -- though also
now the city of Perth -- will be trodden by a more electronically
equipped media army. It is unlikely to be as memorable a happening,
although it will certainly serve as a guide to how much has changed and
how much has stayed the same since 1963.
An extraordinary sequence of events led to Sir Alec Douglas-Home
offering himself to the electorate of Kinross and West Perthshire -- a
constituency which fitted him like a glove and which he continued to
represent until retiring from the Commons in 1974.
There were few more feudal or solidly Tory corners of the kingdom than
rural Perthshire. For most of the electorate, even during the Tory
meltdown months of 1963, the appearance of a belted earl who was
temporarily obliged to become a commoner for the purpose of being Prime
Minister, was simply too good to be true.
It was a year which had produced a Profumo scandal, a series of spy
dramas and -- plus ca change -- Dr Beeching's plan for the railways.
Harold Macmillan's tired administration went into free-fall in the
opinion polls, and pressure mounted for him to resign. On October 8 he
entered hospital for a prostate operation and handed over the reins of
government to R A Butler.
Two days later the Tory Pary conference was told by Lord Home, the
Foreign Secretary, that Macmillan was standing down. The contest to
succeed him was on and the six contenders, as well as party grandees,
filed into the King Edward VII Hospital for discussions with Macmillan.
On October 18 Macmillan advised the Queen to send for the fourteenth
Earl of Home.
By the early 60s, the idea of a Prime Minister in the Lords was
unacceptable. This was where chance events suddenly came to the aid of
Home. Earlier in 1963 Parliament had passed the Peerage Act which
allowed hereditary peers to renounce their titles. The new Prime
Minister quickly set about doing so.
But how was he to remain in Parliament? With a remarkable sense of
timing, the Tory MP for Kinross and West Perthshire, Gilmour Leburn, had
died in August at the age of 50. The Tory candidate in the by-election
was to be George Younger.
Younger agreed to stand down, was found a seat in Ayr instead, and
never had cause to look back. Sir Alec Douglas-Home, as he now became,
was nominated as Conservative and Unionist candidate, and the shortest
by-election circus in modern political history was under way. Sir Alec
combined the roles of Prime Minister and candidate.
A colourful field lined up against him, including Willy Rushton. It
was the heyday of BBC television's That Was the Week That Was on which
Rushton was more accustomed to playing the Macmillan parts, while Lance
Percival sent up Home.
However, his opening meeting in Killin attracted an audience of 300
who heard Rushton go ''lightly and scathingly through the Prime
Minister's life'' and ''frequently mimicking'' the great man. The
certainty was that Killin had seen nothing like it before.
Sir Alec went on his stately way through the constituency. Opponents
expressed indignation when schoolchildren were given a half-day to cheer
his presence.
The by-election outcome was never in doubt. The Tory share of the vote
dropped to a healthy 58%, the Liberals -- who had not fought the seat
since 1950 -- came second and Willy Rushton received 45 votes.
Asked if he intended to buy a house in the constituency, Sir Alec
replied: ''Good heavens, no. I have too many houses already.'' The
Liberals called for a ban on opinion polls during by-elections,
describing them as ''a dangerous interference in the democratic
process''.
On the same night, the Tories lost Luton, where the Radio Doctor,
Charles Hill, had been unwisely elevated to the peerage. It soon proved
to be a more prophetic guide to the mood of the country than Sir Alec
Douglas-Home's triumph in the glens of Perthshire.

THERE are millions of reasons for celebrating the 50th anniversary of
the end of the most bloody war in human history. In recent days, many of
them stared at us with glazed eyes in emaciated skulls from the pit of
hell in Belsen, the haunting images on film that were considered too
terrible and too dangerous to show to Britons 50 years ago lest it
precipitate public demands for retribution against Germany. The
Americans didn't want that. They needed a new, compliant Western Germany
as an ally against the communist bloc which had arrived on the doorstep
of Europe.
Britain remembered the backlash of the Versailles Treaty of 1919 which
had imposed retribution on Germany and how it had been used by Hitler as
a recruiting sergeant, and complied. Alfred Hitchcock's documentary film
of the concentration camps was not shown.
Fifty years on, we may not want to see it, to be reminded of what
unspeakable things human beings can do to one another, but it stands as
irrefutable evidence that we were right to have fought the Third Reich,
and we are right to rejoice in having destroyed it.
There were millions enough in those hell pits, but if Hitler had not
been stopped -- how many more would have perished in the planned
thousand-year Reich? It would not have stopped at the mentally
defective, the gipsies, the communists or the Jews. The roundup would
have gone on and on, weeding, selecting, and pruning -- rearing a master
race of psychopaths and thugs -- an experiment in altering the course of
human history which it would have taken more than war to reverse.
It would have taken genocide -- and which of us could have advanced an
argument for that, given that this was the evil we were supposed to be
fighting? We have many things to be grateful about on VE-Day, and that
is one of the less obvious ones. We look with the benefit of hindsight
at the history of what did happen rather than what might have happened,
but let us spend a little time contemplating how near we were to defeat.
Take Dunkirk. We turned a retreat into a public relations victory, but
if the Germans had not hung back, the backbone of the British Army would
have been captured and broken early in the war. Then there was the
Battle of Britain -- the triumph of the few. Military historians have
argued that had the Luftwaffe taken out strategic targets in the summer
of 1940 instead of waging their brand of terror bombing they would have
been able to launch Sealion, Hitler's invasion plan for Britain, with
virtual certainty of success.
That would have made us an occupied country. Stiff upper-lipped,
terrified, and reluctant to make a fuss, we would have decided it was
more sensible to co-operate. We would have soon developed our own brand
of quisling or Vichy-style accommodation. There are always plenty of
people who can be bought, seduced or frightened into collaboration with
even the most repulsive occupation force, and the Germans, who respected
Britain, would have shown their most appealing profile.
Let us not forget either that strange and unattractive element in our
society then and now who cling to fascist symbols and attitudes. Today's
BNP skinheads were yesterday's Mosleyites, all strutting and saluting --
ripe for the role of collaborators. Those tempted to take to the hills
with a rifle would soon have been isolated.
Resistance would have met with reprisals, atrocities such as were
perpetrated by the SS in other occupied parts of Europe. And of course
we would have stood alone . . . there was no-one else. No second front
in the East, because Stalin and Hitler had signed the pact of steel
which was to remain in place until 1941.
Across the Atlantic, Roosevelt could barely persuade Congress to lease
us a few battleships, never mind commit the US to fighting a war in
Europe at that time. Isolationism was running high, and even after Pearl
Harbor the American inclination was to fight the Pacific war and leave
Europe to its own devices. (In this regard it should be noted that the
US came into the war officially only after Hitler declared war on it, in
solidarity with Japan, after Pearl Harbor. Had he not been so hot-headed
and instead sought to keep a neutral relationship with the US, history
might have been very different.)
In hindsight, if Britain had been invaded in 1940-41, the US would not
have interfered. Hitler's crusade against communist Russia, when it
came, might even have won him praise in a country that within a decade
was to produce Senator McCarthy.
The picture I have painted is gloomy but it is all too credible. The
fact that it did not happen is surely worthy of reflection, if not
celebration. Let us be glad that Hitler was as mad as he was bad, and
made so many mistakes. Let us be glad that he was so fanatical that he
fought to the death and annihilation of the Reich he created.
A pact with Hitler or his deputies would not have been a truce, it
would have been a Faustian pact with the devil. How would Europe have
fared with a peace negotiated by Hess? How long before the cancer made a
second appearance? In a more recent time, we have seen the mistake of
waging war and creating a false peace in the Gulf War. Saddam Hussein
comes from the same stable of history as Adolf Hitler and because the
allies stopped short of Baghdad, he lives to enjoy his power. Thankfully
we did not stop short of Berlin and make the same mistake. Nazism was a
cancer that had to be destroyed. There were no half measures or it would
have grown again and destroyed the soul of Europe.
For that reason, among many others, I rejoice at what happened in
1945. I am glad that Germany was partitioned then and I am glad that it
is reunited now. The cure was necessary and it appears to have worked
rather well.
To take that view is not to glorify war. Nobody but a madman welcomes
war, especially since the twentieth century saw the extension of
conflict to civilians and the development of weapons of mass
destruction. War is the last option.
To paraphrase the words of the marriage service, it is not to be
entered lightly or inadvisedly. The Second World War was not entered
lightly -- if there be complaint it might be that it could have been
averted if Hitler had been challenged in 1936 when he took the Rhineland
with a battalion, a lot of bravado, and nothing to back it up. Instead,
the policy of appeasement allowed him the time he needed.
The end of any war is a cause for relief, but the end of war in which
the forces of liberty vanquish the forces of oppression is a reason for
rejoicing. The victory of 1945 was also the milestone of profound change
in our own society. Just as 1918 speeded up irreversible changes in
British society, 1945 confirmed them. The desperate need to throw off
the old class-ridden structure and system of patronage resulted in the
Labour landslide at the General Election which followed the war.
It gave a much needed impetus to social change which alas was
squandered in the fifties by reactionary trade unions, complemented by
disastrous periods of Tory complacency under a burnt-out Churchill and
Eden.
To recognise that a corner was turned in 1945, we only have to look at
the list of rights and freedoms enjoyed by ordinary people today which
were denied to their predecessors. One personal example -- my father at
first turned down a commission in the Royal Navy during the war despite
many pre-war years in the RNVR as a petty officer because he would have
been unable to afford the hefty mess bills in the wardroom which were
not a problem to the officer with ''private means''.
Later in the war, when he was a sub-lieutenant, he received a letter
from a peer of the realm who was friendly with his parents, tenants on
his estate. He was subjected to a long interrogation by security people
who took a great deal of convincing that there was not something deeply
suspicious about a village laddie being friendly with a lord.
Let us be thankful that we no longer have such a social structure. As
a member of the ''baby-boom'' generation, I know only too well the
freedoms and advantages which I have enjoyed which were denied to my
parents' generation, regardless of how willing or talented they might
have been. Those privileges came courtesy of victory in Europe.
One final personal note. I am married to a Russian girl born in 1957.
Her family will celebrate VE-Day next week (on the 9th because Moscow
was already at 2am by the time the ceasfire sounded at midnight on the
8th in Berlin). Yet we fail to acknowledge the crucial part the Eastern
Front played in the defeat of Hitler. The Russian people suffered far
more than we did at the hands of the Nazis. Perhaps because of the evil
shadow of Stalin, we tend to downplay their part in the cleansing of
Europe. Their total of war dead vastly exceeds ours. Their country was
occupied and raped as ours was not. They did not enjoy the freedom they
deserved until recently, and the least we can do is include them in the
party. The Russians certainly know how to enjoy a party.
As a nation, the Scots are easily distracted from enjoying themselves.
we seem to prefer a good moan, the role of victim rather than victor. We
are summed up by the story of the minister looking at pall-bearers who
had just lowered a coffin into the cold January soil and asked, ''Do you
tak a dram, gentleman?'' The vigorous nods were repaid with the words
''Then let that yin doon there be a lesson tae ye!'' Does that not sum
up much of our attitude to past travails? We have buried the corpse of
Hitler and we should be celebrating, not castigating those who do.
In the church of which I am minister (Kinning Park Kirk) we held a
special service yesterday to celebrate Victory in Europe. The Rev
Professor Murdo Ewen Macdonald, paratrooper and PoW, preached, and Jimmy
Logan opened a street party right after church.
No doubt there will be those who think this a desecration of the
Sabbath. To them I would like to quote the Aberdonian motto, ''They will
say. What do they say? Let them say.'' Because if it hadn't been for
Victory in Europe, they probably wouldn't enjoy the freedom to say it.

COMMENTS made by the Conservative provost of Perth and Kinross were
used yesterday by the Scottish National Party as a stick to beat the
Conservative candidate as campaigning continued for the forthcoming
by-election caused by the death of Sir Nicholas Fairbairn.
The SNP claimed a leaflet distributed in the area at the weekend on
behalf of Mr John Godfrey was a clear attempt to make party political
capital out of the VE Day celebrations.
Extracts from the leaflet, according to the SNP, read: ''Monday is VE
Day. Britain will commemorate the victory over nationalism . . . Fifty
years on, we should take this opportunity to reflect on the fact that
Scotland achieves far more working in partnership with the rest of the
United Kingdom.''
However, SNP chief executive Michael Russell claimed a letter he
received from local Tory provost Mrs Jean McCormack, on the same day the
leaflet was being distributed, said she felt ''very strongly'' that the
celebration of victory in Europe 50 years ago should not be used for any
political advantage or be in any way associated with the forthcoming
by-election.
Mr Russell said: ''There is massive opposition -- including from the
Tory provost of Perth and Kinross -- to the Tories' disgraceful efforts
to appropriate VE Day for party political purposes.''
He argued that everyone except the Conservatives wanted to approach
the celebrations in a spirit of unity. ''That is how it should be,'' Mr
Russell said. ''But the Tories are spoiling this historic occasion for
everyone with their shameless politicking.''
Calling for the leaflet to be withdrawn, he added: ''It seems that
nothing is sacred to the Tories any more -- nothing is above their low
party politics.''
The clash of opinions over the monarchy in the by-election campaign
continued with a strong personal attack by Mr Bill Walker, Conservative
MP for North Tayside, on SNP candidate Roseanna Cunningham.
On Friday, the Tories described Ms Cunningham as a ''closet
republican''. She later said the monarchy was the ''pinnacle of the
class system''.
Mr Walker said yesterday he was ''appalled'' that the SNP candidate
saw fit to ''belittle our monarchy at this poignant time.
''We are not going to take lectures from someone whose formative
political years were not even spent in this country,'' the MP said,
referring to Ms Cunningham's claim that her republican views originated
from her time in Australia.
Mr Walker, pointing out that the monarchy existed long before
Australia was even discovered, argued that it represented ''the
cornerstone of our unwritten constitution and the foundation of our
parliamentary democracy.
''How dare she peddle her Australian republican sentiments, which even
she admits are not compatible with this deeply loyal constituency.''
The Tory MP's comments were described as ''outrageous'' by SNP deputy
leader Dr Allan Macartney, who said: ''According to Mr Walker, people
who were not brought up in this country have no right to express views
on its future.
''These are nasty, narrow-minded sentiments -- from an increasingly
nasty, narrow-minded party.''
Meanwhile, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson, speaking at the
adoption meeting of Labour candidate George Alexander in Perth and
Kinross, said last week's local election results in England and Wales
had been an ''unmitigated disaster'' for the Tories.
''They are more than just a vote of no confidence in the Tories,'' he
said. ''They are a sign that people are turning to new Labour. All over
the country, people want to hear more about Labour. They will have that
chance in Perth and Kinross.''
Mr Robertson claimed the Tories were ''hopelessly out of touch with
the Scottish people''. While Labour already had detailed plans for a
Scottish parliament the Tories only policy on the constitution, he said,
was ''to do nothing''.
He said Labour's national team would publish six policy papers, on the
economy, health, crime, education, the information superhighway, and on
regional government, in the next three months. In Scotland, new Labour
would freshen up policies on housing, education, and health.

A SCOTTISH eagle landed in England yesterday in the penultimate act of
a drama which began in the sixteenth century when one of Scotland's
national treasures was taken as war booty from Holyrood Abbey.
The treasure, an ornate church lectern known as the Holyrood Bird, has
been the subject of a 450-year-old ownership dispute since it was
removed to England in 1544.
Thought to be one of only two cast in Italy in 1498, it was given to
the Bishop of Dunkeld by a fifteenth-century Pope. However, it was taken
from Holyrood Abbey by Henry VIII's invading troops and handed over to
St Stephen's Church in St Albans, Hertfordshire, by Sir Richard Lee, one
of the commanders of the Earl of Hertford's troops who carried out the
king's orders to destroy and loot the Scottish abbeys in 1544 during the
''rough wooing''.
The brass lectern, which features a majestic eagle with its wings
outstretched to support a Bible, remained in English hands until 1984,
when a group of self-styled ''Scottish patriots'' raided the church and
brought it back to Scotland.
For fear of legal repercussions, it has lain hidden in a west Highland
grave for the past 11 years.
Yesterday, a replica lectern was handed over to the Rev John Pragnell,
the vicar at St Stephen's Church, by Mr David Maxwell, convener of the
Church of Scotland's committee on artistic matters.
Both sides hope the handing over of the 150-year-old replica, which
comes from St Margaret's Barnhill Church, Dundee, will allow the real
eagle to surface.
Mr Maxwell said: ''St Stephen's is happy to have the replica and is
giving up the rights to the original, so there is nothing to stop the
people who took it handing it back.''

THE parents of one in three Scottish children are living on the
breadline, according to a survey by Glasgow Caledonian University
researchers.
The survey reveals that the growth of real poverty among Scottish
families is linked to an alarming increase in the number of people in
low-paid jobs.
Commenting on the findings, Labour's Scottish economic spokesman, Mr
John McFall, warned that Scotland was in danger of becoming Europe's
low-pay capital.
''With the increasing trend towards part-time work, the incidence of
poverty in work is set to continue and increase,'' he said. ''People in
rural areas are particularly disadvantaged, with 65% of heads of
households on incomes below the Scottish Low Pay Unit threshold.''
In Scotland, 34% of children are living in households where their
parents are either in receipt of Family Credit or Income Support in
1993, according to the survey.
Almost half of Scotland's workforce, 43%, are low paid, the study
found. More than 300,000 Scottish women, in part-time jobs, are in the
low-paid category, compared with 60,000 men.
* Nearly half of all Scotland's artists earn less than #5000 a year
from their artistic work, according to a survey of artists' incomes
commissioned by the Scottish Arts Council.
Despite having high qualifications, the average earnings of the
artists surveyed was just #8700 per annum, compared to Scotland's
average non-manual earnings of #18,200.
Nearly one-third of artists had been registered as unemployed during
the previous three months, said an SAC spokesman.

THE Government's plans to privatise the nuclear power industry next
year are in trouble already, Labour trade and industry spokesman Mr
Brian Wilson said yesterday.
The Cabinet decided last week that the public-sector company Scottish
Nuclear, and its larger English counterpart, Nuclear Electric, should be
merged for a sell-off next year. Details will not be announced
officially until a White Paper on the future of the nuclear power
industry is published tomorrow.
However, Mr Wilson said yesterday that the complex process of
re-licensing the eight nuclear sites for new ownership would make it
impossible for the Government to sell the companies before the next
General Election.
He was commenting on a Sunday newspaper report that the Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate and HM Inspectorate of Pollution were setting
aside 12 to 14 months for the re-licensing process.
Mr Wilson said the report confirmed information he had received
through his own sources.
He said: ''It is extremely important that they should have laid down
these timescale parameters at this early stage. If these are adhered to,
and probably expanded upon, then it will not be possible for the Tories
to push through privatisation before a General Election.
''In their desperation to fund tax cuts, the Tories are greatly
underestimating the complexities of nuclear privatisation. Once you get
into the business of transferring consents and licensing new operators,
it is very difficult to set a timetable.
''There will certainly have to be a full public consultation and I
have no doubt that many interested parties will want to participate.
Labour will certainly insist that the process is not truncated or
interfered in for the convenience of the Tory Party and its political
agenda.''
There would be particularly complex issues relating to split-site
ownership -- such as at Hunterston in his own Cunninghame North
constituency -- where the Government wanted to retain the old Magnox
stations in the public sector while selling off the more modern
stations.
''Splitting ownership and responsibilities within a 'nuclear island'
throws up all sorts of new and complex concerns which certainly cannot
be addressed in haste to suit the whims of Tory Ministers. Labour and
all responsible organisations will be encouraging the widest possible
response to the consultation process,'' said Mr Wilson.
A spokesman for the pollution inspectorate said last night that he was
not aware of any particular period of time being set aside. ''How long
it would take is anybody's guess. But it would have to go through the
full process of re-authorisation and there would be public
consultation.''
The Herald was unable to contact the nuclear inspectorate for comment.
Meanwhile, workers fighting the privatisation and merger of Scottish
Nuclear will take their battle to the Scottish Tories' annual
conference, which begins in Glasgow on Wednesday.
The Scottish Nuclear Workers' Campaign will be lobbying delegates for
support in its fight to maintain the company as a separate entity under
public ownership.
Campaign spokesperson Ms Angela Boslam said yesterday: ''We believe
the Government's decision will have angered many Conservative members
and voters. It is the kind of decision that has lost them so much
support in Scotland, and now more than 2000 local council seats in
England and Wales.
''This privatisation has still to go through Parliament and we will be
asking Scottish Tory delegates to help us stop it. The Government had to
do a U-turn over the Post Office privatisation and we are campaigning
for the same result.''
Scottish Nuclear was one of the biggest commercial success stories in
recent years, she said. As a public company, it had created the most
productive power plants in the world and had turned a #33m loss into a
#150m profit while cutting costs from 3.2p to 2.2p per unit.
''We fear that jobs will be lost unnecessarily. A privatised and
merged company would seek to reduce costs and the duplication of
functions across the two companies. As everyone knows, they would do
this by cutting jobs in Scotland and in England.''
Ms Boslam was unimpressed by the Government's plan to locate the
headquarters of the merged operations' holding company in Scotland. ''We
know that the promise of a UK headquarters in Edinburgh for a company
dominated from England is merely a sop to keep the 'Jocks' quiet.''

THE Princess of Wales ended her alleged affair with Mr James Hewitt, a
former Army officer, after she was told of tape recordings of intimate
discussions between them, it was claimed yesterday.
Mr Hewitt, 27, a former Life Guards officer, said that he was also
effectively blackmailed into putting a stop to the liaison.
Senior officers told him about the existence of the tapes before the
Princess separated from the Prince of Wales in December 1992.
''They said there were tape recordings of our intimate conversations
and I was left in no doubt they were pretty explicit,'' he told The
Sunday Times.
He was also told that the tapes would be made public if the
relationship was not ended, which would be damaging for the Monarchy.
''It would also show Diana and myself in the worst possible light.
Effectively it was blackmail,'' he added.
It was the Princess who, having also been informed about the
recordings, bowed to pressure to end their friendship, he said.
Details of the alleged five-year affair between the Princess and Mr
Hewitt were made last year in the book Princess in Love, written by Anna
Pasternak.
Mr Hewitt admitted to having suffered depression since the book was
published, because of his subsequent treatment at the hands of the
media.
Just over a year ago, he was forced to leave the Army, after failing
exams for promotion to the rank of major.
He said: ''I felt pretty low, as low as I've ever been. I felt I'd
been used and then chucked on the scrap-heap . . .
''There was no support from her. I was alone and unable even to talk
things over with her, even though I had shown her so much care and
understanding when she needed it.''
Mr Hewitt added that he believed Buckingham Palace knew about his
relationship with the Princess, which began in 1986, from an early date.
He had expected the relationship to ''last a lifetime''.
The claim of tape recordings of intimate conversations was the latest
twist in a confusing saga of alleged royal telephone tapping.
Allegations first surfaced in 1992 with the so-called ''Squidgy''
tapes, of what was said to be telephone conversations between Diana and
Mr James Gilbey, a former used car salesman.
However, the biggest furore erupted two years ago with publication of
the ''Camillagate'' tape, claimed to be a recording of a telephone
conversation between the Prince of Wales and his close friend Camilla
Parker Bowles.
The source of the tapes has been a constant source of speculation with
the finger regularly pointed at the Security Service MI5 and the
Government eavesdropping complex GCHQ. However, MI5 has officially
denied any involvement in the alleged telephone tapping.

DELIGHTED war veterans last night thanked television challenge star
Anneka Rice for helping them with a special VE Day project.
Bathgate Royal British Legion president Mr Charles Paterson revealed:
''We don't know whose idea this was -- but it is brilliant.''
Mr Paterson, 67, told how an anonymous benefactor contacted the BBC
Challenge Anneka programme and asked it to move Bathgate's war memorial
to a more convenient spot.
He said: ''It was about half a mile up a hill and then there were 48
steps up to it. That was all right in 1945. But many of our members are
71 or 72 now.
''We had been planning this move to the town centre for years, but
never had the money. It was such a well-kept secret that I didn't know
Anneka was coming until last Tuesday.
''And we don't even know who to thank for coming up with the idea.''
Anneka was on site yesterday to watch dozens of volunteers start to
dismantle the war memorial for its journey down the hill.
She has until teatime tonight to complete the job in time for a
special dedication ceremony and VE Day parade.
Then her entire crew has been invited to a VE Day street party being
planned by the Bathgate legion.
Mr Paterson said: ''I've had a look at how they are getting on and
they are doing a brilliant job.''
A spokesman for the Challenge Anneka programme said: ''Getting this
done in time for the VE Day commemoration was the perfect challenge.
''We wanted to do something to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of
the war.''
While in West Lothian this weekend, the Challenge Anneka team also
organised the repainting of the Acredales Old Folks Centre in Bathgate
and they installed a ramp at the Armadale home of wheelchair-bound
Jennifer Russell.
The special VE Day challenge will be shown on BBC television in the
autumn.

<HEADLINE>Earl claims he made up story to root out 'traitor'</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Earl Spencer, brother of the Princess of Wales, has denied a
newspaper report that he was quitting Britain for America -- and claimed
he made the story up to root out an informant friend.
Lord Spencer said the ruse had uncovered a ''traitor'' who had been
supplying stories to the News of the World.
The paper's front page first edition story said the 30-year-old earl
was leaving his wife Victoria, who is receiving treatment for alcoholism
and eating disorders, and moving to the US to live with their four
children.
It claimed he had accepted a television contract to work there.
Yesterday, Lord Spencer said the story was ''totally untrue''. He
added: ''Over the past few weeks, it has become apparent to my wife and
I that we have a friend who has been informing the News of the World.
''To find out who this was, we decided to release false information to
the main suspect.
''My wife and I are both sorry that he has sought to gain from the
News of the World rather than to respect his friendship with my wife and
also that he was able, with his boyfriend, to take hospitality
repeatedly over the past few years and has repaid us in this shabby
way.''
Lord Spencer said he had written to the friend to tell him of the
''planned'' move because he feared his telephone was being tapped.
His wife had been informed and was relieved to know who the mole was.
''I am delighted we have found out who it was but I am saddened for my
wife that one of her closest friends has turned out to be a traitor. I
don't take any pleasure in trying to catch out people like this,'' said
Lord Spencer.
The News of the World's editor yesterday accused Lord Spencer of
involving his family in deceit and said he was ''baffled'' at the earl
allowing an invented story to appear.
Mr Piers Morgan said in a statement: ''I am extremely surprised that
Lord Spencer should involve his ailing wife and his children in such an
elaborate attempt to deceive a newspaper.
''What he has done amounts to a simple case of entrapment.
''Rather ironically he has deployed the very subterfuge for which he
so often accuses the tabloid press.
''He has also quite deliberately attracted a whole new avalanche of
publicity at a time when he himself has repeatedly pleaded for privacy
on behalf of Lady Victoria.
''At 2.45pm on Saturday, the News of the World faxed an outline of its
story to Lord Spencer at Althorp House, after first establishing with a
member of staff that he would be able to see it swiftly.
''The fact that he deliberately allowed a totally invented story to
appear in Britain's biggest selling paper is quite baffling.''

GRACE Clark, one of Scotland's legends in comedy, has died in a
nursing home at Ayr, aged 90.
Born in Yoker, she was a concert pianist who emerged as a bill-topping
comedienne, partnering her late husband, Colin Murray, in the music hall
and variety theatre double act of Clark and Murray at theatres in
Scotland, Belfast, and the Isle of Man.
Grace met Colin when both were solo acts -- she a pianist, he a singer
-- in a summer season at Dunbar in 1926.
Their act switched from music to laughter when Grace realised she
could win laughs playing the tough, tyrant wife in cross-talk with a
long-suffering husband.
The twosome were awarded the British Empire Medal in 1982 and had
appeared at several Royal performances in Glasgow.
Comedian and actor Jimmy Logan said yesterday: ''Grace and Colin wrote
a wonderful page in the history of Scottish theatre. They were the best
of 100% family entertainment.
''On stage, audiences saw Grace putting Colin in his place as a
martyred husband. In real life they lived for each other, and Grace was
lost after Colin died.''
Grace's mother did not believe in people who were not married
travelling around in showbusiness together, claiming it ''wasn't
decent'', but she relented to the extent of allowing the young couple to
do their act, then travel after the show to their respective homes. She
later allowed them to work outside Glasgow -- but only if they had a
chaperone.
Their domestic comedy was so popular with audiences in the 1950s that
they were labelled ''Mr and Mrs Glasgow''.
A near classic sketch was their Bus Stop, with Colin being harangued
by an over-talkative Grace for his behaviour at a social visit. ''Aye,
yer mither!'' she would exclaim, launching into a general dissection of
his character.
In 50 years together on stage, Clark and Murray worked alongside many
of the greats in music hall, among them Sir Harry Lauder, Will Fyffe,
Tommy Lorne, and Harry Gordon.
Grace Clark lived in retirement at Doonfoot, near Ayr. Like so many
entertainers, she did not take easily to leaving the bright lights. Like
so many others in her profession, she was extremely sensitive about
revealing her age.
Once, after a certain figure had been published, she wrote a friendly
letter to The Herald, pointing out that theatrical people should keep to
the old adage: ''There are two things a performer should never reveal --
ages and wages.''

MOUNTAIN rescue teams were last night battling to reach two climbers
who had been trapped for hours on a crag in the Cuillins on Skye.
The men, members of Inverness Mountaineering Club, were located after
rescuers heard them sending out distress blasts on their whistles.
Members of Skye Mountain Rescue Team were called out when the pair
were reported overdue yesterday afternoon. They had set off on Saturday
morning from the Loch Coruisk area, intending to climb the popular
horseshoe route on the Cuillins Ridge.
It is believed they had been abseiling down the crag when their ropes
jammed, leaving them stranded, possibly overnight on Saturday.
Poor visibility and low cloud meant a Sea King helicopter from RAF
Lossiemouth was unable to reach the scene but rescuers were said to be
making their way towards the climbers.
Because of the conditions, the two climbers might not be freed until
first light today, when the helicopter may be able to assist in the
efforts to free them. Police in Inverness declined to name the men.
Earlier yesterday, a student underwent surgery in hospital after he
was seriously injured in a 30ft fall while climbing in the Cuillins.
Mr Emrys Jones, 25, from Sandyford, Newcastle, broke both legs and his
left arm in the fall on the 3089ft Sgurr Dubh Mhor at around 4.30pm on
Saturday. He was taken down on a stretcher by Skye Mountain Rescue Team
and flown by RAF Sea King helicopter to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness.

Moscow
PRIME Ministers in trouble at home have in the past retreated to
Moscow and Mr John Major is proving no exception.
His part in Britain's celebrations of VE Day over, he and the rest of
the great and the good set off this morning for Russia.
On the way to Moscow, Mr Major is attending ceremonies in Paris and
Berlin, the latter part of the reconciliation with Germany, which the
50th anniversary is being used to mark.
The Russians celebrate VE Day tomorrow and a massive parade will be
held in Red Square, just like they used to be in communist times. There
will also be a ceremony at Poklonnaya Gora, where a special war memorial
has been built.
The site is known as Bow Hill and is where Napoleon halted before
demanding the keys of the city. It gets its name from the tradition that
travellers arriving here from the West bowed in the direction of the
city before entering.
A large obelisk has been erected and a special museum dealing with
what the Russians call ''the great patriotic war'' has been built.
Tomorrow's celebrations commemorate a war in which around 20 million
people from Soviet countries died and it is being used by President
Yeltsin as a major morale-boosting exercise.
It recalls Russia's glorious days in battle. Red Square has been hung
with banners, one on the Historical Museum, at the opposite end from St
Basil's Cathedral, shows a Russian soldier and a GI embracing beneath
the flags of the allies. The slogan states how they joined forces to
fight fascism.
The facade of Gum, the famous department store opposite the Kremlin,
has a series of banners with one showing Mother Russia dressed in
scarlet, another showing a Russian soldier covered in medals, and in the
middle a huge Red Star.
All over the city, there are posters praising the veterans of the war
and slogans which read: ''We will never forget -- We forget nothing.''
Behind the museum near the old Prospekt Marx, shrouded in white cloth,
a huge equestrian statue of Marshal Zhukov is waiting to be unveiled.
Fascism is being trampled beneath the horse's hooves.
The great Soviet hero of the war, the marshal rode into Red Square 50
years ago on a white horse to a rapturous welcome. However, a jealous
Stalin soon sent him into exile and he became a forgotten man.
Since Stalin, Russia's war leader, is not somebody anybody wants to
remember today, the marshal, a truly great soldier, has been
rehabilitated.
Mr Major, as well as watching the pageantry in Red Square which will
be both military and civilian, will lay a wreath at the tomb of the
Unknown Soldier in the Androvsky Gardens below the Kremlin wall.
Then he will join the other world leaders attending these celebrations
at the inauguration of the Poklonnaya Gora memorial and in the evening
he will unveil a plaque to the British war-time mission at Vakhtangova
and before joining his peers at a state banquet in the Kremlin.
Around 50 heads of state and government are expected, including
President Clinton, who will stay on for a summit meeting on Wednesday
with President Yeltsin. United States-Russian relations are cool at
present and they have a full agenda with the Russian nuclear deal with
Iran at the head.
The other leaders include President Mitterrand, the Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien, Chancellor Kohl, the Italian President Luigi
Scalfaro, and the Chinese leader Chairman Tian Xe Min.
Last night, schoolchildren were rehearsing a pageant in Red Square to
the strains of a heavily amplified youth orchestra. They danced round a
maypole and sang rousing patriotic choruses.
Mr Major will be missing Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons
tomorrow to attend the ceremonies and will return to Britain on
Wednesday. President Clinton, after his talks with Mr Yeltsin, is to
spend two days visiting the Ukraine.

A FAMILY of five was rescued from the Firth of Forth by lifeboat last
night after their dinghy capsized near North Queensferry.
The alarm was raised by diners at Queensferry Lodge Hotel, who watched
as the three little girls and their parents clung to the upturned
dinghy, only yards from the Forth Road Bridge, as waves crashed around
them.
The hotel's assistant manager, Mr Douglas Fleming, said guests had
alerted staff, who called police.
Police notified the Forth coastguard at Crail, which organised the
launch of the South Queensferry lifeboat. The lifeboat was backed up by
coastguard crews from Fisherrow, near Musselburgh, and Kinghorn.
Tugs working in the area and a Ministry of Defence police launch also
provided back-up after an urgent appeal for assistance from the
coastguard.
A helicopter from RAF Prestwick was scrambled but turned back when the
family, who have not been named, were taken on to a boat.
Two ambulances were on standby at Hawes Pier, South Queensferry, to
take the family to St John's Hospital at Livingston, West Lothian. They
were brought ashore just after 7pm.
The family, who were all wearing lifejackets, were treated for
hypothermia and their condition was last night described as stable. It
was thought they had been in the chilly waters of the Forth for nearly
an hour after their dinghy capsized.
A coastguard spokesman said: ''The family were unfortunate in that
they were in the water for so long before they were spotted. If they had
been there for much longer, the children could have been in a very bad
way.''
He said pleasure-craft users should always check on weather conditions
with the coastguard and be properly equipped with lifejackets.
A spokeswoman for Hawes Inn Hotel at South Queensferry said: ''We saw
the boat bringing them back. The three kids, who were all wrapped up,
were carried in to two ambulances. They all seemed to be alright.
''The sea had been quite choppy all day. I'm surprised anyone had been
out in a boat.''
The dinghy was later returned to the Port Edgar marina at South
Queensferry by the MoD launch.

A COUNCILLOR last night criticised the ''mindless vandals'' who set
fire to a 200-year-old house in East Kilbride which is being converted
into a heritage centre for the town.
Firefighters took almost three hours yesterday to control a blaze at
Hunter House, in Maxwellton Road, Calderwood.
The A-listed property, built in the eighteenth century, is being
developed at a cost of #600,000, in a project intended to honour the
brothers William and John Hunter.
They were born in the house and are regarded as among East Kilbride's
most famous sons, having achieved international distinction in the
fields of science and medicine. The brothers are also commemorated in
Glasgow University's Hunterian Museum.
Strathclyde Police last night confirmed that the fire had been started
deliberately and said detectives had begun an inquiry.
Councillor Harry Winslow, depute leader of East Kilbride District
Council, said: ''It is very regrettable that we are trying to produce
something positive for the town and have to suffer mindless vandalism.''
Renovation work on the building began several months ago and an
initial inspection last night revealed extensive damage to the new roof
timbers.
However, Mr Winslow said he believed there had been no structural
damage to the property and he was confident that work on the project
would be set back by only a few weeks.
The council's contractors have now agreed to mount a permanent night
patrol at the site, he added.
The house, which had lain empty for many years, was bought by the
council from East Kilbride Development Corporation. The council has
agreed to spend #573,000 on the project, while the corporation is
contributing a further #25,000.
When completed, by early next year, the centre will boast hands-on
technology relating to the work of the Hunters and the development of
the town over the last two centuries.

THERE was no chance old soldier David Greer would forget his wedding
anniversary today. He has never needed much reminding, since he married
his wife Ann on VE Day.
Today, as the nation remembers, David and Ann Greer, aged 73 and 71,
from Maddiston, Falkirk, will enjoy their own very special golden
celebration.
Mr Greer joked yesterday: ''If my wedding anniversary hadn't been such
a significant date I probably would have missed a few. Our wedding day
was special any way -- but the amazing news that the war in Europe was
over added a lot.''
The Greers became sweethearts when they met at a dance in the local
British legion hall in 1941. Mr Greer admitted: ''I went to the dance
with another girl -- but when I met Ann it was love at first sight.''
Mrs Greer explained that she refused to have an early wedding: ''He
was going abroad. I told him I didn't want to be a widow just yet.'' But
she had to wait a lot longer than she planned.
For David Greer -- one of the famous Desert Rats in North Africa --
was captured by Rommel's Afrika Korps in 1943 and became a PoW for the
rest of the war.
Mrs Greer said: ''I didn't expect to have to wait to get married as
long as I did, but it was worth it in the end.''
The couple had another wait on their wedding day. For the ceremony was
delayed for two hours so that everyone could listen to Churchill's
historic radio broadcast telling the nation that the war in Europe was
over.
Mr Greer said: ''We didn't know it was going to be VE Day when we
fixed our wedding day. There was a total news blackout until the
announcement.''
He does not believe it will be possible to recreate that magic day
back in 1945. But 150 guests -- including three children and six
grandchildren -- will be doing their best.

THE Pope appealed to mankind never to forget the lessons of the Second
World War. Addressing tens of thousands in St Peter's Square, he said he
had written a letter addressed ''to all men of goodwill'' to mark the
50th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe. The Pope, who lived
through the Nazi occupation of his native Poland, said the letter would
underscore that a just society could not be based on violence and
weapons. ''War, never again,'' he said, repeating a phrase made famous
by Pope Paul VI in an address to the United Nations in 1964.

JACQUES CHIRAC, of the Gaullist RPR party, was last night elected
President of the French Republic after polling 52.2% of votes in the
second round poll of the presidential election. His opponent, socialist
party candidate Lionel Jospin, polled 47.8%, after a close-run campaign
which had left many socialists hopeful that their man might win.
An announcement of the results at 7pm last night sparked scenes of
wild enthusiasm at Mr Chirac's election headquarters in Paris, which was
decked out with tricolour flags and surrounded by a huge crowd of
supporters who uncorked champagne bottles and sang ''La Marseillaise''.
Mr Chirac, 62, who stood down as leader of the RPR last autumn to
concentrate on his presidential campaign, has succeeded in his third bid
for the Elysee, to become the fifth president of the Fifth Republic,
founded in 1958 by General De Gaulle. He succeeds socialist President
Francois Mitterrand, who yesterday completed his second successive
seven-year mandate.
Mr Chirac will take his seat today beside Mr Mitterrand in the
ceremonies at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris to mark the 50th anniversary
of VE-Day.
Mr Chirac will set about forming a government as soon as the VE-Day
celebrations are over. He will need to take into account the large
number of MPs in the National Assembly, which has a huge right-wing
majority, who supported Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, Mr Chirac's
Gaullist rival in first round voting.
Mr Alain Juppe, interim leader of the RPR party, foreign affairs
minister and Mr Chirac's campaign spokesman, is tipped to be the next
prime minister.
Mr Chirac's election is a relief for the British Government Once a
sceptic on Europe, Mr Chirac joined the pro-Maastricht camp during a
French referendum on the treaty in 1992. His views on Nato are
sympathetic to Britain, although his attitude to the Common Agricultural
Policy could prove antagonistic to Britain.

VALUABLE photographs, including some of the Bergen-Belsen
concentration camp, have been discovered in a pub. Scotland Yard
appealed for the owner, who left the black-and-white pictures in an East
Dulwich pub in south-east London, to come forward. ''The photographs are
marked with the date and place of when and where they were taken and are
obviously quite valuable,'' said a spokesman. ''But in terms of personal
memories they must be priceless.''

TAX cuts and the beleaguered Tory Party chairman Jeremy Hanley have
emerged as the main targets in the wake of Mr Major's local election
disaster.
A summer reshuffle now appears a certainty, with Mr Hanley a likely
casualty, if he is not dismissed earlier.
Mr Major also has instructed party officials to set up a series of
meetings for him and his Ministers with the Tory grassroots in an
attempt to shore up morale and find out what the party in the country is
thinking.
They will be told that business, and many voters in general, are
disappointed a Government pledged to cut taxes has in fact raised them.
Europe will also be an issue, with Mr Major being informed that far
from being ''rebels'', many of the so-called Euro-sceptics speak for the
feelings of many in the country.
As a series of Ministers lined up to defend Government policies, Mr
Hanley emerged as the man most likely to be made the scapegoat for the
events of Thursday night, which saw the Tories reduced to a rump in
local authorities across England and Wales.
The Prime Minister admitted his party had not spent enough time
explaining its policies to voters.
Cabinet colleagues blamed the rout on a failure to communicate the
party's message to voters: Mr Hanley's responsibility.
However, Mr Hanley made it clear he had no intention of resigning. He
pledged he would not ''slink from the field of battle.''
A hint of grassroots feeling came in a London Weekend television
programme yesterday in which Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind was given
a rough ride by the audience, many of whom were disillusioned Tories or
councillors who had lost their seats.
On the steps the party had to take, he said: ''It requires
self-discipline, it requires honesty with the electorate, and it
requires a series of policies and proposals that people see as
legitimate to their aspirations and consistent with them.''
The voice of the Tory right, Employment Secretary Michael Portillo
said the Tories must fall back on traditional values and placing full
stress on the importance of national sovereignty.
Ayr Tory MP Phil Gallie gave a flavour of some back-bench opinion when
said he thought the Government had gone in the wrong direction on
mortgage tax relief, adding: ''If we don't change the Chancellor, we
have to change the policies.''
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke has been under fire for last week's
insurance tax U-turn and his approach to Europe and the economy.
Another Tory back bencher, Mr Peter Fry, suggested the Chancellor must
go. ''In my view, Kenneth Clarke is losing us votes not gaining us
votes, and I think we do perhaps need a change in that direction,'' he
told the BBC.
Mr Clarke, asked on BBC Breakfast With Frost, whether he thought Mr
Hanley would be chairman and he Chancellor by the end of the year,
replied: ''I haven't the first idea.''
However, he added: ''I am sure by the end of the year our economic
position will be continuing to improve, that we will be on top of the
problem of the modern public services.''
0 Mr Clarke added: ''The opposition is quite uniquely a media package.
People voted for candidates, for a party that has no views, no policies,
is just a marvellous American fluffy creation with a man of Bambi-like
charm leading it, saying nothing at all.''
One or two back benchers are also already talking openly about the
possibility of a leadership challenge to Mr Major in the autumn.
As if there were not enough problems for the Tories, the likelihood
emerged over the weekend that Labour and the Liberal Democrats are
moving closer together in at least finding common ground against them in
some areas of policy.
There would be no formal pact but such a move could well strengthen
the hand of the Lib Dems in areas where they, not Labour, are the direct
challengers to the Tories.

Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, was at a sale of army surplus vehicles at

Across Britain and around the world people join together to mark the
50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe.
Berlin
AN arson attack yesterday on Lubeck Synagogue shamed Germany's
painstaking efforts to promote a tone of reconciliation, as world
leaders were set to arrive for formal ceremonies to mark 50 years of
peace.
The politically embarrassing incident was seen as calculated to put an
ugly torch to the diplomatic credibility of Germany's ''Day Of
Liberation'', as VE Day is being officially termed here.
Two fires were set overnight at the entrance of Lubeck Synagogue and
in an adjoining outhouse but they were brought quickly under control.
Local police in the Baltic port were last night investigating a
suspected repeat involvement by right-wing extremists who fire-bombed
the same synagogue last year.
Four neo-Nazis, aged between 19 and 24, were convicted of premeditated
arson and sentenced to jail terms of between two and a half years and
four and a half years after an attack on March 25 at the ground-floor
prayer room of the synagogue.
The latest attack was immediately condemned by the governor of
Schleswig-Holstein, Heide Simonis. He said: ''Whoever is capable of such
a criminal act must be mentally deranged, considering all the pictures
of Jewish persecution, mass murder, war, and concentration camps
everyone has been seeing these days.''
The attack on the synagogue was the first firebombing of a Jewish
religious building since the fall of the Third Reich, and yesterday's
repeat was a hard reminder that it would still take more than 50 years
of democratic progress and politically-correct gestures to fully
liberate Germany from its past.
For Chancellor Helmut Kohl it was a personal humiliation as it
upstaged his opening of the newly-renovated New Synagogue and the Centre
for Judaism in Berlin last night. The Lubeck attack overshadowed the
ceremony attended by President Roman Herzog, the head of Berlin's Jewish
community Ignatz Bubis and 2500 invited guests.
The 1866 New Synagogue, Berlin's main Jewish temple, was one of 23
destroyed on the night of November 9, 1938, the infamous Kristallnacht,
which marked the culmination of overt anti-semitic demonstrations in
pre-war Nazi Germany.
Lubeck was a sickening echo, inflicting a moral damage far more severe
than the arsonists' thwarted attempts on the building itself.
The incident will reverberate today, when world leaders arrive in
Berlin for the State Ceremony for the Day Of Liberation. It is a
reminder from the extremists that the idea of ''liberation'' is disputed
in a Germany that is still troubled about how to handle the anniversary
of its defeat.
There will be no holiday for schools. Posters have been issued to
every school marking May 8, 1945 and 1995, but they are reversible so
that the grim images of destroyed cities, liberated concentration camps,
youths in uniform and the surrender can be turned to the classroom wall
to show the other side -- bright cameos of Germany's recovery.
Commemorative stamps have been issued, featuring bombed cities and
refugees, but actually finding a set for purchase is another matter, as
the standard issue designs remain available. Despite its best efforts,
Germany continues to present two faces.

* Sinn Fein councillors in Belfast have turned down the opportunity to
join royalty and Government Ministers at a VE Day gala dinner.
The party's 10 councillors in Belfast rejected an invitation from the
Lord Mayor Hugh Smyth to attend the dinner for veterans at City Hall
with the Duke of York as guest of honour.
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and other Northern
Ireland Office Ministers will also be at the event together with local
MPs, Catholic and Protestant church leaders and businessmen.
The Unionist Lord Mayor said he had been duty bound to invite all
councillors to the function including Sinn Fein.
But Alex Maskey, the leader of the Sinn Fein group on the council,
confirmed they would not be going.
''There's no major reason why we won't be attending. We get
invitations to various functions and we take a decision on each one as
they come in.
''On this occasion we decided it was not for us, and we've no regrets
about that,'' he said.

ITALIAN film director Franco Zeffirelli yesterday toasted VE Day with
a Scottish wartime comrade he had not seen for 50 years.
Zeffirelli was the unlikely guest of honour at a VE ceremony in
Ladybank, Fife.
The internationally-renowned director travelled specially to Scotland
to meet up with Mr Jim Riddell, who fought in the Scots Guards near
Florence.
The pair, both now aged 72, first met in 1944 when, as a 20-year-old
freedom fighter, Zeffirelli came across a group of soldiers. He shouted
to them asking if they were English and received the dreaded answer
''no''.
However, his fears were dispelled when Mr Riddell added: ''We're
Scottish.''
Zeffirelli became an interpreter with the intelligence unit of the 1st
Battalion Scots Guards and fought beside Mr Riddell for 18 months until
the end of the war.
They kept in contact for a time but it was not until five years ago,
when Zeffirelli filmed his Hamlet in Scotland, that they got back in
touch.
Mr Riddell said: ''Franco was a very brave man and he had all the
local knowledge we needed when we were fighting to take Florence.
''During wartime, a friend becomes more than a friend. Franco is more
like a brother, there's a bond that has never broken.''
Mr Riddell built up a haulage contractor's business after the war and
became a local councillor. Zeffirelli also directs operas and became
senator for Sicily last year.
The film director, who is now completing his version of Jane Eyre,
said: ''I felt liberated when the soldiers told me they were Scottish.
''All my life I had been under the fascist regime and now I was
free.''

GLASGOW'S VE Day celebrations were a mix of solemn marching, wreath
laying, and retro-entertainment.
Veterans joined senior military and civil dignitaries, including
representatives of the Normandy Veterans' Associations and the British
Legion, for a commemorative service in Glasgow Cathedral yesterday,
where military victory was celebrated and personal loss remembered.
Addressing the packed pews, the Rev Dr William Morris, minister at the
cathedral, said war had taught the nation about unity, a lesson which
needed to be remembered by the states of the European Union. He told the
congregation, which included the provosts of Eastwood and Kilmarnock and
Loudoun, that VE Day reopened wounds of bereavement of those who died
liberating Europe and Asia from the cruel scourge of a ruthless foe.
People, he said, had an array of memories -- some routine, some
painful, some glamorous, some of active service, others of the lone
daylight bomber suddenly killing a dozen people on a lovely summer's
day.
After the service, the veterans' parade snaked its way to George
Square, led by Strathclyde Police Pipe Band. Some confessed that
memories of VE Day were a bit of a blur, a day spent, like so many,
miles from home with regiments in Europe. For others, such as veteran
John Young, who served with the 1st Highland Light Infantry, VE Day was
spent recovering from war wounds in hospital in Cardiff.
Among the congregation, one man said that he had been a boy of only
eight at the time but had come to the service after 50 years of writing
to an elder brother who had fought in the war and emigrated to
Australia.
At the cenotaph, wreaths were laid by Strathclyde Regional Council's
convener, Councillor Bill Perry, Strathclyde Chief Constable Leslie
Sharp, and Commodore Brian Perowne, from the submarine base at Faslane.
Beneath an overcast sky, the veterans stood silently as the Last Post
was sounded and a solitary piper played Flowers of the Forest.
Beside the formal floral tributes lay a bunch of flowers left to a
father with the words, ''You were mine to remember''.
It was more of a light-hearted atmosphere at the Barras market in the
East End, where plastic Union Jacks adorned stalls, a big band played,
and a few stall-holders dressed in forties clothes and Army uniforms.
Those wanting to take away a souvenir could pick up a war-time
''antique'' or a plastic rifle sold at a ''1945 bargain price''.
This evening, the BBC and ITV networks, including Scottish Television,
will observe a two-minute silence during a ceremony in London's Hyde
Park where the Queen will light a symbolic beacon. BBC radio stations
will also observe the silence.

PUNTERS were champing at the bit yesterday for the start of Sunday
opening in bookmakers' shops.
Many outlets across Scotland reported a galloping pace of business and
some even had people queuing outside under starter's orders when the
doors opened.
''Business has been very brisk,'' said Mr Hugh King, proprietor of the
Glasgow-based William King group of shops and vice-chairman of the
Scottish Bookmakers' Association. ''It was above our expectations. In
the larger housing estates, particularly, it was tremendous.
''A betting shop and a pub are like bacon and eggs -- you don't have
one without the other. Pubs are very busy on Sundays so it follows that
bookies can be as well.''
He added that Sunday opening could help bookies ''redress the
balance'' for the income they had been losing because of competition
from the National Lottery's scratch cards.
Mr Jim McNally, Ladbrokes' regional office manager for Scotland, said:
''Our shops have been quite busy up and down the country, especially
early on in the afternoon. In some cases, there were queues outside.''
Enthusiastic customers taking advantage of their new freedom included
Mr Fred Jack, who popped into Ladbrokes in Argyle Street, Glasgow.
''A Sunday is a pretty quiet day with nothing much to do but now you
can go and have a bet,'' he said.
Yesterday's opening is another blow to the churches' efforts to
protect the traditional status of the Sabbath. Nevertheless, Mr Jack
said: ''I think people should be allowed to bet on a Sunday if they
want. Other countries have been doing it for years.''
In staunchly Sabbatarian Stornoway, however, the only betting shop
remained firmly closed. Mr Donald Campbell, the proprietor, said: ''I
didn't think it would be worth my while opening. There's no-one in town
on Sunday for a start.''
The first full on and off-course betting Sunday was marked by meetings
at Newmarket -- which drew a crowd of 20,000 for the 1000 Guineas, the
first classic to be staged on a Sunday -- and Salisbury.
Newmarket officials said yesterday's crowd matched Saturday's figure
and was almost double the attendance when the 1000 Guineas was staged on
a Thursday last year.

THE QUEEN and world leaders relied on the innocence of children and
the idealism of youth yesterday for a symbolic VE Day message of
reconciliation and hope, as neo-Nazis in Germany launched a series of
attacks to mar the celebrations.
Saturday's opening of the main three-day multi-million pound Hyde Park
national party marking the end of the Second World War in Europe had
been very much devoted to the older generation, the veterans of the
conflict, and to the Queen Mother in particular.
Yesterday it was the young people who were given the opportunity to
express their hopes for the future: it was one challenge they were more
than keen to take on.
Amidst a colourful and musical extravaganza, children led 39 heads of
State by the hand to a giant 70ft high globe to sign olive leaves as
symbols of peace. Hundreds of white doves and white balloons were
released as the symbolic globe started to revolve.
However, as the leaders and the young among them tried to display
symbols of peace, Germany again suffered darker images from some its
youth.
Arsonists firebombed a synagogue in Lubeck, northern Germany;
gravestones of victims of Nazi tyranny were toppled in a Berlin
cemetery; and police fought pitched battles with skinheads chanting
''Sieg Heil'' in Potsdam, eastern Germany.
But this shadow of Germany's Nazi past failed to dampen the joyous
celebrations and the powerful mood of hope and reconciliation.
The heads of State started the day with a solemn service in St Paul's
Cathedral: in this weekend of symbolism itself very much a landmark to
wartime hardship in London having, despite all the odds, survived the
blitz with its famous dome lit up as the streets around went up in
flames.
In a service attended by nearly all senior members of the Royal
family, the most poignant moment was the arrival of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, leader of the new united Germany. He had been conscripted into the
Hitler Youth as an adolescent.
He and other heads of state heard the Archishop of Canterbury deliver
a sermon of reconciliation as he called on the leaders to devote
themselves to building a better future.
Freedom, justice, and peace were hard won and must never be taken for
granted, Dr George Carey told the congregation.
''They are to be cherished and worked for anew by every generation.
They are central to what we value most as human beings.''
Dr Carey told the congregation: ''Whether as political or religious
leaders it is our duty to continue to seek the way of peace for this and
future generations.''
The liberation of Europe 50 years ago might have meant little to the
youngsters who took part in the later events in Hyde Park, apart from
what they may have learned in history books or from their grandparents.
But, dressed in white, they took their duties more than seriously as
they grasped the hands of the Queen and other world leaders to escort
them from their seats in the VIP stand to positions around the floral
globe, the centrepiece of the Hyde Park jamboree.
There the world leaders added a national flower to the exhibit before
signing an olive leaf of peace.
The heads of State, including kings and queens, could not disguise
their pleasure at joining in the fun.
The European Union youth orchestra, massed choirs, and young dancers
displayed their extraordinary artistic skills.
Youngsters from the Chicken Shed Theatre Company performed a specially
commissioned song and dance.
Nearby a giant white dove of peace was suspended from an undisguised
crane.
Two huge TV screens on the main stage, opposite the royal box, showed
close- ups of the orchestra, choir and other performers.
There was also a display of reconciliation, albeit temporarily, with
the Prince and Princess of Wales seated as a family group with their
sons Prince William and Prince Harry.
It was an unusual event in recent years for the royal couple to appear
in public together.
Even stranger, along with most of the VIPs, the Prince of Wales and
his family had arrived at Hyde Park on a bus following a lunch at
Buckingham Palace. It was the most convenient way to get such a
gathering to the Hyde Park party on time, and without causing traffic
chaos.
Royal watchers noticed there was little conversation or eye contact
between the heir to the throne and his wife. However, before they parted
the Prince of Wales did kiss his estranged wife, on the cheek.
After the ''guided trip'' to the floral dome, the heads of state
returned to the royal box past a parade of veterans from Allied nations.
The Queen and many heads of state took the time to stop and talk. US
vice-president Al Gore and his wife Tipper even posed for album
snapshots.
In temperatures then touching the 80s, the young people began to find
their own entertainment. Teenagers more used to dancing on their own
quickly found partners and learned how to jitterbug and the enjoyment of
dancing with someone in your arms.
The mood was more sombre when it was time to commemorate fallen
heroes, and renew commitment to peace and reconciliation.
The crowds stood for the National Anthem. The Prince and Princess of
Wales both joined in.
Stars of stage and screen Sir Ian McKellan and Patricia Hodge
performed readings invoking the spirit of wartime Britain and hopes of
peace.
TV monitors at the front of the royal box provided VIPs with a
close-up view of the stage performance which was at least 500 yards
away.
The one disappointing note at Hyde Park appeared to be the
attendances, seemingly well down on those predicted by the organisers.
They believe, however, all that will change today, the actual
anniversary of VE Day, when they hope to recreate the famous scene
outside Buckingham Palace when the crowds thronged to cheer the the King
and Queen and hero of the hour Winston Churchill.
Dame Vera Lynn and Cliff Richard will entertain the crowds from the
Palace forecourt.
The celebrations will include a flypast of vintage aircraft, including
Swordfish, Blenheim, Lancaster, Mosquito, Spitfire, and Hurricane,
followed by a daylight fireworks display.
The day's events will conclude with a huge VE night party and concert
in Hyde Park, during which the two-minute silence will be held before
the Queen sets in chain the lighting of the 1050 beacons around the
country.
Fifty years ago, the Queen escaped Buckingham Palace to join the
crowds outside in The Mall celebrating the end of the European War.
In this modern security conscious world, it is most unlikely that any
junior member of her family will attempt anything similar today.
