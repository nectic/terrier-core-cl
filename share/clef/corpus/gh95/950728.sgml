DISILLUSIONED Celtic shareholders are poised to ask former director
Brian Dempsey to spearhead moves to call an extraordinary general
meeting of the club. Dempsey led the crusade against the old board, a
fight which eventually catapulted Canadian millionaire Fergus McCann to
power.
Dempsey himself was left out when the new board took over at Parkhead.
Now he is being urged to step out of the shadows as the club appears
to suffer one setback after another.
The latest blow, Gordan Petric being snatched from Parkhead by rivals
Rangers, has angered many of the 10,000 plus fans who bought shares in
Celtic.
Their frustration has grown over recent months and the failure of the
latest signing bid, with the obvious underlying message that Rangers are
simply getting stronger while Celtic appear to stand still, has raised
considerable concern among supporters and shareholders.
I understand that Dempsey has been approached on several occasions,
but he has resisted all the attempts to drag him back into the fray.
But this summer of discontent, I believe, has had Dempsey sharing
concern at the direction the club is taking.
Last night, one major shareholder told me: ''We believe that there are
questions which must be answered by the present board.
''Remember, many of the fans were never able to do that under the
previous regime. Now, though, things are different. There was always a
belief that the support owned the club in a moral sense, but now more
than 10,000 have bought shares and want to know how that money is being
used.
''The high hopes we all had at the time of the share issue have yet to
materialise despite victory in the Scottish Cup.''
Ten per cent of shareholders would be enough to demand an EGM, and
that is beginning to look inevitable.
The last few months have seen the club reel from one crisis to
another.
The rift between manager Tommy Burns and chairman McCann became public
knowledge. There have been worries over safety conditions at the new
stadium.
And players have been targeted as possible signings, and then lost for
one reason or another.
The fans want to know what has happened to the ''lion's share'' of the
issue money which McCann promised would be spent on players.
If Dempsey is persuaded to lead the fight once more -- and I believe
that will happen -- then McCann will face serious problems from his vast
army of shareholders.
Historically, the Celtic support were disenfranchised by the families
who once ran the club.
Now many of them ask: What has happened to OUR money, the cash they
gave to Celtic in the belief that the club would be challenging Rangers?
An extraordinary general meeting could set the scene for another
bitter battle for control of Celtic.
Dempsey will be a potent weapon for the growing number of disenchanted
shareholders.
Meantime, Celtic are hoping that German international striker Andreas
Thom, whom they have been chasing for the last couple of weeks, will
tell them some time today that he is ready to move to Parkhead.
Manager Tommy Burns, however, would only comment at Glasgow Airport:
''You'll have to ask the chairman.''
McCann said: ''We are continuing to pursue the signing of a top class
striker which has been our priority throughout the summer. As soon as
the signing is completed, we will let you know. We would like to thank
our fans for their patience.''

RANGERS will parade their new #1.5m defender Gordan Petric at Ibrox
this afternoon, and if all goes to plan, he will be joined by yet
another major signing, Russian international striker Oleg Salenko.
Despite failing to land the Romanian, Florin Raducioiu, from Espanol,
manager Walter Smith has maintained that he still wanted to sign a
quality striker and a deal has been agreed between the Ibrox club and
Spanish League side Valencia for Salenko.
The Russian is believed to have travelled to Glasgow last night to
sign a three-year contract, and has said that his reason for moving was
the prospect of playing in the Champions' League.
''I took a long time to think about the deal,'' he said. ''But the
prospect of playing in the Champions' League decided it for me.
''I had never considered moving to Glasgow before, but I have heard
good reports about the city and the club. Rangers are a bigger club than
Valencia.''
It was also reported from Spain yesterday that Valencia had already
replaced Salenko by signing Brazilian World Cup striker Viola.
If there are no last minute hitches, Rangers will have spent around
#10m to strengthen their squad during the close season, the other buys
being Paul Gascoigne, from Lazio, Aberdeen defender Stephen Wright, and,
of course, Petric from Dundee United.
It is all geared towards a determined challenge in the coming European
Champions' League. Before that, however, Rangers face a preliminary tie
against Famagusta, of Cyprus, but with the new signings, plus the men
who won a seventh successive domestic title last season, there should be
little danger of a shock.
Having yesterday returned from a three-match tour of Denmark, Rangers
are now ready for a much stiffer challenge, and they will get that when
they host their own tournament at Ibrox this weekend, which also
features Tottenham, Sampdoria, of Italy, and Steaua Bucharest, from
Romania.
The Rangers summer spending spree has been financed by fan power, the
champions having banked almost #13m from supporters since the end of
last season.
That includes almost #5m from the controversial Blue Heaven scheme,
plus #8m from 34,000 season tickets.
Ibrox commercial manager Bob Reilly said: ''The income we have
received as the season approaches has reached an unprecedented level.
Our fans have committed their support and money and, in turn, we have
honoured our promise to use that cash in specific ways for their
benefit, with new players being purchased.''
Ibrox chairman David Murray launched the Blue Heaven appeal in April,
with season ticket holders being asked to pay an extra #399 to guarantee
their seat for 25 years.
Murray pledged all the money from the scheme would go into a transfer
fund to buy players.
Rangers will also take their season ticket total sales to 39,000
during the season -- still leaving 6000 on the waiting list.
Said Reilly: ''We have a contract for #4m for work to in fill in the
corners at the Govan Stand, and that is due to be finished in January.''

<HEADLINE>Unitech sees its profits power ahead by 84%</HEADLINE>

UNITECH shareholders are being rewarded for their long years of
patience as the power supplies begins to show its mettle. Profits for
last year soared 84% to #36.4m and with a further considerable advance
came through in the current 12 months.
Founder and chairman Peter Curry had an additional bonus when the
Swiss company Saurer said it was placing its 17.2 million shares through
a UBS book-building exercise to be completed on August 8. Saurer owns
24.9% of Unitech.
With Unitech shares up 19p at 432p the Saurer move will raise about
#74m although in terms of Swiss francs, it has not been a particularly
profitable exercise.
At a stroke, a lingering takeover threat has been removed and the
stock will become much more marketable. Another Swiss company, the
Elektrowatt conglomerate, continues to hold 29.7%.
The profits pulse came in large part from the 50.6% owned Nemic-Lambda
Japanese subsidiary. That is benefiting from the strength of the yen in
that many Japanese firms are increasing their investment in cheaper
manufacturing countries in South-east Asia and in Britain and so need
equipment to convert alternating current into direct current. It also
has a strong position in test equipment for semi-conductors.
Unitech's own power supply activities are seeing the first fruits of
the P2 series of modular controls with sales in the current year
expected to double to about #30m and at enouraging margins.
Total group sales rose 21% to #365m to return a margin of 10% at the
pre-tax level.
There were improvements in all territories -- the UK is just one
eighth of the business in profit terms. The only fly in the ointment is
the possible downturn in the French car industry for which Unitech
supplies connectors.
The question is whether it makes an acquisition -- those in the past
have generally performed better than expected or to concentrate entirely
on organic growth. Considerable investment is going into management
development to cope with either eventuality.
Profits this time round should hit #50m to leave the shares trading at
13 times possible earnings.
The dividend total is 15% higher at 6.56p for a mere 1.9% yield but
there is substantial support from the thought that the Japanese
investment is worth #296m or the whole of Unitech itself.

A TOP referee yesterday warned Rangers record signing Paul Gascoigne
that he was walking a tightrope, and that it was vital he curb his
smouldering temper, or he would face the red card early in his career at
Ibrox. The same man, however, warned that officials also had a duty to
protect the English international midfielder.
Denmark's Peter Mikkelsen refereed Rangers final match of their tour
against Hvidovre in Copenhagen on Wednesday night. It was a display that
embraced all the characteristics of Gascoigne -- from his on-field
temper to a stunning free-kick goal as Rangers beat the Danish side 2-1.
But Mikkelsen, who has officiated at two World Cups and was FIFA's
No.1 referee in 1991 and 1993, says Gazza must not be tempted to take
the law into his own hands against opponents. Twice on Wednesday,
Gascoigne was fouled from behind and reacted angrily with flailing
elbows.
Since Holland's Jan Wouters broke Gascoigne's cheekbone at Wembley in
1993, the 28-year-old England star seems determined not to be caught by
an elbow again. ''It was a friendly, so I felt my job was to warn him
what might happen in a serious fixture,'' said Mikkelsen.

Tampere 2,
Dundee Utd 2
DUNDEE United had their pre-season tour of Finland brought to a
disapointing end last night when champions Tampere struck twice late on
to earn a draw.
The Tannadice men, who won their two earlier games, had ooked
comfortable against Finland's European hopefuls when they raced into a
two-goal lead after 65 minutes.
Robbie Winters fired United in front 20 minutes into the match, and a
defensive mistake let Paddy Connolly add to the United lead.
But it took only one more minute for United to concede their first
goal of the trip, Juomela head-flicking home a Karatajen corner. And
Grandi fired home the equaliser six minutes later.
* ARBROATH last night signed striker Willie Watters from Stirling
Albion. Watters teams up again with manger John Brogan, who was
previously in charge at Stirling.
* STENHOUSEMUIR have paid out #10,000 to sign central defender Kenny
Brannigan from Stranraer.

FRENCH swimmer Anne Chagnaud was yesterday suspended for two years by
the International Swimming Federation (FINA) after failing a drugs test.
Chagnaud, who was fourth in the 25km women's race at the world
championships in Rome last September, tested positive for the stimulant
etilphrine at the marathon world series event in Brazil on January 28.
FINA rejected the appeal of Finland's Petteri Lehtinen and confirmed
his two-year suspension for use of the stimulant salbutamol, for which
he tested positive in an out-of-competition doping control on March 16.

DUNDEE manager Jim Duffy last night gave Polish star Dariusz Adamczuk
the green light to go on breaking the rules -- if it helps sort out his
tangled career.
The defender turned out for Stoke City this week in a pre-season
friendly against Exeter without being granted permission to play as a
trialist, but Duffy is prepared to turn a blind eye if Adamczuk can find
a club and end the saga.
The Pole has been at the centre of a four-nation transfer turmoil for
more than a year, but was told he is still a Dundee player after a
full-scale inquiry by FIFA.
Duffy said: ''I am happy for Adamczuk to train anywhere, or play for
anyone, if it helps end the stalemate and brings us in a transfer fee.''
Stoke revealed last night that Adamczuk was no longer training with
them and were unsure if he would be returning.
Norwegian defender Morten Anderson could miss a chance to join Dundee
because they cannot get clearance to play him as a pre-season trialist.
* MIDFIELDER Derek McInnes may yet stay with Morton. Cappielow manager
Allan McGraw, back from holiday, said last night: ''I am meeting him
tomorrow. The directors have made him a very good offer and we are
certainly talking.''
Finnish midfielder Janne Lindberg has accepted a one-year extention to
his contract. Said McGraw: ''As he was already signed for next season,
that means he is on a two-year deal now. That is the same as our other
Finnish player, Marko Rajamaki.''

ENGLAND'S spearheads, led by Angus Fraser, made early incisions to
cripple the West Indies batting after the tourists had decided to make
first use of a good pitch at Old Trafford.
England had much the better of the play, but the balance was restored
somewhat by the end of the first day in the fourth Test. On 65 for two,
with John Crawley out to what turned out to be the last ball, England
were 151 behind with eight wickets remaining.
Apart from Brian Lara, who fell just 13 short of his first century of
the tour, none of the West Indies' batsmen drew any comfort in facing
the England attack.
Fraser, whose first ball of the match was confidently pulled for 4 by
Carl Hooper, launched his blitz in the fifth over when Sherwin Campbell,
attempting a drive, edged the ball behind to wicketkeeper Jack Russell.
That was the encouraging start England's threadbare pace attack needed.
They went into this Test with just two front-line fast bowlers, Fraser
and Dominic Cork, after Darren Gough was left out, and two spinners,
John Emburey and Mike Watkinson, who, with two for 28 in nine overs,
made a fine Test debut on his home ground.
Graeme Hick also was omitted, making a total of six changes -- mainly
injury-prompted -- from the team that lost the previous Test by an
innings.
While the West Indies' modest total can, to some extent, be attributed
to careless stroke play, England's bowlers must get full credit for
restricting the tourists to just 216. Fraser and Cork, in the presence
of an 18,000 capacity crowd, gave a wonderful exhibition of controlled
pace bowling in sharing eight wickets.
The accurate line-and-length stuff from the tall Middlesex man never
allowed the West Indies to settle. While his first spell of eight overs,
which brought him one for 22, was commendable, his second damaged the
middle order and the West Indians never recovered.
With just 10 minutes to go to lunch, the left-handed Jimmy Adams
squared up to a ball from Fraser which lifted a little and took the
outside edge of the bat. Nick Knight, at second slip, gratefully
accepted his first catch on his Test debut. In his next over Fraser had
captain Richie Richardson caught at slip, again off the outside edge.
That was the end of the first session's play and the Windies had been
knocked back on their heels on 94 for four.
In a span of eight balls, Fraser had taken two for five in a most
effective second spell.
Throughout the second session, Lara remained the only batsman to show
any confidence in facing England's combined pace and spin attack.
Off-spinners Emburey and Watkinson were both economical and although
Watkinson, in his first over, was hit for the only 6 of the day, over
mid-on by Keith Arthurton, he did not lose control over his line or
length. Indeed, an over later he got his own back when he made Arthurton
his first Test victim, having him caught at extra cover.
Lara continued to play strokes with typical fluency. He drove with
excellent timing and was quick to pull anything that dropped a little
short. His 87 included 16 boundaries and took no more than 118 balls
In the final session, Dominic Cork showed the excellent bowling form
that he has maintained since making his debut in the second Test. In a
30-ball spell he claimed three for 28, which included the prize scalp of
Lara, whom he trapped leg before wicket. Scoreboard:

<HEADLINE>Accusations of lack of advice on EU grants to curb damage. Peatlands policy attacked</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROY GREGOR</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>22</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977174679</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT agencies were accused yesterday of not giving farmers and
crofters enough advice on how they can cash in on European Union support
that would help reduce damage to peatlands.
Clifton Bain of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds told
delegates to the international Peatlands Convention in Edinburgh that EU
grants were available for the removal of trees, improving blocked drains
and ditches, and the reversal of damage to thousands of acres of
peatland.
''Agri-environment funds are available but too little advice is given
to land occupiers,'' he said.
He said that 98% of Scotland's raised bogs were already damaged. It
was not a serious problem of new operations alone.
He was challenged by Dr John Miles, head of the Scottish Office
Ecological Advisory Service, who said the Government was doing much more
to support ''the greening of the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy)'' than
was realised and that 50,000 farm and croft businesses were trying to
remain viable while doing what they could to protect the environment.
Caroline Steel, of The Wildlife Trusts, Lincoln, said her
organisation's campaign to protect peatlands had come a long way in the
last six years but accused the peat-using horticultural industries of
not doing enough to exploit the potential of alternative plant-growing
products.
''Peat use is expected to rise and that is depressing. We have not
persuaded Government and industry there there is a need to switch to
non-peat products. Unless the demand for peat is reduced our bogs will
be under threat.''
From the horticultural industry Nick Temple-Heald, representing the
Peat Producers' Association, said at an earlier session that the
forecasts made by doom merchants six years ago about the effect
harvesting peat for garden use had been proved wrong.
He said that despite extensive research alternatives to peat had not
proved acceptable to many consumers, either on price or efficacy.
He predicted that the 5000 hectares of bogs used for the extraction of
peat would increase by only 1000 hectares in the next 25 years.
''We are deeply involved in after-use planning and regeneration that
is concerned with the care of this sutainable resource. We want
co-operation with those others who want to save and conserve peat
bogs.''
Stewart Brooks, of the Scottish Wildlife Trust, organisers of the
convention, said that only 9% of the original ''near-natural'' raised
bog vegetation remained in Scotland. However, he pointed to the success
of a scheme at Langlands Moss, East Kilbride, which had been afforested
in the 1960s. Recent use of a helicopter to remove trees and the damming
of drains and ditches, was encouraging bogland regeneration.
''Overall, this could dramatically expand the raised bog resource when
trees reach maturity in commercailly forested peatland in 2010-2020.''
The convention backed a seven-point declaration that called on
governments to support increased peatland conservation action and
demanded that the EU provides funds for rehabilitation of degraded
peatland sites.
This Sunday is Scottish Wildlife Trust International Bog Day with
events throughout Scotland.
* A PRE-harvest check on the accuracy of portable moisture meter
readings has revealed discrepancies which could cost farmers money.
Aberdeen Grain organised a ''clinic'' at Whiterashes and found that
some machines brought in for testing were wildly out. Most good machines
should not show more than a 0.5% discrepancy but some of those tested
were up to 3% out.
Glyn Whitehead, managing director of Aberdeen Grain, said: ''A farmer
could think he had dried grain to 15% moisture according to his meter
and then have it rejected by a buyer because of high moisture content.
Equally, overdrying wastes time and fuel and loses money through
excessive weight loss.''

THIRD place yesterday in the penultimate race of Loch Long Week sets
Murray Caldwell in Rebel firmly on course to become the youngest winner
of the class championship at just 17.
In northerly breezes which again were so light as to require the
course to be shortened to one circuit and made the strong tidal currents
the main consideration, Mark Bradshaw steered Allegro to the front at
the final turning mark and won by 15 seconds.
Championship leader Sula slumped to eighth place yesterday, leaving
helm Duncan Farquhar having to win today's final race, and hoping to
relegate Caldwell to at least three places astern, in order to win
overall. Results:
Race 5 -- 1, Allegro (A Black/M Bradshaw); 2, Zephyr (C Still); 3,
Rebel (M Caldwell); 4, Boomerang (G Hutchinson); 5, Gawdeamus (A
Maconachie).
Overall, including one discard -- 1, Rebel 8.75 points; 2, Sula 11.75;
3, Boomerang 12.75; 4, Allegro 17.75; 5, Iceni (I Harris) 18.

THE first of the annual round of pedigree ram sales in Scotland begins
at nine o'clock sharp this morning when the best of the Suffolk breed
are due to be sold at Ingliston.
According to the Breed Society secretary Penny Lawrence interest is
high. ''Commercial lamb producers are buying Suffolks in preference to
other breeds because they get growth and confirmation,'' she said.
Yesterday's show of ram lambs was outstanding and reckoned by many
observers to be the best for several years. Whether last year's average
of #2084 for 247 sold can be maintained is open to question but several
prominent breeders are known to be on the look out for stud sires.
Indeed there is growing speculation that the breed record of 26,000
guineas set last year will once again be broken.
Almost certain to be receiving some of the high spending are the
brothers Kenny and Bruce Mair from Kinnermit, Turriff, Aberdeenshire,
who cleaned up taking the supreme and reserve awards with sons of the
22,000-guinea Panymoor Prelude as well as the prize for the best pen of
three.
Last year the Mair's took both the championship and reserve titles and
this year's win was their third overall championship at Ingliston.
The judge, Sandy Fraser, said he found it difficult to choose between
the two lambs adding: ''The champion had just that bit extra with great
length and top line. He's a sheep right in line with modern market
demands.''

ENGLISH COUNTIES
DISCARDED England all-rounder David Capel battled to stop
Warwickshire's charge towards a second successive Britannic Assurance
County Championship yesterday.
He hit a defiant 50 as pacemen Allan Donald (4-41) and Tim Munton
(4-47) skittled second-placed Northants for 152. Capel then took 4-29 as
the home side closed on 159-6, with opener Roger Twose unbeaten on 98.
Another England discard, Mark Ramprakash, shone for third-placed
Middlesex. He hit the Sussex attack for thirty 4s in an unbeaten 185,
sharing stands of 119 with Paul Weekes (80) and 222 with Mike Gatting
(92 not out).
Lancashire's Neil Fairbrother rattled up 132, blasting 17 boundaries
and six 6s in his 149-ball stay. Oxford skipper Gregor Macmillan, who
hit a century on his championship debut for Leicestershire, had 13
boundaries and four 6s in his 122 against Surrey, sharing a marvellous
stand of 195 with Hansie Cronje, who hit nineteen 4s and two 6s in his
163.

FOOTBALL ROUND-UP
JIM Jefferies' spiralling career swayed in the balance last night, but
the scales were tipped decisively in Falkirk's favour.
The former Hearts central defender will make his big career decision
this morning, having had extended talks with Hearts chairman Chris
Robinson.
But the omens yesterday were that an astonishing five-year deal worth
#250,000 at Brockville was outweighing his life-long ambition to be
manager of Hearts.
Falkirk chairman George Fulston has battled tooth and nail to retain
the man who took the unfashionable Bairns into the top half of the
premier division. His ambitious plans for a new #15m all-seated stadium
are well advanced, and he wants Jefferies to stay and further develop a
team to grace their new home.
Against all that, Jefferies has had to balance Hearts' horrendous
debts, with an overdraft in excess of #4m and other smaller, pressing
commitments.
He is also aware that there is a takeover scheme by property tycoon
Jim Glass still on the back-burner, while potentially expensive
litigation with former chairman Wallace Mercer and manager Tommy McLean
is pending.
Jefferies spend 15 years at Tynecastle as a player and has never made
any secret of his long-term ambition to sit in the Hearts manager's
chair.
Turning the opportunity down could be the hardest decision he has ever
made and last night he was still giving few clues.
''I'm going to take the time allowed to make this very important
decision and I will have to weigh up every available factor,'' he
stressed.
''Falkirk have been great for me and my affection for Hearts is well
documented. This set of circumstances has not been of my making and the
decision will be made objectively.''
If Jefferies, as expected, elects to stay where he is -- with players
like Mo Johnston, Steve Kirk, and John Hughes -- it will represent a
massive blow for the Edinburgh club.
Robinson made it clear throughout this week that there was a
short-list of one for the post made vacant by McLean's controversial
sacking last Friday.
And if he has to resume the search all over again, the status of
Hearts' manager -- once one of the most sought-after in the Scottish
game -- will be fundamentally damaged.
Three managers -- Joe Jordan, Sandy Clark, and McLean -- have all
fallen in the last four years and the Edinburgh club's overall
predicament appears to be worsening.
Jefferies has been at Brockville for five seasons and if he accepts
the vast Fulston contract, it will keep the 45-year-old there into the
next century.
However, there was some good news for Robinson yesterday when striker
John Robertson signed a new two-year contract which effectively makes
the 30-year-old striker a Hearts man for life.

IVORY &amp; Sime's Isis Trust outperformed its benchmark index during the
six months to June 30 due to a strong performance across the board in
its portfolio of UK equities.
In particular, the #27.4m trust benefitted from its overweight
holdings in the buoyant pharmaceuticals sector.
Net asset value increased 7.4% to 117.8p per share, beating a 6.7%
rise in the FTSE A All-share index.
Isis Trust aims for long-term capital growth.
''We go for companies with solid balance sheets that can grow their
earnings and dividends over the long term,'' said fund manager Gordon
Neilly.
The trust had shown improvement ''across the board'' during the first
half of 1995, Mr Neilly said, but he singled out pharmaceuticals as a
particularly strong performer.
Looking ahead, he remained optimistic. Mr Neilly said shares were
trading at fair value, but takeover activity was likely to add fizz to
the market.
The Isis Trust mainly consists of ordinary shares on which no dividend
is payable.
But holders of convertible annuity shares will enjoy a second
quarterly dividend of 5.5p. This brings the total dividend for the half
year to 11p, unchanged from the first six months of 1994.
Earnings per convertible annuity share were 13.69p compared to 13.68p
previously.

IRVINE-based Ayrshire Metal Products raised interim pre-tax profits by
64% to #1.3m even though the construction sector, an important market
for the steel-processing side of its business, remained fragile, writes
IAN McCONNELL.
The company, which underwent a radical shake-up in the wake of poor
results in 1991 and 1992, increased its half-time dividend from 1.25p to
2p. Its shares gained 9p to 150p.
Managing director Colin Macnab said there had been a general
improvement right across the board, with all divisions now profitable.
Mr Macnab said the construction sector was a bit disappointing but,
anticipating a possible change in Government in two years' time, he has
pencilled in a potential boost to construction and believes Ayrshire
Metal would be well-placed to cope with this.
The market for Ayrshire Metal's truck parts continues to improve.
Turnover rose 24% to #21.9m in the six months to end-June and Mr
Macnab is ''reasonably confident'' about the second half.
In March, the steel processor and stockholder unveiled a 62% increase
in 1994 pre-tax profits to #2.18m.
The company has a factory in Irvine, which employs about 135 of its
300-strong workforce, another at St Helens near Liverpool, and a further
two in the West Midlands.
It believes its relatively recent move into steel stockholding
operations, which are also based in the West Midlands, has reduced the
cyclical nature of its business.

Currently Mr John (57) is responsible for Inchcape's world-wide Toyota
cars interests, is taking over and his knowledge of Asia Pacific markets
was a crucial factor in his appointment. He was appointed a
non-executive dorector in 1993 and seems likely to be a less high
profile figure than Mr Giordano who also doubles up as chairman of
British Gas.
Alexander Dyer, BOC's chief executive and deputy chairman, who is 62,
will also retire from the board at the same time.
He will be succeeded by Danny Rosenkranz (50) as the group's chief

against over-optimism on full-year profits and sales.
The company said currency markets remained uncertain. ''We therefore
reaffirm our (first-quarter) outlook and caution against overly

the year 1995.''
Net profit from normal operations in January-June jumped to 1130m

INTEREST rates were left on hold after the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of the Bank of England,
Eddie George, met for the last time before the summer recess.
In May the Governor pressed for an immediate rise in rates, but was
rebuffed by the Chancellor. Mr George repeated his demand in June with
the same result.
Yesterday's meeting was the second held in July. Though all the
pundits were forecasting that there would be no change in rates most
thought there was no reason for Mr George to back away from his earlier
demand.
The Bank is due to publish its quarterly inflation report on
Wednesday. The economy has slowed down since the last report in May, but
analysts see no reason why the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street should
change her view that the Government was in danger of missing its
inflation target.
James Capel's Adam Cole said that if the Bank stuck to its inflation
forecast it needed to press the case for a rise in rates.
The Bank's view is that on unchanged interest rates underlying
inflation will rise towards the top of its 1% to 4% target range, before
falling back, but remaining above 2.5% by the end of the current
Parliament.
The Treasury said yesterday the second quarter gross domestic product
figures had confirmed that growth had slowed to a healthy, sustainable
rate.
The majority of monthly indicators also suggested some slowdown, it
added.
The CBI survey had shown the domestic price expectations balance had
changed little since April, suggesting lower inflationary pressures than
earlier in the year.
The Treasury cited unchanged retail sales in June, and a fall in
manufacturing output in May as evidence of a slowdown in economic
activity.
It also pointed to slower reductions in unemployment.
However, the Bank is unlikely change its tune on the basis of these
developments. Growth is still above its trend rate of 2.25%, especially
if North Sea oil and gas extraction is excluded.
Moreover, the pound is sporting a loss of 5.8% this year. The
inflationary implications of this remain the Bank's principal concern.
Most analysts now do not expect a rise in rates until the final
quarter of the year at the earliest.
The betting is that rates will peak at 7.75% or less. Yet in May the
City was nearly unanimous in forecasting an immediate half-point rise
from the current 6.75%.

OVERALL sales of Boots rose 7% in the first quarter to June 30,
chairman Sir Michael Angus told the annual meeting yesterday.
There were mixed results among the various operations but the sale of
suncare related products helped boost Boots the Chemists by 5.9% and
sales here were close to budget.
The main feature continues to be the strength of the core business of
NHS dispensing, over-the-counter healthcare and beauty and personal
care.
The market chose, though, to take a cautious view given some of the
more negative aspects of the figures such as Do-it-All, the home
improvement joint venture with WH Smith where sales were down 12.6% or
6.6% on a like for like basis, and AG Stanley where there was a 11.2%
decline on the same basis. This reflected the still depressed housing
market and the chairman indicated that there were no quick cures.
On the upside, Boots Opticians enjoyed an excellent first quarter and
is equipping larger practices with the very latest testing equipment to
ensure a superior service to customers. Children's World was another
good performer with children's fashions -- at higher margins --
continuing to be strong.
Sir Michael told the meeting that investment continues in all the
group businesses where it is creating value -- in Boots the Chemists in
store refurbishment and information systems, and the store development
programme; in Halfords and Children's World in the development of new
superstores; in Boots Contract Manufacturing in more efficient plant,
and in Boots Healthcare International in the development of brands.
Investment is also being put into Boots Properties where investment is
expected to give a good long-term return.
But he admitted that while the general economic indiciators are
positive and show that the economy is growing, many businesses are
showing flat trading performances.
He said: ''Our own analysis is that there are underlying factors that
will continue to depress consumer confidence and inhibit spending,
especially on high-ticket items. The continuing stagnation in the
housing market, including negative equity, has a clear impact on
expenditure on home improvements and related do-it-yourself and
decorating businesses.''
Given the environment, for the most part the first quarter could be
considered a good performance much in line with estimates. Certainly
analysts were not changing their profit projections at this stage.

HIGHLAND Distilleries is making a major reorganisation of its
management structure and commercial director John Byers is to leave the
Famous Grouse distiller after 24 years' service, writes ANDREW WILSON.
In future, the production from the four operational distilleries,
warehousing, maturation and sales of new and mature whisky will be that
of a newly-formed subsidiary, Highland Malt Distilling. The managing
director will be Jamie Wilson, who will also remain as finance director
of the parent company with Bill McGregor as operations director. He is
resigning from the main board to take up that position.
Highland chief executive Brian Ivory said the decision was the result
of an evolutionary process. Highland started purely as a production
company in 1887 and the main board was always involved in production
matters whereas marketing was devolved to the Matthew Gloag subsidiary.
The main board, under the chairmanship of John Goodwin, will
concentrate on strategic issues which have become more complicated and
international following upon the link-up with Remy Cointreau, which
handles an ever increasing proportion of the company's export sales.
Mr Ivory refused to indicate how much compensation Mr Byers, 50, will
receive. It is not clear from the annual report what his salary was, but
it is likely around #85,000-#90,000. The terms of his contract were not
disclosed.

THE costs of the defence against the takeover attempt by Enterprise
Oil were substantial at #24m but that seems to have been a fair price
given the subsequent vast improvement in Lasmo's operating abilities and
strategy.
On overall turnover up 8% to #330m, Lasmo achieved net profits of #22m
compared with a #13m loss in the comparable period although that was
after the bid cost.
There is no interim dividend but there will be a 1.25p final as
already promised.
Market reaction was to take the figures in its stride and instead
worry as to whether Enterprise will place its 9.8% stake originally
acquired at 168p or #159m. That compares with the current Lasmo price of
177p so Enterprise is losing money after financing costs. It did write
the value down to 150p but the original purchase price is what matters.
In the first six months, daily production rose just 2% to 170,000
barrels of oil equivalent but chairman Rudolph Agnew expects that the
total for the year will be much the same as last year at 173,000 b/d.
However, the average price in the first six month at $17 was higher
than expected and translated to an increase in the sterling price of 8%
to #10.69.
It has since weakened and Brent crude is presently trading at around
$16.30 (#10.22) and seems unlikely to do much for the forseeable future.
Instead, Lasmo is looking to boost output to 200,000 b/d thanks to the
combination of the 25%-owned Liverpool Bay gas project as well as the
Birch and Andrew fields.
The Algerian finds look exciting and could well escape political
turmoil now that the European Investment Bank is set to pour vast
amounts of funds into the country. If that does establish long-term
stability, then the perception of Lasmo can only improve markedly.
In the short term, there will be a reduction in gas cargoes from
Indonesia to Japan as there has been a fall in demand for power because
of the hot summer.
Lasmo has been adept at reducing costs through both efficiencies and
selling high-cost operations such as its stake in Ninian and the
associated problem of disposing of a large concrete platform. It has
also divested the mature Malacca Stait which was beginning to contribute
overhead rather than profit.
The net effect is that costs should drop to #3 per barrel by 1997
compared with #3.71 a year ago and the #3.23 in the first half.
The stock is a secure hold at present but could offer excitement on
both the Algerian and Columbian discoveries.

DAMON Hill threatened to fan the flames of his bitter rivalry with
Michael Schumacher yesterday after criticising the German's reaction to
his offer of peace.
Hill is annoyed that his plan to share the parade car with Schumacher
before Sunday's German Grand Prix has been interpreted as an admission
of guilt about their controversial crash at Silverstone 11 days ago.
The German accepted Hill's offer -- normally only drivers from the
same team parade together -- but also made another personal jibe by
describing his closest challenger as moody.
''Accepting my offer is a good move on his part. But to imply it's an
admission of guilt is a bit irritating,'' said Hill.
''There is no question of any guilt or me feeling guilty. It was a
proper overtaking manoeuvre,'' he added about the British Grand Prix
incident for which both drivers officially shared the blame.
But Hill, who will have a personal bodyguard this weekend in case of
any attacks from fanatical German fans, added: ''To take someone's offer
to make up and then try and get an advantage out of it is wrong. That's
an example of him perpetuating the whole thing.
''If people try psychological warfare on me, I am a lot cleverer than
that -- I can dish it out if I want to, but it is not the right way.
''I have shown I am prepared to put aside our differences. Someone has
to be adult about it and give way and say enough is enough. I'm not
interested in playing silly games -- I am more interested in winning
races.''
''From my offer, I am demonstrating I can bear to be in the guy's
company for however long it takes to go round the stadium. We'll wave at
the crowd and show everyone we are here to race, not to perform some
sort of dogfight.''
Hill does not fear any repercussions from German fans among the
100,000 crowd. ''As long as it's good-natured ribbing, I can take that.
Hopefully, it will be kept at that. I do not need anyone to plead with
them to go easy on me, as I can take care of myself.''
But Hill and the Williams team will keep a low profile, as they did
last year, after he allegedly received death threats when the feud with
Schumacher first surfaced.
Schumacher has an 11-point championship lead over Hill but the
two-horse race could be blown wide open this weekend, with Frenchman
Jean Alesi just three points behind Hill.
Alesi, upset at reports linking Schumacher and Hill with a move to
Ferrari, his current employers, is the in-form driver.
Another threat could be Johnny Herbert, who scored a famous victory in
front of his home fans when he ended his 71-race wait for a first
grand-prix triumph at Silverstone and seemingly dispelled doubts about
his long-term future at Benetton.
David Coulthard, Hill's Williams team-mate, will also be aiming to end
his victory drought, while Mark Blundell's race-by-race deal with
McLaren continues.
Bookmakers Ladbrokes make Hill 5-2 second favourite for the German
Grand Prix behind Schumacher, who is 4-6. David Coulthard is 7-1 and
Johnny Herbert 20-1.

SCOTS find it difficult to see why the Prime Minister should allow and
facilitate a constitutional referendum for Northern Ireland but actively
refuse one for Scotland, SNP leader Alex Salmond told an audience in
Northern Ireland yesterday.
Mr Salmond said Scots welcomed Mr Major's stance on a referendum for
the province but could not help but contrast the Government's position
on a referendum for Scotland. It was a contradiction for which the UN
Human Rights Committee last week had requested an explanation, he said.
Mr Salmond, speaking publicly in Northern Ireland for the first time
as SNP leader, said: ''You do not have to believe in independence, or
the process of independence, to accept the democratic right of people to
choose the constitutional structure they live under.
''That right of choice and self-determination is basic to modern
citizenship. The denial of Scotland's democratic rights -- a denial
based upon an archaic incorporating Union entered into in very different
times and in the context of a very different society -- is a running
sore on Scotland's body politic.''
Mr Salmond, addressing the eighth cross-community John Hewitt
International Summer School in County Antrim, also attacked sectarianism
in Scotland and called for an end to all forms of discrimination and the
protection of a written constitution for all citizens.
''The SNP's commitment to a Bill of Rights and written constitution
means that we will outlaw any discrimination but we also have to
eradicate it from the dark recesses of the Scottish psyche.''
He added: ''We also have to speak out against institutionalised
discrimination. For example, it is a scandal of some considerable
proportions that no Catholic can sit on the throne, or marry the heir to
the throne -- an attitude entrenched in law that belongs to the archaic
arrangements of the eighteenth century, not the bright prospects of the
twenty-first.''
Mr Salmond later argued that the development of Europe had opened the
door to constitutional progress in both Scotland and Ireland.
He concluded by stating that uniting Scotland in the bringing together
of the issues he identified could be done only by acts of reconciliation
and by embarking on a journey that was broader in purpose than simply
the achievement of a political aim.
''There will be a defining moment . . . an instant of change from
political dependence to independence, from Union to sovereignty. But
that moment will be a mark of our progress, not the beginning or end of
the process.
''Similarly, I believe that the process of change in Northern Ireland
cannot be understood within the conventional view of all or nothing.
There must be time to change, a process of change, and building towards
a future. That should be the concept at the heart of the peace process
and it is one that we support and encourage wholeheartedly.''
The John Hewitt International Summer School is held in memory of the
Irish poet who died in 1987.

CONFIDENT that the feel-good factor will finally emerge in 1996,
Murray Income Trust has been reversing its underweight position in
consumer-dependent stocks, writes IAN McCONNELL.
During the last six months, the #297m investment trust, which is
managed in Glasgow by Murray Johnstone, has taken a #3.2m stake in the
recently troubled High Street retailer, Kingfisher. It has also invested
#2.7m in Boots and #1.3m in House of Fraser.
In the year to end-June, Murray Income raised net asset value by 9.4%
to 344p, while the All-Share index advanced 10.9%.
Perhaps more important to investors is the 6.2% increase in total
dividend to 12.0p, after a greater-than-expected final payout of 4.74p.
Murray Income received #14.9m of income from investments during the
year, a rise of 7.7%.
Believing that dividend growth in the UK stock market will continue to
be strong, Murray Income is forecasting a 10% increase in the total
payout for the year to end-June next year, to 13.2p.
While investing in general retailers, as well as other
consumer-dependent companies such as spirits giant Allied Domecq and
supermarket group Sainsbury, Murray Income has been selling cyclical
stocks.
Predicting that consumers, rather than manufacturing and exports, will
drive the continuing economic recovery next year, the trust has sold its
#1.2m stake in paper group Arjo Wiggins and its #1.6m holding in
electrical and electronic engineering group BICC. It has also been
running down its investment in ICI.
Trust manager Susan Boyd said: ''I think there is a good chance for
the feel-good factor to emerge in 1996. It is very likely that the
Government will wish to be re-elected and they will, therefore, go for
tax cuts.''
She believes the savings ratio, which has been increasing this year,
will decline next year as people begin to feel more secure in their
jobs.
Windfalls for savers and borrowers from mergers like the Halifax and
Leeds deal might also feed through to an increase in consumer spending.
Murray Income's largest single investment is the unlisted merchant
banking group Robert Fleming Holdings. The trust's stake, which was
bought for about #61,000 in the 1950s, is now worth about #30.5m.
The share of the portfolio invested in UK equities increased from 80%
to 87% during the year. The Americas account for 5.3% of the fund, with
European stocks comprising about 3%.
Murray Income considers that the prospects for UK equities remain
encouraging, in spite of the recent rise of the stock market.
During the year, gearing was reduced from 8.1% to nil.

<TEXT>
FORMER Tory Minister Neil Hamilton, and political lobbyist Ian Greer,
are pressing for ancient powers to be invoked which they claim would
allow a libel trial to be staged in Parliament.
They are hoping to spark a full-scale court case at Westminster in a
last-ditch attempt to pursue the Guardian newspaper over its reporting
of ''cash-for-questions'' allegations.
Their libel action against the newspaper was halted by the High Court
last Friday, when Mr Justice May ruled that parliamentary privilege
would prevent the newspaper defending itself fully.
Under the Bill of Rights of 1689, which entrenched parliamentary
privilege, debates, and proceedings of Parliament cannot be questioned
in the courts.
However, Mr Hamilton and Mr Greer have now written to Mr Peter
Preston, editor-in-chief of the Guardian, challenging him to defend the
libel action against the newspaper in a parliamentary trial.
They believe the High Court of Parliament has the right to hold a
full-scale trial with barristers cross-examining witnesses under oath.
In practice, it would be presided over by the powerful Committee of
Privileges.
Mr Andrew Smith, group managing director of Ian Greer Associates, said
there were historical precedents for such a trial.
''The same rules and regulations would apply as in a normal libel case
for an investigation by a parliamentary court,'' he said.
Yesterday, a Guardian spokeswoman said Mr Preston had received the
letter and would reply shortly.
Mr Hamilton quit his ministerial post last autumn to fight the libel
action over claims he had accepted money from Harrods owner Mohammed
Al-Fayed, through Mr Greer, to ask parliamentary questions.
Senior committee sources were unable to confirm a libel trial could be
heard in Parliament and one Westminster QC described it as ''almost
technically impossible''.
Mr David Alton, the Liberal Democrat MP on the committee, warned: ''A
procedure that is dragged up under some medieval piece of statute unused
for centuries is always going to be open to subsequent challenge.''

OFFICE products group Gestetner Holdings was close to being snapped up
by Ricoh yesterday as Gestetner's management reluctantly said it was
recommending the Japanese group's #179m bid.
Ricoh offered 89p for each Ordinary Gestetner share and 92p per
capital share, a class of stock with different dividend rights to the
standard shares.
Two months ago Gestetner saw over a third knocked off its share price
following a dire profit warning.

RACEGOERS can experience the thrill of instant ownership when a new
type of race, the Leasing Handicap, is introduced later this year.
The British Horseracing Board proposal will enable owners to lease
their horses to the course staging the event. The course will then
'sell' the horses to the highest bidder up to 45 minutes before the
race.
The horses will remain the possession of their new 'owners' until half
an hour after the event. The bidders will, in effect, 'own' the horse
for an hour and a quarter. All prize money, less the usual winning
percentages to trainer, jockey etc., will be collected by the lessee.
A second method available to the course is to sell the lease to a
single entity, such as the sponsor of the main race on the card. The
lessee could then distribute the horses to guests, or as competition
prizes.
One course likely to frame such a race in the autumn is Newmarket.
Clerk of the course Nick Lees said: ''It would need to take place on a
popular day, but it is an ideal way for a group of punters to get
together and bid for a horse that they would, perhaps, be interested in
backing.''
Lees feels that a bid of around #1500 would be enough to lease a
runner. Horses that fail to attract a bid will run on behalf of the
racecourse executive.

SCOTLAND v HOLLAND
SCOTLAND were unable to keep up with the Dutch yesterday and now need
to beat Denmark at Linlithgow to have any chance of winning the European
triangular tournament for ICC nations.
Holland cruised to an impressive 254 in the tournament opener at
Myreside, Edinburgh, then restricted George Salmond's slow-coaches to
just 209 for six in their 55 overs.
Barbados-born Nolan Clarke again got the Dutch off to a good start,
with a quickfire 22. But it was the fifth-wicket stand of 143 between
Marsel Schewe and Jan Van Noortwijk which paved the way for their 45-run
success.
Schewe looked destined for a well-deserved century until he became the
victim of a slick piece of stumping by Alec Davies off Scott Gourlay for
83.
Van Noortwijk had earlier spooned Greig Williamson to Salmond at cover
for 68.
Ali Zulfiqar stepped up the pace even further by blasting 14 --
including an enormous first-ball 6 -- off just five deliveries before
being clean-bowled by Williamson.
Scotland launched their assault on the target at a snail's pace and
never recovered.
Bruce Patterson was first out, for 11, when Dutch skipper Steve
Lubbers took a simple return catch with the total on 36.
Iain Philip and George Reifer took the score to 102 when the former
was trapped in front by Hans Boerstra for 67.
Salmond continued his own miserable run since taking the reins when he
was caught and bowled by former Hampshire star Paul-Jan Bakker for just
a single.
Big-hitter Williamson, who had to go for his shots immediately, was
pouched in the outfield off Bakker for 3, and any remaining hope of
victory disappeared when Reifer was lbw to Boerstra for 42.
Gourlay perished after an attractive 23, leaving Davies unbeaten on 45
at the end. Scores:
Holland 254-8 (M Schewe 83, J Van Nortwijk 68); Scotland 209-6 (I
Philip 67, A Davies 45no, G Reifer 42). Holland won by 45 runs.
* SCOTLAND Under-19s made 117 for four in their second innings to
salvage a draw with Wales at Abergavenny.

A SENIOR union official last night gave full support to
ScottishPower's proposed #1000m takeover of ManWeb.
Mr Pat O'Hanlon, executive council member of the AEEU in Scotland,
said he believed the merger was in the long-term best interests of union
members and customers both in Scotland and in Merseyside and North
Wales.
He said one of the most powerful reasons for supporting the take-over
was ScottishPower's positive record in employee and union relations,
against a background of industry rationalisation.
He said it had consistently shown an enlightened attitude towards such
matters as training and redeployment, and had dealt fairly with
redundancies.
''Equally important, ScottishPower must grow to continue creating new
jobs. This is a logical step in ScottishPower's future business strategy
as a multi-utility company,'' he said.
He added that ScottishPower was one of the few utility companies to be
able to operate profitable retail and electrical contracting businesses.
''We see no competition issues in the proposed takeover whatsoever and
believe our members both in Scotland and ManWeb will benefit from
ScottishPower's ability not only to improve customer services but also
to create jobs.''

PITY the heads of ICI's operating companies for they will not be
allowed to take a break after having achieved savings of almost #500m
through massive restructuring. Already group chief executive Charles
Miller Smith is breathing down their necks to achieve even more savings.
He is badgering them to lop another #400m from costs and the
underperformers have already put forward their ideas for improvements.
ICI expects to have a timetable on implementation in place by November,
for completion by the end of 1997.
No-one can accuse ICI of short-termism for it is planning its growth
path for the next decade and has clear ideas of where it expects to be
in 2005 -- one of the world's top chemicals companies.
All this is too long a timescale for the stock market to be bothered
with but ICI shares edged up 5p to 807p on first half figures ahead of
expectations.
Second-quarter profits more than doubled to #289m to give a figure for
the six months to June of #510m before exceptionals, up from #234m. The
interim dividend is raised by 1p to 11.5p.
The first round of restructuring was based mainly on reducing employee
numbers. There will be some additional job losses this time, though
numbers will be small in the UK, which accounts for only a fifth of the
overall business. But the emphasis will be on improving the group
operationally. Consultants have been brought in and ways to improve
efficiency have been found in many areas such as purchasing, the supply
chain and manufacturing processes.
The goal is to raise return on capital from the current 15% to 20%
over the course of the chemicals cycle, which is an ambitious target
given the nature of ICI's businesses. The group reckons it has nine core
activities, about two-thirds of turnover, which meet its requirements
for shareholder value. Others may be divested if they cannot fully earn
their keep. Acquisitions will be strictly within existing fields of
expertise.
Though UK dependence is down to just 20%, Mr Miller Smith thinks the
group is still too UK-oriented. He sees the home content down to 10%-12%
in 10 years time, with fast-growing Asia-Pacific markets accounting for
a third. North America will be a similar proportion and Europe,
including Britain, also 33[1/3]%. The greater international character
will be reflected in top management, which will include people from
America and Asia-Pacific.
In the short-term, however, ICI has to cope with a softening in
chemical prices. There is also the matter of the $400m damages award
against its subsidiary ICI Explosives USA by a Texas jury. The sum is
clearly ludicrously high and way in excess of the subsidiary's net
worth.
The case involves an alleged conspiracy with others to lower prices in
an attack on a competitor and now plaintiff, Thermex Energy, which went
bankrupt five years ago. The alleged events took place largely before
ICI bought the business. The damages have to be confirmed by a judge and
the hearing for this could come within days. Whatever happens ICI
intends to carry on fighting.
Bulk chemicals provided the powerhouse in the first half, with trading
profits up almost threefold from #109m to #298m on the back of firmer
prices and productivity gains. But markets are softening as economic
growth slows and petrochemical prices are easing back, though they
remain well above 1994 levels. But chemicals for plastics like polyester
and acrylics remain firm.
ICI pointed out that prices of many bulk chemicals remain in
Deutschmark terms well below previous peak levels. But this cannot
disguise the fact that the cycle has turned for industrial chemicals at
least so that second-half profits will not show anything as great a rise
as seen in the first six months.
The smaller divisions have not fared so well. Paints, which include UK
market leader Duluxe, saw profits down almost 10% at #47 as consumer
demand in key markets was depressed. The Asian region in contrast saw
12% growth in volume.
ICI has the widest geographical spread of paintmakers selling in the
region and its Indian operation will double its production capacity by
1997.
Paint remains very much a core activity and strategic acquisitions
have been made in the US.
Explosives is also difficult area, with market conditions in the US
difficult owing to price competition and raw material cost inflation.
South Africa was hit by unrest in the gold mines and Australia by
floods. Restructuring is under way with loss-making and redundant
facilities being closed. In the period 700 jobs went.
ICI is better placed than many chemicals groups in the short term but
doubts over prices mean that its shares, selling at around 12 times
prospective earnings, have no particularly attractions at present,
though they do carry a 4.6% yield.

BROTHERLY rivals Double Trigger and Double Eclipse fought out a
domestic duel yesterday that brought 20,000 racegoers to their feet at
Goodwood.
Fraternal love counted for nothing as the two stablemates battled
their hearts out in a thrilling scrap for the Tiffany Goodwood Cup. With
two furlongs to run they had the prize between them, but it was the year
older Double Trigger who dug the deeper to score by a neck.
Trainer Mark Johnston's only fear is that their head-to-head may leave
its mark with important races like the Irish St Leger, Doncaster Cup and
Melbourne Cup beckoning for Double Trigger and the St Leger for Double
Eclipse.
But he was doubly delighted that Trigger proved he could bridge the
gap back from two and a half miles to two miles after some unkind
speculation. ''Before the race everyone was asking me can he win at two
miles? He has never been beaten at two miles, what was all the fuss
about?''
Jason Weaver set out to dominate the race from the front, as in the
Ascot Gold Cup, but his pace was much steadier yesterday, and when the
pack loomed on his outside entering the straight, even he wondered if he
had gone quick enough.
''But you are riding a machine. I gave him a few smacks in the final
furlong, but nothing serious, as he was concentrating on the other horse
and was starting to race,'' he said.
''He walks round the paddock, ears pricked, loves it in front of the
crowd, fancies himself, drags you to the start and then is lazy in the
race. But maybe the penny has fully dropped now as he has gone out there
like a professional.''
One of the best bets of Glorious Goodwood could prove to be Yaa Wale
in today's Seeboard Handicap Stakes.
He showed fair promise as a juvenile and was sent off even money for
what looked a very ordinary maiden at Beverley. But Yaa Wale was never
travelling well and came home a well-beaten ninth of 10 behind Bolshoi.
It transpired that he had lost a shoe, and he may well have hurt
himself in the process, as he was then rested for three months before
winning a maiden handicap at Chepstow.
But it was when returning to the same course a week later that he made
a really big impression. Making all, Yaa Wale won without coming off the
bit and the two-length margin over Asterix at the line could have easily
been at least trebled.
At Edinburgh, Imperial Bid should not be missed in the opening race.
Trainer Denys Smith's tough old campaigner can follow up his victory at
Newcastle by defying top weight in the Old Course Stakes.
After Althaarth's decisive win on Wednesday, Mark of Esteem has the
look of banker material in the Europeasn Breeders Fun Foxhall Maiden.
Henry Cecil's colt was the only one to give Dick Hern's classic prospect
a race on his Newmarket debut, going down by a neck, the pair fourth
lengths clear.

SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric and its partner Norweb are seeking #50m
compensation from John Brown Engineering for a delay of up to one year
in completing their #250m Keadby power station on Humberside.
John Brown, a subsidiary of the Trafalgar House group, is disputing
the size of this claim.
But a souce at Trafalgar House said the final bill would be passed on
to General Electric in the United States, which, it is claimed, supplied
two faulty gas turbines for the 680 Megawatt plant.
The Keadby power station near Scunthorpe is a 50/50 joint venture
between Hydro-Electric and Norweb.
It was due to be commissioned in January, but Hydro-Electric chairman
Lord Wilson of Tillyhorn said yesterday that it might not begin
commercial production until late 1995 or early 1996 because of problems
with the turbines.
General Electric was forced to ship them back to the United States
earlier this year to correct a design fault. They have now been returned
to Keadby, where one of them is already undergoing trials.
Announcing the #50m compensation claim against John Brown Engineering,
Lord Wilson said there was ''bound to be an argument'' over the final
figure.
The source at Trafalgar House said John Brown disputed the size of the
claim. #50m represented the company's maximum possible liability under
the terms of its contract, he noted.
''There have been and there will be further discussions. #50m remains
as far as we are concerned a theoretical figure,'' the source said.
If the two sides fail to agree on a compensation figure the matter
will go to binding independent arbitration.
Speaking after Hydro-Electric's annual meeting in Aberdeen, Lord
Wilson said Hydro-Electric would continue expanding into England and
Wales.
This would be achieved by exporting more power from Scotland and
building more power stations south of the Border, not by trying to take
over a regional electricity company (REC).
''We do not have any plans in the immediate future to do anything like
bid for an English REC,'' Lord Wilson said.
By the end of the current financial year on March 31 1996,
Hydro-Electric would be selling 30% of its entire output south of the
Border, he predicted.
Lord Wilson predicted a consolidation of the power industry in England
and Wales, even if ScottishPower's #1000m bid for Manweb is referred to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC).
This would not deter other mergers from being proposed, he said.''The
whole economic logic is in that direction.''
Lord Wilson told the meeting in Aberdeen that the best way for
Hydro-Electric's to ward off potential predators was to run an efficient
company that kept its customers happy.
''We do not believe we are a tempting target for any predator because
we are running a pretty tight ship,'' the Hydro-Electric chairman said.
''There is little chance of any other company being able to run
Hydro-Electric any better.''
Hydro-Electric made a pre-tax profit of #168.7m on turnover of #833.1m
in 1994-95.
Lord Wilson said the current financial year had begun
''satisfactorily.'' The company had increased its market share in
Scotland, but there had been a slight drop in profits from its Scottish
operations.
Lord Wilson said he expected the Office of Electricity Regulation
(Offer) to accept the MMC's recommendations for alterations to pricing
and distribution controls at Hydro-Electric.

SCOTTISHPOWER said it bought more than a million more shares in Manweb
yesterday, increasing its stake in the Chester-based company to 12.5%.
ScottishPower has been buying Manweb shares steadily on the open
market since it launched a #1000m takeover bid for the Chester-based
company on Monday. It now owns 13.43 million Manweb shares. Manweb
closed down 12p at 897p, well below ScottishPower's cash bid of 915p.
ScottishPower has also offered a cash-plus-shares deal worth 952p per
Manweb share at yesterday's closing prices.

THE seven-strong Scottish team have their sights set on records over
the next four days of the Canadian National Championships in Winnipeg.
''These championships are a chance to show that performances are
improving,'' said national coach Jim Park. ''We had a very positive
training camp in France at the start of this month and I'm certain a few
records will fall this week.''
Alison Sheppard and Tom Griffith both have their eyes on the Scottish
50 metres free-style record, while Richard Hope is confident he can
break one of the oldest records in the book, the 200m back-stroke. The
current mark was set by Dougie Campbell in the 1980 Olympic Games final
in Moscow.
For Arbroath's Cameron Black, the Scottish debut will be a pointer to
his Olympic ambitions. The 17-year-old made his breakthrough by winning
two butterfly titles at last month's Scottish championships. He is also
looking to break a Scottish record, in the 100m butterfly or 50m
free-style.
Kirsty Hope, Richard's younger sister, Forbes Dunlop and Pauline
McLean complete the line-up.
Park remains cautious. ''I'm certainly not going to make wild
predictions that we are going to win a host of medals,'' he said. ''It
is more important to look at our own performances and hope that everyone
produces some personal-best times. I'll be looking for the team to make
finals, and then medals will be a bonus.''

THE procedures used for appointing senior staff in four new Scottish
councils have been criticised by the Staff Commission in a report
published yesterday.
New and detailed formal advice on appointments, which can be enforced
by the Scottish Secretary, were approved by the commission when it met
in Edinburgh.
They are designed to put an end to the ''jobs for the boys'' row which
has surrounded the way some top staff for unitary authorities have been
chosen.
The councils being criticised are the City of Edinburgh, the City of
Dundee, Dumfries and Galloway, and Dumbarton and Clydebank.
The new guidelines, for example, will forbid councillors, who have
stood as referees for an applicant, serving on the appointments
committee.
It will also be made clear by the commission that appointments should
not be made without interviews.
The guidelines will also cover the case of Dumbarton and Clydebank,
which appointed a depute chief executive from the same field of
applicants that they had seen for the chief executive post.
Although the council acted on the advice it received, this will be
deemed unacceptable in the case of future appointments.
Scottish Local Government Minister George Kynoch said he regretted the
need for the new guidelines but trusted councils would respect them
immediately.
''The vast majority of appointments to the new councils have caused no
problems but this report shows that four councils are required to
improve procedures.
''I believe it is very important for the reputation of local
government that appointments to the new authorities are not only fair
but are seen to be fair.''
Meanwhile, the Labour Party has written to all new council leaders
urging them to ensure that political opponents are given no ammunition
over the way appointments are handled.
0  Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ''While the vast
majority of councils have complied with the existing guidelines, it is
still vitally important that the new shadow authorities enjoy the full
confidence of the public and that appointments are made strictly
according to merit.''
Staff commission chairman, Mr Robert Peggie, said that in some
instances the commission's confidence that appointments would be made
according to fair and proper procedures had been misplaced.
Accordingly, they had no alternative but to issue detailed formal
advice to set out standard procedures.

NORTH Sea oil output fell to its lowest level for two years in June,
as major fields were shut down for routine maintenance work against a
backdrop of sliding prices.
With 17 fields recording production falls of more than 10,000 barrels
per day, oil output fell through the two million-bpd level for the first
time since June 1993.
During June, the average price of Brent Crude was 6% lower than the
previous month, at $17.29.
Figures released by Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday reveal that oil
production tumbled 19% during June to average 1.95 million bpd. It was
also well down on June last year, when output averaged 2.46 million bpd.
Concern that Opec might increase its quota when it meets in November,
to hit back at North Sea producers who are reaping the benefits of the
cartel's self-imposed restraint, is one of the factors dogging prices.
This month, the price of Brent Crude continued to slide, touching a
new year-low of about $15.50, although it has recovered slightly in
recent days and is currently trading around $16.
Although June oil production was surprisingly weak, Royal Bank energy
economist Mark Shea believes this year's average daily oil production
will still exceed last year's 2.5 million-bpd level.
A 19% decline in gas output, which averaged slightly more than 4700
million cubic feet per day, was less surprising.
Gas production always slows at this time of year because of weaker
demand for heating in warm weather. Although daily gas revenues touched
their lowest point this year, averaging slightly more than #8.5m, they
were more than 11% higher than a year earlier.
The Royal Bank of Scotland Oil and Gas Index, which measures total
output, fell from 152.4 in May to 124.0 in June, its lowest level since
August 1993.
Combined daily oil and gas revenues fell 22% during June, averaging
#29.7m, their lowest level since September 1993.
The biggest fall in oil production came at Elf Enterprise's Piper
field, where output was down 75,000 bpd or 78% month-on-month. There
were also major declines at BP's Miller, Amerada Hess's Scott, and
Shell's Brent fields, which between them accounted for a fall of 144,000
bpd.
Oil throughput at the Cruden Bay terminal fell by more than 190,000
bpd (24%), with Flotta losing nearly 124,000 bpd (55%).
Looking ahead, there could be some short-term upside in the oil price
but in the medium term, with Opec casting a shadow, it is likely to be
fairly flat at a slightly higher level of about $17.
Mr Shea said: ''I would expect prices to pick up a bit but not a lot.
I think there are too many worrying factors out there.''
Opec continues to exceed its self-imposed, 24.5 million-bpd production
ceiling.
Retired Opec secretary-general Subroto was recently reported to have
said that the Opec ceiling would be raised at the November meeting.
* OIL prices advanced further yesterday, building on a sharp rally the
previous day ignited by improved US demand.
North Sea Brent crude was 16 cents up at $16.27 a barrel on the London
futures market.
Traders said the market still had potential to move higher. ''It's got
a bit more juice in it yet,'' one London-based dealer said.

ENGLAND'S World Cup squad and Twickenham officials are keeping their
negotiations about future earnings for players a closely guarded secret.
Senior players met Malcolm Phillips, chairman of the recently-formed
committee designed to increase players' off-field income, in London
yesterday. Afterwards, Phillips issued a statement which did not confirm
whether the issue of the Australian professional circus had been
debated.
The statement read: ''The players' working party, representing the
Rugby Football Union and the national squad, have held further talks on
updating and progressing co-operation between them.
''Various matters are under active review and consideration.''
* SCOTLAND'S World Cup heroes will swap rucking for putting at the
weekend.
Most of the squad who starred in South Africa are lined up to play in
the SRU's Celebrity Golf Day at Dalmahoy on Sunday. Newly retired
skipper Gavin Hastings, who has admitted that one of his ambitions is to
play in the Open Championship, tees off shortly after one o'clock. Entry
is free.

SCOTLAND's rowing team travel to Ireland today to take part in this
year's four-nation Home International match, which returns to Cork
tomorrow after an absence of over 20 years.
In the men's team, the strength lies in small boats, with Aberdeen's
Richard Harris and Drew Hendry, who were just pipped on the line for
gold at the British Championships a fortnight ago, looking the most
likely winners.
Stirling's Kevin Plank is the selection in lightweight single sculls,
while former Diamond Sculls winner Rory Henderson makes a welcome return
to Scottish colours in the open sculls event.
Two Commonwealth bronze medalists, Fiona Freckleton and Claire
MacDougall Smith, take up the sculling slots in the women's team, while
the pair of Alona Bruce and Nicola Robinson, who are also Commonwealth
bronze medalists, return to Scottish colours direct from last week's
final of the world under-23 championships in Holland.
Nithsdale, from Dumfries, are well to the fore in the junior match,
providing personnel for the eights and fours in both the men's and
women's categories, while Stirling's Jennifer McNee looks like
Scotland's best hope for junior victory in single sculls.

NEW ENGLAND CLASSIC
VETERAN George Burns, back at the scene of one of his four US Tour
victories, was as surprised as anybody yesterday to find himself joint
leader after his opening round at the New England Classic.
''It was a big, big surprise,'' Burns said after shooting a
five-under-par 66 on the Pleasant Valley course, a score matched by
fellow Americans Ken Green, Jim McGovern, Jim Carter, Mark Wurtz and P H
Horgan with half the field back in the clubhouse.
Burns, 46 tomorrow, has struggled since he severed a tendon in his
left hand in 1991. Despite undergoing successful surgery, he still does
not have a full range of motion.
''I can't get my hand totally around the club,'' he said, explaining
that he could not feel the club in his hand as well as he used to. ''I
haven't made a cut on the main Tour since 1992. I'm not even making cuts
on the Nike Tour. That's hard to take.'' Leading early scores (American
unless otherwise stated):
66 -- K Green, J McGovern, J Carter, G Burns, M Wurtz, P H Horgan.
67 -- D Martin, J Adams, L Clements, H Twitty, R Fehr, T Byrum, J
Williamson.
Other scores included: 68 -- M Calcavecchia. 70 -- P Jacobsen. 71 -- P
Azinger.

THE POUND slipped against the dollar in early trading but finally
closed slightly ahead at 1.5968 against the overnight level of 1.5958
while against the German mark it was down eight-tenths of pfennig to
2.2063. Its trade weighted index against the major trading currencies
was unchanged at 83.4.
The Treasury's monthly monetary report emphasised that the economy was
ticking over at a ''healthy, sustainable rate'' and also cited this
week's Industrial Trends survey findings that domestic price pressures
are receding.
So any possibility of an interest increase has receded even further
with Chancellor Kenneth Clarke able, so far, to outgun Governor of the
Bank of England Eddie George on economic data.
At their monthly meeting yesterday it is widely felt that the two
would have continued their disagreement over rates.

LENNOX Lewis could get a shot at bitter rival Riddick Bowe as World
Boxing Organisation officials try to schedule future fights.
Bowe will be giving up the WBO heavyweight championship before his
November 4 decider against Evander Holyfield at Caesars Palace in Las
Vegas because, as his outspoken manager, Rock Newman, insisted: ''This
fight transcends any title.''
And with Bowe on the verge of giving up the crown he won from Herbie
Hide in March, the WBO could offer Lewis, their No.1 challenger, and
Tommy Morrison (No.2) the chance to make their Atlantic City clash on
October 7 a fight for the vacant title.
Lewis's manager, Frank Maloney, said: ''It's a situation we would look
at,'' but it is a response which does not confidently suggest that the
former WBC champion is raring to campaign for another belt discarded by
the man he beat in the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
The Bowe-Holyfield fight and Lewis-Morrison meeting are counter
heavyweight contests backed by the finance of America's big cable
network Home Box Office, now that major rivals Showtime have Mike Tyson
and WBC and WBA heavyweight champions Oliver McCall and Bruce Seldon
under their wing.
But for all their appeal this latest series of fights, designed to
bring the two winners together, can only further confuse an already
fragmented heavyweight scene.
Holyfield lost his undisputed crowns to Bowe in a marvellous fight in
Las Vegas, but won the return, which is still Bowe's only professional
defeat.
* WBO welterweight champion Eamonn Loughran has been told that he
faces no AIDS risk from his title bout with South African challenger
Luvuyo Kakaza in Belfast on August 5.
Loughran had said he was concerned about recent reports that 34
professional boxers in South Africa had tested positive for HIV during
1994.
But Peter Ngatane, who sits on the South African Boxing Control
Commission's medical panel, said: ''The Loughran camp would be well
advised to take heed that he (Kakaza) has been given medical clearance
for this fight.''

<HEADLINE>Euro-sceptics set Blackpool ambush</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977174713</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE Euro-sceptics are mounting a campaign to seize the policy
agenda at the Tory Party conference at Blackpool in October by flooding
organisers with debating motions hostile to Brussels.
The party's central office yesterday acknowledged there appeared to be
a concerted effort by the right to hijack the potentially damaging
Europe debate.
It confirmed that of 136 resolutions submitted for the debate on
foreign affairs and Europe, all but six concern the EU -- and most are
hostile.
More worrying for party chiefs is that a number of the resolutions are
identical, prompting fears that the Euro-sceptics in the party are
engaged in an organised campaign in the constituencies.
Such a campaign could derail plans for a ''unity'' conference
following Prime Minister John Major's leadership election victory, and
split the party from top to bottom again at a crucial time in the
political calendar.
A central office spokeswoman said full details of the resolutions
would be published as usual in September.
However, she added: ''A number of the motions are worded in the same
way and it would seem to suggest some sort of organised campaign.''
Tory Euro-MPs have been warned in a circular from Mr Tim Bainbridge,
head of the London office of the affiliated European People's Party
group, that there was a growing anti-Europe mood within the party.
The circular, leaked to a London magazine, said: ''The great majority
of these resolutions . . . express disapproval of some aspect of the
European Union, such as the single currency, the role of the Court of
Justice, and the federalist super-state.
''It is already clear that a determined effort will be made to ensure
that the mood of the conference is broadly hostile towards Europe.''
Many of the motions are reported to call for a referendum and for the
repatriation of powers from Brussels -- a key demand of the Euro-sceptic
right.
Though in practice, conference organisers can avoid a debate on a
strongly anti-Europe resolution by picking a neutral motion, they are
not able to stop a series of speakers playing to a largely Euro-sceptic
conference.

GRAEME Obree has been given his passport to the world championships in
high-altitude Colombia in September -- win the British pursuit title on
Tuesday and you are on the plane.
It's a great boost for the Scot, who is delighted to be back home
after a successful racing double-header in the southern hemisphere.
''It's good news,'' said Graeme, who won gold and silver at World Cup
track meetings in Adelaide and Tokyo. ''I have been working hard all
season at improving my times and I feel I am on the right track. The
Tokyo race was a disappointment, but these things happen, there's no
point looking back.''
Team manager Doug Dailey said: ''I'm sure Obree will demonstrate in
the British championships at Manchester that he's in a different class
from anyone else in the pursuit.''
One other factor has been the condition of Chris Boardman, who was
badly injured in the opening time trial of the Tour de France.
''We're looking at three weeks before he puts weight on his leg and
five more weeks before he can think of getting back on the bike,'' added
Dailey.
Meanwhile, Sara Phillips, from Aberdeen, will be Scotland's first
competitor in the Tour Feminin, the women's version of the Tour de
France, which starts on Sunday. Sara, of the Deeside Thistle club, is
one of our top all-round riders and recently won the British 25-mile
time trial championship.

TOMMI Makinen, driving a Mitsubishi Lancer, held an eight-second lead
in the Rally of New Zealand at the end of yesterday's opening leg.
The 31-year-old Finn was able to wring maximum performance from his
300hp, four-wheel-drive car after higher-seeded drivers swept away the
gravel chips which littered each of the six timed stages.
Overseeing Mitsubishi's bid to maintain their five-point lead over
Toyota in the Manufacturers' World Championship is team manager Andrew
Cowan from Berwickshire.
Germany's Armin Schwarz and Frenchman Didier Auriol, both driving
Toyota Celicas, are second and third, separated by three seconds after
74 kilometres of competitive driving. In equal third place is Sweden's
Kenneth Eriksson, Makinen's team-mate.
Scotland's Colin McRae and Finland's Juha Kankkunen, navigated by
Welshman Nicky Grist, are equal fifth, 14 seconds behind Makinen.
McRae and co-driver Derek Ringer, chasing a hat trick of wins, were
hampered by the gravel top coating which left their Subaru Impreza
scrabbling for grip.
''I've been the first car on all of today's stages -- it felt like I
was sweeping the gravel from the tracks for the cars behind,'' said
McRae. ''Tomorrow I start sixth car on the road; the other drivers can
be the road sweepers.''
McRae's 24-year-old team mate, Richard Burns, deputising for the
injured Carlos Sainz, arrived in Auckland in eighth place. The Reading
driver, navigated by Robert Reid from Spittal, near Perth, was relieved
to complete the first leg after crashing out of last year's rally.
Today was not a day for heroics. I'm happy to be just 21 seconds
behind the leader,'' said Burns.Leading positions after six stages:
1, T Makinen (Finland) Mitsubishi Lancer, 42min 31sec; 2, A Schwarz

MARK Petchey took just one hour to cruise into the quarter-finals of
the Northern Electric Open in Newcastle yesterday and line up a meeting
with Davis Cup team-mate Tim Henman.
The 24-year-old from Essex produced a great show of serving to beat
Australian Peter Tramacci in straight sets, while Henman broke South
African Chris Haggard's serve three times on his way to a 6-3, 6-4
victory.
In-form Petchey, who reached the semi-finals of the ATP Challenger in
Manchester last week, now expects a tough encounter with his fellow
Briton. ''Tim's a tough player and it will be a real battle,'' he said.
''It's great that the British players are doing well and it means that
one of us will be in the semi-finals -- hopefully it will be me.''
Petchey, the world No.127, is now favourite to win after the surprise
exist of No.1 seed Henrik Holm.
Henman was also looking forward to the all-British clash. ''It should
be a good game with Mark,'' said the 20-year-old from Oxford. ''We
practised together but we've never played a competitive match.''
* WIMBLEDON champion Pete Sampras and defending champion Andre Agassi
both encountered problems before making progress to the third round of
the Canadian Open in Montreal.
Second seed Sampras eventually fought off tenacious fellow American
Jonathan Stark 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, and in the midst of another all-American
clash, Agassi had to endure a two-hour rain delay against Wimbledon bad
boy Jeff Tarango before finally scoring a 6-3, 6-4 victory.
In a battle between two Swedes, Mats Wilander defeated Stefan Edberg
3-6, 6-3, 6-4. Edberg, a finalist last week in Washington, has been
nursing a shoulder injury he sustained at Wimbledon.
Wilander said that Edberg's serve no longer threatened players as it
did when he was world No.1 and won six grand slam titles.
''His serve used to have a big kick and be very deep,'' said
Wilander,''but now the players see his kind of serve every night.''

GOLF: DUTCH OPEN
A BURNING desire for a Ryder Cup place is driving Philip Walton as
much as new Open champion John Daly this year -- and the Irishman
responded yesterday with a 65 to share the first-round lead in the
Heineken Dutch Open at Hilversum.
Both players know they still have to convince their respective
captains, Bernard Gallacher and Lanny Wadkins, before they can claim a
berth in September's showdown between Europe and America at Oak Hill.
Daly is surprisingly waiting to hear from America skipper Wadkins,
despite his victory at St Andrews on Sunday.
Walton, meanwhile, is right on the borderline in tenth place in the
European cup standings, but a couple of good tournaments will set him up
for a ticket to Rochester, New York.
Daly shot a 72 and was left in the shade by his playing partner, Colin
Montgomerie, who posted a 67.
Walton, who is tied with American Scott Hoch after chalking up eight
birdies and two bogeys, said: ''I'm just making up the numbers. There
are some class players here this week. It's nice to be on a course where
you have to manoeuvre the ball.
''There are a lot of guys crying for the Ryder Cup. I'm trying as well
and playing right through to the last qualifying event (the German
Open). So I'm trying to get plenty of rest and early nights. It is
important to sleep a lot. I can sleep standing up.''
Montgomerie left Daly standing with a blistering start, including four
birdies in the front nine, to go out in 32. But he dropped shots at the
eleventh and thirteenth, only to retrieve the situation at the short
fifteenth, where his No.9-iron shot finished four feet from the pin.
He ended his round birdie, bogey, birdie and put his good score down
to returning to a putter he used to win his first tournament, the 1989
Portugese Open.
He said: ''I studied the video to see how I putted then. Only 28 putts
today -- 38 was the order of the day last week.''
Fellow Scot Sam Torrance continued his good form with a 68 and Ross
Drummond opened with a 69, but it was not such a good day for another
Scot, Gary Orr, who was round in 79.
Daly was satisfied with his 72. ''I hung in there and it could have
been a lot worse,'' he admitted. ''I am still in a good situation.''
He revealed he has already spent part of his winnings from the Open --
splashing out #90,000 on a new Mercedes.
While he is still basking in the glory, Hoch is happy to be in Holland
and away from the Open. He said: ''I am glad I got off that shift. It is
not a lot of fun playing in 50mph winds and I would rather play this
course any day.''
One shot behind Walton and Hoch on 66 come a group of four players --
Alexander Cejka, Thomas Levet, Terry Price and Vijay Singh.
Steven Bottomley, who came a surprise third behind Daly at St Andrews,
finished on the same mark as the American champion with a one-over-par
72.
Probably the most dramatic comeback of the day was achieved by Dutch
amateur Alain Ruiz-Fonhof. He came home in 34 after going out in 50
following a 10 at the sixth. Leading scores (British and Irish unless
otherwise stated. * denotes amateur):

SCOTTISH UNDER-25s
NIGEL Scott-Smith secured only the second victory of his four-year
professional career in the Scottish Under-25 championship at Westerwood
yesterday, when a one-under-par final round of 72 left him six strokes
clear of nearest challenger Stewart Russell.
Scott-Smith transformed Russell's five-stroke overnight lead into a
five-stroke cushion of his own in the third round with a seven-under-par
66.
The 21-year-old from Dullatur carded eight birdies in calm conditions,
and yesterday's victory follows up on his maiden win in the paid ranks
last week in an assistant's pro-am at Cawder.
Leading aggregates:

Motor traders and drivers love the August new-car rush but, writes
Kirsty Scott, it can create havoc for some
ANALYSTS looking for a state-of-the-economy indicator this summer
could do worse than sit by the roadside next Tuesday and count the
number of new N-reg vehicles sweeping past.
Traditionally, the August new-car sales have given a pretty solid idea
of the average citizen's financial well-being, real or perceived. This
summer, say motor trade representatives, sales are steady rather than
rising, and there are cautious signs of optimism in some parts of
Scotland.
For the motor trade itself, the onset of August is a mixed blessing.
Most manufacturers make 25% of their annual sales in the four weeks
alone, but it means a major headache for manufacturers and dealers
trying to prepare and sell large numbers of cars in such a short space
of time.
In the heady, cash-choked years of the late eighties when dealers
threw champagne parties at midnight, more than 500,000 new cars could be
shifted in a single month, but the recession brought in the chill wind
of caution and sales plummeted, particularly in the south-east.
The UK suffered a lot more than Scotland,'' said David Clark,
secretary of the Scottish Motor Trade Association. ''I think now we are
beginning to be slightly more confident, but in the lean years of the
trade we never suffered as much as England suffered. The trade in new
cars is very much like the trade in houses. If people don't feel so
flush, if they're feeling a bit threatened in their job or a bit
insecure they won't change their house or their car.''
In 1993, Scotland sold 140,878 new cars, compared to 138,291 in 1994.
That downward trend continued until May of this year when the figures
started to pick up a little. By last month, sales were standing at 8656
compared to 8226 the previous June.
''Scottish sales are looking not tremendously better but definitely
looking better,'' said Clark. ''I would be looking for Scotland to
achieve about 42,000 sales in August. That would be a very good figure,
it would be up about 2000 or 3000 on last year's figure, and a good
percentage rise would give the trade a fillip.
''Advance orders look to be better than last year but not
staggering.''
At the Prosser and Sons Rover Dealership in Glasgow's Royston Road,
sales executive Gordon Whitelaw has advance orders for 66 new N-reg cars
on Tuesday and expects to shift about 75 on the day.
''It's probably not going to be the best year. Two years ago it was
probably not too bad but last year was slightly better than this year.
We will probably sell between 120 and 130 cars in the month compared to
last year when we did between 140 and 150.
''There does seem to be a lack of confidence at the moment. Everyone
is just a bit insecure and they are not willing to buy a car.''
At the Renault headquarters in Swindon, spokesman Graeme Holt said in
the UK as a whole the trade was still pretty stagnant and there weren't
any great hopes for a bullish August.
''If you add up at the beginning of the year what everyone says they
are going to achieve you would have about 110%, but this year is pretty
static. Last year was the first year that the figures for August fell
short of what the industry was expecting.''
Renault is expecting to sell 32,000 cars in August alone and, like the
other manufacturers, has a variety of deals on offer to tempt wavering
buyers. Incentives this year include special editions at basic prices
and a series of financing options and free insurance schemes.
Most dealers say private customers are looking for smaller, more
economical models these days and competitive financing deals. Leasing
deals are gaining ground, but are nowhere near as popular as straight
financing for the private buyer.
For dealers, this Tuesday can be utter chaos, but while some showrooms
will open at midnight, most admit some of the razzmatazz has gone out of
the experience.
''We'll just try to get through the day without a hitch,'' said
Whitelaw.
David Clark admits some people find the midnight deadline a little
naff, but points out that Scots tend to go bigger on the number plate
business than the rest of the UK.
''There is still a bit of that razzmattazz attached to August first in
Scotland but it's not as popular now. Snobbish? Yes, certainly there is
that but if it's going to sell cars for our members then I welcome
that.''
Whatever the outcome of the August sales rush, there will clearly be
no let-up in the frustration at the inconvenience it causes the trade.
The new registration prefix system was first introduced in the UK in
1963 and for the next three years it operated on January 1. In 1967 the
date changed to August 1. In the past few years calls for the system to
be changed have gathered pace.
''Our point is that something in the region of 25% of all
registrations now take place in August,'' said Cathy Treble, of the
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. ''That is totally
inefficient and disruptive in terms of what the industry is now trying
to do with lean distribution, lean production and much more efficient
and profitable ways of producing and distirbuting vehicles.
''Such a large percentage of registrations in just one month is really
bad in terms of the cost to dealers and manufacturers. It's not an
efficient way of doing things. We are trying to develop a different
system which would not lead to this sort of bunching of registrations.''
Some of the new schemes being considered include the Swiss system of
linking the license plate to the driver, not to the car, or the French
and German system of regional plates.
Graeme Holt of Renault said the UK system will probably stay in place
for several more years but is a major headache for manufacturers and
their dealerships.
''There has been a lot of talk about whether the market would contract
if we did away with the new registration plate and it is true that there
are quite a lot of people who do impulse-buy cars in August.
''It does encourage people to buy cars, but, on the other hand, I'm
sure manufacturers would like to see some sort of change in the system
so they don't have to stockpile so many cars and put so much pressure on
the dealerships. They are trying to service and inspect 25% of their
annual volume in a couple of weeks.''
But if the temptation of a shiny new N-Reg plate proves too much,
customers should wait a couple of weeks to let the rush die down and the
sales personnel to get back on their feet, he said.
''It you are determined to get an August car then I would advise you
to wait until the end of the month because you will get better service
-- definitely.''
REGISTRATION SYSTEMS
UK: New registration prefix issued on August 1.
Switzerland: Motorists pay tax on plate which stays with owner, not
car.
Germany and France: Number plates carry local area recognition and a
sticker to show licence has been paid.
USA: Anything goes, as long as plate is unique.
* SUGGESTED OPTIONS
1. Retain the annual prefix change but vary the month of issue each
year.
2. Keep the prefix until all letter/number combinations are used up.
3. Copy Swiss system of keeping plate with driver rather than with
car.
4. Copy France and Germany with regional numbering system.

Buying new freedom
* DUNCAN Fotheringham (left) will pick up his new Rover 100 Kensington
on August 1, but he won't be rushing to be first out of the showroom.
The 48-year-old from Glasgow has had one new-reg car several years
ago, and decided to buy the ''N'' when his previous Rover Metro was
stolen in November.
''I had left it for a while due to financial circumstances but I
really wanted the freedom of having a car. I just thought why not go for
it now and get the new registration into the bargain, so I put it off
until August to get the new number.
''That was definitely a feature of it for me. I think it's nice to
look forward to treating yourself to a new car and having the first
registration of the year. I haven't yet been given a specific time to
come in but, no, I won't be there first. I won't go to those lengths.''
Despite concern in the trade that it's more trouble than it's worth,
Mr Fotheringham thinks the August sales day should be kept. ''I think it
is a good idea to boost their sales.''

IRISH OPEN:
LAURA Davies recaptured her best form yesterday, when she fashioned a
six-under-par 67 in a determined bid to retain her Guardian Irish
Holidays Open title at St Margaret's in Dublin.
It left the world No.1 sharing the lead with American Jill McGill and
Emma-Jane Smith from Essex, with Lora Fairclough one stroke further
behind.
It was also a good day for the Scottish contingent with Gillian
Stewart shooting a 69 and Myra McKinlay and Julie Forbes on 70.
Davies started her run with three birdies in four holes from the long
eighth (451 yards), which she reduced to a drive and a No.7 iron.
She then launched a 325-yard drive to the edge of the green for a
birdie at the ninth, and holed from 15 feet for birdies at the eleventh
and fourteenth as an aperitif for 4s at the long sixteenth and
seventeenth holes.
McGill, winner of the US amateur title in 1993 and runner-up the
following year, also made a late move. After dropping her only shot of
the day at the thirteenth she then birdied three of her next four holes.
Smith, who failed to earn her card at the qualifying school last
March, put her best ever round down to the experience of playing on the
Challenge Tour. Her longest putt of the day, from 30 feet for an eagle
at the seventeenth, brought her home in 31 .
Stewart never exceeded par in her 69, finishing with three birdies in
her closing five holes.
McKinlay had been five under after 11 holes only to drive into water
for a costly double-bogey 6 at the next hole before reeling off
regulation figures over the remaining holes.
Forbes was out in 33 and still four under with three to play, but
missed the green at the last to run up a bogey 5. Leading scores:
67 -- L Davies, J McGill (USA), E-J Smith.
68 -- L Fairclough.
69 -- L Percival, A Gottmo (Sweden), C Sorenstam (Sweden), G Stewart,
F Dassu (Italy).
70 -- J Furby, P Meunier (France), M Koch (Germany), S Waugh
(Australia), H Wadsworth, M McKinlay, L Navarro (Spain), J Forbes, L
Hackney.
71 -- C Dibnah (Australia), X Wunsch (Spain), S Moon (USA), S
Gustafson (Sweden), I Maconi (Italy), D Dowling, S Studwick, K Orum
(Denmark), M Madill, T Johnson, M Hageman (Holland).
72 -- E Orley (Switzerland), S Prosser, P Grice-Whittaker.
Other Scottish scores: 74 -- D Reid. 75 -- T Craik. 81 -- J Kinloch.
* A STYLISH round of 71 gave Sheena Wood a whopping 11-stroke victory
in the Aberdeenshire Ladies' Meeting at Royal Aberdeen yesterday.
Leading scores:
Silver. Scratch: 71 -- S Wood (Aberdeen Ladies). 82 -- J Lees
(Westhill). 84 -- J McNaughton (Aberdeen Ladies). 85 -- P Twinn
(Aberdeen Ladies). Handicap: 74 -- S Charles (Deeside, 13). 78 -- S Bain

Ladies, 10). 79 -- C Miller (Aberdeen Ladies, 9), C Hodge (Aberdeen
Ladies, 7).
Bronze. Scratch: 80 -- A Harper (Westhill). 83 -- C Stewart (Murcar).
85 -- M Anderson (Murcar). Handicap: 59 -- N Milne (Westhill, 29). 61 --
V McPherson (Aberdeen Ladies, 28), M Smith (Hazlehead, 23). 63 -- F
Riley (Westhill, 28).

SENIOR BRITISH OPEN
BRIAN Barnes made the perfect start to his European seniors debut
yesterday with an opening five-under-par 67 in the Senior British Open
at Royal Portrush.
Barnes took just 29 putts in a seven-birdie round that included a
superb four-under-par 32 run home and left him a stroke ahead of the
field.
His performance delighted father-in-law Max Faulkner, who was visiting
the famous Dunluce links 44 years after winning the Open title there.
''If I putt like that for the rest of the week, I might even beat Max's
record 109 putts in his Open win,'' joked Barnes.
Two Murphys, unrelated, share second place on 68 -- Michael Murphy, a
61-year-old Dubliner, and Bob Murphy, a major money winner on the US
seniors tour.
John Jacobs, a regular on the European circuit, and former US Seniors
Open champion Larry Laoretti, both from America, were a shot further
back on 69. Former champion Bob Charles shot a 70, and Scot David Huish
a 71.
The biggest gallery of the day was reserved for a classic threesome
involving Ireland's Christy O'Connor, Arnold Palmer and English veteran
Neil Coles. Palmer kept in touch with a 71, while Coles carded a 72 and
O'Connor a 74.

* THE FIRST N-reg will slip off the courtyard of Ian Skelly's
Rutherglen dealership at 7am on Tuesday; the last, sometime after 9pm.
''On the day we'll probably move between 150 and 170 cars,'' said
sales executive Allan McFarlane. ''Basically it's just one long day.
We're well-organised. You have to be with these numbers.
''There are some people who are desperate to be the first on the road
. . . but it would just be a nightmare if everybody came at once, so we
allocate them time slots. We'll be laying on a running buffet all day
and when people come in they get well-looked after.''
The first customers put their orders for the new registration in as
early as May, although there are some die-hards who go for a new model
every year. The most popular models this year are the VW Polo and Golf
and the Audi A4.
The dealership doesn't go in for midnight opening for the simple fact
that it would be difficult to spot any faults.
''We want people to see their new car all bright and shiny. If you did
it under cover of darkness or arc lights you couldn't actually
physically check over the car.''
Despite the 14-hour day, the sales personnel will be back at their
posts on Wednesday. ''When it comes to the end of August we'll probably
put our feet up for a couple of days and go whew! But it's nice to have
a real buzz of customers, better than the really quiet months where you
have time on your hands.''

JAMES FREEMAN looks at BBC Scotland's series about a gamekeeper's life
and questions whether all the facts are addressed
A SURVEY of the high tops, by gamekeeper Charlie Pirie and his team of
assistants, quickly establishes that their spring expectations are
reduced to tatters. There are precious few young grouse around. In the
bothy the talk is of a gloomy future.
What is Charlie Pirie's reaction? The foxes, which he knows are holed
up in a particular high rocky cairn, must go.
Viewers to BBC Scotland's new series, The Gamekeeper, a year in the
life of Charlie Pirie, headkeeper to the Duke of Argyll in Glen Tilt,
Perthshire, will then be treated to the unusual spectacle of a daytime
stalk of the fox by two gamekeepers. In keeping with modern country
practice, they maintain a radio link as they mount a pincer movement.
The fox bolts after a couple of shots from a stalking rifle are rattled
into her rocks, and is duly brought down by Pirie. A brilliant running
shot.
''It hovers up the young grouse,'' declares Pirie. The land is well
rid of her. A professional killer, he says, then, stroking her head,
adds that she is a beautiful animal.
This episode aptly illustrates the paradox at the heart of the series,
which starts on Friday night. Pirie and his cohorts, when not strutting
their stuff attired in the full tourist panoply of the Athol Highlanders
(the Duke's private army), police the beautiful hills of the Glen Tilt
estate, preparing the ground for the ritual slaughter of the grouse and
the deer by the paying guests from England, Germany, Austria, and Italy.
So that the grouse may survive, the vixen must die and her cubs
starve. We have to make a harvest of the grouse, Mr Pirie tells the
camera. This is all interspersed by beautiful shots of moths, mountain
flowers, roaring waterfalls, the dipper bobbing on a stone in the
stream, and yes, a soaring eagle.
At this level, pure and non-critical, Scotland is easy on the eye,
every frame a heart-warming delight.
But what of the soaring eagle? How many pairs nest in beautiful Glen
Tilt? How many hen harriers? How many pairs of buzzards, peregrines,
sparrow hawks -- all of which, as we all know, will take grouse if the
opportunity arises. Will future episodes explore this vexed area?
Will questions be asked in beautiful Glen Tilt of why so many Highland
estates are little more than graveyards for threatened species and why
so many of the dead buzzards, falcons, harriers and eagles are found to
contain the deadly poison alphachlorolose. Who lays out the poisoned
baits, always ostensibly for hooded crows? Is it the lairds themselves?
There appears to be nothing in the preliminary material or in the
accompanying BBC book by Iain Fraser Grigor which suggests this, perhaps
the most important issue surrounding gamekeeping practice in Scotland,
will be approached at any point.
Doubtless the BBC will claim that it was never the purpose of the
programmes to discuss how estate management has destroyed and distorted
in the sacred name of the grouse, the deer and the sheep. But many of us
will watch The Gamekeeper, avidly drinking in the beauty and the gritty
realism, with that caveat in mind.

Alison Kerr finds that quality is still the priority 60 years after
Penguin published its first book
PENGUIN fanciers have never had it so good, as I discovered when I
received an extremely attractive, pocket-sized paperback through the
post courtesy of a thoughtful pal. Rather than send me a greetings card,
which would have been more expensive and contained considerably fewer
words, my friend chose to send me a book, and she sent it with just a
first-class stamp. Let Them Call It Jazz by Jean Rhys was her choice,
and it was this collection of three stories for 60 pence that sparked my
interest in the Penguin 60s.
Not that that's the best bargain Penguin has to offer. For the same
price I acquired a collection of five stories by one of my favourite
writers -- the great Damon Runyon. That's 12p a story. For 60p you can
have 14 stories by Saki; six fairy-tales by Hans Christian Andersen;
four of Muriel Spark's Collected Stories, two murder mysteries by Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle or Georges Simenon, or an entire thriller -- Goldfish
-- by the brilliant noir writer Raymond Chandler.
The other collections making up the 60 just published represent the
range of Penguin titles. The list of authors features everyone from
Oscar Wilde to Dirk Bogarde, Anais Nin to Camille Paglia, Truman Capote
to Spike Milligan.
The reason for the sudden proliferation of mini-Penguins at a
gloriously low price is that the publishing company is celebrating its
sixtieth anniversary on Sunday.
In 1935 Allen Lane was one of the partners in the Bodley Head
publishing company, but felt it was in something of a rut. Round about
this time, the story goes, he spent a weekend visiting Agatha Christie
and her husband. Desperate for some reading matter for his train journey
home he scoured Exeter station's bookstall but found only magazines and
reprints of Victorian novels -- nothing of any quality.
Thus was born the idea of printing affordable editions of good
contemporary writing. His colleagues, however, were sceptical.
Lane was convinced that there was enormous potential for his scheme,
if the vast numbers of people who regularly borrowed books from
libraries could be persuaded of the appeal of owning their own copies of
current titles -- for a reasonable price. Within a month, Lane had begun
to approach London publishers for the rights to reprint their
best-selling authors' works in a new series.
Most of them refused, worried that hardback sales would suffer. One
publisher did agree, however, but not because he was sure of the
scheme's success. Jonathan Cape sold the rights to 10 of his titles for
#40 each, but in later years admitted to Lane: ''I thought you were
bound to go bust and I thought I'd take 400 quid off you before you
did.''
The next step was to find a name for the new series. ''Dignified but
flippant'' was the remit Lane gave his secretary, and she came up with
Penguin. Edward Young, of the production department, was sent off to
London Zoo and returned with the sketch that evolved into the famous
Penguin trademark.
The first 10 titles (by such authors as Hemingway, Compton Mackenzie,
Agatha Christie, and Eric Linklater) appeared on July 30 and cost the
same price as a packet of cigarettes -- 6d. Their simple, attractive
orange and white covers reflected their modernity and helped establish
Penguin as a brand name.
Much of the history of the company sounds as if it has been lifted
straight from an Ealing film. When Penguin Books Ltd was formed in
January 1936 it had a share capital of #100 and its premises were
established in the crypt of the Holy Trinity Church in Euston Road. Each
member of the staff of 12 was paid a weekly sum of 37s 6d. An extra
penny per day was added to cover the cost of using the public toilets at
nearby Great Portland Street.
Similarly whimsical-sounding were Penguin's next lot of premises -- a
freehold site at Harmondsworth. When staff relocated there late in 1937,
they found the land had a crop of cabbages growing on it. To recoup some
of the company's outlay, Lane insisted on selling the vegetables. Staff
had to tiptoe around the precious cabbages while they packed and
despatched 140,000 books per week, and while workers completed work on
the floor of the building. None of this, however, appears to have
interfered with the company's success which the outbreak of war only
boosted.
During the war, several new breeds of Penguin were created, among them
Penguin New Writing, Penguin Classics and Penguin Specials, which were
the company's response to world events and which were phenomenally
successful. One of these, Hiroshima -- John Hersey's 30,000 word essay
on the aftermath of the atom bomb -- is to be republished on August 6,
the fiftieth anniversary of the tragedy.
In the 1950s, the children's Penguin equivalent, Puffin, was launched
with Barbara Euphan Todd's Worzel Gummidge.
In the early 1960s, the company was making headlines with its
publication of the first unabridged version of D H Lawrence's Lady
Chatterley's Lover. Penguin was immediately charged and spectacularly
acquitted of breaking the Obscene Publications Act. Needless to say, the
trial did Penguin nothing but good.
As will the current birthday campaign, which embodies perfectly Allen
Lane's original hopes for Penguin paperbacks: that they should be
affordable to everyone. But rather than a buying a book for the
equivalent of the price of a packet of cigarettes, this time round it's
possible to pick up at least four mini-Penguins with your ciggie money.
I don't know if smoking figures are down, but Penguin sales are
certainly up, as full-price hardbacks like Lady Thatcher's memoirs and
Stephen Hawkings's A Brief History of Time have been bumped out of the
bestseller list by the likes of Albert Camus, Virginia Woolf and, even,
Roman historian Marcus Aurelius.

NEW ENGLAND CLASSIC
AMERICAN Gene Sauers, back in familiar surroundings, revelled in the
relatively easy conditions to move within one stroke of leader Ronnie
Black after yesterday's opening round at the $1m Ideon New England
Classic.
''This is real easy after four days at the British Open,'' Sauers said
after having shot a five-under-par 66 on the Pleasant Valley course.
''It's like night and day. It's totally different golf over there (at
St Andrews). The wind was so brutal. I had three seven-putts on Sunday
and shot 80. But I learnt a lot.''
Sauers, in only his second British Open, tied for eighty-eighth at St
Andrews but, apart from his putting, he was satisfied with the rest of
his game, so he was not surprised by yesterday's good score. He joined a
group of 10 players a stroke behind Black, who had six birdies in a
flawless six-under 65. Leading scores (US unless stated):
65 -- Ronnie Black.
66 -- Ken Green, Jim McGovern, Jim Carter, George Burns, Mark Wurtz, P
H Horgan, Gene Sauers, Fred Funk, Joey Rassett, Scott McCarron.
67 -- Doug Martin, John Adams, Lennie Clements, Howard Twitty, Rick
Fehr, Tom Byrum, Jay Williamson.
Others included: 68 -- Mark Calcavecchia.   70 -- Peter Jacobsen,
David Feherty (N Ireland).     71 -- Paul Azinger.   74 -- Brad Faxon.

A SEARCH was under way last night for ways to cushion the effects on
Tayside and Grampian of the closure of the US Navy base at Edzell.
A task force is being set up to find ways to ease the sudden strain on
the businesses and trade of north Angus. The base was worth around #20m
a year to the local economy.
For around two years, it has been an open secret that the listening
base, home for 900 military personnel and their families, a total of
1800 people, was likely to go. It will, by September 1997. Rumour became
reality in a statement issued in Washington yesterday.
Mr Andrew Welsh, the SNP MP for Angus East, where around 230 mostly
Scottish civilian workers live, said: ''Both the local people and the US
personnel, who have enjoyed an excellent relationship over the years,
will be devastated by this decision.
''The Edzell base is a key source of employment and economic activity
in an area which is scarce of opportunities. The area is one of high
unemployment and this will leave an enormous hole in the local economy.
''The Government have long known that closure was likely so local
people are entitled to positive and immediate action. A task force will
be welcome but of itself is not nearly enough.''
He called for full use to be made of the land, buildings, and
infrastructure to attract new employment. The area should be given
Enterprise Zone status, he said, or at the least the restoration of
Assisted Area Status, which was withdrawn some years ago.
Mr John McAllion, MP, for Labour, criticised Scottish Office Ministers
for being caught on the hop by a closure they should have seen coming.
He said: ''They should have been planning in advance how to help local
communities through this massive change.''
The 443-acre base near Brechin, with its strange shaped communications
devices said to have played a vital role in the Gulf war, belongs to the
Ministry of Defence.
Squadron Leader Barbara Walker, RAF Commander on the base, said it was
part of a programme of scheduled defence closures in the US and Europe.
''The drawdown process will start in September of this year and
complete by September 1997. The facilities to be returned will include
the airfield, which has not been in use since the 1950s, the
administrative and operational buildings, and the sewage treatment farm.
''Some 160 married quarters attached to the site and 17 married
quarters at RAF Inverbervie will also be returned, together with housing
at Trinity Fields in Brechin, leased by the US Government from the
private sector.''
That, in fact, is everything at the base and the facilities include a
bowling alley, cinema, commissary supermarket, trout loch, beauty
parlour, a pub, gymnasium, saunas, and sports pitches.
It is hoped the rundown will be gradual and that a year from now, the
half-way point, half the personnel will still be employed.
The base lies in the Kincardine and Deeside constituency of Industry
Minister George Kynoch. He said: ''I have called for a joint working
group to be set up immediately to handle the rundown of the base and to
try to identify other uses to which it might be put. We intend to invite
the local authorities and the local enterprise companies to be on the
group together with the Ministry of Defence.''
Mr Bob Doak, company development director for Scottish Enterprise
Tayside, and Mr Mike Fleming, business development director for Grampian
Enterprise, said time appeared to be on their side, and that they would
work with the relevant authorities to plan the most beneficial way ahead
for local people, businesses, and the economy as a whole.
Local people fear the closure will have a devastating effect on the
surrounding community, not simply because of the financial effect, but
because of the integral part it has played in daily life.
There are almost three times as many residents inside the base, which
was officially established 35 years ago, than there are in the nearby
village of Edzell. Many speak first about the loss of friends rather
than the impact on their businesses.
Mrs Christie Bing, chairman of the Scottish-American Relations
Council, said relationships were extremely close.
''There is nothing the Americans will not do for us, whether with the
old people or the young people. The relationship has been likened to
that of a family.
''I believe that at one time there were 35 to 40 marriages a year
involving men from the base and local girls and it is extremely sad. It
will hit the neighbourhood very badly but we hope they will all come
back and visit us.''
Mr Adam Mullan, who runs Collectables, an antiques and gift shop in
Edzell's High Street, said: ''They have just replaced the village
suspension bridge and were involved in a number of community activities
so they will be missed from that point of view.''
Hotelier Barry Cale, already working on the conversion of his hotel's
squash court and swimming pool into housing, said there was a suggestion
that the base might be turned into an open prison.

The Civic, with Japanese engineering and European style, gets a warm
reception from Ross Finlay
WHEN Honda and Rover parted company, at least as far as
cross-shareholdings and major co-operative ventures were concerned, the
people who regarded this as a considerable blow to the Japanese firm
underestimated both its quick reactions and the worldwide scale of its
business. While certainly offended, it simply changed step to announce a
new long-term European strategy, based on its factory at Swindon and a
strengthened European headquarters in Reading.
The Swindon plant opened in 1986, and it has been an object lesson in
steady development. From being simply a pre-delivery inspection centre,
it now builds both the Accord and the Civic five-door. When the Rover
deal expired, Honda smartly installed a previously un-needed
body-pressings section. Exports figure strongly in its programme, which
will see car production boosted from 100,000 to 150,000 by the end of
the decade.
British-market Honda cars come from various different production
facilities. As well as the Swindon models, there are cars like the
Accord Aerodeck built in the US, while others, of course, are shipped
from Japan. And there is also a strong motorcycle business. The various
elements of Honda's international operations mean that it can claim some
staggering records. For example, if you count all its car, motorcycle,
commercial vehicle, tractor and generator divisions, it builds nearly
eight million engines every year.
And it is involved in a mesmerising variety of joint ventures. The
Isuzu-based 4x4s known here as the Frontera, Monterey and Trooper are
also badged in Japan as the Honda Passport, Jazz and Horizon. Despite
the break with Rover, a re-badged version of the Discovery is sold as
the Honda Crossroad. In its home market, Honda also markets the Chrysler
Jeep in its Wrangler, Cherokee and Grand Cherokee forms.
Mainstay of the UK business, however, is the Civic, which I have been
driving as a Swindon-built five-door 1.6-litre LS at #13,145. This model
does not use Honda's variable-valve VTEC technology, in either its
performance or economy types, but is fitted with a modified, 113bhp
version of the smooth-revving unit familiar from the superseded
Concerto.
There is no doubt that Honda builds beautiful engines, but this one
takes a different approach from others in rival cars. The power is
certainly there, and so is the torque, but you have to let the engine
rev before hitting the peak torque figure at no less than 5100rpm. Many
competitive engines reach their maximum torque at half that engine
speed. The Civic is no slogger from low revs, often needing a change
down to romp away from speeds which many other cars in the class would
tackle one gear higher up.
That may be a result of Honda's extensive experience of racing
engines. Certainly, the engineering expertise the company has developed
over the years is obvious in most of its family cars. Practically nobody
in this class provides a finer gear-change action than Honda. In fact,
some rival manufacturers ought to test-drive a Honda and blush with
shame at the way their own gear changes, by comparison, either wobble or
clonk.
Reaching 60mph in about ten seconds and going on to a test track
maximum close to 120mph, the Civic LS is a spritely 1.6. Fuel
consumption returns are around 49mpg at 56mph, 38 at 75 and 31 on the
urban cycle.
Honda has benefited from its European links. In the early days, its
interiors were nothing special, and it took ages to figure out how to
provide a decent balance between handling and ride. Now, the fit,
finish, materials and patterns used in its interiors, like the exterior
turn-out, are right up with the best in the class.
The instrument display in the well-equipped LS includes neat touches
like the minor outside dials being slightly angled towards the driver.
And this compact hatchback responds well to being driven smartly on
Scottish country roads, nicely balanced on corners, brows and changing
surfaces without ever turning into the sporting saloon that peaky engine
might lead you to expect.

GLASGOW'S title of City of Architecture and Design 1999 would be a
perfect accompaniment to the Tall Ships race if the Clyde were to
succeed in its bid for the 1999 event.
Events like the Tall Ships race held in Leith and Glasgow's
forthcoming City of Architecture and Design 1999 not only attract a
welcome boost to the local economy that the accompanying visitors bring,
but they offer the potential to raise an international awareness of
Scotland as an area of enterprise.
Given the Clyde's heritage of shipping and (future?) shipbuilding,
attracting events like the Tall Ships race offers the opportunity to
reflect what the industrial legacy, the shipbuilding era, represents to
Glasgow.
Combined with the title of City of Architecture and Design 1999
Glasgow has the opportunity to promote Scotland as a locus of
international design and centre of excellence.
Furthermore, an emphasis on design creates the opportunity to link the
nautical engineering, sales, marketing, and operational expertise that
already exists in Scotland which, combined with the stimulus of a Tall
Ships race, may realistically result in an upsurge in shipbuilding on
the Clyde.

ON a recent visit to New Lanark Conservation Village by train we found
on arrival at Lanark Station absolutely no information, signposting,
bill-posters, directions of any kind (this also applied to the Main
Street outside) to assist us in finding our way either on foot or by
bus.
The bus station being adjacent to the railway station it seemed
obvious that we should expect a link service to New Lanark. The local
people, and we asked many, were very helpful but no, no bus to New
Lanark.
One bus each hour serving a local scheme would pick us up outside
Lanark Station, on a single yellow line, if we indicated that it should
stop.
Admittedly most people nowadays have cars but with school holidays now
upon us there would be many out-of-town visitors who would also be
disappointed.
New Lanark is well worth visiting and we enjoyed our day, but we lost
nearly two hours because it was not publicised properly at Lanark.

BRITAIN'S health chiefs are rightly concerned at the incidence of
obesity in the nation's population in general and among the young in
particular. They fear an explosion of ill health in the future
threatening the social well-being and the economic life of the
community. The signs are not encouraging.
The usual response is to recommend more facilities for games in the
school and the adoption of more exercise by the adults in society. The
first requires considerable expenditure which at the end of the day may
still be inadequate for full provision.
The second assumes willingness and the extra time which may well not
be available in today's over-regulated society.
Little thought has been given to the idea of overhauling the whole
structure of society in an effort to change lifestyles.
The provision of over-cheap energy has enabled machines to substitute
for manual labour while the car has eliminated healthy walking and
cycling.
Those who previously advocated the leisure society are now slowly
beginning to realise that healthy exercise was part and parcel of the
normal lifestyle.
With a bit of enlightened economic planning, it could be so again.

THE Emergency Planning Society, like others concerned with the safety
of passengers travelling on ro-ro ferries, awaits with interest the
formal outcome of the deliberations at the Commons Transport Select
Committee.
However, the committee is expected to call for changes in ferry design
and an urgent review of evacuation procedures for passengers (July 24).
This is of particular interest to this society, as the task of
evacuation falls on the shoulders of the emergency and health services
and on local authorities.
Once ashore the hundreds, possibly thousands, of evacuees may need
urgent medical attention, warmth, food, information, and a range of care
services. Their families need to know they are safe, and the media need
access to good information and interviews.
Recent emergency exercises and studies held in Scotland and on the
south coast of England have demonstrated the essential need for flexible
and robust arrangements to be put in place to respond effectively to
these urgent needs.
Without full recognition of this point, and continuing resources to
prepare for the emergency response, we may yet see a future ferry mishap
creating much unnecessary hardship and distress.
In this time of an increased incidence of major emergencies any action
that can be taken to reduce the possibility of ferry tragedy must be
welcomed. However, as emergency services and local authorities' budgets
are under pressure as never before, we must urge that the need to invest
resources to plan and prepare for the care of evacuees is not forgotten.

THE minor incident involving the Prince of Wales's ground loop in the
BAe 146 of the Queen's Flight last year reminds me of the Fleet Air Arm
poem regarding the Royal Air Force.
''They say in the RAF that a landing's OK
If the pilot can get out and still walk away,
But in the Fleet Air Arm the prospect is dim,
It's too . . . bad if the pilot can't swim!''

MARK STEPHEN is correct in suggesting that the West Lothian Question
(WLQ) is the central problem in the debate over Scotland's
constitutional future (Time for Labour to wake up, July 24).
However, he is totally wrong in suggesting that there is ''no neat
solution to the WLQ other than independence''. Separatism is not a neat
answer to anything and I view it as axiomatic that there is no solution
to the WLQ outside a federal UK.
The WLQ asks why, post devolution, Scottish Westminster MPs should
determine policy on English education, health, local government, etc,
while such matters in Scotland are settled by the Scottish parliament.
The only respectable answer is that they shouldn't and that these
should be determined solely by elected English representatives in an
English parliament and/or a set of English regional assemblies.
While widely canvassed, Mr Stephen's solution of reducing the number
of Scottish MPs who can interfere in purely domestic English affairs is
wholly bogus and misconceived. Post devolution, there should be no
Scottish MPs involved in determining policy on solely English matters,
except in the period of constitutional transition.
His vision of a long-run Westminster solution in which Scots are
whipped in to outvote English MPs on English concerns is simply absurd,
irrespective of the size of the Scottish complement.
As the Scottish experience demonstrates, this is an unstable position
which will never gain the political consensus required to endure. Its
merit is that it will set off a great and welcome debate on how England
should be properly governed.
However, there is no inherent need to consider any reduction in the
number of Scottish MPs who will legislate on the non-devolved issues
such as defence, foreign affairs, public finance, and macroeconomic
policy.
What Jack Straw, the Labour Party, and all the British people must
waken up to is that they can't agree to Scottish, Welsh, and Irish
devolution and expect England to be governed in the same way as at
present. Once the dust settles, I would be amazed if the English people
accepted any legitimate role for others in what will become areas of
English domestic policy.
Devolution cuts both ways and if the status quo is not a political
option in Scotland then the status quo will founder as an option for
England and demand for new arrangements will emerge.
Federalism is the inevitable consequence of devolution and English
politicians should be talking about the shape, timing, and management of
changes which cannot be avoided. It is to be hoped that this reality is
reflected in Labour's forthcoming consultation on regional government in
England.

BEFORE unleashing Michael Fry on its readership The Herald might at
least have told us who exactly he is, as this reader at least had never
heard of him and now wishes that this were still the case.
His latest outburst (July 26) against West of Scotland councils, with
references to ''closed corporatism'', and his analogy with the Mafia,
rests uneasily on the shoulders of an apparent Tory apologist.
To start with perhaps Mr Fry could enlighten us as to what is so
criminal about ''cheap rents''. He could then perhaps explain why it is
not hypocritical to talk of ''closed corporatism'' and ''cosy
relationships'' while supporting a party whose Ministers in Government
made an art form of privatising public utilities and months later found
themselves ''cosy'' seats on the boards of the new private companies.
I very much doubt if Michael Forsyth could be considered enough of a
political heavyweight to sort out these ex-Tory Minister ''Godfathers''
(even if the political will was there) which is no doubt why he was
foisted on Scotland.
A glimmer of hope exists, however, with the news that Mr Forsyth has
only appointed one special adviser. Perhaps he is keeping the other post
available for Michael Fry.

ONE can hardly disagree with John McKay's critique of capitalism (July
24). Indeed the capitalist market economy brings about the very
conditions which Hobbes proposed that it was the duty of the State to
prevent -- ''the war of each against all''.
But what is this ''socialism'' that is claimed to be the idealistic
alternative?
In the absence of any existing ideal society, or of any past examples,
it has been claimed that socialism is ''something new'' which comes
after capitalism. This is the evolutionary Marxist expectation and I
would propose that it is no more than a delusion.
Various philosophers, including Adam Smith and Marx, recognised that
man's consciousness is formed by the world in which he lives and that it
is the ideas thus formed with which he thinks and acts upon and so
constructs his world.
Thus we had feudalism, which was essentially about power relationships
based on ownership of the means of production, the land, giving way to
capitalism which is also about the power relationship based on ownership
of the means of production.
But whereas the oppression of feudal relationships was obvious,
capitalism is much more subtle. By paying labour its ''market value'' it
fragments the opposition by allowing the ''more able'', or just plain
lucky, to ''get on''.
Seldom do the ''successful'' realise that getting on simply implies
being allowed more credit at the new company store which, although now a
national enterprise, enthrals more completely than the old company store
ever did because the relationship is now voluntary.
As a consequence there is no common consciousness or awareness by
labour of its true circumstances and so, as Marx said, ''Capitalism
develops a working class which by education, traditions, and habit looks
upon the conditions of that mode of production as self-evident laws of
nature -- capitalism, once fully developed, breaks down all
resistance''.
''New Labour'' demonstrates the truth of this. It was for this reason
that John MacLean said that ''the millennium would only come about
through the education of the working classes''.
But no-one is educating the working classes today; in fact the only
concern is how to make capitalism work better. Yet, as observed by Marx
(and implied by Adam Smith), the capitalist system contains the seeds of
its own destruction.
When that inevitably happens, and considering how man's consciousness
is formed, it is no more than wishful thinking to believe that the
outcome will be some idealistic new world where all is peace and
harmony. It is more likely to be Bosnia on a global scale.

TADEUSZ Mazowiecki is a patently honest and decent man. He has been
one of the peripheral figures in the story of ex-Yugoslavia but he
should have been at its very core. It was his responsibility to
investigate on behalf of the United Nations the many abuses of human
rights which have taken place since the very earliest days of the
conflict. On the infrequent occasions when proper publicity was given to
the 17 reports he delivered in less than three years he has been visibly
and increasingly worn by the demoralising and deeply upsetting nature of
the evidence he had gathered. To be the UN human rights investigator it
is necessary to be fired by the urgent necessity of the task.
It is also necessary to believe that something can and will be done
about the events to which he must bear witness.   Mr Mazowiecki began
his task with a clear vision of his duties and a belief that the United
Nations and the world leaders who constitute it would honour the high
ideals which they were (and are) so proud of proclaiming. Yesterday he
resigned because he could no longer stand the hypocrisy of those who
promised to protect Bosnians in safe areas, and who then stood aside and
let them be overrun by the Bosnian Serbs. The result of this hypocrisy
(for Mr Mazowiecki has surely used the right word) is that those who
commit human rights abuses in former Yugoslavia believe that they can
continue to do so with impunity. They are probably right, and all of us
must absorb the implications and share the responsibility. Here are the
lessons; it is deceitful to make promises you cannot or will not keep
and wickedly hypocritical to proclaim values you have no intention of
honouring.

IN response to Dr David Lowry (July 24) I have now had the opportunity
to check my facts in triplicate with the following results:
According to Who Was Who Clement Richard Attlee attended Potsdam
Conference as representative of Opposition, June, 1945, and as Prime
Minister July, 1945.
The Dictionary of National Biography states that Attlee's ''first task
after the principal posts had been filled was to return to the Potsdam
Conference with the new Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin''.
Lastly, on contacting the Labour Party headquarters at John Smith
House, London they concurred that Clement Attlee returned to Potsdam
immediately after being installed as Prime Minister on July 26, 1945.
Incidentally, Attlee was more than a senior Minister in the previous
Coalition Goverment, he had in fact been Deputy Prime Minister.

<HEADLINE>First cut for island's #6.4m bridge link</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>8</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977174757</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE #6.4m bridge linking the island of Scalpay to Harris was
officially under way yesterday.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Minister of State for Scotland, cut the
first turf at the controls of a digger.
The bridge is the largest single civil engineering project by the
Western Isles Council and has attracted the largest award made by the
management committee for EU Objective 1 funding.
Lord James said this funding had provided #10m so far for projects in
the Western Isles, including the Scalpay bridge, a new ferry terminal at
Stornoway, and CalMac's Sound of Harris projects in the Western Isles.
Referring to the importance of such infrastructure, and the 250th
anniversary of Bonnie Prince Charlie landing in the Western Isles, he
said that if such bridges and ferries had been available then, the
prince could have escaped more easily and quickly.
The Minister added: ''Scalpay's economy is heavily dependent on the
traditional industries of textiles, fishing, crofting, and tourism. The
continued prosperity and development of these mainstay activities will
be assisted by this project.''
The council convener, Mr Donald Mackay, paid tribute to the Scottish
Office team for the project.
He said: ''This is the largest single civil engineering project we as
a council have ever undertaken. This is not, however, the real
significance.
''The real significance of this project is the commitment which it
shows to the future of Scalpay and of Harris and to all our more
isolated communities.
''It will be concrete proof that the council, and not only the council
but the Scottish Office and the European Union, have an unshakeable
determination to halt and to reverse the social and economic decline of
our communities.
''The bridge must be only the first step in this programme of
regeneraton. The rebirth of Scalpay will, I am sure, provide the impetus
for the regeneration of the whole of Harris.''
The steel box-girder bridge -- with a concrete deck 334 metres long
and a central span over the navigable channel of 172 metres, together
with about 660 metres of approach road -- is expected to be completed by
December 1996.

<HEADLINE>Treasury clears itself over power shares</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977174758</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury last night cleared its name over the handling of the
#4000m sale of shares in National Power and PowerGen following
allegations of insider dealing by the Government.
An inquiry by the Treasury found there was ''no evidence of
wrongdoing'' by its officials over the sale in March of its remaining
shares in the electricity generating companies.
The inquiry followed a storm of protest over conduct of the sale,
including a call for action from the Stock Exchange.
Labour immediately described last night's report a ''whitewash'' and
said it was not satisfactory for the Treasury to investigate itself.
Controversy arose earlier this year because, after the price of the
shares had been announced and trading had begun, the electricity
industry regulator made an announcement which sent prices tumbling.
The regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, announced his intention
to consult on changing the price caps on the regional electricity
companies.
This led to a #3700m collapse in the share prices and left them below
the issue price.
When Professor Littlechild said the Government had had prior knowledge
of his announcement, this left the Treasury open to accusations that it
had kept quiet about the price-sensitive information.
But in a letter yesterday to the chief executive of the Stock
Exchange, Mr Michael Lawrence, the Treasury's permanent secretary, Sir
Terence Burns, wrote that it was clear to both himself and the
Chancellor ''that there is no evidence of wrongdoing''.
He wrote: ''We are satisfied that Treasury officials behaved
conscientiously throughout this major operation. Key decisions were
taken with the benefit of professional advice.''
But Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said:
''The simple fact is that information which was relevant and available
was not released prior to the sell-off, with very significant
consequences.''
Sir Terence said that Treasury officials had considered in the week
before the sale whether the possible announcement by the regulator would
affect the share prices.
The matter was fully discussed with professional advisers, but it was
concluded that if the regulator made his announcement it would not have
a ''significant effect'' on share prices.
But he admitted: ''In the event, there was a much greater than
anticipated impact on the share prices, although the partly paid shares
have subsequently performed robustly.''
Mr John Beastall, a Treasury official not involved in the sale, who
was asked to conduct the inquiry, also issued a timetable of events for
the sell-off and made recommendations on how to avoid a similar
situation in future.

WE can assume that Mr Michael Forsyth will, as Secretary of State for
Scotland, have a public agenda and a private one. Although he has been
in the post only for around three weeks we have seen enough of his
public strategy to appreciate that thus far it is taken directly from
the Tony Blair textbook of political presentation. By saying this we do
not mean to be unkind. Mr Blair has achieved much, although even his
most ardent supporters would have to admit that the early months of his
rule over the Labour Party were a triumph of presentation over political
clarity. Mr Forsyth has obviously learned a good deal since his early
days in politics. He is aware that the naked portrayal of Conservative
ideology, blue in tooth and claw, does not impress the Scottish
electorate. Thus we have an apparent softening; just as Mr Blair was
accused of moving Labour's policies from red to pink, Mr Forsyth is
touching in his public appeal with lilac paint. Kandinsky would have
made much of it, but the rest of us will have to grapple with the real
meaning of Mr Forsyth's appeal for partnership, particularly with local
authorities, and his willingness to espouse specifically Scottish issues
even if they clash with the more general trend of right-wing thinking.
An example of this emerged in his wide-ranging interview in this
newspaper this week. While the right-wing 92 Group of Conservative MPs
is busy advocating that Scotland's Exchequer Grant should be calculated
on a population basis, thereby potentially reducing Mr Forsyth's budget
next year by a quarter, their soul-mate in the Scottish Office insists
that the cut would be over his dead body. This is ringing stuff and a
wonderful opportunity to show sense and resolution, but it is
essentially meaningless as the 92 Group's proposals are in any case
beyond the pale of sane government. All of this makes abundantly clear
the folly of judging at such short acquaintance the Secretary of State's
real intentions, as opposed to his summer campaign of sweet and possibly
superficial reasonableness.
As our political editor has indicated, Mr Forsyth's current tasks are
to secure the West Highland railway line and to preserve what he can of
the Torry Agricultural Research Centre in Aberdeen. The railway issue
may well be resolved sensibly, although this process was slipping into
place before Mr Forsyth's appointment. The Torry affair is potentially
disastrous for the future of scientific research in Scotland and is a
more serious threat to Mr Forsyth's effectiveness. He has hinted that
some research may remain in Aberdeen while the bulk is transferred to
York. This is not good enough. The work at Torry is inter-connected and
to leave a remnant in Aberdeen would achieve little or nothing in the
way of either scientific or political sense. The takeover of Scottish
Nuclear, with the growing suspicion that its Scottishness will be a very
thin veneer, is another problem which will come to haunt the Scottish
Office. The more serious and testing issues due to emerge as we edge
towards the end of the year will provide the real challenges for Mr
Forsyth. Only then will we see whether the ideologue or the pragmatist
will win the schizophrenic struggle within.

IT is tempting to fall into gloom at the news that the US naval base
at Edzell will close progressively over the next two years. The effect
on the surrounding area will undoubtedly be significant, especially as
the base is believed to contribute annually some #20m to local
households and businesses. Just as inevitably, some local figures are
determined to present the closure as a disaster. It is serious, but it
is not as desperate as that. Indeed the evidence from Dunoon and
district, which suffered the much larger withdrawal of the US base on
the Holy Loch, is that events of this sort can act as a catalyst,
propelling local initiatives to the forefront and subsequently drawing
in fresh employment and business from outside.
The Cowal Peninsula lost well over 800 jobs when the Holy Loch base
closed in 1992, and the event was followed by dire predictions of
economic and social collapse.   Nothing of the sort happened. Local
ginger groups were formed to combat the loss of jobs and revenue and by
last year it was clear that initiatives in the area and from outside
were on the point of recouping all of the jobs lost when the Americans
left. At this moment the Cowal area is one of two sites in Scotland
firmly in line for a 2000-job semiconductor plant from abroad. The fact
that it is in contention points to the effectiveness of local
rehabilitation and the self-confidence and skills of the workforce.
There is no reason why the same should not happen around Edzell.
Government help will be needed, and already there is word of a task
force which will assess the future potential. North Angus has suffered a
blow, but it will not be fatal and may even lead to better things.

<TEXT>
FERRIES using UK ports are likely to have to undergo expensive safety
alterations later this year, it emerged yesterday.
The work could involve the fitting of watertight compartment bulkheads
on roll-on roll-off ferry car decks to prevent any repetition of the
Zeebrugge and Estonia disasters.
With world shipping hopelessly split over the introduction of safety
measures, the Government is prepared to act unilaterally.
Talks are under way between Government shipping experts and ferry
companies, and studies into possible measures and their implementation
are expected to be completed next month.
By November, ships will have to start complying with standards
proposed by a panel of experts set up by the International Maritime
Organisation.
Ferry companies will be working with the Government to implement a
phasing-in period for the work but Ministers are adamant that economic
considerations alone will not determine the length of the period.
The changes will be costly and could lead to a shake-up in ferry
operations, as the vessels may not be able to carry so many vehicles and
could face longer turn-around times.
It was also learned yesterday that recommendations of the IMO's
experts have divided the organisation's member states. Only a minority,
including Britain, favours the recommendations. Other countries
apparently are resisting the expense and the physical difficulties of
tighter safety measures.
It was water flooding the car deck through the bow door that caused
the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster at Zeebrugge in 1987, in which
190 people lost their lives. More bow door problems caused the Estonia
to sink last September in a tragedy that claimed more than 900 lives.
The Government last April published its own report on ferry safety and
urged ferry operators and world shipping to bring in improvements.
Research carried out by the UK's Marine Safety Agency showed that
transverse bulkheads can improve the survivability of a ship with water
on its car deck.
About 90 ferries operate in and out of British ports.

A MAN who murdered three-year-old Rosie Palmer, after she left her
home to buy a lolly from an ice-cream van, was jailed for life
yesterday.
Shaun Anthony Armstrong, 33, had been expected to deny murder but
admit to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility when
the trial began at Leeds Crown Court. In a surprise development, he pled
guilty to murder and just 30 minutes later was being led away.
Mr Justice Ognall told him: ''Your depraved conduct led you into the
murder of this little girl. Your counsel speaks of your state of anguish
and grief. It can surely be as nothing compared to what was suffered by
little Rosie Palmer's family. There is evidence you are a severely
disordered personality.''
Armstrong's guilty plea meant, however, that he had accepted he was
fully responsible for his actions that day, said the judge.
Rosie Palmer disappeared after leaving her home in Henrietta Street,
Hartlepool, on June 30 last year. After three days of searching, her
partly clothed body was found in a bin liner in a cupboard at
Armstrong's flat, just around the corner from her home.
Outlining the case, Mr James Spencer QC, prosecuting, said Armstrong
had lived at the flat for about nine months. He killed the child on his
32nd birthday after returning from a social club where he drank six
pints of beer and several large rums.
He reached home by taxi at about 3.30pm, around the time the ice-cream
van called in the quiet cul-de-sac and Rosie Palmer was given money by
her mother to buy a lolly.
Mr Spencer said that when the girl's body was found, her shorts and
underwear were missing and there were signs that violence had been used
against her.
It was believed she must have been dead by 4.35pm, he said, just over
an hour after the ice-cream van called, and it was about this time that
Armstrong actually incriminated himself. He told a shopkeeper he was
going to help look for the little girl who was missing -- but at that
time no-one was aware of what had happened.
In fact, it was not until 8.45pm, more than four hours later, that her
disappearance was reported to the police after a frantic search by her
family.
After this, Armstrong took his dog and some cider to a nearby beach
where for two hours he indulged in ''extraordinary behaviour'', running
in and out of the sea.
Mr Spencer said that in the course of routine house-to-house
inquiries, the police visited Armstrong's flat but saw nothing unusual
there. However, on the third day of the inquiry, they returned and a
more comprehensive search of the flat was carried out.
It was then that Rosie Palmer's body was found inside the cupboard on
the landing.
Gilbert Gray QC, mitigating, said: ''Armstrong stands in a state of
ineffable grief, anguish, and utter bewilderment, for never in his whole
life of disturbed conduct and under-privileged early years did he ever
think he would one day be convicted of an offence of this nature.''
Mr Gray referred to a report which showed that, as a child, Armstrong
had repeatedly received treatment and care by various authorities. He
had low self-esteem.
When he was 16, he joined the Navy but was discharged after four
months because of psychological disorder. Armstrong had attempted to
kill himself on 17 occasions.

<HEADLINE>Mrs X denies 'fantasising' in rape case</HEADLINE>

A FORMER psychiatric patient told a court yesterday that the boss of a
hospital forced her to have sex on ''seven or eight'' occasions.
Mrs X, now 50, claimed Mr Norman McBain raped her in Kirklands
Hospital, Bothwell, where she was being treated for her illness.
Mr McBain, now 70, the former senior nursing officer at Kirklands,
denies raping Mrs X and three other women patients at the hospital in a
10-year period up to his retirement in 1979.
Mrs X told the High Court at Airdrie that she was forced into sex in
several different areas of the hospital. ''The first time was in the
sewing room, then in my bedroom at the hospital, then in a shed under
the south ward and in the launderette, where he put a blanket down on
the floor.
''I told him I didn't want any babies. He said he couldn't have any
babies. I had never had sex before.''
Mrs X, who was in the hospital for 15 years, said Mr McBain's
behaviour forced her to run away five times.
Advocate-depute Bill Dunlop put it to Mrs X that it might be suggested
she was fantasising. She said: ''No, I'm telling the truth. I hated him
and I still hate him to this day because of what he did.''
Mr McBain was acquitted of a fifth charge of raping another woman
patient by Lord Gill, after the prosecution led no evidence.
Mr McBain said he was ''astounded'' by the allegations. The first time
he had heard of them was in September last year.
Asked by defence QC Mr Gordon Jackson if there had been any sexual
involvment with any patients, he said: ''Never, ever.''
Of his accusers, he said: ''They are sub-normal and incompetent. They
need care and attention and are apt to fantasise.''
He added that one of his accusers had claimed in 1969 that he had
fathered her child, an allegation that was proved false.
His wife, Ena, 67, lived at the hospital with her husband and worked
there as a seamstress. She said she would have known if her husband had
been forcing sex on patients.
In his final submission, Mr Dunlop said: ''Mr McBain betrayed the
trust of the people he should have been caring for.''
Mr Jackson said it was ''horrendous'' that no details of how evidence
was gathered from the accusers had been made available.
He said: ''We will never know how much was put into their heads. It is
like dealing with children. It is a most dangerous case.''
The trial continues.

WHEN former American naval pilot David Greer sat down in 1989 to write
Burning Blue, he could never have imagined how topical it would become.
Clinton had not yet tried to decriminalise gays in the military nor had
four former British military personnel taken their complaint to the High
Court for wrongful dismissal on grounds of sexual orientation. Art
anticipates life.
Greer's play has now arrived in the West End after a sell-out run on
the fringe and is a tantalising experience that makes you catch your
breath half in shock, half as if you've seen it somewhere before.
Greer's glory boys are the kind of clean-limbed fighter heroes of a
whole era of Hollywood war movies. Antony Edridge's Lt ''Danno'' Lynch
even has something of a Cary Grant look about him.
But there the resemblance ends. Part Caine Mutiny for the 90s, part
buddy movie on stage and part gay ''coming out'' tale, Burning Blue
crackles with authenticity, heightened to hurricane force in John Hickok
and John Napier's superbly staged aircraft-carrier, jet-pilot,
cloud-skimming production.
In a terrible tale of personal lives destroyed by innuendo and
prejudice, Edridge's contained performance is its quiet, authoritative
centre, and Tim Woodward's fanatical Special Agent Cokely -- determined
to prove the truth behind Danno, an otherwise exemplary naval pilot,
being sighted in a gay disco in Hong Kong with fellow pilot -- its
dramatic counterpart.
Greer doesn't always escape melodrama but writing with sensitivity and
perception on the grey area between camraderie and homosexual love, the
macho buzz of speed and the frozen deserts of the heart, for a first
play it remains a staggering achievement.

YUKIO Ninagawa says he has used the imagery and philosophy of Buddhism
as a way of interpreting Shakespeare's theme about the rebirth of love
in A Midsummer Night's Dream. But to western eyes, he has also taken
many far-less-esoteric aspects of Japanese culture to illuminate this
timeless comedy.
Returning to Britain for a frustratingly short two-stop tour, the
director who so captivated Edinburgh Feetival theatregoers with his
productions of Medea and Macbeth in the mid-eighties certainly appears
to be back on top form. Unlike his everything-but-the-kitchen-sink
version of The Tempest which played in Edinburgh in 1988 and, by all
reports, his more recent production of Peer Gynt, this Dream is all of a
piece.
True, he draws on an uncommonly broad range of cultural influences,
but somehow the dream world of Shakespeare's play can accommodate and
embrace them.
So we have a gymnasitc Puck played by a Chinese opera actor and an
off-stage voice; we have the Mechanicals arriving on mopeds and
pushbikes; we have Noh Kabuki-nfluenced dance sequences; and -- supreme
inspiration -- a Snug played by a towering former Sumo wrestler.
But more subtlety than this, the strictures of a more formal society
make an awful lot of sense in the authoritarian context of Shakespeare's
day.
It also looks a treat, as five columns of powdery sand cascade almost
continually down from the ceiling, picked out by Tamotsu Harada's crisp
lighting. There are many elegiac moments and much robust comedy, though
gags are missed around the part of Helena and Bottom as an ass. Still,
there was little room for scepticism after hearing the vociferous
standing ovation last night by a sell out Newcastle audience.

YOUR question: is it possible for music to embody subtle and minutely
detailed emotional truths in an open-air sports stadium in which 20,000
people are clapping their hands above their heads like a demented
aerobics class while another 20,000 are peering at the faraway stage and
wondering whether REM's Michael Stipe has indeed just wandered out
unannounced to trade a few gritty vocal exchanges with Spearhead's
leader, another Michael, Michael Franti?
And on last night's evidence your answers are yes and yes,
emphatically.
Murrayfield's first big yes was for Spearhead's frontman. Franti's
band succeeded in rousing the masses with a display of diverse musical
inputs which underpin lyrics of equal complexity. In other, simpler
words Spearhead's songs are cerebral, politically aware and intuitive
all at once -- and you can shimmy to them too. We did.
As we did to REM, all the while saying yes, yes, yes. You see, when
REM play miracles happen. And last night time stood still literally:
Michael Stipe as ever a figure of compelling bizarreness, mesmeric,
genuinely strange was well as strangely genuine.
Stipe and company last night demonstrated their unique ability to act
as a channel for a host of emotions. Nowhere was this better
demonstrated than on Ladies Choice, a breathy falsetto song which is
about the nature of friendship. I blubbed.
But then again I kept on blubbing. At Losing My Religion. At
Everybody's Hurts. At the one which asks if you believe they put a man
on the moon; the one that's happy and sad at the same time and that has
a weary, flat, near-negative chorus of yeah, yeah, yeahs. But REM are a
positive thing. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah? Definitely. Totally. Absolutely. Yes.

A SHERIFF yesterday criticised a social work report on a 15-year-old
Dumfries boy who pled guilty to a series of driving offences at
Kirkcudbright.
The boy had admitted driving dangerously on various roads in the
Stewartry and Nithsdale area, including the A75; crossing continuous
white lines near Dumfries; driving at excessive speed on the Dumfries
by-pass, failing to stop for police, and also endangering the lives of
police officers, members of the public, and other road users. He also
admitted driving without holding a licence and without insurance.
Sheriff James Smith told the boy he had endangered the life of police
officers and members of the public and he would be placed on a deferred
sentence regime until he was 16.
Criticising the social work report for not recommending residential
training as an option, Sheriff Smith said this was an appalling
incidence of joyriding which was, fortunately, rare in rural areas.
He told the boy: ''You are not getting way with this and you will be
punished. The report is not satisfactory.
''I have to take into account the public interest, and a public duty
to perform, and you will have a series of deferrals at three months at a
time when you will come back to the court.''
Kirkcudbright Sheriff Court heard how the boy took police on a seven
mile chase along the A75 Gretna to Stranraer road at speeds of between
60mph and 85mph, swerved across the road, negotiated bends on the wrong
side of the road, went round a roundabout on the Dumfries by-pass in an
anti-clockwise direction, failed to stop for police, and was stopped
only when he was cornered by police in Dumfries.
The sheriff had told the boy that an adult faced prison for this type
of offence and deferred sentence for three months, warning him that he
could end up in residential training or in a Young Offenders'
Institution when he reached 16, if he failed to keep out of trouble.
Procurator-fiscal Frank Walkingshaw told how the police had been
operating a static check in Crocketford when they decided to carry out a
road check on the vehicle driven by the accused, who cannot be named.
However, the car did not stop and police followed it along the A75 for
some distance with their blue light flashing.
He said that at times the police were travelling at 80mph, and
sometimes in excess of this figure, and they had to overtake numerous
vehicle to keep in touch with the accused.
An agent told the court that the boy accepted it was a foolish thing
to have done and realised the serious implications.

David Belcher goes all gooey over the strains of a new Glasgow combo
with some familiar faces
FIRST things first. There's Sugartown, the woozily-wondrous Glasgow
band whose debut album, Swimming in The Horsespool, was issued by the
Hamburg-based Marina label, and there's Sugartown, the woozily-wondrous
Lee Hazelwood song which Nancy Sinatra crooned in 1966. In understanding
Sugartown, the band, it might be helpful to quote some of the lyrics
from Sugartown, the song.
''I got some troubles, but they won't last/ I'm gonna lay right here
in the grass/ And all my troubles will pass/ 'Cause I'm in
Shush-shush-shush-shush-shush-shush-shushshush-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shSugartown.''
And why might these words be relevant? Because there is an honest,
no-nonsense sweetness about Sugartown vocalist Gwen Stewart
which even Stewart's early, rough passage through the rockbiz mincer was
unable to sour. You see, between 1989 and 1992 Gwen
sang with the Wild River Apples, a combo which followed the downward
trajectory that has recently become all too common among
Glasgow bands.
Major-league record deal (with Chrysalis), minor-league track record (one
single released in two years), then abrupt
relegation to pop's non-league hinterland. Gwen recalls how the band members
reacted.
''We were three weeks into a four-week UK tour when we were told to come
home because the label wasn't going to finance us
anymore,'' says Gwen. ''The label had been sold and there were a new set of
people at the top. We played for the label's new
hierarchy in King Tut's, and when we came off the stage we knew we'd done a
really good gig. So of course about a week later
Chrysalis dropped us.
''I was 19 and very naive. I really didn't understand the music business
at all. The music business was champagne and flights
to London. The music business meant wasting lots of time and money recording
things -- having endless hassles over getting the
right producer and the right studio -- and then discovering that the first
rough demos you'd done sounded better.
''The record business was people making your mind up for you about
everything. Record company people and your managers. It was
about being pampered and being told how to look and what to wear.
''It was people saying 'You're great, you're beautiful'. And suddenly the
next day the same people didn't want you at all, and
they said 'Goodbye' and became your greatest enemies. 'What was all that?'
was the only question I could ask myself when it was
over. Two years of everyone speaking about you, but never speaking to you.''
Soon afterwards rockbiz tongues were set a-wagging again when Gwen and two
other Wild River Apples formed Eden. Laudatory
words failed to turn into concrete offers, however, and Gwen's musical
career seemed set to be a brief as well as accidental
one.
''Singing wasn't what I'd had in mind as a job at all. I'd actually been a
trainee florist before the Wild River Apples. But
thanks to my mum I'd always sung as a child at home . . . I remember being
six or seven, holding a clothes peg as a mike and
singing Billie Jo Spears' Silver Wings and Golden Rings to my granddad.
''My mum was a big Billie Jo Spears fan . . . Blanket On The Ground is
still the song she does at weddings. My mum had wanted
to be a singer, in fact, but it wasn't to be in her day. Your route was
wife-and-mother in Uddingston. At 11 or 12 I was singing
in my school's Gaelic choir -- I won a solo competition at the Mod in Perth
once. I was coached in the sound of the words, but I
never understood anything I was singing.
''Anyway, after the Wild River Apples and Eden, I gave up singing
completely. I still wanted to sing, but I didn't like what
seemed to go with it, and I didn't know there was any way you could do it
yourself without the major labels.
''I got a job in the bar of Glasgow's Tron Theatre . . . and one day in
came James Grant.'' Love And Money's languidly-coiffed
main-man not only offered Gwen work as a backing singer, he also introduced
her to her current Sugartown foil and songwriting
partner, Douglas McIntyre.
Additionally, Gwen's voice will soon be heard on the movie soundtrack
jointly composed by Grant and keyboards ace Paul
McGeechan for David Hayman's The Near Room, due to preview at the GFT on
August 18, prior to Edinburgh Film Festival screenings
on August 20 and 22.
''With Love And Money I actually found myself singing again. Because with
the Wild River Apples it had been about being
upfront, and projecting this angry, gritty vocal style. When Douglas one day
played me these songs he'd written over the years,
I found what I wanted to do and saw how to do it at the same time.''
Sugartown's progress over the last two years has sadly not been as quick
and easy. ''I'm still working day-to-day in the Tron
bar, which maybe explains why the LP was recorded for just #2000, using a
lot of favours in the studio from people like Paul
McGeechan, drummer Gordon Wilson, and bassist Doc, as well as the McCluskey
Brothers.
''It would be nice to have a bit more money for the next one, so it could
sound a little less low-key. The next one, which we
hope to record in November, will definitely be bigger and better. But Marina
don't have much money, and we've had to do a lot of
the work of marketing it and selling it in Britain ourselves.
''That's what makes the CD more expensive than we'd like . . . it's great
when people come in the Tron bar and say 'Wow, it's
you! I've got your LP!', but I look at Swimming In The Horsespool in record
shops and think '#13 for two unknowns from
Glasgow?'''
Shush now, Gwen! Your vocal purity and McIntyre's grainy, uninsistent
melodies are worth twice the price. Moreover, you are
one of those rare vocalists who plainly knows the bittersweet verities
whereof you sing.
* Sugartown can next be seen live on August 22 during the Edinburgh
Festival when they play at the Fringe Club in Teviot Row.
Three days later the band supports Lorna Brooks at King Tut's in Glasgow.

LEGAL aid netted one Scots law firm more than #3m in 1994/95, it was
revealed yesterday.
However, both the Scottish Legal Aid Board and the Law Society of
Scotland said they were not concerned by the amount earned by only one
law company.
Presenting the board's annual report in Edinburgh, chairwoman Ms
Christine Davis said she did not find the figure worrying or surprising,
given the level of business conducted by certain firms.
The name of the company, which earned nearly double its nearest rival,
was not disclosed.
The firm topped a league table of 10 firms -- published by the board
for the first time -- which each earned more than #1m in legal-aid fees
during the year. The 10 companies account for 13 per cent of legal- aid
payments made in 1994/95.
Ms Davis said a policy decision had been taken not to name the
companies involved.
''We are not in the business of advertising specific firms. The firms
would see us as handing out sensitive commercial information about their
organisation.''
One of Scotland's biggest law firms, Ross Harper and Murphy, later
admitted it could be one of the top legal aid earners.
A spokesman said: ''We are certainly up there with the top two or
three firms but I cannot confirm our position, as these figures released
today do not equate with our figures.
''However, in footballing terms, we certainly would qualify for Europe
this year.''
Law Society president, Mr Alan Boyd, also admitted he was not
surprised by the #3m collected by only one firm.
''The firm will tend to be a firm with a large number of partners and
branch offices dealing with hundreds of cases each year. There is no
suggestion from the board that any of these firms are in any way abusing
the system.''
However, he expressed concern at the large numbers of people unable to
proceed with court actions after being granted legal aid and called for
more Government cash to be invested in the justice system.
''In the last year in the sheriff court alone, 2888 cases did not
proceed after an offer of legal aid. Clearly most of those cases must
involve people in a contribution and who, for one reason or another,
could not afford to do it,'' he said.
Mr Boyd said the report showed a 20% increase in the number of legal
aid cases unable to proceed in the sheriff court alone.
He blamed new rules, introduced in 1993, for the rise and said the
society had warned this would be the result. He called for the
Government to review legal-aid funding to allow cases deemed worthy by
the Scottish Legal Aid Board to proceed.
The board's report also revealed spending on legal aid has almost
doubled in five years. Some #132.1m was handed out in 1994/95, compared
with #67.7m in 1990/91.
Ms Davis expressed concern about the costs of individual cases and
revealed the Legal Aid Board was monitoring the reasons for the increase
and examining ways of controlling costs.
However, she warned of close scrutiny of lawyer's accounts.
''While the great majority of solicitors earn their fees legitimately
and provide an excellent service to their clients, a small minority may
be finding ways of abusing the system.
''We will continue to take all steps open to us to ensure that
taxpayers' money is not abused.''

THERE is an astonishing wee catch-all for doing awful things like
sacking people, sticking on the Dan-Mac, giving out the jotters, sending
you the old P45, and in the past employers and their representatives
were wont to give you a reason, such as ''you are a thieving little thug
who has been funnoot wae yer hauns in the till''.
These were good enough reasons in them days but occasions occurred
when they were hardly reasons at all. My first job on leaving school was
in a shoe shop in Argyle Street in Glasgow. After a fortnight I was
sacked by the area manager who spoke in a Yorkshire accent and scared me
quite a lot.
About eight months later I encountered Eric in a shoe shop where I was
buying shoes and in which he was, as he had been before, manager. Eric
was horribly apologetic and explained why I had been surplus to
requirements. It was Eric's policy upon the appointment of every third
new boy employed to stick his mitt into the seed-box and thus blame the
deficit upon the new lad. In short, Eric was practically Noah Claypole
and I was practically Oliver Twist.
Sticking the bunches of fives into the silver and gold is yet done but
is, if expertly done today, hardly discernible. Look at banks and
British Telecom and all these capitalists which the Labour Party is
getting money from this weather and if they are not they should for what
they are absolving the guilt of these sinners. This sentence is getting
a bit too convoluted even for me.
Let me go back to the start. The catch-all for sacking people is to
explain that while you have been a satisfactory employee, you have an
''attitude problem''. Thus it was that a young girl whom I had in fact
recommended as a waitress was given the heave in a hotel which I
frequent for luncheon most days of the week. She had, according to the
manageress an ''attitude problem''.
Now it may well be that the girl, a lassie from up in the Highlands
and a student, was not cutting the mustard: I am not in charge of
running Tennant and Caledonian pubs and hotels after all. But the only
attitude problem I can discover in this well-known Tennant and
Caledonian hotel in the South Side of Glasgow has been that of Tennant
and Caledonian.
The hotel was once run by a couple called Robin and Gay Graham and was
very cheerful indeed. It was bought over by a Celtic sort of chap whose
first move was to sack bar staff and lower the wages for most of the
workers. Tennant and Caledonian has sacked even more and further lowered
the wages because they can. And don't Tennant and Caledonian try any
silly moves about writing to this blatt because it is all true.
Here is another attitude problem. I telephoned a black cab from a pub
and it turned up. I spoke to the driver and went back in to collect my
bag. Less than 30 seconds later I came back out to discover the black
speeding away. Myself and my colleague were a touch surprised. And it
wasn't the taxi driver who was at fault: it was the two traffic police
on the motorcycles who had told him that he was illegally parking.
The police must have seen the taxi draw up there, seen myself and my
colleague signify that we would be out soon, seen us both emerging. But
the traffic fascists shoved him away. Later they became at first
supercilious and then faintly abusive when I drew the fact to their
attention that the driver had lost a fare and we had lost a journey.
Polis. Gestapo on bikes. Is that an attitude problem? Whose attitude?
I have many friends in the police and try very hard to support them.
Just ask the Police Federation about me. Just over a year ago I found
myself in difficulty in the street with a member of the public who had
seen a TV programme of mine and was determined to express a drunken
opinion of my inadequacies.
It became very fraught and a young policeman and policewoman
intervened. My admiration for their tact, decency, and patience, and I
may say intelligence is dancing positive polkas in my mind. I telephoned
Aikenhead Road Police Station to say so, and so did my little companion,
wee George Quar, the top telly chef, because they were great, they
polis. Doubtless they will be discovered to have an attitude problem.
An attitude problem is a lovely catch-all. There is a phrase: ''Women
with Attitude''. I know what attitude now means. No I don't. I'd get the
sack if I did.

THE mother of murdered Renfrewshire man, Kenneth Greenlees, 24,
yesterday made an impassioned appeal for information from the public to
help capture his killer, and claimed her son's death was not related to
the Paisley drugs war.
Mrs Ellen Greenlees, of Dundonald Avenue, Johnstone, said at
Strathclyde Police headquarters in Glasgow that she remained convinced
the reasons behind the shooting of Kenneth last Saturday night lay
within the family's own housing scheme.
She went on to launch a bitter attack on the BBC Panorama programme
broadcast on Monday night, in which Kenneth was directly linked to the
running drugs war in Paisley, despite pleas to the BBC from the family
that he was not.
The programme makers filmed Kenneth Greenlees being treated in the
casualty department of Royal Alexandra Hospital, in Paisley, for
horrific slash injuries four weeks ago, then concluded the programme
with his murder less than 24 hours before the broadcast.
A spokesman at Panorama said last night that the programme makers had
been filming in the hospital with consent when Mr Greenlees was brought
in. They asked if he could be filmed, making it clear that the programme
was about drugs, and he consented on the grounds that he was not
identified.
He had never, although given the opportunity, withdrawn that consent,
although his mother had asked the programme not to use the material. The
spokesman pointed out the problems that would arise if any third person
could request the withdrawal of material, despite the subject himself
not having done so.
They had stuck by their promise of not identifying Mr Greenlees by
obscuring his face but the episode had been kept in the programme as an
example of the violence facing casualty surgeons at Paisley.
Mrs Greenlees' view, however, appeared to find backing from the police
officer in charge of the murder inquiry. Detective Superintendent Bill
Gordon, head of Paisley CID, said he would not answer questions on the
nature of the fatal gunshots and added that there appeared to be no
connection between the killing and the other inquiries going on in
Paisley.
He wants to speak to three local boys aged between 10 and 14 who were
believed to be in the park where the shooting took place that evening.
Asked whether her son had had enemies, Mrs Greenlees said: ''Kenny did
have a few enemies but the circumstances leading up to this on Saturday
night seem to be mystifying.''

FOUR into three won't go was the pat explanation advanced by John
Robb, chairman designate of the soon-to-be-merged-and-privatised British
nuclear company, for his abrupt sacking last week of James Hann,
chairman of Scottish Nuclear for the past five years.
Robb had three places -- two deputies' chairs, and a group chief
executive role -- to fill in the new holding company's board and four
candidates -- the existing chairmen and chief executives of both Nuclear
Electric and Scottish Nuclear -- to choose from.
On the grounds of age and technical knowledge of the industry,
according to Robb (59), James Hann (62) was the one who had to go. So,
on only their second meeting, he called Hann to London and told him so.
John Collier (60), chairman of Nuclear Electric gets his promised place
as one deputy chairman. Robin Jeffrey (56), chief executive of Scottish
Nuclear, becomes the second deputy chairman. And Dr Robert Hawley (59),
chief executive of Nuclear Electric, becomes chief executive of the
combined group.
I was sorry not to be able to hear Robb's gloss on the affair in
person, when he mounted a damage limitation exercise for journalists in
Edinburgh on Monday evening. As he was speaking I was still on my way
back from holiday.
But, from all that I've read of what he had to say and what I've been
able to piece together of what actually happened last week, that gloss
is peeling rapidly before it's had time to dry.
Hann's enforced departure and the appointment of Hawley and Nuclear
Electric finance director Michael Kirwan as the two most powerful
executive directors in the merged venture make this look, more and more,
like the straight takeover of Scottish Nuclear that Nuclear Electric
planned from the very start.
Jeffrey is, effectively, in a non-executive role at group level
although he will continue to run the subsidiary Scottish Nuclear
business. He is now outnumbered where it counts. The future strategic
direction of British Nuclear, or whatever they eventually decide to call
the privatised generator, will be dominated by Nuclear Electric
thinking.
Robb, after a lifetime in the toiletries, food, and pharmaceutical
businesses with Beecham and Wellcome, has everything to learn about the
complex nuclear industry before it is sold next year. His charge that
Hann lacks technical knowledge of nuclear power was a cheap, shabby, and
unwarranted slur on a man who, for five years, has worked tirelessly to
master the main strategic issues facing the sector.
To my certain knowledge, Hann has personally played a leading role in
the slow rehabiliation of nuclear's reputation, post-Chernobyl, with a
sceptical and frightened public. And it was Hann who pushed the dry
store initiative for spent fuel at Torness which eventually forced
British Nuclear Fuels to renegotiate its reprocessing contract with the
Scots and save SN a lot of money.
Hann is not a nuclear engineer and has never claimed that kind of
technical expertise. But throughout his chairmanship he has not only
helped transform Scottish Nuclear's balance sheet, he has challenged the
politicians to face up to the main strategic energy issues -- issues
which market forces alone cannot hope to answer -- and develop policies
which will deal with the environmental consequences of burgeoning global
energy demand.
At a time when boardroom greed is under an intense spotlight, the
Scottish Office has been getting a genuine bargain for the #45,498 basic
salary it paid Hann last year for his three days a week. But his message
sometimes ruffled ministerial and mandarin feathers. They did not like
his repeated calls for an integrated energy policy, especially when
their own agenda was to abolish the Department of Energy.
I sometimes asked Hann if he wasn't pushing his luck, speaking out as
he did. I last asked him that question earlier this year when he mounted
a vigorous, even passionate, campaign to have Scottish Nuclear
privatised as a separate concern.
It was, he always replied, his job to tell things as he saw them. And
provided he made his views -- no matter how uncomfortable they might be
for his audience -- known with professionalism and courtesy, what should
he fear?
Last week, days before the admirable George Walden was telling his
constituents he is quitting the Commons because politicians no longer
dare trade in the truth, Hann finally discovered the price of his own
unvarnished speaking out.
Perhaps Robb could not bear the thought of a deputy who would not
hesitate to say so if he thought the new nuclear ship was being steered
in the wrong direction. We will probably never know. But it simply does
not ring true that Hann was disposed of because he is too old or short
on technical expertise. If it was all Robb's own dirty work, the new
President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang's supine rubber stamping of the
decision is rough justice for someone who has put so much energy and
thought into the enterprise he was asked to chair.
From a standing start, Hann and his colleagues have created a modern
business, with an innovative ethos, which has run its stations well and
transformed the numbers in its balance sheet. When Lang's predecessor
Michael Heseltine announced the outcome of the nuclear review in May, it
was made crystal clear by the Lang-run Scottish Office that Hann would
become one of the two deputy chairmen in the merged company.
That promise has been broken. How many more broken promises will
follow? This week Robb was insisting that locating the corporate office
of the merged company in Edinburgh was a Nuclear Electric, not a
Scottish Office, idea. But is it, in Angus Grossart's telling 1980s
phrase, another example of the ''beads to the natives'' approach to
soothing Scottish concerns about the loss of independence of yet another
indigenous company?
If the expatriate Robb forsakes Sunningdale and he, Hawley, and Kirwan
buy principal homes north of the Border to back up their stated
attachment to an Edinburgh corporate base, we sceptics may begin to see
something more than baubles in their outstretched hands. But after the
way Hann has been treated, what I still see are beads.

<HEADLINE>Attack vet denies disgraceful conduct</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977174773</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SCOTTISH vet told a disciplinary hearing in London yesterday that he
had been very drunk when he kicked a policeman last September,
fracturing his knee.
William Kerr McNeil, 41, of Aberdour, Fife, who was later fined #150
and ordered to pay #100 compensation to the officer, who is still off
work, appeared before the disciplinary committee of the Royal College of
Veterinary Surgeons.
The committee found that the offence rendered him unfit to practise
veterinary surgery. However, an order will not be made until the
conclusion of another hearing currently taking place.
McNeil, of Livingston Lane, Aberdour, who is representing himself,
denies five charges of disgraceful conduct in a professional respect.
The hearing was told that, last August, Mrs Grace Diamond's dog,
Pooch, was operated on to have a lump removed. When Mrs Diamond, of 45
Dollar Crescent, Kirkcaldy, returned that evening to collect Pooch, she
said the dog was in a cage on the floor, lying on a dirty rag.
Mrs Diamond claimed that McNeil's speech was slurred and there was a
smell like vodka around him.
The family then took the dog to another vet, in Kirkcaldy. Mrs
Patricia Canning was holding evening surgery at Equipet when Pooch was
brought in. She confirmed the dog's abdomen wound was ''gaping open''.
The stitches that were still in were not knotted and, when they were
removed, a blood clot was found underneath. Mrs Canning said she
re-anaesthetised Pooch, cleaned her wound, removed the blood clot, and
re-stitched her.
''There were gaps in the wound -- it was improperly stitched. She was
not clipped properly and there was post-operative haemorrhaging,'' she
told the hearing.
Giving evidence, McNeil said that 15 minutes after he had operated on
Pooch, she was sitting up and looking around. He said he left her on a
clean blanket in the recovery cage to sleep off the anaesthetic.
''Prior to Mrs Diamond coming to pick her up, I had an incident with a
cat that left me shaken and I had a brandy to control my nerves, but I
was sufficiently in control,'' he said.
Claiming that Pooch was in a fit condition to go home, he said it was
not unusual for stitches to become loose.
The hearing continues today.

I NOTE that, in among the already rather tedious posturing, Michael
Forsyth supports rail privatisation ''as a way to improve services not
as a way of diminishing services''. With hand on heart and eye straight
to camera, he declares it to be ''in the interest of the taxpayer''.
Since his new special adviser has not yet had time to move into St
Andrew's House, we must assume that these are the wee man's own thoughts
on the matter. They are a lot more informative than all the purrs of
consensus put together.
I don't suppose Mr Forsyth has yet had time or inclination to survey
how the preparations for rail privatisation are already affecting
Scotland's interests. Even less will he want to know too much about the
contents of the Select Committee on Transport's latest report on
''Railway Finances''.
Under the chairmanship of that well-known revolutionary, Sir Paul
Channon, a former Tory transport secretary, this all-party committee
reached the unanimous conclusion that ''the privatisation process
appears likely to result in an increase in public funding of about #500m
to #700m a year''.
It is, even when translated into Tory-speak, difficult to see how this
increase in public expenditure can be ''in the interest of the
taxpayer''.
There is, however, a crucial qualification to the report's
conclusions. They prefix their questioning of whether this huge increase
in public expenditure can be justified, to pay for privatisation, with
the words: ''Assuming the level and quality of service remain
substantially unchanged . . .''
And that, of course, is a very unsafe assumption. Indeed it is crystal
clear that if, as previously maintained, the Tories intend that rail
privatisation should lead to a reduction, rather than increase, in
subsidy from the taxpayer, then the only way to achieve that aim can be
through massive surgery to the network.
So Mr Forsyth and his colleagues should not be allowed to get away
with easy answers. Do they now accept or reject the committee's
findings? If they accept them, do they intend to shell out an extra
#500m-#700m per year as a price worth paying for the dogma of
privatisation? If not, how will the deficit be met?
At present an exercise is going on to determine the passenger service
requirement for ScotRail. We are all solemnly offering our views on what
should be contained in the PSR, in the fond belief that it will then
establish a ''minimum'' level of service within Scotland, below which
ScotRail cannot go.
The Select Committee report usefully points out that it will do no
such thing. If the money runs out, then the PSR will not be worth the
paper it is written on. The Government's franchise director told the
committee that, in these circumstances, he would simply negotiate new
passenger service requirements ''reflecting the amount of money
available''. ''We draw attention to the fact that the passenger service
requirements are therefore not necessarily a guarantee of services,''
the Select Committee reported drily.
In short, services will be reduced if and when Government decides not
to accept the extra cost of rail privatisation.
The Tories are still desperate to get two or three of these franchises
privatised before a General Election and any amount of money will be
thrown at them to ensure that they do not turn into instant
embarrassments.
But if the privatised franchises receive more money in the short term,
then this is bound to be at the expense of the remainder of the railway
network -- unless the Government increased the overall amount available
by the #500m-#700m referred to. It might do so up to polling day, but
certainly not beyond it.
The services supported by Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive
and the English PTEs are particularly vulnerable to this kind of
political accountancy. At present they are receiving an astonishing
#200m per year extra so they can pay their bills to Railtrack and
ScotRail.
Nobody can expect that arrangement to be maintained in the long term.
But the alternative, of taking that money away, would now lead to a
collapse of these services. At present these are largely paper
transactions since all the bits of the railway are still in the public
sector. The moment that changes, two private companies will be asking
the PTE for real money -- at a level which has now been grossly inflated
and can only come from central government.
As the Select Committee summed it up: ''It would be regrettable if
uncertainty caused by the new system of funding PTE rail services caused
the level of those services to decline.'' Yet the only safeguard against
this certainty is that more taxpayers' money should be used to subsidise
privatisation.
How does that benefit the taxpayer, Mr Forsyth? He might then refer to
paragraph 110 of the report, which records the evidence of the
private-sector Railway Industries Association concerning the west coast
main line. This, it says, ''is an important example of how the
combination of the privatisation process, the restricted level of public
investment, and the insistence on the role of the private finance
initiative is causing delay to a major renewal project that is widely
recognised as essential and long overdue''. Quite.
Apart from dogma and bloody-mindedness, there is only one reason left
for the Tories pressing ahead with rail privatisation. They need a lump
sum inside 18 months while the taxpayer and travelling public pay the
price for decades to come. That is the cynical exercise which Mr Forsyth
is so ardently in support of, and he will not escape responsibility by
taking refuge on the Fort William sleeper.

THE chairman of BT, Sir Iain Vallance, yesterday defended his
executive directors' pay as he faced shareholders.
The annual meeting followed the announcement that BT is making profits
of #111 per second.
Sir Iain told shareholders at the annual meeting in Cardiff the
privatised company's policy already met all the main recommendations of
the Greenbury Committee. ''It doesn't even rate a mention in the
Greenbury Report.''
He said most increases this year had been around the 3% mark, in line
with other BT managers and employees, and no-one was receiving special
windfall share options.
However, his reassurances on pay were in contrast to union feelings.
Workers complaining of job cuts and low morale protested outside the
meeting.
Mr Denise McGuire, president of the Society of Telecom Executives,
said around 100,000 employees had left BT over the last five years.
Placard-holding employees protested that directors' pay had increased
by more than 500% since privatisation. This was seven to eight times
greater than the pay increases for BT employees, said the union.

THE high summer sun, the sole leone of Sicily, is a curious beast. The
lion sun gets up early, his breath already hot. There is no freshness in
his morning, just a kind of melting calm; perversely, he gets friskier
with the on-shore winds of his afternoon, and we feel cooler.
Before breakfast I'm on the terrace, reading in the shade. The lion
climbs above the headlands of Taormina Bay and glares from the sea,
bringing sweat to my temples. When I lift my eyes I see scorched earth,
primary colours, and the silhouettes of heat: spheres of umbrella pine,
columns of cypress. When I look at the printed page I see images of
deathly cold . . . ''the breath of reindeer, an immense herd,
crystallised in the air'', ''the church stood squat in the moonlight,
its wooden steeple sheeted in ice'', ''we were close up near the mouth
of the glacier and the icebergs were all around us.''
Cold comfort in a hot climate. My holiday reading programme slips down
like the crushed ice and mushed peach of the seasonal granita. This
year, I visit Siberia and Alaska. Last year -- from the same terrace
above the same scoop of Ionian Sea -- I went to Newfoundland, Greenland,
and the Arctic ice-cap. This year I read Lionel Davidson's Russian
thriller Kolymsky Heights and Barbara Vine's castaway chiller No Night
is Too Long; last year, The Shipping News by E Annie Proulx and Miss
Smilla's Feeling for Snow by Peter Hoeg, each with their different
dynamics as gripping as permafrost.
This formula for reducing the temperature in the southern
Mediterranean was discovered more by accident than design, and now seems
obvious: the literary equivalent of reading travel brochures in January.
It's also a measure of the number of successful novels currently
inviting their readers to chill out in and around the Bering Sea and
Baffin Bay. As fiction's fashions go, the Med is yesterday's mare.
What's behind the pack of icy prose? Global warming? Have the holes in
the ozone created a vacuum in the market for summer idylls, steamy
dramas, Shirley Valentines? As life hots up do writers and readers
instinctively seek the shade of the Urals and the cold douche of the
North Atlantic? There is a stale cliche about opposites attracting, but
I counsel publishers to inform their vogue for northern exposures with
the cautionary tale of the Scotsman calendar.
It's well known that the Scotsman calendar successfully presents
scenic views of Scotland's splendours in their seasonal orthodoxy:
snow-covered Schiehallion for the month of January, Argyll rhododendron
for June, arboreal glory in the Pass of Killiekrankie for October, and
so on. Years ago, when I was working for the newspaper, we had an
inventive picture editor who decided to reverse the message of the
months.
Surely, he reasoned, it would warm people up to see summer images of
Loch Etive in January and cool them down to see bonspiels on the Lake of
Menteith in July? The idea was fetching, and the alternative Scotsman
calendar was duly authorised. Potential purchasers, glancing through
their Christmas mindings for absent friends, found arctic Augusts and
fragrant Februarys. Tempers rose and sales slumped.
When it comes to the bit we're made uneasy by the inappropriate; which
is why, when my appetite cools on its diet of fashionably freezing
fiction, I turn with relief to the Sicilian masterpiece of Giuseppe
Tomasi di Lampedusa. Here, is the poet of the moment with the language
of the mood and the code to the landscape -- ''this landscape which
knows no mean between sensuous sag and hellish drought; which is never
petty, never ordinary, never relaxed, as should be a country made for
rational beings to live in; this country of ours in which the inferno
round Randazzo is a few miles from the beauty of Taormina Bay . . .''
Beneath the lion sun I find The Leopard, and spasms of recognition,
tears of pleasurable melancholy cross my eyes. Has anyone ever
interpreted his land or explained his country better than Lampedusa? I
sit, sometimes, gazing towards ''the inferno round Randazzo'' -- fuming
Mount Etna -- in a stupor of inertia, mind empty of everything except
the beauty of Taormina Bay, and with Lampedusa's help get a surface
sense of what it means to be Sicilian.
''In Sicily it doesn't matter about doing things well or badly,'' says
his Prince of Salina; ''the sin which we Sicilians never forgive is
simply that of 'doing' at all . . . our sensuality is a hankering for
oblivion, our shooting and knifing a  hankering for death; our languor,
our exotic ices, a hankering for voluptuous immobility, . . . sleep,
sleep, that is what Sicilians want, and they will always hate anyone who
tries to wake them, even in order to bring them the most wonderful
gifts.''
After 25 centuries of invaders and imperialists, Greeks, Romans,
Arabs, Normans, Spanish viceroys, Bourbon kings, Italian unifiers, and
Allied liberators, people are still trying to wake the Sicilians with
wonderful gifts. Today it's the turn of the reformers, the politicians
and magistrates who have not only set themselves against Cosa Nostra
(Sicilians now post their public buildings with anti-Mafia declarations)
but have ferried new ethical systems across the Straits of Messina.
Italy's fresh scruples have reached Taormina. Sicily's premier resort,
the heavenly hill town which hangs between mountain and sea among clots
of oleander and curtains of bougainvillea, has had a rush of morality to
its civic head. ''Nothing is working,'' moan the locals, ''because
everything must be seen to work blamelessly.''
Worst affected is the town's summer arts festival, the prime cut of
its commercial season. Shoulders are lifted when we ask about concerts
in the Teatro Antico. ''The festival hasn't started at the usual time.
It may not be held at all. There are political and financial problems .
. . they are investigating the finances of last year's festival.''
Say no more. In Sicily, as in much of Italy, it's wise to avoid the
explicit. A few days later, just as mysteriously, the festival stutters
into life; the programme looks valiantly improvised.          Sometimes
you wonder about Italy's new moral climate. The system of backhanders,
financial favouritism and low-level corruption has its own democracy,
and gets things working. If it ain't that broke, is it worth fixing?

A WOMAN exhausted by childbirth in no man's land and an old man left
for dead were found by Red Cross workers among hundreds of refugees
fleeing the captured enclave of Zepa.
The hapless mother fell behind a column of fellow refugees marched
across frontlines by Bosnian Serbs who captured the enclave, formerly a
UN ''safe area'', on Tuesday. She gave birth alone at the roadside.
''Our delegates spotted the woman after she had delivered the child
herself and then tried to walk on,'' said International Committee of the
Red Cross spokesman Lars Lemche.
The old man was found immobile by a river side where he had tried to
slake his thirst, said Mr Lemche, and had been unable to climb back up
to the road to join the crowd trudging to safety from where Bosnian Serb
buses had deposited them.
The mother, baby, and old man survived their ordeal and were taken to
a medical facility in the town of Kakanj, Mr Lemche said.
United Nations officials said at least 2500 civilians from Zepa had
been transported to Bosnian Government territory by yesterday morning by
Bosnian Serb forces intent on clearing the enclave of its mainly Muslim
population.
Another 2000 were due to leave last night, said UN spokesman Alexander
Ivanko. He added that it was unlikely the Bosnian Serb target of
clearing the enclave of its civilians by dusk would be met.
Mr Lemche said he had joined teams of ICRC delegates trying to shuttle
the sick and the weary along the three mile stretch of road between the
opposing armies. The ICRC is the only body the Serbs will allow to
operate in the zone.
''It was dark, dark, dark. In the headlights, you could see rivers of
people and what strikes you most is the silence,'' said Mr Lemche,
speaking by telephone from Tuzla.
''The people are exhausted. There were no scenes of panic and anger,
just resignation,'' he said.
Most of Srebrenica's men are still missing with worries over their
fate growing after refugees reported summary executions.

The very stability of international order and the principle of
civilisation is at stake over the question of Bosnia
THE UN human rights investigator for former Yugoslavia announced in
Geneva yesterday he was resigning over what he called the hypocrisy of
world leaders in not fulfilling pledges to protect Bosnians.
Tadeusz Mazowiecki said was stepping down after three years in office
after the United Nations allowed Bosnian Serbs to overrun UN-declared
''safe areas'' for Muslims at Srebrenica and Zepa.
The former Polish prime minister told a news conference he had sent a
letter to UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali explaining his
decision, which came after he accused Bosnian Serbs of atrocities
against Muslims following the capture of Srebrenica.
''I believe we have a certain hypocrisy as far as Bosnia is concerned,
when we are claiming to defend it but in fact we are abandoning it. The
same goes for hypocrisy about the protection of human rights,''
Mazowiecki said.
''I hope that my decision will also be understood as a protest against
this hypocrisy.''
Mazowiecki said in his letter that the ''very stability of
international order and the principle of civilisation is at stake over
the question of Bosnia''.
The letter accused ''the international community and its leaders'' of
showing inconsistency and lack of courage in not defending UN safe
areas.
Mazowiecki said there was now a danger the Bosnian conflict could
spread to other parts of the Balkans, fuelled by indecision and slow
responses from the international community.
''But precisely because of that it is especially important to have a
very consistent and common policy of the international community, Nato,
and the United Nations,'' he said.
Mazowiecki, a dissident intellectual during communist rule in his own
country, said he ''cannot continue to participate in the pretence of the
protection of human rights''.
He urged the international community either to protect Bosnian
civilians by force or lift a weapons embargo against former Yugoslavia
to allow the Bosnian government to arm its troops against the
better-equipped Bosnian Serbs.
''I believe the Bosnian people have a right to arm and defend
themselves as long as we are not helping them,'' he said.
Mazowiecki's resignation will take effect in a few days as soon as he
has concluded a report on a visit to government-controlled areas of
Bosnia to talk to refugees who fled Srebrenica.
At the news conference, he repeated accusations that the Serbs had
been guilty of ''very serious violation of human rights on an enormous
scale that can only be described as barbarous'' including killing,
mutilating, and raping civilians.
He said he was concerned that the same fate could befall 15,000 people
from Zepa who were hiding from the Serbs in forests.
''We have been fighting in Poland against a totalitarian system with a
vision for the Europe of tomorrow. How can we believe in a Europe of
tomorrow created by children of people who are abandoned today?'' his
letter asked.
In 17 reports since his appointment in August 1992, Mazowiecki has
accused Muslims, Serbs, and Croats in Bosnia and other parts of former
Yugoslavia of violating human rights. But his fire has mainly been aimed
at Bosnia's Serbs.
Meanwhile in Paris, France, denying media reports that it bombed the
Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale, suggested yesterday that the sonic
booms of jets breaking the sound barrier over the town had been mistaken
for explosions.
French and US newspapers have suggested that France secretly bombed
Pale to avenge the killing of two French UN peacekeepers at the weekend
in Bosnia. Defence Minister Charles Millon reiterated denials of any
raids yesterday.

Washington, Thursday
ATTORNEY General Janet Reno and FBI officials today defended their
actions in the 1993 Branch Davidian siege near Waco, Texas and said cult
leader David Koresh was responsible for all the deaths.
''Faced with what I knew then . . . I did not see another option,''
Reno said of her decision to approve the use of teargas on April 19,
1993, to force cult members out of their compound after a 51-day
stand-off.
A few hours after the teargas was released into the compound, the
building burst into flames and some 80 people died, including Koresh and
several children.
The stand-off began on February 28, 1993, with a raid by the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Four agents and six cult members were
killed in a gunbattle.
Reno acknowledged the FBI could have waited longer but said no-one
could predict what Koresh might do. FBI agents at the siege had
recommended using teargas because negotiations with Koresh for a
surrender were at an impasse and they feared he might try to escape or
order a mass suicide.
''I see no indication whatsoever that the FBI misled me or pressured
me,'' Reno told her weekly news conference.
''We feared mass suicide. If we waited, he would do it on his
timetable,'' retired FBI agent Jeffrey Jamar, who was in charge at Waco,
told a House of Representatives panel investigating the tragedy. Reno is
to testify next Monday.
''They were preparing that compound for an apocalyptic end,'' Byron
Sage, one of the FBI negotiators, said.
Former FBI deputy director Larry Potts said the government made
mistakes during the siege but he added in a statement: ''The FBI
believes, most importantly, that the tragic loss of life at Waco was
pre-destined by David Koresh and that he alone determined the ultimate
outcome.''
Potts said there was proof the blaze was set off by cult
members.--Reuter.

RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin, worried by Western threats to Bosnian
Serbs and a US Senate move to free arms deliveries to Bosnia, offered
his own blueprint for peace talks yesterday.
Interfax news agency said Yeltsin had sent his proposals to members of
the international Contact Group, which also includes the United States,
France, Britain, and Germany.
The blueprint provides for direct talks between both sides in the
conflict. UN sanctions against Serbia would be lifted and rump
Yugoslavia would in exchange recognise Bosnia, Interfax quoted Deputy
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov as saying.
Ivanov did not say when the plan was sent to the members of the
Contact Group.
Yeltsin's plan, however, appeared unlikely to win support in the West.
But at very least it marks Russian disapproval of military actions now
being contemplated by the Western powers.
''It doesn't sound very realistic,'' said one British official.
''We've always believed the Contact Group is the best way of
co-ordinating policy and putting pressure on the parties, avoiding
giving the impression that they can play on divisions.''
Yeltsin has sent his new peace plan at a time when Bosnian Serbs have
seized two UN-protected ''safe areas'' in Bosnia, all but burying hopes
for a peace deal.
Nato countries have warned that their forces will hit the Serbs if
they attack or threaten Gorazde, another ''safe area''.
The US Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to end US
participation in the UN arms embargo on Bosnia despite a veto threat
from President Clinton.
Russia said yesterday it regretted both decisions.
''We are against lifting of the embargo because there are too many
weapons,'' Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, who is now visiting
Vietnam, told a news conference in Hanoi.
''Opening a new flow of weapons will to my mind be tantamount to
fuelling an already burning fire,'' he said.
A Russian foreign ministry statement said yesterday Moscow was also
worried by Nato's decision to launch air strikes against Bosnian Serbs
if they decide to attack Gorazde.
The Nato allies and UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali have
decided that air strikes need to be authorised only by the UN military
commander in Bosnia rather than by leaders of the United Nations.
''We are specifically worried at the introduction of a simplified
procedure (for air strikes) which could have unpredictable
consequences,'' the Russian statement said.
''Responsibility for these consequences fully falls on those who make
such decisions.''
Asked at a news briefing yesterday if Russia would unilaterally
abandon sanctions against rump Yugoslavia in retaliation for the
Senate's decisions, a Russian foreign ministry spokesman said: ''We
favour the step-by-step lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia. But we
think that this decision should be taken by the international community
which imposed the sanctions. Any unilateral step would only undermine
the authority of the UN.''
Spokesman Mikhail Demurin said Russia was considering withdrawing its
peace-keepers from Bosnia if things got worse.
But he said Moscow believed the UN peacekeeping operation in the
former Yugoslav republic should be continued and that the peace-keeping
contingent should even be increased.

THE weather being as hot as it is, the Diary opted for an awayday doon
the watter. Our excuse was to check the progress on repair work being
done on the good ship Carrick at the Scottish Maritime Museum in Irvine.
But first we had to share a train with several groups of maw, paw, and
the weans heading for a day at the seaside. Oh the joys of sharing a
seat with a pre-teen harridan by the name of Dawn who is force-feeding
her wee brother with a packet of Ringos. Oh the joys as the soggy Ringos
fall on to your lap. An icy stare was enough to send the wean scuttling
away to sit beside his mammy. Dawn retaliated by hinting in a stage
whisper to her assembled siblings: ''I think it's Pavarotti.'' Full
marks for knowledge of operatic tenors but no marks for manners.
The maritime museum at Irvine harbour, with its collection of boats of
all shapes and sizes, is well worth a visit. We had a chance to see some
great West of Scotland craftsmen at work. Up on the Carrick, the
museum's shipwrights were recaulking the decks as the first part of a
long process to restore the ship to its full glory.
Down on the quayside no fewer than three civic leaders were declaring
open an exhibition about the legendary sailing ship. The Lord Provost of
Glasgow, the Provost of Greenock, and the convener of Cunninghame
district each had a ribbon to cut.
The Carrick will eventually be the centrepiece of a redeveloped Irvine
harbour which, now that the ICI factory across the water is not making
as many explosives, can become a tourist trap. The potential is
certainly there and that is only the crack in the harbour pubs.
There was Debbie, a travelling person, regaling us in the Marina with
tales of the time she went with the waltzers and the sticky wall machine
from Irvine to Singapore.
Then there was Charlotte, a lovely Irish girl who had been sent over
by Community Service Volunteers from Belfast to do social work in
Irvine.
Another Irvine lady, whose name we didn't catch, persuaded a Sikh chap
who was in for a refreshment to let her try on his turban. As she did
so, the fabric became unravelled and she handed it back with the words:
''Sorry, I've broke your turban.'' As we said, it's an entertaining sort
of place, Irvine.
We also bumped into Brian Donohoe, the local MP, who is fighting a
rearguard action to prevent Rabbie Burns being consigned to the middle
of a roundabout in Irvine.
A statue of the bard currently graces the moor parkland outside the
town. The local council with the backing of the Irvine Burns Club want
to move the statue into town but in the middle of a very busy
roundabout.
Mr Donohoe has been following the usual protest routine with meetings
and laying wreaths at the foot of the statue -- in honour, he says, of
the first visitor to get killed crossing the road to have a closer look
at Rabbie. He has been trying another approach. He has discovered that
the wives of two of the main men involved are opposed to moving the
statue. He has suggested to them that as a protest, they withhold
favours and refuse to co-operate in any Burnsian activities.
And finally, on the Irvine front, we hear that the town will be making
a bid for one of the major Burns events to mark the bicentenary of his
birth next year. Then Irvine input will celebrate the bard's love of the
ladies. A kind of houghmagandie fest.
On yer bikes
A DOON the Watter date not to be missed is the Nashville country and
western music festival which is being held next weekend. Those who know
the island of Cumbrae will spot immediately that the location of the
festival is actually Millport.
But the organisers have gone to a lot of trouble reaching a twinning
agreemeent with Nashville, Tennessee, for the weekend so we will happily
go along with the fantasy.
For the weekend, the Millport Post Office is becoming the Western
Union Telegraph Office. Sundry cafes will become Mexican cantinas. Wee
Mac's shop will become Big Mac's Wagon Train Supplies, offering ''all
the cowboy needs for camping out in Tennessee including tinned beans''.
The Nashville Bicycle Company will offer the opportunity to ''rent the
all-new invention, the bicycle'' and claim ''you will never buy another
horse''. According to the souvenir programme, Millport will be a den of
rough and ready cowboy-types. We will refrain from asking what's new
about that.
* Still on the subject of Nashville, we see that Tina C, described as
a huge new country star who offers ''an intimate hour of beautiful songs
and scintillating stand-up'' is coming to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
We are particularly looking forward to Tina's ballad I Got an Uplift Bra
But an Ache in My Heart.

Srinagar, Thursday
THE women companions of five Western tourists held by separatist
militants in Kashmir issued a fresh appeal today for their release, the
third such plea since the crisis began three weeks ago.
Their appeal tried to underline feelings for Kashmir, torn by a
violent uprising raging for five years.
''We have learned much about the sufferings of the people of Kashmir
now,'' they said. ''We also want peace to return to this beautiful
place. But there is little we can do to solve the sufferings and
problems of the people.''
The women arrived in Srinagar at the weekend but have been closeted in
an undisclosed government guest house.
Heavy rains lashing the area for the past three days were hampering
efforts to free the hostages, officials said.
American Donald Hutchings, German Dirk Hasert, Norwegian Hans Ostro
and Britons Paul Wells and Keith Mangan were abducted near Pahalgam, 55
miles from Srinagar, summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir.--Reuter.

Jerusalem, Thursday
ISRAELI and PLO officials said today that talks on expanding
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank which were suspended after an
Islamic militant suicide bomber killed six Israelis would resume on
Sunday.
Chief PLO negotiator Ahmed Korei said an agreement on the time and the
venue was reached at a meeting yesterday between himself and chief
Israeli negotiator Uri Savir, director-general of the Israeli foreign
ministry.
Korei said the venue would be near the Israeli Red Sea port of Eilat.
''It was decided at this meeting that the talks will resume with all
intensity and for all the working groups and committees on Sunday,''
Korei told Israel Radio's Arab language service in a telephone interview
from Amman.
''It was also decided that, in principle, the venue will be near
Eilat,'' he said without specifying the location.
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Ygal Palmor confirmed the talks
would resume on Sunday ''in the same form as they were in (the Israeli
town of) Zichron Yaacov'' last week, but said contacts were continuing
on the venue.
Israel and the PLO suspended negotiations last Monday after an Islamic
suicide bomber killed six Israelis aboard a bus at the Tel Aviv suburb
of Ramat Gan.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had said the talks would be
suspended until after the funerals of the victims, which took place on
Tuesday and yesterday.
The PLO and Israel have been at odds over where to hold the
negotiations.
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat wanted the talks to stay in the region to
allow negotiators access to decision-makers. Israel suggested moving
them to Europe away from the media spotlight.
Israel and the PLO missed a July 1 deadline for concluding an
agreement as well as a July 25 signing date. Officials from both sides
had said that differences on security arrangements and water rights were
among a list of 19 points of contention.
Palmor said although there was no new target date for an agreement,
the sides would try to reach an accord as soon as possible.
Arafat press adviser Nabil Abu Rdainah told Reuters the PLO viewed the
next round of talks as a test of Israel's commitment to implementing the
second stage of the 1993 framework peace accord: an Israeli army
pull-out from West Bank Arab population centres and Palestinian
elections.
The second stage of the peace deal should have started a year ago.
Autonomy in most of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho
began in May 1994.
Korei said the PLO still insisted that Israel recognise Palestinian
rights to West Bank waters, including underground and surface water. But
he said it was ready to discuss bilateral and regional cooperation on
the water issue.
* The US Justice Department has requested information from Israel's
Justice Ministry about a Hamas official detained in the United States,
Israel Television said today.
US Attorney General Janet Reno announced the detention of Musa Abu
Marzuk, the head of Hamas's politburo and considered the group's
''foreign minister'', at her weekly news conference in Washington
today.--Reuter.

THE company which took over the private Health Care International
hospital at Clydebank six months ago has promised unlimited finance to
secure the future of the hospital until next year, it was revealed last
night.
The promise came on the same day as an announcement from Abu Dhabi to
send around 80 patients a month to the hospital after a four-hour flying
visit by the son of the Crown Prince to HCI yesterday.
Mr Edward Burke, HCI's executive director of finance and operations,
revealed that #20m, invested by the Abu Dhabi Investment Company in the
hospital in February following its takeover of the running of HCI, had
been spent by the end of last month.
However, he said the company had now given an undertaking to finance
the hospital until next year. He said the hospital intended to continue
its recruitment drive and was planning to employ a further 12 doctors
and around 47 staff in the hospital and adjacent hotel.
''There was an initial infusion of finance when HCI was acquired. That
money was spent by the end of June. At this point, a commitment of
unlimited finance has been put into place based on the most conservative
patient flows.''
Mr Burke said the investment company had not put a ceiling on the
amount of cash it would invest in the hospital. He added that the cash
injection secured the future of the hospital until the end of 1996
regardless of the number of patients treated at the hospital.
Sheikh Sultan Ben Klafia Al-Nahyan, son of the Crown Prince of Abu
Dhabi, and an entourage of advisers from the crown prince's office were
taken on an extensive tour around some of the hospital's
state-of-the-art departments.
Afterwards the prince confirmed his office would be sending between 50
and 80 government-sponsored patients to the hospital every month,
starting immediately. He said there had been a perception among
potential patients in the United Arab Emirate state that HCI faced an
uncertain future but he hoped his country's support would change that
view.
''I have seen a lot of hospitals but this is one of the best. We plan
to send patients to this hospital. We believe strongly that we will be
able to make a substantial contribution to the patient numbers required
by the hospital to break even in the next year.''
The Abu Dhabi Investment Company has links with the country's Abu
Dhabi Investment Authority and invited the prince to inspect HCI's
facilities several months ago. Yesterday, Mr Burke said the hospital had
just received 132 referrals from Abu Dhabi.
Over the last two weeks, the hospital's occupancy rate has run at
around 70%, with between 20 and 30 patients, mainly from Turkey, Egypt,
and Greece, given treatment at the hospital. Only 48 of the hospital's
260 beds have been opened.

AMERICAN superstars REM finally touched down in Edinburgh last night
to around 46,000 ''shiny, happy people'' at Murrayfield Stadium.
A spokeswoman from promoters Regular Music said: ''It is a near
sell-out. We have sold tickets to people from all over Britain, Ireland,
Germany, and even Japan and Los Angeles.''
As stadium temperatures rose above 30[DEG]C, water hoses were brought
in to cool down the audience. Extra drinks, including orange crush, had
to be brought in by caterers.
Although Murrayfield has hosted rock spectaculars in the past,
including shows by David Bowie and U2, this was the first in the new
stadium and special plastic sheeting was laid down to protect the turf.
The fans pouring into Edinburgh caused long traffic jams on the M8 and
other routes into the capital. Many overheated vehicles were abandoned.
Nothing, however, could deter the fans, who paid #23 for a ticket. The
first of them started arriving with their picnics at 3pm.

Papeete, Thursday
GREENPEACE today urged a protest flotilla that will sail to France's
South Pacific nuclear test site to invade Mururoa Atoll, frustrating
French military attempts to secure the island for a nuclear test.
''It's easy to go on that atoll and to hell with their territorial
waters,'' said David McTaggart, one of Greenpeace's founders, who with
two other activists spent 12 days evading French security forces in
French Polynesia.
Nearly 60 MPs from Australia and New Zealand will join colleagues from
Japan and Europe in a peace flotilla of up to 100 yachts and small
boats.
They are expected to sail to Mururoa Atoll and the nearby nuclear test
site of Fangataufa in September, when France will end a three-year
moratorium of testing with the first of eight planned test explosions.
McTaggart, 63, who sailed into Papeete, Tahiti, urged boats in the
flotilla to ''have a go'' at penetrating Mururoa's 12-nautical-mile
exclusion zone, but added: ''If they don't, we still want them to
come.''
''All we need is about seven ships and a few inflatables and . . .
they won't be able to handle it.'' He said a concerted international
effort was needed to try to halt France's resumption of nuclear testing
at Mururoa, which he said was ready to disintegrate after more than 130
nuclear tests since 1966.

A GRIEVING Scots father was preparing to travel home yesterday to be
with his family after his young son and father-in-law drowned in a
boating accident near Campbeltown.
Mr Trevor Walker was working in Malaysia for oil firm Valosi when he
learned of the tragedy in which his three year-old son Nicol and
father-in-law Anthony McQueen, 62, died.
A rowing dinghy carrying Mr McQueen, his daughter Mrs Ann Walker, 31,
and grandchildren Nicol and five year-old Leigh, capsized on Wednesday
night off Carradale Point in Kilbrannan Sound, Argyllshire.
Mrs Walker swam ashore with her daughter, where she raised the alarm
just after 7pm. The family, from Edinburgh, were holidaying in Carradale
where they own a cottage.
It is thought the dinghy crashed into rocks and flipped over after Mr
McQueen suffered a heart attack.
The Campbeltown lifeboat and a rescue helicopter from HMS Gannet
joined police and fishermen in the search to recover the bodies.
Mrs Walker and her daughter were taken to Campbeltown Hospital and
detained with mild hypothermia.
They were joined yesterday by Mr McQueen's ex-wife, Dorothy, 58, and
Ann's sister, Sheila.
Mrs McQueen said: ''It's an absolute nightmare. I can't believe my wee
grandson is dead.''
She revealed the family had returned recently from a holiday in
Lanzarote to celebrate little Nicol's third birthday, and said that was
the last time the boy had been with his father.
She said she had spoken to her daughter, who was under sedation in
hospital, and described her as ''shattered''.

DEPUTY Prime Minister Michael Heseltine is at the centre of a libel
action beginning today over a Channel 4 documentary which contained
allegations that a Glasgow company was involved in exporting weapons
which could be used for torture.
Mr Heseltine, when President of the Board of Trade, and two junior
Ministers -- Mr Richard Needham and Mr Ian Taylor -- are alleged to have
written letters saying that disclosures in the programme were contrived
and false.
The libel action in the High Court in London has been brought by Mr
Martyn Gregory, an author and investigative journalist.
It follows letters written by the Ministers about a Channel 4 film,
Torture on Trial, broadcast as a Dispatches programme in January.
This alleged that the Glasgow-based company, ICL Technical Plastics,
was involved in negotiations to export electro-shock batons. A company
executive was secretly filmed in London trying to secure a #2m order.
The programme also alleged that a British Aerospace salesman had sold
8000 electro-shock batons to Saudi Arabia.
The salesman, who has since been dismissed by BAe, says on the
programme that this deal was swallowed up in the #20bn Al-Yamamah arms
contract which Mr Heseltine signed when Defence Secretary in 1985.
Today's libel action will focus on letters written by Ministers.
It is alleged that Mr Gregory was accused of ''scaremongering'' and
that charges made in the programme were ''contrived'' and ''false''.
It is also alleged that the Ministers suggested Mr Gregory had made up
a story.
Mr Gregory is demanding an apology in open court from Mr Heseltine and
his then ministerial colleagues, and substantial damages. The hearing
will be before Mr Justice Waterhouse.

WOMEN'S group leaders reacted angrily yesterday to the four-year
prison sentence handed out to a mother who killed the man who locked her
in a house and raped and tortured her.
The sentence, handed out by Lord Milligan at the High Court in
Edinburgh, shocked the representatives, who thought Mary Chalmers, 37,
should have been set free.
The judge said Chalmers had been in custody since February 3 and could
be eligible for release by February 1997 if she took advantage of help
she had already been given in prison.
Ms Lesley Irving, of Scottish Women's Aid, said later: ''We hoped she
would be given probation with an order to receive counselling. She has
suffered from severe abuse and was clearly acting in self-defence.''
Ms Helen Graham, chairwoman of Lothian Regional Council's women's
committee, described the sentence as ''awful'' and said she was very
disappointed.
''To be honest, I am not surprised. It is typical of some of the
decisions taken in court at the moment,'' Councillor Graham said.
During her murder trial at the High Court in Glasgow on Wednesday,
Chalmers, who has a son, changed her plea to guilty to a reduced charge
of culpable homicide.
She admitted killing Mr John McKenna, aged 65, in his home at Glenacre
Terrace, Castlemilk, Glasgow, by strangling him and setting fire to his
clothing. The court was told she had come to believe he was the devil.
During the trial, Mr Paul Cullen, prosecuting, said he accepted the
plea to the reduced charge because a post-mortem examination had shown
Mr McKenna's coronary artery was reduced to a pinhole and he could have
dropped dead at any time.
Lord Milligan said yesterday that culpable homicide covered a wide
variety of offences, from those that were almost as serious as murder
and required a lengthy sentence, to those which were much less serious.
He believed Chalmers' offence was towards the bottom end of the scale
of seriousness but not at the very bottom.
Chalmers had used a ligature with what was described as ''moderate
force'' for a minimum of 15 to 20 seconds. She had struck some blows and
had set fire to the victim's clothing after the strangulation. These
facts suggested a very serious case of culpable homicide.
However, the matter was not nearly as simple as that. There was a ring
of truth about Chalmers' explanation of what led up to the use of
ligature. He believed she was influenced by drink at the time.
There was no-one present to speak for the deceased but the judge made
allowance for this.
He was prepared to accept that Mr McKenna had made remarks about
Chalmers' son which were provocative in a general sense.
Lord Milligan said he had to deal with a situation where there was an
apparently deliberate and reasonably sustained application of a
ligature. Chalmers was not totally isolated and there was no indication
she screamed for help.
The judge said the sentence of four years would be back dated to
February 3, since when Chalmers had been in custody.
Chalmers had already made progress in prison and if things went well,
she would be eligible for release in February, 1997.
Mr John Carruthers, Chalmers' solicitor, said later the judge had
treated the case in a very compassionate and thoughtful way. Chalmers
now wanted to get on with her life and get the sentence over. She was in
good spirits.
She wanted to get back to her family, hopefully in the next two years.
She had suffered gross emotional violence and abuse in past years and
those things were now at an end.

LEGAL action must be taken to curb prejudicial and sensationalised
reporting of headline-hitting court cases -- or newspapers will be ''on
the downward path'' of the O J Simpson trial, the High Court was told
yesterday.
The ''most outrageous contempts'' had been committed by newspapers
reporting the trial of sisters Michelle and Lisa Taylor for murder at
the Old Bailey, said a QC.
But injustice had occurred because the Attorney-General, Sir Nicholas
Lyell, failed to launch contempt proceedings against the ''tormentor''
tabloids the sisters still want prosecuted -- the Sun, Daily Mirror,
Daily Mail, and Daily Express.
Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC, appearing for the sisters, was asking two
judges to rule that the failure to act was ''unlawful and irrational''
and the Attorney General must reconsider.
The sisters, of Forest Hill, south-east London, were sentenced to life
in July 1992 for the murder of the new bride of Michelle's former lover.
A year later, the Court of Appeal quashed their convictions because
prejudicial publicity made the verdicts unsafe. The court asked the
Attorney-General to consider bringing contempt proceedings against the
newspapers involved.
But no action was taken, but the sisters were allowed judicial review.
Mr Robertson told the court: ''Unless this kind of contempt is
prosecuted we will be on the downward path of the O J Simpson trial,''
with the press commenting, as opposed to reporting, during trials.
He referred the court to an article which appeared in the South London
Press during the trial, saying that the alibi of Michelle Taylor had
been torn to shreds by her best friend in the Old Bailey.
''That is the most outrageous contempt,'' said Mr Robertson .
The Sun had carried an article headlined ''Cheat's Kiss'', in which a
still photograph taken from a wedding video showed Michelle kissing the
murdered woman's husband. The video showed it to be the quickest of
pecks on the cheek, said Mr Robertson, but the Sun and others made it
look like a deep kiss.
The hearing continues.

Paris, Thursday
THE first two serious clues in the bombing of a Paris underground
train pointed police in the direction of Algerian Muslim fundamentalists
today, but investigators voiced extreme caution.
A key witness, an off-duty policeman, has described two Arab-looking
men who behaved suspiciously in the fatal carriage and got off at the
last minute at the previous station before the bomb blew up, police
sources said.
Initial forensic details of the relatively primitive bomb packed into
a cooking gas canister, a technique used by Algerian extremists, also
increased suspicion of a fundamenalist link.
Seven people were killed and 84 wounded in Tuesday's blast in a
rush-hour regional express train at the Saint-Michel Metro station in
the heart of Paris. Twenty-five people were still in hospital today.
A second witness described seeing the two Arab-looking suspects
leaving the train at the Chatelet-les-Halles station and one of them
making an obscene gesture.
But a senior investigator said it was premature to jump to conclusions
and police were being extremely cautious.
There has been no serious claim of responsibility and there were about
30 prime witnesses whose recollections would have to be studied, he
said.
Police switchboards were jammed with about 200 callers after the
government offered a million-franc (#140,000) reward for information
leading to the bombers' arrest.
The Paris public transport authority said video surveillance cameras
on platforms were not systematically connected to recorders so there was
no film of the platform or the train.
Today, Justice Minister Jacques Toubon reiterated that possible
suspects might include Bosnian Serbs as well as Islamic fundamentalists.
But in their stronghold of Pale, Bosnian Serb authorities denied that
Serbs were responsible.
A man calling himself a ''Bosnian freedom fighter'' threatened to set
off bombs at railway stations in the German cities of Cologne and
Duisburg today, forcing the stations to be evacuated briefly, police
said.
Searches revealed no explosives and both were reopened later.--Reuter.

Larnaca, Thursday
THREE British soldiers charged with manslaughter were drunk and
dancing in the streets of a Cyprus holiday resort hours before their
alleged victim died, a court in Larnaca was told today.
Witnesses said the defendants -- Alan Ford, 26, Justin Fowler, 27, and
Jeff Pernell, 23, -- had drunk beer, whisky and tequila at a pub in the
resort of Ayia Napa where they were regulars.
They are accused of abducting and killing Danish tour guide Louise
Jensen, 23, last September.
''We didn't know their names. We called them the geezers,'' said
Lefteris Pri, co-owner of the Jasmine Pub in Ayia Napa where the three
were drinking.
The trio deny bludgeoning Miss Jensen to death with a shovel. They
face charges of manslaughter, abduction and conspiracy to rape.--Reuter.

A SEASIDE attraction based on TV's Coronation Street was unveiled
yesterday.
The #3m project at Blackpool has a full-scale replica of the street
and a battery of special effects -- including the ''ghosts'' of Elsie
Tanner's three loves.
Actress Barbara Knox, who plays red-headed newsagent Rita Sullivan,
showed off the extravaganza to the media.
''It's wonderful, a terrific tour, taking visitors from the beginning
of the show to the present day,'' she said.
Tomorrow she will officially open The World of Coronation Street with
veteran actor Bill Roache, who plays Ken Barlow.
It was built by Granada Entertainments and Hotels. It is expected to
attract more than 500,000 visitors in its first year.
Much of the attraction is based on nostalgia, with clips of ancient
episodes at various stages of the tour, throughout which Knox and Roache
will guide visitors via television screens.
Other actors chip in with their own contributions, peppered with the
home-spun philosophy which has helped make the serial so popular.
Visitors see the corner shop as it was when Florrie Lindley ran it in
the first episode back in the black and white days of 1960.
Then, using video technology, the shop is transformed to the way it
was when Alf Roberts ran it recently.
Actor Brian Moseley, who plays the shopkeeper, comes on the TV screen
and will tell visitors: ''Customers come and customers go, but sometimes
I think nowt changes but the packaging.''
The Elsie Tanner display is expected to be popular. Again using visual
trickery, her three loves materialise from nowhere as she sits in her
parlour, smoking and staring into space.
Also depicted is Hilda Ogden's living room, complete with famous
''muriel'' and three pottery ducks and the Duckworths' disorderly
kitchen -- all with sound effects.
Visitors will be able to sample Newton &amp; Ridley beer and barmaid Betty
Turpin's hot-pot in a much enlarged Rovers Return.

RANGERS footballer Ally McCoist could be told by council planners to
restore a perimeter wall at his Bridge of Weir home to its original
height.
A year ago, Renfrew District Council refused the player permission to
erect a 6ft-high perimeter fence around his property, which, he said,
would ensure his privacy.
Now the striker has been taken to task by the council for increasing
the height of an existing 1.4m wall to over two metres.
A report for the council's planning and development committee in
Paisley next week, now recommends that Mr McCoist be given 28 days to
restore the wall to its original height, claiming the extension has had
an adverse impact, and been detrimental to the amenity of the
Outstanding Conservation Area in which he lives.
In a report to councillors, senior planning official, Mr Crawford
Russell, claims the ''unauthorised'' extension was brought to his
department's attention by a neighbour.
He checked records and found that no permission had been sought by the
footballer.
He said: ''The owners required additional privacy around their garden
and made inquiries regarding the possibility of increasing the height of
the existing stone wall.
''They were informed that such works would require planning permission
and that, furthermore, it would be difficult to match new stone with
that of the existing wall.
''They were advised that an acceptable method of screening could be
achieved by planting a fast-growing hedge behind the stone wall.''
Mr Russell claimed the player had ignored two written warnings
requesting him to apply for retrospective permission.
If councillors agree, an enforcement notice requiring Mr McCoist to
remove the offending extension will be served on him. Mr McCoist
declined to comment.

KNOYDART Estate will be put up for sale next month by the financially
troubled jute company, Titaghur.
The man who sold it to the company, Surrey-based property dealer
Philip Rhodes, said yesterday that he was interested in again acquiring
a stake.
The former owner claimed that #140,000 was still outstanding from the
sale to Titaghur.
But the local councillor said that the return of Mr Rhodes would not
be the best option for the community.
The sale was confirmed yesterday by Edinburgh-based selling agents
Strutt and Parker, whose representative, Mr Colin Campbell, told The
Herald: ''We will be advertising the property next month. The market for
Highland estates is quite healthy just now, certainly compared to a few
years ago. Knoydart would not be everybody's cup of tea, but it does
have a very special appeal.''
In fact what was once an 80,000-acre estate has been surrounded by
controversy for the past decade. Mr Rhodes bought 58,000 acres 10 years
ago for a reported #1.2m then proceeded to break it up, selling it off
in parcels. In 1993 he sold the last 16,500 acres to Titaghur for #1.7m.
Titaghur's chairman, Mr Reg Brealey, who was also chairman of
Sheffield United football club, planned to establish a
''Back-to-Basics'' adventure training scheme for socially deprived
youth.
At the time the company employed around 17,000 in six mills near
Calcutta, but was said to be carrying an accumulated loss of #67.5m. It
had also fallen foul of the Indian authorities for being in arrears with
tax and pension returns.
At home things were faring little better. In March of last year
Highland Regional Council's planning committee met at Inverie in
Knoydart and refused planning permission for an adventure school
catering for 24 Back-to-Basics trainees.
In July The Herald revealed that Mr Rhodes was claiming that Titaghur
still owed him the equivalent of #240,000 for the purchase of Knoydart.
Since then there have been frequent reports of the handful of estate
employees having to wait up to three months for wages.
Mr Rhodes said yesterday: ''I have still got inhibitions against the
estate. Some #40,000 is still owed to me and #90,000 to one of my
companies.'' He said Knoydart still had a great hold over him. ''After
all I was going there for holidays for 20 years before I bought it. I
would certainly be interested in being part of one of the consortiums.''
He didn't think, however, that Titaghur could expect anything like the
#1.7m that had been rumoured to be the asking price.
Colonel Mike Reynolds, formerly of the Kings Own Scottish Borderers,
is the managing director of KPL and the man Mr Brealey chose to run his
Back-to-Basics course. He said yesterday: ''Mr Rhodes and Mr Brealey
have been conducting a running battle because they failed to tie down
the terms of the actual sale. That has been half the trouble.
''The estate desperately needs investment to underpin its activities
of forestry, stalking, and boat hire, and Titaghur just didn't have the
money. I still believe the future lies with some kind of educational
establishment.''
Councillor Charlie King, who represents Knoydart on both Lochaber
District Council and the new Highland Council, said last night: ''I
don't think the community would be best served if either Mr Rhodes or
anyone from Titaghur were involved in buying the estate this time. They
have had their time and the community did not benefit.
''There has been some confusion about a community buy-out. Basically
the community appreciates that it could not afford it and so would
favour some conservation body buying it and forming a trust that would
include representation from the community.''
Mr Bernie Evemy, chairman of the Knoydart Community Association, said
last night: ''We want a partnership with environmental bodies. For the
past 10 years others have been running the place. Now we want a say in
what happens.''

The rift over a ''level killing field'' has been widened by the Senate
vote. Dr Tom Gallagher, lecturer at Bradford University, assesses the
issue which has dominated politics in a dirty war
BRITAIN's currently fraught relations with the United States will be
strained further if Mr Robert Dole, the Senate majority leader, is able
to override the President and make the lifting of the arms embargo on
the Bosnian Government firm US policy.
No issue in its 46-year history has strained the Nato alliance as
completely as this one. Not since the 1956 Suez crisis have US-British
relations been buffeted so sharply.
In 1992, Britain was instrumental in ensuring that the UN Security
Council imposed an arms embargo on the newly-independent state of
Bosnia. Critics protested that it was thereby preventing a state,
admitted to the UN and given wide diplomatic accreditation, from
defending itself.
The embargo appeared especially objectionable because the rebel Serbs,
led by Radovan Karadzic and backed by a neighbouring state, Serbia
proper, were committed to a new order based on racial and religious
purity. They faced no arms shortages and were pursuing their war aims by
killing or driving from their homes unarmed civilians.
Mr Douglas Hurd, Foreign Secretary until last month, insisted that
there was no advantage in having ''a level killing field''. This would
only intensify the conflict and possibly extend it beyond Bosnia.
Moreover, it would render impossible the peace-keeping role of the UN
Protection Force (Unprofor), placing its lightly-armed troops in danger
and preventing the delivery of humanitarian aid to more than a million
refugees.
The clamour for lifting the arms embargo increased, however, as the
mandate which the Security Council gave Unprofor -- to defend and
deliver humanitarian aid and to safeguard designated ''protected zones''
-- was made a mockery of by Karadzic's forces.
In the United States, idealism and the weapon of public opinion have
counted for more in regard to foreign policy than in Britain where the
Foreign Office has enjoyed freedom of action in defining foreign policy
goals. The belief that Bosnian Muslims were the victims of genocide and
that the West was blinking in the face of evil crossed normal party
divides.
The Clinton administration, irresolute and contradictory in foreign
policy issues, oscillated wildly over Bosnia.
In December 1993, a resolution passed overwhelmingly by the UN General
Assembly urged the Security Council to consider lifting the arms
embargo. The US supported it, breaking ranks with Britain, France, and
Russia. By the autumn of 1994, it looked as if the White House might
turn words into action. The rebel Serbs had just rejected the peace plan
of the Contact Group of powers on Bosnia even though it awarded them
huge land areas ethnically cleansed of Muslims.
The peace process was judged a failure. Calls to arm the forces of the
Sarajevo Government appeared more plausible since it had raised an army
of 130,000, outnumbering the 80,000 rebel Serbs under arms. It began to
make territorial gains.
The argument that the Karadzic Serbs had seized so much of Bosnia in
the first months of the war that a fait accompli had been created which
the world could never reverse, no longer seemed so compelling.
Frantic transatlantic journeys were made in 1994-5 by Mr Hurd and Mr
Malcolm Rifkind to keep the Americans on side. The President was
informed that Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic, brought to his senses by
economic sanctions, was now putting strong pressure on his former stooge
Karadzic to return to the conference table.
However, when American senators scoffed at the idea that peace could
be manufactured by the Balkan tyrant who had destroyed multi-cultural
Yugoslavia in the first place, British patience snapped.
The US was chided for adopting a high moral tone when it had no troops
in Bosnia and was reluctant to deploy any. Washington critics countered
by saying it was correct not to expose US troops to humiliation and
danger with a flawed UN mandate.
Lifting the arms embargo is viewed as the defining moment in the
Bosnia crisis but it is unlikely to change things on the ground
immediately. Britain and France have warned that they will pull out
their forces, effectively bringing to an end the UN peace-keeping
mission, but many see it as having already effectively collapsed on
account of its manifold contradictions and the disasters in Srebrenica
and now Zepa.
Besides, a pull-out will take many months to accomplish and will
require the assistance of thousands of US troops stationed in Europe.
Russia's lifting of the arms embargo is seen as another assured
outcome. However, the rebel Serbs, able to rely on the arsenals of the
old Yugoslav army, have no shortage of weapons; it is fighting men they
lack as a dirty war, approaching its third winter, engenders war
weariness among soldiers led to believe it would be all over by the
first snows of 1992.
The Sarajevo government knows that it will not be easy to bring in the
heavy weaponry of whichit is desperately short. Without saying so
openly, it has always pinned its hopes on the Western states with troops
in Bosnia taking on the rebel Serbs once they face one humiliation too
many. That point has been very slow to arrive.
In the Islamic world, Malaysia displayed growing impatience when it
announced this week that it would henceforth ignore the arms embargo.
There is even evidence to suggest that notable adversaries like the US
and Iran have colluded on one occasion to ensure that anti-tank and
anti-aircraft weapons reach the Sarajevo government.
The situation is replete with irony when staunch allies feud and
deadly rivals collude over Bosnia. Meanwhile, it is likely that
civilians will continue for months to come to be treated in a barbaric
manner irrespective of what is said or done on Capitol Hill.

SIR Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, held
''constructive'' talks with Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams yesterday in
an effort to break the deadlock in the stalled peace process.
The Government also disclosed that it had held a series of secret
meetings with loyalist politicians in recent weeks.
At one London meeting the province's Political Development Minister,
Mr Michael Ancram, is understood to have met a Progressive Unionist
Party member who has since been held with eight other men under the
Prevention of Terrorism Act in Scotland.
Sir Patrick's 90-minute meeting yesterday with Mr Adams was held at
Stormont Castle in contrast to their secret get-together last week in
Londonderry. It signals that the Government is trying to find a way of
progressing the talks in advance of the first anniversary of the IRA
ceasefire at the end of next month.
Sir Patrick was accompanied by Mr Ancram, and Mr Adams by his deputy
Martin McGuinness. Both sides described the meeting as ''constructive''.
However, there was no sign of a resolution over the lengthy dispute
about decommissioning IRA weapons. The Government insists a start must
be made before Sinn Fein can be admitted to all-party talks. Sinn Fein
says that can only happen as part of a final settlement.
An agreed statement issued after the talks said a wide range of issues
had been covered but had concentrated on ''exploring the way forward in
the peace process in the light of recent events''.
The statement added: ''Both sides agreed the meeting had been
constructive and agreed to reflect on whether further such meetings
might be appropriate''.
Later Mr Adams said the meeting was a sign that the Government now
recognised his party's electoral mandate, and that it should now get all
parties together for similar discussions.
However he said the peace process was still in crisis and that the
discussions had done nothing to break the impasse.
''For all the focus of today's meeting, we have yet to break the
impasse and all of us have a responsibility to do that.''
But he added the talks were useful and a sign the Government
recognised the seriousness of the situation.
He had made clear that Sinn Fein ''had no room for manoeuvre'' on the
arms decommissioning issue which was a non-starter as a pre-condition
for entry into all-party talks.
Mr Adams said there would have to be compromise from everyone for a
settlement but there could be no compromise over weapons.
The Democratic Unionist Party's deputy leader, Mr Peter Robinson,
condemned the meeting as further evidence of ''Tory treachery and shady
deals'', claiming that it provided unmistakable proof that the likeliest
route to political reward was by ''confrontation with the Government and
street politics''.
It was the IRA's force and willingness to use it that had forced the
Government to ''crumble'' and he questioned whether it was practical for
Unionists to rely on normal democratic means ''when the Government
ignores the democratic process, and panders to the terrorists''.
Mr Robinson said the Government was ''forcing Unionists on to the
streets, showing them that they can either keep their hands clean and
daily have the Unionist position undermined, or alternatively mount a
province-wide campaign of action to halt the Government's surrender''.
However, Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist Party's security
spokesman, welcomed the Mayhew-Adams discussions as long as they were
centred on the decommissioning issue.
The recent meetings with loyalists -- two in Belfast with Government
officials and another in London with Mr Ancram -- were held at the
request of the Progressive Unionist Party.
The Northern Ireland Office said all involved had agreed the exchanges
should remain confidential.
The PUP leader, Mr David Ervine, said one meeting had dealt with
prison issues, another with decommissioning weapons, and the third with
the agenda for a series of exploratory meetings with Mr Ancram.
Mr Lindsay Robb, 26, who had been in the PUP delegation for meetings
with Mr Ancram and officials in Belfast, is understood to have taken
part in the London meeting in June.
He is among nine men being held in Glasgow under the Prevention of
Terrorist Act following a large-scale undercover operation by police in
Scotland and Merseyside.
Meanwhile the prison service announced yesterday that three convicted
Irish terrorists involved in a dirty protest had been transferred from
Whitemoor jail in Cambridgeshire to prisons in Northern Ireland.
The three men are Liam Heffernan and Martin McMonagle, both said to be
members of the Irish National Liberation Army, and Feilim O'Hadhmaill,
an IRA member.

Dr Alasdair Macleod, chairman of Lewis Chess Club, obtained partial
international rating.
Earlier in the day, the famous twelfth-century Lewis ivory chessmen
were taken out of their case at Museum nan Eilean in Stornoway for the
benefit of four of the grandmasters. Polgar, Nigel Short, Paul Motwani,
from Dundee, and Simen Agdestein, from Norway, Polgar's closest rival in
the tournament, were allowed to ''look but not touch'' the valuable
chessmen.
The chessmen are on loan to the new #900,000 museum, from the National
Museum of Antiquities, Edinburgh, and British Museum, London, until
October, following a plea from Western Isles Islands Council.

SYDNEY: The dingo, Australia's wild native dog and a feature of the
outback for 4000 years, is sliding towards extinction, a scientist said
yesterday. The dingo, a close relative of the wolf, is being absorbed
into the domestic dog population and will breed itself out of existence
within 50--100 years, research scientist Laurie Corbett claimed.

THE Duchess of York's gynaecologist was cleared yesterday of
negligently removing a young woman's womb, without her consent, in the
mistaken belief she had cancer.
Fouzel Abbas was 21 and engaged to be married when a doctor in
Pakistan diagnosed cancer of the right ovary and referred her to Anthony
Kenney, a consultant at St Thomas's Hospital, at his private practice at
the Churchill Clinic in south-east London.
After a consultation in March 1989, Mr Kenney, who delivered
Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, carried out a hysterectomy known as a
total pelvic clearance because he was convinced there was a secondary
outbreak of the disease.
Mr Justice Gage said subsequent tests showed the mass which Mr Kenney
thought was cancer was a lesser complaint, endometriosis.
The judge ruled that, on the balance of probabilities, a tissue sample
sent to London from Pakistan had not come from Mrs Abbas and she was not
suffering from ovarian cancer.
Mrs Abbas, now 27, and her husband moved to the United States to
escape pressure from his family for him to reject her.
The judge said he had great sympathy for her plight but rejected her
claim that Mr Kenney had not explained to her before the operation that
he might have to carry out such radical surgery.
The judge ruled that Mrs Abbas, who he described as a sophisticated
and well-educated woman, gave real consent to the operation being
carried out even though she hoped it would not be necessary.
The judge rejected her allegation the surgeon's decision to carry out
the hysterectomy was negligent.
He added he did not think Mr Kenney should have been so suspicious of
the pathology report as to doubt its reliability.
The judge declared: ''The facts which emerge from this case show that
Mrs Abbas has been the victim of a tragic mistake but in my opinion no
legal liability for that mistake can be attributed to Mr Kenney.''
Mrs Abbas's lawyers said an appeal would be considered.

MILLIONS of pounds are hanging in the balance as scientists race to
capitalise on an obesity gene that could promote dramatic and natural
weight loss.
Successful trials on mice, due to be reported today in the US journal,
Science, made waves on Wall Street when the results leaked out
yesterday.
Two rival companies report successful experiments using daily
injections of gene protein to achieve weight loss of up to 40%; one of
them, Amgen Inc, of California, has paid $20m to Rockefeller University
in New York for exclusive rights to develop products based on the gene.
Rockefeller, which has its own report on a similar study in the same
issue, first cloned the ''Ob'' protein last year; Dr Jeffrey Friedman, a
Rockefeller geneticist, and his colleagues have coined the name leptin
for it, from the Greek word leptos, meaning thin.
Amgen chief executive Gordon Binder said the company hoped to start
preliminary clinical trials next year on humans to test for safety.
Under a ''best case scenario'', a drug could be available in three or
four years but he stressed that much work still had to be done.
Fat is a multi-million pound industry in both senses, both here and in
the US, spawning magazines, slimming clubs, books, and diets. Obesity is
also a serious health issue, implicated in heart disease and diabetes.
A daily dose of a drug which achieved significant weight loss -- on
the basis of making the body run the way it is supposed to -- would be a
Holy Grail for millions. Leptin appears to fit the bill on a number of
counts.
The fat mice used in the studies had mutations of one or both Ob
genes. Those with a mutation in both (ob/ob) were most sensitive to
treatment with the protein. The experiments involved injecting both
mutant and normal mice with the Ob protein and comparing the outcome
with mutant and normal controls.
In Dr Friedman's experiments, the ob/ob mice, weighing about 65 grams
-- about twice the weight of normal mice -- had lost 40% of their body
weight after a month of injections with the Ob protein. After four days,
their food intake was only 40% of the controls'.
Leptin fights flab in two ways, by slowing down food intake and
speeding up the metabolism, so that fat is consumed more quickly.
The experiments also indicated that giving the Ob protein to
non-mutant mice was not likely to make them anorexic. Their food intake
stabilised to 92% of control mice and their weight to 88%.
The same effects were produced when the Rockefeller scientists fed
recombinant human Ob protein to the mice.
''This raises the possibility that the administration of Ob protein to
humans would have similar effects,'' said Dr Friedman. ''The diminished
effect on non-mutant mice makes it unlikely that the treatment has
non-specific or adverse effects.''
This was reinforced by Amgen's findings -- none of the parameters
involved was altered beyond the level observed in lean controls.
In the third study, a team at Hoffman-LaRoche Inc and its corporate
partner, Millennium, is looking more closely at how the protein acts on
the brain.
It is interested in seeing whether the problem in humans is not so
much a lack of the hormone itself but a problem in the brain's ability
to get the message the hormone is sending about fat regulation and food
intake.
''There are undoubtedly many genes that play a role in body weight,''
said Dr Friedman. ''It's too soon to know what the full range of utility
of the mouse research will be in humans.'' he added.

A 12-year-old girl collapsed and died of a suspected heart attack
during a university summer school.
Elizabeth Forsyth is thought to have been taking part in a race when
the tragedy happened.
The youngster slumped to the ground during the event at Aberdeen
University playing fields early yesterday afternoon.
More than 80 other children looked on in horror as members of staff
made frantic efforts to revive her.
A university spokesman said one member of staff, then another, gave
her emergency first aid.
An ambulance arrived quickly and Elizabeth, from Blackburn,
Aberdeenshire, was taken under police escort to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary
but wasfound to be dead.
The dead girl's parents, Stewart, 48, and Elizabeth, 45, said they
were ''in a state of shock and disbelief''.
They were too distressed to talk about their loss but a woman
neighbour in Broadford Gardens, Blackburn, said: ''It is an absolutely
awful thing. She was such a fit and happy young girl, always playing
tennis or out walking the family pet, a golden retriever.
''I cannot believe she is dead. She was so full of life, so very
pretty.''
Red-haired Elizabeth had just finished her final year at Kinellar
Primary School and next term was due to go to Bankhead Academy in
Aberdeen where her brother Gregor, 16, is already a pupil.
Mrs Forsyth works in the personnel department of Aberdeen University
-- across the wall from the playing field where the tragedy happened.
It is understood she was told about her daughter's collapse minutes
afterwards.
Mr Forsyth is area manager with freight forwarding company LEP
International.
A university spokesman said: ''The girl was participating in a
children's sports school. We are all absolutely devastated, it is a
horrible situation.
''It is just not something you expect with children. It is really very
sad.''
''The summer school has been running successfully for over 10 years
and has grown in size due to popular demand. Nothing like this has ever
happened before.''
She said the summer school was run by hand-picked coaches, all of whom
were professionally trained.
Principal, Professor Maxwell Irvine, expressed the university's
sympathy to the family of the girl. ''At this time our thoughts are with
the family and friends of Elizabeth,'' he said.
The three-week summer sports school is run every year by the
university's department of physical education and based at the gymnasium
in the Butchart Centre in Old Aberdeen.
It is geared towards allowing energetic youngsters to ''let off energy
and enjoy a huge range of sporting and leisure interests''.
It is thought Elizabeth had been taking part in a fun race at the
playing fields when she collapsed.

A masterpiece of modern sacred music by Scots composer James
MacMillan, right, finds itself competing for pop music album of the
year, writes Michael Tumelty
SCOTLAND'S leading composer, James MacMillan, has found himself in the
unfamiliar company of luminaries from the pop world as his latest CD,
The Seven Last Words From the Cross, was named as one of 10 short-listed
albums for the annual Mercury Music Prize.
The prize, instituted in 1992 by Mercury Communications and worth
#25,000, is generally regarded to have achieved, in a short space of
time, its stated intention: to be the contemporary music equivalent of
the Booker Prize.
Seeing his Seven Last Words -- a masterpiece of modern sacred music --
lined up alongside the latest albums by groups such as Oasis,
Supergrass, and Elastica, yesterday left MacMillan somewhat bemused.
Speaking from Canada, where he is conducting in a festival featuring his
own music, MacMillan confessed that he was ''very surprised'', and added
that he hadn't heard of the Mercury Music Prize until two days ago, when
transatlantic faxes started winging their way to him.
''I feel a bit like an old, blind mole who has come limping out of a
dark classical hole into a pop-style limelight,'' said the composer.
''It's a marvellous recognition for the piece.''
Company executives at BMG Records, to which MacMillan is contracted,
were ''cockahoop'' at the nomination, which will bring massive
additional promotion to the disc.
The Seven Last Words, commissioned by BBC television and originally
broadcast last year as a series of short films on the seven nights of
Holy Week, has already this year picked up a major award from the Royal
Philharmonic Society.
While the word in the business yesterday was that the selection of a
classical album for the short list might be tokenism, and that it would
stand no chance against the pop heavyweights, there is no doubt that
MacMillan is set to receive an unusual amount of publicity.
The 10 nominated albums are to be packaged and front-racked in 2000
major retail outlets throughout the country in a huge promotional
campaign funded by Mercury. They will be marketed as ''the best 10
albums of the year''. This will take MacMillan's disc out of the
classical shelves and into prominent display. BBC Radio One has already
started heavily plugging the albums.
The short-listed albums were chosen by a panel of 10 judges from 140
entries submitted by record companies. The panel, chaired by Simon
Frith, vice-dean of arts and social sciences at Strathclyde University,
includes Brent Hansen, president of MTV Europe, Ric Blaxill, producer of
Top of The Pops, and Trevor Jones, composer of soundtracks for films
such as Cliffhanger and In The Name of The Father.
The judges' citation for MacMillan's Seven Last Words, which will
accompany all new sales promotion, reads: ''This is a passionate choral
work, Scottish composer James MacMillan's masterpiece -- his most
profound and moving music yet.''
MacMillan will attend the final presentation, which will take place at
the Savoy Hotel in London on September 12, where, with the other
nominees, he will receive a trophy, then await the announcement of the
overall winner.
Previous winners of the Mercury Music Prize were Primal Scream (1992),
Suede (1993), and M People (1994).
The full shortlist for this year's award is: Portishead, Dummy; Oasis,
Definitely Maybe; Guy Barker, Into the Blue; Leftfield, Leftism;
Supergrass, I Should Coco; PJ Harvey, To Bring You My Love; Van
Morrison, Days Like This; Elastica: Elastica; Tricky: Maxinquaye;
MacMillan/London Chamber Orchestra/Polyphony: The Seven Last Words.
David Belcher writes: If you accept the old maxim that a camel is a
horse drawn by a committee, then this year's Mercury Music Prize short
list is an item of fashionable teen clothing unpicked and re-stitched
into a staid cardigan that might find favour with your granddad. In
other words, it's a predictable mix of music-press critical faves and
indie-oriented big-sellers rounded out by a couple of token selections
from genres that the mainstream music business persists in viewing as
quaint and uncommercial backwaters, ie jazz and classical.
Thus Guy Barker's Into The Blue is chosen to represent the entire
recorded output of British jazz in the past 12 months, with oor ain
James MacMillan doing likewise for classical music. Meanwhile, there's
nothing at all surprising about Mercury listings for Leftfield's
Leftism; the million-selling Definitely Maybe by Oasis; Supergrass's I
Should Coco; Tricky's Maxinquaye; To Bring You My Love by PJ Harvey;
Portishead's Dummy, and Elastica's self-titled debut album.
Virtually all of the latter titles featured in every self-respecting
music scribe's hip-list way back when at Christmas 1994. Indeed, the
only element of surprise -- nay, outright shock dissolving into startled
giggles -- is provided by the Mercury judges' selection of Van
Morrison's Days Like This, an album which not even the most dedicated
Morrisonian could hail as more than mildly inoffensive.
Shucks, not that any of this carping on my behalf is intended to deny
that a fair amount of risk-taking, idiosyncratic, newer music is about
to be re-promoted to the wider listening public whose record-buying
habits are not currently conditioned by the New Musical Express.
Indeed, one can but weep tears of gratitude at the thought of the
Mercury Prize's effective promotional powers being employed to assist
left-fielders such as Portishead. Having already wowed the
less-hidebound Mr Joe and Jolene Public in the United States,
Portishead's looped ambient quirkiness may now charm hitherto-resistant
UK ears to the same extent.
This is undoubtedly a good thing. Extending people's notions of choice
and all that. So why do visions of cardigans with unappealing camel
motifs on them float before my eyes? Probably because learned consensus
in musical taste is no fun at all, unlike music itself.

Rangers are having to pay again for Paul Gascoigne's signature -- in
the form of royalties on club merchandising. But while Ibrox insiders
are angry about the amount they may have to fork out there is no doubt
that both club and player are on a winner
RANGERS will have to pay superstar Paul Gascoigne, who cost the club
#4.3m and a reputed #15,000 a week in wages, a royalty to use his
nickname ''Gazza'' on club merchandising. And Ibrox insiders are angry
at the amount of cash they will have to fork out for the privilege of
using the nickname or his signature. They said the financial cut to be
given to Gascoigne's company could be as high as 17.5% from the price of
a scarf, mug, baseball hat, T-shirt or key-ring.
The row has come about because the superstar is one of the few players
in Britain to register his nickname and signature as copyright. Anyone
using it must pay the company, Paul Gascoigne Promotions, of which he is
a director, a fee. Negotiations are still going on with Rangers over
just how much they will have to pay him for the use of either the Gazza
nickname or signature.
One club insider said: ''I feel the amount of money he is looking for
is too much. You could argue that we are helping to market him on our
products. Other top players like Mark Hateley and Brian Laudrup are big
players but don't have such a deal.
''Among the Gazza-endorsed products will be two types of scarf, a
baseball cap, a mug, and a couple of low-cost items like badges and
key-rings. The 17.5% figure discussed is, I believe, too much.''
The royalty, which has been defended by his management team, is part
of the marketing of the football star which will kick off in style this
weekend. It is also an indication of how much cash Gazza-mania could
coin in for both the player and the club. As tens of thousands of
Rangers fans flock to Ibrox this weekend for the pre-season tournament
which features Paul's old club, Spurs, the money men are lacing up their
boots for action.
So far it's only the rip-off merchants who have been cashing in on the
Gascoigne phenomenon with a batch of badly made T-shirts, scarves, and
flags.
Also there has been a boom for hairdressers, with fans asking for a
''Gazza'' haircut. However, that is starting to change. The money men
with the sharp suits, the legal nous, and the marketing statistics are
moving in.
Yesterday Rangers started to sell Paul Gascoigne T-shirts in their
shop for #11.99. Sports goods firm Adidas are set to sign a lucrative
deal with him, shin-pad manufacturer Sondico has a long-term deal, and
others are in the pipeline. He has also been signed up by a tabloid
newspaper and Shoot magazine.
That is just the tip of the iceberg. Football experts believe he will
coin in hundreds of thousands of pounds both for himself and the club
during his stay at Ibrox. One of the biggest sellers will be Rangers
strips with the Gascoigne name.
According to David Links, director of Rutherglen-based Le Coq Sportif,
which supplies replica shirts to 40 clubs throughout the country,
Scotland is about to feel the full force of Gazza-mania. ''Regarding
replica shirts with Gascoigne's name on it, the biggest demand is not,
as you may think, in the children's market,'' said Links. ''It is from
young men aged between 15 and 30 with no mortgage, no wife and no
overheads. They will be queueing up to buy. You will see hundreds of the
strips at pre-season games.''
According to Gascoigne's manager, London-based Len Lazarus, the move
to Scotland will probably open up more commercial avenues than when the
star was at Spurs. Lazarus, who has guided Gazza's career from Spurs to
Lazio, and back to Rangers, said it was the best team in Britain he
could have come back to.
''English fans do not see Rangers as a rival and therefore would buy
Gazza merchandising. A nationwide market has opened up. ''I feel the
marketing potential in Glasgow is even greater than in Italy. There the
culture is to promote and market teams rather than individuals. His
sponsors were delighted when he signed from Rangers.''
He said the player had set up the company, Paul Gascoigne Promotions
Ltd, to register the name Gazza and the Paul Gascoigne signature in the
early 1990s. Lazarus would not comment on the specific financial deal
with Rangers. However he defended the use of the copyright in dealings
with the club and said: ''When the trademarks were registered it cost
thousands of pounds.
''The rule only deals with certain items. There will be a number of
Rangers items on sale at the shop which do not have the Gazza trademark
or his signature. I think Rangers believe they will get value for
money.''
He said Paul had a close interest in the marketing of his goods
because he did not want to see the fans ripped off.
''Paul is concerned when he sees inferior goods sold with his name on
it,'' he said. ''He is interested in the official goods and likes them
to be kept at a reasonable price for the fans.''
He said Paul knew about the problem with rip-off merchants in Glasgow
and backed plans for a crackdown.
When asked if the Gascoigne marketing machine had perhaps not got into
gear quickly enough Mr Lazarus said: ''Remember Paul only signed for
Rangers on July 9. It is still very early days. There was no way anybody
was going to produce licensed ranges so quickly.''
Tottenham Hotspur commercial manager Mike Rollo, who worked with
Gascoigne in the early 1990s when the player was at the London club,
said Rangers could expect a big upturn in business opportunities.
Rollo said Gascoigne's presence at Spurs had meant the home games were
always sold out and around 7000 extra fans travelled to away games. Away
from the pitch he modelled the Spurs kit, made a record which made the
pop charts, and had a Gazzaline where he gave out information to fans.
Football agent Bill McMurdo, who has known the star since he was 16,
said Gascoigne would boost the Scottish game and his name could be
marketed across Europe.
''To me Paul is the biggest thing to hit football since George Best.
He has charisma, charm, and people are drawn to him like a magnet.
''All he has to do is turn it on on the field and the rest will fall
into place.''
Rangers said they realised the importance of Paul Gascoigne to the
club both on and off the field. The club's marketing manager, Brian
Main, warned supporters to be on their guard against counterfeit
Gascoigne gear. The new T-shirts with Gascoigne's name on it will be on
sale over the weekend at the Rangers shop at Ibrox. A Paul Gascoigne
ball at #10.99 and his biography are also for sale.
A shop worker said: ''He's very popular already and the season hasn't
even started. The ball and his biography we have make no mention of
Rangers but they're still selling well.''

As Edzell worries about the future, Dunoon's experience proves, says
David Steele, that fresh ideas come forward
THE people of Dunoon yesterday sent a clear message to the worried
community of Edzell -- there is life after the Americans go home. A
30-year association between the Cowal peninsula and the United States
Navy, through its nuclear submarine base on Holy Loch, ended in 1992
when a combination of the thawing of the cold war and technological
advance, meant that the long-range patrol submarines could be serviced
and supported by bases on the US east coast.
There were predictions of economic disaster and social decline as 4000
servicemen headed home, and 800 associated jobs for local people
disappeared without trace.
Yet a walk in the warm sunshine down the bustling main street
yesterday, with the coloured bunting flapping in the breeze, showed that
this was a community which refused to lie down and die.
Instead the bulk of local Dunoon business people rallied round and
accepted the advice of the experts brought in by local authorities and
Argyll and Islands Enterprise. More than #12m of Government money was
made available to the local economy, but it was made clear from day one
that it was to kick start a resurgence requiring the effort of everyone.
Dunoon's message to the business people of Edzell was blunt. Make sure
the Government weighs in with the money, spend it wisely, and put in a
lot of hard work replacing what has gone. It has worked in Dunoon with
an estimated 756 of the lost jobs now replaced.
Cheap housing has attracted 2000 incomers to Dunoon and a
multi-million pound investment programme has been acclaimed as a role
model for other towns struck by the sudden loss of a key industry.
The Cowal Initiative was a combined effort by the Government's jobs
agency in Argyll, the district and regional council, and private
businesses to limit the damage caused by the American withdrawal.
Western Ferries, whose fleet of car ferries link the peninsula to the
motorway heading to Glasgow, have had to put on extra services to cope
with rush-hour traffic that was not seen a few years ago.
Local estate agent Stuart Noakes said yesterday: ''It took a while for
the town to recover but the market for houses is very buoyant now.''
Tourists are also starting to rediscover a corner of Scotland that was
once shunned because of the nuclear base, and the trip ''Doon the
Watter'' to Dunoon is enjoying a new lease of life.
Morian Fletcher of the Argyll Hotel said: ''We lost a lot of business
when the base closed, mainly through the bar which was very popular with
the Americans.
''When the task force came in to help get things going again here, the
first thing we did was listen and learn. For that reason we have changed
the business and now concentrate more on the food side than the drink.
''My advice to people in Edzell would be to make sure that you listen
and appreciate that the people brought in are there to help. A few of
the business people in the town failed to heed the advice, and now they
have gone or are struggling,'' she said.
Chemist David Mair was less affected by the closure and said he had
always been surprised that the base put less into the local economy than
he would have expected.
''We seldom saw the American service people in the shop, except
perhaps for film developing, as they had their own medical teams and
pharmacy.
''I would say that there were many sectors of business worse affected
than mine -- taxis, pubs, and of course the ladies of the night.''
On the last named, Cowal Enterprise Trust chairman Charles Black
remains a little coy. He said: ''We heard a lot about that over the
years and I suppose you would expect it in what was effectively a
garrison town. But really most of the young single guys went to sow
their wild oats across in Greenock or up in Glasgow.''
Black, who owns a local bakery company, added: ''I supplied the base
and the ships and that represented about 21% of my business. It was a
devastating blow to lose that, but we could not sit back and we went out
to look for new customers.
''Not one person was laid off and now we have turned that loss of
business round into what will be an overall growth of more than 8% by
the end of this year.
''It is important that no-one sits back. The enterprise network will
do so much but their money and expertise is not everything, it is there
to enable businesses to start again.''
The taxi business was among the worst to suffer. At its peak the area
had 160 licensed cabs, giving it the highest per capita coverage in
Britain, But now that figure is around 50 with the lucrative double
shifts a distant memory.
Kent Blincow, a driver in the town for 30 years, said: ''We saw them
come and we saw them go, but they were good customers and now it is hard
to make a living with local people and the tourists.
''Some of the trips were just from the local pub out to the base, but
at the weekends the wheels never stopped turning and times were good.
The town might be doing OK but the visitors are walking far too much for
my liking.''
Morian Fletcher is in no doubt that tourism has been boosted by the
closure of the base. ''There were those who avoided Dunoon because they
associated American sailors with trouble. I can honestly say we never
had serious bother at any time as the shore patrol kept things in order,
and if we had female staff on the Americans were perfect gentlemen.''
There has also been a property benefit for the area with service
housing refurbished and highly popular, and an influx of new people both
to work in the area and to commute by ferry to Glasgow or the Upper
Clyde towns.
Mr Alex Noakes of estate agents W &amp; J Chalmers said: ''There has been
a steady influx of new people and the market is relatively healthy.''
The ferry companies also report brisk business and Alan Bradley of
Western Ferries has seen his company turn a ''skin of the teeth
operation'' in 1992 into a profitable route with increased tourism and
commuting.
There is a romantic footnote to this tale of the peace dividend. Jack
and Catherine Steele met while the North Carolina maintenance engineer
was at the base.
They married 11 years ago, and after a spell in the US, have settled
happily in Dunoon. Mrs Steele said: ''We both had families from previous
marriages but we met and fell for each other. We gave America a try but
preferred it here.
''The only thing we really regretted was that Jack could not get his
favourite soda crackers when the base closed. He used to send to Edzell
for them, but that will stop soon. I suppose we will have to find a base
down south for his shopping.''

<HEADLINE>Fund to help Bosnian Muslims buy arms. Finally in safe hands, a child of war</HEADLINE>

MUSLIMS throughout the world backed their besieged counterparts in
Bosnia with words and action yesterday.
Sensing a breaking in the united resolve in the western world
following the US Senate vote to lift the arms embargo, Malaysia will set
up a fund to help Bosnian Muslims to buy arms.
The Bosnian Arms Fund, to be launched with #18,000, is expected to
draw contributions from sympathetic Malaysians, Nazri Abdul Aziz, an
official of the ruling United Malays National Organisation said.
''Besides helping the Bosnian people to equip themselves with the
necessary firearms, the fund is also to show Malaysia's commitment
towards defending the Bosnians in whatever way,'' Nazri said.
He was speaking as hundreds of refugees from the captured town of Zepa
were streaming into Sarajevo.
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has pledged to supply arms
to the Muslim-led Bosnian Government and has said he wants to provide
Malaysian peacekeepers with more firepower to help the defence against
Serb aggression.
His stand followed an Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC)
declaration that the UN arms embargo was unjust and invalid.
In Kuwait, a parliamentary panel has proposed that the government
donates #25m to Bosnia.
''The money will support the people in Bosnia, to provide them with
food and medicine and other things,'' said member of parliament Adnan
Abdul-Samad.
Abdul-Samad was reported as saying the money would enable the Bosnians
to defend themselves.
Asked if the money was for buying arms, Abdul-Samad said it would be
up to the Bosnian Government to decide how it spent the money.
Meanwhile, in Cape Town, South African police fired birdshot and
rubber bullets at Muslim marchers during protests against Western
policies in Bosnia.
A 19-year-old was wounded in the leg by police fire after a small
group of protesters broke away from the main march and surged towards
the United States embassy.
In Dhaka, thousands of Bangladeshi Muslims attempted to storm United
Nations offices in protest over what they said was Serb-led genocide in
Bosnia. They were turned back by police.
''The world has long played with the defenceless Muslims in Bosnia and
is still reluctant to help them,'' said protest leader Shaikhul Hadis
Moulana Azizul Islam.
The Senate's vote to lift the arms embargo was welcomed by Muslims,
particularly by Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey, who said:
''After three and a half years of choosing to negotiate, we have no
choice but to oppose their military option with our own military
defence.''
However, Western European governments condemned the US vote.
Defence Minister Malcolm Rifkind said: ''It seems bizarre that we
should respond to the suffering of the people of Bosnia by withdrawing
what measure of assistance we can offer them and letting fighting
escalate further.
''The Senate vote is the latest culmination of the split in the West
over Bosnia. If France and Britain pull out, other nations will follow
suit and there will be no point any longer having Nordic peacekeepers in
Bosnia.''
France led other European governments in condemning the vote in
Washington, saying any final US decision to lift the embargo would mean
an automatic and immediate withdrawal of French and other UN
peacekeepers, and the prospect of total war.
Russia said it regretted the decision but added that Moscow would not
unilaterally abandon United Nations sanctions against Belgrade.
Nato secretary-general Willy Claes said in Athens the vote could fuel
an all-out Balkan war.
In Washington, President Clinton said
yesterday the UN peacekeeping force
has one ''last chance'' to survive
and it depends on the strength of the
UN commitment to stronger use of air
strikes.
Clinton blamed the United Nations,
rather than his own policy, for the
senate's vote. He said the UN had failed
to back the threat of air strikes with
force.

LABOUR last night branded the results of a Treasury inquiry into its
handling of the sale of power shares a ''whitewash''.
The Treasury inquiry found ''no evidence of wrongdoing'' over its
involvement in the #4000m sale of shares in National Power and PowerGen
after investigating allegations of insider dealing.
Controversy arose when the electricity industry regulator announced
his intention to consult on changing the price caps on the regional
electricity companies.
This led to a #3700m collapse in the share prices.
When it was announced the Government had had prior knowledge of his
announcement, the Treasury was accused of keeping quiet.

Tokyo, Thursday
ALLIED prisoners of war held by Japan during the Second World War
launched with sometimes tearful testimony today a #440m compensation
claim for their suffering.
Five representatives from Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and the
United States told the Tokyo District Court of ''inhuman violence''
which left them with irreparable ''mental scars''.
They testified on the opening day of a claim made on behalf of 30,000
PoWs, demanding a full apology from the Japanese government and
compensation of #14,600 for each prisoner.
Phyllis Jameson, representing British civilians taken to labour camps
throughout Asia, cried as she told a solemn courtroom of her suffering.
''I was a teenager who was sexually abused by Japanese soldiers. They
punched and kicked me, and the only reason I was not raped was that I
had shaved my head to be less attractive,'' she said.
Arthur Titherington, 73, who joined the British army as a 16-year-old
in 1938, said: ''We were forced to dig in copper mines and if we did not
work hard enough, the Japanese would hit us with hammers''.
Each witness said the brutality left lifelong scars.
''As a result of being treated worse than an animal, I have undergone
several joint operations and I will have to receive treatment until I
die,'' American Gilbert Hair told the court.
Hair runs the US group campaigning for compensation from his home in
Miami.
Martyn Day, a British lawyer representing all the claimants, said the
opening of the trial was a ''momentous day because we have finally made
a direct plea to the Japanese government on behalf of thousands round
the world''.
After an hour of graphic testimony by the five PoWs, Judge Yashushigay
Hagiro adjourned the trial until October 5 so the government could make
an initial response to the claims.
Keith Martin, chairman of the Association of British Civilian
Internees, said the trial was likely to be bogged down for months in
legal arguments on whether international law in the 1940s gave the
victims protection from Japanese brutality.
Day said apart from winning compensation for the PoWs, the group
wanted to use the trial to persuade Japan to change its long-term stance
of ''regret'', not ''apology''.
Japan has repeatedly argued it is no longer responsible for
compensation because the matter was settled by the 1951 San Francisco
Peace Treaty.
Japan's Professor Utsumi Aiko, who is following the case because of
her own campaign for Koreans maltreated in the war, forecast a lengthy
legal battle.
''It is going to be difficult for the claimants to win. Japan's
government has made it clear that it will only give compensation to the
comfort women of the war,'' she said.
The so-called ''comfort women'' were non-Japanese, many from Korea and
the Philippines, put into brothels for Japanese soldiers throughout
Asia.
Titherington told reporters after giving his evidence: ''I know the
Japanese like quotations. So here is one for them to remember: they say
that constant dripping wears away the stone. I am one of those drips
that will wear down the stone of the Japanese authorities until justice
is done.''
Meanwhile, Japanese Emperor Akihito's tour of Hiroshima to mourn
atomic bomb victims today was disrupted by a rare protest as activists
demanded he apologise for the war Japan waged in his father's name.
* A Hiroshima survivor visited 10 Downing Street today to ask Prime
Minister John Major to apologise on behalf of Britain for the atomic
bomb explosion which destroyed his home town 50 years ago.
Poet Yasuhiko Shigemoto, 64, wished good luck to the British former
PoWs suing the Japanese government for their ill-treatment during the
war. But the visit's organiser, Kate Margam of No More Hiroshimas,
criticised Mr Major for failing to meet Mr Shigemoto.
The bomb survivor gave the Prime Minister a copy of his book of poems
and a petition on behalf of 200,000 Britons who have written letters of
reconciliation to Japan. He brought his grand-daughter Yukiko, five, as
a symbol of future generations threatened by war.
''I have asked Mr Major to say sorry as a gesture of reconciliation on
the 50th anniversary of the bombs.'' Mr Shigemoto was a 14-year-old
conscript working in a Hiroshima factory when the bomb was dropped.--PA.

Herald reporter Craig Watson reports from Split on UN moves after a
Croat offensive
PEACEKEEPING forces on the Bosnia/Croatia border are to be bolstered
following the largest Croat offensive in Serb-held territory for a year.
A UN official in Croatia warned that the troop movement was a
''serious turn of events'' which could lead to a wider war in the former
Yugoslavia.
Mr Norris Pettis, chief of staff in the UN mission in Croatia,
yesterday announced plans to increase the peace-keeping presence. UN
forces will be shifted to volatile frontier zones, such as the area
around the besieged enclave of Bihac. A total of 32 observation posts
are to be reinforced from Monday and six more will be created in
conflict zones.
Mr Pettis said force would not be used to hold ground. He added: ''The
key to this will be the compliance of the parties but we will be very
persistent. Our goal is to deter an outbreak of general conflict.''
The UN said yesterday that Croatian soldiers had entered Bosnia at the
Kamensko crossing point near the Livno valley, 50 miles north of Split.
Up to 3000 troops, including Bosnian Croats, were believed to be
heading west into more Serb held areas last night.
A UN spokesman said: ''There has been a constant level of activity
over the last two days. It is a serious turn of events which gives us
great cause for concern.''
Earlier, reports said thousands of Bosnian Serb refugees were fleeing
territory near Granovo in south-west Bosnia. Croat forces broke through
Serb defence lines to within three miles of the town, Bosnian Serb army
sources said.
The refugees were said to be fleeing north towards Serb- held Drvar,
Petrovac, and Banjaluka. Traffic had ceased along the vital road linking
Serb-held Knin in Croatia with Serb territory in south-west Bosnia.
Croatian military sources said the offensive was in response to Serb
shelling of areas in Croat-controlled southern Bosnia and to relieve
pressure on Bihac, which was invaded by rebel Serb forces a week ago.
A similar Croat offensive was launched in the area last year but was
stopped, probably because of the weather conditions.
A UN spokesman said the Croat and Serb forces were thought to be
evenly matched and well armed.
He added: ''The Croats are being brazen about it by going across the
border into Bosnia.''
Earlier this month, the Bosnian and Croatian governments agreed to
military co-operation. UN officials and western governments now fear the
Croatian army will stage a major military intervention if the Serbs look
like over-running Bihac.
The UN has described the assault on Bihac as a large-scale offensive
that could trigger a wider war. Yesterday, rebel Bosnian Muslim leader
Fikret Abdic was advancing from the west and north of the enclave.
A meeting between UN commanders and officials and Nato experts will
take place in Brussels today to work out details on the use of air power
against Bosnian Serbs if Gorazde comes under attack.
The meeting will include French General Bernard Janvier, the overall
commander of UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, Kofi Annan, the UN
secretary-general for peacekeeping, and Shashi Tharoor, a senior
peacekeeping department official.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali yesterday agreed to turn over
to Janvier his power to approve Nato air attacks in Bosnia. When calling
in close air support for UN troops under siege, Janvier can delegate his
authority to British General Rupert Smith, the commander for the UN
Protection Force in Bosnia.
Boutros-Ghali's decision is meant to streamline the chain of command
for more decisive action while at the same time maintain an agreement
for joint control between Nato and the United Nations to approve the use
of air power.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth produced another Tory about-turn
yesterday when he finally admitted the party's legislation on school
placing requests was flawed.
His announcement of a parliamentary amendment in the near future was
welcomed by parents' leaders and Opposition politicians, who hailed it
as an overdue acceptance that the policy created more problems than it
solved.
However, since Mr Forsyth made it clear his change of heart was linked
to the specific difficulties at Balfron High in his Stirling
constituency, he has left himself open to criticism. Before his
appointment as Scottish Secretary, he had actively supported Balfron
High parents in their campaign for improved facilities at the school,
and it has regularly had to turn away local pupils after acceding to
placing requests from outwith the area.
Now, in his new Ministerial capacity, the arch proponent of parental
choice is prepared to modify substantially the legislation which
initiated the Conservatives' attempted reform of Scottish education in
the 1980s.
Mr Forsyth's majority in Stirling was only 703 at the 1992 election,
and his seat -- with its boundaries redrawn, apparently to his
disadvantage -- is a prime target for Labour.
Mrs Ann Hill, president of the Scottish School Boards Association,
said last night: ''This has to be a political move, there is no other
reason for it. It all comes back to Balfron.'' She also warned of
tinkering with the system. ''It has to be all or nothing. If you endorse
parental choice, you have to let parents choose completely.''
A Scottish Office spokeswoman declined to answer questions about the
political aspects of Mr Forsyth's announcement, saying only: ''The
Scottish Secretary is also an elected MP. It is for him to be aware of
issues in his constituency.''
At Tory headquarters in Edinburgh, a party spokeswoman said only:
''This is a matter on which the Government has taken a decision. It is
not a party political matter.''
Earlier, Mr Forsyth had stated that the legislation, introduced in
1981 to give parents the right to choose their child's school, was to be
amended ''to overcome difficulties encountered at popular schools like
Balfron High''.
His announcement came in a letter to the head teacher at Balfron, Mr
James Fleming. In it, he says: ''The placing request system is, of
course, central to the Government's education policies but it was never
the intention that the policy should result in the particular
difficulties which have appeared at schools like Balfron High.
''The steps we shall take in due course will therefore be designed to
safeguard the position of local children moving into an area, while
still ensuring that the greatest number of parents will be able to seek
to place their child in the school of their choice.''
The Scottish Office said the mechanics of the amendment had still be
to be decided.
Labour education spokeswoman Maria Fyfe said: ''It's not before time
but I welcome the fact that he has now recognised the policy caused
serious problems.''
SNP counterpart Margaret Ewing said the amendment would be studied
carefully and she hoped it would prove beneficial to all schools.
Mr Bill Dick, chairman of the Balfron High school board, said he was
''absolutely delighted to see a change of thinking'' at the Scottish
Office and the convener of the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, Mrs
Judith Gillespie, said: ''Mr Forsyth has finally seen the light.''

Graeme Smith looks at the signal redevelopment of Shell's Brent Bravo
operation
TWENTY years after Shell's Brent Bravo platform was installed it is on
the brink of a rebirth following a project pointing the way to future
prosperity for the North Sea.
Production has been shut down on Bravo for 13 months now but within
weeks it is expected to recommence. All this year about 900 men have
worked round the clock in the first phase of a Brent Field operation
which will extend its life by maximising oil production but also, more
importantly, will eventually switch its focus to gas.
The key to the project is to reduce the pressure in the reservoir 116
miles north-east of Lerwick, which currently produces 13% of the UK's
oil and 10% of its gas. However, before depressurisation can start, the
equipment on the Brent Bravo, Charlie, and Delta platforms has to be
changed, an operation which will be completed early in 1998 at a cost of
more than #2 billion and involving 10 million man-hours.
It is what the industry describes as a ''Brownfield'' project -- it
uses existing facilities -- and although the Brent redevelopment is a
rare solution to a rare situation, North Sea companies are now looking
at how they can increase recovery from existing assets and tie in new
developments with platforms already in place.
Shell has another outstanding example of success in the Tern Field,
only a few miles from Brent. When Tern was installed in 1989 a 4.3-metre
gap was left by engineers who speculated the space, a costly commodity
on a platform, could possibly be used for additional risers in the
future.
That speculation has provided a handsome return. Using
state-of-the-art technology and infra-red dimensional surveying, which
gives accuracy to within half a millimetre, Shell's team has managed to
squeeze in 1900 individual pieces of equipment weighing a total of 740
tonnes allowing Tern to become the host platform for Amerada Hess's new
nearby Hudson Field.
It is also quick to point out that this remarkable #56m engineering
achievement, which was likened to fitting together hi-tech Lego, was
completed at 25% below budget.
One of the major challenges on Tern was also faced on Brent Bravo --
the work had to be carried out while the platform continued to operate.
Although Brent Bravo was not producing itself, oil was continuing to be
piped through the platform en route for Sullom Voe.
Before the work could start significant re-routing of the oil from
other platforms had to be carried out, and only a 17-day shutdown was
required to install the new pipework.
The Brent project involves three elements -- to maximise the recovery
of hydrocarbons; to refurbish and upgrade the facilities to extend the
field life and to reflect Lord Cullen's recommendations in the wake of
Piper Alpha; and to reduce long-term operating costs.
No engineering project of this scale has been carried out anywhere in
the world before. It involved 240 miles of cable, 7000 tonnes of steel,
1650 helicopter and 280 supply vessel movements, and 34 heavy lifts --
19 taking equipment off and 15 to install.
On each of the platforms the new equipment will mean a 50% cut in jobs
and on Brent Charlie, for example, the crew will drop from 279 to 140.
But Shell stresses that only by making more projects viable can
employment be safe-guarded.
''The Brent redevelopment is a landmark in world oil history,'' said
Dr Chris Fay, managing director of Shell Expro. ''It is crucial that the
UK should extract the maximum value from its North Sea resources.
''It will be increasingly important to the economy to find ways of
extending the life of existing fields. The UK has 31 billion barrels of
oil and natural gas liquids, and 127 trillion cubic feet of gas. A third
of the liquids and almost a third of the gas have now been produced.
''Almost half of Britain's oil and a third of its gas comes from
fields which started production in the 1970s. Output from them is
falling and increased maintenance for ageing facilities means higher
running costs. At a time when oil prices are static it needs innovative
methods to ensure that producing extra resources from declining fields
will be economically justified.
''In the case of Brent redevelopment it is a daunting task, far more
difficult than developing a new field. This pioneering project will
rejuvenate a field which will now remain a major national asset for
longer than was originally expected.''
Brent, which has the largest total reserves of any UK field, was
originally expected to cease production in 1998 but that date has now
been pushed back by an estimated 10 years. It was expected that when the
field was abandoned the amount of oil recovered would have been around
40%. Now, not only has the amount of oil identified in the field
increased, but the Brent project means an estimated 55% will be
recovered.
More dramatically the expected amount of gas which will be recovered
has now risen from 40% to 80%.
On Brent, where the final testing is taking place prior to restart,
some of the changes are evident. The new giant flare stick is one of the
most obvious alterations, and the new accommodation module like the
processing module, constructed on shore and then hoisted into place by a
giant crane barge, gives the crew a new level of comfort.
Some of the changes are less obvious and one of the surprises to most
visitors is that the platform, which is in effect new, is less than
pristine in many places and could do with a lick of paint. Our American
guide explained that the painting was about to start and that it was a
conscious decision to leave the aesthetics to last.
''Paint don't make the company no money,'' he said.

Sir David Steel argues that the international community must take a
tougher line with President Moi
THIS week the so-called ''Paris Club'' of international donors
reviewed their budgetary aid to Kenya. The World Bank's East African
representative, James Adams, then announced that after much debate they
were going back to Nairobi to set up ''a mechanism'' for talks between
the donors and the Kenyan Government on non-economic issues such as
human rights.
Some of us have criticised the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank for being too economically blinkered.
In late 1991 the outside world forced the pace of reform by
withdrawing aid, and a multi-party constitution was unilaterally put
through Parliament by the ruling Kenya African National Union (Kanu)
party. The election commission was not independent, and the constituency
boundaries and numbers blatantly rigged, so much so that opposition
parties threatened to boycott the election.
Many of us persuaded them not to do so, and Kanu duly won, but only
after rigging the count in several constituencies and with the help of
an extraordinary provision in the constitution forbidding parties to
form coalitions.
President Moi's government was and is greatly helped by the disunity
in the opposition.
It is what has happened since the election that is more worrying.
Corruption continues unabated. The value of the Kenyan shilling has
declined from 44 to 53 to the dollar. Financial scandals -- in which,
among others, Vice-President Saitoti has been alleged to be implicated
-- have been whitewashed by the Public Accounts Committee, some of whose
members are alleged to have been bribed themselves.
The murder of Foreign Minister Robert Ouko has never been cleared up.
Suspect Nicholas Biwott was sacked from his ministry by President Moi,
but hangs around State House in the presidential entourage just the
same. More than 20 Opposition MPs have been arrested; the presses of two
critical magazines have been stopped by the police on orders from the
Government, and journalists go in fear. Ethnic clashes, believed to have
been stirred up by Government forces, have ended untold lives and
disrupted thousands of livelihoods.
It is not a pleasant picture in what is fundamentally an attractive
and prosperous country.
I have my doubts about this new donor ''mechanism''. Three years ago I
discussed with the Attorney-General, Amos Wako, the fact that much of
the draconian legislation he was using dated from the emergency powers
taken by the colonial Government during the Mau Mau emergency in the
fifties. He accepted as much and assured me there would be
constitutional revision.
A few months ago President Moi announced he was calling in a team of
international lawyers to conduct such a revision. I issued a statement
welcoming this and was promptly advised by Opposition politicians not to
be so daft. Nothing, they said, would happen. They have been proved
right.
It is difficult to know what to make of President Moi. He has been in
power too long -- 16 years -- and perhaps is not always fully informed
of what is going on in his Government. He goes regularly to church yet
the churches are among his severest critics for the human rights
failings of his administration.
Corruption and rich pickings for the few have led to mass unemployment
and housing squalor for the young. As a result, crime, especially in
Nairobi, is escalating out of control. Meanwhile, the number of Kenyan
exiles in Britain is growing by the month.
The international community needs to take a much tougher line on
conditionality for future aid, without which there can be little hope of
stemming corruption. They should demand a genuine constitutional reform
process, independence of the press and broadcast media, the appointment
of an independent election commission, and the restoration of peace and
harmony before the next election due in 1997 and before any substantial
aid packages are renewed for Kenya.
By agreeing merely to the creation of an unspecified ''mechanism'' the
donors have failed to live up to what Britain's aid minister, Baroness
Chalker, said a year ago would be ''the benchmarks we shall be employing
when we come to review progress''.
Kenya is not Rwanda. It is a sophisticated and well-developed country
of great potential. It deserves better from its politicians, both
Government and Opposition.

<HEADLINE>Welfare cash for refugees to be slashed</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977174827</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
GERMAN Health Minister Horst Seehofer said yesterday he planned to
slash welfare payments to war refugees who have been granted temporary
residence in Germany, mostly victims of the conflict in former
Yugoslavia.
Germany is host to more than 400,000 refugees from the conflict-torn
region, more than all other countries put together except Croatia.
Seehofer hoped to save more than #500m a year by treating the
temporary refugees the same way as asylum seekers, whose welfare
payments were cut in 1993. Both groups are banned from employment.
The proposal means a 20% cut for refugees who currently each receive
around #600 a month in benefits on average, or the payment of all
benefit in kind rather than cash.
''One can have an absolutely humane existence'' on this money,
Seehofer said, adding that the cuts were needed to relieve
financially-stretched local authorities who were having to spend more on
welfare payments to make up for cuts in unemployment benefit.
However, the Pro Asyl group, which campaigns on behalf of refugees in
Germany, said the cuts ''clear the way for the exclusion of further
social groups from the general social welfare system''.
The opposition Social Democrats spoke of ''the government's cynical
intention to take away money from those who barely even saved their
lives as they fled from war and chaos''.

How a unique telephone care scheme for the elderly is threatened by
cash problems
IF Good Morning Pollok were the sort of radio programme its name
suggests, it would have a cult following. The service is entertaining,
has its own brand of repartee and collection of in-jokes and its
listeners tune in faithfully every day. It is also a lifeline.
When the Safe Levern Pollok Project was set up with Urban Aid funding
as a community group to improve the safety of individuals in an area
with high crime and accident rates, their first questionnaire revealed
that the greatest fear of many elderly people living alone was that
no-one would help them if they became ill or even find them if they died
suddenly.
As a result they set up the Good Morning Pollok Service two years ago.
Now 105 elderly or disabled people receive a phone call every morning
just to check that they are alive and well. If there is no answer at the
second or third attempt, contact is made with someone near at hand such
as a key-holding neighbour who can check and report back. If there is a
problem, the system swings into action and relatives, doctor or
emergency services are alerted.
It is simple, practical and effective -- and an example of community
care as local concern about what is happening a few streets away rather
than political shorthand for a policy to reduce the numbers of people in
long-stay hospitals. This small example of good neighbourliness,
however, could come to an end in a matter of weeks for lack of funding.
''We need a bare minimum of #12,000 just to keep going for a year,''
said Cathy Rice, assistant co-ordinator of Good Morning Pollok.
''Although the Safe Levern Pollok Project gave us a #4000 immediate
action fund to establish the service they are not allowed to keep paying
the running costs and we have to find an outside source.''
What angers her and the four women who take it in turns to work a
two-and-a-half hour shift to keep the service running 365 mornings a
year is that with 105 people already depending on them, they are
constantly having to turn down requests from outside the Pollok area
from people who are desperate to be in the scheme and they know there is
an enormous need from people who do not qualify for one of the community
alarm schemes run by housing and social work departments but who are
frightened, lonely and with no-one to keep a daily check on them.
The cost is currently #148 per person for a call every day of the year
including emergency visits and phone calls to other agencies. ''It is
extremely cost-effective compared, for example, with a daily visit from
a home help, who might spend an hour with an elderly person, but whose
main function is to ensure that they are all right,'' argued Rice.
Even more galling for the team, however, is the knowledge that the
scheme could easily be expanded to make it even more economic. The
expensive computer systems are in place. They have accommodation in the
Safe Levern Pollok offices. There are experienced staff who could extend
their working hours to make more calls. If that were to happen, the cost
per client would immediately go down -- and the telephone and computer
equipment worth about #18,000 bought with grants from the Telethon Trust
and Glasgow District Council as well as Safe Pollok would be put to
better use.
''The computer equipment we have would allow us to deal with about
3000 clients. Obviously we would need to take on more staff to do that,
but with the four we have at the moment, we could deal with about 300
just by extending their hours,'' added Rice.
They have just been refused funding from the Scottish Office for the
second year running because their service is deemed low priority and
have now applied to Strathclyde region's social work committee for
#19,500 which would allow them to keep the present service going and
allow them to expand a little.
The main cost is wages, which at just over #4 an hour for the women
who make the calls, total nearly #8000 a year. The telephone bill and
line rentals come to #3000 a year and the computer and equipment
maintenance cost #800.
''If the service came to an end, we would all find ourselves checking
on some of our clients ourselves. You couldn't just forget them after
speaking to them every day for two years,'' said Sheila Hunter, one of
the team.
One of those they would be calling would undoubtedly be 71-year-old
Tom Stanton. He does not live alone, but cares for his wife, Nan, who
has Alzheimer's disease and is blind. Tom has had two heart attacks and
until he got in touch with the service after seeing a television report
of its launch, his constant fear was that if he became ill during the
night, his wife would be unable to summon help and, unable to help
herself, might die from neglect.
''The two of us could lie here for days without anyone knowing, but
now the girls come on every morning and it's the greatest thing,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE>Taunts for Climbdown Chancellor as 'fat cats' and workers keep tax relief. Another poll blow for Tories. Tories suffer by-election blow and Clarke's U-turn</HEADLINE>

THE Tories suffered a double humiliation yesterday when they lost
another by-election, and the Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, caved in to
pressure for a U-turn on controversial changes in tax on share options.
In the Littleborough and Saddleworth by-election, Mr John Hudson, the
Conservative candidate was beaten into third place, with Mr Chris Davies
of the Liberal Democrats coming first, followed by Labour's Phil Woolas.
The by-election was caused by the death of Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens in
May. He held on to the seat in the 1992 General Election with a 4494
majority, forcing the Liberal Democrats into second place with Labour
trailing third.
Last night Mr Davies polled 16,231, Mr Woolas 14,238, and Mr Hudson
9934, a Lib Dem majority of 1993. It represented a 11.67% swing from
Tories to the Lib Dems.
The Tories have not won a by-election since Richmond, Yorkshire, in
1989.
In the previous one, it was the turn of the SNP. It took Perth and
Kinross on an 11.5% swing, with the Conservatives again forced into
third place by Labour.
For Mr Davies it was third time lucky after two previously failed
attempts to win the seat. Mr David Alton, Liberal Democrat MP for
Mossley Hill, said that with Mr Major's parliamentary majority cut to
single figures, it signalled the death knell of the Tory Government.
There had been reports that the Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Paddy
Ashdown, may be preparing to step down but last night's result will
strengthen his leadership and ease the pressure. He can now prepare in
good heart for the party's annual conference in Glasgow in September.
Mr Ashdown, describing it as a superb result, said: ''Even with all
the Labour hype of the last year and the fact Labour have thrown
everything into winning this by-election, the Liberal Democrats have
proved that when it comes to real votes in real ballot boxes the British
people choose Liberal Democrats to defeat the Government.''
It was the party's seventh by-election victory under his leadership.
Labour leader Tony Blair said: ''This has shown once more that New
Labour is winning new support in every part of the country. The result
is another huge blow to the Conservatives and further evidence that the
leadership election made no difference whatever to their fortunes.''
However, it was felt Mr Blair had been hoping for a spectacular
victory. Labour MPs flooded into the constituency to support their
candidate in the three weeks of canvassing.
A spokesman for Conservative Central Office said: ''We have lost the
seat but we didn't suffer the kind of electoral wipeout that many
commentators predicted. The real losers tonight are Labour. The fact is
Labour could not win in the North of England in a mid-term by-election .
. . Tony Blair is humiliated.''
A senior Government Minister, Mr Roger Freeman, said the result was
disappointing, but said he drew some comfort from it and argued there
was evidence that the Tories were beginning to turn the corner and that
''the fightback has commenced''.
The winning candidate, Mr Davies, 41, a local councillor who has lived
in the constituency since 1986, said: ''In this election the people of
this constituency have spoken for Britain. They have reduced the
Conservative majority in the House of Commons to single figures for the
first time in 16 years.''
In the poll, the Liberal Democrats secured 39%, Labour 34%,
Conservatives 24%, with other fringe parties on just 4%.
There had been an earlier blow to the Tories with the Chancellor's
U-turn on share options. There had been widespread protests that Mr
Clarke's plan would have hit around 200,000 people, including low-paid
workers, with higher tax bills. This was many more than the ''fat cat''
executives exercising options worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, his
original target.
Mr Clarke announced that the change to an income tax would not be
retrospective and would now affect only share options issued after July
17, the date of his ''dawn raid'' on the schemes. Those who held or had
been granted options by July 17 will be taxed under the old capital
gains system which allows tax relief on the first #6000.
It means the ''fat cats'' who hold large executive share options in
privatised industries will pay tax at the old lower rate as well as
''the girl on the Asda supermarket till'' who has symbolised the plight
of holders of more modest amounts of shares who stood to pay more tax.
There had been an outcry from former Ministers and the threat of open
revolt from senior Tory back benchers. They accused the Government of
attacking a central plank of party policy by penalising share owners.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said: ''The Chancellor's second U-turn
has let the directors of the privatised utilities off scot-free. Senior
executives are sitting on #100m worth of share options and he has now
given them the green light to cash them in free of income tax.''
Mr Clarke, at a hastily summoned Treasury news conference, said it was
not possible to devise any fair or practical way to distinguish between
different categories of option holder.
It is at odds with the view of Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of the
committee which examined executive share options and made the
recommendation to change their tax treatment. The acceptance of this
plunged the Government into 10 days of confusion.
Mr Clarke admitted he was forced into a change of mind by the weight
of outside pressure brought to bear against the change, including the
public renunciation of the recommendation by Sir Richard himself. Sir
Richard, Marks and Spencer chairman, astonished MPs by confessing that
his committee never envisaged the tax switch hitting the low-paid and
called on the Government to reverse its decision.
The Chancellor will go ahead with his plan to tax options granted
after July 17 as income rather than capital gains. The Liberal Democrat
Treasury spokesman, Mr Malcolm Bruce, said this meant small investors
would have to sell their shares as soon as they exercised the option to
take them in order to pay their income tax bills.
''Ken Clarke should change things so that income tax is not payable
until the shares are sold,'' he added. ''Why doesn't he take a little
more time to think things through. He is becoming the Climbdown
Chancellor, first on VAT, then on gilts taxation, and now on share
options.''
Mr Clarke became flustered as reporters pressed him on the pressure
brought for a climbdown. He denied that some of the pressure had come
from No 10, saying simply that he had kept the Prime Minister in touch
with developments.
The tax change in fact will not make a great impact on ''fat cats''
cashing in their shares. The #6000 tax free capital gains allowance
saves them only #2400 in tax.

THE United States said yesterday it was taking seriously reports that
Bosnian Serbs had used poison gas in their attack on the Muslim enclave
of Zepa, and was asking the United Nations to investigate.
''While we've not been able to confirm them, we certainly are in no
way discrediting these reports, and are taking them very, very
seriously,'' State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
Bosnian radio reported this week that the Serbs had used nerve gas, a
banned chemical agent, against the defenders and civilian population of
Zepa.
''We certainly are going to urge the United Nations and others to look
into'' the reports, Burns said. US experts were also examining the
reports, which appeared to come from a number of Bosnian Muslim fighters
in Zepa, he said.
''I certainly wouldn't put it beyond the Bosnian Serbs to deploy such
tactics,'' Burns said.
Meanwhile, the Roman Catholic bishop of Sarajevo urged the West to
bomb Serbian military targets to stop the war and said that arming
Bosnian Muslims would only increase bloodshed in the Balkans.
Auxiliary Bishop Pero Sudar told the Italian daily Gazzetta del
Mezzogiorno that the Balkan conflict was so far out of hand that
diplomacy was practically useless.
''So many people have died in Bosnia that the only solution now is to
stop the Serbs. Diplomacy at this point can do very, very little,''
Sudar said.
''The only way out is to destroy their armaments, their barracks, and
their arsenals.''

BABCOCK International hopes to conclude talks soon over the purchase
of Rosyth Royal Dockyard from the Ministry of Defence. Chairman Dr John
Parker told shareholders at the annual meeting Babcock was now the sole
bidder.
The company, based in Buckinghamshire, manages the yard and earlier
this week won naval refit orders worth #53m for Rosyth.
Referring to future nuclear submarine work, and the problems facing
the Devonport yard which had won the Trident contract, he said: ''An MoD
review is under way to determine the forward programme of nuclear
submarine refits which should benefit Rosyth beyond 1997 when submarine
refitting was previously due to be transferred to Devonport. We believe
that negotiations should be concluded in principle by late summer/early
autumn.''
He told investors the group order book had held up well and by the end
of June stood at #634m compared with #553m at the corresponding time
last year.
Earlier this summer, the group announced the formal launch of a joint
venture with Siemens of Germany to operate two of British Rail's
maintenance depots.

A FATHER who was unable to cope with his grief after his 11-year-old
son was hanged on a rope swing,turned to drink, Falkirk Sheriff Court
was told yesterday.
James Short's drink problem became so severe that he considered
himself a danger to the public. Yesterday, he admitted a breach of the
peace at a local newsagents.
Depute procurator fiscal Fiona Jamieson said: ''He was shouting and
swearing and constantly referring to the death of his 11-year-old son.''
Lawyer Simon Hutchison said Short, 37, had been a ''perfectly
law-abiding citizen'' until the tragedy.
Sheriff Andrew Murphy let Short walk free by giving him a 30-day jail
sentence backdated to the time of the offence and putting him on
probation for nine months.
He also ordered him to attend an alcohol abuse counselling course.
* Short's son, Jim, died in Falkirk Royal Infirmary last October after
an accident when he and a pal were playing a game of ''hangman'' near
his Falkirk home.

<TEXT>
ONE of America's richest businessmen, burger-box billionaire Robert
Dart, was divorced in London yesterday under English law at a court
hearing which his wife refuses to recognise as valid.
Mrs Katina Dart, whose husband makes his money from manufacturing
polystyrene fast-food containers, made it clear that whatever the
English High Court awards her as a settlement, she will go to her local
court in Michigan and lay claim to half his fortune.
Mrs Dart, 37, had fought through the courts in vain to stop her
husband ending their 15-year marriage in London.
Last week, the Appeal Court heard Mr Dart was alleging adultery and
accusing his wife of refusing to have sex with him.
Mrs Dart's QC, James Munby, told Mr Justice Johnson she opposed the
granting of a divorce decree or the ''doing by this court of any act of
any sort'' in relation to her marriage. ''My client says the court in
Ingham County, Michigan, is the only one with any jurisdiction in this
matter.''
Mr Dart, also 37, was granted a decree nisi because of his wife's
alleged unreasonable behaviour. The judge certified that arrangements
for the couple's children, William, 12, and Ariana, nine, who live with
their mother, were ''excellent''.
The question of how much money Mr Dart should pay his wife and
children was adjourned to be heard in private.
The Darts moved to England in 1993. The Court of Appeal's ruling that
the English court was the appropriate forum for the divorce was based on
Mr Dart's ''habitual residence'' here for more than 12 months.
Mrs Dart said: ''I was born in America, married in America, live in
America, and came to England in 1993 on a temporary basis. I am still an
American citizen. I think it is so unfair he gets a divorce here. He
does not pay taxes here.''
Her solicitor, Ms Margaret Bennett, said there was still a contest
over where the financial settlement should take place: ''Divorce
settlements in England have been based on a wife's needs, not on a fair
division of property.''

<RECORDNO>977174834</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DEFENCE chiefs are recruiting a team of top medical experts to help
them discover the truth behind the so-called Gulf War Syndrome.
The decision was taken on advice from the Royal College of Physicians
which carried out an independent review of a Ministry of Defence
investigation into mysterious illnesses suffered by Gulf War veterans.
In its report yesterday, the college said ''far greater resources than
have yet been made available'' were needed to properly explore such a
complex medical riddle.
As a first step, the MoD said it would consult a team of four experts
in the fields of epidemiology, immunology, toxicology, and tropical
diseases.
However, the MoD's position remains that, so far, no evidence has come
to light to show the syndrome exists.
The Ministry accepted most of the recommendations but rejected one
significant finding -- the need for every soldier in the Gulf War
Medical Assessment Programme to have a psychiatric examination.
Announcing the results, the MoD's chief medical officer, Surgeon
Vice-Admiral Tony Revell, said: ''I have to say once again that I have
seen or heard nothing that would make me believe there is a specific
syndrome, that is, a group of symptoms that make up a disorder which is
directly attributable to the Gulf.''
Hundreds of servicemen returning from the Gulf War have complained of
a range of symptoms including sickness, kidney disorders, chest
infections, blackouts, hair loss, leukaemia, and depression.
Alleged causes range from vaccination and pre-treatment against
biological weapons and nerve gas to the effect of smoke from burning
oilfields.
Many of the servicemen suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD).
So far there have been 562 compensation claims against the MoD but no
writs issued.
The MoD also said it would be setting up a 24-hour answerphone
help-line for veterans, their relatives, and GPs seeking information
about the Medical Assessment Programme.
However, Shadow Defence Secretary Dr David Clark claimed there had
been no ''substantial change of course'' and the MoD's position remained
''half-hearted and inadequate''.

<TEXT>
THE Irish supreme court yesterday upheld the right of a family to let
their daughter die after lying in a coma for more than 20 years.
In a majority verdict, the five judges of the court -- the Irish
Republic's ultimate legal authority -- backed an earlier Dublin High
Court decision.
The woman -- now aged 45 -- sustained severe brain damage when her
heart stopped during a routine operation at the age of 22.
Since then, she has been close to a permanent vegetative state and fed
through a tube, although able to recognise people at times.
There was almost instant criticism of the judgment from Irish pro-life
organisations.
A spokesman for the Life Interest group said: ''We are studying this
decision at the moment. It potentially opens the door to euthanasia.''
Her family secured Irish High Court permission to let her die two
months ago but the judgment was appealed by the Irish Attorney General
and the institution that cares for the woman.
Today's ruling was endorsed by four of the Supreme Court judges with
another, Mr Justice Seamus Egan, dissenting.
He pointed out that the withdrawal of life support for the woman would
be to kill a human being.
The High Court hearing in the case earlier this year was told that it
would take the woman, who was not named in the proceedings, about two
weeks to die following the withdrawal of the life support.

A LACK of the mineral selenium may be at the root of male infertility,
according to a nutritionist.
Dr Allan MacPherson said tests showed that adding selenium to the diet
could increase sperm motility by 100%, making conception more likely.
He also suspects the problem began when Britain stopped importing
Canadian flour, which is rich in selenium.
Dr MacPherson has carried out tests with 60 volunteers at the Scottish
Agricultural College in Ayr. He found that taking 100 micrograms of
selenium a day had a marked effect on sperm activity.
Dr MacPherson said: ''It doesn't affect sperm count, but there is
certainly an effect on sperm motility.''
The recommended daily intake of selenium is 75 micrograms, but Dr
MacPherson said the average person in Britain got no more than 34
micrograms and some less than 10.
Selenium is found in oily fish, onions, tomatoes, and broccoli, but is
most concentrated in wheat.
Dr MacPherson also wants to investigate the fertility effect of
selenium on women.
He believes a lack of the mineral might reduce muscle contractions in
the womb which allow the sperm to ''surf'' to the ovum.

TWO passers-by saved a nine-month-old baby boy in his push-chair after
it fell into 8ft of water at Nairn harbour yesterday.
Baby Andrew Black from Parnassus Gardens, Fyvie, Turriff, was being
pushed along the harbour front by his 71-year-old grandfather, Mr Peter
Black, when he lost grip of the push-chair, which rolled away, tumbling
down a grassy embankment into the water.
Passers-by Mr David Stewart, 58, of King Street, Nairn, and
holidaymaker, Mr Patrick Kane, 34, of Glenboig, Lanarkshire, saw the
push-chair fall and jumped in after it. Although the baby sank out of
sight, they managed to haul him, still in his chair, back to the
surface.
An ambulance crew was called and when it arrived, the baby appeared
none the worse for the incident. However, he was taken to a surgery and
then to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, for a check-up.
Mr Peter Black, also of Parnassus Gardens, Fyvie, Turriff, was on
holiday with his wife Elenora, 70, his son Roy Black, 34, a tyre-fitter
in Inverurie, and his wife Lesley, 32, in a caravan at Parkdean Holiday
Park, Nairn.
The accident happened when Mr Black was out for a walk with baby
Andrew, and his three-year-old brother, Martin, accompanied by his wife
Elenora and son Roy.
Mr Black said yesterday: ''I must have just looked away for a second
and the push-chair was in the water. We were going up the town to shop.
I was pushing Andrew and Elenora was pushing Martin.
''We went across the Bailey bridge. My son, Roy, was behind us and he
went across to chat to someone he knew. While I was waiting for him --
it was just a second -- and I heard the missus scream, 'The buggy, the
buggy!'.
''I must have taken my hand off it. It rolled down a two metre grassy
verge and into the water. I don't swim but I felt like diving in myself.
''But folk seemed to come from everywhere and it was only seconds
before a man dived in.''
Mr Black said he thought the pram must have helped save the baby's
life. ''The hood was up,'' he said, ''and kept it afloat for a little
while before it sank. Those precious few moments were important.
''If it hadn't, I hate to think what would have happened. It was a
terrible experience. I can't thank the rescuers enough. I don't know
what to do to say thank you.
''Perhaps if there had been a railing there, it would have stopped the
pram from going into the water.''
Relieved mother, Mrs Lesley Black, was also full of praise for the two
men who helped save her son's life.
At Raigmore Hospital, where Andrew was detained for observation, she
said: ''The first I knew of it was when the police arrived at the
caravan.
''I knew something was wrong but thought it must be my husband. I
can't believe this has happened to us. Roy phoned the ambulance and went
there with the baby.
''I am so grateful to the two men who rescued Andrew.''
Mr Stewart, who was first in to the water, runs a smoked salmon shop
at the harbour. He was about to take off on a 10.30am dolphin-watch
trip, which he organises, when he heard the cries for help.
Mr Stewart said: ''I heard lots of screaming and went to see what was
happening and there was a crowd at the water's edge. Someone was
shouting there is a baby in the river. I ran to the edge and saw the
push-chair upside down. There was no sign of the baby.
''I dived in to get as close as I could. I came up and grabbed the
push-chair and tried to lever it upwards. Another chap joined me and
together we righted the buggy. The baby's face was still under water and
he was strapped to the buggy.
''We managed to get it to the harbour wall after raising the baby's
head out of the water. The baby seemed quite unconcerned. Basically, I
just reacted instantaneously.
''Somebody threw a rope down to hitch on to the buggy and it was
hoisted out with the baby still in it. It was great to see the wee kid's
face come out of the water.''
Mr Kane, a machine operator of Gainside Road, Glenboig, Airdrie, was
on holiday with his wife, family, and in-laws, staying in a chalet at
the holiday park.
He said he was going fishing when he heard the commotion and someone
shouting: ''Help, can anyone swim.''
''I just dropped my gear, ran over, took off my shirt, and dived in. I
thought it was an old age pensioner. My toes just about touched the
bottom but I was struggling to push the chair upwards. Eventually, we
managed to get it out. Someone threw over a lifebelt.
''It all happened all of a sudden and it lasted a couple of minutes. I
was up for a quiet holiday or so I thought. I was in the right place at
the right time.
''Afterwards, I was more worried about my dog because it ran off, it
got such a fright with the noise. I am very pleased it has all had a
happy ending and I was able to help.''

LOTTERY ticket buyers are flocking in their droves to snap up a
winning ticket from the luckiest corner shop in Britain.
Sales have gone through the roof and turnover has reached an all-time
high at the store in Failsworth, Greater Manchester, where rags to
riches millionaire Mr Mel Eddison bought his prize winning #2.5m ticket.
Three jackpot prizes, totalling an amazing #9.8m have been won with
lottery tickets bought at Failsworth Discount Foodstores in Failsworth,
Greater Manchester, so far this year as well as the countless thousands
of unknown number of small winnings on both the lottery and scratch
cards.
Owner Mr Mohammed Javid, 30, says news spread so fast his store has
now become a Mecca for lottery punters.
He said yesterday: ''People used to buy lottery tickets on Thursday's,
Friday's and Saturday's, but now I sell them every day of the week.
''I get people from all over the region coming to my shop to buy a
national lottery ticket! It's incredible.''
The store's winning streak began in February this year when a #7m
winner bought his ticket at the store.
He then sold a #300,000 winning ticket to a local man two months ago.
Last week Mr Eddison, from Failsworth, Greater Manchester, who was
already a millionaire from his pallets and garage businesses, got his
jackpot ticket from the foodstore.
Mr Javid went on: ''We must be the luckiest shop in Britain to have
three big wins in seven months.''
It was announced yesterday that National Lottery prizes had topped the
#1000m mark, with Scots winning #86m since the launch last November.
Across the UK, there have been 227 jackpot winners, 15 wins of more
than #5m, and 78 of more than #1m. About #2m is lying unclaimed in
prizes in Scotland.
