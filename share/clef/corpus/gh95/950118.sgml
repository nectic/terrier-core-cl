FISHING harbours, even those which seldom see working trawlers these
days, have a special appeal all their own. In the salty tang of the air,
the slap of the water on harbour walls, bobbing boats and the spangled
mobility of the sea beyond, lies a tranquillity.
Harbours are places to sit awhile, to lean on a railing and let your
thoughts run free.
How pleasant then, to live within one. At Dunbar's Old Cromwell
Harbour, Cromwell Quay offers just such an opportunity with a choice of
four rather exclusive apartments built by local builders, W A Gillespie
&amp; Son. Even better, those who buy one of the homes will have the chance
to design the interior lay-out of their flat in the way they want.
At present, the homes have -- with the exception of one for display
services -- been built as shells. They are generously proportioned by
today's standards, ranging from 1985sq ft. up to 2155sq ft. and provide
features such as balconies -- some of extremely generous size -- and
double glazing (enhanced by an extra layer of glass on sea-front doors)
provided.
Each home will have a 10-year NHBC guarantee, central heating, a
choice of bathroom suites, and the kitchens will be complete with oven,
hob, cooker, hood, fridge, freezer, tumbler dryer, washing machine and
dishwasher.
There is a common entrance set in a courtyard approached through
locked gates for security, and the garages are situated in this area.
Brian Beveridge, of B Beveridge International Consultants, the selling
agents, believes that the properties could offer a pleasing alternative
for people coming from the South to work in Edinburgh, who may prefer a
quieter location with good schooling, at lower cost than comparable
property would be in the city.
''The apartments would also be of interest to retired people,'' says
Mr Beveridge. ''Dunbar is an unspoiled town with good amenities, and for
commuters, it is on the main East Coast railway line. In 20 minutes, you
can be in Edinburgh from the local station, and there are frequent fast
services to London.
''These are homes which can never be built in front of, and the local
authority plans to enhance Old Cromwell Harbour with the addition of
old-style lamps and so on. For those who sail, moorings will be
available within the harbour, which is no longer the town's main
harbour.
''Cromwell Quay provides craftsmen-built apartments where people can
create interiors to suit themselves, in consultation with the
architect/interior designer.''
Prices at the development start from #150,000.

Current market conditions favour property sales via estate agents
rather than solicitors property centres, claims Lothian's largest
independent estate agency. Reporting sales of #24m worth of residential
property in 1994, David Alves of Stewart Saunders &amp; Co stoked the
continuing row between solicitors and estate agents by saying that the
solicitors tended only to achieve sales thanks to the
''self-motivation'' of buyers.
Commenting on the ups and downs of last year's market, David Alves
said: ''There was a marked difference in the quarterly pattern of sales
compared with 1993. The first quarter showed an increase of 36% on those
achieved in 1993. In the second and third quarters, sales dropped by
16%, while the final quarter registered a rise of 32% over the previous
year.
''The prospects for an increased level of activity in 1995 depend on
further growth in the economy and interest rates staying stable.
''There is no doubt that current conditions favour the estate agency
approach to sales, with positive professional marketing effort, accurate
pricing and the proper working of mailing lists. This has been achieving
significantly better results than those at solicitors' property centres,
where sales tend only to arise out of the self-motivation of prospective
purchasers.''
Stewart Saunders &amp; Co's #24m worth of sales represented 345 properties
at an average price of around #70,000. Just over 100 were new-build
homes, with a value of #7.5m.

SCOTLAND'S timber frame manufacturers are gearing themselves up for a
major expansion into England this year. New fuel and conservation rules
due to come into effect south of the Border on July 1 mean that every
new house will have to carry a label which identifies its energy rating.
Timber frame manufacturers claim that their method of building offers
significant energy conservation advantages over other methods and
predict an expansion in demand.
However, a catastrophic slump in the market for timber frame in the
early Eighties means that English-based suppliers are not geared up to
meet any increase in demand. Now Scotland's manufacturers are laying
their plans for a major marketing raid over the border.
''The change in England's regulations offers an opportunity which the
Scottish industry must seize with both hands,'' says Charles Grant,
marketing director of Walker Timber and chairman of SCOTFI (the Scottish
Consortium of Timber Frame Industries).
Meanwhile, he is optimistic that new regulations to be introduced at a
later date in Scotland (possibly 1 January 1996) will give a similar
boost to demand north of the Border.
Compared to its English counterpart, Scotland's timber frame sector
has performed well over the last ten years.
It all goes back to 1983, a year which is carved deep on the heart of
every UK timber frame manufacturer. Just as the property industry was
heading into the best boom it has seen this century, a World in Action
TV programme cut the foundations from under the timber frame sector.
The programme painted a devastating picture -- still hotly disputed to
this day by the industry -- which claimed that enormous damage could be
done to the structure of the house as condensation built up or rainwater
seeped in.
It was one of the most effective demolition jobs ever seen on
television. Overnight the roof fell in on the timber frame industry and
its 22% share of the UK new-build market crumbled to 6%.
Predictions that timber frame would increase its market share to as
much as 80% by the Nineties were crushed underfoot as buyers stampeded
out of the timber frame showhomes into the ''safety'' of bricks and
blocks. In England, the sector never really recovered and now has only
about 10% market share of the new build sector.
In Scotland the picture is very different. SCOTFI claims that timber
frame has more than 50% share of all new homes built north of the
Border, including self-build.
''Scottish companies refused to be done down by the World in Action
programme,'' says Charles Grant. ''The programme was totally wrong about
timber frame and we realised that we just had to keep battering away at
the market if we were to survive.
''Although the programme had an impact on sales up here, it did not
cut the feet from under us. Scots have a stronger understanding about
how houses are built and they are less easily persuaded by a single TV
programme.''
Part of the Scottish sector's strategy was to set up SCOTFI to defend
itself with a united voice against any future attacks. By any measure,
it has been very successful and has taken the challenge right to the
doorstep of 'traditional' builders.
''Firms who use brick and block construction like to call their houses
'traditional', but their product is no more traditional than timber
frame,'' says Charles Grant.
He makes a strong point. Timber frames has played a long role in the
history of housing - some of them date back 1000 years to the Norman
times. Medieval house construction was much more detailed than we
realise nowadays - wooden frame houses were built like today's, often to
a roughly standard design with each joint numbered to make construction
easier.
''Whole communities would come together to haul the mainframe into
place - just like the scene in the Hollywood film Witness, where people
from the Amish sect literally pulled together to raise an impressive
timber frame structure.
Conscious of the importance of protecting timber frame's hard-won
recovery north of the Border, SCOTFI is choosy about which builders it
will allow into membership.
''We don't encourage the guy who wants to throw some wood together on
a site. It's very important to keep the quality image very high. We also
have to persuade architects of the value of timber frame.
''Ecologically, we have a great story to tell,'' adds Charles Grant.
''We use a renewable resource, it does not consume fossil fuels, yet
timber is every bit as good as steel or aluminium. The cost of producing
a timber beam is one-sixth of the concrete equivalent and one eighth of
the cost of a steel beam.''
But it is in energy-saving and insulation that he sees timber frame's
strongest opportunity.
According to government statistics, it can take up to 66% more fuel to
heat a home in Scotland than one in England or Wales.
SCOTFI says that these figures back its own demands for more stringent
insulation standards in Scotland's housing. The organisation presented
evidence to the Scottish Office as part of the consultation on the
revision of regulations on the Conservation of Fuel and Power, due to be
introduced early north of the Border next year.
The timber frame builders argue that Scotland's more severe climatic
conditions require tighter regulations if the Government's target of 25%
to 35% improvement in energy performance is to be achieved.
''Scotland has a more demanding climate: environmental responsibility
dictates that we should get the energy conservation legislation to
match,'' says Charles Grant.
Claiming that timber frame can deliver a thermal performance up to 27%
more energy-efficient than current building regulations demand, he is
confident that the industry will continue to prop up at least half of
Scotland's house building sector for the foreseeable future.

A #10M village estate inspired by Thirties Scottish design principles
is being built in Wattston, a small village half way between Cumbernauld
and Airdrie.
Sherlock Park is the largest development in Airdrie for several years
and will feature tree-lined avenues, fountains, traffic calming, a
social centre, nursery and an adventure play-ground. The estate, which
is by Glasgow-based Hanirose Homes plc, will double the size of the
existing village at Wattston.
The result is a village estate which the builder claims will foster a
''relaxed, safe atmosphere and a strong community spirit.''
A total of 140 homes including villas, detached and semi-detached
bungalows and terraced houses are being built, ranging in size from two
to five bedrooms. Six house styles are available.
Prices range from #49,000 to over #100,000 and Hanirose says that each
home will be ''generously proportioned in keeping with the house styles
of the Thirties.''
Each home features a fully fitted kitchen, front and rear landscaping,
hedges, tree planting and access to all community facilities - including
the adventure playground and day centre.
Hanirose Homes estimate that over #250,000 is being returned from
profit to the development in the form of extra community features and
facilities.
''We undertook extensive market research and found that extra space, a
sense of safety and a strong community spirit were becoming more and
more important in the market,'' said a Hanirose Homes spokesman.
''We realised that these values were embodied in many of the spacious
estates designed before and after the Second World War. By marrying
modern materials and building technology with the best of Thirties
design, we believe Sherlock Park will mark an exciting new phase in
Scotland's house building industry.''
A special three-dimensional computerised simulation of the estate and
house styles allows visitors to ''wander'' through the unbuilt scheme
and view unbuilt houses on-screen.
A special incentive is on offer to early purchasers. Every customer
completing missives within the first three months will be entered into a
free prize draw to win one of four Ford Escorts.
Construction will start shortly.

RUBSTIC, the only Scottish-trained winner in the history of the Grand
National, has died, at the age of 26.
He passed away peacefully in the stable in Ladykirk, between Berwick
and Coldstream, where he had lived in retirement under the care of
former trainer John Leadbetter.
Leadbetter said: ''It's one of those sad days and like losing a best
friend.
''But the horse enjoyed a great life and is being buried here at
Ladykirk in a field next to the yard where he lived in retirement.
''He was part of the family -- you get to know horses like friends in
the same way they get to know you.
''Although he may not have been top class, at least he won a proper
National before they modified the fences.
''He was a horse who had a first-class attitude to racing and must
have been one of the most consistent staying chasers in Britain since
the war. He'll remain in my memory forever.''
The gelding landed the Grand National in 1979 when he carried Maurice
Barnes to a hard-fought length-and-a-half triumph over Zongalero.
He also completed a hat trick of victories in Sedgefield's Durham
National (1978-80) and finished runner-up to King Con in the Scottish
National at Ayr in 1978.
Rubstic -- named after the Swedish equivalent of a Brillo pad -- was
owned throughout his career by former international rugby player John
Douglas.

MARK Ramprakash and Glen Chapple were again the stars for England A
yesterday in a hard-fought four-wicket victory over India A in
Bangalore. Ramprakash added a chanceless 36 not out to his first-innings
99, steering the A team home eight balls after tea on a pitch giving
more and more help to both seam and spin.
Earlier, Lancashire paceman Chapple took two of the last three Indian
wickets to fall yesterday, finishing with five for 32, to leave England
A needing only 116 to go 1-0 up in the three-match series.
At 89 for six, when Dominic Cork was out stumped for a third-ball duck
charging hot-headedly down the pitch to slow left-armer Utpal
Chatterjee, there were some frayed nerves in the England dressing room.
But Ramprakash was coolness personified, and Leicestershire wicketkeeper
Paul Nixon also contributed some judicious blows to make sure the target
was reached with no further alarms.
* AUSTRALIA'S 'civil war' was won by the nation's senior side in
Melbourne yesterday when Mark Taylor's XI defeated Australia A by six
wickets to clinch the World Series Cup. Australia responded to the A
team's total of 226 by scoring 229 for four, winning with one over to
spare, to take an unbeatable lead in the best-of-three finals.
Man-of-the-finals Steve Waugh guided the senior side home with an
unbeaten 56 in 64 balls and there were also half-centuries for Taylor
and Michael Slater.
Australia's victory was their fourth in as many matches over the A
side, and meant they lost only one of their eight matches in the
competition over the season.
* NEW Zealand coach Geoff Howarth resigned yesterday, just five days
before the national side was due to face the West Indies at the start of
its hundredth anniversary season.
Howarth, who was New Zealand's most successful Test captain, announced
his decision after days of intense media speculation that he was about
to be sacked. His position had become untenable after series defeats
against Australia, England, and South Africa. On the recent South
African tour, New Zealand lost every one-day match they played and
conceded the Test series 2-1 after winning the first game.
Speculation has focused on former opening batsman Glenn Turner, who
has held the coach's job before but made clear he would only be tempted
back if given a strong role in selecting the side.
New Zealand are due to face the West Indies in Auckland on Sunday in
the first of three one-day internationals, to be followed by two Tests.
Yesterday's scores
India A 300 and 104 (A Muzumdar 51; G Chapple 5-32); England A 289 and
117 for six (M Ramprakash 36 n.o.).
Australia A 226 (G S Blewett 64, D R Martyn 58; D W Fleming 4-28, G
McGrath 3-41); Australia 229 for four (S R Waugh 56 n.o., M J Slater 56,
M A Taylor 50).
West Indies 206 for nine (W Benjamin 74, B Lara 38); Auckland 101 (J
Vaughan 33; Benjamin 4-10, K Arthurton
4-26). One-day tour match in Auckland. West Indies won by 105 runs.

THE McEnroe family returned to haunt Boris Becker yesterday as the
German world No.3 suffered a dramatic straight-sets demise in the first
round of the Australian Open Tennis Championships in Melbourne.
A frustrated Becker crashed out 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 as an inspired Patrick
McEnroe, brother of former Wimbledon and US Open champion John, took
revenge for his defeat by the third seed in the 1991 semi-finals at
Flinders Park.
Gabriela Sabatini and Goran Ivanisevic also fell at the first hurdle
but the departure of Becker ranked among the biggest upsets in the
tournament's recent history.
Becker made 46 forehand errors in a match which lasted a little more
than two hours as his immediate plans of threatening Pete Sampras' world
No.1 ranking were rudely shattered.
The three times Wimbledon champion missed last year's Australian Open
to attend the birth of his son, Noah, and was beaten in the first round
on his previous visit in 1993. But this year was supposed to be the one
he re-emerged as a major force in the men's game, making McEnroe's
achievement all the more remarkable.
The younger McEnroe won the first title of his career last Sunday when
he beat Australian Richard Fromberg in the final of the New South Wales
Open.
Ranked No.65 in the world, he has 14 doubles titles to his credit but
before this month the highlight of his career was reaching the last four
in Melbourne four years ago.
On that occasion Becker won in four sets after having dropped the
first, but this time was unable to recover from a disastrous start.
McEnroe romped away to a two-set lead and even when his opponent led
3-0 in the third there seemed little chance of an escape. Becker
survived numerous break points, but from 5-2 his lead was gradually
eroded and the final tie-break finished 7-4 in McEnroe's favour.
''I played bad tennis,'' admitted Becker. ''I thought I was in good
shape . . . but I had no rhythm, especially on my forehand.''
The German lost to John McEnroe on the same court in 1992 but
acknowledged the famous New Yorker's younger brother had produced a
performance worthy of the family name.
''I was playing an opponent who was still flying high on his emotions.
He played a great match but I wish I had an excuse. Everything was
perfect before the match.''
Sabatini had to have five minutes of on-court treatment for a back
injury, but refused to use her discomfort as an excuse for her 6-4, 6-4
defeat to American Marianne Werdel Witmeyer.
Ivanisevic, playing his first tournament since his eight-week ban from
the ATP tour for accumulated fines, was equally disappointing as he
surrendered 6-1, 7-6, 6-3 to Germany's Carl- Uwe Steeb, his second
successive first-round loss at a grand slam event.
Swiss No.12 seed Marc Rosset and women's seeds Magdalena Maleeva and
Julie Halard were the other main casualties on a day in which almost
four hours play was lost on the outside courts to rain.
McEnroe's victory means that five of the top seven remaining men's
seeds are American, with only Stefan Edberg and Michael Stich flying the
European flag.
Andre Agassi, making his first Australian Open appearance, and Todd
Martin both advanced comfortably to the second round, joining Pete
Sampras, Michael Chang, and Jim Courier who all won on Monday.
McEnroe's current form suggests he could live with most of his
compatriots and he agreed the Becker triumph was the best win of his
career.
''If he played as well as he could, then obviously he would beat me
but I hung in there,'' he said.
His second-round opponent will be Britain's Jeremy Bates who staged
one of the finest comebacks of his fluctuating career to beat Swede
Henrik Holm 6-4, 6-7, 3-6, 7-6, 6-3.
Bates, who was spurred on by a strong contingent of fans in the crowd
who had come to Australia to watch England's cricket tour, fought back
from the verge of defeat.
After having won the first set 6-4, Bates lost the next two and was
5-1 down in the fourth, but broke the Swede twice to win on a tie-break.
Bates, who has retired from playing in the Davis Cup, at one stage
trailed 2-0 in the deciding set, but won five successive games to book
his second round place.

BEFORE a new golf season begins with the opening tomorrow of the Dubai
Desert Classic, Colin Montgomerie -- in a wide-ranging summary of the
prospects -- called for more matchplay events to enhance Europe's Ryder
Cup performances, denied that he had changed clubs only for the money,
and stated his personal goals.
''The Ryder Cup is important but it tends to bear down on people and
needs to be put in perspective,'' Montgomerie began.
''However, Europe must win again quickly or it will become like the
Americas Cup yacht race -- Australia win once, and now it is back where
it usually is, in the United States.
''Also, there's more international competition now for the match,'' he
continued.
Referring to the President's Cup, (USA v Rest of the World, except
Europe) and next month's inaugural Dunhill Challenge (South Africa v
Australasia): ''If Europe wins later this year, it will make the 1997
contest bigger; if the USA keeps on winning, the match could lose all
that it has gained over the past 10 years.
''The Americans play more effectively as a team,'' Montgomerie noted,
''and, now, they have the advantage of another match in the
even-numbered years. The Europeans should get together more often; it's
very difficult to gel as a unit in three days competition after only
three days practice and although we perform well in the foursomes and
fourballs, somehow we don't in the singles.''
Montgomerie would like Europe to have not only another team match, but
also at least one individual matchplay tournament each season.
The big Scot had been using a Callaway driver and No.3 wood well
before he decided to change over from Wilson, reputedly on a contract
worth #500,000 over three years.
''Their research and development section is phenomenal and it will put
me ahead of the field,'' he asserted. ''I've never stuck with a
particular trend and I am convinced I can do better playing these irons.
''They are the same weight, but there's extra technique in the heads
for accuracy and distance,'' Montgomerie continued.
''The ball travels one club more -- the No.5 iron substitutes for the
No.4 for example -- so Alistair McLean, my caddy, and I will need a week
or two to work on revised yardages and adjust the clubbing.''
Montgomerie will use this development from the laboratory to assist
him to draw the ball from the tee at the Masters, the approved shape of
shot for the Augusta course.
He will try out one or two specially made drivers in practice, at the
same time pointing out he would not be radically altering his game ''for
just a few shots in a year''.
''I've achieved so much so quickly,'' Europe's No.1 for the past two
years said with every justification, ''that winning a major title is now
expected of me. But I am starting in only my eighth season and Olazabal,
for instance, was in his ninth year when he won the Masters last April.
''Anyway, there are other targets.
''I went from fourteenth to eighth in the 1994 world rankings, but
when you look at the players ahead of me it will be very hard to better
that placing,'' he added.
''My game and stroke average can be improved and I need to be in
contention again soon and take the experience from that into the
championships.''
Meanwhile, Greg Norman yesterday conceded that the proposed #18m World
Tour he trumpeted may not happen this year.
The Australian shocked the golfing world by revealing details of the
eight-event tour in November, but the idea has since crumbled because of
opposition from the American and European tours and lack of support from
other players.
''I still believe it will happen one of these years and I'd like to
see it happen,'' said the Australian, who plays in the Dubai Desert
Classic this week.
''I don't know where it stands at the moment -- I do not own it or run
it. The only feasible time this year is after the Tour Championship in
November.''
Norman wrote to European tour executive director Ken Schofield on the
matter and may ask for a meeting when Schofield flies to the Middle East
later this week.
After arriving himself from Florida, Norman teamed up with US Open
champion Ernie Els in an exhibition match also featuring Nick Price,
Fred Couples, Montgomerie, and Bernhard Langer.
Els, back on the course where he shot 61 and won by six last year, and
Norman came out on top when the South African sank a 30-foot eagle putt
on the final green.

ABERDEEN Boat Club, who already have an active squad, have offered to
keep the flag flying by providing manpower for an eight to take over the
existing Scottish Rowing's high slot in the annual Head of the River
race in London.
Success in this event largely depends on gaining a good starting slot
among the previous year's best crews. In the absence of a decision
whether the Scottish Amateur Rowing Association's international
committee will be forming a crew for the Head, Aberdeen have made their
offer to help keep alive the prospect of a reasonable starting position
for the Scottish Rowing eight in future years.
Aberdeen also have promised an open-doors policy for any individual
from outwith their squad who wishes to try out for this crew.
The SARA have appointed George Warnock to take over as chairman of the
international committee, with responsibilities for preparing Scotland's
teams for this year's Home International match in Ireland and other
top-class events, as well as starting the build-up towards the next
Commonwealth Championships in 1998.
Warnock, a former internationalist and now an active veteran rower
with Glasgow Rowing Club, was Scottish team manager in the seventies and
coach to Scotland's bronze medal double sculls crew at last year's
inaugural Commonwealth Championships in Ontario. That crew, which pulled
past England's double in the last few strokes for their bronze medal,
consisted of Castle Semple's Martin Holmes and George's son, Alistair.
During the festive season, an informal assessment took place on the
Clyde for squad members based in the West of Scotland, and candidates
from further afield have been invited to travel to Glasgow this Saturday
to take part in more informal sessions. The hope is that these trials
will help to shape crews for the summer season.

HOUSES suffer all kinds of punishments as their ownership changes
hands. Fireplaces, original plaster work and tiling are all casualties
to fashion and time. But to lose a name seems the final indignity.
Fortunately, for one fine old house at Castlewood in Paisley, a chance
find meant the return of its name. And a nice traditional ring it has,
too.
Dunalister, at No.13 Low Road, certainly looks as if it should merit a
proper title. Built just over a century ago, it has comfortable
proportions and large elegant rooms, while some modern improvements
include gas central heat ing.
''We were restoring a fireplace when we came across an old postcard,
and there was the name,'' says Lynn Wojciechowski. Fortunately, we liked
it and felt it went with the house.
There is still one discovery that they haven't been able to make about
this semi-detached villa, and that is the meaning of the beautiful glass
panel in the front door. It is engraved with a fountain and birds, one
with a snake in its beak, and the significance of the design remains a
mystery.
Once inside the original door, there is a square hall with a very
large sitting room and a spacious dining room on either side.
Lynn describes the ground floor as very flexible, according to the
needs of the family. At present, one room is housing a pool table and
has become the pool room.
The sitting room with its long windows has enough space to make one
end a dining area.
To the back of the house is large kitchen with fitted cupboards on two
sides and a big breakfasting table and chairs in one corner.
A utility room was formerly known as the wash-house, so that not only
does it have generous Victorian proportions but two wonderful old china
sinks that are invaluable for all kinds of tasks. Bathing a small
elephant wouldn't be out of the question.
On the stair turn is a tall window that floods the landing with light
and also boasts some original panels in a beautiful shade of wine red.
The glow would cheer you coming downstairs on the dullest morning.
Four large double bedrooms open off a square landing, while the main
bedroom has its own shower cubicle and vanity unit.
There is a second shower in the bathroom, where the suite is in an
unusual shade of sage green. The white wallpaper with green and
terracotta flowers matches a deep green carpet. Above, a pine ceiling
has a trap door cut into it for access to a loft which offers an
enormous storage space.
All the doors and the sweeping banister rail have been dipped and
stripped before being treated with clear varnish. And though the house
was temporarily relieved of its name, all the finely detailed roses
around the lights and the cornicing remain.
Despite being just five minutes from the centre of Paisley, Dunalister
is hidden away in a conservation area in a quiet, tree-lined cul-de-sac.
In the large front garden the drive has been completely paved in deep
rose-coloured bricks, while to one side is a separate garage.
The back garden is being landscaped, and a new retaining wall and
steps have been added to make a tiered layout.
Clearly, it's not just the name that is being restored to this
comfortable stone, family house.

And the sex appeal of Scottish knits could be a warming discovery,
writes ANNE
SIMPSON
'Knitting is no longer a quick
means of getting new clothes
without any parting of money'
SOME things never change, not even in the restless world of fashion.
Behold the cardigan -- ageless, timeless, a trusty friend wrapping
itself around one season, then the next, hugging close in times of
crisis; or -- when required -- summoning up glamour through the old knit
and purl. It's interesting what a little unbuttoning (or belting-up) can
do.
In the West's economic downdraught the outlook is bright for the
knitwear industry. The consumer's decision to spend carefully on fewer
clothes has drawn knits in from the periphery of fashion to the dynamic
heart of business. So next week's Design in Knitwear trade fair in
London will be a teeming get-together of mainstream exhibitors and
directional names like Betty Jackson, Xavier Foley, Patricia Roberts and
David Fielden who have never been slow to hang flair on needles.
There will also be a powerful contingent of young innovators; and as
proof that knits are now design-led merchandise, a selection of work
from that new umbrella group, The London Collections, will be on show.
While highly respected, Scottish knitwear has not enjoyed a sexy
reputation -- but many of the Scottish designs to be launched next week
will refute the notion of reliable-but-staid style.
Scotland will be represented in a strong, individual section with
labels like Barrie, Drumohr, N. Peal, Scot Officer, Morag Cameron,
Strathclyde Knitwear, and the Scottish Apparel Group -- all showing how
versatile and sensual their knitting has become.
More than ever, of course, the trade is fighting global competition
from cheap Far Eastern copies and European companies seeking a bigger
slice of the luxury cashmere market. All this makes trade-fair
networking vital.
Since the last Design In Knitwear show, for instance, Strathclyde
Knitwear of Irvine has successfully developed new outlets, to the point
where it now exports 60% of its handsome tapestry sweaters to 22
countries.
Next week, like all other exhibitors at the London Business Design
Centre, the Scots will display the shape of knitting for a winter one
year on from now. Hawick's Barrie, for example, will launch its new
ecosilk collection in an alpaca, wool and silk, mix plus some seductive
cashmere sloppy joes. Style points from other manufacturers focus on
tiny cardigans fastening under the bust with a single button, tender
tunics in pale colours with cobweb detailing, tightly-cut singlets which
look effective when layering the new fluid dresses or perfectly simple
white shirts.
Lurex yarns, high twist rayons, and a shaggy, glinty fibre -- like a
ruffled bath mat -- give classical shapes a sharper edge. But, as with
the rest of fashion, knitwear's needles are often flying towards the
future by harking back to the cool pastels that evoke Grace Kelly's
Fifties chic, and the pert tidiness of Doris Day in those sugary little
boleros and cardies.
Maybe such retrospection is exactly right. Knitting, after all, has an
ancient lineage and is the stuff of tradition. As we know, then, some
things never change. But in one respect knitting has altered its status.
It may be the more economical strand of fashion, but it is no longer
necessarily a quick, cheap means of arriving at new clothes without any
painful parting of money.

It's a chilly moment when the parties are
over, but Francesca Fearon suggests
you take refuge in user-friendly knits
* THE parties are over, the little black number is safely returned to
the wardrobe, and instead out come the soft, fluffy knits -- all the
better to cosset yourself in.
This could be the bleakest moment of the year, socially as well
climatically -- and thus the moment for searching out clothes with the
feel-good factor, the ones in which to flop on the sofa, or to wear
snuggled up by the fireside.
Your waistline may have gained a few inches in past weeks, but knits
are user-friendly -- and won't act as a pinching reminder.
Fluffy, fuzzy knitwear is ideal. Mohair, alpaca, angora and lamb's
wool are the affordable luxuries -- and cashmere the devil-may-care
extravagance.
Pringle and Barrie, the two Scottish cashmere specialists, have
designed long, slimline tunics, gilets, ribbed cardigans and big cable
knits to shrug on over matching leggings in a range of neutral, pastel
and rich dark shades.
These can be layered with vast shawls which are essential for
cocooning. Advances in spinning technology have developed new blends
like Barrie's special Royal Cashmere, which mixes cashmere with wool and
silk. Not only is it ultra-soft, but the price is ultra-accessible.
Although a trifle chilly around the waistline, cropped mohair and
angora twinsets in pretty pastels have been this season's fashion
favourites.
Now, as tastes shift towards the comfort zone, Jigsaw, Oasis and Top
Shop have designed some lovely, big fuzzy knits in these yarns to thwart
the cold. They come in warm, rich colours (claret, fuchsia, olive and
burned orange) that add a flattering glow to a pale wintry complexion.
Alpaca has been restored recently to fashion's list of favourite
touchy-feely yarns.
The Peruvian Connection, a mail-order catalogue, has a large range of
sweaters, chunky cardigans and fringed wrap skirts in alpaca wool based
on original Inca designs. All of the hand-knitting is produced in Peru
where the long, silky fibre from the alpaca (a relative of the vicuna
and llama) is the mainstay of the local economy.
The intricate, homespun effects of hand-knitting, embroidery and
crocheting the Peruvians use do not lend themselves to mass-production
techniques. Nor, in fact, does the scarcity of this lustrous fibre.
Alpaca is in limited supply -- the animal is only sheared every two
years, yielding about eight pounds of fleece -- but, in its luxurious
and timeless quality, it bears a resemblance to cashmere -- which makes
it not only elegantly attractive but also a sound investment.In future
comfort.

A WOMAN whose engagement was broken off after she suffered serious
brain injuries in a road accident, yesterday won damages of around
#500,000 against her former fiance.
Miss Jacqueline Hardy, 25, sued Mr Grant Cathcart for #800,000
following the crash near the Fordell service station on the A68 south of
Dalkeith, Midlothian, on March 7, 1990.
Miss Hardy, of Queen Street, Invergordon, Ross-shire was a passenger
in the car being driven by Mr Cathcart, of Firhill, Alness, also
Ross-shire.
He failed to give way to traffic at a junction and, without stopping,
drove straight on to the A68 in to the path of a bus.
Lothian and Borders chief constable, Sir William Sutherland, and his
then deputy, Mr Hector Clark, were passing and comforted Miss Hardy
until the emergency services arrived and she was cut from the wreckage.
She suffered brain damage as a result of a head injury and a number of
other injuries and was in a coma for several weeks. Her mental and
physical impairments are now chronic.
Mr Cathcart was released from hospital after treatment for an arm
injury.
Miss Hardy has undergone a personality change, suffers from severe
depression, is easily tired, and spends large parts of the day in bed.
She has also developed post-traumatic epilepsy and has to use a
wheelchair when she is out of the house. Since the accident, she has
gained four stones in weight.
Miss Hardy worked as a confectioner but will not be able to work
again.
At the time of the accident, she was engaged to Mr Cathcart but in her
action at the Court of Session, she said that he had since broken off
their engagement.
She also said that, because of her disabilities, her chances of
getting married had been reduced greatly.
Since returning home, she has been dependent on constant care from her
parents, brothers, and sister. She rarely goes out of the house and
enjoys virtually no social life.
Mr Cathcart admitted that he was to blame for the accident and Lord
Johnston was due to hear evidence only on how much compensation Miss
Hardy should receive.
However, Mr Colin McEachran, QC, counsel for Miss Hardy, announced
that a settlement has been reached for a ''substantial six-figure sum''.
He described it as a very sad case.
''Unfortunately, the engagement was broken off,'' Mr McEachran added.
The exact terms of the settlement were not announced in court but the
figure is understood to be about #500,000.

AN attack was launched last night on Grampian Regional Council's
administration for its plans to sell off eight major industrial estates
in an effort to balance its books.
Aberdeen District Councillor Mrs Margaret Farquhar has already asked
the Accounts Commission to investigate the council's actions, and at a
meeting in Aberdeen Town House last night, businessmen who occupy some
of the 115 sites covering 183 acres decided to write to the local
authority ombudsman asking him to investigate.
Grampian Regional Councillor Len Ironside, who admitted he was in the
dark about the dealings, said he would be consulting other opposition
councillors over calling a special council meeting to have the decision
overturned.
Aberdeen's Lord Provost, Councillor Jim Wyness, is to write to the
council to outline the concerns expressed at last night's meeting.
The sale of sites at Kirkhill, Bridge of Don, Pitmedden Road, Murcar,
Farburn, Ellon, Blackhall, and Spurryhillock in Stonehaven, was
condemned as asset stripping of future revenue and jobs.

DESPITE the safeguards, the strengthened foundations, the endless
safety drills, many experts agreed yesterday that there was little Japan
could have done to lessen the impact of the Kobe earthquake.
The country beefed up its seismic regulations in the early 1980s but
yesterday's quake was thought to be too big, too shallow, and too close
to the city to cause anything other than untold devastation.
''It's like standing next to a grenade,'' said one expert. ''There is
little you can do to shield yourself if it goes off, but if you are 20
yards away you have a better chance.''
Dr Johnathan Doody, a seismology expert at Glasgow University, said
the Kobe quake appeared to be quite close to the surface and near a
built-up and populated area.
''If you have a very powerful earthquake occuring very near to your
roads or buildings, there's not a great deal you can do,'' said Dr
Doody. ''Some forces of nature are so big you can do little about
them.''
He said the Japanese were renowned for their earthquake research, but
even sophisticated structural precautions may not have helped.
''They are probably the forerunners of earthquake design work. They
have carried out a lot of research because Japan is a very
earthquake-prone zone, with the Pacific plate going underneath the
Japanese islands. However, quite often the building designs are to
minimise rather than remove the effect.''
The quake was recorded at the British Georgraphical Survey in
Edinburgh. Spokesman Roger Musson said yesterday that they were still
waiting for the biggest aftershock, expected to measure 6 on the Richter
scale, and to strike some time in the next 24 hours. It could just as
devastating as the first.
''The danger is that the buildings that have been damaged by the main
quake will come down,'' he said.
Mr Musson said there would be a lot of investigation into how
different buildings had withstood the earthquake but it was too early to
speculate why so many buidlings and roads had been damaged.
Mr Musson said he had been talking recently to a Japanese earthquake
expert who has spent 30 years studying earthquake predcition. ''They are
hardly anywhere further than they were when they started,'' he said.
''It's becoming clearer and clearer there's no reliable way to predict
earthquakes that will work every time.
''You can try to second-guess nature, but you will be wrong as many
times as you are right.''
Some Japanese experts, however, said they were surprised that their
quake-resistant architecture had crumbled so easily.
''We used to believe that Japanese roads and houses were built well,
so what had happened in California wouldn't happen here,'' said Suminao
Murakami, a Yokohama National University professor. ''That was wrong.''
Others said the magnitude of this quake was too great and that the
Japanese had to accept that they were ''constantly playing cat-and-mouse
with nature''.
''With an earthquake like this . . . we can't help it. That's natural
disaster,'' one said.

THE Government came under renewed attack last night after it appeared
to have backed itself into a corner over the future of railway
through-ticketing.
As Labour stepped up the battle over rail privatisation by announcing
it would target Tories in 60 marginal seats where it claims services are
under threat, the Prime Minister was involved in angry exchanges with
Labour leader Tony Blair.
At the heart of the dispute -- and of a Labour-initiated debate in the
Commons today -- is the recent proposal by Rail Regulator John Swift to
severely cut the number of stations where through-ticketing is
available.
Mr Swift proposed a reduction from 1500 stations to 294, and although
the Government already has said this would be unacceptable, it became
clear yesterday that while Ministers can ''give guidance'' to the
regulator on the matter it cannot force him to change his proposals.
The prospect is that the Government will ''lean'' on Mr Swift to
increase the number of stations where through ticketing will be
available, but that consumers still will face a substantial reduction.
In the Commons yesterday, the Prime Minister swept aside protests by
Mr Blair that through-ticketing was under threat and insisted that rail
privatisation would improve services for customers.
Mr Blair said that people did not want the rail network broken up and
demanded to know what Mr Major would do if Mr Swift did not back
through-ticketing.
Mr Major replied that the regulator had made it ''perfectly clear''
that he was considering responses to his own consultation document, and
he added: ''I will wait and see what proposals the regulator has.''
Labour's new campaign includes three seats in Scotland -- Ayr (Mr Phil
Gallie), Stirling (Mr Michael Forsyth) and Aberdeen South (Mr Raymond
Robertson).
It also has produced a new dossier on the impact of rail privatisation
which, it says, shows that every day Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney
stays in control more trains are cancelled, stations are allowed to
decline and safety is put at risk.
Labour's Transport spokesman Henry McLeish said: ''Our campaign
against rail privatisation will be on a broad front, and we know we can
make the Tories pay dear for their decision to press ahead.
''Every Tory MP with a small majority wil know that they are voting
for rail privatisation at their own risk. Labour will turn up the heat
as much as it takes to stop the sell-off and remove its supporters from
Parliament.''
For Scotland, the dossier claims: ''The merging of five sleeper
services into two reduces the number of London to Scotland trains on the
west coast route. It begins to undermine the reason for keeping the line
up to scratch for the remaining few.
''With the demise of Motorail and the loss of additional summer
services, a cloud hangs over the continued viability of local economies
in many small Highland communities, such as Fort William, and in the
South-west of England.''
* Aberdeen South's Tory MP Raymond Robertson last night reacted
angrily to being included on Labour's ''hit list.'' He said: ''The
inclusion of my name on this list shows a gross lack of research on
Labour's part. After privatisation, Aberdeen station will continue to
provide all the functions of the major rail terminus it is. I believe
privatisation will bring increased choice to rail passengers in the
North-east.''

SCOTLAND, hosts of the #1.4m 1997 World Badminton Championships, may
not have enough cash to finance the full Scottish squad making the trip
to Lausanne in May for this year's championships.
The Scottish Badminton Union will have an anxious wait till the end of
the month to see if funds will be available from the Sports Council
following a meeting last week between badminton bosses and Sports
Council officials.
This meeting aimed to thrash out the details of the SBU's ambitious
four-year development plan, which promises to improve Scotland's world
ranking from No.14 to No.12 this year and to No.10 by 1997.
Ideally, the Scottish Badminton Union need a budget of #150,000 for
training alone, but have a scaled-down scheme -- at a cost of #71,000 --
to come into effect if the decision of the Council is unfavourable.
''We want to send 10 players and hopefully a physiotherapist to this
year's world championships come what may,'' said chief executive Anne
Smillie.
''But obviously the decision of the council will have a bearing on our
plans.
''The money for the trip will come out of our performance and
excellence budget for the four-year period.
''Provided we can carry out most of our plans, I think our goals of
becoming tenth in the world and No.4 in Europe are very realistic.''
With the size of the team still in the balance and no-one willing to
take any chances with their place, competition will be sharpened at the
Hydro-Electic National Championships next month at Meadowbank, in
Edinburgh, the main selection base for the team along with the current
Scottish rankings.

DUNDEE United's chairman Jim McLean last night broke his silence on
long-term contracts at Tannadice which could lead football into court as
at least two of his players, Gary Bollan and Billy McKinlay, seek
justice.
United's policy of signing players on contracts with option periods
attached -- Bollan signed for four years with a four-year option -- has
been criticised in various quarters recently and McLean feels it is time
to put his side of the story.
Bollan lost his appeal to the Scottish League and today lodges a
second appeal with the SFA, who will be asked to declare the option part
of his contract void because of what he believes to be ambiguous
wording. However, the SFA are likely to find in the club's favour, which
means the under-21 internationalist will have to go to court. McKinlay
has already moved in that direction.
''I believe some of the criticism is coming from people who have a
grudge against me personally,'' said McLean, who was United's manager
for 21 years. ''I can handle that but I have decided to have my say,
because I don't believe this club deserves the criticism being thrown at
it.
''Many aspects of what is being claimed against us are distorted. No
young player has ever been forced to sign a contract at this club by
being locked in a room, as has been suggested in some quarters.
''When a youngster signs his first contract here, we ask that both
parents be present if possible. And when we offer him a new contract a
few more years down the line, he is given written details of the terms
and we ask him to take them away and discuss them with his parents.
''Only after that do we produce a contract with these terms and look
for him signing it.''
However, it is not every parent who has knowledge of contracts of
employment, whether they be offered by the local supermarket or football
club, and FIFA themselves have accepted that long-term contracts should
not be entered into between clubs and youngsters.
Nevertheless, McLean continues: ''It is suggested that if the option
clause on a contract is later taken up, it is all to the advantage of
the club. I would point to the fact that we have to take up the entire
option period and, therefore, offer extra job security.
''And it is equally wrong for people to try to suggest that we are the
only club who deal in option clauses on contracts. The alleged
unfairness of our contracts only appears to surface when a player
believes he has given us good service -- sometimes over a very short
space of time -- and wants to move on.
''Don't the club have a right to expect some return for their
long-term investment in the player? Nobody ever points to the fact that
we make a huge investment in our youth policy, and nobody ever singles
out a player who has been here 10 years and never played in the first
team. Our investment in that single player could run to #100,000.
''If good players can dictate when they want to leave, should we have
the right to tear up the bad deals and get out of contracts that are not
successful?
''People do seem to forget players are sold by this club and, indeed,
have to be, because we must find the finance to meet all our
commitments. But these players move on and make their big money from the
game partly because of the good grounding they have been given by a
youth development system which is recognised as being among the best.
''When you talk about contracts spanning eight years, it should be
remembered that we may only see the benefit for two years and spend the
other six investing for that short time.''
As the rumblings of discontent continue, the manager, Ivan Golac, said
last night: ''I have never known so much unhappiness within a club and I
would gladly sell them all and bring in people who were interested in
doing their best for themselves and their families.''

IT can be tough on your family when you have to move home for your
job, but the impact on pets really gives paws for thought. If you are
looking to rent while relocating, finding a landlord who will welcome
Fido or Tiddles, or put up with chewed furniture and widdles, can be
difficult indeed.
However pets are welcome at Drummit Mill, a country retreat available
for rent in Dalmary, near Gartmore, just south of Aberfoyle.
The converted mill house occcupies an idyllic setting, with the River
Kelty flowing at the bottom of the well-established garden.
There is plenty of garden space for the family dog, rabbit or guinea
pig. It also offers an opportunity to get some relief from the daily
grind at the office and enjoy some country living at the weekend.
The area is surrounded by beautiful countryside and there are plenty
of places to walk the dog -- with more trees than you could cock a leg
at in a canine lifestime.
Aberfoyle, which is within easy reach, has a number of forest track
walks, cycling routes and places to visit. The area is dotted with
beautiful lochs for those who enjoy fishing.
The house has a hallway which can be utilised as a sitting area,
lounge, living room, dining room, dining kitchen, utility room, four
bedrooms (one with en suite shower room) and bathroom with electric
shower. The electric heating is complemented by a wood-burning stove in
the kitchen.
Slater Hogg Lettings is offering Drummit Mill to let at #850 per
calendar month, and the rental includes the services of a gardener.

THE most famous name in British motorsport ran out of fuel yesterday.
After 36 years, six world drivers' championship titles, seven
constructors' titles, and 79 victories from 490 grands prix starts,
Lotus confirmed they will not have a team in Formula One racing this
year.
David Hunt, who bought the debt-laden company in October, confirmed
that he has been unable to raise the finance to keep them on track.
The staff of 60 has been told they are redundant, although Hunt hopes
to put together a partnership package, giving Lotus representation on
the circuit and preserving slim hopes of a possible comeback.
''What I want to avoid is allowing the team to be put in a situation
where it is going to struggle around at the back of the grid, and have
its name dragged further through the mud,'' said Hunt, brother of the
late former world champion, James Hunt.
''The other possibility is to take steps to re-finance . . . with a
view to returning to the grid in good order in 1996.
''Whilst the situation is bitterly disappointing with regard to the
staff, whose support and encouragement has been exemplary, there are
still real possibilities for the future. I am confident that there is a
path through all this to long-term security.
''Other than Ferrari, the Team Lotus name is arguably the strongest in
grand prix racing. It is therefore inconceivable to me that I will not
be able to build a package around it, given time to focus in that area
rather than on the myriad of challenges we have been facing hitherto.''
Even though later drivers were to include Graham Hill, Jochen Rindt,
Emerson Fittipaldi, Mario Andretti, Nigel Mansell, and Ayrton Senna, it
was Berwickshire farmer Jim Clark who was most synonymous with Team
Lotus, winning world championships in 1963 and '65, and laying the
foundations for seven constructors' titles from 1963 to '78.
In the history of motor racing, no partnership has been as successful
as that between Clark and the late Colin Chapman, the engineering genius
who founded the company in 1952 and who took it into F1 six years later,
heralding an unbroken presence which is now over.

Falkirk 1, Partick Thistle 3
BROCKVILLE rarely allows 90 minutes to pass without dramatics, if not
finesse. Although the home side had been hard done by to be a goal down
at the interval, they equalised early enough to sort out the problems.
But they reckoned without the old Jags' penchant for defying the norm.
Thistle did not even match Falkirk for a long time, but this was the
night they found the route to goal.
For Thistle's assistant manager Gerry Collins, the performance showed
that his team are capable of staying up. He said: ''We scored against
the run of play but I thought we played some good football in the second
half.''
Falkirk manager Jim Jefferies, whose team have not won for 10 games,
was depressed by the way his side lost their goals. ''But when you
defend as badly as we did, you destroy anything you achieve,'' he added.
Alan Dinnie put Thistle in front but Scott McKenzie equalised after
the break. Goals from Wayne Foster and Derek McWilliams, however, doused
any Bairns' ambitions.
Thistle, with the wind at their backs, had looked as likely to put the
ball in the net as those of us sitting in the stand, yet they went in
front with perhaps their third venture upfield in the first half-hour.
Albert Craig's chip from an acute angle was knocked away for a corner
by McKenzie. However, from Charnley's corner Dinnie flicked the ball
over the line at the far post.
Eddie May should have gone closer than he did with a header from about
12 yards after Colin McDonald had laid the ball on his forehead, and it
was soon after that his team were stunned by Dinnie's goal. That lifted
Partick's morale through to half-time. In fact, it needed a fine save by
Parks to defy a second goal for them, when Alex Taylor hit a good strike
from 14 yards.
But it was hard to see Falkirk failing to make some kind of
impression, so much of the play had they captured against the wind. They
needed only 12 minutes of the second half to equalise. Tommy McQueen hit
a fierce shot which Steve Pittman managed to head out, but McKenzie
smacked a well-placed shot out of Walker's reach.
Back came Thistle, ducking under the wind, and when Welsh sent over a
long cross from the left, Foster dipped his head to nod it over the
line.
Nine minutes later they added a third. Foster did some good work down
the right and passed to Craig, who glided past McQueen and sent the ball
along to Derek McWilliams. He sent the keeper the wrong way before
shooting into the corner.

Kilmarnock 2, Motherwell 0
AYRSHIRE was no place for outsiders last night as Motherwell, who had
been clinging desperately to a slender hope of still making up ground on
Rangers, found to their cost.
Two first-half goals by Tom Black sealed the Fir Park side's fate and
left their manager, Alex McLeish, wondering what could be done to
restore the confidence which made his players strut throughout the first
half of the season.
Kilmarnock, on the other hand, are just beginning to find a proper
rhythm and their win lifted them further away from the drop zone, and
they could distance themselves from relegation even more when they play
Falkirk at Rugby Park on Saturday.
However, they will have to tackle that match without one of their best
players, Neil Whitworth. The central defender, who missed last
Saturday's match against Celtic, was back in place last night, but he
faces another suspension, this time for two matches starting on
Saturday.
Still, the enthusiasm which seemed to be coursing through Kilmarnock
last night is unlikely to be diluted and Alex Totten is entitled to
believe better things lie ahead for his side.
The manner in which they made the howling wind work to their advantage
against Motherwell suggests his players are getting to grips with what
is required to survive in the top flight.
Black's first goal was scored in eight minutes after Paul Lambert had
impeded Ally Mitchell 22 yards frim Motherwell's goal. Mark Reilly
rolled the free kick to Black, who thumped the ball low towards goal.
''I was aware of the strong wind blowing behind me and I thought that
if I could hit the target Motherwell's keeper might spill the ball and
allow us a chance to score,'' said Black. ''But I was delighted when I
saw the ball go into the net.''
If the truth be told, Black's shot may have taken a deflection as it
past through the densely populated penalty box, but the defender was
entitled to claim all the credit.
His second goal was scored four minutes from half-time after Robert
Connor had played the ball left to right for Mitchell. When his cross
arrived on the middle Miodrag Krivokapic pushed John Henry when there
was no immediate danger and the referee had to award the penalty. Black
did what he normally does from the spot.
In the second half Motherwell created opportunities but they could not
cope with the wind or Kilmarnock's defence. The Rugby Park side were
more than happy to play without frills and as time slipped away
Motherwell's work became more erratic.
They probably realised after 38 minutes that this would not be their
night. Tommy Coyne controlled the ball and turned in one fluent movement
on the edge of Kilmarnock's box and tried a delicate chip shot which
carried beyond the keeper. Unfortunately for Coyne and Motherwell, the
ball bounced off a post and that was as close as Motherwell came to
finding the net.
They did feel they should have been awarded a penalty late in the
match when Steve Kirk lunged at a ball almost under Kilmarnock's bar and
somehow managed to head over. Afterwards, McLeish said his players felt
one of Kilmarnock's defenders had used a hand to flick the ball away.
''The wind spoiled the match because both sides normally like to play
decent football,'' said Totten, ''but these are terrific points for us
at this stage especially when you consider Motherwell are a top side. I
have a lot of respect for them and hopefully this win will be a new
start for us.''
The Kilmarnock manager mentioned the contribution of Black and also
his goalkeeper, Dragoje Lekovic, who made some fine saves to deny
Motherwell.
McLeish also praised Lekovic and said that he may consider giving
players like Andy Roddie and Shaun McSkimming, who was used as a
substitute last night, a longer run in the first team in an attempt to
haul the club out of what seems to be something of a rut.
KILMARNOCK -- Lekovic, MacPherson, Black, Reilly, Whitworth, Anderson,
Mitchell, Henry, Brown, Connor, McKee. Substitutes -- Williamson,
Maskrey, Meldrum.
MOTHERWELL -- Howie, Shannon, McKinnon, Krivokapic, Martin, McCart,
Lambert, Dolan, Coyne, Kirk, Davies. Substitutes -- McGrillen,
McSkimming, Woods.
Referee -- K Clark (Glasgow).

The big switch-off: David Belcher looks for the reasons behind the
downward spiral of Radio 1's listening figures
WHAT went wrong with Steve Wright In The Morning? Is Radio 1 in the
twilight? By how many more millions will the station's listening figures
have plunged by the end of this month? Emma Freud's fled; Danny Baker's
been sliced in half -- will there be lasting success for any of the
changes instituted by Radio 1 overseer Matthew Bannister?
And how many listeners will accompany Steve Wright when he eventually
jumps Radio 1's flagship programme for his well-publicised new berth on
Talk Radio, yet another independent newcomer against whom the BBC must
fight what has so far been a losing battle in radio's numbers game?
These and other such white-knuckle questions will be uppermost in the
minds of Bannister and his beleaguered colleagues in Radio 1's command
bunker as they face another D-Day on Monday, January 30, with the
release of the most up-to-date set of listenership figures collated by
Radio Joint Audience Research Limited.
RAJAR's last set of quarterly figures underlined Radio 1's continuance
on a downward spiral under Bannister's stewardship, revealing a
year-on-year listenership fall from 15,743,000 a week to 11,197,000, a
decline in the station's share of the adult radio audience from 34% to
24%. Pre-Bannister, early in 1993, Radio 1 had 16,067,000 listeners.
And with each setback, the amount of hostile criticism has increased,
of course. In implementing BBC director general John Birt's doctrine of
producer choice and charter renewal, Bannister was accused of ruthless
elitism by duplicitous newspapers with transglobal broadcasting
ambitions of their own. Gab not pop, they sneered of his avowed efforts
to make Radio 1 intelligent as well as entertaining.
And all because Matthew Bannister's bloodstained axe chopped
traditional airwave-faves Simon Bates and the Hairy Cornflake, Dave Lee
Travis.
Steve Wright's forthcoming defection, after years of Radio 1 success,
has been seized upon as a body-blow to the station. Yet according to Ken
Garner, long-time Radio 1 observer and lecturer on the communications
and mass media degree course at Caledonian University, Steve Wright and
his breakfast show were a manifest reflection of how poor the station's
management has become.
''Moving him to a morning slot in a rigid, unadventurous and lazy
format betrayed a lack of managerial confidence. 'Steve Wright's been a
winner. Don't take any risks. Keep him tight.' ''
Rigid, unadventurous and lazy format?
''Steve keeps giving the weather and the time in every link, for
example, breaking a classic radio rule which says people can't cope with
both bits of information at once. It's belt-and-braces stuff, betraying
a lack of self-belief.
''And to hear Steve Wright continually boasting about how many bands
have been signed since we introduced our unsigned bands feature --
committed music fans, the ones who favour new bands, haven't forgotten
that this is the man who said: 'I wouldn't play the Smiths on my show,
they're too difficult.'
''In its defence, Radio 1 is always on a hiding to nothing in that it
has to be all things to all men in an age when success is only
guaranteed to stations who target a specific audience. There's an
intractable problem in having to face a threat from an increasing number
of aggressively marketed commercial stations with no public service
obligations whatsoever. There has also been a demographic change in that
Radio 1 is still intended as a youth service when Britain is less
youthful.''
So Radio 1 was bound to lose listeners anyway, including a million at
a stroke when the station switched from medium wave to FM. But so many
in such a short space of time? Could they all have been devotees of the
dinosaur duo of DLT and Bates?
Quite possibly, however horrifying that might seem to folk like me who
reckon themselves clued-up members of the cultural intelligentsia.
Additionally, Bannister made two big mistakes when he elbowed Simes and
the Hairy Monster. Their replacements, eternal student Simon Mayo and
bland hipster Mark Goodier, simply weren't good enough -- and still
aren't -- and Bannister also imposed a stranglehold on choice in Radio
1's daytime music policy.
''People responded when Bates chose to play oldies or two soul belters
from Mariah Carey's new album back-to-back,'' says Garner. ''They knew
that he and DLT could look at the back of a CD cover and recognise some
of the names. You see, before April 1994, prior to a policy introduced
by the now-departed Paul Robinson, half the daytime records in any hour
were from the official playlist and half were chosen by the presenter
and his producer.
''Now, although the playlist is wider, only one record in every
daytime hour is chosen by the presenter. So it's even less easy to trust
Radio 1 DJs about music.''
Despite this week's changes in the way the Radio 1 daytime playlist is
assembled -- more album tracks, no pre-1990 oldies -- there is no return
to personal choice.
Maybe there is hope in the demise of Emma Freud, whose ignorance of
what was in the grooves grew clearer every day. Famously, she believed
MC Hammer to be McHammer. She embodied New Establishment metrocentric
luvvieness talking to itself somewhere post-modern in Soho. Ian Hislop's
just popped in from Private Eye, and Danny Baker, and Danny Kelly,
editor of Q, and here's a new comedian being oh-so-ironic about some
music he'll playing on his own Radio 1 show, and here's a
consciously-kitsch Batman serial . . .
Yet with each ratings crisis, Radio 1 appears more desperate and
frightened, its management locked into a destructive cycle, continually
attempting a panicked response to bad news.
Figures down? Hire Lynn Franks, PR person to the self-same London
luvvies whose prattle has been driving folk away. Or unite with The Sun
to elect six persons-in-the-street as your music advisers in order to
trail their grating voices saying how great Radio 1 is.
New presenters? Forget folk making their way through radio's ranks . .
. try to buy in Chris Tarrant. Imported from MTV, career presenter Lisa
I'Anson sports what's meant to be an archetypally sexy voice, but you're
sure it knows not of what it speaks.
And in typically paradoxical British fashion, folk lament Radio 1's
decline as surely and strongly as they desert it for something even
worse: commercial radio, home of the cheap, the conservative, and the
blindly formulaic.
We demand that Radio 1 DJs sound familiar, authoritative, witty,
independent, but above all musically knowledgeable and enthusiastic . .
. and when they fail us, we turn to commercial radio, whose presenters
we've always known have had no musical choice.
British music radio in the gloaming of the twentieth century. With
rare exceptions, it's tragically less than onederful.

<HEADLINE>NFU seeking aid measures to counter disruption to exports</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>980304015</RECORDNO>

SCOTTISH farmers' leaders warned the Government yesterday that if the
present disruption of the export market for calves leads to a sustained
fall in prices for beef cattle, they will be looking for measures to
protect farm incomes.
Scottish Office Agriculture Minister Sir Hector Monro promised
co-operation in seeking to identify market opportunities for those
animals unexpectedly retained on the farm for finishing.
Mr John Ross, president of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland,
and Mr Tom Brady, chief executive, met Sir Hector in London to press
home their concern that early progress should be made on the issues of
animal transport and veal production in Europe.
Mr Ross said afterwards: ''We have told the Government that they must
monitor market developments. Action must be taken if farm incomes come
under pressure. We must not be penalised for the actions of others, and
the violent disruption of legal trade must be stopped.''
It is estimated that about 500,000 calves a year are exported from
Britain to the Continent, achieving prices of up to #100 a head. The
Scottish share of that trade could be between 30,000 and 40,000 calves.
The loss of that income would be serious enough for dairy farmers, but
in the longer-term the farmers' concerns are about the effect on prices
in the beef market, if an additional 500,000 cattle have to be absorbed.
The NFUS are hoping that before any serious distortion takes place,
the Government will step in with measures to syphon-off some of the
surplus supply. Mechanisms already exist under Intervention Board
arrangements, but the fear is that by the time intervention is possible,
due to low prices, the market will already be in crisis. There are
concerns, too, about the possible knock-on effects for the sheep and pig
markets.
Mr Ross said that he had called on the Government to maintain pressure
for a European agreement on animal transport rules. ''This subject has
been on the table for far too long,'' he said.
''The laws on calf production methods on the Continent are out of step
with public opinion. Pressure must be put on the European Commission to
make urgent proposals for a review of these laws.''
Scottish farmers would like to see much more meat processed in
Scotland, backed by the quality and farm assurance movements which had
been spearheaded here.
Sir Hector Monro welcomed the initiative taken by the NFUS to secure
the support of European farmers in making progress on the transport
issue, and promised that the Government would continue to work hard for
improvements on that front. ''I also hope we can persuade other
countries to follow the UK's lead in bringing to an end the use of veal
crates,'' he said.
''We need to see a change in public opinion on the Continent, and I
hope that animal welfare organisations will also direct their efforts to
the rest of Europe.''
He promised that his Department would work with the industry to
develop ways of finding other markets for animals retained within the
beef sector at home. ''We have an excellent record for increasing meat
exports over the last few years, and we must look to build on this,'' he
said.
* A further three Scottish farms have been freed from controls imposed
in the wake of the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986. Forty-one
holdings in Dumfries and Galloway, Strathclyde and Central Regions,
covering some 86,000 sheep, remain subject to restrictions, because they
are still considered to pose a possible threat to the food chain. In the
immediate aftermath of Chernobyl, more than 2000 Scottish farms had
restrictions placed on them.
The farms which have now been cleared, following extensive monitoring
for radioactivity, cover more than 4000 sheep. They are in Stewartry,
Cumnock and Doon Valley, and Stirling districts.
The Scottish Office Agriculture Department has been operating a ''mark
and release'' colour code system, which means that marked animals sold
from restricted farms are required to be held for three months before
they can be slaughtered. Radioactivity levels have been shown to fall
rapidly once sheep leave a restricted area.

IRISH songwriter Christie Hennessy was accorded minor cult-hero status
with groups of fans following him around the building after an all too
short set of self-penned songs. Quality material such as If You Were To
Fall, Sunshine's On My Baby, and his poignant song about the Troubles,
Sheila Dowan, are far too good for this man to be given mere 20-minute
slots for much longer. Five holders held seven electric candles apiece
as Loreena McKennitt appeared on the dimly-lit stage, her straw-coloured
hair tumbling on to a full-length black velvet dress -- pretty much
regulation wear for Goths on the town.
Sandalwood and the dreaded musk billowed around me as the audience
restlessly prepared for some pretty heavy vibes of myth, magic, and
mysticism. They didn't have long to wait.
W B Yeats's The Stolen Child gets the McKennitt treatment -- electric
fiddle builds to moody climax while underpinned by synthesised bass
chords, sparse percussion and double bass, but the overall ''haunting''
effect wears off long before the band does.
A monologue introduces our next psychological journey: ''Drear dark
lake, with duck and drake.'' But just as the squirming begins, her
crystal-clear voice and harp fills the hall with the first lines of She
Moved Through the Fair and McKennitt holds the audience in the palm of
her hand for a spellbinding few minutes till yet another lover goes the
way of all flesh.
The Lady of Shalott, however, slipped back into the Goth groove, and
soon we were off Searching Between The Shadows in a bid to locate our
Celtic souls and doubtless an Arthurian rune or two. Fans of Dungeons
and Dragons would have loved it.

Quangos flourish in Scotland: their cost might help pay for a Scottish
parliament
IT is a growth industry. There will be 5000 of them employed next
year, and they will earn anything from #4000, part-time, to #40,000 if
they fancy taking the chair.
Qualifications for the job remain something of a mystery. So long,
though, as you are confident enough to divvy up around #6bn of public
money you may be in with a shout.
To stand a chance of joining, your name must be held in a grey filing
cabinet parked in Room 237 on the second floor of St Andrew's House in
Edinburgh.
Scotland's quangocracy is thriving.
But be warned: don't tango with a quango unless you are ready to be
scrutinised for political allegiance, stand accused of being a Tory
tool, and are prepared to be patronised by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang.
And it may in the long run turn out to be a temporary posting.
Yesterday, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson gave notice in a
radio debate that the unelected legions who make up the Scottish
quangocracy are about to be put to the cost benefit analysis test.
An incoming Labour government, he warned, would use the savings made
by ridding Scotland of many of the unelected, unaccountable, bodies
appointed by political patronage to help fund a Scottish parliament.
Which ones? How much? The answers, so far, remain sketchy.
Mr Robertson has set in train an investigation into the overall costs
and areas of responsibility that are in the hands of unelected bodies.
These range from the boards of Local Enterprise Companies, members of
health trusts and those appointed to run the new water boards to crime
prevention panels.
The results of the year-long investigation will be given to the
party's Scottish conference in March. Chief of the Quango Watch is Irene
Adams, the Paisley North MP.
There are, she says, 130 Scottish quangos. Next year there will be
5000 unelected members compared with 1500 elected councillors. Something
of a democratic deficit, she thinks.
The government-appointed organisations control 40% of the Scottish
Office budget, wielding massive influence in areas of Scottish life,
such as health and housing. Yet they are answerable to nobody except
their political masters.
And, says Mrs Adams, there is growing evidence of waste and unecessary
duplication of functions: ''They are literally accountable to nobody,
running up huge administrative costs yet closed to public scrutiny.''
She cites Scottish Homes, the Government-funded public housing body,
which has administrative costs of around #38m a year. ''They have a
separate budget from the local council's housing revenue accounts. But
that's a small example. There are many functions run by these quangos
which should be under the control of locally elected members.''
The other accusation is that quangos are stacked full of Tory
loyalists and that this constitutes an unprecedented centralisation of
power without public accountability: ''When you do manage to get hold of
a list of members, and not without a great deal of difficulty I can tell
you, you may well find, as I did, that it contains just names. It's
often impossible to check out credentials.
''One membership list of a Crime Prevention Panel, for example,
included the first name, no second name, of a woman described as a
victim of crime.
''I can tell you there are any number of victims of crime in my
constituency who are not on quangos.''
The Government, however, argues that the real rapid growth in
unelected bodies took place between 1959 and 1979 under Labour as well
as Conservative governments.
The Opposition would argue that there is little wrong in principle
with the idea that some functions are best carried out by boards which
have an arms-length relationship with central government, free from
political interference. The arts and conservation interests for
instance.
It is in the more politically sensitive areas, such as management of
the health trusts and the direction of local enterprise companies, that
quangos become contentious.
The Scottish Secretary counters the quango-bashers by claiming that
the dedication and expertise of those appointed by him represent an
important contribution to public life in Scotland, and that they have
helped make the provision of public services more efficient.
Mr Lang has argued that a Government report in 1980 identified 84
executive public bodies for which the Scottish Secretary was
responsible. Since then that number has been halved.
That, however, depends on definitions. The figure excludes the most
recent quangos with control over their own budgets, such as the hospital
trusts and Lecs.
Now here is a question: what then is the difference between a Quasi
Autonomous Non-Government Organisation and a Non-Departmental Public
Body?
Here is the answer: it all depends on what you call an unelected
outfit appointed by political patronage to spend your money.
A request to the Scottish Office yesterday for a full list of all
unelected bodies which receive Government money was met with an extract
from the Cabinet Office publication Public Bodies 1993.
It details a total of 160 Non-Departmental Public Bodies -- without
naming them -- sponsored by the Scottish Office. This, the attached note
stresses, compares to 244 such bodies in 1979. Confused? You are not
alone.

In a dramatic departure from its usual repertoire, the SCO is to
perform an adaptation of Michael Nyman's score for Prospero's Books.
Elizabeth Clark reports
WILLIAM Shakespeare chose to set The Tempest on an ''isle full of
noises''. What more could composer Michael Nyman have asked as
inspiration for his film score to accompany Peter Greenaway's 1991
screen version, Prospero's Books?
The composer created a rich and diverse soundtrack combining vocal and
instrumental music to great effect. Along with his work for The Piano,
Drowning By Numbers and The Draughtsman's Contract, it is one of the
most successful film scores of the eighties and nineties.
Nyman was recently commissioned by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra
(with funding from the Royal Bank of Scotland) to create an adaption of
the Prospero's Books score -- basically condensing and re-orchestrating
the existing film score -- for chamber ensemble. The new piece receives
its world premiere in Edinburgh this week.
Like fellow composers Philip Glass, Louis Andriessen, Steve Reich and
Steve Martland, Nyman has focused his recent activity around his own
band. Not only has he composed most of his music for it but The Michael
Nyman Band has also made an important contribution to chopping away at
the barriers separating classical, jazz and rock music.
For the SCO, Nyman's composition is a journey into new and unfamiliar
territory, a wise move considering the continued uncertainty surrounding
Scotland's premiere new music orchestra, the BBC SSO.
Drawing from the instrumental movements of the existing song score,
the Suite from Prospero's Books promises an envigorating listen,
contrasting Nyman's familiar minimalist techniques of pulsating rhythmic
energy and shimmering lyricism.
Those familiar with the Nyman film score will recall his settings of
Shakespeare's five Ariel songs. One of them -- Where the Bee Sucks --
was the inspiration behind the second of Nyman's works included in the
SCO programme. The saxophone concerto Where the Bee Dances was written
to celebrate the talents of John Harle who joins the orchestra for this
performance.
Constructed in one continuous movement, the concerto is based on a
4-chord sequence which Harle overhead Nyman playing and which he
subsequently expressed a particular liking for. Harle believes the raw
almost graffiti-like use of these classic harmonic cells as
compositional building blocks is what gives the piece its distinctive
character.
The title of the piece also refers to the circular orientation dances
performed by a bee in search of nectar. Tracing these sporadic
movements, the concerto combines dramatic bursts of activity with
honey-sweet lyricism -- perfect for the eclectic performance technique
of Harle.
Elsewhere in the programme the SCO will perform Vivaldi's Concerto
No.5 La Tempesta di Mare and Stravinsky's Dances Concertantes. Conductor
Ivor Bolton is no stranger to Nyman -- he conducted the Bournemouth
Sinfonietta and John Harle in Argo's 1992 recording of the Saxophone
Concerto. A recommended addition to your collection, this disc also
includes saxophone music by Gavin Bryars and Mike Westbrook.
* The SCO performs Michael Nyman, Vivaldi and Stravinsky at the
Queen's Hall, Edinburgh tomorrow, and the City Hall, Glasgow on Friday.

IT is a fine invention, your package tour. Good enough for the
creators of rock'n'roll and the soul talents on Motown and Stax, it is a
marketing exercise that actually offers the punter value for money.
The Woman's Heart albums, compiling the female talents of Ireland
under the banner of a self-pitying ditty penned by Eleanor McEvoy, have
raised the profile of those involved at home and overseas. This tour
features four of the best known names -- Mary Coughlan, Frances and Mary
Black, and Sharon Shannon -- with a brief appearance by new face Sinead
Lohan. Coughlan's too was curtailed by the fact that she was appearing
in Glasgow on the same night as part of Celtic Connections -- a
coincidence of programming that appeared to have affected attendance not
at all. She still had time to supply one of the evening's highlights
with her tango reading of 'Tain't Nobody's Business.
Frances Black's chummy stage manner should stick in your teeth, but
somehow doesn't. From unaccompanied Ewan MacColl to songs by Mark Nevin,
formerly of Fairground Attraction, she wears her folk roots on her
sleeve but doesn't let them weigh her down, even when the substantial
female contingent in the audience joined in the miserable chorus of Wall
of Tears.
After rather too little in the way of an instrumental interlude by
accordionist Sharon Shannon, Mary Black's large band made clear who was
the headliner. If only the price of that status did not have to be a
certain blandness in the arrangements of leader and guitarist Declan
Sinnott. A radical re-reading of Billie Holiday's Don't Explain apart,
there was nothing really memorable in her set.

LAST NIGHT was the turn of the band with the most ex-members in the
Celtic Connections programme. De Dannan get through so many personnel
changes that even their main man, Frankie Gavin, can take two tries at
remembering the name of the musician sitting next to him.
In this case it was the young English button accordionist, Luke
Daniels, whose partership with Gavin hasn't yet arrived at the
two-as-one stage that his predecessor and the cause of Gavin's Freudian
slip, Aidan Coffey, reached. However, his solo feature showed exactly
why he's been asked to join.
This wasn't, perhaps, a classic De Dannan showing. These can be all
but overwhelming, but this one had its moments, too, such as Gavin's
Rambles of Bach (yes, the Irishing of Johann Sebastian) and the
exuberant Kerry polkas skelped along by Colm Murphy's terrific bodhran
playing.
Tommy Fleming's singing is technically marvellous, as he showed when
unaccompanied, although he can be a little too schooled. His plan on
Holy Ground to go to a public house and make the rafters ring didn't
sound entirely believable, but Hard Times did convince. Mind you, any
singer stands a good chance of sounding convincing when this band gets
into overdrive, as they were by this time.
Earlier, Mairi Campbell and Dave Francis turned the Grand Ballroom
into a single end, playing fiddle and guitar respectively and singing
simply and quietly. I particularly liked their Green Grow the Rashes-o,
whose arrangement suggested that one of the girls referred to came from
Ipanema, and Mairi's step dancing finale drew loud and deserved
applause.

WHILE David Scott has long been one of Glasgow's more highly regarded
songwriters, his various bands have rarely enjoyed any great critical or
public approval outwith his home city. This comes in spite of last
year's understated and under-rated Za Za's Garden album, which still
forms the basis of much of their live set, and their building of a
decent-sized and appreciative local audience.
Like the album, much of the best of the set is fairly minimalist and
semi-acoustic, consisting mainly of piano, brushed drums, and the
occasional accordion, forsaking the big, anthemic rock sounds they were
making in their earlier incarnations.
The highlights often come where the songs are at their simplest, as on
the opening Bottle of the Best and Rhinestones in My Eyes.
Ironically the Pearlfishers are possibly the least Celtic act of the
entire festival, their major influences being culled almost exclusively
from outwith the Celtic sphere, marrying maverick part-time geniuses
like Brian Wilson, Bob Dylan, and Paul McCartney with a solid dose of
the better elements of 1970s west coast American rock.
The most Celtic it gets is some Van Morrison-like ad-libbing at the
end of the single St Francis Songs and the introduction of
Capercaillie's Donald Shaw as a special guest, but the overwhelming
feeling from the show is that the Pearlfishers have a surplus of great,
unheard pop songs like Banana Sandwich, Sadness of a King, and Jelly
Shoes.
This at times energetic, at times enchanting show suggests a band
whose longevity has strengthened its hand musically, and which deserves
to be discovered by a wider public, and rediscovered by a so far
indifferent music industry.

CARING for an elderly relative can be both physically demanding and
stressful, especially if that relative suffers from even the mildest
dementia. Often the carer herself (or himself) is no longer in the first
flush of youth and the decision to opt for long-term residential care is
a very difficult one, often arrived at in extreme circumstances.
Greenbank Ltd., who run two registered nursing homes in Hamilton, are
well aware of the problems, and address them in a sensitive and highly
professional manner. And most important, they provide a safe,
comfortable and supportive atmosphere for their residents that is a real
home-from-home. Relatives can feel genuinely relieved that they have
made the right decision if they opt for Greenbank.
Many modern nursing homes tend to be over-large, with long corridors
and an institutional feel about them, but Greenbank Ltd. believes that
''small is beautiful'', and both their homes are pleasantly intimate,
with a tangibly warm and homely atmosphere.
Dedicated nursing care is provided 24 hours a day and the ratio of
nurses to residents is very high.
The company aims to treat all residents as individuals, and to respect
their right to freedom of choice, to privacy and confidentiality.
Residents and their families are involved in the planning,
implementation and evaluation of patient care and the aim, says matron
manager Carol Anderson, ''is to restore, maintain, promote and maximise
the independence of the resident utilising the expertise of all members
of the care team.'' Greenbank, which opened in 1990, is a beautifully
restored Victorian villa peacefully situated close to Hamilton town
centre, and very handy for bus routes and the railway station.
The custom-built modern garden wing caters for up to 28 residents --
all ladies -- in comfortable, restful surroundings, and tasty,
traditional home cooking and baking is provided by the head chef and
catering staff.
Lornebank, just two minutes from Greenbank, was custom built to
extremely high standards in 1992. It offers fresh, bright accommodation
for 42 residents of both sexes and there are some married couples. Both
homes offer single or double rooms, and while families may initially
feel that they would be happier if their relation had a single room, it
is often the case that sharing can be positively therapeutic.
Indeed it is now recognised that single rooms can add to the elderly
person's sense of isolation, and it is increasingly noticed that many
residents respond to company, actually prefer to share a room, and
brighten significantly when doing so.
''But naturally'', says director Alastair Murning, ''each prospective
resident is assessed by Greenbank's qualified staff to ensure that
individual needs can be met prior to taking up residence.'' Whether
double or single, rooms at Greenbank and Lornebank are spacious yet
cosy. Residents are encouraged to bring their favourite pieces of
furniture or pictures to help them feel at home, and visiting is open so
that they can enjoy family visits in a relaxed atmosphere.
Staff at both Lornebank and Greenbank notice that many of their
residents blossom on coming to the homes, and put on weight -- testimony
to both catering departments. The programme of occupational therapy
undoubtedly plays a significant part here too, as residents are
encouraged to pursue their old hobbies or to take part in fresh
activities. Reminiscence therapy is used, and communication of all kinds
is encouraged at the nursing homes. Indeed, staff often find that a
confused, muddled resident will respond to careful, individual attention
and show unexpected lucidity in conversation.
Being part of the community is important too, and both nursing homes
are regularly visited by hairdressers, physiotherapists and
chiropodists. Religious needs are also catered for and the local
brownies, guides and other organisations take a lively interest in the
homes. No fewer than nine local GPs are involved in Greenbank and
Lornebank which means that residents from the Hamilton area can be
assured of continuity if the doctor needs to be called.
Both homes have recently been awarded the prestigious BS5750 quality
accreditation (now ISO 9002) which means an extra assurance of
standards. They are the only nursing homes in Lanarkshire to be awarded
this quality standard and as Director Tom Wilson points out, ''BS 5750
is a recognisable symbol that there is a quality service, which is very
important to many customers, including the Social Work Department.' The
company was unusual when it embarked on the stringent BS5750 path, in
being a new company with no ''system' as such, but they found the
exercise instrumental in formalising work practises and improving
efficiency, all of which is vital for residents and their relatives. But
staff morale was greatly boosted too, with even greater enthusiasm being
shown, as their efforts were recognised in a tangible way.
The company is privately owned, and while many residents may be
self-funded others qualify for financial assistance from Strathclyde
Regional Council. Greenbank Ltd. is in close contact with the Social
Work Department, so if you would like to find out how you or your
relative can secure a place, do call for information or an informal chat
on (01698) 427364. (Emergency beds are available as is respite care for
hard-pressed carers.)

THERE is little to stop transgenic farm plant material from crossing
over into the wild, scientists admitted yesterday.
Bumble bees and other natural pollinators could easily transmit
genetic material from improved crops to their feral equivalents,
according to a paper presented by Doctors A Gray and A Raybould of the
Institute of Terrestial Ecology.
This could affect a whole range of wild, or even domestic crops,
including carrots, lettuce, plums, apples, and even Scots pine and
poplar. It could also affect oilseed rape crops, which lend themselves
very easily to genetic manipulation or specific end uses.
There was some evidence to demonstrate this already occurred between
existing crop varieties and their wild relatives, such as wild cabbage
and lucerne, delegates to a Society of Chemical Industry conference in
London were told.
However, at another level, the genetic modification of virus based
insecticides offered some hope of replacing existing chemical pest
controls, according to Professor David Bishop of the Institute of
Virology and Environmental Biology at Oxford University.
Chemical controls were cheap, quick, and easy to apply, as well as
being profitable for manufacturers. On the down side, pests could
develop a resistance to them, residues could accumulate, and the
chemicals were not necessarily targets specific. This had led to public
fears for the environment.
Natural controls with baculoviruses tended to be targets specific, and
did not affect beneficial insects. So far, however, they were slow
acting, and depended on accurate timing. This could be improved by
genetic engineering of the virus, which was a relatively simple
operation.
Work at Oxford had so far been directed at introducing scorpion based
toxins into a caterpillar virus. This had reduced the kill period by up
to one-third, and increased the persistence up to six months. However,
disinfection of trial plots had effected a complete clearance of the
virus.
* MR George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, has
added his voice to those arguing the case for British Coal tenant
farmers to be allowed to bid for the farms they occupy.
Mr Foulkes has written to the President of the Board of Trade, Mr
Michael Heseltine, and to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, protesting at
British Coal's initial announcement that they wished to sell their farms
and surplus properties throughout Britain in ''packages'' to a small
number of buyers.
''Local tenant farmers have approached me to say that it is unfair and
unjust that sitting tenants who have improved the farms over the years
should not have the first opportunity to buy,'' said Mr Foulkes.
''This is also likely to bring in more revenue to British Coal, so
should be a better arrangement for everyone, except perhaps the property
developers.''
Since their initial announcement, British Coal have softened their
approach to some extent, and have conceded that they will enter into
negotiations with tenants who previously expressed an interest in
purchasing their land.
Mr Robert Nelson, who farms near Culross, Fife, said that it was not
yet clear how widely British Coal would interpret the requirement for an
earlier declaration to have been made of an interest in purchase.
''We are urging all tenant farmers to make sure now that their
interest has been registered with the landlord,'' he said. ''I think
their main thrust -- to sell in big packages -- is still there, but they
are prepared to deal with individual tenants.''

Detroit, Tuesday -- Chrysler profits were a record $3710m for 1994,
riding a strong market for its Jeeps, minivans, and trucks to the best
performance in its 69-year history.
Chrysler's earnings for the year reversed a $2550m loss in 1993, when
it took a massive $4970m accounting charge for retiree benefits.
''The company had an outstanding year in 1994 in just about every
respect,'' chairman Robert J Eaton said. ''We enjoyed record sales
worldwide and record earnings. We've fully funded our pension
obligations and still surpassed our targeted cash position of $7500m.''

ALEX Higgins is out of the Embassy World Championship. The two-times
former winner was beaten 10-5 in yesterday's sixth qualifying round in
Blackpool by Tai Pichit.
The controversial Irishman broke down in a flood of tears during the
eleventh frame after a dispute with referee John Williams, with whom he
has had more than one previous confrontation. Higgins, 7-3 down at that
point, had put together an excellent 103 break. He was setting up to pot
a simple black when he asked Williams, standing behind and to his left,
to move.
Williams stood his ground and Higgins, sobbing, eventually got down to
sink the black and then the six colours for a 137 total clearance --
amazingly his highest break in 23 years of the competing in the world
event.
Winners yesterday included Scots John Higgins, Marcus Campbell, and
Euan Henderson. Results included:
J Higgins (Sco) beat J Read (Eng) 10-5; M Campbell (Sco) beat M
Johnston-Allen (Eng) 10-7; E Henderson (Sco) beat F O'Brien (Ire) 10-5;
T Pichit (Thai) beat A Higgins (NIre) 10-5; J Johnson (Eng) beat M Couch
(Eng) 10-5.

THE recently-formed Perth-based charity, Start, whose objective is to
support disadvantaged young runners in Scotland, has now raised more
than #6000, and has begun to make awards. Six athletes, members of clubs
spread from Dundee to Lanarkshire, have already received grants which
will help them overcome personal difficulties which might have put them
out of the sport.
The trustees have a limited number of London Marathon entry forms for
people prepared to help the charity. Further information from Norman
Watson (0738 625640).
THE fund-starved Scottish Athletic Federation is looking for people
prepared to give hospitality in private homes to a dozen Belgian
athletes for three or four nights at the beginning of March. Scotland
has an under-20 and under-18 combined events international against
France, and Belgium has asked if they may also send a team. Scotland
would like to oblige, because there will be reciprocal opportunities for
Scots to go to Belgium. Anyone who can help should contact SAF (031 317

GLASGOW accountancy firm Pannell Kerr Forster has recruited a top
Scottish athlete to help them run the gauntlet they believe is ahead of
the profession.
With banks and management consultants making inroads into chartered
accountants' traditional fields, partners at the firm's Carlton Place
offices have linked up with outside specialists to establish three joint
venture companies which will help clients obtain finance, advise on
franchising and apply sport coaching techniques to help businesses
obtain results.
Glasgow University graduate and Olympic hopeful Melanie Neef, who
smashed the Scottish 200m indoor record at Glasgow's Kelvin Hall at the
weekend, is a part-time marketing assistant with Inside Out, which aims
to employ sports psychology to improve individual and team performance
in the commercial world.
The expertise of Alan Davies, Welsh national rugby football team
coach, has also been signed up.
Brothers John and David Sellyn are the respective key players in
Format F, which will help firms exploit the increasing growth
opportunities offered by franchising and provide related advice, and PLC
Business Expansion Advisers, which was formed from an existing company
with major Scottish corporate clients and will provide advice on grants,
other subsidised funds and soft loans.
Explaining the urgent need to diversify, Raymond Blin, managing
partner of PKF Glasgow, said: ''The profession is going to go through a
bit of a trauma in the next five years. We are under attack from a whole
number of people who have gone into our area, like banks and management
consultants.''
Faced with a loss of turnover in its traditional areas, the partners
in Glasgow, who are ahead of the firm nationally in the innovation
process, realised the need for action.
Ninety-nine of Britain's top 100 companies are audited by the big five
accountancy firms but Mr Blin believes the link with specialists who are
not accountants could attract other business from FTSE-100 members.
Melanie Neef's sporting activities are sponsored by Pannell Kerr
Forster and, although the accountancy firm's main aim is to get her to
the next Olympics, she will ultimately coach businessmen on becoming
winners.
With Mr Blin comparing water hazards on the golf course to obstacles
encountered in the commercial world, Ms Neef, a sports science graduate,
said: ''I am going to try to apply what helps me in sports psychology to
what could help people in the business world. I am sort of sympathetic
to their problems because I have gone through it from the sports point
of view.''

The second thoughts of Labour's would-be Devolution rebel prompt
U-turn reflections from John Linklater
ALTHOUGH the Longman Dictionary Of English Language And Culture
suggests that the U-turn is ''usually derogatory'', Margaret Thatcher
probably made turning respectable. If the lady wasn't for turning, then
turning couldn't be such a bad idea, a point which may encourage Tam
Dalyell.
The captain of the Titanic might have considered it. It was sheer
jingoism that would not permit Captain Scott to contemplate it. The
world prayed for Khrushchev to perform one during the 1962 Cuban missile
crisis, and he drove it to the brink before steering back round.
For such a municipal term (the U-turn was a Baltimore local
politician's coinage in 1937 when he was addressing the issue of traffic
in the town square) it has come a long way before doubling back to take
the meaning of a political reversal.
Thatcher gave the concept its particular notoriety in her speech on
government economic policy at the 1980 Tory conference. Responding to
media suggestions that she should moderate an economic policy that was
crippling the nation, she came on tough.
''To those waiting with bated breath for that favourite media
catchphrase, the U-turn, I have only one thing to say . . .'' Her phrase
was a speech-writer's pun on Christopher Fry's 1948 play The Lady Is Not
For Burning. Thatcher's final U-turn was in the second round of the Tory
leadership ballot. ''We fight on,'' she said, and she burned.
The political U-turn long predates the term, which is actually a
genuine neologism, first surfacing in the 1961 edition of Webster.
Brutus did a real U-turn on Julius Caesar, which is probably what the
old boy was muttering when he died. None of the assassins understood the
term, because chariots generally drove in permanent circles around the
Coliseum, and misreported it as: ''Et tu, Brute''.
Saul of Tarsus did a spectacular U-turn on the road to Damascus, a
feat he would find more difficult to repeat today, since I am reliably
informed there is no road that connects Jerusalem with Damascus, and
until the recent peace process the only way to hack it was by tank.
Tanks don't turn, so much as swivel.
Even at that, Hitler was not for swivelling at Stalingrad, until his
strategic U-turn was made as inevitable as it was disastrous. Napoleon
overturned that manoeuvre in 1815, and if history had taught either of
them not a damn thing, then they should have had the foresight to
observe Moscow taxis today.
It must have been political revulsion that outlawed the right-hand
turn on Moscow streets, and the accepted practice there is to overshoot
every intersection, pull a swift U-turn and hang a left. This is
violent, disorientating and a sort of post-Chechnya metaphor.
It is useful, then, to illustrate to Tam Dalyell that the U-turn need
not be a timorous action, indicating indecision or renaging on private
conviction. It can be executed with dramatic excitement. Watch Steve
McQueen throw around his black Mustang in Bullitt and the U-turn can
even be sexually attractive to women, no doubt long turned off by grim
dogmatism. Bad ideas, like Poll Tax, are never too late to U-turn-off.
Rock stars have long practised U-turns to gain attention. David Bowie
and Elton John swung their wheels both ways to turn heads. Cat Stevens
is a U-born-again Muslim. Bob Dylan invented the double U-turn, yes the
W-turn, plugging in around 1964, coming unplugged in recent albums,
doing his born-again Christian thing before returning as a re-born-again
Jew. Who said Jim McGuinn wrote the song Turn, Turn, Turn for the Byrds?
Every word was in the Bible. All of this was foreseen.
Scotland is, of course, the testing ground for the classic W-turn on
Devolution. Can it be at all surprising that, after posing it in 1979
when Labour opposed a devolved Scottish Assembly as proposed by the
Tories, that Tam has suddenly dropped the West Lothian question? When
John Major started repeating it, saying that Tam was right and the
Tories were wrong, there just had to be something intrinsically wrong
with it. That was the answer we have sought for so long.
The moral here, as George Bush pointed out on a famous U-turn
occasion, is never to consider or even attend the words, but ''Read my
lips''. What Bush was saying was ''No new taxes'', his infamous promise
to win the 1988 election. Even if he had mimed, his acceptance of the
1990 budget agreement, raising taxes and setting limits on government
spending, would have been a profound embarrassment.
Newspaper magnate Rupert Murdoch has lately said that he could imagine
U-turning to support Labour leader Tony Blair, and he was probably
saying ''Read my rags''.
All of this is lower-case stuff compared to the capital U-turner of
our times, possibly the greatest in history, and naturally he had to
come from the annals of Scottish football. Ever since Bonnie Prince
Charlie failed to get a result at Derby, and winged it back up the park,
our national sport was destined to produce the man who set out over two
months in 1989, to define the U-turn.
First he wore a Celtic jersey and told a May 12 press conference:
''There was only one place I wanted to go. I always wanted to play for
Celtic and still do.'' Then he wore a Rangers jersey and told another
press conference on July 10: ''The biggest in Europe. I'm just delighted
to be joining Rangers.''
He was a better player than Graeme Souness first thought, but first
thoughts are just a preliminary to a U-turn. If the West Lothian
question is an easier answer than Tam first thought, he now finds
himself in good company.

THE former world junior curling champion, James Dryburgh, has been
omitted from the draw for Scotland's premier event, the Macallan
Scottish Men's Championship, the winners of which will represent
Scotland at the World event scheduled for Brandon, Manitoba, in April.
Dryburgh lays the blame at the door of the sport's ruling body, the
Royal Caledonian Curling Club, who, he says, failed to include him in
the district stages of the draw. A total of 64 teams are scheduled for
the playdowns, which start a week on Friday at four venues: Ayr,
Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Perth.
The closing date for entries was October 31 last year, but Dryburgh
learned of the problem with his entry only last week. Another less
well-known team, skipped by Len Gow, is similarly affected.
RCCC president Inglis McAulay referred the matter to competitions'
convener Alex Torrance. He admits the entries arrived on time, but
insists they are invalid because incorrect procedures were followed.
''It clearly states that entries must be returned to the nominated
local ice rink,'' said Torrance. ''Dryburgh's was not at Dumfries -- he
nominated them as his rink, but they didn't even know he'd entered.
Every other entry came through a rink.''
Dryburgh, an Edinburgh student, handed his entry personally to the
Royal Club's office in the capital the week before the deadline. ''They
accepted it,'' he says. ''If my entry was invalid by handing it to them,
why did they not tell me?''
His rink, with Ross Barnett, Paul Martin, and Allan Lawrie, is
favourite for this year's Scottish junior title.
Torrance, four-time Scottish champion in the 1960s and '70s, is
unfortunate to find himself at the centre of controversy. The Hamilton
farmer has devoted much unpaid time to the game over the years.
As junior vice-president he is scheduled to become president in two
seasons' time, but he threatened to resign if The Herald published this
story. That would be unfortunate, but as competitions convener, he is
the man in the firing line when mistakes are made.
Gow's entry was faxed to the Royal Club on November 3, during the
seven-day period when ice rinks must convey entries to the RCCC, after
the official closing date.
Torrance declined to re-draw the event, adding that Gow's club, in
Paisley, told him they had no entries: ''When Gow's did arrive, we were
packing to move headquarters to Ingliston, and it was mislaid.''
The Royal Club spent more than #45,000 on administrative salaries last
year. As one past president said yesterday: ''The Royal Club exists to
help curlers and are employed by us to do the job properly.''

<HEADLINE>US output surges 1% to post strongest gain since 1992</HEADLINE>

Washington, Tuesday -- Production at US factories and mines surged
ahead strongly in December, the Federal Reserve said today, as
businesses ran at their busiest rate in more than 15 years.
Total industrial output increased 1%, the strongest monthly gain since
an identical rise in November 1992. The capacity use rate hit 85.4% --
the highest operating rate since October 1979 as factories struggled to
churn out products for consumers and business customers.
The rates were higher than expected. Economists had forecast a 0.6%
rise in factory output and an 85.1% reading on capacity use.
''It suggests the manufacturing sector of the economy is quite
strong,'' said Kathleen Camilli, chief economist at MFR Inc. She added
that the data indicate that the economy probably grew ''in excess of
4%'' in the fourth quarter of 1994.
The Fed said the increase in December industrial production was
widespread with significant gains in mining and in production of both
expensive durable goods and non-durables. But unseasonably mild weather
depressed production at electric and gas utilities last month.
The inflation-sensitive US Treasury market initially skidded on the
report but then recovered, with the benchmark 30-year bond off an
eighth, or $1.25 per $1000 face value, to yield 7.80%, compared with
7.79% on Friday. The market was closed yesterday for the Martin Luther
King holiday.
''I haven't seen this kind of move up in capacity utilisation for a
long time,'' said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment
Advisers Corporation. ''Growth was widespread and the drop in utilities
makes the number even stronger.''
The latest industrial output figures underline the economy's strength
at the end of 1994. The Fed said production accelerated to an annual
rate of 5.4% in the final quarter last year from 4.9% in the third
quarter.
For all of 1994, industrial production grew 5.4% -- the strongest pace
in a decade, since 9.3% growth in 1984. By contrast, production was up
4.1% in 1993 and 3.2% in 1992.
The capacity use figures may raise a red flag for the Fed's
policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which is scheduled to meet
at the end of this month. The central bank is trying to curb inflation
pressures and the strong capacity use rate may raise concern about
potential production bottlenecks.
The central bank raised short-term interest rates six times in 1994 to
try to slow the economy's rate of growth to about 2.5% -- a rate it
considers can be sustained without fuelling inflationary price rises. --
Reuter.

THERE is something vaguely satirical about establishing a committee
composed entirely of captains of industry, who are charged with drawing
up a ''code of practice on executive pay'' -- in other words, the going
rate for captains of industry.
The group is chaired by Sir Richard Greenbury (Marks and Spencer,
#799,188 last year) who will be assisted in his labours by Sir Michael
Angus (Whitbread, #154,170); Sir Denys Henderson (ICI and Zeneca,
#704,000) and David Simon (BP, #615,000).
Even though the average is dragged down by Sir Michael's modest
remuneration as a non-executive chairman, it works out healthily in
excess of half-a-million a head. This is indeed a lofty peak from which
to study morality and best practice.
If these four wise men unite around the conclusion that they are
themselves grossly overpaid, then it will be one of the century's great
surprising outcomes. It seems more likely that they will set up a
hardship fund on finding any boardroom buddy with less than a six-figure
salary.
But at least the CBI has felt moved to make some gesture in the
direction of public opinion. Not so Her Majesty's Government in general,
or Michael Heseltine in particular, despite the fact that the privatised
utilities represent the greatest growth area in greed.
The sub-text to the setting-up of this absurd committee is that the
Tories will not touch the issue with a barge pole. At a time when they
are desperate for donations from the beneficiaries of boardroom excess,
they are certainly not in the business of curtailing it.
Headline salary figures, such as Sir Richard Greenbury's #799,188,
tell only half the story. If he had been paid that cash figure in 1979,
his take-home pay would have been #154,750. He will need a much larger
M&amp;S carrier bag now -- last year the equivalent post-tax sum was
#470,597.
This trebling of real income does not result from boardroom decisions,
but from taxation policies. The truth is that while occasionally seeking
to distance themselves from exorbitant salaries, the Tories have been
responsible for easily the biggest factor in creating them -- the cut in
top tax rates.
The offence is compounded by what has been going on at the other end
of the scale, with all responsibility for decent minimum wages having
been abandoned. There is not even the fig-leaf of a CBI committee to
examine that real scandal. The poor can set up their own committees,
since they don't vote Tory anyway. There is no political embarrassment.
One of the lofty retorts when boardrom pay raises its head is that it
affects a very small number of people. Taxing them or controlling their
salaries would not make any significant difference to anyone else, and
so even to talk about it represents only ''the politics of envy''.
If that were true, it would be a good case for pursuing the politics
of envy. But it isn't true. The greed culture at the top of British
industry and government affects attitudes and morale far beyond the
boardrooms. For evidence of this, one need look no further than British
Gas.
When in the public sector, and from top management downwards, British
Gas characterised a very strong public service ethos. Some of this
carried over into the privatised company. After all, very few of the
people who worked in it had asked to be privatised. Why should their
attitudes change overnight?
Doubtless change for the worse, directed towards the maximisation of
profit, has been working away under the surface for some time. But it is
only in recent weeks, triggered by the #525,000 pay award to its chief
execuive, that the image of the company -- and morale within it -- have
been dragged through the gutter of public contempt.
Why should anyone go the extra mile, when low wages are being cut,
sensible investment slashed, dividends increased at three or four times
the Stock Market average and top pay inflated to grotesque levels? How
does that package fit with such concepts as public service and pride in
the job?
The other characteristic of our captains of industry is their ability
to do at least half a dozen jobs at any one time. A glance at the Who's
Who entries of the CBI committee produces an awesome list of
non-executive directorships, some of them criss-crossing with the other
members and all of them topping up basic earnings.
Sir Richard Greenbury also finds time to be a non-exec at Lloyd's
Bank, ICI and Zeneca. Sir Michael Angus is deputy chairman of British
Airways and the NatWest Bank. David Simon pops up in the Grand
Metropolitan boardroom, while Sir Denys Henderson is big in Barclay's
and RTZ.
The past 15 years have been used to promote and foster gross wealth
for those who are in a position to obtain it. Much of it has come
through the scandalously cheap disposal of public assets; much more
through the taxation structure. It is too late for bogus committees, at
arms-length from government, to draw the sting from that charge.
One day quite soon those who were never offered access to the trough,
or who were deemed surplus to requirements by those who presided over
it, will have their say.

THESE are crucial days for First Choice Holidays and the rest of the
holiday trade. The industry is hoping for both a reasonable, say 5%,
improvement in bookings and maintained prices.
First Choice's chief executive, Francis Baron, has seen no weakening
yet on the pricing front.
The former Owners Abroad appears to be doing the right thing by
selling its holidays through High Street retailers as well as through
competitors such as Airtours' Going Places and the Thomson subsidiary
Lunn Poly.
While First Choice and Airtours have increased their cumulative market
share for summer 1995 from 9.1% to 11.1% respectively and from 18.7% to
22.3%, Thomson has seen a decline in its share from 42.3% to 37.5%.
Since Mr Baron arrived at the company in 1993, the emphasis has been
on rebranding and cost elimination.
The effect in the year to October was to boost turnover by 16% to
#822m and pre-tax profits by 51% to #23.3m before restructuring costs of
#7m. After deducting these costs there is still strong recovery from
#3.4m to #16.3m.

Tokyo, Tuesday -- Business activity in central Japan was severely
disrupted by the earthquake which struck this morning, but later in the
day a few companies resumed production at factories in the region.
The powerful quake killed many people and badly damaged communication
lines, power cables, railways and highways.
Japan's second-largest bourse, the Osaka Securities Exchange,
suspended most trading and some financial institutions and manufacturers
halted operations. A Tokyo Stock Exchange official said later that the
Osaka bourse would resume full trading tomorrow.
The long-term economic impact of the earthquake was likely to be
relatively slight, however, and might eventually provide a small boost
for the economy because of the stimulus of reconstruction.
''You're talking some tenths of a percent of Gross Domestic Product
that will have to be spent to rebuild, maybe over a couple of years,''
said Peter Morgan, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Japan. ''There will
be some disruption of production facilities, but it is positive for GDP
because you get extra spending.''
Yoshihisa Kitai, senior economist at LTCB Research Institute, said the
impact might snip 0.4% off Gross National Product in the January-March
quarter, but added that the positive impact of spending on
reconstruction could emerge in six to 12 months.
Spending on reconstruction could end up totalling around one trillion
yen (#6.8bn) and that the damage might be worth around 1% of GNP.
''There is loss in terms of assets but at present production activity
is not at full capacity so the damage can be covered sufficiently by
other facilities,'' he said.
Tokyo share prices ended lower, suppressed by small-lot selling as the
earthquake kept most investors away. The 225-share Nikkei average share
finished 89.85 points down at 19,241.32.
Share prices of insurance companies fell in Tokyo on fears they would
be liable for damage claims, while the dollar rose against the yen to
around Y99.27 on worries the earthquake might affect the Japanese
economy. Some construction firms' share prices rose as market players
speculated they would benefit from rebuilding.
In heavy trade, shares in Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance slumped Y40 to
Y1100, and Mitsui Marine &amp; Fire Insurance dropped Y37 to Y678.
Non-life insurers said, however, that the disaster would not cause a
financial crisis. ''There will be no major impact on our business,''
said a spokesman at Mitsui Marine, Japan's third-largest non-life
insurer.
Japanese government bond prices closed sharply lower on worries that
extra bonds might be issued to fund government emergency aid for the
stricken region and four commodity exchanges in western Japan cancelled
trading.
Terminals at the Port of Kobe, a central Japan hub for container
shipping, were inoperable, and shipping lines were considering diverting
their container ships to other ports in Japan to unload cargo, mostly
from North America and Europe.
Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura said his ministry would do its
utmost in extending emergency aid to the region. ''As for securing
financing for the aid we want to do our utmost because this is an
emergency,'' he said.
The ministry and the Bank of Japan jointly announced a set of
emergency financial measures to be taken by financial institutions and
life insurers for the victims of the latest earthquakes, including
corporations.
Economists and government officials said it was too early to assess
the scale of the damage. But based on estimates of the damage in central
Japan, the construction and transport ministries will use their annual
budgets and reserves in national coffers to help repair damaged roads,
bridges and other infrastructure.
By this afternoon, Sanyo Electric and Sharp said they had resumed
operations at their electrical plants in central Japan after
establishing that there was no major damage from the huge tremor. NEC
said its semiconductor plant in the area would resume operations
shortly.
Major computer-maker Fujitsu said earlier it had temporarily shut its
display and peripheral plant in Akashi near Kobe as the earthquake had
damaged one building.
Mitsubishi Electric suspended operations at five plants in central
Japan. ''Water is gushing out in the compound in the Kobe plant, while
sewage pipes have been damaged in the Itami plant,'' a spokesman said.
Kobe Steel stopped all operations at its two major steelworks and
automaker Daihatsu Motor halted production at two plants in western
Japan.
Brokerage Nomura Securities said the earthquake wreaked havoc in its
two offices in Kobe. ''There's a power cut, the computer's down and the
internal telephone netwoek is also not working,'' a Nomura spokemsman
said.
At least two oil refineries and several oil-processing units,
including those of Cosmo Oil and General Sekiyu, were shut down, but few
were reported damaged.
About 450 bank branches were closed but efforts were being made to
reopen tomorrow. -- Reuter.

WM LOW stores traded strongly in the run-up to Christmas, their new
owner, Tesco, said yesterday as it announced a 15.6% jump in group sales
(excluding Low) in December.
The #250m takeover of Low was completed on September 2 and Tesco only
had time to change 15 fascias and make some cosmetic in-store changes to
the 60 Low outlets before the Christmas rush began.
But the Tesco range of own-label products had been introduced and a
Tesco spokesman said the Tesco Value lines, a range of 130
value-for-money products, had gone down well with Low shoppers.
''We are very pleased with the performance of the Low stores,'' said
Tesco chairman Sir Ian MacLaurin.
The rest of the fascias will be changed by the end of February. Then
later this year a two-year programme of refurbishment will begin to give
the stores the full Tesco treatment, including new check-outs.
For the group as a whole, like-for-like sales in December were 7%
ahead, with fruit and vegetables going particularly well, as did music
and videos from the group's Leisureworld range of products.
However, October and November were dull so that sales for the 20 weeks
to December were 3.8% up on like-for-like basis. Tesco shares were
unaffected, easing 1[1/2]p to 241[1/2]p.

THE Governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, commented in his
speech to bankers in Glasgow on Monday night that base rate increases
imposed in September and December last year were necessary to counter
inflationary pressures from rising commodity prices along with emerging
capacity constraints in some basic material sectors.
These price increases have started to work their way through to
producer prices at the factory gate though not to retail prices, at
least not yet. There is still considerable resistance to price rises in
the High Street in the present highly-competitive climate. And this is
confirmed by the first national survey of business expectations carried
out since Christmas.
Business information service group Dun &amp; Bradstreet says that while
many firms are feeling more confident about passing on price increases
on the back of business optimism about the sales outlook, this is more
evident among manufacturing industries and wholesalers.
The survey indicates retailers remain reluctant to pass price
increases fully on to consumers. It suggests that price increases will
not fully feed through to the Consumer Price Index during the first
quarter of 1995.
The proportion of manufacturers planning to raise prices in the first
quarter of the year, minus the proportion expecting to decrease them,
was 45% compared with 28% in the final quarter of last year. Wholesalers
registered a corresponding rise from 34% to 49%. But for retailers the
increase was far more restrained at 33% against 30% though this has to
be tempered by a rise from 17% to 29% in the percentage of the service
sector planning price increases.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet's survey, which covered 1800 managing and financial
directors, found that overall confidence among business leaders remained
high with nearly eight out of 10 (79%) of companies expecting to
increase sales during the first quarter of 1995. Profit expectation
indices have risen by six points from the last quarter and now 73% of
firms expect to increase profits over the next few months.
There has been a significant upward trend in retailers' confidence but
it is still running at well below the national average. And while about
seven out of 10 companies expect increases in the number of their new
orders -- a slight drop since the last quarter -- there is some concern
as to whether this high number will continue through 1995. Scottish
firms are shown to be much less confident than the rest of Britain about
increases in new orders.
Retailers had a tough time in October and November and while there
looks to have been a pick-up in December, according to the CBI December
Distributive Trades Survey, it remains to be seen whether this will be
the case for January.
The official December retail sales figures are due tomorrow and
despite the CBI evidence most analysts are sticking to a month-on-month
rise of 0.3% since the CBI survey missed the first two weeks of December
which were thought to be pretty weak. There are also doubts about the
December figure because of the tricky seasonal adjustments that have to
be made.
Securities house Goldman Sachs has collated Christmas trading
statements from major retailers including Argos, Body Shop, Boots,
Dixons, John Lewis, Sears and Storehouse. It reckons that while it is
difficult to generalise, the overall impression is that in recent weeks
the retailers achieved annual like-for-like sales growth of 4%-5%. With
inflation in the retail sector running at only around 1%, this would
translate into volume growth of 3%-4%. The John Lewis weekly sales
figures have shown a similar pattern with no sign of any deceleration in
the first week in January.
However, Goldman Sachs' economists make the point that at this stage
it is still too early to get a clear picture of developments in consumer
spending around Christmas. Tomorrow's official retail sales figures for
December will not give a complete picture and the authorities will have
to wait until the outcome for January which is published two weeks after
the monthly monetary meeting between the Chancellor and the Governor of
the Bank of England on February 2.
Mr George, in his speech, said that there was a misconception that the
UK economy was sluggish and stressed that it was important not to
exaggerate the weakness of consumer spending which, on the latest data,
is nevertheless growing at its trend rate.
The December, and more significantly, the January retail sales figures
should provide a pointer to the consumer mood early in 1995 and the
possible impact on this of any further hike in interest rates that may
be in prospect.
Yesterday the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, Mr Rupert
Pennant-Rea, echoed Mr George when he told the Chartered Institute of
Banking that it was not clear yet whether higher interest rates would be
needed to slow down the economy.
Perhaps the economy will slow down itself, perhaps it will need to be
slowed by higher interest rates. But he said that one factor which
helped inflation fall -- price discounting by supermarkets and other
retailers due to competition -- may be coming to an end.

<HEADLINE>New contract worth #4m a year Scottish TV and Unilever end row over advertising</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Television and Unilever have patched up the dispute which
left the TV company's biggest advertising client off the screens for a
full year.
Scotland's most popular channel said yesterday that advertising by the
detergents and food products giant had started at the beginning of the
year. Scottish has secured a three-year contract from Unilever worth
roughly #4m a year depending upon the level of new product launches.
Last October, managing director Gus Macdonald warned that 1994 profits
would drop from #13.1m to around #9m as a result of a drop in
advertising revenue including Unilever.
Other setbacks included Wm Low being off-screen after being taken over
by Tesco and reduced milk promotion. That caused shares to drop on the
day by 44p to 430p -- yesterday they rose 19p to 445p.
Mirror Group's Scottish Daily Record subsidiary, at the direction of
group chief executive David Montgomery, bought 19.99% of Scottish in two
tranches in September and October at 520p, but is losing #7.2m on its
#50m investment despite yesterday's rise in the share price.
The shares were bought in expectation of relaxation of the rules for
cross-ownership in the media.
The Unilever problem arose because of the demand for increased
discounts from Scottish and Granada TV. Granada, based in the north of
England, along with Scottish Television jointly owned the Time Exchange
sales organisation.
Mr Macdonald said: ''The new arrangements are on terms which meet the
needs of both parties. The three-year deal with our biggest advertiser
also provides us with an anchor for our revenue until the end of 1997.''
When Granada acquired the London station LWT at the beginning of last
year, it brought in the Laser sales organisation. Laser and Time
Exchange had a combined total 29% of national UK advertising sales. That
compared with the permitted limit of 25%.
Scottish, with about 5% market share, was forced to find another
agency, TSMS which is part of the MAI stable. Grampian Television in
Aberdeen was in the same position as Scottish. That led to disruption in
advertising sales for a considerable part of 1994 for planned spots,
short-term, and one-off spots.
There were also problems associated with moving to different computer
systems. Together they resulted in a #2.2m drop in revenue in the first
six months.
The combined effect of the Unilever withdrawal and the change in the
sales organisation resulted in a fall in national advertising revenue
share from 5.2% to 4.9%.
However, that should improve not only because of the resumption of
Unilever revenue but also increased viewing share in Central Scotland.
Since the end of September, Scottish has seen an improvement from 40.2%
to 42%.
All other major advertisers have renewed their contracts.

concerned that Prime Minister-designate Lamberto Dini's newly-named
government will not be able to gain enough support in Parliament.
One ex-minister was quoted as saying that the Berlusconi-led Freedom
Alliance would not back the new administration.
In contrast, the Spanish peseta was stable after its recent turmoil.
The Spanish economy minister said that his country has no intention of
altering economic policy because of any fluctuations in the exchange
rate. The Mexican new peso was boosted by strong demand for Mexican
bonds in the weekly auction.
The dollar and sterling traded quietly yesterday with attention
elsewhere. The receeding prospects of another increase in UK interest
rates continues to prompt sterling investors to look elsewhere.
Rumours that the Bank of Spain had sold sterling caused the pound to
dip in earlier trading.
It closed slightly lower against the German mark and dollar at
DM2.3993 and $1.5672 respectively. Its trade-weighted index remained at
79.3.

SAATCHI &amp; Saatchi fired a broadside against its ex-chairman Maurice
Saatchi as it issued a statement to settle nerves among anxious
shareholders.
The group said it ''deprecates most strongly the campaign against the
company, its clients and staff being pursued by Mr Saatchi and his
colleagues''.
A spokesman ridiculed a report that Charles Saatchi had proposed that
his brother be reinstated to run the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising
worldwide network which would then be demerged. Some shareholders are
believed to support the idea as a way to defuse the row but it is
clearly a non-starter.
''It's a totally unthinkable suggestion. It's quite preposterous in
the light of the last four weeks. It's completely unacceptable both to
staff and shareholders alike,'' the spokesman said.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi intends to publish its 1994 results on March 14,
with the usual statement on current trading. Directors say they have
reviewed the commercial and financial situation of the group in the
light of recent events and see no reason for an additional statement to
be made before then. This suggests that there has not been any major
financial impact arising from Maurice Saatchi's departure.
Charlie Scott, chief executive and acting chairman, said: ''The group
has thousands of clients who are served by 11,000 staff worldwide, often
with extraordinary talent and dedication. We have a clear commercial
strategy for growing the group for the benefit of all its clients, staff
and shareholders, and we will not be deflected from achieving that''.
An extraordinary shareholders' meeting will be called on March 16 to
propose a new name for the holding company and to consider a new
group-wide executive share option scheme designed to conform fully to
institutional guidelines. The group has brought in a corporate identity
consultant to draw up a short list of possible names by the end of the
month from which one will be selected.
Yesterday, Maurice Saatchi slapped in a writ against his former
employer for alleged breach of contract. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi already has
served writs on Maurice and the three top executives who have defected,
alleging they conspired to injure the group's business.
The group has set up an inner committee, comprising Mr Scott, acting
chief operating officer Wendy Smith and non-executive directors Clive
Gibson and Sir Peter Walters to handle specific issues arising from the
split with Maurice Saatchi. A nominations committee under Sir Peter has
been established to find a new chairman.

CHIEF Secretary to the Treasury Jonathan Aitken last night hailed
Britain's economic recovery and accused Labour of ''schizophrenic splits
and silences'' over its own economic policy.
Opening second reading debate on the Finance Bill, which enacts the
November Budget, he told the Commons the measures would ''strengthen the
excellent economic performance'' and encourage enterprise.
As for Labour, Mr Aitken told MPs: ''Up until now, the Treasury team
opposite have performed a passable imitation of four Trappist monks in a
Harold Pinter play.
''Whenever they are asked fundamental questions on vital economic
policy issues, all we get is uncomfortable Pinteresque silences that are
even getting noticed and written up by the critics.''
He added: ''These schizophrenic splits and silences within the
Opposition are rightly going to come under intense scrutiny during this
Finance Bill.''
For the Opposition, Mr Andrew Smith said the Bill was ''something of a
shambles'' which would have to be amended to take account of the
Government's defeat over higher VAT on fuel.
The measure highlighted Ministers' record of ''broken promises and
incompetence'', he said.

ENGLAND has nothing to fear from a Scottish parliament, but has
everything to fear from a Tory Party which is endangering the Union by
refusing to consider constitutional change, Shadow Scottish Secretary
George Robertson claimed last night.
In the latest Labour reply to the Prime Minister's new year campaign
against devolution, Mr Robertson said: ''The Tories are threatening the
Union and endangering the British constitution by obstinately refusing
to consider any form of constitutional change.''
He told an audience at St John's College in Portsmouth: ''A Scottish
parliament will not cost England a penny more. And any proposals for
regional goernment in England will be based on popular consent.''
Labour has promised to deliver comprehensive reforms, including a
Scottish parliament and a Welsh assembly, in its first year in power. In
England Labour wants to introduce regional assemblies, but has yet to
define its proposals.
On Monday night, Labour was under attack from within when the veteran
anti-devolutionist Tam Dalyell raised again the West Lothian question in
a speech in Leicestershire. Last night Mr Robertson dismissed Mr
Dalyell's fears.
''The West Lothian question is a red herring designed to deflect
attention from the overwhelming desire for change in Scotland,'' he
said. The problem posed by Scottish MPs voting at Westminster on English
matters when English MPs would be prevented from doing the same on
Scottish affairs by a Scottish parliament would be solved by assemblies
for England.
''Any anomaly thrown up by the West Lothian question will diminish in
importance over time by the development of the form of elected regional
democracy in England most desired and best suited to deal with that
unelected tier which is already there.''
He repeated Labour's criticisms of the Government's system of quangos:
''Across the country the government is seen as having taken power from
the people, having rested it in unelected quangos, faceless civil
servants, and in the hands of hopelessly overburdened ministers who
rotate departments like a Catherine wheel. No wonder people are
disaffected, and not just in Scotland.''
He accused Mr Major for trying to fuel animosity between England and
Scotland. ''John Major plays with fire as he cranks up a campaign
specifically targeted on stimulating animosity between Scotland and
England. Make no mistake -- that is what this exercise is all about and
it is profoundly depressing that the Prime Minister, of all people,
should stoop so low.''
The Union always had been adaptable, he said. ''Countless Conservative
administrations have recognised the special nature of Scotland.''

THE Liberal Democrat response to the raising of the devolution issue
by the Prime Minister was to present yesterday a Bill which would set up
''a Scots Parliament''.
Its sponsor, Mr Menzies Campbell (North-East Fife) was at once
assailed by SNP leader Alex Salmond who said the Liberals had achieved
''precisely nothing'' despite their much vaunted 100 year commitment to
home rule.
The Liberal Democrats, unlike many who publish the terms of a Bill
they wish to promote, actually produced an eight-clause Bill with
lengthy schedules which outline the powers a home rule Parliament would
have.
Mr Campbell said: ''If this Bill was enacted, the legitimate
aspirations of the people of Scotland for home rule within the United
Kingdom supported time after time by opinion polls would be achieved.
''Constitutional reform has been placed at the top of the political
agenda by Mr Major and this Bill is the answer to that challenge.''
Mr Salmond said: ''If constitutional change were left up to the
Liberals, our great-grandchildren would no doubt be lamenting 200 years
of achievement in 2095.
''There have been 36 previous Bills in the House of Commons to set up
a legislature for Scotland. Each one, no matter how far it got at
Westminster has produced the same result -- nothing -- for Scotland.''
He said the lesson should not be clear. Scottish self-government when
presented by Unionist parties would always be stifled at
Westminster.''Westminster takes notice only when Scotland votes SNP.''
Mr Campbell rsponded: ''This rather pathetic response shows once and
for all that the SNP regard themselves as the 'exclusive brethren' of
Scottish politics.
''It seems Mr Salmond and his colleagues dislike other Opposition
parties more than they oppose the present constitutional arrangement in
the United Kingdom.''
The Bill would give the Scots Parliament legislative powers in all
matters apart from foreign affairs, defence and overall economic policy.
It could vary UK income tax up or down by 3p and would also create a
charter of rights and freedoms.

GERRY Anderson is quitting Radio 4's afternoon show Anderson Country
''by mutual agreement'', the BBC said last night.
He leaves the phone-in programme, one of the most savagely attacked
shows in Radio 4's history, at the end of his year-long contract next
month.
It will change its name to The Afternoon Shift and be presented on
different days by Daire Brehan and Laurie Taylor.
Radio 4's controller, Michael Green, said: ''This has been an
important innovation for Radio 4 and despite the hostility of some
listeners, the audience remained absolutely steady.''
Radio 4 listeners are notoriously resistant to change but hostile
reaction to the programme was unprecedented. It provoked a wave of
protest and criticism, including claims that it operated like a local
radio show.
Mr Green added: ''This past year has shown us that presenting this
kind of programme five days a week is too heavy a burden for any one
person. We have learned a great deal from Anderson Country and are
extremely grateful to Gerry for all he has done to get it off the
ground.''
He claimed there was an appetite for such new kinds of magazine
programme and he would continue to develop them. He hoped Anderson, who
joined the station from BBC Radio Ulster, would continue to contribute
to Radio 4.
The show, which started broadcasting on February 21 last year, had
about 340,000 listeners. However, its critics were legion -- a
''deluge'' of letters attacking it were sent to Feedback, the radio
reaction slot.
Shortly after its introduction, Mr Green admitted listeners had found
Anderson Country ''disorienting''.
Anderson, 48, also presents Anderson On The Box for BBC Northern
Ireland.
The former musician, teacher, and social worker has also presented a
popular series of talks for Radio 4, Surviving Stroke City, about life
in Derry.

FOLLOWING chart success for the reprise of the Tam Dalyell hit from
the seventies, The West Lothian Question, another golden oldie was
released yesterday on the SNP label -- a remix of the old Gordon Wilson
classic, It's Scotland Oil.
Adding to the prevailing mood of political deja vu, the party raised
the issue of oil revenues as part of SNP leader Alex Salmond's twenty
questions on devolution to Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson.
One of these contained in his original letter was: ''Would the
Assembly have an assigned share of oil and gas revenues from Scottish
waters in the North Sea, or do Labour still propose that all of the
revenues would continue to go straight to Westminster?''
The reply was succinct: ''The Scottish Parliament will not have an
assigned share of oil and gas revenues.''
This was seized on by SNP Energy spokesman John Swinney, who said:
''Who ever heard of a nation asking its neighbour for permission to run
some of its own affairs and then paying that neighbour for the
privilege? Would Norway hand over control of its oil revenues to Sweden?
That is what Labour is proposing for Scotland.''
With new oil and gas fields being developed all the time, he said this
strategic resource should form the basis of future investment instead of
continuing to be ''poured down the economic drain of the South-east of
England.''

SCOTTISH Office Minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie came under fire
yesterday over a reception for GP fundholders at Edinburgh Castle last
year which cost the taxpayer almost #1100.
The issue was raised at Question Time in the Lords by Labour peer Lord
Bruce of Donington, who questioned why the reception -- on November 25
-- had been held.
Lord Bruce demanded that the Minister ''explain why it is, at this
time of increasing stringency on Government expenditure, it was decided
to give this form of entertainment to a restricted class of doctors''.
Lord Fraser said that Edinburgh Castle regularly was used for
receptions for all types of groups. On this occasion, the Government was
thanking GP fund-holders for the ''significant effort they were making
towards achieving a patient-centred health service'' and to make an
announcement about changes to the fund-holding scheme.
About 70 people had attended and, since the reception, 80 further
inquiries had been received about the scheme.
Lord Fraser told the House that there were 107 GP fundholders in
Scotland, covering 20% of the population. It was anticipated that
something like 30% of the population would be covered during 1995-96,
and Lord Fraser said: ''I believe fundholders have made improvements in
health care in Scotland.''
Former Scottish Office Minister Lord (Harry) Ewing (Lab.) demanded:
''What way is this to treat the GP service in Scotland, that 70 are told
that if they join fund-holding schemes they will get a reception at
Edinburgh Castle and a lollipop from the Minister?
He urged Lord Fraser to make it clear that the work of all GPs in
Scotland was appreciated and that the Government was not ''trying to
drive a wedge between GP fundholders and non-fundholders.'' The Minister
replied: ''I am happy to give that assurance.''

Strathclyde region's transportation committee recently accepted the
Glasgow CrossRail proposals from Strathclyde Passenger Transport
Executive, finally linking the city's north and south-side rail
networks. This will allow trains to travel between (for example) Airdrie
or Helensburgh to Paisley or East Kilbride, and long-distance expresses
from Edinburgh or Stirling could continue through to Ayr and Kilmarnock,
and also to Glasgow Airport once the airport spur is built.
Although there is much public support for the scheme the region has
accepted poor locations for intermediate stations, missing out on the
chance to provide useful interchanges to serve the needs of passengers.
Stations are planned at West Street, the Gorbals, Saltmarket, and moving
High Street station into the wastelands of the former railway goods yard
to the east.
This may be a wasted opportunity given the importance of the link for
cross-Scotland trains and the architectural merit of a high quality
station at Glasgow Cross itself (in the UK City of Architecture and
Design 1999) rather than the (metaphorically, at least) ''two platforms
plus bus shelters'' seemingly to be built, which is isolated and will
not attract new rail passengers or serve built-up areas.
At Glasgow Cross the new line passes over the Argyle line, potentially
making an ideal interchange for trains to Hamilton and Lanark and
bringing workers and shoppers to Gallowgate and the Barrowlands, thereby
revitalising the surrounding area. The low-level station chamber under
Trongate still exists, extending almost underneath the high-level
tracks.
Unfortunately the planned station to the south-west of Saltmarket
(grudgingly moved due to public pressure from ''Bridgegate'') is far
from main shopping and business areas and cannot provide this essential
interchange.
Instead, Strathclyde intends spending up to #5m building a travelator
walkway to Argyle Street station, several hundred metres away. The costs
of this link could instead cover building a high-level station at
Glasgow Cross, and contribute to reopening the low-level station and
transforming the Mercat Building into a high-profile station entrance in
time for the 21st century.
SPTE admits that a station at this site is feasible, and did in fact
produce an alternative ''Saltmarket North'' plan where the station would
meet the south side of London Road.
SPTE's proposals also move High Street station east into the goods
yard to a new site which would be extremely remote, unattractive to
passengers, and possibly dangerous at night. Instead, the platforms of
the existing station should be extended to the west under High Street,
allowing integration with the Merchant City and providing the
Strathclyde University with a convenient station for rail transfer to
its Jordanhill campus.
We are supported in our aims by many local MPs, district councillors,
businesses, and community and environment organisations, and over 4000
residents and business people have signed a petition calling for the
CrossRail proposals to include stations at our preferred locations.

I doubt if the good people of Rutherglen, south-east Glasgow, and
adjacent areas of Lanarkshire, already deprived of inpatient ophthalmic
and urological services at the Victoria Infirmary, will view the closure
of Rutherglen Maternity Hospital with the self-congratulatory attitude
as the planners at Greater Glasgow Health Board.
The sufferers from cataracts and prostatic problems, mainly the
elderly, will be joined in the long trek across Glasgow to the Southern
General Hospital by young mothers with domestic and family commitments,
being admitted for maternity care, and by harassed young fathers trying
to visit.
It's bad enough for me, and I don't have to rely on public transport.
Perhaps, however, the hidden agenda is for confinements to join the
trend of ''day care for everything'' or for a return to more home
deliveries.
The public has been so conditioned into accepting as inevitable
changes imposed from central authority that it has forgotten how to
protest to kicks in the teeth. Except, I hope, in Glasgow.

From his perch in Kilmacolm David Spaven criticises at length the case
for the M77 extension (January 12).
I wonder if he was as vociferous in decrying the need for the
upgrading of the A737 from Linwood South westwards a year or three ago
from which he and other commuters benefited.
I suspect not, and neither would I if I were in his shoes.
The A737 improvement succeeded in its intention, which was to ease the
traffic congestion in Elderslie, Johnstone, Howwood, and indirectly also
Linwood, and in so doing improve the lifestyle and environment of many
people.
The fact that it also trimmed a few minutes off the average commuting
time for residents of Kilmacolm, Bridge of Weir, and Brookfield was
incidental.
The benefits of the M77 extension will be similar but will be
applicable to a vastly greater population and, I guesstimate, will have
a lower cost/benefit ratio than the A737 improvements.
I suggest David Spaven reviews his criticism in that light, especially
as he does not live day and daily with the effects of the traffic
pollution on the South Side.

One of the most depressing features of Scottish politics is the
tendency for events to move full circle with few if any lessons being
learned from the previous cycle.
Recent events, including the latest Labour slippage on its devolution
pledges and the re-emergence of Canon Wright, suggest Scotland is lining
up for another action replay on the home rule front.
Only time will tell but the facts in this cycle will remain largely
unchanged. Since Keir Hardie, contesting a parliamentary by-election in
mid-Lanark in 1888, said, ''I am strongly in favour of home rule for
Scotland, being convinced that until we have a parliament of our own we
cannot obtain the many and great reforms on which I believe the people
of Scotland have set their hearts'', the Labour Party has been
supposedly advancing this vital demand of the Scottish people.
Now the cycle begins again, with the English Labour Party waking up to
Labour's devolution plans and the opposition once again beginning to
mount.
Watching Tony Blair sell out Labour tradition after tradition in his
drive to win Tory votes in the South of England, does anyone seriously
believe that the Tory move to win the ''little Englander'' flag, which
already has Labour activists in the South clamouring to join in, will
not result in Scottish aspirations once more being consigned to the
dustbin?
The fact remains the same: to win home rule a majority of Scots need
to vote for it. In Scotland that means voting SNP. Sadly to date this
has not happened and equally sadly Scotland has no parliament for this
reason and no other.

I wonder if any of your readers have also been driven to distraction
by BT's new and presumably more efficient system for dealing with sales
inquiries.
I have a very simple request which involves asking an account manager
to talk to me about my office telephone system and how it can be
upgraded.
The first hurdle is to get through the screening system which greets
the customer when he phones 152 and gets a recorded message asking him
to press some buttons.
The caller is then directed to another part of the country, which may
be anywhere from Thurso to St Ives, and asked to leave his message,
which is then relayed to the account manager.
So far I have spoken to six message-takers but still no word from the
account manager.
Is this progress?

Keith Bruce's article on the plans for a national gallery in Glasgow
(January 11) quotes Angus Grossart as stating that the trustees of the
National Galleries of Scotland ''have a responsibility for the whole of
Scotland, not just to Edinburgh''.
It is unfortunate, therefore, that no reference was then made to the
plans for a major gallery serving Scotland from the Highlands, launched
last November as a potential candidate for funds from the Millennium
Commission.
Glasgow has a world-class range of galleries, soon to be enhanced by
the Gallery of Modern Art to be opened in the former Stirling's Library.
In the Highlands over 370,000 people -- equivalent to almost half the
population of Glasgow -- plus the many hundreds of thousands who come
each year as tourists to view the work of art that is our physical
environment, have no access to major exhibitions of the visual arts,
historical or contemporary.
When so many of the most iconic images of Scottish art -- from
Raeburn's clan chiefs to Landseer's Monarch of the Glen -- are of
Highland origin, this is surely a situation for which a remedy is long
overdue.
Certainly the National Galleries have plans for Duff House but it
seems highly unlikely that this can offer the range and depth of visual
arts programming which the Highlands and Islands deserve, or in the
innovative ways put forward by the Gallery 2000 proposals.
Is it too much to hope, therefore, that the needs of Scotland as a
whole will feature prominently in the continuing debate about the
extended role of the National Galleries of Scotland?

It was good to read in the Meek on Monday column that he had a good

Few would disagree with his wish for cleaner streets here, and more
police on them, as a result of his observations during this holiday.
But I am a bit confused. He considers the level of council tax to be
irrelevant and political claptrap. But isn't this what pays for

January 12.
I also attended the Saturday evening performance of Iolanthe by
Scottish Opera and enjoyed the familiar tunes and songs. However, there
was a marked absence of encores, which indicated the performance had not
been ''brilliant''.
Having been brought up on a diet of virtuoso performances by Peter
Pratt and others in the mid-fifties, I too welcome the revival of
Gilbert and Sullivan operas but my adjective for the all-round
impression would be workmanlike.
I can only assume that Elizabeth Clark (January 9) is too young to
remember the golden days of D'Oyly Carte. A good performance, yes, but
not brilliant.

GAFFES which made Hillary Rodham Clinton such a lightning rod for
criticism have finally forced America's First Lady to confront the
unthinkable. By her own admission she has been ''naive and dumb'' in her
approach to national politics and, as a result, the President's top
domestic priority, the Health Care Reform Bill, now lies in tatters on
the floor of her honorary office.
Even in the United States, where confessional politics has become
routine, Mrs Clinton's announcement of failure, if not silencing her
harshest critics, has at least taken them by surprise. But precisely why
did such a feisty individual stray on to this alien territory?
Her disclosures were made not to the granite-eyed press corps at the
White House (which has been so resolutely on the attack) but to a group
of women writers from journalism's softer pastures, the social
chit-chatters of Washington high life. There again, these reporters were
perhaps among the earliest to find Hillary's manner offensive. During
the 1992 election campaign she, determined to turn First Lady status
into an activist's role, had horrified bourgeois America, and certainly
her husband's political handlers, by implying contempt for wives who
choose to stay at home and bake cookies.
So there was shrewdness in her selection of this tidy, well-dressed
bunch of scribes for the big mea culpa. And by acknowledging the damage
caused by her own errors, she has now knocked herself off any arrogant
perch and made the invincible Hillary seem vulnerable at last.
But to repent fully Mrs Clinton must be seen to have changed. The
drafting of health care reform -- a key factor in placing the Clintons
in the White House -- was her responsibility. However, after the Bill's
collapse in Congress last September the First Lady seized on sexism as
the all too obvious reason for its demise: she was, she said, a woman
struggling against a male-dominated political system which found her
authority impossible to accept.
No-one can convincingly deny there are elements of truth in her
perception of old-fashioned chauvinism. Long before the allegations of
Bill Clinton's philandering and Newt Gingrich's insult was made known by
his indiscreet mother, the Republicans attempted to turn Hillary into a
feminist bitch to incite the kind of frantic prejudice which still
confronts women who do not conform.
The ploy failed initially because all it did was force the electorate
to consider the apparent daftness of that claim that there was more
threat than comfort in the fact that the President had an intelligent
and unusually accomplished spouse. As it happens no other political
couple have been more tested in the court of public opinion.
But now, by seeming to agree with the Republicans' original
contention, Hillary is distancing herself from the notion that sexist
prejudice was her downfall. She believed, she says, that she could reach
an accommodation with the Republicans in Congress, but her efforts on
health care were badly misunderstood because she lacked the political
savvy to seek strong political counsel. ''I take responsibility for
that, and I'm very sorry.''
Little more than a year ago, though, headlines declared that she had
won the Capitol, like some mighty conqueror. She came, she saw, she
wowed, answering every question about health care so effectively that
politicians were in awe and the media gushed. Under the spotlight, under
pressure, Hillary was proclaimed a pro.
However, at last week's gathering she asked how she could make America
view her more sympathetically. Suggestions were not immediately
forthcoming but there is no doubt that yet another team of
image-builders has set up camp in the White House. The gentling of
Hillary has begun.
''Sometimes I read stories and hear things about me and I go 'Ugh',''
the First Lady reflected, adding: ''I wouldn't like that person either.
It's so unlike what I think I am.'' Perhaps Mrs Clinton is only
accepting the inevitable, but in so doing she is also replacing
bossiness with fallibility, skilfully presenting herself as an underdog.
But Whitewater hasn't helped. The couple who insisted to the
electorate that they were different, upfront, and undevious in personal
money matters have now been revealed as squirrelly and evasive about
their private, incomprehensible finances.
So now Mrs Clinton again moves from centre stage to concentrate, this
time, on the painful (and maybe winning) matter of neglected children,
observing without any glimpse of irony that absentee parents are not
confined to the welfare class. Meanwhile Chelsea, the Clintons's only
child, looks on as glumly lonely as ever.
In a sense Hillary has become a kind of cultural test for America's
shifting attitudes to women and the continuing ambivalence towards
working wives. Once tagged buy-one-get-one-free, the couple no longer
talk even jokingly of having her serve in the Cabinet. Yet with her
husband a prisoner of the Republicans and her own options mostly shot to
pieces, Mrs Clinton's customary self-confidence has suffered a grievous
blow. ''I would have done a lot of things differently,'' she declares,
''but I am confident I would have made different mistakes.'' It is a
curious thing but that wistful, manipulative candour might just be
enough to revive a nation's trust in this flawed yet venturesome First
Lady.

EVER wondered what the Brussels bureaucrats are doing with Europe's
apple mountain these days? Well they actually have their own
organisation called Eurofru, and Eurofru is writing to all the primary
schools in Scotland inviting them to design an apple carpet. Never heard
of an apple carpet? That's because it's just been invented by Eurofru.
The idea is that the schoolkids can use all the different colours and
sizes of apples to design a carpet.
Oh, and they can cheat a little by wrapping a few of them in blue and
white paper to add colour to the design, otherwise it would be a bit on
the red and green side.
The winning designs will then be made into real apple carpets, with
about 3000 apples used for each one. According to organiser David
Browning, it will encourage children to ''throw away their sweets and
get the apple-a-day habit instead.''
Can't see it David. Just because they're going to be stepping over
3000 rotting apples in their playground is hardly going to make them
give up their Mars Bars. I don't think Axminster should be worrying just
yet.
Age of innocence
IF you are concerned about youngsters becoming too interested in sex
at an early age, then here's a heartening tale from The Glasgow
Brickyard. No, it's not a trendy club, it actually does sell bricks. The
building trade, as you might imagine, is still not quite as politically
correct as the rest of us, and so The Glasgow Brickyard distributes
calendars with photographs, not of their premises in Blochairn Road in
the city's east end, but one entitled Tropicana, which has women of
seemingly impossible dimensions wearing nothing but impossibly small
tangas, as they were described to me.
Director Ken Kelly was taking some customers to a football match --
there are still some Kellys who are welcome at football matches -- and
he was showing them his new 95 calendar when a small boy approached and
asked the inevitable: ''Can a watch yur caur, mister?'' He then added:
''Oh mister, gies a look at yur calendar.''
Mr Kelly duly obliged, and waited for some salacious comment as the
youngster flicked through the girls, only to be told: ''Oh ya beauty --
ma birthday's oan a Saturday this year!''
Decidedly ambivalent
THERE was something inevitable about the advert for a manager for the
National Schizophrenia Fellowship (Scotland) in The Herald last week. It
said applications to job share would be considered.
I know schizophrenia is not a laughing matter, but people who saw the
advert say they are in two minds about whether to apply.
Sanity test
FRENCH culture. No doubt loses a bit in translation. You can judge for
yourself at the Institut Francais D'Ecosse in Edinburgh which is
mounting a touring show called Test. It consists of three film screens
in the middle of an empty darkened space. When you break a
heat-sensitive beam, the projectors are activated, with one showing
orange letters spelling out TEST, another has film footage of the flats
in Gorbals which were blown up recently, and the third shows a teddy
bear made of yellow Harris Tweed sporting a Stuart tartan bow tie.
Sounds like the strangest attired teddy bear since Rangers launched
their lilac third strip.
What's it all about? you ask. Simple. As the institut explains: ''The
installation is in formal terms simply about synchronisation and
de-synchronisation, about being in harmony, and being out of harmony but
in relation to its chosen imagery, ie, the teddy bear, the animated
letters, the exploding blocks of flats, a tension exists creating an
uneasiness between comfort and security in the projection of dreams and
child-like imagination and the destruction of illusions and breakdown of
a stable condition.''
True enough, I feel a breakdown of a stable condition coming on just
reading about it.
Funny money-man
IT'S a sad day when even highly respected bankers poke fun at
Glasgow's footballing institutions. Alistair Dempster, president of the
Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland, was hosting the institute's
biennial dinner in Glasgow this week when he explained to the guests
that they had approval from the Lord Lyon to add, in heraldic terms, two
supporters to their official crest. ''We were convinced,'' he told his
fellow bankers, ''that with only two supporters it would become known as
the Partick Thistle Crest.'' So unfair.
Then he had a go at Celtic and their recent share issue. ''In
anticipation of oversubscription, the Celtic board has decided not to
return cheques to unsuccessful applicants but to provide other forms of
recompense. One syndicate from Possilpark looks set to become the owners
of Mike Galloway. Mark you, #623 doesn't buy you much these days.''
It should be pointed out that the Chartered Institute of Bankers is
based in Edinburgh.

MR JOHN MAJOR did not expect gratitude when he propelled Jacques
Santer into the presidency of the European Commission in preference to
the allegedly arch- federalist Jean-Luc Dehaene. Nor were there any
illusions, privately at least, about Mr Santer's real views on European
integration. He was preferred because he was thought to be more
malleable than the tough-minded Mr Dehaene and less wedded to any
particular Euro-ideology. It is one of the misfortunes of Mr Major's
political career that he can often read a situation correctly, but is
incapable of using it to his own advantage. When he perceived Mr Santer
as malleable he was correct. The problem is that Mr Santer will be
influenced by the most powerful forces impinging on him, and in this
respect and at this moment Mr Major and the views of the British
Government count for relatively little. That is in part the reason
behind Mr Santer's aggressively pro-integration speech to the commission
in Strasbourg yesterday in which he launched his five-year term as
president. The British Government was not mentioned in the speech, but
in almost all of his criticisms of governments which try to keep matters
under national control, which challenge the prevailing notion of
Europe's future, which opt out of social policy, and which think that
subsidiarity applies to their neighbours but not to them, it was
possible silently to form the name of the United Kingdom.
Mr Santer's speech will have upset Downing Street, though it has no
reason to be surprised. It has probably caused near-apoplexy within the
Conservative Party's Europhobic wing. Indeed, the ever-predictable Bill
Cash MP claimed last night that the federalists were on the march again
and that the Inter-Governmental Conference of EU member states next year
must be turned into what he was pleased to call a massive constitutional
issue. This is premature, even for those who subscribe to the knee-jerk
reactions of Mr Cash and his colleagues. Moreover, it ignores the
context in which Mr Santer spoke yesterday. His first act as president
has been to introduce his proposed commissioners for the approval of the
European Parliament. A few of them ran into trouble during their
introductory comments to the Parliament, partly because they stuck too
literally to their instructions not to make any policy promises which
might turn into hostages to fortune, and partly because they were unsure
of what was required of them. This irritated the Parliament, and Mr
Santer's speech clearly had to be rigorous enough in European terms to
placate it. In this he has succeeded.
The other pressure on him is the French presidency of the EU which
will last until the middle of the year. Mr Mitterrand, surely making one
of his last major appearances on the European stage, spoke yesterday of
French hopes for the six-month term. He insisted that Europe could only
be transformed into a major and growing economic and monetary power if
it had a single currency. Warming to his theme, he promised that the
French presidency would work towards maintaining the timetable which
calls for a single European currency by 1997. The French propose to
achieve this aim by removing technical obstacles to monetary union and
by promoting price stability and fiscal consolidation. This sounds
promising but is actually highly ambitious. It is wise to remember,
especially when listening to Mr Mitterrand, that his evident enjoyment
of his own rhetoric often allows him to travel far ahead of what he
actually believes is possible. The French are aware that their German
partners are increasingly doubtful about the timetable for monetary
union. A substantial majority of the German public appears to oppose
monetary union and Chancellor Helmut Kohl has cooled noticeably in his
enthusiasm for it. Mr Major may characterise this as evidence of Britain
winning the arguments in Europe. This is a pleasant conceit for the
Government to hold but one that is far too fanciful. Our Government is
not at the heart of Europe, either in terms of real positioning or in
influence. Until this is achieved Mr Santer will be no more respectful
and those issues which go Mr Major's way will be the result of the
actions and convictions of others.

FEW men, after marriage, do not become aware of a subtle difference in
their diet. Sometimes the change is quite dramatic. One moment a
bachelor has his private, masculine routine . . . take-away curries,
pizzas, and fish suppers, interspersed with king prawn fried rice,
hamburgers, and perhaps the occasional chip sandwich. The next he is
being asked to use a napkin, drink wine instead of lager, and eat
salads. In the romantic, early days, she will undoubtedly light candles.
It is a pity that a two-year research project being undertaken at
Glasgow and Edinburgh universities is to study only the diet of
childless couples, and that they are to be interviewed just twice --
three months before setting up home together, and three months
afterwards. The aims of the study are lofty enough. ''In marriage, food
and meals have significant, symbolic functions which affect the choice
of food, its preparation, the way it is served, and how it is eaten,''
says Dr Deborah Kemmer, a Gilmorehill sociologist. The most important
changes in married diet, however, come after the arrival of children,
especially before the age of five. It may take some time before a
husband realises he has not eaten a steak pie recently, or even lamb
chops. There is meat and gravy, to be sure, but it is invariably served
with boiled potatoes, which can be mashed up and eaten with a spoon. As
for desserts, they are best described as falling into the generic
category of pap . . . a medley of custards, semolina, rice puddings,
etc, that will not upset tiny digestions.
''The role of the gender in taking decisions and performing tasks is
crucial to our understanding of marital relationships,'' says Dr Kemmer.
Quite so. It would be interesting to find out what part food plays in
marital fidelity. The first danger signal could be when a wife sniffs at
her husband's lapel and detects a strange new fragrance. It will not be
another woman's perfume, but the lingering aroma of a lunchtime
vindaloo.

In honour of Sir Alexander Gibson, who died at the
weekend, The Herald is setting up an associate
conductorship with the Royal SNO -- to give talented
young Scots a foothold in a profession that is notoriously
difficult to enter. Michael Tumelty reports
THE Herald is to create an associate conductorship with the Royal
Scottish National Orchestra to perpetuate the name and memory of Sir
Alexander Gibson, who died at the weekend.
The new post will be designed to give talented young conductors
invaluable experience in working with a major symphony orchestra, and a
foothold in one of the most difficult professions to enter.
Paul Hughes, chief executive of the Royal SNO, said the orchestra was
honoured to be asked to participate. ''We're very pleased that The
Herald has suggested this. It's a very exciting possibility and one that
we've actually been talking about for a year or so, but there have
always been other priorities.
''Suddenly, The Herald coming forward with this suggestion gives the
concept a tremendous stimulus, particularly as it is something that will
keep Alex's name associated with the orchestra.''
Mr Hughes said he would be talking to the leader and principal
conductor of the orchestra about the project, but he saw it as a
marvellous opportunity to find a real young talent.
''It's the opportunity, not to throw them into the limelight too soon,
but to really nurture them, to learn and develop their craft, to learn
the repertoire, and to learn how to deal with an orchestra.
''We don't know whether selection will be by competition or audition.
Details will be announced when we decide, but it will take time to put
something as important as this in place. We are not seeking applications
immediately.''
The duties of an associate conductor, he said, might include shadowing
the music director, assisting with preparation of difficult contemporary
pieces, taking sectional rehearsals, assisting on a big project such as
an opera performance, and covering for a conductor who falls ill on the
day of a concert.
''It's the opportunity to 'bring on' a young talent, and young, good
conductors would give their eye teeth for such a relationship with an
orchestra.''
George McKechnie, editor of The Herald, said: ''It is generally agreed
that Sir Alexander Gibson was the most important Scot of his time in the
music world. The Herald is delighted to be able to provide the Royal
Scottish National Orchestra with the opportunity to keep his name alive
and at the same time create an opportunity for today's talented young
conductors.''
Helen Brebner, Sir Alex's secretary and personal assistant, said
yesterday that Lady Veronica, Sir Alex's widow, was extremely pleased
about the project initiated by The Herald.
''The family thought that it is a lovely idea,'' said Mrs Brebner.
''Conducting is a Catch 22 thing: you need the work to get established,
but you cannot get the work until you are established. Lady Veronica is
very moved and very pleased that this is a lasting idea that will keep
Alex's name associated with the orchestra in a very definite way.''
The Gibson memorial conductorship is a project that would have been
dear to Sir Alex's heart. While a student at the Royal College of Music
in the late forties, he was not allowed to study conducting himself, and
was forced to take the initiative by forming his own student orchestra
and rehearsing it outside the college premises.
In the early fiftes, he served a two-year period as an assistant to
Iain Whyte, conductor of the BBC Scottish Orchestra, an experience which
laid considerable groundwork for the young Scot who was to have such a
revolutionary impact in his own country only a decade later.
Nearly half a century on, it remains a shortcoming of the music
profession in Britain that there is no established route into the
business for aspiring young conductors. Those who do make it tend to
work their way in through experience gained in European opera houses.
The Gibson family returned to Glasgow from London on Monday night. Sir
Alex's secretary said the family had decided, because so many people
were likely to want to attend, that the funeral service would be public,
not private.
The service will take place in Glasgow Cathedral this Saturday at
11.30am.

Thanks to our Mairi, Channel Four's flair for buying American
small-screen drama is in a different class, writes Allan Laing.
THIS could be a story about a wee Scots lass who goes to London and
makes good. But first, it's a story about Channel Four and its
astonishing record of success with imported American drama. We'll get to
the Scots lass later.
To begin: a short history lesson. Once upon a time BBC and ITV were
packed with mainstream serials from the US. It started with cowboys --
Wagon Train and Bronco, Tenderfoot and Rawhide. Then it was cops --
programmes like 77 Sunset Strip and Dragnet. You couldn't move for
Kojaks, Rockfords, and Columbos, and the places to be were South Fork
and Knot's Landing.
Then, about 10 years ago, it all went pear-shaped. The fickle American
television industry moved away from its staple diet of hour-long drama
serials and moved instead towards a mixture of tele-movies, mini-series,
and half-hour comedies. More recently, the US networks have taken a
further turn for the worse with those awful cheap-to-make reality-based
programmes, sensational crime reconstructions and mock-shock-journalism.
This sad state of affairs left European broadcasters with a huge
headache. Unlike the US, there was still a significant viewing appetite
for imported hour-long drama and UK stations in particular were
desperate to find them. They were, after all, relatively cheap to
acquire and they remained extremely popular. The problem was, they no
longer existed. Consequently, British television was forced to re-invent
its domestic drama output. A classic case of clouds and silver lining.
Throughout this period, however, there was one significant exception
to the rule. Channel Four, almost from the day it started, had adopted a
policy of seeking out quality American drama -- and found itself with a
hugely successful niche market. Though it did (and still does) produce
and commission its own share of drama, it was forced to buy in US
programmes because it worked within a much lower operational budget than
other UK stations.
It all began with half-hour comedies, first Cheers and then Roseanne.
Comedy, as they say, is all about timing, and Channel Four picked
exactly the right moment. Cheers came along at a time when British
situation comedy (arguably now the best in the world) was at its lowest
ebb. It wasn't funny. Viewers were crying out for the best of humour.
Bouyed by its initial success, Channel Four gained confidence and went
on to acquire programmes like Hill Street Blues, St Elsewhere,
Thirtysomething, The Golden Girls and more recently Northern Exposure,
Homicide, and Frasier. Today it has the reputation for being the natural
home of intelligent, high-quality, imported drama and comedy. It is now
perfectly positioned to take advantage of the Hollywood studios' recent
collective decision to return to the hour-long format.
(US television actually belies its perceived image of being an
industry which takes chances. In fact, it seldom does. If one studio
succeeds with something different, the rest follow suit. Which is why
they are now all in the process of churning out 60-minute dramas).
Channel Four took the lead last year when it acquired NYPD Blue,
Steven Bochco's enormously successful cop show which returns for a
second series next Monday. And it will stay well ahead of the pack on
February 1 when it shows the pilot episode of what could turn out to be
the biggest and most successful US drama series in years.
ER is not an expression of hesitation. It is the hottest show in town.
Written by Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park, Rising Sun, and Disclosure)
and produced by Stephen Spielberg's television offshoot, Amblin, it's a
cross between Casualty and Hill Street Blues -- and then some.
It's a frantic, traumatised, virtual-reality drama about life and
death in the emergency unit of an overworked city hospital. A compelling
series which brings out the voyeur in us all. It's Holby General with
attitude. Dr Kildare on speed. It's as if someone took St Elsewhere and
pumped it full of adrenalin.
One American critic described it as the perfect series for the
''channel surfer''. A programme which made the remote control button
redundant -- so fast you never have to flip the channel because it flips
it for you.
Crichton, a Harvard graduate in medicine who started his literary
career with pulpish medical thrillers, based the series on his own
experiences as a hospital intern. However, when he tried to sell the
idea as a feature film to Spielberg in 1990, the director, clearly not
convinced, asked him what else he had in the pipeline. Crichton
mentioned that he was working on a book about dinosaurs -- so the pair
collaborated on Jurassic Park at the expense of ER.
Then last year Warner Brothers showed an interest and a pilot episode
was produced. Reaction was favourable and a series was commissioned.
America loved it. In its first series shown last year, it achieved the
highest audience penetration for any new US drama series since Charlie's
Angels in 1976. Viewing figures were regularly at the 30 million mark
and it was never out of the top three programmes.
And who went out and bought it for Channel Four? Why a wee Scots lass
who went to London and made good, of course.
Mairi MacDonald comes from Port Seaton and graduated in politics at
Edinburgh University. She started working as a researcher in the BBC
Radio library, moving later to the Corporation's programme purchasing
department and ending up as editor in charge of BBCs 1 and 2. Six years
ago she transferred to Channel Four and set up its Purchased Programmes
Department.
Each year around May she joins TV executives from all over the world
who converge on LA to wage war in the annual battle for new programmes.
It's a ruthless business and few prisoners are taken. The major studios
show them the pilots of the various programmes they are planning for the
autumn and the executives decide what they want -- and what they can
afford. Then it's down to hard-talking and the occasional dirty trick.
With ER Mairi won a watch. ''It was difficult,'' she explains,
''because there were two medical dramas to choose from. The other one
was Chicago Hope, which Sky bought. We were lucky because it turned out
that ER shot it out of the water.''
A typical successful American series has a life expectancy of about
four years. This gives the studio enough episodes to build up a critical
mass which can then be sold on to the syndication market. There are
exceptions, of course. Cheers went on for 10 years and The Golden Girls
(another Channel Four success) ran for seven.
Channel Four has an enviable record in the market. Over the years it
has missed out on only a handful of major imports. It would have liked
Twin Peaks but, when it came up for grabs six years ago, the station
couldn't afford it. BBC2's The X Files is another series which would
have sat comfortably in Channel Four but it came out the same year as
NYPD Blue so a choice had to be made.
Mairi MacDonald adds: ''When you are watching these pilots you have to
decide first of all whether or not they are going to be successful in
the US. Then you have to take it a stage further and decide how well
they will go down in Britain.
''It is a case of asking yourself if there are enough strong
characters to maintain interest beyond the pilot. And then beyond the
first three or four episodes.
''The second question you have to address is whether or not the
original team is going to stick with it. In the case of ER, the studio
assured us that this was going to be the case. Then you have to look at
the series itself.
''With ER everyone thought it was excellent and a perfect Channel Four
show. It was a new attempt to take up a fairly old genre and do it
differently and do it well.''
While many of these Channel Four imports are not hugely successful in
terms of audience attraction -- NYPD Blue, for all its critical acclaim,
could notch up only two million viewers an episode at the cut-throat 9pm
Saturday slot -- they are usually regarded as prestigous, talked-about
shows. They tend to attract the fashionable, intelligent, and affluent
-- music to the ears of the all-important advertisers.
The first series of ER starts with a 90-minute pilot episode on
Wednesday, Feb 1, on Channel Four. The second series of NYPD Blue starts
on Monday.

A BLIND man yesterday declared that the Princess of Wales was ''the
prettiest woman I have ever seen'' after he touched her face.
The Princess was visiting seeAbility, formerly the Royal School for
the Blind of which she is patron, when she met Mr Chris Anderson, 22.
Mr Anderson, who was born without eyes, had met the Princess before
Christmas at a reception at Kensington Palace. Yesterday, however, he
asked the Princess if he could feel what she looked like.
The Princess sat patiently as he put both hands to her face as she sat
with him in the dining room of the centre in Leatherhead, Surrey.
Mr Anderson is staying in one of the flats at the centre whichprovides
residential care and training for blind people who have other
disabilities.
He has been there for six months learning how to lead a
semi-independent life.
Later, he said of the Princess: ''She is the prettiest woman I have
ever seen. She recognised me from Kensington Palace and said she was
very pleased to see me.
''We were talking and I asked her if I could see what she looked like.
She said she didn't mind.
''She had very small features and felt very smooth -- she has got a
nice face.''
The Princess spent more than half-an-hour longer than originally
scheduled touring the centre and meeting the residents.
She watched a cookery class and met residents in the sports hall as
they were being helped to play a form of badminton and to use exercise
machines.
The Princess seemed at ease as she chatted to staff and officials and
was happy to allow two-year-old Harriet Williams, who was supposed to
present her with flowers at the start of the visit, to keep a firm grip
on the posy.
The Royal School for the Blind was the first charity to which the
Princess gave her patronage.
The visit was her third to the centre and was arranged at the last
minute at her request.
It marks another stage in the Princess's gradual re-emergence into
public life, with a few selected visits to favourite charities.
Ms Ali Knowles, spokeswoman for seeAbility, said: ''We were absolutely
delighted that the Princess stayed well beyond her schedule. She spoke
to many residents and expressed her support of our work.''
The Princess is to add another date to her diary of public outings
with a visit to Paris on Saturday to watch Wales play France at rugby in
the first weekend of the Five Nations championships.
Buckingham Palace confirmed she was making a private visit as a guest
of the French rugby authorities.

A NORTH Sea diver who suffered nightmares after witnessing at close
range the Piper Alpha disaster is suing the owners and operators of the
platform for #250,000.
Mr Paul Heathfield feared the blazing oil platform would collapse on
top of him as he worked through the night to tend the victims, a court
was told yesterday. He began sleepwalking, even when working offshore.
Mr Heathfield, from Dereham, in Norfolk, is claiming damages from Elf
Enterprise Caledonia Ltd, Union Texas Petroleum, LASMO (TNS) Ltd, and
Texaco Britain Ltd, owners of the Piper Alpha platform at the time.
He told Lord Milligan at the Court of Session that on July 6, 1988, he
was working as a diver for Sub-Sea Offshore on the support vessel MSV
Tharos.
Throughout the night of the disaster, he acted as a stretcher bearer,
worked in the hospital on board Tharos, and also helped with the dead.
Mr Heathfield told the court he put 18 bodies into body bags. A total of
167 died.
As he worked, he was aware of further explosions on Piper Alpha and
thought the platform might collapse on to the Tharos.
''I looked towards Piper Alpha and there was what appeared to be an
enormous burning cloud coming towards us. I believe everybody there was
in fear of their lives and literally ran for cover.''
At one point, a large explosion produced a fireball which partly
engulfed the support vessel.
Mr Heathfield said that for a few months after the catastrophe he was
all right physically and mentally but then began experiencing disturbing
nightmares, sometimes at home, but mostly when he was working offshore.
''It was as if the room was closing in on me. The ceiling was often
collapsing down towards me.'' He would also have nightmares about having
to escape from a confined space and about large objects such as pieces
of metal or a beam ready to collapse on to him.
Mr Heathfield, who is now unemployed, said he had finally sought
medical help after his room-mate offshore saw him sleepwalking, both in
the room and outside in the corridor.
His supervisor advised him to seek professional help and he was
diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his
experiences during the catastrophe. He gave up working offshore in July
1992.
Mr Heathfield claims the Piper Alpha disaster was caused by the
negligence of the platform operators. He says he was not aware of the
nature or cause of his condition until he was given medical advice in
about September 1991. He was also unaware of claims based on ''survivor
stress'' until he saw a TV programme on the subject at the beginning of
1993.
The platform operators argue that even if Mr Heathfield suffered the
problems he alleges, his action is time-barred because it was raised
more than three years after the date of the incident.
They say the circumstances of the disaster, the subsequent public
inquiry, and the incidence of survivor stress were notorious and
reported in the media from 1988 onwards.
Lord Milligan is expected to give a decision in writing later.

A NEIGHBOUR'S interest in the progress of the girl next door, who
became a top scientist, has led to an unexpected windfall of #350,000
for a Scottish university and the opening of a new cancer research
laboratory.
When Dr Patricia Cohen was twelve, she used to sneak into the garden
of Miss Marian Brunskill to retrieve her lacrosse ball.
Miss Brunskill kept an eye on Dr Cohen's career over the years and
when Miss Brunskill died last year at the age of 95, she left #350,000
in her will to the unit at Dundee University run by Dr Cohen's husband,
Professor Philip Cohen.
The money has been used to build the Brunskill Laboratory at the
university's department of biochemistry, which was opened officially
yesterday
The husband and wife team are based at the internationally-recognised
Medical Research Council unit which carries out pioneering work on human
cell structure and diseases.
Dr Cohen said: ''It came as a complete surprise to hear that Miss
Brunskill had bequested such a large amount of money to further our
research.
''I remember very little about Miss Brunskill, who was a neighbour
when I grew up in the village of Greenmount in Lancashire, except that
she had a reputation for being rather fierce. I hope that we can put the
money to good use in the way Miss Brunskill would have wished.''
The bequest has enabled construction of the new facility, which will
employ 18 people to carry out research into cancer and nervous diseases.
The money has also been used to purchase a DNA machine for Dr Cohen,
who is head of the molecular biology division of the unit.
Professor Cohen, who is director of the unit, explained that his wife
was not very close to Miss Brunskill, which meant that the the bequest
was a total surprise.
He said: ''We've certainly been short of laboratory space and this has
been a godsend.
''It will help us to develop our work on cancer and my wife is very
pleased.''
The unit gets #1m funding each year from the Medical Research Council
and Professor Cohen said this was the first bequest which had been
received.
The unit received a donation of #40,000 from Sean Connery five years
ago which was used to establish the departmental library.

<HEADLINE>Lang-backed spending spree is announced to build deeper and broader business base Scottish Enterprise boosts aid by #24m</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Enterprise has dug deeply into contingency funds to increase
budget allocations to its network of 13 local enterprise companies by an
average of almost 10%.
The contingency fund now will stand at only #6m, compared with more
than #30m last year, in a spending spree designed to underline
confidence in the work of local enterprise companies.
Mr Crawford Beveridge, chief executive of Scottish Enterprise,
yesterday insisted that the #6m would still give flexibility in
responding to crisis. In other words, the agency does not expect to face
repeats of blows to the Scottish economy on the scale of Ravenscraig
steelworks or Rosyth naval base.
However, Mr Beveridge appeared reluctant to look further forward than
the 1995-96 financial year, when the Lecs' budgets will increase by
anything from 2.4% to 17.9%.
It would appear that such rises in 1996-97 will be impossible without
more Government input because the #24m from the contingency fund is a
one-off payout.
The Government last month announced a 3.5% increase in the Scottish
Enterprise budget to #464.6m, including #3m specifically for derelict
land clearance and reclamation in Glasgow for housing.
The agency, charged with distributing the #464.6m, confirmed yesterday
it had agreed to release even more money by retaining only a minimum
contingency fund.
It wants Lecs -- which have faced severe criticism of operations in
recent times -- to plan the fullest possible portfolio of programmes,
aimed at building a broader and deeper business base for Scotland.
However, a failsafe mechanism has been introduced to ensure the Lecs
still save money for a rainy day -- with 2.5% of their allocations held
in the contingency fund for at least the first six months of the
financial year.
Mr Beveridge said Scottish Enterprise had been surprised by the
Government's settlement, which was broadly in line with guidelines on
public sector expenditure but allowed some additions to reflect new or
expanded activities.
Fife Enterprise and Glasgow Development Agency are the biggest
beneficiaries -- with budget increases of 17.9% and 16.2% respectively,
while Moray, Badenoch and Strathspey Enterprise gets just 2.4%.
A Fife spokesman described its increase as very pleasing but warned it
was in recognition of the area's challenges over unemployment, the
highest in mainland Scotland, and a continuing defence sector rundown,
specifically Rosyth.
It was hoped that Fife had begun to turn the corner after recently
attracting significant inward investment, he said.
Glasgow Development Agency, especially critical of last year's cut in
budget, said its 16.1% increase was excellent news. Its chairman, Mr
Forbes Macpherson, said the GDA would continue the task of regenerating
the economy and environment of Scotland's biggest city. It was committed
to helping existing companies, creating new businesses, and more jobs.
He added that the budget increase sent out the ''clearest possible
signal that Scottish Enterprise recognises the economy of Glasgow . . .
. as vitally important to the economy of Scotland as a whole, and that
its economic development is of crucial strategic significance to the
country's economic well-being''.
Renfrewshire Enterprise described its 7.3% rise as the green light to
take forward the biggest long-term jobs creation programme in Scotland
-- a #300m international business district around Glasgow Airport,
creating 16,000 jobs over 10 years.
A spokesman said the increase would allow Renfrewshire Enterprise to
progress a new three-year plan to create 7500 jobs, assist 1000
companies, and help 20,000 people through skills training or
career-change opportunities.
Lanarkshire Development Agency's budget is up by only 4.6% but,
according to Scottish Enterprise, reflects the view that most of the
infrastructure to attract new businesses is now in place.
LDA chairman Ian Livingston said: ''We are pleased the Scottish
Enterprise board has again recognised the special challenge which faces
us in achieving Lanarkshire's economic regeneration.
''This increased allocation will enable us to carry on and complete
the major programmes we are working on and build on the considerable
progress which has been made in Lanarkshire over the last four years.''
Dumfries and Galloway Enterprise will receive #9.7m, up 4.2%. Chief
executive Irene Walker said the rise was significant: ''It enables us to
help new and existing businesses, to become more competitive by
accessing new markets, developing new products and services, and helping
to create a greater volume of exports.''
Mr Donald MacKay, chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, said the
budget allocations reflected the continuing confidence shown by Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang in the network. He said the allocations would allow
Lecs to plan the fullest possible portfolio of activities.
The allocations, with percentage increases in brackets, are as
follows: Ayrshire, #28m (+6.8); Borders, #9.6m (+7.3); Dumfries and
Galloway, #9.7m (+4.2); Dunbartonshire, #20.8m (+10.9); Fife, #23.7m
(+17.9); Forth Valley, #22.6m (+11.9); Glasgow, #61.1m (+16.2);
Grampian, #22.2m (+7.7); Lanarkshire, #45.6m (+4.6); Lothian and
Edinburgh, #44.9m (+7.7); Moray, Badenoch, and Strathspey, #3.2m (+2.4);
Renfrewshire, #27.1m (+7.3), and Tayside, #25.8 (6.1%).

<HEADLINE>Probe into corruption claims by former employee of Student Loans Company. MP calls for fraud inquiry report to be published</HEADLINE>

A CHALLENGE went out to the Government yesterday to publish without
delay the findings of an inquiry into allegations of corruption at the
Glasgow-based Student Loans Company.
Mr Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat MP for Caithness and Sutherland
and a member of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ''Very serious
allegations of corruption in the company have been made.
''It is in the public interest that the full results of the inquiry
are made public as soon as possible. The Government can have no excuse
to cover up the findings.
''It is now evident that things have gone very badly wrong at the
Student Loans Company. If the company is to continue, drastic action
will need to be taken.''
The Government's financial watchdog, the Comptroller and Auditor
General Sir John Bourn, has confirmed to Mr Maclennan that accountants
Coopers and Lybrand continue to investigate the allegations.
The accountants were given the task by the Department of Education, to
which Sir John's office had sent allegations of corruption made by a
former loans company senior employee.
Sir John told Mr Maclennan that the investigation was taking longer to
complete because the loans company chief executive, Mr Ron Harrison, had
been too ill to answer questions. A senior academic, Sir Eric Ash, has
replaced Mr Harrison as acting chief executive.
Sir John has told Mr Maclennan that he intends to brief the public
accounts committee when the outcome of the investigation is known.
The MP fears, however, that, based on past experience, the Government
will postpone publication of the report until it has lost relevance,
particularly if it is damning.
Sir John has given notice that he intends to follow up earlier reports
on the administration of the company with a review to establish the
extent to which it is giving value for money. University chiefs have
already told the Government that its loans scheme is neither fair nor
efficient.
Mr Maclennan had written to Sir John to express concern about company
operations, including the number of loans being deferred or written off,
and the amount of litigation against student and graduate borrowers in
which the Government-funded agency would be involved.
Borrowers can defer loan repayments if they earn less than 85% of
average earnings. Sir John told Mr Maclennan that the deferment rate was
expected to remain at about 40% for some time.
He said the company expected at most 5500 legal actions this year,
rising to about 10,500 in 1996-7, and the volume of work involved in
tracing defaulters and taking litigation against them was set to
increase about eightfold between 1992 and 1995, broadly in line with the
number of loans due to be repaid.
The proportion of loans in default -- those due and for which no
deferment had been given -- is about 10%, although Sir John said it fell
in the course of the financial year.
Recognising that some loans may have to be abandoned, Sir John told
the MP: ''Whilst the company are currently pursuing collection of all
loans in default, they recognise that inevitably a rump of effectively
irrecoverable debt will build up over the years.''
He said the company's performance would be monitored in relation to
its forecasts.
* The company invited Mr Maclennan to its headquarters to view its
''successes and failures'' after he had released his correspondence with
Sir John. The MP said he would take up the offer. The company expects to
clear this week a backlog from students seeking to renew their loans. It
built up because of administrative blunders within the company.

A JUDGE suggested yesterday that there were consistencies which could
link a Scot with an alleged IRA bomb cache found in a wood two days
after his arrest, despite apparent contradictions in police and MI5
evidence.
The Crown claims that a surveillance video shows Mr Hugh Jack leaving
his council flat in Sauchie, Clackmannanshire, carrying a holdall on the
day of his arrest on July 14, 1993.
The holdall, containing six blocks of Semtex and other bomb-making
equipment, was found later in Gartinny Wood close to the turkey farm
where he was employed as a casual worker.
The defence alleges it was not a holdall Mr Jack was carrying, but a
black bin bag containing a jacket, wellington boots, a bottle of cola,
and a ''piece''.
Two Central Scotland police officers had told the court they were
convinced Mr Jack had carried a black holdall from his flat to his
Nissan car, although their initial report refers only to a black bag.
A security officer, monitoring video pictures taken by a surveillance
camera, had reported that Mr Jack was seen leaving his home in Lochbrae,
Sauchie, carrying a case.
Mrs Justice Ebworth, continuing her summing up yesterday, asked the
jury if the word case might help it in its deliberations. Was this
consistent with a bin bag? Were they talking about something solid, or
something malleable like a bin bag?
Mr Jack and Irishman Robert Fryer deny that between January and July
1993, they conspired together and with others unknown to cause
explosions that could have caused death, serious injury, and damage to
property.
Mr Fryer admits that he was arrested by police in London at a bus stop
when he was carrying a holdall containing a bomb.
The judge will continue her summing up today.

EXCLUSIVE
By IAIN WILSON
THREE wealthy individuals are being targeted by Scottish Enterprise to
spend #10m and provide advance factories in Lanarkshire after its
campaign to raise private sector cash in the City failed to come up to
expectations.
Scottish Enterprise had hoped to attract #100m in bids from the
private sector to get two enterprise zones up and running by paying for
construction of factories and offices.
At the time, the London investment market was said to be ''very
switched on'' to the scheme, codenamed The Chrysalis Project, and it was
predicted the unit trusts would ''sell like hotcakes''.
However, just #7.5m came in under phase one of the scheme, which was
expected to raise #20m from City institutions and others attracted by
profits from property rentals on the sites.
Mr Chris Aitken, Scottish Enterprise director of development,
yesterday confirmed a change in tack is now under way after the
''partial success'' of the original initiative.
He also confirmed three individuals, rather than institutions, were
being targeted for funds to build and run showpiece industrial sites
designed to combat rivals south of the border and attract businesses to
jobs-hungry Lanarkshire after the closure of the Ravenscraig steelworks.
Mr Aitken blamed the failure to raise the #20m on Treasury and Inland
Revenue changes in the treatment of enterprise zones. He said these
changes put off potential investors.
However, he insisted 40% tax breaks available to individuals who faced
huge tax bills now made investments attractive, especially with rental
returns once the factories were occupied.
Mr Aitken declined to identify the three men asked for #10m because
negotiations with their agents were at an advanced stage and publicity
could jeopardise any deals. They were described only as ''business
magnates, based in the UK''.
He stressed the #7.5m raised previously had still allowed the private
sector to build two 50,000sq ft factories at Blantyre, with the
potential for 300 jobs. The plants will be completed by the end of this
month. One is under legal offer to an undisclosed American electronics
firm. It is, however, also looking at two other inward investment sites.
It was hoped to build five factories totalling 250,000sq ft under
phase one of The Chrysalis Project.
It was also forecast that the project in its entirety could attract
#100m. However, just #60m would be needed to build the one million
square feet of industrial and commercial property which had been
proposed for the sites over 10 years. In effect, Scottish Enterprise
would not only have fully utilised the sites but have #40m left in the
kitty.
Scottish Enterprise sources last night suggested the original
announcement to raise private money had been too ambitious.

A SCOTS ex-Army lieutenant denied in court yesterday that he was
''more than willing'' when fellow officers in the Royal Horse Artillery
strapped him naked to a ceremonial cannon.
Mr Alastair Green, 29, told the High Court the suggestion was
''absolutely incredible''. The incident was ''ghastly'' and frightening.
''I didn't know it was going to happen until I was seized,'' said Mr
Green, who is seeking damages for mental breakdowns he suffered
allegedly as a result of humiliating bullying during his four months'
Army career at Aldershot barracks officers' mess 10 years ago.
He told Mr Justice Popplewell that incidents in which he was stripped
naked during mess drinking parties were ''completely out of sinc'' with
his upbringing and schooling at Christ's Hospital School in Horsham,
Sussex.
''I had never encountered such bizarre behaviour in such a bizarre
social context. In the mess, the Queen's portrait was watching over
these incidents.
''One moment I am sitting in the dining room toasting the Queen as our
Captain General and the next minute I am strapped bollock naked over the
cannon outside.''
Mr Green, now 29, who was nicknamed ''Ten-Inch'' and claims he was
picked on because of the size of his penis, also denied suggestions by
Mr Richard Ferguson, QC, defending, that the incidents of bullying were
figments of his imagination.
Mr Ferguson, appearing for officers named as defendants in the damages
case, asked why Mr Green had not complained to sympathetic colleagues
about what was happening to him.
Mr Green, who was born in Inverness, said he had tried to ''put a
brave face on it'' and ''it would have been an admission of complete
failure -- ratting on them''.
He was ''rewarded'' for the incidents with words such as: ''You are a
jolly good chap because we can do this to you and you are going to be
one of us.''
Mr Green, now teaching English in Japan where he lives with his
Japanese wife and nine-month-old son, is suing the Ministry of Defence
and 10 named officers for damages for psychological injuries and loss of
career prospects.
The MoD denies failing to maintain adequate discipline and the
individual defendants deny bullying or involvement in any of the alleged
incidents.
Mr Green stressed during cross-examination that he was not anti-Army
and was ''as concerned as anybody'' about the good name of the RHA's 7th
Regiment -- part of the Army's elite Red Beret airborne division --
which he joined after training at Sandhurst.
Asked about one of the named officers, Captain Christopher Lang, who
is now dead and represented by his widow, Mr Green said he was one of
the nicest officers in the mess and certainly not a bully.
''But it was typical that people acted out of character in group
situations under the influence of alcohol,'' he said.
Mr Green, who is legally-aided, said: ''My life has been shattered by
mental illness and I believe that the completely bizarre experiences in
that officers' mess caused me to have a severe first breakdown, the like
of which I have not suffered since.
''I wanted to put my record straight, that I had tried my hardest
within the regiment and had done reasonably well within my professional
commitments.''
The hearing continues.

A FORMER senior officer with Lothian Community Relations Council, who
was the subject of allegations of sexual harassment, yesterday settled a
#350,000 damages action out of court.
Mr Mohammed Akram sued the Commission for Racial Equality, Lothian
Regional Council, and Edinburgh District Council after resigning in May
1987.
The legal saga began after the resignation of a woman member of staff
at the community relations council in 1985. She went to an industrial
tribunal and successfully claimed compensation for unfair dismissal. The
tribunal said the woman had been the subject of ''unlawful sexual
discrimination by Mr Akram which consisted of repeated unwanted
advances''.
In his case at the Court of Session, Mr Akram said he had been forced
to resign or be dismissed because of a threat to withdraw funding from
the council. The cash largely comes from the Commission for Racial
Equality and the regional council.
He went to an industrial tribunal and successfully claimed he had been
unlawfully dismissed.
Mr Akram, of Eildon Terrace, Edinburgh, argued that his employers had
been guilty of a breach of contract and that when his case went to the
tribunal the employers made no attempt to argue that he had been
dismissed because of any alleged conduct involving women employees.
Lord Clyde was due to hear evidence in the case yesterday but the case
was settled on undisclosed terms. Mr Akram's solicitor said there had
been an ''amicable settlement''.

' They all came rushing out in their dressing gowns. It is a violent
shaking. It's the most frightening thing in the world '
Professor Joseph Moran of Stirling University.
SCOTS caught up in the Kobe earthquake have been describing the
devastation to friends and family at home.
The port city has a sizeable Scottish expatriate community, with its
own St Andrews Society and an organisation dedicated to improving
business links between Scotland and Japan.
Six Scottish students, part of a group of nine from Stirling
University, witnessed the fires and devastation caused by the quake from
a hill overlooking one of the worst-affected areas.
The students, four from Glasgow, one from Fife, and one from East
Lothian, arrived in Japan last week for a post-graduate course in Kobe.
They were accompanied by Chihoko Moran, a teaching fellow at Stirling
University and the wife of the university's Professor of Japanese,
Joseph Moran.
Yesterday Professor Moran said his wife had managed to telephone him
briefly to let him know they were all safe shortly after the quake
struck.
''The message was they were all right, but they could see a
considerable number of fires down in Kobe from the hill they were on.
They had no power, no water, and no heat, so they were making do,
cooking their food on the hearth with sticks brought down from the
trees. But they are very much better off than the people below them.''
He said they had been woken from their beds by the jolting of the
earthquake.
''It was about 6am. They all came rushing out in their dressing gowns.
It is a violent shaking. It's the most frightening thing in the world.''
Professor Moran heard from his wife briefly for a second time just to
reassure him that they were bearing up. The group is not expected back
until February 10 and there are no immediate plans to leave sooner.
The students are staying at the Kobe Institute, which is run by St
Catherine's College, Oxford. They are Scots Catriona Macpherson, Sara
Furley, Irene McVey, Anne Kelly, Wai Ling Chan, and Audrey Morrison.
The others on the trip were Lars Jorgensen from Denmark, Che-hsien Lai
from Taiwan, and Torsten Rex from Germany.
Elsewhere across Scotland, frantic relatives were trying to contact
loved ones living or working in Kobe and the surrounding area.
A Bishopbriggs couple, who did not want to be named, said they were
still waiting to hear from their scientist son who has been in the area
for two years. Phone lines to the region were either damaged or clogged
with calls and the Foreign Office was inundated with calls from across
the UK.
Representatives from the Glasgow Junior Chamber of Commerce were also
waiting for news of friends and business associates in Kobe yesterday.
The chamber sent a 30-strong delegation to the city in November to
promote Glasgow and its business opportunities.
They were helped by a 25-year-old Glasgow woman, Mrs Lindsay Nomiyama,
who runs Scottish Consultants in Kobe -- a firm dedicated to improving
business links between the two countries. She lives on the outskirts of
the city with her family, including her Scottish-born mother.
Last night Mrs Nomiyama said she was woken at 5.50am.
''It appeared to be just another earthquake, but a much bigger one,''
she said.
Her house has been designed to withstand quakes and stood firm, with
minimal damage.
Mrs Nomiyama said she had tried to contact fellow Scots in central
Kobe but had been unable to do so. She said her father, a carpenter, had
left to see if he could help.
''It's quite bad over here,'' she said. ''You can't get into the
city.''
Mrs Nomiyama said the expatriate Scots community in the Kobe area were
served by the Kansai St Andrews Society, based in the town centre. The
city even has its own small pipe band.
Across in Kyoto, which was also shaken by the earthquake, 32-year-old
translator Jane Norman, from Culross in Fife, awoke briefly with the
tremor but went straight back to sleep. In the morning her floor was
dotted with powdered plaster from the ceiling.
She learned about the earthquake in a phone call from her worried
mother in Culross, Mrs Chris Norman.
''I heard about the quake on the 9am news and tried to get Jane for
several hours but all lines to Japan were engaged,'' said Mrs Norman.
''I finally got her shortly after noon. By that time I was worried to
death.''
Relief was also written across the face of Mrs Olgamaria Amadei in
Glasgow yesterday as she clutched the fax telling her that her son
Andrew, an architect working in Japan, and his father Stephen, who was
visiting him, were both safe.
Mrs Amadei arrived yesterday morning at the European Language Centre
in Springburn, where she is manager, to be greeted by a message from her
son.
''He must have known how worried I would have been,'' said Mrs Amadei,
who is Italian by birth and works under her maiden name. ''They were due
to go to Osaka tomorrow.''
Her son, architect Andrew Shields, 32, and his father Stephen, who is
retired, had slept through the quake at Andrew's home in Nakano-Ku
outside Tokyo, about an hour from Osaka.
''Since Andrew has been away in Japan for the last two years he has
experienced earthquakes constantly. It seems to be almost a daily
occurrence. They have tremors very frequently,'' said Mrs Amadei.
''He tells me it is quite a scarey experience. All of a sudden the
house starts waving. Even the multi-storeys are built to wave. It is
another matter when they start wavering and cupboards and shelves are
all toppling over. Then it dies off and there is an eerie silence,'' she
added.
Mr Andrew Shields, a graduate of Strathclyde University, was last
night surprised that so many buildings had succumbed to the earthquake.
''What they are saying here is that the earthquake was very close to
the surface so there was a much bigger shock than usual,'' he said.
He was particularly surprised that so many of the motorway structures
had been damaged.
''I have no idea why they should have collapsed so easily. It is a big
shock and a bit frightening. A lot of the structures were old wooden
structures and they would not stand up as well as the modern structures
designed to withstand an earthquake.''
''The Japanese structures are much bigger than ours. Everything is
bigger than it would be here -- the beams and columns are bigger. Also
there are more cross-bracing built within the structure so that they do
not topple over so easily. Once the buildings get really big they go for
a more specialised construction,'' he said.

AN independent authority should be set up to monitor the conduct of
MPs, former Labour deputy leader Roy Hattersley yesterday told the Nolan
inquiry into standards in public life.
Such an authority was ''right in principle and necessary in
practice'', said Mr Hattersley. ''The conduct of MPs is the proper
concern not of the House of Commons alone but for the whole country
which the House of Commons serves.''
His comments came as the Nolan committee of 10 lawyers, academics,
diplomats, and politicians took evidence on the first day of a six-week
investigation, which will hear from around 50 people.
The inquiry was set up in response to a flood of sleaze allegations
against Ministers and Conservative MPs.
Lord Nolan, a Lord Justice of Appeal who heads the committee, said
public cynicism towards MPs who appeared to be using their positions to
make money had reached new heights in recent months.
''There can be no doubt there has been a fall in public confidence. If
changes are needed, we must recommend them without delay, no matter how
drastic they may be,'' he said.
''Many members of the public have written in arguing that being an MP
is a full-time job and no outside interests should be allowed. Most MPs
would disagree, saying that outside interests increased experience.
''But it does seem reasonably clear that a blind eye has been turned
to parliamentary rules.''
The inquiry began in the elevated surroundings of Westminster Central
Hall, which also serves as one of the cathedrals of Methodism, writes
STUART TROTTER, Political Correspondent.
The decorous atmosphere was not matched hours later just across the
road in the Palace of Westminster, when the Prime Minister and a Labour
MP traded insults about whose method of funding their party was the most
corrupt.
Mr John Major was accused by Mr David Winnick (Walsall North - Lab) of
having barred the Nolan inquiry from looking into party funding,
especially, he added, ''the shabby underhand way in which the Tory party
collects a lot of its money''.
Giving knighthoods and peerages as rewards for the highest
subscriptions was a disgraceful way to carry on, he said.
Mr Major replied the disgrace was Labour's dependence on trade union
cash, which gave them direct influence over votes within the party. It
was being seen now in the way in which they were coming to the rescue of
the leadership in the Clause Four debate.
Mr Dale Campbell-Savours (Workington - Lab) complained to the Speaker,
Miss Betty Boothroyd, that while the Department of Trade and Industry
had told him it could not supply him with the number of meetings
Ministers and officials had held with members of the lobbying firm Ian
Greer Associates, the Nolan inquiry had the power to compel an answer.
He asked that MPs, too, should be able to obtain such information.
The Speaker said she would consider the point.
During the inquiry's first day, former Cabinet Minister, Mr Tom King,
admitted there might have been some ''disproportion'' in the party
balance of appointments to quangoes.
Mr Simon Jenkins, a former editor of the Times, said: ''It's okay for
an MP to have another job but for an MP to be a paid-up lobbyist is
outrageous. I believe a distinct line should be drawn.''
He said the packing of quangoes by the wives of Tory MPs had caused
some public disquiet and was something many people found offensive.
Mr Ivor Crewe, professor of politics at Essex Univeristy, said recent
surveys showed 64% of people believed most MPs made a lot of money by
using their position. That figure was 46% nine years ago.
He added: ''The British have always displayed a healthy cynicism of
MPs. They have taken it for granted that most MPs are self-serving
imposters and hypocrites who put party before country and self before
party.''
The constitutional historian Tory peer, Lord Blake, said that,
compared with many financial scandals of the past century, current
allegations ''paled into insignificance''.
However, he suggested the House of Lords should not be exempt from
keeping a register of Members' interests.

MR ROBERT HARRISON, divisional director of the textiles firm
Johnston's of Elgin, should have been in Osaka yesterday morning when
the earthquake devastated the Kansai area.
Instead, his business contacts from Osaka had decided to come to Tokyo
to meet him and he was saved from being caught up in the disaster.
''Ironically, I would have been in Osaka last night, but Osaka came to
me as it were,'' he said.
Speaking from his Tokyo hotel, he described how Japanese people
throughout the city had spent all day watching televisions in shops,
offices, and hotel lobbies as lists of fatalities were screened.
''The Japanese people are quite shocked here in Tokyo. They know there
is a threat of an earthquake, but the reality is somewhat different. The
television pictures of buildings collapsing are quite a lot to take in.
They have always been told that their buildings are earthquake-proof,
but now they are seeing Kobe burning and highways collapsing.
''It is just as well it was not three hours later because the highway
that collapsed would have been packed with cars. Japan is just a traffic
jam and it would have been absolute mayhem,'' said Mr Harrison, who is
making his eighth visit to Japan, his company's biggest export market.
Japanese officials were admitting that the emergency operation had not
worked as well as it should have, he said.
''The gas was supposed to cut off, but people were cooking in the
morning when the earthquake happened and the gas caused fires,'' said Mr
Harrison.
''I do not think they expected a big quake where it happened. They
expected it in the North. They have not had a big quake in the Kansai
area for 50 years.
''This is the biggest one for a long time, but they are still waiting
for 'the big one'. It is meant to be every 60 years and in 1923 they had
a big one so they are overdue,'' he added.
Equally relieved were members of a British mission, organised by the
British Knitting and Clothing Export Council, of 75 British textile
companies, up to 20 of them from Scotland, who were also staying in New
Otani Hotel, Tokyo.
They were planning to travel to Osaka this weekend, but with
communications in chaos, and fears of further after-shock, all plans are
up in the air.
High-speed trains running at up to 250mph are the most popular form of
transport between Osaka and Tokyo. Travellers can commute between the
cities in an hour by train, faster than by air. Last night, however, no
trains were running in the Kansai region, and all aeroplanes were booked
up.
Mr Harrison said that he had never been in Japan in September, the
anniversary of the terrible 1923 earthquake in Tokyo when all Japanese
people undergo annual earthquake training. However, an earthquake guide
in his hotel room advised people to get under a table or something
similar.
''The impression I have got is that the services have not performed as
well as the Japanese expected in a big earthquake. The fires are still
out of control,'' he said.
''The Japanese have always been blase about earthquakes -- now they
have wakened up to the danger.''

<HEADLINE>Dounreay leukemia claims against AEA abandoned</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>8</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980304073</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TWO women who suffered leukemia as children when they lived near the
Dounreay nuclear plant in Caithness have had to drop their legal claims
for compensation against the operators -- the UK Atomic Energy
Authority.
Yesterday, London solicitors Leigh Day and Company, acting for Miss
Mandy McVean, 25, and Miss Sharon Coghill, 23, confirmed that their
civil actions against the authority had been withdrawn, due to lack of
new evidence and legal aid ''difficulties''.
Miss McVean, from Thurso, Caithness, is now a final-year pharmacy
student at The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen. She was 13 when she
contracted the disease and had to undergo three years of painful
treatment.
Miss Coghill, from Murkle, also near Thurso, recently completed a
post-graduate course at Leicester University. She was nine when doctors
diagnosed leukemia in 1980.
Both women claimed that radioactive discharges into the sea and air
from Dounreay had brought on their illnesses.
The pair were among a group of seven youngsters in the so-called
''Dounreay leukemia cluster'' identified by medical experts a decade
ago.
Solicitors had issued a writ claiming damages against the authority on
behalf of Miss Coghill in March 1991. Miss McVean's claim was lodged
eighteen months later.
Miss Susan Wilde, the women's solicitor in the London practice, said
her firm had acted for around 40 claimants against the nuclear industry,
mainly involving British Nuclear Fuels Ltd, which operates the
Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria.
However, two key test-cases against BNFL at Sellafield were lost last
year. Miss Wilde said: ''We had asked for a stay of two years for Mandy
and Sharon's claims to await new scientific findings on the effects of
radiation on bone marrow.
''The court ruled that a case could not be kept open indefinitely, in
the hope that new evidence would emerge.
''As a result, the Legal Aid Board ruled against renewing the money to
fight the girls' claims. I know that they are both very disappointed.''
The women want their cash-claims reviewed in a year's time but Miss
Wilde said the cases could be re-opened ''with some difficulty'' only if
''striking'' new evidence came forward.
Yesterday, Miss Coghill said: ''Despite the legal manoeuvres, I still
believe that my illness was caused by Dounreay's activities.''
She added: ''I still hope my claim can go ahead later because when I
was in hospital in Inverness there were four others with leukemia in
beds near me, and all were from the Thurso area.
''I do not believe for a minute that this was a coincidence.''
A spokesman at Dounreay said yesterday: ''We do not accept that there
is any link between this tragic disease (leukemia) and any environmental
radiation exposure of either of these ladies as a result of Dounreay's
activities.''

BITTER, exhausted, and dazed, the world's latest, and unlikeliest,
refugees huddled in a cold, darkened community centre in this port
devastated by earthquake.
''I lost my stepfather and stepmother,'' said 53-year-old housewife
Kioyoko Terada. ''The entire second floor of our house just fell on to
the ground.''
One by one the survivors of an earthquake that ripped across central
Japan early yesterday drifted into the Watake Community Centre in a Kobe
suburb.
Some chose a corridor, some chose a meeting hall, some just went where
they were told. All were among the 70,000 people, citizens of one of the
richest nations of the world, now homeless in one of its greatest ports.
Through the building's windows, the survivors just saw an occasional
red glow as parts of their city went up in flames.
''My 84-year-old mother is still under the house. We couldn't get her
out,'' sobbed 45-year-old Giako Oki.
Throughout Kobe, in dozens of community centres, schools, gymnasiums
and tents hastily erected in parks, the stories were repeated.
''We have no idea how many people are still trapped in the crushed
houses,'' said a rescue official.
In the eastern Kobe suburb where the community centre is located,
about 350 people died and about the same number were missing.
The tremor toppled buildings and elevated expressways, twisted roads
and derailed trains, and started fires in this historic city.
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama ordered troops into Kobe to help
residents battle the huge fires, some raging unabated because of a lack
of water and fire-fighting equipment.
Troops and firefighting reinforcements from as far away as Tokyo were
trapped in long lines of traffic and unable to get to the fires.
As night fell, rescuers dug into rubble with their hands to search for
more than 1000 missing people, including 20 patients trapped in the
debris of a collapsed Kobe hospital. Kyodo news agency later said most
of the people in the hospital were rescued.
''We are still calling out to people in case they are trapped. But we
are getting fewer and fewer answers,'' the rescue official said.
Unprepared for the disaster, rescue officials have little of the
sophisticated listening equipment required in such circumstances.
''We just keep calling out,'' the official said. ''What else can we
do.''
It is a question also asked by the survivors.
''Where's the water, where's the food. What's going on,'' asked
Terada.
''There was a bang, then the furniture, the ceiling, the wall all
seemed to fall at the same time. I looked up and saw the sky,'' she
remembered.
Shoji Yasui, 63, his wife and two sons were standing on a street
corner in front of their collapsed two-story, 70-year-old house.
''This is nothing compared to what you're going to see down there,''
he said, pointing toward Kobe.
Farther on, a whole block was completely flattened, except for one
wooden wall of a house, still teetering against a utility pole.
People with blank expressions stood around, wrapped in blankets
against the cold.
Another block down, a shop remained standing, but thousands of bottles
lay broken on the floor. Here, too, the burglar alarm was ringing.

SOME NHS trusts use the temporary nature of junior doctors' contracts
as an excuse to avoid dealing with their grievances, a Glasgow
industrial tribunal was told yesterday.
A group of 12 doctors who were employed at the Royal Alexandra
Hospital in Paisley claim they were overworked and underpaid during
their first six-month contract as junior house officers, which ran from
August 1993 to January 1994.
The British Medical Association is backing the test case, which could
see the NHS trust forced to pay out thousands of pounds.
Mr Stephen Smith, a BMA industrial relations officer, told the
tribunal that some trusts took advantage of the turnover of junior
doctors by delaying their response to complaints about working hours and
overtime rates until the complainant left the post, at which point the
complaint was likely to lapse.
Mr Smith said he had been contacted by one of the Paisley doctors
concerned and decided to call a meeting of all the junior doctors
employed at the trust. At the meeting, he said he had found a general
atmosphere of anger and a perception among the junior doctors that they
were inadequately rewarded for the work they were expected to do.
''The junior doctors expressed a degree of shock at the work they had
taken on'', Mr Smith told the tribunal. ''This was . . . the first time
they had taken on the responsibility of medicine . . . They were thrown
into this situation, which is stressful enough to cope with but they
were also faced with excessive hours of work.
''This combination of circumstances was an experience for which
nothing had adequately prepared them.''
The junior house officers, who complete two six-month attachments
before moving up to the grade of senior house officer, claim that
pressures of work had meant they missed out on rest periods and ended up
working too many hours, for which they were paid only 50% or 70% of
their hourly rate.
Mr Smith said that new overtime rates had been adopted by the trust
for medical junior doctors recruited in August 1994, a step he
interpreted as a concession to the arguments put forward by their
predecessors.
These doctors are now paid the same rate fought for by the others.
The cases of four doctors, two who had worked as surgeons and two as
physicians, are currently being heard. Another eight complaints are
being held over.
The four doctors involved in the present hearing, Dr Bruce Elliot, Dr
Rory Melville, Dr Claire Murray, and Dr Valerie Dudgeon, are expected to
give evidence later this week.

LEADING financial services company Scottish Provident has ignored
Government employment policy and granted a paternity leave package to
male staff.
Its decision to offer workers up to 13 weeks' unpaid time off after
the birth of a child is in marked contrast to last year's stance by
Employment Secretary Michael Portillo when Britain refused to accept a
European directive on paternity leave.
Union leaders yesterday hailed the move as a snub for Mr Portillo and
said it proved he had been wrong to describe such an obligation as
damaging to the British economy.
The agreement, between Scottish Provident and the MSF union, will
apply to about 300 male staff, out of a workforce of about 1100 in the
company's life and pensions division. They will be eligible for two
days' paid leave and the option of up to three months' unpaid.
Mr Willie Gibson, regional officer of the MSF, claimed the package set
a precedent in the financial services sector and said the union would
attempt to use it as a springboard for similar agreements with other
companies.
''We were able to convince the company that such an entitlement was
morally justified and the very type of benefit that a family friendly
employer would concede to staff.
''Even though only a relatively small number of workers will take it
up, the principle is very important. Such decent and reasonable
treatment of employees is the catalyst for maintaining good industrial
relations and assists an employer to retain staff.''
Ms Tracy Ashworth-Davies, of Scottish Provident, said: ''We want to
look after fathers in the same way as we look after mothers. We
recognise that new fathers have domestic responsibilities as well and
this should give them some flexibility.''
Last September, every other member state endorsed the EU directive on
employment rights, while Britain opted out. Mr Portillo said then that
fathers should use some of their annual holidays if they wanted time off
after a birth.

AN industrial tribunal in Stornoway hearing an appeal for unfair
dismissal against An Comunn Gaidhealach by its former director adjourned
abruptly in the middle of yesterday's proceedings, amid speculation that
some kind of settlement was being negotiated.
The adjournment came after lunch when Mr Angus MacDonald, solicitor
for Mr Donald MacLean, was due to resume his cross-examination of An
Comunn's president, Mr Donald MacRitchie.
Afterwards, neither party would make any comment. The Herald
understands, however, that a motion had come from An Comunn. The
tribunal is due to reconvene today.
Mr MacLean, who had worked for An Comunn for 16 years, was dismissed
for gross misconduct on March 29 last year, having been suspended on
full pay on January 14, four days after Mr Donald John MacSween had
taken up the new post of chief executive.
Five alleged reasons have been given by Mr MacSween for Mr MacLean's
dismissal. The first related to the purchase of #235 worth of jewellery
and the second to the purchase of an old word processor in An Comunn's
Stornoway office as a present for his daughter. The others covered an
alleged lack of financial control and reporting of the Airdrie Mod and
its fringe programme.
Mr MacSween considered each charge to be gross misconduct and worthy
of dismissal individually. He felt that Mr MacLean's demand to be
reinstated to his former position was out of the question.
The tribunal heard, however, that Mr MacRitchie had, as president,
made a statement in the Stornoway Gazette praising Mr MacLean two months
after Airdrie, at the time of Mr MacSween's appointment. Mr MacRitchie
referred to the ''almost intolerable pressures'' that had been on Mr
MacLean after the departure of an assistant director, who had run the
National Mod previously. It had been to Mr MacLean's ''eternal credit
that he had coped with the pressure'' and had managed to organise
successful Mods.
Mr MacRitchie told An Comunn's solicitor, Mr David Walker, that he had
made that statement before chartered accountants had conducted an
independent audit of the Airdrie Mod.
Mr MacRitchie also said that, before Mr MacLean's suspension, he had
been offered a new job as Gaelic arts director, at a higher salary. Mr
MacLean had said he would have been delighted to get rid of his
administrative duties but had made several conditions which had not been
acceptable to An Comunn.

GOVERNMENT plans to privatise safety inspections of roll-on roll-off
ferries have been temporarily shelved to avoid public criticism after
the Estonia disaster, according to a leaked letter.
The delay was referred to in a confidential Cabinet-level letter
allegedly written in December by Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney and
disclosed by a union leader for marine surveyors.
Dr Mawhinney allegedly said that transferring all ship survey and
certification work to the private sector so soon after the Estonia
sinking in the Baltic in September last year, which left 900 people
dead, would lead to a public outcry.
In the letter to the Minister for Open Government, Mr David Hunt, Dr
Mawhinney wrote: ''In the aftermath of the Estonia I have decided that
to implement this delegation for ro-ro ferries at the present would
expose the Government to criticism.''
He said responsibility for hull and machinery surveys of these ships
should temporarily remain with the Marine Safety Authority (MSA).
''I do not consider that we can take the option of delegating ro-ro
ferry surveys and increasing MSA's over-sight of those undertaking
them,'' the Transport Secretary continued.
''(I do not) believe that such an approach would allow us to avoid
public criticism given the reaction to the Estonia. I regard this as a
short-term postponement.''
Dr Mawhinney said he expected draft regulations covering ship safety
would be laid early this year with a ''low-key press notice giving
reasons for the postponement of delegation of hull and machinery surveys
on ro-ro passenger ships''.
Mr John Higgins, national officer for the Institution of
Professionals, Managers and Specialists (IPMS), who represent marine
surveyors at the MSA, said: ''Mawhinney's letter is cold, cynical and
astounding.
''It proves that commercial considerations outweigh safety in this
Government's list of priorities.''
Shadow Minister for Shipping, Ms Joan Walley, said: ''The document
shows that . . . behind the responsible public face there is a cynical
manipulation of public opinion.''
The Department of Transport refused to comment on the contents of the
letter.
A spokesman said: ''We are delaying delegation to classification
societies of hull and machinery inspections for ro-ro ferries until we
know the outcome of the International Maritime Organisation's panel of
experts on ferry safety which was set up after the Estonia disaster.''

JOHN MAJOR left the Commons Chamber yesterday to the unusual sound of
enthusiastic cheers and cries of ''more, more,'' from his own side. The
''feel-good'' factor had apparently arrived on his own side of the
House.
If it had, it is a hardy sort of factor able to exist in political
climates in which the party languishes 40 opinion poll points behind the
Opposition.
It could hardly have been produced by the rather bizarre re-launch
attempted by Mr Major the day before, which achieved the impact of a
damp squib. Labour has helped by suddenly making mistakes on education,
railways, Clause 4 and even devolution.
The second important factor is that the Tory benches have apparently
taken the advice of the much mocked -- because leaked -- Maples
Memorandum of the Tory deputy chairman, and hitting back at Labour on a
level higher than simple abuse.
Mr Paul Marland reminded the House that it was Labour, who probably
believes it has the animal lovers' vote sewn up, who, when in Government
in 1975, lifted the ban imposed by the Tories on the export of live
animals. ''Oh,'' chorused his chums and a certain amount of shuffling
went on on the Labour benches.
Mr Henry Bellingham pointed out that the successful bus company, West
Midlands Travel is to be floated on the stock exchange and the former
Labour Transport spokesman, Mr Peter Snape (West Bromwich East), who is
one of the directors, should do very nicely out of the floatation.
''It's obviously better to be a former Labour Transport spokesman than
a present one,'' replied Mr Major achieving for once delicate irony at
the expense of Labour's somewhat confused stance on what it would do
with the railways.
He had not actually started very well responding to Mr David Winnick
(Walsall North) about the iniquities of Tory Party funding with a few of
his own on the iniquities of Labour Party funding. His use of the old
saw ''He who pays the piper calls the tune'' will certainly rebound on
him the next time an unsavoury Tory benefactor is uncovered.
Sir Peter Tapsell, one of the few reamining patrician Tories who gives
the impression of conferring a favour by asking a question even of Prime
Ministers, praised Mr Major for his recent pledge to give up no more UK
sovereignty to the EU and compared this with Mr Blair's remarks in
Brussels when he seemed prepared to give up much of the little that is
left.
Again with an unusual lightness of touch, Mr Major responded that he
had been surprised at what Mr Blair had said about giving more powers to
the European Parliament ''in view of the low opinion he recently
expressed of some members of it.'' This neat reference to Bambi's spat
with some of his less respectful MEPs went down well on the Tory side
and went home on the Labour one.
Mr Major would achieve something like the combined plots of Rocky I,
II and III, if, after taking the mother and father of a hiding for over
half the contest he can pick himself up off the floor and, despite
giving away 40% on the scales, throw a knock-out punch some time in '96
or '97. Perhaps if in addition to Mr Maples the Tories hire Sylvester
Stallone's scriptwriter, he might just manage it.

<HEADLINE>Falkirk FC cashier fined for defrauding club of #3000</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>980304088</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FORMER Falkirk FC cashier Paul Deans was fined #750 yesterday for
defrauded the club of #3000 to spend on his girlfriend.
Deans, 24, of Highcross Avenue, Melrose, admitted the charge at
Falkirk Sheriff Court.
His father, Hamish, the club's former chairman, and his brother,
George, the ex-vice chairman, were cleared of embezzling #7200 from the
club after a nine-day trial.
However, Hamish Deans, 55, of Bannerfield House, Selkirk, the managing
director of Scottish Borders Abattoirs, was fined #200 after being found
guilty of defrauding the Meat and Livestock Commission of #73 over
flight tickets to attend a meeeting at its Milton Keynes headquarters.
Depute procurator-fiscal Petra Collins told the court that police
launched an investigation after they received a telephone call alleging
that Paul Deans was spending a lot of money, which he had embezzled from
Brockville, on his girlfriend.
Ms Collins said that between February, 1991, and his resignation in
April, 1992, Paul Deans, now a part-time music teacher and cinema
projectionist, took cash in ''dribs and drabs'' from the club's cash
float for home games.
Police found that his bank account revealed that he had used #1550 of
the club's cash to pay for the insurance on his girlfriend's car.
Paul Deans's lawyer, Mr Alistair Duff, said: ''He always intended to
pay the money back but he allowed the sums of money to get out of
hand.''
Sheriff John MacDonald said he noted that the money had been paid back
by Hamish Deans but he told Paul Deans: ''You were in a position of
trust.''
The sheriff cleared Hamish Deans and his other son, George, 27, a
Lauder butcher, of seven embezzlement charges.
They included obtaining Access cards for club business from the
Clydesdale Bank without holding a legally required board meeting for
authority, and using club cash to repair a house in Lauder, owned by
Hamish Deans, which the club then let to Paul Deans.
It was also alleged Falkirk FC paid for publicity pictures of Hamish
Deans and his wife after he was appointed chairman and for a mobile
phone for Mr George Deans's car.
Mr Duff told the court that Hamish Deans and his wife had been the
victims of a hate campaign at the club's Brockville ground, with
poison-pen letters being sent to their home.
Outside the court, Mr Duff said Hamish Deans and Mr George Deans were
''delighted'' at the verdicts, adding: ''The sheriff made it clear that
their dealings with Falkirk FC were perfectly proper.''
The trial had heard an independent audit of the club's books had
revealed a shortage of #30,000. When professional fees and interest were
added, it came to around #70,000.
Hamish Deans told the court he had made up the missing money because
he felt that, as chairman, he was responsible for the running of the
club. He added that he also wanted to defend his son, Paul.
Hamish Deans and Mr George Deans sold their 57% controlling stake in
Falkirk to Mr George Fulston last year.

A GOVERNMENT-appointed regulator yesterday sought to put the
Government's struggling rail privatisation programme back on track by
reducing charges to train operators by about #1.5 billion over the next
six years.
The lower charges -- down nearly 14% -- for access to the
infrastructure, including lines, signals, and stations, are aimed at
tempting more private companies to bid for passenger rail franchises.
However, the Government in turn will be able to scale down its subsidy
payments to the train operators -- including ScotRail, which already has
warned that it will be run down if Treasury demands for budget cuts are
to be met.
Opposition MPs will now seek clarification of the Government's
intention on subsidies to ensure train operators and passengers obtain
real benefits from Rail Regulator John Swift's ruling.
Mr Swift moved after the 25 operating companies complained the charges
were too high, and argued Railtrack should share more of the risks with
them in the event of falling revenue.
Labour MPs had also protested at soaring access charges since the
Government allegedly raised the real cost of railway assets to get a
better return from Railtrack's sell-off, due before the next election.
Ministers had wanted a 5.1% return from Railtrack, rising to 8% in two
years' time, and the infrastructure was valued at replacement cost --
which, overnight, pushed its notional worth up from about #3 billion to
#6.5 billion.
Mr Swift -- announcing the cut in train operators' payments to
Railtrack -- said he wanted to achieve ''a better balance of advantage
between all the parties operating in the new railway market''.
At present, shadow franchises pay #2.18 billion a year to Railtrack.
However, Mr Swift said access charges will be re-based in 1995-96 to a
level on average 8% lower in real terms than last year.
He added that in the five years from 1996-97, the charges will fall by
2% a year in real terms -- giving total savings to train operators of
#1.5 billion over six years.
Mr Swift said everyone, including rail users, would benefit from his
new package, and Transport Secretary Brian Mahinney described it as good
news for passengers and taxpayers.
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher said the new charges showed
the Government was ''hellbent on selling franchises and showing little
concern for passengers''.
However, another Labour Transport spokesman Mr Henry McLeish said they
were another nail in the coffin for rail privatisation because
Railtrack's income was being cut.
Mr McLeish questioned who would buy shares in a company whose future
income was being cut by such huge amounts, and added: ''The whole
sell-off is now a shambles.''
Sir Russell Johnston, the Liberal Democrat Transport spokesman, said:
''The Government must not use this price reduction as an excuse to cut
rail subsidies even further. If they do, no benefit will be passed on to
passengers.''
A spokesman for ScotRail, which currently pays #173m a year to
Railtrack, said the prospect of cuts over six years was ''very welcome
news.'' However, it was too early to say if threats of dearer fares,
staff cuts, and fewer trains, would disappear.
Mr John Boyle, director of corporate affairs, said the Government's
financial limits for British Rail, including ScotRail, are not yet
known. So far ScotRail has been told to reduce annual operating costs by
at least 5% from April.
A Railtrack spokesman in Scotland said the revised charges set by the
regulator mean ''we have a hard job ahead.''
* A railway pressure group -- Friends of the West Highland Lines --
has urged Highlands and Islands Enterprise to help retain rail services
to Oban, Fort William, and Mallaig, possibly by funding the purchase of
coaches for use by ScotRail.

<RECORDNO>980304090</RECORDNO>

THE Royal Navy last night announced three new major safety measures to
help prevent a repeat of the Antares trawler sinking by a British
submarine in 1990.
The move, as predicted exclusively by The Herald on December 27,
involves stringent tightening of the existing Subfacts guidelines for
all RN and allied submarines operating in the crowded fishing grounds
off the UK coast.
In future, a frigate or destroyer will be dedicated as guardship on
exercises involving submarines and surface units. Its crew will act as
electronic and communications go-betweens for the military and the
fishermen in the area.
All submarine officers are also to be ordered to come to periscope
depth immediately if they have an incomplete sonar picture or are in any
doubt as to the whereabouts of trawlers nearby. The only exception would
be submarines on active or clandestine missions.
Despite sophisticated sonars and other sensors, it is not always
possible for a submerged submarine to detect the presence of a
stationary or slow-moving fishing boat if warships are moving in the
same sector and using their own sonars.
The radar picture on the submarine's screens can be swamped by
powerful returns, rendering the trawlers virtually invisible.
The third move, an important administrative advance, is the pending
appointment of Lieutenant-Commander David Pollitt as fishing liaison
officer to the permanent staff of Flag Officer Submarines, the commander
of all UK nuclear boats.
Lieutenant-Commander Pollitt, formerly based at Faslane on the Clyde,
is Staff Warfare Officer (Navigation) at naval headquarters at
Northwood, near London.
The Royal Navy, the Clyde Fishermen's Association, and the Department
of Transport have been in consultation and frequently at loggerheads
since HMS Trenchant, a nuclear-powered hunter-killer, accidentally
snagged the nets of the Carradale trawler Antares in November, 1990, and
dragged her down in the Sound of Bute. Four crewmen died.
Submariners at Faslane have worked particularly closely with the local
fishermen to avoid further tragedy since then.
However, despite a joint code of practice which required all British
and allied submarines operating in UK inshore waters to maintain a gap
of at least 4000 yards from the nearest fishing vessel when submerged
and 1500 yards at periscope depth, there have been near-miss incidents
over the last four years.
In the first of the two most significant, the nets of the Irish
trawler Lupina C were snagged by the nuclear attack boat USS Sturgeon
halfway between Northern Ireland and Scotland in September, 1992.
The Lupina C limped back to her home port of Kilkeel with her gear in
tatters. The Pentagon later paid compensation and disciplined the
officer of the watch, admitting that the submarine's crew had been
''less than prudent''.
The second involved the tangling of the nets of the Sutherland trawler
Audacious by the towed array sonar of the RN nuclear attack boat HMS
Valiant in November, 1993.
The towed array is a thick plastic cable packed with sound sensors
which is streamed behind a submerged submarine when it wishes to remain
''passive'' by not using its own pinging sonar and still build up a
picture of naval traffic around it.
The Navy argued that the array was not part of the submarine itself
and the fact that it snagged only a few hundred yards from the trawler
did not constitute a safety risk. However, to deploy it, the Valiant was
already in breach of RN guidelines.
Mr Patrick Stewart, secretary of the 135-boat Clyde Fishermen's
Association, and a tireless campaigner for reform, said last night: ''We
welcome the Navy's genuine moves to improve safety. It has been a long
haul and, at one stage, we thought the only means of achieving change
would be a repeat of the Antares tragedy.
''We met representatives of the Admiralty and the DoT as Faslane
yesterday as part of the on-going work of the fishing industry safety
liaison sub-committee. The Navy announced its intentions to implement
these undoubted improvements to the existing code of practice.
''But we are not complacent. The only truly effective safeguard
against a future accident would be a complete separation of submarine
and fishing activity.''
A Royal Navy spokesman said: ''We are committed to maximum safety
within operational and training requirements. The moves announced today
are a major step forward.''

DOCTORS in Dundee are battling to save the life of a 50-year-old man
who has fallen victim to the necrotising fasciitis bug after a routine
operation.
The man, from a village in North-east Fife, was admitted to Ninewells
Hospital in Dundee at the beginning of last month for a hernia
operation.
The operation went smoothly but days after his release the man was
taken back to hospital with a serious wound infection quickly diagnosed
as the ''flesh-eating'' bug.
In a series of emergency operations, surgeons removed infected flesh
from the man's stomach and legs. Doses of antibiotics have been
adiministered in a bid to counter the infection. However, the patient
remains critically ill on a life-support machine.
A spokesman for Ninewells Hospital confirmed a patient was being
treated for the disease but declined to give any further details.
The Dundee case is the third to hit Scotland in recent weeks. Miss
Elizabeth Sutherland, 71, from Bothkennar, near Grangemouth, and the
sister of former Beirut hostage Mr Tom Sutherland, died in Royal
Infirmary, Glasgow at the weekend.
Alan Mitchell, 10, from Rutherglen died at Yorkhill Hospital days
earlier.

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson yesterday called on the
Scottish Office to do more for the victims of the floods in Strathclyde,
following a high-level meeting in London.
Mr Robertson and the Labour MPs whose constituencies were worst
affected met Scottish Secretary Ian Lang and top civil servants to
discuss flood relief.
He said Mr Lang's presence was ''a welcome sign that the Scottish
Office is taking the flood situation seriously at last''.
However, he added: ''Ministers are still passing the buck to local
councils.
Mr Robertson welcomed the Scottish Office's annoucement on Monday of
funding for a study into the causes of floods in the West of Scotland
''as a positive step forward which shows that Ministers are now at least
listening to the cries of help.
''Nevertheless, the full cost of the floods is still not yet known and
we will be asking for further meetings once this becomes clear.''
The Scottish Office described the talks as useful and conciliatory.

TORY rebels and Ulster Unionists could defeat the Government tonight
on the crucial issue of allowing the Spanish fishing fleet into waters
traditionally fished by the British and Irish. The Prime Minister faces
another setback in his attempt to re-establish his authority.
Last night at Westminster, the nine Tory rebels off the Whip agreed
that they will abstain in the vote tonight on the Labour motion which
requires the Government to renegotiate a deal already done in Brussels
to allow the Spanish fleet into into the Irish Box waters.
Ulster Unionists are expected to take the same view -- so the
Government faces a technical defeat on a procedural motion. It will not
force Mr Major to renegotiate a fisheries deal already struck by his
Ministers in Brussels, but defeat would be a setback for his desire to
reunite his party.
Despite the odds stacking up against him last night, Mr Major still
could succeed tonight because there is a #20m bait being dangled before
three West of England Tory MPs.
This is the money that could be dedicated to compensating fishermen in
the South-west of England. The Prime Minister will have a meeting with
these three Tory MPs tonight before the vote in an attempt to gain their
support.
Yesterday, the Ulster Unionists, anxious to exert their authority in
the coming negotiations over the future of Northern Ireland, were
holding out for more concessions from the Government.
Frantic efforts were being made by Tory Whips last night to persuade
the nine Unionists not to confuse Northern Ireland matters with the
fishing crisis.
The late-night vote will be touch and go. British and Irish fishermen
are angry over the deal to let in the huge Spanish fleet.
The Tory Euro-sceptics are set to use this issue to try to maintain
their influence on Mr Major's European policy. The Government's stance
tonight will be that the deal done in Brussels cannot be renegotiated
and that Labour's challenge falls short of demanding that Britain should
abandon the European Common Fisheries Policy.
A Government defeat on a procedural Labour Party motion does not mean
the downfall of Mr Major.
One of the rebels who will abstain, Mr Michael Carttiss (Great
Yarmouth), said: ''The whole debate is a futile exercise. There is
nothing the British Parliament can do to prevent the appalling decision
to allow the Spanish and Portuguese into UK waters.''
LABOUR has a commanding 31% lead over the Tories, according a new
opinion poll. The ICM poll for the Guardian gives Labour 56%, compared
with 25% for the Conservatives and 15% for the Liberal Democrats.
That marks a 5% rise in the Labour lead since an ICM poll at the
beginning of December when Labour had 53%, the Conservatives 27% and the
Liberal Democrats 16%.

DETECTIVES are questioning three men and two women about bomb attacks
last year on the Israeli Embassy in London and a Jewish charity.
It is believed they were arrested at five different addresses in
London. One woman is said to be in her 50s, while the other is aged 29.
The three men are in their 20s and described as businessmen. All five
are Middle Eastern in origin but are thought to have been living in the
UK for some time.
Officers from the Anti-Terrorist Branch made the arrests after
''intensive investigations''. Police are believed to have been working
in co-operation with inquiries in the United States, Israel, and
Argentina -- where 90 people were killed on July 18 at the Israeli
centre in Buenos Aires.
The five arrests in London come almost six months after a car bomb
badly damaged the Israeli Embassy in Kensington on July 26. Fourteen
people were injured. Six people were injured in a second explosion at a
charity in Finchley hours later.
Before the Kensington bombing, a woman in expensive clothes and
carrying a Harrods bag got out of a car. She was challenged by police
but said she was visiting friends next door to the embassy. As officers
began to run a registration check on the car, the bomb in it exploded.

CUSTOMS officers ruffled some unexpected feathers yesterday when they
raided a Ukrainian cargo ship berthed on the Clyde.
The Flexible Anti-Smuggling Team (Fast) officers boarded the Anton
Makarenko in the King George V Docks in Glasgow at midday looking for
drugs but found 19 rare cockatoos, worth #100,000.
The ship had arrived in the city at the weekend from Malaysia, near
the opium-producing sector known as the Golden Triangle on the Thailand,
Burma, and Laos borders.
While it failed to uncover any drugs, the Fast team was surprised to
find the birds being given the run of the vessel.
Mr Iain Matheson, a Customs spokesman, said: ''We had gone on board
the Anton Makarenko for a routine rummage, looking for drugs or anything
untoward. Coming from the South China Sea, the boat would be a prime
target for drugs.
''However, we found no drugs but did seize the 19 rare birds. Two are
class 1 endangered species and worth #10,000 each. The other 17 birds
are class 2 threatened species. The total value of all the birds is in
the region of #100,000.
''It is prohibited to export them from Malaysia just as it is
prohibited to bring them into Scotland.''
The Fast team of six, which is based at Paisley, found the birds in
some distress. Mr Matheson said they had not been caged and had been
given free range on the boat, presumably to camouflage who was
responsible for them. ''They must have been prepared for people coming
on board,'' he added.
The Fast team eventually caught all the birds and took them to Glasgow
Airport where they were put in the British Airways cargo hanger to await
a flight to London. They will be given a health check and put into
quarantine at London Zoo.
Mr Matheson said officers had interviewed the crew but had had
difficulty with interpretation. He said: ''No charges will be laid
against the crew because a chain of evidence is difficult to establish.
We are leaving them to get back to the Ukraine.''
Last night, the birds were flown to London free of charge by BA on a
Boeing 737 shuttle. A BA spokesman said: ''We are just happy to work
with the Customs to get the birds into quarantine in London.''

Grozny, Tuesday
CHECHEN officials said today that they had agreed in principle with
Russia to halt the fighting in Chechnya from tomorrow night, but Moscow
did not confirm any ceasefire and kept up its tough talk.
In the Chechen capital Grozny, Russian gunners continued to pour
shells onto the city this afternoon and warplanes made at least two
rocket strikes as Russia pressed on with efforts to smash Chechnya's
drive for independence.
Chechen fighters still held the presidential palace, the battered
fire-scorched symbol of Chechen resistance.
Interfax news agency reported that about 1160 Russian servicemen had
been killed so far in the Chechnya conflict, three times greater than
the previous official tally, and increasing pressure on the Kremlin to
end the war either by a quick military victory or by negotiations.
Signs of movement on talks emerged when Chechen Justice Minister Usman
Imayev said after meeting Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
that agreement had been reached in principle on a ceasefire.
''An agreement has been reached on stopping the bloodshed on the basis
of halting military actions,'' Imayev told reporters after talks in
Moscow. ''It is possible to say that shooting will stop from tomorrow
(Wednesday) evening.''
However, official Russan reports made no mention of any ceasefire and
said Chernomyrdin had given Chechnya's separatist leader, Dzhokhar
Dudayev, a last chance to order his fighting units to end resistance to
Moscow.
''V. Chernomyrdin underlined that Dudayev and his circle have a last
chance to prove their willingness to stop more bloodshed and show their
real ability to control the situation,'' said the statement.
A Government source said Chernomyrdin, who proposed a truce yesterday,
had told the Chechens they must stop shooting first to prove their
goodwill and the Russians could then follow suit.
Vast differences between the two sides had prevented any meaningful
talks since the first week of the conflict, which erupted after Russian
President Boris Yeltsin sent troops to the tiny southern region on
December 11.
A 48-hour ceasefire called by Russia last week was quickly shattered
and fighting then worsened between Chechen irregulars and Russian troops
assaulting Grozny.
Today a MiG jet swooped out of the clouds and fired two rockets in the
direction of the presidential building. It was not clear if they hit
their target.
Russian news agencies said Russian forces were sweeping areas of the
north and north-east of the embattled city, where snow was falling, to
root out independence fighters.
In other action, a key route leading east into neighbouring Dagestan
was partially closed when two explosions during the night wrecked a
river road bridge and damaged a railway bridge. It was not clear who was
behind these attacks.
In spite of the relentless shelling, fighting in the city seemed less
intense today. Transport Union Hospital, which had been treating 12 to
15 war wounded per day, had only tended three casualties, injured by
shrapnel, by midday.
Interfax, quoting sources at Mozdok air base from where the Russian
campaign is being co-ordinated, said 1160 bodies had been airlifted out
of Mozdok aboard ''black tulips'' -- a grim Russian nickname for
helicopters carrying coffins of war dead.
The fighting and casualties have compromised Yeltsin's democratic
credentials in the eyes of Western allies and cost him the support of
many liberal politicians at home.
The crisis overshadowed two days of scheduled talks in Geneva between
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister
Andrei Kozyrev.
Before leaving Washington for Geneva, Christopher indicated support
for Chernomyrdin's ceasefire call but said he intended to urge Kozyrev
to try to end the fighting as soon as possible.
On arrival in Geneva, however, Kozyrev signalled his backing for the
official line that the conflict was an internal affair.
In the United States, intelligence officials said Yeltsin appeared to
be fully in charge in Moscow but added that he may have to oust top
officials, including Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, because of the
Chechnya crisis.
''One might perhaps project that the major power brokers may have to
be sacrificed,'' acting CIA Director William Studeman said in
Washington.
Studeman said the officials who might be ousted included Grachev and
others such as Interior Minister Viktor Yerin.--Reuter.

Rome, Tuesday
ITALY'S new Prime Minister, Lamberto Dini, formed a government of
non-partisan technocrats today but immediately ran into opposition from
media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance.
Cesare Previti, national co-ordinator of Berlusconi's Forza Italia
party, said Dini's government was unacceptable and would not have the
support of the Alliance.
''We will not give the Dini government our confidence,'' Previti told
a news conference attended by senior members of allied parties including
the hard-right National Alliance.
Previti said that Berlusconi, the outgoing Prime Minister, had tried
in vain to win a promise from President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro that early
General Elections would be held.
Dini was dealt a blow only minutes beforehand when the man he chose to
head the Foreign Trade Ministry declined the job.
Gaetano Rasi told reporters that he would ''without a doubt'' refuse
to take up the post, adding that Antonio Marzano, Dini's choice for
Transport Minister, would also refuse.
The leader of the right-wing National Alliance, Gianfranco Fini,
called on Dini to resign even if his government won the parliamentary
vote of confidence it needs to take office.
''The Dini government amounts to putting politics into receivership,''
said Fini. ''Even if the government wins the confidence vote, I hope he
will respect his conscience and resign.''
Scalfaro asked Dini to form a government last Friday to replace
Berlusconi's, which resigned on December 22 after the Northern League
walked out of the coalition.
Dini set out a narrow programme of political and institutional reform
for his government, which was to stand above the political
fray.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Royal Mail defies tribunal and refuses to reinstate sacked island postwoman</HEADLINE>

THE refusal by Royal Mail to accept an industrial tribunal's ruling
and reinstate a dismissed postwoman is making waves far beyond her
remote round in Orkney.
Mrs Vivienne Wilson had delivered mail to the 550 islanders of Sanday
for 11 years until she was sacked in August 1993 for delivering
unstamped invoices for her husband, a builder.
She did not deny the charge but pointed out that the bills did not
enter the Royal Mail system. By the nature of island life, she merely
dropped them off on her rounds, just as she did pensions, prescriptions,
milk, newspapers, groceries, and the occasional bag of cement.
The Union of Communications Workers argued her case at an industrial
tribunal last November. It said that rural services and remote islands
posed specific problems and if every rule was applied rigidly the
service would collapse.
In its 22-page ruling, the tribunal criticised Royal Mail's handling
of the case. There was a unanimous recommendation that Mrs Wilson, 37,
be reinstated by Monday of this week. An award of #12,716 in
compensation for lost earnings was also made.
Royal Mail has since decided that taking Mrs Wilson back could cause
friction at the island's small postal office. The decision was reached
although the personnel department could not offer the union any
''principled objection''.
Mr George Robertson, the UCW's Scottish representative, described the
decision as unbelievable. He said that Mrs Wilson, a mother of four,
should not have been sacked in the first place. ''Now that she finally
has received fair treatment from the tribunal, Royal Mail have taken no
heed. They are guilty of appalling injustice.''
Mrs Wilson's case will now be taken up by the union nationally, with
general secretary Alan Johnson raising it at board level if necessary.
If that fails, the union's only option is to return to the industrial
tribunal which, while it cannot order Royal Mail to reinstate Mrs
Wilson, can insist on additional compensation payments up to a maximum
of #11,000.
A spokesman for Royal Mail said that, after reading the written
findings of the tribunal, it had decided not to reinstate Mrs Wilson
because the necessary working relationship between management and
employee could not be restored.
Standards needed to be maintained by all Royal Mail employees,
particularly in remote areas where supervision was minimal. He added
that Royal Mail would be asking the tribunal to reconsider its
reinstatement order.

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Homes and Aberdeen District Council are planning a #24m
investment in a housing strategy which should provide nearly 1000 new
homes in the city over the next three years.
Every #1 the public sector is providing in Aberdeen at present is
being matched by the private sector, three times as much as the national
average, and it is expected that more than #40m will be invested to
build 950 new homes.
The two groups which signed a joint strategic agreement four years ago
have reviewed their support to it and are to work together to ''widen
housing choice and improve quality in Aberdeen by maximising public and
private sector housing and targetting resources to agreed priority
client groups and locations''.
Mr Peter McKinlay, chief executive of Scottish Homes, said he believed
such joint agreements were absolutely crucial to the improvement of
housing conditions and to secure private sector investment. Housing
could not be considered in a vacuum.
''I think the resurgence of the city centre of Aberdeen over the last
five years provides hard evidence that economic success can be built
alongside and on the back of housing investment.''
The investment strategy will focus on the housing element of care in
the community, increasing the supply of affordable homes for rent or
sale, particularly for those on low or modest incomes.
Mr Stuart Nichol, Scottish Homes district manager for Highlands,
Islands, and Grampian, said: ''What we are seeking to do is to identify
the specific needs of the person, to find out where they have come from
and where they need to return to, and to try and get our investment
targetted to the needs of the people and not the perceived need.''
Other initiatives on which significant steps forward are expected in
the next few months are the creation of a single housing waiting list in
Aberdeen for all agencies, to avoid duplication and give a clear idea of
the numbers seeking housing and the type they require, and the opening
of a home options shop, which would be the first of its kind in Scotland
and would provide information from all housing agencies.

Reykjavik, Tuesday,
RESCUERS dug out two more survivors from the snow a day after an
avalanche smashed into a remote Icelandic fishing village.
Last night rescuers found a 14-year-old girl buried in the snow but
still alive, and early today they discovered a male survivor.
Tonight rescue officials announced the final casualty count of 14,
several of whom were children believed to have been still in their beds
when thousands of tons of snow hit the north-western village of Sudavik
before dawn yesterday.
Despite a fierce storm and the risk of more avalanches, a search
continued today for those still missing. A total of 12 survivors were
dug out and the bodies of nine people, including children, have been
recovered.
A mother, who was sleeping with her three children when their house
was hit, was saved. However her two-year-old son died shortly after
rescuers found him, and her seven-year-old daughter and four-year-old
son were believed to be among the dead.
Rescue efforts were hampered by another avalanche, which hit the
village last night damaging several houses, but no further injuries were
reported.
The region, which suffers the severest conditions in the country's
harsh winters, was declared a danger zone because of the threat of more
avalanches.
Emergency teams were forced to use boats to reach the village because
roads were closed by blizzards.--Reuter.

THE Scottish thriller, Shallow Grave, and the BBC Scotland Tartan
Short, Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life, have been selected for the
Sundance Film Festival in America, the international movie industry's
shop window for independent films.
They are the first Scottish films to be chosen for the prestigous
festival which starts in Salt Lake City, Utah, tomorrow. Their selection
represents a golden opportunity for Hollywood success. In recent years,
Sundance has been the launch-pad for surprise blockbusters like
Reservoir Dogs and Four Weddings and a Funeral.
The Scottish films succeeded where hundreds of others from all over
the world failed. Competition for entry into the festival is cut-throat.
For Shallow Grave, critically acclaimed in Britain and a massive box
office success, it is the logical next step for international
recognition.
The movie, which was financed partly by the Glasgow Film Fund and
developed by the Scottish Film Production Fund, will be screened to an
audience of American critics and studio executives on January 27. If, as
expected, it is well received, it will almost certainly be snapped up
for a major US distribution deal.
Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life, which was directed by the Scots
actor Peter Capaldi and was one of BBC Scotland's first batch of Tartan
Shorts in 1993, has already won six major awards including a Bafta Best
Short Film Award. It is one of only six non-US shorts to be selected for
the Sundance programme.
Mr Eddie Dick, director of the Scottish Film Production Fund, said:
''To have broken into the premier independent film festival in the
States with two films is very encouraging. The success of both these
films underlines the successful development work of the SFPF and the
production initiative of the Glasgow Film Fund.''
Mr Colin Cameron, head of television at BBC Scotland, said: ''I'm
delighted that the talents of Scottish film making are now getting the
international platform they deserve.''
Actor Robert Redford, founder and president of the Sundance Festival,
said: ''It is our focus and the commitment to independent film, in all
its scope and variety, that make the festival unique.''
* Shallow Grave continued to break box office records in London at the
weekend. It increased its audience share by 10% over the previous
weekend, grossing #437,094 during its first 10 days.

A YOUTH worker took pictures of naked boys after plying them with
alcohol at a club he had set up, a court heard yesterday.
David Porter, 38, a former Boys' Brigade officer from Kilmacolm,
admitted at Paisley Sheriff Court conducting himself in an indecent
manner towards 23 boys aged between 11 and 14.
He also encouraged the boys to take pictures of each other and
blackmailed them, warning them not to tell anyone or he would pin the
photographs on a school noticeboard or in the playground.
Porter, from Renfrewshire, pleaded guilty to conducting himself in an
indecent manner at various addresses in Argyll and Renfrewshire between
1985 and 1993 by taking or causing photographs of an indecent manner to
be taken of 23 boys. He has still been running the club in spite of the
charges.
Last year, a teacher called police to say he had heard pupils talking
about boys who had been given alcohol and asked to pose naked for
pictures.
On being questioned by police while driving a van, Porter showed them
20 photographs kept in envelopes inside the vehicle. He claimed most of
the older boys ''liked a drink'' and rather than see them congregating
on street corners he would let them have a drink when they went away
with him.
Sheriff Colin Mackay warned Porter he could face a prison sentence and
told him not to have any further contact with the club or its members.
The case was continued for a social report and community service
assessment. He was not detained in custody.
The court was told of concerns by the procurator-fiscal's office over
letters sent by Porter to the homes of the boys involved. In the letter,
he pleaded for forgiveness and added: ''Please keep this letter to
yourself as it is a personal apology to you.''

A SENIOR surgeon told a fatal accident inquiry yesterday how an
elderly patient died on a night when Glasgow's hospitals did not have a
single intensive care bed available.
Mr John Pollock, head of vascular surgery at Glasgow Royal Infirmary,
said the lack of such beds was a ''highly significant'' factor in the
death of the pensioner, and he was ''incensed'' at the situation.
He was giving evidence at the inquiry into the death of Mr John
McGowan, 67, of Prosen Street, Tollcross, Glasgow, who died during
surgery at the Royal in January last year.
Mr McGowan had been suffering from a leaking aneurysm in his abdomen,
which was in a treacherous condition, and there was no way of knowing
when it might rupture, said Mr Pollock.
The patient might have survived if he had had surgery on admission to
the hospital, followed immediately by intensive care, he added. But two
intensive care unit nurses were off sick, and the unit's beds were
occupied.
When Mr McGowan suddenly became an emergency, the staff had to
operate.
Mr Pollock said: ''The package of care to produce a live patient was
not available at the Royal Infirmary that night. There was no place for
him in the Royal and nowhere we could send him.''
Mr Pollock said that, along with other senior clinicians, he had made
repeated requests to the hospital's management, asking for more beds in
the intensive care unit.
However, the hospital administration had told doctors and surgeons to
transfer their patients to beds in other hospitals if there were none at
the Royal.
Mr Pollock said: ''To take an unstable patient from the theatre and
transfer them by ambulance to another hospital elsewhere is wrong
management. The seven beds are inadequate for a hospital the size of the
Royal Infirmary, with the complexity of its surgery, and I don't have a
crystal ball to tell me who will be able to take one of our patients for
us.
''It is essential to have intensive care beds available before a
decision is taken to carry out major surgery, and I was incensed about
what had happened.
''Every specialised unit in the hospital has fought for more ICU beds.
Since 1990, I have had to cancel major surgery, sometimes within an hour
of the scheduled operation, because no ICU beds were available. In one
case, I had to cancel the same operation every week over a three-week
period and I have written and complained to the management.''
Asked by advocate Gerald Carroll, acting for Mr McGowan's family, what
reason he had been given for the shortage of beds, Mr Pollock replied:
''Lack of money, lack of nurses, and lack of accommodation.''
He told the inquiry that, after Mr McGowan's death, he had complained
to Mr Nigel Clifford, the hospital's chief executive, who later said
that efforts would be made to provide more nurses trained in intensive
care.
0 Earlier another surgeon, Mr John Reidy, told the inquiry how he
spent an hour urgently telephoning round other hospitals in the city
trying to find a bed. He tried the Southern General, Stobhill, and the
Western and Victoria infirmaries, ''but there was no bed available in
the whole city''.
Mr Reidy, who now works at the Victoria Infirmary, said Mr McGowan's
chances of survival might have been greater if the operation had taken
place sooner.
Asked by Mr Carroll how he felt afterwards, he replied: ''I was
extremely angry and emotional, and I expressed my frustration at the
lack of intensive care facilities. I felt we had done our best for Mr
McGowan in the circumstances.''
He said he might have advised the dead man's relatives to ''kick up a
fuss'', adding: ''I felt they had grounds to complain.''
The hearing, before Sheriff John McGowan, continues today.

INDUSTRIALIST Sir Ian Wood and his wife, Lady Helen Wood, were last
night at the bedside of their 16-year-old son, who is critically ill in
hospital suffering from bacterial meningitis.
Gareth Wood, a pupil at Robert Gordon's College, was admitted to
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary early on Monday. An 18-year-old woman who is in
her first year at Aberdeen College was also admitted at the weekend
suffering from the same condition but Grampian Health Board says the
cases are not related.
A week ago, a 25-year-old Montrose man died from meningitis in the
same hospital in a case which the health authority says was also
unrelated.
The conditions of Gareth and the 18-year-old woman, who has not been
named, were classed as ''critical'' last night.
The woman's condition was revealed at Aberdeen Sheriff Court earlier
yesterday when her boyfriend appeared.
Unemployed Robert Teasdale broke down as the court heard that she had
meningitis.
His solicitor, Mr Mike Monro, asked the sheriff to deal leniently with
his client in the circumstances of the case.
Teasdale, 27, of Holburn Road, Aberdeen, appeared from custody and
admitted a breach of a probation order which had been imposed nearly two
years ago.
He had been put on probation for defrauding a hotel of #543 and
stealing #300 from a car-hire firm in December 1992. He is currently in
prison for another matter.
Mr Monro said: ''His girlfriend was taken ill recently with what was
thought to be flu. That has since been diagnosed as meningitis. I had to
break the news to Mr Teasdale myself this morning.
''I feel I have grounds in the special circumstances of this case to
ask you to deal with this case in a rather unusual manner.''
Sheriff Charles McFarlane discharged the probation order and deferred
sentence for six months to allow Teasdale to continue making restitution
of the money.
A spokesman for the Wood Group, which has a wide range of interests in
the area, including fish-related industries and offshore work, said last
night: ''The family are very upset and we are all rooting for Gareth and
hoping he will pull through.''
Sir Ian, 52, and Lady Helen have three sons. A relative at their
Aberdeen home said neither was expected back from the hospital for the
time being.
An official of the health board said the two teenagers were admitted
at the weekend with suspected meningitis and tests had since shown both
cases were meningococcal meningitis but of different types ''and are
therefore not related''.

THE parents of a five-year-old boy, who suffered devastating injuries
at birth, yesterday settled a #2m damages action against Lothian Health
Board.
Stuart Runciman was left suffering from cerebral palsy after his brain
was starved of oxygen during his birth at Edinburgh's Western General
Hospital in May 1989.
Mr Paul Runciman, a policeman, and his wife, Pamela, blame their son's
injuries on the negligence of medical and midwifery staff. Stuart
suffers from a severe speech impediment and attends a speech therapist,
a physiotherpist, an occupational therapist, and a psychologist.
He cannot walk, dress, or feed himself without help and has had to
undergo extensive surgery.
0 His parents will have to move house since their present home is not
suited to Stuart's needs. They will need extra space for the special
equipment he needs and to accommodate carers.
Lord Abernethy was due to hear evidence at the Court of Session
yesterday in the claim by Mr and Mrs Runciman, of Falkland Gardens,
Edinburgh, when the couple's counsel, Mr Colin Sutherland, QC, informed
the judge that the case had been settled.
The terms of the settlement were not disclosed but lawyers acting for
the Runcimans confirmed that damages were ''very substantial''.
Stuart was Mrs Runciman's first child and she went into labour on May
8, 1989. She was admitted to hospital about 5am but the foetus became
extremely distressed. By 8.45pm, its heart rate became grossly abnormal
and the indications were that the baby had to be delivered urgently.
A decision was finally taken at 9pm to deliver the baby by using
instruments and attempts at instrumental delivery started at about
9.10pm. However, the parents said they were poorly executed and too
slow.
Stuart was eventually delivered by forceps at 9.44pm but this was more
than an hour after the urgent need for delivery arose, the parents
claimed. During that time, Stuart continued to suffer from lack of
sufficient oxygen to the brain.
The Runcimans said hospital staff should have known that Stuart had to
be delivered as a matter of urgency if he was not to suffer from
permanent brain damage.
The health board admitted that two attempts to deliver Stuart by means
of suction technique and an attempt to rotate the baby's head with
forceps had failed before the baby was finally delivered.

AN additional #2m to help deal with Edinburgh District Council's
long-standing backlog of house repair grant applications has been agreed
by Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.
It comes on top of the #8m already made available to the city for this
purpose in 1994-95.
The Housing Minister made it clear that costs would have to be kept
down by strict management and control to the level necessary to finish
the job.
The #2m is to be made available in 1995-96 but he has indicated that
some of the allocation could be made earlier.
Councillor Mary Mulligan, housing convener, described the move as a
vote of confidence in the council's plans to resolve the issue once and
for all. Around 1000 pre-1984 private repairs grant applications are
outstanding.
She said the Government had recognised that Edinburgh had put together
a sensible programme to clear the applications in the next two years.
An independent investigation into the #26m backlog of applications is
under way and, earlier this week, a second housing official was sacked
after a disciplinary hearing.

LOS ANGELES: A drug used to treat heroin addiction has been approved
by the US Government as the first new drug in 40 years to treat
alcoholism. Revia, or naltrexone chloride, blocks the craving for the
drug and the heady feeling of getting high, newspapers reported. ''This
is the beginning of a new era in alcoholism treatment,'' said Dr Enoch
Gordis, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism. The drug, developed by DuPont Merck, has been passed by the
US Food and Drug Administration.

APPOINTMENTS are being sent to 78 Scottish heart patients who have
been waiting for more than a year for coronary by-pass surgery, the
Scottish Office announced yesterday.
The round-up is intended to cut the guaranteed maximum waiting time
for heart operations below one year and bring Scotland in to line with
the guarantee being published today in a revised Patients' Charter for
England and Wales.
Scottish Health Minister Lord Fraser said he was not issuing a revised
Scottish Charter because most of the targets in the English version were
being met or had been delegated to health boards and trusts to improve.
Health boards will become responsible in April for purchasing coronary
by-passes for their own patients -- they are currently purchased
centrally by the Scottish Office from the four centres in Glasgow,
Edinburgh, and Aberdeen -- and Lord Fraser said he expected the one-year
guarantee to be maintained by them.
''We decided that the key to delivering and improving on the
commitments of the charter published in 1991 was to ask health board and
NHS trusts to build on the national guarantees and targets and develop
additional commitments and standards specific to the needs of the
populations they serve,'' he said.
''Three years on, I can now say that both boards and trusts have
responded magnificently to this challenge.''
Lord Fraser said an 18-month longstop guarantee for treatment was
being achieved with very few exceptions. A number of health boards had
12 and 15-month guarantees and all boards were committed to a 12-month
guarantee by April 1997.
However, Scotland will not be following the lead expected to be set by
by Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley today in scrapping mixed-sex
hospital wards. Lord Fraser said there was no evidence of significant
problems north of the Border.
Following complaints in England and Wales about embarrassment caused
to patients forced to share mixed-sex facilities, wards will be
converted to ensure greater privacy.
Lord Fraser said there would be no specific commitment on this because
there was no evidence that people experience significant problems.
''Action is taken to ensure intelligent use of in-patient beds and
managerial and professional sensitivity to the problems that can arise
if patients are inappropriately grouped,'' he said.

CHICAGO: A prize-winning violinist was maimed and dragged for several
hundred yards under a commuter train after her instrument bag became
trapped in the doors at Winnetka, Illinois. The wheels severed Rachel
Barton's left leg below the knee and seriously damaged her right leg.
Miss Barton, 20, who in 1992 was the youngest performer to win the J S

SCOTLAND'S top judge and its leading law officer will take part this
weekend in a debate among members of the Faculty of Advocates on the
rising tide of concern among both the legal profession and the public
over decisions by the Criminal Appeal Court and possible miscarriages of
justice.
All 350 practising members of the faculty have been invited by its
Dean, Mr Andrew Hardie, to attend the Saturday forum in Edinburgh, when
they will get the chance to air their views on specific cases where
appeal judges' decisions have been seriously criticised or questioned.
The concerns on the loose agenda also cover the development and
interpretation of basic legal principles, such as the laws of
corroboration of evidence, the admissibility of confessions, and rules
on the admission of additional evidence on appeal.
Lord Justice-General Lord Hope will participate in the debate, which
is expected to attract large numbers.
The Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger, is expected to launch the discussions
by addressing the gathering at an early stage. It will take place in
strict privacy.
Media inquiries were referred to a public relations consultant, who
confirmed that Lord Hope and Lord Rodger would be taking part.
He said: ''It is not seen as a confrontational meeting. I wouldn't
call it confrontational or anything like it. I think there will be an
opportunity for members of the faculty to raise any points they like''.
He stressed that the meeting should not be seen as a precursor to
legislation. ''No doubt the Lord Justice-General will take note and have
something to say himself but, if he does, it will very definitely be in
private.''
Last night, Mr Donald Findlay, QC, said he felt that there was some
concern in the profession that the law on appeals might be ''too bogged
down'' in the strict observation of Acts of Parliament, rather than in
''getting it right''.
He said that, in Scotland, the law could be ''overly-obsessed'' with
the sufficiency of evidence. He also said he would want to raise the
advantages of the ''unsafe verdict'' in England, where the appeal court
could say there was enough evidence for a jury to have convicted but
could decide that the conviction was unsafe.

<HEADLINE>Earthquake city in flames. Scots students face massive aftershock as 1800 die</HEADLINE>

THE worst earthquake in Japan for half a century left at least 1800
dead, and a large city ablaze.
Seismological experts in Edinburgh, who registered the quake on Monday
night, warned last night that a massive aftershock could strike the
region at any time within the next 48 hours. More than 400 smaller
aftershocks have already been felt in the area.
The earthquake, which ripped across a densely populated area in the
south of the country, and which measured 7.2 on the Richter scale, also
injured 6337 people, and left 1036 missing. It was centred just off the
large port city of Kobe.
Britons caught up in the quake, including a group of Scottish students
from Stirling University, described watching Kobe burn after being
wakened from their beds by the jolt of the first tremor. ''Practically
the whole of Kobe in front of us exploded in flames,'' said one
eyewitness. ''The sky was just filled with these enormous flames.''
Last night Kobe, a large industrial centre, was still ablaze with
hundreds of fires as rescuers scrabbled through rubble to try to find
some of those missing. Eyewitnesses described the scene as ''the end of
the world''.
The main quake struck at 5.46am, just before the massive network of
commuter trains in Kobe were up and running. The epicentre was located
about 13 miles beneath the island of Awajishima, which is about 20 miles
offshore from Kobe, home to 1.5 million people.
A total of nearly 10,000 houses, buildings, and other structures were
completely destroyed or partially damaged by the quake across a 60-mile
radius from Kobe to Japan's second largest city of Osaka and to the
ancient capital of Kyoto, where temples and priceless Buddha statues
were damaged.
Nearly all the dead and more than half the injured were in Kobe
itself, which sits between mountains and the Sea of Japan.
Some 2000 Britons, including a contingent of ex-patriate Scots, are
registered as living in the area. Last night there was still no
confirmation that they, or any other foreigners, had been hurt.
Questions will now be asked why Japan, with some of the most
sophisticated earthquake precautions in the world, including safety
drills and special structural innovations, could see devastation on such
a scale. There were reports that the gas had not been turned off quickly
enough after the first tremor and that the rescue effort was too slow.
Some seismological experts in the UK, however, said little could have
been done to lessen the impact of the quake which was of the more
devastating shallow type and came so close to a major city. Previous
quakes in the region have been bigger but have hit rural areas or just
off the coast.
The quake was the biggest in the Kansai area of Japan since a 1946
tremor measuring 8.0 killed nearly 1,500 people. It was the biggest
recorded in Kobe since statistics were first compiled in 1926. In terms
of casualties, it was Japan's worst earthquake since a 1948 tremor
measuring 7.1 hit Fukui in central Japan, killing 3769 people.
Minutes after it hit cars were left hanging from overhead motorways,
railway lines dangled in mid-air and dazed residents clad only in
pyjamas staggered about seeking refuge from the biting cold, or
scrabbling threw rubble to try to locate survivors. There were yawning
gaps in the elevated Hanshin Expressway which connects Osaka to Kobe.
One journalist who flew over the devastated area in a helicopter, said
the scene resembled one of Japan's Godzilla monster movies with the
landscape scarred by fires, twisted roads, and crumpled buildings.
''From the air it looks as though some prehistoric creature had trampled
through the area,'' she said.
With many areas of Kobe, once one of Japan's most elegant cities,
reduced to rubble, insurance experts estimated that the earthquake
caused more than #12bn worth of damage.
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama ordered troops into Kobe to help
residents who were trying to battle blazes in the city centre, some just
with buckets, more than 12 hours after the quake struck. More than
100,000 people were spending the night in shelters.
Rescuers, who converged on Kobe from all over Japan, dug into rubble
with their hands to search for those missing, including 20 patients
trapped in the debris of a collapsed hospital. Dozens of cars were
squashed by the collapse of an elevated highway just outside Kobe, and
10 trains were derailed. Police said 14 drivers and passengers were
killed as their cars were flung from the expressway or drove into three
100-yard wide chasms left in the highway by the collapse of road
sections.
In the hours after the first tremor, the aftershocks hampered rescue
efforts and brought down already-damaged buildings.
Streets were littered with rubble, building walls were cracked in many
places and shop roofs had collapsed inwards into a V-shape.
One old woman, wearing a blodstained bandage, looked drained of
emotion: ''My family was crushed underneath the house,'' she said.

Strasbourg
THE Prime Minister was last night on a collision course with Brussels
as Mr Jacques Delors's successor and the federalists, including the
French President, attempted to seize the EU political agenda.
Mr Jacques Santer, president-designate of the European Commission, set
out on his five-year term with an all-out attack on everything the
British Government stands for.
The man who owes his job to Mr Major, after Britain vetoed Belgian
premier Jean-Luc Dehaene, mounted a demolition of the British vision for
Europe's future. He declared his opposition to the UK's continued
opt-out from the Social Chapter on workers' rights and called for strict
adherence to the European timetable for a single currency.
President Francois Mitterrand then stepped up the attack by making a
single currency a top priority for the current French EU presidency.
The Prime Minister fought back in the Commons with a blunt warning to
the EU Commission to stick to the tasks assigned to it. ''The high tide
of federalism in Europe has passed,'' he said.
Tory back benchers rallied behind Mr Major's tough line on Europe by
giving him a rapturous send-off from Question Time.
To the delight of Tory MPs, Mr Major also refered to Mr Blair's rebuke
to Labour MEPs who placed an advertisement calling for the retention of
Clause 4. ''I'm rather surprised at what Mr Blair has to say about
handing more powers to the European Parliament in view of the low
opinion he's recently expressed of some members of it.''
Downing Street said later there would be no U-turn on the chapter
opt-out enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty of 1992.
However, the band of Euro-sceptic Tory MPs were still furious with Mr
Santer and demanded the Government fought federalism tooth and nail at
the 1996 Euro-summit. Sir Teddy Taylor summed up their mood: ''It's
appalling that the Commission boss we fought to have appointed is
slapping us in the face with extremist Euro-nonsense.''
Labour also seized on this point. Treasury spokesman Alistair Darling
MP for Edinburgh Central, demanded: ''In the light of what Mr Santer had
to say today on the subject of European integration, do you still
believe he is the right man for the right job at the right time? Or are
you guilty of yet another gross error of judgment?''
Mr Major retorted: ''I wonder if you can tell me if you've read all 34
pages of Mr Santer's speech?''
Lord Tebbit said last night: ''Mr Santer is an official and he ought
to take his policy line from the heads of government. He should keep his
mouth a little more tightly buttoned up till he learns what the heads of
government want to do.''
There had been no concealing the determination of the Brussels
visionaries to drive forward progress towards a federal superstate, with
or without British support. The attack by Mr Santer, who avoided
mentioning Britain by name, effectively staked his claim to follow Mr
Delors as chief Tory bogeyman.
In a tough speech to the European Parliament which today votes on
whether to accept or reject the new 20-strong European Commission, Mr
Santer concluded with a oblique swipe at Britain's record of
Euro-scepticism: ''We must show more fighting spirit and reject the
attacks of those who would seek to solve tomorrow's problems with
yesterday's tired old recipes.''
Mr Santer put employment at the top of his agenda but said the battle
for jobs would not be won by dismantling Europe's model of society.
''We should not shy away from opposing those who claim to be good
Europeans but spend all their time questioning the Community model.''
His remarks seemed to vindicate claims by opposition parties that
Britain's veto of Mr Dehaene had backfired by promoting another
Euro-federalist.
He said there must be no departing from the path to economic and
monetary union: ''If we want a strong economy, we must also have a
strong single currency with no internal exchange risks. This would
enable us to develop the full potential of the large market and
stimulate investment. A single currency will bring substantial benefits
to people in their everyday lives.''
He said some countries saw the principle of subsidiarity, in which as
much power as possible rests with national governments, as meaning:
''Keep a close watch on what my neighbour does but leave me alone''.
''Subsidiarity has another enemy -- the bad faith of those who
deliberately want to interpret it as a way of fighting against
integration and so use it as an excuse to bring matters back under
national control, while forgetting to apply it in cases where the Union
is better placed to act.''
On social policy, he said: ''It is unfortunate that we were not all
able to advance together at Maastricht. I hope that in 1996 unity
between all 15 members will be restored and that we will take a new step
together towards a social Europe.''
Mr Santer said he was prepared to consider a ''multi-speed Europe''
like that outlined by Mr Major.
However, he added, member states should not be able to pick and choose
policies as if they were items on a restaurant menu.
He backed closer co-operation on foreign policy. ''So what is stopping
us from having a real common foreign and security policy?'' he asked.
President Mitterrand insisted that a single currency was the only way
to turn Europe into a major economic and monetary power and ensure
growth for EU economies.
