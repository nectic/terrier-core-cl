THE Civil Aviation Authority is investigating an incident in which a
light aircraft severed overhead power lines. The six-seater Beachcraft
Baron was on a routine flight on Friday when the pilot made a low pass
over Baldoon private airfield in Wigtownshire, striking the lines as it
regained height. The plane, with no passengers aboard, continued on its
flight to Cumbernauld where it was examined.

RANGERS striker Brian Laudrup, captaining Denmark for the first time,
inspired them to a 2-0 win over Saudi Arabia in yesterday's
Inter-Continental Cup Group A match in Riyadh.
The win puts the Danes level on points with Mexico in the six-nation
tournament of the continental champions.
Laudrup scored the opener, after having run from midway in the Saudi
half, and substitute Morten Wieghorst, who plays for Dundee, settled the
issue with the second goal near the end.
Fiorentina striker Gabriel Batistuta scored twice as Argentinabeat
Japan 5-1 in their Group B match. Argentina are now level on points with
Nigeria
* A FIRST half hat trick from striker Patrice Loko sent Nantes seven
points clear at the top of the French league and gave them a big boost
four days before their make-or-break game of the season. Loko struck in
the sixteenth, thirty-third, and fortieth minutes as Nantes carried
their unbeaten league run to 22 matches in a 3-0 drubbing of Lille.
Defending champions Paris St Germain, the leaders' only rivals for the
title, were not in action as their game at Sochaux was postponed because
of heavy snow in eastern France.
The Parisians meet Nantes on Wednesday at the Parc des Princes in the
crunch game of the season.

CHILEAN striker Ivan Zamorano grabbed a first half hat trick as league
leaders Real Madrid crushed champion Barcelona 5-0 in Spain's clash of
the giants before a crowd of 107,000 in the Bernabeu stadium on
Saturday.
Barcelona played the second half with 10 men after Bulgarian striker
Hristo Stoichkov was sent off on the stroke of half-time for stamping on
the knee of Madrid full back Quique Sanchez Flores.
Madrid's fourth and fifth goals came within a minute of each other in
the sixty-ninth and seventieth minutes, with Luis Enrique Martinez and
Jose Amavisca supplying the final touches.
The victory consolidated Madrid's position at the top of the table
with 25 points from 16 games. Barcelona, who barely managed a shot at
goal, are now five points adrift. Results on the Continent:

SCOTLAND and Rangers keeper Andy Goram has been ordered to rest after
suffering another calf injury following his comeback to the first team
at Firhill on Saturday. Goram, who pulled up in pain after running out
to clear a pass-back, had his leg strapped up on Saturday night and a
further examination will take place this morning.
But he is certain to be out for at least a further two weeks, and it
could be more if the doctors indiate he needs longer to make sure he has
fully recuperated. ''It is a different area in his calf,'' said manager
Walter Smith. ''He had trained for two days last week and seemed fine.''
Goram had pulled up in very similar fashion during the international
with Greece last month and had his leg put in plaster. He missed four
games and is sure to be absent for another couple of matches at least.
Colin Scott, who deputised for Goram during that spell, came on again in
his place against Partick Thistle and looks set for another run in the
side.
Goram's injury brought the total of Rangers players off hurt to nine
and left the Ibrox side with an unlikely looking line-up against
Thistle. Richard Gough, Basile Boli, Charlie Miller, Gordon Durie, Mark
Hateley, Ally McCoist, Trevor Steven and Alexei Mikhailichenko are all
at various stages of recovery. Add to that the absence of Brian Laudrup
on Danish international duty and it is easy to see the difficulties
facing Smith, even with the size and quality of pool at his disposal.

IN any other year, the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan controversy would
have been a sports story without equal. One star arranges an attack on
the other which leads to a web of intrigue and conspiracy worthy of a
Hollywood screenplay.
When O J Simpson was arrested on charges of murdering his wife,
however, every other sports story quickly became secondary. But there
may be links between the Simpson drama and that of Kerrigan and Harding.
Travellers going on tours of Portland, Harding's home town, are often
introduced to sights and scenes from the skater's past and present. One
now noted landmark is the Dockside Saloon and Restaurant owned by Kathy
Peterson, in whose garbage was found evidence crucial to the case
against Harding.
Peterson's accidental role in the case has become remarkably well
known, so much so that she is now besieged by inquiries of a unique
kind. ''People ask if I have any information about O J Simpson,'' she
says.
Quite possibly, her garbage will be under scrutiny for evermore.
* THE National Enquirer newspaper deals in stories of a sensational
nature and especially common on its front page are headlines regarding
abduction by space aliens, Elvis sightings and outlandish stories about
Princess Di.
It recently came to light that two executives from the publication are
in negotiations to buy the Tampa Bay Buccaneeers American football team.
Tom Weir of USA Today observes that it is difficult not to get excited
about their bid.
If they succeed, Tampa Bay games would unquestionably be followed by
Enquirer headlines such as ''Pig that was skinned to make the football
comes back to life,'' and ''Elvis spotted selling steroids.''
The latter, of course, would be ludicrous, because everybody knows
Elvis is living in Kalamazoo, Michigan, which is nowhere near Tampa.
* FOR 30 years, Pete Carril has been basketball coach of the men's
team at Princeton University, 30 years in which greatest glory has often
gone to the biggest universities, such as Penn State and Michigan.
Certainly, Carril, 64, has seen his share of success, but it has
invariably been hard-fought. And as he begins the 1995 season with three
first-year players on his starting team, the road does not appear likely
to get any easier.
The feeling around Princeton is that so many years of toil have taken
a certain toll on Carril. The college's athletic director, Gary Walters,
when asked to comment, responded: ''He can be curmudgeonly. But I think
he has reached a point in his life where he is entitled to be a
curmudgeon.''
BILL Cowher, coach of the famed Pittsburgh Steelers, has himself
become an American football legend in no uncertain terms.
Cowher's team is one of the most powerful in the NFL, but it is for
his way of browbeating his players that the coach has become specially
renowned.
He likes to shout, berate and verbally castigate his players as a
means to better their performances. And he likes to do it at close
quarters.
After back-up quarterback Mike Tomczak fumbled a play in training,
Cowher stormed onto the field and headed for the group of dumbstruck
players.
''He was still 10 feet away from me,'' recalls Tomczak, ''but his chin
was, like . . . right in my face.''
''You almost can't hear what he's saying,'' observes linebacker Chad
Brown, ''because you're thinking, 'he's entirely too close to me right
now.' ''
Comments reserve full back, Steve Avery: ''He's so emotional when he
speaks to us that even his lips start shaking. Thank God he doesn't have
bad breath.''
Cowher's players might learn to counter their coach's intimidation
tactics by following an example he set himself during his schoolboy
days.
The story goes that Cowher and a friend were frequently in trouble
with a schoolteacher they had nicknamed Mamma Bear. Whenever she
threatened them with retribution, Cowher would simply smile and say:
''Au contraire, Mamma Bear, we don't scare.''

BLACKBURN gave their manager, Kenny Dalglish, a welcome tonic
yesterday by returning from St James's Park with a 1-1 draw following
their FA Cup tie against Newcastle.
Dalglish, watching at home on television after an appendicitis
operation, will be confident of reaching the fourth round, and a meeting
with either Middlesbrough or Swansea, with his team still on a roll --
one defeat in 14 games.
Blackburn's Stuart Ripley and Peter Beardsley, of the home side,
almost scored inside the first 70 seconds but after 30 minutes, Rovers
took the initiative.
Chris Sutton played a one-two with Alan Shearer, waited for the keeper
to commit himself, then chipped the ball home.
However, Kevin Keegan's half-time talk had the desired effect and his
team were level within 10 minutes. A Venison shot came back off the bar,
eventually falling to Richard Lee, who cut inside two defenders to
score.

CELTIC'S #1.2m buy from Holland, Pierre van Hooydonk, flew home
yesterday, but he will be back to make his debut against Hearts at
Hampden on Wednesday. The tall, powerful striker is anxious to get on
with his career in Britain. He said yesterday that he was determined to
go only to a British or Spanish club.
''I have always wanted to join a big club and I believe Celtic, even
although they have not won anything for a time, will be successful
again,'' said the Dutchman, who has rejected three offers from Germany
already this season. ''I only saw eight minutes of the game in Glasgow
yesterday, but I saw enough to see that Celtic like to play a passing
game and attack a lot.''
The FC Breda player has known for some time that he would be pursuing
his career with a bigger club. In fact, he had designed his contract to
suit that event. He had a clause written in to his arrangement with
Breda which permitted him to go if a suitable club came for him.
In the year just finished, van Hooydonk was the top scorer in Dutch
football with 24 league goals. ''I know people say I score goals because
of my size, but I like to think I am good on the ground, too. I think
Scottish football will suit my style.''
Breda, have not been keen to let the striker go but, with St Etienne
and Fyeneoord already in the chase along with Celtic, have had to bow to
the inevitable. Van Hooydonk was also watched for a while by Newcastle
United.
Painful return
SCOTLAND and Rangers keeper Andy Goram has been ordered to rest after
suffering another calf injury following his comeback to the first team
at Firhill on Saturday. Goram, who pulled up in pain after running out
to clear a pass-back, had his leg strapped up on Saturday night and a
further examination will take place this morning.
But he is certain to be out for at least a further two weeks, and it
could be more if the doctors indiate he needs longer to make sure he has

Goram had pulled up in very similar fashion during the international

games and is sure to be absent for another couple of matches at least.
Colin Scott, who deputised for Goram during that spell, came on again in
his place against Partick Thistle and looks set for another run in the
side.
Goram's injury brought the total of Rangers players off hurt to nine
and left the Ibrox side with an unlikely looking line-up against
Thistle. Richard Gough, Basile Boli, Charlie Miller, Gordon Durie, Mark
Hateley, Ally McCoist, Trevor Steven and Alexei Mikhailichenko are all
at various stages of recovery. Add to that the absence of Brian Laudrup
on Danish international duty and it is easy to see the difficulties
facing Smith, even with the size and quality of pool at his disposal.
* DUNDEE United's Gary Bollan will make history this week if he is
successful in having the option part of his contract declared invalid.
The former Under-21 internationalist is on a four-year deal with a
further four-year option, but he will ask the Scottish League appeals
committee to examine the wording of the option clause. He believes it is
not specific enough.
Meanwhile, United, the holders, came out with a home draw for their
first tie in this year's Tennents Scottish Cup, taking on second
division Clyde at Tannadice. Rangers have to face Hamilton at Firhill.
The Accies fans still regale all who will listen to their great moment
five years ago when they knocked the team then managed by Graeme Souness
out of the same competition at Ibrox. Draw:
Clydebank v Hearts; Whitehill Welfare or Montrose v Hibs; Hamilton v
Rangers; Meadowbank Thistle v Berwick Rangers; Falkirk v Motherwell;
Cove Rangers v Dunfermline; Stirling Albion v Airdrie; Raith Rovers v
Ayr United; Dundee United v Clyde; Dundee v Partick Thistle; St
Johnstone v Stenhousemuir; Keith or Huntly v Burntisland Shipyard;
Celtic v St Mirren; East Fife v Ross County; Aberdeen v Stranraer;
Kilmarnock v Queen's Park or Morton. Ties to be played on January 28.

''WE'LL be back'' -- that is the message from the Scottish Rugby Union
to St Johnstone Football Club after the Scotland A victory over Italy at
McDiarmid Park, Perth, on Saturday.
It was the first rugby international to be staged at a soccer stadium
for 89 years but the experiment was voted an overwhelming success.
A crowd of 6606 paid to see the game, a little higher than the average
gate for football.
SRU President Ken Smith said: ''We will certainly consider bringing
other big matches to McDiarmid Park. This is an area in which we are
trying to encourage the spread of our game.''
His words were echoed by chief executive Bill Hogg. ''Everyone has
been most helpful and I should like to thank the football club for their
hospitality. The fact that they have installed sockets which can take
rugby posts shows they are keen to have us here.'
The Scotland players were also enthusiastic. A team captain Kevin
McKenzie declared: ''This is a great place to stage an international.
The pitch is in top-class condition, the crowd are close to the pitch,
and they got behind us today.''
For St Johnstone, general manager Stewart Duff insisted: ''We
experienced no problems and would be happy to have the rugby boys back
next season.''
Midlands' rugby union secretary John Methven said: ''Following this
success, we hope we can have the Western Samoan tourists at this venue
next season.''
Now that rugby has re-entered the football arena, Hogg wonders whether
the swopping could work the other way as well.
''I would like to see a major football match being played at
Murrayfield which is, after all, one of the finest stadiums in Europe.
''Would Raith Rovers like to play their European ties there? Tell
anyone who is interested to give me a ring.''

Motherwell 1, Hearts 2
CHRIS McCart must be some kind of wonderful player. There can be no
other explanation for what he did yesterday unless, of course, we look
to the referee, Louis Thow.
Could he possibly have blundered so badly? Let's consider what
happened at Fir Park to have so incensed Motherwell's supporters while
causing Hearts' small band to snigger.
The game, which was not very attractive, was stumbling towards 1-1
when, in 79 minutes, McCart moved to intercept an attack. Stephen Frail
had tried to smack the ball into Motherwell's box but failed to beat
McCart, who fell when trying to block the delivery.
McCart tumbled and panicked when he saw the ball drop back at his
feet, one of which he swung wildly with the intention of sending the
ball to safety. Instead, the ball looped into the air and was carried in
the swirling wind over his head towards his own goal.
Steve Woods came off his line and had to leap to clutch the wayward
ball. Motherwell's players were incredulous when they realised that Thow
decided McCart had passed the ball back and gave an indirect free kick
to Hearts.
It would have been a back pass which Pele could not have executed at
the height of his powers, but Thow believed McCart to have achieved the
impossible. It was a bizarre decision and one which should not go
without investigation and questions must be asked of the official.
From the free kick, Brian Hamilton's shot was blocked and so, too, was
Scott Leitch's effort, but the ball fell to Colin Miller. His shot was
powerful and, although Woods managed to get a touch, the ball dropped
into the net.
''There's nothing I can say about the incident,'' said Alex McLeish,
Motherwell's manager. ''I'll only get myself in trouble, but you could
say there are a few angry people in our dressing room.''
McLeish asked the referee why he had felt McCart deliberately passed
the ball back, but he is still waiting for a reply.
The man he succeeded at Fir Park, Tommy McLean, was delighted with his
team's victory, but said the crucial goal was the result of
inconsistency regarding the pass-back rule. ''No-one seems to know
what's going on,'' he said.
Hearts had gone ahead in 16 minutes when Hamilton capped his debut
with a slick goal, but Motherwell's equaliser was better. Paul
McGrillen's shot from 20 yards found the perfect spot in the bottom,
left-hand corner of Craig Nelson's net.
However, Motherwell did not deserve a point because they played
poorly.
Six players -- Motherwell's Rob McKinnon, John Philliben, and Miodrag
Krivokapic and Dave McPherson, Jim Bett, and David Hagen, of Hearts --
were booked, but the real culprit was Thow.
MOTHERWELL -- Woods, McCart, Philliben, Krivokapic, Shannon, Lambert,
Davies, McSkimming, McKinnon, McGrillen, Coyne. Substitutes -- Kirk,
Roddie, Howie.
HEARTS -- Nelson, Jamieson, McPherson, Berry, Frail, Hamilton, Bett,
Leitch, Miller, Hagen, Thomas. Substitutes -- Robertson, Mackay, Smith.
Referee -- L Thow (Ayr).

BRITISH ski racing organisers are frequently criticised for not
providing young skiers with opportunities to compete in the speed
disciplines -- Super G and Downhill -- at a young age, so the British
Alpine Racing Ski Clubs were justifiably pleased to not only complete
their annual championships on Saturday in Radstadt, Austria, after
contending with poor, patchy, snow conditions throughout the week, but
they managed to finish with an exciting Super-G for all age groups.
The fast and fluent course set by former British Team downhiller
Ronald Duncan was completed by 161 racers with only four skiers failing
to finish. The 16-year-old English rising star Oliver Hall (Kent)
completed his haul of all three disciplines, winning the Junior Super G
title in a time of 1:09.15. Andrew Crawford (Scottish Ski Club) took
third place.
Rachel Bradridge (London), won the Girls Super G title, the
17-year-old opening an impressive 2.4-second margin over the 30-gate
course which stayed hard throughout the race thanks to temperatures of
minus 10 degrees. In the Girls Under 15 Age-Group Amanda Pirie
(Aberdeen), who has dominated over the past few years, had to be content
with second place to Eve Tominey, who is based in France at the British
run Ski High School, losing out by just eight hundredths. Results:
Super-G -- Male: 1, O. Hall (Kent), 1min 9.15secs; 2, D. Crouch
(Exeter) 1:11.09; 3, A. Crawford (Scottish SC), 1:12.08.Female: 1, R.
Bradridge (England), 1:15.05; 2, N. Haks (Netherlands) 1:16.41; 3, E.
Tominey (SHS France), 1:17.45.

SHINTY administrators breathed a huge sigh of relief at the weekend as
two outstanding Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup third-round ties beat yet
more atrocious weather which virtually wiped out the first day's play in
the league after the winter break.
With the draw for the fourth round due to take place at Fort William
on Friday night, Caberfeidh's victory over Lochaber and Glenorchy's win
over Tayforth have made matters easier.
The league programme, however, suffered badly, with the main match,
the meeting of Fort William and Kingussie due for An Aird among the
seven league games which bit the dust.
Glenorchy will be most pleased to have got the result which sees them
take their place in the draw on Friday, as they had to travel along with
Perth-based Tayforth to Spean Bridge to find a field which could enable
their cup-tie to go ahead. The Dalmally side were rewarded for their
efforts with a 2-0 lead through Gordon Gibson and John Cowan, but after
Donald MacInnes pulled one back, they had to defend hard to ensure their
place in the draw.
Lochaber manager Billy MacLachlan saw his charges fail due to a
complete lack of imagination in front of goal and Caber's eventual
winning margin of 2-1 -- thanks to a double from Robert Bartlett --
could have been greater if Malcolm Morrison had converted a sixty-fourth
minute penalty.
Inverness had their best win of the season at Cannich, where they
defeated north division two leaders Strathglass, with Duncan MacDougall
again the man of the match, netting both their goals in the 2-1 win.
Lovat overcame plucky Lochcarron. Craig Munro had given Lovat an early
lead before David MacKenzie equalised.
It was only in the later stages that first division Lovat's superior
fitness told and they now go on to meet MacTavish Cup-holders Kingussie
in the semi-finals.
Another west coast team, Lochbroom, have lifted themselves to fourth
place in north division four, their best performance since they were
formed nearly two season ago, with their 1-0 win away to Kincraig.
Beauly and Kingussie both had comfortable wins in the Sutherland Cup.
Results:
North Area: Glenmorangie Qualifying Cup, semi final -- Lochaber 1,
Caberfeidh 2. Bank of Scotland McTavish Cup, second round -- Lochcarron
1, Lovat 3. Glenmorangie Southern Cup, second round -- Beauly 4,
Caberfeidh 1; Kingussie 5, Glenurquhart 1. Marine Harvest League
division 2 -- Strathglass 1, Inverness 2. Division 4 -- Kincraig 0,
Lochbroom 1.
South Area: Glenmorangie Qualifying Cup, semi final -- Glenorchy
2, Tayforth 1. Glenmorangie Sutherland Cup, first round -- Kyles
Athletic 1, Oban Celtic 3; Strachur 2, Glasgow Mid Argyll 1.

nature and especially common on its front page are headlines regarding
abduction by space aliens, Elvis sightings and outlandish stories about
Princess Di.
It recently came to light that two executives from the publication are
in negotiations to buy the Tampa Bay Buccaneeers American football team.
Tom Weir of USA Today observes that it is difficult not to get excited
about their bid.
If they succeed, Tampa Bay games would unquestionably be followed by
Enquirer headlines such as ''Pig that was skinned to make the football
comes back to life,'' and ''Elvis spotted selling steroids.''
The latter, of course, would be ludicrous, because everybody knows
Elvis is living in Kalamazoo, Michigan, which is nowhere near Tampa.
* FOR 30 years, Pete Carril has been basketball coach of the men's
team at Princeton University, 30 years in which greatest glory has often
gone to the biggest universities, such as Penn State and Michigan.
Certainly, Carril, 64, has seen his share of success, but it has
invariably been hard-fought. And as he begins the 1995 season with three
first-year players on his starting team, the road does not appear likely
to get any easier.
The feeling around Princeton is that so many years of toil have taken
a certain toll on Carril. The college's athletic director, Gary Walters,
when asked to comment, responded: ''He can be curmudgeonly. But I think
he has reached a point in his life where he is entitled to be a
curmudgeon.''
BILL Cowher, coach of the famed Pittsburgh Steelers, has himself
become an American football legend in no uncertain terms.
Cowher's team is one of the most powerful in the NFL, but it is for
his way of browbeating his players that the coach has become specially
renowned.
He likes to shout, berate and verbally castigate his players as a
means to better their performances. And he likes to do it at close
quarters.
After back-up quarterback Mike Tomczak fumbled a play in training,
Cowher stormed onto the field and headed for the group of dumbstruck
players.
''He was still 10 feet away from me,'' recalls Tomczak, ''but his chin
was, like . . . right in my face.''
''You almost can't hear what he's saying,'' observes linebacker Chad
Brown, ''because you're thinking, 'he's entirely too close to me right
now.' ''
Comments reserve full back, Steve Avery: ''He's so emotional when he
speaks to us that even his lips start shaking. Thank God he doesn't have
bad breath.''
Cowher's players might learn to counter their coach's intimidation
tactics by following an example he set himself during his schoolboy
days.
The story goes that Cowher and a friend were frequently in trouble
with a schoolteacher they had nicknamed Mamma Bear. Whenever she
threatened them with retribution, Cowher would simply smile and say:
''Au contraire, Mamma Bear, we don't scare.''

ITALIAN skier Alberto Tomba's dream season continued with his seventh
World Cup victory yesterday. The overall World Cup leader mastered a
testing course in the German resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen to win the
fifth slalom of the winter in an overall time of one minute 38.67
seconds.
Luxembourg's veteran all-rounder Marc Girardelli was second in
1:40.62, with France's Yves Dimier third with 1:40.79.
Tomba is rapidly approaching his best-ever run of nine World Cup wins
in one season, which he has achieved twice in his illustrious career --
in 1988 and 1992.
The 28-year-old had to work his skis hard to carve his way down the
difficult Gudiberg piste, which was icy in parts and soft in others.
But, after taking a 0.27sec lead into the second leg, the stocky
Italian used his power and superb technique to keep his line for victory
by 1.95sec.
He complained afterwards about the quality of the snow, stating: ''I
was so upset in the first run that I was thinking of stopping.
''It was icy at one gate and smooth and soft at the next. But it is
great to get this victory. I am tired but I hope I can keep this form
going.''
His countrywoman Deborah Compagnoni displayed skill and cool nerves to
win the women's Alpine giant slalom in Haus, Austria, and make it an
Italian double.
Compagnoni, Olympic giant slalom and super-g gold medallist,
negotiated the fast and technically-demanding course in an overall
combined time of 2min 35.39sec.
Heidi Zeller-Baehler of Switzerland finished second in 2:35.63 to
retain her overall World Cup lead ahead of her compatriot Vreni
Schneider, who was third in 2:35.83.
Former overall World Cup holder Anita Wachter of Austria, who was
almost half a second ahead of Zeller-Baehler after the first leg, fell
victim to her own aggression and crashed out towards the end of the
second leg -- after having increased her lead to more than 1.5sec.
For Compagnioni, winner of three previous World Cup giant slaloms,
Sunday's race marked a successful comeback after missing out the
beginning of the season with a kidney infection.
Zeller-Baehler, 27, winner of two giant slaloms this season and third
in a super-g on this course on Saturday, has shown a remarkable
improvement. Her previous best before this season had been two second
places.
Apart from her wins this season and her third place in Haus, she has
finished second in a super-g and third in a downhill, both in Lake
Louise, Canada.
Schneider, winner of two slaloms this season, was a disapointing
fourth after the first leg, but skied the second with her accustomed
bravado. However, it was not enough to give her a first giant slalom win
since January 1992.

IN what is, after all, a sport in which temperatures are important, it
seems appropriate that we go from the chill of Perth -- the Stakis
Masters Curling at the Dewar Centre -- to Calcutta.
Don't ask me why it is called the Calcutta. It just is. This is when
people get the chance to bid, auctioneer style, for the chance of naming
the likely team to succeed.
A team in curling is organised by the top player, and consists of two,
three, maybe four players. The Calcutta competition is there to make a
bob or two and mainly for the players and the punters. At Perth, the
final sum raised was #4820.
The winning bidder gets 40% of the money in the pot, and second 20%,
which isn't bad. The organisers get a mere 10% of the total amount. But
it is a lot of fun.
Friday night at the Dewar's Centre saw a race night, too. They do
everything at curling -- betting, a good wee bevvy, and whatever else
you can think up of a night. There are undeniably a lot of big handsome
chaps, and a fecundity of pretty girls. I am saying nothing more and
would hardly have to at that.
The Stakis Masters officially kicked off on Friday last, but curlers
are keen chaps, and they had a few matches on the Thursday -- hardly
surprising considering the enthusiasm.
This was a chaps' event, despite the clear fact that Scottish women do
incredibly well and that curling is not organised by gender, there is
still a men's event and the Stakis is one of the most prominent.
There were six teams from Switzerland, and a German team was there for
the weekend too. Altogether there were 128 players.
This is big business, at the end of the day, for the Dewar's rinks,
and for Perth too. Both deserve it.
Dewar's opened up four years ago and cost five-and-a-half million,
opening as one of the top venues in the world. There are more than a
million curlers in Canada, and 40,000 in Scotland. Thus should Scotland
be dwarfed, but she is not.
We have mentioned the Addison girls many times before, and the Hay
boys as well, but what should be recognised is that besides these top
world curlers, we also have Hammy McMillan, Dave and Peter Smith, and
Graeme Connal.
They have won at world level, junior and senior, and at European. In
curling, Scotland has the leading sportspeople, more than any other
sport in which we compete. In fact, at the next Winter Olympics in
Nagano, Japan, to be held in 1988, it is widely thought that the
Scottish curlers have the best chance of a gold medal of any British
entrants in any sport.
And don't forget that Scotland has a long tradition. I asked Roy
Sinclair, vice-president of the world chaps and of Europe why this was,
and why the Scots do so well. ''We gave the game to Canada,'' he said,
''but, aye, we didnae tell them everthin', and kept a bit tae oorsels.
Away and have a dram wi' Chuck there!''
So I had a dram -- and curling aye has a dram to it -- with Chuck Hay,
father of David and Mike, leading Scots' performers in this art.
I found out why I should have a dram with this man, so important in
the last 30 years of this sport in Scotland. One of his sons, after all,
is married to Kirsty Addison, the sister of the other Addison, Karen,
the two top female curlers in damn-near the world, and, I have written
this before, the daughters of my doctor, a lady who obviously can put up
with not only daughters, but a patient like me, to boot.
Chuck was Britain's first ever curling world champion, back in 1967.
He was also the first manager and director of Perth Curling Rink, the
Dewar's, and oversaw this magnificent venue and its inception.
And it is magnificent. There is no other word for it. For some strange
reason, Perth boasts one of the best ice-rinks in the world, and easily
the top venue in the UK, and one of the most splendid little football
parks as well, McDiarmid, Park.
There's not that strange a reason after all. Geoff Brown, chairman of
the St Johnstone footy club, who masterminded the new stadium at
McDiarmid after selling off Muirfield, previous home of the Perh Saints,
had, of course, much to do with the advent of Dewar's.
The whisky company of that name once owned the location. Geoff, God
knows how, persuaded the amber fluid lads to sell the entire acreage for
a quid.
And in 1990, Dewar's ice rink opened. It has a restaurant and a
good-going bar and Richard Harding, the manager, and him a Glaswegian,
(Glasgow Academy no less) was after telling me how well used the place
is. And so it should be.
Incidentally, one could not help but notice how well the Caffrey's
pumps were doing. This is a lovely Irish beer and if they are doing that
well, they might just think of a wee sponsorship next year or even
nearer.
Let us mention for a minute the sponsorship. Curling has done
reasonably well out of this, especially the drinks industry. This
tournament has been well-held by Stakis, and Bell's Whisky, through its
Gannochy Trust, (which spends highly in the arts as well as sport), has
shoved in a bob or two. Probably the reason is that curling is a sport
which enjoys itself.
As my driver, who had never seen curling before, said: ''This is a
one-legged sport.'' With the amount of hospitality and bonhomie, it is
damn-near a legless one as well. I escaped, but only just at that.

EDINBURGH Ladies salvaged some pride for Scotland on a most
disappointing weekend on the international hockey front by capturing
third place in the Arminen Tournament in Vienna.
In the men's event, MIM finished fourth, while in the DTZ event at
Kidderminster, Menzieshill could manage only sixth position.
Edinburgh, the bronze medalists in last season's European club
championship, were on this occasion headed only by German sides
Eintracht Frankfurt and Rot-Weiss. They beat the latter side 6-4 on
Friday, but conceded second place to them on goal difference as a result
of their own surprise 5-0 defeat by Econsult on the opening day.
Sharon Bissett was their top scorer with eight goals, including hat
tricks against Arminen and Stade Francais. The only real disappointment
was their poor performance yesterday, when they went down 13-2 to the
tournament winners, Eintracht Frankfurt.
MIM, in winning their group with maximum points, must have thought
that they, too, were going to finish among the medals, but they were
derailed by Limburg in the semi-finals. The Germans, who went on to win
the title by beating WAC 6-3, overcame the Scots 10-2.
There was further disappointment for the Edinburgh men when they lost
the play-off for third place to Arminen 9-4. MIM won Saturday's group
encounter between the sides 6-5, but for the re-match Arminen drafted in
three guest players.
On the domestic front, North completed the double in the women's
inter-district under-21 events when they won the indoor championship at
Meadowbank on Saturday. Nikki Wheatley was their source of inspiration,
scoring 14 of their goals as they went through their programme unbeaten.

SCOTLAND'S European curling champions Hammy McMillan, Norman Brown,
Mike Hay, and Roger McIntyre became Stakis Masters yesterday at Perth.
McMillan avenged his defeat in the final of 1992 world championship by
Markus Eggler when he beat the three-times Swiss champion firstly in the
A road knock-out and then again by 5-2 in the final.
The Stranraer man's victory also earned him and his team the #3000
first prize and 20 TCA ranking points which took the foursome to the top
of the order of merit with 53.5 points after five events.
The Stakis Masters, with a #7500 total prize fund is the richest in
Scotland and McMillan's victory and the early demise of former world
champion and local hero David Smith confirmed the Stranraer quartet as
Scotland's best.
McMillan began the final by grabbing two shots in the first end after
an uncharacteristic miss by Eggler and a solid draw shot by McMillan to
compound the Swiss error.
Eggler drew for a single in the second when both teams struggled to
find their draw weight.
After a blank third end, McMillan caught a short guard with his first
stone in the fourth but made an excellent draw shot against two Swiss
counters to remain two up.
The game turned in the sixth when McMillan's team piled on the
pressure.
Eggler was left with no shot with his last stone and the Stranraer men
successfully guarded two of their own stones in the four-foot circle to
steal two points and gain an unassailable 5-1 advantage. Results:
Quarter-finals -- C Hamilton (Livingston) 5, J Kenny (Kinross) 4; M
Eggler (Biel Touring, Switzerland) 5, S Byers (Lockerbie) 4; D Wuest
(Winterthur, Switzerland) 6, B Binnie (Letham Grange) 2; H McMillan
(Stranraer) 6, Y Renggli (Geneva) 1.
Semi-finals -- Eggler 5, Hamilton 4; McMillan 7, Wuest 5.
Final -- McMillan 5, Eggler 2.
Third-fourth place -- Hamilton 7, Wuest 2.

ONE of the penalties of being an innovator is to be overtaken by
events. Every major sport played throughout the world was devised and
organised in the United Kingdom, but at few nowadays, either by success
or in structure, does the originator occupy a superior position.
In Scotland, for example, five autonomous bodies run golf in its
various aspects. Although the Royal and Ancient Club is one of them, its
international role sets it apart, and the Ladies' Golf Union also serves
a wider constituency. But do we really need, separately, the Scottish
Golf Union, the Scottish Ladies' Golf Association, and the PGA Scottish
Region?
Weight of numbers might support such separateness for England.
Scotland, Ireland, and Wales would seem to offer more fruitful ground
for an amalgamation of forces. Habit and pride die hard, of course, but
surely one of these days the practicalities will prevail and a federated
authority will be formed.
That thought occurred while reading 'Golf in Wales,' written by John
Hopkins, golf correspondent of The Times, in celebration this year of
the centenary of the Welsh Golfing Union -- which, incidentally, along
with its Irish counterpart long preceded their Scottish and English
equivalents.
Welsh golf always seems to have had a dichotomy. Ian Woosnam, as
patriotic as they come and provider of the book's foreword, was actually
born on the English side of the Border, and the rivalries between the
north and south of the country meant that the union's founding meeting
of seven clubs was held in a hotel in Shrewsbury.
The disadvantage perennially experienced by Wales in the wider world
of golf is economically summed up by a few figures. It has only four per
cent of the male golfers in Britain, belonging to 141 clubs, and its
1994 income was #200,000. By contrast, Scotland, which has more than 500
course-owning clubs, in 1993 generated more than #500,000m.
As Hopkins wryly notes, golf has not come as instinctively to Wales as
rugby and choral singing. Always regarded as the whipping boys in the
Home International matches and lacking, with rare exceptions, individual
players of the front rank, the Principality's golf has beaten what must
have been at times a dispiritingly rough path.
For instance, in the Home Internationals, instituted in 1932, Wales
did not record a win against another country until 1949, when they beat
Scotland. Their first victory against Ireland was in 1951 and over
England not for another decade. Only last year did Wales emerge from a
series unbeaten, having defeated Ireland and halved with Scotland and
England.
However, Wales were the first of the Home Countries to begin basing
team selection on an order of merit system of points awarded for
performances in designated tournaments. That innovation, together
probably with the improvement in playing standards experienced
elsewhere, initiated a transformation in Welsh fortunes.
Welsh golfers won the Amateur Championship four times in 10 years,
Duncan Evans becoming in 1980 the first player from his country to do
so, and, strong enough with a six-man side not to be handicapped by the
weak tail inevitable in the 10-a-side Home Internationals, Wales in 1993
experienced their finest hour by winning the European Team championship.
The thinness of Wales's resources was most vividly illustrated in
1961, when the final of the national championship was contested by Jeff
Toye, at 17 the youngest player in the field, and Albert Evans, at 49
the oldest (and the eventual winner) and later to become one of the
stalwarts among British golf officials.
Another was Tony Duncan, a former Welsh Guards colonel and a
distinguished player in his own right, who famously fell out with no
less intimidating a figure than Jack Nicklaus while refereeing a World
Matchplay championship game. Duncan, a man of few and peremptory words,
was certainly better prepared for that confrontation by his army career
than by one either in rugby or choral singing.

THE long-running dispute between Hambros and a Norwegian state agency
has been settled out of court at a cost to the British merchant banking
group of NKr300m or #28.3m. That is under a fifth of the original claim
of NKr1600m which the Norwegian Guarantee Institute for Ships and
Drilling Vessels was seeking as result of allegations that Hambros had
concealed the true worth of failed shipowner Hilmar Recksten after the
collapse of his shipping empire in the 1970s during the global shipping
crisis which almost sank Burmah Oil in 1974.
There had been a settlement in 1982 when Hambros paid over NKr100m but
the case was later reopened by the Norwegian authorities. A full hearing
was expected to have started today in Oslo but Hambros has decided that
while it admits no liability and the new claim is in breach of the 1982
settlement, the cost and the damage to the goodwill of its business from
what could be a four-month trial persuaded it to settle now.
Norway had provided loans and guarantees to Recksten and other
shipowners. After Mr Recksten died in 1980, the authorities began
investigating the possibility that he had salted away monies in oveseas
tax havens.
Hambros has had a difficult 1994 with half-time profits more than
halving from #39.5m to #21.5m thanks in part to lower dealing profits
and, more important, a sharp rise in costs including new investment.
The settlement will lift a cloud which has been overhanging the bank
for a considerable period and seems unlikely to affect the likely
full-year dividend total which will almost certainly be held at 18.8p.

<RECORDNO>980451451</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL production figures for November are the key economic
indicator of the week. Year-on-year growth rates of well in excess of 5%
show that the dynamo of economic growth is manufacturing and oil, not
services.
If this can be sustained it will help rebalance the economy which was
distorted by the consumer-led growth of the eighties.
Economists at James Capel, the City stockbroker, are forecasting that
industrial production grew by 0.3% between October and November. If so,
year-on-year growth would edge down from 5.6% to 5.5%.
North Sea oil output increased further in November, but the weather
was untypically mild, and the contribution from energy supply will have
been correspondingly weak.
But manufacturing is thought to have grown in line with the recent
trend. Capel is forecasting an increase of 0.3%, taking the year-on-year
growth rate up from 5.5% to 5.9%.
Global trade figures on Friday are expected to show a small
deterioration in the visible deficit to around #600m. Strong invisibles
enabled the UK to record a current account surplus in the third quarter.
Minutes of the December 7 meeting between the Chancellor of the
Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England, at which it was
decided to raise base rates by half-a-point to 6.25%, will be published
on Wednesday.
TODAY -- None announced.
TOMORROW -- None announced.
WEDNESDAY -- Industrial production (November).
THURSDAY -- None announced.
FRIDAY -- Trade figures (October).

REIGNING US Open champion Ernie Els won his first home tournament in
two years by running away with the South African Bell's Cup tournament
by five shots at the Fancourt Estate Golf Club yesterday.
Els closed with a birdie 4 for a final-round, two-under-par 70 and a
72-hole aggregate of 275, 13-under for the tournament.
Joint second on 280 were South African Hendrik Burhmann and American
Pat Horgan, who both hit final-round 71s.
One-stroke ahead overnight, Els dropped a shot at the par-3 sixth, but
birdied seven and nine to turn in 35.
Although he then dropped another shot at the par-5 tenth, Els
recovered with a third birdie at the thirteenth and closed the door on
the rest of the field, with no-one making a realistic challenge.
''It's a really good feeling to win again in South Africa in front of
a home crowd,'' said Els.
''I always felt very comfortable out there today -- knowing the course
so well, I didn't even need yardages.
''Fancourt was set up nicely for me with very little rough, so I could
use my driver, which is a strong part of my game. However, the pins were
very difficult all day.
''I'm now taking next week off before going to Dubai for the Desert
Classic and I need to work on my putting which is a little rusty.''
Leading scores (South African unless stated):
275 -- Ernie Els 69, 67, 69, 70.
280 -- Pat Horgan (USA) 66, 74, 69, 71; Hendrik Buhrmann 72, 65, 72,
71.
281 -- Stuart Hendley (USA) 71, 73, 71, 66; Jim Johnson (USA) 75, 68,

Retief Goosen 68, 68, 71, 74; Stuart Little (England) 68, 69, 72, 72.

ANXIOUS ice hockey fans raised more than #850 for Fife Flyers' young
forward Derek King, who was rushed to hospital with a suspected spinal
injury as the Scots were held 6-6 at Milton Keynes last night.
King crashed to the ice after a heavy check near the end of the first
period. The game was held up for an hour and King, 24 was treated by
paramedics.
Top scorer on the night for the Scots was Steven Lynch, the teenage
son of Flyers coach Jim, who hit a hat trick.
All Flyers' scorers were under 20. The other counters came from Andrew
Samuel and Richard Dingwall, with club captain Iain Robertson assisting
on three goals.
Edinburgh Racers looked to be cruising to a comfortable victory at
Bracknell Bees when they led 4-0 after 29 minutes. Defenceman Mike Ware
scored three, and Slovakian Stan Horansky the other.
But Bees hit Racers with four goals without reply, Rick Smith grabbing
the equaliser less than four minutes from time.
On Saturday, Flyers went down 6-3 at Cardiff Devils, allowing their
hosts to slip into the top three.
Racers' unbeaten run ended at Basingstoke Beavers when they were edged
8-6.
Dumfries Vikings were crushed 14-5 at Chelmsford last night despite a
Doug Smith hat trick. Results:

STEVE Elkington, of Australia, sank a 20-foot birdie putt right across
the eleventh green to beat Bruce Lietzke at the second extra hole after
they had tied on a 72-hole total of 278 following final rounds of 67 in
the $1m Mercedes Championship at rain-sodden la Costa in San Diego
yesterday.
Elkington also won this title in 1992, when the event was called the
Tournament of Champions, by beating Brad Faxon at the first extra hole.
So he is becoming something of a master at these play-offs and this one
was especially rewarding -- in addition to the first prize of $180,000,
he won a brand new sports car worth perhaps $50,000. Lietzke picked up
$108,000 as runner-up, while Bill Glasson finished with a 67 to earn
$68,000.
But if the 32-year-old Aussie was the big winner, the loser was his
regular Scottish caddie David Renwick, who also carries for Jose Maria
Olazabal. Due to immigration difficulties over his visa, the Scot was
unable to get clearance in time for this tournament.
The Australian had to recruit a temporary caddie, ''Gypsy'' Grillo,
who was fortunate enough to carry Elkington's bag to victory. Exact
rewards to caddies are unclear but it is understood that the unlucky
Scot could have carried off up to 8% -- $14,400 -- had he been at the
Australian's side as usual.
John Huston, who had started the day with a four-shot lead over Fred
Couples and Craig Stadler, twice hit into water -- driving into a stream
at the fifth to take a double-bogey 6 and rolling his approach putt into
the lake at the short seventh. He quickly sank out of sight and Couples,
eight under after six, assumed the lead only to get twitchy on the
greens and miss several easy chances.
The 43-year-old Lietzke, who would have loved to have won the car as
he is an automobile fanatic, threw the title and the vehicle away by
dropping a stroke at the 569-yard seventeenth.
But when the play-off commenced he showed a lot of grit by holing from
six feet for a par 4 after both men had been bunkered behind the green
at the first extra hole, the 450-yard tenth. The Australian exploded to
two feet.
It was on to the 180-yard eleventh, where Elkington struck his
masterly putt to win this prestigious title.
John Daly was ''absolutely delighted'' with a final 69, having
improved his card round by round. ''I just didn't want to finish last
here after such a long lay-off,'' said Daly, who plays in Hawaii this
coming week. Final scores:
278 -- S Elkington (Australia) 69, 71, 71, 67; B Lietzke 71, 69, 71,
67. Elkington won at second extra hole for $180,000; Lietzke $108,000.
279 -- B Glasson 70, 69, 73, 67 ($68,000).
280 -- C Stadler 71, 65, 73, 71 ($48,000).
281 -- B Crenshaw 71, 67, 75, 68; T Lehman 75, 68, 72, 66; R Fehr 71,
74, 70, 66; F Couples 73, 68, 68, 72.
282 -- L Janzen 72, 63, 76, 71; J Huston 67, 66, 72, 77.
283 -- S Hoch 74, 67, 73, 69.
Others included:
284 -- H Irwin 73, 69, 72, 70, C Pavin 74, 71, 69, 70.
286 -- M McCumber 70, 72, 72, 72.
288 -- G Norman (Australia) 74, 72, 72, 70.
289 -- P Mickelson 72, 73, 71, 73.

PALACEGATE King, trained in the Borders by permit-holder Alister
Whillans, landed the most valuable race of his career when at Haydock on
Saturday, he triumphed against more fancied rivals in the #10,000
Northern Handicap Hurdle in rain-softened ground.
Three times a winner on the all-weather for trainer Jack Berry, he had
won four hurdle races -- all on heavy going -- before this latest
success, and had not been out of the first two in his last six outings.
Although the winning margin was just two lengths, Palacegate King left
the opposition for dead as he quickened away from the last, and was
being eased down by conditional jockey Brian Harding approaching the
line.
Never out of the first three, the six-year-old gelding revelled in the
mud and was suited by the strong pace set by top-weight Kadastrof.
Surrey Dancer, the 13-8 favourite and winner of a big handicap for
Mary Reveley at Aintree in November, failed to strike a serious blow,
and the same could be said about Jenny Pitman's Salwan, ridden by
champion jockey Richard Dunwoody.
Palacegate King, a 15-2 chance, and Kadastroff jumped the second-last
together but the Borders' horse found another gear and was three lengths
ahead at the last.
The first prize of #6947 was his biggest so far and brings Palacegate
King's total winnings over hurdles to almost #15,000. He won at Hexham
seven weeks ago and his next race will be at Carlisle a week today.
Owned by the trainer's father, Charlie, he cost 2000 guineas at the
Doncaster Sales. ''He's so small,'' said the trainer. ''When I saw him
first I thought my father had bought a pony.''
Whillans was leading Scottish permit-holder last season with six
winners and with three successes so far, has a lead of one over Dawn
Goodfellow, Jack Andrews and his brother, Donald, in race for The
Herald's permit-holders award.
Donald, whose Barney Rubble won a novice chase at Ayr on Boxing Day,
has another promising prospect in Peter, who ran impressively at Haydock
on Saturday finishing fifth to My Rosini in the Garstang Hurdle.
Len Lungo's Forbidden Time failed to give 6lb to Martin Pipe's runner
Big Strand in the Makerfield Hurdle and went down to the 10-11 favourite
by 14 lengths.
Tartan Tyrant, owned by David Stevenson and trained by Gordon
Richards, remains on course for the Grand National after an impressive
performance in winning the New Year Chase.

MARYHILL Harriers reverted to the traditional first Saturday in
January for their Nigel Barge Trophy 4[1/2]-mile road race, and almost
doubled last year's field.
But the winner, Tommy Murray, insisted that if they wish to develop
the event they must dramatically improve the prize list.
The three-times Scottish national cross-country champion declined a
set of six crystal glasses, valued at #45, after winning the race at his
first attempt. ''They were giving better prizes in the race raffle than
I received for winning.
''I was so annoyed I handed the glasses back. Nobody seems to realise
how much effort top runners devote. Such a paltry prize is an insult.
Vouchers, or cash prizes should be offered, to ensure top runners
appear.''
Murray won by more than 30 seconds from Charlie Thomson, after the
runners had been directed off course at the entrance to Dawsholm Park,
shortening the trail.
The women's race went to Aussie Kylie Porter, from Geelong. Porter,
who won the Portobello Promethon last weekend, finished almost 90
seconds clear. Results:
Men: 1, T Murray (IBM Spango Valley) 25mins 15secs; 2, C Thomson
(Cambuslang) 25-45; 3, T Johnston (Irvine) 26-00; 4, A Robertson
(Cambuslang) 26-03; 5, B Kirkwood (LDRC) 26-21; 6, S Gilmore (Victoria

3, Shettleston 53. Women: 1, K Porter (Australia) 29-50; 2, S Kennedy
(Victoria Park, under-20) 31-18; 3, A Sym (City of Glasgow) 31-37.

IT took more than 24 hours before Irish eyes could smile after the
formality of two Kenyan victories in Saturday's World Cross
international meeting in Belfast.
But these Irish eyes were gazing on to Kenya's Western Highlands as I
conveyed the result yesterday, by telephone, to Brother Colm O'Connell
at his home in the town of Iten.
Victories by O'Connell's proteges, world 5000 metres track champion
Ismael Kirui, and female compatriot Rose Cheruiyot, had done nothing to
comfort organisers of the Coca Cola international, who were angered by
the late withdrawal of Ireland's European cross-country champion,
Catherina McKiernan, and disappointed that their European track
champion, Sonia O'Sullivan, could not be persuaded to run.
But at least the Irish can console themselves with the knowledge that
Kenya's current world domination of endurance running -- on road, track,
and country -- can be laid at the door of O'Connell, a rubicund
Chesterton-style figure, Patrician brother turned athletics coach.
Kirui's victory, in 23min 21sec, left Robert Quinn, best of the Scots
despite a throat infection, a distant twenty-ninth (twelfth Briton).
Kirui restricted his winning margin, as he had done a year earlier, to
just one second, over Zimbabwe's Philemon Hanneck, the Commonwealth
5000m runner-up.
''It was not very difficult,'' confessed the 5ft 2ins Kirui
disarmingly, admitting he had trained hard on all but one of the
intervening days since his success at Durham a week earlier.
''It's not good if the camera is on just one runner at the front,''
added the precocious 19-year-old soldier who won the world 5000m title
at 18, and who just a month ago, was travelling the 50 miles from his
home in Marakwet to train with O'Connell.
But the runaway double in the women's race may be more significant,
heralding the dawn of an era of Kenyan female domination.
O'Connell's athletics role, while headmaster of the all-male St
Patrick's High School in Iten, was revealed in these columns some years
ago.
He arrived from County Cork in 1976 never having even been to an
athletics meeting. The first person he met was Peter Foster, the brother
of UK internationalist Brendan, who explained running's status in local
life.
The list of stars whom O'Connell has guided, a Who's Who of athletics,
includes most of Kenya's champions over two decades.
''Last year, I asked to be relieved of my job as head teacher at St
Patrick's to concentrate more on female athletics,'' he said. He now
coaches at several girls' schools. ''Running here used to be for girls,
rather than women. Fathers would discourage it. But education, and
Westernisation, have changed things. Daughters now have a value beyond
bride price.
''The amount would depend on a daughter's education, but a prospective
bridegroom would certainly pay for a daughter's hand in marriage. In
this pastoral community, that would be measured in livestock -- cows,
sheep, or goats. A bride might be valued at 15-20 cows.''
Cheruiyot, just 19, and due to return next week after the next event
on the worldwide grand prix, at Amorebieta, with her winnings and
appearance money, will soon be able to measure her worth in the stock
market, rather than the cattle market. She is perhaps O'Connell's best
female discovery yet.
She obliterated the best in Europe at Durham on Hogmanay, forcing
McKiernan to rest, and on Saturday, the European bronze medallist,
Romanian Elena Fidatov, was third, 24 seconds adrift. Runner-up,
Catherine Kirui, sister of the men's winner, is another O'Connell
recruit.
Cheruiyot, though still eligible for the world junior championship in
March (she was runner-up to another O'Connell girl, Sally Barsosio, last
year) will do the senior event. ''She is certainly capable of winning,''
said O'Connell.
China's Wang Xiujie, from Laoning Province, but not a member of Ma
Junren's now disbanded army, finished sixth. Her coach, Wang Bin,
admitted Xiujie runs 190 miles per week, training twice a day, seven
days a week.
But foreign performances in this, final major domestic international
before the world event at Durham in March, will provide Britain with
food for thought. Andrea Wallace was fourth while Marlene Gemmell, of
Strathkelvin Ladies, ran outstandingly on her senior cross-country
debut, finishing twenty-first, tenth UK finisher.
Great Britain coach, Bud Baldaro was impressed: '''Marlene has a
chance of making our world team, if she keeps improving.''
Sue Ridley (Edinburgh Woollen Mill) finished five places behind, in
her first cross-country race since November. Hill-runner Helene
Diamantides (Westerlands), making her Scotland country debut at 30,
found the muddy 4800 metres course a touch on the short side. She still
holds the record for racing from Mount Everest base camp to Katmandu --
164 miles, 44,000 feet descent, 36,000 ascent.
Almost as tough as the mountain Brits must climb to catch the Kenyans.
Results:
Men (8000 metres) -- 1, I Kirui (Kenya) 23min 21sec; 2, P Hanneck
(Zimbabwe) 23-22; 3, James Kariuki (Kenya) 23-45; 29, R Quinn 25-02; 38,
G Wight 25-17; 40, A Callan 25-22.
Women (4800m): 1, R Cheruiyot 15-17; 2, C Kirui (both Kenya) 16-02; 3,
E Fidatov (Romania) 16-19; 21, M Gemmell 17-26; 26, S Ridley 17-39; 44,
H Diamantides 18-46.

BRIAN McLaughlin is a player who has mastered the lost art. The Celtic
winger has poise, balance and skill. He can take the ball up to an
opponent, send him in the wrong direction, and create space or even a
goal-scoring opportunity. Not a lot of people can do that.
The 20-year-old is an individualist who can transport us all back to
an era when his kind were available in greater abundance. He is, as
Celtic's assistant manager Billy Stark says, a throwback. He is also in
great danger.
McLaughlin is so slight of build and short of inches that his future
in an environment in which bullies and thugs have been encouraged to
roam has to be in doubt, and I suspect the youngster, despite his
wondrous gifts, will be bludgeoned into despair. Perhaps even
submission. The premier division is not the ideal place for Celtic's
latest prodigy.
The Stark description is apt, and his concern for the little fellow is
not misplaced. The course of the game's development has left behind the
little man, the Jimmy Johnstone or Willie Henderson type, because
today's football demands a certain physique and power. It isn't everyone
whose genes will transform him into a skilled performer perfectly suited
to the rigours of modern play.
Many if the game's students would regard Ruud Gullit, an athletic 6ft
1ins Dutchman, as the prototype for the front-line player of tomorrow,
but it isn't necessary to be his height to succeed, although anyone
under, say 5ft 10ins, should have considerable body strength in the way
that Diego Maradona, before he became bloated, was made. With his low
centre of gravity and powerful thighs and torso, the Argentinian could
ride a tackle or take one head-on when necessary.
McLaughlin has a low centre of gravity, of course, but he is missing
the muscular frame, although it is in his favour that he is a winger
and, therefore, will not be required to drive into midfield seeking
possession by making tackles or doing anything so uncouth and alien to
someone with his much more subtle talents. He shouldn't expect an easy
ride and much will depend on his own courage.
Much will also depend on the protection he is given by referees, who
must have as a priority the need to look after genuine players.
And when the culprits find themselves before the SFA's disciplinary
committee they should be dealt with harshly, because it is the
dangerous, over-physical player who should be driven out of the game and
not McLaughlin or anyone like him.
Football is a peculiar industry, in that those born with attributes
which can enhance the product are allowed to be abused by others almost
completely devoid of skill. If McLaughlin is not to become another
Graeme Payne then the authorities and his own team-mates must offer
protection.
Payne was one of the most gifted talents in Scottish football in the
late 70s and early 80s, but he didn't survive. The Dundee United player
was too lightweight and his manager, Jim McLean, who was calling for
greater protection for footballers even then, reluctantly had to
dispense with his services. It was a loss, and a decade on the same
mistake should not be repeated with McLaughlin.
''I think we will all have to help him,'' said Charlie Nicholas, one
of the elder statesmen at Celtic Park. ''Players like myself can teach
him certain little tricks which might help him avoid serious trouble.
''We should be entitled to expect referees to protect Brian's type,
but he will have to take some hard kicks along the way.''
Nicholas added. ''Look at Laudrup. Everyone is talking about him, and
rightly so, and here we have a player of our own who could be developed
into something really exciting. The game should be saying, 'hold on, we
have a skill here, so let's protect it.' ''
Now, there's the rub. Jim Farry and anyone else can say all they like,
but is Scottish football -- and, in particular, the managers who are
responsible for the proliferation of neanderthals in studded boots --
ready yet to play the game properly? If they are not, McLaughlin will
suffer, and his demise would be a damaging indictment.
If we are ready to embrace the future, the game's true ideals, then
let's give people like Brian McLaughlin a hand. He's just a little
thing, but he could be part of a big future.

THERE was a time when clubs dreaded visiting Pittodrie and to win a
point was cause for celebration.
Now, teams like Falkirk are boarding the bus home complaining that
they should have won and are disappointed with a draw.
It did appear that Aberdeen, languishing at the wrong end of the
premier division, were starting to drag their way out of trouble over
the festive period with draws against Celtic and Dundee United and
victory over Hearts, but their performance against the Bairns ended with
jeers from the home support.
The fans will make allowances for injuries, they will show patience,
they will accept that Falkirk's main aim was not to lose, but canny
Aberdonians want value for their money -- and they were denied that.
But for an uncharacteristic miss by Eddie May, Falkirk would have won
and, as Aberdeen only had two shots on target throughout the game, they
would have deserved the three points.
John Clark and John Hughes were a match for anything that was sent
high into the box and, up front, Colin McRonald and May posed problems
for the Dons.
Falkirk coped well with the early loss of defender Joe McLaughlin, who
suffered a calf injury.
May had the best opportunity of the match after 15 minutes when, aided
by David Weir and McRonald, he rounded the Aberdeen defence and had only
Theo Snelders to beat but shot wide.
''I should have scored,'' he said. ''I can't believe I missed. It was
on my left foot, my weaker side, but I should still have scored.''
Falkirk had another opportunity in the second half when Weir was left
unmarked to head in a Fulton free kick but he directed it straight to
Snelders.
The frustration continued for Aberdeen's Billy Dodds, who has now gone
seven games without a goal. He hit the bar in the first half and, in the
second, did well to hook an Inglis pass towards goal but it skimmed
over.
Whether out-of-favour striker Eoin Jess might have been able to inject
some imagination into the Dons' attack was hard to gauge. He replaced
Ray McKinnon with 10 minutes to go leaving him little time to settle
into the game.
One of the encouraging aspects for Aberdeen was the performance of
young Stephen Glass at left back.
He won the praise of manager Willie Miller, who admitted a lack of
''killer instinct up front'' had cost them the opportunity to climb the
league.
However, Falkirk manager Jim Jefferies said: ''I felt the team played
well and had the best chances. Although Aberdeen had a bit more pressure
in the second half, they found it hard to break us down.''

LOTS of running, some exquisite touches, and a great deal of
commitment, but Celtic could do no more than accept one point. It was
just another Saturday.
Celtic's draw against Dundee United at Hampden was their twelfth in 20
premier division matches, but at the risk of beginning to sound like
Tommy Burns and his assistant, Billy Stark, there is cause for hope.
Burns' younger players continue to impress and the team's general play
has about it again a width, which means chances are being created. The
downside, of course, is that these opportunities continue to be
squandered, although that may be about to change with the introduction
of a large Dutchman, Pierre van Hooydonk.
A goalscorer will not cure all Celtic's ills -- the team requires
perhaps as many as five new players -- but adding a cutting edge to the
play has always been the manager's priority. Knowing that Celtic were in
possession of a player capable of putting the ball in the net would make
other sides more respectful again and a confidence would spread through
Burns' people.
He produced one on Saturday, Jim Slavin, who made his debut at the
heart of the defence and later spoke about the experience with the
almost weary air of a seasoned campaigner. ''I found out about 11am on
Saturday morning that I would be playing against United,'' he said,
''and it was a good experience.
''I had played against Craig Brewster in the reserves and so I knew
what to expect from him. I wouldn't say he caused me any great
problems.''
Brewster, in fact, didn't go the distance and was taken off, which
tends to suggest Slavin, who will be 20 in a fortnight, did his job
better than the United striker. ''I can't say I had any problems either
with the pace of the game and I believe that when a younger player gets
a chance like this it offers hope for others.''
Burns has said often enough that because of Celtic's circumstances and
injuries -- five or six players were unavailable on Saturday -- they
have become a club of opportunity for young players. So far it is fair
to say Brian McLaughlin and Stuart Gray have grabbed their chances and
both looked the part again on Saturday.
In fact, with Gray at left full back, but always seeking to push
forward, and McLaughlin on the same flank Celtic are becoming
particularly strong in that area and are able to cause problems. Some of
McLaughlin's work and deliveries into the box were enticing, but the old
failing allowed the balls to drift free.
On the other side, Paul Byrne hurled in some excellent crosses, but
his contributions also were given safe passage.
''It is another draw and if anyone wants to take a negative look at
that then that's up to them,'' said Burns, ''but I have to look at the
positive things. I'm delighted again with the young players. McLaughlin
did well, Gray, too, and Slavin has given me food for thought.''
Yet, Celtic almost went indoors at the break a goal down. United had
taken the lead in nine minutes -- and Alex Cleland's goal was stunning.
Maurice Malpas played a cross into Celtic's box, Brian O'Neil passed the
ball out, but only to Cleland, who met the gift perfectly and from 22
yards his shot beat Pat Bonner at his top left-hand corner.
The first half had run to 46 minutes when John Collins found himself
in possession inside United's box after the Tannadice side had been
shoddy in defending a throw-in. Andy Walker backheeled through Gordan
Petric's legs and Collins, with his right foot, did the rest.
He glanced up and, from just inside the box, curled the ball away to
Kelham O'Hanlon's left. The ball sailed gently into the corner of the
net.
Two wonderful goals and some moments of subtlety, but that was about
it in an otherwise prosaic match. At least Celtic know they will get
better while United cannot be so sure.
Ivan Golac's side are toiling and hardly inspiring confidence among
their supporters, who are alarmed by the gulf which seems to exist
between the manager and the board of directors. Perhaps the start of
another Scottish Cup run will shake them out of their lethargy and bring
all factions together again. Then again, perhaps not.

WHEN the last shot had been fired and the smoke had cleared, the body
count of fallen giants from a Saturday afternoon of 28 FA Cup
third-round ties was found to be unexpectedly small.
There lay Ipswich Town, slain by the upstart Welshmen of Wrexham, but
as Leeds United, Coventry, and one or two others limped safely away, it
soon became clear the traditional mayhem of the first Saturday in
January had been avoided.
So headlines like Wrecked 'em, which dominated the back pages three
years ago after a stunning defeat of Arsenal, were resurrected to
celebrate what manager Bryan Flynn felt was an even worthier triumph.
In 1992, the Welsh seemed as shocked as anyone by the manner in which
Arsenal's defence suddenly caved in after they had been sitting
comfortably on a 1-0 lead. This time, in a game of better sustained
football, Wrexham lost their deserved lead with six minutes to play,
then dramatically regained it with a goal from Gary Bennett, the leading
Endsleigh League scorer this season.
Bennett's nerve held from the penalty spot, and Ipswich's new manager,
George Burley, once a cup winner with them, was left to concentrate, as
they say, on the league.
Arsenal survived in a goalless draw at Millwall, where they have been
fortunate winners twice in recent years. In their present uncertain
predicament, they will not take the replay for granted, though former
Celtic man Mick McCarthy must know that his team's best chance has been
missed.
Liverpool, so often Arsenal's opponents in the later stages of various
cup competitions, were equally happy to escape from Birmingham with a
0-0 draw. The good times are returning to the poor relations of
England's second city under the ebullient Barry Fry -- the man who used
to be sacked approximately twice a week by Stan Flashman when manager of
Barnet.
Leeds United, who have never lived up to their supporters' hopes since
winning the championship in 1992, looked for a long while like becoming
the biggest names to fall. Already knocked out of the Coca-Cola Cup by
Mansfield Town, they faced similar embarrassment at Walsall's smart new
stadium until Gary McAllister fashioned a late equaliser for defender
David Wetherall. The late strike in Coventry's local derby with West
Bromwich Albion had the opposite effect, allowing the first division
side a 1-1 draw. Fourth-round draw:
Sheffield United or Manchester United v Wrexham; Millwall or Arsenal v
Chelsea; Bury or Tranmere Rovers v Wimbledon; Notts County or Manchester
City v Aston Villa; Nottingham Forest v Crystal Palace; Portsmouth v
Leicester City; Coventry City or West Bromwich Albion v Norwich City;
Queen's Park Rangers v West Ham United; Luton Town or Bristol Rovers v
Southampton; Newcastle United or Blackburn Rovers v Swansea City or
Middlesbrough; Sheffield Wednesday v Wolverhampton Wanderers; Walsall or
Leeds United v Oldham Athletic; Sunderland or Carlisle v Tottenham
Hotspur; Scarborough or Watford v Swindon Town; Burnley v Birmingham
City or Liverpool; Bristol City or Stoke City v Everton.
(Ties to be played January 28, 29, and 30).

MARSEILLE have been instructed to find a solution to their #12m debts
-- or be forcibly relegated. That was the sanction taken by the French
football association in the aftermath of the infamous bribes' case
involving Valenciennes easing Marseille's way to the championship.
Since winning the European Championship two years ago, the club have
been devastated by seemingly-endless revelations of financial abuses,
and former owner Bernard Tapie left bankrupt and banned from public
office.
An ultimatum has been issued by the French FA's financial commission
that a satisfactory business plan to put the club in the black must be
tabled by the end of the month.
If this is not forthcoming, Marseille will be demoted to the third
division. If promotion is won, and a powerful challenge is being made in
this direction, the club will remain in their present league.
Recently-appointed coach Henri Stambouli, who has been joined by Luca
Peruzovic who had a spell with Anderlecht, lamented: ''How can players
be motivated with such a prospect awaiting? This club was the first to
bring a European trophy to this country, but it seems no-one now cares
about that achievement.
''I do not know how we can possibly avoid this latest punishment. All
our best players have already been sold. You are now about to witness
the destruction of this club.''
* BARCELONA have agreed to sell their controversial Brazilian star,
Romario, to Flamengo, this week in a #2.7m deal.
Patience with the World Cup-winning striker was exhausted in the Nou
Camp club when he arrived back from a festive break in his homeland
unfit to play in Saturday's crucial match with Real Madrid, which they
lost 5-0.
Romario, disciplined for arriving a month late in Barcelona for the
start of the season, has shown little interest and even less of his
undoubted genius, scoring only four goals.
Flamengo president Kleber Leite announced yesterday: ''Romario is
homesick and also has personal and emotional problems. After the
Christmas break he decided not to take his family back to Spain.''
Romario added that he expected to be with Flamengo by Wednesday if
tranfer negotiations continued smoothly.
Coach Johan Cruyff, who had a troubled relationship with Romario, will
now move for fellow Dutchman Dennis Bergkamp as a replacement.
Former Barcelona player, Michael Laudrup, masterminded Madrid's
triumph. Barca defender Ronald Koeman insisted: ''He was simply
magnificent and should never have been sold.
''He and his brother Brian never got the respect they deserved, but
look what they are achieving at Madrid and Rangers. They are among the
best.''
* PARIS St Germain keeper Bernard Lama has been voted
player-of-the-year in France.
* AMERICAN sportswear company, Nike, has agreed a sponsorship deal
with the Italian national team worth #4.18m.

IT was a tough weekend for Elgin City's management team. Everything
had seemed to be in hand when they lined up former Dundee and Raith
goalkeeper Tom Carson as stand-in for suspended regular Craig
Hinchcliffe.
At least, it did until 10pm on Friday night when they discovered that
Carson had signed for Dumbarton.
City finally landed ex-Cowdenbeath man Steve O'Hanlan from Dundee St
Josephs, and he gave a fine display as City and Brora Rangers fought out
a 0-0 draw.
Falkirk are the latest club to express an interest in the highly-rated
Hinchcliffe, although Huddersfield are expected to contact City today to
arrange a trial.
The 0-0 draw did little for either City or Brora's title ambitions,
and Lossiemouth were also unable to capitalise on the absences of
Huntly, Keith and Cove on Scottish Cup duty, finishing goalless with
Fraserburgh.
Peterhead dumped Forres 5-1, Scott Shepherd scoring twice, with Derek
Smith, John McGachie and Bruce Campbell also on the mark. Alex Grant
scored for Forres.
Nairn County upset Clach 2-0 to record their third win of the season
-- Steve Murray and Paul Ross netting.
Fort William claimed their second-consecutive win with a 4-0
demolition of Wick Academy. Ian Polworth hit a double, and Neil McBeath
and Finlay Shearer added singles.
Chris Pilichos looked to have given Rothes only their second win of
the season, but Deveronvale player/manager Kevin Bremner equalised 19
minutes from time.
Keith have used only one keeper in the last five years -- but this
week they face a desperate search for a replacement before lining up for
a second Scottish Cup crack at rivals Huntly.
Regular keeper Ian Thain was playing his 208th consecutive game in the
all-Highland 2-2 thriller, but he suffered broken ribs in a clash with
Huntly striker Gary Whyte and now faces several weeks on the sidelines.
Stalwart Thain had not missed a game for five years and a day, and to
add to Keith's misery they have just sold his understudy, Neil Nicol, to
Forres.
Huntly took the lead through Gary Whyte in 13 minutes, then Brian
Thomson bulleted home a header to make it two in 33 minutes.
Keith missed a penalty through Kevin Will and had Thain replaced in
goal by striker Andy Lavelle -- but got a seventy-third minute lifeline
when Doug Rougvie mis-headed a corner into his own net. Then Neil
Thomson hit a stunning injury time equaliser to set up a replay at
Huntly this Saturday.
Furious Huntly boss Steve Paterson blasted: ''Keith had the odds
stacked against them, but showed the pride and the passion that the
Scottish Cup is all about. We are very lucky to be still in the cup.''
But both sides reckon success in the replay offers a great chance to
progress further as Burntisland Shipyard await the winners in the third
round.

SOMETIMES we have to make excuses, in the interests of fairness. The
weather can be foul, the pitch difficult, the pressures great. Other
times we just have to tell it like it was.
And woeful is about right to describe the Firhill fare served up by
Partick Thistle and Rangers. Afterwards, the word heard all over the
place was ''battle,'' followed closely by ''commitment.''
If you like that kind of entertainment then you were in clover but, if
you still harbour a notion for what is subtle, skilful and instinctive,
it would have been sensible to turn your back and look out at Firhill
St. You might even have seen a couple of wee lads knocking a ball about.
Happy memories.
Rangers manager Walter Smith, perhaps diplomatically, called it
''scrappy,'' and no-one could remember more than three or four efforts
at goal. Noise there was in abundance, especially in the last few
minutes, sweat poured out of every forehead and honest endeavour could
not be a faulted.
Smith had suggested on Friday that the latter part of the season might
be dominated by hard contests against teams desperate to avoid the drop
into the first division. He was right, but his own team contributed as
little in the way of skill as Thistle who, the way things are in the
league, know that they can only match the top teams with willingess and
industry and hope that they will negate their opponents' superior
quality in so doing.
On that basis their manager, John Lambie, was entitled to be more
satisfied than Smith, although he would have been really pleased if his
team had sneaked a winner, rather than finish at 1-1. Even so, for a
side at the very bottom of the table, this was a worthy show of . . .
er, commitment.
Their full back, Alan Dinnie, put into words what players in a side in
this predicament must do. ''I have been in this situation twice with
Dundee and it is a hell of a job getting out of it. The only way is to
battle like we did today in every game from now on. But it is no good
doing it against the Rangers and Celtics if we don't do it when we meet
the Falkirks and Kilmarnocks.
''In fact, we were sick that we didn't take three points, because we
felt we took the game to Rangers. But if we play like that we are
confident we will get out of this position.''
In a sense that was not quite accurate. Both teams took the game to
the centre of the park and left it there.
The consequence was a constant midfield scrap, which neither side
really won. As a result, the defences were rarely strained, and in John
Brown, making his first start since August, Rangers had a star turn,
perhaps bettered only by Steve Welsh in the opposite defence.
Smith was not interested in citing the makeshift line-up he was fored
to produce as an exuse for a mediocre performance. But when you have to
pick a team without Richard Gough, Basile Boli, Charlie Miller, Mark
Hateley, Ally McCoist, Brian Laudrup and Gordon Durie you are
considerably restricted, even at Ibrox.
The injury sustained by Andy Goram after 29 minutes was a further blow
and increased the sensation that this was a bit like a Rangers 'B' team.
It was a tough afternoon to bring in a new lad, even one as big and
strong as Brian McGinty, who was 19 last month. If nothing else, the
young striker discovered how little time a player gets to make a move in
these games, and the experience will have been helpful.
''We think he is a better midfield player than a striker and it was
not an easy day for a new boy,''said Smith.
Nothing much happened in the first half, but there was a bit more
liveliness about the second period, when Thistle were looking the more
likely side until David Robertson stepped in with a fine right-foot shot
to put Rangers ahead 12 minutes from the end.
That lifted the Jags on to a new plane of energy and they earned their
reward seven minutes later with an equaliser from Alex Taylor.
The Ibrox fans kept up their special disaffection with Chic Charnley,
but one or two went too far and he was hit by a coin as he prepared to
take a corner.
Rangers could afford to drop a couple of points, Thistle needed
anything they could get. Nobody was a winner, least of all the paying
customers.

FABRIZIO Ravanelli hit two goals in four minutes to help Juventus
knock Parma off the top of Serie A with a 3-1 victory yesterday.
Juventus, unbeaten in eight matches, now have a two point lead and a
game in hand over Parma, second on 31 points, while Roma are on 27.
Dino Baggio gave Parma the lead against the run of play in 57 minutes,
but within four minutes, Juventus equalised when Parma goalkeeper
Giovanni Galli misjudged a cross from Paolo Sousa and could only watch
the ball sail into the net.
Ravanelli put Juventus in front after 70 minutes, stooping to head
home a low cross from Gianluca Vialli. The same player scored his second
from the penalty spot after he had been fouled by defender Luigi
Apolloni.
To complete a bad start to the year for Parma, Portuguese defender
Fernando Couto was sent off.
Elsewhere, Abel Balbo's eighth goal of the season and a late effort
from Francesco Totti lifted Roma into third spot with a 2-0 win over
Bari.
Fiorentina slipped to a 1-0 defeat at Torino. Vanni Pessotto
celebrated Torino's 2000th match in Serie A with his first goal in the
division.
AC Milan's poor run continued when a last-minute mistake by goalkeeper
Sebastiano Rossi allowed Fabio Cannavaro to salvage a 1-1 draw for
Napoli.
Roberto Muzzi played hero and villain in Cagliari's 1-1 draw with
Internazionale. He conceded the penalty which let Ruben Sosa give Inter
the lead, but then equalised.

So, to make their Glasgow phonebook less unwieldy for the disabled,
etc, British Telecom is to issue it in two parts (January 5).
The Concise Oxford English Dictionary has about 2000 pages and is
published in two volumes, first part of the alphabet (A to Markworthy)
and second part (Marl to Z).
There is no uncertainty or ambiguity in this system for those who know
the alphabet all the way from A to Z -- perhaps a diminishing band in
these QWERTY days.
This ridiculous north of the Clyde/south of the Clyde division must
certainly have been selected to reduce convenience and increase charges
for BT's directory service.
Long ago all the telephone directories were available for consultation
(free) in the GPO in George Square, Glasgow.
Now they are gone and the sets of directories in libraries tend to be
out of order, incomplete, and of course with no directory of
directories.
Admittedly, one can get any telephone number in the country amazingly
quickly by ringing BT, and being charged a fee.

The recent suggestion by a Scottish American architect that the return
of the Queen Mary to Scotland would be a wonderful focus for our Year of
Architecture was quickly spurned by Pat Lally on the grounds of cost,
feasibility, and the possible unrewarding nature of the project.
It may be that the cost would be prohibitive, that the Panama Canal or
a silted-up River Clyde would see the great liner stuck in the middle,
or indeed those who cry, ''Don't, it has never been done before,'' may
have their way, but before considering all the impracticalities of this
venture surely a feasibility study is called for.
The crowds of people who swamped Port Glasgow and Greenock when the
QEII docked overnight was thrilling to observe, albeit that it was a
short visit, but to have The Mary permanently docked in the Upper
Reaches would be some compensation for a permanent garden festival site
that wasn't to be.
What would we use it for? I leave that to the imagination of the
citizens of Glasgow, and indeed all Scots. Let's go for it.

December 28.
A man without a face cannot be recognised, nor can a country without a
face. That country is Scotland, and it makes a huge difference to every
citizen.
It was reported recently that 150 Scottish businessmen met to discuss
what could be done about Scotland's out-of-date image as a place of old
castles, whisky, and kilts, and not much else.
The answer is the same as it has been for many generations: nothing --
as long as Scotland stands in the shadow of another country. Not even
the Scottish Tourist Board is permitted by the English-run Government to
function outwith Scotland. This is an impossible situation.
Today factories can be built in any corner of the world, and that
means jobs and prosperity. But there is a great deal more to consider
than dependable labour.
Every aspect of Scottish life is part of the quality of life, its
image, its face.
Neeme Jarvi, one of the few world-class orchestral conductors on the
scene today, assessed the Scottish National Orchestra as ''one of the
top 10 orchestras in the world, alongside the big German and Austrian
orchestras.''
Does this mean that Scotland's image is enhanced by the many good
recordings (try their Dvorak) that he made with the orchestra? No.
One expects the rampant English chauvinists at the English-run BBC to
push those aside in favour of mundane performances by English
orchestras.
But would WQXR, the classical radio station of the New York Times,
broadcast a major work by Jarvi and the orchestra in prime evening time?
No. Merit is not what counts in the real world. Image, face, is what
counts.
The reasoning is, how can all that sophistication relate to kilts and
bagpipes and whisky? In the public eye they do not come together.
It is possible to hear an adequate but inferior orchestra from Sweden
because Sweden with a population of eight million has a recognisable
face and presence in the world.
For three decades after the Second World War Scotland also had the
world's best fine art painters. Their merit died because it could not be
presented on the world stage.
One hears people say that they do not care whether they are Scottish
or British citizens. These well-meaning people are out of touch with
reality. Their myopia is terminal.
As long as 5,000,000 Scots are content to munch through their tatties
and hamburgers, there will be no change of face. That will delight the
English Conservatives.

January 4.
You report that in Aberdeen Union Street is celebrating its 200th
anniversary this year (December 30). But why is it doing so nine years
too soon?
Union Street, a nineteenth-century Georgian classic, was formally
opened for traffic on George III's 65th birthday, June 4, 1803. The
foundation stone of its principal chunk of infrastructure, Union Bridge,
was laid on July 7, 1801.
Plans for its construction were sought by January 1, 1801. The
trustees who brought it into being first met on June 3, 1800, the Act of
Parliament appointing them and empowering them having received the royal
assent on April 4, 1800.
So why spend a small fortune of money both public and private
celebrating its bicentenary in 1994? A local academic has claimed that
''at a public meeting in 1794 it was decided to ask the roads surveyor,
Charles Abercrombie, to prepare a report on the best ways of linking
Aberdeen to its hinterland''.
Unfortunately for him, and for Aberdeen, the only public meeting in
that city in 1794, the usual Michaelmas head court, said nothing at all
about either Abercrombie or any new hinterland-linking streets.
So why celebrate in the twentieth century the bicentenary of a
nineteenth-century street? Can Aberdeen District Council no longer
count?
Or has its need for ''bread and circuses'' to divert its citizenry
this year, in the wake of malpractice which you exposed on January 28
last, temporarily overwhelmed its respect for historicial truth, making
its announcement a fortnight ago of #120,000 to fund a new two-volume
history of Aberdeen (dividing at 1800) a mere sop to a guilty
conscience?

SUPPORT for the nine Conservative rebels is holding up well on their
home ground. A poll has found that all have the confidence of local Tory
voters. And, were official Tory candidates to be fielded against them in
a General Election, the rebels would continue to fare well enough to
retain the greater part of the Tory vote which would nevertheless split.
Were the rebels to remain unreconciled in a General Election campaign,
their divisive effect would not be confined to their own constituencies.
Indeed the longer the disagreement persists the harder it will be to
contain the trouble, even though the poll discloses the intriguing fact
that Labour is not doing well in the nine seats at the moment (though it
is doing extremely well nationally).
It is important to remember that opinion polls are hypothetical. That
never means that their findings can be dismissed, but it does mean that
faced with the real thing voters do seem, often, to behave differently
from what opinion polls might have led observers to expect. The Tory
rebels remain in the limelight, especially in their own areas where
maladroit efforts to bully them by their party nationally have been
predictably counter-productive. Would they be in the limelight in a
General Election? It hardly seems likely, especially when none is
actually a major political player in his or her own right.
The rebels are generally able and sometimes distinguished, but none
boasts a name likely to be often, or for long, on many lips. They would
almost certainly be swamped in an election which would focus media
attention on the competing merits of Mr Major and Mr Blair; even the
Liberals have in the past found this sort of squeeze to be a major
handicap to their campaigning. A mere nine individuals would almost be
ignored, although their divisive effect on their party could remain very
damaging.
The rebels will be able to show this week just how limited their
independence is when they have the chance of voting to retain Tory
control of the House of Commons' standing committees. They are most
likely to vote in a way which retains their fundamental political
identity. That is certainly the way in which Mr Major regards them, and
it represents the possibility of their making their way back into the
mainstream of the party, though that is a process which is bound to take
time. By trying to focus his own attention on those aspects of Labour
policy with which Tories generally most disagree, Mr Major may make an
eventual accommodation possible, but the fact remains that he is making
no concessions to them. Even the possibility of a referendum on some
aspect of Europe, which might allow rebels to salve their consciences,
remains only a possibility, hardly more substantial than the possibility
that the outcome of the French presidential elections early this summer
may show that public opinion there is moving against any faster
development of Europe's common institutions. It could well be that Mr
Major will be saved from a continuing damaging split in his own party by
the growth of French Euro-scepticism, and also by the effect of the EU
having to digest the former Efta members that are now, except for
Norway, formally in the fold. It looks like a matter of ''ifs'' and
''buts'' rather than a considered strategy, but, if Mr Major has a
better one, it is still up his sleeve.

ONE of the more diverting fantasies about life inside Buckingham
Palace is that after the souvenir shop has been shut, the velvet
curtains drawn, etc, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh indulge in the
proletarian tastes of their subjects. We do not suggest that they are as
excited as the rest of us about Ken and Denise's baby in Coronation
Street, or discuss why Sergeant Cryer is never promoted, but anyone who
can sit through a Royal Variety Show is not at the Wagner end of the
cultural spectrum. It is hardly likely that they send out for fish
suppers. There is a resident chef on duty, and if phoned down for fried
plaice and chips, it would be on their laps in front of the TV in a
matter of minutes. A footman probably leaves a tray at the door, and
they might fetch their own drinks from a fridge disguised as an ormolu
cabinet. Such homely palace suppers are never publicised, of course.
Ever since 1984, however, when Guinness first appeared on Buckingham
Palace's list of Royal Warrant Holders as a supplier of Irish stout,
there has been speculation over which royal might have a delicate line
of creamy foam on their upper lips, and perhaps enjoy a pickled onion.
There is nothing wrong with a taste for what that great Scottish
connoisseur Morton Shand called ''our glorious, our superlative stout.''
He said it was a compensation for English lager. ''Let the name of
Guinness be pronounced with becoming deference!'' he declared.
''Guinness's Draught Stout, which is less gassy and in every way
superior to the bottled, is the only drink to accompany a chop-house
lunch.''  Alas, even such praise as Shand's has not prevented Guinness
being unexpectedly dropped from the 1995 list of royal warrant holders.
They still send Buckingham Palace four brands of whisky and two brands
of gin, of course, but it isn't the same. If the royals no longer enjoy
a glass of Guinness, even with barbecue-flavoured crisps, it is to be
wondered what they now drink with their fish and chips. Champagne tends
to be ruined by the salt and vinegar.

EUROPE is sitting on a pensions ''timebomb'' as a result of
over-dependence on state-financed retirement provision, according to a
report by Federal Trust, a think-tank devoted to the European Union and
Britain's role within it.
The report draws attention to falling birthrates and rising life
expectancy which it says will increase the cost of state pension
provision in most European Union countries to prohibitive levels,
particularly as healthcare costs for the elderly will also rise.
Instead it argues that these countries should follow the UK's example
and promote company and personal pension schemes.
Britain is the odd man out in Europe in that unfinanced pension
liabilities, in other words the state's liability for pensions, is a
relatively modest 70% of gross domestic product, while in France and
Italy for example it is 106% and 184% respectively.
Their pensions are financed nearly exclusively on a pay-as-you-go
basis which means the population in employment is paying all the
pensions of the retired population.
The report goes over familiar ground in suggesting that demographic
trends will make this burden on those in employment unacceptable. Author
Dick Taverne accepts that a wholesale conversion to privately-financed
pensions is unlikely given the political difficulties and the cultural
change involved.
The Maxwell and pension mis-selling scandals in the UK have also
fanned prejudice against a private sector solution. But Mr Taverne calls
for partnership between state pay-as-you-go and privately-financed
schemes.
In a forward to the report, Sir Brian Corby, chairman of Prudential,
said: ''Above all we must not saddle our children and our grandchildren
with burdens they will find difficult to deliver . . . While it may be
alarmist to talk now of a crisis in pensions in Europe, it is realistic
to recognise that such a crisis could occur if we do not take action.''
Development of financed schemes would have the by-product of
increasing the savings rate and, therefore, the funds available for
equity investment. This will improve the liquidity of capital markets,
resulting in cheaper funds and more risk money available for business.
However, it has to be said that the British example is not
encouraging. Despite the much deeper capital markets here, investment by
British industry has consistently lagged behind its competitors largely
because the pension funds have successfully demanded high returns over
short timescales.
The development of a European pensions industry would benefit the City
of London because of its global investment expertise and experience in
running pension funds. At the moment it is hamstrung by the failure of
the European Commission's draft pension fund directive, largely as a
result of concern over the security of pension fund assets.
The Federal Trust suggests a way forward and points out that
community-wide pension schemes would promote mobility of labour.

<HEADLINE>Fledgling Index joins an ever-increasing nest</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>14</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980451474</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER stock market index came on the scene last week. Appropriately
enough for a newcomer it is to be known as the Fledgling Index. It
covers around 800 companies with market capitalisations of less than
#40m, all too small to be included in the FTSE-Actuaries All-Share
Index.
The new benchmark joins at least four other indices focused on the
small end of the market, one of which is Gartmore's newly-created Micro
Index which covers the tiniest 1% of the market and is tracked by
specially voted investment trusts.
Don't be surprised to find this increased scrutiny of how things are
going at the bottom end of the market. The new arrivals in this area
meet the increased interest shown by investors in small companies which
has been prompted by the thought that they are in an economic segment
which is most likely to benefit from the recovery everyone tells us we
are having.
But don't be surprised either to find yet another new index coming on
to the investment scene. Proliferation is the name of the game so far as
indices are concerned. As monitoring and measuring becomes a more
important feature of the fund management arena the number of indices has
exploded.
Looking around at the world investment scene there are more indices
following markets and segments of markets than there are shares quoted
on the London Stock Exchange. Counting in sub-sections and rival indices
covering broadly similar areas they run into thousands.
The UK stock market has 2057 UK companies fully listed plus another
466 foreign companies with UK listings and 211 companies on the USM.
Datastream, the number-crunching and information organisation, however,
carries about 3500 indices. And if you add numbers comparing yields,
volumes and so on you could get up to maybe four times as many.
Datastream, as well as reporting other peoples' indices, also creates
its own in around 30 countries and various centres within them.
For the ordinary investor the broad market indices mentioned in media
coverage of leading stock exchanges are useful in giving a rough idea
not only of which direction that particular market is heading but also
the extent of the day's change.
For the fund manager and investment adviser, however, they are tools
of the trade. The fund manager will have an index or a series of indices
against which he compares his performance. The investment adviser
watches the same things. He will want his clients to be buying into
funds run by people who beat the index. That history has shown it is not
as easy to do as it might sound.
The difficulty has prompted the creation of funds specifically
designed to track particular indices. The idea started in America but is
increasingly popular here too.
HSBC James Capel, for instance, has seven index-tracking funds. These
cover major indices such as the FTSE-100 but also James Capel's own
Trixie Index covering small companies on the UK exchange and Capel's
South-east Asian or ''Tiger'' index. The Tiger covers seven Far Eastern
markets giving weightings of 18% to Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and
Thailand and 9% weightings to South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines.
HSBC says institutional interest in tracker funds continues to grow.
Although the pace has currently slowed a little along with the worldwide
slowdown in share market activity ''we are still seeing very positive
interest across a range of index funds''.
Individual investors are more interested in the UK funds than in
venturing overseas. HSBC sees its FTSE-100 fund as a natural for
investors who quit building societies for shares. ''The first-time
investor is comfortable with the FTSE fund because it includes blue-chip
companies whose names he or she knows well.''
Index tracking could be said to be almost an industry of its own
within the fund management industry. The funds seldom replicate the
index as a whole but pick a basket of shares which are most likely to
mirror the overall performance. It is you might say a science within an
art.
Indices are also big business for the derivatives industry -- the
futures and options players.
Dealing in an index future or option is a quick way of taking a view
on the direction a market is taking or hedging a position you already
have. This business is still growing.
The average daily volume of contracts on FTSE-l00 options on the
London International Financial Futures Market last year was 18,985
against 12,965 in the corresponding period the previous year. Likewise
futures on this key UK index rose from a daily average of 11,893 to
16,737.
The exchange began trading in futures on the mid to 50 Index in
February last year but that has been much slower to take off. Daily
volume averages only 163 contracts so far. But you can bet fund managers
are giving it quite a bit of thought.

EUROPE'S big four economies of the UK, West Germany, Italy and France
are expected to continue to grow in the current year, albeit more slowly
than in 1994 in the case of Britain.
For much of last year the sharp recovery in European economic fortunes
was due to re-stocking and export growth to the rest of the world.
However in 1995, the key to a strengthening recovery will be business
fixed investment.
Capacity utilisation in European industry has now recovered to its
average historical level and is continuing to improve. That combined
with much-improved corporate profits should produce sharply higher
investment in plant and equipment in 1995, despite last year's rise in
long-term interest rates.
Given this favourable economic background it would appear that
European short-term interest rates are close to their trough. Indeed,
Spain pushed up its interest rates last week following similar moves in
the second half of last year from Britain, Italy and Sweden.
The Bank of Spain increased its intervention rate from 7.35% to 8%,
blaming the increase on the need to combat inflation and bolster the
peseta.
Domestic political worries will maintain the pressure on the peseta in
the near term. It, along with other so-called high-yielding currencies
such as the Canadian dollar, Italian lira and Swedish krone, that have
large budgetry imbalances, are viewed negatively by the markets.
The major European currencies of Britain and Italy, namely sterling
and the lira, remain outside the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM).
However, their movements are still closely linked to the fortunes of the
German mark which is effectively the anchor currency in the ERM. As such
the actions of the Bundesbank continue to strongly influence monetary
policy throughout Europe.
The Bundesbank is expected to push up German interest rates this year
although it chose not to rock the Euro-boat by raising rates at last
Thursday's council meeting. City analysts are split on the timing of any
rise in the 4.5% German discount rate and 6.0% Lombard rate, although a
rise could come by April.
There are a number of factors mitigating against an early rate move,
be it up or down. The Bundesbank is not thought likely to alter interest
rates until 1995 wage negotiations are settled, particularly those
involving IG Metall, Germany's most powerful union.
This was acknowledged in recent comments from Bundesbank president
Hans Tietmeyer. He said that although the Bundesbank would not react to
each individual wage and fiscal policy decision, the central vank
council ''will carefully review the results of the wage round in view of
the effects for the whole economy and for price stability''.
If overall wage settlements work out around 3% as expected, the
Bundesbank may choose to keep interest rates at their current level.
Another factor that could stay the Bundesbank's hand in the short term
is the 7.5% ''solidarity tax'' on income and corporation tax, introduced
on January 1. This could slow down German economic growth. The
Bundesbank may also choose to leave policy steady while inflation
continues to fall.
However, future inflation is the Bundesbank's main concern so the
strength of economic growth and its implications for price pressures may
become the key focus of attention.
The dollar is expected to continue to benefit from the strength of the
US economy as evidenced by the publication on Friday of statistics
showing another decline in US unemployment. In December, the
unemployment rate dropped to 5.4% from 5.6% in November.
The consensus view in the Square Mile is that the US unit will start
the year in a positive fashion, rising against both the mark and the
yen, helped additionally by widening interest rate differentials. The
dollar is forecast to continue higher in the first six months of the
year before trailing off in the second half.
The dollar is deemed by currency analysts at Goldman Sachs to be
currently trading quite close to its fundamental equilibria against the
mark, yen and sterling. In their view this reflects the fact that the
medium-term real dollar exchange rates needed to balance the US balance
of payments are not far above present levels.
Rising price pressures, as exemplified by the recent publication of a
report from the National Association of Purchasing Managers, appear to
make it inevitable that the US Federal Reserve will raise US interest
rates by at least half-a-point by the end of this month. This will help
to underpin the dollar's positive tone.
In the case of sterling, although inflation currently remains low on
official measures, the monetary authorities are keeping a close eye on
any build-up in inflationary pressure. This is starting to become
apparent as the economy continues to grow well above its historical
trend of 2%-2.5%.
Against this background any moves in UK interest rates will be upwards
with the expectation of another half-point rise within the next three
months. This will enable the pound to improve against the mark.
The continuing tightening in fiscal policy, as evidenced by the
Chancellor's last Budget, which contained spending cuts and tax rises,
will help to slow down the economic recovery without the need for
dramatic increases in interest rates.

THE presence of Republic of Ireland manager Jack Charlton at Easter
Road on Saturday, may have menacing consequences for Hibernian later
this season.
The amiable former Leeds United and England player was not seeking to
make Pat McGinlay an honorary Irishman. Only a meagre amount of Irish
blood is needed for big Jack, but Pat possesses none at all.
It's much more likely that Charlton, who motored to Edinburgh for the
match, was watching Michael O'Neill for a managerial colleague south of
the Border.
O'Neill has been in impeccable form of late, and although a little
more subdued against hard-working Kilmarnock, still looked tempting to a
prospective buyer.
His second-half header after 68 minutes, from Keith Wright's splendid
cross, was his twelfth goal this season from a midfield position.
The lad from Portadown's best total for a season is 13, but that was
while being used as a striker, in his days at Newcastle.
However, Charlton could have been forgiven for his admiring glances at
McGinlay, especially after the way he gave Hibs the early goal they
wanted, after 12 minutes.
For a big man, he displayed nimble footwork when accepting a Kevin
McAllister pass, neatly sidestepping Neil Whitworth, and sliding an
accurate shot past Drago Lekovic.
It was the genius near goal that the two Hibs players possessed that
was missing from a Killie side who were proficient in every other area.
With a play-off for survival waiting for the second-bottom team, it
would be harsh on the Ayrshire club if they are subjected to the trauma
of such a match.
Colin McKee, with the assistance of a deflection off Graham Mitchell,
grabbed Kilmarnock's goal between the two the home lot earned, and was a
lively player.
But it was as a unit that Alec Totten's team were admirable and, after
the dust settled, only the harshest judge would have begrudged them a
point for their industry.
The Edinburgh team may have drawn too many matches to be considered as
contenders for Rangers' crown, but they have enough quality to be
adjudged the best of the rest.
With a little more reliability at the back, and the retention of their
best players, it is not beyond Hibs to finish close to the reigning
champions.
So, it would be a pity if Charlton's visit was the forerunner for a
whopping bid for O'Neill.
With so much cash required for stadium refurbishment, big money,
however unwelcome, might be difficult to resist.

ONE Sunday morning during mass I heard a cellular phone ringing in the
briefcase of a young executive a few pews away, and I knew that we as a
society were in trouble.
I couldn't help overhearing him discuss the agenda for a meeting, nor
could I help wishing for divine intervention to cut the line.
Perhaps because I'm in the etiquette business, I have witnessed more
than my share of information-age faux pas. Until decorum catches up with
technology, here are a few mannerly suggestions:
* NOTHING kills a conversation faster than whipping out even the
tiniest computer notebooks. It's better to jot down a stock tip or phone
number on a cocktail napkin or business card than to have to wait for
your Powerbook to boot up, by which time your conversational partner
will surely have lost interest.
* A CRYPTIC voice-mail message is no substitute for a gracious
handwritten note of thanks. And by gracious, I mean it should say more
than ''Thank you for letting us use your cottage all summer.''
* BY the same token, answering machines must be treated with respect.
This means no mumbling or staccato messages that only a tobacco
auctioneer could understand.
* THOSE who cannot resist interrupting a conversation to tap their
call-waiting (read ''rude-waiting'') feature should apologise abjectly
to their victims. (Send roses, too).
* EVEN more pretentious than putting hapless callers on hold is
phantom telephone chat. In former days, a young man with surging
testosterone might cruise by in his convertible, checking his windblown
locks in his rearview mirror. Today, he's just as likely to have a
cellular phone glued to his jaw as he yammers on -- sometimes to no-one,
or if there is someone on the other end of the line, the conversation
usually is of the most banal hey-guess-where-I'm-calling-from? brand.
* BEEPERS (unless worn by doctors) should be mute in restaurants and
theatres -- especially during Puccini's Un Bel Di. Believe me, when
you're crawling over eight people in the orchestra section to dash to a
phone, none of them is thinking, ''Oh my, what an honour to sit near
such a very important person''.
No, every person whose toes you've just crushed is thinking something
far less charitable, something that does not belong in a column about
manners. They're probably even wise to the fact that your urgent
communique was nothing more than a spousal command to pick up a half
gallon of low-fat milk on your way home.
The solution is to wear a mute beeper that merely vibrates -- perhaps
giving the wearer a thrill to which the rest of the world is thankfully
oblivious.
* SPARE the fax machine your poetic love letters, wedding invitations
and condolence letters. Besides being intensely private, these missives
fall flat on the limp, waxy paper that arrives via electronic burping.
Likewise, sending a continuous spate of unsolicited junk mail is not
only rude but also politically incorrect -- fax paper is
non-biodegradable.
Do these sound like obvious admonitions? I wish I could say they were.
Like all manners, they're a matter of common sense and consideration,
both of which have been in short supply lately.
Of course, there are some heartwarming developments as we speed-dial
our way toward the millennium -- conference calls that link homebound
elderly with the outside world, E-mail to find organ donors, and
computer programs that teach people to read.
Now if only someone would develop some software that teaches good
manners, I'd surely achieve nirvana in the techno-age.

Manners; Macmillan, 1993. [CPYR]1993 Avenue Magazine.

IHAVE clearly led a very sheltered life. What other explanation can
there be for the fact that, up until the other day, I had never before
read a copy of Old Moore's Almanack? Never even clutched a copy in my
grubby little hands.
I have witnessed grown men selling it in the street, of course, but
I've always been able to avert my eyes and avoid their sales patter. I
have considered life to be short enough without reference to some
peculiar periodical of portentous prophecy.
But needs must, dear reader, needs must. Old Moore's Almanack suddenly
became required reading when I discovered, at the tail end of last week,
that my mind had gone blank (the festive period having taken its toll on
my brain cells) and I hadn't a clue what I was going to write for this
column. This somewhat sorry state of affairs I cannot deny.
Now, there are four things you can do under these circumstances. The
first is to feign a migraine and go home with your tail between your
legs. I seriously considered this course of action but decided against
it on account of the fact that I had dogged off through ''ill health''
twice before in recent months and I feared that the editorial
management, trained observers all, were getting wise to me.
The second thing you can do is throw caution to the wind and be
honest; raise the white flag and admit to your superiors that you have
absolutely nothing of import to impart to the readership. This seldom
works. They will only point to the fact that a lack of a good idea has
never stopped a host of other Herald columnists from writing in the
past. Some people, it seems, can say absolutely nothing with wonderful
words.
The third course of action is to fall back upon that trusted old
journalistic ploy of actually writing a column about not having anything
to write a column about. My pride, or what little of it there is left,
will not permit this.
*AND so we come to the fourth possibility. And pick up Old Moore's
Almanack, a copy of which has just this minute landed, somewhat
fortuitously, upon the news editor's desk. What luck. Serendipity
strikes. I suppose Old Moore could have predicted it.
The year 1995, I discover, will be one of great optimism. People of
goodwill should be genuinely excited by the new start which is on offer
(sadly, this rather rules me out since goodwill has never been one of my
strong points).
In the middle of this month, Pluto, the dirty devil, enters
Sagittarius and we will see ''a change in political thinking producing a
stronger, idealistic view of politics''. In Britain, this shift will be
towards the centre, apparently.
Readers may well be inclined to describe these predictions as little
more than stuff and nonsense but I know for a fact that certain very
senior and highly placed political figures in Scotland pay great heed to
Old Moore's forecasts. Indeed, only last year, Mr Alex Salmond expressed
his delight that the almanack had predicted really good months for the
SNP in July and August; it was just unfortunate that the district and
European elections had been held in May and June.
Actually, if truth be told, the more you read the almanack, the more
you become convinced that many of the predictions are merely statements
of the extremely obvious. In February this year, for instance, it tells
us that there will be an announcement about the marriage and the
domestic status of the Princess of Wales, ''perhaps a new home or
relationship''. This falls into the
''show-me-the-month-when-there-won't-be'' category.
It goes on to suggest that, in March, there could be changes in the
leadership of the Conservative Party. Get away. One would like to think,
perhaps wishfully, that this is not so much a prediction, more a racing
certainty. Mind you, in April, the political prediction is an infinitely
more curious one. Some might say disturbing. Pressure will build up for
a change of leadership in the Labour Party. A misprint, surely.
But then, in May, the predictions return to the blindingly obvious. A
senior member of the Conservative Party will resign. Really? This is a
bit like forecasting that the Derby will be won by a three-year-old. Cut
to July when there will be the whiff of scandal at Westminster with a
sinister connection between the Opposition and a criminal figure.
(Robert Maxwell alive and well?) And then, by November, the chances of a
leadership battle in the Labour Party will have increased to 90%.
*WE may well laugh at these predictions but, frankly, we ignore them
at our peril. After all, Old Moore has been not a million miles off the
mark in the past. In recent years, he has forecast the collapse of the
Soviet Union, the establishment of the Israel-Palestine peace agreement,
and the 1992 currency crisis.
While we are on the subject of predictions, might I possibly be
permitted the luxury of making one of my own? I confidently predict that
around this very date next year, some journalist, short of an idea, will
pick up a copy of Old Moore's Almanack for 1996 and write a column based
upon its forecasts. It won't be me because I predict that it'll be my
turn to have the migraine.

THE cancellation of the later Living Tradition concert meant
Saturday's early evening show had four good turns instead of the planned
three.
The specially re-formed Kentigern opened by proving that they'd made
good use of their rehearsal time in Babbity's. There was little sign of
a 15-year hiatus in their performance.
Harpist Maire Ni Chathasaigh and guitarist Chris Newman need no
''cramming'' -- their empathy has built up through ceaseless touring,
and their instrumental prowess is unimpeachable.
The bluegrass-styled Salt Creek and a Scott Skinner medley were all
but inflammable, yet there was poignancy too, in Ni Chathasaigh's
reading of O'Carolan's slow air, Blind Mary.
Simon Thoumire's concertina-led trio continues to chart a course
between traditional-styled melody and jazzy invention. Regardless of his
between tune drollery, there's no mistaking the serious collective
music-making in numbers such as Mrs Meddle's March to Spey, and Surreal.
And so -- finally -- to Oige, yet another of these ridiculously
talented young Irish bands, so young that by the time you read this
three of them will be on their way to school in County Derry. Although
not quite the finished article, they are firmly in the De Dannan and
Altan mould in their imaginative arrangements -- particularly in their
flute, two fiddles and guitar incarnation -- and way of appearing to
play flat out and then find another exhilarating gear, and then another.

LIKE moths to the flame, the fraternity of female Edinburgh jazz fans
with a penchant for donning 1920s-style layered dresses, molting feather
boas and Come Dancing sandals emerged from hibernation to shimmy and
shake their unsuspecting partners at Saturday night's jazz band ball.
For them, dancing was really the main priority of the evening;
listening came third. In between was drinking. As a spectator sport, the
dancing was extremely enjoyable; especially when my two favourite Jazz
Festival characters -- let's call them M and Mrs Hulot -- made an
unexpected but unforgettable dance-floor appearance.
Those of us who turned up for the music probably did so on the
strength of one name -- Roy Williams. His graceful playing was proof to
anyone who ever doubted the record sleeve notes that he is indeed among
the very best trombonists around. Unfortunately, though, this former
member of The World's Greatest Jazz Band was relegated to a sideman role
on Saturday -- in a quintet led by singer Fionna Duncan.
Battling against technical problems, noisy chatter and even fire bells
(the hall was evacuated and four fire engines arrived but it was a false
alarm), Duncan and co. provided highly danceable music -- from the
raucous Sunday through to a song the singer is fast making her own,
Johnny Mercer's Talk To Me Baby.
Only for one number did absolute audience silence prevail -- a lovely
version of I Gotta Right to Sing the Blues. It began as a duet, with
Duncan's emotive handling of the world weary lyrics perfectly matched by
pianist Brian Kellock's lulling, ebb and flowing, accompaniment. The
unparalleled highlight of the night, it also featured Williams's most
mesmerizing solo.

JUST when you thought the pantomime season was drawing to a close,
along comes Scottish Opera with their operatic alternative -- Gilbert
and Sullivan's Iolanthe. Intended or not, the timing of this revival
couldn't be better -- recent events in and around the House of Commons
serve to intensify the hilarity of this musical jibe at the British
parliamentary system.
Making his return to Scottish Opera, the avuncular Bill McCue relished
the role of the Lord Chancellor, leading his House of Peers in a manner
more accustomed to Noel Edmonds' House Party. In tremendous voice, the
male chorus resembled a cross between a Gang Show line-up and the
Keystone Cops, provoking much merriment throughout the audience.
Dancing around the eye-catching set of many cupboards, the fairy
chorus, all red-haired and bespectacled, oozed mischief and enchantment.
Elizabeth Harley as the resplendent Queen of the Fairies was aptly
robust, her dream sequence, O Foolish Fay, sung with passion and
conviction.
Young Garry Magee scored a winner in his portrayal of the Arcadian
shepherd Strephon. Compelling acting and a sugary sweet lyric tenor,
he's one to look out for. Ann Archbold was superb as his coy lover
Phyllis, and Elizabeth MacCormack a glorious Iolanthe. Mention too, of
Stephen Holloway who projected the Sentry Song of Private Willis with
gusto and humour.
While Sullivan's scores aren't the profoundest of musical utterances,
orchestration is rich and musical references intriguing. Under Stephen
Clarke, the Opera orchestra brought the score to life in spirited
playing across the sections.
Top marks, then, to Scottish Opera for this brilliant revival.
Whichever divide -- lower, middle or upper -- it's a ''class'' act
promising box office success. See it.

IN July, l959, Toni Dalli was the headliner at the Glasgow Empire, a
singer every bit as popular and not dissimilar in style to Mario Lanza.
On the bill with him were Nancy Whiskey of Freight Train
fame, Alex Don, ''Scotland's King of Laughter'' and, almost inevitably
given the time-frame, the world's greatest sand-dancing act, Wilson,
Keppel, and Betty. There were, as I recall, many Bettys.
Today, Toni Dalli, a most engaging man, sings nightly for the
customers at his elegant restaurant on the outskirts of Marbella.
Occasionally, the odd European royal may tempt him to a castle to
perform but he does not like to be away from the golf course for too
long.
Jimmy Tarbuck was one of those who encouraged Toni to set up in Spain,
Sean Connery lives up the road ''and shot a 76 playing in the same
competition as me at Las Brisas this afternoon. He is the straightest of
men,'' Toni tells us. In golf as in life, no doubt.
The sun has covered the Costa del Sol all week. We hear tales on the
telephone of frost and snow back home, of television programmes which
make the test-card seem animated, and I much enjoy reading accounts of
Labour's troubles on the education front -- couldn't happen to a bigger
bunch of unprincipled power seekers.
Let's see how the ''tip-toe boys'', refugees not just from the
weather, but often from the law, are faring at Puerto Banus.
So everything in the hacienda is lovely? Well, no -- and yes.
This is still the socialist Spain of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, a
country where the unemployment figure stands at 23.8% and a third of all
workers are now on temporary contracts. The man has been in charge for
12 years and many believe that to be far too long.
Senor Gonzalez' party took a drubbing in the last European elections,
its share of the vote down to 30.6%. Municipal elections this May do not
bode well for the socialists.
Perhaps most serious of all for Felipe and his fellows are the
corruption scandals which continue to rock the nation. Three former
interior ministry officials are in prison charged with directing a
''dirty war'' against the Basque Separatists in the 80s.
A former civil guard police chief, suspected of taking bribes, has
disappeared, an ex-governor of the Bank of Spain awaits trial on charges
relating to a speculative, tax-secret share account. ''I am ashamed of
how some political figures have behaved,'' announced the man who came
with the hire car.
But if there is no feel-good factor nationally, here in Marbella the
mood is quite different. Mayor Jesus Gil -- no socialist he -- has
brought a fresh approach to local government which, even over the
Christmas period, has made him almost as popular as his namesake.
What Jesus has done is quite spectacular. There are new roads, an
extended promenade, the festive lights actually work -- Edinburgh kindly
take note -- the gardens and plazas are in spanking condition, and, most
prominent of all, mounted police are everywhere.
These formidable men and women sit astride their beasts at traffic
lights where no-one is likely to go through on the amber, never mind
red. A motorist parked at a bus stop when we were there -- one long
shriek of the cop's whistle and he shamefacedly moved on. How about
whistles for parking wardens?
The mounties are invariably polite, giving one a smart salute when
engaging them in conversation, a lesson in public relations that could
well be adopted by our own constabulary. In this Spanish town, the crime
rate has plummeted; drop a piece of litter in the street and you could
be galloped off to gaol.
Why, I wonder, can we not have administrations which run in this
fashion? Is it that we are afraid of putting too much power in the hands
of one person -- no directly-elected mayors, let's do it by committee,
as always?
Is it too much to expect clean streets? Would a campaign to make our
towns and cities more beautiful have a lot more relevance than the party
political claptrap to which we are subjected day in, day out? Why can't
we have a higher police profile on our streets?
These are questions we should all ponder before our own local
elections come around in April. When candidates come calling, as they
surely will, ask them not what they think of the performance of other
parties but what, specifically, will improve if they are elected.
Of course the elections will have a political content. Folk in
Edinburgh will be particularly concerned as to how Labour untwists its
educational knickers -- there are an awful lot of fee-paying schools in
the capital, and thousands of parents making sacrifices to send their
children to them.
The level of council tax will also be a major issue. But would it not
be uplifting if someone promised that our quality of life would be
improved . . . and meant it?
In the meantime, Toni Dalli buys us a brandy and tell us the secret of
how he conquered the dreaded Glasgow Empire. ''Glen Mason taught me a
Scottish song and I think I can still remember most of the words.''
He sure can. The restaurant audience, which included not a few of our
nationals, is enchanted by his rendition of At Home in Bonnie Scotland
with my Ain Folk.
Which we are now. Bloody cold country.

TECHNICAL problems forced the cancellation of the Living Tradition
concert, part of Glasgow Royal Concert Hall's Celtic Connections series,
on Saturday evening.
The concert, run in conjunction with Kilmarnock-based The Living
Tradition magazine and featuring a selection of Scotland's top singers
and musicians, was due to begin at 10.30pm in the concert hall's main
auditorium.
However, the magazine's editor Peter Heywood explained, in the middle
of last week it was decided that, with the RSNO's regular Saturday night
concert due to begin in the same venue at 7.30pm, there would be
insufficient time to change over in readiness for a prompt 10.30 start.
A spokeswoman for Glasgow Royal Concert Hall confirmed that the
concert was cancelled for ''technical reasons'', adding: ''We would
rather have no concert than a substandard concert.''

Gary C. Buchanan has
dreams that are
blowing in the wind
CLYDESIDE'S shipbuilding heritage reflecting the creation of historic
clipper ships may be eclipsed by the great Cunarders, but the names of
Cutty Sark, Balclutha and Falls of Clyde remain inexorably linked with
Scotland. Across the world's oceans these greyhounds of the sea were
truly tallships in excelsis.
Few of us, sadly in these straitened times, can maintain a fully
crewed ocean-going yacht. We can but dream of running away to sea on a
sleek pleasure ship -- of elegance, comfort, and privacy; of weighing
anchor off secret sun-bleached beaches or slipping into small select
harbours that large cruise ships must pass by; of watching majestic
white sails unfurl in the trade winds.
The construction of three identical ships represented as challenging a
feat to shipbuilders in this era as did the men-of-war of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries and the clippers of the mid-1800s.
Unlike many sailing ships of yore, Wind Star, Wind Spirit and Wind
Song, were designed to fire no cannon, to force no treasure-laden
galleon to heave to, to race around no Horn. Plying Caribbean,
Polynesian and, in summer, Mediterranean waters, these sailing
aristocrats marry secrets of nautical design hard won over the centuries
with computer technology that did not even exist a decade ago -- simply
and solely for the extraordinary fun of sailing in them.
A cross between luxury sailing yachts and small cruise ships, the
Windstar fleet is none the less democratic. They have only one class,
with all 74 outside cabins the same generous size and each commands the
same price tag -- about #2129 for a week in the Caribbean this summer,
including flights.
If the thought of all this luxury and computer-guided sails is too
remote from the days of yore when man pitched his wits against the might
of the sea and attempted to harness the wind, then the delightful duo:
Star Flyer and Star Clipper may be your dream voyage.
Launched in 1991 and 1992, these twin barquentines are the brainchild
of Swedish marine lawyer, Mikael Kraft who turned his boyhood dreams
into reality. The tallest of tallships, with 16 sails on four masts up
to 226ft high were constructed in Ghent, Belgium, and are modelled on
the classic clipper ships of yesteryear.
With accommodation for 170 passengers, this new brand of clipper has
Lloyd's Register of Shipping's top rating -- not given to any other
sailing vessel since 1911.
Star Flyer became the first commercial sailing vessel to cross the
North Atlantic in 90 years, and one of a handful to be allowed into the
Port of Miami under full sail. To be aboard these clippers is to have
died and gone to yachtsman's heaven, without killing the bank balance. A
week on these 360-footers with their massive 36,000 sq.ft of sail in the
Caribbean begins at #1360 for an eight-night holiday.
This cloud of glory is unique. From the gleaming brass, spotless
paintwork and immaculate rigging to the rich wood panelling in the
dining room and lounge. But the days when one person could afford to
maintain a ship like Sea Cloud for personal pleasure are over, today 60
passengers can enjoy the anachronistic style and beauty that sets Sea
Cloud apart as a small oasis of calm in this modern world.
There can be few sights more awesome that watching 20 fresh young deck
crew climb the ship's rigging and unfurl the sails -- almost 150ft above
the deck -- keeping ''one hand for themselves and one hand for the
ship''. When the diesels are cut out, the sails fill -- and silently,
effortlessly, Sea Cloud sets her leisurely course.
An 11-day Mediterranean odyssey on board Sea Cloud comes packaged at
#3995.
If the budget won't stretch to a cruise under sail, or you prefer to
look at majestic clippers from afar, then next summer you needn't leave
Scotland.
The 1995 Cutty Sark Tallships race will be centred around Edinburgh's
Port of Leith -- Scotland's historic gateway to Europe.
Sailing ships from all over the world will be arriving in the Forth on
July 15 heralding three days of celebrations linking the crews of the
ships with the people of Scotland. The tall riggers will be open to the
public and on July 17 a fireworks display will celebrate the last night
of the ships. On Thursday, July 18, the Firth of Forth will resemble a
scene from the Onedin Line as more than 100 tallships are escorted from
historic Leith, bound for Bremerhaven, by the newly re-painted QE2.

MANAGEMENT of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra has denied that
principal conductor Walter Weller has pulled out of his engagements with
the orchestra this week in a row over ''territorial rights'' on
repertoire.
The Viennese conductor, who was due to appear with the orchestra this
week in four concerts in Aberdeen, Perth, Edinburgh and Glasgow, is
indisposed through illness, said a spokesman at the weekend.
However, it was admitted that, during his last visit in December,
Weller had lost his temper because Scots conductor Donald Runnicles was
to conduct Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony with the orchestra the following
week. Weller had just conducted the same work three times with the Royal
SNO on a tour of Austria.
''He must have known it was on the schedule,'' said Valerie Carlaw,
head of marketing for the Royal SNO. ''He hadn't made any comment about
it before, but he was annoyed that somebody else played what he
considered his own territory.
''He was cross about it that night in December, but seemed to have
recovered his composure before he left. He let off steam about it and
that was the end of it.
''It's not true that he's now pulled out because of a row.''
Polish conductor Jacek Kaspszyk will replace Weller for this week's
four programmes -- featuring music by Brahms, Wagner and Richard
Strauss.
Ms Carlaw said that the orchestra would learn at the weekend if Weller
would be returning next week, when he is scheduled to be conducting an
all-Mozart programme. However, she said that several substitutes had
been lined up.

IT would be wrong to suggest that Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has
spent last week in the Indian subcontinent dispensing largesse like some
Lord Bountiful. But all three countries he visited -- Bangladesh, India
and Pakistan -- receive large sums of aid and he announced additional
aid for two of them.
India is our largest recipient of aid. It received #115m in 1992-93
and Bangladesh came second with #55m. On this trip, Mr Hurd gave
Bangladesh an additional #33m in aid and he will sign a deal with
Pakistan today in Islamabad giving that country an additional #15m.
Seeing how our aid is used is important, which is one reason why he
took John Vereker, Permanent Secretary at the Overseas Development
Administration, with him to cast the bureaucrat's eye as opposed to that
of the politician, over the schemes they toured.
Overseas aid is not granted to make the donor feel good but to better
the lot of the recipient and something which appears to be doing that
could actually be doing the opposite.
The case in point is the two Calcutta slums Mr Hurd visited last
Thursday. He saw one in its raw state, and a sobering sight it proved
despite the goodwill shown by the people living there towards their
visitors. Then he saw a developed slum where aid money has helped the
laying of concrete paths between the hovels and the installation of
sewerage and water supplies.
It was a marked improvement in their quality of life but the question
is whether it is a good use of aid money because in spite of the
improved quality of life the place remained a slum. The question is
whether the money was perpetuating the slum conditions.
There are plenty of ways aid can be used and it might be more usefully
spent on training people to run businesses, to speak better English, and
improving health services.
Britain helps slum projects in several districts in India apart from
Calcutta and two more in Cuttack and Cochin are under consideration.
Over the last 10 years we have provided #68.5m which is a tidy sum and
the ODA is currently looking at the whole concept.
In Bangladesh, the agreements Mr Hurd signed were #18.4m for a gas
supply project funded jointly by the ODA and the World Bank and #15m to
build 15 bridges on the Sylhet-Tamabil highway in the northeast of the
country.
The money for the gas company will help set up a computerised sytem to
monitor and control the main gas transmission network and upgrade the
gas companies' financial management. All this will improve the country's
infrastructure and help Bangladesh become a more attractive prospect to
international investment.
The deals he signs today will give the Pakistan government #11.5m for
its social action programme and an extra #3.4m on top of the #3.6m we
gave some years ago for the Dir district development project.
Under this scheme, the money is used to persuade the people of the
region that other crops and livestock such as chickens can provide them
with a living instead of the opium poppy.
The cash is used to give them start money to buy the livestock and the
necessary seeds. Whether we are throwing good money after bad is
anybody's guess. Maybe the better option would be to stop the
trafficking in opium because Dir, where the poppies are cultivated, is
both lawless and remote.
Twenty miles outside Lahore, Mr Hurd yesterday saw possibly the most
impressive venture of the whole trip. If some of the schemes he saw like
fish farming in northeast Bangladesh were aimed at helping poor farmers
escape a medieval environment, this was hi-tech of the most advanced
kind.
With assistance from the Commonwealth Development Corporation, which
is overseen by the ODA, a brand new cotton clothing factory called Sarah
Textiles has been set up on a greenfield site.
John Vereker said it was a Pakistani achievement, but the Pakistanis
were happy to share some of the credit with Britain and pay tribute to
the faith shown by the CDC in the company when their own banks were
reluctant to help.
The CDC holds a 15% share, has a #3.4m stake and a seat on the board
and the factory's director, Khurran Parvez, made clear they were not
only grateful for the corporation's backing but also for its advice.
The factory, which opened last November, is evidence that the Third
World or even the Second World, need not be totally backward. Its
products sell under some impressive brand names, Levi Strauss and Ralph
Lauren among them. The biggest problem they have faced is making their
Made In Pakistan label stand for high quality.
In this respect they differ from the garment industry in Bangladesh
which is labour intensive and produces products which are essentially
cheap. Vereker said Sarah Textiles was ''very impressive'' and Mr Hurd
was clearly taken with what he saw. He has been insisting repeatedly
that something remarkable is happening to the economies of the countries
he has been visiting and here was proof.
Aid is not a subject which enthuses the British public. It understands
the purpose of humanitarian aid but tends to be suspicious about
overseas aid and to doubt whether it all reaches the people it is meant
for.
Saving the children, helping Rawanda or the victims of famine in
Ethiopia are one thing but when it comes to the work of the ODA the
attitude tends to be one of apathy. This is something the politicians
are all too well aware of and aid ministers have to fight to defend
their budget harder than most.
The visits to the projects in these three countries have provided the
politician with the ammunition he needs to defend the spending and the
bureaucrat with the information he needs so that his advice is well
founded.
Lady Bountiful did good, but the question is whether she did any
lasting good, any good that was productive. The purpose of overseas aid
is to change things, to help people help themselves and Mr Hurd
undoubtedly returns to London tomorrow pleased with what he has seen.

The Celtic Connections music festival at Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall
features an exhibition by 14 painters with Celtic roots. Clare Henry
considers its impact
GLASGOW'S Royal Concert Hall, one of the city's key buildings, has
acres of foyer, reception areas, walkways and bars with spacious walls
going begging, yet sadly has never had a coherent visual art exhibitions
policy. Famous for its music -- infamous for its carpet and censorship
of the McCulloch murals -- in its fifth year it kicks off with the sort
of top quality show that should be commonplace here. So welcome to
Celtic Connections Art 95.
By chance rather than design, plus a helpful introduction from Iain
Anderson of BBC's Fine Tune fame, in 1994 the 35,000 folk who poured
into the concert hall to enjoy the first Celtic Connections Music
Festival got a bonus: a good free art exhibition courtesy of
artists/curators Ronnie and Sheena Forbes. This year the ever-growing
audience again benefits from their labours for the Forbes have organised
an even bigger, better selection of work from 14 painters with Celtic
roots.
Moreover, Celtic Connections Festival puts the Edinburgh Festival to
shame. Here, unlike Edinburgh, the visual arts are official: part of the
programme; the brochure; the budget and the PR. This is as it should be
and I trust it will continue to be so.
Celtic influences may abound, but don't expect traditional
hand-knitted art. The key here is high-calibre new work which embraces
experimentation and variety. Ronnie Forbes explains: ''It demonstrates
that genuine culture is never static. Diversity is appropriate in a
nation which has, throughout history, absorbed different influences.''
The catalogue tells us the show is divided into three sections:
narrative, symbolic abstraction and landscape -- but the edges are so
blurred I'm not sure as you'd notice, and does it matter anyway?
Weel-kent artists like Neil MacPherson, Calum Colvin or Elspeth Lamb
have their own distinctive voices which defy categorisation.
MacPherson's move to Caithness naturally imbued his work with
other-world mysticism, but he laces local legends with vivid,
crystal-clear colour and a robust Glaswegian punch. It makes for a heady
mix.
Equally gutsy in style are Edward Summerton's five impressive oils.
For Summerton ice is the northern European image. His imaginary world
features an arctic waste where simple objects, both pagan and Christian,
interact to form memorable oversized images. In Summerton's hands, even
a plate of tomato soup and cutlery carry a tremendous religious charge.
In a superb picture, Jesus In My Soup, a stylised steak knife grows a
ridge of thorns; Christ's face shimmers on a sea of holy blood under a
napkin crown. Some may see a toilet seat instead of white china soup
dish. Sacrilegious? As always, it's always in the eye of the beholder.
''My work is full of black humour,'' he admits. ''If Jesus had arrived
in Scotland instead of Jerusalem it would have been chilly. That's why
Walking On Water includes crampons on ice! North Of Normal shows a
jacket and electric chair. A crucifix is an instrument of torture, yet
people wear it round their neck with a romantic air. Today's equivalent
is the electric chair -- but would it make a fashionable medallion? Folk
forget that Christianity isn't a white Western religion.''
One picture, based on the Turin Shroud, is embellished with pagan and
Pictish items and relics pinned all over it. Second Skin has
connotations of survival and shamanism. ''Images never appear when you
want them to, but when you're doing the shopping. You paint them, but it
often takes a couple of years to work out what they're about.'' At #700,
Summerton's prices are rock bottom. Museums and collectors should jump
at them.
Like Summerton, Colvin has a unique voice which has put him firmly on
the international map. Current exhibitions include Sweden, Turkey and
Chicago. After a period using hi-tech computer manipulation, here he
returns to hands-on, painted trompe l'oeil photographed stage sets for
the first of a new series of cibachromes on flight, which includes
symbolic birds like eagles alongside china swans.
Meanwhile, Keith McIntyre prefers mermaids and a wonderful horned
Actaeon.
Doug Cocker favours abstraction of imagery, as does Lamb whose
triptych, Black Athena, is one of her best. She also uses ancient
symbols -- heart, fish, ammonite -- plus a strange bright red Roman
vessel in a picture titled Nut.
Stewart MacKenzie is as stark as George Donald is ornamental. Surely
Donald's Chinese hills and rocks qualify as landscape? And to complicate
things, Forbes himself calls one of his theatrical collages peopled with
plastic furniture, green jelly trifle and bar-code trees, All Consuming
Landscape.
After all this rich symbolism, the more realistic rocky landscapes of
George Devlin, (the Hebrides and Connemara) and Frances Walker (Tiree
topography and panoramas) provide a breath of uncomplicated fresh air.
Surprises include Moira Scott's green and cream grid paintings and
George Macpherson's soft, subtle abstractions. I enjoyed his lovely oil,
Mallaig, while at #140, the rich etching Evolution, is the bargain of
the show. He said: ''I try to shape my work, remembering surfaces and
textures and with maybe a wee bit of music in there somewhere!''
One of the nice things is the mix of good artists from all areas.
Walker works in Aberdeen and Tiree; Devlin in Glasgow and France. Others
roam from Lintrathen, Dundee, Arbroath, Newcastle, Tayport and Duns to
Edinburgh and Glasgow.
Meanwhile, notice too the few older pictures which permanently grace
the concert hall entrance: Lavery's exotic Anna Pavlova of 1910
presented to Glasgow in 1924; Brangwyn's Arab Musicians and Russell
Flint's Singers, both gifts of the Hamilton bequest as is Howson's
spine-chilling Parade. Many generous folk have contributed to Glasgow's
rich heritage. Food for thought here.
* Celtic Connections Art 95 is at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall till
January 22; then at Seagate Gallery, Dundee, from January 25 to February
11.

ALLOA fans would like their favourites to be cured of their new habit
of giving the opposition two goals of a start. As against Queen's Park
the previous week, Alloa fought back -- but lost by the odd goal in five
as Ross County marched on to an away Tennents Scottish Cup third round
tie at East Fife.
Captain Gordon Connelly earned the man-of-the-match award for his
industry, as well as his two goals for County. Only four minutes had
elapsed when he took a pass from Jamie MacPherson and his shot took a
deflection off Brian Kemp. Five minutes later, Brian Grant's pass let
MacPherson fire home a 20-yard right-foot shot.
There was an element of irony when Connelly got the last touch to
Peter Lamont's 20-yarder which brought Alloa back into it in 33 minutes.
But the home side were back to square one only seven minutes into the
second-half when Connelly won the ball, took MacPherson's return pass
and netted a left-foot shot.
Back came Alloa and they reduced the leeway with 20 minutes left when
Danny Diver scored from 20 yards.
Ross County manager Bobby Wilson, a Fifer and former manager of Raith
Rovers, is not afraid of a visit to East Fife, who beat the Highlanders
2-1 this season in the B &amp; Q Cup at Methil. ''East Fife were my first
love,'' revealed Wilson. But he warned: ''It will be a harder game this
time. We're more experienced now.''
The Fifers showed no mercy to Gala Fairydean, with Steve Hutcheon
hitting a hat trick in a 6-2 win. Winger Rab Matthew hit three for
another Fife team, Burntisland Shipyard as they won by the same score
against St Cuthbert Wanderers. Shipyard will visit the winners of the
replay between Huntly and Keith.
Dave Caldwell hit both goals in Cove Rangers' upset win over
Cowdenbeath by 2-1. Cove will now entertain Cowden's big brothers from
Dunfermline.
Brechin were badly hit by suspensions, but still fought back to level
from 0-2 before Ian McInnes hit his second goal to earn Stirling Albion
a home tie against Airdrie. Berwick Rangers dumped Buckie Thistle 4-1,
but will find it harder away to Meadowbank, who beat Forfar through
Chris Sinclair's late goal.
Miller Mathieson hit a double as Stenhousemuir cruised past Arbroath
4-0 to earn a visit to St Johnstone while Clyde's second away win of the
season over Queen of the South means a trip to Tannadice. Whitehill
Welfare can expect a large number of Hibs fans to make the short journey
to Rosewell if they can win at Montrose after Saturday's stalemate.

DAVID Sinclair, he of the crew-cut and sense of humour to match its
sharp look, is more renowned for his defensive capabilities than
anything else. So, when he scores twice in three games -- it should be
added swiftly that so far this season, these are his only strikes --
then mild surprise is permitted.
The Raith Rovers defender sent a superbly controlled shot from all of
20 yards into the back of Hamilton Accies' net on Saturday at Stark's
Park to set up his side's 2-0 win -- their third consecutive victory
over the festive period -- and put them right back in the promotion
stakes.
His first goal -- on Boxing Day -- came after he had been brought on
as a substitute 11 minutes from time, and he scored the winner.
''Sinky,'' who also proved he had some slinky touches in midfield,
admitted that manager Jimmy Nicholl usually prefers him not to go too
far forward, but Raith had such a devastating start against the Accies
that he found himself just in the right place to score.
The goal, however, brought up problems that have been facing both
sides for most of this season. As Nicholl said afterwards: ''Every time
we go a goal up at home, we seem to take our foot off the pedal. I just
don't know the reason for it. Apart from that opening spell, we just did
not look like a team until Colin Cameron got our second goal.''
Hamilton's problem is the opposite. Manager Iain Munro, while praising
the efforts of his young squad, said: ''Every time we have lost the
first goal this season, we have gone on to lose the game.
''The players decide to chase the game, and go to pieces. We try to
tell them, but they don't seem to listen. Their hearts are in the right
place, but they must learn to play with their heads as well.''
Chris Hillcoat finally got his long-awaited first-team return after
more than 20 months when he came on as substitute. ''It's been a long
wait, but worth it,'' he said.
But while Raith are on a high, Airdrie, who lost their unbeaten home
record by going down 2-0 to St Johnstone at Broadwood, have hit a
rock-bottom spell in which they have taken only one point from four
games.
Assistant manager John McVeigh said: ''The same thing happened last
year when we had a break because of the weather. We had been going well,
but when we eventually started playing again, the spark was gone.
''It's like leaving your car out in the street for a few weeks unused.
The battery goes flat. That has happened to us again.
''In our first 16 games, we lost only seven goals. In our last four,
we have conceded 12. We're not scoring, either. That's three blanks in a
row.''
A revamped St Johnstone, playing 4-4-2, with Davie Irons installed as
captain, and #150,000 keeper Alan Main making his debut, certainly
showed up Airdrie's weaknesses, with Kevin Twaddle and Paul Cherry
getting the goals -- and giving the Perth side a confidence boost for
their rearranged game against Dundee at McDiarmid Park on Wednesday.
Strikes by Neil Duffy and Paul Ritchie eased leaders Dundee through
2-0 at home to Stranraer -- a result that puts Alex McAnespie's men back
at the foot of the table after only a week away from it.
Dunfermline managed to keep Dundee's lead to six points with a
fighting victory at Clydebank -- although it does leave Bankies deeper
in relegation trouble. They had gone ahead through Ken Eadie in the
first minute but, in a stirring second-half display, the Fifers
equalised through Marc Millar -- his first goal for the club -- and
Craig Robertson hit the winner six minutes from time.
Ayr United popped back to second-bottom spot with a 2-0 victory over
St Mirren at Somerset Park. Goals by Frank Rollings and substitute Brian
Bilsland now also has Saints battling to beat the drop, just two points
ahead of United.

''THERE'S a sad Vegas sort of vibe about this,'' observed Martin
Stephenson, the second of yesterday's performers. Several hours later,
the River Detectives, headlining, were to liken it to playing at a
wedding reception, but whatever, the grand ballroom at the Hospitality
Inn at 4.30 on a Sunday afternoon certainly isn't rock'n' roll.
The heating was off during the Journeymen's opening set, but their
earnest and in some ways endearing folk-rock qualified them as the only
act of the day who were genuinely Celticly-connected both by birthplace
and musical influences.
Stephenson's set, by contrast, was a pared down, down-beat affair, his
charm as a raconteur between songs offsetting the fact that much of the
set was so quiet it faded into the background. The volume switch on
their amps needs to be turned up considerably to give the songs the
dynamics they cry out for.
In a day of incongruities, it was probably Fjaere who was most out of
place. Her angular American college rock would have shone in the sweaty
club environment where it belongs. Here, it swung but never soared.
By the time the River Detectives concluded matters, a dreary six hours
later, much of the audience had left the building.
In all, four bands in six hours in a sparsely populated ballroom
equals tedium, and the blame lies more with the organisers than the
performers.

ENGLAND captain Michael Atherton yesterday slammed team selectors and
demanded the right to pick his own side.
In a newspaper interview that threatens to provoke a row between the
skipper and his bosses, amid England's belated Ashes tour recovery,
Atherton said: ''The tour party is not the one I wanted.''
Atherton said: ''I'm quite happy with Ray Illingworth's input as
chairman of selectors because I feel he has a lot to give.
''But I have come to the conclusion after analysing the situation from
all angles that the captain must have the major say over selection.''
Atherton's now public stance is likely to spell the end for the likes
of Graham Gooch and Mike Gatting, and an extended run for young guns
such as John Crawley and Graham Thorpe on the international scene --
assuming the Lancashire batsman is reappointed as captain.
Atherton says: ''I believe what has happened so far on this tour has
demonstrated that we should have stuck to a policy based on youth.
''We need to identify young players with the talent, temperament and
desire to succeed at the highest level and stick with them through thick
and thin.''
Meanwhile, one of Atherton's hopes for a new English test era, Graham
Thorpe, relived the most frightening experience of his career -- and
said: ''I felt like I was on fire.''
Thorpe's temperature rose to 101 after he had batted for more than
two-and-a-half hours under a blazing Brisbane sun during England's vital
World Series Cup victory over Zimbabwe.
''My body was burning up and my breathing became affected,'' said the
25-year-old Surrey player. ''I felt dizzy and faint and I have to admit
it was frightening.''
Thorpe was showing the classic symptoms of heat exhaustion and severe
dehydration -- brought on by Brisbane's sweltering heat and high
humidity levels.
Thorpe was finally dismissed for 89, having batted for 39 overs, an
effort that earned the man of the match award after England had
triumphed by 26 runs.
Thanks to a tight bowling performance -- with Darren Gough and Phillip
DeFreitas outstanding -- and their sharpest fielding display so far this
winter, inspired by new arrival Neil Fairbrother, England dismissed the
opposition for 174.
''We want to get to the World Series finals rather than sitting on our
backsides watching two other teams play. It's a trophy to be won and we
want to win it,'' said Atherton. Scoreboard:

Doreen Taylor-Wilkie goes a-wandering along the mountain trail
AT the top of the Schlappiner Joch, just past the empty customs hut,
we paused on the rim that separates Switzerland from the Montafon valley
in Austria. At over 6000ft, the view was endless, bank upon bank of
peaks. The route up had been a baptism, not so much of fire but of rock,
an ascent of over 3000ft, in less than a mile, a steep zig-zag up
through alder scrub to bare rock, the turns close enough to lean over
and shake hands with the person on the next ''zag''.
Swift gulps of William (pear) schnapps from our guide's small bottle
were a lifesaver. Behind lay the peaks of Ritzen Spitzen, where I tested
out my new binoculars by spotting 14 red deer. Far below in Switzerland
lay the old Walser village of Schlappin, our target for the night.
On this five-day alpine walk, we were tracing the Valtellina Way. For
long centuries, packhorses and their drivers had struggled 12 days over
these high routes to bring wine from the Valtellina Valley, where Italy
and Switzerland blend into one another, to Montafon. We were walking the
reverse route and, even with my earthly goods pruned to the lightest of
rucksacks, I was beginning to empathise with a packhorse.
More recently, some of the old route has been taken over by road and
rail and stages would include a ride on the Rhatische Bahn, that
clambers over the highest passes with impunity and runs through
Switzerland at its most beautiful. At 6.30 next morning, an hour's walk
down the ski resort of Klosters, was followed by rail and mountain bus
to the Scaletta Pass.
Our testing target was to reach the top of the pass at some 8000ft by
noon. The temperature neared 80F and steepness and heat had us gasping.
Two-thirds of the way up I found myself ducking under the roof of a
great rock, not to stay hidden -- my companions were a dozen irritating
bends ahead -- but for shade. I had suddenly remembered the small bottle
of cognac acquired on the plane out. A quick swig helped but it was
still an hour to the top, past a series of huge, polished slabs nearly
2000 years old, the remains of the Roman Legions' tireless route north.
The top was wide and wonderful, and led down into the Susauna Valley
where the river of the same name runs glacier white, and the vegetation
-- gentians, eisenhutt, saxifraga and small trees, like bonsai -- grow
in perfect symmetry. A good garden architect would be proud of it.
What felt like 20 miles later (though the whole day covered only that
distance), we walked into the old village of Susauna, where houses show
dates of 1672, and proudly display ''Sgraffiti'', typical of this
ancient Romansch area, Sgraffiti houses, often delicate pink and white,
are decorated with columns, arches and doorways, painted on in pastel
shades.
Then, it was back on to the train and high up to the Bernina Pass to
Alp Grum for a night in the station house, waking early to what seemed a
great painting across the valley of a steep glacier, with a waterfall
below, all pale-washed greys, greens, and blues reflected in a small
lake. Everywhere was stone, even a cluster of farm buildings looked part
of it, the only spot of colour the red blob of a lakeside tent.
This third day above the Puschlav Valley was a long, high level, but
relatively easy walk. The high, narrow trail runs through forests and
above wild ravines. Along the way are clean signs of the old packhorse
road: broken walls, big slabs, a roofless house where the Valtelliner
slept.
La Prese is like an Italian village in Switzerland and the St Moritz
to Turin ''express'' trundles through the main street like a tram, the
only time I have seen a traffic jam that included a train. La Prese is
full of flowers and close to the Lake of Poschiavo, which lies below the
steep climb through the high forests to Alpe San Romerio.
For our last day we took this old route to San Romerio above trees
that spiked upward from ravine and cleft, the jewel lake far below. The
small alpine farm is run by Gino Bongulielmi and his mother, and there
is a stone church, replacing one first mentioned in 1106 and partly
swept away by a massive mountain slip. Undaunted, the peasants rebuilt
in the same spot and the present altar dates to 1659.
I was glad we had not noticed how far the church juts out over the
sheer drop before venturing down dark steps to the crypt and bone house.
To worship here must call for a strong faith yet this tiny church is
popular for weddings and summer services.
That night we moved into Italy to the Valtellina valley, once part of
Switzerland, where many vineyards and cellars are still Swiss-owned and
run. It ended with the ultimate souvenir, a bottle of the rich, deep red
of a true Veltliner wine, labelled Via Valtellina, the ultimate proof
that we really had done it.
Walking the Valtellina Way: six/seven days, includes two nights in
Montafon Valley in Gargellan, and a four-day walking tour, and train
back to Montafon. The tour requires fitness, hill-walking experience and
good equipment rather than specific climbing skills. Timing: August and
September.
Getting there: British Airways flies Heathrow/Zurich, or
Glasgow/Zurich via Birmingham. Train Zurich/Schruns (Monfafon).

MARCUS Cowie, whose brother Stuart hopes to play for Scotland in the
European Championships in April, led England to a whitewash victory over
Scotland to retain the under-19 squash home international title in
Aberdeen.
The Scottish boys, whose only victory was against Ireland, finished
third, but the home girls at least managed to retain second place behind
the unbeaten English.
There was a touch of needle to Cowie's match against Scottish junior
champion Neil Dickson. The question being: will the Norfolk-based player
also do an about-turn in the senior ranks and opt to represent the
country of his father's birth (he comes from Aberdeen)?
In his final junior home international appearance, he did drop the
third game to Cupar's Dickson before winning 10-8, 9-7, 9-10, 9-6.
Scotland girls whitewashed Wales and Ireland but lost by the same
scoreline to the English. But in the top tie, Lisa McKenna put up a fine
effort against Donia Leeves, who finished runner-up in the British
Junior Open on Friday, and led in the first and third games before
losing 9-3, 9-4, 9-5. Results and details:
Boys: Scotland 5, Ireland 0 (N Dickson beat A Frahill 10-8, 9-5, 9-1;

IT was their first gig together in seven years. They were apprehensive
(they said). They wished each other well. Then they were off, sounding
perfectly fine. When old bands reform you expect some rough edges.
This lot were in more danger of sounding over glossy, prim even. But
at other times you remembered where they came from.
The siblings Cunningham, Phil and Johnny, from Silly Wizard, and
Triona and Micheal O Domhnaill of the truly wonderful Bothy Band.
Ah, memories. Of the Bothies, Triona's magnificent voice and haunting
keyboards, and Micheal's sweet, crisp guitar playing. But these weren't
memories -- they were still there, except the keyboards went beyond
haunting. With a bass line straight out of the Phantom of the Opera she
kicked into the Jig of Slurs con brio.
Then the Cunninghams, Johnny playing lightning fast fiddle lines and
Phil manfully keeping up with him. That, mostly, was a memory.
These days Johnny plays with a wide repertoire of effects and tones,
all together more musically but still with a hint of danger. And their
duo towards the end, when they egged each other on to supersonic lines,
was as much a musical experience as a circus act.
When old bands reform you also wonder if it'll be for more than the
heck of it. There were enough musical reasons here for them trying it
again and more than enough entertaining moments.
This is a band where you think very carefully about everything you
say.
Otherwise, someone else will mirthfully throw it back at you. In fact,
at the rate they were carrying on verbally, it's a wonder they got any
tunes played at all.

FINLAND'S Ari Vatanen tightened his grip on the Dakar rally on
Saturday as his main rival, Bruno Saby of France, hit serious
difficulties in the sand dunes of the Sahara.
Saby, whose Mitsubishi suffered mechanical problems, lost more than
half an hour on the Finn's Citroen as he dropped back to third place,
leaving Vatanen with a comfortable lead of 45 minutes over Citroen
team-mate Pierre Lartigue of France.
Saby, the 1993 winner, is now 49 minutes off the lead.
There was a change of leadership in the motorcycle section when
Austrian Heinz Kinigadner, who had led from the start, lost 46 minutes
and dropped back to fifth overall on his KTM.
Spanish Cagiva rider Jordi Arcarons took over the lead, some 10
minutes ahead of France's Stephane Peterhansel on a Yamaha.

WE start today with the joke which drew the longest and loudest laugh
at the Oxford Farming Conference. It was told by a New Zealand farmer --
their equivalent of our own John Ross -- who had been brought across to
testify that there is life after subsidies.
Graham Robertson's joke concerned the farmer who was summoned to the
bank manager's office for a review of the financial position on the
farm.
He reported a #10,000 loss on the sheep account but, enigmatically,
suggested ''it could be worse.''
On the cattle front, too, there was a #10,000 loss, but again he
sighed, ''things could be worse.''
The arable side of the business had fared no better, but his optimism
kept getting the better of him, and again he had to re-assure the bank
manager 'things could be worse.''
The bank manager took a less sanguine view of this state of affairs,
and launched into a critical assessment of the situation, ending with
the query: ''How can you sit there, and tell me things could be worse?''
''Well,'' said the farmer, ''it could be my money.''
It was the sort of joke where you could see the punchline coming a
mile off, and yet it obviously struck a chord with the 500-strong
audience. The laughter was loud, and long -- and genuine. However, there
may have been a hint of nervousness there behind the laughter. Graham's
paper was one with the potential to divide the conference. His story was
one of how the New Zealand farming industry had broken the subsidy
habit, and forced itself to accept the discipline of the world market
place.
You could detect some unease in the questions that came after his
speech. What economies did the speaker have to make in his household
budget after subsidies were removed?
Were New Zealand farmers subject to the same kind of environmental and
planning controls as us?
How many farmers in New Zealand wanted out as a result of the changes?
The answers were not perhaps what the questioners had hoped for. To
economise, you just put your chequebook in the drawer and leave it
there. Yes, New Zealand farmers do have similar environmental and
planning controls to observe, and very few of them -- about 1% -- left
the land during the flight from subsidies.
The apres-conference talk in the bars demonstrated two lines of
thought. Inevitably, one lobby comforted itself with the belief that
''it could never happen here.'' Others were less certain.
One pig farmer was of the firm view that it had to happen. He, after
all, was having to face hard times and low prices without a subsidy, and
could not see the justification for his sheep, cattle, and arable
colleagues, being handed fistfuls of cash.
He was also of the view that the party which would win the next
election was the one which was prepared to draw a line in the sand over
Europe, and say: ''This is the barrier we will never cross and, in
addition, we want A and B and X and Y. Unless we get it, we will
withdraw from the European Union.''
The more thoughtful argument was that New Zealand farming had a
relatively short period of dependence on subsidies, and that it would be
much more difficult to wean the European farmer away from a support
system, unless governments throughout the world were prepared to act in
concert.
UK Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave was not, of course, in the
bars, but the following day he did align himself with the view that
farming support would remain ''in the real world,'' with some form of
common policy.
The cost of the Common Agricultural Policy is bound to come under ever
more critical appraisal, as it commands a major share of available
resources -- and some of the traditional bulwarks, which have thwarted
change in the past, may be losing their power.
The numerical strength of the French farming lobby is certainly in
decline, according to M Francis Capelle, who farms 400 hectares of
arable land in North-East France. By the year 2000, he reckons that
large farm enterprises will account for about two-thirds of the total
acreage under cultivation in France.
While today, there are some 250,000 'real farmers' in France, he sees
that figure falling by 100,000 over the next five years. Those who do
not graduate to the big league will become part-timers. Whether they
will continue to constitute an effective peasant lobby which has to be
pacified, remains to be seen.
Monsieur Capelle did offer the assurance that he came to Oxford as a
friend -- with no intention of setting fire to any sheep lorry. Perhaps
French intransigence is beginning to subside.
The sheep lorry problem has, in any case, transferred to this side of
the Channel, with our own animal welfare lobbyists impeding progress,
rather than militant French farmers.
The Labour home affairs spokesman in the House of Lords, Baroness Ann
Mallalieu, who addressed the conference dinner, suggested that Dr Gavin
Strang, her party's shadow agriculture minister, might have been a
better choice. That is unlikely. His statement on Thursday calling for
sheep to leave Britain on the hook, rather than on the hoof, might not
have endeared him to the delegates. The official industry line is still
that live exports are ''a legal trade,'' and anything which impedes that
trade is therefore, by definition, illegal.
One deviant from that line is Barbara Smith, a Cheshire dairy farmer,
who told delegates bluntly: ''There is absolutely no mileage in trying
to defend the export of animals by saying it is a legal trade and that
we should be allowed to export within the law.''
The moral aspect demanded that farmers should be concerned about the
eventual fate of their animals, she argued. To that end, she opposed the
export of young calves bound for the veal trade.
As she was speaking, however, Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave
was being quoted on radio bulletins insisting that he had no power to
end live shipments. This one will run and run.

LET'S be honest, it's stretching a point to include Marra in a Celtic
Connections festival. The man's eyes and ears have been trained on
America for so long that any indigenous influence is so self-conscious
as to be irrelevant. One of the best songs he played last night was
about the religious influences on the Uists -- Chain Up The Swings --
but his Dundonian perspective might as well have been from another
continent.
Who cares? As the man himself says, it's all about music not
compartmentalising folk (or jazz, or blues). More worrying was the
context in which his songwriting was performed. Marra's talent is
crucially in the words and they were almost inaudible, buried in an iffy
soundmix by a leaden band. The inclusion of accordion and the occasional
nod toward oblique guitar, a la Marc Ribot, hints at important
songwriter. But does Marra care about stardom? Hell no, he's so far
downstage only the drummer is behind him.
Too many of Marra's recent songs seem to be about songwriting, or
maybe it's just the way he tells them. That wouldn't be as pretentious
as it sounds if they weren't dressed up in rock-band garb, and Beefheart
and Bones (a song about a separation disagreement over the record
collection) is a classic in the Randy Newman mould.
Support Seelyhoo were the authentic Celtic thang, but just as
eclectic. So much so that they're in danger of lacking a coherent sound
even if everything they do has an attractive delicacy. Hear the Wrigley
sisters and the rest of the combo on BBC Radio 3's diverse Scottish
evening at the end of this month.

HIS office is full of road maps of Cuba, and so is his face -- pure
Havana, a matador mix of sleepy machismo and haunting, burned-sienna
eyes. ''Have a cigar?'' asks Andy Garcia, pushing back a brown pork-pie
hat as he settles into a seat in what was once his back garden.
He puffs on his tobacco torpedo and grins with the confidence of an
actor who, at 38, is one of the most sought-after leading men in the
world. His assistant provides what appears to be a thimble of black mud
with sugar. As he sips his coffee, Garcia admits he adores his heritage.
And, of course, like all exiles, he knows that what you can't have, the
more you want it.
The ''office'' is a rambling house on the outskirts of Los Angeles
which -- before Godfather III, Black Rain, Eight Million Ways to Die,
and a string of films including last year's When A Man Loves A Woman
with Meg Ryan -- was the full-time home for Garcia and his wife and
three daughters. It still bustles with activity.
But today it's not babies crying but power players wanting his time
for this film deal or that charity concert or personal appearance. He
has a reputation of being difficult but I've never found him that. He's
a decent man -- Un buen hombre. And never more than now. He's made, and
is making, his dreams come true.
He has a bigger family home in Los Angeles and a $1.1m beachfront
property in Key Biscayne, Florida; but more important to him than the
trinkets of Hollywood success is the fact that he can call the tune. And
how.
He made his debut as a director with a documentary about Israel Lopez,
better known as Cachao (pronounced ka-CHOW), a bassist, composer, and
band leader who helped create the mambo and revolutionised Cuban and
Latin music from, you might say, the bottom up. Cachao recorded the
first mambo in 1939 as well as being a Latin legend responsible for the
Cuban musical form known as the danzon and the biggest influence behind
the descarga -- jam sessions.
The highly-praised documentary led to Garcia producing more of
Cachao's work and Master Sessions, Volume One was a major success last
summer in America and went on sale in Britain last month. Now, the
musician is writing the music for Garcia's next film.
Cachao was born in Havana in 1918 and left Cuba in 1961 with a couple
of suitcases and more than 3000 songs. Garcia was born in Havana in
April, 1956, and was five when his family fled Castro and settled in
Miami.
Both refugees from the communist regime, they finally connected in San
Francisco. By then Garcia was a star -- not the swaggering teenager
hanging around the music clubs on Collins Avenue in Miami Beach. ''Back
then we'd drink coffee at the Royal Castle on 71st Street. The ocean was
right there. We'd wait for the American girls to come around and try and
pick them up. These had a purpose in being around us. They wanted to
have a good time. We were there to cater for their needs.''
And also to hang around the back door of one of the music clubs where
the mambo kings of the day played.
''The manager was a nice guy -- he knew we kids loved the music but we
were too young to go in. They sold liquor. He kept the back door open
when he could and we heard the music. You find solace in the music and
that is really true of Cuban exiles because music is such an important
part of our lives. That's how you carry your culture with you and the
nostalgia for your country. It's something to ease the pain.
''I'll always miss not having grown up in Havana. I'm developing a
film set in Cuba (The Lost City) and at least I can recreate the
childhood I didn't have. I'm very passionate about my culture and the
tragedy that fell upon it. My father, who died at 76 in 1993, told me
that the last straw for him was when you had to turn the rights of your
children over to the State -- and the State determined the
indoctrination of your children, their schooling, where they serve in
the military. We have no relatives there. We are a small family. They
all ran with us.
''And we had to learn a new world. My mother got a job as a secretary
and my father, who had been a lawyer in Cuba, worked for a catering
company. But we had our freedom.''
And he and his friends, like Zoom Zoom Zami, would go hunting for
music: ''I discovered Cachao in a music store in Miami. I didn't know
who he was but the owner of the store said it was a classic. I picked up
the album and I was hooked. Part of the fun of it was finding out that
he truly was the mambo king.''
Garcia marches off to his office and returns with the original LP. The
cover is a little tattered but it's where the dream began. ''One night
he was playing at the club where we all hung out at the back door. That
night the manager unscrewed the light bulb above one of the set-up of
chairs and let us come in. It was timeless music, beautiful music which
is compelling and will never go out of style.''
Without Garcia's documentary -- Cachao: Like His Rhythm There Is No
Other -- and passionate interest the mambo magician would probably have
continued playing at weddings and birthday parties in Miami. The Cubans
in Florida's Little Havana suppose he would have been ''discovered''
after his death.
But Garcia has created a new life for him. ''He is my second son,''
says Cachao through a translator. ''He knew all about Cuban music and I
was very impressed when we met in San Francisco.'' There was also a real
family connection. Cachao had worked with Garcia's father, Rene, and the
actor said ''That certainly helped smooth the way. My father was
affectionately nicknamed 'The Mayor' because he was so gregarious and a
fine public speaker.''
Also impressed was Cuban-born writer Guillermo Cabrere Infante who
takes part in the Cachao documentary. Now, Garcia is working on The Lost
City which is based on Cabrere Infante's writings about the cabaret
world of Havana in the mid to late fifties.
Back in his office for more mud and sugar the actor is surrounded by
much of his heritage. There are bongo drums and maps of Cuba on the
wall. ''It is just in preparation for the movie,'' he says.
But it seems more a case of you can take the boy out of the country
but not the . . .
''I don't dispute that. But I'm also aware that you need to make films
and recordings that are available and likable by many different sorts of
people. I am not naive in that. But if I can do a commercial venture
which allows me to indulge in something from my past then why not?
''I've worked more for British directors than any other -- Ridley
Scott (Black Rain), Ken Branagh (Dead Again), Mike Figgis (Internal
Affairs), and Bruce Robinson (Jennifer Eight). I seem to get on with the
British -- must be my heritage!
Garcia and his wife Marivi -- short for Maria Victoria -- met in
college in Miami and married in 1982. She and their daughters, Dominik,
11, Daniela, six, and three-year-old Alessandra, are, he says, his life.
In Cuba the family is everything, part of his past. Like the Mambo
Kings. Like Cachao. And The Lost City which we will see later this year.
There's also talk of another movie with Sean Connery -- they worked
together on The Untouchables -- and in the office the phones keep
ringing with more and more offers.
And Andy Garcia leans back in his green garden chair and grins: ''Like
a cigar?''
A Havana, of course.

Sheep carcasses stripped to the bones have raised fears of marauding
big cats in the Highlands -- but some believe this is just another
shaggy-dog story, as Ian Sutherland reports
TALES of strange beasties in Scotland's Grampian and Highland regions
are as old as recorded history. They were given new twists by the rise
of mass tourism and sophisticated PR. It's now admitted that Nessie --
supposed to have been first recorded when she attempted to make a meal
of St Columba -- was conjured up by astute tourism interests.
Now the hunt is on for the latest creatures padding abroad at night,
when -- as Conan Doyle warned in the Hound of the Baskervilles -- the
powers of evil are exalted. Since the autumn, news columns have recorded
numerous alleged killings of sheep by one or more large cats, mainly in
Grampian. It's claimed that these killings differ from past instances of
sheep-worrying. Invariably the carcasses are said to be stripped of all
flesh. Angry farmers are left with only a rickle of bones. With most of
the area under snow, it's reported that farmers are ''calling in
trackers'' and want the National Farmers' Union of Scotland to take up
the scent.
Unscrupulous sections of the media have dwelt gorily on the deaths.
The slayings are the work of ''The Beast''. One daily sheet ran colour
shots of stuffed examples of the so-called Kellas Cats -- which were
killed by motorists in Moray during the 1980s. Savage jaws and flashing
eyes are testimony to the taxidermist's art.
Readers weren't told that Kellas Cats aren't a great deal larger than
some popular domestic moggies, such as the increasingly revered Maine
Coon varieties. Whoppers though they are, the likes of Maine Coons would
have a hard job tackling average rabbits. Sheep would be another matter
-- unless Kellas Cats had defied all known facts about cats and had
taken to hunting in packs.
Perhaps worried by the prospect of trigger-happy townies venturing
into the Grampian hinterland -- and adding accidental human deaths to
the livestock toll -- police and scientists have firmly tagged the
killings as the work of dogs. Dogs are big enough to kill sheep and they
hunt in packs.
The cranks and the PR pedlars aren't likely to leave it at that. The
extended episode has given new voice to campaigners who claim that the
British Isles have, for centuries, harboured an unidentified but
entirely native species of big cat. In the North-east it has been
claimed the animals are ''as high as a car door''. Supporters of this
theory don't explain why none of the ''beasts'' has fallen victim to
careless motorists, unlike their smaller cousins whose corpses litter
the highways.
When a puma was ''captured'' in Inverness-shire in the 1980s, it was
found to be suspiciously tame. Practical jokers obviously read the news.
Inevitably, pumas have been fingered as possible candidates in the
North and North-east's latest cat-hunt. In her new book on world cats*,
US author and researcher Elizabeth Marshall Thomas lists a few points
which firmly put down that particular speculation. For starters, only a
lunatic would keep a pet puma which hadn't been declawed.
Thomas points out dryly that most people would be more likely to hear
pumas than see them.
''Pumas scream. A dismal howl, a trilling wail, a loud weird cry, like
someone screaming from the pain of surgery -- these are some of the
images that came to mountain men and other early settlers whose puma
stories were compiled in 1946.
''Pumas scream because they live apart in the woods, where trees
prevent most sound from travelling. So who would have thought that any
question would remain about the presence or absence of such a large,
vocal animal?''
North of the Highland Line, as the trackers are called in, amid
demands for ''official action'' and the first quiet hints of calls for
financial compensation, the only response to such cat facts is silence.
At the last count, wolves were being identified as the villains of the
peace. But they seem to have lost their voices, too.

FORMER world middleweight champion Carlos Monzon was killed in an
autobile accident yesterday in the small Argentine town of Santa Rosa de
Calchines, almost 300 miles north of Buenos Aires.
Details were sketchy, but police said Monzon's car struck another car
in the town, 22 miles north of his hometown of Santa Fe.
Monzon, 52, won the middleweight crown in November, 1970, in a
twelfth-round knockout of Nino Benvenuti in Rome and had 14 title
defences before retiring in August of 1977.
In 101 bouts, Monzon won 89, 61 by knock-out, lost three, drew eight,
and had one no-contest.

IT was just typical of Mossie. He didn't turn up for my shoot on the
third until the hard work had been done, and we were settling in to the
Stilton and the port.
I'm glad he did come though, for he told us a fine story from his
youth. It came out when I was telling the shooters that I had, for the
second time in my life, shot eight pigeons with one shot. It's the
poacher's equivalent of a hole in one. They had been grazing the cuffins
I had brought home from the mill to encourage the pheasants to stay on
Little Ardo, rather than going away to steal the feed from Lord
Aberdeen's tame pheasants.
In the spirit of pest control, rather than in the strange name of
sport, I shot into the bunch from the cab of the old lorry.
I don't think Mossie liked me getting the limelight. ''Och just
steading doos? That's naething. I once shot eight ducks.'' That did make
us sit up.
The 16 year old Mossie had been out with his father's gun, the old man
being at the mart, when he had seen a flock of ducks among the stubble
in a field neighbouring Moss-side. They were near to the edge, and were
all grouped together gorging themselves on some split grain.
Ignoring the fact that neither the field nor the ducks were in the
family, Mossie figured that, if he were to crawl down the ditch that
tries to drain the moss, he could get near enough for what would surely
be an easy shot.
No problem. When he peered over the edge of the ditch, he had a good
shot alright -- but the ducks seemed so totally fooled by his stalking
skills, that the lad decided to go even nearer.
Finally, at a distance of no more than 20 yards, he fired into the
pack. Even then, the ducks didn't fly off. They all ran squawking off in
the direction of the neighbour's steading.
The implications of all that, didn't impress the 16 year old. What
success! The heap of feathers on the grain spill contained no fewer than
eight ducks. What a shot! What a hunter he was.
When he was selling his bag, he asked the butcher what variety they
were. They looked a bit like female Mallard, but where were the drakes?
''Mallard!'' said the butcher, ''that's nae Mallard. That's Khaki
Campbells. They hadna' been hard to shoot, laddie. Mind, they're grand
layers.''
When the neighbour asked Mossie if he could help solve the mystery of
the eight missing ducks, the lad was quite unable to do so.
Up until this year I'd have said the Little Ardo pheasants were the
smartest in the world. You never see one when you have your gun. They
are always posted missing when I have my annual shoot -- and yet, come
the first of February and the close season, they are everywhere. They
come right up to the door and into the buildings looking for scraps.
Because of that, my shoot is always a disaster judged by the weight of
the bag. Our record up until now was last year's six. Perhaps that's why
Mossie didn't turn up until after the action.
Anyway, we did better this year, and had a bag of 22. Everybody got a
brace, and the Breadwinner is finding out what it is to be a farmer's
wife with pheasants to pluck.
I'm sad really. I much prefer to see those beautiful birds pecking
around the place. All the same, I have to accept that most are going to
die in the winter anyway, and a thinning does increase the chance of
those which remain.
But I nearly got away without having a shoot, or indeed any of the
hangovers associated with the Pagan festival of New Year.
A great storm blew up on Hogmanay, and blocked in minor roads and some
of the big ones. We were totally blocked in, and would gladly have left
it at that. We could not have chosen a better time for isolation. A week
on our own, and it would all be over.
But, unfortunately, we had revellers trapped with us. So, fortified
only by my sore head, I had to yoke the old snow plough. It was totally
immersed in snow, it had no pins for the three-point linkage, and no top
link. I could have cried by the time the frozen fingers had the old
thing ready for the road.
Five hours of craning round, and the road was open. By going through
one field of barley, we could avoid the deepest rifts, and I cleared the
400 remaining yards to the road.
We were able to get rid of our guests.
But I had failed to notice a snag in my scheme. Just as my New Year
guests were free to go, so were all and sundry free to come in and visit
us.
So there was to be no peace for the poor Farmer.
I had Penny Washers the white settler to dig out as well. He is about
a mile further off the road than me, and thought he was stuck for good.
However, I was able to dig a couple of hundred yards towards him. I
explained that he could take down the wires on the fence into our rape.
He was ever so grateful.
But really, there is nothing to letting down the wires. It is only a
few pulls, and a few bangs with a hammer, and it can be repaired in one

John Millar reports that even in defeat, the Chechens would have the
satisfaction of knowing their defiance has hastened the end of the
Yeltsin era
AT A New Year party in the Kremlin President Boris Yeltsin was in fine
form. By all accounts he was not only his boisterous self -- and
knocking it back -- but he was also optimistic about Russia's future.
And he wanted it to be known that he was in full control of his
country's destiny.
But there should be no doubts that right now Boris Yeltsin is in some
political trouble. Nearly a month has passed since he ordered his troops
to crack down on tiny rebellious Chechnya. They demonstrably failed to
do so. Some 40,000 Russian soldiers equipped with tanks and other
armoured vehicles and backed up by aircraft have been unable to crush
the ragtag army of Chechens.
The Chechnya adventure has become the Chechnya quagmire. A Russian
general and dozens of soldiers have died in the bloody fighting for the
centre of Grozny, the capital, as well as hundreds of civilians. Massive
force and change of tactics may at last mean the seizure of the
presidential palace -- or what is left of it -- and the regime of
General Dzhokhar Dudayev, the Chechen leader, may effectively have
collapsed. But there is no end in sight to the Chechen crisis.
Everything has gone wrong for Yeltsin since Chechnya, the tiny mountain
nation some 1000 miles from Moscow, thumbed its nose at the Kremlin and
refused to give up its independence in the face of threats by the former
super power.
It must be said that Yeltsin had some right on his side -- Chechnya
could not be allowed to tear up the Russian constitution and secede. And
this is why not a single country has so far supported Dudayev in his
struggle to hold on to power, although several Western leaders have
become concerned at the number of civilian casualties and Chancellor
Helmut Kohl said at the weekend that the fighting was ''complete
madness''.
Yeltsin's biggest mistake was to have been persuaded that his army
could do the job quickly and efficiently. He was not to know that his
armed forces would ignore not only their own military doctrine but also
the lessons of history -- which meant that Russian tanks stumbled into
ambushes by Chechen hit squads. Moreover, he could not have expected
that at least five senior Russian officers would refuse to take part in
the campaign because it involved fighting against Russian citizens. Or
that Russian units on the ground, some comprised of raw recruits, would
only pretend to fight.
Yeltsin shares responsibility for the fiasco with the so-called
''power ministers'', the heads of the armed forces, the Interior
Ministry and the security services. But a few other top Kremlin aides
have emerged from the shadows as the bloody conflict has got under; the
most important and enigmatic is Yeltsin's personal bodyguard (and
favourite tennis partner) General Alexander Korzhakov. Korzhakov and
Oleg Soskovets, a deputy prime minister responsible for Russia's huge
military industrial complex, are part of this very narrow circle of
hard-liners and loyalists which forms Yeltsin's power base.
Moscow is rife these days with stories about the possibilities of a
Kremlin coup as well as with the traditional conspiracy theories
involving the military. But short of one of the President's ''kitchen
Cabinet'' launching a Kremlin coup there is no reason why Yeltsin should
be toppled.
For the fact remains that the executive presidency which was the
outcome of the elections a year ago is really quite powerful. The Duma,
or parliament, which has called several times for a ceasefire and a
negotiated settlement, can be as obstructive as it likes but Yeltsin is
able to rule by decree, as he has so often before.
He can ignore the mounting criticisms of the war which are coming from
the motley alliance of garrulous but ineffective politicians --
liberals, communists, centrists and some army officers. Most of them
have no ideas more fruitful than those of Yeltsin about how to deal with
the Chechens, and furthermore they are divided by bitter personal and
political disputes.
A new experience for Yeltsin, however, is that Russian public opinion
is beginning to turn against him. Once widely regarded as a populist
figure -- he shunned the trappings and privileges of power -- he is now
more and more looking like an old-style Communist Party regional boss at
the head of a presidential security council bearing an uncanny
resemblance to the secretive Soviet Politburo.
Russian democracy has made giant strides in the past three years but
Yeltsin's PR smacks of the Soviet era. He has addressed his people about
events in Chechnya only once and at a time when, uniquely, Russian
troops were fighting a war in front of television cameras and
journalists. The atrocities, the blunderings, and the defeats have all
come out, giving rise to a public relations catastrophe rivalling the
military disaster.
It is not surprising, therefore, that two out of three Russians are
said to be against the war continuing -- although they will not come out
on to the streets in any significant numbers to protest -- and that only
13% of Russians recently polled said they trusted Yeltsin to run the
country any longer.
Yeltsin used to be good in a crisis and he has bounced back from
several political defeats. One reason was that there has been no other
Russian politician around with anything to match his popularity and
stature -- and that included Vladimir Zhiranovsky, the hard-line
nationalist and rabble rouser who has been noticeably quiet about
Chechnya. Another was because Yeltsin had public opinion, and leading
and highly motivated democrats and reformers on his side.
No longer. Those days appear to have gone and will not return, even in
the unlikely event of Yeltsin being able to claim total victory with the
''fall'' of Grozny and the capture, and even death, of Dudayev.
Chechnya is more likely to turn out to be a defeat so costly in
economic and human terms and so personally humiliating that there will
be pressure on Yeltsin from a combination of the military and the
government of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to step down.
Chernomyrdin, one of the most powerful men in the country who has
grasped the economic implications of both the campaign and its
aftermath, is, in fact, distancing himself from his President.
Whatever happens next in Chechnya, and in Russia too, the conclusion
is inescapable; the Yeltsin era is drawing to a close.

<HEADLINE>Young calves now in need of skilled management</HEADLINE>

AS mid winter approaches, one group of animals on most livestock farms
that need skilled management are the young calves.
One of the biggest problems is a poorly ventilated calf house.
Deficiences in ventilation have been shown up this winter in the mild,
wet weather conditions. On still days, lack of air movement in the
building leads to an accumulation of stale air and waste gases.
Like all living creatures, calves need a constant supply of fresh air
to prevent disease build-up, including pneumonia. The obvious signs of
poor ventilation include the smell of ammonia, and mild coughing among
the calves. If you hear your calves coughing, try to improve air
movement.
It may require some form of mechanical ventilation, or it may simply
mean taking a sledge-hammer and knocking out a few rows of bricks or
concrete blocks to create more openings in the walls and roof. Keep the
doors open. Draughts can be prevented by using straw bales or other
structures, such as a screen against the wind and driving rain.
There is also a temptation to reduce costs by cutting back on straw
bedding in calf houses. With straw at such a high cost, this is
understandable, but failure to provide the calf with adequate bedding is
false economy.
Firstly, a well-bedded calf pen provides insulation for the calf --
allowing the building to be kept well ventilated, even to the point of
being extremely cold. The calf will not suffer.
Secondly, keeping the calves clean by using adequate bedding, will
reduce the disease spread. Therefore, rather than considering
expenditure on straw an expensive luxury you can do without, it should
be considered as a relatively cheap form of disease prevention, which
saves you money.
Another common practice, as March 31 (end of quota year) gets closer,
is the feeding to calves of cows' milk surplus to the farm quota. Normal
feed rates of five litres of milk per day with six-week weaning will
''use up'' around 200 litres of ''quota'' milk per calf, which will have
only marginal effects on the overall quota position.
Feeding higher quantities per day, coupled with late weaning, will
obviously have a greater effect in reducing milk sales.
We are currently feeding bull calves at Crighton Royal, SAC, Dumfries,
eight litres of cows' milk per day (four litres twice daily, poured into
group troughs) to enable us to study the economic performance of calves
reared on ''quota'' milk.
The normal rearing system is machine feeding of milk substitute.
Some farmers are feeding up to 15 litres of whole milk per day to
large healthy calves. It is best to feed this quantity of milk on an ad
lib basis. Calves grow well at this high feed rate, assuming scouring is
prevented, but intake of dry feed is minimal, as the calf will not eat
meal or cake when milk is available.
This leads to poor rumen development. Therefore the calves usually
suffer a severe growth check when they are eventually weaned off milk,
thereby wasting a lot of the liveweight achieved on the expensive milk
diet. The older the weaning age, the greater will be the growth check.

IT is all very well for the Prime Minister to say that he wants the
rebel nine Tory MPs back in the Tory Party as soon as both sides are
''content'' for this to happen. They still don't trust him on Europe.
They want a referendum on any further constitutional change and they
want a definite ''No'' to a single European currency. Again, yesterday,
Mr Major's response to this was: it isn't going to happen, so what's the
point of falling out? The nine who are off the Tory Whip can be expected
to demonstrate this week that they are true Conservatives when the
Commons votes on a very serious matter indeed for the Government. Mr
Major is in danger of losing the Government majority on all the Bill
committees that process legislation.
These committees are yet to be formed as a result of the dispute,
which in turn is the result of the nine beyond the Whip. Technically,
this situation puts the Government in an overall minority in the Commons
and therefore unable to command a majority on the committees.
If the rebels wanted to exert their power, they could make things very
awkward for Mr Major indeed. By voting as a block against the
Government's bid for committee majorities despite their exile they might
succeed in putting the whole legislative programme under the control of
the Opposition.
All the Ulster Unionists would have to charge to Mr Major's rescue to
prevent this. A Government simply cannot afford to lose control over its
legislation. The Prime Minister might as well invite Mr Blair and Mr
Ashdown into a coalition Cabinet.
Fortunately for the Government, the rebels, seeing themselves as true
patriotic Tories, approve of this year's package of proposed laws
including most of the all-important Finance Bill. They will not produce
a block vote against Mr Major this week.
In short, they appear to trust him with the economy. At least they
trust him in so far as they are not prepared to set up as a separate
political group, officially recognised.
The fact that they are able to remain a separate group on matters
European allows them to continue to have the best of both worlds, off
the Whip or on it.
A weekend poll by Mori for the Mail on Sunday indicates that they have
the support of not only their constituency associations, but also that
of disaffected Tory voters therein. Some 60% agreed with them in defying
the Whip (and thereby losing it) on the issue of increasing payments to
Brussels.
In such a test of public opinion, the rebels ride high, while the
Prime Minister continues to record the lowest support in opinion-polling
history. Which side, then, is best placed to dictate the terms of a
joyous return of the naughty nine from exile? You might think that it is
up to the Prime Minister to take a step further towards them and their
fears about Britain's future in Europe. These fears seem to be shared by
the public, whose trust, too, Mr Major has to regain.
But, from what he said yesterday on BBC TV with David Frost, he still
has some pride to swallow.
''I believe the nine who are beyond the Conservative Whip at the
moment will be looking for opportunities to come back. I would like them
back. But they have to come back when they are content and we are
content that we are all marching in the same direction.''
He confined himself again to nods and winks about a referendum and a
single currency . . . ''I will not accept constitutional change that
impacts on the British Parliament'' . . . ''I don't believe anything is
going to happen that would remotely justify a referendum'' . . . (but,
if it did) . . . ''I would certainly keep open the option of a
referendum'' . . . ''if other people decided to go ahead in 1996 or 1997
with a single currency I would not advise the British Parliament to
follow them.''
This does not rule in a referendum and it does not rule out a single
currency after 1997. This is precisely what worries the rebels about Mr
Major and they still consider it a matter of high principle that
transcends mere loyalty to the Government.
Of course Mr Major has his reasons. A single currency is, for the
moment, profoundly unattractive and unfeasible -- but it might not be so
one day. Commitment to a referendum on any issue is a perilous tactic
(unless you can be certain of the answer) and one to be used only when
there is no other way out.
Fanatic Eurosceptics are matched in number by Tory fanatics on the
other side.
Pleasing the nine rebels by rewarding defiance might produce more of
the same among the Europhiles. Sir Edward Heath warned Mr Major
yesterday: ''There's no point in trying to compromise or appease because
it won't be accepted and we've got to face that fact. So we must
continue as a party that is strongly pro-European.''
It is one hell of a dilemma for Mr Major starting from the position in
which he finds himself now. He believes his stance is the correct one,
but he needs the nine if he is to stand a chance of sustainable unity,
of getting them all ''marching in the same direction''.
Without this prospect, his threats to expose ''the red underbelly'' of
Mr Blair's new-look Labour Party and its ''vindictive and harmful
policies'' sound like mere bluster. Labour has begun the new year with a
hangover dispensed by Education spokesman David Blunkett. The ''Blair''
of the dog, as one Labour MP called it, was immediately administered to
force Blunkett back into line on the issue of taxing private school
fees.
Mr Blair's spring offensive on Clause Four of the party constitution
-- to expunge the nationalisation ethic -- could fail. Other policies as
they emerge (and they have to start emerging now) may reawake Labour
factions for divisive debate. The glossy new look may be tarnished.
Ripe political opportunities are ahead for the Tories, but continuing
disunity will scupper their ability to exploit them. Mr Major knows it,
as do the Euro-rebels. Mutual trust might be founded on such knowledge,
but nobody seems to know how to go about it.

January 3.
Coming from a shipbuilding and marine engineering background I read
with interest your report Very British ship: built in Germany (December
30) anent P &amp; O's about to be sponsored 67,000-ton cruise ship Oriana. I
expected to learn from Allan Laing's report, my marine engineering
instincts aroused, by what means this fine vessel is to be propelled --
is she to be a steam ship, maybe turbine driven, a motor ship perhaps,
or nuclear powered?
I searched his description of Oriana's furnishings, many, varied, and
sumptuous some of them but despite plenteous descriptions of Oriana's
modus vivandi nowhere could I find a mention of that other and no less
important accomplishment, her modus operandi. It looks as if Oriana will
proceed about her business on a wave and a prayer, her energy fuelled
from the vast quantities of champagne, plovers' eggs, foie gras, and
suchlike goodies rich in alimentary propulsive power by metamorphosis
transubstantiated into the SHP vital to the activation of her propellers
-- if she has any.
Engines Oriana appears not to have.
I recollect the days when an earlier P &amp; O company built its ships in
the United Kingdom and remember seeing the Canton take the Clyde from
Stephens of Linthouse and being present when Canberra took the waters of
Belfast Lough.
That was in the days of yore when chairmen and their boards of British
companies were British first and foremost and only cut a figure
internationally when it was not against their own country's interests.
Where today is the British Merchant Navy? You have to play ''hunt the
thimble'' to find it. It is composed mainly of ferries and we have had
to charter other people's ships even to mount the mini campaigns in the
Falklands, and in the Gulf that yesteryear would have been accounted
sideshows against foes of second-rate calibre.
P &amp; O, that yesterday built its ships on the Clyde, at Barrow and on
the Tyne and Mersey, today builds its ships in Finland, Italy, Germany,
Japan, Singapore maybe, Korea perhaps, and now I understand in China
where for sure they have an employment problem but not one whit less
than the unemployment faced in heavy industry here. Patriotism butters
no parsnips -- and now money will even buy patriotism.
Sic transit ingenium Britannia -- but does it have to?

Barclay McBain recalls the wit and wisdom of Alex Stanley, general
secretary of the SSTA, who died at the weekend
HORSE players die broke, said Damon Runyon. Alex Stanley, the former
general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association, who
died at the weekend after a long illness, was a horse player.
Alex was a well-organised man with an eye for detail and we can take
it that he did not die broke. But his untimely death in Ninewells
Hospital, Dundee at the age of 49 has left Scottish education much the
poorer. Marie Allan, the SSTA president, said yesterday: ''In some ways
we feel cheated because he had so much to offer, not just to the SSTA
but to his field of education. I will really miss his personality, his
wit and wisdom.
''Nothing got past him. He knew so much and was so sharp, qualities
which were invaluable for his job and for serving his members, and
Scottish teachers generally, well.''
Alex became leader of the association's 7500 members in 1984. A native
of Wolverhampton, where his parents ran a pub, he came to Scotland in
1964 to study history at Dundee University. After graduating he
undertook his teacher training in Dundee and took up his first teaching
post in the city's Stobswell Girls School.
He moved to Rockwell High, also in Dundee, as principal teacher and he
remained in the school until he became SSTA general secretary. He was as
effective as a school representative as he was to become as a general
secretary.
Rockwell High was one of the few secondary schools in which the SSTA
had a majority of staff as members. Indeed, when Alex became general
secretary the SSTA represented about 22% of Scottish secondary teachers.
It now speaks for about 32%. The increase has been achieved at a time of
falling numbers in the secondary sector.
Alex gave the SSTA a higher profile and greater credibility. Before
his appointment it had very much been a professional association but he
took the union into the political arena. This was not a surprise for
those who knew him. He unsuccessfully fought to wrest the safe Tory
North Angus and Mearns seat from the late Alick Buchanan-Smith in 1974.
He stood for Labour, but later left the party.
Parliament's loss was the SSTA's gain. He was an astute general
secretary. Whether it was leading a campaign for better pay and
conditions for teachers or seeking a legal opinion to confirm a hunch,
he was seldom wrong. He had a forensic mind and did not care if his
tactical ploys angered or embarrassed central or local government.
What he did he did for his members. He was to have been made a life
member of the SSTA's annual congress in May. As is custom, the local
SSTA region was to nominate him. Alex's testimonial was prepared by
Lesley Anderson and Joe McKelvie, respectively Tayside region convener
and vice-convener.
It won't be heard now, but this is part of what they have to say about
their nominee: ''With his appointment as general secretary, Alex and the
association looked forward to a long period of vibrant and judicious
stewardship, but sadly that expectation was cut short by the onset of
serious illness in 1992.
''However, it must be said that much was achieved in those eight short
years. Some of the changes were association-led, others were forced upon
an often-reluctant teaching force, but in all cases the best deal was
always fought for and, more often than not, won.''
Alex announced at the SSTA congress in May, 1993 that he was standing
down in 1994 for health reasons. He was a tenacious character and bore
his illness with dignity, humour, and stoicism.
Alex was unmarried and the SSTA was his life -- apart from his love of
history and horseracing. He studied history as he studied form. Usually
he was the punter's pal. I recall lobbying teachers' pay talks a few
years back.
There had been a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, but little else. It was
Derby day and during a lull in the talks I asked him if he had any tips.
Yes, he said, back Corrupt. I did, and the horse and I lost, as I told
Alex during a later break in the talks. This did not faze him.
Recalling the horse's recent form, he said: ''Fourth in the Guinness,
first in the Derby. It's an old dictum.'' Thirty seconds old, said his
SSTA negotiating colleague Tom Wallace.
The last time I saw Alex was at an SSTA lunch last September to mark
his retiral. The Cambridgeshire Handicap at Newmarket was the next day.
Back Halling, Alex said. It won at 8-1. I had to admit that I'd
forgotten to put money on the horse when Alex phoned to ask how I'd got
on. I suspect he already knew the answer to his question. Rightly, he
had the last word.

JUST how big a problem is truancy in our schools? Well, a tiny one in
our primaries for a variety of reasons, including the fact that five to
11-year-olds are a ''captive audience'' educated in the same class all
day. And not a big one, it seems, in our secondaries where, according to
figures obtained by The Herald, the national truancy rate is only 1.4%.
Yet the Scottish Office is pressing ahead with plans -- albeit delayed
-- to publish absence rate data for each school in Scotland. They show
an overall absence rate of 6.1% for primaries and 11.7% for secondaries.
Truancy is defined by the Government as unauthorised absence. The data
clearly show, then, that the great bulk of absence is authorised. But,
as with all raw data, they must be treated with great care. Pupils whose
absence is authorised may be ill, attending a medical or dental
appointment, studying for external Standard Grade or Higher
examinations. But in some cases their absence may be condoned by
parents; for example, when a son or daughter is kept off school to look
after younger brothers or sisters, or when there is covering up for a
child who simply does not want to go to school. The youngster is
returned to school with a note, authorising the absence unless the
school is rigorous in chasing the matter up.
And in school? Attendance for the school year is divided into morning
and afternoon slots, double the number of pupil days. If you miss a day
you have lost two attendances. But if you miss even one period you are
given credit for full attendance since you have made an appearance in
the slot. That is another problem with the data. They do not tell about
period dodging, which can be a big factor in urban area secondaries. It
requires rigour, time, and work from the school to tackle period dodging
and chase up suspicious absences -- at a time when teachers are already
under great stress.
But it requires an even greater parental commitment -- no mean feat in
areas in which parents do not value education highly. It can best be
achieved by heads and staff working with their parent bodies. Social
context is taken into account, as are the many reasons for truanting,
and the many ways to combat the problem. Schools tend to carry the can
for truancy, but its background is much more complex. Information of the
sort to be published by the Scottish Office fails to reflect this.

A 35-YEAR-OLD woman was critical but stable in hospital yesterday
after a crash in Berwickshire. Ms Sandra Towers, of Shoreburn Road,
Selkirk, who suffered multiple injuries including serious head and
spinal injuries, was taken to the Borders General hospital, then
transferred to the Western General in Edinburgh. The driver of the other
car, Mr Colin Wilson, of North Road, Duns, was released from hospital
after treatment for minor injuries.

HEALTH Minister Gerry Malone sat through an hour-long lesbian sex show
at an exclusive black tie evening, a newspaper reported yesterday. Mr
Malone, who was the Conservative MP for Aberdeen South from 1983 until
1987 and formerly edited the Sunday Times Scottish supplement, was
reported to have congratulated one of the performers and told her:
''Thank you, I enjoyed the show.''
The show took place at a nightclub in London's King's Road during one

Sullivan. Mr Malone, the MP for Winchester, was not available for
comment yesterday but a spokesman for Conservative Central Office said
he had been unaware the evening would develop as it did.

LINWOOD
* LINWOOD High School seems an unlikely place to possess a remarkable
pupil attendance record. Yet, according to its head teacher, Ian Clark,
it has enjoyed that reputation for almost 20 years.
Since Linwood lost its car-making industry, unemployment has been rife
in the town. These are the social conditions on which educational apathy
and truancy feed voraciously. Somehow, Linwood High -- with an incidence
of clothing grants running at 36% -- defies the trend.
Modestly, Ian Clark confesses to puzzlement. ''I can't put it down to
a particular factor,'' he claims. ''Our procedures for investigating
absence are standard. We don't have a wide range of extra-curricular
activities to bring in pupils who might be tempted to absent themselves.
With a roll of 450, our curriculum is broad but larger schools can offer
wider options.''
Yet an absence rate of 9.7% -- of which only 0.3% is unauthorised --
earns Linwood High a Band One ranking, so it is worth looking for an
explanation.
After a morning registration period, details of attendance are
released to staff. Each period, class teachers scan the lists for
discrepancies -- has a pupil who checked in been ''dogging'' a period or
two? Pupils returning from absence bring in notes from parents and these
are checked and, if need be, followed up.
Perhaps a clue to Linwood High's success lies in the division of staff
responsibility. As in most schools, Linwood's guidance teachers know
most about the domestic circumstances, can relate patterns of absence to
the family background and usually trigger letters from school to home.
Where Linwood may differ is in the involvement of its senior
management team. They are in charge of year groups and, using attendance
data from the computer, they undertake a trawl of pupils whose absence
rate has exceeded 12%. After talking to guidance teachers, they may
decide to phone the home or send a letter. The knowledge that the
school's senior staff are taking a personal interest may help to
stimulate higher attendance.
Mr Clark describes Linwood High as ''a friendly place. The children
don't mind coming here. Bullying is rare and the cutting of classes is
not a problem. The report from Strathclyde's Quality Assurance Unit
spoke of the school's caring ethos. We also have many parents who
genuinely aspire for their children.''
Mr Clark is not worried about the publication of attendance data. ''We
can't avoid it,'' he admits, ''so let's use the figures positively. A
school with a high level of unauthorised absence has a problem and might
as well face it.''
He has two reservations about the basis on which absence is
classified. ''Exclusion from school should be authorised absence.
Offenders have been responsible for the action taken against them but
the decision that they will not attend is not theirs.
Secondly, to count study leave for internal exams as unauthorised
absence is to penalise a school like ours, where pupils benefit from
short breaks between exams. We'll record the data accurately but it will
affect our figures. I would welcome some discretion on study leave.''
There may be yet another explanation for the school's consistently low
absence rate. It may all come down to local expectation. Twenty years
ago, though it already had social problems, Linwood had a sounder
economic base. Education was seen as opening doors and parents and
schools, primary as well as secondary, cooperated in motivating the
children. That motivation included regular attendance. Even on that
thesis, however, Linwood High has managed to sustain the momentum for
two decades and that is no mean achievement.
EASTWOOD
* ''IF we are going to ensure equal opportunities for all our pupils,
we have to get them through the doors first.''
For James McVittie, head teacher of St Ninian's High in Eastwood, a
school proves its commitment to equal opportunities by offering all
pupils equality of access to the curriculum and the personal interest of
staff.
In such circumstances, school attendance should flourish. St Ninian's
serves both the ''leafy suburb'' areas of Giffnock, Clarkston and Newton
Mearns and the more disadvantaged peripheral estates of Darnley and
Arden in the south of Glasgow. It enjoys strong demand from parents,
with a consistently high pattern of placing requests. Two years ago, the
absence rate stood at 9.8%. Now it is down to 7.5% (of which 0.2% is
unauthorised) and the school's ranking has risen to Band 3. Such rapid
improvements do not occur by accident, so how has it been achieved?
Attendances are taken at the start of the morning and afternoon, and
lists are sent to all teachers. Latecomers must sign in at the school
office, and those leaving during the day (for example for a medical or
dental appointment) must produce a letter from a parent and be signed
out. The school implements a system of spotchecks on period ''dodging''
-- the pupils all know about it, though they are not always told when
the checks will take place.
The school's priority is to chase up those exhibiting an absence
pattern of 10% or more. The task of identifying these, and following
them up, lies with guidance staff. At a very early stage, they make
phone calls -- or send letters -- to parents, often inviting them in for
a discussion. They also talk to children returning from a period of
absence.
The approach varies. ''You know the children,'' says Mr McVittie. ''If
they are chronic absentees or the parents have shown themselves not to
be supportive, it is sometimes better to go straight to the formal
mechanisms. At the end of the day, you may have to involve the local
attendance council, so the parents and the pupil might as well be aware
of the situation.''
All the same, hard-core truancy is rare in St Ninian's and more time
is spent on youngsters known to be liable to miss the odd day or two.
The time-consuming nature of this extra pressure on guidance staff
worries Mr McVittie. His reaction is to define monitoring as a
managerial function -- ''Guidance staff are also teachers with class
commitments and the load must be controlled'' -- and he does this by
checking the absence lists himself.
He is a man with a management theory for all occasions and all
seasons. ''Principal teachers of guidance don't become assistant heads
all that often,'' he claims. ''Schools have to develop them and give
them freedom. We divide ours into two groups, covering the generic areas
of curriculum and partnership. For instance, at their first meeting in
the New Year they'll be exploring the social strategy.''
St Ninian's keeps attendance high on its agenda. The school keeps
adjusting its targets -- those with absence rates of 7% or over are now
being pursued. Mr McVittie consults his school board and provides them
with attendance figures every year. If he has concerns -- for example,
about increased absence just before holidays -- he sets them out in
newsletters to parents.
The school also recognises improved patterns of attendance by writing
to parents, congratulating them on the influence they have shown and
seeking their continuing support. In addition, guidance staff nominate
pupils for the award of merit certificates. Though these are usually
issued for attendance rates of 95% or more, they can also be given to
pupils who fall short of that target but whose rate has significantly
improved.
Mr McVittie is sanguine about the publication of national statistics.
''Just being aware of them,'' he says, ''keeps me on my toes. But it's
important to bear in mind that they don't tell the whole story -- for
example, a letter of explanation might be an absence condoned by the
parent. We have always known that, if a child was absent, there was a
problem -- now the approach is more legalistic, we're more like
policemen.''
The policemen are the guidance staff, ''who could be so occupied with
chasing up and classifying all kinds of absence that relationships,
careers education and personal and social development programmes could
suffer. Yet the published tables don't actually help us -- we already
know the figures for the school, division and region.''
St Ninian's will be less affected than most by the Scottish Office
system of recording absence. ''We have a lot of half-day blocks in our
timetable,'' says Mr McVittie, ''so period dodging is not all that easy.
And we don't operate study leave -- exams are held in class time and I
reckon we save three weeks through this.''

* JAMES GILLESPIE, chairman of Bellarmine Secondary school board in
Pollok, Glasgow, was one of three board members on the six-strong
interview panel to appoint a new headteacher. Each board member was
allowed to ask each candidate two questions.
Mr Gillespie, who had joined the board as a co-opted member
representing the business community, wanted to know what the candidates
would do to improve the school's absence rate of 23.5%, and overcome
parental apathy about school matters. He had done his homework by
telephoning Strathclyde region for up-to-date attendance data.
The panel agreed on the candidate they wanted to lead the school, and
he began work today. Mr Gillespie believes that tackling truancy in a
school such as Bellarmine is of paramount importance, and he will
continue to raise the issue. According to the latest data, unauthorised
absence accounts for 1.5% of the school's total rate.
Said Mr Gillespie: ''You can't expect good exam results if a quarter
of the kids aren't attending school. There are a lot of good people in
Pollok, but there are an awful lot who don't seem to be bothered about
their kids' education.
''There's very high, long-term unemployment which means there are
grown-up kids whose parents have never worked. There's a hopelessness
that descends on them after a while.
''They ask what the point of going to school is, and, if there's no
parental encouragement, it just gets worse. There are great social
problems and how they are tackled is beyond school, board, and authority
level.''
Mr Gillespie's concern about truancy comes from his job as manager of
Pollok shopping centre. After the heinous murder in Liverpool of James
Bulger, children were banned from the centre during school hours. But
before that Mr Gillespie recalls the police daily rounding up truants
and returning them by bus to local secondaries. Now, he said, thefts
from cars in the centre's parking areas increase during the school
holidays.
Dodging school between periods can be a big problem in urban areas and
the board chairman would like to see greater staff awareness of truancy
and procedures tightened up to check on pupil attendance each period. He
also favours the employment of many more truancy officers.
He also suggests linking payment of family allowance to school
attendance. ''I don't think that's unreasonable, because parents who
aren't ensuring that their kids go to school aren't doing them any
favours.''

Black marks could make
blots in some grey areas,
reports The Herald's
Education Correspondent
BARCLAY McBAIN, as he
anticipates growing
doubts over the
publication of attendance
data for parents on a
school-by-school basis
NEARLY four years ago the then Scottish Education Minister, Michael
Forsyth, announced new proposals to tackle truancy in Scottish schools.
He said truancy led to bad exam results, affected pupils' job prospects,
disrupted class work, and wasted resources. It also gave pupils the
chance to become involved in crime.
Proposing measures to combat what in his view was becoming a major
problem, he said he had been surprised to learn that there were no
national statistics on truancy.
Four years on, the Scottish Office Education Department is to put his
wishes into effect by publishing attendance data on a school-by-school
basis. The information will break down primary and secondary absence
rates into authorised and unauthorised categories.
It will be based on returns for the school session which ended last
June. The data must be included by schools in their annual handbooks for
parents.
According to the Scottish Office guidelines, authorised absence
includes sickness and medical and dental treatment while unauthorised
absence covers truancy and exclusions from school. Lothian region does
not recognise the guidelines for exclusions.
Education committee convener Elizabeth Maginnis said: ''We think it is
a nonsense to count them as an unauthorised absence. If a headteacher
has told a pupil to stay away, that is not unauthorised.''
Family holidays taken during the school session can be classified by
headteachers as authorised or unauthorised absence, depending on the
pupil's overall attendance.
Study leave for external exams such as Standard Grade and Highers will
count as authorised absence, although time off for internal exams such
as prelims will not.
Research has established a clear link between good attendance and exam
success and the Scottish Office had originally planned to publish the
attendance data with the SCE exam results tables which appeared in
November.
Perhaps to take account of resistance in the education profession, the
department postponed publication of the attendance figures. Critics
wonder if the delay can also be put down to the data itself.
Truancy is not much of a problem in the primary sector. Pupils do not
change classes in the course of the day and parents tend to accompany
their children to school. The data will show that, across Scotland, the
unauthorised absence rate last session was only 0.2%. Yet the Scottish
Office will devote page after page of tables to details of truancy
levels, many of them below 1%.
In the secondary sector, the national figures will show that truancy
is running at an average of 1.4%, rising from 0.6% in first year to 2.1%
in fifth. On the face of it, what's all the fuss about? Did Michael
Forsyth get it wrong when he linked truancy to crime? Certainly, the
present Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, talks more about a
''rising tide of truancy'' disrupting schooling.
The figures may, however, conceal some truancy because of absence
condoned by the parent. For instance, if a pupil who was well enough to
go to school stays off and later takes in a note from the parent
claiming illness, that is an authorised absence unless the school has
doubts and vigorously pursues the issue. The national rate of authorised
absence, running at 11.7%, suggests there may be an underlying problem
in some schools.
The grey area of condoned truancy is only one of the concerns many
feel about the statistics. Schools which continue to operate study leave
for prelims will now find themselves at a disadvantage and there is an
obvious temptation to classify all holidays taken during term time as
authorised.
With the workload issue remaining at the top of the teachers' agenda,
the time required to gather attendance statistics and chase up suspect
cases is already being questioned. After all, the main task of teachers
is to educate those pupils who turn up.
No-one should be complacent, however, about pupil absence, condoned or
otherwise. If parents are to be recruited to the campaign to combat
truancy, they need better information. Strathclyde region takes social
class into account when compiling its data on absence rates because it
recognises a link between deprivation and truancy.
Each year it gives each school a predicted overall absence rate based
on an average drawn from 10 schools with similar percentages of pupils
on clothing grant -- as a pointer to poverty -- and from social classes
one and two, professional backgrounds.
The school is then given a rating between one and seven which depends
on whether the absence rate is less, or more, than the predicted total.
Bands one and two are very good, three, four, and five are average, six
causes concern, and seven sets the alarm bells ringing.
But it is not a negative exercise, because schools with good ratings
are showing good practice which others may be able to emulate. The
information is presented to parents in an accessible way, allowing them
to see where their children's school is in relation to the others, which
are unidentified, with similar catchments.
''The system is to stop complacency at one end and despair at the
other,'' said Bill Coyle, the authority's regional inspector for
administration. A school in a deprived area might have a high absence
rate in relative terms, but it may be low compared when compared with
like schools.
''We aren't doing our job if we don't alert parents. It is very
important to get parents on board. Non-attendance is a problem for
parents and society, but it's also a problem for schools and they have
to do their bit,'' said Mr Coyle.
Strathclyde depute director of education David Alexander believes the
SOED could learn from the region's system of giving a single absence
rate with no breakdown into the various authorised and unauthorised
categories. ''Only the total absence rate of a school is a clear
indicator,'' he said.
''The concern I still have is that we have a huge apparatus to collect
all this data to demonstrate a low level of unauthorised absence.''

A CELTIC fan who was taken to hospital for a kidney transplant after
an appeal on the public address system at Hampden was recovering after a
successful operation last night.
Mr Joe Monaghan, 61, was travelling on a Celtic supporters' bus to the
Premier division match between Celtic and Dundee United at Hampden on
Saturday when his family in Greenock were told that a suitable kidney
was available. He had been on the transplant list for three years.
Appeals were broadcast over local radio but Mr Monaghan's son, Joseph,
31, said yesterday that his father heard the appeal at Hampden. Mr
Monaghan, a retired shipworker, was taken to the Western Infirmary where
the operation went ahead yesterday afternoon.
The surgeon, Mr Michael McKirdy, said it had gone well and Mr Monaghan
was beginning his recovery. Donor organs can be kept for between 36
hours and 48 hours but doctors prefer to use them before that.
''It will be a few days until we know whether the transplant has been
successful but, if Mr Monaghan suffers no complications, we would expect
him to be fit enough to return home in a couple of weeks,'' said Mr
McKirdy.
''We are delighted that he was able to respond so promptly to our
efforts to contact him and are grateful to all the organisations which
made it possible.''
Mr Mongahan had been having dialysis three times a week at Glasgow
Royal Infirmary.
Yesterday, Mr Joseph Monaghan said he had spoken to his father once he
had arrived at the hospital. He said he was focusing firmly on the
operation and had not been thinking about the match or the frantic
efforts to trace him.
''He was really just thinking about the operation, waiting to get
in,'' he said.

LABOUR yesterday demanded that Scottish Secretary Ian Lang end his
silence on the findings of an investigation into the environmental
problems facing Loch Lomond.
Mr John McFall, the Scottish Labour Party's rural affairs spokesman,
said nothing had happened since the Hutchison Committee produced its
120-page report in July 1993.
Mr McFall said that Mr Lang's silence was ominous and a strong
indication the Government was not really listening.
His bleak outlook is shared by other campaigners who believe they are
in for a big letdown when Mr Lang finally announces his plans. They
expect this announcement to be made at the end of this month.
The 1993 report called for the creation of a joint committee of local
authority and other representatives to guide and shape the future of the
area. The committee would have planning controls and should set up a
charitable trust and limited company to form an umbrella agency.
The report also recommended urgent by-laws to introduce zoning and
speed limits on Loch Lomond, with boat registration, numbering, and
licensing schemes, and with water rangers to enforce the regulations.
Other recommendations included an application for EU Objective 5
status for parts of the area, conservation controls and development, a
central register of accidents, and a variety of measures to educate
people visiting the area. The badly eroded footpaths would be
identified, repaired, and maintained, and efforts made to point visitors
towards other local lochs and waterways.
The report also called for a financial commitment from the Government
with 75% of the joint committee's expenditure to be funded by the
Scottish Office, with a doubling of expenditure on the area to #2.1m a
year.
Mr McFall said yesterday: ''Ian Lang must end his period of purdah on
the future of Loch Lomond and explain why he has refused to respond to
the plea from the committee to set up joint committees pending a full
response to the recommendations of the report.
''Because of his failure to act, the problems of road congestion,
litter, and erosion on Loch Lomond are considerably worse than they were
two years ago.''
Despite a promise to the committee two years ago by the Minister then
responsible, Sir Hector Monro, that ''money would not be a problem'', Mr
McFall feels the Government would be unwilling to provide the funding
the committee said would be required to set up management structure for
the lochside.
He said: ''Ian Lang's recent decision to overrule Dumbarton District
Council and ignore the protest of environmental groups by allowing a
housing-led development at Drumkinnon Bay on Loch Lomond makes me very
dubious about his willingness to take on board the concerns expressed in
the Hutchison Report.''
Loch Lomond is second only to Edinburgh in Scotland as a tourist
attraction and welcomes more than two million visitors a year. Tourism
and recreational use have been growing in recent years.

EVERTON'S #4m striker, Duncan Ferguson, will have one of Scotland's
most senior lawyers in his corner today when he faces an assault charge
in court.
Ferguson, who was transferred from Rangers last month, will be
defended by Mr Donald Findlay, QC, vice-chairman of the Ibrox club.
Two days have been set aside for the trial before Sheriff Craig Henry
at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
He denies assaulting Raith Rovers defender John McStay by butting him
on the head to his injury in a Scottish Premier League match at Ibrox
last April.
McStay, now with Clydebank, will be one of 20 witnesses including
police, match referee Kenny Clark, his two linesmen, and the referee
supervisor who was at the match.
Ferguson is already facing a 12-match SFA ban for the same alleged
offence. He has appealed against the ban but the appeal hearing has been
postponed until after the court case.

<TEXT>
THE makers of the Gaelic TV soap, Machair, are under attack after
revelations that they might be about to move most of its production to
Glasgow.
Savage cost-cutting on the series, currently shot entirely on Lewis,
has been introduced as Scottish Television bids for more public cash to
make the series.
The funders, Comataidh Telebhisein Gaidhlig, will not say whether the
rumoured pull-out is likely to force it to pay Scottish Television more.
Machair is currently expected to slump badly in the ratings in the
Grampian area where it is now scheduled opposite BBC1's EastEnders at
7.30pm on Tuesdays.
Not surprisingly, however, Scottish shows it at 7pm, opposite BBC1's
Holiday programme.
With up to 50 TV personnel staying in Stornoway for 20 weeks of the
year, the spin-offs to the island's economy since Machair started in the
spring of 1992 have been considerable.
But insiders at Scottish Television's headquarters at Cowcaddens in
Glasgow maintain that changes are planned for the autumn block which
begins next September.
One said: ''There is a lot of pruning going on because of a new
accountant we have here. He has decided that shooting on Lewis is just
too expensive.
''What is now planned is two weeks up there shooting external scenes.
That will be followed by five weeks in the studio in Glasgow.''
Labour MP Brian Wilson has been vociferous in his criticism of the
amount of Gaelic TV Fund cash that has been scooped by Scottish
Television.
Last night he said: ''The very large commitment of public money to
Machair was quite specifically linked to the economic benefits it was
supposed to bring to the Gaelic-speaking areas -- and not to scenery
hire companies in Glasgow.''
Last night CTG's director, Mr John Angus Mackay, dismissed the
production move as ''just speculation at this stage''.
No-one was available for comment at Scottish Television.

A DISPUTE over a small piece of land could scupper a #1m town centre
improvement scheme. The project might lose EU finance unless agreement
is reached quickly over #3000 compensation demanded by a trust from
Argyll and Bute District Council.
The Kent Trust, which owns a two-acre site in Dunoon needed for
alternative parking for 44 cars, wants compensation for time spent
negotiating the deal.
The Argyle Street Action Plan project was hoping to attract around
#300,000 in EU Objective One funding but, according to officials, time
is running out.
The district council wants the ground in the middle of Dunoon for
alternative parking while alterations are carried out to Argyle Street.
In October, local business people objected to the way the project,
which has been under discussion between regional and district councils
and the local enterprise company for over 20 months, was proceeding.
They wanted guarantees that customers would have alternative parking
when the street was closed during the work. Agreements were overcome and
the project continued.
The Strathclyde regional councillor for Dunoon, Mr Dick Walsh, who is
also chairman of the town centre working group, said: ''We are paying
well above the district valuer's price for this land and now the trust
want compensation for their time spent negotiating. We cannot pay this
until we receive details of the expenditure.
''It is make or break time for this important project. The delay has
been caused by the time it has taken for the agents working for the Kent
Trust to respond. Nothing can happen until we can acquire the land.''
Even if the district council were to find an alternative site, it
could be too late to apply for EU money.
A meeting of everyone involved in the project is to be held next
Monday and Councillor Walsh added: ''If we can't pull this scheme
together then, the money from the Argyll and the Islands Enterprise
targeted through the Cowal Initiative scheme could be lost. We are doing
all we can to save it but I am not confident at this stage.''
Concern has also been expressed by the local enterprise company about
the delays.
Following the departure of the US Navy from the Holy Loch base, a
consultant's report claimed that Dunoon town centre was dowdy and run
down and recommended the area should be revamped to create a pleasant
environment for shoppers.

<HEADLINE>Calves from Waldegrave's acres sold for crate raising</HEADLINE>

AGRICULTURE Minister William Waldegrave came under attack yesterday
after admitting that calves from his farm are sold to Holland and France
to be raised in the ''cruel'' veal-crate system banned in Britain.
Mr Waldegrave, who resigned as a director of the 1000-acre family
dairy farm in Somerset when he became Agriculture Minister, said he had
no control over who bought the bull calves once they are sent to Avon
livestock market.
''They go to market like any animal, and the auctioneer knocks them
down to the highest bidder,'' he said.
However the campaign group Compassion in World Farming said that
farmers were not forced to supply bull calves for the European
veal-crate industry.
The group's director, Joyce D'Silva, said the revelation about Mr
Waldegrave's farm put a question mark over his understanding of the
issues involved.
She said: ''The Minister, like all other diary farmers, has got to
take responsibility for the animals he breeds.
''Diary farmers are breeding hundreds of thousands of bull calves
every year. They have got to find some way of rearing them humanely.
''It does worry me that Mr Waldegrave has sent calves to veal crates.
''It does show a lack of understanding.''
Opponents of the veal-crating system claim that the calves are treated
appallingly, spending their short lives in cramped conditions in which
movement is impossible.
Mr Waldegrave, whose farm has a herd of 400 Friesians, has said he
shares the concerns of the animal welfare campaigners, but he claims it
is up to the Europeans to ban the practice.
Last night he said: ''I believe it is probably possible to produce
veal in a humane way. I don't like veal crates -- for the same reason
the Government abolished them here.
''Most dairy farmers, like me, don't like the idea of the way veal
animals are inhumanely treated, but there is unfortunately little they
can do about it.''
The problem was that 500,000 male calves were born to dairy herds in
Britain each year, when only the female calves were of use to those
herds, he said.
Britain had negligible demand for veal, however it was raised. If
raised normally, dairy cattle could not compete in the market for beef,
because they did not produce the kind of meat wanted.
Mr Waldegrave called on animal welfare groups to unite in a
non-violent campaign to convince people in Europe that veal could be
raised in a humane way.
His predecessor, Mrs Gillian Shephard, tried to get Britain's view on
humane treatment of animals accepted in Europe, and further attempts
would be made to change the EU rules, he said.
It is the second time in six months that Mr Waldegrave has been
involved in controversy surrounding his herd. Last July, as he faced the
task of convincing the Germans that British beef was safe, he confirmed
his farm had had ''a number of cases'' of BSE.
* Twenty-one animal rights protesters were arrested early yesterday
during the sixth night of protest against the export of live farm
animals from Shoreham harbour.
Police said five lorries loaded with sheep and calves entered the west
Sussex port at 1.45am through a crowd of 450 demonstrators. A police
spokesman said the 21 were arrested for public order offences.

DETECTIVES were last night hunting for a man who carried out a sexual
assault on a girl as she walked home through a graveyard.
The 14-year-old screamed for almost half an hour during the attack on
Friday, but her cries went unheard.
She was later treated in hospital for her injuries and is now
recovering at home with her family.
The girl was assaulted at around 4.15pm as she took a shortcut through
Craigton Cemetery on Berryknowes Road, Cardonald, Glasgow, after
visiting friends.
Detectives described their suspect as aged around 35, white, 5ft 8in,
of slim build with short dark hair, thin moustache, and a spotty
complexion. He spoke with a local accent.
Yesterday morning inquiries centred on a search of the area by
forensic officers while detectives carried out door to door inquiries.
Minutes before the assault, a man around 40 years of age, wearing a
calf length leather coat was seen near the scene walking a large brown
dog, and police said they were anxious to interview him in case he had
any information.
The officer leading the investigation, Detective Inspector Bruce
Kennedy of Govan CID, said: ''The young girl who was the victim of this
attack is very badly shaken and shocked by her ordeal. Despite this she
has been very brave and has been able to help us very much at this very
early stage of the inquiry.''
In England, police were hunting a sex attacker who abducted a
13-year-old girl after dragging her off a bike and bundling her into a
car boot.
The girl was cycling in Ness, a prosperous area in the Wirral,
Cheshire, when the man struck on Friday afternoon.
The girl was driven to an unknown house where she was forced up the
path by the man, who covered her eyes. He carried out a physical and
sexual assault before returning her to the car, and dumping her on the
M56.

MR Tam Dalyell, MP for Linlithgow, infuriated his party yesterday by
criticising Labour's plans for a Scottish parliament and regional
assemblies in England and Wales.
Mr Dalyell, who gave rise to the West Lothian question which
contributed to the defeat of the Callaghan government's proposals for a
Scottish assembly in 1979, said Labour's new ideas had ''not been
thought through'' and were ''inherently unstable''.
His attack is an embarrassment to Labour leader Tony Blair, already
trying to counter the scathing dismissal of the Labour plans by Prime
Minister John Major in a recent radio interview.
Mr Brian Wilson, the Labour MP for Cunninghame North, last night
dismissed the West Lothian question as irrelevant and said Mr Dalyell
was a maverick who would be arguing his case alone.
Mr Wilson, who opposed devolution in the 1970s, said he would accept
and support in Parliament the party policy on devolution. ''I think it
is a different set of proposals and a different political context and so
I think Tam Dalyell will be on his own.''
Reviving the West Lothian question, Mr Dalyell asked: ''Why should
Scottish MPs at Westminster be able to vote on purely English matters
while English MPs will have no say over matters devolved to a Scottish
parliament?''
He said that although some things had changed since the late seventies
when he first criticised devolution, the basic question remained: ''How
do you have a subordinate parliament in part of a unitary state?''
Mr Dalyell dismissed the Labour leadership's argument that it had
answered the West Lothian question by proposing regional assemblies for
England and Wales.
The regional assemblies would be merely talking shops with no
tax-raising or administrative powers like Scotland, he said. Devolution
had again become a major issue, and now, two years before the General
Election, was the time to address it.
Mr Dalyell's comments came as he prepared to speak on devolution to
Labour Party workers in Blaby in Leicestershire a week today. It was
important to know what was on offer, he said. If Scotland was to get a
subordinate parliament with tax-raising powers in part of a unitary
state, this would create problems.
He said: ''It would be extremely difficult to set up a Scottish
parliament. Think of the people in the East of Scotland who commute
between Edinburgh and London and all the relations we have. Who is to
pay tax and who is not?''
Mr Douglas Henderson, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne North, and a
Scot from Fife, said: ''Tam is kidding himself if he thinks there will
be an unholy alliance between himself and MPs in North-east England. The
North-east wants a regional assembly with equivalent powers to a
Scottish parliament, and that takes on the West Lothian question head
on.''
He added that the West Lothian question was resolved because MPs only
discussed general policy at Westminster and implementation was dealt
with in the regions.
Mr Wilson said last night: ''I would contend that in the 1970s Labour
was responding to the threat of nationalism whereas the present
proposals have been worked out on their own merits over a long period.
''I think everyone knows Tam Dalyell and the consistency of his
opinion but a lot of things have changed since the late 1970s, including
the relevance of the West Lothian question.''
Stressing that Labour MPs should unite against the Conservatives on
the constitutional issue, Mr Wilson continued: ''I think that any
anomaly which the the West Lothian Question throws up is a lesser
anomaly than the one whereby a party which gets 13% of the votes in
Scotland makes all of the decisions.''
He said Mr Dalyell's intervention in the debate, although not
surprising, would ''irritate'' senior party officials, but added that he
did not believe it would harm their case in the debate.

<HEADLINE>Animal rights a 'time-bomb' for farmers</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FARMERS have not yet woken up to the time-bomb that is ticking away
beneath their feet in the form of the animal rights lobby, an
international dairy conference in Glasgow was told yesterday.
Mr Ian Morrison, former Farming Editor of The Herald, said: ''Public
sympathy seldom lies with the farmer on any issue, partly because of the
perception that they are a bunch of spongers who live off the British
and European taxpayer. If they are seen not just as spongers but also as
people who pay scant regard to the health and safety of the animals they
care for then they are in real trouble.''
He told the Semex UK conference that it appeared farmers did not
realise that they were up against an extremely powerful and emotive
lobby on the animal welfare front. Matters had not been helped by recent
court cases in which farmers had been convicted of cruelty.
''When it comes to animal welfare I am pretty sure I know where public
sympathy lies and it isn't with the farmer,'' Mr Morrison said.
It was time the farming industry sought to form an alliance with
responsible elements in the welfare lobby, such as the RSPCA and
Compassion in World Farming, he suggested. These bodies recognised that
most farmers were concerned about treating their animals well.
On the issue of exporting young calves for the veal trade in Europe
humbug and double standards werebeing applied, he said.
''This Government has banned the use of veal crates here but they are
apparently quite happy to have these calves shipped live to the
continent and reared in crates. They are then brought back and sold to
us here in supermarkets as veal.
''No-one complains about that and no-one appears to see the
contradiction and nonsense in all this. The trade should be banned if we
believe what we say about crates,'' Mr Morrison said.
In general, he argued, there should be a move towards all meat exports
being in carcass form. ''I know the French want it live so that it can
be killed there and they sell it as French lamb -- and that is dishonest
too.
''The farming industry has got to get its act together on this. I do
not think it is good enough for an organisation like the National
Farmers' Union to say 'this is a legitimate trade and it should not be
disrupted'. It is a fact that in this country we are different -- we do
not like to kick our dogs and ill-treat our animals.''
Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave has insisted that he is
powerless, under European legislation, to ban live animal exports. The
same rules which enable Britain to demand action against French farmers
burning lorry-loads of lambs could be used against us if we tried to
stop the live export trade, he said last week.
He also has suggested that farmers should form an alliance with the
welfare lobby.

<HEADLINE>Farmer in threat to erect toll barrier on M74</HEADLINE>

A row has broken out over a motorway. CAMERON SIMPSON reports on one
man's battle to prove his rights to a stretch of the M74.
A FARMER has threatened to erect a toll barrier across the M74 in a
dispute over who owns a 110-yard stretch of the busy motorway.
Mr Jimmy Wilson, of Carmyle Farm on the outskirts of Glasgow, has also
warned the Chief Constable of Strathclyde that every one of his cars
will be charged half a guinea toll fee for using the road which he
claims forms part of his property.
Just over a week ago, Mr Wilson, 52, was charged by police with
illegally stopping his car on the hard shoulder of the M74 on the
Maryville to Fullerton Road stretch near Glasgow Zoo at Calderpark.
He had stopped to check his daughter's horses in a field. He told
police they could not charge him because the land was private and he had
the title deeds to prove it. However, he was given a #40 ticket which
could also lead him to incur three penalty points.
Yesterday, Mr Wilson took a symbolic drive along the hard shoulder of
the M74 with a horse and cart, knowing that Storm the Shire horse could
not incur three penalty points.
He said: ''I am monitoring the police usage of my piece of the
motorway and I'm planning to tender an invoice at the end of every
month. We are also looking at the possibility of a toll barrier across
the road and are already at the stage of studying designs.''
The procurator-fiscal has also been given notice of Mr Wilson's
intention to plead not guilty to the motorway parking offence and to
call Sir Russell Hillhouse, Permanent Under-Secretary at the Scottish
Office, as a defence witness to prove his ownership of part of the
motorway.
Mr Wilson has been in dispute with the Scottish Office since 1990 when
it compulsorily took over three to four acres of his land to build a new
section of the M74. Mr Wilson claims he did not receive any offer of
compensation and has been at odds with the Scottish Office ever since.
He said: ''I still have the title deeds for my land locked up in a
bank vault. The Scottish Secretary might have right of access to my land
but under Scots and mercantile law until the ground is 100% paid for the
property plus anything which stands on it still belongs to me. That
means I own that piece of motorway.''
The latest strand of the dispute with the Scottish Office began when
Mr Wilson could not get access to his own property to feed his
daughter's horses. He said: ''The only way to get food and drink to the
animals was to carry bales of hay and churns of water over my back for a
quarter of a mile, so I decided to drop the stuff off from the hard
shoulder of the motorway. After all, it is my property.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ''We have been negotiating over the
land. We have offered Mr Wilson an advance payment based on the
assessor's value of the land. We have also been in correspondence about
the toll barriers.''
In November last year, Mr Wilson marched a pair of Shire horses into
Glasgow Sheriff Court building during a case in which the city's
district council claimed that his farm animals were straying on to its
property and asked the court for an order to make him keep them under
control.
However, Mr Wilson told the sheriff he did not have any animals except
for his two Shire horses and brought them to court to prove his case.

FORMER tennis world No.1 Jim Courier broke a 16-month drought on the
ATP circuit by winning the Australian men's hard-court championship in
Adelaide.
Courier, who did not drop a set in the tournament, cruised past
unseeded Frenchman Arnaud Boetsch for his first ATP title since August,
1993.
Courier, who has slipped to No.13 in the world rankings, said after
his 6-2, 7-5 victory that his form was solid going into next week's
Australian Open in Melbourne, which he won in 1992 and 1993.
''I had seven weeks off before coming down here,'' third-seeded
Courier told reporters. ''I came here pretty fit and rested.''
Courier ran the Frenchman around the court in a powerful display of
hitting to pick up the $43,000 winner's cheque.
* SWEDEN'S Stefan Edberg retained the #390,625 Qatar Open singles
title with a straight sets victory over fellow countryman Magnus Larsson
in Doha yesterday.
Edberg, who picks up a winners' cheque for #52,500, edged the opening
set with a tie-break after Larsson fired five aces in his first three
service games. But 24-year-old Larsson was unable to maintain the
pressure as Edberg dominated the second set.

THE first guaranteed #10m lottery jackpot failed to produce a winner
at the weekend.
But the unclaimed windfall could lead to a scramble for tickets with
the whole amount rolled over to next week's draw.
The organisers, Camelot, said that no ticket matched this week's
jackpot numbers -- 2, 5, 21, 22, 25, 32. But seven people who matched
five numbers and the bonus ball -- 46 -- are expected to receive
#368,000 each.
Lottery spokesman David Rigg said next week's top prize could reach
#17m -- close to the #17.8m won by a Lancashire man in the first lottery
rollover last month.
The announcement of this week's topped-up #10m jackpot -- the biggest
so far in a non-rollover week -- brought claims earlier this week that
ticket sales had fallen below expectations, a charge rigorously denied
by Camelot.
It expects sales to increase when all 40,000 ticket machines come on
stream. Currently, there are about 11,000 computers in operation.
Lottery revenue is also predicted to rise later this year when an
instant scratch-card type game is introduced.
Mr Rigg said: ''Sales this week totalled #57.5m, up 7.9% on last week
and the second best week for sales so far.
''With over one million people winning again this week, the lottery
has made a great start to the new year. The total raised for the five
good causes in the first eight weeks is now about #110m.''
Mr Rigg expected the lottery's second roll-over would be won by more
than one person when the numbers are drawn next week.

THE first of many U-turns by the Government in the rail privatisation
process is underway, the Shadow Transport Minister insisted last night.
Mr Henry McLeish believes signals that the privatisation pill will be
sweetened were confirmed at the weekend by Transport Secretary Brian
Mawhinney's intervention in a row over a proposal to slash the number of
stations selling through tickets.
An exclusive report in the Herald last week revealed that Opposition
MPs believed U-turns in the rail sell-off process were inevitable
because of public concerns.
Now, Dr Mawhinney has warned Mr John Swift, the rail regulator, that
any proposal to restrict the number of stations where passengers can buy
tickets covering the UK network is ''unacceptable''.
Mr McLeish, MP for Fife Central, said that the warning had
demonstrated the Tories' growing political sensitivity to splitting BR
into 25 companies. He also forecast that more changes would follow if
the Government was to avoid humiliation at the next General Election.
A report is due to be published this week by Mr Swift, the passengers'
ombudsman, which sets a standard that rail users may be up to 50 miles,
or one hour's drive by car, from the nearest station where they can buy
a full range of tickets.
It would mean only 294 stations -- a reduction of around 1200 -- would
be designated ''core'' stations, where people could buy tickets to any
destination and have access to all the permutations and discounts
available.
It is understood Scotland would have between 30 and 40 such stations,
with approximately 100 other manned stations not required to sell
through tickets.
Labour's Trade and Industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, called on Mr
Swift to ''resign with honour'' rather than be held responsible for a
proposal which represented ''a complete betrayal of promises given to
Parliament, and would mark a major reduction in the standard of rail
services, as well as greatly inflated fares''.
Dr Mawhinney, MP for Peterborough, seeking to defuse the political
storm and calm passengers' fears, emphasised that the obmudsman's report
would be a consultative document.
He said Mr Swift was inviting ideas on how to guarantee network
benefits -- including through ticketing -- which were known to be valued
by the public.
Dr Mawhinney, already on record as favouring that through ticketing
should be maintained and readily available after privatisation,
stressed: ''If the regulator is proposing that the number of stations
offering through ticketing should be fewer than now, that is
unacceptable. There must be an improvement.''
Mr Wilson, MP for Cunninghame North, said it was unbelievable that the
Government had only just found out the threat posed to through
ticketing, and that the ''fiasco'' was a warning of things to come.
Ministers had debated at an early stage whether passengers should have
to buy separate tickets for each train operator's area passed through.
Mr Wilson said the regulator ''must not allow himself to be made the
political pawn of rail privatisation -- and then be made to look a fool
when Ministers retreat from the implications of their own policy''.
Mr McLeish said last night that rail privatisation would become the
Government's next humiliation, on a par with the poll tax, Post Office
privatisation, and VAT on domestic fuel.
He said the Government was in a state of panic, with supporters
''unwilling to allow the destruction of the station network''.
He added: ''This is the year in which the Tories will be confronted
with the public anger at the stupidity of the privatisation experiment.
''Tory MPs may be hoping for something better than their annus
horribilis of 1994. But Labour will be there to let them know that no
amount of soft soap can wash away the reality of the damage their
policies are doing to the country and to the Tory vote.''
Some industry observers believe an increasingly desperate Government
might even be forced, in Scotland at least, to reintegrate control of
track and trains because of growing public alarm over ScotRail having no
direct control over the lines on which it runs services.

THE LABOUR Party has called for improved supervision of residential
homes for the elderly in Scotland following a series of scandals last
year, including two disturbing cases revealed by The Herald.
Mr John McAllion, Labour's Scottish Health spokesman, said yesterday
that he wanted to see the appointment of old people's rights
troubleshooters and the establishment of a telephone hotline to
safeguard the rights of the elderly in homes.
The move follows the closure of two residential homes in Strathclyde
last year, after The Herald highlighted reports of elderly people living
in poor and sometimes horrific conditions.
Mr McAllion said that, because elderly residents of old people's homes
and nursing establishments were often very vulnerable, they needed
better protection.
He said: ''I would like to see a telephone hotline for old people,
their relatives, and employees of homes to call with their complaints.
''Old people's rights officers, with powers of inspection for nursing
homes, both privately owned and local authority, should be appointed as
a matter of urgency.''
He added that last year had seen a number of ''shocking'' cases in old
folks' homes in Scotland and that old people deserved to have their
rights protected.
''These measures should be right at the top of the Government's list
of new year's resolutions.''
Mr McAllion's plans have won support from social work officials.
Mr Peter Bates, acting chairman of the Association of Social Work
Directors, said: ''I whole-heartedly support both of these proposals. We
make every effort to let people know how to complain. But obviously a
hotline, like Childline, would be of great benefit.''
He went on: ''We have already seen the appointment of children's
rights officers because children in care are in a vulnerable position.
Elderly people are often in the same position.
''The appointment of older people's rights officers with real powers
is a good idea. Many old people in homes rarely receive visitors, some
never see anybody. A rights officer could keep in touch with them.''
Two residential homes were closed by Strathclyde Regional Council last
year following reports of elderly people being maintained in poor
conditions.
Early last year, the death of an elderly woman who had been a resident
at Glenglova Residential Home in Glasgow led to a fatal accident
inquiry.
At the close of the inquiry, Sheriff Daniel Convery condemned the
home's regime, stating that elderly people had been kept like livestock
for money.
Last month, Strathclyde region's social work department cancelled the
registration of Caldwell House, in Uplawmoor, Renfrewshire, following an
adverse report by social work inspectors.

POLICE were called to a theatre after fears that a man dressed as a
priest was stalking the panto's leading lady.
But Australian Rebekah Elmaloglou, 23, who played Sophie in the
television soap opera Home and Away, has been prevented by management at
Eden Court Theatre in Inverness from speaking about the incident.
When approached on Saturday, the last day of Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs, she said: ''I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to talk about this.''
The panto company manager, Mr Dave Meeke, said: ''We can do without
publicity about this.'' However, he confirmed police were summoned on
Thursday night by theatre management when a tall, burly, middle-aged man
in priest's clothing was found in part of the theatre where he had no
right to be.
He would not confirm reports the man was twice caught in Elmaloglou's
dressing room. However, he admitted the man had confronted the actress
in the theatre, saying he was a fan from her time in Home and Away.
A theatre barman said: ''We quite often get priests coming in here but
they normally have soft drinks. However, this one, who looked every inch
a priest, ordered a half pint of cider.
''When he followed this up with a pint, I began to take notice. And
when he asked for a double vodka I thought to myself this was no priest.
He could have been a fetishist dressed up like a priest. This might have
helped him get close to Rebekah.
''When I later heard there was a man in priest's clothing acting
suspiciously in the building, I said to myself: 'That's him.' When the
police arrived, I understand he tried to escape.''
The man was held overnight at the Northern Constabulary's headquarters
in Inverness and released in the morning. A police spokesman said: ''A
report will be going to the procurator-fiscal. It will be up to him to
decide whether he is charged.''
It is understood police do not think the man, thought to come from
England, is a genuine priest but that he does have religious
connections.

<HEADLINE>Angry Fife MPs to lobby Heseltine over Frances</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980451534</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of Labour MPs are to press the President of the Board of
Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, on the future of Frances Colliery, warning
that stopping pumping operations would be ''industrial butchery''.
The four Fife MPs claim it would also dash all hopes of creating more
than 1000 jobs; jeopardise the long-term future of Scotland's new
privatised coal industry; and could cause massive pollution.
They are angry at Department of Trade and Industry claims that there
are no realistic prospects of reopening Frances on an economic basis and
that no acceptable offers have been received for the Kirkcaldy pit.
British Coal has kept the pit on care and maintenance at a cost of
#1.7m a year since it was closed by an underground fire during the
miner's strike 10 years ago.
Kirkcaldy MP Dr Lewis Moonie and his colleagues, Shadow Chancellor
Gordon Brown, Mr Henry McLeish, and Ms Rachel Squire now fear it will
cease water pumping operations.
Such a move would deny Mining Scotland, which has just taken over the
Scottish coalfield with the exception of Frances, the opportunity to
carry out a feasibility study on the costs of redeveloping Scotland's
oldest pit. It was once the jewel in the crown of the mining industry,
and holds rich reserves of environmentally friendly coal.
The MPs are demanding an urgent meeting with Mr Heseltine to press him
to guarantee that pumping, vital if the pit is not to be lost forever,
will continue for one, or possibly even two years, to give Mining
Scotland a chance to undertake the #500,000 study.
In a joint statement, the MPs said: ''We are told Mr Heseltine is
considering stopping the pumping of water from the Frances colliery and
therefore sabotaging any future development. It would be industrial
butchery to turn off the pumps now when Mining Scotland are ready to
look at the feasibility of taking coal out.
''We are demanding that Mr Heseltine keeps the Frances open, allows
the study to take place, and gives Mining Scotland a chance to consider
reopening the colliery.''
He said the pit's seam of low-sulphur coal was estimated at around 100
million tonnes, giving the colliery a possible life of more than 40
years. Dr Moonie said there was no dispute about the rich reserves, but
a study was needed to establish the ''true costs'' of reopening and
operating the colliery.
He said Mining Scotland saw the Frances as its long term deep-mined
source of coal, ultimately as a replacement for Longannet.
Dr Moonie also said because the pit is at the bottom of the Fife
coalfield, the pumping is keeping the whole of the old workings dry and
preventing the water table in Fife rising, bringing polluted water into
rivers and water courses throughout the south east of the county.
''There's a vital issue here over pollution if pumping is ceased as
well as for our long-term energy needs,'' he warned.
Mr McLeish added: ''We just cannot understand the Government's
decision. It makes no sense, especially when it has established through
its own privatisation proposals, a new company to run the Scottish coal
industry.''
He said: ''You need life after Longannet, which will run for a long
number of years, but the long term deep-mine replacement is simply
Frances. That's why we are angry at Heseltine's decision. What prospects
for Mining Scotland into the next century if their key reserve of long
term deep-mined coal is simply removed by the actions of the President
of the Board of Trade to save possibly #2m? That would be a scandal.''
He called for a ''Scotland-wide assault'' on the Government to ensure
the Scottish coal industry has a future into the next century.
Mr Brown promised to raise the matter in Parliament this week.

<TEXT>
MRS Rosemary West now cannot get a fair trial because of press
reporting of alleged ''confessions'' made by her co-accused husband, her
solicitor said yesterday.
Mr Leo Goatley criticised as ''speculative'' and ''inadmissable''
detailed reports in Sunday newspapers that builder Frederick West, 53,
held his victims in remote farmhouses and tortured them before killing
them.
He was said to have cut up the bodies before taking them in bin liners
for burial at his home in Cromwell Street, Gloucester.
Mr Goatley, a Gloucester-based solicitor, said: ''I regard my client
as entirely innocent and that Frederick West was responsible for these
killings.
''Having said that, the detailed speculation in the press upon the
circumstances of this dreadful case cannot be helpful to my client.
''Such detailed speculation in the Sunday press may well be taken as
fact by the public, including potential jurors.
''I can only say again I am quite satisfied now that my client cannot
get a fair trial, if she is required to stand trial.''
Frederick West, who apparently hanged himself in Winson Green Prison,
Birmingam, on New Year's Day, was charged with murdering 12 women and
girls.
Mrs West, 41, who is being held at Pucklechurch Remand Centre near
Bristol, was jointly charged with nine of the alleged murders.
At the end of last week, Mr Goatley heard reports that newspapers were
preparing to run stories of alleged ''confessions'' by her late husband.
He obtained a High Court injunction against former legal clerk, Mr
Scott Canavan, over reports that he was offering handwritten notes of
police interviews with Frederick West for sale at around #105,000.
The court order, banning publication or broadcast of the material,
also was granted against Mirror Group Newspapers.
Mr Goatley said he was reviewing his position in terms of proceedings
''to protect my client''.
He added: ''In terms of regulating press coverage, I feel it is the
Attorney-General who should be vigilant and take any steps.
''At some stage it will be a judicial decision whether my client can
get a fair trial in view of the overwhelming press coverage which we
regard as prejudicial.
''It is the Attorney-General's responsibilty to safeguard those
procedings.''
Mr Goatley was commenting after Frederick West's son, Stephen, was
quoted in the News of the World yesterday describing how his father
allegedly admitted the murders during his visits to Winson Green Prison.
Inspector David Morgan, press spokesman for Gloucestershire Police,
said: ''The continued media attention and the way of reporting
speculative and inaccurate information in the Cromwell Street
investigation is still of concern.
''This has been brought to the attention of the Crown Prosecution
Service and the Attorney-General's Office on a regular basis.
''The content of some of the tabloid Sunday newspapers is a further
example,'' Mr Morgan added.
* A pub landlord was unrepentant yesterday after his plans for a party
to celebrate the death of Frederick West were condemned as
''revolting''.
Mr Keith Macauly-Fraser, a former policeman, is to hold the party at
his Hogshead pub in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, on Friday and has sent
out more than 200 invitations.
He said: ''Although the party is completely tasteless there is no harm
in it.''
The invitation declares: ''To commemorate recent momentous events,
Cromwell Productions, in association with The Hogshead, tastelessly
presents a Gone West Party.''
The mayor of Cheltenham, Councillor Deborah Griggs, said: ''The
thought of celebrating something like this is revolting.
''Not only is the invitation tasteless but it shows absolutely no
concern for the relatives of the victims who are completely innocent but
still suffering.''

Ayr 13, Kilmarnock 34
IT'LL be alright on the night is the theatrical way of dismissing a
poor rehearsal. If this applies to rugby, then Ayr should be successful
when they meet their Ayrshire rivals in what could be the Division Three
championship deciding match in March. Ayr were so much out of touch,
they will need a total transformation.
In the first half, the Kilmarnock forwards were dominant in all facets
deemed to be Ayr strong points. The home side hardly won a ball in the
lineouts, muffed most of their handling and were slipshod in tackling.
Each team fielded two Kiwis, and the performance of Killie's South
Islanders, Jason Sharp and Chris Flannery, epitomised the difference
between the sides on the day.
Scrum half Jason made darting runs from the base of the scrum and
slick passes to eager fly half Alistair McCall. Flanker Flannery ripped
into tackles from the fringes, and was always around as an extra back
when things got moving. In contrast, Ayr's New Zealanders, Gary
Etheredge and Jason Barbarich were rarely in it.
Robbie Stewart popped over two penalties in the first 16 minutes, then
Flannery set up a slick try when he trapped Etheredge. The ball went to
Stewart, then via James Adams to Mike Welsh and the winger was not to be
stopped.
Stewart failed with the conversion, but after a brief spell of Ayr
pressure, the full back slotted a tremendous 41-metre penalty.
Ayr were deemed to have collapsed a scrum early in the second half and
a penalty try was awarded. Stewart happily converted for a 21-0 lead.
The first real flash of Etheredge's talent brought Ayr a try. His
break was carried on by Richard Good and he fed Justin Horne who went
over. Etheredge kicked a penalty in 54 minutes but, three minutes later,
Stewart added his fourth.
On the hour, the visitors scored the try of the match. Kilmarnock won
a lineout ball on the right. McCall floated out a pass to Barrie and the
centre timed a perfect ball to Stewart, who drew a defender before
sending James Adams clear.
Centre Joe Hobson took over the hooking duties from the injured
Douglas Campbell and his slick heel popped out to McCall and the fly
half barged over. Ayr kept going and Andy Kerr's drive set up Etheredge,
and he fed Chris McDonald who crossed over.
Ayr -- J Horne; G D Caldwell, R Good, N Barrow, C McDonald; G
Etheredge, A Fairgrieve; S Kerr, J Lymburn, E Logan, J Barbarich, P
Dunlop, A J Kerr, D Smith, W Wyllie. Replacement: A Kidd for Wyllie (67
minutes).
Kilmarnock -- R E Stewart; M Welsh, J Hobson, J C Barrie, J W R Adams;
A W McCall, J Sharp; A Mawhinney, D Campbell, B Milloy, R J Carswell, T
Adams, K A Pattie, S Allison, C Flannery. Replacement: J Welsh for
Campbell (64).
Referee -- A Clift (Irvine).

<RECORDNO>980451537</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Labour Party yesterday criticised the Scottish Office for the
escalating costs of management allowances being paid by health boards to
GP fund-holders and claimed such payments were effectively ''bribes''
for GPs to opt for fund-holding status.
Mr Brian Donohoe, the Labour MP for Cunninghame South, made the
allegation after figures were supplied last month in answer to
parliamentary questions by the Scottish Office Minister, Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton.
These indicated management allowances paid to GP fund-holders had
increased by more than 4000% since 1990-91 until 1992-93 when they
accounted for an expenditure of #1.51m.
The figures showed that the bulk of the expenditure had gone to GP
fund-holders in the Grampian Health Board area (#539,000), the Tayside
Health Board area (#193,000), the Lanarkshire Health Board area
(#178,000), and the Argyll and Clyde Health Board area (#134,000).
Mr Donohoe said: ''The Scottish Office figures demonstrate very
clearly the bribes which are being handed out by health boards to
encourage local GPs to opt for fund-holding status as part of the
Government's NHS changes.
''These amounts of money are being siphoned away from health care to
subsidise the political agenda of the current Government, amply aided
and abetted by Scotland's health boards.''
Mr Donohoe said there were only four GP fund-holding practices in the
Ayrshire and Arran Health Board area, well short of the health board's
initial target of 10.
Local GPs had recently voted by a margin of nearly 20 to one to
continue their campaign of opposition to GP fund-holding.
Mr Donohoe added: ''These GPs have expressed their major doubts about
the principle of fund-holding and have stood firm against it despite the
financial inducements which are available.
''The expenditure of #1.5m in the pursuit of fund-holding, which no
doubt has increased further during the last financial year, demonstrates
the expenditure which health boards are having to incur in order to push
through the concept of fund-holding in the face of opposition from
GPs.''
He believed the Government would have been better to have supported
proposals such as those for a co-operative in Ayrshire in which doctors
would have worked together and reduced administrative costs.
''It is because of that experience that I am more inclined to
criticise the Government.''
A Scottish Office spokesman yesterday declined to respond in detail to
Mr Donohoe's allegations, but said: ''The increase in funding represents
the growing popularity of fund-holding and gives GPs a direct way of
improving health care for patients.''

BRITISH Aerospace is leading the race to win a #1000m contract for the
RAF's fleet of maritime patrol aircraft. Victory would spell good news
for its staff at Prestwick.
A fierce transatlantic battle will begin today when invitations are
issued to tender for a replacement for the RAF's Nimrod aircraft.
The Defence Procurement Minister, Mr Roger Freeman, will be at RAF
Kinloss in Moray today to announce the invitation for tenders. The
contract will be one of the largest issued by the MoD for years.
The United States company, Lockheed, is launching a full-scale
campaign to promote its P-3 Orion aircraft. BAe is working with Boeing
to offer a full refurbishment package for the RAF's present fleet of
Nimrods.
Other contenders include the Atlantique, produced by Dassau of France.
America's Loral Corporation is offering to refurbish old Orions which
have been kept in good condition in the dry heat of the Arizona desert.
The RAF's fleet of Nimrods -- kept at Kinloss -- entered service in
1969 and is showing its age. They fly regular lengthy missions -- up to
10 hours long -- during peacetime and are used widely for sea rescues.
Their primary wartime role is to search for enemy surface ships and
submarines and to drop depth bombs and sonar locating buoys.
The RAF is known to prefer the Nimrod refurbishment plan.
Unlike proposals to refurbish the RAF's Hercules transport fleet ,
which were thrown out last month, the Nimrod plan is seen as viable
because of the immense fatigue life of the airtime spares.

CHICAGO: Teacher Tom Dixey ate two insects after losing a bet with his
pupils. About 450 students at Argo community high school in Illinois met
the assistant principal's challenge to read 4000 literary works after he
promised to eat a mealworm if they did. Dixey ended up eating two, raw
-- one in front of TV cameras, the second for his students. ''I got a
little nervous so I chewed it more than I wanted,'' Dixey said. ''It was
crunchier than I thought. It had a musty flavour.'' The mealworm, a
beetle larva, was once was considered a delicacy in Greece and the
Middle East.

POLICE are to investigate claims that a detective at the centre of the
Frederick West mass murder case is trying to sell her story for #1m.
Detective Constable Hazel Savage, 50, is said to have contacted a
literary agent within weeks of the investigation beginning almost one
year ago.
Now the deputy chief constable of Gloucestershire, Mr Nigel Burgess,
has authorised an investigation into the allegations against Detective
Constable Savage.
Detective Constable Savage, a member of Gloucester force for 30 years,
received the MBE in the New Year's honours list in recognition of her
career and particularly her central part in the Cromwell Street inquiry.
It was thanks to her suspicions and investigations that the inquiry
began in Gloucester last February.
She uncovered evidence which led police to dig in the back garden of
25 Cromwell Street for the remains of the Wests' 16-year-old daughter,
Heather.
When her remains were found, police also uncovered other human bones
and went on to find the bodies of two more girls buried in the garden
and six under the house.
Meanwhile, residents in the village where Mr West once lived do not
want him buried in its churchyard, Mr Frank Cooney, the parish council
chairman, said yesterday.
Mr West, found hanging in his cell on New Year's Day, reportedly
wanted to be buried with his parents in St Bartholomew's churchyard in
Much Marcle, Hereford and Worcester, where he lived as a boy.
But Mr Frank Cooney, chairman of Much Marcle parish council, said the
''vast majority'' of villagers opposed the idea. It is thought that Mr
West's relatives may decide to have him cremated to avoid the inevitable
publicity a burial would generate.

SCOTS businessmen have been warned to use international air services
out of Scotland or risk losing them.
The blunt message came from Mr Vernon Murphy, managing director of
Scottish Airports, who said he and his team had done everything possible
to put the services in place and now it was up to the customer.
Mr Murphy, who travelled on the inaugural flight yesterday from
Glasgow to Boston by British Airways, said he was increasingly concerned
about the lack of business traffic using direct services and choosing
instead to interline through London or continental airports.
He said: ''It is not so much a case of use it or lose it, more use it
and get more.''
The airports chief disclosed that his company has sent out hundreds of
questionnaires to Scottish businesses asking them what their
requirements are and if they are using other airports and why.
He added: ''We have done our best with the airlines to put the
services in place and this innovation by British Airways is most
welcome. Now, though, it is essential that the services are used and
that they are used by the high-yield business customer.''
BA is to base a Boeing 757 aircraft, named Robert Louis Stevenson, at
Glasgow and use it to serve the five-times-a-week Glasgow/New
York/Boston service. Around #1m has been spent on refurbishing the plane
to offer a Club and World Traveller service for 161 passengers.
Mr George Cooper, managing director of British Airways Regional, said:
''We are confident that this service can work. We believe that other
airlines have failed on the routes out of Glasgow because they did not
get the cost base right and were not using the right equipment.
''We, however, are putting the low cost but highly efficient aircraft
on the route and think that it will appeal to a wide range of our
customers.''
Mr Cooper said there would never be any compromise on safety or
service, a veiled response to criticism that crews had been recruited in
a hurry and not properly trained.
Despite industrial relations problems which have led to the suspension
of the Birmingham to New york service, Mr Cooper remains confident there
will be no such difficulties with the new crews or with shuttle crews
concerned about an erosion of pay and conditions.
Airline sources have indicated that the new Glasgow to Boston service
could lose up to #900,000 in its first year but that the aim of the
airline is to have the service making money within three years.
Mr Cooper added: ''There are tremendous business and leisure
opportunities between Scotland and New England and we believe that this
service will appeal to these customers at both ends of the route.''

New York, Sunday
O J SIMPSON asserts his innocence in the murder of his ex-wife in a
book to be published next month, the New York Times reported today.
The former football star discusses the death of Nicole Brown Simpson
and his plea of innocence in her murder in the book entitled I Want To
Tell You.
The book, written in collaboration with Lawrence Schiller, is
reportedly in response to more than 300,000 letters Simpson has received
since his arrest last June on charges that he murdered Nicole and her
friend Ronald Goldman.
Schiller is a former neighbour of Simpson and a film producer,
director, and journalist.
According to the Times, Schiller said: ''One of the things O J said to
me in my first meeting with him about the book was: 'This is not my
biography; this is my response to the public's response to me, to my
pain, to my suffering.'''
The publishers of the book, Little, Brown and Co, said it was planning
an initial press run of 500,000 copies, the Times reported.--Reuter.

Harare, Sunday
A SCOTTISH doctor accused of experimenting on poor black patients in
Zimbabwe has become a hated symbol for those who say whites have not
shed racist attitudes 15 years after independence.
Dr Richard McGown's guilt or innocence is set to be determined
tomorrow, a day that many of the nation's 100,000 whites dread because
it could provide dramatic evidence of the deterioration of race
relations.
Black demonstrators are expected to gather outside the High Court in
Harare to celebrate if Dr McGown is jailed, and vent their anger if he
is cleared over the deaths of five patients he treated between 1986 and
1992.
Students have threatened to attack whites in the streets and
''amputate'' them if Dr McGown walks free.
Black MPs have likened Dr McGown to a Nazi doctor experimenting on
death-camp prisoners. His haughty manner during five weeks of testimony
that ended in August has fixed him, in the eyes of many blacks, as the
epitome of wealthy white arrogance.
Race relations in Zimbabwe, once seen as a model of harmony despite a
bloody anti-colonial war, are believed at their lowest ebb since
independence in 1980.
In the past year, stone-throwing black students have stormed
restaurants they claim cater for whites, scattering well-to-do white
diners. Banks and white controlled businesses have also been accused of
denying loans and opportunities for advancement to blacks.
Whites blame the tension on rhetoric from politicians, including a
warning by President Robert Mugabe that unless whites altered what he
described as ''racist ways'', blacks would form vigilante groups to
fight for their rights.
Mr Mugabe was credited with successfully steering the nation on a path
of reconciliation after the seven-year bush war between black guerrillas
and forces of the white minority government that transformed the former
British colony of Rhodesia into independent Zimbabwe.
However he has fanned black resentment in recent months, critics say,
in an attempt to distract attention from burgeoning social and economic
woes as he prepared for elections this year.
Mr Mugabe has complained of white opposition to a controversial land
reform programme aimed at handing over white-owned farms to landless
black peasants.
All of this has inflamed what might otherwise be a simple malpractice
case. ''The public perception of what happened is completely inaccurate.
It's been blown up out of all proportion,'' said Mark Stonier, a lawyer
for Dr McGown, who grew up in Glasgow but has long been a resident of
Zimbabwe.
Dr McGown, 57, who denies negligence in administering anaesthesia that
led to the deaths of five patients, among them a 20-month-old baby and a
young white woman.
The state earlier refused demands by Kenyan lawyer Charles Khaminwa,
whose nine-year-old daughter was one of the victims, that Dr McGown be
tried for murder.
Medical experts testified that the five patients who died were among
518 to whom Dr McGown gave spinal injections of anaesthesia since the
advanced procedure was developed in 1977.
Several experts questioned the wisdom of using the procedure in
Zimbabwe, where health services are short of staff, money, and
equipment.
Dr McGown, accused of varying the doses in an experiment, said he did
so out of concern for the level of pain the patients were
suffering.--AP.

Tunis, Sunday
THREATENED Western embassies in Algiers were working as usual today
after the weekend expiry of a Muslim guerrilla deadline for them to shut
or face having their staff killed in cold blood.
The German Government in Bonn said last week that its mission would
remain open, and telephone calls to the US, Canadian, and French
embassies were answered as normal.
Initial attempts to get through to the British embassy failed -- a
common occurrence with Algeria's often shaky communications -- until
after closing time when the telephone answering machine gave the normal
recorded message. The Foreign Office was one of the Western nations to
confirm last week that it had received the threat believed to have been
made by the Armed Islamic Group (GIA).
The threat, purported to come from the GIA, Algeria's most violent
guerrilla organisation, gave until yesterday for embassies to be shut.
It said that if they were not, diplomatic staff would be killed in cold
blood.
In three years of conflict between Islamic extremists and the
Government in Algeria, some 30,000 people have been killed, including 76
foreigners last year.
''The embassy is open and the personnel are working as usual,'' said
one diplomat.

CAIRO: Egyptian police today shot dead five suspected Muslim militants
in a town on the outskirts of Cairo.
The Interior Ministry said they were ''terrorist elements'', the term
used to refer to members of the Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group), the
biggest organisation of Muslim militants fighting to topple President
Hosni Mubarak's Government and replace it with a strict Islamic
state.--Reuter.

Washington, Sunday
THE great Islamic terrorist trial opens in New York tomorrow. The
blind Egyptian apostle of militant Islam, Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, and
11 others will be tried for planning a series of bombings and murders,
all allegedly part of a plot against the United States and the secular
West.
Some of the defendants have a heavy case to answer. They were arrested
while mixing oil drums of high explosives, the same stuff that was used
in the bombing of the World Trade Centre two years ago.
An informant, a former member of the Egyptian intelligence services,
had infiltrated the group and kept police apprised of their intentions.
They planned to blow up the two road tunnels connecting Manhattan with
New Jersey, the United Nations, FBI headquarters, and other buildings.
They are charged with plotting to kill President Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt during a visit in 1993. Some are charged with plotting to kill the
Jewish extremist Meir Kahane in 1990: the man who shot him was acquitted
by a New York jury, but convicted of possessing the gun used in the
murder.
The charges against the sheikh will be much more difficult to
substantiate. He has been tried and acquitted twice on similar charges
in Egypt. He was accused of inspiring the assassination of Anwar Sadat
and the campaign of Islamic terrorism in Egypt.
He came to the United States in the late 1980s, as an illegal
immigrant. He was tried a third time, in his absence, and convicted, but
Egypt has shown little interest in having him extradited.
Prosecutors will rely on a series of telephone conversations recorded
by police, the evidence of the informer, and other suggestions that the
sheikh was the mastermind, or at least the inspiration of the plotters.
His defence will be that he never inspired anyone to violence and that
because he is blind, he could have contributed nothing to acts of
terrorism.
The authorities believe that they frustrated a big terrorist campaign
by arresting the 12 alleged conspirators. They claim that they will be
able to prove links between them and the four men who were convicted of
bombing the World Trade Centre.
The worry, of course, is that other terrorists may still be at large,
may come to the US to carry on the jihad, and, perhaps, seek to avenge
the arrest of the two sets of defendants.
Jury selection begins tomorrow, and will probably take several weeks.
The trial itself could last for months.

Rome, Sunday
A TOP Russian general has declared the offensive against Chechen
rebels a criminal failure that could have drastic consequences.
''If it is not stopped immediately, the war will widen to all the
Caucasus,'' General Aleksander Lebed told the state-run RAI radio.
Lebed, who has previously criticised the attack, is Russian army
commander in the Trans-Dniester region of Moldova, a former Soviet
republic. Ethnic Russians in the region have proclaimed their
independence.
''With the war in Chechnya, the Kremlin has chosen the criminal, and
most stupid, way to resolve the problem,'' he said.
''Our troops down there are nothing but an undistinguished and badly
organised rabble of men who, without knowing each other and without
knowing where they were going, were thrown into tanks and sent to die.''
He said even taking Grozny, the region's capital, would be useless,
and would serve only to unite the Chechens into a war of liberation.
''We are repeating the errors committed in Afghanistan, with the
difference that 15 years ago the Communists were governing, and today
ex-Communists are in the Kremlin.''
He said it was a mystery who planned the action, but that person
should be put on trial.--AP.

FRIENDS of the Earth campaigns director Andrew Lees has been found
dead after vanishing in the jungles of Madagascar, a spokesman for the
environmental organisation said yesterday.
His body was found at the weekend in dense forest near where he was
last seen on New Year's Eve.
Two doctors who examined him said his death appeared to have been
caused by a massive heart attack.
Friends of the Earth said Mr Lees was found by a tracker dog after an
150-strong team searched the area.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: ''We are in close touch with his
companion and his family and will be supporting them as best we can with
the arrangements to have the body flown back to this country.'' A FoE
spokesman said: ''It is a great shock. Although we were growing
increasingly concerned, we were still hopeful that he would be found
alive.''
''His body was fairly near where he was last seen but was in a
particularly dense part of the forest which is why it was not spotted
sooner.'' Mr Lees, 46, was visiting the island off the coast of Africa
to carry out research. He had been there since December 14, and was due
to go home the day after he decided to go into the forest to film. Mr
Lees' girlfriend, Chris Orengo, and friend Dr Jonathan Kaplan were
nearby when the body was found.
Mr Lees was from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, and lived in north London.
He worked with Friends of the Earth for nearly 20 years, and was its
campaigns director since 1990.
He led legal challenges against the Government's environmental record
on issues such as drinking water, beaches, and wildlife habitats.
Charles Secrett, FoE director, said: ''Andrew was one of Europe's most
effective campaigners -- absolutely committed and he pursued with a
vengeance polluting industries and governments that allow enironmental
abuse.
''The environmental movement has lost one of its best and brightest
stars.''--

Jerusalem, Sunday
US Defence Secretary William Perry brought a stark warning to the
Middle East today: curb the spread of atomic weapons, or face nuclear
blackmail by rogue nations or terrorists.
Perry told reporters in Jerusalem that the United States was ''very
much concerned about the potential that Iran might become a nuclear
power''. He said: ''We do not consider that an acceptable development.''
The news came amid reports that Russia had signed a #500m deal to help
Iran complete a nuclear power plant.
Perry said: ''To the extent that this might lead in that direction (a
nuclear Iran), we'd be very much opposed to it.''
In a two-hour meeting with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Perry said
the United States wanted a nuclear non-proliferation regime applied to
the whole area, although he did not specifically request that Israel
join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
They also discussed press reports that Israel may have sold US fighter
jet technology to China, which Rabin denied.
Perry noted that Iran buys weapons from China, stressing that ''both
Israel and the US share the goal of preventing new technologies from
falling into the hands of countries that might use them in a threatening
way''.
Perry told reporters that he did not discuss with Israeli leaders the
possibility of stationing American troops on the Golan Heights as part
of any Israel-Syria peace treaty.
''We have willingness to discuss that but it is premature at this
time,'' he said. ''We do not yet have a peace plan and in particular we
don't have a plan for how peacekeeping forces might be deployed there.''
Later, however, Perry assured Israelis of continued US support and
reaffirmed ''the unshakeable commitment of the United States to the
security of Israel (and) the strong support of the United States for the
peace process.''
Earlier today, in Cairo, Perry said nuclear proliferation was ''the
biggest security threat that is facing the world this decade, the danger
that a rogue nation or terrorist will get their hands on one, five, or a
dozen nuclear weapons.''--AP.

EMBARRASSED Edinburgh institutions and individuals linked to Dr
Hastings Kamuzu Banda are endeavouring to distance themselves from the
one-time despot of Malawi, now under house arrest facing murder charges
in connection with the deaths of four of his one-time Cabinet Ministers.
Edinburgh University has denied his graduation there, the Church of
Scotland claims lengthy severance from its one-time elder, the Royal
College of Surgeons of Edinburgh would rather forget a lavish cash gift
from Dr Banda's impoverished people, and former Lord Provost Kenneth
Borthwick, Dr Banda's man in Scotland, pleads silence under Malawi's sub
judice rule.
Dr Banda, in his late 80s and said to be very frail, was toppled as
President of the Republic at the country's first democratic elections
last May after almost three decades in the top job -- two of them as
President for Life.
His arrest and that of one of his former aides, John Tembo, came last
week after publication of a judicial inquiry's findings that the four
Ministers were killed by the security services on the instructions of
the authorities. The two men are expected to appear in court today and
apply for bail.
Until the middle of last week, it was believed that the four died in a
car accident in May 1983. However, the judicial inquiry, set up days
after Dr Banda was rejected by the voters, concluded that the four were
clubbed to death by police using hammers and stones to simulate traffic
injuries.
Dr Banda is being held in the ruins of his home, the once opulent Mudi
House, which is still smouldering after an anti-Banda demonstration.
The former president has always played heavily on his claimed
attendance at Edinburgh University, and his entry in Who's Who says he
was educated there. But as details of alleged mass murder reached
Edinburgh University a spokeswoman there firmly set the record straight.
''Dr Banda is not a graduate of Edinburgh University. I do not know
where he did graduate, but it certainly was not here -- statements that
he is an Edinburgh graduate have no basis in fact.''
At the headquarters of the Church of Scotland, in which Dr Banda
served as an elder, a spokesman was emphatic: ''He has not taken the
discipline of any kirk session for many, many years -- I mean, a very
long time.''
At the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, to which Dr Banda gave
lavishly of his country's money when the college appealed for funds for
the construction of a post-graduate residence, the talk this weekend was
of Dr Banda's incarceration. Miss Margaret Bean, clerk to the RCSE,
said: ''We have spoken about it,'' but would add little more to the sum
of knowledge about the college's great benefactor.
It was, she emphasised, five years since Dr Banda last called in at
the Royal College of which he is an Honorary Fellow -- the recipient of
a dinner in his honour at which the college's famous son was told about
the pressing need for a post-graduate residence for students from
overseas . . . including, of course, Malawi.
The doctor appears to have left little impression among staff there.
Said Miss Bean: ''I spoke to him but just formally you understand.''
A cheque for many tens of thousands of kwachas -- the Malawi currency
-- followed that dinner. It came from Malawi's Treasury. The RCSE
refuses to divulge the sum on the grounds that it is not good form to
reveal the amount of a gift and considers it, as Miss Bean made clear,
an even graver solecism to ask.
Had the new Government in Malawi asked the Royal College for its money
back? Said Miss Bean: ''We have not had any contact with Malawi for some
considerable time.''
Mr Kenneth Borthwick, Edinburgh's Lord Provost in the years 1977-80,
knows Dr Banda particuarly well and accepted the post of Malawi's Consul
General in Scotland in 1982, the very same year that the RCSE opened its
new post-graduate residence.
He lost that job when Dr Banda ceased last year to be President for
Life . . . ''when there was a change'' is the way Mr Borthwick puts it.
Mr Borthwick says he met Dr Banda on a number of occasions . . .
''well, you know, always in connection with the consular thing,'' and
recalls that Malawi's leader of 30 years was an elder of Guthrie
Memorial Church in Edinburgh in 1941.
What did he think of the charges about to be laid against Dr Banda as
his erstwhile boss awaits behind his badly charred front door?
Edinburgh's former civic leader said: ''I've nothing to say at all about
that. It is sub judice, you know.''
The Malawi High Commission in London was last night unavailable to
comment on Dr Banda's alleged connection with Edinburgh University, or
any plans it might have to ease Malawi's acute economic crisis by asking
the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh for its money back.

AUSTRALIA yesterday earned a 34-run win over their A side in a World
Series match at the Gabba in Brisbane.
The A team, chasing 253 for victory, looked well placed at 166 for two
after 35 overs. But against impressive pace bowling by Craig McDermott
and good ground-fielding which brought two run-outs, the A team
faltered, collapsing to be all out for 218.
Australia had reached 252 for five in their 50 overs after captain
Mark Taylor had won the toss, with Mark Waugh making 93 in 102 balls and
David Boon unbeaten on 86.
Australia A, who have won two of their five matches in the
competition, now must beat England in Sydney on Thursday if they are to
join Australia in the finals. Scores:
Australia 252 for five (M Waugh 93, D Boon 86 n.o., Australia A 218 (G
Blewett 63, M Hayden 51).

In Islamabad
FOREIGN Secretary Douglas Hurd arrived here last night to face a
barrage of questions about Britain's attitude in the dispute between
India and Pakistan over Kashmir.
It is seen as significant that he is visiting both countries in turn
and there are fears that he may be backing India, or that he has come to
attempt some kind of mediation.
However he is not here to negotiate or support either side. He said on
arrival that violence had been encouraged in Kashmir, but refused to
speculate as to its source.
''I'm not saying that this is the heart of the problem,'' he said.
''There is a real problem about Kashmir and the wishes of its people and
it is not helped, indeed it is hindered, by the encouragement of
violence.''
Human rights had to be protected, he said. Then there was a
possibility of a political process beginning in Kashmir. He believed
such a possibility existed, but it was not a certainty. The dispute
between the two countries has been going on for at least 40 years.
''Those who thought if time passed the problem of Kashmir would solve
itself were incorrect,'' said Mr Hurd.
''In the British view, there are three essentials if there is to be
substantial progress.
''There has to be dialogue between India and Pakistan; there has to be
a democratic political process in Kashmir, so that there are elected
Kashmiris who can speak for the people; and there has to be an end to
the encouragement of violence from outside.''
No one step in itself would be sufficient but all three were needed if
any progress was to be made, he said.
The political process had to be accompanied by respect for human
rights, correct conduct by the security forces, and free access for
international observers.

MARK Ilott faces a worrying 24 hours after breaking down with a side
injury in India yesterday. Ilott was forced off the field for treatment
after tea as England A fought hard in draining heat to contain a Board
Presidents XI to 255 for three on a batsman's paradise of a pitch in
Madras.
The Essex left-arm paceman hopes to be fit enough to bowl again in the
match, but physio Wayne Morton is waiting until this morning before
saying whether he will allow the player to take the field.
Ilott is desperate for his career not to be upset once again by
injury. The 24-year-old played three Tests in 1993 and had an
outstanding A tour of South Africa last winter, but a groin injury
flared up badly last summer.
He was in the England 13 for the first Test against New Zealand in
June, but missed out of the next Test at Lord's because of the injury --
Northamptonshire's Paul Taylor getting a call-up instead. But by the
time he was fit again, Darren Gough and Phil Defreitas had established
themselves in the England seam attack.
Ilott's hopes of further England recognition rose again, however, just
before Christmas when he was summoned to Australia to join the senior
squad as cover. He was with Mike Atherton's side for a fortnight,
without being needed, before flying back to join the A tour in Bombay
last week.
Ilott missed the opening match of the India tour because he did not
arrive from Australia early enough, but sees the coming weeks as the
perfect opportunity to force his way into the full England side next
summer.
Yesterday, he struck an early blow with the new ball after captain
Alan Wells had condemned his side to a day in the field by losing the
toss. And Ilott, sharp enough to force some bounce from an otherwise
lifeless surface, then almost had opener Vikran Rathore caught at mid-on
mis-hooking.
But then Rathore (59) and classy left-hander Saurav Ganguly (69) added
92 in attractive style, forcing the A team back on the defensive.
Leg spinner Ian Salisbury took two for 33 from 17 overs, bowling right
through from lunch to tea, while Kent slow left-armer Min Patel in his
first big representative match, settled down impressively in a 14-over
spell costing only 30 runs.
The final session followed a similar pattern, this time with seamers
Dominic Cork and Richard Johnson joining in to frustrate the Indians.
Only 68 runs came after tea from 28 overs -- there were just 78 runs
from 35 overs too in the middle session -- but the talented Rahul Dravid
made sure the Presidents XI did not throw away their advantage. At the
close he was 72 not out, adding 95 with the dour Shamshad Rizwan.

Sarajevo, Sunday
THE United Nations military commander in Bosnia tried today to rescue
plans to implement a ceasefire, but the Bosnian Serbs raised fresh
conditions which could further delay the process.
Britain's Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose held hurriedly arranged
talks with the commander of the Bosnian Serb army, General Ratko Mladic,
in the ski resort of Jahorina in the mountains above Sarajevo.
Talks on finalising details of the ceasefire were in deadlock over a
row about a demilitarised zone (DMZ) near the Bosnian capital.
A UN spokesman said Mladic had disagreed with Rose over the size of
the zone and demanded that the Bosnian Government yield territory around
it which they have seized in raids over the past year.
The truce talks also hit a snag over the failure by Muslim-led forces
to withdraw from three lookouts on Mount Igman.
General Rose assured Mladic that, to the best of his knowledge, the
Bosnian soldiers had vacated their positions.
''The Serbs now want to include some areas (in the DMZ) taken by
government forces after they moved into it . . . This is a bit annoying
for the ceasefire process,'' he added.
The setback emerged as a senior US official told the Bosnian
Government that a peace plan drawn up by the Big Power ''contact group''
was only a basis for further negotiation rather than the Nato-backed
unconditional deal it once was.
Richard Holbrooke, assistant US secretary of state for east European
affairs, said he had come to consult Bosnian leaders ''on the future
plans of the Contact Group . . . (and to) revitalise the peace
process''.
Dismayed government leaders noted that they, unlike the Bosnian Serbs,
had accepted the division of land laid out by the Big Powers. If the
plan was no longer firm, the peace process was back to square one, they
added.--Reuter.

A BARGAIN has been struck between the opposing factions which once
formed the Free Presbyterian Church, which involves them dividing
legacies of people who died before the church split in 1989.
The first case involving such a legacy, understood to be more than
#50,000, came to the Court of Session recently. It was eventually
decided by an out of court agreement between the continuing Free
Presyterian Church and the breakaway Associated Presbyterian Churches on
a 50-50 basis.
The estate in question belonged to Miss Barbara ''Barrie'' Campbell of
Halkirk in Caithness who died before 1989 leaving the bulk of her estate
to the Free Presbyterian Church.
The APC had staked a claim through its lawyers on the grounds that the
APC was the true FP church and had the case come to court it would have
involved showing that Miss Campbell would have been likely to have
joined the APC had she lived until 1989.
The matter was referred to the Court of Session by Miss Campbell's
executor, inviting claims, but agreement was reached by the churches
late last year. Although this has prevented the Court of Session giving
a ruling, it is understood there are several other outstanding estates
prior to 1989 which involve the same disputed claims.
The Clerk to the Scottish APC Presbytery, Mr David Laing, a partner in
an Aberdeen law firm, confirmed a settlement had been reached concerning
Miss Campbell's estate.
He said the pressure to go to the Court of Session had come from the
executor as a means of resolving the matter and although both churches
disputed each other's claims to be the true FP Church, both have agreed
it was ''a waste of a legacy for it to be spent on Court of Session
fees''.
As matters stand it is still the position of both factions that they
are the true church and further cases could still be the subject of a
reference to the Court of Session.
Miss Campbell's estate was originally left to the former FP minister
in Halkirk, the Rev Donald A Maclean and his wife Jessie. Mr Maclean
left the FP Church in 1981 to join the Church of Scotland from which he
has now retired. Although Miss Campbell was suffering from senile
dementia in 1981, her will was changed in favour of the FP Church 11
days after the Macleans left Halkirk. The truce over legacies between
the factions of the former FP Church has so far also extended to church
buildings and manses which were in many cases taken over by the
breakaway denomination.
In Lairg and Aberdeen both church and manse are occupied by the APC
group, but in Dumbarton and Gilmore Place, Edinburgh, the APC have
handed over the church building to the FPs.
''So far both sides have felt it was not appropriate to engage in
litigation,'' Mr Laing said.
The Gilmore Place building was the church in which Britain's most
famous FP, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, worshipped until his attendance at
a requiem mass resulted in the discipline case which sparked off the
secession of 1989. If there is a truce over legacies, the bitterness of
that period has nevertheless survived in recent articles in the FP
magazine which attack APCs for ''apostasy'' in sharing worship with
other denominations, a matter for dismissal in the former FP Church.
The denomination, which also outlaws prayers for the dead, has
profited from deceased persons in previous years. Although the church at
its peak had less than 6000 members, it acquired considerable wealth
from a legacy giving it a controlling interest in a department store in
Edinburgh's Princes Street.
Legal representatives of the Free Presyterian Church were unavailable
for comment last night.

BORIS Becker believes his chances of a sixth Grand Slam title are
growing by the day as he prepares to venture out into Australia's fierce
summer heat for the first time in two years.
Becker's most recent trips Down Under have been for indoor events, and
in Perth on Saturday he helped Germany win the Hopman Cup in the
air-conditioned Burswood Dome by disposing of the Ukraine.
He missed last year's Australian Open to attend the birth of his son
Noah, but set off for Melbourne yesterday convinced his form is good
enough to cope with whatever the elements have in store.
''So far my preparation could not have been better,'' said the
three-times Wimbledon champion, who has entered this week's Colonial
Classic at Kooyong in the final run-up to the Open starting next Monday.
''I wanted three matches and got that in Perth, but now the outdoor
season starts -- I have a week to get out and get used to the hot
weather.
''I'm in very good shape right now. I'm playing better and better as
the days go by and everything is going to plan.''
Becker, whose Australian Open victory in 1991 remains his most recent
Grand Slam success, has already convinced several opponents that he is
close to the form which earned him the world No.1 position that year.
Andrei Medvedev, beaten in three sets by the German in their singles
rubber in the Hopman Cup final, warned: ''I knew he was serious about
playing in Australia and trying to get the number one spot back. I think
you should expect a different Boris this year, that's for sure.''
France's Jean-Philippe Fleurian, another Hopman Cup victim, believes
Becker has perfected the art of pacing himself for the major events.
''In the first few rounds he always takes his time. It's only in the
later rounds that he starts to serve and volley and come to the net. I
think he's back.''
Becker has the opportunity to prove the point at Kooyong, where the
eight-man field includes four other Wimbledon champions, Pete Sampras,
Stefan Edberg, Michael Stich, and Pat Cash.
In the Hopman Cup final, Anke Huber came through some sticky moments
against Natalia Medvedeva in the second and third sets before shaking
off her determined opponent 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 in the opening singles.
Medvedev also took Becker to a third set. The German served five
successive aces during the second set, only for Medvedev to level the
match by taking the subsequent tiebreak 7-3.
Becker, though, gradually reasserted himself to wrap up a 6-3, 6-7,
6-3 victory in two-and-a-quarter hours.
Becker and Huber received an additional bonus in the shape of
diamond-studded tennis balls worth #14,062 apiece, and Germany claimed a
3-0 winning margin when Medvedev was unable to take his place in the
doubles because of hamstring injuries.

NICOSIA: Russia has agreed to complete work on a nuclear power plant
on Iran's Gulf coast in a deal worth #533m. German firms began work on
the Bushehr plant in 1974, before Iran's Islamic revolution. The project
was later halted and the plant was heavily damaged by bombing raids
during the Iran-Iraq war. The plant's director now expects Moscow to
finish the first unit of the plant within four years. Tehran has
dismissed media reports in which US and Israeli officials said that Iran
was much closer to producing nuclear weapons than previously thought,
maybe within five years.

GARY Smith returned from injury to win the 16-and-under boys' singles
at the David Lloyd/Dalgetty junior tennis tournament in Renfrew on
Saturday.
The 14-year-old broke a wrist in April but did not drop a set in four
matches, ending with a 6-3, 7-5 victory over his David Lloyd squad-mate
Grant Gordon, and a 6-2, 6-2 win against Mark Izatt to lift his first
title in nine months.
Suyogi Jigajinni clinched the 18-and-under crown with a 6-3, 7-5
victory over Ben Saunders, while Jordan Gray upset top-seed Tommy
Ogilvie 7-5, 6-1 in the 14-and-under final. Steven Milne edged past
Russell Allan 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 to win the 12-and-under age group.
Clare Young's 6-2, 6-1 win over Pippa Downes gave her the 16-and-under
girls' title, while the 14-and-under event was won by Sarah McFadyen,
who defeated 11-year-old Elena Baltacha 7-5, 6-1.

A SIX-FIGURE reward is being offered for information leading to the
return of a #5m Titian painting stolen in a night-time raid at Longleat
House, the home of Lord Bath.
He yesterday spoke of his distress at losing the painting, the pride
of the extensive collection at his sixteenth century Wiltshire home. He
believed it could have been stolen to order for private sale or ransom.
The painting, Rest on the Flight to Egypt, shows Mary cradling the
infant Jesus as she rests on her journey while Joseph looks on.
It hung on the wall of the State Drawing Room and was linked to the
alarm system. The thieves damaged the frame as it was removed.
Mr Tim Moore, the Baths' land agent, who was first on the scene, said
they feared that the well-planned burglary was the work of a gang
plundering art treasures from stately homes throughout England.
Lord Bath, who lives in apartments nearby, said: ''It all happened so
quickly. The painting brought pleasure to thousands of visitors to
Longleat. It is a tragedy.''
The raid has the hallmarks of a November break-in last year at Lord
Pembroke's home at Wilton House, near Salisbury, when thieves took a
painting of Rembrandt's mother, valued at #300,000.
Two other paintings were stolen in the Longleat raid. They were a
sixteenth century portrait of Eleanor of Austria attributed to the
circle of Joos van Cleve, and A Personification of Justice by Bonifzio
Veronese -- a painting of a seated female figure. Both are valued at
around #10,000 each.
The reward is likely to be at least six figures, according to Mr Mark
Dalrymple, spokesman for loss adjusters Tyler &amp; Co of London, which acts
for Nordstern Art Insurance Ltd.

MISS Doris Robertson, who has died aged 81, spent almost 60 years
encouraging ordinary people in Scotland, particularly women, to keep
themselves fit.
She was a PE specialist with the Scottish Council for Physical
Recreation (later to become the Sports Council) after the Second World
War.
This was a time when it introduced people to the wide range of outdoor
activities Scotland had to offer. She was part of the teaching team at
the first course held at Glenmore Lodge.
However, her salaried work with the SCPR was only one avenue through
which she influenced health and well-being, particularly in Glasgow.
Not only was she a superb teacher but an efficient organiser, and was
dedicated to the ideal that physical exercise could enable people to
free themselves from the limitations of their environment.
Before the war she had been a pioneer worker in the Glasgow Keep Fit
Movement, one of the few outlets for young women wanting recreational
activities at that time.
She was always active in keeping the Scottish Keep Fit Movement in
touch with latest thinking on women's health, for instance, by
introducing some of the ideas of Medau rhythmic movement and the Laban
dance method. She inspired several generations of pupils with the
conviction that ''if you move well you feel well''.
Doris Robertson was also a stalwart of Scottish country dancing which
went back to her days as a student at PE College at Dunfermline. Soon
afterwards she was selected for the Scottish team which toured South
Africa.
For many years she was a country dance examiner touring Canada and the
United States. She was also an external examiner of teachers at the
League of Health and Beauty and the Medau Society.
She was involved, through Age Concern, in encouraging the elderly to
keep fit as a means of proving that ''age is all in the mind''.
Until very recently -- although considerably older than some of her
pupils -- she taught classes and gave talks to retired people around the
West of Scotland.

Melrose 16, Selkirk 6
ON a dreich, dark, and overcast afternoon at The Greenyards, both
sides, depleted by injuries and international calls, strived to
illuminate proceedings in a dour Border League struggle.
But, in a game played on a heavy pitch and dominated by the boot,
champions Melrose avenged their defeat by Selkirk at Philiphaugh four
weeks ago to keep alive their hopes of retaining the trophy.
Selkirk, for whom scrum half Andy Lindores was sharp around the
fringes, and the driving runs of Billy Gentleman proved effective, were
always chasing the game after the interval.
Stevie Scott and Robbie Brown in the pack served Melrose well and
Craig Chalmers was steady at stand-off, but the threequarters were
easily knocked back by Selkirk's tackling.
Melrose scored the only try through the most adventurous player
afield, full back Derek Bain, who took a pass from winger Andy Purves
four minutes from the interval to squeeze in at a corner.
Chalmers converted to give his side a flattering 7-3 interval lead.
Centre Jeremy Brett slotted a penalty for Selkirk, but missed three
others.
In the second half, the boot of Chalmers helped Melrose stretch their
lead to 13-3, although the international stand-off also missed two, as
did Brett, who, at the third attempt, cut into Melrose's lead before
Chalmers wrapped up the points three minutes from the end.
Melrose -- D C Bain; R N Brown, I S Leighton, A G Shiel, A Purves; C M
Chalmers, D K Shiel; M G Browne, S Scott, D Lunn, R R Brown, E M
Simpson, A J Kerr, K J McLeish, D Sutherland. Replacement -- A Redpath
for McLeish (40min.).
Selkirk -- S Tomlinson; K Johnstone, M Jaffray, J Brett, S Lowrie; J

(75).

TRIBUTESare pouring in for comedian Larry Grayson, who died at home a
week after being taken to hospital with a perforated appendix.
The veteran entertainer collapsed in the early hours of Saturday while
being cared for by friends and family in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. He was
71.
Hours earlier, he had been allowed home from hospital and was laughing
and joking with friends.
One said: ''He was making everyone laugh. It was a great relief. He
was weak but everyone thought he was getting well.''
Danny la Rue, speaking before going on stage in pantomime at Plymouth
on Saturday night, said: ''Larry Grayson was an original. Larry added a
new sense to camp -- always amusing but never offensive.
''Larry was the only one I left in charge of my London club while I
took a rare holiday.
''That was always a super decision.''
Comedian Ken Dodd said: ''Larry was a warm-hearted, friendly man. He
had a marvellous sense of humour.
''He could always see the funny side of life and enjoyed other
people's company.''
Grayson's manager, Mr Paul Vaughan, said: ''Although the precise cause
of death has yet to be established, it is believed to be unrelated to
his recent surgery.''
He added: ''So much love and laughter has gone out of our lives.''
Among the tributes was one from Isla St Clair, his assistant on BBC
television's Generation Game for over three years when audiences reached
18 million.
The pair remained close friends after leaving the show in 1981.
Miss St Clair, who is now married and has two sons, was said to be
deeply shocked by Grayson's death.
She had visited her friend in hospital and was due to see him today
when he had planned to spend the day with her family at their
Northamptonshire home.
Miss St Clair said: ''I am absolutely devastated at the loss of not
only a great professional friend but a very great personal friend.
''I will miss him.''
Mr David Liddiment, head of Light Entertainment at the BBC, said:
''Larry Grayson was a very special performer. He established an intimacy
with his audience, whether playing to 2000 people at the Palladium or 15
million people at home on television. He will be greatly missed.''
Fellow comic Bernard Manning said: ''He was a very private man. There
was no scandal attached to him.
''He was a very funny comic in the Kenneth Williams mould. He had
perfect timing and was always immaculately dressed.''
Mr Grayson, the adopted son of a miner, spent 30 years treading the
boards before finding ''overnight fame''.
He was not impressed by the star lifestyle and returned to his native
Nuneaton to be with his sister, Fran, who had brought him up when his
mother died.
Shrewd investments meant he could retire 10 years ago and he appeared
on stage during rare charity performances.
In November, he appeared on the Royal Variety performance to the
delight of fans.
He joked: ''I am here to prove to you that I am alive.''
He finished with his favourite catchphrase: ''Shut that door.''
Despite his withdrawal from public life, Grayson had a huge number of
friends who stayed loyal to him to the end.
One said: ''He never tried to be anyone else. He was always himself on
and off stage.''
One of his longest standing friends was actress Noele Gordon -- Meg
Mortimer in the long-running TV soap Crossroads. She was devastated when
she died.
The Rev Rob Marshall, an Actor's Church Union chaplain, and a friend
for nearly 20 years, said: ''Larry was a devoted professional who really
loved people.''

Scotland A 18, Italy 16
A SUPPLY of extra fingernails, biting for the use of, might be added
to the supporters' packs of those who follow this nation's A team. A
last-minute dropped goal brought them the famous victory over South
Africa, they hung on to beat France A by three points last season, and
the latest cliff to hang over was found at McDiarmid Park.
With 64 minutes gone, the Scots were tramping through an Italian team
which had all the discipline of Just William and his gang. By the end,
the nerves were strung like piano wire, the tension relieved only by the
sweet sound of the final whistle.
Yet the important fact to record is that this was a victory, the
fourth on the trot for the A side. And that confidence, like heat,
travels upwards.
David Johnston, the successful coach, who has emerged as one of the
more thoughtful of the backroom group, observed, without bombast: ''We
have just beaten a side which is going to the World Cup and which has
spent the last two years travelling together, meeting top-class
opposition. Nor did we play as well as we are capable of doing.''
In truth, Scotland should have had the game locked up as securely as a
bank vault and would have done so if their goalkicking had matched the
rest of their play. There were seven shots at goal missed, eight if you
include the conversion Rowen Shepherd took twice after an early charge.
It would be no surprise if the selectors, for the next A outing
against France at Hughenden on January 20, were to introduce the Exiles'
top scorer Stuart Laing of Instonians, the Belfast lad with a banger of
a boot.
Most of the plus marks, though by no means all, were gained by the
Scottish pack, a real credit to their mentor Hugh Campbell. The Italian
manager Giancarlo Dondi paid tribute to them: ''They had much more
determination and denied us good possession.''
Scotland skinned them at the lineout. Damian Cronin's campaign to
regain his international pace could well have a successful conclusion
this week. He and Stewart Campbell soared above their opponents and Eric
Peters proved a useful ally. There were also notable contributions
elsewhere by Ian Smith and Fergus Wallace as the forwards drove with
vigour.
Skipper Kevin McKenzie made special mention of his props, David Hilton
and Peter Wright, and the scrum was solid. Wright had stitches put in an
eye wound which promptly re-opened -- the referee told him, if he went
off for more attention, that would end his part in the proceedings.
Typically he stayed on.
Among the backs, I rated Bryan Redpath the top performer. His try was
beautifully taken but even more important, on a day when the opposition
lived offside, was his kicking.
Ronnie Eriksson confirmed he is a centre who knows how to cross the
gain line while Craig Joiner, with two try saving tackles on Marcello
Cuttitta, may have booked a date to face the Canadians.
Cammie Glasgow confirmed what a useful player he is to have around,
almost too versatile for his own good.
McKenzie summed up his reaction: ''It was in some ways a harder test
than the South Africans. Italy are difficult to play against, they fan
out across the field, and we had to keep it fairly tight. In the last
quarter we gave away a stupid score but I don't think there was much
doubt about the better side.
''Now the boys are just hoping the postman will call on Wednesday
morning.'' That is when the Scotland team to play Canada will be
announced.
Italy conceded the first of 19 penalties in the fourth minute and full
back Shepherd had no difficulty in opening the account from 25 metres.
The home side had been warned of the boot of Diego Dominguez, but he
missed his first penalty chances before levelling the scores when the
Scots killed it at the ruck.
From the re-start, Scotland roused the crowd with fiery burst. Smith
ripped the ball from Italian mitts, Wallace chipped to the corner. At
the line-out, Cronin soared, transferred the catch to Peters, and the
Bath No.8 crashed through for the try.
Shepherd could not convert that, nor two other penalties but atoned
with a desperately required tackle on Ivan Francescato, the first time
the visitors had shown their pace.
Glasgow was brought on as the kicker -- he came closer but missed
another couple before the interval. The Scots should have been further
ahead.
Italy's Dominguez was no more accurate with two attempts after the
interval. Only one thing for it -- let's have a try.
Cronin was the instigator, skittling Italians as he breenged away.
McKenzie took over, made more ground before Redpath finished it off,
wriggling over like a trout up a stream. Glory be, Glasgow converted and
put over a penalty as Scotland stretched clear.
Off the ropes came the Italians, a kick by Stefano Bonomi making a try
for full back Luigi Troiani which Dominguez converted.
Glasgow hit a post with a penalty, Dominguez put his kick between
them. Again Glasgow was wide and Dominguez was not. There were only
three points in it.
On came Doddie Weir for Wallace who had strained his neck. The line
held.
''There will be folk who will analyse this match and decided what was
done rightly and wrongly,'' declared SRU President Ken Smith. ''All I
care about is that we won. We need wins.''

THE Lord's Day it might have been, but the launch yesterday of
Britain's first official greyhound Sunday meeting will, according to its
owner, prove a saviour to the future financial position of Scotland's
national racetrack.
Edinburgh's Powderhall Stadium has experienced fluctuating fortunes
during its 66-year-history, and when Mr Eddie Ramsay bought the ground
from Corals four years ago, his attempts to make a success of the
venture led him to the realisation that change was required.
As he reported a betting Tote 50% above the #10,000 receipts from the
usual Tuesday evening event -- cancelled to make way for yesterday's
11-race meeting -- Mr Ramsay claimed he was on the right track.
Powderhall, which yesterday admitted more than a thousand enthusiasts
through its turnstiles, is allowed a 20% ''keep'' from the proceeds of
the meeting, which is authorised by the National Greyhound Racing Club
of London.
Last night, however, the Lords Day Observance Society made clear its
opposition to the event -- billed as a family day out -- but admitted
there was little it could do to stop it being repeated.
Mr Ramsay, 47, a former bookmaker and estate agent, said: ''The harsh
economic realities of the market-place have dictated to my colleagues
and myself that a Sunday meeting was inevitable. This is borne out by
today's event attracting double the normal Tuesday night attendance.''
The stadium, which was the venue for professional athletics in its
heyday, also stages greyhound meetings on Thursday and Saturday
evenings, and is the home of Edinburgh Monarchs speedway team.
Mr Archie Hanna, Scottish secretary of the Lords Day Observance
Society, said his organisation was against the concept.
''We are vigorously opposed to any of these events held on the Lord's
Day, but there is nothing we can do about it with legislation occurring
for Sunday horse racing, for example. Under the present climate it is
difficult to reverse something like this,'' he said.
* One other greyhound meeting did take place in Scotland yesterday.
Glasgow's Ashfield stadium staged the unofficial non-rule event known as
a flapping track.

BUSINESSMEN have been advised to use international air services out of
Scotland or risk losing them.
The blunt message came from Mr Vernon Murphy, managing director of
Scottish Airports, who said that he and his team had done everything
possible to put the services in place and now it was up to the customer.
Mr Murphy, who travelled on the inaugural flight yesterday from
Glasgow to Boston by British Airways, said that he was increasingly
concerned about the lack of business traffic using direct services and
choosing instead to interline through London or continental airports.
He said: ''It is not so much a case of use it or lose it, more use it
and get more.''
He disclosed that his company had sent out hundreds of questionnaires
to Scottish businesses asking them what their requirements were and if
they were using other airports and why.
He added: ''We have done our best with the airlines to put the
services in place and this innovation by British Airways is most
welcome. Now, though, it is essential that the services are used and
that they are used by the high-yield business customer.''
BA is to base a Boeing 757 aircraft, named Robert Louis Stevenson, at
Glasgow and use it to serve the five-times-a-week Glasgow/ New York/
Boston service. Around #1m has been spent on refurbishing the plane to
offer a Club and World Traveller service for 161 passengers.
Mr George Cooper, managing director of British Airways Regional, said:
''We are confident that this service can work. We believe that other
airlines have failed on the routes out of Glasgow because they did not
get the cost base right and were not using the right equipment.
''We, however, are putting the low cost but highly efficient aircraft
on the route and think that it will appeal to a wide range of our
customers.''
Mr Cooper said that there would never be any compromise on safety or
service, a veiled response to criticism that crews had been recruited in
a hurry and not properly trained.
Despite industrial relations problems which have led to the suspension
of the Birmingham to New York service, Mr Cooper remains confident that
there will be no such difficulties with the new crews or with shuttle
crews concerned about an erosion of pay and conditions.
Airline sources have indicated that the new Glasgow to Boston service
could lose up to #900,000 in its first year but that the aim of the
airline is to have the service making money within three years.
Mr Cooper added: ''There are tremendous business and leisure
opportunities between Scotland and New England and we believe that this
service will appeal to these customers at both ends of the route.''

THE Prime Minister yesterday declared all-out war on Labour, putting
the focus on the detail of its policies in the start of a campaign
leading to the next General Election.
Mr Major claimed Labour's approach to issues such as devolution, the
health service, and education was ''vindictive and harmful'' and said it
was quite clear that many policies had not been thought through.
He said many were ''silly'' and there still was a ''red underbelly''
to Labour thinking.
Mr Major said in a TV interview he had made a number of New Year
resolutions, but they would not be made public: it is clear, however,
that he has resolved to go for the Labour jugular in key areas of
policy.
On Tory policy, he pulled further away from a referendum on Europe,
and he made no concessions at all to the Euro rebels who have been
denied the party whip, making clear they would have to demonstrate their
loyalty to the Conservative cause in the weeks and months ahead to
justify having the whip restored.
Their first test will come on Wednesday with a vote on the membership
of Commons standing committees, forced by Labour on the grounds that the
Prime Minister technically is running a minority administration.
He said there would be a relentless Tory campaign to expose what he
saw as the true meaning of Labour policies.
He was clear that he would lead the Conservatives into the next
election, which was two to two-and-a-half years away, and he reiterated
the Government's pledge to cut taxes when prudent.
In the interview, with David Frost on BBC TV, Mr Major said there was
little or no possibility of the Inter-Governmental Conference of 1996
bringing forward sweeping changes to strengthen central power in
Brussels.
''I don't believe anything is going to happen in that conference that
would remotely justify a referendum.''
He said he would keep open the option of a referendum only if he were
unable to block some form of change which emerged from the conference.
Mr Major again said that a single currency starting in 1996 or 1997,
as envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty, was now almost inconceivable.
The interview provoked a sharp reaction from Opposition spokesmen.
Labour's deputy leader, Mr John Prescott, said: ''This is a Prime
Minister at bay, division in his party clear in every word on Europe
where the rebels clearly have got him on the run, and deceit about
Labour clear in everything he says about us.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said: ''John Major is making his historic last
stand behind the decaying barricades of the British constitution.''

Scottish Schoolboys 20,
Welsh Schoolboys 18
UNDETERRED by errors which gifted the visitors their two tries, and a
narrow defeat by Australia the previous week, a Scotland side containing
four 16-year-olds gave a spirited display to score a rare victory over a
more mature Welsh side at Goldenacre on Saturday.
Prior to the Scots sealing victory, Welsh No.8 Field had punished
right wing James Craig for risking a quick throw-in after a spell of
good Scots pressure. Field nipped in to intercept before kicking ahead,
then robbed the luckless Craig as he went down on the ball.
Field's try put the Welsh 15-12 ahead midway through the second half
after the Scots led 12-10 at the turn-around, but the Scots fought back.
Scrum-half Black fed flanker Gladstone and replacment prop Hoyle also
got in the act before big lock Andrew Barnes plunged over.
The shrewd Welsh stand-off Lee Jarvis kicked his second penalty to
squeeze his side back in the lead at 18-17, but Heriot's stand-off
Gordon Ross, who took over kicking from Danny Mallinson, made amends for
an earlier miss to clinch victory.
In the first half, Hutcheson's centre Alan Bulloch had charged over
for a try converted by Mallinson, and left-winger Charles Keenan had
punished a Jarvis handling error to touch down.
Young, the Welsh left-winger who later went off to be replaced by
Matthews, replied with a follow-up try from a Roberts hack.

LABOUR will bid to woo leading businessmen this week when it stages a
#500-a-head conference and dinner in Brussels for representatives of
nearly 100 leading companies.
The conference is designed to ''establish close working links and a
constructive dialogue between business and the Labour Party at a
European level,'' said Mr Wayne David, leader of Labour's Euro-MPs.
For their corporate money, the executives of companies like Marks and
Spencer, NatWest Bank, Coca Cola and Hanson will get half a day of talks
in expert groups with European Parliament and Commission officials and a
dinner at which Labour leader Tony Blair will set out his vision of the
party's future in Europe.
Mr David said the topics on tomorrow's agenda would include economic
policy, environment and consumer protection, social affairs, and trade.
''This event will show Labour working in the heart of Europe,'' he
said.
''The positive reaction to the conference indicates that leaders of
industry and commerce recognise that soon they will be doing business
with a Labour government at Westminster.''
As Mr Blair seeks to establish his European credentials, former leader
Neil Kinnock will be establishing his as a new Euro Commissioner.
It is Mr Kinnock's turn tomorrow to be grilled by MEPs who are vetting
all 19 incoming Commissioners before they take up their #130,000-a-year
posts on January 23.
Power to vet the choice of Commissioners was given to the European
Parliament under the Maastricht Treaty and is being used for the first
time following the expiry of Jacques Delors' term of office.
However, MEPs have the power only to throw out the entire team, not
individual members of it, and are considered highly unlikely to take
such drastic action.
They insist the Senate-style hearings are not just window dressing but
a further demonstration of growing democratic power in Europe. Their
vote was needed late last year before Luxembourg's Jacques Santer could
assume the Commission presidency to replace Jacques Delors.
Mr Kinnock is among the last to be questioned. He will face MEPs on
the European Parliament's transport and economic committees at a
two-hour question and answer session in Brussels on his plans and
policies for the next five years as transport commissioner.
But he will not face questions from his wife Glenys, who is MEP for
South Wales East: she is not a member of either committee which Mr
Kinnock must impress. The whole Parliament will vote formally to approve
the new team in Strasbourg on January 18, after considering written
assessments of their qualities.

THE Scottish selectors announce a side on Wednesday which will take on
the Canadians in a fortnight. In some areas there is a plethora of
ability, in others there's a shortage of talent the like of which has
not been seen since the old Westbourne School dances. Ah, but that's a
different story.
There's a straight choice. The selectors either go for a side that is
tried and tested, or they treat the Canada game as another trial match
and experiment with some new faces and combinations. If they experiment
with new faces, and the side is defeated, then they all lose their jobs.
I can therefore exclusively reveal that they will go for the tried and
tested. I think it's the chicken's way, but there you are.
Come on selectors, go for a team for the World Cup.
I'd go this way. Back row first because they are the best players on
the pitch. There are millions of good back row players, and a host of
blends, so lots of unlucky ones. My back row would be Rob Wainwright at
open side, Doddie Weir at No.8 and Eric Peters on the blind side. Three
blokes over six feet five.
The much maligned Doddie strode on to McDairmid Park as sub and
immediately landed a huge cheer and a lineout ball, which is his
strength.
His weakness is picking the ball up at the base, so he'd pack down at
eighth man in defence, but Peters would be there in attack. Weir would
be on the put-in side in attack to use those long legs to channel the
ball across. Peters is lucky to be in the side as he still hasn't set
the heather on fire, and Peter Walton is still to come back from injury.
In the second row, Damian Cronin grandstanded it on Saturday, and he's
lost a stone in weight so that he would be back in. Andy Reed didn't
play, but would be in if fit. That would make a back five of the scrum
all over six-five. Watt and Munro are unlucky.
The front row is a problem. Alan Sharp played for Bristol at the
weekend, and he'd be my choice at loosehead. David Hilton isn't there
yet. Paul Burnell was out the door after the South African game and
that's the way it should stay, so I'd give a return for Mr Nasty
himself, Peter Wright.
He has scrummaging difficulties, and mobility troubles, but he has a
presence, a badness, and a bite that Burnell lacks, but ultimately the
search is on for a tighthead. I'd like John Manson to move across.
Someone would be unhappy at hooker. Martin Scott, Kenny Milne, and
Kevin McKenzie are all possibilities. I'd be hard headed about it all
though, in that Milne brings experience, whereas all of the braver
Scottish performances recently have had McKenzie as the common factor.
With such a big pack of dogs, you can have one ferret. I'd pick
McKenzie. The selectors won't.
To be fair to the packs that have played for Scotland, the poor
displays recently haven't been their problem as things have become
unhinged much further back than that, along with some dire goalkicking.
Scrum half is a blessed exception, with Gary Armstrong, Derrick
Paterson and Bryan Redpath all paying their way, and Andy Nicol now
recuperating. I'd go for Paterson again, despite Redpath's superb
Saturday service.
Stand off? Craig Chalmers was very nearly dropped by the South and
Gregor Townsend is fit again, but still able to give the hardened
watcher of horror films the wobblies, and Duncan Hodge fell apart a bit
on Saturday.
But, again, looking to South Africa, Townsend could be there for that
wee spark. I remember a trial when Cameron Glasgow played himself out of
contention, and he now plays on the wing, but for his goalkicking
expertise alone, he should be encouraged to go back to stand off as he
may never play international rugby on the wing.
Graham Shiel, Ian Jardine, Ronnie Eriksson, Scott Hastings and Tony
Stanger all have claims for a centre berth, and Stanger played on the
wing in November as a one off in theory.
Playing Townsend at stand off requires some bulk out wide, and Ian
Jardine has an elusiveness for which few give him credit, but I'd like
to see Eriksson and Stanger given freedom in the midfield as power
players.
Left wing? Kenny Logan hands down, but on the right? Craig Joiner's
defensive qualities were tested severely by Marcello Cuttitta, but three
times he was up to the task and bundled a very big man into touch.
Joiner's one for the future, so why not now? At full back, the one,
the only, Gavin Hastings. He's had criticism all his career, he's past
his best, but there's no point picking a stop-gap replacement instead of
him. Fair enough if you can see the bloke for the future then pick him
instead, but that person hasn't been identified yet. Rowen Shepherd had
his chance, but it went with five missed kicks.
My team: Hastings; Joiner, Stanger, Eriksson, Logan; Townsend,
Paterson; Sharp, McKenzie, Wright, Cronin, Reed, Peters, Weir,
Wainwright.

Moscow, Sunday
THE Russian Government said today that its troops had blockaded
Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev's palace in the centre of the
separatist region's capital, Grozny.
A Government statement, reported by Itar-Tass news agency, referred to
the palace as the former regional Communist Party headquarters. It said
troops had approached the building ''from two sides and blockaded it
completely. They are now located between 70 and 200 metres from it''.
The statement said troops continued to move against armed fighters
operating in Grozny, and to prevent Dudayev's supporters moving from the
city's outskirts to the centre.
Since the Kremlin launched a tank-led advance on Grozny on December
31, Government statements have periodically spoken of troops moving in
on the palace, but Chechen fighters have maintained control over the
building.
Columns of Russian troops were backed by heavy artillery as they
closed in on the palace, but rebel fighters appeared to be clinging on
to their positions.
Russian television said that the troops, approaching the blackened
palace from the north and south-west, were suffering heavy losses.
Fierce Russian attacks at the bridge over the Sunzha river stopped
reporters three blocks away from the presidential palace, symbol of
resistance to Moscow since Dudayev unilaterally declared independence in
1991.
''Nothing's changed really,'' said Said Umarov, a 20-year-old soldier
leaving the central square in the early afternoon.
''Russian troops are about 800 metres from the palace in a suburb just
north of the centre -- and around the railway station,'' he added.
Itar-Tass quoted Russia's Government press centre as saying Dudayev
had left Grozny two days previously.
No-one at the press centre was available to confirm it had issued the
report of Dudayev's flight. The centre's bulletins have regularly
contradicted both Chechen and independent witnesses reports of events in
Chechnya.
Russia's independent NTV television said earlier that much of the
fighting had centred on Grozny's main market, south of the palace.
It said troops moving from the southern outskirts were within 600
metres of the palace and a group to the north was within 800 metres --
and the palace came under heavy artillery fire.
''A semi-circle is being drawn around the city,'' the television said,
quoting its correspondent in Grozny. ''The Russian command says the
troops have suffered heavy losses.''
The television said Russian troops had tried unsuccessfully to capture
the palace three times during the night, and tanks had taken up
positions in the morning not far from the building. Pictures from the
city showed numerous explosions and buildings ablaze.
Interfax news agency said the Chechens had beaten off a Russian
advance and quoted Chechen commanders as saying more than 10 Russian
tanks had been destroyed.
It also said Chechen fighters had captured a unit of Russian
paratroopers 18 miles southwest of Grozny and Russian commanders were
threatening to bomb the area unless they were released.
Several soldiers reported Russian troops had attacked in force
yesterday from the railway station, about a mile south of the palace.
The attack was repulsed, they said.
Movladi Udugov, head of the Chechen national information service, told
Russian television that Kremlin forces had abandoned the ploy of trying
to take Grozny with tanks and were instead destroying the city block by
block.
In Moscow, a Russian Defence Ministry spokesman confirmed fighting was
continuing.
''Federal troops are holding steady in Grozny and are cleansing the
railway station of Dudayev's gunmen,'' the spokesman told Itar-Tass.
Tass also said Dudayev and his personal guard had left Grozny for the
settlement of Galanchezh. -- Reuter.

Stirling County 26,
Watsonians 25
THE indefatigable spirit of The Bruce lives on. In the lee of
Bannockburn, Stirling County refused to countenance defeat and clawed
back a 13-point deficit to secure a miraculous victory with the last
kick of the game.
Stirling's openside flanker, Brian Ireland, summed up the Bridgehaugh
men's Lazarus-like performance less prosaically: ''Get out of jail for
free,'' said the man they call Icey, in spite of his fiery, all-action
attitude to the game.
This was just the tonic league leaders Stirling needed seven days
before the championship resumes after its mid-winter break, but with
just five minutes remaining at Bridgehaugh on Saturday, Stirling coach
Brian Edwards didn't see it that way at all.
''Honestly, I had given up the ghost. I was getting ready to come in
and give the boys a real roasting. But they showed great spirit to fight
back and win,'' he said.
''We showed real resilience out there today. That's been the
difference between Stirling this season and previous seasons.''
Saturday's friendly paired the league leaders with the second placed
side. Both clubs were understrength, therefore the fixture wasn't as
significant in a form-pointing sense as it might have been.
None the less, Stirling -- who play Hawick at Mansfield Park next
weekend -- must take an enormous psychological boost from the knowledge
that they can stare defeat full in the face and still win. In light of
Stirling's performance, Watsonians' Andy Garry must wonder what he has
to do to be on the winning side.
The centre was incredibly sharp throughout and was rewarded with four
tries which in other circumstances would have made him the toast of the
Myreside clubhouse. Watsonians' other points came from a penalty goal
and a conversion from stand-off Gavin Henderson.
Stirling trailed 7-10 at the interval, Matt McGrandles countering
Garry's brace of tries with a fine solo touchdown, the result of a
40-metre chip and chase breakaway. McKenzie converted.
For virtually all of the second half, Watsonians held the upper hand.
Stirling, trying to run from deep defensive positions, were prone to
handling errors and with an hour played they were 12-20 in arrears,
McGrandles' second try of the afternoon having been more than offset by
Garry's third -- a particularly pleasing, direct-runing effort -- plus a
conversion and penalty goal from Henderson.
The first sign of a Stirling fightback came in 65 minutes when Gordon
Mackay had a try chalked off after a forward pass but, 10 minutes later,
when Garry went over for his fourth try, even the most diehard of County
supporters reckoned the game was a bogey.
It was 12-25 with five minutes to play. Gareth Flockhart began the
counter-offensive with a try which followed spoil-and-pillage work by
Ireland and effective linking by McGrandles. Flockhart converted his own
effort.
That made it 19-25 and, for Stirling, only another goal would do. In
the eightieth minute, it was Flockhart, once again, who provided it.
From a short penalty the Stirling No.8 breenged over for his second try
but it was still 24-25 in Watsonians' favour.
But Mark McKenzie, who hadn't exactly oozed confidence with his
goalkicking, was dead on line.
Next weekend Watsonians must pick themselves up for league duty
against Stewart's-Melville.
For Stirling, a win over Hawick at Mansfield Park is crucial. Brian
Edwards says: ''It's absolutely essential. If we win, then we can
remain, at least four points ahead of our nearest challenger. Then
there's four games to go and we've got two of them at home. If we win on
Saturday then we're in the driving-seat.''
Stirling County -- S Crawford; A Turner, C Sangster, M McGrandles, R
Mailer; M McKenzie, K Harper; J Gibson, G Rutherford, B Robertson, G
Douglas, M Norval, B Ireland, G Flockhart, G Mackay.
Watsonians -- N Pearce; G Ingles, G Jessop, A Garry, P Raeburn; G

NATIONAL school attendance figures to be published for the first time
later this month show that the truancy rate in secondaries last session
was only 1.4%.
The Scottish Office, which is behind publication of the data, had
originally planned to issue school absence rates in November, along with
Standard Grade and Higher results.
The delay has been partly attributed by critics to what has been
described as embarrassment about truancy rates being so low. The
national average for primary schools, where truancy is a marginal
problem, is only 0.2%.
The problem may, however, be understated because a school might be
unable to pin down some cases of truancy condoned by parents.
A drive to combat truancy by a set of measures including publication
of school-by-school data for authorised and unauthorised absence was
begun four years ago by Mr Michael Forsyth, when he was Scottish
Education Minister.
He viewed truancy as a serious problem, particularly when linked to
crime rates among 15-year-olds.
The Scottish Office tables will break down the attendance data for
more than 2400 primaries and secondaries last session into separate
categories. Authorised absence includes illness and study-leave for
external examinations in fourth and fifth years.
The data shows that the total absence rate last session was 6.1% for
primaries and 11.7% in secondaries. In Strathclyde region, which
provides education for half of Scotland's pupils, the secondary absence
rate was 13%.
Local authorities have criticised the raw national data for not taking
into account social factors, and are also concerned about the workload
for teachers compiling the information.
According to the guidelines for next year's published data, schools
will be required to provide even more detailed breakdowns.
But, in the face of local authority opposition, the Scottish Office is
understood to be having second thoughts about these further
requirements.

COLIN Cornwell takes a few short breaths and says he still can't
believe the ''utter madness'' of it all.
His daughter Caren, just 14 years of age, is expected to pay the 94p a
week she earns in interest from her savings account to the Child Support
Agency for the upkeep of her younger sister, Lisa.
Mr Cornwell, who lives with his new wife Cathleen and Caren in
Dalmuir, was shocked to learn that his daughter's savings were being
used in maintenance payment calculations by the CSA.
Technically, Caren must now pay 94p a week towards the upkeep of her
nine-year-old sister Lisa, who lives with her mother in Romford, Essex.
The action has been condemned by the family's local Labour MP, Mr Tony
Worthington, who called it ''gruesome'', and who described Mr Cornwell
as ''a man fully willing to face up to his responsibilities''.
When Mr Cornwell and his wife had a ''clean break'' divorce in July
1992, he moved to Dalmuir and married his new wife and was later joined
by his elder daughter. The Scot, who is a salesman for a food hygiene
supplies company, pays #48.85 a week maintenance for Lisa.
His elder daughter has had the National Savings account since she was
five years old and has used it to save Christmas and birthday presents
given by family and friends. She receives #15 a month pocket money.
At the family's Clydeside home, Mr Cornwell said he would not dream of
asking his daughter for the money.
''I am responsible for my children, but it just shows you the depths
the Government has sunk to when it starts penny pinching on children's
savings,'' he said.
Section 18 of the Child Support Act states that a child's income shall
be treated as that of its parent. This means that children's earning
from paper rounds, Saturday jobs, or pocket money from grandparents can
be taken as that of their parents.
Last night, Mr Alistair Ferrie, campaign co-ordinator of the
Scottish-based Campaign for Fair Maintenance, said cases such as Caren's
would continue because of the nature of the Act.
At his constituency home last night, Mr Worthington said Mr Cornwell
had been hounded by the CSA, which had made gruesome accusations that he
dipped into his children's savings.

<HEADLINE>Parkhurst officer spots the three inmates walking along road Escaped prisoners caught on island</HEADLINE>

THE three dangerous prisoners who escaped from Parkhurst were captured
by police on the Isle of Wight last night thanks to an alert prison
officer.
Keith Rose, 45, and Andrew Rodger 44, were cornered by police less
than a mile from the Cowes ferry terminal.
The third man, Matthew Williams, 25, initially avoided capture but was
caught by a policeman and his dog 90 minutes later after a chase.
Rose and Rodger told police that Williams was armed with a home-made
pistol and 12 rounds of ammunition, but police said he was unarmed when
captured.
The three men had been spotted by off-duty prison officer Colin Jones,
28, at 7.20pm as he was was driving with his wife along Lushington Hill
towards East Cowes.
Mr Jones, who works on the same wing from which the three men escaped,
saw them walking in a line on the road and particularly recognised the
walk of Williams.
He dialled 999 and kept them under observation until a police van
carrying four special constables and three regular officers arrived.
Rose and Rodger, both killers, were arrested within 10 minutes and 150
officers, dogs and a spotter plane were brought in to search for
Williams.
The three men, all serving life sentences, escaped on Tuesday night.
They used a home-made metal ladder to scale the 25ft wall of the
top-security jail. It was later revealed they had a copy of a master key
which they used to get into vital areas of the jail.
Prison officers later claimed that Governor John Marriott had been
warned about the master key two days before the break-out.
A police spokesman told how officers were on the scene within minutes
after being alerted by the prison officer.
They chased the fugitives, and Rodger and Rose were soon captured. He
said they had lost heart and gave up after running just a short distance
across a field.
''They seemed to have given up hope completely, and could not be
bothered to put up a fight. They looked terrible. They were dirty and
really dishevelled and looked as though they'd been sleeping rough since
their escape.
''Rodger and Rose looked really dejected. They didn't have any
strength left in them, but Williams looked much fitter. He was desperate
to get away and sprinted off across the fields, and disappeared into the
darkness.''
He said Rodger and Rose told police that Williams had a pistol and was
carrying live ammunition, and more armed officers were called in.
After Williams ran off a tracker dog picked up his scent and then lost
it. A second dog then picked up the scent and he was tracked into the
Island Harbour marina.
He was found in the water and dog-handler PC Tony Woolcock, 41, with
his dog Bonzo, jumped into six feet of water to arrest him.
The officer said he did not know if Williams was armed and said: ''I
didn't think about it at all. I was just wet.''
Williams was placed against the bank, handcuffed, and pulled out of
the water.
Williams's offences included bomb making, arson, stealing poison, and
possessing gunpowder.
The waterside area had been sealed off and police flooded the area as
the spotter plane, using a thermal image heat-seeking camera, swooped
low over the area.
Special Constable Pierre Lornlouer, who works in catering, chased
after Williams when he ran off. He said he did not consider if the
prisoner might react violently, even though Williams swore at him as he
fled.
At one stage he grabbed Williams's jacket but he escaped through a
hedge into a field. At another point he flagged down a car and asked the
driver to give him a lift so that he could keep up with the fleeing
convict.
PC Jim Hawkins, with his dog, helped track Williams to the marina near
East Cowes. He saw a person walking on the pontoon, challenged him, and
told him to stand still.
At first he thought he might be a police officer but he continued
walking. He chased him and he ''walked straight into the water'', and PC
Woolcock jumped into the water after him with his dog.
Special Constable Mike Carr, 54, a schoolteacher at Carisbrooke High
School on the island, said he had arrested Rodger. He asked him if he
had any identification and when the prisoner said no he asked if he
could come back to the van and the prisoner went without making any
comment.
Ms Kelly Barker came face to face with police as they set up
roadblocks on the remote Whippingham-East Cowes road.
The 19-year-old barmaid from the Folly Inn at Whippingham said: ''It
was terrifying. I was driving into work when dozens of police appeared
from nowhere. Five vans full of officers raced past me and pulled up
suddenly in front.
''The police jumped out of the vans and started searching the woods
and fields.''
She went on: ''The pub is surrounded by countryside and open fields
run down to the river. There are lots of boats kept down there, and in
the summer it's busy but in the winter it would be the perfect place to
hide.'
Local farmer Trevor Thomas told how police informed him they had
caught Williams.
Mr Thomas lives alone at Binfield Farm, Whippingham, and after police
captured the first two fugitives they visited him and told him to lock
all his doors.
Mr Thomas was revisited by police moments after the capture of
Williams. ''They told me he had been caught down in the boatyard on the
River Medina and that it was safe to go out now.''
Mr Thomas said he was surprised the three had been found on the
island.
