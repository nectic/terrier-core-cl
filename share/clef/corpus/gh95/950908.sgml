LIZ McColgan yesterday revealed the identity of the coach who has
helped relaunch her athletics career -- Norwegian marathon specialist
Grete Waitz. ''I will be sitting down with Grete for a long talk in the
next few days to decide on next year's programme, whether to do the
marathon or the 10,000 metres at the Olympics,'' said McColgan.
The pair have been in partnership since May. ''She sends schedules by
fax and we are on the phone at least every other day, often every day,''
adds Liz.
Waitz can claim to be the women's greatest endurance runner ever --
two world records at 3000m and four at the marathon, unbeaten at
cross-country for 12 years, including five world titles, and 13 wins in
18 marathons, including a world title and nine wins in New York.
Now she is putting all that expertise at McColgan's disposal, helping
revive the Scot's form. The Norwegian asked for her role to be kept
secret initially, only agreeing to come out of the closet now, following
McColgan's sixth place in the world 10,000m in Gothenburg, and her
subsequent series of races.
The new partnership will come under intense scrutiny in the next few
weeks as McColgan faces two of her biggest rivals in events half a world
apart, races in which times, rather than places, will indicate the
continued strength or otherwise of McColgan's revival, on which, as she
admitted yesterday, the jury is still out.
A week on Sunday, McColgan meets her Scottish rival, Yvonne Murray, in
the BUPA Great North Run. Then, on November 17, she faces another old
adversary, Australian Lisa Ondieki, in the Tokyo Marathon.
Waitz and McColgan teamed up after meeting as neighbours in Florida
and sharing the same physiotherapist. ''Grete was late for an
appointment, I was early and we got chatting,'' said Liz. ''Grete said
she always felt I was the same type of runner as her. She saw me
following the same methods and making the same mistakes that she had
done. I am very open with her and we get on great.''
McColgan considers this season as a stepping stone to recovery. ''The
World championships came too soon for me,'' she said. ''I had to race
while I was still trying to train. Under the circumstances, it wasn't
too bad, but I am in better shape than my performances might suggest.''
The half marathon from Newcastle to South Shields will be McColgan's
first road meeting against Murray since two years past May, a too-close
5000m encounter in Aberdeen which ended in an acrimonious exchange. But
McColgan dismisses talk of a fall-out, both with Murray and double
Commonwealth marathon champion Ondieki, who beat McColgan in their last
marathon meeting, in London.
''Every time we race there is this hype,'' said McColgan. ''We are all
highly motivated, competitive runners, but there is nothing between us.
Yvonne and I were on the bus together after the grand prix in Brussells
the other day, both of us limping with sore backs as we got on. We were
laughing at one another and chatting away. It's daft to suggest we're
enemies.''
Ondieki, meanwhile, has withdrawn from next weekend's Newcastle race,
preferring to remain training at altitude in Arizona in preparation for
Tokyo.
Murray, who will be making her half marathon debut on Tyneside, will
use the event to test the water for future marathon plans. ''But that
will not be until after the Atlanta Olympics,'' she says.
* THE late arrival of two Columbian athletes, brings to 25 the number
of nations competing in the World Mountain Racing Trophy in Edinburgh
this weekend.

THE cause of all our national neuroses, judging from much of the
opinion on your pages these last two weeks, is a thing called Calvinism.
You would do your readers a great service if you were to enlighten us as
to what exactly is this sinister phenomenon that threatens the very soul
of our nation.
I suggest you give this important assignment to the greatest asset you

CANADIAN OPEN
Sandy Lyle drove the ball poorly to slip eight strokes from the lead
after the opening round here yesterday.
''I had about eight snap hooks. I drove the ball exceptionally bad,''
said Lyle, who shot two-over-par 74 in breezy morning conditions on the
demanding Glen Abbey course.
Left-handed American Russ Cochran, playing in even tougher afternoon
weather, shot a flawless six-under 66 to lead by one stroke from Kiwi
Grant Waite.
Lyle was hoping to build on the good form he displayed to finish equal
sixth at last week's European Masters, but it wasn't to be as he mixed
four birdies with four bogeys and a double-bogey in a rollercoaster
performance.
''I practised too long on Wednesday. My hands got a bit sore. I've
lost all my timing and feel.''
Cochran, meanwhile, has never enjoyed any success at Glen Abbey, where
he has missed the cut in his three previous appearances.
His performance yesterday was made even more surprising given that he
is slowly playing his way back to form after missing 10 successive
tournaments due to a herniated neck disk earlier in the year. Leading
scores (US unless stated):
66 -- Russ Cochran.
67 -- Grant Waite (New Zealand).
68 -- Bob Lohr, Mark Brooks, Andrew Magee, Gary Hallberg, Bill
Glasson, J P Hayes.
69 -- Dennis Paulson, Bobby Wadkins, David Ogrin, Hal Sutton, Jim
Gallagher, Steve Lowery, Bob Tway, Dan Forsman.
Other scores included: 71 -- David Feherty (N Ireland), Fred Couples.
72 -- Nick Price (Zimbabwe). 74 -- Sandy Lyle (Scotland), Mark
Calcavecchia, Curtis Strange.

GORDON Sherry, the Amateur champion, firmly declared his sense of
priorities yesterday as preparations for the thirty-fifth Walker Cup
match continued at Royal Porthcawl. He said: ''It's not all about me
playing Tiger Woods (his opposite number), it's about Britain and
Ireland against the United States.
''I wouldn't mind playing Tiger four times and losing all four as long
as the team won,'' the Barassie golfer added. ''And it would be no good
if I beat him four times and the team lost. In 10 years no-one will
remember individual performances, only which side won.''
As irony would have it Woods, who two weeks ago achieved the rare
distinction of retaining the US Amateur title, would have had difficulty
answering the starter's call to play anyone. As his captain, Downing
Gray, delicately put it, Woods spent most of the early hours of Thursday
''undoing his dinner.''
Woods, notoriously addicted to hamburgers and french fries, on
Wednesday evening attended an innovative gathering -- suggested by the
Royal &amp; Ancient Club's secretary, Michael Bonallack -- at which both
teams and their captains were mixed around three dinner tables. Pate,
haddock, lamb, and ''a modicum of wine and lager'' apparently did for
him.
Woods yesterday remained in his hotel room as his team-mates practised
in mild but wet and breezy conditions. A full recovery is expected by
the player whose prodigious hitting reduced the seventeenth, 511 yards
all up hill, to an albatross 2 with no more than a wedge second shot.
Gray said: ''I've seen nothing like him at 19 -- and that includes
Nicklaus.''
Sherry, who reiterated that after he has played in the US Masters and
completed his degree next spring he would, for obvious reasons, not
defend his title at Turnberry, endorsed the view of his captain, Clive
Brown, that the combined side was ''playing well, in excellent spirits,
and looking forward to the weekend.''
There was almost a crusading tone in Sherry's voice when he continued:
''This is the pinnacle of amateur golf. I'm not content just to be in
the team, I want to win the match. It's the most important event that
will have happened to me this season.''
Brown believes the selectors have picked the 10 best golfers in these
islands, a balance of youth and experience that has been a natural
by-product of the process. The later date of the match has allowed the
team to emerge, although in the end only Palacerigg's Graham Rankin
broke through from outwith the original training squad.
Three training sessions at the links over the past 12 months with
Ryder Cup captain Bernard Gallacher as spiritual, rather than technical,
advisor must make this British team the best prepared of all. But, as
they always do, the Americans have worked hard to adjust to alien
conditions and the course's nuances. They, too, will be ready.

LANCOME TROPHY
COLIN Montgomerie shot a six-under-par 64 in the first round of the
Lancome Trophy in Paris yesterday to lead fellow Scot Sam Torrance by
one stroke in difficult conditions. Despite constant showers and
blustery conditions, six of Europe's nine Ryder Cup men on view,
Montgomerie, Torrance (65), Seve Ballesteros (67), Bernhard Langer (70),
David Gilford (70) and Costantino Rocca (70) shot par or better.
The remaining three, Jose Maria Olazabal (71), Howard Clark (72) and
Mark James (73), were not disgraced.
It was a formidable answer to recent charges that the European team is
a combination of players, carrying injuries, having little confidence or
possessing poor cup records.
Even Montgomerie, leading the Order of Merit and recently beaten only
in a play-off at the US PGA Championship, has been having putting
problems, but he put all that behind him with a brilliant performance
yesterday.
Out in 31 and back in 33, the burly Scot, who has relaxed his grip
when putting with outstanding results, had only 28 putts in a round that
included eagle 3s at both the eighth and sixteenth holes.
''In Germany two weeks ago I gave my putting three out of 10 and won
the tournament. In Switzerland last week it was not much better. But
today, well you can't shoot 64 without putting well.''
Asked whether he thought he was the best player in the world on
current form, Montgomerie replied: ''Greg Norman is playing better than
I am at the moment and I am second. Possibly I am as good as anybody
tee-to-green, but I feel Greg is ahead of me.''
Montgomerie and Torrance were neck-and-neck all the way round.
Torrance, who is currently lying second to Montgomerie in the European
money list, had six birdies and only one bogey in his round and said:
''It was a pleasure to play with Monty. I didn't have to keep looking at
the leaderboards to see how he was doing.''
Ballesteros, who has been playing very badly in recent weeks, came
back to form with a superb 67, though he played down his round by
saying: ''It was a bit better. One day you feel you are the best in the
world and the next day you feel you are nothing.''
Olazabal, who will make a decision on whether to drop out of the Ryder
Cup team because of his foot problem at the end of this tournament, was
one under par with two holes to play but finished with two bogeys.
''That hurt more than my foot,'' he said later. ''I missed 12-foot
putts at each of the last five holes.''
Ian Woosnam, hoping to take Olazabal's place if he drops out of the
team, went round in the worst of the conditions in 69, one under par,
and was clearly happy with his game.
He began with two successive bogeys but bounced back with four birdies
and only one other bogey in his round.
While Europe's Ryder Cup men were doing well, Tom Lehman struck a blow
for the American team when he went round in 67. He was one over par
after 10 holes, but had three birdies and an eagle in his last eight
holes. Leading scores:
64 -- C Montgomerie.
65 -- S Torrance.
66 -- M Campbell (New Zealand), O Rojahn (Norway).
67 -- T Lehman (USA), V Fernandez (Argentina), S Ballesteros (Spain).
68 -- P Affleck, W Riley (Australia).
69 -- I Pyman, D Carter, D J Russell, J Townsend (USA), A Cejka
(Germany), P Broadhurst, I Woosnam.
70 -- D Cooper, P Baker, C Mason, B Langer (Germany), D Gilford, G
Orr, M McLean, S Richardson, M Davis, D Clarke, V Singh (Fiji), C Rocca
(Italy), J Van de Velde (France).
71 -- F Lindgren (Sweden), J Sandelin (Sweden), P McGinley, G Brand
Jr, P Eales, J-M Canizares (Spain), D Martin (USA), M-A Jimenez (Spain),
R Davis (Australia), P Linhart (Spain), M Lanner (Sweden), S Ames
(Trinidad), J Coceres (Argentina), I Garrido (Spain), R Karlsson
(Sweden), J M Olazabal (Spain), E Romero (Argentina).
72 -- H Clark, R Boxall, P Hedblom (Sweden), A Oldcorn, R Wessels (S
Africa), A Bossert (Switzerland), M Gronberg (Sweden), M Jonzon
(Sweden), J Spence, B Lane, R Claydon.
Other scores included:
73 -- A Coltart, M James. 75 -- D Robertson. 77 -- R Rafferty. 87 -- A
Hunter.
* WITH only one dropped shot, at the unlucky thirteenth hole, Russell
Weir set a new course record of 65, six under par, at the Crow Wood
Pro-Am yesterday. He finished three strokes ahead of Ian Collins thanks
to seven birdies. Leading scores:
65 -- R Weir (Cowal). 68 -- I Collins (Stirling). 69 -- C Elliott
(Dubai Creek), S Callan (Dalmahoy), K Walker (Kings Links), C Maltman
(Eyemouth), S Kerr (Renfrew). 70 -- C Jones (Glencorse), P Smith
(Deeside), C Everett (Caldwell), K Hutton (Downfield).
Team: K McKechnie (unattached), S Sung, A Chung, C Lau (Orchid Lane).

FALKIRK fans have been asked not to give former manager Jim Jefferies
a hard time at Tynecastle tomorrow. And the amazing request has come
from their own supporters' association.
The clash with Hearts is the first time the two teams will have met
since Jefferies' U-turn saw him head for Gorgie Road after having said
he was staying at Brockville.
Initially, it led to talk of a possible boycott of the fixture by
Falkirk fans, but now they have been asked to go and back their team --
and give Jefferies and assistant Billy Brown a cheer or two into the
bargain.
''We are recommending the fans go to the game and support Falkirk,''
said association chairman Alex Hastings, who met Jefferies at Tynecastle
yesterday. ''If possible, we would also like the fans to salute Jim
Jefferies and Billy Brown who gave us five good years at Brockville.''
Hearts defeated city rivals Hibs in a reserve game yesterday when
goals from John Paul Burns, David Murie, Scott Leitch and Willie
Jamieson gave the Jambos a 4-0 win.

PETE Sampras ended the longshot run of Zimbabwean Byron Black with a
straight-sets victory yesterday that put the No.2 seed into the
semi-final stage of the US Open at Flushing Meadow.
Sampras, improving as the match progressed, overpowered the
No.70-ranked Black 7-6, 6-4, 6-0 on the Stadium Court.
The 24-year-old Sampras, a two-time Open champion, neutralised Black's
usually impressive return of serve with a scintillating display of
service power that left his opponent without an answer.
''He really blew me off the court,'' said Black, who had upset No.8
seed Michael Stich and ninth-seeded Thomas Enquist on the way to the
quarter-finals. ''I didn't have a weapon that could hurt him. It's a bit
of a downer.''
Sampras, who slammed down 22 aces against only four double faults,
needed just 21 minutes to win the third set and finish off the victory.
The win moved Sampras into tomorrow's semi-finals against the winner
of the match between Americans Michael Chang, the fifth seed, and No.14
seed Jim Courier.
Defending champion Andre Agassi and Boris Becker, who waged a
memorable battle in this year's Wimbledon semi-finals, will meet up in
the other men's semi.
Meanwhile, Meredith McGrath and Matt Lucena, who had never played
together, became the first all American team to win the mixed doubles
title since 1989.
The unseeded team upset the No.3 seeds Gigi Fernandez and Cyril Suk
6-4, 6-4, sharing the $50,000 first prize.
''We just decided in the first match we were going to go out there and
have fun,'' Lucena said. He and McGrath were originally scheduled to
play with other partners who failed to materialise. ''So we were stuck
with each other,'' McGrath said.
The last American team to win the US Open mixed title was Robin White
and Shelby Cannon, who defeated McGrath and her partner, Rick Leach, in
the final.
In the women's doubles competition, the No.6 seeds, Brenda
Schultz-McCarthy and Rennae Stubbs had a straight-sets success against
Jill Hetherington and Kristine Radford, winning 6-4, 7-6 (8-6).
The final the tennis world wants to see tomorrow is just a step away,
with Monica Seles and Steffi Graf facing one last obstacle to a dream
encounter.
Seles today meets 1994 Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez, while
Graf lines up in her semi-final against Gabriela Sabatini.
* BRITAIN'S Martin Lee reached the quarter-final stage of the US Open
boys singles when he beat Yaoki Ishii, of Japan, 6-4, 6-0. But his
doubles partner James Trotman, of Ipswich, went out against Argentinian
Mariano Zabaleta, beaten 6-1, 6-4.

BRITAIN'S Lisa Hackney finished in a four-way tie for the lead with a
three-under-par 70 after torrential rain halted play for two hours in
the opening round of the Trygg Hansa Open at Haninge, near Stockholm,
yesterday, writes Bill Johnson.
Defending champion Lotta Neumann and Helen Alfredsson were in a
foursome alongside Hackney and US Open champion Annika Sorenstam on 71.
Gillian Stewart was the leading Scot on 73, level par, finishing just
before darkness closed in leaving three players to play the last hole
and complete their rounds this morning.
Hackney won the Indonesia Open and topped the Asian merit table
earlier this year, but last week failed to get through the preliminary
test for a place at the LPGA qualifying school.
''I realised that if I failed to get through that stage I would not
earn a living on the Tour and I now plan to concentrate on Europe next
year,'' she explained.
Leading scores (British and Irish unless otherwise stated. * denotes
amateur):
70 -- S Norberg (Sweden), H Alfredsson (Sweden), L Neumann (Sweden), L
Hackney.
71 -- L Fairclough, A Sorenstam (Sweden), *A Berg (Sweden), E Engstrom
(Sweden), C Sorenstam (Sweden).
72 -- M Hageman (Holland), S Yamamoto (Japan), L Brooky (New Zealand),
S Gustafson (Sweden).
Scottish scores: 73 -- G Stewart. 76 -- M McKinlay, J Forbes. 77 -- L
Irvine. 80 -- C Panton-Lewis.
* TORRENTIAL rain delayed the final round of the PGA European Tour
Regional Qualifying School at Slaley Hall yesterday with 27 players
still to complete their rounds, including overnight leader David Scott,
the professional at Letham Grange.
Of the Scots who completed their rounds only Powfoot amateur Craig
Hislop has an outside chance of qualifying, having finished the day with
a two-under-par 70 for a three-round aggregate of 220. Selected Scottish

ITALIAN GRAND PRIX
DAMON Hill yesterday told world champion Michael Schumacher to clean
up his act for the sake of the sport as the fierce rivals prepared to
renew their struggle for the drivers' championship.
Hill wants a fair fight over the season's remaining races as he
attempts to overturn Schumacher's 15-point lead in the chase for the
crown.
But Schumacher goes into Sunday's Italian Grand Prix with a one-race
ban -- suspended for four races -- hanging over his head following his
controversial actions while winning the last encounter between the
drivers in Belgium.
''We don't want to see the championship end in the way some of the
them used to end between Alain (Prost) and Ayrton (Senna),'' said Hill.
''Or even between Michael and me last year.
''In a way, it would be good if the suspended ban had been for six
races so we can ensure a clean fight between now and the end of the
season, but I will have to make do with the four.
''But at least the onus will be on him to clean up his act a bit,''
added Hill, who believes the threat of a ban should force Schumacher to
be more circumspect.
''I can't say what he will do, but I hope for the sake of race fans
and viewers of the sport that we have really close, but clean, racing
and we both end up going over the line in one piece.''
Hill said he had no plans to speak to Schumacher about the Spa
incidents, but revealed they had discussed it during a Renault promotion
in Barcelona last week.
''It was charged,'' said Hill of their meeting. ''But it never came to
anything because we had to get on with the promotion. We discussed it,
but of course we are going to differ on that subject.
''But we had to perform a stunt in a stadium in our racing cars, and I
did remind him that he was still under a suspended ban.
''He feels he has not transgressed in any way, but the rules are quite
clear.
''I can point out three actual clear transgressions of the rules in
what he did at Spa.''
Hill again criticised Schumacher for changing lines more times than
permitted, crowding at a corner, and using his Benetton to bang into the
Williams at low speed as the duo fought an enthralling race in the rain.
Schumacher resolutely defended his actions, but his team decided last
week not to go ahead with their appeal because of the threat that the
ban could be invoked.

WHILE there were dark suggestions from some quarters yesterday that
Scotland could yet face a play-off before reaching the European
Championship finals, that seems unlikely.
If Scotland defeat San Marino -- and even the most pessimistic member
of the Tartan Army cannot envisage anything other than that -- then we
would be one of the better second-place qualifiers.
And it is only the two nations who have the worst record in the
current groups who will be asked to play an additional game to ensure
that they take their place in the last 16.
There will be four groups, expanding the tournament to 16 countries
for the first time, and the top two teams from each one will go through
to the quarter finals.
There are eight venues, Anfield, St James' Park, Elland Road, Old
Trafford, Hillsborough, Villa Park, the City Ground in Nottingham, and
Wembley.
There has been no decision made regarding where the various qualifying
countries will be placed, but there is a strong lobby now which suggests
that the Scots will be based in Newcastle for two games and in Leeds for
another.
The reasoning is that it will allow the fans to make day trips to
watch the matches.
Initially, FIFA laid down rules to cover ticket allocations for each
country. The specified amount was 7000, but, in Scotland's case because
of their proximity, that could be increased, particularly as several
East European nations look likely to make it, and none of them will
bring a large travelling support. The matches will kick off on June 8,
and the Wembley final will be on June 30.

' We have been kicking a ball for long enough and we weren't always so
far behind the rest of the world '
JUKKA Ikalainen, Finland's straight-talking national team-manager,
captured the reality of Scottish football perfectly. There is, he said
after Scotland had just beaten his team at Hampden the other night, ''no
fantasy'' in our play and it is this lack of imagination which will
cause us serious problems in the European Championship finals in England
next summer.
The Scots have still to play San Marino in the final match of Group 8
on Wednesday, November 15, but the result might be academic by then
because Greece play in Russia next month, and if they fail to win,
Scotland's 20 points would be enough to give them second place in the
section.
The eight group winners qualify automatically, with the six
second-placed sides with the greatest number of points also going
through, and the 20 points Scotland have gathered should be sufficient.
However, that is assuming Craig Brown's team lose to San Marino, and we
all know that isn't going to happen even if our own deficiencies again
were laid across Hampden's wide expanse.
Unless Brown can unearth some gems between now and the start of the
finals, the Scots, on their return to English soil, could find
themselves exposed and no more than bit-part players.
The manager can do little to improve the quality of the players given
to him by clubs from which he draws his resources, yet he has managed to
make them hard to beat, which is why they will be playing in the finals.
However, even though Brown and others continue to peddle that tiresome
excuse that such a small nation shouldn't expect anything more, the rest
of us don't have to accept it.
We are entitled to expect better performances and also players with
greater skills because we have been kicking a ball for long enough and
we weren't always so far behind the rest of the world. Scotland simply
became negligent and took flair and talent for granted instead of
working to make sure standards could be maintained.
Scotland's time in the finals will probably be tense and unrewarding,
just as in the past, and all we can do is support the cause and hope for
a break here and there. If we don't take ourselves too seriously we
might also be able to enjoy and appreciate the real thing, as it will be
played by other countries in England, who themselves, have just been
given a sharp reminder that others are playing a different game.
The English, who have an infuriatingly high regard for their football,
had to settle for a goal-less draw against Colombia on Wednesday night,
when Terry Venables must have realised even the players at his command
have a long way to go before they can control and play the ball with the
panache of the South Americans.
Even Paul Gascoigne, who by all accounts enjoyed his best match for
some time, was impressed: ''We learnt a bit tonight about keeping the
ball,'' he said, ''but you need an end product as well.''
Well, of course, that's correct, Paul, but a team is in even worse
shape when it not only lacks a finishing touch but also a capability to
retain possession for long periods (All right, hands up all those who
said: ''Sounds just like Scotland?'')
The Colombians were always comfortable on the ball, even when moving
at high speeds, and like all teams with a natural feel for the ball,
they make the game look easy. It is a treat to watch such performers,
individualists who also can play to team plans. They also seem to accept
that they have a responsibility to entertain and excite.
Carlos Valderamma, who can never be mistaken because of his wooly
hairstyle and sublime skills, continues to influence them greatly, but
their keeper, Rene Higuita, is the most eccentric of all their players.
During the match at Wembley he dealt with a Jamie Redknapp shot by
diving under the ball, flipping both feet up behind him, and clearing
the ball from under his bar.
A linesman was flagging for offside, but Higuita had already decided
to perform for, and astound, the crowd.
It is there next summer we will witness the best Europe has to offer,
and our own managers and coaches can look and learn. Also, those who
decry the SFA's community officer scheme should bear in mind that only
by encouraging youngsters to play again in numbers will we find the
talents among us, and maybe a generation or two down the line the
managers of Scotland's opponents will be praising the flair in our game.
It might never be fantasy football, but at least we can try. Next
summer's finals will remind us how much work we have to do.

GRANGE'S league triumph last season has not only given them entry into
the European club championship but also has made the club an attraction
for aspiring young players.
David Steven, a speedy winger, is one of four players to move to
Raeburn Place. The remaining trio include some of the best young talent
in the land, for Graham Dunlop and Mike Leonard are members of the
Scottish Under-21 side, while 18-year-old Mark Raphael comes from the
crack Irish side, Lisnagarvey, with the reputation of being the finest
young prospect to emerge from the country since the Terry Gregg.
This quartet will more than compensate Grange for the retirement of
former internationalists David Leiper and Donny Hay. So much so Grange's
new captain, Shaun Middleton, feels the team will have an ''even better
balance than last season.''
That viewpoint will be put to the test this weekend in Dublin, where
Grange will be rubbing shoulders with some of the best club sides in
these islands when they contest the Budweiser tournament.
Havant, East Grimstead, Three Rock Rovers, Bambridge, and new Irish
champions, Pembrooke Wanderers, will be among their rivals for the top
prize.
Grange's main challengers for the title this coming season will also
be putting the final touches to their preparations for the start of the
new campaign tomorrow week, on home soil.
MIM will sharpen their teeth against Inverleith and Dunfermline
Carnegie, while Kelburn and Western, with their new recruits Kevin
Squire and Richard Forsyth, will be the guests of Clydesdale in the
programme software tournament at Millerston.
In the women's equivalent at Barlia, Western Klick Photopoint,
national champions for the past 13 years, will take on English sides
Sunderland and Bradford along with the Ulster club, Ards.

THE French Government has been caught off balance by the international
reaction to its round of nuclear tests in the South Pacific. The extent
of the hostility, even the degree of opposition within France itself, is
new. It ought to cause a major reconsideration of the rest of the
programme -- it already seems to have evoked some minor modifications at
least in President Chirac's mind. There is, however, always the
possibility that the French Government will more deeply entrench its
commitment to the tests, interpreting any concession as an admission of
defeat, involving the loss of face. This may be all the more likely when
the insistence on having the tests at all seems to have been more a
matter of political calculation, demonstrating France's independent
nuclear status, rather than a scientific or military necessity. It
cannot be emphasised too strongly that these particular tests are
unnecessary, though abandoning them would leave the French dependent,
like ourselves, on American computer-derived simulations of roughly
similar tests. Better such dependence, it must seem to many, than the
political fall-out which has already been manifest, quite apart from
worries about environmental issues themselves.
The French Government, and its apologists, have been apt to disclaim
any risks, but an element of risk is always associated with nuclear
weaponry: it certainly always exists in the popular imagination,
something which, in democracies at any rate, cannot simply be dismissed.
That is why the testing ground is located where it is, rather than in
France. And that is why so many countries on the Pacific rim, from Japan
to Chile, as well as more obviously neighbours, like Australia and New
Zealand, have been so upset. It is their environment which is being
compromised by a foreign power. That French constitutional habit tended
to make colonies and protectorates part of France itself may have
created an element of self-deception in French minds, in spite of their
African and south-east Asian experiences in the 1950s and sixties. If
so, they should have been disabused by the violence of the popular
reaction in Tahiti this week. Its savagery is in contradistinction to
the Polynesian image of serenity which Europeans have cherished since
the eighteenth century (with varying degrees of error), and it is bound
to have longer-term consequences for the nature of French rule in the
region, if not even for the French governing presence itself, which
looks more than ever an anachronism.
Of course, the violence was the work of a minority -- it always is --
but the French will not find that that means there is a silent majority
willing to lend its support. Seldom has France been so isolated -- even
the British Government's support is expressed by its refusal to condemn:
the nearer opinion is found to the test site, however, the more vocal,
and even eloquent, its expression of condemnation. Nuclear testing may
proceed in the US, Russia, and China all of which have vast ''empty
quarters'' but the last of these is a dictatorship, the second is still
experimenting with democracy but seems to have abandoned nuclear tests,
and the first, the pioneering atomic power, has grown up with the
practice over half a century, and still has an undeveloped anti-nuclear
movement possibly as a result. France does not have any significant area
of uninhabited expanse similar to Nevada or the Chinese and Russian test
areas, but it is a large country and possibly could create a test area,
by minimal movement in the sparsely populated Masif Centrale. Domestic
public opinion would find that entirely unacceptable. What this week has
shown is that Polynesian opinion is no different, only under imperial
rule.

SCOTLAND striker Scott Booth yesterday put club before country on his
hit list. While Scotland coach, Craig Brown, outlined a key role in Euro
'96 for the Don, who has scored four goals in eight games, Booth set his
sights on success with Aberdeen.
The 23-year-old said: ''I am delighted things have gone so well with
Scotland. It was important that we qualified for the finals. Our game
needs to be back on such a stage.''
Now he aims to carry on his scoring streak into Sunday's televised
spectacular against Celtic at Pittodrie. ''Everyone at Aberdeen is
desperate to go all the way in one of the domestic competitions. We all
believe there is an excellent chance of achieving this.
''Now we have a a much more positive style which creates more chances
for the strikers. We are a strong team once again.I am still not as
sharp as I want to be, but this will happen eventually.
Scotland team-mate Duncan Shearer, who missed the tie against Finland
because of a knee injury, played against Raith Rovers reserves yesterday
and could come back on Sunday.

Russia are one of the favourites to win the European title. Yet they
have not been able to beat us
SCOTLAND team manager Craig Brown shrugged off the criticism which has
followed him and his team throughout their European Championship
qualifying campaign, and insisted that his players would reach the
second stage of the finals in England.
No other Scottish team gone further than the opening round of games in
any major tournament, but Brown believes that this squad -- no matter
how unfancied -- are capable of achieving that.
Yesterday at Hampden, less than 24 hours after the victory over
Finland, Brown was looking towards the finals, unfazed by any
suggestions that his country had not yet qualified.
That nightmare scenario -- Greece winning in Russia and Scotland
losing at home to San Marino -- was not considered by the man who has
guided his group of players to the finals next summer.
When he looked towards the games which may lie ahead, Brown remained
confident that the men who have surprised Europe already will continue
to surprise their critics on the bigger stage.
It does not matter now that the Greek and Finnish managers had sour
grapes' comments to hurl at the team which has beaten them to the #2m
jackpot which qualification means.
''I look around the various qualifying groups in Europe and I cannot
see any side better than Russia,'' said Brown. ''I would place them as
favourites to win the European title.
''Yet we have now played them twice and they have not been able to
beat us. We have had two draws, both creditable, and that gives me
reason to believe that we can do well in the finals.
''Obviously we could be drawn in a very difficult section, but, given
that we have a reasonable group when we get to England, then I know we
are capable of qualifying and reaching the quarter-finals.
''I would have been disappointed if we had not been able to get to the
finals. Look, I recognise our deficiencies but what we have been able to
achieve is a spirit among the players which we can build on.
''We don't have a Jim Baxter, Denis Law, or Jimmy Johnstone. What we
do have is a solid group of players who will fight for each other and
who will get results. They have shown that and they will show it all
again when we get to England.
''We are very difficult to beat. Our defensive record has been superb.
Not another team in Europe can better us as far as goals against are
concerned. You have to be pleased about that. Anyone would be pleased
about that.
''But we realise that from middle to front, we have to do better and
we also have to produce a partnership up front. We used to be able to
say we had Johnston and McCoist and we knew that was the right
combination. At this moment we don't have that.''
But Brown does believe that the pairing of Scott Booth and Ally
McCoist can still provide the Scots with the cutting edge they require.
Neither of the two front men who have scored the goals which now have
carried their country to the finals -- McCoist against the Greeks and
Booth against the Finns -- are yet at the peak Brown believes they will
reach. Both have had lengthy injury lay-offs, have suffered problems
while playing for Scotland, and now Brown reckons they are still some
games away from the form they can both demonstrate.
''Age is not a barrier for Ally McCoist as far as I am concerned,''
said the manager. ''You have only to look at other countries and you
will see John Aldridge, with the Republic, and Peter Beardsley, with
England, and both of these players are much older than McCoist.
''But he needs some more games. Scott Booth is the same. I would think
that inside a couple of months he will be back to what we look for from
him. By then he will have had more games, been worked hard under good
coaches at Aberdeen, and he will be proving that he is one half of the
partnership we want.
On the run up to the games in England, Brown will find out for sure.
He has two friendly matches in Sweden next month, at full and at ''B''
level to help him, then the final group game against San Marino and
three matches in the spring.

TILBURY'S 750 employees stand to gain at least #23,500 from the
proposed acquisition with the average worker in line for some #75,000
and many standing to get even more.
When the port was the subject of a management employee buy-out from
the Port of London Authority three years ago staff were allocated 291
shares each and given the opportunity to purchase more with the average
additional take-up being a further 600.
Their situation is in stark contrast to the traditional dockworkers,
many of whom were forced out of the industry in 1989 with the abolition
of the controversial National Dock Labour Scheme which was said to gave
dockers' ''jobs for life''.
Tilbury, the largest multi-purpose facility on the Thames, flourished
from the move towards container traffic in the seventies which saw
traditional docks in London's East End systematically close with cargos
re-allocated to down-river container terminals.
Its location was chosen because it is close to the principal European
shipping lanes yet still is striking distance of the UK's main
concentration of population.
It covers a large area of some 325 hectares and includes eight
kilometres of quays plus riverside berths and enclosed docks and last
year had its highest ever throughput of 6.9 million tonnes, all of it
dry cargo.
Tilbury's container division, the third largest in the UK, handled a
record 382,000 ''boxes'' carrying 3.2 million tonnes of cargo last year.
It also owns the rail station and rail container terminal.
Tilbury is also one of the largest UK forest products ports with some
1.4 million tonnes handled last year much of it for the building and
newsprint markets.
Similarly it is a major handler of grain with an annual throughput of
more than one million tonnes. It is capable of handling both imports and
exports and traffic tends to be wheat and maize imports and grain
exports.
A fourth division markets and manages property assets not allocated to
container, forest products or grain traffic. It includes the London
International Cruise Terminal and over 40 hectares of land available for
development or letting.

Ross Finlay finds the Peugeot much sleeker than he had feared
HAVING now driven several of them, I am beginning to see the appeal of
the new generation of multi-purpose vehicles. The Galaxy/Sharan has
already been well publicised, the latest Honda Shuttle is on the market,
and now their Peugeot-built rival has broken cover.
This is another vehicle which no single manufacturer is prepared to
market on its own, and the Peugeot 806 will have some very near
relatives wearing Citroen, Fiat or Lancia badges. The Peugeot and Fiat
groups jointly own the Sevelnord factory in northern France where all
these cars are produced. Peugeot manages the factory.
Although it has never been in this sector of the market before,
Peugeot used to be keen on extended-wheelbase estate cars -- the 504
family estate, for example -- designed to carry more people than the
standard saloons on which they were based. In fact, the 504 and the
earlier 404 still seem very sensible vehicles, and remain the mainstay
of local transport businesses in many parts of Africa.
Some of us were expecting the new generation of MPVs to be big and
ugly, and not particularly car-like in their road manners. In fact, they
are much sleeker-looking than we feared, and not all that massive. The
806 may be taller, but it is only two inches longer than a 405 saloon.
Of course, what it lacks is the saloon's separate luggage boot.
Peugeot engineers realised that the 806 needs to feel like a
differently shaped private car, rather than a van with windows. On an
introductory test drive, two different models were unexpectedly agile,
easy to manoeuvre and possessed of remarkably high ride quality.
At prices from about #16,500, the 806 comes with either a two-litre
petrol engine or a 1.9-litre turbo diesel. These are familiar Peugeot
units, and if the petrol job is bound to be hard-worked hauling its
maximum complement of eight people around, the turbo diesel is the one
which produces better mid-range pull.
Peugeot has variable seating arrangements in its SL, SR and SV models,
which also come with progressively higher standards of trim and
equipment, and the 806 is as versatile as its rivals in the matter of
folding, swivelling or removing individual seats. To provide maximum
space utilisation, its rear suspension units are entirely under floor
level.
Some MPV designers insist they should be walk-through affairs from the
driver's seat, others do not think it matters. Peugeot allows space for
this to happen by placing the handbrake to the driver's right, and by
mounting the gear lever on the fascia. At first glance you might expect
a long lever concealed within the central console, but it is actually
quite short, with a high-set pivot point.
Different designers also have different ideas about doors. On the 806,
the front doors hinge from the front, the two rear side doors slide
back. To begin with, this is slightly unexpected, because all four doors
have identical exterior handles.
The high driving position is convenient and comfortable, and
visibility all round is fine. Passenger space is much as you would
expect, although I doubt if the third row of seats is going to provide
as much space as some users are likely to hope for.
The 806 will not be a particularly high performer until the engine
range extends itself next year -- the 150bhp version should shift quite
smartly -- but it is a very pleasant car to handle, and the suspension
expertise which Peugeot has shown over the decades is in evidence once
again. The two long-wheelbase test cars coped very easily with
occasional rumpled road surfaces.
There are some intriguing details, like the way the ashtray cover
flips up then springs down into a slot in the fascia, and the top models
have twin sunroofs as standard. Power steering, central locking,
deadlocks and an immobiliser are available right through the range,
while trim and finish show that in its first assault on the MPV market,
Peugeot certainly means business.

THE announcement by 100 of the UK's largest companies that they will
reverse the trend towards ageism in employment appears, on the surface,
to be a step in the right direction. But a more detailed examination of
their motives may tell a different story.
Public awareness of the evil of ageism has been growing and many
politicians are now showing an interest due to the fact that many of
their constituents are over 40 and daily facing ageist attitudes by
greedy employers only too willing to exploit their workforce.
The backlash against age discrimination has now started in earnest and
many employers are worried. To enhance their ''caring'' image, many
employers have joned the anti-ageism bandwagon. But what they say and
what they actually do may be totally different.
This statement is based on fact, not conjecture. I have been the
victim of age discrimination on hundreds of occasions and have received
letters from people all over Scotland similarly afflicted.
One of the companies involved in the anti-ageism initiative just
happens to be one of the leading exponents of age discrimination in the
UK. Its record in this field is appalling and would have attracted legal
proceedings in the USA or various other countries who have anti-ageism
legislation.
These companies are running scared of the punitive legislation which
will be introduced by Labour if elected in 1997 or earlier. The
legislation will give workers human rights which the present Government,
and many employers, do not want to give. They prefer voluntary codes and
''initiatives'' which can and will be conveniently ignored in the
real-life situation.
Write to your MPs and let them know that legislation against age
discrimination is the only real answer.

I NOTE with interest the views expressed by the Scottish Low Pay Unit
in respect of a national minimum wage and its speculation on the numbers
of individuals likely to benefit from such a development.
Those proffering such a proposal, also mooted by at least two
political parties, appear not to have recognised the changes which have
taken place in the workplace.
In the construction industry in particular there has been a rapid
increase in the use of labour-only sub-contractors (LOSCs). This is a
term applied to individuals who simply hire out their labour to
companies. The advantages to such companies is that they are freed from
the costs, eg holiday pay, sick pay, National Insurance payments,
redundancy payments, etc, that bona fide employers are required to meet.
As LOSCs are not paid a ''wage'', they are rewarded for completing a
task, I would assume it follows that they would be outwith the scope of
any minimum wage legislation.
However the LOSCs will, in an effort to secure work, undercut any
predetermined minimum wage, effectively undermining the principles
behind such legislation and also the viability of those companies which
offer employment.
Without addressing this issue the imposition of a minimum wage will
further destabilise employment practices, lead to a further depression
of wages, and encourage a rapid growth in the numbers of LOSCs,
resulting in any minimum wage becoming an irrelevance as the number of
employees rapidly declines in the face of the growth of LOSCs.

SCOTTISH Brewers, erstwhile major backers of Scottish rugby through
their McEwan's brand and its jolly cavalier logo, yesterday completed
their four-club stable of teams in the Tennents premiership first
division with the much touted announcement that they have signed up
Edinburgh Academicals to join Boroughmuir, Heriot's FP, and Gala, writes
Derek Douglas.
Tennents, who have invested heavily in Scottish rugby with major
backing for the new league structure and the SRU Tennents 1556 Cup,
would undoubtedly have preferred McEwan's to withdraw quietly when their
nine-year relationship as the game's overall sponsor came to an end last
season.
However, with four of the top eight clubs now signed up by McEwan's
and three others flying the flag of rival brewing houses, the only
premiership firt division side now paying lip-service to the temperance
movement is Hawick with backing from Pringle of Scotland.
Glenmorangie, as confirmed only last week, remains the major sponsor
of Edinburgh Academicals, and McEwan's involvement -- for a five-figure
sum over three years -- does not extend to the brand logo appearing on
the Academicals' strip.
Instead, the McEwan's flag will be flown in the form of advertising
banners at the ground and already a 24-metre hoarding stretches along
the wall adjacent to Inverleith Park. The brewers have also given
financial assistance for the construction of a temporary stand and the
McEwan's Centre beer tent. There are also plans for enhanced corporate
hospitality facilities and a clubhouse refurbishment.
* McEWAN'S also announced yesterday that they are to back a coaching
masterclass headed by 1990 Grand Slam captain David Sole. Every Monday
evening during November the McEwan's Masterclass will offer players and
coaches the opportunity to attend a 90-minute coaching session. Clubs
will be circulated with details.
Scheduled dates and venues: November 6, Aberdeen GS FP; November 13,
Kelso; November 20, Glasgow Southern; November 27, Preston Lodge FP.

I am sure I am not the only person who found the activities of the SNP
at the premiere of Braveheart thoroughly distasteful.
It started with Alex Salmond's unpleasant remark about Michael
Forsyth. This set the tone for his supporters who were presumably
responsible for the booing and barracking when the Secretary of State
arrived for the performance.
Incitement in whatever form is a dangerous game. One thing can lead to
another and I doubt if Alex Salmond has the wisdom or the maturity to
handle the consequences.
I do not believe, under normal circumstances, such an incident would
have happened; people's natural good manners would have prevented it.
There then followed the pre-planned campaign using, without
permission, Braveheart images for recruiting purposes. Surely Scotland's
folk-heroes, especially from so long ago, belong to all Scots and not
just a minority political party.
This was the premiere of a film made for the entertainment of everyone
who chooses to go and see it. It was not a party political rally and in
attempting to use it as such Alex Salmond has shown not only discourtesy
to the makers of the film but also serious lack of judgment.
Behind it lies the Nationalists' determination to persist with their
anti-English nigglings. If people were to say the same sort of thing
about the French or the Spanish they would be accused of racism. The SNP
say they are not a racist party. I hope not, but they often sound like
it.

SNP Councillor Jim Mitchell hits out at political leaders attending
the Braveheart premiere who support Scotland's continued place within
the UK (September 6). His robust language indicates his depth of feeling
about UK Government institutions.
The constitutional nationalists in Ireland in the early part of this
century won support for independence by refusing to take their seats
when elected. Councillor Mitchell calls the SNP ''the custodian of the
modern-day struggle for Scottish freedom''. If he hates the ''British
State'' so much, why does he take his seat in a British local authority
and presumably receive financial reimbursement for so doing? He is
participating in the British Government apparatus he so despises.
At the premiere of Braveheart, Councillor Mitchell's party tried a
cheap political trick by attempting to link the SNP to William Wallace.
They must now realise how stupid a stunt it was.
They handed out SNP handbills with a picture of an Australian
(millionaire) actor/director rather than a picture of the real William
Wallace. The actor (Mel Gibson) confessed to knowing little about
Scottish politics and denied that he gave his permission to use his
photo.
The SNP are a party of hypocrisy and hype. The electorate are not
fooled. The SNP won less than a quarter of the vote in Scotland at the
last General Election. Their number of MPs dropped from four to three.
No wonder Jim Sillars (ex-SNP MP for Govan) called the Scottish
electorate ''90-minute patriots''!

CHRIS Eubank, ''spooked'' by the very thought of Steve Collins'
hypnotism in March, will this time be ready for the ''phantom'' fighter
in tomorrow's #1.6m re-match in Cork.
Eubank insists his spirits are just about right to perform a bout of
exorcism at the Pairc Ui Chaomimh Gaelic football stadium in the attempt
to win back the World Boing Organisation super-middleweight title from
the 31-year-old Dubliner.
Collins, of course, won a major psychological battle in the first
fight at Millstreet five months ago, with the Irishman's hypnotherapy
revelations at the weigh-in cutting deeply into Eubank's mind -- and the
title changed hands.
Eubank, who will be receiving a #400,000 purse against the #1.2m of
Collins, said: ''I'm not fighting for money here, I'm fighting for
honour. I'm fighting to put the wrong right. Being a challenger, there
is no room for chivalry, no room for being larger than life.''
Collins was amused that Eubank swallowed his hypnotism tale ''rod and
all,'' but the former champion undoubtedly let his man wriggle off the
hook in the tenth round, flooring him, but then posing instead of
punching.
Eubank added: ''My back is against the wall, I'm going to fight like a
wounded animal. I can't see how I will hold back. I have held back many
times. But if he gets up, I'm going to plant him into the canvas.
''I can't afford to lose. It's been running in my mind. I've been
training hard and putting the hours in.''
A virus before the first meeting left Eubank with more than 10lb to
shed in two days after feeding the illness to feel right on the night.
''I was spooked by Collins, and I had the virus. I knew I couldn't
beat the pain barrier, but now I'm prepared for a phantom fighter. I can
deal with it all now,'' added Eubank.
''I thought a 55% Chris Eubank was good enough to beat Collins. If he
comes at me like he did last time I will annihilate him. If he comes at
me like Michael Watson did in the second fight, I will beat him -- get
hurt, but I will beat him. I haven't made any allowance for any type of
defeat.''
Collins has again employed the services of Tony Quinn, a well-known
Irish hypnotist. Once more the only man to beat Eubank is ready for
major mind games in the first defence of his WBO crown.
''When everyone was doubting me last time, he gave me confidence in
myself and made me believe that I could do it. It was just a question of
psychology,'' said Collins.
''Obviously, I am not going to say precisely how I see the fight
going. All I will say is that I will win it, and then I'm going on to
bigger things, such as fights with Nigel Benn and Roy Jones.''
The fight will be refereed by Puerto Rico's Ismael Fernandez, who was
a judge last time and scored it 114-113 to Collins.
The judges are all Americans, Genaro Rodriquez, of Chicago, Miami's
Paul Herman, and Aaron Kizer, from Pheonix.

THE decision by the New Zealand RFU to offer an immediate amnesty to
players who have switched codes to rugby league has been condemned as
''stupid and crazy'' by Scottish International Board member Fred McLeod.
McLeod, the SRU senior vice-president who was a member of the Board's
four-man working party which paved the way for last month's decision to
scrap the amateurism laws, said it was unbelievable that the NZRFU had
made a unilateral decision in advance of an IB meeting in Tokyo later
this month, when world-wide regulations on rugby union's relationship
with league would be hammered out.
The NZRFU announced yesterday that it did not plan to have a
stand-down period for players who wished to return to rugby union.
Currently, depending on individual circumstances, the IB insists upon a
three-year moratorium for ex-union players who had defected to league.
NZRFU chairman Richie Guy said: ''The issue will differ from country
to country, but in Australia and New Zealand, particularly New Zealand,
it would probably be impossible for us to enforce a stand-down period.''
Legal experts have claimed that any attempt to impose a stand-down
period would be regarded as restraint of trade under Australian and New
Zealand law.
''The position that we would adopt is that there will be no stand-down
period for a player being reinstated from league to rugby,'' added Guy,
who revealed that New Zealand would suggest to the IB that each country
adopt its own regulations on reinstatement.
The Kiwi decision would appear to be yet another example of Southern
Hemisphere unions forcing the hand of world legislators, just as they
did on the issue of professionalism.
McLeod declared: ''It seems absolutely crazy to me that any union
would come to such a decision when they know full well that this topic
is on the agenda for Tokyo.
''However, I am sure that the other unions will not allow themselves
to be railroaded by New Zealand and that they will want to take proper
advice before reaching a conclusion. It seems to me to be particularly
stupid when you consider that the Tokyo meeting is only a fortnight
away.''
Recent All Black converts to professional rugby league include Wigan's
Va'aiga Tuigamala and his former Central Park team-mate, Frano Botica,
who is now at Auckland Warriors.
Only two high profile Scots have crossed the wire to rugby league in
recent years, Stirling County's George Graham and the Kelso and Scotland
centre Alan Tait. Both have said that once the new regulations are
decided they would consider re-enlisting with the union code in one form
or another.
* THE NZRFU council hae announced that Ross Cooper will be assistant
coach to Laurie Mains for the All Black tour of Italy and France later
this year.
Cooper, a selector, takes over from Earle Kirton, who has held the
position for the past four seasons.

LET us indeed raise a cheer for Braveheart! This powerful film could
be just the catalyst we need to rouse the forces of liberation and
progress from their current stupor.
In gaining the ecstatic support of the SNP, it has single-handedly
managed to strip away the veneer of rational tolerant ''modernism''
proclaimed by that party in order to expose the dangerous and regressive
impetuses behind all nationalism.
Nazism too loved to reminisce about medieval slaughter and extol the
manly virtues of its Teutonic knights, whilst the current tragedy in
former Yugoslavia was partly provoked by rallies held to commemorate the
600th anniversary of the fourteenth Battle of Kosovo.
The historical and contemporary concomitants of nationalism (including
the British version promoted by the Conservative Party) have been
exclusivity, hatred, and violence.
Far from pride, the vicious brutality portrayed in Braveheart should
inspire revulsion, and a determination to avoid its recurrence by
reasserting the common-sense virtues of universal equality, unity, and
peaceful coexistence.

DONALD Anderson (September 4) defends the SNP's exploitation of the
Braveheart film. However, the SNP is not logically ''following in
Wallace's footsteps''. The SNP demands that Scotland, as a nation state,
be a member of the European Union. This is the antithesis of what
Wallace fought for.
Under the terms of Maastricht, no individual state can determine the
proportion of its GDP spent on social services (education, health,
benefits, etc). No state has control over investment or capital
movement. Hence no member state can develop independent policies on
farming, fishing, transport, shipbuilding, etc.
It is a hypocritical sham to pretend to the Scottish people that they
can be ''independent'' within the European Union.
What the SNP offers is that, rather than have Westminster hand over
control of our economy and social affairs to Brussels, we ourselves
should have the right to surrender what little sovereignty and
democratic rights we currently enjoy.
Then we can get down on our knees and beg for handouts from the
non-elected bankers and bureaucrats who run and control the EU.

WHAT a cruel fate: for a hu-
morist to be outclassed in wit by a Calvinist professor on the
opposite page!
George Birrell (September 7) should stick to facts, preferably ones
which he has verified for himself, not those dredged from the opinions
of other people, mostly Unionists. What he wrote about the economics of
the SNP is old, dreary, unconvincing stuff.
Why, Mr Birrell might tell us, do our young people flee Scotland
equipped with their splendid qualifications, to be welcomed in Europe,
America, and in the Far East? Are they driven by a unique spirit of
adventure as the Unionists have always said? Or is it because we have
created nothing worthwhile to keep them at home?
Why the miserable levels of investment in the technology about which
we boast so much. Isn't it time to match other countries which started
not so long ago from a technical base of zero?
Why the accusations of being subsidy junkies in Scotland when vastly
greater volumes of wealth are poured into the South-east of England?
Why, over the years, the constant devaluations of our currency? The
elephant with which we in Scotland share a bed, is worse even than
Trudeau's in Canada: ours is very sick indeed.
I have now retired from the fray and look around me to see mostly old
people living on pensions. The population of Scotland is falling,
uniquely among the developing countries of the world. Our brightest and
best are leaving or else are in public service and not creating wealth.
It is time for George Birrell to open his eyes to the reality of
Scotland and come to the conclusion as I did long ago: our only hope is
a worthy hope -- Independence in Europe.

GEORGE Birrell's article (September 7) shows just how angry Unionists
get when the SNP speak up for Scotland.
Mr Birrell takes issue with the SNP's detailed static budget document
''Paying Our Fair Share -- and More''. He says that Labour and the
Tories agree that the Scottish deficit is between #6-8 billion.
Actually, they only agree on this point when they remember that their
job-share responsibility is to talk Scotland down. Sometimes, they
forget themselves, as in George Robertson's response to our budget
document. Asked if he thought that Scotland was in the red, he replied:
''Possibly even-stevens. I don't accept for a moment that we are
subsidised.''
The SNP's analysis is the only attempt to calculate Scotland's
budgetary position for the current financial year, 1995/96. Other
analyses and other figures refer to 1992/93, when of course the UK
deficit was much larger than it is now.
Scotland's relative position has strengthened since 1992/93, and North
Sea revenues are also rising.
Calculating the SNP's budget estimates in line with the most
up-to-date sources available yields a #200m surplus relative to the rest
of the UK for 1995/96.
The SNP will not hesitate in spreading the positive message that
Scotland is well able to stand on her own two feet, and would derive
economic benefit from doing so.
Scots should reflect on the fact that the richest nations in the world
tend also to be the smallest. To quote John Kay, visiting professor of
economics at the London Business School: ''The evidence (of the
twentieth century) is of the economic success of small states . . .
Small countries, like small companies, can be nimble on their feet and
dominate niche markets that their bigger rivals cannot reach''.
If Scotland is such an economic black hole, why are the Tories and
Labour so determined to hold on to us? The truth is that they want
Scotland for what we can do for them, not for what they can do for us.

YOU'D be excused for thinking that by confirming his attention to the
subject of friendship (September 5) John Macleod would be able to keep
his bigotry and hatred under wraps for just one article. But oh no, it
was sadly beyond him.
He finds time amongst a worthy celebration of the human spirit to
throw in a tirade against gay people for making him so nervous of close
physical contact with men, for fear that this will be seen as weird or
unnatural.
I would venture a suggestion that he might feel a good deal less
''terrified'' of the stigma he feels if he didn't spend all his efforts
creating it in the first place. If he feels awkward, think how the
castigated homosexual must feel.
Fear and ignorance is a serious condition. Fortunately, it need not be
terminal. Knowledge and experience can alleviate the suffering he
associates with gay people.
If, like me, he were to actually spend some time with gay people, it
is a fairly short process to the understanding that gays are not
subhuman, and are warm, honest, friendly people, the same as everybody
else.
He may even be able to enjoy the moment when he can confidently shake
hands with homosexuals, or even take part in a big bear-hug, safe in the
knowledge that he won't catch anything nasty or be hounded by the
immoral majority. However, I wouldn't want to get his hopes up too soon.
I wish John Macleod all the best for the recommended treatment. I'm
sure it will be painful for him, but he'll reap the benefits in the end.

WEST of Scotland have had the understandable reaction to defeat at
Selkirk on the opening day of the Tennents premiership last week.
Changes!
Scott McKechnie and Sandy Crear have been restored to the pack for the
second division match against Jed-Forest at Burnbrae, and Tony
Greenshields has been introduced at full back.
Greenshields and his twin, Tyrone, both Glasgow under-21
representatives, have switched from Glasgow Southern to West, where they
renew acquaintance with Colin Mair, the coaching overseer at Burnbrae.
While at Keil School, the brothers played for Glasgow Schools teams
coached by Mair.
Jed will field the team who played for most of the game in the 9-5 win
over GHK at Riverside Park last week. Clark Laidlaw, son of Roy, the
former Scotland and Lions No.9, will remain at scrum half, where he took
over when his father's club and international successor, Gary Armstrong,
was injured early in the game.
Watsonians, Melrose, and Hawick, all first division winners last week,
have unchanged teams for their respective home games against Stirling
County, Boroughmuir, and Heriot's.
Stirling, who opened their championship defence with a home defeat by
Hawick, have been strengthened by Stewart Hamilton's return at lock. The
redoubtable 39-year-old forward missed last week's defeat because of a
groin strain.
Boroughmuir, drawing on their youth resources, will field no fewer
than four players who were in Scotland's FIRA under-19 championship
squad in Bucharest in April.
Three of them -- Graeme Beveridge, Alastair Cadzow, and Steve Wands --
were in the team beaten by Edinburgh Academicals last week, and they
have now been joined by Alastair McLean, who is deputising on the left
wing for the unavailable Iwan Tukalo.

THE top 12 clubs in Wales yesterday took their first steps towards
challenging the Welsh Rugby Union's ability to govern the national game.
The 12 -- Aberavon, Abertillery, Bridgend, Cardiff, Ebbw Vale,
Llanelli, Neath, Newbridge, Newport, Pontypridd, Swansea, and Treorchy
-- feel the WRU are neglecting their interests at the expense of the
lesser clubs and have formed a new limited company.
They believe their venture will set the trends as rugby union takes
its first steps towards professionalism.
''Representatives of all first division clubs have formed a company,
First Division Rugby Limited, as an initial step in their proposals to
improve the administration and development of the game,'' they revealed
in a prepared statement.
''There was universal dismay that, yet again, decisions had been
taken, such as the SWALEC Cup sponsorship deal and the introduction of
bonus points into the Heineken League competition, without reference to
and consultation with them.''

JOHN Higgins will be looking for revenge when he tackles fellow Scot
Alan McManus in the first round of the Regal Masters later this month at
the Motherwell Civic Centre. Higgins, up to No.11 in the world rankings,
tackles McManus (No.6) on the opening day, September 19, with the winner
taking on England's Ronnie O'Sullivan in the quarter-finals two days
later.
''There is going to be a great atmosphere. I can't wait for the match
to get under way,'' said 20-year-old Higgins. ''I played Alan in the
first round of the World championship in April and lost 10-3. It didn't
sink in for a few weeks, but it was a really bad result for me. Now the
Masters is a good opportunity to get my own back.''
Last season, Higgins, then 19, became the first teenager to win three

JIM Criner, the Scottish Claymores' coach, will run the rule over
Scotland's best young talent this weekend. He will oversee youth clinics
at Crownpoint Stadium, Glasgow, tomorrow and Myreside in Edinburgh on
Sunday, hoping to find a star of the future.
The American has spent the last three months since the season ended
plotting for the new campaign, now seven months away.
''I have been busy looking at players and getting my coaching staff
together for next season. I have been talking to college and pro coaches
to find out as much as I can about players,'' he said.
''Last season I was saddled with somebody else's squad.''
The Claymores have opened an office in California to co-ordinate the
American side of their operation, and Criner expects to be back in
Scotland in October when the team will host three try-outs for Scottish
players.
The American draft is due to take place on February 17, followed by a
training camp in Atlanta before the new season.

<HEADLINE>Forth Ports buys Tilbury for #121m</HEADLINE>

FORTH Ports has announced a #121.6m agreed bid for Tilbury docks in
London which will double the size of the Leith-based ports company
overnight.
Forth Ports will raise #70.5m through a one-for-two rights issue to
help finance the bid, with Bank of Scotland providing a further #64m of
loans and overdraft facilities.
Alistair Fleming, an executive director of the Weir Group, will become
chief executive of the enlarged group later this year. He will replace
Hugh Thompson who, after 11 years at the helm, is stepping back to
become deputy chairman.
Forth Ports said its offer had been recommended by the board of ITL,
the company which owns Tilbury, and shareholders owning 70% of ITL
shares had already agreed to sell.
ITL is a management and employee buyout vehicle which bought Tilbury
docks when it was privatised in 1992. It is not listed on the stock
exchange.
Tilbury considered a flotation earlier this year, but eventually
decided on a trade sale instead. ''We started to negotiate at the
beginning of July, so it's been a pretty fast track operation all the
way through,'' Mr Thompson said.
The deal is subject to approval by Forth Ports' own shareholders at an
extraordinary general meeting to be held on October 2, but does not face
any regulatory hurdles.
Mr Thompson said the purchase of Tilbury had not deflected Forth
Ports' ambition to buy the ports of Dundee and Rosyth as well. But
Dundee, where Forth Ports is bidding against its Glasgow-based rival
Clydeport, and Rosyth are small beer compared with Tilbury.
Tilbury is the biggest multi-purpose port on the Thames estuary, and
lies at the heart of South-east England. It handled 6.9 million tonnes
of dry cargo last year, ranging from grain and timber to containers and
made a pre-tax profit of #7.6m on turnover of #40.2m.
Floated on the Stock Exchange at privatisation three years ago, Forth
Ports has proved a smaller but more dynamic company. In 1994, it
achieved pre-tax profits of #13.7m -- double those of Tilbury -- on
turnover of only #35.7m.
Forth Ports yesterday announced a healthy 21% increase in pre-tax
profits to #6.9m during the six months to July 2. Turnover rose 11% to
#18.1m and the company announced a 33% rise in the interim dividend to
3.6p from 2.7p.
The good results and positive reaction to the purchase of Tilbury
lifted Forth Ports shares 35p to 625p, but shareholders will only have
to pay 490p for the rights issue.
Forth Ports said the acquisition of Tilbury would enhance earnings in
the first full financial year afterwards, even though gearing will soar
from zero to more than 100% in the short term.
In addition to borrowing #64m to help pay for ITL, Forth Ports is
taking on #10m of ITL debt, but Mr Thompson said high gearing was not
problem. ''The cash generation of both companies is very strong. If we
were to suspend all capital expenditure we could write this off in
3[1/2] years. It's not something that worries us,'' he said.
From an operational point of view, Tilbury gives Forth Ports a wider
geographical spread and a gateway to the main population centre of
England. The dry cargo operations at Tilbury will also reduce Forth
Ports' present dependence on bulk oil and chemicals traffic at
Grangemouth and Braefoot Bay.
Bulk liquids accounted for over 90% of the 44 million tonnes of cargo
handled by Forth Ports last year, and its dry cargo traffic in Leith has
been falling.
Mr Thompson said Forth Ports would not try to exploit vacant land in
Tilbury for commercial development, as it has done successfully in
Leith, since the available land was only suitable for port related
activities. ''That part of the world really does not lend itself to
housing and offices,'' he said.
Forth Ports has leased land in Leith for the construction of the new
Scottish Office headquarters and a series of satellite developments,
including a hotel, offices and flats. But Mr Thompson said this was
merely a lucrative sideline and Forth Ports was determined to
concentrate on shipping as its mainstream activity.
Looking ahead, he said Forth Ports would take a while to digest
Tilbury, but the group still aimed to expand further. ''I would say that
18 months to two years down the road we will be sniffing around again to
see what's available,'' Mr Thompson added.

WE have looked forward to the Prime Minister's visit to Scotland today
because it is always good to see a politician at his best. Two things
appear to bring out Mr Major's sterling qualities. One is the slightest
whiff of electioneering at which he is more than competent. It is clear
that the next General Election campaign has begun, although nobody need
expect the opportunity to slip a ballot into the box until the spring of
1997. There are fond memories of Mr Major at the last election with his
soap-box and a degree of grittiness and courage which almost
single-handedly turned his party's prospects around. It was not possible
to agree with all he said, but the way in which he said it was brave and
admirable. The second catalyst for an effective Major is Scotland where
he talks the most unreconstructed nonsense and displays a measure of
determination to do the wrong thing which would grace an unruly pit bull
terrier. More of that later.
The problem with political expectations is that they are rarely met;
in launching his umpteenth rebirth of the Tory Party Mr Major has failed
to live up to even that low standard. His pronouncements on the new
direction for Conservative policy which were reported yesterday from the
first day of his four-day nationwide tour almost defy description.
Indeed they need to be quoted in their entirety for the full banality to
be caught accurately. Suffice to say that this new and detail-free
programme will take us through, not just the next General Election, but
through the millennium as well. Mr Major's aim is to get the Tory Party
to ''take ownership'' of this new direction. Is this ownership as in
council house sales, or ownership as in share options, or ownership as
in yet another meaningless phrase? We are taking out a whole series of
ideas and options, says Mr Major, as if there is a political version of
the TSB with hole-in-the-wall availability of options to fit all
eventualities. These options will solve the problems of the late 1990s
and the period beyond. And what are these problems? Mr Major can say
only that he will be in detailed discussions on what these problems are
and the best way to deal with them. Good. There are problems facing us,
which anybody could have told him, but he still needs to discuss what
they are and then move on to solutions.
As Mr Major is in Scotland it is only reasonable to help him along
with a discussion of some Scottish problems. At the very least this
might put some meat on the decidedly anorexic Tory millennium which we
face otherwise. Devolution is not a subject which Mr Major enjoys. He
has taken stock and found it wanting. What is needed is more local
democracy at grassroots level in Scotland, he believes. Unfortunately a
very large proportion of the Scottish electorate, including many avowed
Tory voters, disagrees. To say this is not to grasp devolution without
thought or caution. It is a serious step for any nation to take and it
must be planned carefully and must secure a good measure of general
approval. Labour, for instance, has yet to convince with what passes for
its detailed proposals. Nevertheless devolution is one method of
allowing Scotland to take a reasonable measure of control of its own
future. Rail privatisation is another problem. It is of deep concern in
a heavily populated central belt and even more concerning for the threat
it poses to the rest of the country. For the sake of what is left of our
transport system it must not be allowed to proceed. These are only two
problems which face us. We do not want Mr Major to ''take ownership'' of
them, but to resolve them in a way which is responsive to Scotland's
needs, now and in the future.

ALISTAIR Fleming, who will shortly take over as chief executive of
Forth Ports following its acquisition of Tilbury, is a 51-year-old
engineer with a string of major achievements behind him, writes ROBERT
POWELL.
For the last four years he has been an executive director of the
Glasgow-based Weir Group, which took a quantum leap last year with the
acquisition of Envirotech Pumpsystems in the United States.
After graduating from Glasgow University with a first in engineering,
Mr Fleming joined ICI and spent some time on a company project in Texas.
Returning to the UK, he joined Britoil in 1981 and stayed with the firm
after its acquisition by BP.
Mr Fleming led the team that opened up the Clyde North Sea oilfield
and became general manager of projects for BP Exploration. He then
joined Eurotunnel, supervising the digging of the undersea rail link
between England and France as director of engineering.
But he left in 1991, before the Channel tunnel's completion, to become
an executive director of Weir Group, which makes specialist pumps and
valves. He was then head-hunted to take over the driving seat at Forth
Ports.
Mr Fleming replaces Hugh Thompson, 63, who will step down later this
year after 11 years as chief executive of Forth Ports. But Mr Thompson
will stay on as deputy chairman of the Leith-based company to supervise
the integration of Tilbury with its other operations on the Firth of
Forth over the next two years.
Mr Thompson joined Forth Ports in 1984, when it was still the
government-run Forth Ports Authority, and stayed at his post after the
company was privatised in 1992.
A native of Nairn, he worked for 13 years for the Dutch dredging and
marine civil engineering firm Bos &amp; Kalis, becoming group managing
director in 1974. He left Bos &amp; Kalis in 1980 to spend four years as a
director of the UK construction and civil engineering group Costain,
before joining Forth Ports.

IT is uncharacteristically frank of the Tories to put a ''Mr Robb'' in
charge of a privatisation programme. The gentleman in question has been
installed as chief salesman of the nuclear industry.
He was in Scotland this week to launch a company called British
Energy. There is indeed a great deal in a name. It is as clear a message
as can be sent out that the future intention, once privatised, is for
the company to diversify into gas if that's where the profits are.
It is also, however, a bit of a slap in the face to those dedicated
people who have devoted so much commitment to establishing a safe and
successful civil nuclear industry in this country. Now the architects of
privatisation have decided that nuclear is a word whose name they dare
not speak.
The Great Nuclear Robbery has nothing to do with Britain's energy
needs or the best interests of public finances. As with railways, the
decision to privatise is purely a political one, driven by the Tories'
urgent desire to fund tax-cuts before a General Election.
As the Financial Times put it: ''Privatisation is to be shaped by
political pressures and the interests of future shareholders, not by the
needs of electricity consumers.'' So too is the timescale of the
exercise, which is now being rushed through within a year. What a
strange Tory way to deal with the most potentially catastrophic industry
man has ever created.
It is worth noting some of the statements which were being made by
leading players just a few short months ago. Robin Jeffrey, now to be
deputy chairman of British Energy, told the Scottish Council Development
and Industry as recently as April: ''The creation of a single UK nuclear
company is a proposal which has little or nothing going for it. It would
mean less competition in the electricity generating industry.''
The Scottish Nuclear aim at that time was, of course, to get itself
privatised as a separate entity from Nuclear Electric. The Tories
brushed that aside, James Hann was shamefully shafted and now those who
remain are in the process of becoming loyal servants of British Energy
-- the company which ''has little or nothing going for it''.
At that time, the electricity regulator -- our flexible friend,
Professor Littlechild -- took a similar view. Indeed Dr Jeffrey was
adamant about one of the reasons why British Energy was a non-starter.
''Almost the next thing that would happen,'' he said, ''would be that
Stephen Littlechild would demand that it be split up. And'' -- Robin
Jeffrey's words, not mine -- ''any potential investor would look at it
like that.''
In the interim, Professor Littlechild has changed his tune in order to
dance in step with the Tories' privatisation imperative. But if we work
on the assumption that not even Electricity Regulators are immortal,
then Robin Jeffrey's warning is surely worth noting by the ''potential
investors'' at whom it was directed.
This week, I have been adding a few more warnings to those who might
fondly believe that this privatisation will be a doddle -- with British
Energy floated and share options safely distributed to Chairman Robb, Dr
Jeffrey, et al by this time next year, while Kenneth Clarke fences the
ill-gotten gains in the form of pre-election tax cuts.
With the public more attuned than ever before to the fact that
privatisation is, and has been, a massive rip-off of taxpayer and
consumer, it is not going to be nearly as straightforward as that. And
make no mistake, this is a sell-off which we would all have to finance
in the years ahead on the grand scale.
For starters, take the Magnox stations which are coming to the end of
their lives and which are to stay in the public sector. The best
estimate is that there will be a shortfall of over #3bn, between the
fund which has been built up for decommissioning and the actual cost.
Supposing the entire proceeds of nuclear privatisation were devoted to
this purpose, they would not meet that liability.
But of course they will not be put in the piggy-bank for that purpose,
since they cannot both pay for tax cuts in the short term and Magnox
decommissioning in the medium term. There is no doubt which has higher
priority for the Tories, so the taxpayer will later be asked to pay
again for decommissioning.
Eventually, the other nuclear stations will also fall due for
decommissioning. Does anyone believe that the Tories will require
private owners to sign up for that vast, unquantifiable cost? Yet in the
meantime, they would be extracting the profits which these stations
generate.
Liability for a major nuclear incident would be incalculable and I am
utterly confident that it will never happen as long as this country's
nuclear industry is run and regulated to its present high standards. But
we have to think of the unthinkable, when calculating how much of an
insurance burden a privatised nuclear industry should carry.
At present, the taxpayer theoretically underwrites the insurance of
nuclear power stations beyond a claim limit of #140m. The direct costs
of Chernobyl were, in contrast, #200bn. Quite simply, and whatever deal
the Tories cobble together over the next few months for political
reasons, the taxpayer cannot be left with anything like that scale of
risk.
As electoral and investor scepticism increases I predict that, a year
from now, nuclear privatisation will be in as big a mess as the great
rail sell-off now is; or better still, will have gone the way of Mr
Heseltine's Post Office privatisation -- into the dustbin of Tory
failures.

A SIGNIFICANT stage in the growth of East Kilbride-based Robert
Wiseman Dairies was marked yesterday by the start of deliveries to
stores in England from their new #10m plant in Manchester -- described
by chairman Alan Wiseman as Britain's most up-to-date and efficient
milk-processing facility.
The company has already signed up eight farmers who, from October 1,
will begin supplying the plant with 25,000 litres of milk a day.
Speaking at the company's annual meeting in Bothwell yesterday Mr
Wiseman described this as a reasonable start. ''Our big push to sign
contracts will be at the European Dairy Event at Stoneleigh and we will
have quite a campaign going then,'' he said.
Mr Wiseman reassured one questioner from the Dumfries area who
commented that the distinctive black-and-white Wiseman tankers now
seemed to be conspicuous by their absence on roads in her locality. ''I
have heard that some of the farmers down our way are going back to Milk
Marque,'' she said.
There had been no resignations, said Mr Wiseman but it was true that
two farmers had gone out of milk production. As a result the tanker
routes had been altered.
The chairman confirmed that the former CWS dairy in Glasgow was
scheduled to close at the end of this month following Wiseman's
acquisition of the society's liquid milk business. The transfer to the
company's modern facility on the Motherwell Food Park, Bellshill, would
lead to increased efficiency, he said.
The move will result in 65 redundancies but the 120 production and
distribution staff who are transferring to Bellshill would enjoy a
better remuneration package than they had with the CWS, said Mr Wiseman.
The meeting approved the accounts which showed a profit before tax of
#7m. The final dividend for the year was 2.75p, including an interim
payment of 0.9p.

THE CBI, reporting a fall in retail sales volumes for August,
yesterday called for interest rates to be left unchanged as the
Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, and Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie
George, met for their regular monthly monetary discussion.
There is strong speculation that Mr George has toned down his original
hawkish view on rates in the face of evidence that economic growth has
slowed.
The Treasury's September Monthly Monetary Report, also released
yesterday, said the economy is growing at a more sustainable rate than
in 1994 and that monthly indicators are, on balance, also consistent
with a modest slowdown.
The minutes of the previous Clarke/George meeting will be published on
September 20 and those from yesterday's meeting in about six weeks.
Meanwhile, base rates appear to be on hold, though suggestions in some
City quarters that the next move could even be downward, must be
considered premature.
There was a slight fall in retail sales volumes in August compared
with a year ago, according to the CBI's latest Distributive Trades
Survey. It follows four consecutive months of modest growth and
confounds retailers' expectations for a continuation of this during
August.
The underlying three-month trend, though, shows that annual sales
remain on an upward path. Undeterred by last month's outcome, retailers
expect sales volumes to pick up this month and, unlike August, they are
projected to be slightly above average for the time year.
But as the CBI pointed out, the pattern in sales has remained uneven
and difficult to anticipate since the beginning of the year. Certainly
there has been no evidence of any marked upturn in consumer spending
generally.
As far as selling prices are concerned, these rose further in the
month but a little more slowly than expected. While the increase was
slightly less than the price rise reported in May, and remains well
below its long-term average, selling prices are expected to increase
slightly faster in September.
The CBI's chief economic adviser, Kate Barker, said that given
uncertainties about economic developments and a slight upward trend in
costs and wages, the CBI was making no change in its policy
recommendation on interest rates. ''We think interest rates should be
left on hold for the time being,'' she said.
Last month, in its Quarterly Economic Report, the CBI said a further
half-point rise in bank base rate to 7.25% by the year-end should put
the Government on course to hit its inflation target, providing there is
no significant tax giveaway to consumers. In May, it had thought a
one-point rise would be needed.
The retail survey shows that business in August was mixed, with as
many sectors reporting year-on-year reductions in volumes as increases.
The largest rises were seen by chemists -- after a small fall in July
-- followed by grocers, booksellers and stationers, while confectionery,
tobacco and newspaper shops and off-licences saw only a small rise in
sales.
Those revealing the sharpest decline compared with a year ago were
furniture and carpet stores, specialist food shops like butchers and
bakers, and hardware, china, DIY and clothing retailers.
Commenting on the results, Alastair Eperon, chairman of the CBI's
Distributive Trades Survey Panel, said: ''The underlying trend continues
to point to a modest improvement in retail trade, although business in
August was rather uneven.''

George Hume considers whether an Act hurriedly introduced to cope with
a spate of dog attacks has had its day as campaigners fight for
amendments
ELEVEN-year-old Kelly Lynch was savaged to death by two rottweiler
dogs she was walking beside the Eckaigh river near Sandbank, Dunoon.
What had been family pets had turned, in an instant, into killers.
That tragedy was six years ago but, bizarrely, when the Government
rushed to judgment to curb the new fashion in macho pets with the
Dangerous Dogs Act, rottweilers -- the dogs that did kill -- got not a
mention; early indication of the dog control shambles that was to
follow.
Since then more than 800 family pets have been put down in Britain,
the majority allegedly of no danger to the public: most of them put to
death, it is claimed, because they were the wrong shape. In the process,
their owners each acquired a criminal conviction.
The removal by the Act of a court's discretion as to whether a dog
must be put down is at the core of an increasing campaign to compel the
Government to amend the legislation. A growing band of animal welfare
groups and MPs say all that is wanted is a change in the wording of the
Act from ''shall'' to ''may''.
But the Government has said it will not support parliamentary change
and Baroness Blatch has refused even to meet a legal campaigner, a
stance described by rebuffed solicitor Trevor Cooper as ''condescending
and disgraceful''.
Since it came into force in July 1991 the Act has been the target of
continuous and bitter challenge in the courts by dog owners whose pets
have been condemned to death and has cost the public purse around #10m.
Official figures show that in the Metropolitan Police area alone #2.8m
has been spent housing dogs seized from their owners after courts
ordered that they be put down. More than 100 dogs are being held by the
Metropolitan Police, a decision from the courts on their execution often
awaited over many months. Untold hundreds of dogs are in police kennels
the length and breadth of the country.
The most publicised action to stay execution has been the three-year
struggle for the life of the pit bull terrier called Dempsey. Dempsey
was condemned to death after its owner removed its muzzle in a public
park when the dog began to vomit. The court battle for Dempsey -- now
three years in police kennels -- seems set to run at least another year.
American pit bull terriers were the intended target of the Government
-- a little girl had been badly injured in Bradford -- and Japanese tosa
dogs, virtually unheard of in this country, were also specifically named
in the Act, the only two breeds mentioned.
The Act, however, is worded to apply to dogs ''of the type known as
Pit Bull Terriers'' and goes on to include ''any dog of any type
appearing to have been bred for fighting, or having the characteristics
of a fighting type''.
Says solicitor Trevor Cooper, who represents dog owners in 37 cases
currently before the courts: ''Hundreds of innocent family pets are
being killed simply because they have the wrong shape. In very few of
these cases are the dogs dangerous. The Government is simply turning a
deaf ear because it does not want to have to make a U-turn and then say
'Sorry, we made a mistake and killed your pets'.''
Breed experts say that, typically, a Staffordshire bull terrier
crossed with a boxer could give the appearance of a pit bull terrier.
Type, says Dr Molly Weekes of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Society, is
a ''nebulous description''. Most appeals against the destruction of dogs
concern expert evidence as to whether a dog is, in fact, a pit bull or
has any of its characteristics.
Since the Act came into force in July 1991 two other breeds have been
added, both South American hunting dogs -- the dogo Argentina and the
filia Braziliana -- even less known in Britain than the giant tosa dogs
from Japan. The muzzling of these dogs in public places -- even those
simply held to be of the ''type'' -- is mandatory. If unmuzzled, they
are said to be dangerously out of control in a public place, the court
has no discretion, and an order for the dog's destruction follows
automatically.
But under the draconian terms of the Act, all dogs are at risk on what
appear to be mere suspicions open to widely differing interpretations.
The Act states that if there are grounds for ''reasonable apprehension''
(reasonable apprehension is not quantified in the Act) that a dog will
injure any person, it can be held to be out of control. The sting comes,
however, in the second part of the third section of the Act.
If the dog is found to be out of control and has injured someone, no
matter how lightly, that is regarded as an aggravated offence and a
sentence of death on the dog is mandatory. Notwithstanding the
circumstances and though the injury may amount to no more than a minor
scratch, the court is allowed no discretion.
Pressing for amendment to the legislation is the Dangerous Dogs Act
1991 Reform Group, which is made up of a number of animal welfare
organisations. Clarissa Baldwin, chief executive of the National Canine
Defence League -- patron Her Majesty the Queen -- is the reform group
secretary.
She said: ''The Act is just not working and we will battle on to get
it changed. It was brought in in haste. Innocent dogs are dying and it
is causing so much anguish and agony that the Government cannot afford
to ignore it.
''It is such a simple amendment -- a matter of restoring discretion to
the courts which has, I think insultingly, been removed by the Act.''

A 26% increase in turnover to #304m at William Baird, the textiles

increase in interest costs resulting from a spate of acquisitions,
writes R E DUNDAS.
Pre-tax profits in fact dropped by 5% to #8.4m for the six months to
June 30. The results were also affected by the slowdown in the growth of
consumer expenditure on clothing in the second quarter, which continued
into the third, exacerbated by the prolonged hot summer.
The City took the news badly and the shares fell 15p to 220p.
Profits before interest grew by 10% to #10.7m, but the interest bill
jumped from #1m to #2.3m. Earnings per share were 6% lower at 4.9p, and
the interim dividend, which is not payable until January 5, was
maintained at 3.55p.
Baird's chairman Donald Parr said: ''The seasonality and short-term
costs of integrating new acquisitions, together with the associated
higher finance costs, have restricted profit growth in the first half.''

A TOP bid of #6000 was the principal feature yesterday in Perth at the
opening of the annual season of blackface ram sales.
However, underneath the top trade there was a distinct lack of
interest from commercial bidders, many of whom regard this traditional
sale date as being too early in the season, especially since it will be
almost three months before the rams are asked to do any work.
Hitting that peak of #6000 was a shearling from the long-established
Woolfords flock of Matthew Hamilton at West Calder. This one sold to
Robert Adam, Auldallan, Kirriemuir. Another from Woolfords sold at #3000
to Frank Bosomworth, Glenhead, Glenisla.
The Champion from Tom Paterson, Craigneich, Comrie, went at #3500 to
Woolfords, with another from the same pen selling at #2200 to Roger
Crawford, Ballymena, Northern Ireland.

LIBERAL Democrats from all over Britain will descend on Glasgow next
weekend for their national conference. As part of the party's guide to
the dear green place, the conference directory contains a helpful guide
to the Glasgow patois, extracted from Michael Munro's best-selling book
The Patter.
We can now look forward to hearing Lib-Dems who disagree with a
debating point enunciate such phrases as ''away and raffle yer
doughnut''. They may also ask: ''Whit is it wi' you?''
A delegate who may consider a fellow party member to be of a dreamy
disposition might well be heard to say that he or she is ''like a fart
in a trance''. When conference verges on the tedious, as it may well do,
delegates can remark that ''the nights are fair drawin' in''.
If a leading politician prevaricates on an issue, as they may well do,
their contribution will be described as they ''wouldnae say eechoe or
ochie''.
After a long day at the conference, hungry delegates will head for one
of Glasgow's many fine restaurants with the words: ''I could eat a
scabby dug.'' On arrival at the Ubiquitous Chip they will no doubt order
a bottle of the ''mammy mine''.
No doubt at the end of the week they will return to their
constituencies and deliver the opinion that their party ''couldnae run a
menage''.

NOW that Salman Rushdie is back doing public engagements, he might
like to pencil in an event at the Tron Theatre later this year. It is a
rehearsed reading of a play called Fatwa Patois whose main character
''Tariq Azid, a Glasgow joke shop manager, is the spitting image of
Solomon Rashide, the famous author of The Book of Beelzebub.'' And ''as
the mullahs declare a fatwa on the life of Rashide, Tariq's life takes a
turn for the worse''.
The play by Andrew Dallmeyer is described as a controversial black
comedy on a burning contemporary issue. Dallmeyer admits that it is
something of a challenge for a white, Edinburgh actor to bring to life
the character of a black, lapsed Muslim who is very much a Glaswegian by
upbringing and language.
''The whole play is an exercise in turning stereotypes on their heads.
The Muslim who is most in favour of the fatwa is a white convert to the
religion.''

CALUM Cashley, the Dundee chap who is standing against Winnie Ewing
for the post of president of the SNP, could be forgiven for feeling that
someone has got it in for him.
The Nats' journal, Scots Independent, carries in their conference
issue a feature on the candidates standing for the various posts of
power and influence within the party. All the candidates have their
photie in except Calum who is represented by a blank space. And in the
party's official conference handbook there is a section of biographical
details of candidates -- also with no mention of Mr Cashley.
* Scots Independent remains an invaluable litmus for the state of the
braid Scots or Doric or whatever you want to call it. Richard Heinsar,
convener of the Scots Tung action group, writes: ''A wis gey taken aback

Arresting sight
THE subject of Glasgow's Asian community and football was in the news
recently with the furore over a takeover bid for Partick Thistle.
Especially the bit where Thistle chairman Jim Oliver caused a stir by
referring to one of the bidders as ''an Asian with a curry shop''.
There was a football match in the city last Sunday when the polis of
Cranstonhill station played a team from the local Asian Community
Centre. The Asians wore natty Partick Thistle jerseys, donated by the
club.

No easy answer
WE asked about nefarious behaviour in the world of the pub quiz. The
answer is that no-one can be nefariouser than a publican who has filled
his bar with contestants and filled his till with their money but does
not want to pay up when it comes to prize time.
The scene for this tale, related by a colleague, is a bar in the Costa
Brava resort of Estartit. (Great location for a quiz, as in ''I've
startit so I'll finish.)
The owner of the bar, a Scotsman whom we will Tony for the sake of
argument, offers bottles of whisky and brandy on quiz nights with a
special prize of #100 for the most difficult question of the night.
The teaser on the night in question was ''Which team at the 1988 Seoul
Olympics consisted of only one athlete?'' Our chum immediately phoned
Scotland to Doug Gillon, The Herald's athletics chap, and quickly
established that the answer is South Yemen.
''Wrong!'' said Tony, the mine host, when the answer was proffered.
There was little room for argument since quiz contestants can't exactly
announce that they have just been on the phone to an expert to check the
answer.
Subsequent inquiries into the history of the #100 question revealed
that it is rarely if ever awarded. Ther mine host specialises in
questions with no answers. For instance, if Clint Eastwwood had made
five spaghetti westerns, Tony would say he had made six, read out the
names, and ask the contestants to name the sixth.
We got into this subject after reading the new book How to Win Any Pub
Quiz by John Smith which is at once a reference book and a philosopher's
guide to the warped mind of the average pub quiz question-setter.
Today's bits of useless information which might come in handy one quiz
night: linonophobia is a fear of string and the collective noun for
moles is a labour or a movement.

THIS could well be the week that people look back on as a turning
point in our politics, a few days during which the final obstacles to a
Scottish parliament were removed.
Where it all leads is another matter, of course. Labour has to win a
General Election, an undoubted Tory rearguard fight would then have to
be overcome, and the parliament in Edinburgh would begin its life with
some members committed to its abolition and others determined to turn it
into a different, stronger beast entirely.
Still, it all looks that bit closer this week. It opened with Labour
Leader Tony Blair dismissing as ''total and absolute drivel'' the
suggestion that he wanted to dilute his party's commitment to devolution
or to interfere in the Scottish Constitutional Convention negotiations.
Then, on cue, these negotiations between Labour and the Liberal
Democrats broke through the final deadlock over the number of members
the parliament should have, settling on the compromise figure of 129
MSPs.
It is understood a final wording is also imminent on legal
entrenchment, which would state that the Act creating the parliament
could not be amended without the agreement of the parliament itself and
could not be repealed by Westminster without both the agreement of the
parliament and a referendum of the Scottish people.
These agreements have been reached with perfect timing as politics
returns from its holidays and we prepare for the autumn conference
season. The fact that at last we have a clear picture of what the
proposed devolved parliament will be like means that the issue is now
bound to dominate political debate in Scotland.
During the long run-in to the next General Election the plans will be
lambasted by the Tories, belittled by the SNP, and defended by Labour
and the Liberal Democrats.
Indeed, this is already in full swing. Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth is promising ''real devolution'' to local government, which
means removing the handcuffs his Government slapped on in the first
place. He also moved on from his ''Tartan Tax'' mantra to speak
yesterday of the parliament as a retirement home for former regional
councillors.
How will the electorate respond to this? A clear majority of Scots
want a parliament to legislate for domestic affairs and the danger for
Mr Forsyth is that in ridiculing that aspiration he will simply alienate
them further. Stuck at 12% in our monthly poll, he needs to put on
several percentage points by next spring if there is to be any chance of
hanging on to existing Tory seats, not least his own.
For their part, the SNP are boxing cleverly at present. Alex Salmond
will scoff at the weakness of what he insists on calling an assembly but
his party will adopt a pragmatic middle way, neither supporting it nor
adopting a fundamentalist line of rejecting it. Calton Hill is a slope
and the SNP aim will be to make it a slippery one towards independence.
At 26% in our poll, exactly half Labour's rating, the SNP hope a
successful conference and their dual ''head and heart'' autumn campaign
(a hard economic case coupled with the emotional cash-in on Braveheart)
can reduce that gap to the 16 points which separated them from Labour at
one point last year.
The Liberal Democrats' role in the convention negotiations has been an
honourable one. In bed with an elephant, to coin a phrase from a
different context, they have done well to steal some of the covers.
The deal done for a 129-member parliament is, they believe, in the
''safe zone'' of proportionality, and their deal on gender equality
steered a pragmatic course between doctrine and aspiration.
The danger is, however, that their achievement in influencing a
Scottish parliament for the better may be too subtle to bring electoral
reward and their slippage to 8% in our poll was a disappointment on the
eve of their federal conference coming to Glasgow.
Although Labour have slipped five points in two months, they
considered this a good week for them. Renfrewshire shennanigans, fights
with the trade unions, the left's continuing distrust of Tony Blair, and
the latter's alleged wobbles on devolution could all have cost them
more, and they believe that the wobbles have been laid to rest.
What they need now is a Brighton conference that doesn't leave blood
on the walls, and a long, slow sell of their Home Rule plans. Any slips,
however, and ambushes await.

<HEADLINE>NFUS seeks parity on Scottish beef premium</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>21</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976486609</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE National Farmers' Union of Scotland is pressing the Scottish
Office to keep advance payments of Beef Special Premium in Scotland as
close as possible to the level achieved by the Ministry of Agriculture
for producers in England.
The union's concern centres on the possibility that the Scottish
Office agriculture department could opt for an advance payment of 60% of
the total due, rather than the 80% predicted south of the Border.
In money terms that could mean English farmers getting a payment of
#68.65 per eligible animal, while their Scottish counterparts get about
#15 less.
The fears of the Scottish Office sticking to the 60% level -- which
until this year was the norm for advance payments -- arise because the
premium payments are subject to a ceiling.
The Scottish herd for BSP purposes is capped at 244,000 head -- a
figure which the industry argues is too small, given Scotland's
pre-eminence as a livestock producer. The England and Wales herd size is
fixed at 930,000 head, which is much nearer the actual position on the
ground.
Last year the ''overshoot'' in Scotland was more than 20% and a
recurrence could result in an overpayment, if an advance payment of 80%
had already been made. In England and Wales, applications for BSP are
expected to be within the set limits, and the Ministry isconfident about
making an 80% payment without fear of a possible scale-back.
Richard Henton, livestock commodity director with the NFUS, said
yesterday: ''We have told the Scottish Office that we are very concerned
at the prospect that we could get a payment less than the 80% everyone
else in Britain will be getting. If they cannot manage an 80% payment
for us we must get 75%, or as near that as possible.''
The base figure of 244,000 head which had been set for Scotland was
unfair, he said. ''We would like a re-assessment of that regional
reference herd total, but we are not having much success in convincing
the Scottish Office or the Ministry of Agriculture.
''We have taken it to Brussels but Brussels say it is a UK problem how
we divide the figures up between Scotland and England and Wales. If we
are going to get more, someone else will have to get less,'' he added.
''We are still applying pressure to the Scottish Office and we should
get a better idea of what the position is in a month's time. They have
not said that it definitely will be a 60% advance payment and they seem
to be adopting a resonably open position. ''
A spokesman for the Scottish Office agriculture department said
officials were monitoring the claims lodged. By the end of the month
they hoped to be in a position to make a decision on the level at which
advance payments should be pitched.

ENTERPRISE Oil put in a profits spurt to #101.7m in the six months to
June 30 from #36m before tax in the corresponding period last year,
thanks to a leap in its oil and gas production.
The group lifted the amount of oil and gas produced by 17% to a record
201,700 barrels a day in the six-month period.
The increase in direct production was largely attributable to the
Enterprise-operated Nelson field, on stream in February. However, there
were also higher contributions from the Beryl and Leman fields in the
UK.
The interim dividend stays at 6.5p from earnings per share of 8.2p,
compared with 0.1p previously.

BINGO is expected to become increasingly important to Rank, the
leisure group, whose other interests include the Odeon cinema chain and
Butlins holiday camps.
The company continues to press for deregulation which would allow its
bingo clubs to advertise.
Even without advertising bingo is big business for Rank, which owns
around 160 clubs with annual admissions of around 35 million. It is keen
to expand its Spanish bingo operations because the game enjoys huge
popularity in Spain. Despite competition from the National Lottery,
which hit its gaming and bingo operations, Rank reported a 13% increase
in interim pre-tax profits before exceptional items to #162.9m.
The interim dividend is raised by 12% to 4.75p. Rank is changing its
year-end from October 31 to December 31, and so the results cover the
eight-month period to July 1.

THE #101m Murray Ventures has increased its exposure to unlisted
investments to more than 70%, the highest in the investment trust's
history.
Glasgow-based Murray Johnstone, which manages the trust, has expanded
its regional network of offices. This has given the investment house an
increased market share in management buy-outs at a time when management
teams at smaller companies have been showing increased confidence in
planning and investing.
During its year to July 31, Murray Ventures invested #28.3m into new
unlisted situations. By the end of the financial year unlisteds
accounted for 64% of net assets against 49% a year earlier. Further
acquisitions have taken this to a record level.
Net asset value increased by 9.8% to 408.3p. Total return was 13.8%,
slightly less than the All-Share index's 14.8%. But with the discount on
the shares narrowing the total share price return was 17.9%.
A final dividend of 8.4p will raise the total by 4.3% to 12p.
The trust's performance has been restrained by the substantial
increase in unlisteds. These are held at no more than cost for at least
a year unless a material third party price is established. Murray
Ventures' new unlisteds included Mining (Scotland).

THE leading UK oil and gas construction and maintenance company OGC
International yesterday announced interim results for the first six
months of this year which show pre-tax profits up by 29% to #7.5m,
writes GRAEME SMITH.
Chairman Mr Richard Wilson said the results, following turnover and
profits in 1994 which exceeded expectations, were a tribute to the
performance of AOC International, OGC's principal operating subsidiary.
The results show turnover up 11% to #127.1m from #114.1m during the
first half of 1994 mainly as a result of higher construction activity
offshore and onshore UK.
An interim dividend of 2p per share will be paid representing a 9%
increase compared to last year's interim dividend.
Mr Wilson said the results had benefited from major work on the Brent
Field redevelopment project in the UK and from completion of the Goodwyn
'A' hook-up in Australia. But he added: ''We are still experiencing
difficulties in Norway and efforts continue to turn the situation
around.''
Among new contracts awarded to AOC in the UK are the Armada hook-up
for British Gas and the Erskine hook-up for Texaco, with preliminary
work beginning immediately and the offshore phase scheduled to be
carried out in 1997 in both cases.
He said the company was also expecting the award of a five-year
contract for the provision of operations and maintenance personnel by a
major North Sea operator.
''During the first half of the year another milestone achieved was the
formation of the jointly owned company Brown &amp; Root AOC Limited to take
over the business of the existing joint venture arrangement, indicating
our commitment to its further development.
''The joint company has already progressed strongly in 1995 and its
workforce is currently 1400. A number of contracts are in progress with
the Birch Field tie back to the Brae 'A' platform for Marathon Oil UK
having performed particularly well and further contracts are in the
pipeline.''

RAILTRACK's first-year pre-tax profit of #189m announced this week, is
a clear indication that the company, which took over British Rail's
track and signalling system as part of the process leading to
privatisation, is making progress. City analysts welcomed the figures
yesterday, the first they have seen since the company was set up,
because they provide some indication of how it operates.
Railtrack is the only element of the proposed new structure which will
emerge with a stock market float and they would like to know more. These
figures, however, are something to be going on with.
In spite of everything, the Government has still not backed down from
the privatisation timetable which will see Railtrack up for grabs in the
first quarter of next year, probably March, with 51% of the passenger
network privatised by April.
The City view is that the Government would be better advised to let
Railtrack carry on as it is and set about establishing the franchise
system first, which was their original plan. The aim had been to ensure
the operating companies had proved themselves before Railtrack was sold
off, possibly around the year 2000. That timetable was repeatedly
revised and it is the revisions which have hit snags.
The first private sector bids for three train-operating companies --
Great Western, South West Trains and London, Tilbury and Southend --
were described this week in a leaked document by the franchising
director as variable in quality and showing an immature understanding of
the business.
In addition, the sale of the flagship line, the Inter City West Coast
Line, the most heavily used in the country, has had to be postponed
because of the potential investors' concern about the cost of
modernisation. That is reckoned at around #1700m and they were worried
about the Government's commitment to upgrade track, signalling and
rolling stock.
Note of the franchises has to be taken by the City (who gets them,
what they are sold for, how they will work) because the whole system
interconnects; the success of one depending on, or having implications
for, the other.
The results gave some ''feel'' for the breakdown of the profit and
loss account, it was said yesterday. They also provided some
''relatively useful insights'' into the asset side of the balance sheet,
and it was now known what accounting policies Railtrack were operating.
In particular, more about the maintenance charge levied on the operating
companies, a complex issue, had been made clear.
What is still not known is what the capital structure of the business
is going to be, which leaves analysts, one said, ''well adrift from
where they need to be'' when it comes to putting a valuation on
Railtrack.
At this stage, their view is Railtrack should attract the same rating
as a public utility stock rather than a BAA-type transport stock. They
consider there is no justification for putting Railtrack on a BAA-type
rating and the comparison is a false one. Since 90% of Railtrack's
access charges are fixed, its turnover is likely to be relatively
unresponsive to improvement in demand.
Because its income will be known for the next six years, it is
possible to make a reasonable guess at the operating cash flow. The
problem is that the growth element will have to come from cost cutting.
On top of that, Railtrack will have to invest considerably in
infrastructure. The analysts argue that costs will not be as easy to cut
as some people might hope.
In other words, although you still get a respectable cash flow, unless
Railtrack attracts a utility stock type rating things are very much up
in the air. They will not come down to earth again until the Government
publishes fuller details closer to the flotation date.
At this stage, given there are no indications of the numbers, and no
indication as to the creditor side of the balance sheet, there is no way
any analyst could advise people whether to buy the stock. It will be
necessary to wait until nearer next March.
What does seem inescapable is that the scale of subsidies to the
franchise operators will have to be bigger than expected. What is not
known, because the figures are being massaged, is how Railtrack and the
shadow companies are financing the current operations.

MANWEB yesterday questioned the profitability of ScottishPower's
generating activities and the wisdom of its predator's diversification
into non-core areas such as gas and telecommunications.
But its attempt to undermine confidence in ScottishPower shares and
de-rail the Glasgow-based company's hostile #1000m takeover bid appeared
futile.
ScottishPower surged a further 14p to 367p, taking the value of its
shares-plus-cash offer for Manweb above the #10 mark to 1010p.
City analysts said ScottishPower was still undervalued, despite its
steady appreciation in recent weeks. Andrew Wright of Smith New Court
reckoned that fair value for ScottishPower was about 400p.
A climb to that level would boost the value of its offer for Manweb to
1047p per share.
Manweb climbed 11p to 1000p after the Chester-based power company
issued its second defence salvo in the takeover battle, but this still
fell short of the current value of ScottishPower's offer.
Manweb said in a document circulated to shareholders that
ScottishPower only achieved a return of 14.2% on power sales last year,
compared to returns of more than 20% by Scottish Hydro-Electric,
PowerGen and National Power.
And it said there was a heavy risk that ScottishPower would be hit by
falling prices for its power exports to England.
Looking ahead, Manweb warned that pollution control regulations may
force ScottishPower to spend #200m on reducing the sulphur content of
emmissions from its power stations.
Finally, it accused ScottishPower of frittering away investment on
marginal and highly competitive activities such as electrical retailing,
gas supply and telecommunications.
''These uncertainties increase the risk of any investment in the
ScottishPower shares being offered to Manweb shareholders,'' said Manweb
chief executive John Roberts.
''By contrast, Manweb can deliver further value to its own
shareholders through efficiency gains, and because of our balance sheet
through a package of financial benefits,'' he added.
But ScottishPower chairman Murray Stuart dismissed the Manweb document
as ''superficial''. ''It is a weak attempt to divert attention from
Manweb's own limited potential as a small REC with high distribution
costs,'' he said.
In its first defence document on August 25, Manweb accused
ScottishPower of undervaluing it and promised a package of benefits to
loyal shareholders. Its final document, which must be issued by
September 15, will detail this package.
Manweb has been telling brokers privately that it can make #25m of
extra cost savings over the next two years by bringing forward
redundancies and using the cash released to enhance dividend payments in
1996 and 1997.
The company has already promised publicly to distribute its
entitlement to shares in the national grid to shareholders, and
privately it has talked of valuing these shares at 177p each.
Analysts were dismissive of the latest Manweb document, but some
thought ScottishPower would have to improve its offer, worth only 946p
when it was launched on July 24, in order to clinch the deal.
ScottishPower's cash-only alternative of 915p now lags way behind the
value of its main offer.

YESTERDAY'S plethora of blue-chip companies reporting their results,
ranging from the good, to the bad, to the indifferent, proved difficult
for the market to digest, and the FTSE-100 finally closed down 12.1 at
3545.6 after its recent surge.
But this time the blame could not be pinned on industrial conglomerate
BTR which, at the same time last year, shook the stock market and share
prices generally when it warned of first-half margins under pressure
from higher raw material costs.
Red pencilling proved to be an over-reaction as there was a recovery
in the second half and BTR is able to point to an advance in first-half
operating profit margins in the continuing businesses from 15.6% to
16.4%.
It still lost 6[1/2]p to 325[1/2]p, but this merely reflected profits
perhaps a shade below best expectations at #729m before tax, up 5%.
Excluding disposal profits and a #21m provision for integrating the
Formica acquisition, underlying profits grew by 16.5%.
Shareholders are to receive a 6.5% boost to the interim dividend to
5.54p on earnings per share, which have risen 18.6% to 11.5p. As in
1994, it will be paid as a foreign income dividend, incorporating the
recovery of Advance Corporation Tax.
BTR is not without its problems -- scarcely surprising given the
geographic spread and scope of its activities.
Growth in some businesses is slowing -- in particular the automotive
industry in the US and the construction sector in Australia.
But most of the company's product groups in these countries have
reported first-half profits well in excess of 1994. At home, the
automotive, industrial manufacturing and construction sectors have
improved over last year, but order activity remains slow in rail and
sparodic in electric power.
Overall, shareholders will take comfort from chief executive Alan
Jackson's forecast that recognising the current global economic outlook
and the competitive trading environment, BTR's view is that 1995 will
continue to see another increase in sales and profits.
Some analysts may have trimmed their full-year forecasts slightly, but
the company is still regarded as sound for the medium term, with
underlying sales growth accelerating and capital expenditure rising.
The market greeted the first-half profits of Blue Circle Industries,
Britain's biggest cement manufacturer, by slicing 12p off the share
price to 322p. Pre-tax profits of #104.1m, up 18%, compared with market
projections of around #105m, are almost spot on.
The interim dividend is increased 7%, from 3.75p to 4p. All parts made
encouraging progress in the period, with the exception of heating. But
the second half is likely to prove tougher in the face of continuing
difficult trading conditions for heating and, perhaps more importantly,
uncertain prospects for UK cement demand.
Blue Circle does, though, expect a strong performance from its US
cement and aggregates business to help offset the impact of weak
European demand.
Surprisingly in the circumstances, it also expects to see early-year
price rises for UK cement, despite likely falls in demand.
For the year as a whole, cement volumes are unlikely to diverge from
the 2% drop in output predicted by the whole of the UK construction
industry. Blue Circle's confidence that price rises can be imposed
against a background of softening demand remains to be tested.
As a contrast to industrial companies, Sun Alliance -- the composite
insurance group -- could scarcely be more different, though it does
insure bricks and mortar.
It differed in another respect, too, in that the share price firmed 8p
to 359p on six months operating profits, which advanced from #180m to
#259m.
It is the highest level of interim profit ever achieved in real terms
by the company, with improvements in all major business sectors.
Underwriting was particularly strong in the UK, and there were also
significant improvements overseas -- notably in Europe and the US.
The underwriting cycle generally is in fact going down with premiums
falling, but in the UK, where underwriting profits were achieved in each
operating division, Sun Alliance benefited from a favourable claims
experience, which offset the increasingly competitive rating
environment.
Whether rates will start to harden again later this year or early next
year, as some in the industry believe, is a moot point. Meantime, the
fall in the level of claims is a real bonus, which may not last.

WHO ever thought that Babycham was invented? Babycham, the sparklng
champagne perry (how it ever got away with calling this pear-juice
champagne is beyond me. You can't even sell a dashed decent sparkling
vino of considerable repute unless it actually comes from the champagne
district in France itself).
As it happens I dislike champagne. I don't like the bubbles for a
start. Anybody who suffers from hayfever will understand that. One's a
wish, two's a kiss, three's a disappointment. That's a rhyme for
sneezing, and aerated waters make you gezhundheit for hours.
Also, to my mind, champagne, especially the very expensive stuff,
always smells to me like meat. It has the aroma of Lorne sausage, and
the after-taste of the brains of new-born babies. (Check out Baudelaire
for that reference.) But one thing is certain: an aesthete such as wur
Parisian perv would have been hard put to rattle down a Babycham.
But invented Babycham most certainly was. By a chap called Francis
Showering who, along with his four brothers, launched his appalling
bottle of booze back in the early 1950s, and it was the first drink to
be produced specifically with women in mind.
It was a cute campaign. It had an even cuter little logo, a little
fawn, a wee deer, a Bambi which made girls go ''ooh'', and has since
sold more than four billion little bottles. The product had a strongly
visual ad campaign with lots of little dessert glasses with the Bambi on
them in pink and pale blue colours.
The fact that a real champagne glass is tulip-shaped to ensure that
the bubbles are enclosed didn't stop the majority of ordinary people,
and especially ladies, from imagining that this daft glass was the
official champagne one. Even to this day continental restaurateurs and
publicans know that lumpen ladies insist on a glass for their Babycham
which resembles fingerbowls. But Babycham knew its market. It kicked off
in Shepton Mallet in 1952, and was an immediate success.
Today we have new alcohol-based lemonades for heaven's sake. There is
even a lemonade with attitude called Hooch, which is itself quite (sic)
clear. Do not listen to those idjits who will tell you how iniquitous
such mineral waters are and how the young will be attracted to them and
store up future bouts of societal alcoholism.
No sensible publican serves, knowingly, an under-age drinker, and no
off-licence proprieter either. In fact, should a young-looking customer
enter either type of premises and ask for an alcoholic lemonade he or
she would be likely to be subjected to extra scrutiny. But more than
that, the original lassies' drink, Babycham, is stronger than many of
the new lemonades and other fruit-fermented drinks.
Babycham contains 6% alcohol volume, more than, say, a bottle of Becks
beer. It is less than the average wine, but comes in a larger measure.
For myself, I think it is quite vile: would weld your teeth together
first thing in the morning when you wake up and put a head on you enough
to demand electric convulsive therapy to put you out of your misery.
But Mr Showering, who died the other day, aged 83, eventually sold his
business for 108 million quid which just goes to show how many women
have no taste in alcohol, and how many men found Babycham a most
effective leg-opener. The lassies didn't realise they were getting
softened up. After all, a wee lemonade in a flat glass with a fawn
leaping around it couldn't possibly end up with a bibulous carnality,
could it?
The secret to Babycham's success was, of course, the simple fact that
few ladies drink, or certainly not in pubs. When I was a child there
were few pubs which allowed women on the premises at all, and few lounge
bars. Upper-class women drank like fish, of course, in smart hotels and
nightclubs, in South Kent roadhouses, in private.
Most women who drank among the lower orders did so either in secret or
in low dives. I recollect my own mother, as late as the 1970s, waiting
outside the Horsehoe Bar in Glasgow's Drury Street, for a
respectable-looking chap to turn up just so that she could ask him to
tell my father that she was waiting outside. ''He's a small man with a
clipped moustache, and wearing a pearl-grey trilby,'' she would say. She
would never have dreamed of going into a man's pub.
My father would finish his half and take her off to The Scandinavian
Centre, or The Ceylon Tea place, or sometimes a discreet
women-orientated lounge bar.
Today's weemenfolk are not averse to shoving down pints and bottles by
the neck while standing outside the gent's in a rough pub in Oatlands.
Babycham itself is rarely taken as a straight drink in a bijou glass: it
usually gets shoved into a half of cider, which surely must mean more
leg-opening at that. Lassies don't need wee deer cavorting about when
enough men are these days, and quite right too.
What the girls are unlikely to respond to, however, is the new whisky
campaigns to which my colleague Ian Bell referred yesterday. Whisky
companies have been trying for years to push the most wonderful liquor
of them all to younger people and to women.
They will never succeed and I can tell them that now. Whisky is for
the older and more mature (some say ruined), palate. Anyway I cannot
abide the notion of whisky with lemonade or Coke or Canadian Dry. Or
ice. It could be worse, It could be Babycham, in a silly glass. And
Bambi in your horrors.

I AM haunted and daunted by the task Tilda Swinton has set herself.
Lots of us find it hard to settle in a strange bed, unless drugged or
drunk, and almost impossible to sleep in public -- in hospital ward or
continental couchette or intercontinental plane. But this week the
actress snuggled down for a run of high-visibility naps, playing Snow
White in her glass coffin at London's Serpentine Gallery: sleeping in a
display case for an exhibition ''about mortality'' called The Maybe.
No prince is on hand to wake Tilda with a kiss from her eight-hour
shifts of slumber; merely a frog of an art critic, the acidulous Brian
Sewell, who has described the actress and her artist collaborator,
Cornelia Parker, as ''two inadequately educated women'' who have mounted
''a feeble and utterly self-indulgent performance.''
Brian Sewell always makes me laugh. He is a clever man who has found a
niche market for his brand of elite populism, or populist elitism, and
his talent for critical invective is much in demand by the BBC and the
Daily Mail. Sewell's is the educated voice of the culturally
gob-smacked; art historian as much as critic, he leads the charge
against formaldehyde sheep and toilet-roll sculptures from the top of
the Clapham omnibus. He is the man who, with the authority of the
expert, urges the bemused bystander to resist the more absurd excesses
of experimental or performance art.
Tilda's Serpentine sleep-in he calls performance without art.
''Showing it in an art gallery doesn't make it art . . . she is, in
fact, of no more interest than any woman snoozing in the sun outside the
gallery.'' Which judgment poses another question: is the actress
snoozing, or is she acting snoozing? And if she's acting snoozing rather
than snoozing, does her performance work even at the level of
interpretive art?
Snow White in her glass coffin, a ''silent, breathing effigy'', too
gracefully composed, too perfectly reposed for natural sleep which, over
eight hours, is untidy, energetic, and frequently noisy. According to
eye-witnesses the effigy turns over every few hours and occasionally
pours herself a glass of water; whereas scientists from the sleep
laboratories insist we're all the most frightful fidgets in the arms of
Morpheus, and change position 47.03 times (or some such figure) in the
space of a night.
With or without the complaints of partners, with or without the chance
to observe children, we've all got some idea of what we're like when
we're asleep. We sense our own restlessness; sometimes we even sense the
vibrations of our uvula, soft palate, or vocal chords and waken briefly
to turn on our side. And unless Tilda Swinton throws in a spot of
snuffling, sighing, muttering, and teeth-grinding, not to mention a
sudden fit of scratching at damp and secret parts, she will convince
no-one. Not even children sleep like babies for hours on end, as anyone
who has ever been bruised by the rotor blades of toddler limbs can
testify.
When it comes to art I, too, am ''inadequately educated''; not
necessarily because I went to the same school as Tilda Swinton (although
before her time), but because my reactions to the work exhibited in the
great European galleries and churches are informed only by the most
surface and incomplete knowledge of its tradition and context.
Does this matter? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. In my experience no
work of art has ever been improved or diminished by its reputation, or
my knowledge of its reputation. (The Three Graces? Kinda cute kitsch.)
Some have disappointed, some have exhilarated, some have puzzled, and
some -- when I have taken the trouble to bone up on their background --
have repaid the effort.
But in my under-educated, ad hoc cruising of the cultural institutions
of Paris, Florence, Amsterdam, Milan, Venice, and Rome, not to mention
our domestic galleries, I've reached the belief -- which I suppose puts
me in the Sewell camp -- that art is about more than novel ideas. The
bright idea, the revelationary insight, the personal vision, the daring
experiment are only as rewarding as their execution. All art, in a
sense, is performance art; we want the artist to show us something we
couldn't do ourselves.
We couldn't look at light like Pisarro and paint it on the wing;
chisel marble like Bernini or cast bronzes like Eduardo Paolozzi;
redefine the human body like Pablo Picasso or even catch the likeness of
a sitter's face like Henry Raeburn. We want our artists -- and here I
recklessly speak for the woman who ''knows what she likes'' -- to show
us rare craftsmanship as much as we want them to illuminate universal
truths or challenge old orthodoxies. We may find the Mona Lisa dull and
the Moses musclebound, but we know that in their execution is a genius
which is physical as much as imaginative.
There aren't all that many authentic philistines around. Given the
chance and the exposure most of us find something of value in literature
or music or the visual arts, but the world of high culture holds two
terrors for the insecure and the pretentious: the mystery of the
avant-garde and the status of the giant reputation.
The avant-garde is slightly easier to handle because its reputation is
still cooking, but those of us who passingly admire a display of Sevres
porcelain in its cabinet find it hard to imagine that this chilly china
genuinely excites some people. This is the problem for the educated
(even the inadequately educated) cultural consumer; it's assumed you buy
the whole package. If, for example, you value the prose of Gustave
Flaubert you are also supposed to cherish the music of Johann Sebastian
Bach.
Well, I do and I don't. I do value Flaubert and I don't cherish Bach.
My feelings about Bach's harpsichord music came to a head one night in
bed (perhaps Tilda Swinton will have similar revelations) when my
husband was listening to Radio 3 and I was trying to read. Out of
sudden, visceral impatience with the background noise I found myself
complaining, ''Must we listen to this boring, repetitious jangling?''
This is a remark he enjoys repeating to every musically literate
person we meet. But I don't retract, and anyway do I care? This is the
man who took one look at the scenes from Genesis in the Sistine Chapel
and judged them ''crap''. Adding, ''What made him paint them on the
ceiling anyway? You can't get a good look at them without hurting your
neck.''

CALA, the quality house builder, has weathered a tough year
surprisingly well, cushioned by land sales and its first profits from an
Edinburgh office development.
Pre-tax profits more than doubled to #6.9m from #3.4m in the year to
June 30, but this was mainly due to a #2.8m profit on the sale of
development land and a #500,000 profit on the Exchange Plaza office
development in Edinburgh's Lothian Road.
Turnover rose 9% to #87.4m as Cala sold more houses in Scotland and
kept sales in England at 1994 levels and the dividend was increased 14%
to 3.2p.
But the prospect of further declines in land and house prices prompted
Cala shares to fall 6p to 112p
Chairman Geoffrey Ball said Cala planned to build cheaper homes in
Scotland this year, but in England it would go up market. As a result,
the average price of a Cala house in both countries would approach
#130,000.
Cala's Scottish houses sold for an average #139,000 last year, whereas
its English homes only fetched #113,000.
Cala expects the housing market to remain tough in the current year,
despite the recent easing of mortgage rates and it warned that land
prices could fall, endangering the value of its #49m land bank.
But Mr Ball said the company hopes to maintain profits with the help
of further sales of development land acquired under option and further
profits from Exchange Plaza.
''I shall be disappointed if we do not do equally as well in the
current year,'' he said.

Julia Langdon finds hidden delights behind the self-serving rhetoric
in Bryan Gould's account of his time as a Labour politician
WELL, what a lucky escape, and for everyone really: for the author,
who has safely high-tailed it back to New Zealand; for a Labour Party
which Bryan Gould judges unfit to have him as its leader; and for the
poor electorate who appear to have narrowly missed the danger of being
ruled by a Labour Government peopled by a bunch of autocratic,
manipulative, scheming know-nothings.
That, in any case, is the picture which Gould presents in the latter
half of his book*. Here is the Labour Party in Opposition during the
years of Neil Kinnock's leadership, thrashing hopelessly around in
pursuit, it seems, of individual advancement at the expense of any kind
of credible electoral strategy.
It is, in many ways, a dreadful book. It is badly written, banal,
displays an astonishing personal arrogance -- and yet still manages to
be absolutely fascinating. The trouble is that first you have to scythe
through the undergrowth of the author's self-serving rhetoric.
This came as an immense surprise. It is not very often that one reads
a book by someone you know quite well and end up feeling entirely
differently about him or her. The thing about Bryan Gould is that he is
very clever, not just in the realms of academic excellence, but he is
also ''cute'' in the Irish sense: smart and streetwise and with a nose
that can sniff what is on the political wind.
Or so I always thought. I interviewed him first in the early 1970s
when he was a young, enthusiastic and ambitious parliamentary candidate
who knew what a story was and how to present it to the press. He was
impressive then and he continued to be so. The fact that he rose as he
did within the Labour Party was not in the least surprising.
And particularly not, it turns out, to one B Gould. He records his
successes and his strengths and his skills and his mastery of each
episode in his brilliant life (schooldays; Rhodes' Scholarship;
diplomacy; teaching; politics; broadcasting . . .) apparently completely
unaware of the tiresome repetition or the self-satisfaction he conveys.
How about this for an example, after Labour's election defeat in 1987:
''I had emerged from the campaign as, after Neil, pretty well the most
prominent Labour politician in the country -- as witness the fact that
my puppet featured occasionally on Spitting Image. It took me some
little time to understand my new high profile and to come to terms with
the truly remarkable extent of media interest in all that I did and
said.''
Really?
There is another aspect to this, too, and that is that Gould has,
again astonishingly, revealed himself as a worthy Pooter for the
unconsciously hilarious account he gives of the times and trials of an
upwardly mobile colonial politician in British Labour politics in the
late-twentieth century.
He records, for example, that for his 43rd birthday, soon after his
selection for his second parliamentary seat, Dagenham, his mother-in-law
gave him a five-year diary. He explains for the benefit of those of us
who have never heard of such a thing that it allowed just a few lines
for each day of the year.
He writes: ''I have kept such a diary every day since. It records no
great political perceptions but it jogs the memory as to what happened
from day to day. Thus, the entry for 13th February, 1982 reads, 'Went
into Henley with Gill -- bought a present for her mother and some shoes
for me -- watched Grandstand -- Booths came for supper, with a bottle of
champagne to add to our own -- celebrated Dagenham, my 43rd etc -- very
agreeable'.''
Perhaps it is that being a New Zealander, Bryan Gould never really did
understand either the potential for ridicule that his book has so
unwittingly provided for a British readership or, more importantly, the
British Labour Party.
I am quite sure that the book will go down very well in New Zealand
which gets a mention every few pages. But he will be laughed to derision
by the Labour Party he endeavoured.
He conveys a rather hurt feeling that the Labour Party misunderstood
him -- although there is also an intellectual arrogance visible here,
too -- but it appears now to be rather the other way round.
It is the second half of the book which makes it worth stumbling
through, however. There is an image here of the Shadow Cabinet corridor
during the last years of the ''old'' regime which we have not seen
before.
We may have suspected the autocratic manner in which Neil Kinnock
sometimes behaved, seen something of the paranoia that was widespread
about the press, or sensed the extent to which Peter Mandelson contrived
and connived in order to further his causes. It has not been set down
like this before and there is interesting material to be found.
So we do have cause after all to be grateful to Gould for writing this
account.
Next time he feels the urge to display his indisputable excellence in
this field, as in any other, for goodness sake let us hope that he
decides to publish his unexpurgated diaries and give us all a good
laugh.

Bryan Gould tells Benedict Brogan about life after Labour, and
delivers a broadside at Tony Blair's rejuvenated party
BRYAN GOULD spent more than half his life in Britain. Academic
distinction won him access to the inner temples of the Establishment --
Oxford, the Foreign Office, Westminster -- and he rose to become a
senior figure in the Labour Party. But he failed in his ambition to
succeed Neil Kinnock as leader in 1992. Last year, faced with the
prospect of life on the fringes as an increasingly irrelevant radical
preaching against Labour's right-wards drift, he gave up and returned to
his native New Zealand.
That, in a nutshell, is the life and career -- so far -- of a man
described variously as an outsider and a former future Prime Minister.
He has just published his political memoirs, appropriately entitled
Goodbye To All That, at a time when the British media is on the lookout
for any sign of backbiting in Tony Blair's so far disciplined New Labour
party.
Last month they thought they had it, in spades. The London Evening
Standard published, under Gould's name, an attack on Blair and Labour
which had the Tories shouting with glee. Except that it had, in fact,
been written by a 19-year-old called Nick Howard who turned out, irony
of ironies, to be the son of Home Secretary Michael Howard.
The Standard was humiliated by the mistake and handed Gould a cheque
for substantial damages. He is still laughing about it when we meet in
his hotel lobby. The uproar has proved to be a publicist's dream.
He wears a dark suit and carries a ministerial-looking red folder with
his initials embossed in the lower corner. He is now vice-chancellor of
the University of Waikato in New Zealand, a recent foundation with
12,000 students. The post is not the ceremonial doddle it might sound.
He is its chief executive, and explains the exhilaration of making
executive decisions for the first time in his career (some small
compensation for never having held a ministerial post, I suggest). He
anticipates the question he is asked most often: he loves being back in
New Zealand, but at 56 has no plans to enter its politics.
Bryan Gould will always be identified with the anti-European wing of
the Labour Party. He campaigned against entry into the Common Market,
and it is this long-standing association, at a time when Labour has
embraced Europe, which Gould claims earned him enemies and hampered his
career.
Even now Europe, as an economic issue, remains at the centre of his
concern as a symbol of the loss of sovereignty that is, in his eyes,
destroying British politics and Britain's economy. And as an issue it is
bound to split a Labour government, he adds.
He is not, he insists, and never has been, a Little Englander. His
opposition to the European Union is strictly based on his interpretation
of the economics of the thing. ''If you look at an economy such as that
of Europe -- if one can conceive of an economy called the European
economy -- it is so immensely diverse, so disparate, that it's almost
impossible to believe that a single monetary policy could conceivably
serve the interests of every bit of that European economy,'' he says.
A unified economy will tend to benefit its profitable areas and
neglect those that aren't. The result is unemployment in those sectors
that can't compete with the outside world, and a gradual lowering of
standards for everyone else. ''This is nothing to do with nationalism or
being opposed to Europe. It's just straightforward sensible economics.''
Economics, in fact, is one of his principal preoccupations. In an age
when the Labour Party has become more monetarist than Milton Friedman,
Gould remains resolutely a Keynesian, opposed to the free hand of
unaccountable markets and a firm believer in using the state to
stimulate demand and protect against unemployment. Unlike the current
Labour leadership, he has never accepted the Thatcherite orthodoxy that
says there is no such thing as ''a little inflation''.
The collapse of the Exchange Rate Mechanism in September 1992 was a
foreseeable disaster, he says. ''All I'm saying is that the notion that
there is a simple way of controlling inflation, by aligning the currency
to Germany's and importing German monetary policy as a result, is wrong.
If there is a simple answer to inflation we would have found it long
ago.''
Unsuprisingly then, he is opposed to the creation of an independent
Bank of England. Handing control of monetary policy to an unelected
governor is fundamentally dangerous, and doesn't work. It takes one of
the great levers of economic policy -- a Keynesian metaphor, if there
ever was one -- out of the hands of the elected politicians. Here he
suggests that recent economic figures and last week's unexpected cut in
mortgage rates led by Abbey National have proved how right elected
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke had been to resist pressure from unelected
Eddie George to push interest rates up.
Gould's own analysis of New Labour requires no help from Nick Howard.
He argues the party has sold out by accepting that the management of
Britain's economy can be left to the markets. It has found inspiration
in the Clinton administration, which sells itself as a nicer set of
people -- nicer but safe. And it has signed up to the anti-inflationary
orthodoxy of the right, which prevents it from promising full
employment, better public services, or anything else that requires
public spending.
If his criticisms sound bitter, they are. His book is nasty about a
number of Labour insiders, notably Peter Mandelson, whom he feels
plotted to exclude him and promote the leadership aspirations of Gordon
Brown and ultimately, Tony Blair. Its account of his years in the Shadow
Cabinet portrays a man aware of his own cleverness, in despair at the
failure of others to notice it.
Despite my suggestion that his greatest obstacle was his nationality
in a political culture where these things matter, he claims never to
have experienced prejudice. But he is evidently an outsider, whatever
his claims to have penetrated the Establishment as Rhodes scholar,
diplomat, don and MP for 16 years.
Only an outsider would accuse Labour, as he does, of trying to
ingratiate itself with the Establishment. It won't work, he says.
''People are fed up with the Thatcherite right-wing agenda. What they
want is a positive, confident, modern Labour Party propounding different
policies, not doing deals with the Establishment but setting out a
vision of a new Britain.''

While the Chancellor sings the praises of his policies, Margaret
Vaughan finds he is concentrating on the upbeat and missing the downbeat
DON'T you step on my brown suede shoes: the Chancellor may have felt
tempted to sing a chorus or two when he met the Bank of England's
governor, Eddie George, yesterday. The pair were so strikingly out of
tune over an interest rate rise before the summer break that it would
have been surprising if the ebullient Kenneth Clarke hadn't felt
entitled to hum his own economic praises.
Most economic commentators believe the Chancellor was probably right,
and the Governor is no longer calling for increased rates. Whether they
are once more singing from the same hymn book will be known only when
the minutes of the meeting are published some six weeks hence. What is
clear is that the Chancellor's relentlessly upbeat hymning of the UK's
economic performance is as rousing as ever: ''People can see we are
turning Britain into the healthiest industrial economy in Western
Europe,'' he carolled prior to the meeting.
And, indeed, says political economist Professor Anton Muscatelli, by
latching on to one measure of good news from the UK economy in the past
15 years, Clarke can claim some credit: ''What's been happening is that
he is looking at productivity growth, that is how much each worker can
produce,'' explains the Glasgow University professor. Output per worker
has risen faster in the UK than among European competitors: ''We were
always a relatively slow productivity growth economy, relative to
Germany, France and other industrialised European countries.
''Now this has been reversed. The growth in productivity has been
better in the UK, as a recent IMF report showed.''
The gap between ourselves and our major European partners is closing:
''We're not as productive as France, Germany, America, or Japan but we
are closer. This is what the Chancellor is latching on to. We produce
more per worker than before. That's the good news.''
The bad news is that at the same time unemployment has grown out of
all proportion: ''The UK has done badly in creating jobs. Those who are
in work have done reasonably well. Real incomes have grown. But this
extra income has all gone to those in work. Those at the bottom end of
the labour market, those in poorly paid jobs or the unemployed have
fared far worse.''
The wage differential between those in the top 10% and those in the
bottom 10% has grown by 25% since 1979, Professor Muscatelli says.
''What's happening is that the economy is healthier but the people who
have benefited are those with middle to high incomes. That is the
long-term trend. The next question is what's happening in the short
term?''
Britain, like its European partners, is still recovering from
recession. What everyone, of whatever political persuasion, agrees on is
the need to avoid extra inflation. It is this objective that the
governor and the Chancellor have, from different standpoints, been
arguing.
The August figures showed inflation in the UK standing at 3.5% against
2.3% in Germany and 1.6% in France. On unemployment, the UK rate is 8.3%
compared with 9% in Germany and 11.6% in France.
''All European countries have done very badly in terms of creating new
jobs,'' Professor Muscatelli says.
Behind yesterday's upbeat song from the Chancellor lie some statistics
which worry the economic commentators enough to mute any chorus of
cheer. Employment growth has nose-dived, manufacturing output and
investment have flattened, and there were weak production figures
disclosed this week.
Manufacturing output has shown no growth since August last year,
slipping into a decline of 0.4% in July, and the really alarming news
comes from the housing market where, overall in the UK, transactions
have fallen by 15% and are as low as they were in the recession of 1990
to 1992. Figures for private car sales this week offered no solace,
dragging along only 0.7% up on last year. Unemployment is rising and GDP
-- gross domestic product figures -- are now being revised down.
It means, say the forecasters, that the real economy -- which looked
so strong a year ago -- has stuttered to a halt. How enduring the
slowdown will be remains, like most economic forecasting, a matter of
reading the runes and guessing.
Professor Muscatelli says: ''Some commentators believe there is
something structurally wrong in the UK economy as far as our financial
systems are concerned: that we are not as enterprising as our European
partners. That our banks and financial systems take a short-term view.
''In Germany and France, it is a different environment. Entrepreneurs
own and run the same business, initiative is linked to people owning and
running the businesses. Banking and business are more interconnected, in
a more healthy way.
''It's not clear whether what the UK is experiencing is simply a
temporary catch-up in productivity growth, and that in the long run we
are still doomed to be the slow-growth country of Europe.
''My own view is that there has been some fundamental change in the UK
economy. And the fact that we are attracting more foreign investment
means we have made many of the painful necessary adjustments in the
eighties,'' he says.
Last year the UK saw economic growth of 4% -- better than Germany at
2.5% and than France at 3%. This year, though, most forecasters believe
the UK will grow at the same rate as our major competitors in Europe.
So where does this leave us, relative to the economic performance of
our major European competitors?
According to an analysis this week from the World Economic Forum -- a
think-tank based in Switzerland -- the UK has slipped to 18th place in
its world competitiveness report, from 14th ranking last year.
America overtook Japan to take first place, but it was Germany (6th)
and the Netherlands (7th) who led the European economies. France ranked
ahead of the UK in 17th place, with Denmark 9th, and Switzerland 5th.
Belgium was ranked 19th, with Spain taking 28th place ahead of Italy at
30th, just ahead of Portugal at 31st.
In the 1995 ranking, the report said, the European countries showed a
disquieting divergence in the competitive structures of their economies,
by managing their competitiveness very differently, contrary to the
objectives of the Maastricht Treaty.
The report was drawn up from factors economists believed make or break
a nation's competitive environment. The factors included domestic
economic strength, the extent to which a country took part in
international trade and investment flows, and how government policies
helped competitiveness.
It also examined management, the performance of markets and financial
services, scientific and technological capacity, and the availability
and qualifications of its people. It is seen as a tool for strategic
decision-making for business and government.
On those figures, there's still a lot of choir practice to be done
before the Chancellor's hymn of praise to the UK economy strikes a chord
all round.

The declining role of MI5 in Northern Ireland leaves it vulnerable to
Government cutbacks. But on the day that a multi-million pound swindle
is revealed in Torquay, Paul Wilkinson examines the proposal to use the
secret intelligence service in the fight against organised crime
IN October, 1992, the Government gave the Security Service, better
known as MI5, the lead role in intelligence operations against the IRA
on the British mainland. This was criticised at the time, especially by
the Metropolitan Police Special Branch, which had traditionally
performed this task.
On practical grounds, there was much to be said in favour of giving
MI5 this new role. The service already had a great deal of experience in
countering terrorism, and its new director general, Stella Rimington,
had previously headed MI5's counter terrorism department.
The ending of the cold war meant that the service had the resources
for this new role, and it was uncomfortably clear that there was a huge
gap in police intelligence on IRA cells on the mainland, and this meant
that the ''active service units'' were able to mount spectacular and
hugely destructive attacks, such as the City of London bombings, with
impunity.
Evidence of intensive MI5 intelligence and surveillance, which
surfaced in the trials of key IRA terrorists captured on the mainland in
the period prior to the ceasefire, gave graphic evidence of the value of
MI5's contribution to the fight against the IRA.
The extent of their commitment to combatting the threat from Irish
terrorism was emphasised by Stella Rimington in her Dimbleby Lecture in
June, 1994, when she described it as the service's most important task,
taking up nearly half its resources.
But the IRA ceasefire last year and the real prospect of the removal
of any long-term threat from Irish terrorism now faces MI5 with an acute
dilemma. How can they resist Treasury demands for sharp cuts in manpower
and funding?
Clear signs that MI5 has been seeking to expand into new missions in
fighting drug trafficking and international organised crime emerged last
January when the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire, chairman of the
Chief Constables Committee on Drug Crime, expressed concern at reports
that MI5 was hoping to take on an expanded role in fighting serious
crime, and the Chief Commissioner of the City of London Police was
reported to be seeking clarification on MI5's plans.
Last May, in reply to questions from Michael O'Brien, MP, a
parliamentary adviser to the Police Federation, Michael Howard, the Home
Secretary, stated that he is prepared to consider proposals for MI5 to
mount intelligence operations to combat serious crime. Some experts on
intelligence, such as Rupert Allison, MP, (author Nigel West), believe
that MI5's expansion into fighting serious crime would require a change
in the 1989 Security Service Act, under which MI5 is only allowed to
operate in areas affecting national security, such as espionage,
subversion, and terrorism.
Howard implied that the language of the Security Service Act was not
in itself an obstacle to MI5 undertaking these new tasks if a way could
be found for the service to play a useful role in supporting the police.
This would involve defining the growth in drug crime, money laundering
and other forms of serious crime as a threat to national security.
In parallel with the debate on the future role of MI5, in the light of
the IRA ceasefire, there has also been intensive discussion on the
future role of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch.
The branch has had a 20% reduction in manpower, and is now switching
its main focus to threats of terrorism from animal rights extremists,
millenarian groups such as the doomsday cult which launched a chemical
weapons attack in the Tokyo underground, and the spillover of
international terrorism.
While we should welcome a fuller and more thoughtful debate on the
future role of intelligence and police services, I believe that there
are some powerful arguments against committing MI5 to fighting serious
crime.
First, we should not be so hasty in assuming that the traditional
roles of our secret intelligence services, dealing with subversion,
espionage and economic warfare, have suddenly become irrelevant in the
post-cold war world. On the contrary, I would argue that the present new
world disorder of bitter ethnic and religious conflicts and rivalry over
resources is so volatile that we need a sophisticated intelligence
capability more than ever.
It is a harsh fact that many political leaders in Western governments,
including Britain, were caught totally unprepared by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait and the bloody conflict in the former Yugoslavia. It is not clear
whether this was due to failures by intelligence services or by their
political masters neglecting to use intelligence more accurately. Either
way, it is unarguable that we still need intelligence capability of the
highest quality. Nor can we depend wholly on signals intelligence and
the sophisticated technology of GCHQ.
Human intelligence is still indispensable in interpreting conflict and
threat assessment.
This is an argument for a more efficient deployment of the
intelligence services in their traditional roles, not for allowing them
to colonise traditional police work.
In any case, it should be remembered that the police in Britain have
their own extremely effective intelligence services, the Special Branch,
and the new and highly professional National Criminal Intelligence
Service.
If extra intelligence resources are needed to fight serious crime,
these should be invested in the police's own intelligence operations.
A major argument against pushing MI5 into the area of conventional
crime is that in most democratic countries it is the police Special
Branch, not the secret intelligence services, which leads in
crime-fighting intelligence. Hence our police have excellent bilateral
and multilateral links with overseas police forces, including links
through Interpol and TREVI.
These links have proved increasingly effective and there is a real
danger that placing MI5 into this work would create obstacles to
efficient police co-operation.
There is a traditional and unavoidable tension and suspicion between
uniformed and non-uniformed security agencies. This is already a problem
within individual countries. It would be foolish to exacerbate the
situation by putting MI5 into what is seen as a key police role.
Last, but by no means least, we should bear in mind that the key
objective in fighting conventional crime is to bring the criminals to
trial and secure convictions. The police have the experience and
expertise for this work, preparing evidence for the prosecution and
presentation of evidence in court. Moreover, the uniformed police can
undertake these tasks openly under the full restraints of the rule of
law and with a high degree of public accountability.
By contrast, secret services operate in the shadows. Their instinct is
to work in complete secrecy. The detailed scrutiny and requirements of
the judicial process are foreign to them and their discomfort with these
restraints is always evident when they have to appear in court.
In cases affecting national security, such as terrorism and espionage,
it is a price we may be willing to pay. But in the day-to-day battle
against crime, surely it is right for a democracy to look to its police
and criminal justice system and give them the necessary resources to do
the job.

The BMA is broadly pleased with the law commission study, but as Alan
MacDermid, Medical Correspondent reports, it can see problems in the
event of disagreements
THE law commission's proposals appear to offer doctors in Scotland
more discretion than their English colleagues about allowing a patient's
life to draw to a close.
However, the British Medical Association acknowledged that some
mechanism was necessary to deal with disagreement among the medical team
or relatives.
They also looked forward to the formation of a mechanism, perhaps
through some form of tribunal, which could allow disagreements to be
settled without grieving families having to go through the trauma of a
full-blown court action and attendant publicity.
Ann Sommerville, the association's medical ethics adviser, said the
proposals seemed to be broadly in line with the proposals published by
the English Law Commission, which they were glad to see.
''We welcome the clarification of a law which has been very fragmented
in the past and raised problems for health professionals,'' she said.
''The Scots version appears to offer more discretion to clinicians and
relatives. That displays confidence in the system, and that is ideal
where everyone is of the same mind. But we recognise that anyone must be
able to register disagreement.''
Although the law commission deals with switching-off life support
machines for brain-dead patients, that issue is now largely settled in
the public mind.
It has been superseded by the issue of treating patients in a
persistent vegetative state (PSV), where the brain-stem is intact --
permitting the patient to breathe independently -- but where the higher
levels of the brain are damaged beyond hope of recovery.
The issue was brought to the fore by the case of Hillsborough disaster
victim Tony Bland, and has centred to some extent on whether artificial
feeding -- necessary to keep the patient alive -- constitutes a medical
intervention.
Doctors maintain that it does, and that its withdrawal comes within
the scope of the decisions they have to make daily to discontinue
treatment which is no longer of benefit to the patient.
It takes longer for PSV to be safely regarded as irrevocable and it
cannot be confirmed as precisely as brain death. The BMA recommends a
minimum of one year of insentience before that decision is reached.
The BMA had been content with the House of Lords view in the Bland
case that each case needed court review for the time-being, but it had
anticipated that at some point it would fall to clinicians to make
decisions about when it would be appropriate to withdraw treatment, as
long as there were safeguards to ensure consultation.
''There is a need to ensure that there is a mechanism for this.
Members of the family are most likely to have known the patient and to
know what their wishes would have been,'' said Ms Sommerville.
''Problems have arisen in the past where the family have not been
given an opportunity to discuss the situation. We think it is important
to have some mechanism that people can turn to if there is a difference
of opinion.''
The Scottish Law Commission suggests the Court of Session, and in
England the only recourse is to go the courts in cases of dispute.
''Although that reassures public opinion we recognise that it is
invasive for the family if they have someone seriously ill -- it can be
very difficult for them to face the prospect of going through the very
public ring of the media and courts.
''The English commission has suggested tribunals, which would be less
cumbersome and would guarantee that the matter was being discussed
without subjecting the families to the ordeal of publicity. I don't
think there is any consensus yet on what form they should take.''

A new report has given its verdict on when the law should enshrine a
right to die, Bruce McKain, Law Correspondent, looks at the proposals.
HOW the law takes care of those who are incapable of looking after
themselves is a hugely important subject.
Medical advances which allow the brain-dead to be kept alive, the
increasing number of elderly people suffering from dementia and a much
greater awareness of the needs of the mentally disabled have left the
law struggling to keep up.
That is why the Scottish Law Commission has spent four years of
consultation and produced two excellent and comprehensive reports on the
rights of mentally incapable people.
In effect, the commission has produced a completely new legal
framework to regulate both the personal welfare and the finances of
people who are incapable of making such crucial decisions.
The thinking behind the reforms is that any intervention into the life
of an incapable adult should be in the least intrusive way consistent
with providing proper care and protection from exploitation and abuse.
The wishes and feelings of the adult, past and present, should be
taken into account as well as the wishes of family and carers.
These same general principles underpin the commission's
recommendations on medical research, abortion, electro-convulsive
therapy, sterilisation and organ donation involving mentally incapable
adults.
They have been used as the yardstick for the highly controversial
proposals on the legal position of doctors who have been placed in an
intolerable position under Scots law.
If they switch off the life support machine keeping alive a patient
with no hope of recovery, or decide not to battle against the pneumonia
affecting a terminally-ill cancer patient, they run the risk of being
prosecuted in the criminal courts, sued for damages in the civil courts
or professional disciplinary proceedings.
The law commission has drafted legislation, The Incapable Adults
(Scotland) Bill, which would bring Scots law into line with England
where the courts have ruled that there is no absolute duty on a doctor
to prolong a patient's life regardless of circumstances or quality of
life.
Clause 41 of the law commission's Bill would make it legal for a
doctor to withhold or withdraw medical treatment from an adult who is
incapable of communicating a decision about the treatment.
This would be allowed if, in the doctors ''reasonable opinion'', the
medical treatment or its continuation would not be of benefit, even if
the lack of treatment would result in the death of the patient.
Before deciding to withdraw treatment the doctor would have to carry
out ''such consultation as accords with good medical practice''. Current
''good medical practice'' would involve the doctor discussing the
circumstances with medical colleagues and the patient's family as far as
it is possible to do so. If the patient had previously expressed his
wishes in a ''living will'' that would also be taken into account.
The Bill also states: ''In considering whether or not the medical
treatment or its continuation would be of benefit to the incapable
adult, it shall not be assumed that the prolongation of the life of an
adult, regardless of his circumstances, is necessarily of benefit to
him.''
As Dr Eric Clive of the law commission recognised yesterday, this is a
controversial and highly-emotive subject and there are some who will
find the right to die proposals completely unacceptable, particularly
the notion that ''it is not necessarily of benefit to patients to keep
them alive as long as possible''. But the commission clearly feels it is
high time doctors in Scotland know where they stand.
It says in its report: ''It would follow from the fact that any
withholding or withdrawal of treatment in accordance with the new
statutory provisions would be lawful; that doctors making and
participating in such decisions would not incur any liability.
''We think that this clear statutory immunity from criminal, civil or
disciplinary proceedings would encourage doctors not to provide futile
treatment defensively and would enhance the quality of life for
terminally ill patients.''
The law commission thinks that the approval of the Court of Session
would be needed only in exceptional cases where there was a dispute over
whether treatment should be withdrawn or doctors felt the sanction of
the court was essential.
It acknowledges the advantage of involving the court so that the
decision is being made in an open forum rather than by doctors and the
patient's family in private.
''There is a public interest in monitoring treatment-limiting
decisions which may have fatal consequences and in protecting incapable
patients who are unable to protect themselves. On the other hand, legal
proceedings bring unwelcome publicity and additional stresses to the
patient's family.''
In too many cases in the past, the Government has failed to implement
sensible reforms proposed by the Scottish Law Commission. The
recommendations published by the commission yesterday, and not just
those concerned with the right to die, are much too important to be
allowed to suffer the same fate.

WE ARE getting fatter. That's official. No, it's not because we are
eating more, in fact we are eating less than 20 years ago. The reason
for all this sudden loading of lard on to the human body is the radical
change in lifestyles: we use cars instead of walking, and our main form
of relaxation is television.
Alarmingly, all this inactivity is causing the rate of obesity to
double every decade. So says Dr Andrew Prentice, director of the Dunn
Clinical Nutrition Centre at Cambridge, who visited Glasgow to help
publicise the launch of National Breakfast Week (September 11-17).
He has just published a paper, Obesity in Britain: Gluttony or Sloth?
in the current issue of the British Medical Journal. He concludes we are
turning into a nation of couch potatoes.
Does it matter? Yes, he says, because it causes a whole range of
diseases from heart disease and gallstones, to diabetes and varicose
veins. Moreover obesity related illnesses cost the National Health
Service #2000m annually, or 6% of the NHS costs.
''The low levels of physical activity in Britain is the most
significant factor leading to obesity,'' says Dr Prentice. This is
corroborated by evidence from the National Food Survey which reveals
that we are becoming fatter despite eating less food. Since 1970 the
average food intake per person has declined by 20% yet the rate of
obesity has doubled.
The message Dr Prentice wants to get over is that you don't have to
diet. In fact he dislikes the word diet preferring to propose
''lifestyle changes''. Put simply he wants us to switch from fat to high
carbohydrates: swop the sweets, cakes, and sticky buns for potatoes,
bread, and pasta.
''You can then eat as much as you like and you won't feel hungry.''
One startling statistic to emerge is that 50% of mid-west American
women are obese. ''There is no reason to suppose that this pattern will
not be repeated in this country,'' warns Dr Prentice.
But aren't some people naturally skinny? Likewise, others naturally
fat? Not so, he says.
''We did an experiment in Cambridge and advertised for men who claimed
they could eat what they like and never put on weight. After several
weeks with us they put on substantial amounts. The only thing that was
different was their lifestyle: they didn't exercise.''
What about dieting? Does it make you fat? Oh dear, Dr Prentice sighs.
''That's another fallacy we've knocked on the head. We did an experiment
at Cambridge which showed that repeated dieting did not lead to an
increase of body weight. If you want to lose weight then you've got to
change your lifestyle and eating habits. It's easy to lose weight -- the
problem is to keep it off.''
One final bit of advice from the good doctor: breakfast like a king,
lunch like a prince and dine like a pauper.

HAVE you tried the pickled onions in balsamic vinegar? They are to die
for. I buy them by the jarful and eat them like sweeties. Yes, this was
overheard in Glasgow. No, they weren't filming the latest yuppie-bashing
episode of Rab C Nesbitt. It was just the average discerning luncher at
Fratelli Sarti spreading the word.
The great joy of eating there is that once you have experienced the
roasted peppers, the luscious Barolo, the semi-legendary pickled onions,
drained the espresso, and paid the bill, you can buy a dirty great
carrier bag full of the same goodies to eat at home.
This dream combination of eating and shopping is a relatively new one
for most Scots, although the Sarti family has been trading in Glasgow
for 100 years. Now the smartest delis are realising that it's foolish to
let customers pop in, pick up their polenta and pay when they could be
sitting down, drinking coffee, eating pastries and reading the paper.
And then buying polenta.
The Sarti brothers, Piero and Sandro, opened their deli-restaurant
four years ago when the family business, Fazzi's, went bust. Already a
Glasgow institution, Sarti's olive oil pizzas have made a desire to diet
an unachievable goal for at least one city-centre office worker.
''I would really like to lose some weight,'' mourned a former
colleague. ''But what's the point in trying with Sarti's just round the
corner?'' Now they have extended their original premises at Wellington
Street in an attempt to lessen the queues and give themselves an easier
life. No chance. Both branches are now fully booked although it is
easier to get a table for lunch if you turn up before 12.30.
The new restaurant, at 122 Bath Street, has an Italian bar and wine
cavern with tables through the back. The menu is the same as at
Wellington Street, but a bigger kitchen allows for more elaborate
specials. Although there is no deli counter, they are experimenting with
displays of food to maintain the ham-hung ambience that makes Wellington
Street so attractive.
''We'd never give up the deli side,'' says Sandro Sarti. ''It's
getting better all the time, taking over where Fazzi's left off.'' They
use the restaurants to tempt their regular customers into trying new
delicacies and have seen some previously unknown items, such as bresaola
(air-dried beef marinated in wine and served with olive oil) take off in
popularity.
''In Italy delicatessens are normally separate,'' claims Sarti. ''The
new place is more Italian, where people walk through the bar and wine
shop to the restaurant. We go back to Italy a lot and see some other
shops and copy their ideas, but then we have a lot of our own ideas as
well. Sometimes now when we go to Italy we feel we are doing things
better.''
In Edinburgh, Sue Glass and Russell Thompson have combined similar
elements -- delectable food, powerful coffee, powerful personalities --
to make quite a different deli-restaurant, Glass &amp; Thompson.
He's a New Zealander, she's English, they're architects by training.
Airy, sparse, easy on the eye, G&amp;Ts is superficially nothing like
seething Sarti's but both benefit from the originality and tender loving
care of truly enthusiastic owners.
G&amp;Ts has just six tables; if the wind permits, some are placed outside
on Dundas Street. Soup stops in June (''it's too hot for us to make
it'') and the all-cold menu simply mixes and matches the delicious
meats, cheeses and marinated vegetables on sale into sandwiches, salads,
and tapas.
The cappuccino is frothy and fine and the attention to detail is rare
and commendable: fresh pepper and olive oil to add to the salad, a jug
of iced water with lime slices, a house copy of Hello! magazine.
''Our ideal customer comes in, has a coffee, eats something if they
want to and then buys something,'' says Thompson. ''They can taste
everything first. In a supermarket, things are provocatively laid out,
packaged in bright colours, but if you get it home and you don't like it
that's that. We provide a service, we are genuinely interested in food
and we don't try to con people into buying anything. We would rather
they tried it first than bought something and discovered they didn't
like it.''
The new generation of groovy New York coffee shops provided part of
the inspiration for G&amp;Ts, while a stint working in Milan persuaded Glass
that coffee should be ''something short and strong''. They are proud of
bringing their own prejudices to the business and feel that in these
bland days, it contributes to their success.
''We use olive oil on the sandwiches and now 95% of people take olive
oil instead of butter. I don't like cucumber so we don't have that.
We've just got an alcohol licence so we will be selling some very good
wines. We are very particular about the extras.''
Others have tried the spending and slurping mix with less success.
Nastuiks, a well-respected deli in Edinburgh's Bruntsfield, has a small
cafe sandwiched between the two parts of the shop but it's more of a
department store coffee stop than a gourmet experience. Coffee comes
from the Cona jug, an ominous bowl of chopped iceberg lettuce sits in
the chiller, waiting to accompany quiches and baked potatoes. A tinkling
Strauss waltz compounds the misery.
Not much there to worry the diet police. But loosen your waistbands,
the internationally famous food-and-wine emporium, Valvona &amp; Crolla, is
due to open a caffe bar next year. After a protracted planning
application, they have secured permission for an extension to the back
of their Elm Row shop, to build a coffee counter where customers can get
over the shock of coming in for a jar of mustard and ending up with so
many other treats they have to pay with Visa and take the lot home in a
taxi.
Double espresso and a dish of pickled onions on the side? Coming up.

WASN'T there a time when choosing a schoolbag was easy? It was brown,
it was leather and it had straps -- and that was about it.
No longer. What scenes there were, earlier this month, as anxious
parents with equally anxious children in tow, scoured the town searching
for a Power Rangers backpack. And what tears and screams resulted when
it was discovered that supplies had run out weeks ago and there was
little likelihood of them ever appearing in the shops again!
Basia Palka who opened Ralka Bags near Woolworths on Byres Road in
Glasgow four years ago, agrees that schoolbag buying has become a
difficult business. She says ''You know the younger children are going
to go for whatever cartoon characters are on the TV or whatever Disney
film is showing at the cinema, but judging how many to order is the
problem.
''Trends are constantly changing and, in fact, many children will be
bought three or four character schoolbags in the course of a year at an
average cost of around #5 or #6 each.
''On the continent,'' she added ''I think there's a different attitude
to schoolbags with parents buying even very young children something
more substantial at around #25 to #30.''
Last year, no self respecting secondary schoolgirl in Glasgow would
have been seen dead without a black Unico flap bag (#13) and although
Palka is sick of the sight of them, she's ordered more of the same for
the current season.
''There were some beautiful bags in pale blue, pink, and orange at the
trade show in Birmingham earlier this year,'' she says ''but most of the
youngsters in Glasgow prefer black.''
Foreign students from nearby Glasgow University go for blonde cowhide
satchels from former Czechoslovakia (#70) and tartan Naf Naf brand bags
(from #26).
Grannies, according to Palka are the ones who save their pension money
to buy the first grandchild a traditional leather bag -- Power Rangers
be damned -- to start school with. They're still made in the UK and
prices start at #25. (Now available in black and brown!)
Greaves Sports in Sauchiehall Street, stockist of a zillion backpacks,
reports that bags with lots of graphics on them, particularly the Air
Nike at #19, are nearing the ''sold out'' stage. The Reebok football bag
(#20), which has a practical zipped compartment at the bottom for boots,
is proving particularly popular with boys.
''Our top price for a backpack is #25,'' says a spokesman, ''and
there's no reason to pay any more than that for a good quality bag for
school.''
Try telling that to customers at Gladstone &amp; Brooke in Princes Square
where university students are kitting themselves out with Dakota brand
leather backpacks from the US (#226) and parents are buying 12-year-old
children briefcases that cost #150.

WHILE the inept handling of multi-million-pound Lottery arts
allocations has left many seething with anger, small vital handouts fail
to hit the headlines. Yet here in Scotland, co-ordinators of arts
projects in hospitals have been quick off the mark and have done
especially well.
The very first Lottery allocation earlier this year included #14,200
for Grampian hospitals art. Last Friday the Scottish Arts Council
announced #29,500 to create a new gallery at St John's Hospital,
Livingston and the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, both organised by Artlink.
With so much money now rolling in via the Lottery (the SAC have #29m
to disburse, #5m more than the SAC itself has to support all the arts
annually), it seems time for all hospital art workers to reach for their
pens, application forms, or telephone the SAC Lottery team on 0131-243
2479.
Small organisations can be hesitant to ask for cash. Part of this
reticence may be caused by the complexities of ''matching finance'' as
the Scottish Office puts it. Folk think this means they must supply half
the cash. It does not.
Gradually guidelines are taking a more flexible approach. A Heritage
spokesman told me: ''It can be things in kind or 25% from the applicant
and 75% from the Lottery. It depends. Volunteer labour (100 folk to
plant trees or list museum artefacts), building materials or a piece of
land also qualify.''
I asked the Scottish Arts Council what their rules were exactly. ''We
have no fixed requirement; there's no fixed percentage. We call it
partnership funding. Each individual case is looked at. What's realistic
for one may not be realistic for another -- especially with hospitals.''
Edinburgh and Glasgow are well served by art galleries, but there are
vast areas of Scotland without any. Lanark is a barren land, so too is
Argyll. Local government reorganisation could and should address this
problem. Meanwhile Livingston is managing to acquire a new art profile
in an unusual venue: St John's Hospital.
''This hospital is not just a place to get treated when you're ill,
but is on its way to providing the region with an alternative Gallery of
Modern Art where you can see the work of some of Scotland's best
artists,'' says Jim Eunson, secretary to the board.
The new Lottery money will provide a professional exhibition space
with good lighting to facilitate a varied exhibition programme.
The concept of art as a healer is not new. Medieval priests understood
its beneficial effect on morale and had artists decorate orphanages.
During the past decade more and more doctors are convinced of its
therapeutic effect and art in various forms has crept into hospitals,
aided and abetted by sympathetic surgeons and medics.
Grampian Hospitals Art Project is a byword for artistic enterprise
with more than 1000 pieces of contemporary art: not only in Aberdeen's
Royal Infirmary and Royal Cornhill, but at Peterhead, Ladysbridge
Hospital near Banff and at Elgin's Dr Gray's Hospital, which attracted
the first Lottery cash towards an etched-glass screen by Liz Ogilvie,
made at Aberdeen Peacock Printmakers.
Meanwhile, Aberdeen's Royal Infirmary is, according to Peter Senior,
director arts and health, ''the most impressive collection of quality
art in any hospital or health authority throughout the UK''. Grampian's
project was initiated by the now-retired consultant surgeon Mr Norman
Matheson 10 years ago.
In Edinburgh another art enthusiast, Dr John Munro, initiated the
successful Eastern General Hospital art project which has run a regular
exhibition programme in its corridors and foyers for several years
(mostly sponsored by drug companies), and which has inspired other
Lothian hospitals.
Among brand-new hospitals, London and Livingston are well to the fore
with Chelsea Westminster notable for expensive, colourful, lively,
large-scale -- but expensive -- painting and sculpture by top names such
as Allen Jones. But Livingston is already making its mark with a small
budget of #20,000 over two years achieving a series of commissions by 16
artists so far.
St John's, a 550-bed, #80m hospital, was built in two parts. The first
opened in 1989, the second, which abuts, in 1991. When the joining wall
between the two was removed, the low-rise design resulted in several
extremely long and virtually identical corridors. ''At an early stage it
became clear something must be done to alleviate the monotony,'' says
Eunson. The hospital contacted Artlink for advice, set up an art
committee and the project began.
First commissions went to well-known artists George Donald, Marj Bond,
Alastair Mack, Peter Thomson, and Peter Swift. Phase two has just been
finished with groups of work by Jack Knox, Sylvia von Hartmann, and
Dorothy Stirling.
At the inauguration Bob Watt, chairman of the hospital trust and also
head of Livingston Development Corporation, announced: ''St John's is
committed to its art policy, and to extending the programme. But I hope
more local business will follow the example of the Livingston Japanese
businesses Seiko, Shin-etsu, and NEC and finance some pictures. There is
enough space left for every business in the district!''
Plans include sculptures in the courtyards and an artist-in-residence.
Artlink consultant Nan Mulder had the job of commissioning the art
works for St John's. Herself an artist, she worked with Artlink for
seven years. Marj Bond told me: ''Nan is great. Very positive,
supportive, and articulate with advice. I found it a great enjoyment to
work with her and Artlink.''
St John's now sports a range of work from gentle West Coast landscapes
to exotic Mexican masked figures. Thomson made a large seascape full of
quirky detail.
Bond finds her inspiration in Mexican travels. Her nine colourful
paintings feature Mayan warrior heads with a central Madonna-type
figure. ''I used gesso and acrylic to build up interesting textured
surfaces. It was such an opportunity and I had a free hand.'' Although
commissions can be constricting, Bond has risen to the occasion with
bolder images than usual.
So too Alastair Mack whose series of metre-square, brightly coloured
Matisse-like images, Facts of Life, lead to the upstairs maternity unit,
apt as Mack had just become a father. He says: ''Because it's a hospital
you put more into it; make sure that they get a good deal.'' His
pictures are bouncy abstracts addressing movement growth, genes,
chromosomes, respiration, reproduction, and so on.
Jennie Tuffs's glorious colour-saturated flowers hang in the burns
unit (her posters are also on London Underground), while pictures by
Elspeth Lamb, Barbara Rae, Cathy Outram, and Liz Whiffin adorn the
restaurant. The trust has also commissioned a set of lino prints from
Jane Hyslop, which includes views of Bangour Village Hospital, the
precursor of St John's. Sylvia Von Hartmann's imaginative installation
of giant dolls house cut-outs; table, door, dresser, and chair which are
screwed to the wall at different heights so that kids, wheelchair users,
and visitors can all find something of interest at their own height.
While Lottery money is available, as Bond says: ''It's wonderful that
St John's is commissioning art. The nurses, doctors, and patients seem
happy with things. It's going to be a showpiece hospital I'm sure.''
Let's hope other NHS trust hospitals follow St John's lead -- and fast
-- before, as some sceptics fear, Lottery money is not just funding
hospital art but funding hospitals themselves.

CRAIG ARMSTRONG does one of the best things any musician can: he
composes music which confounds easy categorisation. He understands why
this has resulted in a measure of confusion about who he is. ''I've
never worked wholly in one field or another, in commercial music or
so-called classical,'' Armstrong says over an early-evening beer close
to home in Glasgow's gritty downtown burgh of Partick.
''I once heard a classical composer say that commercial music is
irrelevant. In contrast, I take the Steve Reich/Philip Glass line . . .
I love pop music, and the most interesting commercial stuff has a
definite influence on what I compose. Being actively enjoyed by more
than 20 people . . . that's why I became a musician. Hearing it on the
telly; hearing it in a bar. To make music that you don't need two heads
to enjoy. On good days as a composer, you feel open to things.''
Armstrong's determined open-mindedness has led him to compose much
wondrous and label-free music in a widely-varied assortment of locales.
He has crafted massive orchestrations for his big mates in Massive
Attack, as well as having co-written Weather Storm on their most recent
album, Protection. Armstrong's long-standing association with Massive
Attack major domo Nellee Hooper has led him to provide orchestral
arrangements on a number of Nellee's productions, most notably for
Madonna's Take A Bow.
Additionally, Armstrong's distinguished string arrangement can
currently be heard on Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me, U2's
contribution to the Batman movie soundtrack. The U2 link was recently
further cemented by Armstrong's involvement in the Bono-composed title
song for the forthcoming James Bond movie, Golden Eye, sung by Tina
Turner.
Golden Eye's orchestration had to be hurriedly undertaken within two
hectic days. ''At the time, it was perfectly natural to find myself
sitting on a sofa with Bono, the Edge, and Tina Turner. It's only later
that you think: 'Wow, Tina Turner asked me if wanted a cup of tea.' It's
great that, as an impoverished Glasgow arranger, I can use my normal
orchestrator's craft to keep my kids in nappies as well as reach some
unusual musical places.''
On Tuesday night Armstrong will be present in two very different
settings. Physically, he'll be on a stage in Modena, Italy, conducting
the somewhat unlikely combo of Pavarotti, Brian Eno, and U2. They're
appearing in the War Child charity's concert for Bosnia, performing
Bono's near-certain chart-topper, Miss Sarajevo, a single which comes
with Armstrong-ian strings attached.
Meanwhile, on the same night back in Glasgow the performing
partnership of Gordon Dougall, of Strathclyde Orchestral Productions,
Jane MacFarlane, and Simon Burberry will be officially unveiling
Armstrong's score for the Tron's latest stage production, The Trick Is
To Keep Breathing, Michael Boyd's adaptation of Janice Galloway's novel.
Having previously contributed to such Boyd works as The Broken Heart,
Good, and Macbeth, Armstrong hails the Tron as ''an invaluable wee
centre of exploration''. Music for the stage, though. If it's doing its
job properly, shouldn't it be imperceptible, free of authorial
trademarks?
''No! It's not background music. What most helps a production is music
with a life of its own, that has its own narrative. It's not romantic
backdrop stuff, not angry-sounding music for 'this character is now
angry' moments. That's the worst way to use music.''
A large number of different institutions could be using Armstrong's
music over the next year or so. Mayfest have asked him to create
something for 1996, with Armstrong planning to deploy the rhythmic
wizardry of Massive Attack's Mushroom alongside the ambient-dance nous
of exiled Glaswegian production boffin Howard Bernstein. Typically,
Armstrong pledges that this collaboration will sport ''a freer approach,
not 'I, Composer, am going to write this work'.''
He's also got his own recordings to do for Massive Attack's new Wild
Bunch label, while Massive Attack themselves will hopefully be enlisting
Armstrong's services for their new album, due to start being recorded in
November.
On top of that, Armstrong may soon be Dublin-bound for further work
with U2. Future Sound of London liked Armstrong's version of their
Eggshell, too. And there's a song-cycle with Peter Arnott; possible
Hollywood soundtrack work; TV soundtracks for Carlton and maybe BBC
Scotland; a Scottish Arts Council-funded study of Indian music.
Armstrong has come a long way from studying composition and piano at
the Royal Academy of Music in London. Or maybe not so far. ''I've a
couple of pivotal childhood moments. I remember being transfixed during
a holiday in the Lake District with my parents, hearing the Beatles'
Long And Winding Road on the radio. I lived for the moment it would be
on again.
''And I recall the joy of monkeying about with a pal's Grundig tape
recorder. There's a magic about recording, about studios. The things
that can happen in a take are beyond 'Can that bloke play OK?' What goes
on on tape is indescribable, inexplicable.''
It was in a studio around six years ago that Armstrong, reaching the
end of sundry sojourns in sundry under-achieving Glasgow bands, met Soul
II Soul's erstwhile motivator Nellee Hooper, deputed to be producer.
''Nellee's strength is that he trusts you to do what you want, rarely
looking over your shoulder to say: 'Why don't you do this there?' But
there's no barrier to you suggesting things to him. He gives his team
real freedom.
''He's intuitive, improvisatory. He does records that just flow.
You're never in the studio with him, looking at the clock and thinking:
'When's this going to be over?' With Nellee, it's all 'Whoosh!'
Travelling at 2000mph and there's the finished mix. He's the world's top
producer, no doubt about it.''
Any other thumbs-ups to dispense? To Armstrong's favourite composers:
Reich, Ligeti, Kancheli, and Wonder (Stevie of that ilk, for Music Of My
Mind). To Gil Evans; ''I marvel that I'm arranging in a similar way he
did in the fifties for Miles Davis. You would have thought the role
would have died out by now.''
And it's thumbular approbation for the dub-wise sound-manipulations of
the Mad Professor. For Sister Sledge's Thinking Of You, which Craig
knows is both a masterpiece and a religious experience. For the
unclassifiable grooves of Massive Attack, who create ''a world music . .
. not world music in the hippie sense, but in being free to use exactly
what you like from wherever in the world it springs.''
This all-embracing spirit is one which extends rather hearteningly
into Armstrong's everyday sphere of domestic existence, which is peopled
by three small human compositions co-crafted with his partner Laura
Mazzolini, a former member of Glasgow's long-lost, much-lamented His
Latest Flame.
Their trio of children, aged two, four, and six, much enjoy
spontaneous musical improvisations. ''Aye, nothing's out of bounds when
the three of them get together for a jam on gong, cello, and piano.''
Heart-felt music which accepts no limitations: a very good thing indeed.
I remember being transfixed during a holiday with my parents, hearing
the Beatles' Long And Winding Road on the radio. I lived for the moment
it would be on again

THE stage adaptation of Janice Galloway's stylised novel The Trick Is
To Keep Breathing, which opens at the Tron in Glasgow tonight, is the
kind of scary venture which is enough to presage panic in the calmest
heart but with only a few days to go, an hour before the first full run
through, Meg Fraser, who makes her professional debut in the Tron
Theatre Company production, radiates the kind of breathless excitement
which invoke's Galloway's title.
She's certainly a lot more jubilant that the first time I met her,
when she was part of a group of RSAMD graduates I interviewed this
summer about their hopes for employment in a notoriously competitive
career. Then, with a few tentative offers in the pipeline following her
stunning performance in the Academy's diploma show -- one being from The
Trick . . . director Michael Boyd -- Fraser was tight-lipped about her
future prospects. Now she's grinning from ear to ear. I mention she
seems happy and relaxed and she laughs uproariously.
''No, this is hysteria,'' she informs me. She's clearly delighted
about her inclusion in a show which features so many top-class Scottish
actors. ''I can hardly believe I've come straight out of college to work
with such outstanding people on my first production -- like Peter
Mullen, Siobhan Redmond, Eileen McCallum, Jennifer Black, Forbes Masson,
and Neve McIntosh. The first few weeks of rehearsal I was so overwhelmed
I could hardly open my mouth.''
Her tentativeness soon evaporated in the face of the friendliness of
the company and Boyd, who has dramatised the novel which was first
presented at the Tron as an experimental work-in-progress two years ago.
''They're all down-to-earth people and Michael has such an amazing
sense of humour. When you're at college you hear so much drivel about
actors being luvvies or bitchy but it hasn't been at all like that.
No-one has treated me as an inferior.''
Boyd has been writing throughout the rehearsal period, with changes
being made up to the eleventh hour. He has chosen to represent the
warring mind-states of Galloway's heroine, Joy, through three different
physical incarnations, played by Redmond, Black, and McIntosh. Fraser
plays Joy's health visitor and various other female characters.
''It's a great opportunity as it gives me the chance to play different
people,'' says Fraser who told me in the summer that she wanted to be an
actor as it was the one job which gave her the possibility of pretending
to be anything from a doctor to a policewoman.
''They're not differentiated with accents or anything. Michael wants
all my characters to have elements of the health visitor in them which
means they are all variations of her. I just hope the audience
understands that and doesn't think they're all similar because I'm shite
at acting.''
Her health visitor is a sickly saccharine character. ''She's so
sweet,'' says Fraser, screwing her nose up in disgust. Her next
professional engagement offers a contrasting experience -- playing an
Ugly Sister in Cinderella at the Dundee Rep Theatre.
Her success so far, and that of her former classmates, has been
remarkable; she reckons that about 95% of them have found work -- and
not pulling pints. Of the group The Herald spoke to, Russell Watters and
Billy Mac have been working with Fifth Estate on Playing Sarajevo, Jayne
McKenna is to appear in the Royal Lyceum Company's production of Our
Country's Good, Tracey Wiles is loving every minute of her six-month
contract with BBC Radio Drama, the result of her Carleton Hobbs Award,
and the vivacious Emily Hanrahan is also appearing in The Trick Is to
Keep Breathing, as an extra.
That's a pretty impressive result in the first few months following
graduation and undoubtedly this section of the class of '95 have further
to go yet. Watch this space for details of their progress.

QUESTIONS formed magically on our lips as we left. The time-honoured
one, of course: How did he do that? Levitating a table; cutting himself
in half; cutting a semi-draped babe in half; de-materialising here,
reappearing there, posing with self-regarding moodiness everywhere.
But there were other questions, too. Not so much ''How did he do
that?'' as ''Do we care how he did that?'' and ''Why did we bother
paying #19.50 to watch him do that?'' Opening an envelope sealed inside
a straitjacket, we surveyed our answers: ''No, I don't care how he did
that, frankly'' and ''Oh, bum, where's me money?''
For it must be said that Mr Copperfield's brande of magicke is old
enough to be Dickensian, despite David tarting it up with his black
leather biker's jacket, two scantily-clad chicks, clouds of dry ice, and
plodding stadium-rock anthems by the likes of Seal, U2, Aerosmith, Rod
Stewart, and Phil Collins.
New bugs Penn and Teller have moved things on by explaining the nature
of illusion with self-deprecating wit, lashings of bad taste, and
buckets of pretend blood. Why can't you, David?
Ah, questions, questions. Two crudely-jokey versions of Smokie's
execrable Living Next Door To Alice in the UK top 30: who bought them?
The same people who filled the SECC twice on Wednesday night?
Finally, I must stress that at no time during the writing of this
review did my hands leave the ends of my arms. Now open your wallets.
Presto! Empty!

PETER CHANG from Glasgow, ''an important figure in British
jewellery'', has won the first #7500 Jerwood Prize for Jewellery, it was
announced in London today.
Chang was the dark horse in the race, and his is a surprise win. His
creations are outlandish, extravagant, and off the wall -- not for the
faint-hearted or shrinking violet. Bold brooches, earrings and bracelets
are made from recycled plastic rather than silver or gold and he never
uses diamonds or pearls.
However, his craftsmanship is dazzling in its intricacy, his pieces
often taking up to 600 hours' work. Originally trained as a printmaker
and sculptor, not a jeweller or silversmith, he was the only man in a
short-list of six. He began making jewellery for his wife, Barbara
Santos Shaw, then head of printed textiles at Glasgow School of Art.
Chairman of the judges, John Tusa, ex-head of the BBC World Service
and now director designate of London's Barbican Centre, said: ''The
judges were encouraged to look for work of lasting significance,
rewarding achievement and not mere promise.
''In Peter Chang we responded to his daring brilliance, colours, his
exuberance, his sense of fantasy, but also his underlying balance of
elegance of form. The panel noted too his unorthodox materials and his
willingness to branch out in directions entirely his own.''
The other prizewinner is Charlotte de Syllas from London. Cynthia
Cousens, Wendy Ramshaw, Mah Rana, and Esther Ward were also on the
short-list. All the work is on show at the Crafts Council in London.
The Jerwood Prize for Jewellery is to become an annual event. The
#30,000 Jerwood Prize for Painting, introduced last summer, will be
announced later this month. Scot Callum Innes is short-listed for that
and the #20,000 Tate Turner Prize.

US mediator Richard Holbrooke will today try to persuade the Foreign
Ministers of Bosnia, Croatia, and Yugoslavia to agree on the
constitutional principles governing a new Bosnian union.
Diplomats believe his most difficult task in talks in Geneva will not
be to entice Bosnian factions into a post-war marriage of convenience,
so much as getting them to agree the terms of an eventual divorce.
Mr Holbrooke, assistant Secretary of State, will meet Croatia's Mate
Granic, Bosnia's Muhamed Sacirbey, and Yugoslav Milan Milutinovic.
Before then he is expected to see colleagues from the Contact Group,
the major powers dealing with former Yugoslavia, and settle on draft
constitutional principles the Ministers could sign. This would allow him
to tackle the thornier issue of Bosnia's territorial carve-up, and pave
the way for a summit of Balkan leaders.
The Contact Group is expected to offer Bosnian Serbs the chance of
confederation with rump Yugoslavia in the same way Bosnia's Muslim-Croat
alliance can have confederal links with Croatia yet still remain in
Bosnia.
With a war crimes indictment hanging over Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic, the Bosnian Serbs will be represented on Friday by ''Foreign
Minister'' Mr Aleksa Buha, the Foreign Minister, and Vice-President
Nikola Koljevic in a joint delegation headed by Mr Milutinovic.
Diplomats and negotiators say all sides tacitly accept that Bosnia
will cease to exist as a meaningful unitary state after a peace accord.
''It makes sense to start with the constitution. The Serbs could be
much easier to deal with if they know they're going to have their own
state at the end of the day,'' said one diplomat.
''But the Muslims certainly wouldn't. They'll be saying that if the
constitutional principles foresee a divorce, we'll need that much more
territory to give us a viable state.''
The Ministers are also expected to discuss a possible summit involving
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman,
and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
Diplomats said this could help bring about agreement between Mr
Tudjman and Mr Milosevic on a solution for the Croatian Serb enclave of
Eastern Slavonia and mutual recognition by the three republics of each
other's borders, a key Western condition for the lifting of UN sanctions
on rump Yugoslavia.-- Reuter

A HUNGRY, lonely winter beckons old people in the besieged towns of
Bosnia. Research carried out by the World Health Organisation shows they
are bearing the brunt of malnutrition in the war zone.
Grandparents are being left to fend for themselves as their families
flee the fighting, and the picture that emerges is of sick and hungry
old people, one which runs counter to the images of starving children
from typical famine crises in underdeveloped countries.
The report, published today in the British Medical Journal, says
under-nourishment may be precipitated in elderly patients by sickness,
cold, problems with cooking their food, and the stress of war. They are
also worn down by the regular trek for fuel, water, and food rations.
Ms Fiona Watson, a consultant nutritionist at the Institute of Child
Health in London, helped to carry out the research last year in Tuzla,
Zenica, and Sarajevo.
''They are subjected to constant bombardment, an uncertain food
supply, disruption of power and water supplies, a depressed economy, and
shrinking financial and physical reserves,'' she points out.
Population samples who were studied when conditions were at their
worst showed no undernutrition in children, but it was three times more
prevalent in eldelry people than in adults.
The overall proportion of people with a low body mass index was higher
than the British population, and at 27% was particularly high among the
old. Urban residents and residents in old people's homes suffered more
than rural residents.
''Violence, separation from families, isolation, and breakdown of
formal and informal support systems may have triggered depressive
illness, which is known to be accompanied by weight loss and ill
health,'' said Ms Watson. ''This may be particularly disabling in
elderly people.''
Her report calls for a different focus for aid than normally prevails
in disaster areas, where it is normally targeted at infants and pregnant
or nursing mothers.
''This narrow focus may not be appropriate in a developed country
where the population was previously comparatively healthy and
well-fed,'' said Ms Watson.
''The former Yugoslavia has an aging population and a more dramatic
demographic shift may have been triggered by the war as elderly people
have been left behind by fleeing families, either through inability to
travel or choice.
''These people need hot nourishing meals, medical care, fuel, winter
clothing, counselling, and opportunities to socialise through public
kitchens, home helps, day care centres, and community vounteer
networks.''

A HUGE pall of smoke billowed skywards and terrified women and
children ran for safety yesterday as Nato warplanes blasted an
ammunition dump close to the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale.
Witnesses said two big explosions rocked the town when the jets
swooped down and fired rockets into a wooded glade 1500 yards to the
east of the political headquarters of the separatist Serb realm in
Bosnia. The site housed a military facility which blew up.
''Run, run into the hills. Don't film me, defend me,'' Jela Vuckovic
told a Reuters news team as she fled her farmhouse, weeping
hysterically.
The team got to within 50 yards of the perimeter and heard detonations
inside the installation, but were prevented from moving closer.
Nato has redoubled its military effort to pound the Serbs into pulling
back guns from within range of Sarajevo and at least five waves of jets
hit Serb targets near Pale and the Bosnian capital yesterday morning.
A small crowd of women and children ran fearfully from their fields
for the cover of forests, petrified by the might of the aerial attack
which their army can not fend off.
Vuckovic, panting with the exertion of her flight, said: ''They are
taking our weapons away and now they are bombing us. We have to fight
back.''
Nato and UN officials said low cloud and rainy skies that hampered
operations since the bombing campaign resumed finally cleared yesterday
and allowed pilots clear sight of targets.
Inside the town itself groups of Serb residents gathered to watch the
smoke cloud. With communications systems destroyed, local people had
little news and asked foreign journalists how long the Nato attacks
would last.
Bosnian Serb army sources in Pale said Nato had inflicted serious
damage to military installations, including an important communications
post on Jahorina mountain overlooking Sarajevo and on Bosnian Serb
military headquarters at Han Pijesak.
But the intensified assault has failed to budge the Bosnian Serbs from
their refusal to comply with UN demands.
''The morale of the population and the Bosnian Serb Army (BSA) is very
high and the BSA is resolved to defend the Republika Srpska (Bosnian
Serb entity) regardless of the expressed brutality of our enemies,'' a
BSA statement said.
In Sarajevo, men and boys jostling for a glimpse of Nato planes
attacking Bosnian Serb positions outside the city ysterday flung
themselves to the ground when a bomb thundered into a Serb army barracks
less than a mile away.
Windows rattled and a shudder like an earthquake ran through the
ground as a towering plume of black smoke shot into the sky from the
Lukavica barracks, perched on the hillside to the south of the city.
The spectators picked themselves up and let out a rousing cheer.
''I'm happy with these latest bombing raids because now I'll be able
to walk around this neighbourhood without worrying about getting shot,''
said 40-year-old Asim as he peered around the corner of a building
pocked by sniper fire from the front line only 100 yards distant.
''I do feel sorry for the Serb civilians on the other side but their
army must be destroyed. The civilians are not to blame. This war is the
fault of their crazy leaders.''
Downtown, in a scene incongruous even by Sarajevo standards, children
could be seen playing football on the government side of the line within
sight of where Nato was bombing Serb positions.
Their abandon was an indicator of the city's new-found confidence that
Serbs who still ring the city with heavy weapons are now in no position
to attack.--Reuter.

Beijing had maintained a stony silence on her strongly worded remarks
at the conference on Tuesday.
It also said nothing publicly about even more pointed comments about
human rights the next day from the US delegation chief, Madeleine
Albright.
However, hours after Mrs Clinton left for Mongolia yesterday, a
foreign ministry spokesman said: ''Some people from some countries have
made unwarranted remarks or criticism of other countries.
''We would like to caution these people to pay more attention to the
problems in their own countries,'' he said, without mentioning Mrs
Clinton or others by name.
In her speech, Mrs Clinton championed human rights worldwide and
condmened the Chinese for heavy-handed security at a gathering of
private women's activists.

THE Caribbean tourist resorts of Antigua and St Martin were left
reeling today after a battering by Hurricane Luis, which killed at least
a dozen people and left thousands homeless.
The US, Jamaica, and Trinidad were among countries rushing shipments
of tents, water, and medical supplies to beleaguered islands.
Details of the devastation remained sketchy but the islands hardest
hit appeared to be the twin-island republic of Antigua and Barbuda, the
French/Dutch island of St Martin, the British colony of Anguilla, the
French island of Guadaloupe, and Dominica.
At least eight people died on St Martin, where seven bodies were
recovered from a lagoon.
A fisherman in Dominica was missing and feared dead and a tourist died
in Guadeloupe on Monday. Two others died in Puerto Rico while preparing
for the hurricane.
One person was missing and five were injured on the French island of
Saint-Barthelemy.
Caribbean officials feared the death toll might rise as roads and
neighbourhoods were cleared of debris. Each island was pounded by
hurricane-force winds for 12 hours.
One island, Barbuda, had not yet been heard from by ham radio
operators or Caribbean disaster officials. The tiny island is flat,
making it vulnerable to hurricane-whipped seas, and is home to about
1500.
Anguilla, a low-lying British colony of 10,000, sustained severe
damage but no loss of life, according to the HMS Southampton, a Royal
Navy destroyer which anchored off the island on Wednesday evening.
Anguillan officials told the navy some emergency shelters were
abandoned as Luis approached, high winds tore off their roofs, and high
seas caused dangerous flooding.
The winds also destroyed radio beacons and aerials, cutting off
Anguilla's links to the outside world. The island remained without
electricity and up to half of its homes and offices were reported to
have suffered roof or flood damage.
Luis veered north into the open Atlantic after leaving a trail of
destruction across the Leeward Islands caused by wind gusts clocked up
to 175 mph.
The hurricane spared Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, although
dangerous flash flooding was expected from heavy rains dumped by the
hurricane's tail.
Airports were closed on several islands, including St Martin, where
mud covered the runway, and Antigua, where the roof of the traffic
control tower was blown off.
It's thought Luis will most likely now churn harmlessly through the
Atlantic.--Reuter

FIVE hundred people were missing and 14 known to be dead in the
southern Philippines today after flash floods tore through villages near
a volcano.
Volcanic explosions first triggered a landslide into Lake Maughan,
which is inside the crater of Mount Parker on Mindanao island, officials
said.
The huge fall of earth and rocks then caused the lake and nearby
rivers, already swollen by days of heavy rain, to burst their banks.
Scientists do not believe an eruption is under way in the 5900 ft
volcano, but have asked for urgent government help to find out what
happened.
''The water that was flowing down the rivers was very hot and had
boulders in it,'' said the mayor of T'boli, one of the worst-hit
villages.
He said he heard two explosions several hours apart on Wednesday night
before the floods came racing down.
He added that scientists at a volcano monitoring centre in General
Santos told him their instruments had not monitored any explosions.
''I told them there's something wrong with their instruments because
rocks are falling down here already.''
Vice Mayor Salvador Ramos said 14 bodies had been recovered but 500
people were missing, believed swept away.
''People are in need of clothes and food because when the floods came
they didn't have time to pack their things,'' he said.
''All my family is gone,'' survivor Hector Palabrica, 12, told
reporters.
Rescue officials said Palabrica's mother, father, brother, and sister
were among the bodies recovered.
They added they were trying to verify how many people were missing but
continuing bad weather had prevented a major rescue effort by military
helicopters.
They said about 100 houses were destroyed in T'boli and dozens more
nearby.
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology asked the
government to supply aircraft to place monitoring equipment on the
mountain believed to have last erupted in 1640.
''Our concern for a speedy assessment is brought about by the striking
similarities of the nature and style of eruptive behaviour between
Parker . . . and Pinatubo volcanoes,'' Institute director Raymundo
Punongbayan said in a letter.
Pinatubo erupted in 1991 in one of the world's most powerful volcanic
explosions this century, killing 1000 people.
* Monsoon season floods have killed 29 people in north India, driven
50,000 people from riverside slums in Delhi, and trapped thousands more
in districts threatened by rising waters.
Army troops were helping the evacuation from areas near the swollen
Yamuna river. There were no known deaths in Delhi itself.
Officials said the river was about three feet above danger level and
still rising. Many of the people living in the lowest areas are illegal
immigrants from Bangladesh.

THERE was a time -- and not so long ago -- when the West knew exactly
where it stood with the men in the Kremlin who remorselessly ran the
vast and powerful Soviet empire.
Before the collapse of communism and the end of the Cold War, it was
not too difficult to read the Russian mind. Soviet foreign policy was
predictable and it was invariably antagonistic to the interests of the
West.
President Boris Yeltsin's angry outburst at the continuing Nato air
attacks on Bosnian Serb targets smacks of the bad old days of East-West
relations. He bluntly accused Nato of exceeding the United Nations
mandate and being a ''law unto itself'', and more significantly he
talked of Russia ''reconsidering'' its relations with the West if the
Nato air campaign in Bosnia was not called off.
Apparently, the Russian bear has not forgotten how to growl and he
would like it to be known that, if provoked, he is capable of slashing
the air with his claws.
But what are the Russians really up to? Does Boris Yeltsin seriously
want to get involved in the Balkan stew in order to end the bloodshed
and create a just peace? Or is he just trying to prop up his Slav
brothers while demonstrating to the West at the same time that the
Kremlin has still got political and military clout?
To be fair to the Kremlin policy makers, the Russian line on Bosnia
has been fairly consistent over the last year or so, and not just
because of the emotional Slavic bonds linking Russians and Serbs as
fellow Orthodox Christians.
Most prominent Russian politicians, and the entire military top brass,
simply do not see the Bosnian Serbs as aggressors. From their point of
view, Yugoslavia was as much a Serb empire as the Soviet Union was a
Russian one. As they see it, the Serbs are resisting a fragmentation of
their own territory and the West, protecting of course its own
interests, is trying to police it.
The Russians are particularly angry that the West appears to regard
the Balkans as an area where it can take military action and even shape
political settlements without consulting and bringing in Moscow as an
equal partner.
There is genuine resentment that the West seems not to take Moscow as
seriously now as when it was the enemy, the capital of a communist
superpower.
At the same time, the Russians are clearly shaken by the events which
have occurred before and after the 16-nation conference in London in
July which was intended to clarify the Western position. As could have
been predicted, the conference was hampered by the need to produce a
statement acceptable to all, including Russia.
The senior Russians at the conference, Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev
and, more importantly, Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, did not raise
serious objections to the Western allies taking a tough line in Bosnia.
However, they were strongly opposed to air strikes against the Bosnian
Serbs and were not prepared to put their names to an unambiguous
ultimatum.
Since then, Russia has seen the Croatian army not only rebuilt -- in
violation of a United Nations embargo -- but also drive thousands of
Serbs from their homes in the Krajina region. And, without so much as a
by-your-leave from the Russians, a Nato barrage has been unleashed on
the Serbs, which is something the United Nations has always said it
would not allow.
Yeltsin has tried hard to get into the act by promoting a summit in
Moscow for all the warring parties. It never got off the ground and
Russian diplomacy was clearly exposed as being of little or no
consequence.
This has rankled in Moscow, and Foreign Minister Kozyrev is being
sniped at from all sides. He voiced strong criticisms of Nato to British
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind in Moscow this week. Meanwhile, the
Russian press is full of stories about Nato declaring war on the Serbs,
Serb suffering, and Western hypocrisy.
A new force in Russian politics, General Alexsandr Lebed, has
strengthened his potential as a presidential candidate by accusing Nato
of trying to impose its will on Europe by its military intervention in
Bosnia.
Not surprisingly, Nato has rejected Yeltsin's criticisms of its action
in Bosnia and it remains a fact of life that Russia today is too weak to
determine what happens in the skies over Sarajevo. It is not seriously
believed that Yeltsin is poised to break the UN embargo on Serbia or
would dare give effective diplomatic or military support to the Bosnian
Serbs.
Nor is it in Russia's real interests to pursue anything but a
pro-Western foreign policy, as Yelstin is surely aware. The dynamic
changes in Russia mean that its future lies with the West and especially
with the United States, and, come to that, where else can it find other
allies?
For decades, Russia was Big Brother and pushed around whole nations.
Now the Kremlin has got to swallow its pride and accept that, until it
recovers its military and economic might -- probably not until well into
the next century -- it will have to put up with being little brother.

FEMALE politicians from around the world said today that women wanted
more say in politics, proclaiming that a world ruled by both sexes would
be more peaceful.
''Women still remain a rare species in the political arena,'' US
women's rights advocate Bella Abzug told a discussion of women and
global governance at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on
Women.
''Is it not time to admit that the dominant male political leadership
style has been a disaster?'' Abzug said, citing the war in Bosnia.
Women must be brought to the peace table, the trade negotiating table,
the boardroom table, and not just the kitchen table, she said. Abzug and
other speakers demanded that 50% of the political space be reserved for
women.
A meeting of 500 parliamentarians and other politicians from 90
countries met in Beijing's Great Hall of the People to pass a
declaration on female political participation which they said should be
adopted by all governments.
The UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) said gender discrimination
remained a formidable barrier to women's participation in formal
decision-making processes despite gains in recent years.
''There still is no country in the world where women enjoy political
status, access, or influence equal to that of men,'' it said. Women held
only 10% of parliament seats worldwide.
In most countries, women won the right to vote only within the last 30
years.
Only four percent of the ambassadors to the UN were women, it added.
UNIFEM's director, Noeleen Heyzer from Singapore, told the discussion
women should set their own agenda instead of adopting that of men.
''I think that we have been a part of other people's agenda and we
need to create our own agenda and bring the world onto that agenda,''
Heyzer said.

<HEADLINE>Miracle escape as car bomb blasts school. Faulty bell saves children from massacre.</HEADLINE>

NEARLY 700 children at a school in a suburb of Lyon came within
moments of a massacre today as a car bomb detonated just before they
were due to pass by.
The blast injured 14 people, one seriously.
Sources said police had arrested a man seen running from the scene of
the blast at Villeurbanne and that he was being questionned.
Thanks to a faulty school bell, which was two minutes late, the bomb
timed to go off at the very moment when children left school did not
result in the massacre intended.
Three children were overcome by smoke as fire spread to a nearby car
and building. Three others suffered shock.
Two shopkeepers and two parents waiting for pupils outside the school
were among the injured. One person suffered a broken arm.
Schoolteacher Colette Adad said classroom windows were shattered,
causing panic inside the city's main Jewish school.
''There was a very, very strong explosion with a powerful blast. Glass
panes crumbled around us, children had glass shards in their hair, they
panicked,'' she said.
''We all cried,'' one schoolboy said.
The car containing the device was parked just 15 yards from the
school's entrance.
Police later carried out a controlled detonation on a bag found in a
nearby school, but said it was not a second bomb.
''We can thank God that this attack did not cause total carnage,
because it happened at exactly the moment school gets out,'' Lyon's
deputy head rabbi Isaac Elhadad said.
It was the sixth attack in France in six weeks. The bombings have
killed seven people and wounded more than 100 in Paris.
Investigators suspect Algerian Muslim extremists of being behind the
recent Paris bombings which have targeted a Metro train, a tourist area
near the Arc de Triomphe and two open-air street markets.
Another bomb placed on a railway track just north of Lyon was defused
last month.
Authorities confirmed they had found nuts and bolts and fragments of a
gas canister at the scene, the same components as in the other recent
bomb attacks.
Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre said that although it was too soon
to be certain, ''it seems as though the elements permit us to suppose
all this is linked to the other attacks''.
He added: ''These people act like cowards. They feel they are being
tracked and they are moving around.
''Everything will be done and is being done to stop these criminals as
soon as possible.''
Prime Minister Alain Juppe called an emergency meeting of security
chiefs. He said he was indignant at what he called a cowardly and
heinous attack and urged citizens to be vigilant.

SENATOR Bob Packwood, one of the most powerful politicians in
Washington, resigned from the US Senate today rather than face possible
expulsion on charges of sexual and ethical misconduct.
''I am aware of the dishonour that has befallen me in the last three
years and I don't want to visit further that dishonour on the Senate,''
Packwood said in an emotional and hastily prepared speech on the Senate
floor.
He did not say when his resignation would take effect, but Senate
majority leader Bob Dole said he was sure senators would give him a
''reasonable'' period ''to get everything in order''.
Packwood, 62, an Oregon Republican, wielded great power as chairman of
the Senate Finance Committee, the pivotal panel for upcoming battles
with Democratic President Bill Clinton on the federal budget, spending
and taxes, and as a senior and relatively moderate leader of his party.
His resignation came 24 hours after the Senate Ethics Committee voted
unanimously to urge the Senate to expel him because of allegations of
sexual and ethical misconduct.
The charges, backed by more than 10,000 pages of detailed evidence by
the Ethics Committee, included forcing his affections on women who
worked for or with him and pressuring lobbyists to find a job for his
ex-wife.

THE photo-montage on the front page of the left-wing daily paper
Liberation showing a face, half that of Jacques Chirac and half that of
a hideously scarred burns victim, summed it up.
Nuclear tests in the Pacific are backfiring with a political vengeance
on the man who, last June, exercised his presidential prerogative by
ordering them to be carried out in the French atoll of Mururoa.
The wave of international protest this week as the first underground
bomb went off has shown that, worse than committing a crime, President
Chirac, as the saying goes, has made a mistake.
The President, the Government, and most of the right-wing majority in
the national assembly now have no choice but to dig in and weather the
storm, leaving diplomats in the French Foreign Office to worry about how
to repair the damage now being wreaked on French relations with Asian
and Pacific countries.
President Chirac made an unexpected concession earlier this week by
reducing the number of tests. It was rumoured in Paris yesterday that
these might even stop before the end of the year, instead of continuing
until May, 1996, as first planned. But the President has failed to
appease international opinion and any more giving in will entail a
terrible loss of face.
Prime Minister Alain Juppe has threatened international legal matters
if trade boycotts against France, of more symbolic than real importance,
continue. The first diplomatic fall-out of the tests, meanwhile, is
becoming evident.
President Chirac yesterday turned down an invitation from Japanese
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama to visit Toyko because of the hostile
attitude of ''some leading Japanese politicians'', according to the
Elysee, to French tests.
The President also refused last week to receive the visit of the
Swedish Prime Minister, partly because of a wrangle over extraditing a
suspected Islamic terrorist to France, but also because of Sweden's
clearly announced negative attitude to the Pacific explosions.
Writing in Le Figaro yesterday, General de Gaulle's former Minister
Alain Peyrefitte summed up the Gaullist line on nuclear testing better
than either President Chirac or Prime Minister Juppe (who
condescendingly described hostile reactions as ''hysterical'' this week)
could have done.
It was a masterly piece of defiant Gaullist pride -- or foolish,
obsolete arrogance. Referring to a ''Greenpeace media explosion''
(throughout the summer, right-wing opinion-makers in France have
caricatured anti-nuclear protest as the sole work of Greenpeace,
presenting the latter as ill-informed eccentrics), Mr Peyrefitte made
scathing mention of the organisation's inaccurate assessment of the
danger of the Shell platform.
Of this week's test, he wrote: ''France has not given in. Giving in
would have meant ruining our nuclear force, for dissuasion relies on
credibility which is psychological as much as technical. France has been
submitted to a psychological trial. She has passed with flying colours.
The President has not caved in to public clamour and discreet
pressure.''
Already hostile for the most part to a resumption of testing, French
public opinion has been shocked over recent days by the extent and the
violence of protests -- especially the demonstration in the Tahiti
capital of Papeete, which yesterday morning degenerated into widespread
looting and burning. Even the most stubborn patriots in France are
disturbed by it. ''If the Chinese can let off bombs, why can't we?'' is
the sort of remark often heard here.
President Francois Mitterrand let off more than 80 bombs in the
Pacific, more than even General de Gaulle, and presided 10 years ago
over the calamitous sinking of the Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior in
New Zealand, aimed at keeping the ecologists out of Mururoa.
France's nuclear independence is part of the legacy of General de
Gaulle, which President Chirac, elected in May, claims to have
inherited. Stepping down now would mean betraying the Gaullist
inheritance. European justification for the Pacific tests is thus the
Government's latest line of defence.
While Conservative politicians were worrying yesterday whether their
President was leading France not into solitary defiance but
international isolation (last night's Le Monde caricatured Mr Chirac
marooned on an island in the shape of a bomb), Prime Minister Juppe
stressed that France's strike force was necessary to protect Germany.
President Chirac's Gaullist friends, and the military chiefs whose
advice triggered his decision to resume testing, see France's nuclear
deterrent as complementing the growing economic strength of an ever more
dominant Germany. Which explains why some rumpus among Pacific countries
was thought an acceptable price to pay.
This much rumpus, however, is too much. Already ridiculed by the
catastrophic mistiming of the tests, announced just before the 50th
anniversary of Hiroshima, President Chirac is now coming under fire for
his serious misunderstanding of foreign affairs.
By assuming that new tests would provoke little more protest than
those carried out in 1991, just before the international ban of 1992
which France signed, the President has failed to recognise the enormous
growth of international ecology movements. He has ignored the
increasingly Asian and Pacific roles of Australia and New Zealand and
given independentists in France's Pacific possessions a new axe to
grind.
He has grossly underestimated the worldwide rejection of nuclear arms
that has developed after the end of the cold war. President Chirac, it
is being said, has been too busy trying to be President to see what is
going on in the big wide world.
Now the President's opponents will be able to accuse him of living
someone else's outdated Gaullist dream instead of inventing one in tune
with the contemporary world.

THE political fall-out from the Mururoa bomb test has spread to the
World Medical Association's 47th general assembly on the Indonesian
island of Bali.
The newly-installed president, Dr Jacques Moulin, will head a
delegation urging his old friend, French President Jacques Chirac, to
call halt the nuclear-test programme.
Only a compromise by Australasian delegates has averted a walkout by
their French counterparts, including Dr Moulin, secretary-general of the
Association Medicale Francaise.
An emergency motion submitted several weeks ago by the Australian and
New Zealand medical associations attacked France for pressing ahead with
its plans for the test. Dr Moulin took umbrage at the prospect of
France's name being dragged through the mud before the representatives
of three million doctors in 64 countries.
After a good deal of behind-the-scenes haggling, the Australasian
delegates agreed to France being dropped from the resolution. It was
then passed unanimously, deploring nuclear weapon testing in general,
calling for its abandonment without delay, and requesting all member
associations to advise their governments on the adverse health
consequences of nuclear weapons.
''National pride was involved when the French were named in the
original resolution and I think there was a personal element for Dr
Moulin. He and Jacques Chirac go back a long way,'' said a WMA source.

THE violent reaction in Tahiti to the resumption of French nuclear
testing is unlikely to last for long. Deep-rooted economic imperatives
militate against revolution in this tourist playground.
It was inevitable that the pro-independence movement led by Oscar
Temaru would seize on the nuclear blast at a remote atoll to publicise
its demands for an end to French rule. It was predictable that unruly
elements in its ranks would resort to destruction and looting. What is
less apparent is any desire among the majority of Tahitians to join them
in their anti-French campaign.
For the truth is that French Polynesia, of which Tahiti is the hub,
depends almost entirely on Paris for its economic survival.
Having been dragged into the twentieth century with a cataclysmic bang
on July 3, 1966, when the first atomic bomb was detonated in the
atmosphere above Mururoa, it has acquired a taste for Western
consumerism which only massive subsidies from France can satisfy.
The result is that Tahiti has become a mongrel society alternately
licking and snarling at the hand that feeds it. For decades, since the
turn of the century, it had been on a long leash and treated with benign
neglect by a remote French administration. That all changed in the 1960s
with the arrival of thousands of French soldiers, engineers, and
scientists to establish the Centre d'Experimentation du Pacifique (CEP),
which destroyed the last vestiges of Polynesian culture.
With them came the officials, the civil servants, the bankers, the
shopkeepers, and all the panoply of a colonial administration. All of
them had to be fed, housed, and entertained. They required local
workers, hundreds of them, to build military and civilian installations
in Tahiti and at the nuclear test sites in the Tuamotu archipelago.
Suddenly Tahitian households were acquiring televisions, hi-fi
systems, big cars, and powerful speedboats. No more fishing in the
lagoon, or gathering bananas. It was into the big new supermarkets for
French delicacies or nights out in the smart restaurants of Papeete.
It is essentially those who were left behind by the economic and
social upheaval that formed the nucleus of the independence movement,
now flexing its muscles in Tahiti. It is no accident that the scene of
some of the most violent demonstrations, at the island's international
airport, is in the municipality administered by Mr Temaru.
However, French patronage has created a substantial Tahitian
middle-class, as well as a few millionaires, who have little to gain and
everything to lose from a French withdrawal. If Paris was to pull the
plug on its Polynesian possessions, their privileged life-styles would
go with it.
The dilemma was explained to me during a recent visit to Tahiti by a
local schoolteacher. ''We lament the loss of a traditional way of life
in which we had less possessions, but we were richer in so many other
ways. Now it's all money, money, money, and you can't have anything
unless you pay for it.
''But there's no looking back, now. It's all very well shouting about
getting rid of the French, but who will pay for our education, our
health services, and all our imports after they have gone? The prices of
vahine and coconuts are not good on the world market any more.''
It is a sentiment that is widely shared on this island, which lost its
innocence and its identity many years ago.
The last time Polynesians made a serious stand against Paris was in
1844, when almost 1000 Tahitian warriors assembled at Mahaena on the
east coast of the island to rebel against French annexation. Assisted by
a few British sailors and French army deserters, they dug three trenches
more than one mile long and calmly waited for the enemy to arrive.
The French duly dispatched two warships, whose firepower was decisive
in routing the rebels after a day of close-quarter fighting with French
marines. When the smoke cleared, more than 100 Tahitians lay dead. The
French casualties were reported as 15 dead and 51 wounded.
It was Polynesia's Culloden, but no monument was ever raised to the
natives who fought to preserve their independence. The only emblem at
the site is a French flag flying from the local Mairie. It is likely to
continue flying for a long time yet.

PACIFIC nations have put Britain on notice that Mr Major risks
isolation at this November's Commonwealth summit over his refusal to
condemn the testing.
From Nauru to New Zealand, Pacific members of the Commonwealth have
united against France's decision.
Britain has been one of the few world powers not to condemn Paris,
saying only that the tests are a French affair.
The summit is in New Zealand, and New Zealand High Commissioner to
Britain, John Collinge, said: ''French nuclear testing will clearly be
on the agenda.''
He added: ''There's a determination to make the Heads of Commonwealth
meeting a real one dealing with real subjects. It will therefore grapple
with all these difficult issues.''
Australia said London could expect a dressing down, even if many still
considered it king of the old Empire club.
Unless Mr Major changed his tune, he would find himself ''in a
minority of one in a discussion which is bound to be pretty heated'', Mr
Gordon Bilney, Australia's minister for Pacific Island Affairs, said.
''Some forms of isolation aren't that splendid, some forms of
isolation may indeed be ill-advised,'' said Mr Bilney, who is heading a
delegation in Europe to protest against the testing.
''It is absolutely clear that there will be a robust discussion of
this issue high up on the agenda of the Commonwealth.''
A spokesman for Mr Major refused to comment on the issue.

LYNN Main, 38, was sentenced to 180-hours' community service at
Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday when she admitted possessing 200g of
amphetamines worth more than #3000 at Broomhouse Place South last
November 11. Main's solicitor told the court that she was holding the
drugs for her daughter's boyfriend, and was unaware of the quantity, the
third largest find in Lothian last year.

AN ELDERLY man who sexually abused a young girl had his two-year
prison sentence cut in half by appeal court judges yesterday.
Stroke victim Alexander Blair, 68, fondled and kissed the 11-year-old
girl and committed sex acts with her.
The child already had suffered abuse by someone else when Blair
molested her in August last year.
However, the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh decided that the
sentence of two years' imprisonment passed on him by Sheriff Andrew
Murphy was too harsh and reduced it to 12 months.
First offender Blair, of Skene Street, Bonnybridge, admitted a charge
of lewd, libidinous and indecent behaviour towards the girl when he
appeared at Falkirk Sheriff Court.
Blair spent some time in prison after Sheriff Murphy jailed him,
before being released on bail pending his appeal.
His counsel, Mr Murdo MacLeod, told the appeal judges that Blair had
not found the prison regime difficult because he was used to discipline
from his army days.
However, he had encountered problems because of his state of health.
He was hard of hearing and had medical problems following a stroke three
years ago.
Mr MacLeod said that a psychologist's report on Blair had concluded
that he did not pose a threat to children. Blair was very ashamed of
what he had done and pleased that he had been caught, Mr MacLeod added.

A MAJOR survey carried out on behalf of the United Kingdom Offshore
Operators' Association indicates that the environmental impact of
disposing of oil installations is negligible, no matter what method is
used.
The results of the study, carried out by Dr Gordon Picken, of Auris
(Aberdeen University Research Industrial Services Ltd), also showed
there was little to choose between the options on a strictly
environmental basis, as long as international conventions were followed.
Dr Picken said: ''If you were to decommission structures according to
present international conventions in terms of the kinds of materials you
may or may not be permitted to leave in the sea, then most of the
options have only negligible or minor impact.
''There are no options with major or moderate impact. You cannot
separate them out. There is none that appears particularly bad or
particularly good. They are all pretty much the same and provide a
low-level of environmental impact.''
On that basis, he said, it was likely that the risk to people,
technical difficulty, and cost might be more significant factors in
deciding on the most appropriate option.
Dr Picken said: ''Brent Spar wasn't part of the study but I would say
that, given the structure of Brent Spar and the amount of contaminants
everyone appears to believe is on board, we would say that the amount of
impact caused by the disposal in deep sea would be negligible.''
Dr Picken is an advocate of the creation of artificial reefs, but he
said that latticed installations such as steel jackets were most
suitable. Although Brent Spar would attract fish, he did not believe it
suitable as an artificial reef.
Last night, the director general of UKOOA, Dr Harold Hughes, said:
''We welcome the findings of the study as a valuable and independent
contribution to the ongoing debate.
''It is important that such serious decisions are taken on the basis
of sound and comprehensive scientific understanding and evidence. This
study should make a significant contribution to policy on this issue.''

HYDRO-ELECTRIC, the smaller of Scotland's power companies, is to shed
about 300 jobs by early 1997, it was announced yesterday.
The cut, mainly among power systems engineers and customer services
areas -- including meter readers and billings and collections staff --
will reduce the company's workforce to about 3200 from a peak
pre-privatisation total in 1989 of 3950.
Hydro-Electric is hopeful that the cuts can be achieved on a voluntary
basis ''wherever possible''. It insisted that the move was necessary as
part of a restructuring which would accompany a three-year #100m
investment in its power network to improve reliability.
Chief executive Mr Roger Young said yesterday: ''We are committed to
reducing prices to our customers in real terms. At the same time, we
have to fund major investment in the north of Scotland electricity
infrastructure, for the benefit of our community.''
The company said that job numbers had remained static after a 14%
cutback in its workforce in 1989 and 1990 in the run-up to
privatisation.
Mr Allan Cowan, secretary of the GMB trade union's joint industrial
council, covering Scottish Hydro jobs, said: ''We are naturally
disappointed when jobs have to go within any particular industry.
''But we welcome the fact that Hydro-Electric has revealed its
intentions in the longer term. This will allow us to talk objectively
about how to address the proposed job losses.''
Labour Trade and Industry spokesman Brian Wilson questioned whether
the real loser would be the customer. He said that the announcement was
''driven by demands for cost-cutting'' which emanated from the ''frenzy
of uncertainty'' now gripping the privatised utilities.
The MP for Cunninghame North said: ''I do not believe that you can
have such a number of redundancies in a scattered area like the North of
Scotland without serious implications for the quality of service.''

<TEXT>
FIVE years on from Lord Cullen's recommendations following the 1988
Piper Alpha disaster, tremendous progress has been made on improving
safety, but there still are many challenges to face, the conference was
told.
Mr Roderick Allison, chief executive of the Offshore Safety Division
of the Health and Safety Executive, said that Lord Cullen's report was a
landmark in the application of modern thinking to health and safety in
an industry with the potential for large accidents.
Since then, enormous strides had been made towards making the
systematic management of safety a priority for everyone in the industry.
Legislation had been greatly simplified and improved, and greater
confidence had been created in the safety system.
Mr Allison said the most significant change in the last five years had
been the introduction of the safety care regime, a central Cullen
recommendation.
It was HSE policy to evaluate all new legislation and it was currently
making a first evaluation of the Safety Case Regulations (SCR) by means
of internal and external studies and good signs were emerging.
''An independent survey carried out in early 1995 showed that SCR are
overwhelmingly seen as having a positive impact on safety,'' he said.
''The safety case process has heightened awareness of risks and the
need for management of them, both in management and in the workforce.''
Mr Allison added: ''Greater workforce involvement is widely seen as a
key area of change associated with the safety case process, and there is
a strong perception among workers that more attention is now paid to
safety compared with pre-1988.''
He said the challenges to confront included the Cost Reduction
Initiative for the New Era (CRINE). ''Some people tend to think of
safety in terms of added costs but in fact effective safety management
can increase efficiency and reduce costs. But, having said that, we do
need to keep watch to ensure that cost-cutting does not compromise
safety.''

Graeme Smith reports from the Offshore Europe Conference in Aberdeen
A TEXAS manufacturer is to build a #4.5m plant in Peterhead to produce
a revolutionary coiled steel tubing for the oil industry.
After examining 20 locations throughout Europe, Precision Tube
Technology has opted for Peterhead, despite far greater financial
incentives elsewhere.
Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch described the decision as ''a
milestone in the further development of Grampian as the offshore
technology centre of Europe.''
The Peterhead Mill will be the biggest in the world, and the only one
outside Texas. It will be built at the ASCO base at Peterhead.
Precision Tube Technology is one of only two companies in the world
producing long-length continuous weld pipe -- high-quality steel pipe
which is coiled around drums, not cast in sections.
About 40 jobs are planned over the next three years. The company
expects this number to rise as demand for the coiled tubing grows.
''New capacity at Peterhead combined with new product developments
will enable Precision to maintain its position as the leader in coiled
tubing production worldwide,'' said Mr Larry Smith, company president
''We are delighted with the assistance we have received from Grampian
Regional Council, Locate in Scotland and their partners.''
He expected that Aberdeen, as well as servicing the North Sea, would
export to North Africa and the Middle East. Precision's customers were
major service companies: Shell, Amoco, and BP are all now re-engineering
their processes to take advantage of the product.
''This type of development really feeds growth throughout a region and
I think you are going to see in the next year or two a good
infrastructure develop as a result.'' "
Mr Smith said the steel would come from either Europe or Japan. The
company plans to recruit staff locally and train them in the US.
''This is excellent news for Peterhead and for Scotland,'' Mr Kynoch
said. ''It will position Grampian firmly at the leading edge of this
fast developing technology.
''Aberdeen is widely acknowledged as the oil capital of Europe and a
base at Peterhead will provide the company with ready access to many of
its largest customers.
'' This is the first step in the further progress of this part of
Scotland,'' he added.

GLAXO, the world's biggest drug company after its #9000m takeover of
Wellcome earlier in the year, expects to make 7500 redundancies
worldwide by December 1998 as a result of the merger.
About 3000 of the job losses already have been announced, with 1700 in
the UK. The review of manufacturing sites, including Montrose and Annan
which employ 700 and 200 respectively, is continuing although there are
to be no closures of such sites in the UK.
The Wellcome research facility at Beckenham in Kent is to shut down,
with many of the staff transferred to Glaxo's new Medicine Research
Centre at Stevenage in Hertfordshire. Glaxo's headquarters in central
London is also to close.
Unions and Labour condemned the job losses. The Manufacturing Science
and Finance union, the largest union at Glaxo, said the move confirmed
its worst fears. ''These job losses will come as a tremendous blow to
Glaxo workers and their families,'' said Labour Employment spokeswoman
Harriet Harman.
Mr John Dorward, economic development convener at Tayside Regional
Council, said he was ''confident'' for the future of the Glaxo plant in
the Angus town. Mr Dorward, who represents a Montrose ward on the
council, said: ''With the communications we have had with the company in
the past, the UK job losses would only affect Montrose to the tune of 55
workers. Glaxo is the main employer in the town. It would be a disaster
if there were any further redundancies.''
He added: ''Our relations with Glaxo are first class and they've been
informing us from the beginning. I'm confident for the future of Glaxo
in Montrose. It's already been defined by GLaxo and Wellcome that it is
part and parcel of their future.''
Glaxo Wellcome will cut 10% of its workforce in the UK by the end of
1998 under the plans, the company said. The cuts will affect sites
across the country, hitting research and development, manufacturing,
sales and administration staff.
The company admitted there will be compulsory redundancies. Finance
director John Coombe said it would continue to search for efficiencies
at its UK sites. Of the 7500 jobs being cut, 40% will be in
manufacturing, 35% in administration and 25% in research and
development.
The total cost of integrating Glaxo and Wellcome is estimated to be
#1200m of which #700m will be spent in the current financial year. About
#800m of the total cost relates to redundancies.
In the 12 months to June 30, 1995, the combined business made a
pre-tax profit of #1558m on sales of #6472m. This was despite having to
pay bigger discounts to US wholesale customers and price cuts imposed by
European governments, notably in Italy and Germany, to try to stem
growth in their helathcare budgets.
Wellcome contributed sales of #628m and profits of #204m. Money
borrowed to buy Wellcome has already been repaid and the financial
position of Glaxo Wellcome is strong. Shareholders are to receive a
second interim dividend of 20p increasing the total payout for the year
by 11% to 30p. Glaxo Wellcome shares rose 8[1/2]p to 795[1/2]p.
The full integration costs are expected to be recouped by the end of
1997 from increased sales and efficiency gains in all areas of the
business, including manufacturing and research and development.
Zantac, Glaxo's anti-ulcer treatment, remains the world's biggest
selling prescription medicine, although in recent years it has faced
mounting competition from cheaper generic products and a new type of
product known as a proton pump inhibitor which is gaining market share.
Last year, Zantac's sales declined by 3%, compared with earlier
estimates of a 5% drop. At #2310m it still accounted for 36% of Glaxo
Wellcome's total sales.

A PLAN to create a forest at Craigmillar, as part of the proposed
#100m Millennium Forest for Scotland, received the support of Edinburgh
District Council planning committee yesterday.
A bid for funding support has been submitted to the Millennium
Commission. It is planned to restore Scotland's native forest, enhance
the wildlife habitat and provide a recreational and educational
resource.
Of 90 projects submitted so far, the Forest of Craigmillar is one of
only three selected for further scrutiny. The estimated cost of the
Craigmillar forest is #375,350. The Millennium Fund would provide
#188,000; the Forestry Authority, #64,350 in the form of a woodland
grant; Lothian Regeneration Fund, #3000, and the local authority
#120,000, spread over two years.

A HEALTH board named in a planning application for a controversial
clinical waste treatment plant yesterday denied any involvement with the
project.
An arrangement to deal with Greater Glasgow's hospital waste --
including used dressings, human body parts, and used needles -- forms
part of the basis of a planning application for the plant in Clydebank.
The company involved, AAH Environmental Services, had been involved in
a tendering process to provide a disposal plant in Cumbernauld, but that
fell through.
Yesterday, the board confirmed it was on the verge of signing a
contract with Dundee District Council to have Glasgow's 15 tons per day
clinical waste burned at the Baldovie incinerator, where, as The Herald
disclosed last week, it may be be used to generate electricity.
''I can say categorically that we have not offered AAH any contract,''
said a spokeswoman. ''They are not in the picture.''
AAH, which said that 13 new jobs would be created, claimed it had been
awarded a contract from Greater Glasgow Health Board to dispose of waste
from 27 hospitals.
Meanwhile, community groups in Clydebank said they would block any
moves by AAH to build the plant locally. Ironically, the plan is to
build the plant opposite the controversial HCI private hospital, the
scene of another major planning battle.
The tenant associations' link-up was agreed after Clydebank Councillor
Mary Campbell addressed angry residents at a meeting of Dalmuir and
Mountblow Community Council.
The Loughborough-based company wants to open Britain's first microwave
treatment centre -- a system designed to kill off harmful bacteria in
waste by exposure to temperatures of 100C -- next to a park specifically
established for pensioners and hospital patients.
AAH claims that only low-grade hospital waste, laboratory refuse, and
needles and syringes would be processed while more harmful materials,
including radioactive waste, human limbs, and tissue, would be kept in
the transfer stores until taken to an off-site incinerator.
According to the company's planning application, waste treated at the
proposed Dalmuir site would be disposed of at Paterson's landfill site
on Glasgow's London Road.
A spokesman for AAH said that 40 similar plants were in operation in
the United States and that the process complied with Scottish Centre for
Infection and Environmental Health guidance.

YARROW managing director Murray Easton, who resigned 10-days ago, has
changed his mind and is to stay on at the Clydeside yard.
He will remain during one of the most crucial periods for the warship
builder as it awaits a decision on whether it has won a job-saving #200m
order for three frigates for the Royal Navy.
Even if the work is awarded to Yarrow in November, it will not come in
time to prevent some workers being laid off because of a gap in the work
programme.
Mr Easton's withdrawal of his resignation was announced in a short
statement with no further explanation. Mr Ian Jackson, personnel manager
at Yarrow, refused to comment further on Mr Easton's change of mind.
However, it is believed that it came after a meeting earlier this week
with Mr Brian George, who joined GEC in July to head its Yarrow and VSEL
subsidiaries.
Mr Easton took over from his father, Sir Bob Easton, in 1991.
The yard, Scotland's only warship builder, is currently working on
five frigates, two for Malaysia and three for the Royal Navy. They are
due for completion next year which will leave the company with an empty
order book. World wide efforts are being made to win new work.
GEC, Yarrow's parent company, earlier this year gave assurances that
the yard would remain in operation for at least seven years, ''provided
it remained profitable.'' Last year, it made a profit of #11.6m on a
turnover of #204m.
In an interview broadcast on Scottish Television's Scotland Today
programme last night, Mr Easton said: ''I am a part of Yarrow
Shipbuilders, along with the rest of the employees, and feel very close
to the employees and the company and its future.
''I do to Glasgow, I do to Scotland, and to contemplate giving all
that up was a monster step for me and one I did agonise over.''

A #14m retail park development, which is expected to create about 600
jobs, is to be built in Glasgow's East End, completing the third main
phase of the Forge complex at Parkhead, it was announced yesterday.
Mr Paul Green, chairman of the Glasgow-based Ramjet Developments Ltd,
said construction work on the 140,000 sq. ft development would begin
next week and is expected to be completed by next August. Eleven
companies, including Focus DIY and What Everyone Wants, have so far been
lined up for the retail development.
He claimed that the Forge Shopping Centre, which was built in 1984 on
the once barren, post-industrial wasteland of the former Beardmore steel
manufacturing plant, had proved the doubters wrong by becoming one of
Glasgow's major ''retail success stories''. It now employs more than
1200 and attracts some 350,000 shoppers weekly.
Councillor Jean McFadden, convener of the new Glasgow City Council,
speaking at the opening yesterday of the new Forge Indoor Market, said
that while the Glasgow Eastern Area Renewal (GEAR) project had been
commendable in tidying up the east end of the city -- building new
houses and renovating older houses -- it basically had ''just got people
better street corners to stand at''.
Councillor McFadden added: ''What was needed was jobs. The Forge
development had provided those jobs.''
Meanwhile, a Texas manufacturer is to build a #4.5m plant in Peterhead

AYR yesterday became the latest Scottish town to launch a
closed-circuit TV surveillance system to improve security for traders,
local residents, and visitors.
At the launch, it was disclosed that in the setting-up phase of the
operation a substantial number of crimes, including theft,
housebreaking, and public disorder, have already been detected.
Local authorities and Enterprise Ayrshire joined private firms in
funding the #215,000 system, which will use 11 cameras operated around
the clock by civilians to monitor key locations within the town centre.
One of the early ''stars'' of the new system was the Queen, who
appeared on the cameras as they were used to assist security and crowd
control on her summer visit.
Mr Sunil Varu, Ayr town centre manager and a major driving force
behind the system, said: ''The cameras provide extensive coverage of the
town centre area and are already paying dividends in not only detecting
crime but also giving the general public the confidence in visiting the
town centre, which is one of the prime objectives.
''I am in no doubt that the cameras will help to remove the
fear-of-crime factor which so often damages towns.''
Other Scottish towns and cities have followed the lead set by Airdrie
several years ago in installing surveillance systems, which have paid
dividends in reducing crime.

A CONSULTANT, who was disciplined for refusing to hand over another
doctor's medical records to a health board general manager, has been
cleared on the issue.
Dr David Breen, 41, said last night: ''I'm delighted with the result.
The case hinged on the vital issue of confidentiality.''
Dr Breen, consultant in public health medicine with the regional
health board, was given a verbal warning after he refused to hand over
records relating to Dr David Clow, a consultant paediatrician with
Dumfries and Galloway Community Health Trust.
The board's general manager, Mr Derek Banks, wanted them in connection
with Dr Clow's disciplinary hearing which resulted in his dismissal. Dr
Breen appealed and this was upheld by a board committee and ratified in
private by the full board yesterday.
Mr Banks told the board: ''We respect medical records. But this was to
do with board personnel files that may contain some medical
information.''
The board's chief administrative medical officer, Dr Iain MacLean,
said later: ''There is a clear Scottish Office instruction on this
issue. It states quite clearly that an employee's personal files cannot
be handed over to an employer if they contain any medical and personal
health information.''
Dr Clow is appealing to Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth on the
grounds of unfair dismissal. The Trust, in its letter of dismissal, made
it clear there was no criticism of his clinical ability. It concerned
his alleged personal conduct.

THE death of a five-year-old boy under the wheel of an ice-cream van
was a tragic accident, a sheriff has decided.
Sheriff Roger Craik QC issued his written findings yesterday after a
two-day fatal accident inquiry into Mark Smith's death.
The boy suffocated because of pressure on his chest when he was
trapped under the van's back wheel near his home.
Mark, of Great Carleton Square, Niddrie. Edinburgh, and his friend,
Peter Quinn, nine, ran to the van as it arrived in Great Carleton Place
on the evening of September 26 last. Driver Mr James Hadden, 23, from
Newtongrange, said that he noticed in his wing mirror that Mark was
running along the kerb beside the van as it drew up at about 5 mph.
He then saw that Mark seemed to have fallen, so he braked and got out
of the van. The boy was pinned by the rear nearside wheel and Mr
Hadden's efforts to push the van off him failed.
Eventually, passers-by, using a length of wood as a lever, and two
police officers were able to lift the van and drag the boy clear, but it
was too late.
The suggestion from Peter Quinn that Mr Hadden had reversed over the
child after he dropped his money and reached under the van to get it,
was rejected by Sheriff Craik.
The sheriff said that matters such as the restricted rear view of
ice-cream vans, whether or not they should be fitted with reversing
alarms, and the need for driver training, were all matters of legitimate
concern, although none of those applied directly to this particular
accident.

LOCAL authorities facing cutbacks in education expenditure should have
no fears about funding in future, Scottish Education Minister Raymond
Robertson said yesterday.
He insisted there was no reason to suggest that any cutbacks would
have an impact on the system, and emphasised that recent initiatives in
Scottish education would help equip young people to face up to the
challenges of the future.
Speaking at Wardie Primary School, Edinburgh -- while launching an
education document which covers work being done by schools throughout
Scotland -- he said that local authorities must look to their budgets,
but he believed that if they could achieve savings it would not be
detrimental to the education system.
The Wardie school, with 400 pupils, is currently involved in a number
of environmental projects, and the Minister said he was impressed by
what he had seen, with pupils appreciating an awareness of the
environment, and proud of their own achievements.
''This is education in its widest sense,'' said Mr Robertson, a former
teacher in Dumbarton.
He warned, nevertheless, that while education in Scotland was held in
high regard, it would be wrong to become complacent, stating: ''I have a
vision for the future of Scottish education -- one which equips our
young people in the best possible way for the undoubted challenges which
they will face as we prepare to enter the next millennium.''

<HEADLINE>Sheriff dismisses drug link in prison suicide</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A SHERIFF ruled yesterday that a blood sample from a prisoner found
hanging in his cell could have been mixed up with another sample,
leading a toxicology laboratory to find that he had a fatal dose of
heroin in his blood.
Thief John Allan, 24, was found dead in his cell at Barlinnie prison
last December. At a fatal accident inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court
yesterday, Sheriff A G Johnston was told that Allan was not a drug user,
and no evidence of drugs had been found in his cell.
The sheriff, therefore, dismissed a suggestion that Allan, of
Gowanhill Gardens, Raploch, Stirling, may have been used as a ''depot''
for storing heroin-filled condoms, and that one may have burst at the
moment he hung himself.
Sheriff Johnston heard that the toxicology laboratory had received
blood samples from two post-mortem examinations, one from Allan and
another from an unnamed man who was HIV positive.
The sheriff concluded that the most likely explanation for the fatal
dose of heroin in Allan's blood was that the two samples had been mixed
up.
In his written findings, the sheriff described how the evidence of the
blood samples had thrown the apparently routine circumstances of a
prison suicide into disarray.
The day before Allan died, a prison officer caught him in the cell --
which he had shared just before his death with his brother -- ''shooting
a line'' out of the window -- the prison term for dropping a piece of
string from one cell to another so that items can be passed between
prisoners. The line had an empty coke bottle attached to it, and John
Allan was put on report.
He was taken to another cell, but was found next morning hanging from
a rope made of strips of sheets.
After the post-mortem examination, a a pathologist sent off a blood
sample for a routine toxicological examination. It was found to contain
a morphine level consistent with a fatal dose of heroin.
However, the pathologist could find no injection marks on Allan's
body, and no needle or any other clue was found in his cell.
The sheriff said: ''The only explanation which could in my view have
possibly fitted in with all the circumstances was that the blood
analysis was erroneous.
''With that result discounted, there was no doubt that the cause of
death was hanging and that it was suicide.''

<HEADLINE>Kirk attacked over Cardinal</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Church of Scotland has come under attack from the Free
Presbyterian Church for allowing a senior Roman Catholic churchman to
address the General Assembly.
The appearance of Cardinal Thomas Winning at the Free Church Assembly
on the same day also has been criticised.
In May, the Cardinal received a warm ovation when he told 1200 Kirk
commissioners about his vision of Protestants and Roman Catholics
sitting down together in a Scottish Christian Assembly.
However, the Free Presbyterian Church is fervently opposed to closer
links.
It claims the Cardinal's vision would result in the nation being
brought back ''to the gross darkness from which it was mercifully
delivered at the Reformation''.
In its monthly magazine, the Rev. Neil Ross, of Dingwall, attacks the
Kirk's ''departure from the old paths''.
He describes Cardinal Winning as ''the principal representative in
Scotland of a system which is the inveterate foe of the Reformed
Faith.''
The new Moderator of the General Assembly, the Rev James Harkness, is
criticised for telling Cardinal Winning he was ''welcome as a brother in
Christ''.
Mr Ross says: ''He fails to realise that Rome, in her ecumenical
activities, is not going to depart from her position, whatever might be
the appearances to the contrary.''
Following his appearance at the General Assembly, the Cardinal walked
across the road to visit the Free Church Assembly.
''His appearance at the Free Church Assembly was reported to have
'happened by accident, but it was evidently a planned accident,'' says
Mr Ross.

A LICENSING board chairman warned yesterday that the sale of designer
drinks to under-age young people is a time-bomb ready to destroy their
health.
Glasgow Licensing Board is planning a campaign in a bid to tackle the
problem, claiming that some of the drinks can be as strong as fortified
lagers, they are often stored beside soft drinks and they are
attractively packaged to attract the younger market.
The board has introduced a policy requiring all licence- holders to be
assessed and trained to ensure they have a working knowledge of
licensing legislation and are aware of their responsibilities in
relation to the sale of alcohol.
They are also considering criteria relating to the lay-out of
off-sales and the positioning of alcoholic products, including designer
drinks, within the premises so that they cannot be confused with soft
drinks and their sale is properly controlled.
Licensing chairman James Coleman said: ''What we have on our hands is
a time-bomb. Our young people are putting their health and future
well-being at risk and it is up to us to protect them.''
However, when the board asked for support, the Scottish Office said
Government action would be to continue educating young people about the
risks of alcohol misuse.
Councillor Coleman said: ''We feel very let down by the response from
the Scottish Office to our request for support in dealing with the
problem.
''We feel the Government should bring in legislation to ban the
advertising of these products, or at the very least to control the
content of the adverts.
''We are extremely disappointed at the view taken by the Scottish
Office that the advertising of these products should be a matter for the
Advertising Standards Authority and not for the Government.''
Referring to designer drinks in its response, the Scottish Office said
it would be virtually impossible to disprove the claims of the drinks
companies concerned that they are targeting only those young people who
are legally entitled to drink.
Research into designer drinks, commissioned by the Scottish Office and
funded by the Health Education Board for Scotland, is currently being
carried out at Strathclyde University.
A spokeswoman for the Health Education Board said: ''The research is
in the very early stages and we do not expect a report until next
February.''

* ROB ROBERTSON writes: A Government report yesterday highlighted
shortcomings in community care plans for people with drugs and alcohol
problems in Scotland.
It recommended that more guidance and training in the preparation of
these plans should be provided.
Among the key shortcomings highlighted were a lack of basic data upon
which services were planned, particularly needs assessment and data on
service provision.
Concerns were also raised over what consultation mechanisms were in
place for local authorities and non-statutory sectors to discuss issues.
Although monitoring and evaluation procedures were recognised as
essential, they were lacking in the current set-up.
The findings of the report, compiled by Professor John Davies and two
colleagues, will be circulated to the new unitary authorities.

THE owners of a Lanarkshire nursing home intend to sue the BBC for
defamation over a Frontline Scotland television documentary that alleged
''appalling'' standards of care.
Lawyers for Orchard House, Crossford, said last night: ''It has always
been and remains the intention of the proprietors to raise an action of
defamation against the BBC following the broadcast.''
A defamation action has already been raised in the Court of Session by
Mr Raymond Baigent and his wife, Margaret, the home owners, against two
former employees who appeared in the documentary.
In the programme, five nurses -- no longer at the home -- alleged that
residents suffered numerous indignities.
Lanarkshire Health Board, after an inquiry, confirmed this week that
it would allow the home to remain open.
A number of ''deficiencies'' were noted, but it is understood the
central allegations -- that patients suffered horrific mental or
physical abuse -- were dismissed.
Secretly-filmed footage was at its most disturbing when showing a man
allegedly confined to a ''restricter'' chair for up to 24 hours a day
and at risk of strangulation.
The man's daughter, Ms Lilias McAdam, of St Nicholas Road,
Lanarkshire, confirmed yesterday that he still was an Orchard House
resident.
She said: ''Although the health board's report may not be glowing, we
are quite happy with the situation. There is nothing at Orchard House
that causes us concern.''
The BBC has admitted that some film shots, purported to illustrate
scenes at the home, were not filmed there.
However, Frontline editor Mr Neil McDonald said he was pleased that
the health board's report, which has not been published, appeared to
substantiate many of the allegations of poor standards of care made in
the programme.
A spokeswoman for Glasgow law firm Maxwell Waddell and Company last
night claimed that the home owners had been ''the victims of a campaign
of false allegations by disaffected former members of staff''.
A spokesman for the BBC said any action would be ''vigorously
defended''.
Last night, Strathclyde Police were adamant that no inquiries were
under way into allegations of abuse at the home.

EDINBURGH District Council said last night it would continue to
consider applications for licences from sauna parlour owners despite
abandoning a court battle to have one particular sauna licensed.
There had been controversy over its decision to grant a licence to the
Gemini sauna in Iona Street near Leith Walk. The move was opposed by a
local resident, Ms Debra Scanlan, 29, whose successful court action
shelved the council's approval.
Council officials will today advise the licensing committee to abandon
the appeal against that decision, due to be heard at the Court of
Session.
The licensing committee chairman, Mr Dickie Alexander, said last
night: ''Despite our decision to abandon the appeal there is nothing to
stop us considering applications from other saunas.
''In fact other saunas are up for new licences soon and we will
consider them.
''The decision not to proceed with the appeal over the Gemini sauna
was taken on cost grounds. When you think it would cost around #1000 a
day for a QC you can see how expensive it is.
''I do not believe this was a test-case which will effect other
applications coming in.''
Ms Scanlan was unavailable for comment last night.

A YOUNG student who battered two massage parlour girls during a
three-in-a-bed sex session was jailed for a year yesterday.
Barry Ferguson, 23, brutally attacked the girls then fled half-naked
from the massage parlour, a court heard. As he tried to run away, a gang
of young boys ran after him along the street.
Ferguson, an engineering student, , of Redpath Drive, Falkirk, had
admitted assaulting the girls in Bubbles at Grahams Road, Falkirk, on
March 1.
Procurator-fiscal George Scott said the two victims were treated in
hospital for head injuries.
The court heard that reports showed Ferguson was not mentally ill.
However, there was a suggestion that he had been drinking or had taken
''something else''.
Sheriff Andrew Murphy said he was disturbed that Ferguson did not seem
to understand the effects of his attack. He told him he could find no
mitigating circumstances and jailed him for a year.
At last month's hearing, depute procurator-fiscal Sarah Livingstone
told the court that Bubbles was ''ostensibly a massage parlour'' but
was, in effect, a brothel.
She said Ferguson had visited the establishment on earlier occasions
but this was the first time he had two girls in the one room.
Ms Livingstone said: ''He was engaged in sexual activity with the two
women in a state of undress.'' She added that he then ''rained down
blows on both of them'' with a blunt instrument he had taken into the
parlour.
The girls had no idea what caused the vicious attack, the fiscal said.
''He had visited the place before and there had been no trouble.''

FORMER Scottish Secretary Ian Lang last night weighed into the
devolution debate with a blistering attack on Labour policy.
Speaking in Glasgow, on his first public engagement north of the
Border since becoming President of the Board of Trade, Mr Lang described
Labour's social and economic policies as the ''four horsemen of the
Apocalypse''.
He chose the Scottish CBI's annual dinner to warn that a separate
Scottish parliament in Edinburgh would mean higher taxation, increased
bureaucracy and greater intervention.
''The constitutional upheaval and instability that would flow from
such a move would be damaging and unsettling to business,'' Mr Lang
said. ''But it would not stop there. Labour would give this parliament
power to tax people living and working in Scotland higher than in any
other part of the United Kingdom.''
Mr Lang also raised the possibility of Treasury purse strings being
tightened as a direct consequence of greater independence. He said
Scotland presently enjoyed a significantly higher share of public
expenditure than was justified by its population share or by the share
of revenue it raised for the Exchequer.
He added: ''But these misguided plans, by weakening Scotland's
influence both at Westminister and Whitehall and by giving a Scottish
parliament tax-raising powers, would undoubtedly undermine Scotland's
ability to secure present levels of public expenditure -- it would be
wrong and misleading to pretend otherwise.''
Mr Lang described what he called a ''story of success'' for British
industry, achieved in a stable environment partly created by the
Government. He said the Conservatives had cut business taxes,
deregulated markets, liberalised industrial relations and employment
practices and given help to businesses in crucial areas.
Mr Lang went on to describe his four cornerstones of success as:
utilising the science base; maximising trade and exports; better
management and benchmarking and a more flexible labour force. He urged
Scottish businesses to avoid ''another bout of socialism, even one that
comes in a glossy adman's packaging.''
The Minister also rounded on a range of Labour policies including
''the minimum wage, the Social Chapter, the threat to the uniform
business rate and the Scottish parliament'' saying: ''These are not four
cornerstones of success; they are more like the four horsemen of the
Apocalypse''.
Labour's Trade and Industry spokesman Brian Wilson described Mr Lang's
speech as: ''The usual complacent nonsense. It is more a case of three
wheels on the Tory wagon than four horsemen of the Apocalypse.''

LABOUR leader Tony Blair has intervened to assist the TUC in averting
a division on the national minimum wage at next week's Congress.
He has contacted leaders of the Fire Brigades Union and construction
union Ucatt to emphasise the need for unity, although it remains to be
seen whether his efforts will have the desired effect.
Both unions have tabled amendments adding a #4.15 per hour minimum
wage figure to two motions.
Other unions would be happy if the amendments were removed to display
unity and avoid embarrassing the Labour leader, who is due to address
Congress on Tuesday.
Both the TUC and Labour have agreed on a policy supporting a national
minimum wage, but Mr Blair says he will not set a figure until Labour is
in power.
TUC officials have been ''leaning'' heavily on FBU general secretary
Ken Cameron and Ucatt's George Brumwell this week.
Both are said to be ''reflecting'' on the matter.
The TUC may rule the FBU amendment out of order as it has been added
to the ''wrong'' motion or the sponsors of both motions may be asked to
remit them to council, causing both amendments to fall.
An emergency session of the TUC general council has been provisionally
arranged for tomorrow.

TWO of Scotland's eminent politicians have risked the wrath of their
party activists by sweeping aside the deadlock over the size of a
Scottish parliament by jointly declaring that they support a parliament
of 129 MPs.
The bold move by Labour's George Robertson and the Liberal Democrats'
Jim Wallace to seize the initiative after years of wrangling carries
considerable political risk, as many party members will argue that their
views are being ignored and that the lengthy consultation period was no
more than a sham.
As Mr Donald Gorrie, Liberal Democrat group leader on Lothian and
Edinburgh councils, put it: ''We all make mistakes, and it was a bad
mistake to agree to this figure at this time and without consultation.''
However, despite these reservations, the 129 proposal is likely to get
the backing of both parties, and go on to become the agreed figure for a
parliament which the Labour Party has pledged to introduce if it wins
the next election.
Both Mr Robertson, Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary, and Mr Wallace,
leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, had realised that the
discussions over a Scottish parliament had become bogged down with
endless arguments over numbers and budgets rather than concentrating on
enthusing the Scottish public about what such a parliament could do.
Over a number of meetings and telephone calls during the last seven
days, the two men met half-way -- Mr Wallace went down from the figure
of 145 MPs and Mr Robertson moved up from 113 MPs.
As former Liberal leader Sir David Steel summed it up yesterday: ''It
is time we stopped dancing on the head of a pin, quibbling over numbers,
and progressed the political momentum to secure the restoration of our
parliament.''
The Robertson/Wallace proposal would work like this: the present 72
parliamentary constituencies would become 73, by splitting Orkney and
Shetland. Each constituency would elect one MP. Voters, however, would
have two slips -- one to choose their MP and one to vote for the party
of their choice.
These party votes would be counted on the basis of Scotland's eight
European parliamentary boundaries. Seven additional members would then
be selected for each European seat to balance up, as far as possible,
the proportion of votes of each of the parties.
That would mean a further 56 MPs, chosen from party lists as opposed
to being directly elected, giving a parliament of 129.
It is these additional members which were attacked yesterday by
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, who declared that the scheme would
create ''a glorified retirement home for redundant regional councillors
and failed party hacks''.
He argued: ''This patronage parliament is a combination of regional
council and super-quango. It falls short of the democratic, powerful and
accountable parliament they promised to deliver.
''Candidates nominated by party patronage will be accountable to
no-one but their party hierarchy. The electorate will have no powers to
remove these unelected members, and even those who are rejected by the
electorate could find themselves sitting in a Scottish parliament.''
Labour, though, sees the Tory claims as gross hypocrisy. The
Conservative Government, for example, gave Ministerial positions to both
Peter Fraser and John Mackay after they were rejected by the Scottish
electorate, by putting them into the House of Lords.
The system works well in Germany, which is regarded as one of the most
stable democracies in the world.
Not only would the additional 56 MPs be used to reflect the parties
better in proportional terms, they would also allow the parties to
balance the gender of MPs and have more MPs from outwith the central
belt.
The present first-past-the-post system can throw up large anomalies.
The Conservatives had only 4% more of the popular vote than the SNP at
the last election, yet ended up with 11 MPs to the SNP's three. Labour,
with less than 40% of the vote, took two-thirds of the Scottish seats.
The Liberal Democrats have attempted to forecast what the make-up of a
Scottish Parliament would be, using the 129 figure, and based on the
last General Election votes. Its calculations are that Labour would have
54 seats, the Conservatives 30, SNP 28 and the Liberal Democrats 17.
Not only are the figures far nearer the proportional vote of each
party, but it would also make it more difficult for the Labour Party to
win overall control. The fact that Labour is willing to go along with a
system which does not give it automatic control in Scotland reflects the
party's commitment to devising a scheme which would win broad support.
Nevertheless, there will be criticism from within. Women in the Labour
Party who supported the revolutionary concept of 50/50, which guaranteed
women half the seats, will be furious, even though gender balance will
still be attempted.
Trade unions such as Unison, and the Transport and General, which
backed 145 during Labour's recent consultation period, may not wish to
back down so quickly. The Scottish TUC, which initally argued for a
parliament of 214 seats, is also unhappy. General secretary Campbell
Christie said it had ''very serious doubts'' about how a parliament of
only 129 could deliver full proportionality, gender balance and be large
enough to carry out the important tasks with which it had to deal.
After all, from 129 MPs, there have to be Opposition MPs, back
benchers, Government Ministers and Select Committee members.
Mr Robertson believes he will win the day when he argues for 129 at
the executive of the Scottish Labour Party tomorrow. He will argue that
serious progress has to be made, and that continuing argument would only
work in favour of the Conservatives and the SNP, who are sceptical of
the devolution plans.
Mr Wallace also faces criticism from Liberal Democrat activists who do
not want to give up the 145 figure so easily. His argument will be that
what is more important than the numbers is that Labour will have agreed
with them that the Scottish parliament will have a form of proportional
representation -- one of the Lib Dems' great goals.
Despite the inevitable criticism he will face, Mr Wallace was adamant
yesterday that moving down from 145 to 129 was the right thing to do.
''The general public wants us to stop arguing amongst ourselves and
get stuck into the Tories. We want to agree a figure and get out
campaigning on it and meet the challenge of Michael Forsyth,'' he said.
If the instincts of Robertson and Wallace are correct, and the
criticism can be contained, then the all-party Scottish Constitutional
Convention ought to be able to unveil the final package for a Scottish
parliament on St Andrew's Day -- more than six years since the
convention was originally established.
How it would work
* Scotland's existing 72 parliamentary seats would be expanded to 73,
by giving Orkney and Shetland a seat each.
* A further 56 MPs would be elected by proportional representation,
calculated on the basis of seven MPs from party lists being elected for
each of Scotland's eight Euro-constituencies.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday offered a ''new deal''
for local government in Scotland. He said a whole range of Scottish
Office restrictions would be removed from councils if they, in turn,
acted responsibly and curbed partisan sniping.
Mr Forsyth said his proposals offered real devolution of power
downwards, unlike the additional central tier offered by Labour and
Liberal Democrats.
He said he welcomed the positive dialogue with the Convention of
Scottish Local Authorities. He had asked his officials to look at every
area of Scottish Office restraint on local government, ranging from
finances to school closures.
''We have also asked Cosla to come forward with their own proposals
and we will certainly look at them. This is a new deal for local
government. I want to see an end to the slanging matches between central
and local government. I want to do this quickly, by the end of the year,
and then get on with things'' he said.
Mr Forsyth said that capping of council expenditure was also on the
agenda, but removal should not be an excuse to raise council tax bills.
In return, he said he wanted councils to devolve decision-making
themselves down to community councils, school boards, tenants' and
residents' associations.
''I think there is huge potential for us to reinvent local government
and give power back to communities. I want to see local government
strengthened,'' he told the Scottish conference of the Institute of
Revenues, Rating and Valuation, a body he last addressed in 1990 when he
was extolling the benefits of the poll tax.
It was a measure of the public transformation of Mr Forsyth from
ideologue to consensus politician that yesterday he was warmly welcoming
contributions from his erstwhile bitter foes.
He said he shared SNP concern over the squeezing out of minority
parties from council committees, and also criticism by the public sector
union, Unison, of some of the appointments to the new councils. ''It is
not often you find me getting into bed with Unison, but I hope that will
change,'' he added.
He denied his proposals were simply window-dressing, and said they
were aimed at promoting good government, which all parties would support
.Mr Forsyth said he wanted the partisan pettiness to be removed from
council chambers. ''If local authorities cannot put their own houses in
order, I have no choice but to act,'' he warned.
He expected new councils to move away from the idea of building their
own empires, to become enabling authorities delivering services by
themselves or using the private and voluntary sectors.
Last night Cosla offered a guarded welcome to Mr Forsyth's speech.
Vice-president Mr Peter Peacock said that if dialogue with the Scottish
Secretary was to be of any value he must take greater account of the
wishes of Scottish people than his predecessor, Mr Ian Lang.
He said Cosla wanted more specific proposals on areas such as passing
power from the quangos back to local councils.
Councillor Brian Weddell, convener of Lothian Region's finance
committee, told the conference he appreciated the Scottish Secretary's
frankness, but wondered why these issues were not taken on by the
Government when it was setting up the new councils.
He told Mr Forsyth: ''The most important thing you can do is free up
the local authorities by abolishing capping. If capping is not taken
away from local authorities, then I think the game's a bogey.''

THE Tories have started to haul back Labour's massive opinion poll
lead, according to the latest survey published last night.
A Gallup poll for the Daily Telegraph showed Labour's lead had fallen
sharply from 35 points in late July to 28 points now.
The survey of 1082 adults put Labour on 54.5%, down three points on
July, while the Conservatives were up four points on 26.5%.
The Liberal Democrats were virtually unchanged, down just half a point
on 14%.
The figures come after a difficult summer for Labour marked by
persistent sniping at Tony Blair's leadership by critics from within the
party.
The same trend was apparent, although less markedly, in the larger
Gallup 9000 survey of 9049 voters carried out over the whole of August.
That put Labour 30.8 points ahead, a 0.9 point fall since July and the
party's lowest lead since Mr Blair was elected leader.
The poll gave Labour 55.5%, down 1.7% on July, although the Tories
were also down slightly on 24.7%, a 0.8 point fall.
The Liberal Democrats were the main gainers, up 2.1 points on 15.0%.
Both Mr John Major and Mr Blair saw their personal popularity ratings
fall during August.
The Labour leader's slipped 2.4 points to 39.4% while Mr Major's fell
2.3 points to 18.5%. The Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Paddy Ashdown, was
up 2.2 points on 13.0%.

college's music school. There, with 200 other first-year pupils, he was
to be lectured on aspects of Eton life. William will soon have to pass

AN APPEAL has gone out for help to try to track down a six ft-long
Royal python which has escaped from its glass tank in a Fife pet shop.
The three-inch thick snake, worth #130, disappeared from the tank at
Animal Fayre in High Street, Methil, yesterday. Staff believe the
reptile -- which is brown with tan flecks and eats mice -- pushed the
top off the tank during the night.
They searched the shop after the early-morning discovery, but there
was no sign of the snake, nicknamed Rod by four police officers called
in to help find it.
Shop manager Ms Sally Goodsir said: ''He could not survive outside in
this weather. His only hope is if he got out through the night when it
was dry and got in some place warm to sleep.''
The snake, which is about two years old, has been in the shop for
several months, but was sold recently to a local man, who intended to
collect his new pet after completing the payment.

<TEXT>
COSMIC radiation may put air hostesses at a higher risk of breast
cancer than women who stay on the ground, it is disclosed today.
A Finnish study found that female cabin staff were twice as likely to
suffer breast cancer than women who do not fly regularly.
One suggested reason was that cosmic radiation bombarding aircraft in
flight could trigger the disease. Levels of cosmic radiation double with
each 1500-metre increase in altitude.
The study of almost 1800 cabin attendants working for Finnish airline
companies since 1967 also found a significantly increased incidence of
bone cancer.
However, Mr Gordon McVie, science director at the Cancer Research
Campaign, was sceptical about the findings published in the British
Medical Journal.
He said it was important to note that no significant increase in
leukemia was found.
He thought a larger study, possibly using a big airline like British
Airways, was needed for more reliable results.
Dr Eero Pukkala, of the Finnish Cancer Registry, found 20 cases of
breast cancer had been diagnosed among the airline hostesses -- twice
the expected levels.
However, Dr Pukkala also found that the cosmic radiation doses
appeared too small to account for the whole of the increased risk.

<HEADLINE>Soldier admits attempted murder. Chambermaid victim says she is suffering a lifetime sentence after attack in hotel room</HEADLINE>

A RUNAWAY soldier yesterday admitted the attempted murder of a
chambermaid at an Edinburgh hotel.
At a brief hearing, Norman MacKay, 18, pled guilty to the attack on
Mrs Kay Harper, 28, at the Osbourne Hotel in York Place on May 12.
MacKay, described as a prisoner, admitted attempting to kill her by
seizing her by the throat, pushing her on to a bed, sitting astride her
and repeatedly stabbing and cutting her on the body to her severe injury
and permanent disfigurement and to the danger of her life.
Advocate-depute, Mr William Totten, formally moved for sentence at the
High Court in Edinburgh but asked judge Lord Mayfield to consider a
short deferment until senior defence counsel could be present.
''I have been very much obliged by the assistance of those advising Mr
MacKay,'' Mr Totten said.
He told the court that witnesses had been told some weeks before that
they would not be required for the hearing.
Defence advocate Mr Andrew Brown said a deferral would enable further
psychiatric reports to be obtained for his client from the prison
doctor.
Lord Mayfield adjourned the case until next Wednesday.
The victim, a mother of two children, says that life will never be the
same again as a result of the attack.
It had left her voice little more than a whisper and turned her into a
near-recluse.
Speaking at her Leith home yesterday, Mrs Harper said: ''It doesn't
matter what happens to him or what sort of sentence he gets. I'm
suffering a lifetime sentence because of what he did to me.''
She was working on the top floor of the hotel when MacKay, who had
checked in under a false name attacked her. He knifed her through the
heart, leaving her minutes from death.
The fact that she survived the blows inflicted on her was due to a
combination of medical expertise and luck.
A two-men ambulance crew, based in East Lothian, had minutes earlier
transported a patient to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and were making their
way back through the busy city-centre streets nearby when they answered
the call, just after 11am.
The crew immediately realised the serious extent of her injuries and
Medic One, the ERI's flying squad of two doctors and a senior nurse, was
summoned to administer on-the-spot treatment to stem major blood loss
before Mrs Harper was taken to hospital for eight hours of emergency
surgery.
Her husband, David, was constantly at her side as she spent eight
weeks in hospital recovering.
She is still suffering, four months later.
''I still don't sleep at nights. I've had counselling and it's helped
a bit, but I'm still scarred by what happened.
''I'm getting out and about more for the sake of the kids, but it's
hard. I'm determined he won't beat me and stop me from getting on with
my life,'' she said.
''All I want to do now is put this all behind me and go on holiday
with my family.''
Neighbours said while she appeared to have recovered from the physical
injuries of the attack, she still bore the psychological scars.
One said: ''She has become terrified of all men after the attack,
which is understandable. She is really lucky to be alive.''
Security at the Osbourne Hotel has also been tightened in the wake of
the attack.
The general manager, Mrs Sandra Bryson, said the staff of 24 had
suffered trauma and were still nervous about working in bedrooms.
She described Mrs Harper as ''a chatty, friendly member of staff''.
The hotel hopes she will return to her #96-a-week job.
MacKay, aged just 17 at the time, is thought to have used the Osbourne
Hotel frequently as a stop-off when commuting between his family home in
Alness in Easter Ross and his barracks, first in the Newcastle area and
then at the Infantry Training Centre at Catterick in Yorkshire.

<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976486712</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ARCHAELOGISTS were last night hailing the discovery of a
500,000-year-old tooth as one of the most important ever made.
The discovery of the front tooth from a human lower jaw at Boxgrove,
west Sussex, has caused immense excitement in the archaeological
community.
Already archaeologists had found a shin bone from Boxgrove Man dating
back 500,000 years and now further excavations have unearthed the tooth,
thought to be several hundred years older.
If its age is confirmed it will be part of Britain's oldest
inhabitant.
Dr Geoffrey Wainwright, English Heritage chief archaeologist, said
yesterday: ''The importance of these finds to the evolution of our
species and our understanding of the human condition cannot be
overestimated.''
For 19-year-old student Laura Basell, who found the tooth, it was the
discovery of a lifetime.
Ms Basell, who lives at Ledbury, Herefordshire, and is studying
archaeology at Bristol University, said that after the find she is
certain what her career is going to be.
She had gone to the Boxgrove site to help with excavation and, using a
trowel, was gently sifting away dirt when she found the tooth.
''Everything you dig up you wonder 'is it human'?'' she said. ''I
thought it was a deer tooth, but I was wrong.''
Mr Mark Roberts, of the Institute of Archaeology at University
College, who is helping direct the English Heritage-funded project at
Boxgrove, said the tooth clearly belonged to another individual apart
from Boxgrove Man, because it had been found 0.9 metres below where his
shin bone was discovered.
''The depth of sediment separating the two individuals means that they
probably lived hundreds of years apart and thus it is the owner of the
tooth who may now be described as the oldest Englishman or woman.''
From the tooth scientists hope to be able to establish more about its
owner's lifestyle.

MORE women than ever are being appointed to senior administrative
positions in Scotland's new 29 unitary authorities, a survey revealed
yesterday.
However, senior Labour councillor Jean McFadden described the overall
number of women holding salaried, senior council posts under the new
set-up as still very poor.
Councillor McFadden, convener of the new Glasgow City Council, said
there were signs that the ''glass ceiling'' which was constraining women
becoming directors in the male dominated professions was beginning to
crack.
According to the Scottish Local Government Information Unit survey of
the 335 chief executives and director/head of service appointments that
have been made only 39 posts had gone to women.
This contrasts with the fact that women make up the majority of
council employees with almost 70% of those working in departments like
public administration, education and health being female.
The SLGIU said such proportions were not reflected at the higher
managerial levels in the public sector. However, it adds that the
situation is improving.
For example, in Renfrewshire four out of nine director/head of service
chiefs are women.
Eight of the 25 directors of social work appointed in Scotland to date
are women and six of the new directors of education are also women.
Councillor McFadden, who is convener of the SLGIU, said: ''It is good
that women appear to have made some inroads into breaking the male
domination of senior management positions in Scottish local authorities,
not just in education and social work, which have traditionally been
seen as female territory, but also in some other professions.
''There are signs that the glass ceiling which was constraining women
becoming directors in the male-dominated professions is beginning to
crack.
''The overall position is still poor and more thought will need to be
given to how the management teams of Scottish local authorities can
become less male dominated.''
The report shows that women appear to have lost ground at the most
senior level in the new councils as none of the unitary councils will
have female chief executives.

THE head of a security firm which guards a city's showpiece hospital
is a convicted double killer who knifed his wife and stepdaughter to
death, it was disclosed yesterday.
Wilfred ''Panama'' Jones, 59, told yesterday how he rebuilt his life
around his successful company after paying his debt to society.
The Liverpool Women's Hospital said it knew of his conviction and was
''satisfied'' with the service.
Mr Jones was jailed for life in 1970 after pleading guilty to
manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
He killed his wife and stepdaughter with a knife on Christmas Day,
1969.
The court head how he was liable to outbursts of violence because of
stress, alcohol or fasting.
Mr Jones was released on licence after serving eight-and-a-half years.
He has remarried and now lives with his wife and two children in
Wavertree, Liverpool.
Panama Security, which he set up six years ago, employs 140 people
providing cover for building sites, factories and businesses.
This week Mr Jones walked free from a Liverpool court where he was
accused of threats to kill, assault and unlawfully imprisoning a man.
The charges were dropped after the prosecution offered no evidence.

A HOUSE valued at #200,000 was damaged during an early- morning
teenage drinking party when a crowd of drunken young people descended on
the luxury property while the owners were away for the weekend, a court
was told yesterday.
The 15-year-old daughter of the house had invited friends.
The teenagers, many of whom brought along their friends, pelted each
other with household items, ruined carpets and furniture in a paint
fight, and ransacked the house, stealing thousands of pounds- worth of
jewellery, watches, cameras, a computer and computer games.
At Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday, almost a year later, two
17-year-olds admitted their part in the incident.
Stuart Patterson, of Second Avenue, Auchinleck, and David Murphy, of
Crosshill Road, Lenzie, were said to have come from good homes
themselves and had never been in trouble before.
Murphy admitted maliciously damaging carpets and furniture in the
house at Garngaber Avenue, Lenzie, on September 25 last year.
Both he and Patterson also admitted stealing a computer, a quantity of
CD computer games, and a rucksack from the house.
Mrs Gillian Mawdsley, prosecuting, withdrew allegations that the pair
also had stolen 11 rings, three watches, three bracelets, seven chains,
a locket, video camera, camera, Sega computer games, three personal
stereos and #20.
She told temporary Sheriff Kenneth Hogg that a 15-year-old schoolgirl
had invited friends from Lenzie Academy to a party in her home while her
parents were away for the September weekend.They had left her being
looked after by friends.
However, the invitation turned out to be an open one, and many of the
young people invited brought along their friends.
Mrs Mawdsley said #3500 worth of damage was done to the house.
Defence lawyers Mr Gerard Sinclair, for Murphy, and Ms Karen McLean,
for Patterson, said both youths had admitted stealing specific items.
They emphasised that other party-goers also had stolen from the house.
When interviewed by the police, Murphy and Patterson confessed, but
others who had been at the party remained silent.
Mr Sinclair said the party got out of hand and the young people
started throwing things at each other, including the contents from two
pots of paint that were found in the house.
He said it was like a ''script from an American teenage movie'' with
high-spirited youngsters going crazy.
Sheriff Hogg fined Paterson and Murphy #150 each for the theft and in
addition Murphy was fined another #100 for the vandalism.
They were both allowed to pay in #10-a-week instalments.

THE Duke of Atholl was criticised last night over the use of Army
tents for horse trials on his Perthshire estate.
It emerged that volunteer Black Watch soldiers helped in the running
of the horse trials at the duke's home, Blair Castle.
The tents had been used by Territorial Army soldiers on a helicopter
exercise on the duke's 135,000-acre estate and two neighbouring estates.
Once the exercise had finished, the tents were loaned to the
64-year-old duke for the four-day Blair Castle International Horse
Trials and Country Fair late last month.
The Old Etonian duke, one of Britain's richest men with an estimated
fortune of #145m, attracted strong criticism earlier this year when he
applied for a #400,000 Forestry Commission grant to plant trees on his
estate.
A row also erupted when it was revealed that the duke was charging
motorists #5 to drive along a pot-holed road to a beauty spot. He was
accused of cashing in on the BBC Gamekeeper series, featuring a
gamekeeper on his estate.
Last night Ms Roseanna Cunningham, SNP MP for Perth and Kinross, said:
''I think he is abusing his privileges.
''Before Parliament rose I put questions into the Ministry of Defence
to establish what is going on. I'm asking why the duke is using the Army
as his private workforce.
''It is absolutely outrageous that he appears to have some hot line to
the Army which is done at our expense.''
Mrs Cathy Jackson, secretary of the horse trials committee, declined
to comment yesterday.
An Army spokesman said: ''The tentage was lent to the Duke of Atholl
for the horse trials.
''But that tentage had been used by the TA to stay in during the
exercise. It was not taken there specifically for the horse trials.''
The spokesman added that soldiers from the 3rd Battalion Black Watch
Volunteers had attended the horse trials for recruiting purposes, but
had also ''helped the organisers of the show''.
The duke refused to comment last night. Estate factor Captain Andrew
Gordon was ''away for the day''.

AN elderly woman motorist died after a driver attempted to block
another from overtaking, a court was told yesterday.
Falkirk Sheriff Court heard that an unknown woman motorist had ''put
her foot down'' as Stephen Hannah tried to overtake her. Hannah then
lost control and smashed into an oncoming car, driven by Mrs Henrietta
Mackenzie, 72.
Depute procurator-fiscal Malcolm Stewart said Mrs Mackenzie had to be
cut free from the wreckage of her car by firefighters, but died later in
hospital.
Sentence was deferred last month after Hannah, 22, had admitted
dangerous driving and causing the death of the pensioner. However,
yesterday he avoided jail when Sheriff Andrew Murphy ruled that a
''large proportion of blame'' lay with the driver who had tried to block
him from overtaking.
Hannah was given 240-hours' community service and banned from driving
for four years.
Last night, the sentence was condemned by road safety campaigner Mrs
Isobel Brydie, of the Scottish Campaign Against Irresponsible Drivers.
She said: ''It's ridiculous. The legislation is now there to give
sentences of up to 10 years for this type of offence.''
The court was told that Hannah had tried to overtake a woman driver
approaching a bend at Torwood Garden Centre on the A9 in Stirlingshire.
He later told police: ''I think the other driver put her foot down and
I couldn't get back in.''
The court heard that Hannah, of Ochilmount, Bannockburn, hit a kerb,
lost control and smashed into an oncoming car carrying Mrs Mackenzie, of
Abbotsgrange Road, Grangemouth, on April 23, 1994.
Advocate Michael Jones said Hannah was a young, fairly inexperienced
driver who made a gross error of judgment.
He said that Hannah lost control of the car after overtaking. ''As he
pulled in, the car hit the inside kerb and then swerved into the path of
the oncoming vehicle.''
He added: ''He is genuinely remorseful. It is something he has
difficulty coming to terms with.''
Sheriff Murphy told Hannah, a first offender: ''I've thought carefully
about this. In a normal case, this type of offence attracts a period in
prison. But I think it can be said that a large proportion of blame can
be attributed to the driver you were overtaking.''

POLICE in Renfrewshire last night launched an appeal for information
following the theft of three shotguns and a quantity of ammunition in
Johnstone.
Police said the theft occurred between 8am and 12.45pm yesterday in a
house in Gibson Crescent, Johnstone.
The haul included three 12-bore shotguns, one a self-loading
automatic, 18 rounds of 12-bore ammunition and seven rounds of .410
cartridges.
It was not immediately apparent whether the weapons were being held
illegally or whether they were being held in an approved style, lockfast
cabinet.
The theft occurred three days after a 25-year-old man from Ferguslie
Park, Paisley, was shot on the outskirts of the town.
Mr Andrew McLeod was released from the Royal Alexandra Hospital,
Paisley, after treatment.

<HEADLINE>Warning on the many forms of elderly abuse</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

UP TO 500,000 old people are at risk from abuse, a conference on
''granny-bashing'' was told yesterday.
The conference, in Glasgow, also heard that it came in many forms,
including neglect.
Dr Paul Knight, clinical director of geriatric medicine at Glasgow
Royal Infirmary NHS trust, warned of the numbers involved, and provided
a picture of the abuser to around 170 delegates, including health care
professionals, Age Concern, nursing home staff, and old people
themselves.
The conference, Working Together to Confront ElderAbuse, heard calls
for a major survey to discover the extent of the problem.
Mr Gerry Reid, a lecturer in the department of community health
nursing at Caledonian University, said: ''What we need is substantial
funding for a major survey to target a large number of the population in
order to get a profile and find out what the picture is for victims and
abusers.''
Conference organiser Florence Blackburn said: ''Abuse can be in many
different forms: physical, mental, financial and sexual. People think of
abuse of the elderly as people being punched and kicked but it can also
be in the sense of neglect.
''The purpose of the conference is to raise public awareness and to
hope that organisations like health boards and social work departments
will take the issue on board and realise the extent of the problem.
''I think it's very much like child abuse before that came to the
fore. People didn't believe it existed. People would like to think that
their old folk are well looked after but it does not seem to be the
case.''
Dr Knight said studies suggested that between 100,000 and 500,000 old
people were at risk. He said, however, that the stereotype of the frail,
white-haired old lady living on her own and being abused by a carer was
inaccurate.
He said it was easier to characterise the abuser rather than the
victim. ''He or she often has physical and mental health problems, is
often dependent on alcohol and sometimes dependent financially on the
person who is being abused,'' he said.
Granny-bashing, which made it into the headlines, was relatively rare
but there were many forms of abuse. Psychological and financial abuse of
elderly people was much more common.
''The way it works is that the person's pension or attendance
allowance is held by their carer so they don't get to manage it. That
might be fine for 95% of the time but the rest of the time it is not,''
he said.
Dr Knight called for a heightened awareness of the possibility of the
situation and more support for carers looking after elderly people.
He said psychological abuse tended to come from carers who were under
pressure and stress.
Mr Reid admitted that few studies had been done on the issue.
He said the term ''battered granny syndrome'' was coined in 1975 but
recently a House of Commons committee into violence in the family
refused to accept that there was any problem of elder abuse. Mr Reid
said there was a problem with defining what was meant by it.
The US had led research in this field since 1969. There had been a
wide range of large scale studies and there was a public perception that
elder abuse did go on.
''Here in the UK there is not a general acceptance of it,'' he said.
He added that many old people had a vested interest in accepting the
occasional slap, fearing that if they reported it they would be taken
into care and end up in a dormitory with 20 other old people.
By the late-1980s 50 states in the US had some form of legislation
addressing abuse of the elderly.
He said that such abuse covered a wide range from general neglect and
physical abuse, which were easiest to define and identify, to the
withholding of food and non-attendance of the carer.

A medical student yesterday dashed two miles to a police station after
finding a corpse on a beach. Constable Duncan Sutherland hurried to the
scene, at Tangusdale, Barra, and found a dead seal.
He said: ''The rib cage was exactly like that of a human, and the
flipper looked very much like a human hand.'' The informant, a
first-year student from London, ''made off on his bike and I've not seen
him since''.

NORTHERN Ireland Minister, Mr Michael Ancram, last night prepared for
urgent talks with the Clinton administration as the Government continues
to call for IRA disarmament.
Mr Ancram hurriedly left Belfast for talks on Capitol Hill in a bid to
renew American support for and to counter criticism of Mr Major's
handling of the peace process.
It is understood that Mr Ancram will meet senior members of President
Clinton's team and urge them not to blame London for the failure by the
British and Irish governments to reach agreement on moves towards
weapons decommissioning and Sinn Fein's entry into all-party talks.
But Sinn Fein president Mr Gerry Adams said Britain's uncompromising
stance on the issue was the cause of a ''deepening crisis'' in the peace
process.
During his 24-hour visit, Mr Ancram is to have talks with Mr Tony
Lake, the president's national security adviser, officials at the State
Department and a number of Congressmen.
London-Dublin relations are under increased strain because of Dublin's
decision to cancel Mr Major's summit with Irish Premier John Bruton at
Chequers on Wednesday.
The Government is anxious not to be blamed for the current deadlock.
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and Mr Ancram had an
8O-minute meeting with Mr Major at Downing Street on Wednesday night. At
one stage the US Ambassador to London, Admiral William Crowe, was in
attendance.
Officials last night insisted there would be no climbdown on weapons,
but said it was hoped Mr Major and Mr Bruton would meet soon.
At the same time Mr Adams, who is due in Washington on Monday, accused
Britain of reneging on a commitment to move to all-party talks without
preconditions.
But he stressed that all sides had a responsibility to salvage the
peace process.
He added: ''Mr Major appears to see the peace process as a bicycle
which must be kept upright, but moving at the slowest possible pace.
British strategy is calculated to have this effect.''
Sinn Fein's chief negotiator, Mr Martin McGuinness, who is on a
six-day US tour, yesterday said the IRA would become a ''laughing
stock'' if it surrendered weapons before a negotiated settlement was
reached in Northern Ireland.

HOPES of saving the Fort William sleeper service rose yesterday after
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth and Mr Duncan McPherson, convener of
Highland Regional Council met in Edinburgh at Mr Forsyth's request.
Mr McPherson said later he was ''quite optimistic about the outcome''
but declined to give details of the hour-long talks.
''I hope it is the culmination of a very long campaign,'' he said. He
added that Mr Forsyth had been very helpful.
Asked what part the Scottish Secretary had played in efforts to save
the sleeper, he replied: ''I think he has played a fairly major role.''
Mr McPherson said he hoped there would be an announcement about the
sleeper in the near future. The matter rests with Mr Roger Salmon,
director of the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising, who will announce
the Passenger Service Requirement (PSR). It is hoped the sleeper service
would be included.
Mr Forsyth declined to comment as he left Old St Andrew's House.
Mr McPherson said recently that Highland Region's goal was to persuade
the franchising director to include the service in the PSR.
Highland Region has challenged BR's decision to axe the service. In
the Court of Session earlier this year, Lord Kirkwood banned BR from
withdrawing the sleeper until full public consultation had taken place,
and on June 7 three Judges rejected British Rail's appeal against Lord
Kirkwood's ruling.
Last month, a petition was delivered to the Scottish Office in
Edinburgh with 5000 signatures supporting the retention of the sleeper.
Mr Salmon said last year he was unwilling to subsidise the sleeper and
had decided not to include it in ScotRail's PSR at the time.
A spokesman for the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising said
yesterday they hoped to publish the PSR ''shortly.'' The Herald
understands that it is likely to be late next week.

THE proposal to run a ferry in direct competition to the Skye Bridge
gained credibility yesterday with Highland Regional Council agreeing to
open negotiations with the Skye Boat Company over leasing the slipways
at Kyle of Lochalsh and Kyleakin.
The company said it might be in a position to acquire a six-car ferry
by next week. It is understood the firm is interested in one currently
based in Southampton.
At present, the council only owns the slipway at Kyleakin as the Kyle
slip represents the last few feet of the A87 trunk road and is owned by
the Scottish Office. Ownership, however, will pass to the local
authority once the bridge is opened and the road detrunked.
At present the council receives #70,000 a year from Caledonian
MacBrayne for use of the Kyleakin slip, but the Skye Boat Company has
offered only #6000 for the use of both slipways, which council convener
Duncan McPherson described yesterday as ''derisory''. However, Mr Peter
Findlay, a director of the boat company, insisted it was a fair offer.
''It is a wee boat which will operate only during the hours of
daylight. CalMac operates two ferries which take 36 cars. You don't have
to be Einstein to work it out pro rata.''
Mr Findlay did not accept criticism from Skye councillor Duncan Grant
that all the introduction of a ferry would do would be to extend the
pay- back period on the bridge for many years.
''Primarily, this is a service for the village of Kyleakin, which will
lose out when the bridge opens. I think the finances of the bridge are
crippled already. They are going to have to extend the toll period
because they have overspent on the bridge and the builders are already
claiming #5m compensation.''
Mr Findlay said that a bank had approved the boat company's business
plan which would be based on a single fare of #4, undercutting the
bridge by at least #1. It was hoped that pedestrian passengers would be
able to travel free or perhaps local people might be asked for #5 a
year.
He said that the company recognised that they had to have a ferry in
place in time for the bridge opening in the middle of October. ''If we
don't, we will have egg on our face.''
What isn't clear is whether negotiations with Highland Region can be
conducted in time. The council is seeking further clarification from the
Scottish Office on the implications of the transfer of ownership for the
new single-tier Highland Council and some observers believe that the
council leadership is not in a hurry to enter into negotiations with the
boat company.
Sleat and South West Ross councillor John Farquhar Munro yesterday
proposed that the council enter negotiations. ''I am delighted that the
council has agreed to start negotiating with the Skye Boat Company. I
was a bit apprehensive that they might have given just a blank no, but
sense has prevailed.
''I do hope that they will now enter into meaningful discussions and
negotiations and that a solution to the costs of running the ferry on to
the slipways can be found.
''There is quite a disparity between what is on offer from the company
and what is expected from the regional council. But to be fair to the
regional council I think it is a figure that has been pulled out of the
hat and has not been calculated with any accuracy. I would hope that
once they look at the costs in more detail a more acceptable figure
might be available.''

<HEADLINE>Consumers 'risk being held to ransom'. Takeover bids raise fears of feeding frenzy</HEADLINE>

THE feeding frenzy around the English regional electricity companies
(RECs) is set to claim more victims as British Gas and North West Water
said they wanted to mount takeovers in the sector.
Such mergers would be the first between different utility companies
and the possibility prompted a storm of protest and calls for a
reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC).
Warrington-based North West is in talks with Norweb, whose
headquarters is in Manchester and whose catchment area is adjacent to
that of Manweb, currently fighting a bid from ScottishPower.
British Gas chief executive Cedric Brown indicated that his company
was interested in acquiring an REC, though an early move was unlikely.
The prospect of a water company buying an electricity distributor to
create a super-utility brought protests from consumer groups.
''Consumers could face being held to ransom,'' said Mr Anthony
Goldstone, chairman of the water regulator Ofwat in the North-west of
England. ''If this is what the Government wanted, why didn't they say so
in 1990?''
Mr Donald Macgregor of the GMB union also attacked the Government,
declaring: ''They privatised to break up monopolies and they are now
helping to create even greater monopolies.
''History has shown that such moves have more connection with the
senior directors' pockets than customers.''
Labour's trade and industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, backed calls
for a monopolies reference. However, the Government has steadfastly
refused to refer the other takeover bids for electricity companies to
the MMC even when asked to do so by the industry regulator Sir Stephen
Littlechild. Industry analysts see no reason why it should decide
differently in Norweb's case.
The company said that North West's approach was one of several it had
received. A merger with Norweb would create a #4000m company.
So the regulators could judge how they were performing, Norweb and
North West would have to remain separate companies in accounting terms
even if they merged under a group structure. This would still leave room
for savings through eliminating offices, centralising billing, and
amalgamating maintenance activities.
A takeover bid for an electricity company would embroil British Gas in
yet more controversy following the anger over directors' share perks and
rising complaints over levels of service.
Chief executive Cedric Brown said he believed that Britain would
eventually follow the US and have an overall energy market rather than
separate gas and electricity sectors.
''If that is the way the market goes, we want to be well-positioned to
take advantage of those changes. But we want to understand quite a lot
more about it before we take the final decision.''
However, events may force British Gas to act sooner than this suggests
as the RECs are steadily being grabbed by other companies and the choice
is narrowing.
British Gas's results for the six months to June show profits slightly
lower at #1003m, against #1026m in the same period last year. It is
under pressure from falling gas prices and its share price fell 10p to
264p. The group promises to maintain its dividend to shareholders for
1995.
The results were overshadowed by a big rise in complaints to the Gas
Consumers' Council. These already easily outnumber those received in the
whole of 1994. In the first half of 1995, 25,000 complaints were logged
compared with 24,359 in 1994.
British Gas's massive restructuring to prepare the ground for open
competition in gas supply to the home has prompted major customer
dissatisfaction. There has also been a shake-up in the servicing
division, which prompted many complaints.
Mr Brown accepted that service standards had slipped. ''I would like
to apologise to our customers whom we have caused any difficulty to as
we have gone through what is a massive change,'' to said.
Shadow Consumer Minister Nigel Griffiths said: 0''Slashing jobs and
axing services has hit customers hard. As the performance of British Gas
goes from bad to worse, Ministers sit on the sidelines, doing nothing to
secure better services for 18 million gas consumers.''

ARMED police shot and wounded a suspected armed robber in London
yesterday.
The incident happened after a raid on a Brink's-Mat security van near
Selhurst railway station, Croydon.
''Following the robbery the three male suspects were intercepted by
armed police officers from the flying squad who were in the area at the
time, said a Scotland Yard spokeswoman.
''One of the suspects was shot by police officers and has been taken
to hospital. The extent of his injuries are not known. The other two
were arrested.''
A 36-year-old man was taken to Mayday Hospital, Thornton Heath, he had
been wounded five times in the shooting.
His condition was described by hospital staff as ''stable and
comfortable'', his wounds were not life threatening.
BR employee Mr Mick Constable described how he passed a man dressed as
a rail worker walking along an alleyway by Selhurst station.
''As I passed him I saw he had a bag. I said to him: 'Have you got
your wages?' and he said 'Yes' and walked on.
''Then I heard police shouting 'stand back, let him through'.
''This man was being followed by armed police. When he got to the end
of the alley there was a car and a van. He dropped the bag and hared off
in a car,'' said Mr Constable.
The shooting happened later half a mile away, outside the Duke of
Cambridge pub on Whitehorse Road.
A man drinking in the pub at the time said he saw two people run past
the open door. Only one of the men was shot, the witness reported.
''We went outside and saw one of them had dropped a sawn-off shotgun.
There were so many plain-clothes police you couldn't count them.''

POLICE last night confirmed they are investigating alleged financial
irregularities involving a six-figure sum at Ayr Race Course. A firm of
chartered accountants has been called in to examine club accounts.
The disclosure came after members of the Western Meeting Club called
for a full independent investigation into the financial affairs of the
race course.
It has also been announced thata senior employee has left the company.
An extraordinary general meeting of the club will be held today at
which a resolution will be put to members asking that ''the club should
appoint a suitably qualified independent person to take evidence from
the members and senior management and to investigate the financial
procedures and general affairs of the Western Meeting Club.''
This resolution will be put by member Tony Collins, who said last
night he had taken the step ''reluctantly'' with the support of 25
members.
''Every effort has been made to avoid public confrontation,'' he said,
adding that following a disclosure of '' financial irregularities'' he
requested a full inquiry.
''Members through no fault of their own are going to suffer
considerable loss from monies missing and the cost of recovery and
investigation. It is therefore unreasonable that they don't have the
right firstly of input and secondly of reviewing the resultant report.''
In a letter to club members, Mr Collins said the full inquiry was
refused by race course management as an investigation was being carried
out by accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young's internal audit department.
''I can only point out that Ernst &amp; Young are the club auditors and I
would ask you to ask yourself: why the refusal? Is there something to be
afraid of or could it be that an independent inquiry might criticise the
management?'' Mr Collins wrote.
As well as the Ernst &amp; Young investigation, consultants Cooper &amp;
Lybrand are preparing a report on the club's management controls and
systems.
A spokeswoman for Ernst &amp; Young said last night: ''We have been
undertaking an investigation into accounting irregularities at Ayr Race
Course at the request of the committee of the club.
''The contents of such a report are confidential.''
Detective Inspector Tom Cunningham of Ayr Police said last night: ''I
can confirm that we are investigating alleged financial irregularities
at the Western Meeting Club involving a six figure sum of money.''

SALMAN Rushdie, who made his first major public appearance last night
since the Iranian death threat against him and defended an author's
right to ''say the unsayable'' is to read extracts from his latest novel
at the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh, next week.
His publishers have given notice of the reading from The Moor's Last
Sigh at the Traverse on Monday night. Security will be heavy and the
organisers, Waterstone's booksellers, are restricting ticket sales to
two for each applicant.
A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said they were aware of the
visit and would be taking appropriate security measures. The management
of the Traverse have reserved the right to search as a condition of
entry.
Security was also tight but relatively unobtrusive last night for the
#10-a-ticket debate which saw Mr Rushdie's return to public life. The
meeting, Writers Against The State, was sponsored by a London newspaper
and Dillons bookshops.
''Thank you for attending this little coming-out party,'' the writer
joked to an audience of several hundred at Westminster Central Hall in
London.
Fellow authors Martin Amis, Fay Weldon and Melvyn Bragg spoke in
support of Mr Rushdie. Then Mr Rushdie himself spoke for about 20
minutes.
He argued: ''One of the things a writer is for is to say the unsayable
and speak the unspeakable and ask the difficult questions.''
A writer had to stir up trouble to spark debates in society, he said.
It was not only himself, but writers all over the world who suffered
persecution from the state and from priests. In Nigeria, Algeria, China
and Turkey writers were being persecuted.
''It is becoming acceptable to say to writers 'Why are you making such
trouble? It's your own fault, you knew what you were doing','' he said.
However, he admitted it was ironic that Britain had protected him so
thoroughly from the fatwa imposed by Ayatollah Khomeini in February
1989, because of the offence caused to Muslims by his book, The Satanic
Verses, and he said he was very grateful to Special Branch.

THE Prime Minister yesterday gave the clearest indication so far that
his Government would complete its full term before calling a General
Election. His declaration that there were 18 months to go, came as both
he and Chancellor Kenneth Clarke played up the prospects for the
economy.
Mr Major has until the early summer of 1997 before he must go to the
electorate. Today he will visit St Andrews and Perth, but yesterday he
launched his ''meet the people'' campaign in Luton where he said: ''Over
the next 18 months, we will be setting out a programme which will take
us not just through the General Election but through the millennium as
well.''
He said Britain was ''breaking through the psychology of inflation,''
adding that on the economic front: ''This policy is still being
developed. We are not in a position to tell you precisely what it is. We
will be able to do that soon but not yet.''
His comments came as Mr Clarke issued bullish comments about the
economy as he met Bank of England Governor Eddie George.
It emerged from that meeting that interest rates are likely to remain
on hold, and Mr Clarke made clear that tax cuts will come as and when
the Government can afford them.
The scene is set for a tough Budget in November, perhaps with some
hint of tax cuts to come, followed by a heavy tax-cutting cutting Budget
in November 1996 to improve Tory chances of retaining power in the
election six months later.
Mr Major insisted that ''taking the message to the people'' was the
new direction which would bring a Conservative election victory.
He said: ''The reality is that we are taking out a whole series of
ideas and options. We are discussing them with the party and we want
them over the next few months to take ownership of the next phase of
Conservatism. That is really what it is about.''
For his part, the Chancellor said he would set policy to deliver his
inflation target of 2.5% or less by the end of the parliament.
He told BBC Radio: ''That is one of the things that is going to make
us one of the most successful economies in western Europe. That is the
way we get the sense of prosperity and security back.''
* Both the Government's economic strategy and Mr Major's
meet-the-people tour were strongly attacked yesterday by the Liberal
Democrats, whose annual conference takes place in Glasgow in 10-days'
time.
Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce said: ''If the economy continues to
slow down, what will be needed is a responsible Budget this November --
not one of unsustainable tax bribes but one which will allow for lower
British interest rates.''

NATO jets attacked bridges, ammunition dumps, and barracks in Bosnian
Serb-held territory yesterday, but insisted, in the face of sharp
criticism from Russia, that its stepped-up strikes were within reason.
''The goal of this campaign is not to pulverise the Bosnian Serb
military or the Bosnian Serb people,'' US Defence Department spokesman
Ken Bacan said in Washington.
Nato was not joining war against the Bosnian Serbs. It was just trying
to force them to comply with UN demands to end the siege of Sarajevo and
withdraw heavy guns, he said.
However, the Bosnian Serb Government issued a statement calling the
raids ''criminal'' and backing defiant General Ratko Mladic.
The huge scale of that force became clear as the planes yesterday
reached 2100 sorties on what was the most active day since the operation
began on August 30. It was Nato's biggest combat action in its 46-year
history.
''The important thing now is not to buckle,'' said a middle-aged man
on the street in the Serb ''capital'' Pale, shrugging off the powerful
detonations rocking the town.
Thick black smoke curled into the sky from a nearby ammunition dump
hit by rockets while the Lukavica barracks, a key headquarters outside
Sarajevo, lay in ruins after two days of strikes by Nato jets.
Bosnian Serb TV showed two badly damaged bridges in Foca, south-east
Bosnia. Nato said it was striking bridges, radar posts, communications,
and military infrastructure, but the Serbs said civilian targets were
also being hit. Bosnian Serb television ran a report, without pictures,
saying 15 civilians, including four children, had been killed in Doboj
in western Bosnia.
While Nato said all members of the Western alliance were firmly behind
the air strikes, and Islamic states meeting major Western powers in
Paris also endorsed the action, Russian President Boris Yeltsin again
condemned the strikes on fellow Orthodox and Slav Serbs, traditional
allies of Moscow.
He suggested the Nato action could force Russia to review its whole
relationship with the Atlantic alliance.
Yesterday's escalation in the Nato strikes, coinciding with clear blue
skies, came ahead of today's one-day Geneva talks between the foreign
ministers of Yugoslavia, Croatia, and Bosnia intended to open the way to
a comprehensive peace process.
US peace envoy Richard Holbrooke, who is masterminding the initiative,
has tried to distance the Geneva talks and his peace process from the
air strikes, saying they are purely focused at getting the Serbs to meet
UN demands on the Sarajevo siege.
However, there was no let-up in the Nato raids, and the alliance said
it was sending a whole range of aircraft against an ever-increasing
number of potential targets.
Waves of alliance aircraft repeatedly attacked military targets around
Sarajevo on the ninth day of Operation Deliberate Force, which had been
interupted over the weekend to give the Serbs a chance to show they were
pulling weapons out.
Late yesterday UN spokesman Alexander Ivanko said there was no
evidence the Serbs were about to comply.
''We have checked and no heavy weapons have moved out of the exclusion
zone. The Bosnian Serbs continue to defy the will of the international
community,'' Mr Ivanko said in Sarajevo.
Nato launched the action eight days after after a Serb mortar killed
37 people in Sarajevo. Yesterday, Muslim Sarajevans were joyful at the
attacks, cheering when the nearby Serb barracks went up in smoke.
''Imagine being beaten up every day for three years and then someone
comes along and beats the man who's been beating you,'' said 24-year old

DOCTORS in Scotland should be able to switch off life support machines
that are keeping brain-dead patients alive and withdraw treatment for
the terminally ill without the risk of being prosecuted or sued.
This controversial proposal, put forward yesterday by the Scottish Law
Commission, would bring Scots law into line with England following the
case of Hillsborough victim Tony Bland.
The commission wants to see a law passed which would make it clear
that a doctor's duty of care does not extend to providing futile medical
treatment to incapable patients.
The right to die proposal, which the commission recognises as highly
emotive, is part of a comprehensive report affecting the legal rights of
those who are incapable of making decisions for themselves.
In the report, issued yesterday, the commission stated: ''It is not
necessarily of benefit to patients to keep them alive as long as
possible.
''Other considerations, such as the quality of life and the
peacefulness and dignity of the dying process, should also be taken into
account, in accordance with current good medical practice.''
The commission feels that a clearly-stated immunity from criminal,
civil, or disciplinary proceedings would encourage doctors not to
provide ''futile'' treatment, and ''enhance the quality of life for
terminally ill patients''.
At a news conference in Edinburgh yesterday, law commission member Dr
Eric Clive said: ''The law in Scotland is unclear and doctors are
expected to take very difficult decisions often in stressful
circumstances. But lawyers cannot tell them what the legal consequences
are. That seems to us to be unacceptable and unfair.
''There are many cases where the provision or continuation of
treatment would be of no benefit to the patient. It could be said to
prolong the process of dying.''
The law commission was recommending that there should be legislation
to make it clear that Scots law adopted the same approach as the House
of Lords had taken in the Bland case in England.
In that case the judges had made it clear that there was no absolute
obligation on doctors to prolong an incapable patient's life regardless
of the circumstances or quality of life.
So far in England, it has been decided that every time a withdrawal of
treatment is proposed for a patient in a persistent vegetative state, an
application has to be made to the court.
Dr Clive said that the commission did not think this was necessary in
Scotland.
''In our view, having to apply to the court would be an extra source
of stress for a family in an already very painful situation.
''We do recommend that it should be possible to apply to a court for a
declarator that the proposed withdrawal of treatment should be lawful.
''This would not be a normal or routine step and we envisage an
application to the court only being made in the case of exceptional
difficulty -- for example where the nearest relatives disagree among
themselves.''
Scotland's first right to die case is due to be heard at the Court of
Session next month, but would be unnecessary if the law commission
proposals become law.
Law Hospital is taking legal action in the case of Mrs Janet Johnston,
50, who has lain in a coma for more than three years. She is being kept
alive by a feeding tube and has no hope of recovery.
Her family and doctors are agreed that she should be allowed to die
and the feeling at the law commission yesterday was the hospital and
relatives were ''playing safe'' by making an application to the court.
Although there is apparently no case of a doctor in Scotland being
prosecuted or sued for withdrawing treatment, it remains a live
possibility as the law stands.
Dr Clive added: ''Doctors are in a very difficult position, operating
in a state of legal uncertainty, taking life and death decisions. We
think it is wrong for the law to leave this in a state of doubt and to
leave doctors in an exposed legal position.
''Nobody would pretend that this is not a highly controversial and
emotive issue.''
The Rev Bill Wallace, convener of the Church of Scotland's board of
social responsibility, said last night: ''If it is clear there is no
possibility of significant recovery we see no point in prolonging life
artificially.
''The decision should be taken by the doctors in consultation with
relatives. There should also be clear guidelines drawn up for the
guidance of doctors and relatives.''
The Catholic Church in Scotland described the recommendation on
withholding or withdrawing treatment as vague and ambiguous.
A short statement referred to the fact that the law commission
recognised that difficult and exceptional cases could still have to be
referred to the court.
The statement added: ''Inevitably every case is going to be different,
difficult, and ought to be judged individually. The decision to withhold
or withdraw treatment is always difficult.''

THIS year's Commonwealth summit in New Zealand could prove a testing
time for Mr Major. Pacific nations have warned him he risks isolation
over his refusal to condemn the testing.
They have have united against France's decision. Britain, however, has
been one of the few world powers not to condemn Paris, saying only that
the tests are a French affair.

<HEADLINE>The flames of anger spread as France bids to quell the anti-nuclear riots. Chirac calls in Foreign Legion</HEADLINE>

FRANCE has moved swiftly to quell the anti-nuclear riots on Tahiti,
sending in the Foreign Legion and elite units of paramilitary gendarmes.
A spree of arson and looting began with the sacking of the airport at
the capital, Papeete, and ended with the burning of a dozen city centre
buildings.
Among the targets was the residence and offices of French high
commissioner Paul Ronciere, where a firebomb was hurled through an
upper-storey window.
France ordered 40 legionnaires to be flown to Tahiti from the Mururoa
atoll nuclear test site, 750 miles away.
Paris also announced it was sending up to 300 paramilitary gendarmes
to reinforce 170 paratroopers and 300 gendarmes already there.
The riot police were in action again yesterday, opening fire with tear
gas and stun-grenades as youths gathered at Papeete's international
airport.
In the centre of the capital, the police put on a show of force,
marching along the street outside the French High Commission offices,
beating their shields with their batons.
At the airport, at least 100 burned-out cars littered the car park and
boulders blocked one of the main entrances. Scores of riot police
guarded the charred airport terminal which has been closed indefinitely.
In the central shopping district, the contents of looted shops were
scattered across the roads.
''We want the French to stop everything, all the bloody bombs and get
out,'' said independence campaigner Ralph Tahuiini.
Anger at the French resumption of nuclear tests in the South Pacific
has combined with resentment over Paris's control of Tahiti and French
Polynesia.
Mr Oscar Temaru, Tahiti's leading anti-nuclear activist and
pro-independence politician, blamed Paris for the violence.
''We are trying to calm down the people, but it's not easy,'' he said.
''The only way to calm all this is for France to stop its tests.''
At least 16 people were injured in clashes, six them seriously, a High
Commission spokesman said. Seven policemen were among the injured.
The nuclear test blast deep under Mururoa Atoll on Tuesday was the
first of a series France plans to conduct until May.
It caused outrage around the world, but so far France has rebuffed all
criticism, vowing to carry on tests its says are vital to keep its
nuclear arsenal up to date.
Tokyo's criticism led French President Jacques Chirac, a frequent
visitor to Japan, to snub an invitation for a state visit next year.
A planned visit to Paris by Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson was
put off after Swedish protests.
France had complained to Stockholm and Tokyo after Japanese Finance
Minister Masayoshi Takemura and Swedish Culture Minister Margot Walstrom
attended a weekend anti-nuclear march in Tahiti.
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali added his voice to the
criticism, saying he opposed such testing by any nation.
New Zealand and Chile have recalled their ambassadors to Paris and the
tiny Pacific island of Nauru has said it is suspending all diplomatic
relations.
Australia and New Zealand, among the most vociferous critics of the
French tests, said Paris had only itself to blame for the Tahiti riots.
French Overseas Territories Minister, Mr Jean-Jacques de Peretti,
maintained the trouble was inspired by a tiny rabble. ''Let's not be
fooled. What's going on in Papeete has nothing to do with anti-nuclear
protests,'' he said.
There was no doubt the blast enraged separatists in French Polynesia,
which consists of some 130 islands with a population of 212,000. They
see the tests as evidence of the French Government's disregard for their
welfare.
