Lacklustre stock market conditions
are deterring private investors from
making lump-sum subscriptions through
investment trust savings schemes and
personal equity plans.
There was a sharp fall in the
amounts subscribed to investment trust
savings schemes in the first quarter
of this year, according to figures
from the Association of Investment
Companies.
The total subscribed was #44.12m,
a drop of 28.5% on the figure for
the final quarter of last year and
35% less than in the first.
Almost all the shortfall was
attributable to lump sum investments
which totalled only #21.25m, which
was 56% less than in the first
quarter of last year and 44% below
the figure for the final quarter.
Subscriptions for investment
trust PEPs fell by 18.4% to #266.34m
between 1994-94 and 1994-95.

industry in Scotland.
Watson &amp; Philip chief executive David Bremner declined to say how much
his Dundee-based group had paid for Clark's, which sells about #6m of
foodstufs per year to caterers and other large customers in central
Scotland.
''It is a relatively small acquisition as far as Watson &amp; Philip is
concerned,'' Mr Bremner said. ''After the deal has been completed we
will have approximately 15% of the market share in Scotland, up from
about 10% or 11% at present,'' he added.

CELTIC'S depressing night at Hampden last night was compounded by the
news that Tony Mowbray will miss the Tennents Scottish Cup final as a
result of being booked. He is suspended for four games, a tough setback
for the Englishman who had been looking forward to the great finale
against Airdrie on May 27.
His grim faced-manager, Tommy Burns, had little to say. ''We felt
their first goal should have been a free kick, but I commend our players
for keeping their heads in the circumstances, but we lost our discipline
as a team afterwards and it was very easy to understand why.''
Burns appeared t be referring to the controversy surrounding the
second Thistle goal which was the consequence of a quick free kick taken
while Mowbray was still protesting about the foul that led to the score.
The defender was then booked for harassing the referee.
However, the man who scored that goal, Wayne Foster, defended his
team's right to take the kick when they wished. ''It is in the rules.''
he said. ''They can argue all they like, but if they were not set up,
then that's their fault.''
Not surprisingly, it was an ebullient John Lambie who described the
night as ''a great result for us,'' but in typical fashion, he added:
''Nobody will be getting the day off tomorrow. We must get our feet back
on the ground. We still need a point, but the worst that could happen to
us now would be a play-off.''
If there was any consolation for Celtic, it was the relief that Peter
Grant's booking does not mean he will miss the final, and Willie
falconer learned earlier in the day that his yellow card against Falkirk
will not prevent him taking part either.
Meanwhile, there was no such luck for Airdrie's John Davies (writes
Jim Reynolds).
He almost certainly will miss the final as a result of a three-match
suspension.
The 28-year-old Davies, who has played a main part in first division
Airdrie's run to their second Scottish Cup final in three years, was
sent off during a league match at East End Park on Saturday for lashing
out at Dunfermline's Jackie McNamara.
And although the referee's report on the incident had been held up, an
SFA spokesman has confirmed that the Airdrie man had been sent off for
violent conduct. That carries 12 penalty points and, added to the five
he has accumulated, it takes Davies over the 16-point threshold.
Davies will miss Saturday's match against Hamilton at Broadwood
because of an automatic one-match suspension and the two-game ban will
start on May 13.
That rules him out of the last league match of the camapign, against
his former team, St Johnstone, and the Hampden showpiece a fortnight
later.
Now the only way Davies can play in the final is if Airdrie defy the
odds to finish second in the first division, and qualify for a play-off
against the second-bottom team in the premier division.
Should that happen, he would miss the first leg of the play-offs, on
May 21, and return to action in the second leg on May 25 -- two days
before the cup final. But it is a long, long shot.

IAN McGeechan, the former Scotland coach, has described the measures
announced by the Rugby Football Union on Monday to limit the number of
non-English players in their game as ''short sighted,''
''The English do not recognise the influence of foreign input. Tim
Rodber is the player he is today because of Wayne Shelford and not
because of the English system,'' said McGeechan, who has just competed
his first season as director of coaching at Northampton.
''The game in England is as healthy as it has ever been and much of
that has to do with non-English people. What the RFU forgets is that
what is here today cannot easily be replaced.
''It is ironic to think that John Elliot, a current England selector
and one of the present RFU committee which passed this ruling, was once
a member of Edinburgh Wanderers'.''
McGeechan's Northampton club has signed three Celts -- Gregor Townsend
and Michael Dods, the Gala and Scotland players, and Jonathan Bell, the
Ireland wing/centre who scored one of his side's two tries against
Scotland at Murrayfield this season.
The East Midlands club already has two Scotland players -- Peter
Walton and Ian MacNaughton, who as a Scotland tourist will be classed as
an A player and will hence come under the new legislation.
McGeechan claims that most of the senior clubs in England: ''are
against the new ruling.'' In fact the draft that has emerged -- limiting
the number of non-England international players that any club may field
up to two next season and one the following -- is believed to be a step
down from the more Draconian rules originally proposed.
''The RFU will have to be careful not to alienate the senior clubs in
England. These clubs are a powerful body and have their own ideas of
where the game is going,'' said McGeechan, who thinks that the
experience of playing in the English leagues can only improve players.
''The level of competition and standard of rugby in the first division
is incredible,'' he says.
The new ruling will not be applied to players already in the system
and to those who have been registered in time.
Moreover, it will not apply to the London Exile teams who could, as a
result, benefit considerably, in the sense that Scotland players (A or
senior) might in the future have no choice but go to London Scottish if
circumstances or ambition take them south.
''It should work in our favour,'' said London Scottish secretary John
Smith. ''I have never known the RFU do anything to help us in the past.
My impression is that the senior London clubs think that this is a wrong
move by the RFU.''

Celtic 1, Partick Thistle 3
IF they have been called remarkable often enough this season, Thistle
earned that description, and then some, with another courageous, eager,
and willing performance.
The net result may not entirely have reflected play, although Celtic's
defence was posted missing on a few occasions, but Thistle's heroes were
not paying too much attention to such niceties as they counted three
more points which very nearly guarantee their place in the premier
division next season.
They now are ahead of three other teams in the lower half of the
league with just two games left, and it is surely a remote possibility
that they will fail now.
Celtic, on the other hand, can just about forget their chances of
taking second place and the UEFA Cup spot that goes with it.
They had much more of the play last night, made better chances, and
forced Thistle into long spells of defence, but the Maryhill side's
refusal to concede anything earned them a famous victory.
They had gone behind to a Peter Grant goal in the first half, but his
namesake, Roddy, equalised before half-time (a goal Celtic seemed to
believe was the result of a foul by Wayne Foster) and Thistle had the
impudence to grasp the lead early in the second half through Foster.
Just as Celtic frantically chased the equaliser, the Firhill team
snatched a third goal through Foster again to complete a memorable
night.
In the early evening sunshine in front of a relatively sparse crowd,
it might have been difficult for the teams to appreciate the importance
of it all to begin with. Perhaps that had something to do with the
chance Thistle missed before two minutes had passed.
Chic Charnley had robbed Paul McStay of the ball before laying it
ahead of Roddy Grant, but the striker reacted slowly, and by the time he
turned to shoot, Pat Bonner had smothered the ball.
Pierre van Hooydonk, who had dithered when given a fine pass by Willie
Falconer, made amends soon afterwards when he was involved in the
opening goal after 20 minutes. A long ball from defence reached the
Dutchman, who sent it perfectly in front of Peter Grant, and when he
cleverly manoeuvred around keeper Nicky Walker, he was left with the
simple task of touching the ball into the empty net.
Celtic dominated most of the play that followed, and might have
snatched a second goal when a fine van Hooydonk free kick went over the
bar. But Thistle, as so many clubs have found out, are at their most
threatening when apparently out of the running. They proved it once more
three minutes from half time when a long ball from Walker was captured
by Foster, who touched it on to Roddy Grant, and he had an easy job to
place it over the line, with the Celtic defence in disarray.
Celtic tried to reply immediately and van Hooydonk would have scored
but for a magnificent diving save by Walker.
Thistle replaced Kevin McKee, who had suffered a leg injury, with Alex
Taylor, as they tried to improve on their first half effrontery.
However, it was Celtic who produced the first dangerous move, with
Collins and McKinlay linking on the left before the defender's cross was
delivered to the heart of Thistle's goal, but was cleared for a corner.
Van Hooydonk met the kick powerfully but steered his header a shade
too high.
Once again, Thistle responded in the best possible way, by taking the
lead, albeit in controversial circumstances. Tony Mowbray was penalised
for a foul just outside the area, but protested vigorously, and while he
was still making his point, Charnley chipped the free kick over the
defence where Foster nipped in to shoot past Bonner.
That incensed Mowbray so much that he chased referee Willie Young to
the half-way line where, inevitably, he was booked, to be followed by
McStay who was also shown the yellow card for his protest.
A game that had begun sedately was now on fire and Ian Cameron was
next to be booked for a foul on McStay, with Peter Grant suffering the
same penalty for what did look a relatively minor offence. Referee Young
whipped out another yellow card for Grant's namesake in the Thistle team
when he fouled O'Donnell, but eventually the players did get back to the
playing, and Celtic caused a series of escapades in front of Walker's
goal.
Foster had his name taken for breaking out of the defensive wall as
van Hooydonk took a free kick, but the striker hit the defenders with
his second attempt, too.
Thistle, by now, were defending almost incessantly and their
commitment was demonstrated by Alan Dinnie who, after lying prostrate
when hit by an O'Neil drive, climbed to his feet to head away a van
Hooydonk shot before going down to ground again.
But with five minutes left the irrepressible Firhill men stole off to
score a third goal. A long clearance by Charnley was headed on to Foster
who went past Bonner and knocked the ball into the net.
CELTIC -- Bonner, Boyd, McKinlay, O'Neil, Mowbray, Grant, O'Donnell,
McStay, Falconer, van Hooydonk, Collins. Substitutes -- Vata, Marshall,
McLaughlin.
PARTICK THISTLE -- Walker, McKee, Pittman, Dinnie, Welsh, Smith,
Foster, Craig, Grant, Cameron, Charnley. Substitutes -- Turner, Cairns,
Taylor.
Referee -- W Young (Clarkston).

DEPRESSING best summed up the weather in Glasgow yesterday. And at
Hamilton Crescent, Scotland's cricketers produced a performance to match
the conditions when they were totally outplayed by Yorkshire in their
latest Benson and Hedges Cup tie.
Before this season, the Scots worst showing in this event was a
10-wicket defeat.
This term, Scotland have lost twice by that margin, against
Worcestershire in their opening game, and again yesterday when they were
a distant second, the White Rose county victorious before tea.
It wasn't easy for the home side, and Yorkshire skipper Martyn Moxon,
presented with overcast skies and the promise of rain, could only put
the Scots in when he won the toss.
Play lasted just five balls before the rain arrived, Steve Crawley
managed to get the scoreboard clicking with a single off fit-again
England Test bowler Darren Gough, who later in the day came off second
best in a slide tackle with the fence.
On their return however, and with the score still on one, Gough was on
the the mark, comprehensively bowling George Reifer for a duck.
Scotland overcame that early setback before they suffered a collapse
from which there was no recovery.
From 21 for one, the Scots plunged to 31 for five. West Lothian opener
Crawley knocked a Mark Robinson delivery straight up in the air to Test
all-rounder Craig White at mid-off, the bowler eventually ending with
economical returns of 11-6-8-1.
However, he came second in the Gold Award contest for the man of the
match, with Peter Hartley coming out on top.
The right-arm seamer earned his first wicket with the Scotland score
on 24, Gordon McGurk the victim, the total unchanged when Mike Smith was
bowled behind his legs by spinner Richard Stemp.
Hartley struck again seven runs later, Malcolm Marshall unhappy with
the decision that saw him adjudged caught behind by Richard Blakey,
leaving the former West Indian's contribution in three matches this
season at 38 runs and two wickets.
Against his former employers, Jim Love dug in, and supported by Greig
Williamson, they attempted to salvage some pride, and make Yorkshire
work for their predictable victory.
Williamson and Jim Govan both left the scene while skipper Love was at
the wicket, the Scotland captain applying himself and grinding out an
invaluable half-century.
He moved to within one of his 50 with a 6, completing it off just 75
balls. Love also clubbed seven boundaries in his 54 before being ninth
out and Hartley's fourth wicket.
Chasing 129, Yorkshire looked a side in a hurry, determined not to
have to spend another evening in Glasgow.
None of the Scots attack were spared as Moxon and fellow opener
Michael Vaughan tore into the bowling.
Yorkshire reached 50 in just 10.1 overs, and brought the 100 in 19
overs, Moxon completing his half-century in the process from 70 balls
faced, with ten 4s.
He went on to stroke another boundary, with partner Vaughan also
logging a 50 from 57 balls.

BENSON &amp; HEDGES ROUND-UP
LAURIE Potter returned to Grace Road to sentence Leicestershire to a
repeat of the lowest moment in their Benson and Hedges Cup history
yesterday.
The slow left-armer, released by Leicestershire in 1993 and now
playing for Staffordshire, grabbed a competition-best four for 23 as the
Minor Counties clinched a 26-run victory over last year's championship
runners-up.
It was only the part-timers sixth triumph in the competition and
follows their 131-run win over the same county opponents at Wellington
in 1982.
The Minor Counties looked to be heading for defeat after being
dismissed for 224 in 54.4 overs, with Gordon Parsons claiming three for
46. But Potter and seamer Paul Newman, who grabbed four for 29, teamed
up to dismiss Leicestershire for 198.
The selectors will have taken note of Lancashire's 40-run victory over
holders Warwickshire at Edgbaston, with England skipper Michael Atherton
and opening partner Jason Gallian -- tipped for Test honours this summer
-- both grabbing centuries as the Red Rose county piled up an impressive
305 for two.
Dermot Reeve's triple winners, who lost to Nottinghamshire in their
opening Benson and Hedges Cup match this season, failed to match that
scoring rate and were dismissed for 265.
Another England player in form is Graeme Hick who followed his 109
against Yorkshire last week with 94 in Worcestershire's 103-run
hammering of Northamptonshire.
Graham Gooch, who retired from international cricket at the end of the
winter Ashes tour, collected his twenty-second gold award with his
thirteenth century in the competition as Essex clinched an eight-wicket
victory over the Combined Universities at Fenner's.
And seamer Tim Wren took the gold award on his Benson and Hedges Cup
debut to help Kent complete their second win of the season against
Somerset by 119 runs.
New Zealand Test all-rounder Chris Cairns took advantage of Chris
Lewis' injury to smash Nottinghamshire to their third win against
Durham.
At Fenner's. Combined Universities 209 for seven (G Macmillan 54);
Essex 213 for two (G A Gooch 115 n.o., N Hussain 81 n.o.) Essex beat
Combined Universities by eight wickets.
At Stockton. Durham 268 (W Larkins 80, M Prabhakar 69, J E Morris 51,
C L Cairns 4-47); Nottinghamshire 271 for five (R T Robinson 84, P
Johnson 56 n.o., P R Pollard 56). Nottinghamshire beat Durham by five
wickets.
At Bristol. Gloucestershire 186 for eight; Middlesex 181.
Gloucestershire beat Middlesex by 5 runs.
At Southampton. Hampshire 225 for six (R A Smith 83, J P Stephenson
55);  Glamorgan 227 for three (S P James 54, D L Hemp 52). Glamorgan
beat Hampshire by seven wickets.
At Canterbury. Kent 280 for six (T R Ward 113); Somerset 161 (T N Wren
6-41). Kent beat Somerset by 119 runs.
At Leicester. Minor Counties 224 (I Cockbain 65 n.o.); Leicestershire
198 (T J Boon 54, L Potter 4-23, P G Newman 4-29). Minor Counties beat
Leicestershire by 26 runs.
At Northampton. Worcestershire 240 for seven (G A Hick 94, K M Curran
4-38); Northamptonshire 137 (K M Curran 50, R K Illingworth 4-27).
Worcestershire beat Northamptonshire by 103 runs.
At The Foster's Oval. Surrey 239 for seven (A D Brown 82, D M Ward 60
n.o.); Sussex 240 for two (C W J Athey 97, N J Lenham 73 n.o.). Sussex
beat Surrey by eight wickets.
At Edgbaston. Lancashire 305 for two (J E R Gallian 116 n.o., M A
Atherton 114, N H Fairbrother 60 n.o.); Warwickshire 265 (A J Moles 89,
D P Ostler 73). Lancashire beat Warwickshire by 40 runs.

I WAS sad to read the other day of the death of Stewart McPherson. Now
if you haven't quite been in the radio ring for a half century yet, the
name will probably mean absolutely nothing to you. Though I never met
the man, he was an integral part of my childhood.
Stewart McPherson was a Canadian who came to London to work for the
BBC in the late forties. He had a mellow voice, a slick turn of phrase,
and a well developed sense of the grand occasion. Soon he was attracting
millions of listeners -- especially to his sports broadcasts.
We would sit in our house, scorecards at the ready, while Stewart
described the action at the big fights. Bruce Woodcock, Freddie Mills,
Randolph Turpin, they even sent him to cover one of Joe Louis' bouts in
America.
When McPherson took a breather at the end of each round, in would come
W Barrington Dalby with his summary.
I suppose my generation contains the last of the radio sports kids; we
travelled the world on the wireless.
When Raymond Glendenning used to give his football commentaries from
Wembley, my brother and I used to take opposite sides -- he was younger,
so I made him be England -- and when the radio man said: ''Frank Swift
tips it over the top'' one or other of us would hurl ourself across the
room. They would send in someone from the social work department
nowadays.
It is a little-known fact, but I actually scored more last-minute
goals for Scotland than Lawrie Reilly.
On the radio rugby scene, we had such as Andrew ''Jock'' Wemyss, whose
favourite exhortation, which they probably heard on the field, was
''Feet, Scotland, Feet'' yelled into the microphone in the most
bloodcurdling manner. Jock never pretended to be neutral.
He was a splendid man whom I was privileged to know in the later part
of his life. Jock, capped before and after the First World War in which
he lost an eye, left you in no doubt that it was him on the airwaves.
Eamonn Andrews was another who was a distinguised radio sports
broadcaster long before he was into big red books. The Irish were born
to be on air -- no-one has ever quite described a horse race like
Michael O'Hare of RTE.
Tennis was another favourite in radio days. Max Robertson would have
the backhand volleys screaming across court while Fred Perry, another
recent loss, would not be slow to supply some ascerbic wit.
Wimbledon was their Command Performance and when I first saw the
Centre Court, a good 25 years after listening to them describing the
action, it was exactly how they had pictured it for me in my mind's eye.
Radio cricket was turned into something of an art form by Brian
Johnston and his mates. Sending cream cakes to Johnners became the
pre-occupation of middle England.
I know television is more revealing, the techniques ever more skilful.
Yet you don't require imagination to stare at a screen.
Radio rolls on. I heard a very exciting commentary of Hearts and
Aberdeen in the car on Saturday. Iain Anderson and Ian Robertson
continue to demonstrate how to commentate on rugby.
Sometimes one can swing the lead a little on the wireless. After all,
Ronald Reagan began his career doing baseball commentaries on games he
was not at; a friend phoned him with progress from time to time.
I have been lucky enough to do a bit of sports broadcasting myself. On
one live programme I informed the listeners that Bruce White, the Hawick
winger, had departed the scene ''with a recurrence of the groin injury
which had made him doubtful from the start.''
Ten minutes later, White reappeared with his head bandaged. I said
nothing. You could not have got away that on television!
Thanks for the memories, Stewart.

ONE of the traits that often distinguish a true champion from a mere
also-ran is the capacity to remain cool in the face of adversity. Take
Matt Berlin.
By day, he is a sanitation worker in Oswego, New York. By night, he is
a 10-pin bowler supreme. Evidence of his expertise was coming thick and
fast on the evening of April 12, when Berlin bowled strike after strike
at Marcel's Pinarama Bowl in downtown Oswego. In fact, Berlin was in the
form of his life. As he stood at the end of his lane, he was just one
strike shy of a perfect game. All eyes were trained on him as he
prepared to take his final attempt. Then, without warning, all power in
the building failed.
''Not only was it pitch black,'' recounted Berlin later, ''but there
were no sounds. Normally you hear the hum of the machines and the smack
of pins being knocked down, but there was nothing.''
The question was, though, was there anything he could do to salvage
his once-in-a-lifetime shot at perfection? After a one-hour lane-side
conference with some bowling colleagues, a solution was reached.
Every flashlight in the house was retrieved and trained in Berlin's
lane. Some even stood with cigarette-lighters in an attempt to cast
whatever light they could on the 10 hazy-looking pins. Cool as could be,
Berlin steadied himself, rolled his bowl and nailed his final strike
with the grace of a true pro.
He was unavailable for comment immediately afterward. He lay on the
wooden floor, buried beneath a dozen of his new found fans.
* BASKETBALL star Shaquille O'Neal of Orlando Magic is a superstar
second only to the great Michael Jordan. However, his business sense may
exceed that of Jordan, at least when it comes to gaining exposure for
his sponsors.
During a recent interview, Tom Brokaw of NBC enquired of O'Neal:
''This is a serious question. What do you want to be when you grow up?''
Probably, so innocuous a question deserved a similar response, which
O'Neal promptly delivered. ''I want to be a successful entrepreneur such
as yourself,'' he replied. ''I want to be happy. I want always to drink
Pepsi.''
O'Neal, of course, would never concede that he is an advocate of crass
commercialism. When asked by another reporter if a recent win was
intended to send a message to Jordan and his Chicago Bulls, O'Neal
responded: ''I don't send messages. I'm not a fax machine.''
Unless, of course, the message means money.
* ALTHOUGH Michael Jordan may have returned to basketball, his
presence is still very much felt in the clubhouse of the Birmingham
Barons, the Alabama baseball team for which he played during his sojourn
away from his favourite sport. Jordan hats, T-shirts, and souvenirs are
still available in Birmingham, and his picture even appeared on the
front of a recent Barons game programme.
The effect of Jordan's absence is being felt in many tangible ways.
For example, last year, on the day of his first game for the Barons, the
team office received 130 requests for press credentials. For their
recent season opening game, a mere 12 were handed out.
Possibly of even greater significance to the players is that their
cuisine is no longer quite what it was.
''A local barbecue place must have fed the guys for free 30 times,''
recalled clubhouse manager Cory Sifford. ''All it asked for was a couple
of baseballs with Michael's autograph.''
These days, the guys have to pay.
* IT was reported that Steve Robinson, coach of the basketball team at
the University of Tulsa, had an outstanding high-school prospect in his
pocket who was ready to move on to his team. Robinson's dry reply said
it all.''If he's in my back pocket, he's too small to play for Tulsa.''
* SPORT in New York must be different from any other location in the
world. That would be the impression of anyone listening to Pat Riley,
coach of the renowned New York Knicks basketball team.
Asked to identify the best thing about his job, he stated: ''It's the
unbelievably dignified and objective approach of the New York media.''
Seriously.

ATHLETICS
ABERDEEN, robbed of the Scottish track and field championships last
year, when their offer was spiked in preference to one of inferior value
from Edinburgh, will have the consolation this season of hosting the
national multi-event championships on July 15 and 16.
Aberdeen's offer was shelved because the event was held over two days,
including Friday, which was felt inappropriate for competitors who might
have to travel after work.
But the Scottish Athletic Federation, recognising the city's
significant commitment to the sport, particularly development, through
the Grampian Active-8 scheme, and the drive to introduce all young
athletes to a range of events, is delighted to take this year's event
north.
The current native decathlon record was set at the city's Chris
Anderson stadium by local athlete Duncan Mathieson when last the
championships were staged there in 1989.
The multi-event championships are open to male and female athletes of
all age groups. The SAF under-20 and senior relay championships will
also be at the same venue on July 16. Entry closes June 26.

MARTIN Hyman, the former Olympic track athlete, reckons he caused
''some consternation'' when he condemned Scotland's planned venue for
this year's World Mountain Running Trophy.
Hyman, ex-assistant head of Inveralmond High School and course
director for the event, to be hosted in Edinburgh on September 10, had
been expected to lay his race routes on a mountain.
''I was asked to draw up a course on Cairngorm,'' he said. ''But it's
a horrid place. I said I'd rather run up Arthur's Seat.'' And so it has
turned out. The Scottish Athletic Federation has helped to secure more
than #30,000 funding in a package which still leaves room for a title
sponsor at around #15,000.
The Scottish Sports Council has offered #15,000, and with a newly
confirmed #10,000 from the Foundation for Sports and the Arts, and #5500
from Edinburgh District Council, some 200 athletes from 20 countries
will now assault the 800ft extinct volcano in the heart of the Scottish
capital.
Hyman insists his chosen location sacrifices nothing in satisfying
officialdom. ''It's a clover-leaf course with 12,000 metres of
challenging running, and actually exceeds the stipulated 2500 feet of
climbing.''
A veteran of competition in 32 countries, he recalls often having sat
for up to five hours in desolate airports waiting for fellow contestants
to arrive, only to be taken by bus to a remote venue without amenities.
''In Edinburgh, runners can walk from where they will stay -- at the
university's Pollock Halls -- to recce the course.''
Use of Arthur's Seat also means that a spectacle usually denied to
spectators because of poor access and visibility promises to be a top
attraction. The largest part of the course is in view from the start.
Planning three courses, however, was an uphill struggle. It took two
and a half years of delicate negotiation to win over Historic Scotland,
who control access to Holyrood Park. With the proviso that courses do
not stray into environmentally unacceptable areas, permission was
granted, though runners will not be allowed to go to the summit.
A necessary compromise was to switch the open race, the day before the
championship, to the Pentlands.
The championship, an annual event last held in Britain in 1990,
comprises three races: senior and under-20 men, and an open race for
women.
Hyman spent 10 days surveying the terrain. ''Every time the gradient
changes, you have to measure the distance and feed it into a computer.''
The governing body insisted on modifications. ''I worked on the first
draft for six months, then re-did it all. I got to a stage I wasn't
enjoying it any more.''
Despite his efforts, the routes will not satisfy everyone. Hill
running in Europe means running from base to summit, where the race
ends. British devotees, who prefer the term fell-running, expect to run
up and down, and many specialise in the art of fast descent.
The global split between the two schools has forced a compromise on
the international committee: the world trophy will cater for each, on
alternate years.
But staging the event in such a high-profile location will, Hyman
believes, provide an enormous shot in the arm for Scottish hill-running.
Italy is the sport's dominant nation, its runners enjoying generous
resources and altitude training facilities. Italy's team (six runners
per country) could provide entertaining footage for the TV cameras
Martin Hyman hopes might cover the event.

SOUTH Americans Juan Ferreri and Dario Ubriaco will not be part of
Dundee United's desperate bid for premier division survival, and it
could be that neither player will be back at Tannadice, no matter how
the relegation issue is resolved in their remaining two matches against
Aberdeen and Celtic.
Midfielder Ferreri, a #250,000 buy at the turn of the year, and
centre-back Ubriaco, who joined United on a short-term contract just
before the transfer deadline, have returned home to Uruguay.
United manager Billy Kirkwood said last night: ''In the case of
Ubriaco, the move didn't work out. As he was only on a short-term deal,
we have come to an agreement over his release.
''Ferreri is a different case, because he still has a full year of his
deal left with United. He has found it difficult to settle in Scotland,
and has gone back home while his agent attempts to find him another
club. But if he doesn't get a new team he will be back with us for
pre-season training.''
Kirkwood also revealed yesterday that no further disciplinary action
will be taken against Gordan Petric for his part in the incident which
led to his red card along with Gordon Hunter during last Saturday's 1-0
defeat by Hibs.
United will monitor the fitness of striker Craig Brewster this week
before deciding if they can include him against Aberdeen at Pittodrie on
Saturday. He has been out since he broke a toe a month ago in Kirkwood's
first game in charge against Rangers.
But Brazilian striker Sergio, omitted from the 14 for the Hibs game,
is back in the running for the New Firm clash.

JUVENTUS and Parma, currently Italy's two leading clubs, are both full
of optimism as they approach today's first leg of the UEFA Cup final in
Parma.
This is the first of five clashes over the next six weeks between the
sides, who are also scheduled to meet in the league and in the
two-legged Italian Cup final.
League leaders Juventus are eight points clear of Parma and confirmed
their current form with a 4-1 win away to Fiorentina on Sunday, their
first success at the venue for 13 years. But Parma are also on a good
recent run, beating in-form Internazionale 3-0 and relegated Brescia
2-1.
Juventus have won the UEFA Cup on three occasions -- in 1977, 1990,
and 1993 -- while Parma are bidding to land the trophy for the first
time.
This will be Parma's third successive European final, following their
victory in the Cup-winners' Cup in 1993 and a losing appearance in the
final of the same competition against Arsenal last season.
It is also the third all-Italian final in six seasons and the seventh
successive campaign that at least one Italian team has reached the UEFA
Cup final.
Juventus will be without at least five first-choice defenders, but
coach Marcello Lippi remains confident. ''I don't think that the Parma
we meet in the UEFA Cup final will be all that different from the one we
played in the league,'' he said.
Juventus won 3-1 at Parma in January, a win which set them off on
their championship run.
Parma are looking to the past for inspiration, recalling a 2-0 win
against Juventus in the Italian Cup final of May 1992. They will line up
close to full strength, with only long-term injured Swede Tomas Brolin
and suspended midfielder Massimo Crippa ruled out.
Coach Nevio Scala is as confident as his opposite number and said:
''Parma and Juventus are equal, we have nothing more and nothing less
than them.
''Juventus have been more consistent in the league, but we've no
recriminations or regrets about that -- that's just the way it went.''

ROY Aitken has won another round in his battle to save Aberdeen by
re-signing 10 of his brightest prospects. Fears that the Pittodrie club
would face a mass exodus of players at the end of the season have now
diminished.
The Dons had 26 out of contract, but Aitken has convinced players to
commit their future to the club.
None of the 10 are first-team players, but they are still vital to
Aberdeen's plans. And the fact that Aitken has been involved in issuing
new contracts is further confirmation that he is the man the Pittodrie
club want.
Now he will have fresh talks with the remaining players, whose
contracts expire next month, and will seek clarification on where first
team men Stephen Wright, Scott Booth, Paul Kane and Brian Irvine see
their future.
All will be offered lucrative terms to stay, but Scotland defender
Wright seems ready to leave, with Rangers and Newcastle United heading
the queue to sign him.
Defender John Inglis will return against Rangers reserves tonight. If
there is no reaction to his hamstring injury, he will be in line for a
place in the relegation crunch against Dundee United.
Goalkeeper Theo Snelders could also return in the New Firm derby to
strengthen Aitken's options, but midfielder Ray McKinnon is out with an
ankle knock.''
Midfielder Peter Hetherston will miss Dons' last-day visit to Falkirk.
A booking at Tynecastle on Saturday took him over the 16-point mark.
With top scorer Billy Dodds also suspended for the trip on May 13, it
gives Roy Aitken further problems.

ST ELMO'S Fire (5-1) came good at the twenty-fourth attempt last night
when the 10-year-old former eventer won the #7000 George Inter
Continental Edinburgh Trophy Novice Chase at Kelso.
Trained in Fife by Jim Barclay, St Elmo's Fire has come close in
recent weeks. At Kelso in March, when a 66-1 outsider, he was just
beaten by Wee River, and six days ago at Perth he ran well again when
third to Clay County in a hot two-mile chase.
St Elmo's Fire was left in the lead at the second-last when Spectre
Brown unseated his jockey. On the long uphill climb to the post, the
winner stayed on bravely to hold off Mils Mig, who was giving away a
stone.
It was Barclay's fifth winner, exactly the total he set himself for
his first season since taking out a licence.
The winner is owned by whisky company chairman Peter Russell, whose
daughter, Lucinda, hunted and evented the gelding after a previous
unsuccessful career in National Hunt racing.
Barclay said: ''He should win again soon, as the firm ground suits
him. He'll keep going throughout the summer.''
* THE Jockey Club said yesterday that it expects the latest TV expose
on racing to be ''an over-hyped mixture of fantasy and history'' and
contain no recent evidence of non-triers.
The investigative sports series Fair Game, to be shown on Channel 4 a
week tomorrow, will feature an unidentified jockey giving an ''insider's
guide to non-triers''.
It aims to highlight the perils of betting, but the Jockey Club, who
police the sport, said the problem has been virtually eradicated and any
information should be passed on to them.

UNLIKE Scotland's premier division title race, if it could be called
that, the English Premiership looks likely to continue right to a
photo-finish after the stumble of Blackburn Rovers against West Ham at
Upton Park on Sunday.
The championship seemed to have been virtually decided as the team
managed by Kenny Dalglish went into the home straight well clear of
champions Manchester United. Now, after United beat Coventry City 3-2 on
Monday, there is, almost literally, a new ball game.
The five points which separate Blackburn from the side managed by
another Scot, Alex Ferguson, do not represent an unbridgeable gap unless
Rovers can complete their final two games with a 100 per cent record. As
they are due to meet Newcastle United at Ewood Park on Monday and then
Liverpool at Anfield the following Sunday, the task is clearly not
simple.
United, on the other hand, having more or less accepted that the third
successive championship was beyond reach, have suddenly discovered a new
motivation, entirely divorced from their determination to win the FA Cup
again. The double for the second year in succession is once again a
possibility but they need another Blackburn slip, even although they
have one extra game to play.
Ferguson, who has had to cope with serious long term absentees from
his squad, among them the volatile and controversial Eric Cantona, will
not let the team problems divert United's renewed commitment to the
title. As well as the Frenchman, Paul Parker and Roy Keane are out of
action and Ryan Giggs, who has missed the last three games, and Steve
Bruce, also absent from the Coventry victory, are not certain to be back
for the run-in.
Said Ferguson: ''We have got to be very careful when we bring Ryan
back because hamstring injuries can be very nasty. And Brucie is
struggling, too.
''It is marvellous the contribution our youngsters are making to the
team, though, and even with Paul Ince available again from suspension
for Sunday's game against Sheffield Wednesday, I may not change the
team.
''Young Paul Scholes did a magnificent job in midfield for us against
Coventry as well as scoring a terrific goal.''
United's last two games are against Southampton and West Ham. Before
then Ferguson hopes to hear that Gary Neville, who was booked against
Coventry, will escape the suspension that would mean his being ruled out
of the cup final, but that depends on the FA's assessment of his record
now that he has reached the punishment threshold of 41 points.
One Scot who would love to have been able to help Blackburn's cause,
Kevin Gallacher, is not at all enamoured at being forced to watch from
the stand as his team go throught the final ordeal. Gallacher, who
suffered a second broken leg in his comeback following injury, may be
even more nervous than his mates on the park.
''I would love to be out there playing rather than watching from the
stand,'' he said.
''It would be two fantastic results if we could win both games, but
that's what we have to aim for. We've had a couple of slip-ups recently
and United have continued to pick up the points, putting on the
pressure.
''But it's not showing among our players. Everyone is very chirpy and
it really is business as usual at the ground.''

THE SRU confirmed yesterday that they will pay travelling expenses to
clubs taking part in away matches during next year's inaugural National
Cup Competition, thereby confirming the start of the tournament itself.
''We are looking to arrive at a fair formula that will benefit
visiting teams and allow them to receive expenses for their efforts,''
said SRU chief executive Bill Hogg.
Hogg also said that although the number of clubs invited to take part
next year is limited to 102, it may be open to all rugby clubs in
Scotland the following season.
''I can also confirm that we have had over 10 companies expressing an
interest in sponsoring the competition.''
The Herald understands that Tennent Caledonian Breweries are among the
companies involved. ''We have never made a secret of the fact that we
believe that a Cup competition would be a good thing for Scottish rugby
if it could be fitted into the domestic season,'' said Scott Meneer,
sponsorship manager with Tennents.

INTERNATIONAL Board (IRB) president Bernard Lapasset said yesterday
that the rules on amateurism were being flouted and were no longer
tenable.
But Lapasset, who is also president of the French Rugby Federation,
told Reuters there was not enough money in the game to support
out-and-out professionalism.
''We must stop being hypocritical,'' he said. ''Money is a part of the
development the game needs. The rules of the Board have been flouted and
are no longer tenable. We have to find new rules.''
The IRB are meeting in Paris in August to discuss player payments but
Lapasset said he was against full professionalism because small but
traditionally strong federations such as Scotland, Wales, and Ireland
would be at a disadvantage. He added: ''Rugby is not so developed on a
world scale that it could opt for the professionalism seen in other
sports such as soccer.''
Lapasset pointed out that the budget of the whole French Federation --
around #34m a year -- was the same as just one French soccer club, Paris
St Germain.

SCOTLAND'S capacity for perpetrating self-inflicted wounds in
foursomes golf cost them yesterday in the international against Sweden
at the Loch Lomond club.
Having lost the first series 2-1, they lost all three in the second,
and those five points enabled Sweden to win by 10.5-7.5, their second
victory in six encounters.
Down 8-4 at lunch, Scotland faced a task for which uphill was an
inadequate description, the legacy of their recent record in the home
internationals. In their last nine forays into foursomes competition,
their teams have won only one series and so yesterday, whereas Sweden
needed only 1.5pts from six singles Scotland's 5.5pt requirement was an
improbable target.
To win the singles 3.5-2.5 was a face-saving achievement but, of
course, the time to play well enough to win is when the match is in the
balance, not when the issue is all but resolved in the opposition's
favour. On the other hand, Sweden's superior competence, concentration
and control entitled them to their success.
Sweden are probably among the two or three strongest countries in
Europe at this level, and Scotland's captain, Colin Dalgleish, although
offering no excuses, felt that on a tough but fair course it was easy to
make bogeys or worse and lose holes to opponents who did not give much
away.
The banks of musical fame were less than bonnie under leaden,
drizzling skies and a similar depression descended on Scotland, a point
behind after Monday's play as the sinking feeling which almost caused
Tom Weiskopf to be consumed by a peat bog into which he stepped on a
recent inspection of the course he helped design.
Weiskopf was on his own and trapped up to his neck for more than four
hours until rescued. Scotland, however, began to sink beyond redemption
quickly. Hugh McKibbin and David Downie had only three pars in the first
nine holes and were then seven down to opponents who eventually were one
over par for the 12-holes played.
Gordon Sherry and Stephen Gallacher were two up and three to play only
for the latter, whose driving was ''all over the place,'' to drive left
and unplayable at the sixteenth and left again into the loch at the last
so that Sweden won both holes with bogey fives.
Graham Rankin and Barclay Howard, one up after eleven, lost the next
three, two to birdies.
Whereas McKibbin, in winning his singles as convincingly as did Rankin
and, although by a longer process, Sherry, earned three points from
four, the side's best individual performance, Gallacher, who took full
points in the match against France earlier this year, emerged this time
with only half a point.
But once again from two up with three to play Gallacher, winner of the
season's opening event, the Champion of Champions, fell foul of the
sixteenth and eighteenth. This time three putts from long range at the
former, where Daniel Olsson saved a winning par from off the green, and
a bunkered drive at the latter were his undoing.
The opportunity now arises for the public to test their games over the
course, and such has been the response to the scheme to accommodate
members of clubs affiliated to the Scottish Golf Union, that the 280
starting times made available from May to September for 1120 players
have been taken, ensuring that #50,000 will go to coaching junior
golfers. Results:
Foursomes -- H McKibbin and D Downie lost to V Gustavsson and M
Eliasson, 7 and 6; G Sherry and S Gallacher lost to F Henge and D Olsson
1 hole; G Rankin and B Howard lost to M Erlandsson and J Selberg 2 and
1. Result -- Scotland 0, Sweden 3.
Singles -- McKibbin beat Henge 4 and 3; Gallacher halved with Olsson;
Downie lost to Selberg 5 and 3; Rankin beat Erlandsson 5 and 3; Howard
lost to Eliasson 2 holes; Sherry beat Gustavsson 2 and 1. Result --
Scotland 3[1/2], Sweden 2[1/2].
Second day's result -- Scotland 3[1/2], Sweden 5[1/2]. Match result --
Scotland 7[1/2], Sweden 10[1/2].

PETER Nicol has risen one place to No.4 in the latest world squash
rankings.
Despite struggling all season with illness, the 22-year-old Scottish
champion from Inverurie is headed only by Jansher Khan, Peter Marshall,
and Rodney Eyles. But recent throat problems have forced Nicol to
undergo a tonsil operation in June.
Oban's Martin Heath, who won two events last month, rises five places
to No.33, while Stuart Cowie, unbeaten on his Scotland debut at last
week's European Championships, jumps from No.82 to No.74.

SCOTLAND coach Allan Turner has named five new caps for this month's
first stage of the European Championships in Lugano, Switzerland.
They include Edinburgh-born Stuart Tait, a Canadian student who has
never played in Scotland but who holds a British passport.
By contrast, red tape has ruled out Iceland-born Paul Bjarnason, who
has lived in Scotland since he was just 11 months old and has held a
British passport since 1984.
FIBA, the international governing body, insist that, because Scotland
did not register Bjarnason as Scottish, they regard him as Icelandic and
his clearance with them requires a change of status -- which normally
takes three years from the date of registration.
It is a desperate blow for the Edinburgh policeman, who, 11 years ago,
was knocked back by FIBA when about to represent Scotland in a European
junior championship. He did not have a British passport then, having
always travelled on his Scottish mother's British passport.
After an outstanding season with Edinburgh Burger Kings, he was set
for international recognition again. ''I cannot believe that I am having
to go through all this again,'' Bjarnason said yesterday. ''At 29 I
haven't exactly got time on my side.''
The SBA have appealed to FIBA to overturn the decision, claiming there
had been correspondence on the subject 11 years ago. But neither they
nor FIBA have kept copies.
Turner's other new caps are Paisley centre Stuart Glass, David Norval
and Gordon Smith, both of Livingston Bulls, and Grant Forrest of
Edinburgh Burger Kings.
Alan Kiddie (Glasgow Brightsiders), Derek Frame (Edinburgh Burger
Kings) and veteran Bobby Archibald (Livingston Bulls) were unavailable
through injury or work commitments. The full squad is:
P Birch, C Brownlie, T McDaid (all Glasgow Brightsiders), A Lamb, I
Maclean, D Norval, A Ryan, G Smith (all Edinburgh Burger Kings), S
Glass, J Mitchell (both Paisley), G Forrest (Edinburgh Burger Kings), S
Tait (Laurentian University, Ontario). Coach: A Turner (Team Corsa).
Assistant: A McDonald (Paisley). Manager: T Campbell (Troon).

CHRISTIAN Flight completed a rags-to-riches story with victory in the
Bradmore Fillies' Handicap at Nottingham.
The six-year-old battled to a neck victory over Le Bal at odds of 20-1
-- and 59-1 on the Tote.
Trainer Steve Gollings explained: ''She has had to overcome a lot to
win this. She ended up at Melton Sales last year and when Derek and Jill
Holland bought her as a hack last year, she was in a poor condition.
''But they fed her up and thought of putting her in training with me,
as she was a racehorse.
''However, it has been a hard slog to get her to fitness. She has to
wear a tongue strap but she has been running consistently on the
all-weather and deserved to win. She is a credit to her owners.''

ENGLAND ended Scotland's winning run in the men's qualifying
tournament of the European under-21 championship in Genoa, Italy, with a
5-1 scoreline last night. Now the Scots must secure at least a draw
against their hosts this afternoon to keep alive their hopes of a place
in next season's finals in Denmark.
Scotland spent the first eight minutes camped inside English territory
but then, as manager Harry Coles admitted: ''We got swept away.''
England proceeded to hit three goals in three minutes through Darren
Hall (two) and Nick Conway. The Scots' heads went down and England
capitalised with further goals in 22 and 26 minutes by Conway and Ashley
Garratt.
They eased off after the break and Graham Joyce cut the deficit three
minutes from time with a penalty. As Coles observed, the difference
between the sides was pace. Results:
Switzerland 1, Gibraltar 3; Italy 4, Gibraltar 1; England 5, Scotland
1.
Standings (after three games apiece): England 6pts (goals 18-2); Italy
6 (9-2); Scotland 4 (7-5); Portugal 2( 3-6); Switzerland 0 (2-10);
Gibraltar 0 (2-16).
* SCOTLAND'S women lost 5-1 to the Czech Republic in Poznan, Poland,
yesterday, just 24 hours after being overwhelmed 1-11 by the Ukraine,
and so will not contest the finals of the European Under-21 Championship
next year.
Only 18 months ago the Scots contested the finals of the World Cup.
They are now cast into the international wilderness for at least three
years, as they paid the price for lack of international preparation,
with 14 members of the squad haing been required to fulfil club
commitments on the final training weekend.
There was a glimmer of hope yesterday when Haley Welsh equalised in 12
minutes, but they conceded a second goal seven minutes later. Eva
Stankova scored four for the Czechs. Results:
Group A -- Czech Republic 5, Scotland 1; Poland 1, Ukraine 2.
Placings: 1, Ukraine 4pts; 2, Czech Republic 4; 3, Poland 0; 4,
Scotland 0.

Madrid,
Madrid County Select 16, Scotland 27
FIERCE electrical storms flashed and forked around the magnificent
Madrid municipal stadium last night as Scotland got their pre-World Cup
campaign off to a shaky and unconvincing start.
The pyrotechnics in the sky were spectacular enough to have had
youngsters hiding under the bedclothes, and for much of the game that's
where the Scots seemed to be as well.
Ultimately, the Scots were convincing enough winners but it was not
until 65 minutes that they pulled away from an unexpectedly competent
Madrid side, containing a smattering of Frenchmen and five of those who
will be in the Spanish national side to meet Scotland on Saturday.
For much of the opening period the Scottish game lacked structure and
purpose. However, it would be churlish to be over-critical, as many of
last night's side had been in need of a serious outing. And that they
certainly received.
Afterwards coach Dougie Morgan, although pleased that his side had
finally strung together a winning performance, said that the Scots had
not been ruthless enough.
''We said before the game that sides like Australia and New Zealand
take sides like this to the cleaners. We must not get carried away with
the success that we have had this year, good though the results have
been. We must learn to be more ruthless,'' he said.
Manager Duncan Paterson declared that he had been disappointed with
the Scottish performance. ''We were much too loose in the opening 20
minutes and the opening period in any game is vital.''
The Scottish captain, Kevin McKenzie, said that he was happy enough at
the manner in which his side had overcome the appalling conditions and a
Madrid combine which had been very fired up for the occasion.
''We had lots of trouble with their guys coming over the top all the
time. The referee wasn't doing much about it and when we tried to sort
it out for ourselves, the ref was penalising us,'' he said.
The Scottish hierarchy acknowledged the irony of the fact that they
had come to Spain to play in ''top of the ground'' conditions that they
could expect in South Africa, but had found, as they opened their
Spanish venture, that the rain in Spain does not always fall only on the
plain.
Plus points for Scotland were to be found in the fact that young Craig
Joiner, with a hat trick of tries, continued to underline his worth as
an international striker and the welcome news that the Stirling County
centre, Ian Jardine, came through his international return unscathed.
Madrid went into the lead after 10 minutes with a drop goal by Andrei
Kovalenko. Joiner had the first of his tries after 21 minutes, Scott
Hastings sending him in via the blind-side from 20 metres out. Graham
Shiel missed with the conversion, as he was to do on all but a single
occasion throughout. Madrid took the lead 10 minutes later through a
Nicolas Duboscq penalty goal and a minute before half-time they went
further ahead with a Duboscq try and conversion.
In the second half Scotland found themselves battling against the
elements again, the fierce wind having changed direction during the
half-time break.
Nevertheless, the Scots began with a flourish and Joiner's second try.
His hat trick came three minutes later and it gave the Scots a slender
two-point lead.
Duboscq kicked Madrid back in front with another penalty goal after 55
minutes but, as the second half progressed, the Scots finally began to
get the measure of the Madrid side.
Jeremy Richardson drove over for a try after a series of scrummages on
the Madrid line and eight minutes from the end the Scots were awarded a
penalty try as Madrid collapsed a scrummage on their line. Shiel goaled
from in front of the posts.
Scotland -- S Hastings (Watsonians); C A Joiner (Melrose), A G Stanger
(Hawick), I C Jardine (Stirling County), I C Glasgow (Heriot's FP); A G
Shiel (Melrose), D W Patterson (West Hartlepool); J J Manson (Dundee HS
FP), K D McKenzie (Stirling County), A P Burnell (London Scottish), J F
Richardson (Edinburgh Academicals), S J Campbell (Dundee HS FP), P
Walton (Northampton), E W Peters (Bath), I R Smith (Gloucester).
Madrid County Select -- Puertas; Saenz, Duboscq, Polidori, Robles;

Ross Finlay is taken with the new breed of French models
AT the original press launch of the Renault Laguna, those of my
colleagues who always ask when there is going to be a diesel version
were told to contain themselves, and those of us who remarked that the
entry-level cars were feeble performers were given a similar answer.
Renault has just filled various gaps in the Laguna range, which is
looking much more competitive as a result.
Even without the new models now in the showrooms, Renault's
performance in the UK, which over the decades has been a rollercoaster
affair, is definitely on the up. In fact, last year's sales of more than
112,000 units were the best the company has recorded here since 1902.
And the results from the first few months of this year suggest that 1995
may see the figures increase still further.
The Laguna is Renault's most stylish car, not just in its exterior
lines but also in its attractively designed cabin. Very few European
manufacturers have Renault's imaginative way with fabric designs, and
the way the front doors curve round to incorporate the vents which are
usually set at each end of the fascia is particularly neat.
From a bodywork and equipment point of view, the new cars are much the
same as other models in the range. It is the engines which set them
apart. There is new 2.2-litre multivalve diesel -- the only engine in
its class with three valves per cylinder -- installed in an RN
specification car at #11,955, an RT at #13,035 and a top ranking RXE at
#14,810. The last price is also the showroom tag for the new RTi
two-litre 16-valve petrol version.
The initial driving exercise for both cars was in Holland, which means
that I have no idea how they perform on gradients longer than those
involved in climbing over ''sleeping policemen'', and little more
experience of their ride quality on poor surfaces.
For both spirit-levelled roads, and surface textures which keep tyre
noise to a minimum, the Dutch have us licked to a frazzle. So it was
quite sporting of Renault to hunt out one section of canalside minor
road which was actually rippled and cracked.
The petrol-fuelled RTi engine is a four-cylinder version of the Volvo
unit to which Renault fell heir during the two companies' brief
collaboration. It benefits from all-aluminium construction, twin
camshafts and -- as Renault is very keen to point out -- plenty of input
from French engineers as well as the Swedes.
With 140bhp to play with -- a very high power output for the class --
here is a two-litre Laguna that really gets off its mark. It manages the
0-60mph sprint in about 9.5 seconds and goes on to a test track maximum
over 125mph. The gears are closely stacked, mid-range performance is
strong, while both flexibility and response are much improved. You can
expect fuel returns around 41mpg at 56mph, 32 at 75 and 26mpg in town.
The multivalve diesel comes into a market segment which is, curiously
enough, more buoyant in the UK than in Europe as a whole. Renault has
taken an extra stride here in giving the new Laguna diesel a 2.2-litre
capacity, when most direct rivals make do with two litres.
In its peak power output of 85bhp, the unblown diesel Laguna is not
far short of the most powerful 1.8-litre turbo diesels. It feels
unexpectedly perky, combining a top speed around 110mph with 0-60mph
acceleration in 15 seconds. In fuel consumption terms it should be good
for 57mpg, 42mpg and 34mpg at 56mph, 75mph and on the urban cycle
respectively.
Among their various price-band specifications the new Lagunas are well
equipped compared with their rivals. The introductory drives suggested
that they are pleasant cars on the kind of straight and smooth road
network the Dutch enjoy, and I am sure that both of them, but the diesel
in particular, will show up well on the hillier, bendier and bumpier
roads we have here at home.

ADDING a conservatory or installing double glazing are among the most
popular current home improvements, and provide the most scope for
transforming your home and lifestyle.
Given a free choice of housebuilding materials, some of today's most
creative architects will use lots of glass when designing a home,
because modern glass can provide all the benefits of warmth and security
associated with traditional materials such as stone and brick.
Lots of glass means lots of light. The house and garden can be
integrated and skyscapes, seascapes, cityscapes or views of surrounding
countryside can come indoors. Careful planning prevents privacy from
being disturbed, and controls the amount of light over the course of the
day and throughout the seasons, so that the properties of bright natural
light are enhanced, and glare and noise are eliminated.
Some homeowners add a conservatory to a traditional home, and enjoy
the contrast. But just as often, once conservatory owners have enjoyed
the experience of living surrounded by bright, natural light, they find
ways of increasing the amount of glass elsewhere in the house, making
the living area light, bright and airy.
If you have a heated conservatory, you will be able to fill the house
with tropical flowers such as orchids, frangipani and bougainvillaea. If
your conservatory temperature fluctuates, you will want to take account
of the amount of sun and available warmth when deciding which plants to
grow. It is possible to have lots of colour in even a cool, north-facing
conservatory. Many brilliantly coloured plants, including geraniums and
pelargoniums, are not fussy about aspect.
A scheme based on cool blues and lilacs, together with grey and
blue-grey leaves and a touch of white would look good in a south-facing
conservatory in summer. Yellow variegated leaves and yellow, cream and
orange flowers will lighten the morning in a conservatory which faces
west, and won't be too dazzling in the afternoon if the conservatory
shading is in place.
For homeowners who live in listed buildings, or within conservation
areas, a conservatory could be the only way to create additional living
space. But the beauty and flexibility of conservatories make them the
extension of choice for many homeowners who are free to choose the
construction and style when adding an extra room to their homes.
Several well established and reputable companies specialise in the
design and construction of conservatories, and will provide informative
brochures and free design and estimating services on request.
If you feel inspired to create a new atmosphere in your home, consider
the pleasure which light can bring, and call in the specialists to
outline the options. Comfort can be assured in conservatories built with
traditional style and elegance thanks to automatic window openers and
shades, double glazing, and hi-tech thermostats which control the
heating system. Any room in the home can be enhanced by letting in much
more light, and reputable double glazing firms can advise on the size
and siting of new windows, and on planning requirements.

ROOMS filled with light provide an opportunity to decorate in a
variety of new ways. From the Carribean to the Mediterranean, abundant
light and the proximity of the sea seem to encourage common design
characteristics; colours are intense, the division between inside and
outside is blurred and one of the main priorities is keeping cool.
This is essentially a simple, native style characterised by endless
white surfaces set off with splashes of coral pink, turquoise, sky blue,
yellow and palm leaf green.
In our northern climate, you can enhance, rather than discourage
warmth by choosing a shade of white which has a hint of pink or yellow
in it, or by using lots of warm accent colours rather than the chillier
blues and greens.
In order to take advantage of every light breeze, tropical houses are
often open plan, so these ideas adapt well to modern homes in cooler
climates which have a similar layout, provide you choose top quality
double glazing, take care of insulation and ventilation, and have an
efficient heating system.
To create the tropical look, which adapts itself perfectly to rooms on
the edge of the garden, keep walls plain or line them with timber fixed
horizontally. Go for white, with woodwork in a vivid contrast such as
red or blue, or try an even bolder scheme with pale pink walls edged
with sea-green skirtings.
For both dining rooms and bedrooms, choose crisp fabrics and painted
wicker chairs. Tiles, glazed or unglazed, are an important design
element, so be generous with their use in the bathroom and kitchen.
For authenticity, the floor should be a cold, hard surface such as
marble, stone or ceramic tile. Unless you have underfloor central
heating, for which these materials are ideal, it is likely that you will
want a more comfortable surface, so settle for timber floorboards
painted white or given a scrubbed, weathered look, or choose a vinyl if
you want a relatively warm, practical and hard-wearing solution.
Shutters in a simple fretwork or lattice pattern are common in sunny
countries, or choose some with a very open design to let in light, while
ensuring privacy in the daytime and early evening. At night, try a plain
roller blind in the same colour as the walls, or hang lightweight
unbleached cotton or linen curtains, leaving them unhemmed and draped
for a relaxed, gauzy effect.
Rooms should be sparsely furnished with large, sturdy pieces in dark
or painted wood, rather than highly polished, ornate or grand ones. A
trawl of the second-hand shops should provide some suitable chests and
wardrobes which can be painted white or a suitably florid colour, and
new whitewood furniture is also ideal. Choose simple, low seating with
generous proportions and stick to crisp, natural upholstery fabrics that
can be washed.

SIGNOR Caruso at 311/313 Hope Street is the aptly named Italian
restaurant and pizzeria directly across the road from the Theatre Royal
-- home of Scottish Opera. As every keen opera buff knows Enrico Caruso
was born in Naples in 1873 and died there in 1921 aged 48 after becoming
the most famous tenor of his time.
Under the same management as the well-known La Fiorentina on the South
Side and Vecchia Romagna in Newton Mearns, Signor Caruso is in the
capable hands of director Walter Arrighi who has many years of
experience in the catering trade here and in Italy.
Appropriately enough the restaurant's logo is taken from a line
drawing by the great Caruso himself who is celebrated with his very own
dish Pizza Caruso. At #4.95 it is a tempting mix of tomatoes, mozzarella
cheese, spicy Italian sausage, mushrooms, herbs and onions. For the
cuisine-conscious the house pizza topping is made with crushed tomato,
oregano, basil, salt, pepper and a hint of garlic.
The interior of Signor Caruso is open-plan with ceiling beams curved
archways, whirling fans, cartwheel lights, greenery in troughs and pots,
and even a tree in the centre of the restaurant. Rustic, traditional
furniture has been imported from Northern Italy, burgundy tablecloths,
napkins and a tiled floor add an authentic touch.
Italian music, operatic and popular, plays quietly in the background
and service is friendly and informed. Conveniently situated for
Cowcaddens subway, public transport and with a high-rise parking lot
nearby, Senior Caruso makes an ideal lunching spot in the centre of the
city -- a boon for the business community.
The #5.95 business lunch menu from 12 noon until 2.15pm (last orders)
is a bargain. Home-made minestrone, funghi fritti or deep-fried
mushrooms served with garlic mayonnaise and cozze marinara or mussels in
garlic and white wine can be found among the starters.
There are 16 antipasti including a filling peasant dish Salsiccia Con
Fagioli all'ucelleto of Italian sausage and Borlotti beans in a sauce
made from fresh herbs, served hot for #3.45 a Mediterranean vegetarian
platter of roasted obergines artichokes, dried tomatoes, peppers and
mushrooms served with garlic bread for #4.25 and an abundant seafood
salad of squid, prawns, scallops and mussels in a marinade of lemon
juice, garlic, white wine parsley and freshly ground peppercorns
garnished with fresh vegetables for #4.55.
Among the half-dozen soups is another filling country bowl of onions,
garlic, rosemary, potatoes, pasta, basil and Borlotti beans which is
almost a meal in itself for #1.95. Monkfish is a popular special but on
my visit sea bass al cartoccio with white wine and fresh herbs baked in
foil had pride of place on the daily changing blackboard menu at #12.50.
Italy is surrounded on three sides by the sea after all.
Ravioli di Carne con ragu is a full plateful of fresh pasta with lean
minced beef and pork (pancetta cured Italian bacon), chicken liver,
minced spicy Italian sausage and tomato puree served in a sauce made
with olive oil, onion, garlic, carrots and celery for #5.75. There are
more than pizzas straight from the oven as well as veal dishes, risottos
and the whole Italian cornucopia. Head chef Fausto Mascia is a master
and Signor Caruso's espresso coffee is highly recommended.
The painstakingly compiled Italian wine list is inexpensive in
restaurant terms starting at #7.95 for a soft and fruity house Merlot
and bargain bottles such as the full-bodied Domini Veneti, 1988, Amarone
della Valpolicella at #13.75 and the crisply dry straw-coloured
Verdicchio Fanta Lucia at #9.95 abound.
Main courses include scaloppine di maile al Pepe or escalope of pork
in a peppercorn sauce served with pasta and polo cacciatore or chicken
pieces in a tomato, mushroom and onion sauce. All the main courses are
served with a selection of vegetables and potatoes except pasta and
pizza dishes. Coffee is included in the cost.
The #7.95 pre and post theatre menu from 5pm until 10.45pm (last
orders) is more extensive and as at lunchtime, there are dishes for
vegetarians. Pasta al forno tricolore, for example, is short pasta
tossed in a sauce made with olive oil, onion, carrots, petit pois,
garlic, red and green pepprs, bechamel sauce, nutmeg and mozzarella
cheese baked in the oven.
On my evening visit I was able to sample the Focaccia or pizza bread
seasoned with sea salt and olive oil, #1.25, and the Italian sausage
with Borlotti beans, #3.45 as a hot starter. The moist tasty bread
mopped up the fresh herb sauce agreeably and the tangy sausage whetted
the appetite for the Bistecca alla pizzaiola, #9.45 to come. The sirloin
steak was medium rare as requested and with grilled green and red
peppers and sauted potatoes was an impressive plateful.Open six days but
closed Sundays, Signor Caruso is a welcome addition to the Glasgow
eating-out scene.

LABOUR'S shadow agriculture minister, Dr Gavin Strang, has called for
clear government advice to be issued on pesticide levels in carrots.
His call came after a warning yesterday against eating unpeeled
carrots because potentially dangerous pesticide residues could be left
on the skins.
Ministry of Agriculture scientists said that carrots should be peeled,
topped and tailed in order to avoid organo-phosphates which were sprayed
on the crops to protect them from carrot fly.
Dr Strang said yesterday that the Advisory Committee on Pesticides had
warned the Government in January that pesticide levels in carrots would
have to be reduced. ''Yet it is only now that the Government is warning
the public that unpeeled carrots could be dangerous,'' he said.
''We need clear guidance and advice from the Government to prevent
food risk and unnecessary alarm.''
Dr Strang said that in order to seek assurances for public safety his
colleagues on the House of Commons Agriculture Select Committee would be
questioning the Pesticides Safety Directorate on this issue during a
visit to the directorate in York today.
Earlier this year the Government issued regulations restricting the
number of applications of organo-phosphate insecticides to three a year.
The wash-and-peel warning applies to all carrots on sale in the UK.
Food Minister Angela Browning said that regular monitoring of carrot
samples, taken in accordance with international standards, had shown
that residues were generally below the permitted maximum levels.
Recent research, however, had shown that residue levels could vary
greatly between individual carrots, even from the same row.
''This can lead to a reduction in the safety margins normally
considered desirable by the Advisory Committee on Pesticides,'' said the
minister.
Organo-phosphates can cause stomach ache and sickness but a Department
of Health spokesman said that there was no need for alarm. The warning
only applied to carrots and other vegetables were not affected.
''We have always advocated eating plenty of fruit and vegetables but
if they are eaten raw they should always be washed anyway,'' he said.
The leading supermarket chains have indicated their support for clear
advice to be given to farmers on crop spraying.
Marks &amp; Spencer said that its carrots were routinely analysed for
pesticide residue and over the last five years maximum levels had not
been exceeded. All carrots used in prepared products had been topped and
peeled.
Charles Russell, field vegetables convener of the National Farmers'
Union of Scotland, said that about 1200 hectares of carrots were grown
in Scotland mostly in Fife, Grampian and Tayside.
Farmers had been made aware of the regulations introduced earlier this
year on the number of pesticide applications which could be made. A
significant part of the Scottish output was sold as baby carrots or as
sliced or diced carrot, he said. They were washed and peeled as they
went through the processing and freezing operation.

JUST days before an expected rise in UK interest rates further
evidence has emerged of the lacklustre state of the UK housing market.
House prices have fallen for the second successive month, according to
figures published by the Halifax Building Society, the nation's largest
mortgage provider.
Prices fell by 0.3% last month after seasonal adjustment to an average
of #62,300. This followed a similar fall of 0.3% (revised up from 0.2%)
in March. In the 12 months to April prices fell by 1.4%, compared with a
drop of 1.5% in the year to March.
The Halifax said: ''This further fall in prices in April confirms that
there is still no evidence of any recovery in the housing market.''
Prices of new houses fell by 0.8% last month to an average of #68,569
and are 0.2% higher than a year ago, down on the 1.8% gain in the year
to March.
The first-time buyers' market is slightly more buoyant. Prices paid by
this category of buyer rose by 0.7% in April to #46,361 and have risen
by 0.1% in the latest 12 months.
Mortgage lenders have been targeting first-time buyers with special
offers. Because of the weakness of the market home loan rates were not
increased after bank base rates rose by 0.5% to 6.75% in February.
But it is difficult to see how lenders could absorb another rate hike.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England
are expected to agree on a half-point increase in rates when they meet
on Friday.
Mortgage lending by the banking sector fell in March, according to
figures from the British Bankers' Association. Net lending,
seasonally-adjusted, fell from #608m in February to #560m in March, but
gross lending advanced from #1110m to #1451m. In March last year net
lending was #674m and gross lending #1614m.

RETAILING is a tough game these days with intense competition across
all product categories as Body Shop is finding out.
It warned yesterday that profits in the current year would be little
changed on last year's #33.5m before tax, an increase of 17% on an
underlying basis. This is largely because extra resources are to be
spent on marketing and product development but sales are also under
pressure as consumer confidence remains fragile.
The City took fright at the news and the shares dropped 23[1/2]p to
152[1/2]p.
However worthy the cause and attractive the product no-one can afford
to sit back and expect shoppers to pour in through the doors and spend
lots of money. Body Shop itself admits that it has taken its eye off the
ball in some respects, especially in the US, but remedial action is
being taken to provide a sound basis on which to move forward in the
future.
This is certainly needed because in the UK the market is close to
saturation and in the US awareness of Body Shop as something other than
a gift shop is limited despite the fact that it now has the biggest
number of stores of any country.
US sales slipped by 3% last year although overall group sales were 16%
ahead at #500.1m. The UK remained its biggest market accounting for 43%
of transactions. UK sales grew by 4% helped by strong demand for its new
Tea Tree Oil range for problem and blemished skin. Earnings per share
rose by 12% to 11.5p and there is a proposal to increase the final
dividend by 20% to #1.5p.
Operating costs are expected to rise by #13m in the current year, #8m
of which is earmarked for marketing. A more focused marketing approach
is being adopted with the help of a new advertising agency Chiat Day.
Body Shop has always eschewed traditional means of advertising which
is just as well because as chief executive Anita Roddick says, unlike
other cosmetic companies, Body Shop is not in the business of saying
''buy this and you'll look 20 years younger''.
In the past the company has relied upon communicating with its
customers through the stores. This will continue but will be beefed up.
A 24-hour-a-day in-store Body Shop radio station is being launched in
the summer which will be available via the Astra satellite across
Europe. Use is also to be made of CD-ROM and the Internet for marketing
purposes.
The home shopping service which was trialed in a few areas last year
is being rolled out nationwide. This is attracting older customers into
the stores. Around threequarters of the products being purchased through
the home shopping service are new to the customers which enables Body
Shop to build up newer and less popular lines.
The stores, frankly, are starting to look tired but this is being
addressed with new signage, fascias and product labelling all being
introduced in the stores although the famous black on green motif is
remaining. New products are being rolled out including ranges for older
people and ethnic minorities.
Around 150 new shops will be opened in the current year, a similar
number to last year, with only a handful in the UK. Boots, supermarket
groups such as Sainsbury and more recently Bath &amp; Body Works from the US
are all providing ''natural'' cosmetics. What distinguishes Body Shop
from the competition is its ''strong lasting relationship with
customers,'' says founder and chief executive Anita Roddick.
The City has always had a problem getting to grips with what Body Shop
is about and focused entirely on the financial aspects of the business.
It may be that Body Shop would be better off reverting back to a private
company rather than trying to convince a sceptical financial community
of the intrinsic value of its ''profits with principles'' approach.

THIS year's currency turmoil is holding back Aberdeen Trust's European
Index Investment Trust, which yesterday announced a 3% fall in net asset
value to 88.5p, excluding distributable reserves, in the year to
end-February.
The fund management group has certainly realised its objective of
putting together a #30m portfolio of leading Continental shares which
mirrors the composition of the FTSE-Eurotrack 100 index -- which also
fell 3% over the 12 months.
Abtrust European Index raised its single payout from 0.8p to 1.0p,
with net revenue after taxation having risen 33% to #316,698. The
increase in revenue resulted from steady growth in dividend income from
portfolio companies and a reduction in operating expenses.
The economic fundamentals for a recovery in European bourses, such as
low inflation, would appear to be in place.
Trust chairman Sir David Thomson pointed out that last year was one of
faster-than-expected recovery in European economies, with companies
returning to profitability. Overall, corporate results were ahead of
expectations.
However, against the backdrop of rising US interest rates, equities
did not benefit from the general economic recovery.
More recently, the US dollar has plummeted against the German mark.
Rate rises have been necessary to keep peripheral European currencies
within their Exchange Rate Mechanism bands.
Looking ahead, Sir David said: ''Once currency turmoil abates, the
region's exchanges may better reflect the present pick-up in economic
and corporate activity.''
German stocks make up 23% of the portfolio, with 19% invested in
France, 15% in Switzerland and 13% in the Netherlands. The other
principal markets covered are Italy, accounting for 8% of the fund, and
Sweden and Spain, each with a 5% share.

THE increase in the number of car auctions held in Scotland in recent
years has paralleled the upsurge in car ownership.
As manufacturers increase production capacity in a bid to hold down
costs, pressure is put on the trade to sell more new cars -- and
consumers to buy them.
This in turn has created a huge pool of used cars which also have to
find a place in the scheme of things.
Many of these vehicles are only a few months old. Others have been
around a little longer, but pretty well all of them are still in
excellent order and some even carry either the remnants of the
manufacturer's warranty, or are the subject of an extended guarantee.
Just a few years ago these vehicles would have been retained by main
dealers as part of their important used car inventory.
But with pressure on space and the need to constantly ''freshen up''
stocks, the main dealer is unlikely to keep anything on his books for
more than a month or two if it doesn't look like selling.
So, no matter how good a buy the car may be, it is moved on.
This can mean it being sold to a used car specialist, another main
dealer or -- as happens more often -- to an auction.
Using an auction as a means of disposing of surplus stock has obvious
attractions. The sale is made quickly and at little cost to the owner,
in this case the main dealer, who simply pays an entry fee and a small
proportion of the sum realised.
This in turn frees capital which can be used in a variety of ways,
from paying for ''trade ins'' from customers buying new, or even topping
up the stock of used cars that have been depleted by auctioning off the
''sticky'' models.
In other words the car auction has a vital role to play in helping to
keep the motor trade ticking over briskly.
So what happens to the cars entered for an auction, and who buys them?
Most go back into the motor trade to be marketed by both large and small
used car outlets. Others are bought privately by motorists who want to
be able to secure a good used car at the lowest possible price.
Some drivers, in fact, attend car auctions almost as regularly as
trade figures, either to keep abreast of the prices being asked, or to
be on hand whenever that interesting or rare machine pops up on the
list.
And they do, albeit on a fairly irregular basis. Recent pieces of
exotica entered at ''regular'' as opposed to classic car auctions, have
included an NSU RO80, together with with more humble but still
interesting cars such as a Borgward Isabella and Skoda Octavia.
No, they don't come up very often, but part of the fun of the car
auction is that there is usually something to suit the collector, the
restorer, the motoring historian, or just trade and private buyers
wishing to cast an eye over as wide a pool of cars as possible.

CARS have been auctioned at Graham Square, just off the Gallowgate
near Glasgow Cross, for almost as long as they have been built.
But the Graham Square auction actually preceded the motor vehicle,
having been established ''way back when the only mode of wheeled
transport was harnessed behind a horse''.
So perhaps the fact that one firm of city auctioneers, Central Car
Auctions, celebrates its 30th birthday this year shouldn't come as too
much of a surprise.
But in the car trade it is certainly unique. No other motor auctioneer
in the city has managed to last quite as long.
Central Car Auctions can not only claim to being the longest lived of
the independents, but the only one to have retained ownership in the
same family since its formation.
At the helm nowadays is Jonathan Miller, who has been wielding the
gavel since 1967, after leaving school at the age of 15.
He followed his father John into the business. Mr Miller Snr started
by selling furniture, progressed to cars (trading under a different
name), before setting up the present firm in 1965.
At that time Graham Square housed four auction companies who between
them handled most of Scotland's motor vehicle business.
In recent years the number of companies involved in Glasgow and
throughout Strathclyde Region has mushroomed and auctions are held at a
variety of locations, but the Wednesday afternoon and Friday evening
sales in Glasgow still pull in the largest attendances.
Jonathan Miller has been in sole charge since the company re-emerged
from an amalgamation with Alex Beith Limited when that company was taken
over by a national company.
''There were some in the trade who were convinced that we couldn't
survive as independents, but we were equally determined that we would
and could,'' said Mr Miller.
''We knew the business, knew our customers and as a family run company
based in Glasgow and here every day, had our ears to the ground.
''Operating on a smaller scale -- but not necessarily with regard to
our throughput -- we could capitalise on our strengths as a local
concern with a good working relationship with customers and motor trade
figures. This is something we feel is vitally important.''
The business handled by Central Car Auctions is roughly split 80-20 in
favour of motor trade custom, but private buyers remain an important
part of the picture.
With around 400 cars per week coming under the hammer, there is
constant pressure to move stock in and out. Hence the arrival on the
scene of the third generation of the family.
Jason Miller has been an auctioneer for a year and, like his father,
sees the first 30 years of the company's existence as being simply the
start of something that will run for generations to come.
Getting the cars to auction is almost a full-time job in itself.
Almost all of the vehicles, the majority of which come from fleet
disposals and main dealers, have to be collected by Central Auctions
personnel.
This can involve anything up to 10 drivers and an extensive use of car
transporters to uplift around 200 cars each week -- and distance really
is no object.
Jonathan Miller has even collected cars on behalf of a customer from
the island of Barra, an exercise which he cheerfully concedes was
''hardly profitable, but necessary''.
Naturally most sales are still dominated by the volume marques, such
as Ford, Vauxhall and Rover, whose products are always in big demand,
but Mr Miller says firm prices can be obtained for Japanese products
from manufacturers such as Toyota and Honda.
''Buying a car at auction nowadays is not a risky process if you take
a little time to look at the market,'' said Mr Miller.
''Cars themselves are better built, last very much longer and are less
prone to mechanical failure.
''We also encourage people who may be interested in a specific vehicle
to come and ask us about it before the sale. If we have driven the car
in there is probably quite a lot we can tell him about it.
''Whereas people once came in and just made a bid, they are much more
inclined to dig a little deeper now. This, and the fact that guarantees
are more generous, has added to customer confidence.
''If we sell 250 cars per week, it is probably fair to say that just a
single example will be returned to us as unsatisfactory.
This is where car auctions have improved greatly over the years.''
It is a fast moving, atmospheric, hectic business that always seems to
be up against the clock. But the challenge of acquiring an attractive
stock in the face of stiff competition and realising a good sale price
for the vendor is enough to keep the adrenalin coursing.
It also, in its own way, makes all the difference between success or
failure for those motor traders who rely on auctions to keep stocks on
the move.

WE asked SCOTFI to prepare an easy guide to building your own home,
taking into account all of the factors involved.
The guide starts off with advice on how to select a location and site
or plot and follows up with information on the legal aspects, including
the role played by lawyer, surveyor, architect and engineer, before
going into the house specification, costs and planning permission.
Choice of location is all important. You will have to decide where you
want to live and set about finding a suitable plot. These can be
advertised in the local press, by estate agents or solicitors. Others
with their ear to the ground can include local builders, timber frame
companies, farmers and landowners.
Having located a plot, prepare some more information. Check the cost
of the land, the access, siting, and the availability of services and
planning. Then add everything up and ask if you can afford to build on
this site and whether it meets your personal requirements.
Legal questions come next and here you will need professional advice.
Your lawyer will carry out a land search to determine whether the site
can legally be sold and advise on whatever legal rights others may have
regarding it. He/she will also help with the purchase, drawing up and
exchanging contracts.
You will also need a valuation survey on which to base your offer,
together with a land conditions survey. The latter will be undertaken by
a civil or structural engineer to ascertain whether or not the ground is
suitable for building on.
Assuming all is well, you can now progress to the building stage, but
again professional advice must be sought. An architect is the key figure
here. If you want a builder to do all of the work, opt for one
registered with the NHBC. With timber frame building, the manufacturer
of the kit will be able to offer a complete design and build package or
simply supply you with the kit when and where you want it and leave the
construction to you.
Once the plot has been found, funding put in place, a specification
and design agreed, you can apply for planning permission.
The result will be a high value property built at a reasonable price
-- and the price reduces in proportion to how much of the physical work
you can accomplish yourself.

HOUSEBUILDING patterns in Scotland have changed markedly since the
boom days of the 1970s.
Where once the 200 to 500-home development was fairly commonplace, and
would-be buyers were having to form queues just to be accepted on
waiting lists, the building industry has done an about-face. Difficult
economic times, a shortage of suitable land, green belts being fiercely
protected and rising costs have all had a part to play.
The multi-unit developments have all but gone. Builders nowadays are
more inclined to take parcels of whatever land is on offer rather than
gamble on the whole, and homebuyers in turn are travelling around in an
effort to find the most house for the least amount of capital.
But one sector of the market, self building, just keeps on growing.
According to SCOTFI, the Scottish Consortium of Timber Frame Industries,
while the overall picture of the trade is still ''patchy'', the position
with regard to timber frame remains stronger. This method of
construction is currently being utilised in 50% of all new build houses
in Scotland and a staggering 90% of self build homes.
For the latter group the advantages are obvious. Timber framing is
less costly, quicker to construct and easier to heat than comparative
masonry constructed houses.
The self-builder is almost invariably working within a clearly defined
budget and a pressing timescale. To stay on course the priority is to
get the new home wind and watertight as rapidly as possible, allowing
work to progress inside when weather conditions outside render the
cement mixer temporarily redundant.
Building a home of your own has to rank somewhere pretty near the top
of life's greatest challenges. It is probably true to say that actually
deciding to take the plunge is the most difficult part.
Once work starts there will be snags, frustrations and pitfalls along
the way, but by this time the mind will be well and truly focused.
Imagination cannot be allowed to get in the way when there is digging to
be done or urgent deliveries to be coordinated.
This isn't meant to be off putting. Quite the reverse in fact, because
the failure rate is very low. How many half-built houses do you see
dotted around the countryside? Precious few, simply because the vast
majority of people, no matter their day to day occupation, can cope very
well.
The few jobs which demand skilled attention can be contracted out to
professionals, but the bulk of the work can be tackled by anyone who is
reasonably fit and enthusiastic.
There are many rewards along the way -- the tremendous elation as each
key step is successfully completed and the satisfaction to be gained
from saying ''we built it''. Deciding just what type of home to build
depends on a combination of factors, cost being the most important.
Many self builders have existing homes to sell and will plan to build
a new one, hopefully of a higher standard, but cheaply enough to sharply
reduce or even eliminate borrowings altogether. Taking a huge slice out
of your existing mortgage is one way of finding out about the feel good
factor.
Most of the house kit suppliers in Scotland are members of SCOTFI and
from their brochures the self builder can find houses of every size and
style, from the modest to the positively palatial.
Whether the plan is to erect a small, no-frills town house or
something larger in the countryside, there is something to suit all
tastes and pockets. What they have in common is good quality materials,
comprehensive building instructions, plenty of back-up advice and the
promise that the completed house will cost a lot less than a similar
home on a large development.
Perhaps best of all, yours will probably be the only one of its type
in the neighbourhood, which will do wonders for its resale value should
you ever wish to repeat the exercise -- and many people do. Home
building can be habit forming.

A MAJOR new force in the car insurance market will be officially
launched within the next three weeks with Kwik-Fit beginning to sell
policies for 15 insurance companies.
A #5m marketing campaign will target the owners of four million cars
that pass through the exhaust and tyre replacement company each year
with the objective of converting one million policyholders or 5% of the
UK market.
The Edinburgh-based company, which started life in Buccleuch Street in
1964, normally would spend about #15m annually on promotion but there
will be a rub-off effect from the new activity.
Nearly 130 people have been recruited for the office at Tannochside
Park in north Lanarkshire which is highly convenient for transport. The
biggest expenditure has been on the building with the overall cost
assisted by various grants.
The economy will receive another boost this morning when Whitbread
unveils its expansion plans as the most dynamic of the drink and food
companies develops the Scottish market.
Kwik-Fit chairman Tom Farmer said yesterday that the Kwik-Fit brand is
one of the strongest in any sector in Britain and this represented an
opportunity to use it in selling insurance. He added he has been very
impressed by the success of the Royal Bank of Scotland's Direct Line
which had created a brand for itself -- it now claims a fifth of the
private motorist sector.
In a counter-attack, he had been approached by other insurers to sell
policies.
The reasoning is that if a customer is confident about buying a tyre
or an exhaust from Kik-Fit, would the same person be as confident about
buying an insurance policy under the same brand name.
Market research has shown that the answer is ''yes, if the price is
right''.
Kwik-Fit itself will carry no risk and receive only a commission from
the participating insurers.
The question of profitability was answered only vaguely apart from it
being likely to be a useful contribution to the group which last year
increased the pre-tax total by 15% to #29.3m. Instead the objective is
to increase customer loyalty.
Part of the problem for car insurers competing against Direct Line has
been that of lack of branding. Many have tried to emulate it through
telephone marketing by are calling themselves GRE Direct, Royal Direct
or General Accident Direct or some such name. But the Midland Bank has a
very successful and high-profile banking subsidiary called First Direct
and so is the customer buying car insurance or banking financial
services?
The Kwik-Fit concept is that a customer will take an interest in the
Kwik-Fit insurance policy, contact a freephone number and be able to
deal on the spot using a credit card for immediate cover rather than
having to complete the formalities of a bank direct debit.
Mr Farmer said that customers would become members of a Kwik-Fit club
which would not only deal with replacement business and insurance but
also look after those who may have had a windscreen damaged by providing
a replacement vehicle or at least arrange for help.
He was in a particularly ebullient mood yesterday: ''Things are good
just now, we are getting a bigger share of the market.'' It has 30% of
the exhaust market and 20% of the tyre sector.
The Town &amp; Country fleet maintenance business is performing
exceptionally well, targeting the corporate sector with an increase from
80 to 100 vehicles this year. It does all the maintenance for one car
dealer with 47 outlets with dealers overall becoming increasingly sales
organisations requiring much less by way of backshop facilities thanks
to the reliability of the modern car -- Mazda is about to introduce a
five-year or 100,000-mile warranty.
Kwik-Fit is extensively used by both Lex and Cowie as large fleet
operators for tyre and exhaust maintenance with its own ''implants''
operating in their workshops.
Mr Farmer partly explained his personal philosophy.''If born with high
energy, you get up early in the morning.
''I love to shop. I like watching people how they serve customers and
get annoyed when they miss an opportunity to sell.''
His other interests include being a non-executive director of
Airtours, various Scottish business enterprise and community groups and

THE Saatchi brothers have won British Airways' #60m advertising
account away from the agency they founded and which ousted them earlier
this year.
BA said last night that New Saatchi had clinched a 12-month contract
for the worldwide account after a two-month review.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, now called Cordiant, was among three other firms
pitching for the account, a BA spokesman said.
BA announced it would review its account with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi when
Maurice Saatchi was ousted in a boardroom battle in January this year.
His brother Charles had stood down from the board a month earlier.

STERLING lost out to a resurgent German mark yesterday although its
downside remains limited by the prospect of higher UK interest rates
possibly as early as this week.
The pound dropped over 2[1/2] pfennigs at DM2.2241 and was also weaker
against the dollar at $1.6119, a decline of over half-a-cent on its
overnight level. Official reserves data for April showing a rise
compared with a fall in March were ignored.
The dollar benefited from a weaker Japanese yen as analysts speculated
on a breakdown of US/Japan trade talks. Elsewhere, downward pressure
continued to be exerted on the French franc ahead of Sunday's
Presidential election.

MERCHANT banker SG Warburg wrongfooted the City when it revealed after
the stock market closed yesterday that it had received a bid approach
for its investment banking business from Swiss Bank Corporation.
It was speculative takeover activity, largely featuring Warburg, that
had mostly fuelled the UK stock market activity helping the FTSE-100
Share Index to close up 27.8 at 3248.2 despite an indifferent start to
Wall Street.
But the interest in Warburg was supposed to be coming from the broker
Smith Barney operation in the US after an American newpaper reported the
company was considering making a takeover bid.
Smith Barney may indeed be interested in Warburg, which yesterday also
announced it had lost four of its senior equities staff to Morgan
Grenfell, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, but it is Swiss Bank which is
making the running now.
It would mean the merger of the investment banking business of Warburg
with that of Swiss Bank but will not involve an offer by it for the
whole of the SG Warburg Group. Warburg's 75%-owned Mercury Asset
Management operation would not be included.
Swiss Bank's proposals are being evaluated and no further statement
will be forthcoming until this has been completed. Analysts estimate
that the investment banking activities of Warburg could be worth less
than their book value of #800m.
The company's return to the spotlight is not surprising, it has been
in and out of it ever since its failure in December to merge with Morgan
Stanley, the major US investment bank. That debacle and the resultant
crisis of confidence at the bank resulted in the departure of the then
chief executive Lord Cairns, the main architect of the failed plan. The
dropping of the proposed merger left Warburg in limbo and initially the
shares paid the price.
There have, of course, been recurring rumours of other suitors which
have come to nothing but boosted the share price from 705p a month ago
to 821p yesterday, up 46p on the day on the Smith Barney speculation.
Mercury Asset Management, which is being advised by Lazards on the
Swiss Bank approach, had soared 68p to 861p. It was the management of
Mercury Asset Management that effectively scuppered the Morgan Stanley
merger. But given the uncertainties and problems facing Warburg, they
could be expected to back any reasonable plan which would stabilise the
situation though clearly Swiss Bank sees no role for them in its
interest in Warburg.
Restructuring has been top of the agenda for Warburg since its failed
merger and has included the sale of its leasing subsidiary for #71m. It
also recently laid off a quarter of the staff working in its domestic
equities operation in New York. This followed cuts of 90 jobs in
derivatives and senior management changes in the US.
While Warburg is among the most exclusive of the leading UK investment
banks, with a large stable of blue-chip clients, there is no doubt that
its credibility has been dented and the spate of rumour and counter
rumour has not helped this.
At least something concrete has now emerged, albeit there is no
guarantee that a deal can be struck and possibly other interested
parties could be coaxed into showing their hands if, indeed, there are
other seriously interested potential bidders.
The market also focused yesterday on GEC, British Aerospace and VSEL.
A decision on whether GEC and BAe should be allowed to go-ahead with
their bids for the warship and submarine manufacturer is expected
shortly.
If the DTI gives the green light to BAe but not GEC, which some
analysts consider a possibility given that GEC already owns the
competing Yarrow shipyard at Clydeside, then there have been suggestions
that GEC, with its enormous cash pile, might go for BAe itself once its
voluntary bid moratorium expires next month.
A more likely outcome, though, is that GEC will also get the go-ahead
but will be expected to give undertakings to preserve competition
between the two yards if its bid is cleared.

FRIDAY morning will not be comfortable for the Tories in England and
Wales. The opinion polls are predicting a disaster of Krakatoa
proportions, and although it would be unwise to accept their conclusions
uncritically, something fairly disastrous appears likely. (Incidentally,
and as yet another illustration of the dangers of accepting conventional
wisdom, Krakatoa is west of Java, not east, and is spelled Krakatau.) To
return to the Tories, north, south, east, and west of London, the
crucial question they will have to face on Friday morning is how the
election results can be massaged to put a half-decent face on matters.
If they are truly terrible, and the prediction of seat losses continues
to advance from 1000 to 1500 and now perhaps to 2000, there is every
likelihood that little can be done. If they are not quite as bad as
expected, and the definition of that quavering line in the sand is
difficult to make, then a patchwork defence of some sort can be
attempted. Nevertheless, the persistence of suggestions that nearly half
of the 4100 seats currently held by the Tories could be lost is a
sobering thought for the most ardent Conservative zealot. Another
statistic is of significance: the Tories are not up against just Labour,
as they face a stiff fight in several areas with the Liberal Democrats.
If Mr Ashdown's party manages to push the Tories into third place in
English local government the humiliation could be complete.
A really bad result will inevitably lead to speculation about the
position of the Prime Minister. A significant proportion of discontented
Tories cite Mr Major as the principal source of their problems with the
party. The suggestion that Tory divisions were the main reason for
discontent never rang true and was more a product of what party leaders
wanted to hear rather than a genuine explanation. Mr Major, who has
often appeared to have a paper-thin skin to criticism, cannot be unaware
of the dangers inherent in the current situation. His touch, both within
the party and externally, is uncertain and growing more so. Yet the
Prime Minister has dogged qualities and anyone who expects him
voluntarily to resign as leader will be confounded. The Cabinet will not
force him as it is divided on ideology and by the varying pulls of
individual ambition. Nor will the back benchers in the 1922 Committee
contemplate a move, at least not until the autumn, when members with
fragile majorities will have had a lengthy summer to appreciate the real
depth of their predicament.
For the Conservative Party, as distinct from the Prime Minister, the
problem is equally profound. The factors which have brought it to such a
pitch of voter disapproval appear impervious to attempts at political
manipulation. The export-led economy may be improving but few feel the
benefit and it is clear that many do not believe the predictions of jam
tomorrow. The housing market lies nose down in the gutter and will not
be tempted to rise if yet another interest rate hike materialises, as is
only too likely, within the next few days. The Tory heartlands are also
in bad shape. Of particular relevance to both the local government
elections and the forthcoming General Election is the bitterness
engendered by the high level of long-term unemployment in those parts of
England which have come to be regarded as distinctively Tory. No longer,
perhaps. Family life, that mainstay of decent conservatism usurped by
the cynical neo-brutalists of recent years, will also feel the effects.
There is little that the Tories can do about all this. If a change of
leadership is felt to be a feasible option by some, the last point at
which this could reasonably be attempted before the next General
Election is during the coming autumn. Tories fear that another
leadership change would be regarded with the utmost cynicism by the
electorate, but this is not wholly true. The departure of Mrs Thatcher
did not bring Conservative government to an end and the number of areas
in which the voters might be cynical about Tory actions, including the
NHS, tax, law and order, and a host of other limping policies, far
outweighs concern over what is essentially an internal affair. Derision,
to be perfectly honest, is a more likely reaction in the streets. Tories
would not do better electorally under any other candidate. Many may not
like Mr Major but they would be wise for their own sakes to learn to
tolerate him.

IT WAS good to read of the cycling experiences of your readers. As a
bairn born on a bike, may I add an anecdote or two in further
illustration of the advantages and dangers of this form of transport?
Renfield Street in Glasgow was as busy over half a century ago as it
is today. To add to two-way traffic, there were horses and carts, buses,
taxis, cars, vans, lorries, yes, and even steam lorries belching
blinding smoke so that you could see nothing else.
Last, but not least, trams galore. You had to learn to turn across the
tramlines and not to pedal into them.
Ever since an experience as a nine-year-old I have been resigned to
dying on my bicycle, but at least happily in the knowledge that I would
not be causing anyone else's demise at the bumpers of a mechanically
propelled jalopy.
Visiting Holland recently I noted that every native motorist gave
respect and priority to drivers of the two-wheeled and superior form of
transport, and the authorities had provided cycle lanes almost
everywhere.
Thame, 15 miles from Oxford, I negotiated a couple of years ago. Cars
passed my bike every two seconds or so. But the time I reached the
outskirts of Oxford they were at a standstill and I overtook the lot,
mile after mile. On the way, they had passed an ignored a free
Park-and-Ride facility. The same would have been true of any city.
Roadway education should begin with the bike and then continue with
it. Safety, maintenance, and proficiency, should be a compulsory subject
at school and beyond, with A-levels and honours degrees. It is much more
logical to cycle, and the benefits are more than ''cycle-logical''.
Finally, a mayor of and English town was reprimanded by his council
for cycling to the town hall. The dignity of his office demanded that he
should arrive in the limousine provided.
But he was always on time. He did not pollute the air of the town, did
not exacerbate its parking problems. He was the only one with any sense.

AS an exiled Scot in the US and a frequent user of the bus system from
Paisley to Glasgow until I left Scotland in 1993, I found that by far
the best service was provided by Strathclyde Transport on both rail and
bus.
I am saddened that the city fathers did not see the sense of
maintaining a viable and safe bus system. Some of the new bus lines I
ventured on after deregulation were a deathtrap, to say the least. The
pollution and disruption of Hope Street and Paisley Central Way is, I
understand, a sight to be seen.
By contrast the system in San Francisco has a flat-rate charge of $1
allowing the user three journeys of any length in two hours. The buses
are clean, regular (every five minutes), have facilities for the elderly
and disabled riders, and all in San Francisco use the facility, some by
choice, others through tax exemptions to encourage bus utilisation.
Perhaps common sense will return and a system will evolve that
encourages bus not car.

AS responsible citizens my wife and I spent time composing a critique
on the Frameworks for the Future document. This task was completed with
a number of unqualified comments which could interest your readers.
Why, for example, was there no discussion of the concepts of
proportionality and pluralism or the influence of religious institutions
for good or bad here in Irelandin the document?
Why was there no mention of the future form and function of local
councils or the possible restoration of a separate Parliamentary
Ombudsman in provincial affairs?
Why does the summary statement of the Framework document display some
important omissions, either by accident or design?
Why do the contents of the Framework document reflect a desire to deny
normal democratic procedures and arrangements for ends predetermined by
those who wish to impose their wills improperly?
The bad faith, terrorism, and subversion that have been thrust upon
innocent people here prompt a suggestion that those who composed this
document should read and then reflect upon verses one to fifteen of
Psalm 10. People and property have suffered needlessly because of
expediencies and the fallacy of ''inertia selling'' in the political
affairs of this province.
This is not a discussion document since only one side of the case has
been put to the public, in the agreed name of two governments. Instead
of being asked to consider we are repeatedly told what has been agreed
-- in very tortuous language.
As for the paramilitary problem in our midst, may I again remind
people that it is pointless for sheep to pass resolutions on
vegetarianism while the wolf has teeth and remains carnivorous?

BETT Brothers, the Dundee-based home-builders and property developers,
raised its interim dividend to 1.75p from 1.25p last year, confident
that they are on track for steady growth in a difficult market.
But chief executive Ronnie Hanna said there would no windfall profits
from property developments in the financial year ending August 31 to
match the #1.3m earned from the Heathfield shopping centre near Ayr in
early 1994.
''We have several things in the pipeline, but it takes a while for
them to be processed and the they tend to be lumpy when they come,'' Mr
Hanna said.
Projects in hand include an office development and an industrial site
in Glasgow and an extension of the Heathfield shopping centre, for which
planning permission has been applied. But Mr Hanna said none of these
would come to fruition during the current financial year.
Group pre-tax profits eased back to #3.0m in the six months to
February 28 from #3.1m in the first half of last year, when they were
boosted by earnings from the first phase of Heathfield.
But operating profit rose to #3.5m from #3.4m and turnover climbed to
#15.2m from #12.8m previously.
Mr Hanna said Bett Brothers' house-building business had improved its
margins, the company had bought more building land and was planning to
expand its chain of pubs and hotels in the Dundee area.
''I think every market we are in is tough and one has to fight hard
for the business, but I think we are reasonably on target for the
year,'' he said.
The operating profit of Bett Homes rose to #1.7m in the first half
from #1.3m previously and house completions rose to 90 from 84.
Mr Hanna said the company had bought more land in central Scotland and
now held 1300 housing plots, up from 1150 at the end of August.
He also saw room for expanding Bett Brothers' chain of hotels and
pubs, which offer meals to attract families as well as adult drinkers.
Bett Brothers opened its third hotel at Monifieth near Dundee on
Friday and may add two or three more pubs this year to its present chain
of 13.
''We are investing most of our cash in food-related outlets and that
is the established and continuing trend. A higher food content and
attracting families are the things we are aiming for,'' Mr Hanna said.
Bett Brothers paid a total dividend of 4.5p in 1994 after making a
pre-tax profit of #5.9m for the full year on turnover of #30.2m.

THE Oklahoma bomb should certainly move President Clinton and others
who so recently feted Gerry Adams to do some soul-searching. The
President, full of righteous indignation, denounced those responsible
for the outrage. ''They have,'' he said, ''no right to kill innocent
Americans They have no right to violate the law.''
We wholeheartedly agree. But does Mr Clinton apply the same standards
to IRA bombers and terrorists when he welcomes their chief
representative to the White House and treats him as if he were a hero?

PROFITS are growing by leaps and bounds at BSkyB, the satellite
broadcaster 40% owned by Rupert Murdoch's News International group.
They almost doubled to #49m in the group's third quarter to March as
the number of subscribers topped four million.
The nine months' profits total rose from #62.7m to #104m and earnings
per share were 39% up at 6.4p.
Chief executive Sam Chisholm sees the strong trend continuing. He
said: ''The company has strengthened its position in the marketplace and
with strong programming acquisitions we anticipate significant growth
going forward.''
The third quarter reflects the benefit of the seasonal upturn in
satellite dish installations before Christmas. There is usually a high
rate of churn or cancellations once the Christmas period is out of the
way and new dish installations and cable connections are at a low ebb.
But there was a net increase in subscribers of 90,000 in the quarter,
most for satellite broadcasting, as opposed to cable, through which
BSkyB programming is also delivered. Currently 28% of subscribers come
in via cable, though eventually these are expected to outnumber those
via satellite, or direct-to-home subscribers in the jargon.
Over the nine months a net 576,000 new subscribers came on board.
Growth is being fostered by a steady increase in channels. Recent
launches have included Sky Soap and the Learning Channel.
New programming includes a deal with boxing promoter Frank Warren
which will enable viewers to see top names in British boxing including
Frank Bruno, Nigel Benn and Prince Naseem Hamed.
Dish costs have also come down, with a #99 price now available, plus
#30 for installation. BSkyB is mounting a spring advertising campaign
focusing on the extent of the programming available.
The group is working on a digital television service comprising a
mind-boggling 120 channels which could start as early as next year. Some
would be devoted to multiplexing, the showing of the same programmes at
different times and others to staggered film showings. The film would be
available on several channels each showing having a different starting
time.
In the latest nine-month period, revenue from subscribers accounted
for 85% of turnover of #565m, with advertising revenue 12% and the rest
dish installation operations.
BSkyB shares slipped half-a-penny to 259p as the results were in line
with expectations.
A full-year total of some #180m is looked for, nearly double the
comparative figure.

WHILE Labour MP Brian Wilson is understandably euphoric about the
apparent turning of the political tide against the Tories in their
formerly loyal heartlands in the south of England (April 28), he is
surely quite mistaken in his claim that ''the same thing happened
first'' in Scotland.
As it is all of 40 years since the Conservative Party last won a
majority of the Scottish parliamentary seats, the thesis that the
current anti-Government revolt of the English shires was somehow
pioneered in Scotland defies credibility.
Come off it, Brian. The Scots haven't turned against this Government
-- we never elected it in the first place.
The truth is that in Scotland -- unlike England -- Labour has long
been the dominant political party, however much it has lacked power at
Westminster.
The political tide will not turn in Scotland until Labour, as the
party of the Scottish establishment, is rejected at the polls.
As the clear runners-up in the recent Scottish local elections, the
SNP is poised to gain from the inevitable failure of a Blair Government
to resolve the problems of the Scottish economy. In that situation there
will at last be a real window of opportunity to turn the tide in
Scotland's favour.

RUTH WISHART is quite right to pose the ''questions New Labour must
answer'' (May 1). Labour is indeed indulging in rhetorical politics in
its attempt to get elected, and the practical realities of government,
not least in the form of Civil Service advice, mean that it would find
delivering its promises pretty challenging.
The article is devalued, however, by inaccuracy over the future of
water services. As the Government has made clear on numerous occasions
these remain in public ownership beyond the transition to unitary
councils. Thus why would any need arise to restore these services to
public ownership?
This is just one example of how the media distorts the actuality of
government policy. In the event of a change in party in power how long
will it be before journalists turn on it for failing to deliver?

SO Mr Brian Meek (April 27) thinks I did nothing when, as an elected
Residents' Association Councillor, I abstained when voting took place to
decide who would have control of the new East Renfrewshire Council.
It is a great pity that Mr Meek did not seek knowledge of the facts
prior to writing his article which, in essence, is the work of a spoilt
child who did not obtain that which he wished, in this case the
possibility of a Tory-led council. I gave him the blues!
I would point out to Mr Meek that I do not seek his respect, only that
of those in Netherlee and East Renfrewshire. In this respect I have had
much support for my decision from other people, perticularly when it
became known why I had abstained.
Mr Meek should take note that my decision was made after many hours of
thought and consultation with members of my committee and others, unlike
his article which, if given any thought by him, was a waste of time.
I would put on record that I shall continue to do all in my power to
enhance the lives of all in East Renfrewshire. I am confident I can do
so.

Mr Ian Pearce, but Brian Meek's remarks need some response (April 27).
Throughout his tenure as councillor, he has had the full backing of an
elected committee of 20 members who in turn have the support of 90% of
the households who are members of the Residents' Association whom Ian
represents.
To say that Mr Pearce was given ''a free run'' is quite offensive to a
hard-working committee who campaigned for their candidate against an
official Conservative candidate in a past election who was soundly
beaten by the largest majority recorded in Eastwood District elections.
I doubt if Brian Meek and his party hacks in Colinton could boast such
in-depth support as Mr Pearce has enjoyed in the past. His truly
independent stand was not a case of ''sitting on his bum'' but the
result of a decision backed by the residents who elected him. Would that
Mr Meek's glorious leader enjoyed such support!

SARA-KATE Templeton's article (Education Herald, April 25) struck a
chord with me as I am a former Erasmus exchange student in Germany. As
she points out, far greater numbers of students come here from Germany
than vice versa.
The perennial language problem is, indeed, a major factor and I tend
to agree with Dr Watt, of Glasgow University, that this has to be
addressed at school level for there to be any appreciable improvement in
the present situation.
Over the years I have been personally acquainted with many young
Germans who have come over to Scotland as foreign-language assistants in
Scottish secondary schools. Their greatest difficulty, apart from a tiny
minority of dedicated pupils who have chosen to specialise in languages,
has always been how to motivate the vast majority.
Modern-language teachers in Scotland are no strangers to this problem.
It has more to do with the monolingual attitude of our society than
anything else, I fear.
That the new international arrivals hall in Glasgow Airport has signs
only in English speaks volumes. That the majority of hotels,
restaurants, pubs, and visitor attractions in tourist areas continue to
offer information, menus, and price lists without any hint of a
concession to non-native speakers is self-evident.
There are many notable exceptions, such as the Scotch Whisky Heritage
Centre in Edinburgh and Dunvegan Castle in Skye, and there has been a
considerable improvement in the provision of multilingual tourist
literature in the past decade. But it's a slow business and the exchange
of day-to-day spoken language constantly lags behind the provision of
printed information.
The greatest problem seems to be an endemic attitude that modern
languages are somehow difficult and only to be attempted by the
academically gifted. No-one would deny that this is true for those who
want to study language and literature at an advanced level. But the
spoken use of a foreign language at elementary level is still regarded
by many Scots of all ages as some sort of awe-inspiring, specialist
skill only available to a confident minority.
This is manifestly untrue. In my travels in mainland Europe I have
frequently met fellow Scots without any semblance of an academic
background who can make themselves understood reasonably well after a
few months' exposure to a foreign language.
Natural acquisition has taken place by dint of necessity without them
having delved into the complexities of grammar. In other words, the
problem seems to be one of attitude and confidence rather than ability.
Somehow we have to rob the learning of foreign languages of their
mystique and elitism by starting the teaching process at primary-school
level and by increasing awareness at all levels of society that our
survival in the European market-place depends on this more than ever
before.
English alone in simply not good enough, even if only out of basic
courtesy to our fellow Europeans who take the time and trouble to learn
our language. Then perhaps more Scots students will consider a year
abroad in a mainland European country as a relatively unexceptional, but
richly fulfilling, part of their degree studies.

HOWDEN Group, the Glasgow-based engineering company, has sold a small
US air-conditioning subsidiary for #6.9m to concentrate on its
mainstream business of manufacturing fans, writes ROBERT POWELL.
Howden Group said it had sold its Buffalo Air Handling division, based
in Amherst, Virginia, to the Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation, but stressed
that it planned to maintain other interests in the US.
''This is a very small part of our operation in the United States.
''We are primarily in the business of manufacturing fans, which are
part of air conditioners, but we do not want to be involved in air
conditioning itself,'' said Howden's corporate services director Alan
McLachlan.
The Howden Group said it would use the proceeds of the disposal to
reduce borrowing.
The group, whose financial year ended on April 30, had debts of #35m
at the end of October.
Mr McLachlan said no further sell-offs were planned.

DREDGING through the dim mists of past education there emerges a faint
recollection that for every action there is an equal and opposite
reaction. True, this is physics, and hereafter we propose to discuss the
environment, which is undoubtedly biological. To mix the two is probably
scientific heresy, but the context makes it irresistible. Put simply,
everything that is done within the physical environment must have
repercussions. The question is what repercussions and how serious they
may be. To dispose of the massive sea-girt stump of the Brent Spar oil
platform (more properly a storage and tanker-loading facility) is a
considerable undertaking; to dispose of it without any adverse effects
on the environment is impossible. Again the question, what effects and
how serious? Greenpeace protesters who have occupied the stump are
convinced that the repercussions of the proposed method of deep-sea
disposal would be unacceptably serious. The installation contains
radioactive material in addition to heavy metals and oil residues. No
matter how deep it is sunk in the Atlantic, these elements will remain
as pollutants (however you define that word) of the environment.
Greenpeace -- and the growing number of perfectly sensible people who
are disinclined to accept official advice on best feasible solutions to
problems, largely because they appreciate the elasticity of the concepts
embodied in feasibility -- advocates other remedies. A large proportion
of the present installations in the North Sea will be towed ashore and
broken up on land. A significant proportion, like Brent Spar, will be
disposed of by being sunk deep in the sea. Why can't they all be dealt
with ashore? The answer, without mincing words, is cost. It is true that
installations like Brent Spar are so big that they would be difficult to
deal with even in a deep-water berth, but it is not impossible. Even
this problem-laden solution might be preferable to towing the
installation to an Atlantic site and then sinking her, all of this being
accomplished in utter ignorance of whether or not the installation
breaks up on her way down, spilling her noxious contents into shallower,
rather than deeper, water.
The Government has sanctioned Shell's decision to sink the Brent Spar
but the Government is quite likely to be wrong. The decision gives a
precedent which will be seized upon by other operators looking for an
easy way to dispose of redundant hardware. All of this ignores the fact
that both government and oil companies promised that oil installations
would be removed. It also ignores the US Federal Law requirement which
means that every redundant rig in the Gulf of Mexico is removed for
disposal. More information is needed on this issue, and perhaps further
consideration.

Conservation is the specialised subject of the Scottish Natural
Heritage chairman. But, as Gavin Bell reports, it is his diplomacy and
negotiating skills which enable him to make friends and influence people
MAGNUS Magnusson is pleased to report that anybody caught chucking a
supermarket trolley into the Dighty Burn, near Dundee, is likely to be
run out of town.
The wrath of local vigilantes who are determined to preserve the
natural beauty of the burn after having spent considerable time and
energy cleaning it up, is a source of profound satisfaction to Magnusson
as chairman of Scottish Natural Heritage.
It was a small project, undertaken initially by an anglers' club, with
SNH support, but it exemplified Magnusson's efforts to involve local
communities in nurturing the countryside on their doorsteps.
''How can we expect people to care for the environment unless they are
in an environment that's fit to live in?'' he says. ''We are enablers.
We are not people who say this shall be done, thou shalt do this. We are
the enablers for other people to pick up the torch.''
There is no shortage of enthusiasts willing to pick up the SNH torch,
nor of critics who would happily extinguish it. The occasional defensive
tone in Magnusson's remarks is prompted by persistent criticism from
landowners that SNH goes too far in protecting the countryside, and by
conservationists that it does not go far enough.
At the Scottish Landowners' Federation conference in March, SNH
regulations were depicted as a Sword of Damocles hanging over estate
managers struggling to make ends meet; earlier the agency's proposals
for improving public access to the countryside were described by the
right-to-roam lobby as ''a stumble in the right direction''.
For a man caught in such vitriolic crossfire, the SNH chairman is
remarkably sanguine. ''There is bound to be a certain amount of
unpopularity, perhaps resentment, in one or two quarters,'' he admits.
''We get opposition from both sides, which pleases me very much, because
it means we're getting it about right. We are going along the line of
mediation between them, of the practical, the possible, not just the
ideal. We are working towards what we can achieve.''
What SNH has achieved under Magnusson's leadership, by common consent,
is a new spirit of co-operation between ramblers who insist on walking
wherever they choose, and landowners and developers who would like to
shoot them on sight. The process of reconciling fiercely conflicting
demands on the same resources began with a concerted attempt to protect
the Cairngorms, one of Scotland's most spectacular landscapes.
''I was told we would never get these people to talk to each other,''
Magnusson recalls. ''Not only did they talk to each other, they came up
with an immensely impressive set of recommendations. In our access (to
the countryside) forum, we have 12 people sitting together who used to
only shout at each other from the rooftops. So the partnership ideal is
working astonishingly well. There's much more listening and flexibility
than there ever was before.''
This is probably due in large measure to Magnusson's diplomacy and
negotiating skills, which have been recognised by both sides. The
avuncular Icelander is a good listener, as well as a passionate advocate
of conservation, although his other persona as inquisitor of BBC
Television's Mastermind can be disconcerting: one has an uneasy feeling
that he is about to counter criticism with an esoteric question on
twelfth-century Celtic architecture.
Magnusson smiles at the suggestion, but insists he takes his job at
SNH more seriously. Given his resources and responsibilities, the stakes
are high. The agency is responsible for managing 40 National Scenic
Areas (NSAs) and more than 1300 Sites of Special Scientific Interest
(SSSIs), comprising almost one quarter of the land area of Scotland. Its
budget of over #40m is devoted to protecting wildlife and landscape in
projects great and small.
It is concerned, for example, with limiting the numbers of Greenland
white-fronted geese on Islay and Svalbard barnacle geese on the Solway
Firth, and with nurturing the threatened ''sticky catchfly'' plant,
which is clinging gamely to its last toehold in Edinburgh in Holyrood
Park. It is also seeking #10m in Millennium Funds for a #20m ''Paths for
All'' initiative, aimed at providing networks of countryside paths
around urban areas.
A theme running through SNH's strategy is ''integrated management'' --
the concept that an overall vision for Scotland's countryside is
required, and that designating segments of it as protected areas is not
sufficient.
''The Cairngorms is now set for the kind of integrated management for
the whole area which is at the heart of our thinking. You can't have
people applying little policies here, there, and everywhere which are
going to affect policies in other areas. We recognise that designations
can't be the be-all and end-all of conservation. You can't just have
bastions of defence and say this is where the natural heritage shall
flourish, because what happens outside of them is going to have far more
effect on your protected areas than your management of them.
''The upshot is that you can't protect a small area by itself, and you
can't protect a large area without bringing the people who live there
with you. Obviously you can't just clear a place out and say, right,
let's have this as wild land. That's not protecting the natural
heritage, it's making a mausoleum of it.''
After three years in the hot seat of Scottish conservation, Magnusson
pronounces himself pleased, well short of complacency, with SNH
achievements. ''What I have learned is patience. We have to think
long-term. What we start doing now is really not going to have an effect
for 10 years. In the case of regenerating forests, it will be 100 years.
I think sometimes our critics expect only quick results, and if we don't
we are perceived to be failing, or not doing anything.''
Having made a promising start by making friends and influencing people
on both sides of the conservation divide, the SNH chairman is now
turning his attention to educating the next generation. He is haunted by
a poem he once read in an educational magazine:
Before he went to school
he could read
the bark of trees,
leaf veins,
seashell-convolutions,
footprints,
and the touch of fingers;
now he goes to school,
and he can only read words.
To reverse this state of affairs, SNH has launched ''The Community
Chest'', which is Magnusson's favourite project. The idea is to
distribute ''pirate chests'' to schools, Scout groups and the like,
stuffed with videos, booklets, and information sheets on protecting the
environment. A pilot project has proved enormously successful, and is
being extended throughout the country.
''It's our sacred duty to think of natural heritage not as something
we can inherit and squander, but as something that we have to pass on --
that we must bequeath to the future. And it is the youngsters that are
going to carry the torch.''
Hence his latest bright idea: to provide ''A Week in the Countryside''
for every Scottish child, every year. He admits it is ''a fairly loony
idea'', which depends entirely on someone sponsoring it. ''But it only
needs one voluntary organisation to pick it up and run with it, and it
will spread. In 25 years, it will become automatic.''
Magnusson fondly recalls that when he was a boy, he was allowed to
collect birds' eggs. ''I hope to see the day when you can start doing
that again, because no birds will be rare; when you will be able to
pluck wild flowers without breaking the law, because the law will no
longer be necessary. We are failing as long as birds are rare. We are
failing as long as things need to be protected against human beings.''
Given such a passionate commitment to safeguarding our countryside, it
is hardly surprising that Magnusson considers he has the best job in
Scotland. ''It is the most gratifying job in Scotland, because we are
working with the stuff of life, which is the natural heritage. It's the
natural heritage that sustains us. If we don't sustain it, then we are
all going to pot.''
He has one more year as SNH chairman to go, and he has no idea whether
the Secretary of State for Scotland will invite him to continue for
another term. It seems a reasonable bet. Conservation has become, after
all, his specialist subject.
And while he may have to continue dodging flak from partisans of
hunting, shooting, and rambling, nothing will please him more one day
than seeing wee boys plucking wild flowers on the banks of the Dighty
Burn.

RON BROWN no doubt expresses the disquiet felt by many with New
Labour's direction (April 27). Is the party of compassion in danger of
jettisoning its founding principles?
Speaking about Soviet policy and intention at the outbreak of war in
1939, Winston Churchill, that man of many letters, complained: ''It is a
riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma''.
Is that a valid description of today's Labour Party? Probably not. Yet
there is much to mystify. Perhaps the core problem lies with a
party-political system which, together with our flawed and perverse
electoral mechanism, is becoming less and less representative of the
people. Can they both continue to serve the best interests of democracy
in the third millennium?
World complexity, diversity of opinion, and a need to inhibit
individual expression are becoming too much for the survival of unitary
party politics as a viable instrument of statecraft, or of cogent
opposition. The problem is universal. Yet what are the credible
alternatives?
To paraphrase the great man: the next General Election is not the end
of party politics. It might not even be the beginning of the end. But it
could, perhaps, signal the end of our unquestioning acquiescence.

I HAVE just had my faith in life's endless possibilities restored --
my old scoutmaster has become Scotland's first lottery millionaire.
Without a jot of assistance from Mystic Meg or even West Lothian
District Council's computer department, Linlithgow's Jim McGurk scooped
a substantial part of last week's roll-over pool.
As it happens, this particular piece of luck couldn't have been
visited on a nicer bloke, although I admit to being somewhat miffed that
all these years ago he didn't instruct me in random numbers theory
instead of wasting time with reef knots and bell tents.
This happy story of the lottery finger of fate hovering over my home
town is about the only recent good news for Camelot.
Such is the power of the Government's alchemy that everything it
touches turns to dust instead of glistening like gold. Even a pretty
straightforward good news story like the lottery has fallen victim to
Major's reverse Midas effect.
First there was the hand-out to young Winston. Nowt to do with us,
says the Government. It was a committee of the great and the good which
decided to line the Churchillian pockets while leaving much more
deserving causes far back in the queue.
However, to paraphrase James Connolly, the great are only great
because they are good at getting on their knees for Government
preferment. And anyway, with that uncanny knack of reading the public
mood which keeps the Prime Minister in a permanent political crisis,
''honest'' John sees no evil in the nation's bequest to the Churchill
family.
If the country were feeling good about the disbursement of the lottery
millions, the Prime Minister would be claiming the credit. Since it
clearly is not, it is only right that he takes the rap.
Even the ''Great Dame'' herself has now let it be known that her own
Thatcher papers will be handed over free. A grateful nation can look
forward to receiving such gems as the draft copy of the ''Sermon on the
Mound'' delivered to the General Assembly in 1988. This was the occasion
when she reinterpreted the parable of the ''Good Samaritan'' and told
the bemused elders and brethren that the real point of the story was
that the Samaritan was rich!
To allow the lottery money to be abused in a game of family fortunes
that even Margaret Thatcher refuses to play is remarkable. To manage to
make a political negative out of a process of handing out pots of money
is a feat of truly Majorillian proportions.
If this weren't bad enough for the lottery, then came the scandal of a
few vendors who were testing all their scratch cards to remove the
winning lines before selling them on to a gullible public.
It is not immediately clear how Camelot intends to make its tickets
fraud-proof. Nor has anything been said about reimbursing the ''mug''
punters who have spent their money with no chance of winning.
If this publicity has the effect of torpedoing sales of the instant
lottery scratch cards then I for one will raise a cheer. This is despite
the fact that when it comes to a flutter, I'm a sinner rather than a
saint.
I have risked a few bob on the horses ever since my uncle explained to
me why a horse called Arkle would tame England's pride, Millhouse, in
the Gold Cup. My early forays into the sport of kings were financed by
doing a round for Vernons Pools. Last Saturday, while Jim McGurk was
celebrating, I was crumpling up my ticket.
However, despite my own speculative background I can see a real danger
of the instant lottery game creating a lot of human misery. The big
weekly draw seems to me to be a relatively harmless pastime. The biggest
danger is the one to viewer sanity in the mind-bogglingly poor BBC
lottery show.
Since hope springs eternal most people will be more than satisfied
with a reasonable number of lines. By the time you find your numbers
aren't up it is a full week until the next draw.
The scratch cards are different and much more pernicious. There is
still the lure of winning big money but also the instant temptation of
immediately having another go when the first attempt fails.
It is the equivalent of having fruit machines in just about every
corner shop in the country. What every gambler doesn't know is that the
secret of survival is never to chase your losses.
The millions which are being poured into this nonsense will mostly
come from people who can't afford to waste even a few pounds. That so
much money so far has ended up in the Churchill family vaults is an
insult, but the real injury is to the people who are being encouraged to
become hooked on a scratch card.
A Parliament with a shred of decency would put a stop to this. This
one will shut its eyes and pretend that it doesn't really matter that
Camelot is being allowed to peddle instant hope.

PEOPLE in the West learned about the Holocaust, finally and
irrefutably, at the very end of the war. Just before Hitler killed
himself in Berlin, the British reached Belsen.
There were, of course, scores of other camps and sites of thousands of
massacres in Eastern Europe that were liberated by the Russians. But
even though they announced what they had found, they did not allow
Western journalists and cameramen to visit the camps. Hitler had raged
at his staff when the ovens at Majdanek fell into the hands of the
enemy, and afterwards great efforts were made by the retreating Germans
to obliterate evidence of the genocide.
It took time and study to reveal what had happened. Belsen and Dachau
were different. Reporters and cameramen for British and American
newspapers arrived with the troops and described and photographed what
they saw. Alfred Hitchcock was sent with a British camera crew to film
the camps.
No-one under 60 now, at least, has much of a memory of the shock of
those revelations. We can see the film, but what the film cannot
recreate is the horror that engulfed the triumph of victory. Europe had
not merely been destroyed, it had been indelibly sullied by the Nazis'
crimes. The question for us now is whether the years have washed away
the stain.
Is Europe, in particular is Germany, clean again? We must hope that it
is, of course. We lived for two generations, metaphorically-speaking,
with the stench of the crime, and the Germans bore the collective guilt.
But that is now 50 years ago.
You hear a lot about the Germans' efforts to admit their parents'
evils, and there is a settled agreement that we should never forget.
That's easy to say. The real question is just what we are meant to
remember, and how.
It is not at all unreasonable for Germans in their 50s and younger,
the majority of the people, to insist that they had nothing to do with
Hitler and his crimes and must not be held accountable. Equally, it is
reasonable for those who are not Germans, including Jews, to accept that
Germany is an ordinary, prosperous European country, richer than others
but not dominant like Bismarck's or Hitler's reich, where you will be
prosecuted for jay-walking and you cannot buy food at weekends. But
otherwise entirely normal.
IS THIS to forget? And if we think too much on those images of Belsen,
are we not unjust to the innocent grandchildren of the criminals?
American photographer Erich Hartmann and his wife Ruth have just
published a book of photographs of the camps as they are now.
He was born near Munich, where Dachau, the first concentration camp,
was set up. He has a vivid childhood memory of seeing a Stormtrooper
guarding a Jewish prisoner.
His father had the wit and luck to save his family and escape to
America. Hartmann returned to Germany as a young soldier in the American
Army in 1945. His book is more than a collection of beautiful and
disturbing photographs. It is a perfect illustration of the durability
of memory and the transience of the works of man.
The camps, of course, were not built to last and it is not surprising
that they are crumbling into ruin. Soon nothing authentic will remain.
Already, much that is displayed there is reconstruction.
But the aura of those frightful places, captured by Hartmann's
photographs, is as palpable now as it was 50 years ago, even without the
bodies and the stench of death.
At the end of their pilgrimage, Ruth Hartmann discovered a small
playground in Hamburg. During the war, there was a sanitorium next to
it, where a dozen Jewish children were guarded and protected by the
devotion of their nurses. At the very end, as the British Army
approached the city, the SS came and hanged them all.
You will not forget the row of memorial stones on the wall of the
playground, for the children and their nurses. As Mrs Hartmann points
out, it is hard to grasp the idea of one million dead, but very easy to
understand a dozen children, several of them under 10, taken into the
basement to be hanged, in May 1945.
Perhaps the best way to answer the question how to remember, 50 years
later, is to be guided by the Germans. They are not murderers, but they
mourn for the dead and for the lost souls of their parents and
grandparents. After a generation of denial, led of course by those who
were themselves guilty or who turned their backs to the atrocious
reality, they at last admit, and understand.
They do not forgive or forget, so we can forgive them for crimes they
never committed. There are always flowers under those memorials to the
murdered children in the Hamburg playground, set by their neighbours.

BEFORE the play even began the three actresses had run themselves
ragged, silently pounding the stage against the projected background
motif ''Treadmill'', an immediate, effective image of the draining
quality -- if mental rather than physical -- of doing bird. Despite the
sweat-inducing exercise, their performances were fiercely physical,
tendons straining throughout both taut, stylised sequences and highly
emotive monologues, the latter evincing a commitment and submersion in
character that was wholly absorbing.
The third play in CAT, a Theatre Company's trilogy of prison dramas,
covers an impressive amount of ground, sweeping through the mercurial
relationships between three inmates -- Margaret (Liz Ranken), who has
murdered her abusive husband; Terry (Molly Innes), a prostitute; and
Angie (Annie George), a compulsive shoplifter -- their personal
histories and the cultural nuances which have circumscribed their lives,
whether inside or out.
A slight narrative strand, the passing of their sentences, links short
scenes which are tightly directed by Irvine Allan, who leads his cast
through a chain of brutality, pathos, and crude humour, allowing them to
reveal rather than expose emotions.
The involvement of experienced choreographer Ranken, who plays
Margaret as a monstrously demented yet vulnerable creature, adds further
crispness, with every movement of the trio creating a deliberate comma
or question mark, supplementing the excellent script of Willy Maley,
John Maley, and Billy Elliott.
This is sprinkled with popular cultural references which add
authenticity but are overplayed. Scenes where the women satirise
contemporary advertisements or game shows are amusing but laboured and
unoriginal, and a final extended pastiche on a beauty show -- Victim of
the Year -- added nothing to the characterisations. Superior
performances and staging distinguish the play, a moving and rigorously
inquiring examination of the prison experience.

BY DEFINITION a postmortem cannot revive the patient but only
establish the cause of death. So it seems the right term for the probes
conducted by Scottish Conservatives in the past few days, and for a
major examination of the entrails at their conference next week, to pick
over the grisly, meagre remains of their electoral position.
The meetings seem, however, to have been curiously unproductive. We
read about the plain speaking by activists who see their years of work
in ruins, and of Ministers listening intently while aides scribble
copious notes. But talk comes easy when nobody has a clue what to do. As
for the conference changing anything -- well, I am reminded of the
occasion when, on one of the usual bland motions, some indignant
minority got a card-vote and the platform, against all expectation and
experience, lost. The chairman stared in horror at the figures presented
to him, his rheumy eyes watering and the red veins on his nose standing
out. ''I think we should take that vote again,'' he announced. Needless
to say, the conference did its duty the second time round and
triumphantly endorsed the offical line.
The same sort of people are still chorusing that there is nothing
wrong with policy, only with presentation, and that any temporary
setback has to be laid at the door of the party's own troublemakers. But
a moment of truth must arrive sooner or later. In fact there have been
almost from the outset in 1979 three coherent critiques of Tory
government in Scotland -- not from the Opposition, whose job it is to
oppose -- but from inside the party itself.
The most persistent of those critiques is that the Conservative
administration has always gone too far, at the bidding of crazed
Thatcherites in London. The sale of council houses was fine. But there
should have been no privatisation. Public expenditure should never have
been cut (it has not been, by the way). Education and the health service
should have been left alone. Ailing industries should have been propped
up. In short, only by continuing the tradition of One Nation could Scots
Tories have saved themselves from their horrible fate.
There are obvious objections to all this. It seems to me to be broadly
the policy that George Younger followed as Secretary of State till 1986,
and it did not prevent the first massacre of Conservatives at the
General Election of 1987. In today's circumstances it appears to ask for
the adoption of Labour's programme, when Labour has been eagerly
adopting the Tory programme. But I leave those objections aside, to note
that there is still probably the most widespread of the critiques,
represented by such as Bailie John Young of Glasgow.
A second critique, from some of the same people but from others too,
is that Conservatives ought to have had a policy on devolution.
Patriotism is a natural part of the Tory armoury. The party has stunted
itself in ignoring or, even worse, pouring scorn on the renewed sense of
Scottishness we see all around us. What is more, Conservatives could
even yet draw up a scheme better than the one from the Constitutional
Convention, which will deliver Scotland trussed and gagged into the
corrupt and degrading thrall of her existing political establishment.
Here again there are objections. Tory home rulers form only a tiny
minority, and usually keep their mouths shut. When they last dared to
speak out, in 1988, the conference overwhelmingly rejected their
proposals. Some, such as Struan Stevenson, have since recanted, though
no doubt those who recant once can recant twice. In any event, as the
party has shrunk it has become all the more unionist, for non-unionists
just go somewhere else. And if it is not going to fight the next
election on the Union, what is it going to fight the election on?
The third critique comes from the right. It holds that the party has
missed endless opportunities through sheer doziness. So far from
soft-peddling Thatcherism, it should have been at the cutting edge.
Local government should have been at the cutting edge. Local government
should have been slimmed down in 1979 rather than in 1996. Scotland
should have had the first privatisations rather than the last. Quangos
and subsidies should have been scrapped rather than expanded.
Conservative values are values which vast numbers of Scots share, but
mealy-mouthed leadership has contrived to hide that fact from them.
The trouble is that this critique did have its moment, when Michael
Forsyth was at the Scottish Office. He got more kicks than ha'pence for
what he did there, though the critique anyway built a certain degree of
unpopularity into its programme. The whole point was to pursue a
consistent line till it convinced people and started to pay off, as it
had so obviously done in England. But the party took fright, and
preferred weakness to strength. Now, from his refuge in an English
Ministry, Forsyth is content to watch it stew in its own juice.
From all this, though, we can conclude that Scots Tories have in fact
been quite creative despite, or because of, their troubles, and could
have worked out numerous alternative policies.
While each critique has pros and cons, it is hard to believe that any
would have brought results more catastrophic than those of the actual
policies. But do you know what? None of them is even going to be
seriously considered, let alone accepted. The party will continue to be
run by yes-men, leg-men, and placemen working on two principles: that
nobody should rock their boat in Scotland, and that everybody should
take the orders they pass down the line from London. So the placemen
keep their places; the party dies.

LAST night's show at the concert hall was proof positive, if it were
needed, that Liza Minnelli doesn't have a monopoly on the Garland genes:
Judy's other singing daughter, Lorna Luft, has clearly inherited a fair
share of them too. She exudes the same kind of star quality as her
mother and sister: not only does she belt out the showstoppers and tug
at the heartstrings at exactly the right moments, but she does it with a
great deal of good old-fashioned showbiz panache (witness the eight
costume changes).
Neither Garland nor Minnelli, however, was mentioned during this
two-hour wheech through the world of musicals on which Luft was
accompanied by Phantom of the Opera star Dave Willetts. Grinning
cheesily, they duetted their way through a handful of Broadway numbers
and swapped obviously unspontaneous, and decidedly tactless, remarks
about this great country -- England. The jokes fell flat and the pair
must have realised that they'd do better to shut up and get on with it
(so to speak).
Most of the lowpoints of the night came courtesy of Willetts, special
mention in this category going to his rendition of The Wonderful Thing
About Tiggers in a section devoted to Disney. He fared much better with
a medley of Phantom tunes, no surprise there.
Luft, on the other hand, just seemed to get better all the time.
Especially since she -- bravely -- concentrated on sensitive ballads
rather than brash production-type tunes: Stephen Sondheim's Nothin's
Gonna Hurt You; His Is The Only Music (from Jule Styne's Funny Girl),
and Irving Berlin's What'll I Do were all ravishing in their poignancy.
And the packed concert hall just loved her.

PICTURE the scene: it is the foyer of the Royal Concert Hall during
the interval at the Royal SNO's final concert of their winter season,
just over a week ago. A couple of regulars are blethering over a drink
and the subject of Mayfest comes up. One says that there doesn't appear
to be a classical music programme at all this year. The other comments
that he'd have been interested to see the young company Opera on a
Shoestring in their production of Verdi's La Traviata, but he's not free
that night.
They were both wrong, but it wasn't their fault -- both are seasoned
concert-goers, sophisticated in their tastes and used to negotiating the
geography of multiple-concert brochures.
The fault is entirely that of Mayfest, which has made a comprehensive
blunder -- from conception to presentation -- in the construction of its
classical music programme. Oh, by the way, there is a classical music
programme, contrary to Mayfest director Paul Bassett's statement in an
interview. The programme contains about 16 events -- some of them
receiving multiple performances. Forgive the approximations, but every
time I attempt a head count from the brochure -- the worst presentation
I have come across in years of dealing with marketing bumph -- I come up
with a different number.
If this is beginning to look like a diatribe, then before Mayfest
director Paul Bassett goes ballistic let me state that this isn't just
another assault on the Mayfest brochure. Nor is it a broadside at the
classical music programme. Quite the opposite. If the programme was
naff, then it wouldn't be worth the effort in wasting the words.
In fact, without drawing any comparisons with previous Mayfests, this
year's contains an interesting music programme. It is full of good
ideas: unusual programmes in unfamiliar contexts from familiar groups.
This is exactly what Paul Bassett stated as his intention: to use
indigenous organisations, but give them something different to do, and
perhaps in a venue or a context off their regular beat.
Fine. Having done all that, instead of realising that this move in
itself represented a theme or focus to the overall programme of events,
what has Mayfest done? It has completely dispersed the events by
employing the scatter principle and dumping them into a brochure whose
weaknesses of structure and presentation should have been spotted at the
discussion stage.
The net effect is twofold. First: any coherence or cumulative effect
the music programme might have had is completely dissipated. Second: the
classical music programme thus has no sense of unity, character, or
identity.
If there is a logic or purpose to Mayfest's approach, it completely
escapes me. Is Mayfest embarrassed about the presence in its programme
of classical music? Is it trying to bury it? Paul Bassett might profess
an egalitarian philosophy towards all art forms in Mayfest, be they
classical, comedy or club. But surely to God any awareness of
specifically-interested audience groups would suggest some sort of
organisation of the components of the programme.
Fundamental rules have been ignored. Information: tell people clearly
what is on and how often. Opera on a Shoestring's Traviata receives six
performances, for example (so the chap in the first paragraph above
would have five other opportunities to see it). But every single person
on the music scene to whom I have spoken assumed that it was a one-off
performance, because that first-night blurb in the Mayfest brochure
didn't say otherwise.
Nor was there any information about the production itself: that it's
the company's first full-scale production, that it's in the round, that
it's using unusual forces for accompaniment, or who's singing in the
company's biggest cast to date. If you don't tell people, how do you
expect to attract them?
Similarly with Music Theatre Lab's Sondheim evening, Marry Me a
Little, which will receive six performances at Hyndland's Cottier
Theatre, though you may have to search to find them in the brochure. And
look carefully: some are early-evening, some late-night.
No programme details are given about the Chamber Group of Scotland's
fascinating study of the neglect of women composers (with a narrative by
Janice Galloway, piano trios by Fanny Mendelssohn and Clara Schumann,
and the first complete performance of a work by the RSAMD's Janet Beat).
This, incidentally, is one of three Sunday afternoon concerts at the
Cottier: another fact that could have been made into a feature.
There is no information whatsoever about Paragon's War Ends in Europe
programme (in fact a community project that will include an interesting
new piece by William Sweeney incorporating popular songs of the period
and memories of the home front). There is inaccurate information about
the concert by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra which will not, despite
the layout in the brochure, be appearing with a group called Sinfonietta
Accademica -- the title of one of two pieces by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies
that the SCO will perform. (And the other one's wrong, too.)
And does Mayfest realise the packaging opportunity missed in this
year's programme? The exceptional Paragon Ensemble has never been in the
King's Theatre. Nor has it done a show remotely like Over the Rainbow,
where the group will join singer Terry Neason to form one of the most
highly-charged combinations in the Mayfest music programme. It's a
double first. Same with Scottish Opera -- in The Shed for the first time
-- which has never previously staged a show quite like Sound Bites. Nor,
in the same venue and also for the first time, has the BBC Scottish
Symphony Orchestra with Britten's War Requiem.
And an entire thematic strand could have been built around the events
(and some of their unusual characteristics) being staged in the West
End's Cottier Theatre -- a venue being catapulted into significance.
The complete lack of coherence in the organisation and presentation of
the Mayfest music programme is, as a colleague observed, the enemy of a
programme that is actually quite original. It's strange that Mayfest
seems either not to have noticed or consciously to have ignored that
fact.
Some of the programme information outlined above has only become clear
through a flurry of press releases and phone calls from individual
companies and venues. It seems clear that many of them feel that Mayfest
has failed to target or market appropriately the events they are
promoting.
The new Mayfest administration has, in its first programme, consigned
wholly to the past all the work of its predecessors. Okay. A new brush
will always sweep. But whatever one thought of the quality of individual
events in recent festivals, there was clear evidence (especially last
year) that structured thinking was at last beginning to settle in to the
planning of the music programme.
It is the apparent ditching overboard of that thinking that has left
Paul Bassett's first music programme adrift within the festival -- a
whole raft of fascinating events rudderless, all bobbing around
aimlessly in a heaving sea of artistic activity.
Is Mayfest embarrassed about the presence in its programme of
classical music? Is it trying to bury it?

STOUT chap, that Phil Gallie. Lashing out on behalf of Scotland's
chastisers in the Commons this week, he argued that Labour's attempt to
outlaw the use of canes, belts, whips, and other soft toys on children
was ''motivated by political correctness and is yet another small step
towards the ultimate goal whereby parents would be refused any right to
chastise''.
That's hitting them where it hurts. You can see the argument, surely?
First prevent kiddy-caning and the next thing you know someone will be
questioning the time-honoured right of Tory MPs to be chastised any way
they fancy. What will be left of democracy if government were deprived
of the odd firm smack or three?
Nevertheless, Michael Connarty, Labour's impertinent man from Falkirk
East, felt it necessary to ask Gallie if he had ever struck his adopted
children. Indeed, said Gallie, and he made no apology for it.
He did add, though, that he had never caused the two children ''undue
pain or misery''. We guess, since he won't belt up, Gallie saved the
pain and misery for the voters of Ayr.
Sixteen years of strict Tory government? Never did us any harm.
About-face
MORE subtle political analysis, this time from the philosophers at the
journal Class War (''Special -- Why Labour Are Crap. Page 11''). Having
taken Tony Blair somewhat to task in its last issue, the racy periodical
this month offers a full and fair apology.
''In Issue 66 of Class War we referred to the Leader of Her Majesty's
Opposition as 'chipmunk face' and 'chipmunk chops' . . . We now accept
that this was a gross libel against all decent chipmunks, and we humbly
apologise for any offence we may have caused.''
Friday on his mind
LAST word on politics: From Trafford, somewhere to the north-west of
Middle England, comes news of candidate John Kelly, a man living in hope
of election to the local council tomorrow. His campaign leaflet goes
straight to the point: ''Are you depressed, unhappy, suicidal? Then
think of what it's like for me as a Conservative candidate in the
present political climate.''
Cheer up, John. If you're miserable now, imagine how you're going to
feel on Friday morning.
Fire escape
SAD news from Niagara Falls, where an outbreak of fire-raising at the
Houdini Magical Hall of Fame has destroyed many of the great
illusionist's artefacts. Needless to say, the culprit has disappeared
into thin air.
Cuckoos in the nest
SO WHAT did the Swiss do in the war, daddy? A good question, my son,
but not one they are notably eager to answer as the VE-Day anniversary
approaches.
For decades most of the world has been happy with the alpine excuse
that they stayed out of the unpleasantness for reasons of principle.
Long tradition of neutrality . . . safe haven for refugees . . . Red
Cross . . . Honest broker . . . and so forth. Not so, it seems.
While the rest of Europe has been making plans to mark the anniversary
of its liberation, the cuckoos have been coming to terms with the idea
that the country's wartime regime might just have colluded with the
Nazis in their dealings with Jews. More to the point, the country's
neutrality, so it has been said, was simply a banking convenience for
the Reich, and a nice earner for the gnomes.
Last month Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti spoke up at last. ''We cannot
and must not deny that Switzerland was implicated in the unspeakable
barbarism of the time.''
Fair enough, but when it became clear that no official VE-Day
commemoration ceremonies were planned, protests mounted. Recently,
therefore, it was announced that a church service organised by a local
Jewish-Christian society would be held in Bern on May 7.
What are described as ''church leaders and government officials''
didn't take to this idea. They tried to persuade the organisers of the
service to drop any references to the Swiss role in supplying the German
war machine. They also attempted to cancel a reading by the novelist Max
Frisch which will tell of a Swiss border guard turning away a Jewish
refugee.
Why are we telling you this? Why not? This has been a Diary travel
service.
Stirring message
CONSUMERISM is, as we know, a disease. Some people will buy just about
anything; some will even pay to be awakened of a morning by a
''pre-recorded message from a celebrity plugging his or her latest
cause''. Who said Radio Scotland?
In reality, the service is available in Los Angeles, courtesy of
something called the Telephone Entertainment Network. Among its many
attractions is O J Simpson lawyer Johnnie Cochran, who intones: ''It's
the first day of the rest of your life.''
Our best guess is that O J is not yet a subscriber to this valuable
service.
Caught short
SUCH has been the astounding economic success of the former Soviet
Union since it threw off the shackles of tyranny, embraced the markets,
and learned to love capitalism, that lumberjacks in northern Russia were
recently paid in tampons because their employer had run short of cash.
The opposite difficulty has been afflicting the Ukraine, which at the
turn of the year issued a new bank note worth 500,000 karbovanets.
Thirty five tonnes of old karbovanet notes with denominations below 100
were recycled into toilet paper. Chancellor Clarke please note.
Disgrace by degrees
WE ARE the last to say that politicians can't be trusted; we merely
note that Mexico's Education Minister has just resigned.
Last autumn the local press challenged Fausto Alzati's claim that he
held a doctorate. Later, his office admitted that, OK, the Minister only
held a master's degree in public administration from Harvard. Then, with
the chase hotting up, Alzati's people conceded he might not even hold a
bachelor's degree.
A few weeks ago the man in charge of Mexican education resigned after
admitting he had been expelled from the second grade for bad behaviour.
Enterprise culture
YOU probably didn't need to know this, but Star Trek Mastercards are
now available in the US. Holders are entitled to free issues of the
Official Fan Club Magazine and discounted admissions to fan conventions
and theme parks.
Just think, with your plastic on stun, you could watch your debts
boldly go where no debts have ever gone before.

OH DEAR, they say. Here go the women again, sprawling and wayward and
refusing to give us the neat hedgerow narratives we so long for.
Rona Munro's 1995 Peggy Ramsay award-winner, The Maiden Stone (the
first of its kind named after the late literary agent who was Joe
Orton's and is David Hare's, as well as many others besides) is a wildly
imaginative piece of storytelling. Set in North-east Scotland in the
nineteenth century, like her last play, Bold Girls, it tears ebulliently
into the world of women, if less coherently.
An odd mix of allegory, folk-tale, exploration into the meaning of
theatrical representation -- what it means to be seen, to have and use a
voice -- and the unremitting nature of childbirth, it's certainly a
demanding if rewarding evening.
Like Bold Girls, Munro's two contrasting protagonists -- the driven,
slightly mad and vain English actress, Harriet and Bidie, the more
instinctual Scottish wet-nurse -- are both caught by romantic visions of
the male. If The Maiden Stone is about anything it is about how such
illusions can lead to terrible heartache (as well as a swelling tummy)
and how true art's roots still lie in the messy blood, sweat, and tears
of real life.
Munro writes with immense force and vision even if, written as it is
in the old Doric dialect of her childhood, she sometimes pushes
comprehension to the limit. Frances Tomelty in Matthew Lloyd's
production is commanding as the wilful Harriet; Shirley Henderson (of
Hamish Macbeth fame), Carol Ann Crawford, Sarah Howe, and Alexander
Morton as a travelling rogue, all bring strong support. For those who
have ears to hear, rich fare indeed.

SO, WE can send a man to the moon, huh? So what? What use is a society
which can come up with keyhole surgery, the Internet, three-minute
pizzas, and the Wonderbra, when it can't even perfect a quiet drill?
Why, oh why when a road needs dug or when a cable needs laid can't
construction companies point some super-sonic laser at the ground which
would sizzle simply, and more crucially, silently through the Tarmac? If
Superman can do it why can't they?
But no. Oh no. They have to make a meal out of it. I reckon a secret
society of Luddites has control over Britain's building companies; they
convene and shake their hands over cavemen tactics, then send their
labourers out on the jobs with instruments whose only apparent
technological superiority over the tools Fred and Barney wielded is the
capacity to generate 20 times the noise.
A few weeks ago I received a hand-delivered letter. ''The Information
Superhighway is coming your way -- in the shape of a state-of-the-art
telephone and television network'', they announced. Little did I know
that this innocuous purple-tinged epistle was the equivalent of a
poison-pen letter to my sanity. I felt so excited at the prospect of my
own ''Direct Line to the Future'', of multi-channel access, interactive
home shopping, and telecommuting that I paid scant attention to the
apologetic postscript: ''Regrettably there will be some inconvenience to
the residents.''
When the metal signs were erected at the end of the street with a
similar apology for inconvenience, I hardly gave them a second glance.
When the vans full of labourers pulled up outside my house and began
sizing up the terrain I thought nought of it. After all, a Direct Line
to the Future was surely worth some slight disruption of the present.
Two weeks later I was on the phone to the local police, trying to
surrender myself for attempted murder. ''I haven't done anything yet,''
I wept, ''but I'm about to. I can't take it any more.'' The desk
sergeant listened carefully to my frothy fury. ''I know, I know,'' he
emphasised, ''they were in my street for weeks, but there's nothing you
can do.''
''But it must be against the law. It's after seven o'clock at night,
they've been here for almost 12 hours,'' I wailed.
''Well, no,'' the well-intentioned clod explained. ''They probably
have permission to work during daylight hours.''
''But it's spring,'' I shrieked. ''It doesn't get dark till about
10.''
I seized the purple letter. He was right. ''Work takes place during
daylight hours from Monday to Friday,'' and sometimes at weekends too.
''Right,'' I told the cop. ''I'm doing something about this.''
''Eh, perhaps we'd better send a car around,'' he offered.
The builders had shown up outside my bedroom window at 7.30 one
morning and proceeded to enter what seemed to be drilling competitions
with one another. The drills didn't just crack up the concrete, they
splintered my nerve ends. The first day I grumbled about it when friends
phoned. The second day I raved about it when friends phoned. The third
day I screamed about it when anyone phoned. Nobody phoned me on the
fourth day. I had turned into a hysterical obsessive, a victim of a
catch 22; a viral infection affecting my balance meant I was trying to
rest at home but my home had just been transformed into my very own
torture garden.
The next week they patched up the path, packed up, and moved across
the street. My calm slowly started to return. Then they returned, having
obviously fluffed the initial operation. The bombardment began again. My
calm evaporated. I phoned the police, then raced into the street, took
up my best ''do you feel lucky'' stance, and confronted them.
''What time are you working here till?'' I shouted above the
apocalyptic roar. They grinned and mimed deafness. They probably meant
it, as with typical aesthetically macho ostentatiousness they weren't
wearing protective earmuffs. I pointed at my watch and jumped up and
down, a pointless pantomime which at first fell on deaf ears until
eventually I tantrummed them into submission and they left.
A phone call to the council the next morning confirmed that the
workmen more or less had carte blanche to work from dawn to dusk,
regardless of residents' mental health. Stupified that such noise
terrorism was officially endorsed I suddenly understood why calls to The
Right to Peace and Quiet Campaign have escalated so much that the
organisation can no longer answer public phone inquiries.
News stories that have either mystified or amused me over the past few
years began to make sense. When a woman was jailed for a week for
continuously playing Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You I smirked
and sneered that she deserved to be banged up for such bad taste. Now I
truly comprehend the seriousness of her crime. Enlightenment has also
dawned as to why a court in London let a 41-year-old man walk free after
he shot his 35-year-old neighbour in the stomach, in the late eighties.
The Old Bailey accepted that the accused had been ''provoked beyond
endurance'' by his neighbour playing loud reggae music day and night.
AND while Noriega is undoubtedly one of the fiends of our time, it
seems surprising that Amnesty didn't step in when the US Army bombarded
the dictator with rock music, when he took refuge in the Vatican
Embassy. But at least rock, reggae, and, OK, even Whitney Houston, has a
rhythm to it, unlike the monotonous moan of a drill. Non-stop DIY must
be the contemporary domestic equivalent of Chinese water torture.
My tormentors have now gone but I am a broken woman. Before I even got
my mitts on a remote control or an interactive shopping credit account,
cable television has destroyed my life. The lass who loved to dance to
blaring sounds in clubs, who reached for the radio the moment she awoke,
whose Walkman was a constant companion, is no more. For the past week I
have flinched at dropping pins. Now I spend the day with a pillow over
my head, dreaming of monastic calm and a future spent embroidering a
tapestry bearing the legend ''Silence is Golden''.

THIS is just the kind of circus that any thinking adult would want to
run away and join. The kind of circus that makes you want to lie about
your vertigo, your lack of hand-eye co-ordination, you inability to
catch anything other than the cold. GOSH . . . but I am smitten.
It all starts off in a deceptively easy-oasy way. Folk amble on stage.
Admittedly looking a bit odd -- is that man a transvestite -- or is he
climbing over us in search of a change of clothes?
Bit by bit the stage fills with bizarre characters. It's as if the lid
had been lifted on some ramshackle Berlin boarding house to reveal a
family of engaging zanies. The two guys who casually cross the stage
slipping cigarettes from the hands of one into the mouth of the other .
. . the woman upstairs who just happens to dangle out of her ''window''
in a stunning flurry of aerial acrobatics . . . The naked keyboards
player, towel round his waist, forever trying to get into the bathroom
-- which we can see is only a door but a door that admits all kinds of
surreal tomfoolery.
What GOSH offer in Shak Edi Bobo is a gamut of fun that ricochets from
the simply daft to the subtler reaches of inspired quirkiness, all to
the stonking rythms of an on-stage band. And at the heart of all this is
the hilarious relationship between Bobo (Boris Arquier) and the Captain
(Martin van Bracht). Arquier is a total clown: his bones collapse and
tumble like a human slinky, his face crumples and stretches in every
comedic direction. Glorious. Suspend your cares for a couple of hours --
it needs no other skill than to go GOSH.

JUDGED by their own very high standards in making Shakespeare
accessible to young people, TAG Theatre Company's Scottish premiere of
Liz Lochhead's adaptation of The Tempest -- commissioned by London's
Unicorn Theatre and first staged two years ago -- really fails to make
the grade.
In fairness, it will probably improve markedly as the tumbling,
dancing, and slapstick that is an integral part of it become slicker,
but the show's attempt to use the magic of theatre to explore the world
of magic is not half magical enough.
Prospero (Dougal Lee) is a clarinet-playing stage magician, Drinculo
(John Kazek) a music hall comedian. Caliban (Andy Williams) emerges
tortoise-like from a wicker hamper, and Raymond Short's Antonio is a
near relative of Ron Moody's Fagan. He happens on a Desert Island Discs'
gramophone and The Complete Works of Shakespeare and tells the young
audience: ''I never cared much for Shakespeare.''
Lochhead, on the other hand, cares rather too much. It is a fine thing
that poetry like ''We are such stuff as dreams are made . . .'' has been
retained, but it often sits uneasily beside her own distinctive use of
the vernacular. Among the cast there was also a huge variation in
audibility.
The panto style does provide an easy ''in'' to a difficult play (one
youngster even felt moved to contribute a ''Behind you!'' yesterday
afternoon), but Leslie Finlay's production ultimately seems rather
static, for all its use of Andy Howitt's choreography. Hopefully it will
have sharpened up for the children's festival in Edinburgh (May 26),
when the running gag about the financial troubles of the Empire Theatre
should go down a bomb.

For 21 years Glasgow Film Theatre has presented works which could send
sheltered intellects reeling for their green pens. Ann Donald takes its
current temperature
EVERYONE from popstar Marti Pellow to Martin Scorsese has darkened the
doorway of 12 Rose Street, Glasgow. Willem Dafoe has lectured there and
only the other day Andrea Calderwood, head of drama at BBC Scotland,
confessed to a misspent youth watching obscure, foreign films ''about
Hungarian lesbians'' in Cinema 1.
For in the past 21 years the Glasgow Film Theatre has not only played
a formative role in the social lives of Scotland's west coast west coast
population but has, in the words of director Ken Inglis, been the only
west coast cinema ''seriously and systematically to expose audiences to
world cinema''. Referring to the proliferation of all-action Arnie and
Rambo movies that dominated the multiplexes of the eighties, Inglis
says: ''It would have been a desert without the GFT.''
The cinema where obscure Hungarian classics are screened back-to-back
with the latest Keanu Reeves blockbuster has definitely made its mark on
the UK cinema circuit in the past two decades.
The first full-time film theatre to be estabished by the Scottish Film
Council, the GFT opened on May 2, 1974, with Frederico Fellini's bizarre
and highly personal international hit, Roma. The programming was not
coincidental, for this new 400-seater cinema with a conference room
situated downstairs was housed in the converted and much-loved Cosmo
Cinema, itself once renowned as being a haven for international film
buffs.
Local patrons and sponsors of GFT commemorative plaques, such as Edwin
Morgan and Anne McDuff, have fond memories of the Cosmo. ''It was the
only place where you really could see those interesting cosmopolitan
films that you had read about in books or newspapers,'' says Morgan. ''I
can still remember quite strongly films from 1938 to 1939.''
While McDuff laments the passing of the cinema she was virtually
reared in as a child of eight. ''I remember seeing my first
English-language film and asking my parents, 'Where are the words?'
because I was so used to subtitles.''
Under the guiding philosophy of cinema entrepreneur George Singleton
-- a man who believed that ''films should help improve things in the
world'' -- the Cosmo had nurtured a loyal art house audience among
Glaswegian cinema-goers since its own inception in 1939. Together with
the Mr Cosmo logo inventor, Charles Oakley, Singleton served up a steady
diet of pioneering French, Italian, Russian, and off-beat
English-language films.
However, by the late 1960s the division between the art house and
commercial cinemas was disintegrating. The ecology of film distribution
meant the Cosmo was now in competition with those city-centre cinemas
which had latched on to the fact that there were clear financial
benefits in screening so-called art house classics such as Last Tango In
Paris.
GFT's first joint director, John Brown, bluntly explains one reason
for the mass appeal in the permissive, swinging sixties lay in that
problematic three-letter word ''sex''.
''Art house movies were always more sexually explicit. By today's
standards they'd be tame beyond belief. But you have to put it into the
cultural revolution of the time; then, a bare back getting out of bed
would be explicit,'' explains the now screenwriter and member of the
GFT's board of governors.
Unable to compete, the Singleton's family business was bought over by
the Scottish Film Council, financially aided by the British Film
Institute and the City of Glasgow on the understanding that the GFT
would carry on the tradition of the Cosmo.
The key difference lay in the GFT's broader remit. As Brown succinctly
summarises: ''The GFT was an art house plus cinema modelled on the
National Film Theatre in London where they would screen a dozen
different films a week at a dozen different times.'' Or as the first May
1974 brochure -- with Spaghetti Western idol Clint Eastwood adorning the
cover -- proclaimed, the GFT would screen the work of everyone from
intellectual art director Ingmar Bergman to the critically-maligned
Sergio Leone.
As the brochure's introduction boldly espoused in lengthier terms, the
task was to ''reflect the contemporary cinema and film history that lies
behind it. Each film theatre season will include a major retrospective
(such as a director, a national cinema, or a historic period in film
history), together with subsidiary retrospectives, special events, and
late-night movies and appearances by film-makers.''
This manifesto of balancing culture and commerce still holds today,
where a curious audience of 25 watching an obscure Polish film about
Silesian miners in the 1930s are subsidised by a sell-out performance of
the latest Depardieu in Colonel Chabert.
The model regional cinema also had its teething problems. The absence
of any regional Scottish circuit in the seventies offering guaranteed
runs to lure distributors or new directors' work, meant Brown often
booked films ''blind'', relying on a director's reputation. Otherwise
there were intense three-day reconnaissance missions to London checking
out the new releases.
Financially too, the GFT was beginning to suffer as the SFC's
''baby''. As Brown explains: ''After 10 years of budgeting it became
clear that the GFT was getting the leftovers when it came to funding. We
(the SFC) thought that was unfair and that it should be free to argue
for its own money and subsidy.''
After independence in 1986 there was a launch to raise money for a
second 140-seater cinema to replace the old basement conference room.
The big guns of film making gathered round and with the help of GFT
regulars Bill Forsyth, Robbie Coltrane, Dicky Attenborough, and
long-term sponsors Becks, the cinema opened in 1991.
Described as ''a godsend'' by current director Ron Inglis, the second
screen and a box-office breaking Reservoir Dogs paved the way for
increased audiences that currently stand at around 150,000 annually.
They were the first Scottish cinema to appoint an education officer in
an attempt to nurture links with educational centres and have keenly
exploited their role in the Scottish arts scene, collaborating with
festivals and venues such as Mayfest, the Jazz Festival, and CCA.
The ''discerning'' Glaswegian viewer however is being wooed by the
commercial city centre cinema in a deja-vu scenario not dissimilar to
that of the Cosmo in the early seventies. Traditional art house movies
by the likes of Quentin Tarantino, Robert Altman and Nicholas Hytner's
The Madness of King George are now playing at the Odeon or MGM rather
than the GFT.
Inglis is unperturbed. ''I feel we've paved the way for a lot of
what's happening now because the commercials have obviously looked at
how successful venues like the GFT and the Filmhouse have been in the
past 10 years.''
The future according to Inglis lies in ''niche-marketing'' which means
targeting everyone from the Chinese community to the gay and lesbian
market to the trainspotters.
Their commitment to supporting local film makers is as strong as ever
with Tartan Shorts and First Reels series accompanying main features and
the books will hopefully be balanced by the regular screening of
big-budget Hollywood star-vehicles on a second run after premiering at
the commercial cinemas.
As to the next 21 years, Inglis is confident. ''I hope that we'll
continue to be at the cutting-edge of cinema development and film
programming, because that's what we're given public money to do -- to
boldly go where others fear to tread.'' Captain Kirk couldn't have put
it better.

LET'S be upfront about this. I am not, in general, a fan of musicals.
Nor am I, specifically, a fan of Stephen Sondheim's musicals. Sondheim
is, however, one of the most extraordinary song composers of the
century. Especially in songs of love: intricate songs in which he turns
over a stone and reveals the myriad emotions, from gratuitous indulgence
to bitter cynicism, that lurk beneath the world's most used three words.
So Music Theatre Lab's production of Marry Me a Little, which opened
last night for a Mayfest run at the Cottier Theatre, is more than an
anthology. In the sense that Sondheim's greatest strength is his ability
to penetrate expression and puncture sentiment, this show -- two
singers, a pianist and 18 superlative songs -- is distilled essence of
Sondheim, and carries the highest recommendation.
Director James Ross is alert to the complex layers of the songs --
while Carol Rowlands quivers with excitement and the thrill of
anticipation in the title song, baritone Clive Paget slumps in a seat,
slobbing it with popcorn, a beer and a belch. But Ross is also sensitive
to rare moments of purity, as in the wistful Once upon a Time, which
ends with a kiss and a look of wonder.
The songs range across the emotional spectrum: bitter-sweet, ironic,
scathing on the selfishness of sex, and a few moments of radiance. Carol
Rowlands, sexy and mobile of face, began tentatively and grew in
strength. Clive Paget, singing firmly through every phrase from the
start, showed some strain. Neil McFarlane's accompaniments were
sensitive and characterful. Well worth a look.
Five more performances. Check the chaotic Mayfest brochure carefully:
next two are 11pm on Friday and Saturday. Ideal, moody, late-night
listening.

Sara Villiers previews two offerings set to get the temperature rising
in the greenhouse
SO, what's it all about? It has to be one of the most intriguing
events in Mayfest; Linnaeus, Prince of Flowers, a large-scale promenade
performance in the Botanic Gardens, complemented by two sultry club
nights at The Arches and produced by the eclectic Theatrum Botanicum,
who are spearheaded by the dynamic young director Toby Gough.
On paper the subject matter, the life of an eighteenth-century Swedish
botanist, hardly gets the juices going, but in practice it's a
scintillating entertainment extravaganza and, in a previous incarnation
at Edinburgh's Royal Botanic Gardens, was one of the sensations of last
year's Fringe.
I meet Theatrum Botanicum at the Botanics: Roxanna Pope, the
choreographer, smiles hello before drifting off into the shrubbery;
young Jamie bounds about among the plants; producer Jon Iles tucks his
mobile phone away and starts painting props; while the eminently
likeable Gough paints his vision of the show for me.
In simple summation, it is a carnivalesque masquerade featuring a
group of players engaged in a power struggle with their boss, Mr Rich.
They present a morality play about Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist, who
introduced a widely accepted system of naming plants. He's a figure who
immediately becomes more alluring once Gough describes him as ''the
Marquis de Sade of botany''.
''Linnaeus projected all his sexual complexes on to the plant world.
He was obsessed with the genitalia of plants, ascribing male and female
attributes to stamens and pistils. He postulated an immoral plant life
and his books were banned by the Pope.''
''Appropriately, we begin in daylight and end when darkness has
fallen,'' says Gough. ''The time of Linnaeus was the Era of Liberty in
Sweden, when the government had shunted the king off to a puppet role
and when politicians were either Hats or Nightcaps. In that symbolic
battle for night and day the Hats won.'' He pauses. ''At least, I think
they did.''
In Britain, however, it was very much a case of clamping the nightcaps
on -- and taking the masks off. ''Walpole banned masquerades in 1789,''
says Gough. ''The carnival spirit was seen as amoral and anti-Christian.
In Shakespearian times people used carnivals to stage their uprisings.''
Gough hopes to create as wild an atmosphere as possible amidst the
ordered environs of the Botanics by giving out floral masks to the
audience. ''I think if you don a mask you discover a more fluid sense of
your sexuality,'' he says, inspiring a chorus of mock groans from his
colleagues.
The shape of the production has been partly dictated by the response
of volunteers, and the Glasgow version includes a performance by the
Indian dancer Sundarshan Dheer, as the Hindu God of Destruction.
About 50 people in total are involved with the production and Gough
computes the cast. ''Well, there's six flowers, three devils, and five
leads,'' he begins. ''And the Indian dancers,'' adds Iles. ''And the
musicians,'' continues Gough. ''A string quartet and a trumpeter,''
elaborates Iles. Iles is the trumpeter. ''And Cora Bissett,'' says
Gough; ''she's a local singer who's joining us, but just for the last
hour of the show.''
''We're appealing to a wide audience, if not necessarily a family
audience,'' says Gough. ''It's a huge entertainment romp to be enjoyed
by everybody, from botanists to philosophers to theologists to, ummm . .
. '' he glances at the giant cutlery set '' . . . to sandwich makers!''
The club nights, entitled The Secret Garden, feature fire-eaters, live
performance and jazz-funk grooves, and look set to be an even more
extreme example of the carnival ethos of Theatrum Botanicum -- who,
somewhat intriguingly, subsidise their dramatic endeavours by selling
English vodka and importing Czech and Canadian beer.
The tickets instruct clubbers to ''revel in your fantasies and dress
to tease'', says Gough. ''The important thing is that people dress as
erotically as possible,'' he stresses, laying down a kinky gauntlet to
Glasgow's trendoids.
And as I leave, a final reflection. ''Basically,'' decides Gough,
''it's about sex.'' So, that's what it's about. ''Yeah,'' he nods.
''That's what it's all about.''
* Linnaeus, Prince of Flowers at Botanic Gardens, Glasgow, 8.30pm,
today until May 14; The Secret Garden at The Arches, May 4 and 11, from
10.30pm.

DOOBIE BROTHERS tapes to the left of us, Police to the right, there we
were, stuck in the middle of an impending time warp. The feeling of
being back in the seventies was only increased by the appearance on
stage of a Joni Mitchell circa Blue lookalike, although not a
soundalike. Josie Kuhn was her name, and she has had, she told us,
boyfriend trouble for 10 years, which was about the time it took for her
to sing about it.
The odd thing about all this seventies stuff was, although Steve
Forbert emerged during the punk era (great timing for a sensitive
singer/songwriter), there's nothing seventies about his act. He may be
an old-fashioned troubadour, but he is singing about now. And he means
it.
His profile has hardly been high in recent years but his fans have
stayed with him. They know all the words from the records (to the extent
of taking mild umbrage when he updates a verse or two) and this is no
mean feat. Words tumble out in torrents in Forbert's songs; words of
wisdom, words of wit, especially words of wit.
A wholehearted performer who puts in a lot of work trying to make what
he does look effortless, he plays to the crowd as if they are pals,
leering at them mischievously as he introduces Love's A Funny State of
Mind with a snatch of Smoke Gets In Your Eyes, teasingly reminding them
that Oil is a singalong song. By the time he asked them what kind of guy
they thought he was he surely knew the answer was somewhere north of
good.

HATE to be a spoilsport, but I can't say I go a bundle on this early
Billy Connolly double bill. By rights it should be a dream combination
-- Borderline Theatre Company often has a way with big, broad, popular
comedies. It's assembled a confident, disciplined cast here, and
Connolly is the finest comedian the country has produced in a
generation.
Last night's audience laughed along appreciatively at the two
mid-seventies one-acters, directed by John Murtagh, which do indeed bear
the mark of the Big Yin's vigorous, colourful language -- with a
sprinkling of sharp one-liners to boot.
So why did I find it hard to muster so much as a snigger? It's
tempting to blame the sets (credited, tellingly, to ''Pavilion
Productions'') which are shoddy and cumbersome, or the first-half
lighting which is similarly clumsy, but the real problem is the plays
themselves. Autobiographical in nature, they are simple tales of
working-class Glaswegians coming into contact with new experiences in
the outside world -- in An' Me Wi' A Bad Leg Tae it's the Army, and in
When Hair was Long and Time was Short it's the West End hippy community.
Connolly is not short of themes (war, politics, ambition, escape) and
he even has an underlying moral message (about tolerance and
openmindedness), it's just that the one-act form doesn't allow him room
to develop these ideas.
Bad Leg is really just a sketch for a bigger play and, like the
shapeless and meandering When Hair was Long, when it works it is on the
level of sit-down chat, not stand-up drama.
As pieces of lunchtime theatre they'd be fine. As headline
entertainment they don't make the grade.

Papal-Tory plots? Stewart Lamont asks why they can't just be allowed
to have lunch
BEWILDERED is the best description of the reaction at RC archdiocesan
HQ to the fact that Cardinal Winning's lunch with Ian Lang has bothered
so many and is said to have bewitched Mr Lang.
Reverse the situation and imagine that the Secretary of State for
Scotland had not taken the opportunity to meet with the leader of
Scotland's Catholics in the year following his elevation to the College
of Cardinals. Would that have been a snub?
The fact of the matter is that a courtesy invitation to lunch, issued
a couple of months ago, has coincided with a rather curious change in
climate in both the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland and the political
parties.
The beleaguered Ian Lang would no doubt have enjoyed a wry grin at the
implication of some reports that the cardinal had come ready to do a
deal and deliver the Catholic vote to the Tories. The Tory Party in
Scotland needs all the votes it can get, but Mr Lang is a realist, and
he knows that no such thing is, or feasibly could be, on offer.
Much more likely, and more dangerous for Labour, would be an
indication of support for the SNP by the cardinal, which could influence
(but never guarantee) voting trends. Long forgotten is the incident when
the SNP president (Willie Wolfe) attacked the papal visit of 1982 and
was forced to resign.
Since then the SNP has swung more to the left politically and SNP
leader Alex Salmond was dismayed when the long-standing alliance between
working-class Catholics and Labour helped deprive his party of the
Monklands East by-election.
Since then he has played the sectarian card in reverse by openly
wooing Catholics to the SNP. His recent attack on the constitutional bar
(the 1701 Act of Settlement) which prevents a Catholic succeeding to the
British throne, follows his speech to his party's conference last year,
decrying sectarianism.
As for Labour, the party with which many Scots Catholics have found
common cause for decades (reflected in the number of councillors and MPs
who are Catholics), relations with archdiocesan HQ have been going
through a very sticky patch. Angered by Labour support for what he saw
as a pro-abortion policy, Fr Noel Barry, the Archbishop's press
secretary and editor of Flourish, fired a broadside in his newspaper
prior to the last General Election, pointing out that Catholic votes
should not be taken for granted.
The next volley was fired by the cardinal when Labour For Life, a
pro-life/anti-abortion organisation, were refused a stall at Labour's
Scottish conference on the grounds that they opposed party policy. When
Tony Blair refused to criticise this, he became a target for
archdiocesan wrath.
''He was touring the country saying we don't deserve to be elected
unless we're clear about what we believe. Yet he wouldn't say what he
believes,'' says Fr Barry.
Realising how damaging the rift had become, 44 out of the 49 Scots
Labour MPs moved to defuse the row about the ban on Labour For Life by
hiring their own stall and handing it over to the organisation.
However, that has not ended the affair. Fr Barry points out that the
re-selection process by Labour is bringing pressure to adopt women
candidates in equal numbers but with the significant proviso that they
must support ''pro-choice'' policies on abortion. ''If they said 'No
blacks', there would rightly be an outcry.''
Noel Barry is responsible for making pro-life such a high profile
issue in Scottish politics. He skilfully fields the charge that he is in
danger of one-issue politics. ''We have never seen pro-life as being
solely about abortion. Proper housing, reducing unemployment, promoting
health -- these are all part of the pro-life agenda.
''Pro-choice, on the other hand, is seen as being support for the
single option of abortion. We believe that if women are offered choice
it should be a true choice -- and money should be put into helping them
make it. Of the 4 million abortions since 1967, 90% have been for social
reasons. That figure alone should prompt re-examination of the issue by
politicians.''
Fr Barry denies that there has been a cooling in relations with Labour
MPs. ''Other parties -- Tory or Liberal -- are not pro-life in the sense
of having a policy or promising to do anything about it. We've probably
been more critical of the Government than of the Labour Party.''
Significantly, Flourish has a columnist from both SNP and Labour. But
the Labour columnist is the maverick MP George Galloway, while the SNP
one speaks ex-cathedra as leader, namely Alex Salmond.
Galloway was educated at a Catholic school. ''He approached us,'' says
Noel Barry, ''and is a good crisp writer. But I've carried pieces from
other Labour MPs.''
Is Alex Salmond a Catholic? ''I don't know,'' he confesses.
I cannot but agree with Noel Barry when he derides the idea that Tom
Winning can snap his fingers and deliver the Catholic vote to the
Monster Raving Loony Party or wherever he wills.
Neither is it credible to speak of machiavellian lunches which will
decide the future of Catholic schools and nudge newspaper editors in one
direction or another. The simple fact is that Cardinal Winning plays his
cards well, and if he can raise the stakes on issues dear to his heart,
he will consider his job well done.
If that causes a ripple in the nationalist vote, or helps to get the
Act of Settlement off the statute book, then so much the better.

The West Highland sleeper row goes to the courts on Friday, and as
Iain Wilson reports, the action will centre on a phantom rail service.
ON APRIL Fool's Day, The Herald ran a story that read like a classic
of the genre -- ScotRail planned to run midnight ''ghost trains'' over a
short stretch of track in Glasgow.
But the report was true, and on Friday its repercussion will unfold
before judges in the Court of Session.
They will be asked to rule if running empty trains on a line
constitutes a passenger service under the 1993 Railways Act.
Highland Regional Council's legal challenge is aimed at blocking
British Rail's decision, ahead of privatisation, to close the
loss-making West Highland sleeper services from May 28.
Ironically, the new late-night, one-way Maryhill to Bishopbriggs
services was allegedly created so that BR could avoid embarrassing court
action over the withdrawal of sleepers.
The only travelling public currently using the 140-yard stretch of
line between Cowlairs north and east junctions are those on the Fort
William-London sleepers.
If passenger trains are not run over the track, then that is a line
closure -- and subject to a detailed, lengthy, and far tougher
consultation procedure than for a service withdrawal.
By running the new train, British Rail could expect to avoid what
would amount to a public inquiry.
ScotRail has amended timetables to run a 23.58 Maryhill to
Bishopbriggs passenger train.
It will, in fact, merely allow people on board a train that already
exists -- albeit only as a movement of carriages to Bishopbriggs in
preparation for the morning rush hour.
Opposition MPs have condemned the new service as a ''dirty trick'' to
avoid legal action.
Herald inquiries suggest one other new passenger train, the 23.48
Cumbernauld to Glasgow Queen Street, will also miraculously appear on
May 28 as part of ScotRail's bid to demonstrate it is not in the
business of closing lines, even if sleeper services can be withdrawn.
For operational reasons, the train will run directly through the
Cowlairs chord, adding about 90 seconds to normal Cumbernauld-Glasgow
times. The chord, a 670-yard, single-track line, was opened in
September, 1993 at a cost of #2.1m -- mainly to cut Glasgow-Cumbernauld
journey times by seven minutes.
One other train will be affected from May 28. The 20.05 Inverness to
Queen Street train will be diverted via Cumbernauld and Springburn,
rather than go through Bishopbriggs and the chord.
In its Court of Session action, Highlands Regional Council alleges
BR's decision to close the West Highland sleeper service is illegal,
irrational, and unreasonable.
It also accuses BR of perpetrating a ''sham'' by planning to run
''ghost trains.'' It is alleged that by introducing the late-night, one
way services BR can claim the line is still operational and avoid a
public inquiry.
In the petition, the region accuses BR of trying to circumvent
statutory closure procedures, and says BR is attempting to achieve this
by running one train between Marhill and Bishopbriggs, departing two
minutes before midnight. There has never been any such service, and the
region argues the train is of no conceivable use or benefit to the
travelling public.
It also argues the withdrawal of the sleeper, operational since 1901,
will have a big impact on the area's economy.
ScotRail expects to be called to give evidence, and yesterday declined
to comment on grounds that the matter is sub judice.
However, insiders suggest officials will argue the only reason for
introducing new passenger services from May 28 is to ensure the line
remains open.
They will insist the stretch between Cowlairs north and east junctions
must not be closed even if sleepers are withdrawn and it is used only
for rolling stock movements and the Maryhill-Bishopbriggs train.
The same argument will apply for a 360-yard stretch used almost
exclusively by the sleeper between Cowlairs chord and Cowlairs north.
Officials will argue both stretches can be used to re-route passenger
services in and out of Glasgow when signalling faults occur at the
chord.
Management -- and ministers -- are merely concerned at preventing the
public inquiry, according to supporters of the sleepers.
If the ''ghost trains'' were not deemed a proper service, then the
Government's privatisation policies -- and their effect on the railways
-- would be laid bare at an inquiry.
MPs, councils, rail pressure groups, and users have all protested that
the consultation process for sleepers has been minimal. They are far
from satisfied with franchise director Roger Salmon's assurances that
rolling stock will be retained until after consultations on ScotRail's
passenger service requirements are concluded.
Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye
believes BR has an overwhelming moral and practical obligation to
maintain the sleepers throughout the summer consultation period.
Conservative MP Bill Walker, North Tayside, has dismissed the ''ghost
train'' as cheating of the worst kind, while the Rail Users'
Consultative Committee for Scotland has declared there is a need for
full consultations on the Anglo-Scottish sleepers' withdrawal.
Labour, on the eve of the Court of Session hearing, expects to produce
new figures that show the Fort William-London sleepers lose only a
fraction of what BR and ministers have claimed.

SCOTTISH businesses lose #450m a year through illness and accidents at
work, a conference in Glasgow was told yesterday at the launch of a
Health and Safety Executive campaign.
About 200 delegates from firms across Scotland also heard that an
estimated 1.3 million working days are lost through occupational ill
health while a further 2.6 million days are lost through workplace
accidents.
The figures were disclosed at the launch of the HSE's ''Good Health is
Good Business'' campaign, which aims to persuade employers to take
action to ensure that health risks are properly managed.
The launch came the day after a report by the National Asthma Campaign
attacked employers for not taking occupational asthma seriously. It
claimed that thousands of people were needlessly exposed to the risk of
asthma at work and that there were seven million asthma-related lost
working days in the UK each year.
The clear message to business leaders at yesterday's conference from
Mr David Mattey, the HSE's field operations director in Scotland, was:
''Treat the management of health just as you do the management of
finance and people will stop being made ill by their work.''
He added: ''Every year approximately 75,000 workers in Scotland suffer
from ill health caused or made worse by their work. Every year more
people become ill as a result of their work than are killed or injured
in industrial accidents.
''Everything from too much noise at work, to breathing in or handling
chemicals, manual handling, and vibration can make staff ill.''
Mr Mattey's comments were supported by Mr Jim Hosea, chief executive
of Scottish Pride, and Professor Anthony Seaton, head of the Department
of Environmental and Occupational Health at Aberdeen University.
A 43-year-old mother of two, who contracted asthma only weeks after
starting work for a cleaning company and was later sacked by her
employer for being too ill to work, was among those who attended the
conference.
HSE officials were called in to give the company advice following the
incident.
The first stage of the HSE's campaign, which will run for four years,
will look at ways of assisting employers to prevent life-threatening
illnesses in the workplace such as asthma and conditions such as
deafness and crippling back injuries.

The VE Day celebrations provide an opportunity to remember the human
vices and virtues displayed during the war, and for those who have
enjoyed 50 years of relative peace, a chance to count blessings, says
Steve Bruce
AN Army-issue tin box sits under my desk. In it are a Union Jack, two
rows of eight medals (full size and dress miniatures), a set of field
maps of the North-West frontier, a card of instructions for the
behaviour of troops going ashore in Cape Town, guides to Celle and
Hanover, an Army service record book, and a variety of shoulder badges,
some American and Canadian, the rest British.
None of the medals is valuable. They are only the campaign honours
given to all the men who fought in India, North Africa, and Europe and
who served a long time. They are commonplace.
I am lucky enough to have been born in peace. I think I can remember
rationing, but that is only because rationing went on for a long time
after the war and I am not sure what it was that was still in short
supply in the mid-1950s. Perhaps all I remember is my mother talking
about rationing.
I grew up with utility furniture and pre-fabricated houses. Though I
missed it, the war still means something to me because it meant
something to my father. As it did for millions of others, it defined his
adult life. It even provided him with a wife. He met my mother, a
displaced Bulgarian, in Germany in 1946. The war changed her life more
than his. When it was over he returned to his own country. It was 20
years before she was allowed to visit her homeland.
A celebration of victory 50 years on is too late for my parents, too
late for most of those who secured that victory. Fewer than one in six
of us was alive in 1945, and VE Day is as remote from my children as the
Battle of the Somme was from me. Perhaps more remote, if one allows that
the pace of social change has accelerated.
There is a further reason for the remoteness of VE Day for which we
should all give thanks. We were let off our war. The first generation of
this century had the 1914-18 war. Just the lifetime of a young adult
later, the world again went to war.
But the Suez crisis came to nothing and the Korean War hardly involved
us. The Americans had Vietnam and we have had the Falklands and Northern
Ireland, but the destructive power of nuclear weapons and the global
intertwining of all our economies has allowed British civilians 50 years
of peace and security.
If the celebration of VE Day is to be more than just an opportunity
for the advertisers of consumer products to overdose on John Major's
nostalgia for warm beer, Bisto, Brylcreem, and village green cricket,
what messages can it convey to those who were not there?
The first moral I would draw is that Western Europeans are capable of
horror. It is not just in the Balkans, the Middle East, Asia and in dark
Africa that civilians are slaughtered. The Second World War was a
necessary response to a regime which thought it reasonable to eradicate
whole peoples and which deliberately murdered over six million Jews.
VE Day can teach us other badly-needed lessons. Our spirits can be
lifted by the many tales of heroism, but it is perhaps more important to
contemplate the character shown by those millions of ordinary people who
volunteered to fight for a just cause or who stoically, and often
cheerfully, contributed to the war effort on the home front. They dug
for victory. They followed long working days with night patrols in the
Home Guard. They watched for fires from the roofs of London office
blocks.
Along with sacrifice went resourcefulness. The mass mobilisation of
the civilian population forced almost everyone into social roles for
which they were completely unprepared. Working-class girls had to
confront the masculine work cultures of the factory and the farm.
Middle-class women, trained to manage servants and cultivate the arts,
had to earn a living.
Deprived of the comfort of stable communities and families, kept
constantly on edge by the fear of the official envelope ''regretting to
inform you'', and thrown into unfamiliar society, most people got on
with their lives and many flourished. To read of what ordinary people
did between 1939 and 1945 should make us ashamed that in our culture,
personal development means merely self-regarding narcissism.
Of course there was selfishness and pettiness and snobbery and
corruption. Spivs created a flourishing black market in rationed goods.
Genteel country folk recoiled from the head lice of slum evacuees.
Factory workers sabotaged industrial production. But there was enough of
a consensus against behaving badly that those who did so kept low.
Rather than watch them answer questions from a Commons select
committee, I would like to hear the directors and senior managers of our
privatised utilities reading aloud from the war-time diaries of ordinary
people.
A further lesson from the war may sound like political point-scoring,
but it transcends the fate of parties.
No institution stands in greater need of rehabilitation than the
state. Since 1979, we have been governed by a party which believes that
the greatest happiness of the greatest number will be created by
individuals exercising free choice in a free market.
Home ownership, multi-channel satellite TV, private medical insurance,
privately-funded education, opt-out pensions; these were the milestones
on the road to liberation from the grey and stagnant world of the
overbearing state.
Had we embraced such anti-statist attitudes in 1939, we would all be
speaking German now.
The greatest achievement of the war and the one that we should now be
celebrating was the social equivalent of Isaiah's prophecy that ''they
shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning
hooks''. Once it was clear that the Allies would win the war, our
political leaders turned their imaginations to the peace.
Beveridge's plan for a social security system funded by national
insurance, a national health service funded by direct taxation, a
centrally co-ordinated national education system, an unprecedented house
building programme, regional economic development schemes; for all that
they fell short of their magnificent ambitions, these products of
central planning vastly improved our worlds.
Selflessness and resourcefulness are qualities of the individual, but
in 1945 no-one doubted that the state had a responsibility to use the
powers that it, and only it, has to create a climate which encourages
those virtues by rewarding them.
Its citizens should expect two things of the state: security and
prosperity. VE Day should be celebrated as the fulfilment of the first
obligation and the promise of the second.

PIRATE radio station transmissions are interfering with vital
emergency services communications putting lives at risk, it has been
claimed.
The Government's radio watchdog, the Radiocommunications Agency, told
radio users in Glasgow yesterday, that thousands of cellphone users and
radio amateurs, as well as pirates, were transmitting on frequencies
used by the police, ambulance service and aircraft.
Agency investigators warned that those clogging up wavebands could
face prosecution and imprisonment. According to the agency's chief
executive, Mr Jim Norton, the number of raids on pirate radio stations
is on the increase with pirate radio equipment seized in a series of
raids in Edinburgh and Glasgow last year.
Mr Norton added that the agency was currently in the process of
drafting guidelines to be included in a Government White Paper on those
wanting to use the finite number of wavebands.
''There has been a massive expansion in the number of people using
radio communications in the UK, in what has become a multi-million pound
business affecting thousands of jobs. We are looking at ways of making
the best use of the radio spectrum because the demand is enormous.''
He said the agency's Scottish offices could give advice on how to
operate without hampering rescue services.

The Tories face a mid-term collapse at the local elections south of
the Border tomorrow. Malcolm Dickson argues that the results will be a
crucial test for new Labour while Stuart Trotter says the fallout will
determine John Major's future
RUMOURS of a possible meltdown south of the Border are rife. The
Conservatives' problem is quite clear: they are campaigning against a
background of an expected 25% lead for Tony Blair's new Labour Party.
This estimate is based on adjustments made to the raw opinion poll
figures that may overestimate Labour's share of the vote.
The most recent polls put the unadjusted lead at anything up to 34%,
with Labour on 57% and the Tories on only 23%. The seriousness of this
position is underlined by looking at the most recent national vote share
comparisons in other local elections during 1993 and 1994. In 1994, the
Tories did very badly with record losses -- yet Labour's lead was 15%.
In 1993, the Conservatives were left in control of only one county
council in England, Buckinghamshire, and Labour's lead was even less, at
only 10%.
From all the recent indicators, even allowing a measure of adjustment
in their favour, the Tories face yet another mid-term electoral collapse
tomorrow.
This election may, however, be far more significant in what it might
tell us about the main parties' prospects for the next General Election.
Tomorrow's elections are the first to be held right across England since
Tony Blair became the Labour leader last summer.
It is, therefore, important to look at these elections not just as a
gauge of the extent of the Tories' difficulties, but also as a crucial
test of new Labour's potential for winning a General Election. If Labour
fails to live up to its opinion poll ratings, then questions may be
asked yet again of its ability to deliver that ''one last heave'' to
capture power in Westminster.
Additionally, given Blair's commitment to further reform in his party
after his victory over Clause 4, any vote share less than about 50%
might put a question mark over the timing of his modernisation crusade.
The problem for the Tories, meanwhile, is that the majority of the 70
councils they are defending are those where all seats are being fought.
That is bad news for John Major, because it is much harder to defend
these councils against their poor opinion poll showings.
If we assume that Labour's lead is about 25% then the swing from
Conservative to Labour since 1991, when these seats were last fought, is
about 12%. (In 1991 John Major was still enjoying the honeymoon period
after his election as Tory leader late in 1990, and the Tories were only
one per cent behind Labour.)
Such a swing would result in dramatic losses for the Conservatives of
upwards of 2000 seats out of the 4000 they are defending. Labour, in
contrast, could expect gains of about 2500 seats, whereas the Liberal
Democrats may actually make net losses of about 200.
The Liberal Democrats' raw opinion poll rating of 16% may move upwards
to around 20% if previous local election performances -- where they have
outstripped their poll expectations -- are repeated. That would easily
see them hold on to the 1950 councillors they already have and possibly
increase that number.
With 40 councils already controlled by the Liberal Democrats, Paddy
Ashdown's party seem almost certain to replace the Tories as the second
party in terms of the number of councils held and may even have a larger
number of councillors as well.
The Tories may end up controlling a meagre dozen or so councils on
this basis. While this is, of course, short of the whitewash experienced
in Scotland, it would, including their four London burghs and one
county, leave the Tories with only about 20 councils in total in the
whole of Britain.
This puts at risk Middle England in a way never seen before. With even
a performance only half as bad as predicted, the Tories would lose the
cathedral cities of Salisbury and Lichfield.
If, however, tomorrow delivers the Tories' lowest vote share in living
memory, then at risk are the heartlands of Sussex at Hove and Horsham.
This would also see Labour sweep into power in Dover, South Ribble,
Portsmouth, Cambridge, and Exeter. Only the councils closest to home for
the Cabinet are likely to survive, including John Major's doorstep of
Huntingdon.
The Conservatives face a huge struggle to gain popular support before
the next General Election. Already party morale is at a dangerously low
ebb. After tomorrow, it may disappear altogether. The Prime Minister
simply cannot sustain loss after loss in local, European and
by-elections in the manner in which his party has done without any
damage to his own position.
It seems clear that further large losses will mean some back benchers
will become convinced that the Tories cannot win the next General
Election with John Major as leader.
Last month's Scottish elections led to open calls for the Scottish
Tory chairman, Sir Michael Hirst, to resign and indeed for Michael
Forsyth to replace Ian Lang as Scottish Secretary. If the Conservatives
do lose as many as 2000 seats, then John Major will also feel the heat
as never before.

A CALL for foresters to be given enough freedom from Government red
tape to run their businesses profitably was made yesterday by Mr Mark
Crichton Maitland, the new chairman of the Timber Growers Association.
He said at the TGA's annual general meeting in Edinburgh that the new
rural White Paper initiatives gave the industry an opportunity to make
the case for commercial forestry.
''We must not lose sight,'' Mr Crichton Maitland said, ''of the
importance of ensuring that foresters are able to run profitable
forestry businesses, otherwise the money simply will not be there to
take into account environmental considerations.''
Mr Crichton Maitland grows 1000 acres of commercial and mixed
woodlands on his own estate in central Scotland and operates a
consultancy business in England and Wales.
Sir Peter Hutchison, chairman of the Forestry Commission, said Britain
had doubled its area of forests and woodlands since 1919, and was one of
the few countries in the world with the prospect of an increasing supply
of timber.

THE local elections in England and Wales tomorrow have the potential
to topple a Prime Minister and make an impact on the national scene far
greater than the simple exchange of council seats.
The Conservatives officially decline to talk numbers. ''We are not in
the business of predictions,'' says party chairman Jeremy Hanley --
predictably, because every estimate by friend and foe suggests that the
Tories are in for a hiding.
While Mr Hanley refused to predict, other Tory sources dropped hints
that they expected to lose about 1000 of the 4000 seats they are
defending. Independent analysis by the BBC research unit and others
suggested that on the form shown in local by-elections it could be as
bad as 1500.
It is an indication of Tory fears that some of their MPs are now
saying that up to 1500, though bad, would be explainable. Labour, who
already hold more council seats nationally than the Tories, are cautious
in their estimate of Conservative losses to themselves and the Liberal
Democrats.
Both seem to have settled on about the same figures for public
consumption. The Tories will swallow hard if losses come in under 1500
and say it was not so bad. Labour are publicly estimating Conservative
losses in the 1000 to 1300 area. In fact, Labour are hoping for, and the
Tories fearing, a lot more.
A Mori poll for the Guardian last week gave Labour 55%, the
Conservatives 22% (exactly double what they managed in Scotland), and
the Liberal Democrats 18%. Labour are quick to say they don't expect to
do as well as their poll support. They didn't in Scotland, but the
relatively low turnout would explain that. The Liberal Democrats point
out that they usually pull in more votes than their poll ratings
indicate.
The Conservative nightmare is losing 2000 seats, half of all those
being defended. That would send shock waves through the party, create
large numbers of disgruntled ex-councillors who are also big wheels in
their local parties, and turn their thoughts and those of Tory MPs to
whether Mr Major is the man to pull the party out of its tailspin or
even land the plane with a reasonable number of the passengers intact.
Even if it is that bad, there is no immediate mechanism for the party
to do anything about it. A leadership election can only be called in the
period immediately after the opening of a new session of Parliament. Mr
Major is not a man to fall on his sword. He thinks he can still win in
1996 or 1997.
If the executive of the 1922 Committee, representing all Tory back
benchers, were to ask him to go and if the Cabinet turned against him
then he would have to go. But the Cabinet are likely to be divided and
the 1922 Committee may bide its time until the autumn, waiting to see if
Labour's opinion poll lead remains as big. If it does, the parliamentary
party could strike then.
By that time, many Tory MPs with majorities in the 5000 to 10,000 area
will be more worried about their personal future than the party's and
will be wondering if a new leader could save them even if he could not
prevent Mr Blair winning. Step forward, Mr Michael Heseltine.
Some surveys suggest that the Tories might just be able to repeat
their Euro-election performance when, though doing badly, they avoided
total rout.
In about half of the English districts only a third of the council
seats are being contested. Labour and the Liberal Democrats both hope
that in areas which currently have a hung council they will be able to
take sole control where they are only the largest party in a coalition.
Apart from the Government's unpopularity, another interesting factor
is militating against the Tories making much headway in regaining
councils they lost in 1991. Many of the new Labour administrations have
been faithfully following the Blair line, controlling spending, avoiding
big council tax increases even, as in Blackpool, funding improved
services through charges in the best Tory style.
In Wales, the Tories may emulate their Scottish counterparts by
returning fewer than 100 councillors out of, in this case, 1273 seats.
The Liberal Democrats claim not to be nervous about being submerged as
many former Tory voters and a good proportion of their own switch to
Labour. They will be helped by the fact that they now have a firm power
base in many areas. There will be a few significant Lib-Lab duels in
towns like Sheffield and Southampton.
The Lib Dems say Labour will be disappointed if they fail to gain 1400
seats. Labour refuse to be drawn but if they do gain that many, mostly
from the Tories, and the Lib Dems hit the Conservatives as well, then
Ministers will be looking at the national disaster they dread.

A TAPE recording of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards playing in a jam
session at home more than 30 years ago could fetch up to #55,000 at a
London auction later this month.
The reel-to-reel recording lasts 31 minutes and contains 13 songs
taped in 1961 by a classmate of Jagger's from Dartford Grammar School.
Auctioneers Christie's said yesterday that the recording is one of the
earliest known collaborations between Jagger and Richards before they
formed the Rolling Stones.
It was found by one of Jagger's school friends -- who wishes to remain
anonymous -- last year in a cupboard when his daughter became an avid
Stones fan.
A Christie's spokeswoman said: ''This recording is incredibly rare. It
is Jagger and Richards together before the Stones formed.
''Apparently they began to like the sounds they were making and
Jagger's school friend offered to record a session on his parents' tape
recorder.
''The Rolling Stones offices know about the auction and we believe
they are quite interested.''
Experts predict the recording will fetch between #45,000 and #55,000.
Copyright is being kept by the owner.
Second guitarist in the jam session was almost certainly Dick Taylor,
founder of the Pretty Things and an early Stones member.
Other musicians are Allen Etherington and Bob Beckwith, Dartford
Grammar School classmates. Together they played under the name Little
Boy Blue and the Blue Boys.
Chuck Berry covers dominate the recording, but there are also versions
of Elvis Presley's favourite You're Right, I'm Left, She's Gone and
Ritchie Valen's La Bamba.

A MOTORIST being sued for #500,000 claimed the youth who suffered
severe brain injuries after being struck by his car was part of a
stone-throwing mob who attacked him.
Mrs Sandra Gilmour, who is suing driver Mr Brian Wynn on behalf of her
son Richard Gilmour, now aged 24, denied the allegation at the Court of
Session in Edinburgh yesterday.
The damages action is being heard by Lord Gill and, at the end of Mrs
Gilmour's evidence yesterday, the judge told her: ''Whatever the
outcome, I want you to know you have the sympathy of the court.''
Mrs Gilmour, 43, of Brannock Place, Newarthill, Lanarkshire, claimed
that on June 2, 1990, a group of youths, including her son who was 19 at
the time, were told that boys were driving from Holytown looking for
trouble.
She said that Richard was following some friends along Glenburn Road
in Newarthill, when a Lada Samara driven by Mr Wynn appeared, being
driven at speed and swerving dangerously across the road.
She admitted that some of the boys in front of her son began throwing
sticks and stones at the car because of Mr Wynn's ''provocative
behaviour'', but claimed that suddenly, and without warning, the car
mounted the pavement and struck Richard, throwing him into the air.
Mrs Gilmour also claimed that earlier that evening, Mr Wynn had driven
up and down Glenburn Road with some friends, and the sole reason for him
being there was to cause trouble with local youths.
As a result of the incident, her son suffered a serious head injury
resulting in permanent brain damage. He will need constant care for the
rest of his life.
Mrs Gilmour told the court that her son was injured close to her home
and, when her daughter told her what had happened, she ran to the scene.
''People were all around Ricky. I asked them to move back and I knelt
down beside him. He couldn't move. He was on the grass, eight or nine
feet away from the pavement.''
She admitted that her son, who was keen on weight training and liked
to keep fit, belonged to a group called the Newarthill Posse, but denied
that it was a gang. She described them as just a group of friends.
She also denied knowing of any feud between the Posse and boys from
Holytown.
Mr Wynn, who denies liability for Mr Gilmour's injuries, said that on
the night of the incident he was driving two girls from Holytown to
their homes in Cleland and Carfin.
He said he took a wrong turning in Newarthill and drove into Glenburn
Road, where a mob of youths began throwing bricks, pieces of metal,
bottles, and sticks at the car. He could not reverse or turn because the
road was a cul de sac.
Windows were broken, the headlights smashed, the wing mirrror was
ripped off, and the bodywork of the car was dented.
He said he swerved and managed to get past some of the youths, but
then suddenly saw Richard Gilmour partly on the road and partly on the
pavement. He was holding a brick which he threw at the car, bouncing off
the bonnet and smashing into the windscreen.
He claimed that he was unable to take evasive action and the car
struck Mr Gilmour.
Mr Wynn said that he stopped the car to see what had happened to the
youth, but when the mob ran towards the car he drove off and reported
the incident at a police station.
He said that police sent a report to the procurator-fiscal, who
decided to take no action against him.
Mr Wynn also said that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board
refused to make an award over the injuries that Mr Gilmour suffered.
The hearing continues and Lord Gill is expected to issue a judgment in
writing later.

Elizabeth Buie examines oil industry plans to dump giant oil
installations off the west coast of Scotland, and the campaign by
environmentalists to highlight the dangers
IN ESSENCE, the battle over the decommissioning of the Brent Spar oil
installation in deep water centres on just how negligible is
''negligible environmental impact'', and should we take the risk in the
first place?
In its decision to dump the redundant Brent Spar installation in deep
waters off the west coast, Shell Expro says its research showed this to
be the safest option, and one that will have only ''negligible
environmental impact''. It also has Government approval.
The United Kingdom Offshore Association says its members base their
decommissioning decisions on three criteria -- safety, environmental
protection, and cost-effectiveness.
What concerns environmental pressure groups is that cost
considerations may be outweighing concerns for the environment,
especially as 20 years ago, when the oil industry was getting into its
stride in the North Sea, the Government and the oil industry promised to
remove all installations when they had reached the end of their natural
life. They argue that if the US can insist that all installations in the
Gulf of Mexico are decommissioned onshore, then so can the UK.
Earlier this year, Energy Minister Tim Eggar gave the go-ahead to
Shell to abandon the Brent Spar at sea. He said that the abandonment of
offshore installations and pipelines represented a large and costly
exercise both for the operator and the Exchequer, and it was vitally
important to get it right. He added that cost savings by the industry
had played a significant part in postponing inevitable decisions to
abandon installations, but the day had to come.
The Brent Spar may be the first installation to get the deep-water
disposal go-ahead -- other decommissioned rigs have been in shallower
waters and, to date, easier to dismantle onshore -- but it is unlikely
to be the last.
Mr Andrew Searle, spokesman for UKOA, said that around 75% of the 200
UK installations in the North Sea would almost certainly be removed and
broken up onshore in the next 10 years. However, what of the 25%
remaining?
''We are only talking about giant concrete and giant steel structures
which can either be left in place or partially toppled. There is an
enormous risk to safety with these giant structures of 300,000 tonnes.
It is difficult to believe there is any other option than deep-water
disposal. We have to make sure they are marked on all maps,'' he said.
The decommissioning of 50 installations over the next decade was
likely to cost about #1.5bn, said Mr Searle.
''As you get closer to the end of productive life you have to decide
what is the most cost-effective, safe, and environmentally friendly
option. Money invested in decommissioning is money not available for new
fields and creating new jobs,'' he added. Shell did look at the option
of scrapping the Brent Spar onshore. The company concluded that ''this
option poses a higher level of technical complexity and risk to health,
safety and the environment.''
''Preparing the Spar for removal at sea, and transporting it to shore
for scrapping, would involve some 19 marine and land operations. These
would include repairing some damage to storage tanks at sea, rotating
the Spar to horizontal, towing to a sheltered near-shore site and
loading it on to a submersible cargo vessel, offloading, dismantling the
structure, and disposing of the waste material.
''Onshore scrapping would require some 360,000 man-hours of work. The
complexity and labour-intensive nature of the operations means that they
would be very costly and expose personnel to greater risk.''
On the other hand: ''Sinking the Brent Spar at a deep-water location
would have minimal impact on the environment. Studies commissioned by
Shell UK suggest this option is much less complicated than onshore
scrapping. It involves seven, less difficult, operations requiring
approximately 52,000 man hours of work.
''The site of the sinking is likely to be in water over 2000m deep and
more than 240km from land. There is little marine life on the seabed at
such a depth. Any contaminants from the Spar would be rapidly diluted
and have an insignificant impact limited to a few hundred metres from
the buoy. The naturally-occurring radioactive salts in the sludge and
scale would have little impact on the deep-sea environment.''
Shell says the Brent Spar's contents include about 100 tonnes of
residual sludge, about 30 tonnes of low specific-activity scale (which,
the company says, has the same amount of naturally-occurring
radioactivity as a medium-size street of granite buildings in Aberdeen)
and small amounts of heavy metals.
Nevertheless, its own impact hypothesis states: ''It is unlikely that
elevated sediment hydrocarbons would be detectable much beyond 500m of
the structure. Detectable effects on benthic communities would be
expected within the immediate vicinity of the structure, probably within
150-250m. These would probably be manifested by a gradual reduction in
species diversity and appearance of more opportunistic species.''
Greenpeace's language is more colourful. It describes the Spar's
contents as a ''cocktail'' of persistent and bio-accumulative chemicals
that are ''a serious threat to the marine environment''.
It claims that the dumping of the Brent Spar will release
organochlorines such as PCBs which have been found accumulated in marine
wildlife, including whales.
Toxics campaigner for Greenpeace, Madeleine Cobbing, said: ''These
PCBs are used as insulation in electrical equipment and are extremely
toxic. There are supposed to be only trace elements, but if they get
into marine organisms they send out all sorts of signals to the body and
sometimes behave like hormones. We cannot predict what they are going to
do.''
While it is impossible to identify definitively the source of
chemicals found in marine life, Greenpeace points to a sperm whale found
on a Belgian beach which had such high levels of chemicals in its
blubber that the authorities declared it ''toxic waste''.
Dr Sian Pullen, marine conservation officer for the World Wide Fund
for Nature UK, has, on behalf of the Wildlife and Countryside Link's Oil
and Gas Consortium, written to the Scottish Secretary urging the
greatest of caution.
''We believe that this case must not be considered in isolation, that
there needs to be a strategy for the decommissioning of all existing oil
and gas installations and that before any new development is considered,
a full 'cradle to grave' analysis of all aspects of the development,
including the decommissioning of installations, must be undertaken.
Indeed, a decision to dump this structure in this manner will set a
precedent for the future with unfortunate consequences for the marine
environment,'' she wrote.
Dr Pullen also claimed that Shell's decision had been taken on the
basis of ''inadequate technical information and inadequate consideration
of all possible options'', and that the company's ability to select the
''best practical environmental option in a balanced and meaningful
manner'' was, therefore, questionable.
She urged caution in assessing claims that there is little marine life
on the sea-bed.
''If you look at work carried out on the eastern seaboard of the US,
the highest diversity of marine life is between 1000m to 2000m depth of
water. We know very little about deep waters. At the same time as we get
fisheries people considering targeting new fisheries in deeper oceans
and we see more exploitation of mineral deposits in these very areas,''
she said.
In other parts of the world, marine life which should never have come
in contact with chemicals had done so because of water currents, Dr
Pullen warned.
From the fishermen's point of view, Mr Michael Sutherland, offshore
liaison executive for the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, condemned
both the oil industry and Government.
''Since oil arrived in our backyard in the 1970s, we hoped and
expected to see all oil structures removed when they came to the end of
their lives. When we first talked about the oil installations the
companies said they would be here now and gone tomorrow. We got the same
promises from the Government, but the goalposts have begun to shift,''
he said.
''From total removal it has gone to partial removal -- obviously it
does not fill us with joy.''
Fishermen's concerns centre on the problems of snagging, damage to
equipment, and danger to personnel. But they too are concerned about the
effects on marine life.

From its outset the twinset has created contrasting images and, as
Francesca Fearon reports, its good-girl bad-girl characteristics live on
in the nineties
IF YOU recall that Joanna Woodward classic, The Three Faces of Eve, it
is possible to identify those same schizophrenic tendencies in this
season's favourite look, the twinset. This little knitted woolly combo
has extraordinary chameleon characteristics. You can almost visualise
the mood swings -- one minute the mouse, quiet and introspective, and
the next, gregarious and fun-loving.
This is how the history of the twinset is charted. From its early
incarnation in the 1920s as a practical look for women golfers, the
twinset has created contrasting images over the years. There is the
demure, bookish look; the formidable country life charity fund-raiser
type (think Vivienne Westwood), invariably accompanied by a string of
pearls and a tweed skirt; and at the opposite end of the spectrum, the
sexy glamour-puss look.
This spring's flirtation with retromania toyed with two of these
images, while the county ma'am was left at the WI until the autumn
collections. On the catwalk Versace gave knits glamour appeal with
gingham or lacquered stretch pencil skirts and high heels, circa 1950s.
So did Anna Molinari, adding a taffeta skirt to her glittery version,
and Gucci, teaming a floral satin dirndl skirt or capri pants with
crimson cashmere twinsets. Infact, the overall effect hovers close to
the original sweater-girl look.
Of course the first sweater girl was Lana Turner, who starred in those
1940s teenager movies, sipping soda pop in her skintight sweater. She
was followed by the dizzy blonde glamour puss Jayne Mansfield, who made
the most of her generous bosom with those early torpedo bras.
Maidenform, with the conical-style California, and later the Playtex
cross-your-heart brassiers produced the same pointy shape under knitwear
which Madonna brandished on stage in the late 1980s with the help of
Gaultier and Dolce &amp; Gabbana corsets.
Arising from the silver-screen clean-up campaign in the 1920s, this
voluptuous sweater-girl look was the closest the restrictive Hayes Code
allowed Hollywood movie directors to get to anything remotely
provocative on celluloid. In fact, at this point the taut twinset came
close to identifying the good-time girl.
Needless to say, the look was picked up by the teenage rock'n'rollers
who wore tight twinsets (cardigans knotted around their necks) with
dirndls or prom skirts and little ankle socks, another catwalk favourite
this season with Gucci and Sportmax. The beat generation adopted the
look, wearing the knits either with prom skirts, covering crackling
petticoats, or slim capri pants.
Over in Paris the Existentialists were similarly attired in tight
jumpers and cardigans with dirndls or pencil skirts. The group's
perpetrator of style, Juliette Greco, was rarely without her black
polo-neck, black trousers, and heavy black eyeliner.
On the one hand twinsets were the epitome of sensuality and
rebelliousness, and on the other they looked demure, even regal. Of
course the Queen is known for her twinsets, so was Grace Kelly. On the
catwalk, Prada, Isaac Mizrahi, and Calvin Klein all opted for a simple,
demure Grace Kelly style. Prada contrasted a shrunken black chenille
twinset with a cream satin skating skirt. Mizrahi and Klein bleached it
summer white and Donna Karan at DKNY made it slightly sporty, with
stripes or cable stitching. Ralph Lauren, meanwhile, chose Kelly's
contemporary as his muse. The Mary Tyler Moore-look was achieved by
slipping the cardigan over the shoulders and fastening the top button.
Classic twinsets and saucy shrunken versions are being swiftly snapped
up from the stores. There are the prettily-coloured sea-island cotton
styles from John Smedley, the powdery pastels in cashmere from Scottish
designer Belinda Robertson and in lambswood from Pringle. The original
twinset is a Pringle invention.
Oasis has captured the Kelly look with twinsets using the fifties
turtleneck-style sweater with a silver, satinised dirndl skirt. Kookai,
French Connection, Top Shop, and Jigsaw all produced fluffy soft styles
in mohair for last winter and this spring translated the look into silky
viscose and angora to wear with satin or gingham skirts, flashing a
generous view of the midriff. Proving those good-girl bad-girl
characteristics live on in the nineties.

AN inquiry was in progress last night after three prisoners escaped
from a van taking them to jail by simply opening an emergency hatch in
the roof.
After it was disclosed that no detention officer was in the van with
the men when they made their getaway in the centre of Middlesbrough,
Cleveland, a senior police officer admitted there had been ''possibly
human error''.
Andrew O'Donnell, 18, John Reid, 20, and Paul Hampson, 29, went
through the roof literally as the van was held up at a junction just 100
yards from Teeside magistrates court on Monday afternoon.
Yesterday O'Donnell, who faces a burglary charge, was recaptured and
police were continuing to hunt the other two.

A #35m plan to revive the economy of the Highlands has failed to
materialise.
Last year experts predicted 750 new hi-tech jobs with the creation of
a major facility for maintaining large jets at Dalcross Airport, near
Inverness.
The prediction came after the loss of more than 4000 skilled
engineering jobs at two oil-platform yards.
However, a year-long study has revealed that ''all the conditions are
not yet suitable'' for the development, it was reported yesterday.
The investigation was paid for by Highlands and Islands Enterprise,
Inverness and Nairn Enterprise and the Highlands and Islands Airport,
which operates Dalcross.
The survey of the world market showed that there is over-capacity in
heavy maintenance facilities, with a slower rate of growth than
expected.

A COMPANY director who carried out a #425,000 photocopier fraud which
cost Scots workers their jobs was jailed for five years yesterday.
Temporary judge John Horsburgh, QC, told Ian Geddes, formerly a
director with Northern Office Technology (Highlands): ''From the account
which has been given, it would appear that others in your company have
been involved in the scheme which I take it was of your devising.
''One unfortunate consequence has been the downfall of another
company, Pallas (Scotland) Ltd.''
Geddes, a first offender, of Braeside Park, Balloch, Inverness,
admitted that while a director of Northern Office Technology (NOT) he
defrauded Contract Services (Rentals) Ltd of #425,500.
The fraud against the company, based in George Street, Edinburgh, was
carried out on September 14, 1990.
Mr William Totten, Advocate-depute, told the High Court in Edinburgh
that the offence was a complicated one which had required substantial
investigation.
The mainstay of Geddes's business was to supply photocopiers. NOT,
based in Harbour Road, Inverness, sold photocopiers to a leasing firm
which leased them to the user. Under the deal, NOT carried out
maintenance work for which it was paid by the leasing company.
Orkney Islands Council was one of the customers supplied under this
arrangement, but by 1990 the council was unhappy with some aspects of
the deal.
Geddes suggested that the problems could be solved by a fresh leasing
arrangement being drawn up and the council assumed it could be with the
same company.
However, Geddes approached a rival firm, Contract Services (Rentals),
a subsidiary of Pallas (Scotland), and suggested it take over the lease
after the existing one was settled.
He produced documents on which signatures had been forged, including
that of Mr Rowan McCallum, Orkney Islands Council's director of
administration and legal services.
The forgeries made it appear as if the old agreement had been settled
in full, all outstanding money paid to the existing leasing company, and
that Contract Services now owned the 61 copiers supplied to the council.
In fact, the previous lease had not been settled and Contract Services
had no title to the equipment.
The #425,500 handed over by Contract Services to take over the copiers
was kept by NOT, which was already in financial trouble, and used to
keep the ailing firm afloat for another three months. The firm still had
substantial debts and, in December 1990, receivers were finally called
in.
Mr Totten said there was no evidence that Geddes had made any personal
gain, but the fact remained that Pallas's parent company in England lost
#425,500.
The burden of the debt was so great that it led to Pallas having to
close down its Scottish operation with the loss of a number of jobs.

GLASGOW'S arts chief has dismissed an alternative plan to a new
Scottish gallery of art in the city as short-sighted.
Museums and galleries director Mr Julian Spalding said yesterday that
he intended to write to the Duke of Sutherland, the Duke of Buccleuch
and distinguished art world figures over their scheme to lend works of
art to galleries around the country rather than see them concentrated in
a Glasgow gallery.
The plan proposes lending groups of painting for a minimum of two
years to galleries in Inverness, Dundee, Kilmarnock, Perth, and
Kirkcaldy.
But a furious Mr Spalding told The Herald that he strongly disagreed
with the proposal. He said Scotland needed one gallery of Scottish art,
architecture and design along the lines of national galleries in
countries like Denmark.
''Scotland has a very distinct national school. People need a gallery
where they can see the history of Scottish art and design. Galleries
across Scotland already have wonderful things which they are displaying
at the moment, and don't necessarily have space to show works from the
national collection. I intend to write to the signatories. It is very
short-sighted idea.''
The signatories, who include two former galleries trustees, have
floated their proposal just weeks before the present trustees are set to
submit their finalised plan for a gallery of art in Glasgow.

THE Accounts Commission yesterday played down the idea of councils as
winners or losers as it published the first comparative league tables
showing how different Scottish local authorities match up on service
provision.
It had not been its aim ''to rub anyone's nose in the sand'', but to
start a constructive dialogue to improve service provision, commission
chairman Professor Ian Percy said.
The Scottish Consumer Council, however, hailed the initiative as ''an
important step along the road to open government''.
For too long, said SCC chairwoman Deirdre Hutton, details about local
council performance had been a well-kept secret. She believed that
providers and users of the services would benefit from this valuable
information.
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities was a little more
cautious, warning that the commission's publication should not be used
as a means to judge one council's level of service against another.
Cosla's Labour president, Ms Rosemary McKenna, said the figures
provided councils with a splendid opportunity to examine how they
provided services, and how to move that provision forward.
Senior police sources have expressed misgivings over the performance
comparison tables, saying that despite the commission's caveat that it
was not publishing league tables, that is precisely what it has done.
One senior officer told The Herald: ''It is fundamentally wrong to
hold up these figures for comparison because you are not comparing like
with like.''
However, Mr Ian McLellan, director of local government studies at the
commission, was unrepentant, he said: ''The message to members of the
public is that if they are interested in the disparity in performance
between their force and another force they should make an inquiry to the
local chief constable and ask him to explain it.''
At a press conference in Edinburgh to launch the 138-page publication,
Performance Information for Scottish Councils 1993-94, Professor Percy
insisted the commission was neither providing league tables nor
identifying individual councils as good or bad performers.
But the report, which will be published annually, is intended to help
local citizens, as well as councillors and senior council officials,
make useful comparisons between the standards of performance achieved by
different authorities.
Copies of the report are to be made available at council offices and
local libraries. Anyone experiencing problems in finding one should
contact the Accounts Commission in Edinburgh.
Scottish Local Government Minister George Kynoch said the report
showed many examples of excellent council services, but also highlighted
weaknesses. There was no room for complacency.

Washington, Tuesday
THE Clinton administration has abruptly reversed itself on the
question of the 21,000 Cuban refugees now housed at Guantanamo Bay, the
US Navy base in Cuba.
After denying for months that they would ever be admitted to the
United States, President Clinton has now agreed that they can come.
His critics will argue that this is flagrant racism. Equal numbers of
Haitian refugees were at Guantanamo. Most of them have been repatriated
to Haiti, and the rest have been told that the choice is to go home or
to stay in camp.
Cubans are different. Among other things, most of them are white and
there is a huge and very powerful Cuban community in Florida agitating
for their admission.
The fig-leaf is that the United States will examine the cases of
15,000 of the Cubans to see whether they qualify as political refugees.
The screening will be done in Cuba itself, so they will have to return
home.
The US has promised to admit 15,000 Cubans. It believes that the
remaining 6,000 or so are mostly criminals.

Caltanissetta, Tuesday
MAFIA Godfather Salvatore Riina went on trial today accused of
ordering the bombing that killed Italy's most famous anti-Mafia judge.
Riina and 11 other reputed Mafiosi charged with the murder of
magistrate Giovanni Falcone were caged in cells that lined the
maximum-security courtroom in Caltanissetta, Sicily.
Riina, nicknamed The Beast, was placed in a cell by himself.
Not all of Riina's 40 associates who are accused of carrying out the
massive bombing in Palermo in May 1992 that killed Falcone, his wife
Francesca and three police guards, were in the courtroom. Nine are at
large and the others did not to attend.
The long-awaited trial, twice delayed for procedural reasons, will
include testimony by ex-Mafia members who have agreed to co-operate with
prosecutors.
Several leading turncoats, however, have recently stopped co-operating
and refused to testify, complaining of lack of security and cracks in
the state's commitment to the war on the mob.
Riina was arrested in January 1993 as part of a crackdown on organised
crime after the killings of Falcone and the murder two months later of
the judge's colleague Paolo Borsellino.
About 700 witnesses, among them 49 turncoats including some who
admitted involvement in Falcone's killing, are due to testify at the
trial, which is expected to last about 18 months.--Reuter

Grozny, Tuesday
CHECHEN fighters today stepped up hit-and-run attacks on Russian
forces who said they were bracing themselves for a rebel offensive when
President Boris Yeltsin meets world leaders next week.
The Russian interior ministry press centre in Grozny said separatist
leader Dzhokhar Dudayev had declared a ''Night of the Long Knives'' on
May 9 when Moscow hosts celebrations to mark the anniversary of the end
of the Second World War in Europe.
The report could not be independently confirmed, but fresh Chechen
assaults in the mainly Muslim north Caucasus territory suggested more
fighting was in store.
Army commander Major General Gennady Toshev told Itar-Tass news agency
he thought most rebels viewed a moratorium on fighting declared by
Yeltsin four days ago as a ''farce''.
He said he had reports some rebel commanders had instructed their
fighters not to fire on Russian positions, but added: ''Not all field
commanders have responded because as of today 17 ceasefire violations
have been registered''.
The rebels used mortars and grenade launchers as well as light
weapons, killing and wounding federal troops, Tass quoted him as saying.
A Russian defence ministry spokesman in Khankala, four miles east of
Grozny, said four Russian soldiers had died and 13 had been injured in
Chechen attacks yesterday.
''There is sporadic Chechen fire on Russian positions,'' Colonel
Sergei Volgin said. He said Russian troops were merely returning fire
and not engaging in active military operations in the southern rebel
republic.
''The Chechen rebels are trying to provoke Russian troops into
violating the ceasefire,'' he said.
Moscow's Ekho Moskvy radio station said a large number of Chechen
rebels had concentrated in the east of the breakaway region to prepare
for an attack on Grozny.
However, it later quoted the head of the new Moscow-backed Chechen
government as saying the idea was unrealistic.
''An assault on Grozny as such is impossible . . . even theoretically
it is unrealistic, since Dudayev has neither the strength nor the
opportunity,'' Salambek Khadzhiyev said.
Renewed bloodshed in Chechnya could cause Yeltsin serious political
embarrassment before his foreign guests on May 9.
Dudayev, with a clear interest in bringing the conflict to the world's
attention next week, has ignored the ceasefire.
Chechen rebels still control the southern part of the Caucasus region
and the latest fighting suggests the Russian forces, which entered
Chechnya on December 11 to crush its independence bid, are far from
controlling the lowlands.--Reuter

Frankfurt, Tuesday
A WARRANT for the extradition to Singapore of former Barings trader
Nick Leeson has been backed by the German authorities, it was revealed
today.
A preliminary charge of forgery against the man accused of bringing
down the City's oldest bank fulfils Germany's rigorous extradition
requirements, said Frankfurt's state prosecutor Hans-Hermann Eckert.
But Leeson, 28, remains in jail in Frankfurt jail pending
consideration of 11 other charges detailed in extradition documents
received by Mr Eckert from Singapore last week.
The preliminary charge, involving allegations that Mr Leeson forged a
signature to obtain #50m to keep his ill-fated derivatives trading
alive, was submitted two months ago.
Now the German authorities have received a sworn statement from
investment banker Richard Hogan, whose signature appears on the
falsified audit confirmation document.
But Eckert said it would be several weeks before his office was able
to verify the extradition details in the 11 other charges -- more than
1000 pages of submissions from Singapore -- because all the documents
are in English.

Paris, Tuesday
EUROPEAN allies refused today to follow the United States in imposing
a trade embargo on Iran, saying they preferred to use other means in
dealing with a country viewed by Washington as an outlaw state.
Britain, France, and the EU flatly ruled out joining the embargo.
Germany said Washington was wrong to seek an embargo but said it had not
made a final decision.
Israel, on the other hand, welcomed the American move, with Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres calling the plan ''a right decision, a very
powerful one and (at) the right time''.
US President Clinton said on Sunday he would cut off all US trade and
investment in Iran in a drive to thwart Tehran's alleged nuclear arms
programme and support for ''terrorism''.
But French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Paris participated solely
in trade embargoes approved by an appropriate international body such as
the United Nations.
And the EU said it wished to ''maintain a critical dialogue'' with
Tehran.
''We are not going to respond to this initiative. Our position is that
we want to maintain a critical dialogue with Iran,'' said an EU
spokesman.

Washington, Tuesday
TWO men were arrested at a motel in Missouri early this morning. Their
names and a photograph of one of them had been given out the night
before: they were wanted for questioning in connection with the Oklahoma
City bombing.
Police would not say whether either of them was the suspect known as
John Doe number 2 who allegedly rented the removal van that was used in
the bombing, together with Timothy McVeigh, who was arrested immediately
after the attack.
One news report said that he was very like the composite picture
issued by the police, but another said that he had no tattoos.
John Doe number 2 was said by the clerk who rented the truck to him to
have had a tattoo on his left arm.
The police issued the two names, Gary Land and Robert Jacks yesterday
evening, with a photograph of Mr Land. The two men had been seen with Mr
McVeigh in Arizona during the few weeks before the bombing.
They had been living in a series of motels, and on the night McVeigh
was arrested in Perry, north of Oklahoma City, they checked into a motel
in that small town.
They apparently left later in the day and returned to another motel
elsewhere in the state. Presumably they had learnt that Mr McVeigh had
been arrested. He was not at first connected with the bombing. He was
arrested for a traffic violation and for carrying a concealed gun.
After the picture and the names were released, they were broadcast on
the evening news, and the motel receptionist recognised the two men and
called the police.
It turned out that a police patrolman had already noticed the white
Ford Thunderbird driven by Mr Land, which was also described in the
arrest warrant.
The motel was surrounded. Early in the morning, guests in neighbouring
rooms were moved out, and then the two men were arrested.

Paris, Tuesday
SOCIALIST French presidential candidate Lionel Jospin pledged in a
live television debate today that if elected next Sunday he would reduce
the presidential term to five years and apply it to himself.
''Five years with Jospin is better than seven years with Jacques
Chirac,'' he told his conservative rival, who said he was not opposed to
reducing the term of office but believed there were more important
issues to debate.
The two-hour debate began on a courteous note with both men declaring
their respect for each other and uniting to condemn the drowning of a
Moroccan immigrant by skinheads on the fringe of an extreme-right
National Front march yesterday.
In the early exchanges, the 62-year-old Paris mayor Chirac said that
if former education minister Jospin, 57, were elected, he would be
unlikely to win a parliamentary majority, opening another long period of
paralysis between a socialist president and a centre-right government.
Each candidate accused the other's party of trying to monopolise
senior public sector and civil service jobs.
Jospin said his proposals for reforming France's institutions and
reducing what Chirac called the ''monarchical deviation'' of the
presidency were more radical than those offered by his opponent.--Reuter

Zagreb, Tuesday
The Croatian army captured all key points in a rebel Serb enclave
today and a Serb officer commanding 600 troops agreed to surrender and
hand over weapons to United Nations peacekeepers, a UN spokeswoman said.
Croatian Serbs retaliated swiftly, firing missiles into central
Zagreb, killing five people and wounding 121.
''The Croatians control the important parts of the region,''
spokeswoman Susan Manuel said by telephone from the western Slavonia
pocket, where Croatian army troops had attacked across UN ceasefire
lines yesterday.
It was Croatia's biggest recapture of territory since its Serb
minority rebelled against independence from Yugoslavia and seized a
third of the country for their self-styled Republic of Serb Krajina.
Croatian troops took control of Okucani, the main town of Western
Slavonia, the cross country motorway and positions in the north of the
pocket, east of Pakrac, after two days of fighting that alarmed Western
governments fearful of renewed war in the Balkan region.
In Pakrac, a rebel Serb officer in charge of 600 soldiers agreed to
surrender to the Croatian army and to hand over weapons to Argentine
peacekeepers in the next five days.
Under the UN-brokered agreement, ''the Croatian side agreed to give
amnesty to those who do so,'' Manuel said.
It was unclear if other Serb units elsewhere in the Western Slavonia
pocket would also surrender. Many of the overwhelmed rebels, along with
panicky civilians, fled across the Sava river border to Serb-held
Bosnia.
Serb refugees fled in their thousands to Bosnia, although Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman urged them to stay, promising an amnesty and
protection for all ''except war criminals''.
Bosnian Serbs, furious that UN troops did not stop the Croatian
advance, threatened to resume fighting in Bosnia where a four-month
ceasefire has just expired.
Their leader, Radovan Karadzic, accused Zagreb of ''impudent
aggression . . . enacted in front of the international community. No-one
can stop us taking arms to defend our people.''
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and other leaders of rump
Yugoslavia, after holding crisis talks, called the Croatian offensive a
criminal attack against peace efforts but also condemned the ''bombing
of cities'' a reference to the Serb's attack on Zagreb.
US ambassador Peter Galbraith said the four rockets fired into the
Croatian capital carried cluster-bomb warheads. He denounced the attack
as an ''outrageous response . . . designed to kill as many civilians as
possible in a major Europen capital.''
The missile attacks caused panic in Zagreb, where schools were closed
for 48 hours and the airport briefly closed to commercial flights after
the nearby area was attacked. More shells hit other Croatian towns near
Serb-held territory.
The Bosnian Serbs claimed to have shot down a Croatian Mig taking part
in a failed attempt by the Croats to destroy a river Sava River bridge
linking Western Slavonia with Bosnia.
Serbs said the air raids killed four people including a child of three
in Bosanska Gradiska on the Bosnian side.
Refugees from among the 13,000 Serbs in the mountainous Western
Slavonia pocket poured across the bridge with the few possessions they
could carry.
The Croatians ignored the Serb enclave's UN-protected status and a
ceasefire call by the Security Council in order to secure their
objective. They soothed protests from West European governments by
promising that the attack would end today.
Jittery European governments have threatened to pull their troops out
of UN peacekeeping operations in Yugoslavia if the warring sides resume
full-scale fighting.
The United States called on Croatia and Croatian Serbs to withdraw
their forces from Western Slavonia and respect UN authority.
EU Peace mediator Lord Owen urged countries with close relationships
with Croatia to put swift pressure on Zagreb to hand back key territory
won from rebel Serbs in a lightning offensive.
However, Mario Nobilo, Croatia's envoy to the United Nations, said its
troops would not leave the newly conquered Western Slavonia enclave.
''No, we are not going to withdraw from this territory. This is
Croatian territory,'' Nobilo said. ''We are there to stay, that's for
sure.''
''We are not going to give back the highway under the control of the
Serbs or the UN,'' Nobilo said.
''It will be very difficult to get them to withdraw,'' Owen, a special
European Union negotiator, said before he left for Geneva for urgent
talks on the worsening violence in former Yugoslavia.
He said Croatia had promised, particularly to the United States and
Germany, not to use a reduction in UN forces agreed earlier this year as
a signal to take offensive action.
''And here they have now taken a very serious offensive, it's not just
police, it's a big military operation,'' he said.

THE Prime Minister warned yesterday that British and other United
Nation forces would pull out of the former Yugoslavia if ''all-out war''
broke out.
Following renewed fighting in Croatia, Mr Major told the Commons at
Question Time that the UN Protection Force had helped limit the scale of
the conflict for two years but a return to hostilities would make their
position ''absolutely untenable''.
His comments came soon after Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind had
told MPs that Britain would not withdraw unilaterally from Bosnia.
Mr Rifkind had insisted: ''It is important the UN should act as a
single entity.''
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown later told Mr Major that he
welcomed Mr Rifkind's ''very clear statement''.
Mr Major told Mr Ashdown: ''There is no doubt that yesterday's attack,
in which some UK peace-keepers were wounded, and the retaliation today
by the Serbs have created a very serious situation, as has the decision
by the Bosnian parties not to extend the cessation of hostilities
agreement.''
He added: ''Over many months the UN forces, both in Croatia and in
Bosnia, have helped to limit the scale and extent of the conflict. That
has been the case for two years.
Mr Rifkind said: ''British forces will remain in Bosnia for as long as
Unprofor can continue to carry out its mandate at an acceptable level of
risk.''
Shadow defence secretary Dr David Clark asked if Nato had a plan to
withdraw troops if necessary.
Mr Rifkind said: ''We have always recognised there may be a
possibility that the UN force may have to be withdrawn.
''Nato has already agreed to provide the cover that would be necessary
in such a situation.''

THE new Aberdeenshire Council has appointed Mr Alan Campbell,
currently chief executive of Grampian Regional Council, to head its
10,500 staff.
The council moved quickly to appoint the #80,000-a-year chief
executive, whose job will be to get the new council up and running. He
was a contender for at least three similar positions for which
appointments have still to be made.
There were 36 applications from local government officers for the job.
This was whittled down to a short leet of three, who were interviewed
yesterday.
Mr Colin Millar, convener of the new council, said that on an open
vote the council had selected Mr Campbell, and he suspected the main
reasons were his experience of the area and his experience as chief
executive of Grampian Regional Council.
''He showed in his submission and interviews that he has the
forward-looking approach we were looking for,'' he said.
Mr Campbell, 48, started work as a graduate law apprentice in the
County Clerk's Department of Aberdeen County Council, in 1968. He became
assistant director of law and administration on the new Grampian
Regional Council in 1975, rising to chief executive in 1991.
He hopes to start work on June 1, and is looking forward to what he
sees as a ''huge challenge''.
Mr Campbell's depute chief executive, Mr Tony Connell, has been
appointed chief executive of Moray Council.

MORE than 900 people were arrested in one of the country's biggest
police operations yesterday as thousands of officers uncovered a massive
treasure trove of stolen goods.
The early morning raids were carried out by 5000 officers across 22
police force areas in southern England and Wales.
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon said officers had
taken DNA samples from large numbers of suspects under new powers given
to them by the Criminal Justice Act.
He said that ''everything from firearms through to garden gnomes'' had
been recovered in 1531 searches.
''What we are trying to show today is that there is no hiding place
for the burglar,'' he told a news conference.
Confirming that DNA samples had been taken from many suspects, he
said: ''Whereas DNA in the past has been confined to the most serious
crimes -- sexual offences, murder -- today most of the forces involved
will have taken DNA samples from people who have been arrested and
charged, reported or cautioned for burglary, which is a reportable
offence.''
The DNA samples were taken using a hair, or mouth saliva, which police
could demand, or blood, which could be given voluntarily.
Sir Paul said burglary was the crime that concerned most people.
''People fear having their homes broken into. That's why this has been
one of the most important police operations in recent years.''
He said the operation -- in which 911 people were arrested -- had
given police a picture of what was happening across a wide area.
One of the major finds was #75,000 worth of property stolen in Kent,
which was recovered in Devon and Cornwall.
In the London area alone, several hundred thousand pounds' worth of
stolen property from elsewhere in the country was recovered.
Among items recovered were oil paintings, jewellery, firearms,
ammunition, drugs, passports, credit cards, a large quantity of BBC
costumes -- and a complete kitchen, including appliances and units.
Police also unveiled another weapon against the burglar today. Named
the Bumblebee Imaging System (BIS), it aims to enable police to build up
a photographic database of stolen property.

what may or may not happen to the archives in the longer term.''
It follows suggestions that Lady Thatcher was prepared to donate the
documents to the nation.
An unnamed ''close friend'' of the former Prime Minister had said she
was dismayed at the Government's handling of the Churchill papers sale
and said she had decided that her own should not be sold for profit, but
used for scholarship and research.
According to one report, Lady Thatcher was intending to give the
papers free of charge to Cambridge's Churchill College, where Sir
Winston Churchill's archives will be displayed.
The collection includes drafts of her famous speeches, among them her
''the Lady's not for turning'' address and a confidential memo on the
Falklands, written two days after fighting ended.
The memo details her feelings on the 1982 conflict. Other notes are
believed to cover talks with world leaders.
A furore erupted last week over the #12.5m lottery cash for Sir
Winston's papers, and news that Tory MP Winston Churchill, grandson of
the wartime leader, stands to benefit from the cash paid for the
archives.
National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell said he would welcome the
prospect of Lady Thatcher's donation of her papers to the nation as ''a
generous gift''.
Labour yesterday asked Mr Major to tighten rules over Ministerial
documents to prevent any repeat of the controversy, amid speculation
that Lady Thatcher's son Mark might profit from her papers.
Former Defence Minister Alan Clark said: ''If she gives them to the
nation, and by that she means making them available to students, that is
a wonderful and very generous act.''
Lord Parkinson, one of her closest political allies, said he would not
be at all surprised if Lady Thatcher gave the papers to the nation and
earned nothing from them. Such a donation would be ''typically
generous''.
''I hope among other things . . . one of the famous handbags will be
included with which Ministers of the Cabinet were demolished on a
regular basis,'' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Meanwhile, Tory MP Sir Patrick Cormack tabled a Commons motion
defending Mr Churchill for selling the papers to the nation. He said Sir
Winston was entirely justifed in seeking to make provision for his heirs
by bequeathing his papers.

A TEMPLE of tyres built at Leith docks as part of Edinburgh's failed
bid for the 1999 City of Architecture and Design title -- which went to
arch-rival Glasgow -- cost the capital more than #120,000.
The ''sculpture'', entitled Temple At Tyre by Fife-born artist David
Mach, was intended to promote the city's bid for the prestigious title
against the other candidates, Glasgow and Liverpool. In fact it was
still incomplete when Arts Council assessors visited the city last
October.
The completed sculpture was on site at the Victoria dock for only four
weeks.
The district council policy and resources committee will be asked to
approve the expenditure tomorrow. According to a report released by the
council yesterday, councillors are expected to approve the actions of
the chief executive and Labour administration leader, Councillor Leslie
Hinds, whose decision it was to support the idea.
At the time of the decision, the estimated cost was #90,000 and
sponsorship of #40,000 had been secured.
The report states that Kwik-Fit and Wimpey Homes contributed #20,000
each and ScottishPower #1500. In addition, Kwik-Fit donated 8000 tyres;
the Forth Ports Authority provided the site, labour, and storage.
Reasons given in the report for the escalating cost include additional
foundations ''to respond to poor ground conditions'', the sponsored
cranes proving inadequate to the task, and an ''inadequate estimate'' of
the cost of demolishing the temple.
The publicity gained in media coverage, the gift of a model of the
sculpture, and the fact that an item about it may appear in a future
edition of the Guinness Book of Records, is, according to the council's
public relations department, worth more than #238,000.

DETECTIVES investigating the Greenpeace occupation of a North Sea oil
installation flew back to Aberdeen yesterday.
The seven-strong police team has been carrying out their
investigations from the Brent Alpha, less than two miles from the
disused Brent Spar, which is occupied by protesters.
Grampian police said yesterday that their information was being
collated for a report to the procurator-fiscal.
Meanwhile, the Greenpeace activists say they will stay put and claim
they will not be deflected from their aim of preventing the structure
and its toxic cargo being dumped at sea.
Twelve men and women clambered aboard the former tanker loading
terminal, 118 miles north-east of Shetland, on Sunday and Monday.
Greenpeace fears plans by Brent Spar owners Shell Expro to float the
installation out and dump it in deep Atlantic waters will cause untold
damage to the marine environment.
''We expect Shell to put pressure on the Government to bring in the
Navy,'' said campaigner Tim Birch yesterday.
''It is a huge embarrassment for Shell, which has high-level contacts
with the British Government.''
Mr Birch was speaking at Lerwick during a brief stop-over for the
Greenpeace ship Moby Dick, which is keeping the Brent Spar activists
supplied with food and equipment.
Customs officers boarded the ship yesterday. ''The reason they came
was for a crew list so that the police investigating this know who is
involved,'' said Mr Birch.
* Oil has washed up on two of Shetland's beaches during the past two
days.
Yesterday the council's environmental services department were taking
samples from Quendale beach as reports came in of large globules of oil
washing up on the Sands of Sound near Lerwick.

A MALE streaker made a splash during a live nationwide television
weather forecast yesterday.
The naked man leapt into view during Granada's This Morning show just
as forecaster Fred Talbot was saying there were no clouds in the sky.
Talbot, famous for his floating map of Britain in the Albert Dock in
Liverpool, tried to carry on, but the streaker left nothing to the
imagination as he pranced all over England, Scotland and Wales.
As he tried to hop from Scotland to Ireland, he made a real splash
when he landed in the murky water.
As the streaker hauled himself back on ''dry land'', Talbot handed him
his clipboard to save his embarrassment.
The show's hosts, Richard Maddeley and Judy Finnigan, looked on in
amazement as people watching from the dockside cheered.
A Granada spokesman said: ''It was only a little matter -- the water
was freezing!''
Later the man was led away by security staff.
After the show, the presenters asked to meet the streaker.
Maddeley said: ''We asked to meet him, and he told us he had done it
because it was a sunny day and it was a bit of fun.
''Anyone who fails to see the funny said needs a sense of humour
transplant.''

NUM members in England began a strike ballot yesterday over the
refusal by RJB Mining's chief executive, Mr Richard Budge, to negotiate
on pay -- even though he is no longer insisting on a three-year pay
freeze.
The NUM, representing over half of RJB's 10,000 workforce, is
understood to be contemplating a series of one-day stoppages.
Mr Budge's firm took over the English activities of British Coal at
the turn of the year and has 22 mines and 18 open-cast sites.
NUM leaders refused to accept the three-year pay freeze. Nor are they
prepared to accept a last minute offer of a pay review at the end of
this year -- especially as RJB directors have awarded themselves
increases of between 23-27% and Mr Budge's earnings have jumped to
#290,000.

A SENIOR councillor yesterday accused the convener of the new Scottish
Borders Council of carrying out a personal vendetta in a bid to halt the
transfer of Berwickshire's council housing stock to a newly formed
housing association.
Councillor George Finlay, chairman of the district housing committee,
said Councillor Drew Tulley's outdated views on housing provision lagged
well behind those of all the major housing authorities in Britain.
The new council would be left with no local authority housing in
Berwickshire but Councillor Finlay claimed financial arrangements had
been agreed which would enable the housing association to fulfil its
commitments to the 2000 tenants.
Councillor Finlay commented: ''The continuing paranoiac attacks by
Councilor Tulley on the district council can only be likened to the
actions of the Luddites when they attempted to reverse the progress of
the industrial revolution.''

SCOTTISH aid worker Dr Denis Rutovitz, who returned home yesterday
after being shot on a mercy mission to Bosnia, admitted he had taken his
convoy on a far too dangerous route.
Dr Rutovitz, 66, said that despite being hit in the chest by a
sniper's bullet on the way to Sarajevo on Thursday, he would be
returning to the war zone when he was fully fit.
However, he did warn that his group, Edinburgh Direct Aid, had to find
a balance between the good work they were doing and the risks their
volunteers faced.
Two years ago his close friend and fellow volunteer Christine Witcutt
was killed by a sniper's bullet on the road out of Sarajevo.
Dr Rutovitz said it felt like ''being hit by a sledgehammer'' when the
bullet hit him as he led the eight-vehicle convoy up Mount Igman on the
way to Sarajevo.
He added they were ''rethinking'' what part of Bosnia their aid would
be taken to in future. ''It is clear in retrospect that on the last
convoy to Sarajevo we got it wrong. I had got it wrong.
''The risk was too high. We are going to change that aspect of our
operations at the moment and shift our focus to areas which are easier
to operate in.''
Dr Rutovitz, holding the bullet that hit him in the shoulder, said
that despite his injuries he would be going back.
Speaking in his home in Newhaven, Edinburgh, he praised the 13 people
on the ill-fated convoy that ran into trouble. He revealed that the
chief mechanic on the trip, Mr Andy Sutherland, also had a lucky escape
after the truck he was driving crashed in the battle zone and he had to
be rescued by two other convoy members.
As he looked at the bullet that nearly took his life he said his
thoughts turned to Christine Witcutt.
''It would have been a similar bullet that killed Christine,'' said Dr
Rutovitz. He added that a lasting memorial to her, in the form of an
important building like a health centre, would be built in her memory in
Sarajevo.
Dr Rutovitz added :''After they removed the bullet from me the French
doctors packed it along with my things. I didn't ask to have it. People
have suggested I wear it as a good luck charm but I don't think I
will.''
The next Edinburgh Direct Aid convoy is scheduled to go out in June.

A PROPOSAL that unbaptised children should be allowed to take
communion on the same terms as baptised children, provided certain
conditions are met, will be made today by a Church of Scotland board.
The board of parish education says communion should be open to
unbaptised children who are closely associated with the life and worship
of the church.
The board, which was asked in 1992 to examine the situation of
unbaptised children in Sunday schools and congregations in connection
with access to communion, will ask this month's General Assembly of the
Kirk to amend existing legislation.
The proposed amendments say, however, that these children should be
accompanied by their parents or adults from the congregation.
The question of their baptism would be explored with their parents,
and their names would be added to the communion roll when they had been
baptised and had publicly professed their faith.
The board says that the Youth Assembly held last year was valuable as
a means of engaging teenagers and young adults in the many and varied
issues and concerns facing the church.
It wants to organise similar events in future on a triennial basis,
provided funding can be found for the purpose.
Last year's Assembly rejected a proposal to sell Carberry Tower, the
Kirk's residential conference centre near Musselburgh, and said the
board should negotiate with the Friends of Carberry to draw up a
business plan to let Carberry be run by a trust.
The board has agreed to lease the property to the Friends of Carberry
and says it has made a very generous offer.

<HEADLINE>Advisers claim independent privatisation feasible as workers and managers lobby MPs.  Scottish Nuclear 'floatable'</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Nuclear's financial advisers have told Ministers that it
could be privatised as an independent entity instead of being merged
with its bigger English neighbour, Nuclear Electricity, it emerged last
night.
In a confidential report, advisers Lazards, the merchant bank, argue
that the public sector company could form a ''floatable'' entity as it
stands, with its two advanced gas cooled reactors at Torness and
Hunterston.
The new development was revealed at the end of a day which saw the
company's staff and officials -- from shop-floor worker to chairman,
step up their campaign to preserve its independent status.
A delegation of staff last night returned home on their ''battle bus''
after spending a day at Westminster lobbying support from MPs across the
political spectrum.
As they made their way back, Scottish Nuclear chairman James Hann was
busy telling a meeting in Glasgow that independence remained the
company's favoured option.
Lazards is believed to have been given the task of compiling its
report last Friday as part of the company's attempts to prevent a
shotgun merger.
Mr Hann last night said that the report had removed any doubt about
the viability of the so-called ''six/two'' solution, where both the
English and Scottish companies are privatised in separate sell-offs.
The document is understood to say that Scottish Nuclear has sufficient
critical mass and with guaranteed sale of contracts for the next 10
years would prove to be attractive in any flotation.
The news stirred angry debate on the battle bus which was carrying 45
exhausted delegates back from the House of Commons. Some felt they had
been cheated and used by the company as pawns in the publicity battle.
But two managers on board, Scottish Nuclear director Bill Doig and
Hunterston engineering manager Duncan Hawthorne, insisted that nothing
had changed.
Mr Hawthorne said: ''All that has happened is that we have gone to an
independent financial adviser to combat the Government's advice that we
could only be sold as part of a merged major nuclear generating
company.''
Last night the Scottish Nuclear Workers' Campaign, a specially formed
adjunct of the workers' lobby group, the National Campaign for a Nuclear
Industry (NCNI), came out strongly against any privatisation of the
nuclear industry.
Mr Stuart McGhie, a shop steward at Hunterston, said he hoped the
timing of the release of the Lazards report was coincidental to the
London lobby trip, as he and all the delegates on board the bus had
worked very hard to promote an independent Scottish industry. That
energy would now go towards fighting any plans to remove the nuclear
generating company from public control.
The delegation, from the company's Hunterston and Torness plants and
from its East Kilbride headquarters, mounted a lobby outside the House
of Commons before presenting sackfuls of protest letters to No. 10
Downing Street.
''The response has been absolutely tremendous. We are tired, but it's
been well worth it,'' said Mr McGhie. ''I think the lobby has gone very
well indeed,'' said Mr Doig. ''The reception has been exceptional.''
During a talk to the West of Scotland Businesswomen's Club last night,
Mr Hann claimed that Scottish Secretary Ian Lang and his officials were
''fighting very hard for us -- and for what is best for Scotland''.

A POLITICAL row over National Lottery cash broke out last night when
it was disclosed that almost #5m could be spent in administrative costs
before charities receive a penny.
The National Lottery Charities Board said that charities working with
the poor looked like being the first to receive grants, but Labour said
it was a ''scandal'' that none of the money would be awarded before
October -- nearly a year after the lottery began.
Shadow Heritage Secretary Chris Smith said he wanted to see ''very
close accounting'' of the amount being spent by the NLCB.
National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell denied claims that lottery
money would be used to replace Government spending on benefits.
The NLCB would be the biggest support mechanism for charities in
Europe, he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme.
''In the use of that money, most people in Britain would take the view
that charity money should be relayed towards those whose need is
greatest. Most people would take the view that if charity money is being
used to support those with a particular disadvantage, those on the
lowest incomes, those are likely to be the groups where the need is
greatest,'' he said.
However, Liberal Democrat national heritage spokesman Robert Maclennan
said: ''The disadvantaged in society need a proper income, and I cannot
believe that that should be made available through the philanthropy of
the National Lottery. It has to be provided through the tax and benefit
system.
''If there is a Victorian approach to handing out money from the
National Lottery to the poor, we might very well see the Benefits Agency
docked of money to meet the needs of the poor.''
NLCB officials said they had based their decision to concentrate on
initiatives to alleviate poverty after wide consultations with voluntary
groups and charities. They added that other charities would be
considered later.
NLCB chief executive Timothy Hornsby said he estimated that costs on
offices, computers, staff and other administration would be between
#3.2m and #4.8m by October, but described the figure as ''modest'' given
the operation had started from scratch last year.
The National Council for Voluntary Organisations said #150m would go
nowhere near making up for what charities had lost to the lottery -- an
estimated net loss of more than #50m.
Mr Martin Sime, director of the Scottish Council for Voluntary
Organisations, said members of the NLCB had been late in being appointed
and faced a much more complex task than the other distributors because
they would be making more grants to small organisations.
''They could have hundreds of thousands of applications for fairly
small sums of money. We have been very sympathetic. The delays are not
their fault, but we want them to get on the road,'' Mr Sime said.
Mr Allan Wilson, acting director for Scotland of the NLCB, said 11.5%
of the total #150m (around #17.2m) would go to Scotland.
''That compares to 8.9% that Scotland would normally get on a
population basis to take account of the fact that deprivation in
Scotland is higher than elsewhere in the UK,'' he said.
NLCB officials produced a league table of priorities, headed by
''living environment'', ''children'', ''community participation'',
''disabilities'', ''poverty'' and ''young people'' -- with the
''mentally and physically ill'' coming seventh. At the bottom came
''missionary activities'', ''overseas development'', ''refugees'', and
''animal welfare''. They made no mention of ''medical research'' or
''cancer''.
Medical, Third World and animal charities said the table in no way
reflected current public spending on charity.

CABINETS in trouble, like punch-drunk boxers, start offering even more
targets for the Opposition to hit.
In 1978, the Callaghan Cabinet, already in the most fearful trouble
policing, or failing to police, a 10% pay norm, sat round the Downing
Street table and, though apparently in full possession of their senses,
decided that next year it would be 5%. They got ''the winter of
discontent'' and then Mrs Thatcher.
This Cabinet was proposing to (a) virtually force home-buyers to take
out mortgage insurance (probably a good idea) and (b) tax them at their
highest rate on any pay-out lasting longer than a year (something only a
Treasury official would regard as a good idea).
From the political retribution which would have followed from
middle-class voters -- whom the Government is supposed to be trying to
make feel more secure -- it was rescued by a press report and a U-turn
which is being examined by the Guinness Book of Records as possibly the
fastest in history.
Certainly, at 10am the Tory chairman, Mr Jeremy Hanley, had said there
was no such policy. At 10.30am, Mr Stephen Dorrell, the National
Heritage Secretary and a former Treasury Minister, said there were no
proposals to change this policy. At 11am, Downing Street briefed
journalists that the policy was being reviewed.
Just allowing time for habitually rebellious Tory MP Mr Nicholas
Winterton (Macclesfield) to warn he would not vote for the policy which
was ''nuts, lunacy, madness'', the Chancellor emerged to announce the
policy had changed and pay-outs would not be taxed.
This added up to a field day for Mr Tony Blair for whom things are
going so swimmingly that the more superstitious Labour MPs have pledged
to keep their fingers crossed until April 1997.
He recited this scenario with enough brio to make even the Prime
Minister call it ''amusing,'' for which the Sketch feels Mr Major
deserves considerable credit.
The tax treatment of mortgage protection policies had been under
review for ''some months'' he told a sceptical Oppositon. The
Chancellor, had, unusually, made the position clear in advance of the
Finance Bill, to remove any uncertainty caused by ''misguided reports.''
This unusual alacrity in settling the public mind given the Treasury's
traditional haughty view of the masses it taxes, , seemed a fair
indication of how damaging Ministers had decided the ''misguided
reports'' would be.
Mr Blair suggested that the events of the morning had reduced the
Government to an ''utterly chaotic shambles'', which seemed, on the
whole a moderate statement of the case.
The Prime Minister did his best bravely asserting that the only party
which truly supported home ownership sat on the Government Benches. The
cheer he was seeking sounded merely dutiful.
Taxing the mortgage protection pay-outs of home owners who become
unemployed, ill or suffer some other misfortune seems a very odd way of
encouraging home ownership. It seems an even odder way of trying to win
an election.

HEALTH Secretary Virginia Bottomley was involved in a noisy
confrontation with senior Tory MPs over planned health cuts in London,
it emerged yesterday.
Five leading back benchers argued in vain to persuade Mrs Bottomley to
reverse plans to close the accident and emergency department of a
leading hospital in the city.
The hour-long meeting at the Health Department on Monday night took
place at the request of Hendon North MP Sir John Gorst, one of two MPs
to warn the Government he will not back plans for the proposed
London-wide health changes.
He was accompanied by other backbench critics Sir Rhodes Boyson (Brent
North), Mr Hugh Dykes (Harrow East), Mr Hartley Booth (Finchley) and Mr
John Marshall (Hendon South).
The focus of the meeting were closure plans for the emergency
department at Edgware general hospital, but most of the group also share
concerns at proposals to shut the Bart's teaching hospital and slim down
other services.
Sir John said: ''There was obviously an unbridgeable gap between us --
certainly the discussion was not about reversing the decision.
''I would not say the meeting was so much heated as noisy, with three
or four people talking at the same time and interrupting one another.
''There was a minimum of listening going on, certainly from Virginia
Bottomley.''
The meeting broke up with the two sides as far apart as ever but the
back benchers yesterday were united in their determination to fight on.
The Department of Health confirmed the private meeting had taken place
but declined to give details.
The Government now faces almost certain revolt when the issue of
London health care eventually goes before the Commons.
Sir Rhodes said: ''We said our piece strongly because it is our job to
look after our constituents.
''The way this has been handled has been like a dictatorship, not a
democracy. We have made our case regularly for the past 18 months and we
have been ignored. It is no way to run a country.''

THE Government confirmed yesterday that water samples are to be taken
in the North Channel to see if there is any pollution from rockets
containing poison gas dumped after the Second World War.
Between 1945 and 1946, rockets containing phosgene -- a lung-irritant
poison gas -- were dumped in the channel between South-west Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
Concern about the dumping was raised during Defence Questions by
Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley Labour MP George Foulkes, who strongly
challenged Defence Minister Roger Freeman.
He told Mr Freeman: ''Your department has dumped one million tons of
munitions, plus bombs and chemical weapons, including arsenic and nerve
gas in sites at sea including the Clyde and the North Channel.''
Mr Foulkes demanded: ''Will you now announce some kind of monitoring,
which will ensure the safety of fishing boats, submarines, and those who
live around the coasts in those areas. These are highly dangerous
substances.''
Mr Freeman said there was a licensing procedure for sea dumping
between South-west Scotland and Northern Ireland, which involved the
Scottish Office, the Transport Department and the Agriculture Ministry.
The Minister said he accepted that rockets with phosgene had been
dumped in the North Channel, but added: ''As part of routine monitoring
of coastal waters both the Scottish Office and the Ministry of
Agriculture will be conducting standard water-monitoring tests in the
North Channel.''
The Rev. Martin Smyth, Ulster Unionist MP for Belfast South, asked if
the Northern Ireland Office would be consulted on the matter and was
given that assurance.
In a statement issued later, Mr Foulkes said: ''This is a step
forward, but I will continue to press for more thorough monitoring.
''With over one million tonnes of munitions, bombs and chemical
weapons -- including arsenic and nerve gas -- in containers which are
now corroded and breaking free, the dangers to fishermen, submarines and
those of us who live along the coasts are immense.
''While this is a welcome step, only a full-scale inquiry and
monitoring exercise will quell all the fears and reduce risks to a
minimum.''

<HEADLINE>Row over airstrip reaches new plane Enterprise company awards director's hotel #157,500 redevelopment grant</HEADLINE>

THE man at the centre of controversial plans for an airstrip on the
Isle of Arran has received more than #150,000 from the local enterprise
company of which he is a director.
The grant to Mr Robin Crawford and his fellow owners of the Kinloch
Hotel in Blackwaterfoot is for a major redevelopment, providing 12
bedrooms and seven suites, due to be completed at the end of next month.
It was disclosed in The Herald yesterday that the Shiskine Valley
Trust, which Mr Crawford chairs, has received more than #3000 from the
Lec towards its bid for an airstrip at Drumadoon, which is close to the
Kinloch.
There is local controversy over the involvement of Argyll and Islands
Enterprise in the project and claims that a rival airfield plan at
Balmichael is more attractive and has the backing of expert consultants.
Now details have emerged of backing given to a building project at the
Kinloch by AIE, which is part of the Highlands and Islands Enterprise
network.
Out of a total cost of #525,000 for the project the Lec will provide
30%, which comes to #157,500. It is hoped that five jobs will be created
at the hotel with the season extended by two months for the 35 people
who work there in the summer.
Mr Crawford, who runs the hotel with his brother and nephew, last
night described the cash injection as ''essential to the project and
important to tourism on the island''.
He said that every effort had been made to ensure the circumstances
leading up to the grant were ''squeaky clean'' as he is a director of
the local enterprise company.
Mr Crawford said that he was aware of criticism levelled at the grant
but said that not only did Argyll and the Islands Enterprise have a
policy of declaring directors' interests but also released details of
all grants to the local media.
Cunninghame North MP Brian Wilson, whose constituency includes Arran,
looked into the circumstances surrounding the grant and said he was
satisfied adding: ''This project is important for the future of the
hotel which in turn is important for the development of tourism on the
island. I wish more local enterprise companies were as open when it
comes to disclosing details of projects in which they are involved.''
Mr Crawford added: ''We have done reasonably well through the
recession to increase turnover while not exactly showing huge profits
but we have to move forward with the times and this development will
make the hotel more attractive. We also hope to increase the season and
attract people for a quiet holiday in September or October.''
He said that while the overall staff might only be increased by around
five it was hoped that the longer season would mean that the present
summer level of 35 people would last longer.
Mr Crawford said that the grant was not dealt with by staff from
Argyll and Islands Enterprise locally because of his personal
involvement but the papers had been sent to the ''parent'' Highlands and
Islands Enterprise for processing.
Mr Crawford said the future of the Kinloch Hotel would have been in
jeopardy without the redevelopment.
Mr Jonathan Poore, public relations officer for Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, said: ''It is likely that a visit was made to Arran before
agreement was given for this financial support.
''What is for sure is that we dealt with the application as it exceeds
the #50,000 limit for projects which can be dealt with by the Lecs
themselves.''
He said that the criteria for such assistance would be job creation as
well as wider economic development factors and stressed that the fact of
Mr Crawford being an AIE director would have had no bearing on the
decision.
Mr Poore continued: ''We are completely open about every transaction
and publish details of financial assistance given each month. This is in
contrast to other enterprise networks.
''I would also stress that the money does not go to Mr Crawford but to
his company and that every penny we give them will have to be justified
and supported by detailed receipts.''
A spokeswoman for AIE said that the redevelopment of the Kinloch Hotel
was ''very important for the west side of Arran''.

<HEADLINE>Blair quickly into the fray as the gloves come off in Perth and Kinross campaign.  BBC wants 'balance'  in Tory coverage</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBBIE DINWOODIE, SCOTTISH POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978583820</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
WITH the by-election campaign in Perth and Kinross now officially
under way and polling day set for May 25, the BBC confirmed yesterday
that it would hold internal talks about balance in the light of next
week's Scottish Conservative conference.
As all parties welcomed the end of the phoney war in the constituency
and the formal start of political hostilities, a BBC spokesman
confirmed: ''Now that the writ for Perth and Kinross has been moved BBC
Scotland senior editors will be discussing the by-election programme
strategy across radio and television later this week.''
The spokesman added: ''The Conservative Party conference coverage will
be discussed in that context.''
This was being seen yesterday as a sign that although the BBC will
hold fast to its traditional policy of giving full coverage to the
annual conference -- which is being held at the Royal Concert Hall in
Glasgow for three days, starting next Wednesday -- it will seek to find
ways to balance any exposure for Perth and Kinross candidate John
Godfrey, who is already down to propose the opening motion.
Mr Michael Russell, chief executive of the SNP, said the party's
lawyers were studying the Representation of the People Act and once they
had reported back he would decided whether to write to BBC Scotland
controller John McCormack.
Labour leader Tony Blair was quickly into the fray yesterday,
describing Perth and Kinross, as ''a community where Tory values and
Tory votes are fading fast, and where the vote for the SNP has been a
protest vote, not a vote for Nationalism.''
He said Labour had an outstanding candidate in Douglas Alexander, and
a vote that was growing while the Tories and SNP votes were falling, a
base new Labour would build on.
''Our message is that the people of Perth and Kinross now have the
opportunity to vote with real purpose, not just for a new MP but for a
new Government and a new country,'' he said.
Mr Alexander said it was a by-election the Tories could not win and
one in which by explaining and campaigning for the policies of new
Labour they would ''test the Nationalists day after day.''
However, SNP front-runner Roseanna Cunningham -- who was just over
2000 votes behind the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn in the last General
Election -- said that choosing the date when MPs broke off for the
Whitsun recess showed the Tories knew they were staring defeat in the
face and had prepared their escape from Westminister.
''The Tories are down in Perth and Kinross,'' said Ms Cunningham,
''but only the SNP can knock them out, just as we defeated them and took
control of the new council last month. Labour and the Liberal Democrats
can only be spoilers in this by-election, preferring a Tory hold to an
SNP victory for Scotland.''
The Liberal Democrats are claiming that they are best placed to
challenge, and from today have taken Chief Whip Archy Kirkwood MP off
Westminster duties to run the campaign on the ground -- an unusual step
which the party said reflected the belief that they are about to break
away from the pack.
Candidate Veronica Linklater said: ''We are all set to go with
confidence and enthusiasm. Having increased our share of the vote in the
local elections -- when both the SNP and Tory vote went down -- we are
very serious contenders.''
The Conservative campaign gets under way in Perth tonight with the
formal adoption of the candidate John Godfrey. The spotlight will be on
him when he proposes the opening motion in Glasgow next week, and the
reply will be by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Over the three days, seven other Cabinet Ministers will attend the
conference -- the Scottish, Employment, Foreign and Defence Secretaries,
plus the party chairman, the Lord Advocate and the Prime Minister.
The entire Scottish team of Ministers will speak, and others attending
will include Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish, Minister of State at the
Department of Social Security, and Home Office Minister Michael Forsyth.
It is not yet known how many will make the onward leg of the journey
north to support the by-election campaign on the ground.
Meanwhile, in the run-up to tomorrow's local elections south of the
Border, the Government yesterday launched its counter-offensive against
Labour's decision to replace its historic Clause 4.
Tory chairman Jeremy Hanley accused Labour of being ''still the same
old socialist dinosaur'' and claimed party leader Tony Blair had been
told by his deputy John Prescott he could go ''thus far and no
further''.
Mr Hanley told a Tory local elections news conference at Westminster
that Mr Prescott had ''fired a warning shot across the bows of his
leader''.
Mr Prescott ridiculed Conservative Central Office as a ''Mickey Mouse
outfit''.He accused Mr Hanley of a ''pathetic'' attempt to drive a wedge
between himself and Mr Blair.
He said Mr Hanley and National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell had
not been briefed on the ''important story'' about tax on mortgage
protection policies before attending yesterday's news conference.
Whoever was responsible for failing to brief them on the story should
be sacked, Mr Prescott said.

THE first move towards the development of a new business park on the
outskirts of Edinburgh was yesterday approved by Lothian councillors.
Members of the region's transportation committee approved proposals
for public and private transport access at the site, as part of
developer New Edinburgh Ltd's submission for planning consent.
The land, on the west side of the city next to the bypass, has already
been designated a key site on the proposed route for the Central
Edinburgh Rapid Transit light rail system.
Proposals for a new railway station, at what will be known as
Edinburgh Park, will also be considered by the transportation committee,
which has stipulated that land must be set aside at the site to
accommodate a new station at a future date.
New Edinburgh Ltd will be asked to make a contribution of more than
#250,000 to a trust fund if planning consent is granted. The fund will
be used to help meet the costs of the new railway station, but will be
returned after seven years if no construction contract has been agreed.
Other transport conditions imposed include a restriction of 7820
car-parking spaces, bus access, a cycle route, and a taxi rank at the
new station.
Welcoming the move, Councillor David Begg, chairman of the
transportation committee, said: ''This is a very exciting development
for Edinburgh and one which will play a significant role in its economy
over the next 10 years.''

ABOUT 500 ''red tape'' regulations will be abolished or changed before
the end of this year, the Prime Minister told the Commons yesterday.
Mr Major was replying at Question Time to Tory Anthony Steen (South
Hams), who protested that officials were harming industrial
competitiveness because they were ''more zealous at enforcing
regulations than at trying to reduce the implication of regulations''.
Mr Major replied: ''Both at national and local level, over-zealous
enforcement of regulation -- particularly of small businesses -- does
cause a great deal of distress and worry.''
Deregulation was central to the Government's economic policy, the
Prime Minister added.
He told Mr Steen: ''You may be reassured to know that we now have a
programme of over 1000 regulations earmarked for amendment or repeal and
we expect to have dealt with about half of those by the end of this
year.''

FARMER Humphrey Errington is today set for a confrontation with
council officials hoping to remove nearly a ton of Lanark Blue cheese
worth #27,000 from his farm.
Mr Errington, 50, of Ogscastle, Dunsyre, Lanarkshire, was told by his
solicitors yesterday that Clydesdale District Council environmental
health officers would attempt to remove the cheese because they feared
it may not be ''securely held''.
The move follows a court judgment last week which ruled that Mr
Errington was denied natural justice in the hearing which originally
condemned the cheese.
The council argues that a batch of the cheese contains listeria and is
a danger to health. Despite the judgment, officials promised to pursue
attempts to destroy the cheese.
It is currently stored at Mr Errington's farm under lock and key. Mr
Errington claims it is harmless. He has promised to deny access to
council officials.

A GOVERNMENT Bill to protect the disabled from discrimination does not
go far enough, an influential all-party committee of MPs said yesterday.
A report by the Commons Employment Select Committee said the
Disability Discrimination Bill did no more than lay the groundwork for
further legislation.
The report also dismissed the Government's main objection to a more
comprehensive anti-discrimination law -- that it would cost too much.
The report is likely to be seized upon by campaigners backing a
Private Member's Bill -- by Labour MP Harry Barnes -- which would
provide much tougher powers for tackling discrimination against the
disabled.

A DRUNKEN sailor was let off with a #200 fine yesterday after a
sheriff heard him promise to pay #1000 towards the cost of his rescue.
In an unprecedented move, Sheriff William Fulton had deferred sentence
for a year until yesterday to allow 65-year-old Fred King to pay part of
the #4300 cost the RNLI and the coastguards who rescued him near Skye.
A condition of the deferred sentence was that King, who runs the
Badachro Inn near Gairloch, Wester Ross, with wife Sheila, 64, be of
good behaviour until yesterday's appearance.
But fiscal Colin McClory told Portree Sheriff Court that at New Year
the former Edinburgh senior civil servant was fined #1000 at Dingwall
Sheriff Court and banned for three years for a drink-driving offence. He
was almost three times over the limit.
As he left court yesterday, King said: ''I'm just glad it's all
over.''
At the original court appearance, Mr McClory told how ex-teacher Mrs
King persuaded her husband to take her friend, former No. 10 Downing
Street secretary Antoinette Passmore 47, on a 100-mile cruise to St
Kilda in his 30ft yacht.
The pair set out, but turned back after two days because of impending
bad weather. Miss Passmore of Tollie Farm, Poolewe, then radioed the
coastguards while King was asleep and said that she wanted rescued from
the yacht Traigh Mhor as King could not handle it.
Miss Passmore was winched on to the Stornoway rescue helicopter, but
coastguards became worried because King's speech on the radio was
slurred.
He said he was unsure of his position in the Minch between Skye and
the Outer Hebrides.
Portree lifeboat was launched and the crew found the yacht, boarded it
and helped sail it into the safety of Uig on Skye where the police were
waiting.
Mr McClory said: ''They found him under the influence of drink. He
could not walk without the help of police, and did not seem to
understand what was being said.''
The father of two grown-up sons -- one a lawyer, the other an
accountant -- was then put in jail for the night. He later admitted
sailing ''culpably and recklessly'' while under the influence of
alcohol.
Defence lawyer Donald Ferguson claimed that King had been ''feeling
unwell'' and had taken ''a few hot toddies''.
There had been a personality clash and Miss Passmore had over-reacted.
King was a yachtsman of more than 30 years' experience.
Mr Ferguson said Miss Passmore was more suited to luxury liners than a
small yacht.
Afterwards King said: ''This is all very embarrassing. I'm actually a
member of the RNLI.''
Asked yesterday if the couple had patched up their friendship with the
former Wilson Government secretary, Mrs King said: ''You must be
joking.''
Miss Passmore said at her home: ''I've nothing to say.''
King was given two weeks to pay #770 to the coastguards and #230 to
the RNLI.

SIR Michael Hordern, one of Britain's leading actors, has died at the
age of 83.
He died ''peacefully'' yesterday afternoon at The Churchill Hospital,
Oxford after long illness. A hospital spokeswoman said the actor had
been receiving dialysis treatment.
His roles ranged from playing King Lear to providing the voice for
Paddington Bear.
He was born on October 3, 1911, to a family whose traditions were
partly naval but mostly clerical.
He began a career as a schoolteacher but this lasted only two terms
until an attack of polio.
He then became a commercial traveller for the Educational Supply
Association for five years, during which time he took up amateur
dramatics.
Eventually, acting was taking up so much of his time that he decided
to become an actor, undaunted by his lack of formal training.
Sir Michael was advised to do some repertory work which led to two
45-week seasons with the Little Theatre, Bristol, and a meeting with
actress Eve Mortimer, whom he married in 1943.
With the outbreak of war he volunteered for the Navy and reached the
rank of Lieutenant Commander.
It was a performance as Chekov's Ivanov in the Arts Theatre, London,
that brought him his first critical acclaim.
The stage took up the largest portion of his time and he played some
of the wordiest parts in the language, from Shakespeare's Prospero and
Lear -- in which he played the lead three times -- to distracted George
in Tom Stoppard's Jumpers.
In all he appeared in more than 80 theatre productions and more than
60 film roles.
In 1972 he was awarded the CBE and he was knighted in 1983.
He made several memorable television appearances and his voice became
familiar to viewers through the many commercial voice-overs he did.
He also narrated the children's story Paddington Bear and made
recordings as Badger in Wind in the Willows.
Fishing was a passion for him. He had many fishing rods and hundreds
of flies which he made himself.
Such was his skill that a leading anglers' catalogue lists a Michael
Horden Nymph, which he regarded as a great accolade.

A #30,000 SOCIAL event ''in recognition of the efforts of staff'' is
being recommended for the employees of Aberdeen District Council's
contract services division (CSD), including cleansing workers who have
threatened to strike twice in the past six months.
The recommendation is contained in a confidential report that will be
discussed later this week.
The proposal was put forward by the Labour convener of the council's
contracting board, Councillor David Clyne, last October shortly after
the CSD controversially won a #23m five-year deal to keep the city
clean.
Tenders had been submitted for the contract five months earlier, but,
amid widespread speculation that the division's bid was not the lowest,
the council decided to ask for new tenders, saying that the initial
specification had not been clear enough.
In September the CSD's resubmitted tender was successful although
there was subsequent industrial unrest when it was revealed that not all
the workforce would be retained.
A strike was averted, but trouble flared again before Easter over
working hours. That too was resolved without a strike.
In October Mr Clyne proposed that in recognition of the staff efforts
within the division ''during recent months'' a staff social evening
should be organised with the division meeting the cost.
On Friday the contracting board will hear that the cost of the social
event will be around #30,000. The staff are expected to be asked whether
they would prefer a Caribbean-type night out or a family-type event.
The confidential report to the board, by Mr Ian Gerrie, the managing
director of the division, is understood by The Herald to indicate that
if a buffet supper dance with ''themed entertainment'' is held it might
have to be run on three evenings to accommodate all those wishing to
attend.
There are around 1500 CSD employees but it is believed only two-thirds
of them, plus their partners, might be expected to attend.
The estimated cost is #30,000, which would be charged to the revenue
account of the contract services division to be met from income derived
from their activities.
Last night Conservative group leader Councillor Michael Hastie said he
was unaware of the proposal and said: ''It is extremely badly timed to
say the least.'' He said he believed it a dangerous precedent to single
out one particular section of the staff when others might also be
identified as having done particularly good work.
''Also if the money is being used in this way it means it is not
available to provide services for the public as it would normally be.''
Mr Clyne could not be contacted for comment last night.

A SNAPSHOT view of the state of Strathclyde's environment was
published yesterday, showing it to be good in parts, improving in
others, but with problems remaining.
The report by the regional council is the first of 10 local authority
reports on environmental sustainability to appear since the Rio Earth
Summit of 1992.
Key findings are that:
* Drinking water and fresh water quality is good and improving.
* Bathing beaches fail to meet European Union standards.
* Air quality is variable with problems in areas of heavy traffic.
* There are still 8000 hectares of derelict land.
* Although 16% of land is designated as protected, for instance as
Sites of Special Scientific Interest, damage to such sites continues.
* Energy statistics for Scotland have dried up since privatisation of
the energy companies, leaving an urgent need for new data that only the
Government can provide.
* Only a tiny proportion of waste is recycled -- most goes to
landfill.
* Car ownership and usage are rising steadily, and public transport
use is declining.
* Most public sector housing stock is energy inefficient, contributing
to fuel poverty and unnecessary CO2 emissions.
* Asthma and other respiratory complaints, perhaps linked to air
quality, are rising.
Mr Iain MacDonald, chair of the council's environment working group,
said: ''The sustainability indicators report gives us a very honest
picture of exactly where we are in terms of achieving a sustainable
environment. The report does record some good practice, but it also
highlights areas where there are difficulties that will have to be
faced.
''Strathclyde Regional Council has worked hard on the environment
front to do as much as possible to promote environmental awareness and
effective environmental action within the council. The responsibility
for tackling environmental issues will pass to the new councils on April
1, 1996.
''How they will tackle them, both to build on the work that
Strathclyde has done and to answer the questions raised by our report,
will be one of the largest issues that they will face.''
Mr Adrian Shaw, environmental policy officer, said the council had
spent #700m on investing in a 15-year capital programme of sewage
treatment. It was therefore disappointing, he said, that the region's
bathing beaches had failed to meet European standards. The problem lay
with the failure of the Scottish Office to give capital consent for such
programmes, he added.

COMEDIAN Rik Mayall yesterday admitted he had behaved ''like a total
prat'' when he pointed a replica gun at a couple in a street.
The frightened couple told two patrolling policemen who called for an
armed response unit before tackling the unknown gunman and arresting
him.
The incident took place on March 18. Yesterday, after being given a
formal warning and freed by police, the 37-year-old stage and TV actor
said: ''I advise people not to wave guns about. I was very lucky not to
be shot.
''I have been a total prat. I could have been blown away.''
He added: ''The police are there to protect us all from people like
me.
''I have been completely stupid, even by my standards. I thank the
police for being so patient and apologise for wasting their time.''
Earlier, arriving at London's Holborn police station, Mayall told
waiting newsmen: ''I don't know what to expect in there, hanging
probably. I am very sorry about it.''
The incident took place in Endell Street, Covent Garden, after Mayall
had finished the evening performance of the Simon Gray play Cell Mates.
His original co-star Stephen Fry had fled after poor reviews and the
show was due to close the following week.
Mayall was with a woman walking home. He was carrying several props
from the play including the replica gun which he pointed at a young
couple in the street.
Police said the couple, who have not been named, were so frightened
they ran to the nearest beat policemen and reported the incident.
A police spokesman said an armed response unit was called but the two
young officers decided to approach Mayall and arrested him and his
companion.
Police said Mayall had been given a formal warning for threatening
behaviour likely to cause alarm or distress. The warning was
administered under the Public Order Act Section 5.
A police spokesman said it did not mean the comedian had been let off.
''Should he ever be arrested again this matter could come up,'' he
said.
''The two officers involved did not know who the man was. The man was
not treated any differently from anyone else but it was decided that a
warning would be appropriate.''
The spokesman added that the incident was described as ''the absurd
actions of an ill-conceived prank''.
The two officers have been recommended for a commendation for their
bravery.

The Duke of Atholl
THE Duke of Atholl, one of Scotland's richest men, is charging
visitors #5 to drive along 12 miles of a pot-holed road on his
Perthshire estate.
Last night, the Duke, whose fortune is estimated at #140m and who is
the only man in Britain entitled to maintain a private army, was accused
of cashing in on a six-part BBC series about one of his gamekeepers.
The Gamekeeper will be broadcast later this year and features Mr
Charlie Pirie, 43, who lives at Forest Lodge in Glen Tilt. The Duke is
charging to drive on the road -- several miles of which are dirt track
-- to Glen Tilt where the BBC spent weeks filming.
A sign at the road end advises motorists that they must now purchase a
#5 permit to drive on the road, either from the estate office or the
nearby caravan park.
News of the toll was greeted with outrage last night.
Mr Merv Rolfe, leader of the Labour group on Tayside Regional Council,
said on hearing the news: ''You must be joking. I've heard it all now.
''What century does this man think he is living in? It sounds to me
like he is cashing in on the BBC series. He never misses a trick. This
is a disgrace.''
Hillwalker and outdoor enthusiast, Mr Ian Thomson, of Muirtonbank,
Perth, said: ''I didn't realise His Grace was that hard up. He has a
fine cheek to be asking for money when the taxpayer is subsidising him
already.
''Aye, it's a free country all right -- until you arrive in Blair
Atholl, that is.''
The old-Etonian Duke is no stranger to controversy -- the row comes
the day after it emerged that a group of workers on an Adult Training
Scheme is to be provided at the taxpayers' expense to work on
restoration of an 18th century garden at Blair Castle.
The Duke clashed with ramblers' and hillwalkers' organisations last
year over rights of way on his estate and in 1993 was criticised for
applying for #300,000 in public grants to restore his gardens at Blair
Castle.
Earlier this year, he fell out with the leader of Tayside Regional
Council, Mr Ewan Dow, over an application for forestry grants. Mr Dow
was so upset by the Duke's application for #400,000 to plant mixed
woodland on part of the esate that he called for the introduction of a
means test to stop wealthy landowners qualifying for such assistance.
He was angry that the local authority had no choice but to support the
application for an area near the Falls of Bruar beauty spot because it
conformed to planning policy.
Mr Dow said at the time: ''Personally, I deplore the means tests which
are inflicted on the poorest and needy in our society. But this would
seem to be a case where there is a crying need for such a test.
''It is unfortunate that public bodies which want to support
environmentally-friendly tree planting have to consent to handing over
huge sums of public money to people who are fabulously wealthy.''
Blair Castle is Perthshire's top tourist attraction with 165,000
visitors last year. Charges are #5 for adults and #4 for children.
The 63-year-old bachelor Duke was in England and unavailable for
comment yesterday. His estate factor was also said to be ''away for the
day''.

<HEADLINE>Axe for nine hospitals and 1000 beds in community care scheme</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978583834</RECORDNO>

LOTHIAN Health Board yesterday unveiled a new community care strategy
which will radically alter its services for old people and the mentally
ill.
It will mean the phased closure of 1000 long-stay beds for the elderly
-- half its current provision -- and nine hospitals over the next five
years, as the emphasis shifts to care in the community with increased GP
support.
Board chairman Dr John Baynham, said the three months of public
consultation will allow changes to the details of the plans, but not to
the overall strategy.
''I do not believe that major principles will change. We are not going
out to negotiate with the public. These are national strategies, but we
will seek to modify the detail,'' he said.
The nine hospitals which will close -- including some already facing
closure as a result of the strategy for acute services -- are: The
Eastern General, City, Chalmers, Southfield, and Loanhead, all
Edinburgh; East Fortune, North Berwick; Rosslynlee, Midlothian; and
Bangour Village and Tippethill in West Lothian.
Mrs Phyllis Herriot, who chairs Lothian Health Council, said there was
widespread support for local hospitals and long-stay beds.
''This will totally transform our local NHS and affect everyone from
the young to the old,'' she said.
''The concerns put to us so far are just the tip of the iceberg, and
the health board will have to work hard to make sure it takes the people
with it.''
Dr Baynham said he understood there would be public concern about
community care, but this was mainly based on horror stories in England,
and different circumstances applied to Scotland.
''It is not going to be easy because it is a major leap in society's
understanding. Many people went into these institutions because society
did not want to know,'' he said.
Labour MP for Edinburgh Central, Mr Alistair Darling, said: ''The
Government wants to save money in the NHS budget and, frankly, does not
give a damm who picks up the pieces.
''You simply cannot afford to lose 1000 NHS beds in Lothian. What has
to be rammed home to these people is that alternative places do not
exist, and all the time the elderly population and the need for
long-term care is rising dramatically.''
However, Dr Baynham insisted no patient would be moved until
appropriate services were provided in the community, and that all
transfers would be based on professional assessments.
He said the board's budget would remain the same, but it would be
channelled to the community. Transitional funding would be available as
hospitals closed, and the acute hospital plans would free an extra #10m
a year for community care.
The board's planning director, Dr Lindsay Burley, said the plans had
been drawn up with active involvement of all professional bodies and
interested parties.
The plans envisage major investment in general practice staff and
buildings, and new, small community hospitals in Edinburgh and
Midlothian.
All GPs, including non-fundholders, will be involved in locality
purchasing of services, but this could cause conflict with the Scottish
NHS chief executive, Mr Geoff Scaife, who has dismissed the concept as
an alternative to fundholding.

THE parents of murdered Glasgow girl Christina Menzies have been asked
by the Prime Minister to contribute to the Government's review of the
courts martial system, after Mr Major promised he would take up their
case.
Staff Sergeant John Menzies and his wife Christine spent 20 minutes
yesterday with Mr Major in his Commons office. They detailed what they
claim is a catalogue of Army blunders which resulted in the acquittal of
the man they claim carried out the murder.
Mr Major's decision to involve himself, and the speed with which a
meeting was arranged is being interpreted at Westminster as an implicit
rebuke of the Army for its handling of the trial and its aftermath.
Christina's body was found outside a British military base in Germany
in 1993. The soldier accused of the murder was found not guilty by a
court martial last year and set free. He is still serving in the Royal
Logistical Corps.
The case has been taken up by the Menzies's MP, Mr George Galloway. In
March, he used parliamentary privilege in the Commons to name the
soldier acquitted and accuse him of the murder.
Yesterday, the Hillhead MP said the meeting with Mr Major had been the
greatest encouragement the Menzies had received since they walked into
his constituency surgery six months ago.
''I knew then something awful had happened to them from their faces.
Their faces are a very different affair today,'' he said.
According to Mr Galloway, Mr Major told the Menzies he would
investigate the points they raised. In addition, he asked for their
thoughts on the courts martial review -- promised by Ministers under
pressure from Mr Galloway -- to be passed to him personally.
Mr Galloway also said the Prime Minister had ''volunteered to see if
the original court case could be declared a nullity''. A nullity applies
to courts martial and amounts to the verdict being overturned.
However, a Downing Street spokesman appeared to contradict the account
last night. Mr Major had only said a retrial would require the original
trial to be declared a nullity, and that he understood there were no
grounds for that to happen.
But by promising to look at the Menzies's detailed concerns, he has
raised hopes that the verdict might be re-examined. Yesterday the
Menzies praised the way Mr Major responded.
Mr Menzies said he had shown concern, and that they were optimistic.
''It's the first bit of compassion we've had from anyone in officialdom
we've seen in this case.''
Mrs Menzies said: ''While he couldn't understand what we were feeling,
he said he's at the beginning of understanding because he has teenage
children himself.''
The family raised a number of instances in which they claim mistakes
by the military police and the Army prosecutors cast doubts on the court
martial's outcome. These include the military police's failure to
caution the accused when he was first questioned, and the court's
failure to use a Bible to administer the oath.
They also claim the Army was insensitive in the way it handled matters
after the murder. The family was billed for #180 to transport
Christina's body back to Scotland, and the family was subsequently told
this is standard procedure. Staff Sgt Menzies's commanding officer
eventually paid the bill.

<HEADLINE>Aslef action could halt Scottish rail services</HEADLINE>

THE train drivers' union Aslef is to ballot Glasgow members on strike
action over claims that management failed to follow proper procedure
when introducing new rest-day rules.
Union officials claim that the move follows increasingly
confrontational tactics by management.
If the ballot at Glasgow Queen Street backs industrial action, the
station could grind to a halt, affecting services throughout Scotland.
Mr Pat O'Connor, Scottish secretary of Aslef, said there had been a
series of disputes with rail managers and, in the past six months,
ScotRail bosses had taken a harder line on dress standards.
In the past fortnight, they had been sending out letters warning train
drivers to comply with a strict dress code, which included a ban on
wearing Aslef ties, or face disciplinary action.
A simmering dispute about changing the rules regarding rest days has
also come to a head this week. The union was not strictly opposed to the
change, but claims management failed to follow proper procedures by
imposing the change without proper consultation. The UK national
executive endorsed a ballot on Monday.
Mr O'Connor said: ''It looks as though management are trying to
antagonise staff into a dispute.
''Our view is that they are trying to frighten companies interested in
buying ScotRail after privatisation so that a management buyout has more
chance of success. Industrial action would create the impression that
staff are unhappy.''
Up to 140 drivers will be balloted on whether they are prepared to
participate in 24-hour stoppages at Queen Street station. Union
officials are due to meet members on Sunday to gauge the strength of
feeling.
Trains from Queen Street run to most Scottish destinations and include
the vast majority of services in the central belt. Routes include the
Edinburgh shuttle and services to Aberdeen, Inverness, Stirling, Perth
and the Highlands.
But Mr O'Connor warned that the dispute could spread further. He said
more than 160 drivers at the Yoker depot in Glasgow were facing up to a
possible confrontation.
They claim ScotRail is running a bank holiday service on VE Day, with
fewer trains running. Yet a full complement of staff must turn up for
duty -- even though many will not be required to work. He added that
those who do not work do not qualify for a #9 driver's bonus.
He said: ''The only people who are going to suffer through all this
are members of the public. But if management want a fight, they've got a
fight.''
A spokeswoman for ScotRail admitted that a strike at Queen Street
could be damaging and the priority would be to keep services operating,
possibly by using staff from other stations. She added that a
confrontation was ''exactly the opposite'' of what the organisation
wanted.
The rest rule change had been brought in to protect staff from losing
days in lieu if a new operator took charge after privatisation. She
added: ''We believe there has been full consultation at every level. We
will look very seriously at their claims that there has not been
consultation, but expect them to produce evidence.''
She denied there had been a more heavy-handed implementation of the
dress code, but added that there were problems enforcing it with ''one
or two individuals out of 4000 staff''.
The spokeswoman said the problems at Yoker had arisen because ScotRail
staff had been given a bank holiday on May 1 but the Strathclyde
Passenger Transport Executive (SPTE) holiday was May 8. Since SPTE is
Yoker's main customer, rail managers had been forced to run a reduced
service and use fewer drivers, she said.
She said: ''ScotRail does not have any trains or track -- our only
asset is our staff and the last thing we want to do is encourage a
conflict.''

STRATHCLYDE region and the teachers' unions have reached agreement on
a package of measures aimed at ensuring that teachers are not overloaded
by work that gets in the way of teaching and learning.
It will be put to the authority's education committee today for
approval by councillors.
Strathclyde region's director of education, Mr Frank Pignatelli, said:
''It would be easy, but wrong, to see this report as the work of a
vested interest group who consider they have workload problems.''
He gave a commitment that the authority would deal with the issues
identified by the comprehensive review of workload that preceded the
report. Strathclyde would, he said, do everything in its power to remind
external agencies such as the Scottish Office Education Department and
the Scottish Vocational Education Council, as well as the authority's
headteachers, not to overload teachers.
More than 1600 teachers were involved in the region's review which,
said Mr Pignatelli, confirmed that assessing, recording, and reporting
pupils' work was the key workload issue, not administrative burdens,
which the Educational Institute of Scotland said were the biggest
problem.
''We have to get away from teachers going round with a check list and
the mentality in the profession of putting everything a child does down
on paper. We have some control over assessment, recording, and
reporting, and teachers should be allowed to make professional
judgments,'' said Mr Pignatelli.
Indiscipline emerged as a matter of growing concern and, says the
report, a working party should be set up to investigate the problem.
It also calls for a review of staffing levels to take account of
pressures coming from new teaching methods and assessment techniques.
The region should also produce a simplified form for reporting pupil
progress to parents.
The report mentions the Higher Still blueprint for upper secondary
schooling only in passing. The EIS is boycotting the reform.

<HEADLINE>Caution for West case policewoman</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978583838</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A CHIEF constable has given a formal caution to a woman detective who
had contact with a literary agent about a book of her life in the wake
of the Frederick West murder inquiry.
The matter involving DC Hazel Savage, 50, arose from ''an error of
judgment and a degree of naivety'', said Mr Tony Butler of
Gloucestershire police.
He was announcing his decision to give a caution to Mrs Savage, who
was found guilty last week at an internal disciplinary hearing over her
alleged discreditable conduct. She is considering an appeal to the Home
Office.
The hearing followed an internal investigation after a national
newspaper report that Mrs Savage, who has 30 years police service, had
touted her life story for sale in a #1m deal.
It is believed she had a key role in the Cromwell Street murder
investigation which began at the end of February last year.
Her role has never been revealed but it is understood she was involved
in interviewing builder Frederick West, who later stood accused of 12
murder counts, including those of his first wife, his daughter, and a
stepdaughter.
The allegations concerning Mrs Savage were also referred to the
independent Police Complaints Authority for supervision.
She had been found guilty last week of discreditable conduct by the
chief constable of the neighbouring West Mercia force, Mr David Blakey,
at a private hearing. The matter was referred back to Mr Butler, the
chief constable of Gloucestershire, for action.
At his headquarters today Mr Butler said the caution had been formally
made to the woman detective. She was not present at the media
conference.
He disclosed that the detective was nearing retirement in the spring
of last year and considered the possibility of writing a book on her
career. She had discussions with a literary agent when her involvement
in the alleged Cromwell Street murders was raised.
But after two meetings she decided, after taking independent legal
advice, not to take the matter further. She paid for that advice
herself.
She made clear in writing to the agent that she was not proceeding
further. That letter was some seven months before the newspaper
allegation.
Mr Butler said: ''It is important to point out that no confidential
information was disclosed by DC Savage during the discussions. No money
was received by DC Savage.''
He said it was wholly accepted that there was no intention to bring
discredit upon her force.
Mr Butler added: ''This was an unfortunate but single event which
should be seen in the context of a distinguished career of more than 30
years in public service.''
Mrs Savage received the MBE for her police work in this year's New
Year's honours list. But after the allegations into her alleged conduct,
she was taken off the Cromwell Street inquiry team and is now believed
to be working in the intelligence unit.
John Lane, Gloucestershire secretary of the Police Federation, said
the detective was held in great esteem and respect after 30 years'
distinguished service. She had five commendations.
Since 1993 she had been considering writing about her police
experiences. But involvement in the West inquiry caused her to
reappraise the situation.
With the victims' families and the reputation of the force in mind,
she took legal advice on any implications that the inquiry might have in
a possible autobiography.
Fred West, 53, was accused of murdering 12 girls and women, including
his first wife Catherine and two daughters, Heather and Charmaine. He
was found hanged in his prison cell at Winson Green Jail, Birmingham, on
New Year's Day.
His wife Rosemary, 41, faces 10 murder charges, and is due to stand
trial at Winchester Crown Court in October.

A WOMAN was killed in an accident involving an all-terrain vehicle on
a farm near Dornoch, in Sutherland, yesterday.
Mrs Bridget MacGillivray, 50, who ran the Dornoch Lochans angling
ponds at Davochfin farm with her husband, Malcolm, was found dead in a
barn by an American visitor. She had suffered serious head injuries.
Police said last night the incident was being treated as an accident
and there were no suspicious circumstances.
No details of the accident were given.
News of the death was not released until Mrs MacGillivray's son,
Angus, a 25-year-old officer with the Black Watch in Northern Ireland,
and daughter, Claire, 28, had been informed.
Northern Constabulary CID officers were called to the farm, two miles
west of Dornoch. Their report will be submitted to the procurator-fiscal
at Dornoch.
The MacGillivrays, who bought Davochfin 10 years ago after farming at
Kildonan, north of Helmsdale, decided to take advantage of rural
diversification three years ago and convert low-lying wetlands into
fishing ponds on a 15-acre site.
They created four ponds covering about five acres and had plans for a
golf range and other sporting activities.
The easy angling proved a big attraction for youngsters on holiday in
the area. Mrs MacGillivray took charge of the admission and fish
checking, while her husband, a former Army major, continued working the
rest of their farm.

Mountain rescuers last night found the body of a man, believed to be a
climber reported missing, on Lochnagar on Royal Deeside. Police had been
alerted by a firm that an employee, known to have been hill-walking on
Sunday, had failed to turn up for work. The missing man's car was later
found in a local car park.

THE man selected to fill Scotland's top local government post, at a
salary of #96,000-a-year, had to sit in a public corridor of Glasgow's
City Chambers for nearly 50 minutes yesterday, while senior councillors
argued about confirming his appointment.
Mr John Anderson, 47, currently depute chief executive of Strathclyde
region, was selected as chief executive of the new Glasgow unitary
authority last week, with the selection panel split 5-4 between him and
Glasgow district's town clerk, Mr Tom Monaghan, 48.
District councillors were infuriated by the decision. They fear a
regional takeover at the City Chambers, given that Strathclyde's Labour
leader, Councillor Robert Gould, had already been elected Labour group
leader of the new authority.
Angry district councillors had threatened to have the decision
altered, despite the fact that the selection panel had been given
delegated powers to make an appointment.
At yesterday's private meeting of the Labour group executive, they
succeeded in making waves. Councillor Gould apparently opened
proceedings by referring to an agenda item on the appointment of the new
chief executive.
He explained that Mr Anderson was available and he was proposing to
bring that item forward to the top of the agenda and introduce him to
the meeting.
Mr Anderson was brought in, but a member of the executive claimed not
to have heard this proposition put to the meeting. He insisted that Mr
Anderson should leave the room while he raised a number of concerns
about the circumstances of the appointment.
Embarrassingly, Mr Anderson had to leave the room and he remained
outside in the council corridor for almost 50 minutes while his
appointment was discussed.
The issue of Councillor Gould having been one of Mr Anderson's
referees was raised, but the response was that it was common for council
leaders to be referees in this type of situation.
Then a conflict between district and region started to emerge, with
district members fearing Mr Anderson's appointment would mean the
development of a highly-centralised bureaucracy alien to the City
Chambers.
However, the would-be dissenters were vigorously reminded that it
would be outrageous for the interviews to be re-run in front of a Labour
group.
Councillor Gould said afterwards: ''The executive received a report
from the selection panel, and Mr John Anderson was confirmed as the
Chief Executive of the new City Council.''
Commenting on the fury with which the appointment was greeted last
Friday, Councillor Gould said: ''I was disappointed at some of the
comments from my colleagues.''
But he added: ''I'd be disappointed if Tom Monaghan wasn't placed
within the operation of this council. If he'd been appointed chief
executive I'd have had no problem with that.''

THE best laid schemes of mice and Rupert Murdoch . . . sometimes don't
work out according to plan.
Having put the fear of God into the broadcasting industry by adding
his weight to a bid for the Channel Five licence, the media tycoon
emerged yesterday as the financial also-ran in the race for the new
service.
New Century Television, a powerful business grouping which includes
Granada, Polygram, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Company, and
Murdoch's BSkyB, lodged a bid of just #2m for the franchise, a figure
which appears paltry when compared to the other three contenders.
The highest bid came from UK TV Developments, a group led by the
Canadian-based Canwest Group and a last-minute dark horse in the race.
It pitched #36m for the licence and must now be regarded as the
favourite. A consortium led by Richard Branson's Virgin Group and
another led by the Pearson Group both bid just over #22m, leading some
observers to suggest that, at some stage in the proceedings, someone had
''compared notes''.
New Century Television's bid, which was expected to be the highest by
far, puzzled media analysts. The auction rules of the Independent
Television Commission state that the licence must go to the highest
bidder, provided quality and business plan thresholds are met. This
would appear to rule out NCT as a serious contender.
However, a spokesman for the group said: ''You have to bear in mind
that there are two major outgoings. The first is the huge national
operation which will involve re-tuning video sets, and we estimate that
that will cost more than #100m. Secondly, there is the cost required to
provide a quality service in terms of programming.
''We have concluded that the correct economic bid is #2m per annum and
that is because we believe there are huge costs involved.'' It would, he
added, have been ''irresponsible'' to bid any higher.
Channel Four's chief executive Michael Grade, who last week warned of
the dangers of allowing Mr Murdoch a foothold in UK terrestrial
television, immediatly expressed his relief at the low bid -- though he
did say that #2m was about the right price to pay. However, he expected
that it would not halt the media mogul's British ambitions.
All eyes must now turn upon Canwest which, if it fulfils the quality
and economic thresholds, should automatically take control of Channel
Five. However, the race may not be quite as cut and dried as the figures
suggest.
The consortium also includes Australia's Network 10 (which Canwest
controls) and Scandinavian Broadcasting Systems. Indeed, the only
British connection comes through SelecTV, an independent production
house which makes lightweight comedies such as Birds of a Feather,
Goodnight Sweetheart, and Shine On Harvey Moon.
Mr Greg Dyke, who is spearheading the rival Pearson Group bid, said
that a #36m offer was ''impossible.'' They could never make a return on
that investment.
Canwest, the largest privately owned broadcaster in Canada, insisted
it could make money and still offer a high quality schedule.
Nevertheless, industry insiders speculated that its huge bid could tie
up so much cash that the quality of its programming would be adversely
affected.
If the Canwest bid were to fall it would be a straight contest on
programme quality between Pearson and Virgin. Pearson, which also
includes Thames Television and Lord Hollick's MAI Group, has promised a
new five-day-a-week soap, new drama programmes, a Saturday night
entertainment special, and an emphasis on three new documentary strands.
Virgin, meanwhile, has pledged 1000 hours of new and original drama,
1000 films a year, and annual commissions for a dozen new British films.
The new channel, which is to be entertainments-based, should start up
on January 1, 1997. It will reach about 70% of British households. Areas
which will miss out include the Highlands and certain parts of the South
of England.

THE Labour Party has promised to publish a dossier this week
containing private correspondence between Scottish Secretary Ian Lang
and franchise director Roger Salmon which will allegedly show Government
deceit over the axing of the Fort William sleeper services.
Labour's Shadow Transport Minister Henry McLeish said yesterday this
would also include detailed figures for all sleeper/Motorail services,
including the levels of subsidy.
These would reinforce the findings of Edinburgh-based consultants
Pieda published yesterday which found that the subsidy was #70 per
passenger and not the figures of #180, #453, and #540 variously quoted
by the Government and the British Railways board.
Mr McLeish said: ''I welcome the Pieda report and its exposure of
Government duplicity on subsidy figures for the Fort William sleeper.
The report makes it quite clear that the franchise director, British
Rail, and the Government are conspiring to con the public by lying over
the real cost of maintaining this service.''
Highland region vice-convener Peter Peacock said: ''We requested these
figures from the franchise director some weeks ago. It is now clear that
the powers that be have been secretive about them because they knew they
would not stand up to public scrutiny.''
Following the Pieda report there were fresh demands yesterday that the
Government and the British Railways board should ensure that the
threatened service continues to run throughout the summer to allow
proper consultation.
Ross, Cromarty and Skye MP Charles Kennedy said: ''This authoritative
analysis blows to bits the misleading claims and downright deception of
Ministers.
''It confirms that they have systematically sought to rig the figures
in such a way as to render these services unviable. Now that they are
exposed they should come clean, order the continuation of the services
beyond the end of this month, and allow a proper consultation.''
However, a Department of Transport spokeswoman insisted: ''It is not
correct to say that there will be no consultation. That will begin after
the publication of the passenger service requirement for ScotRail.'' The
service did not require to be running for there to be consultation.
She said the decision to withdraw the service had been taken by the
British Railways board and not the Department of Transport.
A spokesman for the board said he could make no comment on the Pieda
report until it had been properly analysed. A ScotRail spokeswoman,
however, said: ''We have studied the Pieda report and it still makes
clear that some level of subsidy is necessary to maintain the service.
''ScotRail has always said that if somebody pays the necessary subsidy
we will be more than happy to run the service. That remains our
position.''

POLICE were last night trying to piece together a murder victim's
final four days, following the discovery of his body dumped in a field
in Kirkliston, West Lothian, on Monday afternoon.
Mr Robert Higgins, 34, a factory worker at Marshall Foods, was last
seen leaving his work at Newbridge, West Lothian, last Thursday.
Forensic experts were yesterday combing the woodland area and roadside
verges near Craig's Quarry, where the body was found.
The murder has stunned locals in Mr Higgins' home village of Dalmeny,
near South Queensferry, where he lived with his mother.
Dectective Superintendent John McGowan said: ''We are appealing to
anyone who saw Mr Higgins or was in his company in the past four days to
get in touch with us. He left work last Thursday and was not due to
return there until Monday.''
Mr Higgins, a bachelor, is believed to have been a regular in a number
of local pubs in South Queensferry, Broxburn, and Kirkliston.
Yesterday, his mother Agnes was being comforted by family and friends.
Local sub-postmistress, Mrs Betty Hardie, said: ''Everyone around here
is in a state of shock. No-one can believe it.
''Robert lived in Dalmeny all his life. Everyone here knew him as a
gentle, quiet man. He was always polite and no-one had a bad word to say
about him. He certainly wasn't the sort to make enemies.''
Mr Higgins is described as approximately 5ft 9in, of slim build, with
a pale complexion.

SCOTLAND'S passenger rail link with Europe through the Channel Tunnel
will be launched in two months' time, its operator announced yesterday.
The new service will connect Edinburgh to Paris and Brussels from July
3, running Monday to Saturday, said European Passenger Services (EPS),
the UK arm of Eurostar.
However, until an unspecified date next year, Scottish passengers face
having to change trains at Waterloo station in London, entailing a short
walk and a wait of about 90 minutes.
That delay means the travel time from Edinburgh to either Paris or
Brussels will be more than 10 hours, whereas when the direct service
begins EPS hopes to cut the journey to around eight hours.
The Scottish link, using diesel 125 trains chartered from InterCity,
will leave Edinburgh at 9.15am, calling at Newcastle, Darlington, York,
Doncaster, Newark and Peterborough, and arriving at Waterloo at 2.45pm.
Passengers will then have to transfer to one of the main Eurostar
expresses, which leave London at 4.23pm. They reach Paris or Brussels
about three hours later.
Return trains will leave both Continental capitals about 9am, arriving
back in Edinburgh about 7.30pm.
An EPS spokesman said Scottish ticket prices had not yet been
determined. Return fares from London to Paris range from #84 to #195.
He accepted that business travellers were unlikely to be attracted by
a 10-hour journey time.
When the full Scottish link is launched next year, the daily service
will start in Glasgow, before travelling to Edinburgh and down the east
coast line. It will be supplemented by an overnight service from
Glasgow, taking about 13 hours and using the west coast line.
Meanwhile, EPS yesterday unveiled an #8m advertising campaign to get
more travellers to use the Channel Tunnel in the summer season, and said
it would increase the number of Eurostar trains operating from London to
Paris and Brussels later this month.

BY Patsy's standards, it was a sober occasion, but of course a
''bottle of Bolli'' awaited after Joanna Lumley, star of Absolutely
Fabulous, celebrated her OBE at Buckingham Palace yesterday.
''Even Patsy would have been knocked out,'' she said. ''I feel very
flattered, excited, and extremely proud.''
Jennifer Saunders, who writes and co-stars in the hit TV show as the
manic Edina, joined in the celebrations at a party after the Palace
investiture: which is where the Bollinger champagne, Patsy's favourite
tipple, was on ice.
The 49-year-old actress starred as New Avengers girl Purdey in 1976,
having made a lesser-known appearance in 1973 on Coronation Street as
Ken Barlow's posh girlfriend.
Last month, her role in the BBC's Absolutely Fabulous won her an award
from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) as best
comedy actress.
Born in Kashmir, in the Himalayas, where her father was an officer in
the Gurkha Rifles, she was educated at a convent in Hastings, East
Sussex and sought a career as a fashion model.
However, her talents extended beyond the catwalk. She soon made a name
on the stage, and became an accomplished writer: she has been a Times
columnist and has written three books. She is also a Fellow of the Royal
Geographic Society.
* Delia Smith the cookery writer also received an OBE.
* Before the investiture, Mrs Wendy Hadley received the Queen's
Gallantry Medal, awarded to her late son. Mr Shaun Hadley, a Sheffield
builder, was killed as he attempted to disarm a gunman who held police
at bay after firing through the window of a patrol car, injuring two
officers inside.

POLICE expressed their anger yesterday after a youth who shot a
service station attendant in the head was given what one officer
described as a ''lenient'' sentence.
John McGill, 19, raised a finger to the officers who had risked their
lives to arrest him. He smiled and waved to relatives after having been
ordered to be detained for six years in a Young Offenders' Institution.
A row broke out after the Crown accepted McGill's plea of not guilty
to attempting to murder his victim and to six other charges at the High
Court in Glasgow.
He admitted a reduced charge of accidentally shooting the attendant
''to his injury''.
His victim, Mr William McKeirnan, has a shotgun pellet lodged in his
skull, four months after the shooting, the court heard. Surgeons at
Glasgow's Royal Infirmary have left it in the hope it will safely
surface.
A charge that McGill allegedly threatened seven policemen with the
shotgun before shooting a police dog was also dropped by the Crown.
McGill, of Cardowan Road, Carntyne, Glasgow, has been in trouble with
the law since the age of 10, the court heard.
The police were not called to give evidence yesterday after McGill
pleaded guilty to presenting a repeater shotgun at Mr McKeirnan and
''discharging it at him to his injury''.
Advocate depute Paul McBride told how PC Robert Hunter arrested McGill
with a flying rugby-tackle.
One of the policemen said: ''The memory of looking down the barrel of
McGill's shotgun will live with me for life.
''It is wrong that he should not have been put on trial. McGill was
obviously delighted with his lenient sentence.''
Mr McBride told Lord Abernethy of McGill's bungled armed robbery at
the Vogue Service Station shop in Cumbernauld Road, Riddrie, Glasgow, on
January 11.
As Mr McKeirnan moved to phone police, McGill's gun went off and he
was hit in the skull and the back.
Mr McBride told Lord Abernethy: ''The Crown accept McGill did not
attempt to murder his victim, and that he accepts full responsibility in
law for his actions.''
He said 20 minutes after the raid police found McGill in the street
with the shotgun and PC Hunter tackled him.
A court official said: ''The Crown may have taken the view that McGill
would only have received eight years and therefore saved a four-day
trial by accepting his pleas.''
Later, Mr Tom Rowatt, of Strathclyde branch of the Scottish Police
Federation, said: ''How can it be regarded as in any sense accidental
that this young man was in a service station with a weapon?
''We can appreciate that there are great pressures on time and finance
in the courts, and the possibility is there that the evidence might not
have been completely water-tight, but in these circumstances it causes
the police to despair when charges are bargained down in such a
manner.''

MAIL deliveries across central Scotland faced further disruption today
after hundreds of postal and sorting staff voted to stay out on strike
for a third day.
Communications Workers' Union official John Keggie said 600 staff in
Edinburgh had taken the decision at a stormy meeting, during which
workers threw coins and beermats at him when he recommended they return
to work.
He was relaying advice from the union's national executive to call off
the unofficial strike action.
''It was a very aggressive meeting, in which they threw things at me
and they have decided to stay out.
''I was carrying out the national instructions, but they unanimously
rejected it and unless management now change their attitude, they could
be out indefinitely,'' he said.
The union was last night awaiting the outcome of similar meetings in
other areas.
Mr John Mackay, Director and General Manager of Royal Mail Scotland,
last night branded yesterday's action ''irresponsible'' and appealed to
staff to return to work.
''Further industrial action in defiance of their own union would be
plain crazy. I do hope anyone contemplating staying out thinks of the
adverse effect on our customers and then thinks again about their job
security and the future of Royal Mail,'' he said.
Mr Mackay added that Royal Mail was seeking urgent clarification of
the situation from the CWU and if unofficial industrial action again
disrupted the mail, the company would be forced to consider the legal
position and contingency measures.
More than 2000 mail workers walked out yesterday morning when they
returned to work after a 24-hour strike, over the move to change the
annual May Day holiday to May 8 to mark VE Day, and were told to work to
different delivery patterns to cope with the backlog.
The CWU claimed members were disciplined after refusing to adopt new
working procedures for dealing with heavy volumes of mail.
No mail deliveries were made across the central belt, including
Glasgow, Edinburgh, Paisley, Ayr and Fife, and in Inverness for the
second day running.
Glasgow's main Post Office in George Square was also affected when
post office staff refused to cross a picket line, organised by mail
staff and postmen. The office reopened at about 12.30pm, when the picket
was moved.
A Royal Mail and Post Office spokesman said only 17% of the workforce
had taken part in the second day of strike action and that mail
deliveries had been unaffected in other parts of Scotland, including
Aberdeen and Tayside.
The spokesman claimed that yesterday's procedure to clear the backlog
in mail was ''well tried and tested'' and no different to normal
practice after Christmas, holidays and other situations.
''It will be outrageous if people have not had any mail for the third
day running in the central belt,'' he said.
Mr Liam Murphy, of the CWU, earlier warned: ''Our members are really
angry. We can advise them to go back, but they may not listen.''
Mail bosses had last week informed the union of the change in working
practices to clear the backlog after the 24-hour strike on Monday, he
said.
''They were told by union representatives that there was no agreement
for that. Management were well warned of just exactly what the situation
would be if they proceeded with the new working practice. This strike
has been orchestrated by Royal Mail,'' said Mr Murphy.

THE Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, last night appeared to contradict
Mr John Major's assertion that he had been reviewing the tax treatment
of mortgage protection policies for months.
''It's an obscure piece of tax law which I didn't know about until
half past eleven this morning,'' Mr Clarke said.
His comment conflicted with Mr Major's earlier claim in the Commons
when he said: ''I can confirm that My Right Honourable Friend has been
reviewing for some months the tax treatment of mortgage protection
policies.''
This was taken to be a reference to the Chancellor.
Labour called for an immediate explanation of the apparent
contradiction from the Prime Minister and questioned whether there had
ever been a review.
Mr Clarke's stark admission came when he was challenged by reporters
over the Government's extraordinary U-turn on taxing mortgage protection
insurance pay-outs.
Earlier he had been forced to rush out an emergency statement
announcing that payments made under such policies would be exempt from
tax.
It followed the disclosure of Government advice issued to mortgage
lenders stating that the payments would be taxable -- which raised fears
that millions of homeowners could be hit if they lost their jobs or were
unable to work.
Last night Mr Clarke dismissed the claim he had done a U-turn over the
tax.
''No, I just sorted out some complete nonsense about a supposed tax
that never was,'' he said.
Asked why party chairman Jeremy Hanley had not known about the review
of the tax, Mr Clarke replied: ''Well, because it's an obscure piece of
tax law which I didn't know about until half past eleven this morning,
and having discovered what they were talking about, simply sorted it all
out.
''It's all nonsense.''
Challenged again later, Mr Clarke said: ''It's not a serious story.
There never was a tax.''
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said last night: ''After telling Tony
Blair today that the Chancellor had been reviewing this for some months,
the Prime Minister must now explain immediately why the Chancellor of
the Exchequer knew nothing about it.''
Labour leader Tony Blair confronted the Prime Minister in the Commons
yesterday with a devastating accusation that the muddle is further
evidence that the Government has been reduced to an ''utterly chaotic
shambles''. Mr Blair's attack was so compulsive that the Prime Minister
was obliged to state that such considerations had been abandoned.
The timescale of the Government's decision-taking yesterday confirmed
Mr Blair's accusation of a shambles. At 10am Mr Brown pledged that
Labour would force a vote on the issue. Half an hour later Mr Stephen
Dorrell, a Cabinet Minister, told a news conference there had been no
Government proposal to change this tax law. At 11am Downing Street was
briefing that the policy was still under review.
At three minutes past noon Tory back bencher Nicholas Winterton
described the policy as ''nuts, lunacy, madness'' and threatened to vote
against the Government if Labour forced a vote.
At 12.42pm the Chancellor issued a statement that the review had been
abandoned and it would not feature in his Budget statement in the
autumn.
On April 27 Financial Secretary Sir George Young had told Mr Winterton
in a Commons written answer: ''There will be no entitlement to Income
Support in respect of mortgage interest payments for a period of nine
months for new borrowers. Benefits, paid under mortgage protection
insurance policies that provide cover for this period are not liable to
tax, provided that the maximum period during which benefits can be paid
does not exceed one year.''
This answer contradicted a leaked Treasury note dated March 10
indicating that benefits received under such policies would be taxable
where the benefits can be paid for more than a year. On April 19 the
Council of Mortgage Lenders wrote to Sir George protesting against this
policy.
Last night a Treasury spokesman said the matter had gone to Sir George
some weeks ago. ''The Financial Secretary had a look at it and had put
recommendations in a note to the Chancellor last week when the
Chancellor was in Washington.
''The Chancellor hadn't got round to looking at it, but he would have
done it shortly.''
The timing of all this two days ahead of the local elections when the
Tories are already bracing themselves for further humiliation threatened
a catastrophe out of a disaster.

SINN Fein leader Gerry Adams has been banned from launching his book,
Free Ireland, at the House of Commons 24 hours before the Queen makes
her VE-Day address on Friday.
Speaker Betty Boothroyd yesterday refused permission for him to use a
room adjacent to Westminster Hall. She said it was ''not appropriate''.
The red carpets are already rolled out for the Queen and security
arrangements have been changed to allow easy access by all the
dignitaries for the Friday ceremony. Mr Adams would have been walking on
those red carpets to get to the room where he had planned to launch his
book.
The Speaker's decision was made despite Mr Major's meeting with church
leaders today in Belfast and Londonderry, and the peace process's first
talks between a Government Minister and Sinn Fein.
Northern Ireland Minister Michael Ancram is to meet Mr Adams's deputy,
Mr Martin McGuinness, next Wednesday in Stormont for their opening round
of talks, which will focus strongly on the handing over of IRA weapons.
Next week Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew, is scheduled
to begin his bilateral talks aiming eventually for a constitutional
settlement with the leaders of all the established parties in Ulster.
Mr Adams, sponsored by a Labour left winger, Mr Jeremy Corbyn, was set
to use the Jubilee Room adjacent to the 900-year-old Westminster Hall
which is to be used by the Queen.
To allow this the Commons security arrangements have had to be changed
and the prospect of Mr Adams using the Jubilee Room for a commercial
venture to launch his book was considered to be wrong.
The announcement by the Speaker was condemned by Sinn Fein. A party
spokesman said there had been book launches at the Commons before, and
added: ''If it is all right for one person it should be all right for
another.''
Speaker Boothroyd announced her decision prompted by a question from a
Tory back bencher, Mr Barry Porter, a Unionist supporter.
The position of the Jubilee Room, which can be reached only through
Westminster Hall, is particularly inappropriate for Mr Adams. An IRA
bomb blast still scars the walls of Westminster Hall.
Mr Major travelled last night to Northern Ireland at the invitation of
the CBI. As well as promoting the peace process amongst churchmen, Mr
Major will emphasise the economic prosperity that is flowing into
Northern Ireland since the ceasefire.
The visit is an important one. He is meeting the leaders of the four
main churches, anti-intimidation campaigners, trade unionists, and the
CBI. In Londonderry he is due for talks with community leaders and local
political representatives at a function which will be open to the city's
five Sinn Fein councillors.

THE value of houses sold in the West of Scotland is 2.97% less than 12
months ago, according to the latest statistics from the Glasgow
Solicitors Property Centre. The 144 members of the consortium, which was
set up some 18 months ago, sold a total of #27m of property during the
first quarter of this year at an average price of #50,558 - almost 3%
lower than the same period in 1994.
GSPC executive director Mike Graham said: ''Although these results
could have been more encouraging, there are some positive indications
for the first-time buyers' market.
''The number of terraced villas is up by almost 20%, with average
prices increasing to #48,667. The number of flats sold has increased
too, and the average is up from #38,682 to #39,299 - a rise of just over
1.5%.''
The biggest fall in prices among prperties sold by GSPC was in the
detached vilas and bungalow sector, where 1994's average of #97,950
slumped to #92,220 this year - a fall of 5.85%. Semi-detached houses and
bungalows fell by 2.21%.
Based on market research carried out every six months by
Edinburgh-based George Street Research, GSPC now claims a 25% share of
the Glasgow home sales market.
Chairman Frank McCormick said: ''During our first calendar year, sales
topped #134m. Yet there are those with whom we compete still naive
enough to think we'll give up and go away. These are the folk who said
barely two years ago that a solictors' property centre couldn't work in
Glasgow and the West.''
However, that market share looks less dramatic when divided by the 144
members of the GSPC. The #27m total sales, at an average selling price
of #50,558, for the first quarter of this year means that some 534
houses were sold in total. Divide that by 144 members of the GSPC, and
it works out at an average number of sales of 3.7 properties per
practice - or just over one house per month per member firm between
January and March of this year.
There is no doubt that the solicitors have carved themselves a role in
Glasgow's property market but few, if any, individual firms can be
making much money from the estate agency part of their business.

PERCHED on the Castle's slopes, high above Princes Street, is a
historic house for an art lover. In what must be the best opportunity
for years to acquire a large house in one of Europe's most dramatic city
centre settings, Edinburgh's Ramsay Lodge is on the market.
Forming three buildings in the middle of the unusual terrace just
below the Castle Esplanade, Ramsay Lodge was built in 1740 by one of the
capital's most remarkable, and eclectic, supporters of the arts. The son
of a mine manager, Allan Ramsay had travelled from Leadhills to the
capital in 1700 to serve his apprenticeship as a wigmaker.
But it was Edinburgh's artistic opportunities that made his hair stand
on end. He played a pivotal role in the city's cultural community in the
first half of the eighteenth century - poet, playwright, theatre
manager, editor, entrepreneur, nationalist, and all-round campaigner
against the deadening hand of the Kirk, Ramsay went on to set up
Britain's first circulating library.
His bookshop was firmly established as the place where Edinburgh's
literati went to exchange bon mots.
Although not in the very top class as a poet, he had a pithy, couthy,
style which had a strong following. He was also an important supporter
of the theatre, and in 1736 he set up Edinburgh's first regular theatre,
in Carruber's Close.
The Kirk was appalled by this blatant exhibition of Auld Nick's
peep-shows and forced Ramsay to ring down the curtain on the dramatic
arts the following year.
When he was not tormenting the meenisters, he liked to tweak the
English and was a strong advocate of the auld Scot's tongue. In the
preface to his anthology of poetry in 1721 he declared the breadth and
wealth of the Scottish language.
Some three years later he reminded his readers that when the
traditional Scots bards were writing ''we had not yet made use of
imported trimmings upon our cloaths'' - reprimanding those Scots poets
of the day who preferred the use of English when there was a perfectly
good Scottish tongue to hand.
Paradoxically, his own poetry is a mix of genteel English and broad
Scots - the same dualism, perhaps, which made him build his house in a
location which allowed him to turn his back on the teeming life of
Edinburgh's High Street and look out across the open countryside to the
Forth.
Ramsay Lodge was built to his own design on an open plot next to the
Castle overlooking the Nor' Loch (now Princes Street Gardens). To take
maximum advantage of the views he created a building which was octagonal
in shape - an avant garde flourish which, to Ramsay's intense
irritation, soon earned it the nickname Goose Pie from Edinburgh's wits.
His son, the painter Allan Ramsay, extended the building around 1768
by adding a terrace of houses to the east.
After being sold and re-sold several times, around 1890 the house was
purchased by the pioneering town planner Sir Patrick Geddes. Credited as
the saviour of Edinburgh's Old Town, Geddes made the building the core
of his Ramsay Garden project, a scheme which he hoped would link town
and gown by combining university residences with private flats.
A variety of architects designed the different buildings, creating a
remarkable terrace in the Arts-and-Crafts style.
Edinburgh University occupied Ramsay Lodge from 1897 till 1945, and
for much of the time since then it has served as a residential training
centre. Now that the set of three buildings which comprise Ramsay Lodge
is on the market, Edinburgh has a remarkable opportunity to see them
return to their original purpose - a house for an art lover, as extended
by his artist son.
The stunning views of Princes Street and the New Town extend across
the Firth of Forth to the hills of Fife. Key features include the four
octagonal rooms which comprise Allan Ramsay senior's original house.
The property also contains a magnificent main reception room which is
dominated by murals painted by John Duncan, the foremost artist of the
Celtic Revival movement at the end of the 19th century. The huge dining
room has a light, airy feel to it and a beamed ceiling.
The bedrooms are perhaps a little too much: there's 20 of them, which
might suggest that the building should remain as an institution of some
sort. Duncan McDougall, of marketing agents Ryden, says that it could
make a magnificent legation for foreign dignitaries, or an upmarket
research or language centre.
However, like any real property enthusiast, he would love to see it
revert to its original purpose. ''The problem is that it is really three
houses in one, and you'd need an awful large retinue before you could
justify 20 bedrooms, plus servants' quarters,'' he admits.
But then, opportunities such as this are truly historic. Cometh the
time, cometh the money? The asking price is #900,000 and the planning
restrictions would daunt even the most gung-ho of developers.
''Chances like this hardly ever arise, so there might b a surprise
buyer. A wealthy art lover or antique collector might live in part of
the house, while using the rest of the building to exhibit his
collection. It is truly unique. I was showing some people around it this
week and everyone was delighted and astonished by its setting.''
Goose Pie would make a dainty dish to set before a wealthy art lover.

UNDER the shadow of Berwick Law, the iron laws of property are being
proven by two of the newest house builders in Scotland. 'We've got the
right location, the right specification and the right price,'' says
Dennis Ward of Tantallon Homes.
The partners have just sold virtually every house on the site - before
anyone has moved in. Indeed, after having had 2000 sales brochures
printed they find themselves mildly embarrassed by the pile of 1700
redundant brochures stacked neatly in the sales cabin.
That is a sales record which any builder would envy, yet until last
year neither of these man had worked in the house building industry.
Quantity surveyors Dennis Ward and Chris Chambers decided to set up
Tantallon Homes after returning from working abroad in places like the
Middle East, Australia and Gibraltar on major civil engineering or
commercial contracts in the #20m to #30m bracket.
''When we came home at the end of our Gibralter contract we were
unemployed and it was clear that there were no jobs for quantity
surveyors in Scotland, so we decided to create jobs for ourselves,''
says Chris Chambers. They have also created a very hands-on approach to
the building industry.
When The Herald visited the site where there are some 20 homes under
construction, both men turned up in their jeans, working boots, sleeves
rolled up - and carrying a kettle, jar of coffee and bag of sugar.
Tantallon Homes is a frills-free zone.
''We've been able to sell these houses at very keen prices because our
management structure is about as lean as it can get,'' says Dennis Ward.
''There is no head office for anyone to phone if there is a problem. We
have no layer of accountants or admin staff to be paid. If any of the
builders on the site have a question, they just have to shout over to
Chris or me.''
When they set up in business a few months ago, they were looking for a
site on which they could build one or two high-specification houses. But
land is in very short supply in East Lothian and the pair eventually did
a deal with CALA Homes to buy a site adjoining CALA's own North Berwick
scheme.
Funding for the project came with the support of CALA Finance, an arm
of the building group which finances small specialist builders with
quality projects on their drawing boards. Tantallon also made use of
CALA's house styles and has built to that company's designs and
specification.
With prices ranging up to #107,000 for detached houses with three and
four bedrooms on their doorstep, the burghers of North Berwick were
quick to respond. ''Most of the buyers are local people. There is
nothing else available of this size and price in the area,'' says Chris
Chambers, who admits to ''a wee bit of luck'' in acquiring the site at
just the right time.
But with the building industry still having to work hard for every
sale, how did Tantallon succeed so well and so quickly?
''We took the Marks &amp; Spencer approach - we provided good quality at a
good price,'' says Chris Chambers. 'We visited a lot of other building
sites and, being new to the business, we were very surprised to see so
many stickers on items in the showhouses saying ''This costs extra''.
''Hardwood finishes, glazed doors, downstairs cloakrooms, and
dishwashers are among the features that most often cost more if the
buyer wants them. When you add up the cost of some of those 'extras',
buyers are having to fork out up to #10,000 to get a house like the
showhouse.''
They decided to provide everything except the fireplace in the set
price (they take the view that not everyone wants a fireplace and that
it is wasteful to fit one automatically, only to have it removed or
replaced by the buyer later). ''What you see is what you should get,''
says Dennis Ward.
With a waiting list of would-be buyers for their product, the partners
are now looking for other sites in the East Lothian District.

MAYBE its just that people can't afford the staff any more, or perhaps
the Johnstone by-pass has removed the need for them - but the fact is
that very few people in Renfrewshire need chaffeur's these days.
Which means that the occasional chaffeur's cottage is now being driven
onto the market. A charming example in Lochwinnoch has been completely
re-serviced. Everything behind the traditional stone facade has been
stripped out and re-built, rather like putting a modern engine into a
vintage car.
A number of features, including a porthole window to the front of the
building and large arched windows from the lounge to the courtyard which
fill the space originally taken up by the stable doors in the days when
toffs went to town by horse and carriage.
Although the living space is modern, the beechwood flooring throughout
the ground floor gives it a traditional feel.
The accommodation includes sitting room, kitchen, and three bedrooms,
one of which can be used as a study.
Slater Hogg &amp; Howison is seeking offers over #95,000, purhcasers will
have to provide their own chaffeur's uniform.

QUALITY STREET has a special occasion today. It's the official opening
by Sir James Mellon, chairman of Scottish Homes, of the Fountainside
housing development in Hamilton, an #880,000 project partly funded by a
40% Gro-grant from Scottish Homes.
Altogether, there are 18 spacious two-bedroom apartments, available to
let on a furnished or unfurnished basis. Rentals are from #375 a month
unfurnished, and #460 furnished.
The apartments come in three blocks, and there is off-street private
parking. Unfurnished properties have fully-fitted kitchens, and are
fully carpeted and curtained.
So why a development like this? QS chairman Paul Mugnaioni tells me
they are looking to have properties in every major town in the UK.
''We already manage some 5000 properties,'' he points out. ''This is
our first venture in Hamilton, and it is new-build. It fits in nicely to
our portfolio, which has properties from Aberdeen to the South Coast.
''Rental is the most important development in the UK housing market, I
would say. How else do people move around, or develop a career, without
having to spend a fortune?
The trend is increasing, steadily. It should grow to a 20% figure in
the next 10 to 15 years.
''We have a lot of properties because we saw the trend years ago. We
got in early. We manage properties for others, and we are landlords in
our own right. We also happen to believe we provide good quality
property at a reasonable cost.''
Apart from Hamilton, QS have a range of properties in the West of
Scotland. Take Trinity College at Charing Cross as an example. It was
the company's first development, from a former ecclesiastical college,
now a listed building and well-known city landmark.
You can have a studio, one and two-bedroom apartments on split level,
some with open gallery overlooking the lounge.
There are fitted mirrored wardrobes, a tiled bathroom with electric
shower. Separate laundry with automatic washing machine and tumble
dryers. Video entryphone.
Available for #760 a month for a single-bedroom property and #880 for
a two-bedroom.
Also in the West End, off the beaten track, there are mews houses
offering secluded luxury living. Large rooms and lots of light is the
message. Two double bedrooms. Designer dining kitchen. Dining area with
balcony and roof window above. French windows leading on to living room
with bay window. Large bathroom. Large understair cupboard. Integral
double garage with electrically operated door. Security alarm.
Cost: #695 for two-bedroom flat, unfurnished, or #850 furnished.
Pollokshields is handy in many ways. Two-bedroom apartments. Big
bathroom, complete with sauna. Quality kitchen with all the fittings.
Master bedroom with en-suite shower room. Oriel window to the lounge.
Dining room has balcony. Gardens are landscaped, of course.
All yours for #800, furnished, for a two-bedroom flat.

SCOTTISH Opera's revival of Verdi's La Forza del Destino -- originally
produced by Elijah Moshinsky, now directed by Argentine-born Roberto
Goldschlager -- has enormous depth dramatically, musically, and on the
exquisite moody designs of Michael Yeargen.
From the luscious and intimate vivid-red boudoir opening scene, set
diminutively within the overall stage size, to the more expansive
monastery scenes, the overall concept is of shifting perspectives, none
the less hued with a prevailing sense of the foreboding characterised by
Davy Cunningham's dark, shadowy lighting effects.
Scottish Opera has a cast to match which, in last night's opening
performance, and with few exceptions, displayed a remarkable sense of
consistency and commitment.
Above all there is the stunning Australian, Lisa Gasteen, whose
Leonora was voluptuous. The anguish and torment of her opening moments
were only surpassed in her closing scene, where the haunting richness of
her voice conveyed movingly her frustration and desolation.
As her brother, Vladimir Redkin's Don Carlo was strong and
unrelenting, if a little tense in his opening scenes. Jonathan Veira's
Melitone was similarly commanding, delightfully complemented by the
sanctimonious Guardiano of Riccardo Ferrari. Coquettish as ever, Clare
Shearer's portrayal of the gipsy fortune-teller, Preziosilla, lent a
further lighter touch to the performance.
Richard Armstrong directed a strong chorus and orchestra in a
performance that was superbly paced and is well worth a visit.

GLASGOW School of Art students turned up in droves on Thursday to hear
the legendary sculptor and artist Sir Eduardo Paolozzi give a talk at
the GFT. Perish the thought it was just a chance to skip classes. The
great man's theme -- The Artificial Horizon and Eccentric Ladders -- was
sufficiently enigmatic to explain the throng.
A powerful figure with grizzled head and clashing checked shirt and
tie, Sir Eduardo instantly won his young audience's approval by
recalling he had attended just one interesting lecture in his year as an
undergraduate at the rival art establishment in Edinburgh.
His talk was largely a commentary on an amazingly disparate flow of
images trained on a screen more used to showing cinematic offerings for
the cognoscenti. His own ''strange path of creativity'' encompassed a
childhood where the walls of his house were covered in religious
pictures while under the bed was another world of model cars and
aeroplanes. He had, he revealed, a childhood fascination with robots and
was also ''implanted with American iconography''. Is his a classic case
of the child being father of the man?
His own creativity was driven by immense curiosity and a taste for
''cultural recycling''. He enjoys working with discarded, recycled
materials.
Science and high-quality scientific drawings have obviously been a
continuing source of inspiration for him -- illustrations of DNA, for
example, metamorphosed into the physical reality of a large-scale
sculpture. His serendipitous approach to creativity was illustrated,
too, by a relief for a blind child -- the main elements of which were
the discarded innards of a grand piano ruined by having beer poured into
it.
Through the hour's talk, a dazzling jumble of images -- from a
six-propellered plane of the 1920s and Leger men on scaffolding to
copulating locusts and Mickey Mouse -- was related to illustrations of
his own graphic work and sculpture. Was that really a puppet nun and the
devil clinging to a Vespa?
There were also personal glimpses of celebrated contemporaries:
Giocometti, ''almost the apotheosis of surrealism'', who had no
equipment but worked on his stick figures with thumb and penknife;
Bacon, who apparently would like to have burned his ''popes''.
Sir Eduardo has donated a set of 1960s prints -- The Moonstrip Empire
News -- to Glasgow School of Art and is also giving a limited edition of
poster prints to be auctioned for the student hardship fund. The student
with the best 500-word ''interpretation'' of the lecture wins a signed
print by the great man. A daunting challenge.

''LOOK at you.'' The tall figure is cast in a brooding red glow that
makes even the tip of the microphone look burning hot. ''Look at you.
Sister. Brother. It is grim.'' So begins Ronald Fraser-Munro's pitch
against the worst evils of our society. Racism? Brutality? Fascism?
Capitalism?
Certainly those do get pointed up through the heightened images
delivered in his rich mix of text, film, graphics, and soundscore. But
the evils that cause him real grief and outrage are the all-pervasive
passive ones: apathy, collusion, hypocrisy, complacency.
The comfortable rub lies, of course, in our sitting, watching -- and
recognising as familiar -- the snippets of past dictators and
goose-stepping Nazis, the deliberate violence of a boot crushing down on
a head or a baton thundering into a defenceless body. They hardly shock
us, they are the commonplace of so much media footage. No wonder
Fraser-Munro considers this -- us -- a grim state.
Unfortunately, I suspect the full impact of Bruder c'est Grim! is
diluted by having the two sets of projected images shown on separated
walls. Fraser-Munro's clipped, metallic delivery, however, remains
compelling as does his ability to twist words mid-sentence so as to
deliver an unexpected punchline.
His programme opens in lighter mode -- Le Chaise Longue Dangereuse
finds Fraser-Munro saucing verses about love with sly puns against a
film backdrop full of similar absurdities.
It's a merry introduction to a vivid performance style that celebrates
wordplay and manipulated imagery both on text and on screen -- just how
seriously powerful and politically passionate that style can be comes in
the subsequent vehement collage of Bruder c'est Grim.

ICON Theatre, Strathclyde Arts Centre's adult drama group, is taking
the bold step of presenting four new plays at Mayfest this year. Their
first offering, As I Lay Me Down to Sleep, by Bernadette Maria Creechan,
portrays a middle-aged woman undergoing severe menopausal depression and
the profound and traumatic effects her behaviour has on her husband and
adolescent daughter.
The issue is not one widely discussed or understood, certainly in the
field of dramatic writing. It is a subject of which I personally have no
first-hand experience, and about which I must confess to considerable
ignorance. My initial response to its extreme depiction in the piece was
one of incredulity. The audience, however, which included a sizable
contingency from a local menopause support group suggested otherwise,
laughing, increasingly nervously, in recognition of Cathy, the
menopausal mother's frantic mood swings, outbursts, and obsessive
behaviour.
At times the somewhat clumsy and laborious staging of the piece with
lengthy and frequent blackouts between each scene, and the even-paced
delivery of the dialogue, worked, perhaps perversely, to produce a sense
of the character's entrapment in the destructive cycle, and an unease at
witnessing such excesses of irrational behaviour.
Despite a strong performance from Andreena Caldwell as the daughter,
an ultimately implausible and over-toothy dialogue, which tended to seek
easy and inappropriate laughs over establishing belief in the
characters, undermined audience sympathy towards them. A melodramatic
denouement provided the perhaps inevitable outcome.
The commitment to new writing is to be applauded but greater focus on
the development of the script would have better served both writer and
actors, maintaining the reputation of a company who have previously
nurtured many of Scottish theatre's most successful talents.

IT all ended happily on Thursday night, with hetero Derek in the front
row briefly leaving his girlfriend's side in order to accept homo
Scott's invitation to step up on stage and plant a smacker on Scott's
cheek. Nice. Nicey-nice. Ahhhh . . . comedy that unites distant social
tribes; allowing people to forget their differences in
sexual-orientation; facilitating mass hand-holding and gooey-eyed
choruses of We Are The World . . . yeccch, don't you just hate it? Scott
sure does.
Scott's mercurial waspishness is what distinguishes his very funny
brand of conversational humour. One second he'd be cutely wrinkling his
nose and fluttering his eyelashes at us, the next he'd be casually
unleashing acidic savageries about our poor taste in socks and jumpers.
And the second after that he'd be talking explicitly dirty while wearing
a look of the most winsome fluffiness.
We loved him for it, of course. Derek in the front row loved him.
Derek's girlfriend loved him, even when Scott said terrible things about
her breasts. What other terrible things did Scott say with a disarming
smile on his face? ''Paisley -- pretty print, awful town,'' was one we
particularly relished, along with some inflammatory asides about Barbra
Streisand. Most importantly, though, Scott managed to slip in some
terrible truths towards the end.
Stuff about men always lying. Other stuff about people's sexualities
not being the root of their problems, but rather their ability to think.
Uh? ''Only stupid people are happy,'' Scott told us.
Scott certainly sent us away happy, but he'd made us a little wiser,
too.

THE lush images created by Robert Lepage and Robert Caux's
spellbinding score act as an opiate to the senses. The atmosphere of
expectation bristling throughout the theatre prior to this work,
designed and directed by Canada's most celebrated director, was
immediately fulfilled, with a series of arresting images grabbing our
attention and an intensely focused performance by Marc Labreche holding
us in thrall throughout.
Steel scaffolding framed a revolving screen, on which were variously
reflected an eerie constellation, stunning colour washes, shadows, and
film clips. The screen provided the backdrop for the ruminations of
Labreche, flipping around as he flipped through time, from a narrator
based in a Parisian hotel in 1989 (making unsuccessful attempts at
telephonic communication with an ex-lover) to an arch, impish
dramatisation of Jean Cocteau's Letter to the Americans, written while
the poet flew back to Paris from New York in 1949. Labreche shrugged
into a harness, with a casualness belying the pyrotechnic wizardry, and
floated over a night sky; Cocteau composing his address to the rhythm of
the propellors.
The show is an impressive combination of the potential of multi-media
technology and the simple thrill of theatrical performance, with Lepage
making spatial connections between the two disparate characters and,
further, to the affair between Miles Davis and Juliette Greco, conducted
in the same Parisian hotel room 50 years before.
The piece is dotted with cross-references and dominated by the
statement that there is no medical cure for ''existential angst, low
self-esteem, and love sickness'', but it is clearly folly to wrestle too
thoroughly with its themes. As Cocteau, Labreche warns that ''critics
always look for meanings that aren't there''. Forget the analysis,
simply succumb to this tribute to the imagination.

THE unexpected thing about Wildcat's latest foray into contemporary
politics is that its target is as much the right as the left. Far from
being simply the grumblings of the socialist old guard about the rise of
the clean-shaven New Left (which it undoubtedly is), this musical farce
by Dave Anderson and David MacLennan is also an attack on the loss of
principles across the political landscape.
Ironically, the one voice of reason amid a rogues' gallery of chancers
is Vivien Heilbron as the chairperson of the Auchtergeldy Conservative
Association who, representing the voice of old money, makes a solitary
appeal for the return of passion, conviction, and morality, whatever the
actual opinion.
Pitching its analysis so broadly is both the strength and the weakness
of Bedfellows. On the one hand it provides the basis for a much-needed
commentary on a situation in which politicians have become
indistinguishable from one another. On the other hand, because it fails
to offer any concrete way forward, it totters perilously close to a plea
for a return to the good old days when Tories were snobs and socialists
knew their place in the world.
The farce proper is fun once it gets into gear, and there's a great
performance from Michael MacKenzie, as Hector McEnvie the barman, who
gets to grips with the broad brush strokes of the characterisation
better than most.
In true company style the lively score draws freely from the popular
canon, everything from Weill to Dixieland jazz to Hue and Cry to Prince.
The artists currently known as Wildcat have spotted the right target,
but are still warming up for the kill.

IN THE lexicon of fashionwrite, ''gone'' and ''in'' used to be
favourite words. They were opposites. If a certain style wasn't in then
it had to be gone.
When editors of glossy magazines laid down the law to readers, it
would be . . . ''gone are the insipid, chalky colours of chilly March
and in for a vibrant autumn is the colour purple,'' or vice-versa. That
which had been plucked from obscurity and glorified in spring had to be
ritually slaughtered a few months later. It was all very distressing if
you'd just forked out three guineas for a garment of the condemned hue.
Anyone taking a casual glance at recent fashion pages knows that in is
the 1950s look. However, it isn't necessarily a case of ''gone are the
loose, unstructured styles''. While the couture collections gradually
influenced chainstore ranges, mainstream dressing continued to relax.
In Hollywood's heyday, a full make-up, cantilevered bustline, sheath
skirt and stilettos were all very well for the likes of Elizabeth Taylor
to smoulder away in. Screen goddesses didn't get where they were
yesterday without a gorgeous face and curvaceous figure. Of course,
Grace Kelly looked divine in twin-set and pearls, Cyd Cherise in a
cocktail dress, and Lana Turner in a halter neckline. Stacked was the
fanzines' epithet for the ideal fifties female.
For those of us less well endowed, and lacking an army of hairdressers
and make-up girls, the fifties look was not easy to achieve and
maintain. For a start, you had to be pretty.
Look at me, I'm Sandra Dee.
Tell me more, tell me more, did you get very far?
In Scotland, only the dedicated did. The climate and the rarity of
cars were bitter enemies of such polished glamour. What the haar did to
the hair was something awful. Rain into winklepickers did go, and the
remainder was a terminally tatty pair of shoes. Meanwhile, magazines
portrayed ''society'' models whose appearance involved an enormous
investment of money, time and effort.
''Unforgiving'' is how Ruth Hand, of Edinburgh, describes fifties
fashion. ''It was a brittle look. Even the points of three-quarter
sleeves and the blouse had to be perfect. Modern dress is loose and
hides the little physical faults. With fifties clothes you couldn't just
slop around in them.''
Nevertheless, Ruth finds a ready market for original 1950s items. At
Hand in Hand she sells period clothes and accessories, and interesting
textiles. An alluring, strapless, lace and net confection is among 1950s
dance frocks, for which there is an increasing demand.
Ruth now has customers under 25 searching out fifties clothes. A
circular skirt with big, multi-coloured flower patterns sold instantly.
Black taffeta ballerina-length skirts are popular, as are crystal beads,
clip earrings and even compacts. Handbags and vanity cases of the era
are now collectable.
''These aren't clothes you could just put on and forget about. You had
to be constantly fixing your hair, refurbishing make-up and seeing that
your seams were straight. The young ones now pick and choose. They might
wear a black net skirt with leggings or the heavy make-up complete with
pencilled eyebrows and punk hair. They take eyecatching items from the
fifties and create their own street style.''
Someone who welcomes the fifties revival is Kate Cameron, owner of
Gladrags. ''It's a return to elegance. The couture catwalks and glossies
have been full of it and now the style has filtered through to the
clothes we wear. It's a total look,'' she says, and dresses to prove it.
With her hair in a French roll, she wears original 1950s outfits with
verve.
Kate was one step ahead of the current vogue. She's always loved
retroglamour, and was sporting nipped-in waist, peplum jacket, and high
heels when all around were in tunics and leggings.
''The fifties look is ultra feminine,'' she says, ''but is not for
everyone. After freer lingerie and stretchy fabrics, uplift bras and
corsets to emphasise the waist do seem constricting. But once a woman is
in these beautifully finished dresses of the period, complete with
contemporary accessories, it's worth the effort. I've seen women carry
it off with enormous confidence, looking really chic.''
High-heeled courts or flatty pumps are essential ingredients. Kate
Cameron stocks a range of footwear including perspex mules. She has
chiffon scarves, belts broad and narrow and jewellery. ''The small
clutch bag was popular and the hats were delicious.'' The cocktail hats
and fascinators, feathered half-hats and beret-like creations perched
pertly on the head. They had little to do with keeping warm, and
everything to do with urban sophistication and womanliness.
Kate Cameron and Ruth Hand both say that if you go for originals you
get a quality and finish not found in the high street today. Often,
surviving garments were the most expensive thing a woman had in her
wardrobe. Some items had sentimental significance: the first ball gown
or the going-away hat. Treasures worn once are likely to be in excellent
condition. In fact, when everyday costume is sought by TV and film
companies it is hard to find. Slacks, capri pants and other casual wear
tends not to have survived.
The 1950s was a decade in which the walk down the aisle to her wedding
was widely perceived as a girl's smartest career move. Personal
presentation and grooming were of vital importance to her prospects.
Just as glamorous clothes were a reaction to wartime austerity, their
revival may represent a swing of the pendulum away from grunge -- just
what Doc Marten ordered.

Macho men are all the rage
Selling jeans and after shave
So hard, so hard
It's getting so hard to be a man.
-- Hard by Tom Robinson, pop singer, 1994.
GUYS are gloomy. Guys are in the doldrums. Guys, to put it bluntly,
have had enough. Thus sighed the self-proclaimed Voice of Guyhood in
Garrison Keillor's Book of Guys (Faber), a quirky look at the sorrows
and comforts of the state of guyness in the 1990s.
It was a voice that began to get to me, this Voice of Guyhood. It was
so sad and self-doubting. It deserved to be listened to by a sympathetic
female ear, I decided. I read on, picking up on tortured outbursts from
all sorts of guys -- even party guys such as Dionysus, Greek god of wine
and revelry, seemed to be in some kind of a crisis (I have no lack of
self-esteem, he kept insisting, I am a God!). The situation was
beginning to look serious. I mean, if Gods like Dionysus were having
doubts about their guyness, what about the poor old ordinary mortal guy?
I began to mull over the assortment of guys I knew best, concerned
that there was a widespread masculine crisis afoot that, typically, men
were keeping to themselves. And eventually I had to agree with the Voice
of Guyhood. There is a measure of general glumness in the male species
-- a glumness about life, love and the rest of it -- at least compared
to the get-up-and-go-for-it-even-if-the-stress-kills-you attitude of the
women I know.
The reason is hard to put your finger on, said the Voice of Guyhood,
but guys are in trouble. Worried, I read on:
''We are delicate as roses in winter and need to be wrapped in warmth
or else we die,'' sniffled VOG. Well, anyone who's witnessed a guy with
even the mildest of colds knows that's true enough. But then VOG makes a
loaded assertion. Years ago, he says, when manhood was an opportunity to
achieve great and noble guy-type things, guys were OK. And now? Nowadays
just being a guy is a problem to be overcome. And who is to blame? No
prizes for guessing -- it's us girls.
Ever since girls started mucking about with feminism and wanting to
run the world too, guys have been having problems with their guyness, it
seems. If guys aren't running things any more then what is guyness all
about? Is today's guy just someone to blame war, violence and the rest
of the world's ills on? What guys need, I thought, is to design
themselves a new model of guyhood.
And it's happening. One option was signalled quite spectacularly last
year when Arnold Schwarzenegger dumped his kalashnikov and combat gear
for a maternity T-shirt to play the part of an anxious father-in-waiting
in Junior. But ordinary guys too are beginning to turn their backs on
traditional manliness to mould a new type of masculinity, one that is
easier to live with than the body-builder-killer hero, that walking
advertisement for the insecurity of 1980s man.
And who has emerged but an anti-hero, a reaction to the exaggerated
masculinity of the last decade. Welcome: the wimp.
The wimp is fast becoming a male role model for the nineties. Never
before has it been so hip to wimp. Wimpishness abounds. Thought to be
derived from the word ''whimper' or from the character of Popeye's Mr
Wimpy, the antithesis of the cartoon's action hero, wimphood is a safe
option for guys who, like old VOG, are confused about what guyness means
in a changing world.
Wimphood is a haven too for the vanished prototype New Man of the
eighties: having retreated in a hurt huff over universal sneering at the
dishcloth in his hand, he has re-emerged in the mid-nineties, peering
out from beneath the frown and floppy fringe he cultivated to hide his
hurt, and finds himself in the spotlight again -- an unexpected cult
icon.
The standard kit-out of the wimp is distressed, from floppy fringe
down. Be nice to me, it says, I'm one of the good guys. You want to
sweep that mop of hair out of his face, turn up the sleeves of his
jacket, and take him home for a reassuring cuddle.
There's a wimp in every sphere of nineties life: sullen, wimpy
popstars such as Suede (the very name hinting at things soft and
strokable even if the music isn't); in the film world actor Hugh Grant
is collecting shelf-fuls of awards for his portrayal of the winsome wimp
in Four Weddings and a Funeral. Women loved the bumbling romanticism of
Grant's character Charles, while men triumphed by proxy, enjoying
fellow-empathy with the wimp who ultimately wins the beautiful girl.
In politics the wet and the wimpy, the Grey Man and Bambi, preach a
new ethos of talk and co-operation to replace the fire and iron clashes
of the Kinnock and Thatcher era.
The wimp is a favourite soap and comedy staple too. There's Ricky in
EastEnders and David in Roseanne -- the latter being the ultimate in
wimps. David has made cowed glances and sunken-chested squirming an
aspirational accomplishment for nineties boys. As the screen family's
adopted dartboard, at whom the slings and arrows of outrageous slaggings
are aimed, David is THE role model for unappreciated teenagers. When
put-upon to the limit, David frowns behind his mop of ringlets, mutters
into his pockets, and survives to wimp, brilliantly, through another
episode.
Men wallow in secret empathy with these wimpy idols. They may chortle
chummily alongside the girls at the male-directed barbs of Ruby Wax and
Jo Brand but it's to wimps like Reeves and Mortimer, Mayall and Edmonson
in their underdog worlds that they turn to for some sly comfort, in the
manner of Wax and Brand solacing themselves with a secret store of jam
doughnuts under the bed.
Yet where wimping out is OK for wimps, some men are digging in heels
against what they see as society's trivialisation of their masculinity.
Muscling up for a fight is the way real men cope in a crisis, say the
new male fundamentalists. Unnerved by the disappearance of the heavy
''male'' industries where men needed muscle to do the job, and their
replacement by ''female'' service industries, the fundamentalist men's
movement has begun a cultural war over what they see as the shrinking of
male space in society. With women taking over and infiltrating even the
masculine citadel of combat in the armed forces is there any place left,
they ask, where a man can do manly things in peace?
In Male Impersonators: Men Performing Masculinity (Cassell), author
Mark Simpson takes a mischievous look at the current crises and clashes
in masculinity. A journalist and cultural theorist, Simpson claims the
advances of feminism and gay rights into men's territory have put many
men in a fearful state.
Men have good reason to be concerned though, says Simpson. Suddenly
they see their bodies on display, everywhere; they are inundated with
unsettling images of passive and perfect male bodies -- on screen, on
advertising billboards, and on magazine covers. As the new mass consumer
market, men now see their bodies used to sell everything from Levis to
ice-cream. And, contradictorily, often the advertisers appeal to a guy's
sense of manhood while selling him feminising products: skin-softening,
sensuously-scented, hair-removing potions that are meant to smooth out
rough masculine edges.
In short, men's bodies are being given the media treatment it is no
longer politically correct to dish out to women. Anyone -- male or
female -- is free to look upon these images of the male body, to judge,
desire, compare. Men are squirming, belatedly finding out what women
have felt for decades: that it's not nice.
In the words of the Tom Robinson song, it's getting so hard to be a
man when all around you are macho images of Gladiators' biceps and
magnified, muscular torsos. In addition to which, the modern woman wants
her man to have the brains of Jeremy Paxman and the sensitivity of
Paddington Bear.
The recent ''discovery'' of men's bodies underlies a growing,
media-led male narcissism in our body-culture, Mark Simpson argues. Yet
male narcissism might well be a model for a new type of masculinity, he
believes. I have a sudden, fascinating vision of men the world over, too
preoccupied by the pleasures and flaws of their own reflections to
bother about politicking, fighting, power-broking and the rest. Just
imagine the implications. (Just think what women might have got up to,
freed from the thralldom of the mirror.)
But it's not quite what Mark Simpson means. He argues that narcissism
can be a positive force, as opposed to selfish individualism, a
non-aggressive, nurturing quality which could in the long-term transform
masculinity, and men. Transform us into wimps, you mean, howl the male
fundamentalists, Dionysus, and all those old-style guys.
Yet the man who suddenly turns wimp on you is not necessarily
experiencing a complete turnaround in his masculinity. Artist Jenny
Saville, she of the outsize female nudes, believes our cultural fixation
on bodies means that they are utterly codified with meaning and
intimately connected with issues of power. And in the case of the wimp,
it's just inverted body narcissism.
For underneath that cute fringe and the too-large clothes is a man as
obsessed with himself as any bodybuilder. In the manner of a Victorian
lady, he knows the best way to work up a curiosity about what's
underneath is to cover it up.
Bagginess and coy floppiness of clothes and hair only serve to hint
seductively at what's hidden under it all. And it's an image that wants
you to believe that this is a man at sea in a confusing world, a guy who
can't even get his clothes and hair together. All he wants is to be
rescued and taken care of by a capable woman.
''Spoilt, sullen faces that peer awkwardly from under irritatingly
long fringes and demand everything: proudly narcissistic babies that
need your love -- all of it,'' is Mark Simpson's interpretation of pop
group Suede's wimpy image. It reminds me of David in Roseanne, of Ricky
in EastEnders, of a whole host of cute, wimpy individuals. And it holds
a warning: women beware wimps.
A floppy fringe is, after all, only Elvis' macho quiff with the
Brylcreem washed out.

BEFORE
My brother's career is a feminine one, he's a ballet dancer with the
Scottish ballet, he recently did Swan Lake, so he can't slag me. I feel
that we are equal. I'm going to an HIV counselling group for infected
and affected women and children. My mum is the chairwoman. I'm not
allowed to speak to the patients, I think they'd feel awkward talking to
a child. The group is called What About Me? I want to be a policewoman.
I want to learn how to help people cope. If a woman is battered by her
husband the WPC has to comfort her. I want to learn caring skills. My
mum's calm, if anyone says something horrible to her on the phoneline
she doesn't answer them back.
AFTER
We really just typed out letters to different counselling groups
telling them about ourselves. I learnt a lot about the people who are
volunteers, how they network. I was surprised that they all came from
different backgrounds and still managed to come together and support
people. It's changed my view of my mum. I know now how much effort she
puts into counselling. I saw how she dealt with problems and feel I'm
better equipped to become a policewoman.
* Kirsty Tait, 14:
BEFORE
I was six or seven when I realised that I wanted to be a vet. I'd feel
sorry for a hurt animal and hope I could do something to help it. It'd
be brilliant if I could work with different animals. I saw lots of
programmes on the TV when I was younger, one of them was Animal Hospital
with Rolf Harris. Then I got a book about James Herriot when I was nine,
which I didn't understand. I've still got it. I read it now. It makes me
more confident that veterinary surgery is what I want to do. I'm going
to the Avalon Vet Clinic in Milngavie. You have to be able to look after
animals and communicate with their owners. I'll be watching operations
in the afternoon.
AFTER
* I stood and watched during the consultation in the morning. One or
two animals came in, two dogs and a cat. The cat needed an operation. It
had an abcess and the vet drained it away. I watched the vet operate, it
was very interesting. I feel I want to be a vet more now. The
qualifications are hard but I'm determined.
* Claire Davis, 13:
BEFORE
I've always been interested something arty or medicine. I'm good at
the three sciences. My dad's an architect and I'm going to someone he
knows. I've been to showhouses and seen how patterns go together.
There's still a population of people who think that women shouldn't
work. My Dad says that when women go on site and give orders they're not
taken seriously. Design is good fun. One of our teachers says that those
who go into interior design like measuring because that's what you do
most of the time. A lot of people want to be doctors and lawyers because
of what they see on TV. In design you're not recognised because you're
behind the scenes.
AFTER
It was excellent. I met an interior designer. He gave me a plain
drawing of a flat with nothing in it except fireplaces and windows, and
some stencils of furniture. I had to choose where everything went, the
bathroom, the kitchen, the bedroom. I coloured it in and used a
different technique for the carpet. Then we mounted it in gold. Then I
was given another board which we would have given to clients if it was
for real, and I choose a blue theme for the carpets and borders and a
green colour to match. I really enjoyed it, but I'd have liked more
time.

<HEADLINE>200-mile trip for dying patient</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978583867</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A DYING patient was taken on a 200-mile trip by ambulance because
there were no specialist intensive-care facilities available, it was
revealed yesterday.
The 39-year-old man was admitted to Frimley Park hospital, Camberley,
Surrey, with liver disease on March 28.
When his condition deteriorated two weeks later, no suitable bed could
be found in the area and he was transferred to St James's hospital,
Leeds.
Mr Andrew Morris, chief executive at Frimley Park, said the patient
went into liver and kidney failure on April 12 and he needed a
specialist liver intensive care bed, which was not provided for at
Frimley Park.
''These facilities are normally attached to a liver transplant unit
and we normally use St Heliers at Carshalton. Unfortunately, they were
full, as were others that we tried in the area.
''The consultant felt thatas long as the patient was transferred
within 24 hours, that was clinically acceptable and we were able to
achieve that,'' said Mr Morris.
The ambulance left Frimley at 8pm and arrived at Leeds at 1.30am the
following day.
On April 14, the patient underwent a transplant operation but it was
unsuccessful and he died later the same day.
Mr Morris said the patient's death was due to clinical reasons and
hadnothing to do with the 200-mile journey.
Dr Bob Bown, a consultant physician and gastroenterologist at Frimley
Park hospital, said: ''This patient might well have died despite the
move to Leeds but such a long journey certainly did not help.
''This is not the first time we have had bed problems. We do need more
resources.''
The trip was made just weeks after a Government inquiry into the death
of Mr Malcolm Murray, who was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary
from Kent for a neurosurgical and intensive-care bed under similar
circumstances.

<HEADLINE>Lover tells murder trial of vet's affair</HEADLINE>

A WOMAN yesterday told a jury of her affair with a vet -- which
allegedly led to his wife's death from a cocktail of drugs.
Ms Catherine Crooks said: ''I fell in love with a husband of a friend.
It wasn't an easy situation.''
The vet, Mr David James, is accused of murdering his wife Sandra with
powerful animal drugs mixed with orange juice.
Mother-of-two Mrs Crooks told Stafford Crown Court that she and James
used to meet regularly late at night.
Mr James, 40, left his wife and the couple set up home together, she
said.
''We made no secret of our feelings towards one another. So far as our
spouses were concerned, our intentions were quite clear.''
Two months later, Mr James returned to his home but the affair
continued.
Mr James, of Burton on Trent, Staffordshire, denies murdering his
38-year-old wife in January last year.
The jury heard that the couple had married in May 1983 and had two
sons and a daughter.
The impression given to the outside world was that they were a
contented family but, in September 1993, Mr James started the affair
with Mrs Crooks, it was claimed.
Mr Peter Joyce QC, prosecuting, said Mr James had given his wife large
doses of phenobarbitone which had put her into a coma.
According to the prosecutor, the vet then either persuaded her or
forced her to drink the juice, which was laced with Immobilon, a drug
normally used on large animals.
When the remains of the drink were examined after her death, it was
found to contain enough of the drug to kill another six people, he
alleged.
Mr Joyce said the Crown expected that those acting for Mr James would
suggest that his wife had taken her own life.
The prosecution contended that such a suggestion would be ''absolute
nonsense''.
Mr Joyce claimed that Mr James had everything to gain by his wife's
death, including the wiping-out of #140,000 of debts.
Mrs Crooks told the court that she was now looking after Mr James'
children as well as her own.
The trial continues.

<HEADLINE>Five hurt when undercarriage collapses as holiday jet lands</HEADLINE>

SHOCKED passengers were recovering last night after their holiday
jet's undercarriage collapsed on landing at Manchester Airport.
The plane, with 171 passengers and seven crew aboard, lurched to one
side and a wing scraped along the runway.
Passengers and crew were evacuated swiftly via the aircraft's
emergency chutes as fire crews covered the jet with foam.
Five passengers on the flight from Las Palmas in Gran Canaria were
treated in hospital for minor injuries.
The Airtours McDonnell Douglas MD83 had landed and was travelling at
about 30mph towards the end of its taxiing when the left side of the
undercarriage collapsed.
''It was just horrific. I thought we were all going to die,'' said Ms
June Parr, 54, of Leeds, who suffered whiplash injuries and a suspected
angina attack.
Mr Adam Renton of Manchester said he and other passengers were thrown
forward and feared an outbreak of fire after the plane landed.
''We could see out of the corner window the sparks coming off the
wing. Everybody thought it was going to be on fire, then within seconds
the emergency chutes opened and we had to go down them,'' said Mr
Renton.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch immediately started an inquiry
into the incident which aviation experts believe may have been caused by
a faulty component in the undercarriage mechanism.
The MD83 is part of McDonnell Douglas's MD80 family which is seen as
solid and dependable replacement for the DC9 -- one of the most
successful aircraft ever made.
The aircraft had flown only 4193 hours in all and was four years old.

THE SNP convener of both Grampian Regional Council and the new Moray
Council has been granted early severance from his Customs and Excise job
after an internal inquiry revealed he failed to follow certain
departmental procedures.
Mr Gordon McDonald, 45, a Customs and Excise VAT officer, whose
appointment to the new Moray Council earlier this month was criticised
because it was suggested two convenerships were too much for one man to
carry out, was suspended in August last year after allegations of
procedural impropriety were made against him in an anonymous letter.
The letter purported to come from a member of staff at Grampian
region. A disciplinary investigation was mounted and Mr McDonald was
suspended on full pay.
The suspension came to light shortly before Mr McDonald, the SNP
leader on Grampian Regional Council, took over the convenership in
November under a power-sharing agreement with the Liberal Democrats. The
convenership alternates every six months.
In November, he was granted six months unpaid leave to allow him to
take over as convener. In a statement yesterday, a Customs and Excise
spokesman said Mr McDonald, who had co-operated throughout the
investigation, had acknowledged that certain internal departmental
procedures had not been followed.
''Following his election to the new Moray Council on April 6, Mr
McDonald has requested and been granted early severance, which is a
package at present on offer to all Customs and Excise staff in
Scotland,'' the spokesman said.
Mr McDonald now intends to devote all his energies to the creation of
the new Moray Council and the winding down of Grampian Regional Council.
He is married with three sons and a daughter and lives in Buckie, in
Banffshire, where he was elected as regional councillor at a by-election
in 1988.
As well as being leader of the SNP group, he is also chairman of the
regional economic development and planning committee. Mr McDonald could
not be contacted last night.

TOP Tory doctor Clive Froggatt left court yesterday after a judge gave
him a suspended prison sentence when he admitted drugs charges in
connection with his heroin addiction.
Froggatt, 46, regarded as an architect of NHS reforms, was sentenced
to 12 months in jail, suspended for two years, by Judge Carol Hagen at
Bristol Crown Court.
The former Conservative county councillor, of Hatherley Road,
Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, admitted eight specimen charges of
obtaining diamorphine by deception over a 22-month period from November
1992. Eight related charges of illegal possession were left on the file.
Froggatt was formerly a confidant of Health Secretary Virginia
Bottomley and her predecessor, Mr William Waldegrave. He served as
secretary of the Conservative Medical Society and Health Reform Group.
The court heard that he became addicted to heroin when depressed over
criticism of his passionate advocacy of NHS reforms. He received obscene
hate mail and two death threats, according to his counsel, Mr Anthony
Arlidge QC.
Mr Philip Mott QC, prosecuting, said that over a 22-month period, he
had scores of prescriptions for diamorphine -- the medical name for
heroin -- from local chemists in his home town of Cheltenham.
Using the names of people who had died recently, he obtained the drug
for his own use. When questioned by police, he initially said the excess
amounts of drugs were for a prominent personality in the spa town, where
he had been a doctor for nearly 20 years.
He claimed the person had been dying from Aids. However, Mr Mott said
the man -- who was not named in court -- did not have Aids and that
police inquiries about him had to be abandoned.
Mr Mott said the doctor obtained the drugs to satisfy his own
addiction.
The offences came to light after a routine check by a police officer
when a Cheltenham pharmacist's records disclosed a large amount of
diamorphine prescribed to one patient.
The QC said the drugs totalled more than 43 grams over 22 months.
Mr Arlidge said Froggatt qualified in 1970, studied at St
Bartholomew's hospital in London, and won travelling scholarships to
Harvard Medical School.
He began practising in Cheltenham in 1975, where he worked for nearly
20 years before resigning his partnership over the drug offences.
From an early age, he was a member of the Conservative Party but was
not initially active. He served as a local county councillor for seven
years to 1988 and became passionately involved in NHS reforms.
As he was well known for his views, he often contributed to media
articles. However, he was promoting his views at a time when the British
Medical Association was consistently opposed to reform.
''His views caused considerable unpopularity within his profession,''
said Mr Arlidge.
He added: ''What upset him was the level of personal abuse he
received, some of it in obscene terms. There were two death threats, one
ostensibly from a doctor.''
In May 1992, he sought help at the Maudsley Hospital in London as he
desperately wished to stop using heroin. When arrested in September
1994, he was still trying to beat the drug.
He had not registered as a drug addict as he wished to preserve his
anonymity and was now in a detoxification programme under the direction
of Professor Griffith Edwards.
He had been to a drugs clinic in Wiltshire and there was now ''a real
chance'' of his recovery, said Mr Arlidge.
Judge Hagen said the grave offences required a prison sentence but it
appeared the doctor had tried to fight his addiction over a long period.
A suspended sentence would be appropriate and the judge said she left
him in the care of the professor and hoped he would continue to make
progress.
Froggatt is now expected to face a General Medical Council
disciplinary hearing.

SCOTTISH Nuclear's management predicts that jobs cuts and a transfer
of operations to England will follow the Government's planned merger of
the company with Cheltenham-based Nuclear Electric.
In an exclusive interview with The Herald, SN's director, Mr John
Moreland, predicted a haemorrhage of highly-skilled jobs would occur if
the merger went ahead prior to privatisation and claimed Government
promises of a Scottish identity within the new company would prove
groundless.
This came at the same time as the Scottish Office was firing off its
latest salvo in the battle for control of the company by firming up
earlier hints of price cuts in the wake of privatisation.
It revealed that Ministers were considering an early end of the
nuclear premium paid by Scottish consumers, resulting in, they claim, a
three to four percent reduction in prices.
Meanwhile, workers' representatives and Labour MPs called for support
against the privatisation moves, telling the Scottish Secretary, Mr Ian
Lang, to leave Scotland's ''model company'' alone.
Since vesting from the South of Scotland Electricity Board in 1990,
Scottish Nuclear has seen steady financial growth from a #33m loss to
#150m profit in 1994/95.
It provides 1750 jobs at three sites at Hunterston, Torness, and East
Kilbride and 4000 more through sub-contracts.
Recent success has seen generating costs fall to 2.2p per kilowatt
hour from 2.9p -- the lowest unit cost for a UK nuclear generator. The
company is on track to achieve a target of 2p per unit by 1998.
Its chief executive, Dr Robin Jeffrey, said the company's performance
had put it in a strong position to ''take on the challenges'' of
privatisation.
The board's preferred option is a privately owned Scottish Nuclear plc
based in East Kilbride running the AGR plants at Torness and Hunterston,
with its Magnox liabilities placed in a separate holding company to
ensure that decommissioning is carried out properly.
However, it now appears the Government plans to privatise the UK
nuclear generating industry next year with Scottish Nuclear and Nuclear
Electric merged into one company controlling six English and the two
Scottish nuclear power stations.
Yesterday, Mr Moreland said the SN board of directors was four-square
behind its workforce in opposing the merger.
He said the issue of ownership of the company was one for the
Government as the sole shareholder to decide. However, the directors
stood first and foremost for an independent and Scottish-based company
irrespective of control, while the merger option with Nuclear Electric
was the worst-case scenario.
He stressed that ''no matter what the colour of Government is'', the
eventual replacement of the Hunterston B generator in 2006 could be
achieved only with private funding.
''We see the best solution as the 4:4 option with two companies of
equal size being offered into the private sector,'' he said.
He said the board gained little comfort from Mr Lang's comments on
Wednesday in which he promised to retain a Scottish identity for the
company.
''It now appears obvious that the 8-0 option is going ahead and if
previous examples such as at BritOil are anything to go by, everything
will move south,'' observed the director.
''We are at one with the employees in fearing that this will mean
shedding many jobs and mean a loss of opportunity for many graduates,
scientists, and other highly skilled personnel.''
The Scottish Nuclear Workers Campaign, which represents the interests
of workers at Hunterston, Torness, and East Kilbride, has called on the
Government to back down.
Yesterday, representatives along with Labour MPs warned that as many
as 400 directly employed workers would lose their jobs at East Kilbride
and 600 more would be made redundant as a spin-off from a merger with
Nuclear Electric.

IN the absence of an all-out strike, Britain's nurses have at their
disposal a wide selection of tactics and strategies which could cause
maximum financial embarrassment for the NHS trusts without affecting
patient care.
At next month's annual congress of the Royal College of Nursing in
Harrogate, the RCN's ruling council will be appealing for backing to
drop the rule which prohibits any withdrawal of service. While a strike
is thought unlikely, it is generally acknowledged that alternative forms
of action could cause severe financial disruption to trusts unwilling to
lay acceptable pay rises on the table.
Scottish nurses, who spoke to The Herald yesterday on the condition of
anonymity, said that for a system which runs on the goodwill,
dedication, and vocation of its staff, the NHS is particularly
vulnerable to people refusing to go the extra yard.
One nurse said the tactics at their disposal, all of which will cost
the NHS money, included:
* Not co-operating with the audit process, which measures clinical
indications and results and provides a basic guide to performance. The
process involves logging how many visits nurses are making to patients,
what the outcomes are. ''It's very important to hospitals and trusts and
it's very much monitored by the Scottish Office on the standards they
are achieving.''
* Manipulating staffing levels. ''Staffing levels are kept low in the
NHS. Many staff are supplemented by agency or bank nurses and unpaid
overtime. If I was a sister in charge, I would say I can't work without
more staff. At the moment, nurses say they do need more staff but they
stay below the level of saying I can't do the shift. They could make
demands for extra staff and agency staff to an extent that the trust
would become finanically embarrassed.''
* Not co-operating with managers. ''For example if you know there's
going to be a gap in shifts in the middle of the day, I could stay for
an extra hour until the next nurse comes in or I could go home and
insist on having an agency nurse. I would just start going home, saying
I had a doctor's appointment or had to pick my kid up from school and I
just couldn't do it.''
* Withholding assistance in the control of financial admissions. ''A
lot of people in hospitals are there for 'cold cases' or electives,
varicose veins, etc. A lot of hospital kudos is in waiting lists. If I
don't inform people I have an empty bed that will delay the speed with
which cold cases come in. It's not going to affect serious and
life-threatening cases.''
* Manipulating ordering strategies. ''For example, I will tell the
stores I need 150 incontinence kits. Maybe yesterday, I would just have
ordered two. I could order drugs, dressings, equipment and just have it
all. Nurses are very conscious of the costs of all the materials that
they use, they certainly could stop considering the costs of things.''
* Claiming overtime and taking off days owed.
Nursing leaders acknowledge that should official action ultimately be
sanctioned, nurses from a particlar hospital who are unhappy at their
pay deal could hold a ballot about industrial action, go to the RCN for
it to be rubber-stamped, inform managers at the trust what action will
be taken and then carry it out, making sure that patients aren't harmed
in any way.
They say that unofficially, many nurses who are demoralised by the
entire pay issue may decide to start taking time they are owed, which
doesn't amount to industrial action.
''Nurses will start to get unco-operative,'' said one nurse yesterday.
''You will put in the hours and all the rest if you feel you are valued.
It's a system which operates on goodwill and vocation and dedication,
and goodwill, vocation, and dedication exist where people feel they are
being taken care of and looked after. If you've got something to gain
from it, you will put in the extra effort. As soon as you feel you are
being treated like journeymen workers, then you will start being like
journeymen workers.''
Ms June Andrews, the Scottish Board secretary for the Royal College of
Nursing, said that it was regrettable that nurses, in search of a fair
way of agreeing pay nationally, had been put in the position of having
to use intelligence and energy on thinking up ways of trying to
inconvenience their employers. ''I think it's really sad that it's come
to this,'' she said.
A health spokesman at the Scottish Office said it was premature to
discuss the issue of action when the RCN had still to vote on whether or
not to change it's constitution, but added: ''Industrial action of any
kind has no place in the National Health Service as it only dislocates
services and disrupts patient care.''

AT Drumchapel Hospital in Glasgow, nurses like Rose Campbell are
dealing with patients -- sometimes up to three new admissions a day --
who require specific medical treatment or rehabilitation.
Mrs Campbell, 50, an enrolled nurse in the 30-bed Arran Ward,
currently clears #800 per month for a 37.5-hour week. She is ready to
take some form of action aimed at affecting ''the smooth running of the
establishment'' rather than her patients.
However, she said: ''When it comes to an all-out strike, that's a
different matter. I would not wish to go that far but I know plenty that
would. They are so angry.
''The work here has changed considerably. We are now involved in
treatment and rehabilitation. There are two or three fresh admissions
every day, people coming and going all the time.
''The turnover is fantastic. There is only a certain percentage we are
allowed to keep. The rest are being moved back into the community.
''We have stroke rehabilitation, which is very fast moving. The whole
nature of the place is very fast moving.
''We are giving them a good return. Our output has gone up
tremendously in the past six to eight months. We are seeing more and
more patients with the same number of staff.
''They are trying to change the skill mix by bringing in more staff
nurses. It is a mixed ward.
''You name it, we can do it -- IV lines, bloods, patients on special
feeding, for example through the abdomen. It is becoming more technical
and the pressure on that side was increased so much there is less time
for the personal touch.
''It is very much a hospital. What we are being asked to accept is in
effect a drop, when you consider inflation.
''I am on the union joint co-ordinating committee and we are making it
clear we are standing united and want a national pay award. We are not
accepting anything else.''

REMEMBER the demographic time-bomb -- the drop in the number of school
leavers, girls in particular, who were going to be available for the
nursing profession in the 1990s?
It held on one hand the threat of crisis for the NHS, and on the other
a golden future for the nurses themselves. Ten years ago, even the most
hardened health managers were talking about the incentives that would be
needed to pull in recruits.
Now, ask any nurse and she will tell you the crisis has arrived -- but
what happened to the incentives?
If market forces make it necessary to stuff the pockets of quango
chiefs and privatised utility bosses, why, the nurses are asking, is the
NHS offering 1% now and the rest when you catch us?
To find the answer, you have to look at how NHS managers have
contrived to keep the crisis at bay by making the treadmill faster. The
nurses' best case, in fact, lies in the figures for NHS performance
which Government Ministers are so fond of parrotting.
In the past 10 years, Scottish hospitals have seen an increase of 22%
in the number of in-patients and 8% in the number of out-patients.
Throughput -- the rate of bed usage -- has increased by 15.6% in the
acute sector, 10.6% in regional specialties, and 46% in obstetrics.
During this time, the number of trained nurses has crept up by 3.9%,
to 53,000 and the number of trainees has dropped by 70%, to 7918.
It means that almost the same number of nurses are caring for a
hugely-increased number of patients who, because they are in hospital
for shorter periods, need more care while they are there.
The nurse's job has changed in other ways, ways which they broadly
welcome -- if they get the rewards.
The Lady with the Lamp has become the lady, or man, with the
intravenous drip, the prescription pad, the suture needle -- and even
the scalpel.
Notwithstanding the recent case of a theatre nurse in the West Country
who was carpeted for carrying out an appendectomy, nurses can
legitimately take on some of the surgeon's territory.
They can qualify for the new post of cardiac surgeon's assistants,
taking the place of the second surgeon in a coronary by-pass. While the
lead surgeon opens the chest and exposes the heart, the assistant opens
the leg and takes out the vein to be used for the graft. Nurses are
expected to play an increasing role, too, in anaesthetics.
Nurse practitioners are taking over the doctor's role in casualty
departments and GP surgeries. A patient with a minor wound can turn up
in accident and emergency in hospitals like Stobhill or Falkirk Royal
and be assessed, diagnosed, treated, and sent home without a doctor
coming near them.
In terms of job satisfaction, it is what nurses have been looking for
but they want the time to do it and the rewards.
Ms June Andrews, secretary to the Scottish Board of the Royal College
of Nursing, says: ''The resources which were made available to reduce
junior doctors' hours don't appear to have taken into account the
increased workload of nurses.
''It is not that they object to this wider role. They are used to
teaching junior doctors how to do things anyway.''
The expanded role has been made possible by new guidelines issued by
the nurses' accreditation body, the UKCC, in a document called Scope of
Professional Practice.
''In the past, you did your nurse's training but it was quite limited
and to go beyond it you had to get an extended role certificate,'' Ms
Andrews explained.
''I would have to qualify as a nurse, work in a ward, and if some of
the patients needed intravenous therapy, I would have to spend time with
the doctors learning to do supervised drips.
''But the certificate did not transfer from one hospital to another.
You had to keep being re-certificated -- keep re-inventing the wheel,
more or less.
''The new guidelines mean that if you are a registered nurse and you
want to do something specialised, your most important responsibility is
to satisfy yourself that you are trained to do it. You just go ahead and
do it, with the proviso, of course, that the hospital has asked you to
do it.
''The cardiac surgeon's assistant is a dramatic example but there is
always a surgeon at the business end and an anaesthetist and it is a
relatively simple thing to do if you are not having to worry about
whether the patient is alive.
''There are other areas where the nurse knows more than the doctors,
for example, in skin care or wound care. You end up with the silly
situation where the nurse knows everything there is to know about
algimate dressings and can get the thing clear in half the time but has
to go to a doctor to ask if she can use it.
''The nurse will be able to do a lot of things that were once done by
junior doctors -- taking blood, making diagnoses, prescribing . . .
examinations are next.
''The feeling doctors have about this is that the clever thing is not
missing things and that is why you need to know a lot, but the nurse
practitioner is no more likely to miss something than a junior doctor.''
''Nurses can be invaluable for GPs, to counsel the 'worried well', to
ease the pressure of people coming through the door and taking up a lot
of time.
''There is reason to believe that for some things, like depression,
seeing a nurse is better anyway. The GP has to screen the patient first
to ensure there us not a physical problem.''

Taegu, Friday
RESCUERS worked through Friday night to seek survivors of a rush-hour
gas blast which killed at least 100 people, more than half of them
schoolchildren, in South Korea's third largest city.
The explosion, caused by a leaking gas main at a subway construction
site, hurled cars, lorries, and buses into the air and scattered
thousands of steel plates being used as a temporary road surface through
the air in a deadly hail.
A spokesman for an anti-disaster squad working in Taegu, about 150
miles south of Seoul, said that 101 people were dead and around 200
injured, making it one of South Korea's worst peacetime disasters.
State television and local media, quoting police, put the death toll
even higher -- up to 110 killed with more than 200 injured.
Some 2500 rescuers picked through grisly debris in the hope of finding
survivors. Hundreds worked through the night, the scene lit eerily by
huge arc lamps.
The blast sent vehicles vaulting through the air and a temporary grid
of steel plates the size of office desks flew like missiles, crushing
and dismembering pedestrians.
''I heard a loud bang and flames rose about 50yd into the air, taking
with it steel plates,'' said a taxi driver.
Scores of cars were idling at a traffic signal when they were blasted
into the air by the explosion. Witnesses said a bus taking pupils to
nearby schools plunged into a gaping pit excavated for the subway
construction.
An Education Ministry spokesman said 45 pupils from one middle school
had been confirmed killed. More were feared dead because they did not
report for morning registration.
Rescue officials said the death toll would rise as many survivors were
in critical condition. Prime Minister Lee Hong-koo, after visiting the
scene, said more than half the dead were school-age teenagers.
''The fact that more than half of the victims were young students
makes our hearts ache even more,'' he said.
Park Yoon-ho, 17, a high-school pupil, said he heard a loud explosion
as he walked to school. ''Then I was blown down by a gust that sent out
a mushroom of dust. It looked like the explosion of an atomic bomb on
television.''
Witnesses said a sheet of flame erupted from the site and the blast
shook buildings like an earthquake. About 70 buildings were badly
damaged and columns of black smoke rose amid the piles of steel plates.
The blast fractured water pipes and water poured into the construction
pit, delaying rescue work. The explosion also cut electricity in the
area.
Gas suppliers said they suspected an excavator had punctured a gas
supply pipe. State radio said the explosion was apparently caused by
welding work which set off gas leaking from a supply pipe. There was no
independent confirmation.
It was South Korea's second fatal gas explosion in less than five
months. In December, 12 people were killed by an underground gas
explosion in a central district of Seoul.
It is also the latest in a chapter of disasters to plague South Korea.
A bridge in central Seoul collapsed last October during the morning rush
hour, killing more than 30 people.
A few days later a pleasure craft exploded into an inferno of flames
on a lake, killing a similar number of people.
President Kim Young-sam, reeling from yet another man-made disaster
during his term of office, ordered a swift inquiry and sent Lee to the
scene.
''Government agencies should take the best possible course of action
to ascertain the exact cause of the disaster and to control its
aftermath,'' Kim said.
The blast was expected to cause a public outcry ahead of June 27 local
council elections, the first electoral test for Kim who began his
five-year term in February 1993.--Reuter.

Paris, Friday
FRENCH conservatives buried past quarrels today to back Jacques Chirac
for the presidency, while Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin held out the
prospect of Jacques Delors as a possible premier if the left wins the
race.
The run-off to succeed Socialist Francois Mitterrand, who steps down
after 14 years in power, will take place on May 7. Mitterrand today gave
Jospin his backing.
In a broad display of unity on the Right after fratricidal rivalry,
Chirac's defeated opponent, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, will lead
senior Cabinet members who had previously backed him in to a Chirac
rally tomorrow just outside Paris.
Former president Valery Giscard d'Estaing and defeated anti-Maastricht
candidate Philippe de Villiers also promised to attend the rally,
expected to draw 15,000 to 20,000 people.
In a further boost for Chirac, an opinion poll published today
credited him with 55% of voting intentions to Jospin's 45%.
The latest survey found that an overwhelming 80% of the 18.6% of
voters who chose Balladur in the first round would heed the premier's
call to vote for Chirac in the run-off.
Jospin, who topped the first ballot, was seen winning over most of
those who voted for Communist Robert Hue, Trotskyite Arlette Laguiller,
and ecologist Dominique Voynet.
Jospin ruled out disclosing Cabinet choices before results of the
second round election are known, but said he was pleased that Delors,
former head of the European Commission, had left the door open to
serving in his government if he won.
''This is a man for whom the French people have enormous respect, even
admiration, and I think this is a man who could contribute significantly
to his country,'' Jospin said in an interview.--Reuter.

Rome, Friday
ITALY'S fascist dictator Benito Mussolini was shot by accident and his
execution staged using the corpse, the wartime partisan who captured him
said today.
Speaking on the 50th anniversary of the death of Il Duce, resistance
fighter Urbano Lazzaro said Mussolini and his mistress Claretta Petacci
had been dead for four hours when their ''execution'' took place at
Giulino di Mezzegra, overlooking Lake Como in northern Italy.
He said the couple died some way away when Petacci tried to grab a gun
from one of the guards escorting them to Milan for Mussolini's planned
public execution.
''She was screaming 'Ben, they want to kill you'. Two or three shots
went off in the struggle and hit Mussolini who dropped in agony. They
finished him off on the spot and then shot Petacci for causing the
accident,'' he said.
''The rest was all staged.
''If it had become known that it was an accident, it wouldn't have
fitted in with the ideas of justice which were fundamental to the
resistance movement. The times demanded an execution.''
Mussolini was captured by Lazzaro at Dongo, on Lake Como, on April 27
1945 as he tried to flee to Switzerland disguised as a German soldier in
a retreating column of German troops and top officials of his crumbling
fascist republic.--Reuter.
