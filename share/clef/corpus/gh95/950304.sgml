<HEADLINE>#25m wiped off Dawson shares. Pringle owner hit by profits warning</HEADLINE>

ABOUT #25m was wiped off the value of Edinburgh-based knitwear and
clothing group Dawson International yesterday, after a profits warning.
Shares dived 12[1/2]p to 96[1/2]p, cutting market capitalisation from
#218m to #193m, after the company said second-half profits would be
''modestly below'' current expectations.
Dawson, whose brands include Pringle, said it had commissioned
consultants to assist in the appraisal of certain businesses where
returns had not proved adequate or which were consuming a
disproportionate share of resources.
It warned of ''significant'' exceptional provisions in the current
year to March but said the cash element of these was not expected to be
a major part.
Already difficult market conditions, including higher raw material
prices, have been compounded by the mild winter.
Managing director Nick Kuenssberg would not disclose which operations
were under consideration and said no decisions had yet been taken.
Yesterday's announcement was a ''holding statement'', with more detail
due in the next few weeks.
Dawson, which sustained a pre-tax loss of #95.4m in its last financial
year, has been going through a process of radical change, including an
expensive withdrawal from loss-making US operations.
If Dawson is finding itself under pressure, it may be forced to cut
costs in its US thermal underwear businesses, with orders from chain
stores perhaps suffering from the mild weather.
Dawson may also be reassessing its UK United Brands knitwear and
clothing operation, which produces lines other than the high-profile
Pringle and Ballantyne, such as Braemar, McGeorge, and Glenmac. The
division has recently found the going tough.
Chairman Sir Ronald Miller said the restructuring of Dawson's US
operations during 1994 and continuing difficult and deteriorating
conditions in some of its markets had led the group to examine
rigorously its operations going forward.
He added: ''It is essential to continue the process of change in order
to improve the returns to our shareholders, by focusing our resources on
the growth of the businesses where we have strong market positions.''
Although shares recovered from an intra-day low of 90p, analysts
expressed surprise at the extent of the collapse in Dawson's share
price. They believed the benefits from long-overdue restructuring, as
well as the rejuvenation of design and marketing, would take time to
feed through.
In the first six months, Dawson, which raised a net #45.4m from a
one-for-four rights issue at 120p last May, raised pre-tax profits from
#8m to #15.8m.

COSTANTINO Rocca, the amiable Italian who will always be remembered
for bursting into tears after a Ryder Cup defeat, shot a course record
65 at the Andalucia Open in Huelva yesterday.
His magnificent round gave him a 36-hole aggregate of 136, six under
par, and a three-shot lead over David Carter, Alexander Cejka and Des
Smyth.
Phillip Price and Jon Robson are at two under, with Santiago Luna, at
one under, the only other player in the 144-strong field still below par
after two windswept days on a difficult course.
Jose Maria Olazabal, the reigning US Masters champion who is making a
comeback after an operation on his big right toe, could only manage a 76
for 148, but scraped into the last two days on the last qualifying
score.
Rocca owed his course record to superb putting, especially on the back
nine in which he single-putted seven greens.
He said: ''My big target is to make the Ryder Cup team again, but I
shall need many good rounds to do that. I think I must win at least two
tournaments because, if you don't win some, you will not be there.''
Rocca, beaten by American Davis Love in the 1993 Ryder Cup match after
being one up with two to play, was unfairly made the scapegoat by many
people after the European team had been beaten.
''I did my best then,'' said the 38-year-old Italian, ''but I would
like another chance to show that I can do better.''
So he is extra keen to win the #50,000 first prize this week which
could possibly lift him to fourth place in the cup points table.
Carter, born in Johannesburg of English parents, did national service
for a year in South Africa before returning to England in 1991. Going
out early, he shot a course record 66 (later to be beaten by Rocca), his
best round on the European Tour to date.
He finished top of the Tour qualifying school in November and is the
only player to have competed in all seven Tour events this year.
Cejka, who defected from Czechoslovakia with his father when he was
nine in 1980, shot 68 today, and Smyth, the joint first-round leader
with Luna, shot 71.
Welshman Mark Litton had the distinction of being the only player to
birdie the horrific thirtenth, while Argentinian Jose Coceres had the
misfortune to score an 11 at the third hole before wisely retiring.
* BORDERER Craig Hislop will fly the Scottish flag alone in today's
quarter-finals of the Spanish Amateur championship at the Club de Campo
course in Malaga.
The 20-year-old from Powfoot successfully negotiated two rounds in the
Spanish sunshine yesterday, but there was no such joy for fellow
countrymen Barclay Howard and Les McLaughlin, both of whom fell at the
second hurdle.
Hislop, the 1991 Scottish Boys' champion, began his progress in the
morning by brushing aside the challenge of Frenchman Ilya Goroneskoul 6
and 5.
In the afternoon, he faced a tougher opponent in the shape of Spaniard
Felix Lubenau, but in a match that was always close, Hislop held his
nerve to run out an eventual 2 and 1 winner.
In today's quarter-finals, the Powfoot player will face the
experienced Spaniard Jose Maria Zamora, who accounted for the scalp of
Cochrane Castle's Barclay Howard by 5 and 4. Scottish results:
First round -- C Hislop (Powfoot) bat I Goroneskoul (France), 6 and 5;
L McLaughlin (Cowglen) beat J Girdo (Spain), 2 holes; B Howard (Cochrane
Castle) bt J Cestino (Spain), 4 and 3.
Second round -- Hislop beat F Lubenau (Spain), 2 and 1; McLaughlin
lost to V Gustavsson (Sweden), 2 and 1; Howard lost to J M Zamora
(Spain), 5 and 4.

IN LARKHALL, where it is said you have a better chance of spotting a
duck-billed platypus than a Celtic supporter, it is also a rare event to
stumble over a rugby man.
Football, and Rangers in particular, have dominated the sporting
ponderings of the folk from that Lanarkshire town so completely that the
oval ball game is treated generally with indifference.
Yet working in that town, where he came from, is one of the year's
great rugby heroes, a man who has achieved a magnificent milestone at a
time when most rugger players, and all bar goalkeepers in the other
game, have decided to opt for less demanding exercise.
Stewart Hamilton, captain of Stirling County, will never forget the
last few weeks, when he and his team-mates headed for the first division
championship title and completed one of the most remarkable climbs to
the top in any sport in this country.
From seventh division all the way through to the highest club spot in
the land is a remarkable journey and for 14 years of that momentous trip
Hamilton, 6ft 4in and built to fill in doorways, has been part of the
furniture.
It is the unlikeliest of scenarios for a lad from a part of the world
where rugby does not get much credibility. Indeed, he acknowledges that
until he was 22 he had never even seen a rugby ball. ''I had never seen
a game of rugby and if it was on the telly I would have switched over to
the racing.''
If the firm, Hamilton's of Larkhall, had not sent him to work in their
Stirling depot the chances are that he would still be tuning into
Channel 4 when he was not turning up to watch Rangers play.
Until then he had played football -- ''I was a left half, the only
left-footer in Larkhall.'' For four years after he packed in playing
amateur football he didn't take any sporting exercise as he went through
his apprenticeship to become an agricultural mechanic.
The first time anybody mentioned the idea of playing rugby came at the
depot, when Trevor Logan saw this giant of a man approaching through the
doors. ''I think he nearly had a heart attack. He suggested it would be
a good idea to get down to the rugby club.''
Not long after, at a stag party, he got involved with the rugby crew,
went to the training the following week, and doesn't think he has missed
many sessions since.
At 39, Hamilton is better placed than most to compare then and now. He
would tell you that the fitness level in the game has improved so much
that he believes he is as fit now as he was at 22, simply because of the
greater professionalism (if that is the right word) in the sport.
He did not know as much as a basic rule of the game, but gradually got
to grips with the idea, and the enjoyment of getting fit again soon
encouraged him to learn what it was all about.
He discovered he was pretty fair at it -- ''I wasn't setting any
heather on fire initially'' -- a big lad who played the big boys' game
reasonably well.
When Stewart got married he and his wife, Jackie, lived in Banknock,
and then moved to Stirling, where their two sons, Gregor (11) and Scot
(7), play rugby at Dollar Academy and support Rangers.
Meanwhile, dad was establishing a growing reputation and in 1984 he
was chosen for the Scotland squad and played for Glasgow District. ''I
got a phone call from Andy Irvine (I had heard of him all right, but I
didn't know him) and he asked me to join Heriot's.
''That was a great chance to give my career another kick-start and for
three seasons I thoroughly enjoyed it.'' He won two Scotland B caps
during that spell, adding: ''By the way, they were hard to get at that
time, not like now.''
Second-row lock was always his position, but his climb upwards never
reached the highest point with a full cap for his country. If there is
anything this large, cheerful man regrets in life it is that he did not
get the chance to play for his country at that level.
He returned to Stirling County in 1987, after he had been invited to
join London Scottish on a tour of Australia. When he came back,
following five weeks Down Under, he reckoned it was about the right time
to contribute some more to Stirling.
The club was still in the second division, where they had been when he
left, but he would call those the consolidation years. The continuing
ability to unearth good players from places like ICI, BP and the
university helped that process and propelled the team to greater glory,
reaching the first division the second year after he had returned, 1989.
He was appointed captain then, served for two years, but had to
abandon all play when a nerve in his arm was accidentally severed when
he was having treatment for an arm injury.
''I could not play for six months,'' he recalled, and then explained
how he managed to retain his fitness well enough to play again.
Intriguing stuff, it is, too.
''I actually owe it to a row with my brother, Douglas, who is joint
managing director with me here,'' he said. ''We fell out and I said 'I'm
off,' and I did, I just went away.
''I first walked the West Highland Way and then trained every day I
didn't work at Forthbank. I was off work for two months and that helped
me keep fit. So I suppose I can thank him for that.''
They are pals again, of course, and if the rift did propel Hamilton
back to County's first XV Douglas might be due a shot of the trophy in
his living room. ''There are only seven names on that cup,'' says
Stewart. ''All famous rugby clubs. And we are the seventh.''
He has not made any decisions about his future, other than that he
will get himself fit and be available to play in the first XV if wanted.
''I will keep myself fit and if Stirling want my services in some way I
will be there.''
He would also like to stay in the game when he does leave the playing
side. ''I think I'd like to work with the young players for a start to
develop my coaching skills. I have had far too much pleasure and
enjoyment to walk away from it.''
He and his family enjoy a rather different lifestyle to the one he was
used to as a boy in Larkhall. One of his favourite tales illustrates
that best. Pointing out that there is a chapel in Larkhall, he goes on:
''When I was a wee lad, the priest's dog burst my ball and my mum told
me to go to his door and get the money to buy a new one. I said to her:
'How can I do that? They don't use the same money as us.' ''
His visions have been broadened a bit since then, with tours of
Australia and South Africa, not to mention Stirlingshire, and he has
typically honest views of the current controversy over professionalism
in the game.
He cites one example of the way it is elsewhere. ''Recently, we have
been playing a Welsh team, Bridgend, the day before the international
between Scotland and Wales (they met yesterday). When we are down there
we watch them queue up in the dressing room to get their envelope at the
end. I believe they get #200 a man for a game.''
It seems to him not unreasonable that if any money is generated it
should go to the players, who are the main reason it is forthcoming.
''What brought 4000 into the stadium last Saturday was the 15 players on
the park.''
He and his team-mates managed without any outside help to have a long,
demanding celebration after last week's clinching of the title. He did
not even win #20 from international coach Douglas Morgan . . . ''I bet
him that last year and we didn't do it. This time he refused the bet. He
knew something.''
Maybe Stewart will have one extra night out yet. Terry Butcher, the
former Rangers captain whose son plays rugby alongside Gregor at Dollar,
has promised dinner for him and coach Muff Scobie, plus wives, at Bridge
of Allan. ''Put that in, just in case he has forgotten.'' Have you got
that, Tel?

AIRDRIE keeper John Martin puts himself back in the firing line today
against Raith Rovers, even though he has been nursing a giant-sized
headache all week.
Martin showed his courage last week when he remained on the field
during the one-goal win over St Mirren, despite a horrendous head injury
received in an accidental collision.
Manager Alex Macdonald said yesterday: ''Try telling him he is not
fit.
''When I saw the head gash last week I was almost sick, but he is so
courageous he just keeps going.''
Adding extra spice to the match is the fact that the clubs meet again
next week in the Scottish Cup.
Raith midfield player Jason Dair is struggling after receiving a knee
injury in a collision with reserve keeper Brian Potter. However, Danny
Lennon could be back and Colin Cameron is fit.
Dundee have covered their pitch against the weather and manager Jim
Duffy is intent in getting the three points against Hamilton, who will
travel with a fully fit squad.
There should be a large crowd at East End Park where leaders
Dunfermline face rejuvenated St Johnstone.
At the other end of the table, Stranraer and St Mirren have injury
problems for their clash. Stranraer are without Tom Callaghan and Billy
Ferguson, while St Mirren are minus Jamie Fullarton, Norrie McWhirter,
and John Hewitt.
A 9.30am inspection of snow-bound Kilbowie will decide if Clydebank
meet Ayr United, but it could be these two will have to wait until
Tuesday.

STENHOUSEMUIR manager Terry Christie has signed East Stirling
full-back Gordon Russell for #10,000. He goes straight into the team to
face Queen of the South at Ochilview.
Queen's add Kevin Heatherington to their squad.
Morton, who top the league on goal difference, will have to do without
midfielder Alan Mahood against Clyde at Cappielow. Mahood has a
hamstring injury.
The visitors' who again wait for a check on George McCluskey, are the
division's highest scorers and only five points off the pace. In
addition they won 1-0 on their previous visit to Greenock.
Berwick Rangers will be looking for revenge over visitors Meadowbank
who put them out of the cup. The Borderers have Mark Cowan back while
Thistle wait for Stewart Williamson and Graham Davidson.
Dumbarton do not score many goals away from home but they should be
able to remedy that when they visit Steve Archibald's East Fife, who
have conceded 20 at Methil.
Stirling Albion visit Brechin who have not conceded a goal in two
matches.
The Third Division's match of the day is between the top two clubs at
Forfar. The home side have nine wins and two draws on their own ground,
but Ross County have conceded only nine goals away from home, the best
record in Scotland.
East Stirling add David Watt for the visit of Queen's Park, who have
appointed Hugh McCann as their new coach.
Cowdenbeath visit Caley Thistle in search of points which might yet
keep them in contention for promotion.

THE one Scot the Welsh will be happy to miss out on meeting this
weekend is Derek Turnbull. For in two Murrayfield encounters with the
Red Dragons, the Hawick back-row man, known to his pals as ''the
laughing policeman,'' has helped to inflict two heavy defeats on Wales.
In 199l, the ninety-fifth meeting of the two countries, Scotland won
by 32-12 and ''we were not flattered by the score,'' recalls Turnbull.
He takes special delight in remembering one of the four home tries.
''It was started by Gary Armstrong deep inside our own half, John
Jeffrey carried on the move, I handled as well, and ''Chic'' Chalmers
went over. That was a great score.''
Gary himself had a touchdown that day and Derek White collected two.
''They said at the time it was our most devastating forward display for
years.''
Maybe so, but 1993 wasn't all that tame either. The Scots triumphed
20-0, a lad called Gavin Hastings landing five penalty goals. But Derek
Turnbull grabbed the game's only try.
''Damian Cronin caught a lineout ball, he knocked a hole in the
defence, gave it to me and, with Iain Morrison's help, I scorched over
from two metres. I have always been deadly from that distance, as you
know!''
Turnbull, an officer with the Lothians and Borders constabulary, might
lay claim to being Scotland's most travelled player. He has been on
seven Scottish tours, including the 1987 World Cup, and has played in
five non-cap internationals, against Zimbabwe (2), Japan, USA and
Canada.
In addition, he was in the Border Club seven who competed in the
Benidorm tournament three years ago, journeyed to the then Soviet Union
with the Barbarians, and with the British Police XV on a visit to South
Africa. At 33, with 15 full caps to his credit, is he ready to put the
passport back in the drawer?
''No way. My intention is to be in Scotland's World Cup squad in South
Africa and I am going all out to convince the selectors I deserve to be
included in the party.''
His progress was stalled by an early season injury and he had ''a wee
sabbatical'' after being sent off in a league game against Edinburgh
Academicals. Since his return, however, Hawick have climbed up the
table; all his team-mates speak highly of his inspirational qualities.
''Scottish rugby needs a strong Hawick team and it is important we
retain our first division status.''
Turnbull was at the Scotland forward training session on Wednesday
night, so is far from being the forgotten man. He is confident of a
fifth successive home victory over Wales this afternoon.
''The boys are really playing well for each other this season. They
are also spreading the play much better. I have every expectation they
will go to Twickenham bidding for a Grand Slam.''
Don't mention retirement to him. ''Somebody asked me about that the
other day. I will never give up rugby.
''When I am too old to play, I will coach or I'll run the line or I'll
serve on a committee. For me, it is not a game, it's a way of life.''
This copper will continue to run in the tries for a while yet.

AC Milan and Genoa plan to appeal against two-match ground closures
imposed as punishment following the violent clashes between their
supporters which cost a fan his life.
A disciplinary committee decided on Thursday that the clubs must play
two league games a minimum of 100 kilometres away from their home
grounds.
A 24-year-old Genoa fan died after he was stabbed during fighting
before his team's home game with Milan on January 29. The match was
abandoned at half-time amid violent protests by angry Genoa supporters.
''It is unacceptable that a club should be punished for events which
it can neither predict nor prevent,'' said Milan managing director
Adriano Galliani.

IN the genteel world of Glasgow rugby, there is panic. Although
Stirling County have now won the league championship, and deservedly so,
GHK are sitting ninth on 11 points, West of Scotland tenth on 10 points.
All this in a season that sees the leagues reduce to a top division of
eight teams, and the writing is on the wall for some of Glasgow's
finest. It is accompanied by some of the toughest talking from some of
them.
Last Saturday, Walter Malcolm, the much respected GHK captain, took
the unprecedented step of dropping himself for his side's tussle with
Gala. GHK lost, plunging themselves ever deeper into despair.
West of Scotland's league campaign finishes with tough games against
Currie and Edinburgh Accies -- and they see a hard road ahead.
Gordon MacPherson, the Otago second-row who played in the side that
defeated Gavin Hastings' Lions, now coaches the forwards at West of
Scotland. He sees obvious points of concern, and equally obvious steps
to rectify a situation that might see Glasgow, literally, in the second
division.
''I think that there will have to be amalgamation sooner rather than
later,'' he says. ''You just have to look around you to see that there
are too many clubs trying to attract the top players.''
Any GHK player you care to stop in the street says openly that part of
the problem is that the coaches are not up to it, while many of the
committee will tell you that the effort expended by the players of a
Saturday is, on occasion, a disgrace. There is conflict in the club.
Walter Malcolm is captain of GHK, and perhaps he should know what has
happened to his outfit best. ''Stirling County have left the rest of us
far behind,'' he says. ''West, ourselves, Accies and some of the other
teams have a hard core of players who are talented and prepared to put
the effort in. Outside that there's not a lot there.
''There is definitely a Glasgow malaise. Everyone in the city know it
exists in a rugby context, and I think that, although some of the
players may have individual ambition, they lack it collectively. They
don't want it badly enough.''
Unlike MacPherson, Malcolm does not see amalgamation as an obvious
route. ''The problem is that it is cyclical,'' says Malcolm. ''One
minute we are top dogs, the next it's Accies or West. That's the way it
has always been, and there are so many people in control of their own
little worlds that I just can't ever see it happening.''
Perhaps the key to the city's future is for it to make use of its
coaching talent. I have to admit to watching a bunch of fairly ordinary
forwards playing for West last week, and thinking straight away that
they looked well drilled. MacPherson's hand was there.
''I have found it quite difficult to coach some of the players,
because they have not been taught the basics,'' he says. ''What's even
worse is that we have to molly-coddle players in the city sometimes.
They are soft.
''To my mind, even if one of the clubs makes it this year, for the
long-term benefit of the club set-up in the city they have to get
together to produce real strength.
''How many clubs have one set of training lights at the side of one
pitch? Too many, that's how many. Also, they are not set up to thrive
socially. Enjoying yourself as a group in a club context is almost
taboo.''
But he sees the odd ray of hope. ''At West we have some good
youngsters -- Guy Perret and Andy Bulloch are good examples. They now
need pressure rugby, and to work with skilled players. They will only
get that if the clubs get together.''
There you have it. Two of the most respected names in Glasgow rugby,
the same problem, and some conflict. To my mind the city has to sort
itself out. If it does not, it runs the risk of becoming a joke in rugby
terms. Watch this space.

THE performance given by club captain Paul McStay against Real Madrid
in Malaga in midweek was good enough for him to regain his place in the
side to face Aberdeen at Hampden tomorrow.
From a live televised game in Malaga to another in Glasgow, McStay
seems sure to parade his skills after an absence when manager Tommy
Burns believed that the Scotland internationalist had dropped below his
normal playing standards.
Yesterday, however, Burns was quick to praise McStay's contribution in
a game which Celtic lost 2-0.
''Paul is back to the form we know he is capable of producing and,
against a top quality team, he was able to match any of their players,''
said Burns. ''It has been a difficult time for him recently but he has
reacted magnificently.''
The Celtic manager will have Tom Boyd available after suspension but
Dutchman Pierre van Hooydonk is suffering from a groin strain although
he will be given every chance to prove his fitness.
Aberdeen will be without Dutch keeper Theo Snelders, who is suspended
after having been sent off against Motherwell last week. Michael Watt
will take over and Stewart McKimmie and Brian Grant also look set to
return.
Meanwhile, two players could be leaving Celtic over the weekend. Mike
Galloway's transfer to Leicester City could be finalised and former
Parkhead manager Liam Brady, now in charge at Brighton, wants to take
Albanian utility man Rudi Vata south for a trial period.
''We have agreed to let Rudi travel south to look at the Brighton
set-up. Mike Galloway's loan period ends soon and we will be talking to
Leicester manager Mark McGhee,'' said Burns.
Partick Thistle's pitch cover should allow their game against Hearts
to go ahead -- and that could benefit the Edinburgh side.
If the match takes place, midfield player Jim Bett's suspension would
be over and he would be able to play against Dundee United in the
Scottish Cup next weekend. Hearts captain Craig Levein is already ruled
out of the tie.
Kilmarnock will be without their striker, Tom Brown, who is still
injured, when Dundee United come to Rugby Park hoping to continue their
recent revival.
The Tannadice side will be without Scotland internationalist Billy
McKinlay but manager Ivan Golac hopes to have his midfield player fit
for the rearranged league game with Partick Thistle and the cup tie at
Tynecastle next week.
Teenager Andy Stewart -- fourth choice keeper at Tannadice -- is in
the squad as back-up to Kelham O'Hanlon.
United are pursuing their interest in Benfica midfield player Rui
Estevez whom Golac sees as a possible replacement for McKinlay, whose
outstanding recent form has attracted interest from Aston Villa.
There will be an inspection this morning at Motherwell's Fir Park
which could mean Falkirk's recent signing, Maurice Johnston, having to
delay making his debut for the Brockville side.

HIBS believe that their major route to Europe next season will be
through finishing second to Rangers in the premier division, although
they also recognise that they could qualify by winning the Scottish Cup.
At Easter Road today they will try to delay Rangers' title charge but
their Northern Ireland internationalist, Michael O'Neil, admitted: ''We
have given up on the title itself even though we are close to the top
and a win over Rangers would take us closer.
''But it has reached the stage that you just cannot imagine Rangers
making such a mess of things that they will lose the title.
''I doubt if anyone can see that happening, so we have to set our
sights on second place in the league. That would guarantee us a place in
Europe. I know that the Scottish Cup remains a possible route as well
but after all our hard work in the league we have to look there and hope
for the one remaining UEFA Cup place.
''The difference between Rangers and other clubs is simple -- they can
go to places when they are under-strength, or out of form, and still get
a result. Other teams don't have that quality.''
O'Neil said what many others believe -- but won't put into words --
although he will not let it affect him today.
''We cannot afford to lose. If we did, then we could go further behind
Motherwell and we don't want that even though they have still to come to
Easter Road later in the season,'' he said.
Rangers will be without left back David Robertson, who was injured
against Kilmarnock at Ibrox last week.
Charlie Miller starts a three-game suspension but Neil Murray is added
to the squad which was on duty last week.

When the new personal bond PEPs do arrive, investors will have a much
better range of choices between income and growth
THE investment industry, particularly the unit trust sector of it, is
anxious to know what the rules will be for allowing corporate bonds and
other fixed interest securities to be tax-sheltered inside personal
equity plans. They had been hoping to see them this month, but the worry
now is that they will not be published until some time in April.
The delay is unwelcome because the new tax year starts on April 6, and
the trust managers would have liked to be able to set out their stalls
with the new income-rich products in time to tempt the first buyers of
the new tax year. Now the new launches are unlikely to appear before
May.
M&amp;G, the unit trust group which is probably the biggest PEP provider,
has warned that the whole thing could be a damp squib unless the Inland
Revenue agrees to loosen its proposed regulations, mainly by allowing
the inclusion of sterling securities issued -- so far only by large
companies -- in the offshore Eurobond market. It argues that if the
regulations are too tightly drawn, the Government may ''miss a great
opportunity'' to provide British firms with a fresh source of finance.
The industry took its concerns to the Inland Revenue last week and
suggested how the regulations could be relaxed. These ideas are now
being discussed with the Treasury.
''I am sure there will be some relaxation,'' says one industry source,
''but this large and unexplained delay makes prediction difficult.''
M&amp;G, which is reckoned to have increased its proportion of PEP sales
from around 10% of the industry last year to 14% or so this year, is
currently pulling in an average of #30m a month for its managed income
and managed growth products. Rather more than half the money is going
into the income version.
Rachel Medill, the group's spokeswoman, comments: ''You can see the
potential. We believe that having a fixed interest PEP will be extremely
popular. A corporate bond PEP giving a yield of, say, 9% would be very
attractive. It would have the potential to bridge the gap between equity
and building society investment. Our biggest challenge is to expand our
market into building society territory. Traditionally, the unit trust
industry has been bad at that. Corporate bonds would help.''
She makes the point, however, that the industry will have a moral duty
to ensure investors realise what they are buying. ''We will have an
enormous responsibility to make people understand that it is not
guaranteed. It is a stepping stone between low and relatively high risk.
We must make that very clear.''
M&amp;G knows that, by and large, its unit holders are more interested in
gardening than gambling. They are probably aged about 50 and appreciate
a cautious approach. ''When things are fashionable we tend to be a bit
wary,'' comments Ms Medill. ''We tend not to launch new funds just
because they are the fashion. There has to be a good investment
reason.''
The PEP market is bringing in younger investors. ''The tax-free
wrapper appeals,'' she explains. So PEP investors are more in the 40 to
45 age bracket. They are also more likely to take up regular savings
plans which ''is extremely healthy -- that way you are not taking a
gamble on the timing''.
M&amp;G's investment skills are not confined to its own unit and life
businesses. It manages money for institutional investors such as pension
funds and has recently started developing an international business. It
is already in America through a link with Dreyfuss Corporation, now part
of Mellon Bank, and is setting up an office in Hong Kong. Through a
joint venture with the Dah Sing Banking and Financial Services Group, it
expects to sell unit trusts in Far Eastern markets including China as
well as managing funds for Far Eastern institutions.
The company is also looking to a wider audience in the UK, seeking to
make personal pensions another core business. ''We see that there will
be a huge growth in personal pensions as the Government provides less
and less funding for old age,'' Ms Medill says. ''We hope we will be
among the top 15 players in the next two to three years.''
This will involve M&amp;G targeting a different age range. ''For pensions
we are going to be looking much more at the thirtysomething to
fortysomething group, and quite a lot of self-employed people. We have a
very well-known and established customer base who are very important to
us, but we are now looking to appeal to a wider audience as well.''
The group's investment track record is likely to be the key element in
its move to expand in personal pensions. ''We are good investors,'' she
says, ''better than a lot of life and pension specialists. We are very
satisfied with our pension products.
''Investment has to be the first stage but we will be absolutely clear
about charges. Disclosure was supposed to make charges easier for people
to understand. I think it is not making it very much easier at the
moment -- you need to read all the small print.''
Charges will be another possible point of contention and confusion
when the next fixed interest PEPs make their appearance. Will the
charges come out of capital, where growth potential is clearly limited,
or will they be taken from income? It is a tricky problem because
investors in these products will be looking for the highest income they
can safely get but will also be reluctant to see their capital being
whittled away.
M&amp;G will be sticking to its policy of taking the conservative
approach, taking the charges out of income and making it all as clear as
possible for the investor.
When the new personal bond PEPs do arrive, investors will have a much
better range of choices between income and growth but will have to be
clear which they want. High immediate income is usually achieved at the
expense of lower long-term growth.

Florida
ALTHOUGH Davis Love III was 10 under par after 36 holes at the Doral
Open, and held a two-stroke lead after the players with morning tee
times had completed their rounds yesterday, he finished in many ways
less satisfied with the result than Colin Montgomerie, though he was six
strokes and 30 players behind Love.
The American described his round as a series of wasted strokes, though
he noted that that was an actual boost to confidence since he was not
struggling, just squandering.
Montgomerie admitted to feeling nervous after his opening-round 72
left him in danger of missing the cut in this week's birdie fest at
Doral. But a six-birdie, two-bogey round of 68 perked him up. ''It's
encouraging to shoot 68,'' he said, ''to make six birdies. I've got
things back on track, and this first week I'm not expecting too much.''
Two other Europeans finished ahead of Montgomerie. Sweden's Jesper
Parnevik shot a 66 and moved into sixth place after the morning, at
seven under par just three strokes behind Love.
Nick Faldo had the same sort of indifferent round that he has
specialised in in the US this year, shooting a four-birdie, three-bogey
71 that brought him up to six under for the tournament, four strokes
behind Love.
Two of the three other Europeans, Seve Ballesteros and David Feherty,
missed the cut. Ballesteros' even-par 72 did nothing to bring the
four-over-par score he started the day with back to one under par, the
cut figure, the same story for Feherty, who followed up his 75 with a 72
yesterday. Bernhard Langer shot 71 and made the cut, joining Montgomerie
at four under 140. Leading scores:
134 -- D Love III 65, 69.
135 -- R Cochran 71, 64.
136 -- J Sluman 69, 67; N Ozaki (Japan) 68, 68; J Leonard 68, 68; B
Glasson 68, 68; G Norman (Aus) 68, 68.
137 -- J Parnevik (Sweden) 71, 66; P Jacobsen 68, 69; J Carter 72, 65;
T Tyner 69, 68; F Allem (S Africa) 66, 71; S Lowery 65, 72; W Austin 66,
71.
138 -- N Faldo (England) 67, 71; S Stricker 70, 68; A Magee 70, 68; J
Haas 69, 69; H Taylor 71, 67; D Hart 71, 67.
Other scores included:
140 -- C Montgomerie (Scotland) 72, 68; B Langer (Germany) 69, 71.
147 -- D Feherty (N Ireland) 75, 72.
148 -- S Ballesteros (Spain) 76, 72.
* GORDON Sherry stayed on course in the Argentinian Amateur
championship yesterday, winning his first-round matchplay tie by 3 and 2
against a local opponent in Buenos Aires.
Ireland's Padraig Harrington, too, was not troubled in stifling heat,
though he was pushed before defeating Diego Fernandez 2 and 1.
* STIRLING'S Alison Rose just failed to make the quarter-finals of the
Spanish Women's Amateur championship with a final hole defeat at Las
Brisas yesterday.
The Curtis Cup reserve beat Cordonge Basagoiti (Spain) by 8 and 6 in
the first round, but then lost by one hole in the afternoon to another
local player, leading qualifier Anna Sanchez.
The other Scottish qualifiers both went out in the first round.
Lindsey Roxburgh (Tain) lost 3 and 2 to Karoline Andersson (Sweden),
while Longniddry teenager Hilary Monaghan went out 2 and 1 to Amelie
Tournant, from France.

THE dramatic collapse of Barings is a graphic illustration of just how
vulnerable our financial institutions have become in the age of the
global market.
In the UK we have a well developed system of investor protection, but
if your bank, building society or insurance company goes bust, don't
expect to get all your money back. Investor protection schemes are there
to protect small investors and savers. Anyone putting in a large sum --
for example from a legacy or the sale of a house -- should know there is
normally an upper limit on the amount of protection available.
This depends on where your money is invested. The higher the amount
you can deposit, the better the interest rate. However, in light of the
Barings collapse you may decide to sacrifice a few points on the
interest rate for the peace of mind of knowing that your money is within
the limits laid down by the protection scheme.
Banks
The Bank of England is responsible for the regulation of UK banks and
no organisation can use the title bank unless it has a licence from it
to do so. UK depositors are protected by the Deposit Protection Scheme,
but this covers only 75% of the first #20,000 of any deposit.
Off-shore deposits are not covered at all. There is no investor
protection scheme in the Channel Islands. The Isle of Man has its own
scheme which offers the same protection as on the mainland.
The Bank of England publishes a free leaflet: Money In The Bank, which
is available from the Information Department, Bank of England,
Threadneedle Street, London EC2R 8AH.
Building societies
The building societies' Investors' Protection Scheme was introduced
under the Building Societies Act 1986. It covers up to 90% of the first
#20,000 of deposits. It is the total invested with any one society which
counts. If you have more than one account with the same society, the
protection doesn't apply to each. The scheme has never had to be used.
Insurance
Policyholders are protected by the Policyholders' Protection Act 1975.
This covers all types of insurance from car and household to savings,
investment and life insurance. If your insurance company collapses while
you have a claim outstanding, the act requires the rest of the industry
to come to the rescue.
You get 90% of any outstanding claim, or 100% if it is a third-party
claim. There is no upper limit on the amount. A claim could be anything
from a death benefit on a life insurance policy to crash damage on a
car. However, premiums paid in advance on car and household insurance
are lost.
Savings plans such as endowment insurance are usually taken on by
another company on the same terms, but if this proves impossible to
arrange you get the value of the policy as determined by an actuary.
Investments
The Investors' Compensation Scheme was set up as a result of the
Financial Services Act 1986 which regulates the marketing of investments
through stockbrokers, financial advisers and investment managers, as
well as unit trust, investment trust and life insurance companies. The
busiest protection scheme, it has paid out more than #74m to 7400
investors in 165 firms since it came into existence in 1988.
Protection is restricted to the first #50,000 of your investment. You
get 100% of the first #30,000 and 90% of the next #20,000, which makes a
maximum payout of #48,000.
Almost all the firms which have failed have been independent financial
advisers, so if you are putting your trust in one, watch how much you
invest. There can also be long delays. The Investors' Compensation
Scheme only starts processing claims once it has declared a firm in
default, which may be many months after the money is lost.
Company pensions
There is currently no protection for members of company pension
schemes.
However, the Pension Bill which is now going through Parliament
proposes a compensation scheme for pension fund members who lose out
through fraud or misappropriation. As proposed the scheme will pay
compensation of 90%, so someone who loses a pension of #10,000 a year
will have it replaced by one of #9000.
The Bill also strengthens the role of pension fund trustees,
increasing the proportion of member and independent trustees in order to
dilute the influence of company sponsored trustees.

DON'T mention the D-word -- derivatives, that is. This week they
played a major role in the downfall of Barings, the UK's oldest merchant
bank. But is it right to blame them for this latest banking crash? Most
experts seem to agree it wasn't derivatives themselves that caused the
problem, but the way dealing in them was carried out by one of Barings'
Singapore-based traders.
Derivatives need not be dangerous. Indeed, they are commonly used to
underpin the guarantees offered on the stock market bonds so popular
with very cautious investors.
Typically, these guaranteed equity bonds are issued by insurance
companies. They give investors a chance to share in the growth of stock
markets both here and overseas, safe in the knowledge that they will get
their original investment back, whatever happens to share prices in the
future.
With guaranteed stock market bonds, the insurance company buys a
combination of suitable assets and tailored over-the-counter options
from a large bank -- NatWest and Midland both have specialist
departments concentrating on this type of investment.
Derivatives are used by financial institutions to insure a portfolio
against the risk of sharp falls in market prices and by international
companies to protect their trade from fluctuations in currency rates.
They can also be used in financing fixed-rate mortgages.
So what are derivatives and why can dealings have such catastrophic
effects for financial markets? They are so named because their price is
derived from movements in that of an underlying asset. They may look
like part of the technological wizardy of today's computerised financial
scene but in fact trace their history back hundreds of years.
The two main types of derivative are futures and options.
A future commits you to buy (or sell) a certain quantity of a
particular asset at a fixed point in the future. The asset could be a
commodity -- such as sugar or coffee. Futures originated in the US grain
market, where they were devised to provide farmers with cash immediately
for crops they would deliver some time in the future.
The asset can also be an interest rate or currency, or a basket of
securities, such as those represented by the FTSE-100 index.
The trade in futures is now enormous and notoriously difficult for
individual stock markets to control. And if things go wrong, the highly
geared nature of this type of trading can lead to huge losses. It was
betting against prices on Japan's main stock index through equity
markets in Osaka and Singapore that led to Barings' downfall.
Options, the other main derivative, give the holder the right to buy
or sell an underlying asset at a fixed price before a certain date in
the future, but there is no obligation to take this up. They are
available on leading shares and also on the Footsie.
Individual investors may think financial shenanigans like these are a
world away from their nest egg, but in some cases the dreaded D-word
could play a bigger role in your investments than you might think.
Having your cake and eating it too has always been popular with
investors, and the new range of guaranteed equity bonds now coming back
to the market owe their attractive returns to derivatives. That said,
the emphasis is firmly on cautious and guaranteed growth, rather than
portfolio pyrotechnics, with a major insurance company standing guard
over your investments.
Stock market bonds were very popular with investors last year,
accounting for over #1300m of sales for insurance companies hit hard by
a turndown in business on traditional life policies and pension plans.
Many bonds were withdrawn following Budget changes last November. Then
the Chancellor closed a tax loophole which had helped to produce the
very appealing returns on offer.
After time to rethink their plans insurance companies are back again,
offering a new range of stock market bonds. Royal Scottish, the
insurance and investment arm of the Royal Bank, is expected to launch
its new guaranteed equity bond later this month.
''Derivatives are a real breakthrough for this type of product,'' says
Ian Bullock of General Accident Life, which has just announced its new
Guaranteed Growth Bond. ''You only need to spend a small amount to tap
into the upside of share prices, and as long as you underpin the falls
there should be no problem. We use a combination of swaps and
derivatives that are specially tailored for us.''
The new bond promises to turn a minimum investment of #2500 into #3360
over five-and-a-half years -- an effective yearly return of 6.3% or 40%
over the term.
There is no more tax to pay for basic rate payers, but non-taxpayers
cannot claim any tax back and those on the higher rate will have more to
pay.
There is potential to earn an extra bonus on top if the Footsie rises
over the time, worked out on 20% of your original investment. If it
rises by 50% over the term, based on #500 (20% of the minimum investment
of #2500) you should receive a bonus of #750 on top of the guaranteed
growth worth #3360, making #4110 in total.

HERBACEOUS borders can be fun. That was the clear message that came
over from Ian Dougall, lecturing to Milngavie Horticultural Society the
other evening.
He retired recently from the Scottish Agricultural College, and has
set up in business with lectures and courses in gardening.
He told his audience: ''I love talking about herbaceous plants, far
more than about annuals. Herbaceous plants are there for a while and you
get used to them.
''I am not terribly keen on mixing herbaceous plants and shrubs or
other items.''
He emphasised that, whether you grow in one-sided borders,
double-sided borders, or island beds, the important thing is to have
soil preparation carried out properly.
''You must deal with bad weeds, such as couch grass, or they will make
your borders a nightmare,'' he advised.
''I recently visited a garden where this grass had been allowed to run
riot.
''What a mess. It involved lifting the whole border and cleaning out
the weeds manually, bit by bit.
''Treat the land with the right chemicals before other cultivation,
and add in well-rotted organic matter,'' he added.
He also stresses it is important to do your homework. Look up books,
or lists of plants in catalogues, and work out where to put what. Use a
bit of paper to create a working plan.
''Buying plants is easy these days. Most garden centres sell
container-grown plants, and if you buy a large specimen you can
generally break it into several bits.
''This is the way to group herbaceous plants when putting them in.''
''Slugs can be a menace, of course, not only for new beds but
continually. You must have regular control methods.''
The maintenance of these plants in clean, weed-free borders is simple,
he pointed out, isn't difficult. It involves supporting them, doing some
hoeing, and little more. Pests and diseases don't give too much cause
for concern.
He also advised getting out and about to steal ideas from gardens open
to the public, under the National Trust or Scotland's Gardens Scheme.
Benefit from all the experience other people have.

SCOTLAND'S Gary Jacobs was caught up in a boxing drama in America last
night when his manager, Mickey Duff, hinted that his world title
ambitions could be put on hold because of a unification ploy between the
handlers of WBC champion Pernell Whitaker and WBA holder Ike Quartey.
All three are appearing in Atlantic City tonight -- Whitaker stepping
up a weight to challenge Julio Cesar Vasquaz and Quartey defending his
title. Jacobs features on the undercard against New Jersey's Jose Miguel
Feranandez in what is supposed to be his final warm-up before meeting
Whitaker for the world crown.
Said Duff: ''I have a bad feeling about all of this. There are moves
afoot to get Whitaker and Quartey together, but I am questioning the
Duva family, who handle Whitaker, about that. We had virtually agreed
that Whitaker would fight Gary in the summer and I'm not prepared to let
them roll all over us.''
But as Duff spoke the man himself appeared. Whitaker, surrounded by an
entourage which would have done justice to a member of the royal family,
broke away and shook hands with the 29-year-old Jacobs. ''This guy is
next,'' he told us. ''And I hope he's a smash-hit tomorrow night.''
Later Whitaker, who really fancies his chances agains the world light-
middleweight champion tonight, said: ''I don't know too much about Gary
Jacobs, but I gather Scotland has a real good fighter here and you
should all be proud of him.
''He deserves to be next on my list -- he is the mandatory challenger
and I can't deprive him of that. After I beat Vasquez I'll come back
down to welter to meet your man.
''It doesn't make any difference to me where we fight. I would even
come to Scotland if the money was right.''
Duff, however was still not convinced. He said: ''I hope for the best,
but I'm prepared for the worst. Mind you, he seems a nice and genuine
guy, but his talk of coming to Scotland is pie in the sky.
''I am presently trying to work out a deal for the fight to go on in
Sun City in South Africa. With the Rugby World Cup going on there in
June Sun City would need a big event to attract people and Gary against
Whitaker could be it.''
Before that, however, the Scot has to look good against Fernandez
tonight and I can't see him falling down in that task. Jacobs is in
superb mental and physical condition and should finish the job inside
the distance.
* SHEFFIELD showman Prince Naseem Hamed will continue his bid for a
world title shot tonight when he steps into the ring in Livingston in
defence of his WBC International super-bantamweight title against
Argentinian hardman Sergio Rafael Liendo.
Hamed has the tools to demonstrate that boxing is often a sweet,
scientific and, indeed, noble art in this third defence of the title, in
which victory should secure a WBA title clash with champion Wilfredo
Vasquez in June.
''There's no question about my ambitions. I want to be the greatest
boxer of all time,'' said Hamed. ''I want to go down as a legend.
''I see myself being a triple or even four-time world champion, still
boxing and unbeaten in more than 50 fights.''
Liendo, 25, has already reached the half-century mark. He has 42 wins,
four draws and four defeats -- and, crucially, has never been stopped.
But neither had October opponent Freddy Cruz, nor November victim
Laureano Ramiriez -- and the vastly-experienced January import Armando
Castro had not been halted for six years, but that trio went in six,
three and four rounds respectively.

PETER Nicol, the world No.5, kept Scottish hopes alive with an easy,
first-round win in last night's British Masters Telesquash Championships
in Dyce.
Having seen Oban's Martin Heath fail in four games against England's
Peter Marshall, Nicol enjoyed the only straight-games win in the final
tie against Steve Richardson.
The Irishman was outclassed by the Scottish champion, the match
lasting less than 30 minutes.
Nicol's reward is a semi-final against England's world No.6 Chris
Walker. He survived the toughest of the first-round matches, coming back
from having been 2-1 down in games to beat Adrian Davies.
Heath could be pleased at taking a game from Marshall, and he raised
hopes of an upset when he levelled the match at 1-1. But the man from
Nottingham stepped up a gear to eventually win well.
Marshall now meets Del Harris, who won the battle of England's former
world junior champions. The former British title holder, who has
recently climbed back into the world's top 10, hit back from dropping
the opening game to beat Simon Parke.
The Scottish women's telesquash championship gets under way today with
Alison Bowie defending the title, and northeast trio Claire Waddell,
Wendy Maitland, and Nicol's older sister, Julie, completing the line up.
North of Scotland Telesquash Championships: Semi-finals -- K Milne
(Ellon) beat J Spiers (Osborne) 15-12, 15-8; R Irvine (Aberdeen) beat R
Booth (Exel) 12-15, 17-15, 15-13.
British Masters Telesquash Championship: Quarter-finals -- P Marshall
(England) beat M Heath (Scotland) 15-8, 12-15, 15-12, 15-5; D Harris
(England) beat S Parke (England) 10-15, 15-7, 15-13, 15-8; C Walker
(England) beat A Davies (Wales) 15-9, 9-15, 10-15, 15-11, 15-13; P Nicol
(Scotland) beat S Richardson (Ireland) 15-10, 15-9, 15-10.

KEITH Anderson, the Scottish cross-country champion and a former chef
at London gentlemen's club Boodles, may not have served his last
surprise on British endurance running, writes Doug Gillon.
The 37-year-old Anderson has been discounted by the specialist media
-- usually an essential ingredient of the recipe for success -- and so
must be fancied to grab a berth in Britain's team for the world
cross-country championships when the trial takes place at Druridge Bay
Country Park, Northumberland, tomorrow.
The man whom Scotland ignored, and allowed to pull on an England vest
by default -- they did not select him despite his declaration of
availability -- has already had one laugh at Scotland's expense, winning
the national title at Perth.
Anderson's father is Scots, and Keith went to school in the shadow of
Barlinnie prison, but he escaped the selectors' notice, even after
winning several major hill races.
However, he would really rub in the embarrassment if he gained a world
place ahead of the seven Scottish contenders who line up this weekend --
Chris Robison, Tommy Murray, Dave Cavers, Adrian Callan, Robert Quinn,
Colin Donnelly, and Graeme Wight.
Former British fell-running champion Anderson is unique, not only in
reaching his peak at such an advanced age, but also in doing all his
quality training on a treadmill.
Having given up the kitchen to become a mature student, Anderson is
coached by Dr Tony Trowbridge, clinical scientist and reader in medical
physics at Sheffield University.
He bases his methods on those of the East Germans, and so effective
are they that when Anderson ran the only track race of his life, the
5000 metres at last year's Yorkshire championships, he won, and
collected the Sebastian Coe award for the most meritorious performance
of the meeting.
In addition, he ran second to Commonwealth marathon medallist Mark
Hudspith in the AAA half marathon, and was fourth in the English
national cross-country -- a range of ability unmatched by any other
British runner.
For all that, Robison and Murray, whom Anderson beat at Perth, believe
they can snatch British places themselves. The first seven to finish are
guaranteed, with the two final places at the selectors' discretion.
But the most consistent Scot is Vikki McPherson, the Commonwealth team
captain, who has defied English bias by qualifying in each of the past
three years. The City of Glasgow woman has every chance of doing so
again, despite accountancy studies.
* BRIAN Whittle, twice European indoor 400m silver medallist,
yesterday withdrew from the UK team for the World Indoor Championships,
which begin in Barcelona next Friday.

GORDON Muirhead, of Livingston, joined Hammy McMillan's Stranraer team
at the top of the rankings last night in the Macallan Scottish
championships in Perth.
Muirhead, who until this season was a member of the McMillan rink,
beat his former team-mates by 5-2 to end McMillan's undefeated run so
far in these championships.
This result guarantees both teams a slot in tomorrow's semi-finals.
In earlier matches McMillan's team defeated Keith Prentice, of
Lockerbie, who was beaten 6-1 in the morning, and John Jo Kenny, of
Kinross, who went down by 5-2 in the afternoon session.
Perth's Warwick Smith and Struan MacNee, of Murrayfield, lie just
behind Muirhead and McMillan in the rankings with five wins each, and
these four teams look to be the favourites to complete the semi-final
line-up.
Next in the league table lie Drew Tasker, of Letham Grange, and
Greenacres' Philip Wilson.
These two teams, who have three wins, face each other this morning and
only the winner of this match will have even a theoretical chance of
qualifying for the semis.
None of the other teams in the competition are in a position to
qualify, but with two round-robin games left to play today, each can
influence the eventual make-up of the semi-finals. Results:
Fifth round -- Gray (Forest Hills) 7, Wilson (Greenacres) 2; MacNee
(Murrayfield) 6, Adam (East Kilbride) 5; Smith (Perth) 7, Kenny
(Kinross) 1; Muirhead (Livingston) 11, Tasker (Letham Grange) 5;
Prentice (Lockerbie) 1, McMillan (Stranraer) 6.
Sixth round -- Prentice 6, Tasker 8; McMillan 5, Kenny 2; Adam 4,
Muirhead 8: MacNee 8, Gray 5; Smith 4, Wilson 7.
Seventh round -- Muirhead 5, McMillan 2; Prentice 5, Smith 8; Tasker
9, MacNee 5; Wilson 6, Adam 9; Kenny 6, Gray 4.
Standings after seven rounds:
Muirhead won 6, lost 1; McMillan 6-1, Smith 5-2, MacNee 5-2, Tasker
3-4, Wilson 3-4, Prentice 2-5, Adam 2-5, Gray 2-5, Kenny 1-6.

SNOW lay in four-foot drifts by the side of the road, and the melt
water, running on to the tarmac, had frozen in ridges a foot thick. It
was 5pm on the last Friday of February in John o' Groats. Hardly ideal
conditions to race. But a dozen rockets, soaring into the evening sky,
sent the competitors on their way, and race they did -- 715 of them,
heading for Land's End, chasing #5100 in prizes.
Although there were 851 miles to go, some set off at a sprint,
discarding rucksacks in the stampede.
The scene, said contemporary observer Peter Lovesey, was ''the
greatest gathering of eccentrics since Peter The Hermit's Crusade.''
Holiday camp entrepreneur Billy Butlin was the man responsible for
launching this exercise in masochistic lunacy, putting up the cash, and
35 years ago this week the event's progress was on every TV news
bulletin.
By the time the leaders in the euphemistically titled ''Billy Butlin
Walk'' had crossed the Border, more than 300 starters had retired. A
further 100 had been disqualified for cheating -- accepting lifts, some
of which were offered by race officials, acting as agents provocateur.
For months afterwards, hospitals the length of Britain were littered
with the casualties. Butlin paid fares homeward for many destitute
competitors. Questions were asked in Parliament about the cost to the
National Health Service. Plans for a repeat were shelved.
Yet this week, we can reveal that it is hoped to stage a reprise. The
Road Runners' Club, Britain's largest athletics club with more than 3000
members, is contemplating a revival to celebrate the Millenium.
John Legge, RRC chairman, confirms they hope to organise a 2000
kilometre race, with charitable objectives: ''almost half as far
again,'' agreed Legge. ''But we'd still like to make it John o' Groats
to Lands' End. We could make a number of detours, to major cities,
possibly even via London, to make up the distance.''
The silicon chip, attached to shoelaces, was not available to catch
the cheats when the field set off in 1960. In the van from the start was
Yorkshireman John Grundy. He covered 38 miles the first evening, before
retiring for the night at 10pm to a pre-arranged bed-and-breakfast. But
three days later, having covered 235 miles, he broke down with shin
splints.
He could still recall the agonies when I tracked him down this week at
his Wakefield home: ''If it wasn't shin splints, it was blisters. I'd to
cut bits out of my shoes to relieve the pressure.''
Grundy, a member of Wakefield Harriers, had finished high up in the
London-Brighton race, had won the Liverpool-Blackpool 48-miler, and the
Isle of Man 60-mile race. Nursing his shin splints, he walked to the
Border, 30 miles a day, still believing he could win -- and he very
nearly did.
The finish could scarcely have been more dramatically scripted.
Once over the Border, Grundy was able to run again, and regained the
lead at Kidderminster. He collected #10 point-to-point bonuses which put
petrol in the tank of his support vehicle (they regularly brewed tea for
him) and paid the meals. Otherwise, Grundy would have run out of cash.
But in the closing stages emerged James Musgrave. While Grundy was
sleeping at Crediton, Musgrave snatched just an hour's rest, then made
his bid.
Forty miles from the finish he broke down, and though a non-smoker,
sat on the pavement, puffing full-strength Capstan. Only when he heard
Grundy had also stopped was he persuaded to carry on. He won in 15 days,
14 hours, 31 minutes, and collected #1000.
Grundy arrived 83 minutes later, and like all the cognoscenti, was
stunned to hear of Musgrave's finishing surge -- he had covered the
final 103 miles non-stop (fag-break apart) in 14 hours 31 minutes. Even
today that would be outstanding for a 100-mile race.
Musgrave, who had never featured in any athletics event, was never
heard of again. But Grundy continued to run, even though he was
suspended by the sport's rulers.
''I knew I wasn't going to make it to the Olympics in the marathon --
I wasn't good enough,'' said Grundy. ''But I'd no regrets. The second
prize of #500 was a lot of money. When I got married four years later,
in 1964, I bought a bungalow for #2100.''
Sixteen years later, after the reinstatement of some fell runners, and
in particular of Olympic sprinter Dorothy Hyman, who had sold her story
to a Sunday paper, Grundy was finally granted reinstatment.
''I'd still be running today,'' added Grundy, ''but 15 years ago I had
plastic surgery on my throat. It affects my breathing. I can't run up a
flight of stairs without getting breathless. But I still walk about
eight miles every day -- I'm a car park attendant.''
And the record for the distance is now held by a Scot -- Donald
Ritchie, from Forres, who made the journey in 10 days, 15 hours, 25
minutes.

INVESTORS who have applied for National Power and PowerGen shares can
look forward to a premium on their new shares when dealings begin on
Monday as a result of heavy applications in the public offer.
Early indications of the number of shares applied for have proved to
be too modest, with the Government's advisers in the sale saying the
original public offer of 149 million National Power and 95 million
PowerGen was oversubscribed twice. This has triggered the maximum
clawback from the institutional offer, so that in total 60% of the offer
will be reserved for small shareholders.
Even this proportion was over-subscribed 1[1/2] times, meaning that
larger applicants will not get all the shares they wanted. Those going
for a few hundred shares are likely to be satisfied in full but larger
applications will be scaled back. The basis of allocation will be
announced during the weekend. The minimum purchase was a package of 120
National Power and 80 PowerGen, requiring a first instalment of #352.
About one million people applied for shares, just under a third of the
3,200,000 who had expressed interest by registering with a share shop.
Only those who applied through a share shop will be eligible for the
incentives of bonus shares or a discount on the final instalment, due in
September 1996. The average application was for 298 National Power and
190 PowerGen shares, representing an initial payment of #906.
Institutions will only be left with about a fifth of the issue as each
of the generators intend to buy back around 20% of the shares sold. The
sale was the subject of an international promotional campaign directed
at professional investors and many are likely to be frustrated at the
low proportion of the shares allocated to them.
This will help to create a lively market when dealings begin on
Monday. The actual price per share will only be revealed shortly before
and as a result of the strong demand it is likely to be near the current
price of the existing shares, at 456[1/2]p for National Power and 492p
for PowerGen.
The success of the issue at a time of uncertain share markets will be
a shot in the arm for Government in its hope of selling off Railtrack,
which is about the final remaining privatisation still to be undertaken.

STRATH Royal can continue an excellent season by landing today's
feature chase at Doncaster. He started the season with a bang when he
scored at Warwick in a cracking time that took almost a minute off the
average for the race and, since then, has never been out of the top two.
Owen Brennan's consistent performer was not disgraced when going down
to an in-form Bibendum last time out and can go one better over this
longer trip. On a line through Mweenish he should have the beating of
Meleagris who is older than the winners in any of the six years of this
event.
Bibendum holds an entry for the Mitsubishi Shogun chase but is being
asked to give away sacks of weight to some decent performers. It may be
worth opposing him with Rodeo Star who has won over course and distance.
Rodeo Star came off the worse when he clashed with Bibendum at the
back end of last season, but he should be able to exchange placings
today.
Boarding School has put in some fair runs at Edinburgh, but his
jumping is too sketchy to be back with confidence in today's hotter
company.
It would be an unusual Doncaster meeting without a winner from Mary
Reveley's stable and Cab On Target, in the Light Infantry Plate, is her
best prospect.
He had some of the top stayers in the hurdling business behind him
when falling two from home last time out and should be able to defy top
weight against these more moderate rivals.
Newbury looks unlikely to run unless the sun rises early. If racing
goes ahead, Hopes And Pops looks the best bet for the Berkshire Hurdle
where the bottom half of the weights are running outside their proper
handicap mark.
This tough mare will relish the testing ground and showed she was on
top form at Kempton when slamming Who Is Equiname, who was a previous
course and distance winner.
* KELSO'S highlight of the season, the #15,000 Hennessy Cognac Special
-- which should have been run yesterday -- has been transferred to their
meeting on Friday, March 24.
The BHB ratified the switch after the race, a novices' hurdle event,
looked likely to be lost with the abandonment of the fixture.
The two-mile, two-furlong feature will now re-opened and take its
place as the third race of a seven-race card on the March 24 card at
3.15.

THE pound has perked up all round the wicket as the dollar took
another battering despite concerted central bank intervention in Europe
and North America.
The markets seem to be winning this tussle. The dollar continued to
post fresh post-war lows against the yen after each wave of central bank
buying. Even the Federal Reserve was unable to stem the tide when it
joined the fray in the afternoon.
Sterling gain more than three cents to $1.6232, a level not seen since
November, and nearly a pfennig to DM2.3281.
Usually a weak dollar drags the pound down with it, a problem sterling
faced throughout February when the Government's political problems over
Europe and Northern Ireland also undermined it.
Yesterday the pound was making headway against both the dollar and the
mark, suggesting independent strength. The best explanation is that the
political situation and the collapse of Barings, which hit sterling hard
on Monday, have ceased to be significant negative influences for the
time being.
The trade-weighted index jumped from 87.1 to 87.9 taking the pound's
international spending power back to its level at the end of the first
week in February.
About 15 European central banks, including the Bank of England, the
Bundesbank, and the central banks of France, Italy, the Netherlands,
Sweden, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Norway, Denmark, and Greece,
weighed in on the dollar's behalf before lunch in the wake of overnight
intervention by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan.
The Europeans, including the Bank of England, were keen to arrest the
inexorable rise of the German mark, but nobody wanted to end up holding
bucketfuls of dollars. The intervention was generally perceived to have
been on too small a scale to have had any lasting effect.
The West German Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, chose the wrong day to
advertise the safe-haven attractions of his country's currency.
The scale of transactions on foreign exchange markets is so large that
it is beyond the power of central banks to support troubled currencies.
The classic example of this was two and a half years ago when
speculators wiped out the Bank of England's reserves in a single day and
forced sterling out of Europe's exchange rate mechanism.
The dollar is in serious trouble against the yen, aggravated by
Japanese companies repatriating currency to meet the escalating costs of
the Kobe earthquake. The basic problem is the fundamental imbalance in
trade between the US and Japan.
In the last couple of months US interest-rate expectations have
plunged as signs of a slowdown in the American economy have gathered. So
there is no obvious support for the dollar, which in any event is in the
ascendancy against the Mexican peso, and, more surprisingly, the
Canadian dollar.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of
the Bank of England, Eddie George, meet on Wednesday for the first time
since they decided to increase interest rates by half a point to 6.75%
in the first week of February.
The pundits are betting that the two men will wait until the second
quarter before considering a further increase in interest rates. Recent
indicators have pointed to a slowdown in retail sales, an upturn in
inflation, especially at the factory gate level, and continued strength
in manufacturing output.
UK interest rates were raised last September, and subsequent increases
have come at two-monthly intervals. On this occasion the Chancellor and
the Governor are likely to want to see further hard information on the
economy before deciding the timing of any fresh moves on rates.
The pace of economic activity is difficult to guage. Higher rates and
taxes are slowing down the domestic economy, but exports are booming and
much of the manufacturing sector with them.
Retail sales fell by 0.9% in January, and it was no great surprise
when the latest consumer credit figures showed a sharp slowdown in the
growth rate between December and January.
Net consumer credit rose by a seasonally adjusted #492m after
increases of #862m in December and #694m in November, according to
figures yesterday from the Bank of England.
But the annual rate of growth in consumer credit increased to 11.4%
from 11% in December and 9.9% in November.
Credit card lending slowed down from #302m in December to #115m in
January in line with reduced spending on clothing and footwear. Other
specialist lending, mainly for cars and major household items, was also
weak.
But the trend suggests that hard-pressed consumers are still prepared
to step up their borrowings to maintain their spending. If so, a
bounceback in retail sales must be on the cards.

YOU are the owner-manager of a growing business in Scotland (I refuse
to use the derogatory term small to describe any company with ambition).
You need to recruit one or two stars, key people to drive the business
forward.
You have carefully compiled job descriptions that call for a strong
mix of experience, skills and energy. Such animals do exist and you are
acutely aware that importing their brand of expertise could be the
single most important move you could make to accelerate growth and
profits.
But, you are also aware that this particular combination of talents is
mostly confined to the senior managers of large companies with the
resources to develop properly and to train their people. How can you, a
corporate nobody in those terms, attract and, more to the point, keep
such people?
Obviously you are not going to throw money at the solution by
competing head on with the salary packages offered by the big boys.
Equally obviously you won't be able to surround these stars with the
sort of corporate administrative structure to which they tend to be
used.
Don't worry! Help is at hand in the form of two powerful forces
currently sweeping through UK plc. The first is the all-pervading trend
for downsizing, re-engineering and all the other terms used to describe
a process of getting fewer people to do more for less.
There can scarcely be a sizable company that over the past decade has
not dramatically altered working conditions for its senior and best
people. We have all heard about or experienced at first hand the
personal consequences for those in the front line of this competitive
revolution.
I spent an hour recently with a friend who has gone through a
particularly testing experience courtesy of his employer, a major UK
quoted company. His job changed radically, with responsibility heaped
upon responsibility. His form of working underwent equally radical
change, with clients up and down the country gaining direct access to
him via phone and fax seven days a week at home and office alike.
Unsurprisingly he suffered two breakdowns, both fortunately minor and
temporary. In his mid-thirties, he is taking the next severance package
to come up and has resolved never again to work for such an
organisation.
Funnily enough, he would love to work for a growing business where his
hard-won skills would be properly appreciated, where people were treated
decently and where he could once again grow in a positive atmosphere of
teamwork. He knows he would earn substantially less. And he is not
looking for a holiday camp: he is prepared to put in the hours but on a
realistic basis involving more flexibility and homeworking.
Thus, for our owner-manager, opportunity is knocking in the form of a
growing army of such people who are no longer prepared to tolerate
unremitting pressure and uncertainty.
I know this is true because I sense a rising unease among the more
thoughtful of our large company managers at the growing disaffection of
their brightest people.
The second powerful force at work encouraging good people to depart
from large companies is the increasingly unacceptable standard of living
in the overcrowded South-east of England including, of course, London.
Thousands of talented individuals have quietly decided to escape the
crush to either Scotland, Wales or Cornwall.
Again, they fully appreciate that their earnings and their positions
are likely to be lower, but they have come to the fundamental conclusion
that their quality of life, yes, and their longevity, far outweigh such
considerations.
So, how to find your star in this particular firmament? First, look
around you at all the people you know and respect who happen to work for
large companies. Might any of them fit your bill?
Second, don't be afraid to advertise whether in the Scottish or the
London press. Spending a couple of thousand pounds on well-crafted,
prominent adverts that give a good impression of your business may just
be the best investment that you can make at this stage of its
development.
Today every business is a people business. It so happens that some
large companies are doing their very best to demotivate their most
talented people -- and some growing businesses are directly in line to
benefit, thank you very much.

I REFER to the press conference to launch Strathclyde Business
Development's international trade development programme for 1995/96.
There is some confusion in the report by Iain Wilson between the
corporate position of SBD as a multi-functional economic development
agency (the business development arm of the regional council) and its
specific trade development activities (February 22).
These general activities are currently the subject of detailed
negotiations between the regional council and its constituent district
councils with a view to their being recognised by Strathclyde's
successor unitary authorities as having substantial value and being
taken over (in most instances directly) by them.
In the unique case of our trade development programme, its strategic
focus requires that we seek to indentify a means of funding the activity
on some kind of joint basis. In this we are anxious to secure
recognition within the new exports strategy for Scotland currently being
developed by Scottish Trade International of the continuing value of a
significant local authority investment in the internationalisation of
Scottish businesses and the crucial need to maintain the momentum that
has been achieved.
Strathclyde's programme, as your reporter accurately states, currently
represents more than half the foreign trade missions organised on behalf
of Scottish companies.

FEISTY is an adjective which is often used for Jewish American ladies
like Barbra Streisand, but it can just as easily be applied to the Brown
twins, Helen and Marion. It is hard to believe they were 50 last
weekend, since both have remained petite and exude the kind of sparkling
energy which seems to escape many who pass the half-century. They are
identical twins but seem (to me at least) to keep a distinct identity,
although it must be said that, like many identical twins, they have
followed curiously parallel paths in life.
Both married into the theatre. Helen to actor Michael MacKenzie, whose
portrayal of Mozart's rival Salieri is about to tread the boards again;
Marion to Adrian Reynolds, one-time director at the Byre Theatre in St
Andrews and now at Basingstoke.
The monozygotics from Monifieth were schooled in Perthshire while Ma
and Pa Broon were based in Hong Kong. I first met Helen when we worked
together in the early seventies before she ended up as PR with the
Lyceum, where she met Michael. Neither Brown girl believed in doing
motherhood the easy way. James, Michael and Helen's son, was born
prematurely weighing 2lbs.
It wasn't my first baptism but I will never forget it -- entering the
incubator room at Perth Royal Infirmary wearing surgical gear and
baptising with the little silver spoon which they supplied for the
purpose. James's head was smaller than a tangerine and his life hung by
a thin line of technology. I felt deeply inadequate to the occasion with
my little book of words and my well-meant prayers. I still feel
inadequate in trying to explain what goes on at moments like these.
It does not seem to depend on the good intentions or the spiritual
quality of the baptiser. Nor is the magic in the words or the ordained
status of the person performing the ceremony ex opere operato. But there
is something which touches, heals, not only the baby but all who are
around when it happens.
Why else do so many parents seek baptism for their children? It is not
habit (certainly not these days) nor status. Is it superstition? I think
that we dishonour those who offer their infants for baptism, and who do
not frequent churches, if we impute superstitious motives to them. I
don't subscribe to the theology that sees baptism as saving babies from
some putative purgatorial process. It is much deeper and more mysterious
than that -- and don't ask me to explain it fully.
James lived. Born with a silver spoon on his forehead, he is now a
strapping teenager with a silver earring in his ear, and a cheerful and
intelligent lad. He was there last Sunday at the Brown sisters' 50th
birthday party, enjoying the company of his cousin Kanchana. She is
Marion's contribution to less straightforward methods of motherhood.
Adrian and Marion journeyed across the globe to Sri Lanka in search of
her and brought her home, aged less than a week.
Her baptism was a less dramatic affair (at least by Brown standards).
It took place in Ceres Kirk in Fife, with Jimmy Logan playing a double
role as godfather of the baby and as video cameraman. But I don't need
Jimmy's video to bring back the memory of that occasion. It was a sunny
summer day and there was a warm and optimistic feeling. Kanchana was not
being untimely wrenched from Sri Lanka but being blessed into a family
where she would be loved and cherished. I felt linked into something
that made our world a little smaller, and the human family a little
closer.
But baptism is initiation into another world -- the world of the
spirit. Deny it if you will, but it goes deeper than a splash of water
and a few words. Those who experience baptism in later life are well
aware of the penetrative nature of what is done.
It is like all rites of passage, when you have assembled for the
ceremony and the words begin, it is as if a curtain is drawn back from
within the soul. From behind it stream ghostly shades -- memories,
people, experiences that come walking through. Hopes, fears, and deep
emotions flood to the surface, triggered by words. Symbolised by water
at a baptism, by wine and bread at Communion or by the earth that drops
upon a coffin lid.
It is as if the sacrament enables us to get in touch with that world
in a way we cannot manage ourselves. Theologians describe the process as
the operation of the Holy Spirit. For those who prefer more mundane
imagery -- how about comparing it with town twinning? Two towns in
different countries adopt one another and through this link discover new
dimensions in a world they took for granted.
Being an identical twin has its disadvantages, like having a shadow
person with you throughout your life. But is that not a parable of the
kingdom of God? It coexists with our world of the senses, and
occasionally intrudes and inspires us to make our world more in tune
with it. Rites of passage are when we sense the deeper and lasting
things of life and become temporary twins. Happy birthday, girls -- and
thanks for the memories.

EXCLUSIVE talks are continuing between Internationale Nederlanden
Groep (ING) and the Ernst &amp; Young administrators of stricken Barings
Bank and a deal still looks on the cards though other banks are hovering
in the wings should they collapse.
Wall Street broking giant Smith Barney is believed to be showing an
interest and ABN AMRO, ING's fellow Dutch rival, is also eyeing the
situation. It has been suggested that they may even act jointly to try
to snatch Barings from ING so that they can then divide up the different
parts of the bank that interest them.
ING, meantime, is making final checks on Barings, including an audit
of staff, before committing itself. If an agreement is not struck
reasonably soon, Ernst &amp; Young could open the door to other interested
parties.
However, the adminstrators are keen for the whole bank to be taken
over rather than see parts picked off which is one reason why ING was
favoured and granted exclusive negotiations.
The Serous Fraud Office and the City of London Police are
investigating whether there is a British dimension to allegations of
fraud which the Singapore have levelled at at former Baring trader Nick
Leeson. This, along with Bank of England enquiries, could be another
factor holding up completion of the purchase.
It has been suggested that one of the main points of discussion could
be the issue of bonuses totalling #105m which had been due to be paid to
Barings executives this week.

IN 1993 Scottish Enterprise launched a new annual bursary competition
in memory of John Condliffe, its managing director in charge of
strategy, who had died suddenly the year before. The John Condliffe
bursary, worth #2500, is open to post-graduates at Scottish
universities. The winner is expected to carry out a study project, in
line with SE's own strategic objectives. The Herald undertook to publish
a report of each year's study.
The first winner, ALFRED BAIRD of Edinburgh's Napier University, has
made a study of the economic viability of coastal freight ferry services
between Scotland and England, similar to those already operating in
Italy. There is constant talk of shifting more freight traffic from road
to rail. Here he explores the more radical option, using the latest
high-speed craft to take freight from road to sea.
WHILE road traffic continues to grow, road capacity fails to maintain
the pace, resulting in increasing levels of congestion. Further new road
projects are becoming subject to even greater levels of public protest.
Firms often revert to night driving to avoid the worst of daytime
congestion.
Other threats to the efficiency of long-distance trucking operations
include the forthcoming introduction of motorway tolls, regulation of
driver hours and speed restrictions, and the recent Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution Report which called for increases in fuel duty
and other measures in an attempt to make road freight transport more
sustainable.
In the search for an alternative to road, the attention of most
commentators has been drawn towards rail transport. Few people have
considered the potential of water. Sea transport benefits from the fact
that it offers a free highway. We do not have to build a road or lay
railway tracks; all that is required, apart from the transport vehicles
themselves, are the nodal points and links to the road network.
This study began by investigating a recently introduced coastal
freight ferry service in Italy. The Viamare service between Genoa and
Sicily began in the summer of 1992.
Key factors Viamare had to consider included that sea terminals must
be linked directly to motorways and avoid nearby urban areas, ships
should be capable of very fast port turnaround, and the service should
be frequent and reliable. Sailings had to be timed to meet the needs of
hauliers, paperwork had to be issued speedily, and the ships needed to
be flexible, capable of accepting a variety of unitised traffic and
wheeled cargo, including trade cars. Approximately 20% of Viamare's
cargo consists of cars, mainly from Fiat.
About 40% of road trailers using the ferries are driver-accompanied.
Each ship has the capacity to carry 50 passengers in 25 double cabins.
An important issue, according to Viamare, was for the shipping line to
understand fully the needs of hauliers. Consequently, its management was
drawn from a combined transport background.
By late 1993, it had secured a 16% share of the by-road market between
northern Italy and Sicily, and this was increasing steadily. The company
estimated it needed 19% of the market to break even at 65% vessel
utilisation.
The competitive advantage of the ferries lay in the fact that the sea
route was only two-thirds the length of the road alternative. This
enabled the ferry to offer the same transit time as road -- 24 hours --
even using relatively slow ships. In addition, Viamare could beat the
road haulage rate by about 25%. Hauliers using the ferry also benefited
from reduced wear and tear on trucks and trailers.
While Viamare management regards the coastal freight ferry service as
a success, it has had to withstand numerous difficulties ranging from
devaluation of the lire, port strikes, high interest rates, intra-group
rivalry for ships (Viamare is part of the state-owned Finmare Group),
and the changing political agenda in Italy.
The company considers two factors to be critical for the success of
coastal services. First, vessel speed must be fast (this is admitted to
be a real weakness in the Viamare service which employs 19-knot ships)
and, second, government regulations in respect of road haulage should be
rigidly enforced to push more trunk traffic on to the ferries.
UK road freight industry
Before considering the opportunities for any significant shift of
goods traffic from road to coastal shipping here in the UK, it was
necessary to establish the competitive situation and market structure of
the road transport industry. Road haulage in the UK is characterised by
low rates and zero negative margins.
In trunk haulage (particularly distances over 300kms), more than 80%
of movements are carried by public haulage firms generally using
38-tonne articulated vehicles. Logistics and distribution specialists
tend to contract out the basic trunk haulage routes, and there is
increasing evidence of infringement of regulations in respect of trunk
movements.
An additional difficulty is the inability of owner-drivers and small
family haulage firms to fund the necessary degree of sophistication in
IT.
Market for coastal freight ferry services
Initial analysis of goods flows between Scotland and regions in
England suggested sufficient traffic movements and, therefore, potential
for coastal services between the West of Scotland and North-west
England, the East and both South-east and Northern England.
Assessment of existing and planned sea terminals (including land
access) resulted in three possible routes being identified:
Greenock-Birkenhead, Rosyth-Harwich and Rosyth-Teesport.
Identifying the market for each route then required the definition of
each ports' hinterland. The hinterland of Greenock and Rosyth was
assumed to be the whole of Scotland. That for Birkenhead was assumed to
include the North-west, Wales and the West Midlands. And for Harwich it
was assumed to include the South-east, Greater London, East Anglia and
the East Midlands. In the case of Teesport, it was assumed to be
Northern England, Yorkshire and Humberside.
Based on this, the total by-road market for all three routes (1993
levels, including empty trailers) was estimated. 0
Service feasibility
Conventional freight ferries offering a service speed of 19 knots were
discounted as impractical for UK coastal routes. They would take twice
as long as road haulage. Only high-speed vessels could realistically be
expected to take market share from the road. Moreover, by sea between
the North and South of the UK there is no distance advantage as in
Italy, and the road network here is rather more sophisticated. Only an
advanced, sophisticated high-speed sea-transport system is likely to
succeed.
High-speed ferry technology has improved markedly since the Sea-Cat
and other catamaran designs were introduced. Until recently, such
high-speed ships were only capable of carrying passengers and cars.
However, a larger high-speed ship which can also carry lorries is now in
service in Japan.
In October, Stena will introduce into service the largest high-speed
catamaran in the world. This vessel, and two others on order, will be
capable of loading up to 50 lorries, in addition to 100 cars and 1500
passengers. Service speed will be 40 knots and sea-keeping qualities are
said to be equivalent or superior to conventional ferries. Shipping
lines and shipbuilders are now evaluating high-speed technology for pure
freight-carrying vessels.
By employing advanced, high-speed (35 to 40 knot) freight ferries,
attractive service timetables could be offered on each of the three
routes. Each service would need a minimum of two ships to maintain the
sailing schedule. In this feasibility exercise, vessel capacity was
assumed to be 100 12-metre trailers and 50 drivers. The cost of each
ship was put at #25m.
The feasibility study estimated that each service would be more or less
break even operating at 65% of capacity, the same as for Viamare. In the
revenue forecast, it was assumed 25% of vehicles would be
driver-accompanied. The respective market share required on each route
to enable all three to break even was estimated. For Birkenhead it was
13.5%, for Harwich 19% and for Teesport 9%.
Employing high-speed vessels would allow the ferry operator to offer a
similar transit time to the all-road alternative, ensure faster
turnaround at terminals, and provide very attractive timetables.
However, there would be higher operating costs compared with slower
conventional tonnage (mainly through increased fuel consumption).
This would mean the ferry operator would probably be unable to
undercut the already very low road haulage rates. In charging the same
rates as road haulage, the operator would need to stress other
advantages of the service, including less wear and tear on trucks and
trailers, the freeing up of trucks and drivers, and access to a frequent
and reliable sophisticated transport system.
In the longer term, it is very likely the high-speed ferry service
would offer a price advantage, provided road haulage costs continued to
increase, as is forecast.
Customer perceptions
The study considered the views of a variety of potential customers.
The major concerns of road hauliers were that ports should not be too
distant from points of cargo origin and destination, there should be
fast vehicle transfer at the nodes, and costs should be competitive.
In respect of logistics and distribution specialists, the ferry
operator must view its activities as complementary. It could provide a
door-to-door package, forming alliances with hauliers, or
sub-contracting connecting road transport to owner-drivers.
Car manufacturers and car transport firms would consider transferring
some of their traffic to sea if costs were comparable with road
transport, attractive sailing times were offered, and the service was
frequent, offered good transit times and reliability. Delivery times
would have to be maintained, and there would have to be no increase in
vehicle damage.
A common view among all transport users was that the ships would need
to be very fast to compete with road.
Service impacts
Although there would be no immediate cost benefits to industry in
using the ferry service, this would be likely to change as road
transport costs continued to increase. In the longer term, industry's
transport costs could be reduced. Assuming all three suggested services
did achieve their respective market shares, the total employment impacts
(including direct, indirect and induced) were estimated to be 1000 jobs
as a consequence of the services themselves, 340 displaced due to a
reduction in demand for trunk transport, and 1100 from construction of
six high-speed freight ferries.
However, as things stand, it is unlikely the ships would be built in
the UK. If a ferry operator ordered such vessels, they would be more
likely to come from Finland, Norway, Spain, Japan or Australia.
Nevertheless, one Scottish shipyard, Ailsa Perth of Troon, claims it has
sufficient skills to build such ships. Overall, the concept seems
capable of generating significantly more employment than it would
displace.
In addition, much of that generated would be in relatively highly
skilled activities, such as navigation and ferry service management, as
well as possibilities in ship design and construction.
The estimated reduction in vehicle kilometres as a result of the shift
to sea probably would not be significant at the UK or Scottish levels.
However, there would be a significant impact on trunk movements
between Scotland and England. If all three high-speed freight ferry
services achieved 65% capacity utilisation, approximately 15% of
existing trunk traffic would move by sea. This is equivalent to some
300,000 vehicle movements or four million tonnes of freight annually.
The net result would be a reduction in pressure on existing trunk
routes, particularly the M74 and to a lesser extent the A1. This could
also lead to a reduced need for expansion of existing roads, or the need
to create new ones in the future.

A NEW survey of small and medium-sized companies by S G Warburg
confirms other findings that the optimism of the Scottish business
community is fading.
Under two-fifths of Scottish respondents, who headed quoted companies
with capitalisations under #320m, were more optimistic than three months
ago. In the previous survey, conducted six months ago, the equivalent
proportion exceeded 52%. The balance, the optimists less those more
pessimistic for the future, was 24%, the lowest of any area in the
country. It compares with an overall confidence level of 33%, also well
down from the 57% recorded six months ago.
However, smaller companies in Scotland were more positive when it came
to jobs, with 41% indicating their intention to raise their workforce in
the next three months, up from 19% in the previous survey.

THORN EMI has sold 231 former Rumbelows stores to German computer
manufacturer Escom, potentially saving jobs at the electricals chain.
Last month Thorn announced the closure of Rumbelows electrical stores
with the loss of 2500 jobs. Now staff have the chance to apply for jobs
with Escom, which already owns about 24 stores in the UK and has
manufacturing operations in Scotland. Escom ranks as the third-largest
computer seller in Europe, with a 1994 market share of 9.5%.
Thorn got out of the overcrowded electricals retailing market with the
closure of Rumbelows, but on Thursday became a bookseller, buying
Dillons and Hatchards bookstores from the receivers of the Pentos for
#36m.

I WAS dismayed to read Allan Laing's article on the alleged war of
words going on between the BBC and Peter McDougall. The record has to be
set straight.
First, The Herald was on the phone to Peter McDougall within minutes
of Andrea Calderwood's appointment being announced, and so delighted
were you to pounce on the word ''lassie'' that you succeeded in
distorting what he actually said and the context in which it was said.
I happened to be there and heard everything Peter McDougall said. The
world ''lassie'' was used as in ''I'm surprised the job has gone to a
lassie with so little experience'', followed by ''and not because she's
a lassie. I'd have been surprised by the job going to anyone so
inexperienced,'' but the fatal politically incorrect word had been used.
There were also words of support but these didn't fit in with the tone
of the article.
Allan Laing chose not to let the facts get in the way of his one-sided
view. He implied Peter McDougall was the only casualty of the funding
problems and was therefore ''a solitary, ill-tempered Rottweiler''.
Wrong. The distinguished whingeing cockney Trevor Preston, who had
already been commissioned and paid for a further two episodes of The
Negotiator with Brian Cox, was also told funding would not be
forthcoming and was quoted as saying he was seriously unhappy.
The evidence would suggest that the recent quadrupling of commissions
by Andrea Calderwood is perhaps a premature cause for rejoicing until we
see how many of them actually get the funding to be made. I sincerely
hope they do. Scotland needs the work.
The cancelling of Swing Hammer Swing is further confounded by the
message from BBC Scotland that it no longer fits in with the new policy
of concentrating on contemporary drama. If this is the case how does it
justify its latest big-budget project, Easterhouse, a film about two
brothers growing up in Glasgow in the sixties?

GLASGOW Chamber of Commerce never says die when it comes to putting
together business contacts, particularly when it could mean export
orders for companies.
But it was almost flummoxed when it received a communication from JSC
''K &amp; Z'' of Rostov-on-Don in Russia, which wanted to ''find a partner
among Scottish businessness''.
The Russian company asked: ''How could we order the catalogue with the
information about the manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers in the
food industry in your country particular the producing of the powdered
eggs?''
Chamber staff started contacting health food shops in Glasgow, one of
whom told them: ''I don't stock powdered eggs, and would not unless the
eggs were free range!''
Their persistance did pay off, but they had to go all the way to
Buckinghamshire to find a supplier.
In passing on this information in the hope that it may be of some
interest to Business Diary readers, my informant, Margaret Finnie,
remarked in her fax: ''Could you resist your usual 'yolks'.
What a medical
carry on in China
THE Business Diary's China correspondent has been silent for some time
and I had feared he had wandered into Mongolia and got lost.
However, it appears he has only been suffering from a bad bout of
bronchitis brought on by the ''evil air pollution around Tianjin''.
Treatment for this appears to include receiving a ''shot'' in your
posterior in front of the queuing masses.
Our correspondent writes: ''I found myself on the point of lowering my
trousers to a large audience. I had mentally adjusted to the fact that
all sorts of strangers were about to see my bum when I realised that my
earnest ''Girl Friday'' was in the front rank. I had the immediate
thought: 'How can I ever command the respect of a girl who has seen me
bent over, with my trousers down?'
''I came up with a quick solution. I told her: 'You are very welcome
to stay and see my bare bottom. You must realise, however, that if I
show you mine you must show me yours.' Problem solved.''
This occasion was not the end of our exiled Scottish engineer's
embarrassing medical moments. He explained that he now has seven
Filipino engineers working under him who were concerned about what
emergency medical treatment was available in the area.
''Trying to be a good boss and a concerned person, I found the
hospital and requested a meeting. My Girl Friday was in Shanghai so I
had an alternative interpreter with me when I made my visit.
''I was given a complete tour of the hospital accompanied by the head
physician. Finally I found myself in the intensive care unit, faced with
a dying man. It was only then that I realised there had been an error in
communication. They were under the impression that I was a doctor and
were asking my advice.

Beware of itchy
bank managers
BUSINESS customers of the TSB should watch carefully the body language
of their bank manager the next time they meet.
The TSB Commercial Banking Centre engaged psychologist Dr David Lewis
to give 10 dos and don'ts concerning your body when trying to conduct a
successful business meeting.
Among the don't is don't rub your ear, scratch your neck or tug your
collar. According to Dr Lewis, rubbing your ear betrays a ''subconscious
desire to block out the other person's words'', so if you think your
manager is pondering your request for an additional overdraft facility
as he or she rubs an ear you're wrong -- it is actually an attempt not
to hear you.
Similarly, if you spot some neck scratching beware. That is a sign
that your manager is not telling the whole truth when he or she promises
to try to get TSB head office to agree to your request. According to our
eminent psychologist, this practice means that what a person is saying
conflicts with their true feelings, and they could be deceiving you.
And if your manager tugs his or her collar while telling you: ''I'm
sure we can come to some accommodation'', forget it. This piece of body
language means another fib.
The TSB Commercial Banking Centre is giving away copies of How to
Approach Your Bank Manager as a guide to business body language tips.
Myself, I have always found on bended knee the best approach.

MARGINS are continuing to suffer at MFI, the furniture retailer and
manufacturers headed by Derek Hunt. The company said yesterday that raw
material price increases has resulted in in a gross margin which is
''slightly lower'' in the half-year to March 1, 1995 than the 52.9%
margin achieved in the first half. This rather took the gloss of an 8.5%
increase in sales over the period with France up 55.4% and the UK 6.6%.
The market concentrated on margins, where it had hoped to see some
slight improvement, and cut profit projections from up to #80m to #65m
at the same time slicing 5p off the share price to 110p.
The decline in margins also reflected the fact that sales of
appliances and beds have shown stronger growth than kitchens and
bedroms. MFI manufactures the latter but not the former and has to bring
them in from outside.
MFI has not put up prices to try to make up for raw material cost
rises but will do so when it is considered practical though clearly this
would not recoup the full cost.
New ovens, which will be produced by Hygena, and further manufacturing
developments should help to improve margins during the new financial
year by replacing some of the products currently bought from external
suppliers.
MFI also said it will continue to seek further improvements in
productivity within manufacturing and retailing in order to help
mitigate some of these cost and margin pressures.

* My pension fund will mature in a few weeks and I wonder which
company on the open market has the best track record for supplying a
pension, which could be a joint pension, half on death to my widow, or a
joint one but with added RPI. Would it be better to have a joint pension
with 50% widow's pension and 8% annual escalation?
* You can take 25% of a personal pension fund as cash and it is
usually considered a good idea to do this. It gives more flexibility
than having the whole fund locked up in an annuity, and you can still
invest the money for income.
The 75% remaining has to be used to buy an annuity. An inflation
linked one is the most secure, but it means taking a relatively low
starting income, particularly if you want to leave your widow a half
pension on your death. Escalation at 8% is too high and is likely to be
well ahead of inflation.
Annuity rates change all the time. To get the best deal you should
consult a specialist broker such as The Annuity Bureau (0171 620 4090)
or Annuity Direct (0171 375 1175).
* I have noted with alarm that nearly all my investments have fallen
in value, particularly the PEPs. I am a single person, retiring in two
years, with a small company pension of approximately #2500, plus the
state pension. I will badly need income. I have #18,500 in a building
society, #3000 in premium bonds, #4500 in a Tessa, and a portfolio of
investment trusts, unit trusts, and PEPs (list supplied).
Should I cash in the lot and put it in the building society, switch
investments, or consult a stockbroker?
* The stock market is about 500 points below its all-time high of a
year ago, so it is not surprising that ''nearly all'' your investments
have fallen.
We would strongly advise you not to sell the lot. A common mistake
made by private investors is to sell out at or near the bottom of the
market. In fact, your total assets still exceed #70,000, and although
the value of your investments has dropped, their dividend earning
capacity has not. From an income point of view you should be no worse
off.
Your retirement is still some time away, but it would do no harm to
consult a stockbroker about the quality of your investments. Once you
retire it should be possible to increase your income since the bulk of
your money is tied up in low-yielding trusts.
* For the 1995/96 tax year the age allowance income limit is #14,600.
Could you please tell me if there are any deductions allowable such as
mortgage interest payments or private medical insurance premiums which
you can deduct from your gross income to establish your age allowance
income?
* The age allowance income limit is based on your total income for tax
purposes, which is defined as statutory earned and investment income
from all sources, less charges on income.
Charges are generally annual payments made under deduction of income
tax at the basic rate. These include payments made under charitable and
certain other covenants, maintenance or ailment payments made under
pre-1989 agreements and interest payments. Mortgage interest relief was
included as a qualifying interest payment up to and including 1993/94,
but since Miras was cut to 20% (15% for 1995/96) such interest is no
longer a charge on income.
Broadly, if a relief is given as an income reduction it does not
reduce income for age allowance purposes. Thus private medical insurance
premiums would not be deductible either.
* I am retired and my wife is taking early retirement at the end of
March. We would like to get our finances in order at that time. We have
#12,000 in a joint Royal Bank gold ninety account. I have #10,000
National Savings 40th issue and #11,500 National Savings pensioners'
bond. I receive #604 a month from three pensions, including the state
pension. I also have 100 Abbey National shares.
My wife, who is retiring two years early, has inherited #15,000 in a
gold ninety account, #25,000 in Royal reward, #3000 in a Tessa, #25,000
in M&amp;G managed income and #25,000 in a Sun Life distribution bond,
neither of which seem to be doing well.
She also has an Equitable Life single premium insurance for #4200 and
#8600 in two PEPs. She has #6500 civil service AVCs and #4000 in RNFPM
pension fund. She also inherited 100 Abbey National, 660 TSB and 440
Scottish Power shares. In April she will have another #35,000 from the
sale of a house she inherited and intends to put this into National
Savings to provide income along with a pension lump sum of #10,500. She
will have a pension of #3500.
As we are naive regarding investments and do not want to gamble, we
would appreciate your advice on whether our investments are reasonable
and how best we can avoid inheritance tax.
* You are in a strong financial position, but you are in need of
expert advice so you can make best use of your resources.
In all, you will have pensions of around #10,750 per annum, and
capital of nearly #200,000, the bulk of which is currently in banks and
National Savings.
The main exception is the #50,000 you wife has in income and
distribution bonds. You are by no means the only investors to complain
about the performance of bonds, which tend to do poorly in relation to
investment and unit trusts.
We also doubt the wisdom of investing chunks of capital in sums as
large as #25,000 instead of obtaining a broader spread of assets.
In relation to your total capital, you have very little invested in
shares and PEPs. Cash investments are strictly for income and do not
allow you to protect the real value of your capital.
In the circumstances, we strongly advise you to consult a good
stockbroker about the investment of your capital. You should have a
spread of equities to provide long-term capital and income growth, with
immediate income needs provided by gilts and high income deposits.
The Stock Exchange in Glasgow will be able to supply a list of
Scottish stockbrokers.
It is difficult to assess the size of your potential inheritance tax
problem without knowing the value of your house. A stockbroker would
point you in the right direction for professional advice on this aspect
of your finances.
Unsure about capital gains
* In the tax years ended 1978 and 1986 I sold some shares which
resulted in capital gains, the detail of which were reported as follows.
The total gain for 1978 was #2562, with capital losses available of
#14,092, giving a net loss carried forward of #11,530. For 1986 the
total gain was #9618, with a #11,530 capital loss available, and annual
exemption of #5900, giving a net loss carried forward of #7812. In
addition, there was a further loss of #418 in November 1988 which makes
the total carried forward #8230.
As regards the year 1978, no deduction was made for the annual
exemption, and for the two years no deduction was made for indexation
allowance. If these two allowances were available, is it too late to
claim and request them to be added to the figures for losses carried
forward?
* You must remember that capital gains and the tax due on these gains
were calculated in a very different manner in 1978. In particular, no
indexation allowance was available. The loss carried forward from 1978
depends on whether it was incurred in the same year as the gain or
brought forward from an earlier year.
Assuming that it was incured in the same year, no annual exemption
would be available and the loss can be carried forward without time
limit.
We suggest that the best way of approaching the 1986 problem is to
write to your Inspector of Taxes advising him or her that you have
calculated the allowable losses carried forward incorrectly and then
provide the correct calculation.
As there has been no assessment on tax made, the six-year time limit
available for taxpayers to correct errors does not apply and it is
probable that the Inspector will accept the new computation. However,
you will find that he or she may wait until a year in which you have
gains to set it against before examining the position in detail and
confirming it.
* I hold two Guardian Capital Builder policies. The first is dated
March 1984 and I currently pay in #17.71 per month. I elected the
investment between Pacific and equity and the current value is #2200.
The death benefit is valued at #3086.
The second policy is dated March 1985 with current payments of #53.14
per month. The full premium is allotted to equity and the value of the
units at March 1994 was #6250, with life cover of #8779.
As my husband and I are approaching retiral and we have adequate
superannuation and life cover in place, we are now considering cashing
in both of these policies especially as there is no forfeiture for
surrender after 10 years.
We do not think we should leave the policies in place to become part
of our estate but have no urgent need of the funds at present, though we
feel that we ourselves should share the benefit of these savings.
If we hold the policies for perhaps the rest of this year, do you
think that they will exceed the above values, and do you think it is
worthwhile now to convert the Pacific units to equity?
* If the consensus forecasts for the UK stock market are correct, then
your investment in the UK equity fund should be worth more by the end of
the year. As for switching the units in the Pacific region into the
equity fund, it might be more prudent to do this given the volatile
nature of the Pacific markets. However, they have been depressed lately
and there is a possibility of a recovery later in the year.
One other point -- you may still be getting 12.5% tax relief on the
first policy's premiums which would make sustaining it more worthwhile.

MURRAY RITCHIE needs to come back to Scotland and watch a bit of BBC
Scotland's television output instead of recycling lazy caricatures
(February 24). It's a long time since we dealt in ''mawkish tartanry''.
He and others are concerned with the lack of television coverage of
Celtic Connections. Since I shared platforms with Murray Ritchie in his
banjo-playing days in East Africa, I also share his love of folk music
and am delighted by the success of Celtic Connections, both with the
live audience and with the comprehensive coverage it receives on Radio
Scotland.
Concert performance on TV is a different matter: a straight lift of
Celtic Connections is unlikely, but I hope Murray Ritchie will be home
in the summer when we transmit Transatlantic Sessions on BBC2, a
six-part series featuring many of those artists who have contributed so
much to the success of the festival.

DUNFERMLINE Building Society has improved its discounts on variable
rate mortgages and introduced one with a fixed rate of 2.29% until
November 1, with no application fee and #100 cashback where a valuation
report is commissioned by the society. The discounts vary between 1.4%
and 2.46% depending on loan to value proportion and duration of the
discount.
SCOTTISH Amicable has fixed the rate on its guaranteed PEP at 7.5% on
a #6000 investment, or 7% for monthly income. The rate is fixed until
December 2000, when full return of initial capital is guaranteed. The
company points out that a basic rate taxpayer would need 10% gross to
equal the return offered. During the offer period until April 13,
investors with a PEP with another manager can transfer into the new one.
ROYAL Bank of Scotland has lopped 1% off the APR rate on its personal
loans available up to May 12 for loans exceeding #2000. Customers with a
#5000 loan over three years will now pay #170.91 a month against
#173.42.
SCOTTISH Friendly Society has launched Scottish Investment Bond, a
single premium unit-linked investment with a minimum premium of #1000.
It offers a choice of five funds, managed, UK equity, fixed interest,
cash, and a selection of Scottish investment trusts the choice to be
made by the bond fund manager.
Investors are able to switch between funds and take an income if
required. Though designed as a long-term investment, money can be
retrieved without penalty.
STANDARD Life Fund Management has scrapped the initial charge
(currently 5.5%) on its Global and Home Advantage unit trusts. There
will continue to be no withdrawal fee. The trusts are designed for PEP
investors.

DR HARRY BURNS, a surgeon trained in clinical and scientific medicine,
gave a reasoned reply to criticism of his letter linking poverty with
ill health (February 25). That there is such a link is almost certainly
true, but the nature of the link is by no means clear and until we know
what factors are involved it will not be possible to take effective
remedial action.
The kneejerk response is of course to ask for more Government money to
increase the level of support for those less well off; to tax the rich;
to produce a financial levelling of society by one means or another.
However, I do not know of evidence of improved health in the former
communist world.
Conversely there is evidence that sudden unexpected increase in wealth
is frequently detrimental to health and that those who inherit wealth,
particularly at a young age, but who do not shoulder the
responsibilities that go with their inheritance, often fall prey to
alcohol and drug abuse with resultant ill health.
The old adage that a healthy mind and a healthy body go together I
believe to be true. To obtain this there are a number of basic
requirements. These include employment and the perception of work as a
good thing rather than a chore. Education in the broadest sense is
needed to maintain mental and physical wellbeing and to give each
individual a sense of worth, of belief in his or her own abilities, and
thus permit integration with family, friends, neighbours, and the local
community.
Education is also required on how to use time to benefit others and
therefore oneself. Leadership at both local and national level is
necessary to enable those who have something to give to impart their
skills to those who are willing to learn.
A healthy mind also calls for a knowledge of right and wrong, of good
and evil, and this too must be taught.
No doubt money is required to make these things happen but money alone
will not narrow the health gap between the rich and poor.

THE growing crisis in the National Health Service has justifiably
produced a widespread correspondence. The insulting 1% pay offer to
nurses at a time of the executives' pay bonanza exposes both the
hypocritical reality of the Government's wage freeze and the financially
obsessed nature of the trust-driven NHS.
Further evidence of the local crisis within the NHS is to be found in
the Greater Glasgow Health Board's five consultation documents. A long
list of hospitals, including Rutherglen, Knightswood, Canniesburn,
Lennox Castle, Rottenrow, and the Western Infirmary, now face closure.
The scale of the GGHB's Government-inspired cuts is staggering -- 994
acute beds are to be lost permanently as part of a #56m package of cuts,
with the crucial accident and emergency provision reduced to a mere
three departments.
No amount of rhetoric can conceal the real prospect of endangered
lives and lost jobs which these measures imply. Nor can the prospect of
increased community care mask the hypocrisy of a #56m cut in Glasgow's
health budget while HCI in Clydebank benefits from #43m of Government
money.
If the GGHB proposals are not overturned, the NHS in Glasgow, already
stretched to near breaking point, will be unrecognisable as a service
existing to meet people's health needs. Thankfully the complacency
evident in certain political circles is not shared by the large umbers
in the communities and the hospitals who are prepared to fight to defend
the basic right of free and available health care.
The 250 attending a public meeting to save the Western, the 90 at
Knightswood, and the thousands who are signing petitions in support of
Rutherglen, Lenzie, and the Western mark the start of a campaign to stop
the decimation of Glasgow's health service.

THE recent report on the success of parathyroid hormone in reversing
the bone damage caused by osteoporosis may be premature.
The study in question looked at the effects of this hormone on
laboratory animals and these results will not necessarily be
transferable to humans.
Parathyroid hormone may be able to increase bone mass, but before
hailing it as the first successful treatment for osteoporosis, we need
to be certain of the quality of the new bone formed.
The report also understated the efficacy of hormone replacement
therapy as a treatment for osteoporosis. Oestrogen therapy has been
found not only to halt further bone loss but also enable women to
increase their bone density.
Until further research studies involving the effect of parathyroid
hormone on human bone density have been conducted, HRT remains the most
effective menas of preventing and treating osteoporosis.
HRT has been around for 50 years in the US and has been used
successfully and safely by women in the UK for more than 30 years.
There are other treatments available now too, including calcium and
vitamin D and Etidronate -- particularly useful as they can be of help
to men as well as women with osteoporosis.

TOURISM in Greenock would receive a welcome boost were that whale
(February 27) to decide (as has happened elsewhere regularly through the
centuries) to return most winters in a predictable manner.
The remainder of this week, and weekend, with high tide in mid to late
afternoon, will provide ideal conditions for whale-watching from the
esplanade (provided he doesn't leave, of course).
To see this magnificent, six-metre long creature, only 20 to 30 metres
away, rearing out of the water, dripping fish in a whirling cloud of
seabirds, is without a doubt a lifetime's best educational and natural
history experience for many people (including me).
I know of people living in the south of England who have travelled up
specially to see this whale, yet up here we have John Liddell talking of
eating him (tongue firmly in cheek, one hopes).
If we ate every creature of no obvious immediate commercial value, as
he suggests, just who would decide what is to be eaten and by whom?

I ENTIRELY agree with Christopher Whatley (Herald Essay February 25)
that the neglect of Scottish history in our schools is shameful.
In fact I was part of the editorial team that produced the Saltire
Society pamphlet, ''Why Scottish History Matters'', to which he refers.
An understanding of at least the fundamentals of our history is an
essential part of an adequate education for anyone living in Scotland.
On the other hand Christopher Whatley seems to me to have
misunderstood one of the points about the Union of 1707 which I made in
my recent review of his pamphlet.
The overwhelming evidence is that the Treaty of Union was not the
result of negotiation in the ordinary sense but of the English use of
superior power to assert their control over Scotland.
Unionists often claim, as John Major did recently, that the Union
rested on consent. Since the middle of the last century a number of
writers have suppressed or distorted history in support of this
contention.
It was these attempts, which still continue, which I described as
having more to do with propaganda than scholarship.

AS the person responsible for issuing statements on behalf of
Railtrack in Scotland, I strongly advise Mr Charles Batchelor not to
gamble on there being an announcement that the Forth Bridge is unsafe
and will have to be pulled down (February 28).
I base my betting advice not on the scaremongering of politicians but
on the professional opinion of Railtrack engineers (professionals whom
the railway industry has recruited, trained, and developed over many
years) and on that of the Health and Safety Executive.
Indeed, so confident am I that Railtrack's maintenance regime will
secure the structural integrity of the Forth Bridge, I should be
prepared to wager that long after I am gone one of my successors will
issue statements to celebrate the Forth Bridge's second centenary as
part of this nation's working railway.

JUDITH GREEN wrote regarding access for disabled people at the Art

The level entrance via the basement and then by lift to the gallery
floors has been discontinued. This is on the advice of the fire
authority and is solely for the protection of the public. We are making
alternative arrangements as quickly as possible.
A stair-climbing wheelchair has been ordered and should be available
in early March. This will be for use from the front, Argyle Street
entrance, and designated parking spaces will be available adjacent to
this.
We also have plans already drawn up to provide a lift from the front
entrance but this will depend on planning permission which we hope will
be agreed.
Glasgow Museums regard access for disabled people as a priority and we
will do everything we can to assist all our visitors to gain access.

IT was with some amusement that I read the item in Tom Shields's Diary
to the effect that the Daily Express was somehow failing in its attempts
at ''Scottishness'' (February 28).
I notice, in the selfsame edition, two examples of an increasing
failing in your own columns to achieve acceptable standards of
Scottishness.
First you referred to someone appearing in a Scottish court on two
''counts'' of rape. This is an English expression.
Secondly, and even more heinously, you referred to that doyen of
Scottish advocates and MPs, Menzies Campbell, as a barrister. I would
not be at all surprised if a writ from Mr Campbell for defamation was

TOMORROW'S elections in Hong Kong would normally be the small beer of
municipal politics. This time they will test the degree of support for
the Beijing Government before September's last election to the
Legislative Council, the body whose democratisation begun by Governor
Chris Patten so enraged the Chinese Government. That Government has
decided to run its own candidates tomorrow (and presumably again in the
autumn) but has hedged its bets against electoral slapdown by acting at
one remove, simply ''liaising'' with the pro-Beijing nominees. These are
now organised in one body, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of
Hong Kong (DAB), and have already shown their electoral appeal in
elections for district boards, one of three tiers of elected Government,
last September. They certainly squeezed business candidates badly, but
the real test is with the Democratic Party, a real liberal grouping and,
for that reason alone, anathema to Beijing.
It is more than a century since Chinese ''modernisers'' began
agitating for democracy and almost a century since the revolution of
1911 was thought to have ushered it in. The reality has always been
different, and any lingering doubts about the nature of Chinese
communism after Mao were dispelled by the events of Tiananmen Square six
years ago. Few Hong Kong Democrats have any illusions about the
consequences of the coming transfer of power to the mainland, but they
intend to fight these elections and September's as hard as they can.
Already, however, their efforts are being undermined by popular worry.
The Democrats have the advantage of enjoying mass support among the
younger voters. That should continue at least until the transfer of
power, though tomorrow's performance could be vital. What may yet avoid
the repression most commentators expect to follow the British withdrawal
could be the new mainland dispositions after the death of Deng Xiaoping,
but though these still can only be guessed at, few guesses are
optimistic.

SCOTTISH Office agriculture minister Sir Hector Monro raised hopes
yesterday that the introduction of a single quality mark for Scottish
food products might still be a possibility.
Addressing the National Farmers' Union of Scotland in Aberdeen he said
that last month's decision not to proceed further with the project had
been a difficult one.
He had concluded that the degree of private sector support necessary
to give the project a realistic chance of success was not there.
However, he said yesterday that the project was not forgotten but had
been put ''on the back burner''. If circumstances changed the government
decision to pull out of the project could be reversed, he said. He would
require, however, to see a positive indication from the food
distribution industry that they wished to see the idea revived.
The cancellation of the single quality mark did not mean the end of
quality initiatives, said the minister. 'We have a growing number of
excellent sector quality schemes -- for beef lamb, pigs, cereals, trout
and salmon. I want to see these prosper and to see new schemes joining
them.
''Quality is not an optional extra. For those farmers who question why
they should join a quality scheme unless there is a premium price I
would reply ''if you do not invest in quality and meet high standards
increasingly being demanded by manufacturers and retailers, there may
not be a market for your products at all''.
On the issue of animal welfare Sir Hector endorsed the NFUS leadership
view that a long-term approach was required. He advised farmers to
recognise that a reduction in live exports could be a factor for some
time to come. It would help, he said, if more exports could be in
carcase form rather than on the hoof.
''If we can increase the production of welfare-friendly beef and veal
we can turn a threat into an opportunity,'' he suggested. ''But
government can only do so much. There has to be a recognition by all
sectors of the farming community that the public interest in animal
welfare is not a short-term problem which will go away if we ignore
it.''
It would be easy to lump all of the animal rights protestors as
ignorant or anarchist, he said. There were some, however, who had a
realistic understanding of the farming industry and a genuine concern
about the way in which animals were treated.
''These people represent a significant strand of public opinion. They
also represent the views of many of your customers and they have to be
listened to.''
In the short term, he said, the Government would do its best to ensure
that British farmers were not put at a competitive disadvantage by lax
controls elsewhere. In the longer term they would be pressing for
welfare standards throughout Europe to be aligned with those in Britain.
In a question and answer session after his speech Sir Hector indicated
that he was very worried about intervention board delays in processing
milk quota transfers. He had been told that 95% of cases had been
resolved, he said, ''but I take that with a pinch of salt after some
constiuency cases I have had.'' He had asked the Scottish Office
agriculture department to ascertain the exact position, he said.
At the union's annual general meeting, following the Minister's
speech, Mr Jim Wyllie lost his place as a vice-president of the union
and was replaced by Mr Stewart Whiteford, convener of the livestock
committee. Mr Wyllie had served for one year.
Mr John Ross was re-elected for a sixth term as president and Mr Sandy
Mole was returned for a further year as a vice president.
In all there were four nominations for the two vice-president posts.
Mr John McMyn, convener of the employment and technology committee, was
the other unsuccessful contender.

IT has been a long time since the US dollar was almighty but its
recent weakness, after a long decline against other currencies, is
distinctly unsettling. It may be suffering from the generous efforts
made by President Clinton to save Mexico from its own problems with the
peso, but its weakness really antedates that and stems from the way in
which the US has become a debtor nation on a colossal scale. The country
remains the world's most innovative economy and has plenty of potential,
but its borrowings are now a huge burden which its politicians seem
unable to address, although the Republicans, a majority in both Senate
and the House of Representatives, say they want to do so. In fact no-one
seems willing to incur the odium involved in raising the taxes required
to reduce the budget deficit. The political costs of that approach are
conspicuous in this country: few like to pay more taxes, and punish
those who impose them. Both President Clinton and his Republican enemies
vie with each other in promising tax cuts. They ought not to be
surprised when foreigners do not want to hold dollars, even though these
finance much of world trade.
The US Treasury still finds it relatively easy to fund its borrowings;
but Japanese investors have become increasingly leery of sending more
money into a market where capital loss is almost guaranteed. American
finance houses, long accustomed to identifying ''English bonds'' as the
world's worst fixed interest investment, are now confronted with their
own. It is not all loss, however. Cheap dollars have helped boost US
exports and made imports dearer. Some European politicians believe this
is the deliberate aim of the US monetary authorities. The Federal
Reserve, the US central bank, was contradicting them yesterday, buying
dollars for yen and marks. Were the dollar to turn up, it might do so
dramatically, but without higher domestic taxation that seems very
unlikely.

LAST year's changeover from milk marketing board control to a free
market in the dairy sector has left Britain wide open to overseas
exploitation, an Irish dairy and meat company chief warned yesterday.
''Continental and Irish dairy companies have their greedy eye on the
market opportunity which will be presented in the coming months if
present milk prices are sustained,'' said Patrick O'Neill, group
managing director of Avonmore Foods.
''It is the marginal milk which is potentially a candidate for this
market and I have no doubt that if cheese prices, for example, exceed
#2800 per tonne then we shall see significant imports this year.''
Speaking at the annual conference of the Royal Association of British
Dairy Farmers at Malvern, he said there was a delicate balance to be
struck between high producer prices, profits for processors and
opportunities for British milk to retain its market share.
''The best way to achieve a consensus on the way forward is for
extensive dialogue to take place between all participants in the
industry and at the same time avoid the confrontation which has
characterised the changeover from boards to the present system.
''It is not in the interest of any of us to have dramatic swings in
product or milk prices. Gradual change will win the support of consumers
and producers and will secure the long-term benefit of all.''
Mr O'Neill revealed that Avonmore, which has already moved into the
British market, was looking for further expansion here. At the same
time, he said there was room for British and Irish companies to tackle
the continental market.
Jim Dickinson of the Pennines-based Longley Farm Dairy Business, told
delegates that in spite of Britain's overall lack of self-sufficiency in
milk, standardisation of fat in drinking milk meant so much cream was
now being produced it had to be tankered away to the continent instead
of being processed in Britain.
Farmers and the dairy industry had to readjust their thinking to look
on milk as a feedstock for the different product sectors; just like
crude oil. Milk could be refined into fat, casein, and whey protein
fractions at low cost to be recombined according to final product.
''In fact it may be that mini-dairies are placed on farms or at milk
depots which would refine the milk into the fractions the buyer needs.
It is cheaper to collect and process less water and it is very easy in a
dairy to alter fat and protein levels.
''Milk is a very complex material. It has been a basic food for
centuries. Increasingly it is being seen as a bundle of components, each
with its own physical and chemical attributes, that represent the
feedstock of a modern processing industry.''

Mogadishu, Friday
SEVERAL Somalis were killed and dozens wounded today as American
marines left Somalia in a blaze of cannon and machine-gun fire, doctors
said.
As they went, the devastated African country's top warlord, Mohamed
Farah Aideed, said Somalis ''can rule our country'' and that civil war
would not return in the wake of the UN pull-out.
A Pentagon spokesman said he believed six Somalis were killed in some
four separate incidents during ''Operation United Shield'', the mission
launched to get the remaining UN blue berets out of Somalia and end the
two-year UN presence there.
Aideed's Somali National Alliance put the number of Somalis killed by
the withdrawing US troops at 13, with 30 wounded.
''That was the last wrong footsteps of international forces,'' said
Abdulkarim Ahmed Ali, a close political ally of Aideed.
The UN peacekeepers ended famine in the country but left it still in
the grip of armed militias, without proper schools, hospitals, a justice
system, or a government.
Today the latest wounded were being treated in two squalid hospitals
in south Mogadishu.
Doctors said several people died in their houses when they were hit by
fire from the airport beach from which the last Americans withdrew under
cover of darkness.
Residents said 35-year-old Abdullahi Mohamed Ali, who worked for the
UN Development Programme, was killed instantly when a projectile hit him
as he lay in bed on a verandah.
Pools of blood stained the ground in one house, which was punched with
holes the size of watermelons.
''We were just sleeping in our houses and we don't know what the
firing was all about,'' said a Somali man whose son was killed in the
hour before the marines left in an amphibious withdrawal at 1am.
Asked about the Pentagon estimate of six dead, Lieutenant-General Tony
Zinni, who commanded Operation United Shield, said his men took action
only when they were directly threatened.
The marines' parting shots marked the end of two years of foreign
military intervention during which 132 peacekeepers and hundreds of
Somalis were killed.
Dozens of American soldiers were killed in street battles with
Aideed's militiamen in 1993 before the hunt for him was abandoned after
five months. American troops left Somalia a year ago, with the marines
returning only to cover the final UN retreat.
Aideed, beaming and exultant, celebrated the departure by throwing a
party at his house, which has been renovated since American gunships
bombed it in June 1993.
With his militiamen in control of Mogadishu's port and airport, he
said: ''I am pleased that all foreign forces have left and that we can
rule our country, that we can do the job ourselves.''--Reuter.

Washington, Friday
WARMING of the world's oceans has almost wiped out a critical link in
the food-chain for marine-life off America's West Coast.
John McGowan of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at La Jolla
reports that the water temperature off San Diego has climbed by two to
three degrees Fahrenheit since 1951 and the population of zooplankton --
tiny animals which are the primary food source for marine species -- has
declined by 80%.
As a result the fish and bird population have no food, and the once
teeming waters are now almost void of life, McGowan claims in a study
published in the American Journal of Science.
''It already is pretty dead out there,'' he said. The scientist said
he remembers an abundance of fish and bird-life on scientific cruises in
the 1960s and that on a recent cruise ''I was flabbergasted at the
difference.''
McGowan and Dean Roemmich, also of Scripps, reported on the results of
hundreds of thousands of water, temperature, and plankton samples taken
during 222 scientific cruises over the last 42 years.
The cruises covered the same sampling sites within a 50,000 sq mile
area off the coast of San Diego and Point Conception, California.
During the period, McGowan said there has been an increase in
temperature in the upper 600ft of water and a drop in zooplankton.
''Zooplankton is the main diet for many species of fish, including
sardines, anchovy, hake, jack mackerel, and Pacific mackerel,'' he said.
''This could have a very strong effect on fish survivorship.''
McGowan explained that the increased water temperature is robbing
surface waters of nutrients, such as nitrates and phosphates, the plant
plankton need to survive. Since the zooplankton feed on the smaller
plant plankton, the loss of nutrients sends a ripple up the entire
food-chain.
He said there was no way to determine whether the warming was being
caused by the greenhouse effect, or natural change.
''If we can pin it down to the greenhouse effect, then we've really
got something to worry about,'' he said.
Commercial anchovy fishing in the area already has crashed and the
commercial fish harvest for other species has declined by about 40%
since the 1970s, McGowan added.
Dick Veit, a University of Washington zoologist, said the findings
were consistent with other studies that have shown marked losses of fish
and seabird populations along the Pacific coast.
* A giant iceberg drifting north in seas near the tip of South America
could pose a serious danger to shipping in the region if it breaks up,
Chilean ecologists said.
The iceberg, which broke off recently from the Antarctic Peninsula, is
45 miles long and is drifting in freezing seas 600 miles from Cape Horn.

FOR me, the home-video age has all but ended. I still like a night in
with a movie, but thankfully the cinema outing seems to be pricing
itself back into the market. I've always preferred going out to the
pictures; there's far more to it than merely watching a film. There are
all the extras to consider, and for an unrepentant thirtysomething fat
boy, the food is definitely one of the major attractions of modern-day
cinema.
If I had my way, there would be Oscars given for sweets (''. . . and
this year's award for Best Gigantic Jelly Spider goes to . . .''). The
Pic'n'Mix sweets are expensive, but only because each one contains
enough E-additives to keep a class of five-year-olds awake for a
fortnight.
I'm not sure I believe all this E-additive propaganda. Is it just
another middle-class excuse for children's inability to behave in a
socially acceptable way. Being obnoxious is one of the few talents that
is given to all children in equal measure. Some parents can't accept
that their child is just like any other, and that glass of blackcurrant
juice they had back in 1993 seems an ideal culprit. If artificial
colourings really were mind-altering substances then you'd have
Columbian Pastille barons: pop stars wouldn't suffocate on their own
vomit. Well, not unless they'd eaten all the green Opal Fruits.
Anyway, back at the foyer, you might choose to go straight to the
old-fashioned sweet counter. At first glance their sweet packets look
familiar. Watch out, though, as the bags are about the same size as the
average duvet cover. That's why you need a mortgage to buy a bag of
Maltesers. (''Are you getting served Sir?'' ''Yes, we're just waiting
for the survey report on the wine gums.'')
I prefer the newer picture houses that eschew the musty forties-style
atmosphere. In London the flicks are all shiny-new, incorporating some
marvellous innovations, and unfortunately some totally useless ones.
There's no end of choice. You can see any film at almost any time of
the day. The seats are huge, and each armrest has a holder big enough to
take the basin of Coke that constitutes a small serving. So there's no
more fumbling around dirty cinema floors and spilling Fanta on your
shoes -- well, not while looking for your drink anyway.
If films are all about escapism, then modern-day sound systems mean
that you can now feel as if you're actually there in the middle of the
car chase, the fight, or both at the same time! So although cinema helps
you escape, it now only takes you as far as Paisley. The new sound
technology must be the cinematic equivalent of the new toy. In recent
years, when you saw a van driving across the screen, your mind was
allowed to think ''That van's moving''. With new systems, the sound has
to start from the left speaker, then gradually increase in volume from
the right. On being presented with all this information, you worry how
the sound manages to move across the screen faster than the van.
The system of ratings has changed slightly. I have fond memories of
the old ''X'' rating. In Cumbernauld parlance, ''X'' had come to stand
for ''What-you-couldn't-see-at-home'', ie, lots of fighting and snogging
(Alert: This last word may have been censored.) The ''X''s addressed the
adolescent obsessions of the day, ie, sex (surprise!) and Kung Fu, and
all had titles in the form of tabloid headlines.
The average Saturday night showing of Ninja Dragon Pulls Birds would
be full of 14-year-old boys with moustaches drawn on with mascara (the
girls don't need mascara, and anyway they'd all gone off to see Grease
for the twelfth time). For a certain generation, the Back Row of the
Pictures has assumed a racy image, loaded with implications of
adolescent couplings. Maybe this is just me, but cinema seats seem to
have been produced by a particularly cruel and devious puritanical
designer, probably with a teenage daughter of his own, specifically to
deter any contact between adjacent seats. Putting an arm round someone
else's shoulder for longer than the Pearl and Dean bit involved a form
of slow amputation. I'm sure that any more daring contact was
impossible. Older generations were probably more desperate.
Instead of wasting their time on fancy hi-fis, the studios should
develop a system which tells you if you're going to like the film. In an
attempt to gain some sort of cred, I went to see Natural Born Killers,
Glasgow's usually prudish city fathers having given it the go-ahead. NBK
(he said trendily) will certainly be more knowledgeably reviewed
elsewhere, but having paid my fiver, I retain the right to state that it
is undoubtedly the most overhyped tosh I have ever had to sit through.
It's not that I have any moral objection to screen violence, but the
gory murders get completely monotonous, the effect being more ''obvious
claptrap'' than ''marvellous satire on media excesses''.
The film is part of a new genre of farce, and instead of each
character having his trousers falling down in front of the vicar, he
gets his brains blown out. Pulp Fiction was at best an average film, but
alongside NBK it looks like (Insert name of favourite film here).
I'm not sure that councillors should be allowed to ban films, but I
would respect them more if they had banned this on the grounds that it's
crap. It was a council ban, after all, that forced me to go to Falkirk
to see The Life of Brian. At the time, having a bad dose of adolescence,
I told everyone I was exercising my rights, striking a blow for free
speech, and was generally fighting the reactionary forces. Yes I was
that pathetic.
Deep down, my motivation was really the same as the punters who'll be
queuing to see NBK, the urge to go out to see a good film. About five
years after being banned from the city of Glasgow, The Life of Brian was
made available on video, giving the people of Strathclyde a good laugh.
A case of art imitating local government. The good thing about video is
that you'll never have some half-wit councillor acting as your censor.
Strawberry sherbet Refresher anyone?
I saw Allan Chisholm's letter regarding the time taken to travel to
the nearest star. Al, you didn't take into account that Killin might be
4.3 light years from Alpha Centauri, but to go from Glasgow you need to
cross the Kingston Bridge: some would say 100 years is an underestimate.
In future, any other interesting astronomical points should be sent to
The Scotsman, Salt-and-Sauce Way, Edinburgh ED1 ZZZ.

English incomer Gavin Stamp argues that now is the time for Scotland
to take stock of its history and amend the settlement of 1707.
FOR much of my life I have been haunted by two contradictory truths
imparted to me at an early age. One was the favourite aphorism of my
school chaplain, that an open mind is an empty mind. So often true --
but it is countered by the liberating notion that to change your mind
shows that you have one.
I have changed my mind about Scotland. Once I believed in the Union as
it stands. No longer. As an Englishman, then resident in London, I
regarded the devolution proposals of the 1970s with dismay. This was not
because, like far too many of my compatriots, I was ignorant of Scotland
but because I knew and liked the country and so regretted any separation
between two nations which had achieved so much together.
Like so many, I was brought up to regard Scottish nationalism as a
joke. More recently, when Scots complained that they were misgoverned by
the Conservative establishment in Westminster, I argued that the English
were misgoverned too -- which was, and is, true.
But now, owing to the inestimable boon of coming to live in Glasgow, I
have changed my mind. I was deeply impressed when a Cambridge friend
told me how he had decided to return, with high hopes, to his native
Edinburgh at the time of the referendum. That made me think. But
thinking has also been encouraged by direct experience of the
contemptuous arrogance of the Government in Westminster towards
Scotland. It is an arrogance based on ignorance and prejudice, as has
been revealed by recent discussion of the Labour Party's devolution
proposals.
London newspapers which ought to know better write of Scotland's
proposed parliament as a ''provincial'' assembly. Do they not know that
Scotland was a historic independent kingdom which voluntarily entered
into a political union with England (albeit with the encouragement of
threats and bribery) and that unions made may be broken? No, they do
not: the southern English know shamefully little about Scotland and
regard it with patronising jocularity -- I am one of them, and I know.
I first visited Scotland in 1968 -- in search of great architecture by
Mackintosh and by Thomson, of course. Never did I imagine that I would
one day live here, although, for a Londoner, a real city like Glasgow is
the only possible alternative. Edinburgh? No. Supremely beautiful as it
is as an urban creation, it is far too narrow, and English, in its
attitudes. As that great Aberdeen-born church designer, Sir Ninian
Comper, wrote to John Betjeman in 1947, ''I have no use at all for
Edinburgh -- it is the nasty, dull, respectable side of Scotland -- not
Scotland at all.''
Naturally I am devoted to Glasgow for embracing me with such unmerited
tolerance, and I was thrilled to be present at the Royal Academy in
London, as a member of Glasgow's steering committee, to hear that we had
won the title of City of Architecture and Design for 1999. (Although
optimistic, I don't think any of us really believed we had done it,
while Edinburgh manifestly thought it had it in the bag; witnessing the
discomforture of its smug officials was a memorably delicious moment.)
But surely Glasgow -- so against the Scottish heritage industry,
anti-kilt, and anti-sentimental -- is an advertisement for the Union.
After all, although an old city, it prospered mightily once it could
trade with former English colonies.
True enough; but the answer, I think, is to be found in the cathedral
(the ancient, real one). On the walls of that vulnerable and underrated
medieval building are a remarkable number of monuments to the Scottish
regiments which served in India, Afghanistan, Burma, South Africa, and
elsewhere. They are typical. Scotland, in effect, seems to have
garrisoned the British Empire.
The Scots, of course, are a martial race, as their disproportionate
and catastrophic casualty lists for the Great War reveal, but it would
be a mistake to assume that all those monuments indicate merely that
Scottish soldiers were used as cannon-fodder in numerous colonial wars.
The plain fact is that Scots ran the British Empire to an extent out
of all proportion to the country's small population. There is the notion
that Scotland itself was a victim of English colonialism, yet not only
the foot soldiers but also the generals, as well as the administrators,
the engineers, and the architects who created the Empire were, to a
remarkable extent, Scottish.
Possibly this is to be explained by the fact that the Empire alone
offered opportunities to an economically and politically oppressed
people; possibly it reflects the traditionally resourceful character of
the Scots, seeking fame and fortune far from home. But it is true none
the less, and very significant.
So what is the point of merely running Britain once the Empire has
gone? A union which was based on shared interest in exploiting the rest
of the world has no longer the same purpose when those outlets have
withered away. It is the collapse of the British Empire which is calling
the Union into question, for it is only now, decades later, that the
traumas of colonial retreat are being experienced -- and these traumas
are currently pulling apart the England I grew up in and loved.
Surely now is the moment, when the so-called United Kingdom is in fact
the most monstrously centralised state in Europe, for Scotland to take
stock of its history and amend the settlement of 1707? It can be done:
the twentieth century is the century of small nations, of
decentralisation. And if Scotland remains too small for the Scots to
run, there is always the rest of Europe.
Yet nothing happens. Although Scotland has no smaller a population
than serious, decent countries like Norway and Finland, and certainly
has no worse a climate or lack of natural resources, deep down its
citizens seem afraid of breaking with England as they remain subservient
to London attitudes and London snobberies. Perhaps things will be
different next time. But far too many of the best people still go south
-- so often, of course, leaving the second-rate to run things up here.
It is all a great puzzle to me as Scotland essentially invented the
modern romantic idea of nationalism from which others have benefited. It
is as if Scotland suffers from wilful amnesia. The English, rightly,
have never forgiven Edward Heath for fiddling with the old counties and
destroying the East Riding and Rutland. In Scotland, typically, an even
more ruthless and unsentimental restructuring of ancient names took
place, yet so few seem to care.
Perhaps that merely shows how little I understand Scotland and its
pragmatism, for I must recognise I will always be an outsider. Apart
from the fundamental disability of having English cloth ears, I can
never be a real Glaswegian because of my lack of sympathy for certain
local, or national, characteristics.
For a start, there is the cult of the motor car. Despite the cheering
M77 protests, Scotland remains in thrall of Mrs Thatcher's ''great car
economy'' even more than England, while Glasgow's continuing adherence
to the dreadful logic of the ludicrous Bruce Plan of 1945, with
motorways smashing through the city centre, seems to a non-driving
metropolitan Londoner as barbaric as it is un-European. The converse of
the car cult -- the squalor of the Strathclyde orange bus (which I use
every day) -- is as much a cause for shame as the malicious neglect of
that supreme -- and essential -- Scottish monument, the Forth rail
bridge.
Then there is my distaste for Irn-Bru and my deep, ineradicable
loathing of anything to do with football (I am fearful of provoking
civil unrest even as I write this). But football-worship, in fact, is
merely a manifestation of a wider phenomenon which is the exclusive
Glaswegian identification with working-class values. Indeed, to a
considerable extent, Scottishness seems to be defined in proletarian
terms.
It is, of course, thoroughly healthy that Scotland is less overtly
class-ridden than England and I have learned that most urban Scots are
closer to their roots than their English equivalents. But for an
incurably middle-class Englishman like myself, while there is certainly
no vice in being working-class, there seems no special virtue in it
either.
It may be a necessary national myth (like the Auld Alliance), but for
Scotland to see itself only in terms of working-class culture is,
simply, a historical lie. Whether for better or for worse it was the
merchants of Glasgow who made the city great and it was the middle
classes who paid for most of the surviving magnificent buildings which
continue to astonish the visitor. And this was possible because Scotland
was a meritocracy.
It was the belief in education that enabled people from the humblest
background to raise themselves up and do great things, and Edinburgh's
intellectual flowering in the eighteenth century was certainly no
celebration of proletarian values. Indeed, Scotland's principal export
for several centuries was seriously educated people. They ran the
Empire, after all.
The tragedy now is that Scotland's education system has been
undermined by the thoughtless and politically-inspired adoption of every
single destructive innovation emanating from England. But all is not
lost, and Scots should never forget that this small country could once
boast four universities while much larger England had a mere two.
But my greatest regret with Glasgow is what I sense beneath the
surface. Behind all the bravado, and optimism, and humour of the city of
culture, I feel there is doubt and insecurity, a continuing inferiority
complex towards wretched England -- even among the posturing
politicians. Why else should the city tolerate me?
Perhaps this is not surprising: it reflects a defeatism which comes
from almost 80 years of continuous economic decline. Glasgow's greatest
days have passed, and all Scotland has suffered dreadfully as the
British Empire retreated. And out of defeat comes self-hatred.
It was that feeling which made the great Victorian cities of the North
of England try to destroy themselves in the 1960s in the worship of the
false utopia of modernity. And Glasgow tried to go even further -- to
the dismay of its many admirers. How could the Professors' Houses in the
High Street, McGeoch's Warehouse, Queen's Park Terrace, or St Andrew's
Square have been destroyed as recently as the 1970s, even the 80s? Were
-- are -- the people running this wonderful city mad?
That underlying culture is not yet dead. I am constantly amazed by the
way Glasgow is so prodigal with its precious assets. Decent stone
buildings are still being casually destroyed, their fittings and
building materials thrown into skips when they ought to be recycled.
There is still too much of an acceptance of the tawdry, of the utterly
mediocre. Far too much of Glasgow still looks too much like the worst
parts of the United States rather than like a modern European city.
I am loath to blame this vandalism on the character of the Celts --
Scotland has produced so many great architects, after all; perhaps it
stems from the historical tragedy of Scotland following Calvin rather
than Luther. But I pray that Glasgow's role as City of Architecture and
Design in 1999 will spur the city to do better things which really are
possible if the spirit is willing.
Of course there are daunting economic problems to overcome, while it
does not help that so much money flees to outer-suburban non-places like
Bearsden and Newton Mearns; it is Edinburgh's strength that solid
citizens still live in the centre of that supreme urban creation.
The problem, in Glasgow and elsewhere in Scotland, is an essential
lack of confidence. And that necessary confidence would surely return if
Scotland ran its own affairs again rather than be governed by
second-rate non-accountable quangos acting on behalf of Westminster.
Perhaps not complete independence (I am English, after all, and the
fates of England and Scotland are inextricably linked), but home rule
within the United Kingdom -- and the European Union -- seems a most
reasonable aspiration. I must, of course, beware of that mischievous
English trait of romantic identification with foreign causes. An
outsider I will remain, but it will gladden my declining years to see
Scotland reassert control over her own destiny.

Lausanne, Friday
DRUMMER Bill Berry of the rock group REM had surgery for a brain
haemorrhage today and had good prospects for recovery, according to
staff at the main hospital of Lausanne.
The band's world tour was interrupted on Wednesday after Berry, 36,
left the stage in the Swiss city, complaining of a severe migraine
headache.
''The current REM tour will naturally be postponed for the foreseeable
future,'' said Warner Brothers Records, ''but Berry is in good hands and
good spirits and is expected to make a full and speedy recovery.''
The company said Berry would spend the next week to 10 days
recuperating in Switzerland and should be able to resume drumming
normally in two to three weeks.
''The operation proceeded normally and without complication,'' said a
statement by neurosurgeons. ''The post-operative prospects are
favourable.''
REM postponed concerts planned for today and tomorrow in Zurich and
later ones in France and the Netherlands.
Tonight it was expected that the group's two shows scheduled for the
SECC, Glasgow, on April 16 and 17, would go ahead, but a spokeswoman
said that if they had to be cancelled or rescheduled, the 16,000 people
who had bought tickets would have their money returned.

YOU don't have to be a balaclava-clad fanatic to feel that foxhunting
is not sport. You only have to listen to a man with a face like a
well-skelped bum bark on about the spectacle, the tradition, the colour,
in a bathetic attempt to conceal the true emotions heaving in the
excited breasts of the view-hallooers. It's a country tradition, they
bray. So was incest. But of course we don't believe in that any more.
Why are they ashamed to admit they get off on the thrill of the blood?
Others are not. They could give up chasing innocent animals and invent a
sport in which two men, preferably brain-damaged, climb into a ring and
punch each other to a pulp. They could call it boxing.
Far be it from me to offer the braying redcoats excuses for their
depraved idea of fun. But instead of pretending they are merely doing a
kindness in culling the fox population by setting slavering hounds on
exhausted and petrified animals, they could point to the legitimacy, the
popularity, of that other blood sport.
There is no moral equivalence here. I don't equate killing a fox for
fun, or playing football with a hedgehog, with the indecency of a
spectator sport which involves maiming for money. Boxing is the more
obscene. A fox might escape.
And I don't believe John McFall was wrong to peel away all the
ludicrous excuses used to justify foxhunting. I just find it oddly
dispiriting that there is no queue of concerned people trying to outlaw
an event in which two people attempt to bludgeon each other senseless.
In boxing the losers are always in the ring. The only winners are
those who profit from the debasement of two human beings. Those who pay
to dress up and cheer on the vile spectacle are complicit in the
obscenity.
Those who walk away with their senses intact and their bank balances
swollen bigger than the brains of the combatants will tell you that
banning it will drive it underground. What they mean is that the grubby
squillions they make from TV rights would disappear.
Boxing is organised physical abuse. But let's hear it for the argument
from all those socially-concerned promoters about how it helps poor
black and white youngsters out of the gutter. That is an appalling
conceit. It avoids the logical conclusion of the ascent which involves
falling punch-drunk back into the gutter when the bruised brains start
to leak.
There was a letter in the Guardian this week from an unemployed
graduate. He did not want boxing banned. Don't you understand, he said,
that there are only three ways out of poverty for poor working-class
youths? Education, criminality, and boxing. Is that enough to justify it
then?
Right now the latest stricken boxer, Gerald McClellan, remains
critically comatose in intensive care. The president of the World Boxing
Council joins the promoter of the fight that floored him in praising the
British Board of Control's medical regulations. The rules which led to a
team of trauma specialists stabilising the boxer at the ringside before
whipping him off to a neurological unit.
What is this about? Are we so genuinely morally confused that we can
empathise with bushy-tailed vermin, show outrage at the traffic of
watery-eyed calves going off to be chopped up into veal cutlets, yet
accept the trade in poor youths to feed the bloody appetites of those
who come to witness them pouring merciless energy into each other's taut
bodies and aching faces?
The British Medical Association continues to produce evidence on the
permanent brain and eye damage boxers suffer in fights and training. No,
it insists, boxing has not become less dangerous as a result of the
measures introduced by the British Board of Control. These, remember,
were forced on it after Michael Watson was knocked into a coma. He was a
spectator at last week's title fight. His ringside seat was a
wheelchair.
It points to the long-term damage boxing does to brains, citing
reports that more than 50% of boxers will suffer irreparable damage
which takes 20 years to emerge after their last bout: ''Acute and
chronic injury to both brain and eye continue to occur in both amateur
and professional boxers and as such the activity cannot be justified on
health and safety grounds as a legitimate sport.''
And here's a surprise: the boxing authorities decline to co-operate
with the BMA in setting up studies of injured boxers. You betcha.
Yet a neurosurgeon has discovered that the power of a boxer's punch
can be the equivalent of being hit by a 12lb wooden mallet travelling at
20 miles an hour.
So where, then, were the deeply concerned protesters demonstrating
against the degrading organised abuse of the human spirit at title
fights? Gone to Shoreham every one I expect.
What a funny country.

''BUT monsieur, no-one is spending money on art because they fear the
socialist Jospin may win!''
Robert Schmit, Paris's leading dealer in late nineteenth- and early
twentieth-century paintings, was seriously worried as he stood in front
of an array of important canvases in his gallery near the Place de la
Concorde -- a Picasso self-portrait, a Toulouse-Lautrec bar sketch, a
vibrant Normandy beach scene by Boudin.
''Rich French people traditionally stop spending on luxuries like art
during the months before an election. Some now think Jospin may win. He
has said he will dissolve the national assembly and we'll be in for
seven more years of socialism!'' said Mr Schmit.
Highly irrational it may be, but the French presidental election is
anything but boring. Mr Jospin's extraordinary surge in popularity in
the few weeks since he announced he was running put him on a par in
polls last week with the two Gaullist candidates, Jacques Chirac and
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur.
A shift in public opinion, meanwhile, has transformed the race between
those two right-wing competitors for the Elysee. Yesterday two polls put
Mr Chirac, for months considered a loser, ahead of Mr Balladur. Mr
Chirac's supporters have at last dared to hope, while Mr Balladur's have
begun to panic.
Realising that his popularity had dropped in the wake of an illegal
phone-tapping scandal involving his offices, after the comic affair of
the US spies expelled from France, and out of sheer boredom, the
Balladurian troops rallied and attacked last week.
Like the Balladur-Chirac confrontation itself, the battle appalled
voters like Mr Schmit, contemplating a right-wing once assured of easy
victory, now shaking itself apart in a quarrel born not of ideology but
of personal ambition.
In the muted tones which characterise the conflict -- in an abusrd
pretext of loyalty, neither Mr Balladur nor Mr Chirac ever names the
other in public -- the Prime Minister said last week that Mr Chirac's
plan for reducing unemployment had been incompetently calculated and
would inevitably ruin the state.
Worse, Mr Balladur said Mr Chirac's policies would weaken the franc.
As a strong franc has been the backbone of the economic policy of every
French government since 1983, that was about the rudest thing he could
possibly have said.
Mr Chirac's troops promptly snorted in retaliation: yesterday, Alain
Madelin, the Minister for Trade and a Chirac lieutenant, signed a full
frontal attack in Le Figaro, the thinking conservatives' paper, against
Nicolas Sarkozy, Minister for the Budget and spokesman for Mr Balladur.
Mr Madelin repudiated the charge of economic incompetence across half
a page. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Chirac general Alain Juppe,
meanwhile, accused Mr Balladur of hitting below the belt. The
accusations of incompetence were worse, he said, than anything they had
ever done in the heat of battle to the Communists or the Socialists.
As there is virtually nothing to differentiate Mr Balladur's politics
from Mr Chirac's, both have started brushing up their images -- Mr
Chirac as man of change, bullish with a populist touch, Mr Balladur as
the candidate of ''reasonable hope'' as General de Gaulle once put it,
cautious and serious-minded. Or ''immobile'' in the vocabulary of the
Chirac camp, qualified as ''irresponsible'' by the Balladurians. No
wonder Mr Jospin, with virtually no programme and a diminished and
demoralised party behind him, is prospering.
Meanwhile, the less influential candidates are making promises and
trading insults. Jean-Francois Hory, leader of the small left-wing
party, Radical, performed an act many considered treacherous by stepping
forward as candidate, thus threatening Mr Jospin's fragile recovery.
Polls, however, credit him with no more than 1% of votes.
The extreme right wing continues to consolidate its position.
Jean-Marie Le Pen of the National Front is still credited with around
10% of votes, despite a recent murder committed by National Front
members which he refused to condemn -- a group of men sticking up
posters in Marseille shot dead a 17-year-old immigrant youth, and
pleaded they acted in self-defence.
With the National Front stable, less obviously racist nationalist
opinion continues to prosper thanks to Philippe de Villiers, an
independent candidate of the far right, more acceptable to middle-class
voters than Mr Le Pen and credited with a similar score.
The Communist Party's candidate Robert Hue, described last week by Mr
Le Pen as a garden gnome, is still in there with around 7%. Only in May,
when it's all over, will people return to serious business, like buying
art.

ELLEN Jameson sweeps an expressive hand and says she fancies a cottage
on Loch Lomond or an apartment in a Scottish castle. Husband Derek gives
a rumbling response in cockney which, loosely translated, means he would
settle for a flat across the street from Broadcasting House at Queen
Margaret Drive in Glasgow.
Either way, the Jamesons will soon be heading north, not only to find
themselves a place to live but to bring their popular late-evening radio
show which will blaze a trail in the BBC's new strategy of dispersing
national programmes from London.
As from April 3 The Jamesons, which attracts up to a million people on
Radio Two between 10.30 and midnight from Monday to Thursday, will come
from BBC Scotland, while retaining its national perspective.
Local staff are being recruited for a show which will run for at least
a year on a budget of #700,000 -- produced in the modern manner by an
independent company, Unique Broadcast, in which Noel Edmonds is a major
shareholder.
For Ellen Jameson it is a return to the city where she was born and
where she started her career in broadcasting in the 1960s.
But if the logic of the move north raises confusion, at a time when
Scots are alleging a diminution of BBC Scotland's own role, the Jamesons
themselves are in no doubt about the wisdom of it.
''I have always taken the view that the world doesn't end at
Watford,'' says Derek, the poor kid from London's East End who rose to
become something of a legend as a Fleet Street editor. ''But this came
about when John Birt, the Director-General, started asking why
everything should come from London. Why indeed?
''When they came to ask if we would be prepared to take the programme
to Scotland we said we would be very happy to do so. I think it is a
wonderful idea to produce a big national radio show from Glasgow.
Nothing like this has been done before. And if we make a success of
this, it could be the start of more programmes going out of London.''
''It is very exciting,'' says the glamorous Ellen, ''to think of The
Jamesons becoming a focal point in Scotland. It will still be a national
programme but it will reflect the fact of where we are. For example, if
we are discussing medical matters, the experts will now come from
Scottish hospitals and not from St Thomas's.''
But what about the inconvenience for guests, who could so easily drop
into Broadcasting House at Langham Place, London? ''If they can't be in
Glasgow, it is so easy nowadays to talk down the line to people,'' Ellen
explains. ''The technology is now in place for us to see them on video
links.''
For all their enthusiasm, however, the Jamesons, whose hallmark is the
informality of a husband and wife welcoming guests to their own
fireside, will have to adapt to a much more demanding schedule.
At present they have the comfortable routine of spending week nights
at their central London pied-a-terre, walking the short distance to
Broadcasting House around 9pm for a 10.30 start. They know the rough
outline of their programmes a week in advance but, apart from Derek's
nightly introduction and the menu of events, nothing is written down.
Spontaneously they ramble on, chatting to guests in the studio and on
the phone, discussing, challenging, arguing. When Derek decides to
bumble a bit, Ellen is there with a woman's logic to pull him into line,
just like a husband and wife would do. Therein lies the secret.
''And when we make a mistake,'' says Derek, ''we just laugh it off and
take it all in our stride.''
There is the odd emotional moment, as happened recently when Derek was
reading the newspaper headlines from the first editions. At the story of
Jill Phipps, the demonstrator who died under the wheels of a truck,
Derek broke down and wept. Ellen took over until he had recovered.
When he was interviewing a Dunkirk veteran, the pair of them began to
weep together. Indeed Derek was even known to shed tears in his Fleet
Street days, when he was editor of the Daily Express and the News of the
World.
It is no doubt a compassionate streak dating back to his own deprived
childhood of the 1930s when he admits to having begged for food on the
streets of London. (As opposed to the essential nature of that plight,
however, he has grave misgivings about the motive of beggars on the
street today.)
When the evening's work is over at the midnight pips, Derek and Ellen
walk back to that London pad, let the adrenalin subside over a cup of
tea (Ellen is a reformed alcoholic), read a little and get to bed around
2am. By Friday they are back at their permanent base on the south coast,
near Brighton.
MATTERS will change drastically in April. Instead of London, the
Monday journey will take them to Gatwick Airport and a flight to
Glasgow. The production company has found premises in the Park district
of the city but the Jamesons will, of course, transmit their show from
the BBC studios at Queen Margaret Drive.
After four nights at their Scottish base, it will be back south to
their Brighton home for the weekend.
For Ellen, now 45, it will bring back memories of her childhood in
Dennistoun and school days at Dollar Academy and Lawside Academy,
Dundee. The peripatetic existence, which also took her to the Far East,
was due to her father's career in the RAF.
She was back home, however, in time for her first job with the pop
pirate ship Radio Scotland, before it was outlawed in the 1960s. As
Ellen Frazer Beattie, she had her own request programme, in the days of
disc jockeys like Jimmy Mack, Stewart Henry -- and Richard Park, now at
Capital Radio in London and the man who bought the Jamesons' house in
Maida Vale when they moved to Brighton two years ago.
When Ellen married journalist Gavin Petrie they moved to London where
she worked on magazines like Woman's Own. Her journalism extended to
writing a book about singer David Essex, as well as appearing briefly in
his film That'll Be The Day.
Meanwhile Derek, who is 20 years her senior, survived the poverty of
his early years to become a messenger at Reuters, encouraged to go to
night school by a Scottish editor, Tony Cole from Falkirk. The Scot then
gave him a job as a reporter and set him on his way to fame and some
fortune at the top end of Fleet Street.
There were hiccups on the way, as when he found himself out of work
and broke at 55, after a libel action against the BBC which would have
been a victory if the crippling costs had not ruined his finances.
Generously, the corporation then gave him a job!
His colourful reputation in journalism includes the fact that, as the
man who launched the Daily Star in 1978, he inflicted newspaper bingo on
the British public.
A widower but married again, with four children from his two
marriages, Derek met Ellen as a Fleet Street colleague and embarked on a
passionate love affair. At 65, he and the third Mrs Jameson are set for
a new phase in an eventful career.
As a nation which complains about everything being centralised in
London, it would be churlish to do anything but offer a welcoming hand
to a partnership which is guaranteed to enliven the Scottish scene.

A BULL mastiff of a man, fortysomething Wayne hits the Garage stage
running -- displaying all the barrel-chested, vein-bulging intensity of
his recent champion Henry Rollins. Unlike the maliloquent Rollins,
however, Kramer's visceral rage is reserved for an incendiary display of
high-octane guitar virtuosity replete with an expressionist array of
guitar-hero histrionics.
The former MC5 stalwart, here to promote his recent solo album The
Hard Stuff sports a minimalist's peroxide crop and black T-shirt image
-- imagine Jean-Paul Gautier on steroids -- completing a well-drilled
power trio with a rock-solid base player and an inventive drummer.
This compact combo provides equally adept at the scorched-earth
riffing of Crack In The Universe the wah-wah soaked extemporisation of
Realm Of The Pirate Kings and even cornball theatrics on the New York
Dolls-style ballad Junkie Romance. Kramer's guitar provides the
signature sound however, his patent, with Stratocaster used as both
power tool and rapier blade.
It's that proto-punk past that rears its snarling head on a blistering
version of the MC5 anthem Kick Out The Jams -- Kramer rising to the
occasion with larynx-seering passion. This proves to be the highlight of
a set that descends into repetitive jamming in stark contrast with the
earlier trimmed-too-the-bone coherence.

SUNDAY night, and with a rattle and groan of ancient chariot-wheels
Radio 3 drags out of the closet the latest fruit of BBC Radio's
long-term collaboration with Theater Works of Los Angeles, an
organisation which encourages Hollywood-based actors to maintain their
work in other media, including radio. Now, on the whole, the Theater
Works connection seems to me an excellent thing; indeed if it had done
nothing but produce that tremendous courtroom drama of McCarthyism, Are
You Now Or Have You Ever Been, or Sharon Gless's superb award-winning
performance in Marsha Norman's Night Mother, it would have justified
itself. Nor do I have any problem with the sound of Americans doing
Shakespeare; on the contrary, almost any form of articulate spoken
English seems to me, nowadays, to bring a fresher and sharper sound to
the verse than the narrow vowels and bland softened consonants of modern
BBC English.
But by the time this latest production -- a big two hour version of
Shakespeare's Julius Caesar featuring Stacy Keach as Brutus and Richard
Dreyfuss as Mark Antony -- had ground to a halt in the mud and dust of
Philippi, I was beginning to wonder whether the bard is a suitable case
for radio treatment at all, so muffled, strained, and claustrophobic was
the whole effect of the production. It was as if the recording had begun
with the murky whisperings of the conspirators -- Keach's virile Brutus
murmuring like Charlton Heston in a moment of quiet emotion, John De
Lancie's slightly edgier Cassius replying in kind -- and had never
managed, thereafter, to lift its head and expand its chest; Dreyfuss,
letting slip the dogs of war, sounded more tearful than angry, and the
baying Roman mob of the ''friends, Romans, countrymen'' sequence were
addressed at conversational pitch, and responded like a roomful of fans
at a fund-raiser.
Perhaps the actors were simply trying too hard to tone down the drama
for radio purposes. Perhaps the director Martin Jenkins had difficulty,
away from his London studio, in creating the audible sense of scale and
public space necessary for Shakespeare's big political scenes. Perhaps
they were deliberately aiming for a chamber-drama effect; certainly the
intimate scene in Brutus's tent, with the fierce Brutus-Cassius quarrel
was strikingly powerful, and the republican passion of the conspirators
in the early part of the play, has never made more sense.
But this Julius Caesar came as a powerful reminder that however great
a poet Shakespeare was, poetry is only one component of the drama. which
depends on the unique power of the verse to lift and energise the
actors' bodies, to transform into action. I have heard radio productions
-- Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet comes to mind -- that managed to capture
this process, through a clever use of space and movement around the
microphone. But Jenkins' Julius Caesar was not one of them; and I have
to admit that I got more pleasure last week, from another product of the
Theater Works collaboration -- a sprightly version of Neil Simon's
Jewish-kid-growing-up-in-the-thirties play Brighton Beach Memoirs,
broadcast in two parts -- at 1am on a Sunday, if you are interested in
catching the second instalment tonight -- on the BBC World Service.
Nothing here to match Shakespeare of course; but a neat, clever domestic
script with an intimate narrative voice, perfectly designed for radio,
and presenting no production problems at all.
No such luck earlier on a Saturday evening though, when weary
travellers or revellers returning home, and tuning in to Radio 4 for a
bit of civilised entertainment, are in future to be hit with a horrible
innovation called Murder Before Midnight, a 90 minute drama slot of
mayhem and misery about as suitable for a late Saturday evening as a
medical programme specialising in detailed descriptions of fatal
diseases.

IN the programme Michael Duke, the Irish director, notes: ''The
politicians claim Ireland is moving into a new era . . . but the lives
made and broken by the war carry on, and their stories will need to be
told many times before wounds begin to heal.''
This is a story of four Belfast women by Aberdonian playwright Rona
Munro and in the powerful production by Dundee Rep Theatre Company it is
an urgent and riveting one. Munro's narrative is built on cryptic clues,
hesitant hints, and inane domestic details but it is rock solid none the
less and the events unfold across two acts with thrilling compulsion.
Bristling with popular culture references, its context is a political
one, with buses burning on the Falls Road offstage, but the focus is
intensely personal, with the spotlight falling on the emotional
landscape, as it does quite literally during the various monologues when
the women are one by one isolated from the action to reveal their inner
thoughts.
The initial mystery of the young girl Deirdre, who abruptly enters the
close-knit lives of Nora, her daughter Cassie, and their neighbour
Marie, intensifies and has various ramifications before resolving itself
and the enigma of Deirdre's entrance is intensified by Duke, who gives
her a ghostly echo, a highly effective device.
The cast revel in Munro's sumptuous dialogue, bringing assured humour
and energy to the roles. Alice Bree is sulkily magnificent as Deirdre,
Maggie MacRitchie brings great restrained dignity to the role of the
deceived wife Marie, while the exchanges between the excellent Veronica
Leer (Cassie) and Eileen Nicholas (Nora) are by turns hilarious and
chokingly moving.

THE tussle between the British Establishment and Mr Mohamed Al Fayed
is an undignified affair which should be resolved for the sake of all
concerned, and not least for the reputation of our country and its
commercial activities. Mr Al Fayed has had a considerable impact on
British business and politics. His takeover of the House of Fraser
stores group was accomplished against the bitter opposition of Lonrho
but was waved through by the Government after the most cursory
examination. A subsequent investigation by the Department of Trade and
Industry failed to challenge the deal but concluded that Mr Al Fayed had
misrepresented his assets and gave an account of his dealings which was
unreliable, untrue, and bogus. Mr Al Fayed's attempts to overturn this
judgment have failed, and the arguments about his character and
motivations have only been compounded by his allegations against Tory
MPs over the ''cash for questions'' issue and the resignations and
accusations which flowed from it.
All of this has been brought into sharp focus once more by the
decision of the Home Office to deny British citizenship to Mr Al Fayed
and his brother. The Fayeds are outraged and claim victimisation, yet
this issue raises larger questions about the nature of citizenship, and
more fundamentally the nature of influence and how it is wielded. Mr Al
Fayed is a particularly difficult case. A Government Minister allowed
him to buy a significant British business and a Government report made a
devastatingly critical account of his business dealings. Yet Mr Al Fayed
has never been convicted of anything. Should he be allowed British
citizenship? Citizenship is not, after all, a guarantee of probity.
Well-heeled people who wish to leave Hong Kong will have their
applications for citizenship regarded favourably, though the poor need
not apply.
As ever with British society, it is the habitual recourse to secrecy
which cloaks issues in uncertainty and denies the basic requirement of
justice being seen to be done. The Home Office does not talk about
individual cases and does not give reasons for its decisions. This is
intolerable. Reasons for refusal should be given as a matter of simple
courtesy, if not humanity. If the subject does not object to those
reasons being known, there is no earthly reason why they should not.
Transparency is healthy; secrecy allows this issue, and others like it,
to fester.

Complaints are on the increase, so Margaret Hughes turned detective.
EATING out is a sociable affair. Good food, good wine, good friends,
and pleasing surroundings are all part and parcel of the whole
experience. However, what about those times when you have to do without
the friends, perhaps because you are on business or going on holiday
alone?
Do lone diners get poor service and dimly-lit tables in corners? More
important, do women dining alone have to put up with patronising waiters
and sympathetic stares from strangers? Or, indeed, as I have witnessed
over the past few months, glares because I was taking up a table for
two!
As more and more women find that travelling is a necessity of work,
women eating alone in restaurants is becoming less of a rarity. But are
they treated as well as the businessman at the next table?
A recent survey into the needs of women travelling alone, carried out
by London's Athenaeum Hotel, found that more than three in four women
complained of receiving poorer service, and that two out of three would
rather eat in their bedrooms than dine in the hotel restaurant.
I have travelled extensively on my own for work, and stayed in hotels
in several countries and, determined to enjoy my food in pleasing
surroundings, have usually eaten in restaurants rather than order from
the room-service menu.
I have to say that I have never been treated badly, or felt that the
service I received was any better or worse than anyone else's. But given
that there are many women who do feel the need to make themselves
prisoners in their bedrooms, I decided to test the theory and chose
Jules' Bar &amp; Restaurant in Glasgow's Forte Crest Hotel as the guinea-pig
venue.
The restaurant is directly opposite the main entrance to the hotel, so
there was no problem with having to wind my way down empty corridors,
which is a bonus; hotel corridors are not the most women-friendly of
environments.
The restaurant manager welcomed me warmly, and promptly showed me to
my table. Thankfully, it was not stuck in a corner of the room, but
situated so that I could have a good view of everyone else.
I had not booked, but was interested to find that the table was set
for only one person, as were several others. This restaurant is
obviously used to lone diners.
The menu is based around American-style dishes. Starters include
Caesar salad, mussels in white wine, and Philadelphia pepper-pot soup.
The soup was sensational. The waitress had described it as a soup made
with peppers that were hot -- an understatement!
When it arrived it was a piping-hot broth of red, green, and yellow
peppers, as well as spicy peppercorns. I adore hot and spicy food, so
this was a treat, but I did feel that had I eaten the whole bowl, my
tastebuds would have been unable to distinguish anything else for the
rest of the evening.
Main courses include steaks, Cajun chicken, and salmon. I opted for
the marinated salmon served with an Arran mustard sabayon. I had
expected the main course to come with vegetables, but it did not. The
waitress explained that only some of the dishes have veg, and that since
my chosen dish was rather large, I probably wouldn't need any. However,
I chose a mixed salad anyway.
The dish consisted of strips of thinly sliced salmon served under a
hot mustard sauce. When I had scraped the sauce off the salmon, it had
that reassuring orangey-pink colour and was, for the most part,
succulent and its delicate flavour came through well.
However, some slices were a little undercooked, and parts were still
raw. The grainy mustard sauce was a little mild and lacked tanginess.
The dish had been browned under a grill, and had unfortunately acquired
an unappealing skin.
It was quite a big serving, which was just as well -- the salad was
tiny. Given that this is a US-style restaurant, I had expected a huge
salad, but this was a small bowl of shredded lettuce leaves and a few
other salad vegetables. It was already dressed -- this time I was happy
with the dressing, but quite often I prefer my salad undressed, so I
would like to have been given the choice.
The dessert menu included the always popular sticky toffee pudding,
creme brulee and Haagen Dazs ice cream selection, but I chose banana
cream pie. Being a big desserts fan, I looked forward to this course
with some relish. I was expecting a huge pudding, worthy of anything the
US can produce, but again the portion was small.
I have only ever eaten banana cream pie in the States, where it was a
custard-based delight with bananas layered through it and topped with
huge swirls of whipped cream. This was more like a cheesecake, with a
tiny sprinkling of banana and the cream served on the side. It was
enjoyable -- it just was not what I had expected.
The wine-list was not extensive, but leaned towards the New World
variety, with the house white being Californian. I was slightly irked by
the fact that the waitress assumed I would not be drinking wine and
hastily removed the glasses before I had even had the chance to peruse
the list. As it happens, a cold and profusion of paracetamol did mean I
was having to forgo the wine, but I would have liked the opportunity to
tell her so.
There is a choice of teas or coffee, cappuccino, espresso, or
cafetiere. I opted for the cafetiere, but it was very bitter. If it had
been served straight into a cup I would have guessed that it had lain
too long on a hotplate.
The service was excellent throughout the meal, although the restaurant
manager and waitresses must have asked a dozen times if everything was
all right! If I looked uncomfortable I was not aware of it, because I
actually felt very comfortable and not at all intimidated by being there
alone.
This was a very friendly restaurant within a Forte Crest hotel, which
has a policy of ensuring that lone women travellers are made to feel
safe and welcome. While the staff were very keen to ensure that I was
enjoying my food, I found it amusing rather than overbearing.
While I was perfectly happy to eat in Jules' Bar, I have to admit that
if I were travelling to a strange city, I would not feel happy leaving
the safety of my hotel to find somewhere to eat. A quick survey of some
women friends who have to travel alone for work purposes confirmed this.
The majority agreed that eating alone is made slightly more bearable by
the company of a good book, but that striding out to find a restaurant
is something they would rarely do.
RECOMMENDED RESTAURANTS
One Devonshire Gardens, 1 Devonshire Gardens, Glasgow. Tel: 0141 339

There is an extensive wine list, and a chat with the brilliant
sommelier Johnny Walker will leave you gasping with envy at his
knowledge.
Puddings are always memorable. The lemon tart is superb -- once tasted
it is never forgotten.

lightly smoked chicken and a mountain of salad leaves and vegetables.
Desserts include the ubiquitous caramel shortcake, and apple covered
in cinnamon and wrapped in pastry for a memorable way to end a meal.

She once rocked the cradle and she'll the same to any marriage. Allan
Laing wonders why they can't all be like his wife's mum.
THE writer of this profile (a notorious coward who knows on which side
his marital bread is buttered) would like to state, for the record, that
his wife's mother is sweet, gentle, and kind to animals. She is an
absolute gem; an angel. In fact, a nicer woman you could not meet in a
month's walking. They broke the mould when they made her. There is no,
repeat no, suggestion that she is anything like the type of person
portrayed in the ensuing story.
There is a school of thought, what you might call the Les Dawson
Theory, which suggests that mothers-in-law are direct descendants of
Attila the Hun, Adolf Hitler, and Robert Maxwell. They could, it is
often argued, teach Saddam Hussein a trick or three.
Now, Winnie Ewing is a Scottish Nationalist, a Euro-MP, and an
altogether formidable lady. But she is also a mother-in-law. This last
fact became strikingly apparent earlier this week when she caused, well,
the mother-in-law of all stooshies within her political party. For
reasons best known to herself, she chose to rattle a very old skeleton
in the closet of Ms Roseanna Cunningham, a charming lady who is not a
mother-in-law but who was, until that moment, a likely SNP candidate in
the forthcoming Perth and Kinross by-election.
During an unusually eventful selection meeting, Mrs Ewing, 65,
apparently accused Ms Cunningham of breaking up the first marriage of
her daughter-in-law, the MP Margaret Ewing, some 20 years ago. It seems
that in the mid-seventies Margaret split up from her husband, SNP
activist Donald Bain. Shortly after the separation Mr Bain embarked upon
a relationship with Ms Cunningham. Following her subsequent divorce,
Margaret married again -- to Winnie's son, Fergus. This sounds very much
like the plot from an old episode of Dallas which, when you consider the
name involved, is perhaps not entirely surprising. It left Ms Cunningham
close to tears and provoked her controversial decision to withdraw from
the selection process.
If nothing else, Winnie's outburst proved that mothers-in-law have
exceedingly long memories. Not to mention, of course, a spectacular
vindictive streak. What must always be borne in mind when discussing
your mother-in-law (naturally, behind her back) is the fact that you,
male or female, are not good enough for her child. You never were and
you never will be.
Not only have you stolen her loved one away from her without so much
as a by-your-leave, but you are also persistently perpetrating the most
unspeakable acts upon her/him in the privacy of the matrimonial bedroom.
To her the marriage was not like losing a child, it was like gaining a
no-good, low-down, waster as an in-law. Once you accept this warped
logic then you will begin to understand the complex psychological
monster which nature created and called the mother-in-law.
Mothers-in-law are a joke. In fact, they are a thousand jokes. The
aforementioned Mr Dawson based a career upon them. It is not known
exactly where or when the mother-in-law joke was invented but perhaps it
goes back to when Adam was a boy. Then again, perhaps not. Adam, lucky
man, didn't have one. Still, to continue with the biblical theme, it is
surely safe to assume that Cain made a few mother-in-law cracks after
his marriage. It is a truth, is it not, that we always make light of the
things that terrify us most.
Your mother-in-law can reduce you to a quivering, nervous, wreck with
a few well-chosen words down the phone line. They are: ''I'm coming to
stay for a week.'' This, as you will note, is not a request. It is a
statement, not even of intent, but of fact. Your view on the matter is
of no import whatsoever. And when she arrives it is her bounden duty to
nag you and all you stand for. It is no more than you deserve, of
course. After all, you still haven't painted that bathroom and you're
still using gravy granules when you're perfectly capable of making your
own sauce. At first you will rage against this unwarranted criticism
but, in the end, you will admit defeat. Life is too short to disagree
with the mother-in-law from hell.
In any case, you are on a hiding to nothing. You are alone. Curiously,
the unwelcome appearance of your mother-in-law has coincided with a
sudden outbreak of silence from your partner. This, of course, is quite
out of character since your partner is normally so supportive. So what
is it? Laryngitis? No, it is simply the survival instinct. This is your
partner's mother, and mother (as he or she has probably discovered
through the bitter experience of childhood) knows best and always gets
her own way.
Naturally, you are a sad disappointment to your mother-in-law. But
that other chap your wife used to go out with before she met you; you
never met him did you? Gosh, he was ever such a nice boy. Great job,
smashing car, lovely house. And so handsome! It is around this point
that you decide that no court in the land could possibly convict you for
taking this virago's life.
And then, just when you think that matters can get no worse, they do.
You start a family. Mother-in-law is mother-in-law no longer. Now she is
a doting granny, an infinitely more dangerous beast. A species placed on
earth with the express purpose of telling you that you are bringing your
children up all wrong.
This is not at all funny. The national parenting help line,
Parentline, estimates that about 20% of its calls concern problems with
in-laws. The marriage guidance agency Relate reckons that in-laws are
well up in the top ten list of marital problems.
A recent survey of the most common complaints from mothers-in-law
listed them as: untidy houses, working wives, unironed shirts, frozen
food, too much telly for the children, poor table manners, and ''You
never write/phone/visit''. The same survey noted the most common
complaints from children-in-law. They included lending money and then
trying to influence how it is spent and going on at the grandchildren
and contradicting parental wisdom in the process. It is not recorded if
''You always write/phone/visit'' is among them.
Sadly, it seems that the mother-in-law's raison d'etre is to be a
thorn in your flesh, a nuisance, a pest, a pain in the posterior. It
might, however, be worth emphasising yet again that this writer's
mother-in-law is none of these things. She is a wonderful human being
and I will not hear a word said against her. She also reads The Herald.

Charlie Miller is at the cutting edge of international hair styling, a
fact which is being recognised next week in New York. What is the secret
of the Scottish crimper's success? Anvar Khan investigates
HAIRDRESSING is not a sign of weakness. The fluffy, Byzantine decor,
the pristine, Presbyterian minimalism of high-street salons promote the
idea that they are chiefly run by sensitive types. The beauty trade,
however, is not effeminate. And it is here that the Scots excel. Next
week, Edinburgh hairdresser Charlie Miller will receive the World
Masters Award in a ceremony in his honour in New York. Scottish
hairdressers are internationally venerated. But why?
For a start, Scottish stylists and cutters nearly always align
themselves with the great Celtic pioneers of science, art, and
technology. They identify with their initiative, their ingenuity, and
their bloody-mindedness. The Scots hairdresser cannot alienate his or
her national identity from his or her work. The Celtic psyche, they
maintain, has empowered them, and is entirely responsible for their
contribution to the front line of global hairdressing.
Kevin Graham, 39, has been a stylist with Michaeljohn in London for 13
years. His clients include Jim Kerr, Patsy Kensit, Sigourney Weaver,
Brooke Shields and Isabella Rossellini.
''There is a higher standard of consciousness in cutting in Scotland.
Scots feel they have to prove to the world that they are not teuchters,
and so strive for excellence.''
Michaeljohn salons do not actively recruit Scots, but their two top
stylists are both Scottish. ''It's a misconception that the Scots are
aggressive. It's just that the English are so reserved, especially in
the South-east. Some of the best hairdressers are Scottish, but the
founders of the best salons are East End Jews, such as Michael Rasser
(of Michaeljohn).''
Kevin insists that the Scots are highly creative folk. ''It's my own
personal philosophy that Scotland is a spiritual country, Glasgow more
so than Edinburgh. Edinburgh is similiar to the South-east.''
The biggest and brightest ambassador of Scottish hairdressing,
however, remembers a time when it was completely unhelpful to be born
outside the mecca of London.
''There was a turnover at the end of the seventies when Scots
hairdressers started to hit the headlines,'' explains Rita Rusk. ''Until
then, we tried to be taken seriously, but we were basically dismissed.''
The prime reason for the spotlight falling on Scottish crimpers, such
as Princess Di's pet stylist, Ayrshire-born Sam McKnight, may be partly
because they serve celebrities. But there's more to it than that:
''People in a smaller place try harder,'' explains Rusk, ''they have a
greater tenacity. I did Greta Scacchi's and Vanessa Redgrave's hair when
they were in Scotland, and everyone in my salon squealed with
excitement. In Scotland, there's no Fergie. Naomi Campbell doesn't drop
by. London salons have more opportunity to become a household name.''
There are Scottish hairdressers who determine a more insidious reason
as to why they are successful in such a high-profile trade. Denise Adam,
the woman who dressed Fergie's bridal hair, explains: ''The Scots have
client discretion; not many of us blab. We thrive by working hard.
There's a wee bit of anger involved, that is, we're not British, we're
Scottish. I came to London to do session work. Not because I thought it
was the best place but because I wanted to know what was going on.
''I suspect there's been a change in the generations. I know for a
fact that out of 10 juniors, nowadays, only one will be dedicated. In
Scotland, with an apprenticeship, you had to want it, the whole family
were behind you.
''I'm very passionate about women. The suffragettes didn't finish the
job. There is the misconception that female hairdressers are just sex
with scissors, but Scotswomen have been tough enough to break through.
In a recent book called The Best of British, the women's section for
hairdressing had only three names -- Jennifer Shane, Rita Rusk, and
myself. All Scots.''
There are those who would accuse Scots who progress to England of
selling out. But you can only sell out if you have something which
others are willing to pay for. Linda Evans, PR for Toni and Guy says:
''Scots have the gift of the gab, they have great powers of
communication which is very important in establishing a client
relationship.''
The man most Scottish hairdressers cite as their greatest influence is
Brian Drumm of Edinburgh. He was at the vanguard of the Scottish
hairdressing movement and, some say, is generally responsible for the
infiltration of the business by Scots.
Drumm started out in the seventies, putting on shows all over the
world, including Wembley, for five years. His contemporaries were Irvine
Rusk and Charlie Miller. ''The people who were at the forefront then are
still there now,'' he says. In the early years, the Scots spent
thousands of pounds on showcasing their work, uplifting the show
environment to make them better; the English didn't. Rusk, Miller, and
Drumm once all chipped in to get Michael Parkinson as a compere.
''If someone walked along the street with a bob in the seventies it
was acclaimed as a marvellous haircut,'' says Drumm. ''The revolution
happened in the sixties. It took 10 years to get to Glasgow. Until then,
everyone had to go to London for clothes or a cut. I was lucky to be
there already.
''I had worked at a pumpmakers at John Brown's. When Sassoon came out
I just left the job and went to London. I lived with 10 people in the
one room. Then, people would work for nothing. I remember Kenny Dalglish
being interviewed on the telly, he had won everything under the sun --
109 caps, the European Cup. 'What's the most important thing in your
life?' he was asked. 'I'd have to say, my wife and my children, so as
not to upset them,' said Dalglish. 'But it's ma fitba'. If I look after
that everything else looks after itself.' I feel the same about
hairdressing.''
''The Scots are industrious people, Glaswegians have an industrial
background. Hairdressers are thorough and precise, not so much artists
as draughtsmen. They are engineers, very hard-working. Hairdressing is
very pretentious. Scots cut through the schmaltz.
''When we put on shows we had to be very aggressive, blase -- you have
to, to cut a diamond on somebody's head. We had to have a hard,
couldnae-care-less attitude. We put our money where our mouth was. Aged
23, in front of 3000 people you either sink or swim.''

THERE are two types of clothes shopper: those who relish spending
their Saturday afternoons rummaging through the rails of every shop in
Buchanan Street and those who hate it, but do so out of necessity. The
news that Racing Green, one of the major mail-order catalogue successes
of the nineties, is opening a shop in Buchanan Street in May, is welcome
therefore to both reluctant and habitual shoppers.
''We feel it is important to have a store in Glasgow,'' says a
spokesman, ''in order to meet our customers in the flesh. It's part of a
policy we're applying to major British cities to test retail
reactions.''
None of this means that the mail-order side of things is being scaled
down. Like J P Hartley searching the Yellow Pages for his beloved book
on fly-fishing, so the at-home shopper will still scan her RG catalogue
and pinpoint purchases of nonchalant, clever style with torpedo
accuracy, before she steps out of her front door. Alternatively she will
soon be able to join the hordes who can now add another shop to their
Saturday mornings spent dismantling piles of perfectly folded sweaters
in order to locate their size.
It is only three years since Racing Green launched its first
mail-order catalogue with a range of high quality fashion basics
strongly influenced by the casual dressed-down ethos that the Americans
call sportswear. The success of their top-stitched cotton T-shirts,
chinos, and wool/cashmere blazers, appealingly photographed in the
countryside and tightly edited in slim volumes, revealed the direction
of shopping in the nineties.
They introduced a new, affluent clientele to a way of shopping that
fitted into their hectic schedules, offering them casual clothes that
they didn't have to spend precious time traipsing around department
stores and collecting parking tickets to find.
The competition, though, is hotting up, with stores like Selfridges,
Harrods, Laura Ashley, and Next fine-tuning their mail-order business,
while offering a pre-season appetiser for those planning a new wardrobe.
Now retailers like House of Fraser, MaxMara, and Mulberry produce glossy
magazines that promote a distinct lifestyle, or social attitude -- as
with Benetton's Colors. Designers are slipping between mail-order pages
-- both Vivienne Westwood and Workers For Freedom design affordable
collections for the Littlewoods catalogue while Jasper Conran, Betty
Jackson, and English Eccentrics are just a few of those elegantly
packing their collections for Kingshill -- another recent success in
niche marketing.
In the face of up-market competition, many of the traditional
dial-a-dress catalogues have been sprucing up their design skills,
producing pretty sundresses, swimwear, and stylish tailoring at
competitive prices, then photographing the results on supermodels like
Carla Bruni and Karen Mulder in classy locations. In a home-shopping
industry predicted to be worth #6bn in 1995, improvements in product and
presentation will reap the rewards.

Patrick Laurence reports from Johannesburg how Nelson Mandela has made
an example of his former wife in his fight against corruption.
THE raid on the Soweto home of President Nelson Mandela's estranged
wife, Winnie, this week was a sequel to, and a consequence of, a
watershed policy speech by Mr Mandela to Parliament a fortnight earlier.
In his address Mr Mandela gave notice of his intention, and that of
the ANC-led Government of National Unity, to take tough action to excise
corruption and eradicate anarchy in South Africa.
The raid on Mrs Mandela's home, carried out by detectives of the
commercial unit of the South African Police Services, was undertaken
during an investigation into allegations that she had used her position
as a deputy minister to advance the fortunes of a building company.
She is alleged to have intervened in a bid to ensure the granting of
contracts to Professional Builders in return for a 50% shareholding for
her daughter, Zinzi, and a smaller share for her personal physician. The
combined total of the shares allocated to her ''proxies'' would have
given her control of the company, police said.
In his speech Mr Mandela warned that his government would deal with
corruption ''firmly and unequivocally, whoever may be involved''.
The raid sent a message to South Africa in general and the ranks of
the politically dominant ANC in particular: no-one is above the law and
no will escape investigation for alleged corruption, no matter how
exalted a position he, or she, occupies.
Apart from being Nelson Mandela's estranged wife and the mother of his
two daughters, Mrs Mandela is the president of the ANC Women's League, a
member of the ANC national executive committee and the Deputy Minister
of Art, Science, Technology and Culture.
Her radical oratory has won her grassroot support as a champion of the
poor. At the ANC's general conference in December Winnie Mandela won the
fifth most votes in elections for the 60-member national executive
committee. Ahead of her, in first and third positions, were two of her
closest political allies: former Transkei military ruler Bantu Holomisa
and former ANC Youth League president Peter Mokaba.
A penchant for controversy aside, Mr Holomisa and Mr Mokaba share
another trait with Mrs Mandela: populist oratory aimed at presenting
themselves as the champions of the poor and as the incorruptibles of the
''people's revolution'' against apartheid.
Mr Holomisa, who like Mrs Mandela is a deputy minister, attracted
public attention last month when he defiantly repudiated no less a
person than President Mandela for accusing Transkei police of defrauding
taxpayers of millions by tampering with the computer system controlling
their salaries.
Mr Mokaba had similarly become a target of accusing fingers when it
emerged that he paid himself an annual salary of #45,000 as the supremo
of the National Tourism Forum, which was partly funded by Sol Kerzner, a
casino mogul who has admitted that he paid #350,000 to a former Transkei
Prime Minister in a bid to secure a gambling monopoly.
Mr Mokaba's payment to himself of a second salary, over and above the
#3000 per month that he earns as a member of parliament, appeared to be
in contravention of the ANC code of conduct, which demands public
disclosure from the outset of all extra earnings.
The raid on Mrs Mandela's home and the office of her organisation, the
Co-ordinated Anti-Poverty Programme, came on the heels of a finding by
impartial legal investigators that another ANC leader, Allan Boesak, had
''substantially enriched himself'' with funds from Danish donors.
Dr Boesak -- who was handpicked by Mr Mandela to lead the ANC in the
Western Cape -- was forced to withdraw as South Africa's
ambassador-designate after the findings were published.
Mrs Mandela's alleged abuse of her office for personal gain came as
she was on a tour of West Africa in defiance of an order by President
Mandela to remain in South Africa for a high-level ANC meeting on a
crisis in the ANC Women's League. The as yet unresolved crisis came to a
head last month when 11 executive members, led by Adelaide Tambo, widow
of former ANC president Oliver Tambo, resigned in protest against Mrs
Mandela's ''undemocratic tendencies''.
There was a second major theme in Mr Mandela's speech to Parliament.
His pledge to check anarchical behaviour by militants, particularly the
taking of hostages, the occupation of public buildings and the
blockading of roads. It was not a mere verbal nod in the direction of
law and order.
Mandela warned: ''The small minority in our midst will meet its match
in the government we lead and the people who put that government into
office. They must know that we are not afraid of struggle. We are, after
all, a product of confrontation and struggle.''
On the weekend of February 25 and 26 Mandela was as good as his word.
First crack policemen and soldiers were sent to Transkei to counter a
mutiny by Transkei policemen who had blockaded important roads in the
territory. Resistance crumbled against the decisive intervention.
Then a special military task force was ordered to free a prison warden
who was held hostage by rebellious and armed prisoners in Port
Elizabeth. The tough action succeeded where coaxing and coddling had
earlier failed. The warden was freed and the revolt crushed.
These determined interventions were followed by Mandela's announcement
on February 27 that extra police, backed by soldiers, would be deployed
in trouble spots around the country to combat crime and curb political
violence.
One of the areas earmarked for intensified policing is the troubled
province of KwaZulu-Natal, where Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom
Party won a majority in last year's election.
To avoid exacerbation of the situation in KwaZulu-Natal Mr Mandela
will need a steady arm as well as a strong one.

Channel Four's Pot Night might not damage your health but it could
turn you into a zombie if you inhale it all, says Keith Bruce.
CHANNEL Four's ''adult'' television season the Red Light Zone may have
been granted more column inches, but it is tonight's theme night on
Michael Grade's network that should really be concerning any
right-thinking person. Pot Night, an evening of entertainment devoted to
the joys of smoking reefer, begins before the watershed with Miranda
Sawyer's cultural history of hemp A Leaf Through The Century and runs
through to some of the larger of the wee small hours. It is another sign
of acceptance for a habit that is now so far from being illegal in
practical terms that the law classifying it as a prohibited activity is
next to irrelevant.
But while the police barely bother to caution citizens for possession
and media figures argue the legal semantics between decriminalisation
and legalisation, the question of whether grass is really any fun at all
seems to have been overlooked. It is time that the truth was told about
hash. Time that the spurious mystique that surrounds it -- and makes
Channel Four's sleepy idea seem somehow daring, even in the ''been
there, done it, tie-dyed the T-shirt'' 90s -- was exploded.
The fact is that having a joint is at least as common as owning a Ford
Fiesta and considerably more socially acceptable than firing up a
Marlboro Light, but we still pretend that it is considered
''dangerous''. The trailer for tonight's themed evening actually gives
the game away, although the extent of the disaster is not acknowledged.
It drones on with the tired old piece of folklore that Queen Victoria
was known to indulge in hemp use. For a long time it was widely believed
to be an effective treatment for glaucoma, hash proselytisers have no
hesitation in pointing out. So what? For years medical science consisted
of bleeding people and applying leeches, but Western civilisation
appears to have grown through that phase.
The only real medical purpose for which it might be possible to
justify the prescription of a wee blaw is for adults so wound up and
hysterical they look like toddlers on E's (the kind you find on the side
of fast-food packets). For normal, relatively well-adjusted folk,
marijuana has one of two effects: it makes interesting people boring and
boring people pacemaker-stoppingly tedious. Someone who has been smoking
dope may fancy that they are still the same sharp, witty person they
were after their breakfast bowl of Shreddies and mug of Gold Blend but,
in fact, they have been transformed into a grey dullard. The speech may
not be slurred, the thinking may still be joined-up, but the
conversation is going nowhere. And nothing, but nothing, a dopehead
thinks is funny is actually funny. Cheech and Chong (on Channel Four
tonight) are proof of that.
This is not limited to the extreme cases, although there are plenty of
them. Almost everyone of my generation knows at least one person whose
entire life seems to revolve around smoking. He's rolling spliff the
minute he gets up and last thing at night, believes he can't function at
all without it, and chooses to ignore the fact that to all intents and
purposes he is not functioning at all. Ask what he's been doing and you
might just glean some information about a book he's read or a video he's
seen. Then he'll give you a line-by-line, or minute-by-minute account. A
wee toke isn't doing him any harm, it's just turning him into a vacuous
zombie on a regular basis.
But it's the sheer all-pervasiveness of the weed that makes its
unacknowledged brain-numbing effect so serious. Doctors, lawyers, and
computer software engineers are all smoking ganja. Very few of them have
dreadlocks, but the sacramental ritual around the little hand-carved
Indian box they keep their stash in and the meticulously torn Rizla
packet is just as devout as any Rastafarian. They are the people next to
you at work. It's not just daring bohemian types like theatre
technicians and dictionary editors who indulge, it is everyone.
Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland the other week, Strathclyde Police
Chief Constable Leslie Sharp made a point about the link between drug
use and other crime. He did so quite indiscriminately, bracketing
cannabis use alongside that of heroin. It was obviously transparent
nonsense. Most of the market for grass is among people who have their
car stereos and video recorders stolen, not the chaps doing the
stealing. They might own a chemist shop, but they would never dream of
breaking into one. The reason there is now serious talk about
decriminalisation is because politicians and policemen are skinning up
when they get home.
If that fact alone doesn't worry the young people of today, then there
is no hope for them. Sadly, many of them seem to have bought the rebel
myth of sensimilla as easily as their parents did, and show as much
enthusiasm for the weed as ever. If there ever was anything
revolutionary in the act of smoking hash -- and middle-class sixties
white kids were only picking up on a drug that had been common among
working-class blacks for decades -- it is long past its sell-by date in
the outrage stakes. When a US politician admits to inhaling to appear
more credible than the President, any underground culture connotations
still attached to the wacky baccy are clearly nonsensical.
My generation is probably too late to save. I've been offered a lump
of hash to chew just before curtain up at an opera in Edinburgh, and at
a party last weekend full of young twenty and thirtysomething
professionals there were people rolling joints in three corners of the
room. The door was in the other one, so I used it.
But surely today's pop kids should wise up to the fact that while it
might be inevitable that teenagers repeat the mischiefs of their mothers
and fathers, it really isn't very cool to be aping activities they're
still up to. The revolution will not be started by anyone holding a
spliff. That's why it won't begin in Holland. That's why our own
Government is quite happy to let the grass grow over its statutes.
That's probably why hash has stayed curiously inflation-proof at #15 a
quarter ounce. Placid, angst-free citizens don't Bogart that joint. They
just get the Munchies.

AT some point last year I was asked to contribute the best part of a
page to a national newspaper on a food about which I feel passionate --
I chose fish as my subject. Mind you, I was hard put to come to a
decision because I feel so passionately about a great many types of
foods -- chocolate, coffee, garlic, and olive-oil, lemon, and vanilla,
to name a very few.
But I opted for fish for several reasons. Chiefly because I always
think that people south of the Border (and, sadly, quite a number in
Scotland, too) need to be told or reminded that the seas around Scotland
and the waters that criss-cross Scotland produce the best and most
sought-after fish in the world. When I talk about fish, I am referring
to types of fish and shellfish.
But another reason is that fish is becoming a much more popular food
to eat. When we first started to run our home, here on Skye, as a small
hotel, the only type of fish I put on the menu in those days was salmon.
As a family we ate a much wider selection of fish, like herring, smoked
haddock, cod, and mackerel, for example, but I didn't think fish like
cod was worthy of the menu. I hadn't heard of fish like monkfish in
those far-off days, and although I blush to admit such a thing, I do
draw some comfort from the fact that neither had other hoteliers and
restaurant owners, because for the most part monkfish was just thrown
back when landed by the fishermen in their nets.
The exception was the monkfish used by unscrupulous frozen-foods
suppliers who thickly breaded chunks of monkfish and passed it off as
scampi -- which gives those of you who haven't eaten monkfish some idea
of its texture -- meaty and robust (tough, if its slippery membrane
hasn't been removed) and ideal to be combined with stronger flavours
than you might imagine would go well with fish.
These are changed days. Twenty-two years on and we have fish as one of
our two main courses each day of the nine months Kinloch trades as a
hotel, and the fish we use are salmon (wild, but we'll go into that on
another occasion!), hake, monk, halibut, turbot, seabass, and baby Dover
soles when we can get them, scallops, crabs and prawns, and squid.
We are told by various outpourings from the Government that we should
eat fish at least three times a week, preferably oily fish like salmon,
mackerel, herring. This is no hardship, either for us as a family, or
for the major number of our hotel guests. Our four children all love
fish and as I write I can't think of a fishy dish any of them don't
like.
When I do cooking demonstrations I always try to include a couple of
dishes. Although more and more people love to eat fish, there are still
far too many who are squeamish about preparing and cooking fish, and
there are still others, sad to say, for whom the very word fish is
synonymous with thick batter and the deep fryer. This is such a shame,
because fish is the natural fast food, fish is truly the original
convenience food. The reason is that fish takes so little time to cook
-- in fact fish is so easily ruined by overcooking. And when it comes to
the actual preparation so much is done by the fishmonger these days that
there is really very little to do.
I've mentioned that fish is fast food -- I realise that this term is
more widely associated with hamburgers but fish can form the main part
of such a very large repertoire of dishes. One of the best dishes is a
good fish pie, but I feel very strongly that this should be made with
all, or at any rate, the most part of the fish used being smoked fish.
The same goes for fishcakes. I always feel incensed that people part
with more money than they should for a salmon fishcake, with the
implication that a salmon fishcake is a cut above the rest, when as far
as my tastes go leftover salmon should be eaten cold. Rehashed into
fishcakes it imparts nothing much more than a faintly fishy flavour,
whereas fishcakes made with smoked fish are in an altgether different
class, taste-wise. And some of the milk in which the smoked fish --
haddock or cod -- is cooked can be mashed and beaten into the potatoes.
The one part about eating fish which tends to put people off is the
fear of finding a bone. This can be overcome by feeling the fish when
it's raw -- that way you can feel the bones and either slice them out or
tweak them out with your fingers or tweezers. If you can promise, hand
on heart, that there are no bones in whatever fishy dish you put before
your family and friends you should be able to win over the most wary
fish eater!
This fish soup is a cross between a stew and a soup. It is best eaten
in deep bowls or wide-brimmed soup-plates. It is a meal in a bowl, and
you can dress it up to make it more worthy of a party by including a
mixture of shellfish among the fish, or just make it for everyday eating
and use chunks of cod, or any other firm-fleshed fish. You can also vary
the vegetable content to suit what you can buy or grow in the garden --
any root vegetables go very well with fish. I made this a couple of days
ago for a supper party in our kitchen and the vegetable content was
onion, leek, carrot, celeriac, celery, Jerusalem artichoke, and the fish
was monkfish with some scallops thrown in to partify it.
Fish and Vegetable Chowder
This soup is best made then eaten straightaway -- if you make it in
advance, do not add tomato, fish, or shellfish until you are going to
reheat the soup. The fish will cook in the soup if simmered gently for
five minutes before serving.
Serves 6.
3 tbsp olive-oil; 1 onion, skinned and finely chopped; 2 sticks of
celery trimmed and very thinly sliced; 1 blade of fennel, trimmed and
chopped very small; A good pinch of saffron strands (rather than
powder); 1[1/2]lb (675g) mixed white fish, bones and skin removed, and
flesh cut into 1in/2.5cm chunks; 1 carrot, peeled and sliced into fine
matchsticks; 2 potatoes, peeled and chopped into small dice; 1[1/2]pts
(850ml) fish stock; Salt and freshly ground black pepper; [1/2]lb (225g)
shellfish, eg cooked mussels, prawns, squid sliced in circles; 2
tomatoes, skinned, de-seeded, and sliced into thin strips; 1 tbsp finely
chopped parsley.
Heat the oil in a large saucepan and add the prepared vegetables
except the strips of tomato. Cook the vegetables over a moderate heat,
stirring occasionally to prevent them sticking to the bottom of the pan,
for about 10 minutes. Pour in the fish stock, and simmer for 10 minutes.
Taste, season with salt and pepper and stir in the saffron. Before
serving, reheat the soup, add the fish, the shellfish and the tomato
strips, and simmer the soup very gently for five minutes. Just before
serving, stir the chopped parsley through the soup.

STANDING to one side of Nick Sargent's Act 1 set for Oscar Wilde's
comedy of deceit, there is a classical statue of a male nude with its
genitals prominent and a cocked hat on its head. A fig leaf is amusingly
drafted in for scenes of greater decorum, but for all Wilde's sexual
ambiguity, the cocked hat makes as pertinent a comment on the
playwright's world view.
For while his characters are invariably drawn from a privileged elite,
there is an ever present sense of subversion in his writing. Of course
he has his cucumber sandwiches and eats them -- he revels in the
decadence of the idle rich even while he is satirising the shallow
emotions of this ''age of surfaces''. Likewise the audience laughs as
much with as at his cynical and emotionally distant characters. And the
larger than life they are the better.
Here Victoria Hardcastle is the largest of the large; decked out in
costumes that keep her narrowly on the tasteful side of pantomime dame,
she plays Lady Bracknell like an ice maiden, her steely gaze appearing
to strike every member of the audience directly in the eye.
Apart from Kern Falconer's unexpectedly funny minister, the other
actors still have room to grow into their parts. James Telfer's Algernon
has an endearing live-for-the-moment foppishness playing opposite Hugh
Simon's fall guy, Jack, for example, but both are a little too polite to
draw fully on the play's undercutting energy.
The show, directed by Richard Baron, is still confident and amusing,
but I suspect it will really ignite when it transfers to Edinburgh's
Royal Lyceum in June, where a bigger auditorium will encourage bolder,
funnier performances.

Buenos Aires
ARGENTINA'S military regime in the late 1970s had thousands of people
thrown naked from aircraft into the Atlantic after they had been
kidnapped and tortured, a naval officer claimed yesterday.
About 4000 people were killed and 10,000 disappeared without trace in
the ''dirty war'' waged against left-wing guerrillas during the rule of
the military juntas from 1976 to 1983.
Now Commander Adolfo Francisco Scilingo has told a newspaper that he
was a crew member on two flights in June and July 1977 which dumped
people into the sea.
He described how the victims, many so weak from torture and detention
that they had to be helped aboard the plane, were injected with a
sedative by a navy doctor, and how he and another officer undressed them
and threw their unconscious bodies out into the ocean.
''They were stripped while they were unconscious and when the captain
of the aircraft gave the order . . . the door was opened and they were
thrown out naked, one by one,'' Commander Scilingo said.
The navy's School of Mechanics in Buenos Aires was the military's most
notorious torture centre and disposed of 15 to 20 alleged
''subversives'' every Wednesday for two years, he told the newspaper
Pagina 12.
''Two years, a hundred Wednesdays -- between 1500 and 2000 people,''
he said.
Commander Scilingo claimed that the orders came directly from the most
senior navy officers, who also joined some of the flights ''to give
moral support'' to the crew. After each flight, there was counselling
from navy chaplains for the officers involved.
The victims were unaware of their fate, the officer said. They were
told they were being transferred to another detention centre and needed
to be vaccinated.
''Who suffers more, someone who knows they are going to be shot or
someone who dies by this method?'' he asked.
Commander Scilingo, who retired from the navy in 1986, said he was
still haunted by the two flights he took part in and by a torture
session he witnessed. ''I think about it and go mad,'' he said. ''They
ordered me to act outside the law and turned me into a criminal.''
The dark episode of Argentina's recent history has been back in the
public eye since last year, when two navy officers still in active
service and seeking promotion broke years of silence by telling a Senate
hearing that the navy had used torture as a routine ''tool of the
trade'' during the dirty war.
President Carlos Menem, who himself was imprisoned by the military but
signed an amnesty for officers found guilty of human rights abuses,
enraged human rights groups by backing the two officers' promotion bid
and telling the Argentine people: ''Don't look back.'' The promotions
were nevertheless rejected.
Now Commander Scilingo has become the first Argentine officer to sue
his superiors over the dirty war: he has issued a writ against the
navy's chief of staff for covering up crimes. The terms of the writ are
not clear, but he will be suing his superiors.
The navy's chief of staff, Admiral Enrique Molina Pico, who has never
been accused of direct involvement in human rights abuses, told
reporters he was unaware of the writ.
The head of the military joint chiefs of staff, Mario Candido Diaz,
said Commander Scilingo did not merit a reply ''because he has lost all
his virtues as an officer and a gentleman''.
Mr Menem described Commander Scilingo as a crook. -- Reuter.

Sarajevo, Friday
SNIPERS today wounded four civilians and a French UN soldier in the
Bosnian capital Sarajevo.
Two men were injured when sniper fire hit a tram in the city centre
along a notorious stretch of road known as ''sniper alley''.
Snipers picked off a third civilian less than four hours later as he
was walking in the same area. Hospital staff said the bullet had damaged
the 20-year-old man's spinal cord, paralysing his legs.
A 34-year-old woman playing with her children in her flat at Dobrinja,
near the airport, was hit in the back by gunfire.
A French peacekeeper near the tram attack was slightly wounded, but
narrowly escaped more serious injury when a bullet ricocheted off his
helmet, said UN spokesman Major Herve Gourmelon.
The soldier was part of a French anti-sniping unit that returned fire
after sniper rounds raked the tram.
A Ukrainian anti-sniping unit came under fire nearby just 10 minutes
earlier.
Snipers have wounded 12 civilians and killed one this week in
Sarajevo, under siege by Bosnian Serbs.
Shooting incidents have increased around the capital and other front
lines across Bosnia, despite the current four-month ceasefire which has
slowed but not stopped fighting since it took effect on New Year's Day.
Meanwhile Nato announced today that it had stepped up enforcement of
the UN ban on flights over Bosnia after reports that the embargo is
increasingly being broken and media allegations of arms-running to the
Muslim-led government.
The move comes even though Nato military staff deny that there is any
evidence to support UN claims of illegal flights by unidentified planes
around Tuzla airport in northern Bosnia.
The departing UN commander in Yugoslavia, French General Bertrand de
Lapresle, played down the UN reports today. He said: ''There had not
been clear evidence that any plane either landed in Tuzla or dropped any
deliveries.''
Despite the denials, mystery still surrounds the affair which
triggered a new round of bickering between the United Nations and Nato
over Bosnia.
In the Serb capital Belgrade the Yugoslav news agency accused both the
United States and Nato of colluding to fly weapons secretly to Muslim
forces at Tuzla.
It said the Bosnian Serb Army suspected that weapons were sent to its
Muslim enemies aboard flights breaking both the UN arms embargo and the
no-fly zone over Bosnia.
Nato and the United Nations fell out badly last year when the UN
refused to allow tough air strikes against Bosnian Serbs taking heavy
guns into weapons exclusion zones and so-called UN safe areas.
Military sources said the Alliance had now stepped up policing of the
skies over Bosnia and was using two hi-tech Awacs monitoring planes for
the first time in months.
* A peach-coloured rose dedicated to soldiers serving in United
Nations forces has been unveiled at the New York Flower Show.
Peacekeeper was developed by British grower David Wardrop.
The rose dedication was part of this year's celebration of the United
Nations' 50th anniversary. Proceeds from sales of the rose bushes will
help UN Education programmes.--Reuter.

Fitness guru Susan Kane charmed millions in winning a slot on morning
TV -- but she has much to learn about celebrity, reports Judy Mackie.
FITNESS, Susan Kane, has discovered, can be a pretty stressful
business. Following a whistle-stop UK tour, recording a series of
keep-fit slots for the BBC, and a subsequent two-week skiing spree in
Canada, the new golden girl of morning TV sighs, sinks gratefully into
her favourite comfy armchair, and announces there's no place like home.
Swaddled in a fluffy grey sweater, her mane of blonde hair framing her
narrow face, the 29-year-old fitness guru from Aberdeen suddenly looks
very small and vulnerable and a far cry from the sunny, energetic Susan
who charmed the nation into voting her on to the Good Morning With Anne
and Nick show -- she began a 10-week fitness series yesterday -- in a
competition final last December. The reason? The inevitable
disillusionment that follows a day's grilling from London tabloids
determined to dig up the dirt on someone who is quite genuinely the girl
next door.
''My trouble is I'm too open with people. If they ask me about myself
I'll tell them. But I'm going to have to learn to keep quiet and not be
so trusting,'' she says ruefully, referring to one newspaper's interest
in her financial situation, which has exasperated her more reticent
fiance, Stewart Proctor. ''I can now understand why famous people become
so aloof and publicity-shy. All of a sudden everyone wants to know every
little detail about me.''
Too open she may be, but self-pity has never been one of Kane's
failings, and she soon shrugs off her disappointment. Her cheeky grin
returns as she starts to relate some of her adventures on location with
the BBC -- a tour of Scotland, England, and Wales which had her thinking
on her feet.
''My message is that fitness is for everyone, and I had to quickly
devise exercise routines for different groups of people, including
over-50s clubs, pregnant women, a rugby team, and a bunch of Canadian
hockey players. It was great fun -- especially with the over-50s men we
nicknamed the Glamis Gladiators -- but there were also some hair-raising
moments.''
She will not forget in a hurry the water-workout session with a group
of pregnant women in Turnberry, when one went into labour three weeks
early. Or the surprise outdoor encounter with an over-enthisiastic rugby
team, which went horribly wrong when they dunked her in freezing mud and
ruined the only outfit she could wear to keep continuity during that
particular filming session.
But her most challenging moment of all was having to cling halfway up
the mast of HMS Victory at Portsmouth and shout encouragement to a group
of women working out on the deck below.
''It was early on in the tour and I found it really difficult to sound
energetic and enthusiastic while hanging on to the mast and being filmed
in front of a ship full of onlookers. Fifteen takes later, I had
overcome my nerves enough to sound as though I meant it!''
Within a few days, however, she had earned the nickname ''One-Take
Kane'' and she began to thoroughly enjoy her baptism of fire as a rookie
TV presenter. ''It was enormous fun and between that and having to face
the press en masse, I feel I've gained the strength to tackle anything
now.''
Back home in the four-bedroomed detached house she shares with
computer-centre manager Stewart, 30, Kane is keen to return to her usual
routine, running her Body Physique fitness business, which involves
teaching 11 aerobics classes a week. She puts her popularity -- both in
the Grampian fitness scene and in the BBC competition -- down to the
fact that she's genuine and approachable. ''I think my strength is that
I come across as someone people can relate to. I don't want them to feel
daft doing exercises. Some showbiz fitness instructors seem to enjoy
getting people to make fools of themselves.''
She also feels very strongly about the dangers of dieting, which she
has seen at close quarters. ''I know people who have had bad experiences
with dieting -- they practically starved themselves and then wondered
why they were feeling so unhealthy.'' As a result, she has included her
message of ''everything in moderation'' in her weekly television slots.
Her involvement in the fitness industry springs from a life-long love
of sport of all kinds. As a schoolgirl, she intended to train as a PE
teacher, but her career plans changed after she was head-hunted by a
local delivery company for its sales team and became involved in
part-time modelling. ''Both jobs did wonders for my confidence. I was
painfully shy at school and would blush beetroot if anyone so much as
spoke to me,'' she laughs.
Her first love eventually won through, however, and six years ago, she
left work to train as a YMCA fitness instructor, which led to setting up
her own business.
Safety has always been a priority with Kane, who attends at least
three fitness conventions a year to keep up-to-date with the latest
techniques and safety tips. These, she says, are constantly changing as
more in-depth research is carried out. Always looking for inspiration,
she has also over the years invited several international exercise gurus
to Grampian to share their expertise with a keen core of fitness fans.
Socially, her life with fellow sports enthusiast Stewart revolves
around skiing, snowboarding, squash, roller-blading, and horse-riding.
The energetic pair plan to marry this September, 12 years after bumping
into each other in an Aberdeen gym.
As she snuggles deeper into her chair, it's obvious Susan is a
home-loving woman. Surrounded by antique pine furniture, which she and
Stewart have collected together, she is happy to once again be in
familiar surroundings. The doorbell rings -- it's her mum, Cathy,
popping round for the first proper gossip they've had for over a month.
By this time the sunny smile is well and truly back and Susan is
speaking hopefully of a summertime stint with the BBC. I leave them to
it, in no doubt that whatever lies in store for Susan Kane, our flexible
friend will always come bouncing back.

Johannesburg, Friday
WINNIE MANDELA today vowed to fight corruption and fraud allegations
and what she called a ''vendetta'' being waged against her.
In her first comments since she returned to South Africa yesterday,
she claimed defiantly: ''One gets the feeling that a vendetta is pursued
by charlatans and cowards.''
Meanwhile police said they were working on ways to win speedy access
to documents seized this week as part of the corruption inquiry
involving Mrs Mandela.
A South African judge thwarted moves to obtain them today, postponing
a ruling until March 14.
The documents are being held under lock and key until a court decision
on Mrs Mandela's call for the warrants used to search her home to be set
aside.
Mrs Mandela said through her lawyers that ''forces of reaction'' had
launched attacks on her and other leaders of the African National
Congress.
''The fight against those who are perceived to be pillars of ANC mass
support has now become obvious and transparent,'' she said.
''In defence of the aspirations of my people, I am left with no choice
but to take the challenge head on.''
Police are investigating allegations that Mrs Mandela, a Deputy
Minister for Arts, Culture, Science, and Technology, used her position
and influence to win low-cost housing contracts for a firm in which she
had financial interests.--Reuter.

A PALPABLE hit with the London music media, Gene last night proved
themselves hugely eco-friendly. Having resurrected the obverse haircut
initially popularised in 1966 by Dave Dee -- or was it Beaky, or Mick,
or Tich, or Paul Weller? -- Gene's guitarist, Steve Mason, proceeded to
recycle the ramshackle riff from Cindy Incidentally by the Faces more
times than the Faces did. Which is often. Very, very often.
Moreover, Gene's singer, Martin Rossiter, appears to be Morrissey's
nephew, ie preening and graceless and much given to being declamatory,
sonorous, and fey all at the same time. ''I hope the next song is a
little familiar,'' he said at one point. ''They bloody all are,'' I
heckled a little too loudly, startling myself.
Too much like the Smiths. Too much like the guitar-riff from Cindy
Incidentally. And Gene's audience aping the mini-stage-invasions which
accrue to Morrissey? Too much.
I flounced out, vowing to form a band in homage to A Flock of
Seagulls, Jo Jo Gunne, and the Herd. Not the best of influences, I'll
grant you, but I reckon I could do something with them that wouldn't be
as obvious, as safe, as bankrupt as Gene. Olympian is the title of
Gene's next single, as well as that of their forthcoming debut LP. A
more apt title, given Gene's worth, might be Molehillian.

YOU wouldn't have Dolly Rawlins as a wife, a mother, or a friend if
they paid you a fortune. She is a kind of female version of Mad Frankie
Fraser, hard-faced and dangerous to know. A woman whose steely eyes
could petrify any unsuspecting soul with one piercing glance. If you cut
her picture out you could pin it up on the mantlepiece to keep the weans
away from the fire. And that is precisely why, in Lynda La Plante's
acclaimed serial Widows, she was one of the most powerful and infamous
television characters of the 1980s.
And, as it turns out, will be again, in the long-awaited six-part
sequel, She's Out (Monday, ITV). Nine years in the pokey (for murdering
her gang-boss husband in the first series) have mellowed Dolly. She's
older and wiser and she wants to go straight and open a children's home
from the hidden proceeds of a long-gone but not forgotten robbery.
But it wouldn't be much of a sequel if that were simply the case. It
sounds too much like a nice, bring-a-tear-to-a-glass-eye story. And
Lynda La Plante doesn't go in for nice, bring-a-tear-to-a-glass-eye
stories. So you have to add danger; you have to add a wicked element to
the equation. Enter Dolly's friends, a deliciously motley crew of female
lags waiting to welcome her when she walks free from Holloway. Only
they're not her friends; they're actually her enemies. Be nice to Dolly
and she'll lead you all the way to #6 million-worth of uncut diamonds,
hidden away all those years ago.
Widows broke the mould. Ten years ago it hit the screens and turned
the thriller serial on its head. Until then tough contemporary drama had
been the almost exclusive province of the macho male writer. Ladies were
still disenfranchised when it came to writing scripts with attitude.
Then along came La Plante (whose height -- she is tiny -- is in inverse
proportion to her talent) who was like a one-woman suffragette movement
for female screenwriters. Here, for the first time ever, was a
hard-hitting crime drama written about women by a woman. It set La
Plante on a collision course with success. A forerunner to programmes
like Civvies, Framed, and the award-winning Prime Suspect.
OF COURSE, Widows wasn't into feel-good endings. It finished with a
spectacular (and botched) robbery. Of the three principal female
characters, one was dead, another had fled to South America, and Dolly
was in custody facing a lengthy prison sentence. She's Out, a scorching
drama if ever there was one, takes up with Dolly's release from prison.
The first thing you notice about Ann Mitchell, who returns with a
reprise of her Dolly Rawlins role, is the fact that she totally belies
her screen image. Dolly could terrify a bloke. She is the kind of woman
you wouldn't want to take an empty pay packet home to for fear of a
broken nose.
But Ann Mitchell, in life, couldn't be more different from her
television character if she tried. She is an immensely friendly woman,
soft-spoken to the point of whisper, and gentle, almost precious, in her
manner. She sits, dressed in a powder-blue trouser suit which is a
million miles removed from her black widow's disguise, nervously
fingering a Silk Cut. Though thoughtful, polite, and constructive in her
replies, she is clearly uncomfortable with interviews.
She is one of Britain's most outstanding stage actresses. She has
worked at the RSC, at the National, the Royal Court, and the Citizens'
in Glasgow. In 1992 she was named Performer of the Year for her title
role in Hecuba. She is also an accomplished director and writer and a
professor of acting at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.
But what she is not, surprisingly, is a household name. Drop ''Ann
Mitchell'' into a conversation with non-theatrical types and you get a
blank stare in response. Ann who? It's only when you make the Dolly
Rawlins connection that the penny drops. And yet she is no stranger to
television. In addition to Widows, she has appeared in episodes of
Bergerac (where she played a villain) and in Taggart (the mother of a
murder victim). So what did she think about the resurrection of Dolly
Rawlins?
''People still write to Lynda and me about Widows. In fact, there is
still a Widows Fan Club. It was a letter from one of these fans,
pointing out that Dolly was ready for parole, which sparked off the idea
for the sequel in Lynda's mind.
''When we first discussed She's Out I thought that, after 10 years, it
would be difficult to bring back the character I played so long ago. But
I went for lots of long walks and I discovered, to my surprise, that
there were a lot of aspects to her that were still there.
''I was interested to find out what would happen to her
psychologically. One of the things that happens, after all those years
in prison, is her need for relationships. She needs people around her,''
she explains.
The people that Dolly befriends on her release include an ex-madam, a
prostitute, a junkie, a gun dealer, and a forger. It is, of course, a
false friendship, cupboard love if you like. They are an unsavoury
parcel of rogues who want to use Dolly to get to the diamonds.
This time round Dolly is full of the best intentions. She is
determined to walk a straight line and she genuinely wants to open that
children's home. But circumstances conspire to make her plans go
pear-shaped. And when they do, the old tough and dangerous Dolly
reappears with a vengeance.
Ann Mitchell went to extreme lengths to research her role. She was no
stranger to women in prison, having taught drama in Holloway (a number
of her ex-students play prisoners in the first episode).
''I also talked to a lot of ex-prisoners, including one woman who had
spent nine years in jail, and I attended a university course on the
psychological analysis of murder,'' she adds.
''You have to go into a prison to understand what it means to hear
that lock in the door. And that's something that is constantly happening
in jail. It is frightening. Even as a teacher, I found it very hard to
deal with.''
So what does Ann Mitchell think of her character? ''Well, I like her
dry wit and her strength and her passion. But I dislike -- actually
'dislike' is the wrong word -- I am critical of the way she needs
instant gratification. Her problem is that she wants everything
immediately. She has no sense of patience,'' she explains.
''The other thing about her is the fact that she has no remorse for
her crime. You have to gain an insight into yourself in order to admit
to your crime. Dolly regrets nothing. She justifies the killing (of her
husband) and she justifies it with the fact that he had betrayed her.''

QUESTIONS, questions. On University Challenge (BBC2, Wednesday) Paxman
was bringing tertiary education into disrepute by asking the brightest
and best if they could name the gallery that houses the Mona Lisa. This
column was asking itself why young folk today can breeze through three
toughies on ''the media'' while appearing to believe that The Magic
Flute was something run up by Armani. The answer, we told ourselves, has
a lot to do with Jeremy.
Given that he can no longer persuade terrified members of the
Government actually to appear on Newsnight with him, Paxman has become a
media event in his own right. Debating fox-hunting with Labour's John
McFall and a master of hounds -- who made an incisive contribution by
saying ''rubbish'' at intervals -- the demon interlocutor behaved, as
usual, as though he had all the answers written down on little cards.
Perhaps a touch of role reversal is therefore in order. Perhaps the
politicians could be given a starter for 10 and three bonus questions if
they manage to tell the truth. Perhaps the University Challenge
contestants could do with a little more sneering and fewer questions
designed to make the viewer believe he isn't actually dead yet.
As one who, back in Bamber's day, refused to try out for Edinburgh's
team on the grounds that stupidity requires no publicity (''Bell,
Edinburgh, reading tea leaves''), it was encouraging to see this year's
lot stroll through the quarter-finals in a match with some Cambridge
college. Still, the questions are easier now, aren't they? I mean, said
the figure slumped on the couch, course it's Apollinaire. Diogenes! he
shouts. ''Diogenes?'' says Jeremy witheringly. ''Neoww! Heraclitus.''
Heraclitus it was who said no man steps twice into the same river, but
no-one ever asked a Greek philosopher to make a TV documentary. In a
week in which calls were made for the banning of foxes, boxing, and
Norman Lamont, BBC Scotland's Cracking Stories (Wednesday) had the
none-too-original idea of following the Berwickshire Hunt. Out with the
Hounds left you with the feeling that the pursuit of fox-hunters is a
cruel sport in which the poor, dumb quarry has no chance of escape.
As one gent noted, the fox is not a protected species. He neglected to
mention that the people who kill it for fun most certainly are. There
they were in their unnatural habitat making fools of themselves without
benefit of commentary, proving Wilde right at every turn (of the hounds:
''You couldn't feed them on a fox -- it's not very good eating'') and
making their opponents' case every time they opened their jaws.
''Hunting is not just about killing foxes,'' said one natural-born
killer, ''there are more efficient ways of killing foxes.'' The same
chap averred that hunting is a way of life, which is probably true for
everyone save the fox. It was a good piece, as comedies go, but it ran
nothing to earth.
Harry (BBC1, Wednesday) was more like it. In the world of News
Associates every story has an ending, even if it's an unhappy one, and
every story makes the ''nationals'', even (or especially) when it's an
unbelievable one. Everyone is broke and miserable as a result but that,
as people on the show tend to say for no immediately explicable reason,
is the name of the game.
Michael Elphick's Harry Salter, gargling warm gravel, is a decent
parody of a man in a profession whose business is self-parody.
Nevertheless, what we have here is just another detective show
masquerading as a press melodrama. When the plot takes a preposterous
turn that's down to Harry's luck (game, name of) and nothing to do with
reporting skills. When he isn't allowing world exclusives to fall into
his lap, Salter is contending with soulful saxophones and those
appalling, squealing guitar figures which, in every land, shout Drama.
''I'll tell you,'' Harry tells you, ''I invented street-wise.'' He takes
no credit for plots.
There's a thesis in all this, and it's so neat someone should let out
the seams: the best documentaries on TV are foul, ill-written semi-soap
operas and the best dramas are concealed within glossy documentaries.
Modern Times (BBC2, Wednesday) offered in Cheating Hearts the bones of
the sort of thriller that ought to star a vengeful Sharon Stone and a
guilty Michael Douglas. Jobs for the Girls (BBC1, Thursday) took two
light comedy players and proceeded to tell you more about the newspaper
business than Harry ever knew.
Should Pauline Quirke and Linda Robson ever decide to desert the
desperately unfunny Birds of a Feather they have a future ready and
waiting in the documentary game. To say they are naturals is to say
little; they look and sound as though there is nothing else they can be.
Even given the daunting task of learning about newspapers from the
Guardian (let us now type ''non sequitur'' and pray to the god of
misprints) they were witty, eager, and bubbling with intelligent
questions.
Granted, it may have been an error, as it invariably is, to involve
Andrew Neil in the project, but unlike most such star vehicles the pair
were actually trying to do the job. There was Robson up an aluminium
ladder outside Downing Street struggling to persuade the androids to
smile; there was Quirke (''I was trying to get an angle -- I was trying
to be a clever dickie'') out on the streets with John ''Fingers'' Mullin
conducting a crucial Guardian investigation into, as it were,
underpants. Impressive was not the word for it. What do you mean, any
fool can write a TV review?
Modern Times was less fun but equally compelling. Mike Emilianow
resembled the sort of thing you find on your shoe after the hounds have
passed by. His business is the ''fidelity test'', his mission to uncover
''crimes against the heart''. Which means, in essence, putting some man
under suspicion from his partner in close proximity to a paid floozie
and seeing whether he lives up to his gender's ancient reputation for
fidelity, reliability, and honesty.
What quickly became clear was that the person taking real advantage of
vulnerable people was, of course, chirpy Mike himself. You watched yet
wished you hadn't. Diogenes didn't say that either.

Torrance, California, Friday
A MAN who stole a slice of pizza from some children last summer has
been sentenced to 25 years to life in prison under a state law requiring
stiff penalties for repeat offenders.
Jerry Dewayne Williams, 27, of Los Angeles was convicted of theft in
January for taking the pepperoni pizza from a group of children, aged 7
to 14, at a pizza parlour on the pier at Redondo Beach.
Williams had prior convictions for robbery, attempted robbery, drug
possession, and unauthorised use of a vehicle, so prosecutors sought to
have him sentenced under California's ''three-strikes'' law.
The law, enacted last year, requires longer prison sentences for
felons with at least one prior conviction for a serious or violent
felony. Defendants with two previous such felonies, for instance, face
sentences of 25 years to life for any third felony.
While petty theft is typically a misdemeanour charge, Williams'
earlier convictions -- for robbery, attempted robbery, unauthorised use
of a motor vehicle, and possession of a controlled substance -- allowed
prosecutors to upgrade it to a felony.
Williams' lawyer argued that the sentence did not match the crime.
Williams must serve 20 years before he is eligible for parole.
''Mr Williams will be facing the same sentence as if he'd raped a
woman, molested a child, or done a carjacking, because the statute does
not draw distinctions,'' said defence lawyer Arnold Lester, who added
that he will appeal.
Prosecutors said at the trial that it was robbery by intimidation, but
Lester said his client had made no threat and was only playing an
immature game of ''Truth or Dare'' with a friend, fuelled by an
afternoon's beer drinking.
Deputy District Attorney Bill Gravelin said the law, named after
baseball where a batter is out if he misses three successive deliveries,
was specifically aimed at defendants like Williams.--AP/Reuter.

Washington, Friday
PRESIDENT Clinton emerged from purdah today, giving his first press
conference in months and showing a sunny, cheery disposition in stark
contrast with the bad temper and malice of leading Republicans.
He did not gloat that the balanced budget amendment was defeated and
he passed up several opportunities to reply in kind to attacks by Newt
Gingrich, Bob Dole, and Phil Gramm.
The contrast is partly natural (Mr Clinton is much more likeable than
those three), partly considered.
The president wants to resume his place centre-stage, after the
Republicans have strutted and fretted there since they won the last
election. The best way is to play the statesman, a president above
politics, calling on Congress to help him find a middle way on the
budget, health care, and affirmative action.
''I stand behind my budget,'' he said. ''I will wait for the
Republicans to do their duty and produce their budget.''
In other words, it is time for the Republicans to live up to the
promise of their election manifesto and tell us how they intend to
balance the budget in the next seven years. Mr Clinton joined the rest
of his party in a fervent defence of Social Security, asserting that the
Republicans want to cut benefits, and that he will oppose them.
He said that his own re-election platform would be peace and
prosperity: things are better now than they were when he took office two
years ago, and he claimed the credit.
''They've owned this town for 20 of the past 26 years. When I came
here, the Republicans had given us a $3 trillion debt, quadruple what it
was before. I have reduced the deficit over the two years.''
* Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana has become the latest Republican
hopeful to join the race for the presidency in 1996. He will run as an
expert on foreign affairs, a platform unlikely to be well received.

A TEDDY sounds like cuddly fun. For the information of those not au
fait with such things, it is a slinky female undergarment in which to
pose on satin sheets, providing your house has central heating. It has
shoulder straps and fastens under the crotch. ''Camiknickers'' was the
less-than-glamorous name for them when they came out in the 1920s and,
worse still, ''cami-bockers''.
''Black rayon cami-bockers, bodice with narrow shoulder-straps,
elastic leg-hems, hook and eye and press-stud fastening; labelled
Spirella -- made in England.'' This passion-killer of a description
refers to an item from a 1928 bride's trousseau, now at the Pittville
Pump Room Museum at Cheltenham.
Less likely to pass muster at a decorous spa is the dickey. A false
shirt-front and collar is hardly attire becoming to a gentleman. More
recently, dickey also referred to that draughty arrangement of knitted
polo-neck with flaps. It was meant to stay tucked inside the top of a
sweater, but came adrift every time you turned your head.
Slap shoes were another unpromising idea. They flourished briefly in
the seventeenth century. A rigid sole extended to the back of a
high-heeled shoe, but was not attached there. They may indeed have kept
the heel mud-free, but they flapped as the wearer walked along.
Slap shoes have gone the way of spats and spatterdashes, the bustle,
the kipper tie, and the lemon-cup bust-improver. In other words, unless
one is a dedicated follower of Vivienne Westwood one is unlikely to see
them outside a museum. However, they do all come together effectively in
The Guide to Historic Costume by Karen Baclawski, newly published by
Batsford at #35.
Listed at the back of this excellent illustrated book are the
following places, mostly museums, in Scotland, where items of historic
dress can be seen:

Once again Lord Younger gives the Conservatives a helping hand in
Perth and Kinross
TWICE already George Younger has played a crucial role in choosing the
Tory MP for Perth and Kinross. In 1963 he stepped aside to allow Lord
Home to take a seat in the Commons and become Prime Minister. In 1974 he
gave the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn a crucial piece of advice that
secured his nomination.
This time, the chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland is offering his
services to the latest candidate, who will face the electorate later
this year in the by-election caused by Sir Nicholas's death last month.
With pressure from the Scottish National Party, Lord Younger's chances
of making it three in a row seem slim.
But from his new offices in London he is happy to recollect the
frantic days in 1963 when, as a 32-year-old prospective parliamentary
candidate, he agreed under pressure from the party to stand aside in
favour of Alec Douglas-Home, who had dramatically renounced his earldom
in order to succeed Harold Macmillan as Prime Minister and urgently
needed a seat in the Commons.
George Younger, scion of the brewing family and heir to the third
Viscount Leckie, had already fought the 1959 election in North Lanark
against a Labour majority of 5000 -- ''it seemed a lot in those days''
-- and was becoming increasingly anxious to secure a seat. Travelling
home from Edinburgh one evening he heard over the radio news that the MP
for the safe seat of Kinross and West Perthshire had died. ''It's now or
never for going into politics, I thought.''
He duly put his name forward and submitted himself to the extended
selection process that summer. Unsuitable candidates were weeded out by
sub-groups of party worthies, usually women, who visited the candidate
and his family -- wife Diana and four children -- to make sure
everything was as it should be. He advanced to a short-leet of four.
The final selection-round took place in Crieff. Each candidate -- he
remembers one of the others, Lord Mansfield, then William Stormont --
was allocated a hotel. Younger was put in the Murray Park. ''At the
given time I walked down the hill to meet the executive. I answered
questions. They said thank you. I walked back to my hotel, and then was
summoned back to be told I had been chosen. At the age of 32 I had been
offered what amounted to a job for life.''
There followed weeks of meetings in outlying branches -- the
constituency then stretched from north of Pitlochry south almost to
Stirling, and from Tyndrum east to Kinross.
That autumn Macmillan's illness precipitated an election. The opening
days of the campaign in October coincided with the party conference in
Blackpool. For Younger this meant two meetings a night across the
constituency. But from Blackpool came ominous rumblings. The battle to
succeed Macmillan was under way.
''By the second or third day I started to get phone calls from
journalists, who to me were terrifying people from the big world of
politics. They were asking me what I planned to do if Earl Home decided
to become a candidate.''
A few days later the wranglings between Douglas-Home, Rab Butler, and
Quintin Hogg came to a head: ''By the Friday it was quite clear it would
be Douglas Home and he would have to renounce his earldom.'' There were
only two vacant seats available -- Marylebone in London, for which
no-one had been selected, and Kinross and West Perthshire.
''It was obvious to me that if a Scotsman like Douglas-Home was going
to get a seat it made enormous sense for him to have the Scottish one.
An ex-Scottish peer sitting for a London constituency would have been
ridiculous.''
Younger contacted Sir John Gilmour, then MP for East Fife and deputy
chairman of the Tory Party in Scotland -- and also a distant cousin.
''He told me 'if you are prepared to offer this to Lord Home he would be
enormously grateful'.'' Younger telephoned Douglas-Home, by then
installed in Downing Street, made the offer, and gave up his safe seat.
''Home was very grateful and said he would see me when he came up. Then
he asked if I could fix it in the constituency.''
This proved far more difficult. The good burghers of Kinross and West
Perthshire were not happy at the idea of such a change after all the
effort put into choosing Younger. ''Not because they had any particular
desire to stick to me but because they didn't like being pushed
around.''
The constituency chairman summoned a meeting at his castle near
Crieff, where Younger and his agent ''had quite a sticky morning''.
''They had nothing against Alec, but they felt it was a problem for the
party to sort out after a messy Blackpool conference. We persuaded them
that if they turned Alec down it would damage his and the party's
prospects.'' By lunchtime the constituency was convinced.
At a stroke Kinross and West Perthshire became the focus of the
world's press. Younger had agreed to stay on to help with the campaign,
because it was impossible for Douglas-Home to spend his whole time in
the constituency. ''I became his runner, in effect.'' By then the local
party had rallied round: ''The formidable ladies became tremendously
steamed up and were enormously enthusiastic about it all, not least
because of the sudden international attention.''
In 1963 the voters in Kinross and West Perthshire were fed-up with the
Conservatives, who by then had been 12 years in office. The Liberal
candidate was talking about devolution. And the Nationalist candidate
had been around too long to be taken seriously. The seat was resolutely
Tory -- it had never been anything else. Doulgas-Home was duly returned.
In answer to the obvious question, Lord Younger says his offer was
freely made, freely received, and did not come with a deal attached.
''There was nothing they could offer. I was told they would do
everything they could to help me get selected elsewhere, but you can't
impose a candidate on a constituency. Probably the best thing they could
have done was to keep out.''
Younger did not have to wait long. A few months later the long-serving
MP for Ayr, Sir Thomas Moore, decided to retire. By coincidence,
Younger's great-grandfather had held the seat. The future Scottish and
Defence Secretary under Margaret Thatcher was selected, and held the
seat from 1964 until his retirement from the Commons in 1992. It remains
-- barely -- in Tory hands with a majority of 85. ''For a young man with
no political experience, that October was the most extraordinary
episode. I gained half a lifetime's experience in a few days.''
Nearly 25 years later it is difficult to be optimistic about Tory
prospects in Perth and Kinross. Younger blames ill-health for the
devastating remarks about his designated successor made by Sir Nicholas
two weeks before he died, in which he described the businessman John
Godfrey, among other things, as a clone. Younger has offered to campaign
for Godfrey. ''He will make a good candidate. But it will be very hard.
Governments have a difficult time in by-elections.''
Oh, and the advice he gave Nicky Fairbairn in 1974? ''Nicky had tried
and tried to find a seat, but no-one would have him and he couldn't
understand why. Just before the meeting for Perth and Kinross he rang me
up. I told him his only chance was to take my advice. 'For the meeting,
dress like me. Wear a sober grey suit,' I told him. He resisted, but
eventually did what I suggested, and was chosen.'' The rest, as they
say, is the history of the Tory party in Scotland.

In a world where every day is Hogmanay and economy
is the buzz word, a breathless Cameron Simpson
embarks on the latest Florida magical mystery tour.
Monday
OUTSIDE it's America.
Inside, in the field of dreams, we are wide awake in a world where
every day is Hogmanay, where hotel guests survive a terrifying 13-floor
plunge in a runaway lift, and where, judging by the 100-watt smiles,
toothpaste salesmen have died and gone to heaven.
There are six of us and we have come to see Walt Disney World's latest
attractions in Florida. Our guides are two all-American boys, Corey
Vanelli and Tony Gebbia. Third-generation Americans whose ancestors come
from Italy, they are about to make us offers we can't refuse.
But first our accommodation. We are staying at the Rock Inn in
Disney's All Star Music Resort. The 1920-room family resort is the
latest to open at WDW with themes based on Broadway, jazz, calypso,
country, and rock 'n' roll. The rooms, which sleep up to four people,
are also the cheapest at $69 and $79 a night. When you compare this with
$485 a night at the Grand Floridian beach resort or $205 at Wilderness
Lodge, you start to get the idea.
Economy is the Disney word for them. It may have unsavoury
connotations back home -- where flying economy equals goat class,
economy burgers are inedible, and Norman Lamont's handling of it left
him looking like a little burger -- but in Disney all it signifies, it
seems to me, is difference in location and a different-coloured duvet on
the bed. Sure, we are not at the hub of things, but there are free
regular buses, monorail, and boats to take us all over the resort.
Tuesday
THE one thing you must not miss is Honey I Shrunk the Audience, a 3-D
misadventure with Rick Moranis and Eric Idle. It is the official opening
in Epcot 95 and the stars are there to twinkle in person. We leave the
cinema with tears in free-fall down our cheeks. I can't remember
laughing so much.
Moranis plays Professor Szalinski, who ends up shrinking the audience
while receiving Inventor of the Year award from Idle. At one point
hundreds of white mice flood the cinema floor, or so you think -- it is
that realistic, with jets of air blowing over your feet to give the
scary impression -- while a python lunges at you out of the screen.
Shrunk to Tom Thumb size, you sit there as a dog as big as a skyscraper
sneezes over you. The effect is completed by hidden jets that spray
water in your face. Yuk!
We meet Idle at a news conference. ''You sound British, but you look
like Gene Wilder,'' says one American journo. ''What have you been in
before this?'' he asks. ''Jail,'' Moranis jumps in to say.
We are introduced later in private as Her Majesty's Press. Idle asks
where we are from. Manchester and London, the rest say. ''I'm from
Glasgow,'' I say. ''Ha, Her Majesty's Opposition,'' he shoots back. The
python has lost none of his satirical bite.
Later we go on to tour the Magic Kingdom and are intrigued by a steel
rope slanting down from the tower of the magic castle where Walt Disney
once thought of building a penthouse apartment for himself. Tinkerbell,
we are told, slides down the rope into the crowd on certain days. She is
paid $250 for the stunt. Every dream in Disney has its price.
Wednesday
TIME for the Tower of Terror, set in the deserted old Hollywood Tower
Hotel which has re-opened decades after a stormy night when five guests
mysteriously disappeared in the lift. The tour culminates in a 13-storey
plunge in the lift. As we are about to drop, Tony brings out a quarter
and places it in the palm of his hand. As we plunge, it rises six inches
into the air.
We go on to ride Splash Mountain, which pitches you down a
near-vertical drop in a boat. My whole life flashes before my eyes. All
I can see is a sea of Tennent's lager. The woman sitting beside me,
clutching the rail in front of us with chalky knuckles, says she has
survived by doing breathing exercises she was shown during the birth of
her three children. I do not have her advantage.
Having changed trousers, we leave the park for a dose of reality in
the Big Bamboo Bar on Highway 192. We end up having a jar (literally) of
Budweiser. In the corner, lights twinkle on a Christmas tree, while a
sign wishes you Happy New Year. The owner, it transpires, fought in the
war in the Pacific and used to get things sent from home in Mason jam
jars. To him they came to symbolise everything good in the world. Just
like the Christmas tree, so that is why we are drinking out of jam jars
under a Christmas tree in February. And this is reality?
Late at night we go to Pleasure Island, Disney for adults. There are
discos, a comedy store, jazz, and adventurers' clubs. Every night is
Hogmanay. My resolution is to come back again next year, which I suppose
means the next night. Life's tough, aint it?
Thursday
WE go for a drink in the Rose and Crown, a replica of a London pub, in
Epcot's World Showcase. You can't get a drink in Florida unless you are
21. A sign in the R and C says you have to look 30 to get served if you
don't have ID. The Daily Mirror journalist with us, who is 24 going on
17, is refused service so we buy him a sasparilla with a straw. His face
glows bright red -- despite his aversion to the Sun. Inexplicably, the
short-sighted barman sees no barrier to serving me without ID.
It is really Friday. Heck, Disney can do anything. We are standing on
the observation platform of one of the highest hotels in Florida to
watch the Shuttle blast off. The time is 12.22am and in the distance
Discovery, its first woman pilot on board, thunders off into another
world of imagination. High above Orange County it trails jets of
volcanic orange blossom in its wake. It is a day late in taking off on
its star trek. ''Women drivers,'' someone says. We retire downstairs
wrapped in the warm afterglow of having witnessed a piece of history in
the making.
Friday
LUNCH at Planet Hollywood. It is our last meal in the good ole US of
A. In a country that prides itself on democracy, we have eaten like
kings. For a few dollars we have eaten huge American breakfasts of
bacon, scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, and biscuits. But the biscuits we
have eaten are more like scones than digestives. We have lunched on $10
pizzas which are enough to feed a family of four hungry turtles, and
dined at the other end of the spectrum on surf and turf -- lobster and
steak -- for about $30 in the Grand Floridian.
But back to Planet Hollywood. Arnold Schwarzenegger, one of the
owners, has been there the day before on a drugs awareness campaign.
''We are now aware just where you can get them and how much they cost,''
a Yank quips.
It is a marvellous fast-food restaurant. Don't, whatever you do, miss
it. But our food is late, and no sooner has our main course arrived than
it is time to leave for the airport. We get bags to carry it out,
watched by an incredulous owner who just happens to be sitting at the
next table. A PR phones later to apologise. Me? I could have sat there
all day.
The same goes for WDW, which has exceeded my wildest expectations. It
really is magic Mickey, magic.

I DISCOVERED sub-aqua diving in the desert. Well, as near as dammit in
the desert. As a junior officer in the Royal Army Service Corps,
defending the realm in Southern Arabia during the late fifties, my task
was to provide transport for other military, and, from time to time,
naval, units based in Aden.
One morning, an order landed on my humid desk for vehicles to
accommodate a party from HMS Bulwark, a majestic aircraft-carrier.
Fascinated, I decided to accompany them, just to see what great business
the Senior Service planned amid the Barren Rocks.
We met the crew at Steamer Point, where I discovered they were the HMS
Bulwark sub-aqua unit, intent upon a practice session from the beach
near the Officers' Club.
I chatted to their commander while the lads kitted up; hauling on
aqua-lungs, fins, lead-weighted belts, masks, meticulously checking
every item along the way. With a water temperature somewhere in the high
seventies, dry-suits were superfluous. ''Can you swim?'' he inquired,
conversationally.
After three years' military service, I should have known better than
to volunteer information, but before I could stop myself, I responded
affirmatively. ''Great,'' he said, ''why not have a go?'' Gulping what I
considered might be one of my last breaths, I agreed: ''Thanks, I was
hoping you would offer,'' I lied glibly.
Ten minutes later, after basic instruction, I was aqua-lunged, masked,
finned, weighted, and standing up to my armpits in warm water. ''Go on,
just walk out,'' came the shout from the shore. I did, and, miracle of
miracles, found myself submerged in a new, mystical and exciting world,
relaxed and breathing normally.
I explored cautiously, and, as confidence increased, with absolute
delight: working the edge of the protective shark net, discovering an
alarming hole in one corner where I met an enormous, brightly-hued
parrot fish. A stingray lay, sand-covered, below me. As I passed, the
fish flapped off in a misty cloud, like a giant, underwater bat.
Time seemed suspended and I would have happily stayed underwater for
ever. There was so much to see and do, to learn and discover.
In March 1953, six years before my Gulf of Aden dive, the Scottish
Sub-Aqua Club (SSAC) was born in Ibrox Baths; the first sub-aqua club in
Britain, now one of the oldest in the world. Today, there are 80
branches throughout Scotland.
The Scottish Sports Council (SSC) recognised the SSAC as the governing
body for the sport in Scotland in the seventies, and have supported the
activities of the club in fullest measure ever since; both financially,
and through the hard work of SSC development officers Ian Davenport and
Charles Wilde.
Safety is the policy corner-stone of the SSAC; the club estimate that,
so far, they have trained some 18,000 divers, and they are in the
forefront of the development of training methods for handicapped divers.
Last year, the Telford Branch in Edinburgh hosted an event for
physically handicapped people at the Leith Academy pool; with mask and
snorkel, and the chance to try scuba-diving.
All you need to purchase initially is mask, fins, and snorkel. Once
proficient, other equipment may be hired or borrowed from the club
branch, or from diving holiday organisers. Most newcomers begin with
aqua-lung training and the SSAC also run instructors' courses.
Scotland has some of the finest diving water in Europe, superbly
clear, with underwater visibility of up to 20 metres and more in many
places. What you see and what you find while diving is never
predictable. The unexpected is always just around the corner. Paul
Renucci, diving recently with Tony Vincent, over the wreck of The Samba
in Shetland, described one such occasion.
''Tony appeared indicating excitedly to me to fin over. As I did so he
came out holding a dogfish which had obviously been hooked and had
tangled the fishing line around the wreckage. Tony managed to unhook our
new-found friend who stayed incredibly calm throughout the operation;
then, and to our amazement, in an undoubted gesture of thanks, she
glided round Tony, allowing him to stroke her.''
More public and obvious, is the work of Napier University, helping to
clean and maintain the penguin enclosure at Edinburgh Zoo; 40-50 minutes
underwater, removing algae and scouring viewing windows, and making
acquaintance with many species of penguin, including the magnificent
three-feet tall King Penguin.
As important as the physical thrill of diving is the comradeship
engendered and friendships made. Divers are a welcoming, happy bunch,
always ready to share their experience with others, sometimes in
extraordinary circumstances: the Shetland Branch saw last New Year in at
the bottom of Lerwick Harbour.
Deciding where to dive, and when, will be your only problem and here
again the SSAC can help. The club have an extensive library at their
Glasgow HQ, with more than 700 books and charts, available at a small
rental charge, along with a number of excellent diving videos. You may
also make photocopies of items of interest and money raised helps fund
new acquisitions.
The SSAC publish an outstanding magazine, Scottish Diver, as well as
an excellent training manual and regular newsletter. Sub-aqua diving
will introduce you to a marvellous, magical, entirely new world of rare
beauty. For something completely different, who not take a deep breath
and give it a go?

IT'S been a long hard winter for our local flock of lapwings, a
hundred or so of them, heads down on the mudflats in the bleak
south-westerlies or circling close-packed until the sparrowhawk or dog
had moved along the beach. They flew with that rounded, bouncy motion
you can tell a mile away. Then you see their lovely old English name:
hleapewince, the ''leap with a waver in it''. And as they slide in to
land again you can hear the waver in the Scots name, too: peesieweep.
The birds we see on the shore are migrants for the far north. Our own
flock has scattered in pairs to the wet pastures and the ploughed
fields. Here you can see lapwings on the farms again in March, a hundred
thousand pairs in Scotland, remaking former springs with their tumbling
display flight. The male flies low across the furrows, accelerates to
climb vertically and beat along calling its polysyllabic, rasping song,
then twists into its aerobatic dive, primary feathers buzzing against
the air.
What's it all for? Sex and property. There is always such a thing as
society, for birds as for us, so no energy spent on communication is
wasted in the balance-sheet of reproduction. You may see a male hollow a
scrape with his breast, tipping his tail up and fanning it to show a
bright pattern of black, white, and chestnut. In April the females will
incubate four olive and black eggs in the same spot. Before they fly
they will run, as Shakespeare said of Beatrice, ''like a lapwing . . .
close by the ground''.

WHY did Bonnie Prince Charlie -- when he kitted himself out after the
debacle of Culloden in stockings, petticoat, bonnet, dress, and shawl
and camped it up as maidservant Betty Burke -- bring such realism to the
role? Cynics and damned Hanoverians might suggest that Charlie was a bit
of a darlin' anyway. The truth, however, may be more intriguing.
Try this for size. The likelihood is that he learned the art of
disguise from his faither, the Old Pretender, James VIII. Examining the
collapse of the Stuart fortunes last week we joined the glittering state
visit to Scotland by James VI in 1616. What a contrast with the
secretive, rough and ready journey across northern France undertaken by
his great-grandson, James, in 1715 on his way to spearhead the abortive
Fifteen uprising.
Accompanied only by his secretary O'Flanagan and a gentleman called St
Paul, ''his Majesty's valet du chambre'', the little party took fully a
week to travel from Lorraine where he was in exile to the Channel coast,
criss-crossing the back lanes in attempting to cover its tracks. It was
the beginning of November and the rough, rural byways were already
underwater.
In O'Flanagan's diaries we learn that the route from Annecy took them
past Troyes, Pavillon, and Trois Maisons, but negotiating a dense forest
the coach ''broke into pieces'' and James had to shoulder his baggage
and march a full league to the next town. They secured another coach but
skirting Paris on the back roads the new coach overturned twice, then on
the network of country lanes the party became totally lost.
Bruised and more than a little bewildered, the Old Pretender (actually
still in his twenties at this point) then planned the final sprint for
the coast and the boat for Scotland, knowing that the main routes
through Rouen, Alencon, and Evreux would be watched.
But what of the ''theatricals''? At an inn they met an Englishman and
fearing they had aroused suspicion rose at first light and made for
Rouen. This may have been over-cautious because at this point James was
dressed as an abbe, a French priest, and O'Flanagan notes: ''The King
was so well disguised that even his closest friends would not have known
him.''
On November 4 the disguises were altered again and the three
companions set off on the last leg dressed as officers of a regiment
they knew was currently stationed in Lower Normandy. The weather was
atrocious as the approached Caen and their spirits were not raised by
dining at a dilapidated inn where the cider was ''rotten''. His Majesty
was often ''wet to the skin, his boots full of water'' and on one
occasion when his horse sank deep into a bog James just succeeded in
freeing his feet but was ''all over dyrted''. The ultimate humiliation
came when at a post-house the patron decided to give his only spare room
to a group of carters instead of to the royal party.
O'Flanagan, a bit of a fan as you might expect, praised James for his
even temper during this adventure. Apparently the Old Pretender was
prepared to rise at 5am on the cruellest of winter's mornings, and was
satisfied with the worst diets and most humble of lodgings.
And to be fair to his son, the Bonnie Prince, in 1746 he did ask Flora
MacDonald if, once disguised as Betty Burke, he could stick a couple of
pistols up his jouks for security, but had to content himself, we're
told, with a short, heavy cudgel.

John Fowler and illustrator Mark McLellan throw stones at the popular
portrayal of the Asteroid Belt.
ONE of the best edge-of-the-seat episodes in The Empire Strikes Back
has the starship Millennium Falcon whizzing through an asteroid field.
Great jagged lumps of rock come hurtling towards it and only Han Solo's
skilful piloting prevents disaster. All this with the fighters from
Darth Vader's Empire on his tail as well.
Can the location of this spectacular chase be the Asteroid Belt, the
great swathe of asteroids situated between Mars and Jupiter? If so, the
film makers got it wrong -- and so did robot C-3PO, who remarks
unhelpfully at the start of the chase that the odds against getting
safely through are 3720 to one. Don't bet on it. On this evidence C-3PO
isn't going to make a fortune on the gee-gees.
In fact, unlike the frenzied universe of The Empire Strikes Back,
asteroids are pretty thinly scattered through the Asteroid Belt. Even
so, when the space probes set off there was speculation among scientists
about the chances of them being damaged in collision with an asteroid.
Fortunately they didn't smack into any.
Asteroids are lumps of space debris, mainly rock. Some people think
the Asteroid Belt is the shattered remains of a tenth planet in our
solar system which somehow came to grief. Yet the total mass of all this
debris is less than the moon's. Most asteroids are lonely objects in
deep space, as shown in Mark McLellan's illustration. If you happened to
be sitting perched on top of such an asteroid you'd be lucky to have
another in sight.
Beyond the asteroid hovers a distant galaxy. Galaxies come in
countless numbers, but perhaps this one is ours -- in which case
somewhere within it shines the faint star that is our sun and the tiny
pinpoint of our earth.
Planets worth looking out for this month are Mars, visible for most of
the night, and Venus, still shining brightly in the morning, though low
on the horizon. As the days get longer, Venus fades in competition with
the rising sun.
The chosen constellation for March is the Crab. None of the stars in
the Crab is particularly bright, but look out for the two clusters M44
(called the Beehive) and M67 (which hasn't a name). The initial M, by
the way, doesn't mean there are motorways in space. It derives from the
French astronomer Charles Messier who drew up a list of the brighter
objects in the sky in 1781.
Both M44 and M67 are open clusters, formed by groups of stars
spattered widely in space -- unlike globular clusters which are formed
by many stars in such tight formation that they appear to us as blurred
spheres.
The Beehive is visible to the naked eye on clear nights, and the
keen-eyed observer may even be able to detect M67 unaided. But both are
best seen with binoculars, which will bring a whole cluster into clear
view. A telescope, on the other hand, because of its high magnification,
will bring only a part of each cluster into focus at one time.

MURRAYFIELD. A structure so magnificent it could be the home of the
country's national sport.
The only problem is the location; it is in the wrong place. It is in
Edinburgh, so Craig Brown's lads, the national football team, are
waiting for Hampden to be refurbished fully.
However, 67,500 mostly genuine sports fans -- every occasion,
unfortunately, has its quota of undesirables, the freeloaders and
corporate clients -- will be pulled towards Murrayfield this afternoon
and fill it with a passion that can act like a gelling agent.
It can mould any number of disparate souls into one body that rises
and sags like some huge, powerful beast.
Nothing can bring so many people together like sport, and the
attraction is more potent when national pride is at stake. Indeed, the
sporting arena offers just about the only platform on which we can
proclaim our Scottishness; but that's a different story altogether.
The point about this one is that today could be another of those
occasions when Scots might be entitled to strut their stuff. We don't
often have the opportunity.
Time was, you see, when the Scottish Football Association's side could
command the nation to rise in support and man the terracings in a show
of solidarity capable of bridging the religious divide that casts a
shadow across the people's game. But over the last decade, passion for
the national team has waned.
If the round ball is not entirely burst yet, it has a slow puncture.
Life is hissing out of the game.
National team manager Brown and the SFA will preach otherwise, but
don't you listen to them. They are no longer on the same wavelength as
the fans.
They are out of touch with the streets, and probably because remnants
of the so-called Tartan Army continue to trudge along on foreign
assignments, don't realise the extent of the country's disillusionment.
They probably don't realise that the slow, menacing walk taken by
David Sole and his team-mates one Saturday afternoon five years ago made
something stir deep within the psyche of the country's football
supporters.
They recognised the depth of desire among these rugby players. It
matched their own, which a growing number felt was being wasted on the
football side.
Sole did it to unnerve the English, but his march also did more to
persuade the football fan that here was another sport and sportsmen
worthy of their attention.
Football's adminstrators may not even be aware that their people will
be inside Hampden, Easter Road, Rugby Park, Fir Park, and Firhill today
with radios pressed against ears listening to the sounds from Edinburgh.
They need a Scottish victory every bit as much as all those who will
be inside Murrayfield.
It doesn't matter that the audiences will be divided by more than
miles -- the greatest distance will be in class -- the cause is common.
Scotland are at work and the adrenalin is coursing.
The day Scotland won the grand slam, football was being played and I
was reporting on St Mirren against Rangers.
But while Terry Butcher, Richard Gough, Ally McCoist et al were going
about their business, everyone in the stadium wanted news from the
rugby.
When word filtered through that Scotland had won, a roar so loud
carried around Love Street that the players looked up.
No happening on the pitch generated greater noise or excitement;
football should have been alarmed by that.
All around the country, football fans were concerned with another
sport because they were seeking to identify with Scottish success on a
level denied them by their own national team.
Football fans come from a different background, and most aren't really
interested in rubbing shoulders with the rugger chaps
The football person would rather have a drink in the pub or polish off
a carry-out than picnic in the car parks. That's far too twee, and more
than a little insane given our climate, wouldn't you say?
It is this sort of nonsense, this ludicrous example of the pretentious
at play, that makes it difficult for the football fan to embrace rugby,
give it the benefit of the doubt.
But today is different. Hopefully, it will be as different as it was
two weeks ago in Paris.
So what exactly is it about a Scottish rugby side that can grab the
attention of so many? After all, hardly anyone bothers with club
matches, and please, don't give me any of that baloney about rugby fans
preferring to play rather than watch.
If rugby's press coverage was in proportion to the numbers who attend
league games, it would be confined to the briefs at the bottom of the
page along with synchronised swimming.
People simply don't turn up in significant numbers, yet come
international day they appear in droves.
I have this theory which I'd like to share with you. I think the
Scottish rugby fans are actually Partick Thistle supporters.
Well, of course, Thistle sometimes look as though they are playing
rugby, but it's deeper than that.
You see, Thistle's fans are seen in small numbers on normal match
days, but come the big game, The Occasion, they appear from everywhere.
No other club in the world can have so many supporters who never
actually show up on regular match days. Are they the same people who
also claim to be rugby fans whenever Scotland have a big game?
Perhaps rugby commands so much attention come The Big Event because so
many have given up on the SFA's team.
Rugby may offer more chance of success, even though the national side
had struggled until the start of the Five Nations Championship.
Perhaps rugby feeds basic instincts, the need to see violent
confrontation. No, can't be that simple. If it were, the Airdrie
football side of a couple of years ago would have been the best
supported team in the country.
Maybe it is best just to go along with whatever it is that makes us
all want to be part of any rugby success in the international arena.
Why try to analyse a good thing? Besides, the findings might not be
easy to handle.
What if it were discovered that rugby was a more intricate,
compelling, and much more beautiful game than football? What if
Murrayfield did become the national sport's headquarters?
Never. I'm just being a scaremonger. Rugby couldn't break football's
hold on the people. Could it?

Bill Caven could easily be hooked for life on the sleek
and stylish Merc that has just about everything
THE gleaming machine had barely glided to a graceful halt outside the
ramshackle family pile in deepest darkest suburbia than the rumour
machine was in full flow. Won the lottery, he has, or was it the
football pools? Probably both, in fact.
While I hate to disappoint, sadly, nothing could be further from the
truth. OK, I'll admit that I did have a little success in the Saturday
night flutter. But before the begging letters start to arrive,
definitely nothing near enough to make the Mercedes-Benz E320 Cabriolet
a permanent feature in the Caven driveway. To be perfectly truthful, for
once, the lottery winnings were barely enough to make even the smallest
dent on the petrol gauge when it came to replenishing the beast.
Nevertheless, such remains the allure of a Merc that it can still
cause a fair degree of intrigue and tongue-wagging among family and
neighbours when one rolls up rather unsuspectingly, albeit for a
temporary stay.
Even more so when it also happens to be the exhilarating 320 Cabriolet
that simply oozes class and style from every inch of its magnificent
frame. Drive this for a couple of days and you'll be dangerously hooked
and spoiled for life.
Whether it be the ballistic performance, opulent interior, or
commanding appearance, this car has the lot and much more. The major
drawback is that it also comes with a price-tag capable of turning your
hair grey instantly. Before you add a few homely touches, such as
electrically adjustable front seats, anti-theft system, AMG alloy sports
wheels, and infra-red remote locking, the bill is a mere #48,500. The
extras add a further #5000.
Granted it is a small fortune and largely outwith the budget of most
folk. But those fortunate enough to have that colour of money washing
about in their Swiss bank account can take some comfort in the fact that
their car is virtually exclusive and more than capable of turning heads.
The Cabriolet is, in fact, a full four-seater with more than a
thousand parts redesigned to give it remarkable rigidity. Like all its
stable-mates in the E-class, the car has a sleeker, lower look.
Thicker glass has been incorporated to reduce noise levels and, while
relatively successful, there is a noticeable whistle, particularly for
rear passengers when the car is driven at high speed.
Unlike many of its competitors, the Merc retains its sleek profile
when the soft top is raised. At the touch of a single button, the roof
is stowed away behind its own special metal cover, totally
automatically. A draught-preventing windshield is also deployed to
ensure maximum interior comfort for the driver and his passengers when
the car goes alfresco. The rear head restraints also act as roll-over
bars.
Safety has always been an important feature in any of the German car
maker's models. The E320 is no different, and sensors will activate the
roll-over bar in a fraction of a second should the vehicle be in danger
of overturning.
Such a nightmare scenario hardly bears thinking about, and it is a
fair bet that most Merc Cabriolet owners, having forked out a king's
ransom to own one, are unlikely to place the vehicle in such a position.
That, of course, is not to say that the car can't pack a punch. The
3.2 litre fuel-injected six cylinder unit can propel you to a top speed
of more than 140mph should you require to get there yesterday.
However, to appreciate fully the finer points of this car, and there
are plenty, a much more leisurely pace is advised. But it is comforting
nevertheless to know that there is plenty of oomph under the bonnet
should it be necessary to put the pedal to the metal.
Despite its size and weight, the car handles easily, the
power-steering making even the tightest parking spot manageable. All of
which leaves more time to wallow in the sumptuous leather-clad cockpit
and the rich walnut wood trim surrounds.

Border crossings can still be fraught but are as nothing compared to
the amazing ancient treasures and new experiences that the Middle East
has in store. Jill Crawshaw packs 3000 years of history into a one-week
trek from Jordan to Jerusalem.
THERE was a chill desert wind blowing dust between the coils of barbed
wire and the menacing but empty watchtowers when our Jordanian taxi
driver dropped us in the early morning at the Aqaba/Eilat border; no
vehicles are allowed to cross, so we picked up our suitcases and set
off.
First, the Jordanian border controls; passport, luggage scrutinised,
permits, passes, departure tax. Then a brief, bleak no-man's land where
we met visitors dragging their luggage towards us from the opposite
direction.
A casually dressed but sharp-eyed Israeli girl stopped us at her
frontier, and we go through the whole rigmarole again -- several bags
are opened, searched and then searched again. Five yards from the final
fence, we're sent back for another document to be stamped.
And at last, after an hour, we walk into Israel from Jordan. It's an
emotional moment -- most of us weren't born in 1946, when this crossing
was last possible. Then, Aqaba was a town of only 500 souls, and Eilat
didn't even exist.
We were the pioneers of a name-dropper's tour par excellence, due to
start at the end of February, flying into the Jordanian capital, Amman,
to view the stupendous treasures of this friendly little kingdom, then
crossing the newly opened frontier into Israel, returning home from Tel
Aviv.
In all, about 3000-plus years of history, three seas, two capitals, a
couple of tourist wonders of the world, beach resorts and the Old
Testament as a guidebook, all within a week. And if the fragile peace
holds (which almost everyone is determined that it should), and develops
further, the Middle East holiday playground, with its combination of the
greater sights of Lebanon, Syria, Egypt as well as Jordan and Israel,
offers a mouthwatering prospect to visitors.
For the moment, though, we're starting in the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan which is the ideal beginners' Arabia, an easy and manageable
introduction to the Middle East. Its attractions are in the world's top
league, with sites such as Petra and Jerash, scorching Biblical
landscapes, Bedouins, a Red Sea resort and a wholly agreeable capital.
Excellent roads, good hotels, superb food at modest prices as well as a
wide command of English -- but above all a feeling of genuine welcome --
make the attractions easily and comfortably accessible.
There's a confident, prosperous air about Amman, where most visitors
arrive by air. Despite its clean, white, cubist, modern appearance, its
roots go back to the Rabbath Ammon, the capital of the Ammonite Kingdom,
renamed Philadelphia in the Greco-Roman era -- ancient walls are even
now being excavated on Citadel Hill, just above the heart of the city,
where a 5000-seat Roman theatre competes for attention with a modern
park, and the souks and hubbub of a traditional Arab town.
For me, the stalls won as I was lured into the alleys by the flash of
gold jewellery, and the smells of roasting nuts and bitter coffee. I
sipped mint tea at a pavement cafe and idly gazed at the various stalls.
There was no hassling to buy, and mercifully those whispered inuendos
and taunts to which Western women are often subjected were also missing.
''We would consider such behaviour very bad manners,'' says Nelly, who
along with her businessman husband, Samir, entertained us at the El
Bustan restaurant to a dazzling lunchtime mazza -- an array of a dozen
dishes, including metabal, a charcoaled aubergine dip, taboulet, minced
parsley, onion and tomatoes, and kobbeh, fried minced meatballs.
The family are a typical Jordanian mix -- Nelly, Egyptian and Greek,
Samir a Christian Palestine Arab, formerly from Jerusalem, and as
fervent about the peace as every other Jordanian we met.
A new motorway leads north out of Amman, and on its unfinished verges
and roundabouts, Muslims in their traditional head-dress -- the red and
white kuffiyah from Jordan, black and white for Palestinians -- knelt in
prayer as we sped on our 40-minute journey to Jerash, the former Pompeii
of the East, that flourished until about 400 A D as a major trading
centre on the caravan route to Palmyra. On its graceful colonnaded main
street, the smooth flagstones are indented with deep ruts from chariots.
Jerash was linked on the trade route to an even greater city further
south -- the mountain wilderness of Petra, hewn out of the rock by the
formerly Nomadic Nabatean Arabs, who gloriously embellished their city
over 500 years, the Romans later adding their own necessities for
civilised living.
As trade moved elsewhere, the city fell into decline and lay abandoned
and buried in the sand for nearly 2000 years, until it was rediscovered
in 1812 by the young Swiss explorer, Johann Burckhardt.
With the opening of the nearby border with Israel, Petra is being
rediscovered yet again, this time with a vengeance, by a flood of
tourists -- up to 3000 a day in the peak season in March. As a result,
entrance fees have been raised since January to a hefty #20, and there
are plans to limit daily entry to 1500 visitors, as recommended by
Unesco.
The most dramatic preparation for the splendours of Petra is to
approach it from Amman down the 120-mile Kings' Highway, the former
route of camel caravans laden with silks and spices from the Gulf,
frankincense and myrrh from Southern Arabia, slaves and ivory from
Africa. Roman soldiers regularly used it, as did later, the Crusaders
fighting over their faith.
You can gaze out over the rumpled hills as Moses did over the Promised
Land from Mount Nebo, where excavations are currently in the progress to
find his tomb, and you can take a detour into ancient Machaerus, where
Salome danced for Herod and demanded the head of John the Bapist.
Even after several visits, the pulse inevitably quickens as the final
signpost reads: Petra. It is immediately apparent that the town outside
has mushroomed; so have the ''horseboys'' who are queuing up to take
tourists into the site, rather like taxi drivers at an international
airport.
Then the pony plunges from the sunlight into deep shadows of the siq
-- the mile-long narrow cleft between the rocks that is the only way
into the hidden city. This desert Eldorado gradually comes into focus at
the end of the siq -- first a column, then a frieze, finally the whole
of the 130 foot high Treasury, carved entirely from the rockface.
You need at least two days to explore Petra, whose remains are
scattered over a square mile or so, some only reached the gruelling
climbs. Tombs, temples, and theatres, burial chambers and banqueting
halls, aqueducts and baths, monumental staircases and markets -- a
glorious jumble unfolds, exuberantly carved and decorated as if its
ancient architects were determined to compete with the profligacy of the
natural sculptures in the fretted and fissured rocks around it.
The steepest climbs show different faces of Petra. Even the hawks were
soaring below as we scrambled past the lairs of hermits to the Deir
Monastery, a massive facade almost into the heavens, and not much lower
than the newest face of St Paul's. A much darker side of civilisation is
revealed in the High Place of Sacrifice, where a channel runs from the
altar for the blood of its victims, some of them almost certainly human.
The late afternoon has mercifully lost some of its heat, as the
Bedouin horseboys competed vociferously for the last stragglers, but
that's the best time of all to view Petra's great technicolour
spectacular -- when the multi-hued rocks look as though a drunken
painter has been let loose among them, reflecting the pinks, golds, and
fiery reds of the setting sun.
The most quoted description, ''the rose-red city'', is in fact more
appropriate for the towering cliffs that surround the desert outpost of
Wadi Rhum, the next treat on our itinerary.
You can stay in Wadi Rhum -- either in a black camel-hair Bedouin tent
or a small bell-tent, and there are few other concessions to tourists.
Over lunch at the Rest House, there's a demonstration of weaving, and
local music is played over a crackling loudspeaker. The famous Arab
Legion, still stationed at the tiny toytown crenallated fort,
courteously allow visitors to enter -- their job is now to patrol the
Saudi Arabian desert border, and to keep peace between the 3000 or so
Bedouin in the area.
Only 20 minutes away, Aqaba, Jordan's only port on its ten precious
miles of Red Sea coastline, seems as genteel as a Victorian seaside
resort with its trim promenade lined with palms and holiday hotels, its
square with souvenir stalls and travel agencies offering excursions.
The beach is sandy, though nothing special, and on a tour I'd rate the
resort worth two days, unless you're a keen diver -- the snorkelling and
scuba-diving is superb.
But Aqaba is more than a resort; it is a border town where we may
cross, though we have to say goodbye to our driver and the gentle
Mohammet, our guide, who as yet are not allowed to accompany us across
the frontier. On the other side, the blue and white Israeli flags
flutter in welcome, and hastily erected hoardings advertise the
attractions of Eilat, that mirrors Aqaba across the Gulf.
The opening up and development of this strip of barren desert is of
tremendous importance for both countries; the current talk is of a
much-needed joint international airport, and even a joint pipeline to
carry water from the Red Sea to the dwindling Dead Sea, whose production
of minerals is crucial for the economies of both countries.
All this our new young Israeli guide, Isaac, tells us with hope and
enthusiasm as he whisks us pretty smartly through Eilat; the resort's
main claim to historical fame is as the site of the first-ever recorded
state visit when Solomon welcomed the Queen of Sheba there, but if there
were any mementoes, the bulldozers got there first.
Twentieth-century Eilat is an ultra-modern year-round holiday
playground rivalling the Canaries and Madeira -- and which luckily
happens to have more wonders beneath the sea than above it, plus some
great historic sites within easy reach.
It is to one of the most amazing of these that Isaac next took us --
built and fortified as an impregnable fortress for King Herod on a flat
hilltop above the Dead Sea, Masada and its history capture the
imagination and emotion perhaps more than any other Israeli site.
You can make the ascent by cable-car or set off up the Snake Path that
rises gradually up the strange moonscape of the Judean desert. Masada
covers a huge area, with granaries, water cisterns, baths, and mosaics,
and has stupendous views from its walls where young Israeli
schoolchildren picnic under the ever-watchful eyes of armed guards.
It's the story behind the fortress that brings Israeli youth on its
pilgrimage; how a handful of zealots took over Masada after Herod around
73 A D and held out against 5000 or so of the crack Roman Tenth Legion
who besieged it for nearly a year. The Jews chose to die rather than
surrender, and when the last Roman broke through their defences, they
found smoking ruins and dead bodies -- only two women were alive to tell
the tale.
From Masada we continued our Middle East Odyssey along the fringes of
the Dead Sea where, even though there's a full-scale health resort, and
the waters are undoubtedly beneficial, they feel salty, sticky, and
unrefreshing.
We had only a glimpse of Qumran and the cave where the Dead Sea
Scrolls were discovered by a shepherd looking for a lost ewe, but we
passed safely and unthreatened through the lovely green oasis of the
newly autonomous Palestine city of Jericho.
At last we came in sight of the lights of Jerusalem, the shadows of
skyscrapers deepening on the horizon, dark Bedouin tents scattered over
the hills in the foreground.
There was only one day left of our journey, and the prospect of
Jerusalem was almost daunting; we had the trappings of three major
religions to tackle, the most famous and fought-over walled city in the
world to explore, a modern Israeli capital to rediscover, plus a side
trip to Bethlehem.
In the midst of such a surfeit of riches, as so often, it was the
small details that made the most lingering impressions -- the scent of
hyacinths and mimosa in the tranquillity of the Gardens of Gethsemane;
the bleached white tombs of the Jews facing the Muslim tombs just
outside the walls, both waiting for the Last Judgment.
There are scratches in the Herodian pavements that were games played
by Roman soldiers to while away their guard duty at the Praetoria where
Jesus was held captive. And the donkeys that still carry water to the
open stalls in the old quarter, brought the Bible to everyday life, even
more so than the rich adornments in the great churches and mosques.
Our travel company, Jasmin Tours, has called this new tour ''The Road
To Peace''. At the end of your visit, Jerusalem seemed an appropriate
place to pray for its fulfilment.

FRENCH actress Estelle Skornik -- better known as Nicole from the
Renault car adverts -- may have to trade in her beloved Clio . . . for a
van to transport her fan mail.
The beauty has been bombarded with a flood of love letters and other
mail following the screening of Renault's latest ad on our televisions.
One man even went to the length of writing poetry.
Estelle admitted: ''I am very flattered by the kind thoughts of the
British men, especially the man who sent me the poetry.''
The ''love affair'' has certainly paid handsome dividends for Renault,
making the Clio a top-selling car in the United Kingdom for the last few
years.
* TAKE a quick squint at the parking spaces occupied by Britain's top
bosses, and the likelihood is that they will be occupied to a great
extent by German cars.
A survey by the UK's largest company car-leasing operator, Cowie
Interleasing, has revealed that the captains of industry are now tending
to favour Mercedes and BMW.
However, despite the increased competition, Jaguar, traditionally the
number one choice at this level, remains in pole position jointly with
Mercedes.
* WITH frosty winter mornings now upon us, still around, the RAC is
urging drivers not to dice with ice. Its target are the many motorists
who set off from home peering through small holes in frost-covered
windscreens while waiting for warm air from the heater to clear the
screen.
The RAC says that this is not just illegal, but extremely dangerous,
and is urging drivers to take a few extra minutes to clear their windows
completely of frost and ice.
RAC spokeswoman Sue Nicholson explained: ''It is a great temptation
when the weather is cold to get the car started and let the windows
clear as the journey progresses.
''But this is very dangerous, and anything that obscures a motorist's
vision is a hazard. This is one hazard that takes only a few moments to
avoid.''
* MOTORCYCLES are bouncing back into fashion, according to latest
figures which reveal that the industry has boosted sales by almost 10%
in the past year.
The bike companies are hopeful that the revival will continue during
the coming 12 months, as more and more people appreciate the benefits,
both financially and as a leisure activity, of two-wheeled ''motoring''.

THINK of Wales at Murrayfield and you think of giant leeks. And Max
Boyce.
Whatever happened to Max Boyce, I can hear you ask. Max Boyce is alive
and well and very likely this morning having a pint at Hawick Trades
rugby club before heading off for the match.
The amiable Welsh comedian is president of the rugby club from his
home town of Glynneath in South Wales.
For the past 35 years, Glynneath have had a reciprocal relationship
with Hawick Trades (one of the feeder clubs for the big Hawick team).
This involves visiting at international time, mauling each other about
a bit on the pitch, then retiring to the bar for a song or three. A spot
of golf is also usually on the agenda.
When Max was nabbed for This Is Your Life, the deed was done after a
Glynneath-Hawick Trades match; Kenny McCartney, the international
referee, was conspirator in chief.
Time was when Max Boyce was never off our TV screens. We saw him in
concert, on chat shows, even popping up on Grandstand on one occasion
with a song about an Irish referee whose apparent blindness had cost
Wales victory over England the week before.
He made nine TV series, sold two million albums, and topped the
bestsellers' list with his book I Was There. He is no longer flavour of
the month with the TV bosses but is doing very nicely, thank you,
playing to packed houses all over Britain.
He is taking two nights off from his current six-week tour for the
Murrayfield weekend. His Hawick weekend sits in between concerts in
Manchester and London. Not included on the Hawick trip is Max's famous
leek.
At nine-foot tall, the Boyce leek requires a seat to itself on
airplanes. He says: ''This is leek number three I'm on to at the moment.
''One was left in Australia and the other became so decrepit it
disintegrated. The third leek is beginning to look a bit battered as
well.''
Max and leek have journeyed all over the world. California to
Kathmandu, he says. By sheer chance, much of his work itinerary happens
to coincide with games of rugby.
As luck would have it, Max has six concerts arranged for South Africa
during the Rugby World Cup later this year.
Scotland is not on the list for his current tour, but he will be back
in October. He still has a considerable following up here and is proud
of the fact that his version of Jack and the Beanstalk panto broke box
office records at His Majesty's Theatre in Aberdeen.
The Listener wrote of Max Boyce: ''He is uproariously and happily
unique. He has the ability to 'codi hwyl' -- to create the magic that
heightens to an art form the fervour that attends his nation's other
religion, rugby football.
''In his material, the qualities that show through most are utter lack
of spite or bitterness and a tremendous sense that, however sad life may
be at times, happiness invariably wins.''
To put it another way, he is a jolly nice chap who loves rugby. ''I
was thrilled by the Scottish victory at the Parc des Princes,'' he says,
and wishes Scotland all the best.
The niceness doesn't quite extend to hoping Scotland win the Grand
Slam. But if Wales continue their run of defeats at Murrayfield, well,
you couldn't lose to nicer people, he says.

PRAY for surf: the king of the rambunctious electric guitar lives.
Nearly everyone will have heard Dick Dale's big, boss guitar in the past
three months without registering who Dick Dale is. And who is Dick Dale?
And where is it that have we have heard him without realising we are
hearing him?
Many of us have heard Dick Dale kick-starting Quentin Tarantino's Pulp
Fiction on screen and on a multi-million-selling soundtrack album.
Underpinning the movie's opening stick-up sequence is the breakneck
Miserlou, a track Dick created in 1961 with his Del-Tones. The same
track, featuring Dick's unmistakable snarling, rumbling guitar, has also
been pressed into service by the BBC's sports desk as a means of
advertising their coverage of the Five Nations Rugby Championship.
Dick Dale music: it's the epitome of raw power; rude primal
thrustings; sheer excitement; unstoppable force meeting immovable
object. And later this month it will be available in Britain in live
form as never before when its creator ventures out of his native America
for the first time in his 57 years.
As to who Dick Dale is, it is best to say that Dick Dale is many
people. Dick Dale was born Richard Monsour in Beirut in 1938. Raised on
the coast of southern California, Richard Monsour assumed the persona of
Dick Dale, along the way becoming the owner of a record shop and a
record label; a full-time surfer; the guitarist who was contracted by
the Fender company to road-test their amplifiers to destruction.
There was also Dick Dale, leader of a Los Angeles chapter of the
Hell's Angels, the Sultans. And there was Dick Dale, drag-race star.
Most importantly, somewhere at the end of the 1950s, Dick Dale invented
a whole pop genre: surfing music.
Many followed notably in Dick's wake, not the least of whom were the
Surfaris, Jan and Dean, and, of course, the Beach Boys, all of whom
achieved chart success that never accrued in the sixties to Dick Dale.
But where Jan and Dean and the Wilson clan simply sang songs that evoked
the surf, Dick Dale's wetly-reverbed guitar aimed to re-create the
physical thrill of standing atop a wave.
To be swamped by Dick Dale's whiplash double-picking is to hang 10 on
a bucking surfboard in the face of razor-sharp droplets of spume and
pounding walls of ocean spray.
Yet these days Dick Dale doesn't ride the crystal tunnel. ''Dick Dale
don't surf no more,'' Dick Dale says over the phone from what he calls
his sky-ranch, a hewn-by-hand 81-acre hideaway with its own airstrip,
2000ft above sea-level in California's Mojave desert.
''The water has been destroyed by the powermongers, assholes killing
the planet for our children with their tubs of mercury. Dick Dale nearly
lost a leg one time through an infection he picked up in the sea.''
Standing and looking out over 100 miles in every direction from his
isolated mountain-top eyrie near Joshua Tree National Park, Dick Dale
speaks of Dick Dale in the third person. Like I said, there are many
Dick Dales, and even Dick Dale has to keep a certain distance from them.
Unstoppable force; immovable object. And once Dick Dale the
conversationalist gets going, he's like a tidal surge.
Despite having staged a remarkable US chart comeback these past 18
months with his two most recent albums, Dick Dale has spent most of the
past 30 years communing with nature, walking in relative seclusion with
his personal menagerie of lions and tigers; his ocelots, apes, and
snakes. ''Animals give you no bullshit. If they like you, they'll lick
you. If they hate you, they'll eat you.
''Not like most earthlings. Earthlings are confused, insecure. And
some earthlings have no heritage: that's what leads them to kill each
other and rob 7-11 stores. That's what leads to trashy families and
drugs. Dick Dale don't do drugs. No booze. No red meat.
''I live like in the days of Daniel Boone, hauling water by hand. I
used to have two Rolls-Royces. Now I got one. It's got four flat tyres;
the trunk is open and a rat lives inside it. Dick Dale was built by the
people he surfed with. 'The King of the Surf Guitar', the people called
me that in the fifties. There were 17 of them to start with, and it grew
until I was playing to crowds of 4000.
''It's the same now . . . the grass roots. The power of the colleges,
the power of young people. Dick Dale has been an outcast who never
played the game, and now Twentieth Century Fox wants to use Nitro for a
movie, and so does Walt Disney . . . and Beavis and Butthead like Nitro
and they play the video all the way through, and we paid for that video
ourselves and we don't have no $30,000 promotional budget, and it's all
down to the grass roots, the young people in college who come to see my
shows, and when I meet them, they're wearing tribal masks and referring
to themselves as Dick-heads, and they tell me: 'Man, your music is
religious, powerful, spiritual . . . ' And I say to them: 'Music takes
no sides, and it should act like a giant hand and slap the politicians
across the face and tell them to wake up'.''
Ah, yes . . . er, quite. But why was Dick Dale away so long, and what
brought him back? Dick Dale doesn't tell me this, but part of the reason
Dick Dale was away so long was because he was battling against cancer.
He hadn't recorded in almost 30 years because ''nothing could capture
the sound of Dick Dale -- he was too loud.'' A chance invite , from a
journalist with a long and righteous memory, led to Dick Dale's first
show in San Francisco, a non-surf town, two years ago.
Having hauled his eight Fender Showman amps up there, Dick went down a
storm. An eight-times-louder-than-most-guitarists storm.
Records followed. The first, Tribal Thunder, was recorded in
three-and-a-half days. ''Some groups take six months and burn up a lot
of money. We found an engineer with no ego, and me and my wife, who's
also my roadie, and my young son, who's now three, we lived in the
studio till the record was finished. No bullshit; no games to play; no
fillers. I record everything like Dali painting for his life.''
After the next LP, Unknown Territory, recorded in three weeks, Dick
Dale found himself on top of the US college / alternative charts, ahead
of a whole lot of young bands with names he'd never heard. He played in
New York, where he was seen by Quentin Tarantino (''he called me the
good, the bad, and the ugly all rolled into one'').
He played sell-out tours on college campuses to ''skinheads,
tattooists, body-piercers, college professors with their seven-year-old
kids who are saying 'Gee, son, I saw Dick Dale the first time in 1961'
''.
Dick Dale actually began playing for pay in 1955. Along the way, he
spotted Jimi Hendrix playing bass with Little Richard in a bar. ''Jimi
asked me how I got my sound, he said it was like the screaming of
animals.''
How Dick Dale gets his sound has something to do with his left-handed,
upside-down, gold-painted, 40-year vintage Stratocaster -- ''the Beast,
it's gnarly'' -- and the vast marine-hawser gauge strings he uses on it,
steel strings he swears turn blue-purple from the heat generated when he
plays. He says the way he plays is like ''a drum, a machine gun, the
power of the jungle.''
Dick Dale's message for Britain? 'I've come to melt your ears. All
police leave has been cancelled . . . heh heh heh . . . ''
* Dick Dale is scheduled to appear on BBC2's Late Show on Tuesday,
March 28. On the same day, at London's Garage, he will be playing his
first-ever live gig outwith America, where his support band should by
rights be Glasgow's very own surf-rockers, the Beat Poets, who formed in
honour of Dick Dale in 1986, years before the rest of us discovered him.
While in Britain, Dick will play a second show at the Garage, on March
29, as well as being booked to record Radio 1 sessions for the John Peel
and Andy Kershaw programmes. Dick Dale's two most recent albums are on
the Hightone label. A compilation, King of the Surf Guitar, is available
on Rhino.

UNFORTUNATELY, there is an uncharitable attitude among some Scottish
supporters that the hoards of Welsh rugby fans who will have descended
on this green and pleasant land for a weekend of Bacchanalian pursuits,
and maybe even a pint or two, should have been left underground when
most of the coal mines and pits were closed in what they proudly call
the Principality.
The fact that those savage and often soured members of our race
readily concede that the pit ponies and any surviving canaries be
allowed to come up from the depth says volumes for the Scots'
world-renowned love of pit pones and canaries; no room and kitchen
should ever be without either.
Perhaps it is the strange Welsh habit of wanting to sing at the drop
of a hat or even the drop of an inebriated Scottish fan that has
nurtured this slight alienation. After all, we agree on most things. We
don't like the English, they hate the English.
To me, that seems the basis of a very strong friendship. Sadly, that
is not always so.
When the Scots visit Cardiff and when the pit ponies travel to God's
Own Country there are seldom problems. Perhaps the difficulty of finding
the gents' loo -- which the Welsh keep thinking we all keep at the
bottom of our garden -- has been one problem.
Then there is that singing. It can be annoying, very bloody annoying.
But it can also be very intimidating -- just look what it did to the
poor Zulu's at Rorkes Drift when the Welsh Fusiliers sang their way to
umpteen Victoria Crosses.
However, despite their pretentions of being the world's biggest choir,
despite the rotten beer they serve in Cardiff, the Welsh are always more
than welcome to visit a real country.
Their tribal trips every two years are something to look forward to .
. . especially if you stay in London.
To be serious, they are a nation who have produced some of the
greatest rugby players ever, some of the greatest rugby teams ever, and
despite that proud, proud heritage they suffer defeat with a dignity and
humour that the other mob over the border will never learn.
For the Welsh,t Murrayfield isn't just a trip, it's a mecca. It's not
a one or two-day quickie, it's a week-long invasion to frighten the
bravest of the brave.
They set up their choir rooms from places as far apart as the borders
to the kingdom of Fife, where no doubt thery can converse about pit
ponies without understanding a single word said in either quaint
dialect.
They are loved and respected wherever they decide to decamp . . . pit
ponies, canaries, and all.
But that is only just. The way they treat the many Scots who travel to
Wales on alternative years is superb. The Tartan tearaways go down in
busloads, with most clubs having fixed up two or three games for each
trip.
And because of the lack of a trained navigator, more than a few fail
to get back out of the hinterland till the main damage has been done at
Cardiff Arms Park.
Not that the Welsh marauders are any different. With the scarcity of
tickets, their request now is normally: ''Do you have five rooms that
can take 30 people, no, no dear, not in each room just between them.
''Great, do you one of those big screen televisions with seats for 30
people, and do you also have a microphone and loud speakers as some of
the boys fancy themselves as singers.
''One last thing, I don't suppose you might have any hay and bird
seed. You see, we always bring a few pit ponies and canaries with us.''
Welcome to Scotland, you're always welcome.

As retirement looms, a Highland
minister suffers in silence
while the piper plays. Then . . . .
John MacLeod tells the tale
THE skirl came, first faintly, and then with gathering confidence, the
piper's notes rising in the dusk of the glen and the township. Had you
been a tourist out for an evening stroll during a Highland tour, you
would have paused in pleasure and listened. But there were no tourists
at this time of year, and the people of Glenuig, such as remained, were
indoors.
Had you been a tourist out for that amble, you would have had romantic
notions of a Highland fireside at night; the telling of tales and yarns,
the making of music. But there were few enough of the old Highland stock
in Glenuig, and such as there were now knew all the joys of
civilisation. They were on the telephone to sisters in Glasgow and
cousins in England. They were watching videos that Mohammed rented from
the van. There were boys playing computer games, and older boys smoking
furtively by sheds, and older girls out to watch the older boys.
Perhaps they were not hearing the piper; and in any event they would
not have thought him a patch on Lisa Loeb, or maybe Megadeath. But if
you had been hearing the piper, and yourself that typical tourist, you
would have thought how fine it was, how Highland; and afterwards, at the
hotel, with your tour-mates from the coach, you would have spoken
confidently of ancient skill at the pibroch.
But there was one that would not have thought so. There was one frozen
by the door of a big house on the hill -- a big white empty house -- and
it a manse, and him a minister. He was the Rev Roddy behind his back and
Mr MacKillop to his face, and he was what the Daily Record would have
called a Wee Free minister, of the parish of Glenuig and its satellites;
and he was 78 years old, and shortly to retire.
He stood for a long, aghast moment between door and peat-shed, what
the Scotsman would call a dark pillar of Calvin, and near-rigid with
rage. To yourself, as we were saying, it would have been wonderful
music; but to the Rev Roddy it was the infernal wail of the Pit itself.
''Murder!'' he growled, which sounds even better in Gaelic; and then
with heavy tread he bore his fuel into the manse, and the panelled door
thudded on the night and Glenuig and the piper who tormented him.
The Rev Roddy had five weeks to go.
For 33 years he had been minister at Glenuig. For 33 years he had
given them the Law, and the Gospel, and a good measure on Christian
experience. He had married many a child he had baptised, and buried a
few of some he had married. At the Session, come Communion, he was a
formidable blend of warmth and rigour. At the Deacon's Court he had,
just once, thumped the table. Who had Tormod Mor thought he was anyway,
to say that the congregational Cortina was good for another decade of
pastoral visitation?
Once a month, save for their break in July, the Rev Roddy had gone by
the Bealach and the Lochganvich ferry to commune with the brethren of
the West Highland Presbytery. Once a year, he had taken a seat in the
Assembly. In 1978 he had been Moderator, and gone to a royal garden
party.
Every so often the Rev Roddy, with dark humour, persuaded his Session
to adjust the rota of services in line with new trends in population and
the comprehension of Gaelic.
For now, in his last days, he preached Gaelic at noon on the Sabbath
and English at night, except when there was a fifth Sabbath in the
month; and then the Rev Roddy preached Gaelic ''both ends''. But if he
had preached Gaelic ''both ends'', then there was no Tuesday night
meeting at Ardmore. Otherwise there was a Tuesday night meeting at
Ardmore, a Thursday night meeting at Lochganvich, and always the
Wednesday night meeting at Glenuig. There was also, once a month, a
Monthly meeting on Mondays in Glenuig. No-one knew why this meeting had
started. No-one could explain why it was continued. And no-one dared be
so unspiritual as to suggest it be discarded.
The Rev Roddy had earned his keep.
Glenuig had been his second, and final, charge. But he had gone about
Communions the length and breadth of Scotland. And had been called four
times to other places, and put off them all. He was at ease with all
ranks and classes of men, be they other ministers, teachers, fishermen,
civil servants; be they of the Church in Edinburgh, Lewis, Canada, or
West Africa.
The Rev Roddy disapproved of hymns, sitting to pray, standing to sing,
cremation, Freemasonry, the Pope, the Church of Scotland, dancing, the
cinema, the theatre, woman's trousers, and celebrating Christmas and
Easter.
He liked tobacco and the odd dram.
His two vices, for which the district loved him and of which gentle
affection he was entirely oblivious, were crazy driving and, very late
on a summer night, poaching sea-trout.
The Church disapproved of worldly music.
The piper, as winter thinned from ice to rain, and the days grudgingly
lengthened, grew in confidence.
Most evenings, from the street of New Glenuig, he skirled away. He
gave them slow airs and marches and reels. He milked the last pathos in
lament. Merry, if syncopated, were some of his more experimental tunes.
The Rev Roddy tried not to hear him: but, when he did, his brows
knitted and his eyes tightened.
He would go to make tea, and light his pipe, and mutter darkly.
The Rev Roddy had a week to go.
In a week's time the Presbytery would formally accept his retirement
and shake his hand and wish him well. There was to be a thing in the
Church hall, a presentation, a ''do''. In a fortnight or so, the manse
would be left and locked. He would be home to the little village in his
native island, back to the croft and the little boat. He would take the
dogs. He, not his second cousin, would be caring for the 20 sheep.
The Rev Roddy would condescend to do supply preaching once in a while.
The piper tormented him. He knew the fellow. Was the brother not an
elder? Was the piper himself not faithful in churchgoing? Having given
out a Psalm, the Rev Roddy would sit back and sing with the people; his
lips with them, his eyes balefully on the one who dared to make that
music.
The Communions were on: his last sacramental weekend. Elders and
members came from many districts. There were two new members. The Rev
Kenneth preached earnestly of sin. The Rev Donnie gave a corker of a
sermon on the Monday night, giving -- as he put it -- ''a faithful
witness for the distinctive testimony of the Church''. It was then the
Pope had it from him! And the Duke of Edinburgh!
That was a brave minister, thought the Rev Roddy. After all, the Pope
and the Duke of Edinburgh were scarcely likely to be present.
But the piper was at every service.
Not a toot came from him all the Communion, not from the Fast Day till
the Monday night, but on the Tuesday morning -- a morning! -- as the
ministers sipped elevenses in the manse, the fellow played again.
The Rev Roddy had a good colour on him -- he was yet tall, straight,
ruddy, if quite white in his close-cropped hair -- but, momentarily, he
blanched. He recovered. He resumed, with his old friend of student days,
recollections of the past. The war. Yes, he had been in the Seaforth
Highlanders. Yes, it was in 1945 he had gone in for the ministry. And it
had been in 1945 that the only woman he had ever cared for died in the
Invergordon Sanatorium; but he did not tell that to the Rev Murdo.
After lunch of fish, he drove the Rev Murdo out by the Bealach towards
the distant railway station. The Rev Roddy drove with customary vigour.
The Rev Murdo was a nervous passenger.
Round a tight bend, on the single-track road, the piper's little blue
van came hurtling towards them.
The Rev Roddy ignored the passing place.
The Rev Roddy ignored the second passing place.
The Rev Roddy hunched behind the wheel.
The brakes of the van of the piper squealed. And the piper, forced to
an undignified skidding halt on the verge, gazed back in wonder at the
receding congregational Sierra.
The Rev Murdo was doing a fair impression of a suffocating fish.
''Mr MacKillop,'' he gasped, most formal in his horror, ''Mr
MacKillop! Did you not see that man? Did you not see him leave the road
to avoid you?''
The minister of Glenuig permitted himself the lightest of chuckles.
''He was wise.''
The last night had come.
It was still, barely, light. The Rev Roddy was striding through the
township. All was quiet. They were inside with their godless videos. He
had a wee television set himself, mind you. It occurred to him, with the
big cheque from the night before, that he could actually now afford a
godless video machine himself.
The thought amused him.
The piping did not.
For weeks he had tried to ignore the sliding, wailing, wobbly notes
that so affronted him.
Now his bags were packed, most of the tea-chests away, and they had
even made him a present of the congregational Sierra. (''After all,''
someone had whispered to Tormod Mor at the Deacon's Court, ''it's now on
its seventh clutch.'')
But there was one last piece of unfinished business for the Rev
Roderick MacKillop. He was nearly there, his fingers drumming
insistently on the shaft of his furled umbrella . . .
Memories and voices, faces, tunes; a bouncing kilt. St Valery. The
camp in Germany . . . That screeching!
When he flung the door open the piper almost swooned in embarrassment
and horror.
''Minister . . . ''
The Rev Roddy loomed, large and black, the white of his collar like a
reproach to all darkness.
He savoured the moment.
''Give me those pipes!''
It was a roar that had jerked hearers from sleep, rattled pulpit
lamps, impelled dogs to instant obedience, and even reduced Tormod Mor
to a semblance of servility. And this piper was as them all before it.
Bag, drones, chanter were passed wordlessly.
And the Rev Roddy hoisted them, and filled them, and blew with the
confidence he had never lost; played them rhythmic and true, as they
should have been played all winter. And Glenuig rang with the grand
music from an old piper of the Seaforth Highlanders.

The south-west of England is making a concerted effort to woo Scots
holidaymakers as Deirdre Chapman reports.
IN 1993, the last complete year for which figures have been finalised,
74 million holiday trips were made by British residents within Britain,
nine million in Scotland, according to The UK Tourist: Statistics, 1993.
That adds up to a lot of people moving around and spending money,
which may explain the dozens of enthusiastic brochures put out by
tourist boards eager to coax us to explore their particular charms.
Right now, the very south-west of England, around Devon and Cornwall, is
pushing hard, eager to attract Scots to the opposite end of Britain. So
what has it to offer? Here are some travellers' checks:
Plymouth is a sea city. Its wide harbour and shipyards, once a great
Royal Naval base, now largely full of merchant shipping and hundreds of
leisure craft, are a must by boat. On the Hoe, Drake finished his game
of bowls before confronting the Spanish Armada; at the harbour are steps
the Pilgrim Fathers used; and the Dome is a journey from Elizabethan
Plymouth to the hard days of the Blitz. No surprise that, in 1995, the
town has many events commemorating the Second World War.
The English Riviera. The beautiful bay, east of Plymouth, earns its
name from a warm climate, palm trees, exotic gardens, and a deep blue
sea. Torquay, Paignton, and the old fishing village of Brixham among
them probably have more visitors and entertainment than anywhere else.
The North Devon Coast has Bideford Bay, a huge stretch of water. Below
the cliffs are the yellow beaches at Woolacombe, Croyde, and Taunton.
The Torridge and Taw estuaries are home to interesting birds.
Exmoor, Dartmoor, and Bodmin. The heather hills and steep secret
valleys of Exmoor, with their farms, slope down towards the North Devon
coast and provide long views over to Wales. This is Lorna Doone country,
with red deer and Exmoor ponies.
Dartmoor is 700 square miles of upland and valley, between Plymouth,
Okehampton, and Exeter. It is excellent walking, rock-climbing, fishing,
and horse-riding country. Much smaller and undeservedly less well known
is Bodmin moor to the west of Dartmoor, with rock summits to its hills
and areas full of legend and pre-history.
The West Coast is one of the most famous coasts in Britain, its great
Atlantic rollers bringing in the surf-boarders by the hundreds. Also
fine, open beaches, cliffs with caves, Newquay -- the centre of 11 fine
beaches over seven miles of coast -- and lovely small fishing harbours.
Southernmost of All. England ends at the Penwith and Lizard
Peninsulas, on which are Land's End, and a huge satellite tracking
station and the Lizard Lighthouse respectively. Small towns include
Penzance, always lively with its famous promenade, the artists' town of
St Ives, the most popular in Cornwall and, further inland, Truro,
Falmouth, and St Austell.
Exmouth, Exeter, Ottery St Mary. North of Tor Bay, Exmouth is the
entrance to the River Ex, with an expanse of two miles of golden sand
edging the esplanade. This is beautiful countryside leading north along
the estuary to the old port of Exeter, with an elegant cathedral. Nearby
is the start of the M5 north, which skirts Ottery St Mary, another
historic town on the River Otter, with a weir and old mill. It still has
the parish boundaries set by Edward the Confessor in 1061.
Mid-Devon. This centre area of Devon also seems to have remained in an
earlier age, farming land with rounded hills and wooded valleys, where
few holiday visitors discover the white houses of villages with names
like Sheepwash and the intriguing Shebbear (pronounced She-be-ar), and
several hilltop villages, almost like Italy.
Self-catering is popular in England's South-west and one of the best
providers is Helpful Holidays -- now with around 400 properties. They
are all within 100 miles of Helpful Holidays' office, so that Su and
Euan Bowater can visit them and know the owners. ''No good having a
brilliant property with an objectionable owner,'' the Bowaters maintain.
The bulk of Helpful Holidays' lets are cottages, but their latest find
is a former hotel, now adapted for self-catering, and sleeping up to 31
-- perfect for family gatherings, celebrations, and reunions.
Although they are as far as you can go from Scotland, Cornwall and
Devon are straightforward to reach, basically south on the M6 and M5,
with a good collection of overnight motorway inns. Even better are
trains direct to Plymouth from Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and
Inverness, some of them with the Voyager service of tea, coffee, and
aircraft-style meals for stations from Bristol and beyond, and
Edinburgh, Glasgow, and beyond returning north.
Thanks to privatisation, sleeper and Motorail services are destined to
disappear on this route, along with those to Fort William, at the end of
May.

IN the same mode as Helpful Holidays is Scotland's Deluxe, founded by
Christine and Jim Ondersma, who own the Victorian house, Spottiswoode,
at West Kilbride in Ayrshire. ''What sets us apart from other groups is,
first, size -- none with more than 12 bedrooms,'' Christine said, ''and
an absence of a reception-desk atmosphere.
''We want to look on people who come to us as friends and house
guests.'' The brochure also indicates very precisely what guests can do
in the area.
Most of the 25 lets are country houses, with a cluster in the Borders
and the South-west. But from Edinburgh's 17 Abercromby Place to
Briardale House in Dalbeattie and Millwood House in Inverness, they are
all gregarious people who like to open their homes. All have the
Scottish Tourist Board's deluxe grading, for quality and service.

PERSONALLY, I would banish the over-used words ''experience'',
''themed'', and ''heritage'', in a tourism context, but I doubt if I
shall have any success. The Burns National Heritage Park in Alloway,
with the Tam o'Shanter Experience, will open next month.
Using all the latest technology, visitors will be wafted to the
eighteenth century and take part in Tam's adventures. The Visitor Centre
will also have a Discover Burns audiovisual presentation, and displays
of Burns's Scottish travels. As well as the Tam o'Shanter Experience,
the park will include Burns's Cottage, restored in 1993, the Burns
Museum and Monument, Alloway's Auld Kirk, and the Brig o'Doon.
THE great Flower Parade, highlight of the popular bulb field season in
Holland, which attracts thousands of Britons to view their splendour,
takes place on the 22nd of next month. Started some 50 years ago by
local enthusiasts, the parade now uses 1[1/2] million hyacinths and some
4000 sq.ft of straw to secure them on innumerable floats.
A million spectators turn out to watch the parade, which usually runs
from Haarlem, through bulbfields and villages, to Noordwijk. This year
the route will be reversed in honour of Haarlem's 750th anniversary.

ITALIANS call them enoteche -- ''stocks of vintage wines'' -- which
sounds a nice name for what we would simply call wine bars. But then,
Italy has wine bars with a difference. Many operate not merely as places
in which to stand and sip but as specialist wine outlets. One of the
most famous, the Enoteca Pinchiorri in Florence, is in fact that city's
best, dearest, and most sumptuous restaurant.
My own favourite, infinitely humbler, is Il Goccetto, a somewhat
spartan bottle-lined cavern just off the Campo de' Fiori in Rome.
In Scotland, where wine bars are places that purvey lager and
deafening music, a real Italian enoteca would be a happy development.
The nearest we have to it is Raffaeli's Wine Bar, which is a congenial
mock-Florentine annexe of the Edinburgh restaurant of the same name.
Its Tuscan-born proprietor, after all, is already in the wine trade.
Indeed Bruno Raffaeli has become one of Scotland's prime Italian wine
stockists. To buy his wine at less than restaurant prices, however, you
must visit his warehouse on the Sighthill Industrial Estate.
Yet the detour is worth the trouble. From Monday to Friday it is open
from 10.30am to 6pm, and there are about 150 different Italian wines and
grappas inside.
This is not, you will quickly realise, Valvona &amp; Crolla, where more
than 600 wines are stocked in Elm Row, but the list enticingly reflects
the tastes of an Italian who grew up near the blissful town of Lucca,
birthplace of Puccini, and is probably Britain's sole importer of some
of the smooth, fruity white Montecarlo wines of that area.
As you would expect of a Tuscan, Raffaeli also has a range of Brunello
di Montalcino, an offbeat Vernaccia, a reliable Montepulciano Riserva,
and a Chianti that provides the answer -- well, one answer -- to the
perennial problem of what Chiantis are really worth drinking. Raffaeli's
is a 1988 San Cosma Riserva, and it shows what Chianti is really about.
This, at #7.50, is a classic Italian red, and should be drunk lovingly.
But though Tuscany rightly looms large on Raffaeli's list, Piemonte
looms larger. Not for nothing are these North Italian wines increasingly
compared with great Rhones and Burgundies, and Raffaeli has chosen two
suppliers, in particular, to confirm their quality. Franco Fiorina's
1985 Barbaresco Riserva (#11.55) is, as yet, challengingly dry,
formidably chewy, gum-coatingly tannic, and flavour packed. An
outstanding wine.
Bava's rival Barbera Superiore -- subtitled the Stradivario -- is
softer and more cedary, though at 13.5% proof it does not lack ballast
(#11.85). One of a line of wines bearing instrumental symbols (Barolo is
a double bass), this is matched by a silky white 1993 Gavi which, at
#7.80, has all the class you would expect of this fashionable wine but
seldom find.
* RAFFAELI'S warehouse is at Bankhead Broadway, telephone 0131-442
4371. Bottles are sold singly or at a discount by the case, and delivery
can be arranged. Raffaeli's restaurant and wine bar are in Randolph
Place, Edinburgh.

Beginning a short series in which William Russell confesses his
admiration or otherwise for a wide assortment of characters
HEROES and heroines: everybody has them, whether real or fictional,
dead or alive. They can be a role model, a teacher who inspired, a
sportsman who excelled, an entertainer who amused, an actor who
enthralled, a pop star who gyrated and even managed to sing, or a
painter who revealed new ways of seeing the world. It could be one's
mother or one's father, husband or wife. The reasons for picking one's
heroes vary from individual to individual. They do not need to be
necessarily brave or famous. A villain could be a hero if you were that
way inclined, even people with feet of clay.
This is the first in a short series and, on the basis that if you
can't stand the heat you should stay out of the kitchen, or possibly
that one should never ask anybody to do something one is not prepared to
do oneself, here are my choices.
My Heroine. To be honest she is an anti-heroine, none other than the
Iron Lady herself, Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven, picked on the
rabbit-confronted-with-a-stoat principle. There is something about the
lady: she enthrals, she is the spider to everyone else's fly, and not
being Prime Minister hasn't changed a thing.
She was already a human Venus Flytrap when Leader of the Opposition.
She appalls, she horrifies. It was my ambition to cover the General
Election she lost, one that I was never to fulfil because it never
happened. Her fall came at the hands of another electorate.
I had left Westminster before her last election campaign, and did not
cover it, but nobody who has travelled in the Thatcher entourage could
ever forget the experience. There was the pure pleasure of seeing the
lady, or Mother as we called her (although not to her face), screw up
the production line at the factories she visited when she would insist
on trying things out for herself.
Given the horror and delight on the faces of the executives showing
her round, one knew that the instant she was out of the door they would
be removing the badly-filled boxes of chocolates from the run,
rechecking where those squint ballbearings had gone, and trying
desperately to repair the damage.
There were the agonised hours watching her perform for the six o'clock
news bulletins, a ploy that grew ever more demanding as the power of
television to set the day's agenda increased. When I started covering
elections back in the days when Harold Wilson was flogging Gannex
raincoats and the white heat of technology, the daily news conferences
held at party headquarters set the day's agenda, an agenda confirmed by
that night's big speech at a party rally.
By the time the Iron Lady was starring in the roadshows, it was the
photo-opportunity that mattered. Talk to the writing press? Not on your
life.
Each election tour was the same. Week one we would follow her dust,
sitting meekly in our bus faithfully recording what our readers would
have seen on the TV screen the night before. Week two, and
disenchantment would be rife. What were we? TV reviewers? Political
reporters? The murmurings would grow. Rebellion would be in the air. The
aides would get restless. One particularly boring day -- we had gone to
Deal in Kent so that she could be photographed wearing yellow
lifeboatman's oilskins, and come back again without anything of note
having been said, let alone done -- we started to amuse ourselves in
time-honoured fashion by composing song parodies.
Mine was simple enough. To the tune of A Bicycle Built for Two, it
ran: ''Maggie, Maggie, Give us an interview, We're half crazy to have a
word with you.'' By chance a TV crew was on the bus, and they filmed us.
The song went out on air, the aides asked for a copy, and the very next
day we were summoned to the Presence. She kicked off her shoes, drinks
were served, and she talked while we listened. It was a nice song and
Carol, who was half with us, half with Mum, used it in her book about
the tour. She might have asked. But like mother like daughter, I
suspect.
Then there were the weekly lobby meetings when Mrs T was Leader of the
Opposition. They don't happen now that Labour is in Opposition, but the
custom used to be that at 4.15 p.m. on Thursdays the Leader of the House
would ascend the spiral stairs leading to one of Westminster's turret
rooms to brief the assembled lobby about next week's business, followed
in turn by the Leader of the Opposition at 5 p.m.
Next week's business was the pretext. In reality it was a chance for a
general chat, for all sorts of red herrings or blue hares to be set
swimming or running off the record, a device that allowed the next day's
stories to be denied hand on heart. Thatcher holding court was a
fearsome sight. Power-women can chill the male blood, and she knew how
to do that.
My abiding memory of her is when we went to the Isle of Wight. The
hacks were taken by bus to the hangars where the hovercraft was built.
Its vast doors were painted like a Union Jack. She came up the creek on
a hovercraft and, just as it was about to lumber on to dry land, the
prow doors were flung open and there, gleaming golden in the late
afternoon sunshine like some figurehead of old, was Boadicea, Queen
Christina, Elizabeth I, Edith Cavell -- a heroine.
My hero. I have decided it has to be Fred Astaire, because if there is
a dream I dream in vain -- given my age and weight I could be Mrs
Worthington's laddie -- it would be to be able to dance like him. Heaven
knows what he was like as a man. The screen image is a poor guide. Bing
Crosby, for instance, had a celluloid personality which was the
antithesis of the flesh-and-blood man, as had Cary Grant.
Actors make bad heroes, film stars especially, because what they do
that you admire is invariably the creation of other people. Their
witticisms and words are coined by press agents and writers, their image
is the result of careful cultivation of whatever their talents are by a
horde of people, from make-up artists to dress designers to directors.
But a dancer has to dance, and nobody danced like Astaire. Nor was it
a celluloid illusion. By all accounts everybody who saw him and his
sister Adele on stage was entranced. Look at the films. Clever cutting
-- today it is computer-enhanced imagery -- can make-believe that
somebody who has two left feet can dance. But in all the Astaire films,
the camera watches from afar, keeping his whole body in view. The angles
may change from time to time, and there has been discreet editing to
sustain interest, but what you see is not a patchwork of shots, bits of
this, bits of that.
He and his partner, be it Rogers, Charisse, Garland, Hayworth, or
Powell, start something and finish it. The feet fly inches above the
floor, the body is relaxed and totally under control, and he sings the
songs of Porter and Berlin to perfection in that light, unique little
voice, all the result of amazing dedication to his art and hours of
rehearsal. If I could put on the Ritz, don my top-hat, white tie, and
tails, I would be in heaven. I can't. But I can dream.

WELSH team manager Robert Norster is an immaculate dresser. ''Sharp''
is what he calls it, perfect would be the more appropriate description
of a man who never has a hair, or crease, out of place.
In New Zealand, on the 1983 Lions tour, Norster was famous among the
players for stopping at most mirrors to comb any offending hairs back
into place, or straighten his tie with a swift, but loving, swoop of a
hand.
Once one of the Five Nations most devastating middle of the lineout
jumpers in his day, the Cardiff man's career was cut short by a
succession of debilitating back injuries that were first diagnosed in
New Zealand on that same tour, then finished off by a severely
dislocated shoulder suffered during the World Tour to South Africa in
1989.
Now, he presents a formidable yet affable and gentlemanly figure as
the front man for the Welsh team that visits Murrayfield this afternoon,
a Welsh team badly in need of a win.
It's a transition from playing to management that Norster, still only
37, has handled with ease and good grace.
''Yes,'' he says, after returning home at midnight following yet
another rugby meeting ''it has its moments alright, being Welsh team
manager.
''All of us in the set-up, players, coaches, and management realise it
is not an easy job to be involved in trying to help Welsh rugby succeed.
This is our national game, and everyone in the country has an opinion as
to how we should be doing it.''
Often, enjoying a stroll during a break from his job as Marketing
Manager with Chartered Trust in Cardiff, Norster will be accosted in the
street, occasionally by well wishers, more often by crowds of Welshmen
who think things should be changed.
''Wales is a bit of a village, and with everyone being involved in
rugby it cuts both ways.'' he says ''I just have to accept that people
want to talk and discuss things. I treat it as part of the job.''
It would be hard to imagine his opposite number, Duncan Paterson,
being given a word or two of advice in Govan, but there you are.
Welsh rugby has been on a roller coaster ride, from the elation of
victories last season and the Five Nations champions, to the abject
misery of defeat at home to England this year, and Norster has been in
charge throughout.
''Last year we were delighted at the way things went, and it was a
good season for us.'' he says. ''In fact, in many ways, we were like
Scotland this year. We had the rub of the green, and sometimes all you
need is that little bit of luck.
''This year, though, we have had our injuries and the team has
suffered as a consequence.''
As with Scotland, Wales is racked by discussions as to whether the
club structure is as it should be. ''It gives many people a lot of
concern does the domestic scene'' says Norster
''All we can see, with the way the game is getting so much more
big-time and professional, is that the rich are getting richer, and the
poor are getting poorer. It is plain to see for everyone that our clubs
are becoming polarised.''
''Welshmen have always said that we have the strongest clubs in the
world, playing in the strongest leagues in the world.
''But now some are starting to questions how exactly you can ever tell
if that is true if you never play anyone. We have to broaden our
horizons, like you Scots are, and look outside our country.''
That competitive edge, and it has always existed, has inevitably given
observers reasonable grounds to accuse the Welsh of being professional
long before the most recent revelations from France came to light.
Welsh clubs have usually raised funds for their touring players, all
against amateur regulations, but Norster says the level of funding, and
its purpose, is generally mis understood.
''It's all Chinese whispers, isn't it?'' he asks. ''It's the same in
many countries, but the amounts received by players have been hugely
overstated in almost every report I see.
''I think it would be true to say that there have been benefits, but
nothing outrageous at all.''
Norster's term of office is to last until after the World Cup, when,
very possibly, he will collapse in an exhausted heap.
While everyone around him can be heard saying that the Five Nations
this year are a preparation for the coming tournament, Norster will have
none of it.
''Listen'' he says, ''we have to put right our way of playing and put
a smile back on the face of the nation now, this month, and forget about
the World Cup. ''We, the Welsh rugby team, carry the weight of the
expectation of the Welsh nation on our shoulders. We can't let them
down.''
A determined Norster, and a good man he is, too. Absolutely straight
and a credit to his country.
Let's hope he has to loosen that collar of his a few times during the
match, and that by the end of it he is a completely dishevelled wreck.
Now that would be good. Bobby Norster untidy in defeat.

In the search for mis-kicks, malapropisms, swearie-words, and sundry
other foul-ups,
David Belcher went behind the scenes of a Saturday sports institution
. . . and was
more than pleasantly surprised to find that his poisoned prejudices
were unfounded.
MENDACIOUS duplicity. Had Super Scoreboard's most famous Jim --
Sanderson of that ilk -- still been around to accuse me of it, I could
only have pleaded guilty. You see, when I was granted access to Radio
Clyde's studios a couple of Saturday afternoons ago, I came to bury
Super Scoreboard's soccer oracles, not to praise them.
I was there in search of inadvertent slips 'twixt brain and lip;
mis-kicks, malapropisms, and off-the-ball dunts in a nation's press
boxes; swearie-words by the ton. I was seeking confirmation of Archie
Macpherson's status as a sonorous Woodentop. I desired first-hand
evidence of the cringing cretinism that seems to afflict clown prince
Chic Young whenever a microphone is placed in his hand.
In short, I wanted my most poisoned prejudices confirmed. Why?
Because, in common with hundreds of thousands of other football-loving
folk, I had listened for many seasons to Super Scoreboard's live
commentaries, its trackside interviews, and its phone-ins, and so I had
become convinced that flipping Derek Johnstone is a cheery, chubby
chucklehead, and blooming Davie Provan drones portentously -- and what
about yon Hugh Keevins? Only somebody with a pair of ferrets down their
trousers could speak at such high speed and with such pained precision.
Hulp ma boab. And to think I knew Hugh Keevins nigh on 20 year ago,
'appen, when he wore split-knee two-tone loon pants and a denim headband
and worked for tuppence-three-farthing down pit on sports desk at Weekly
News. Just like me, actually, although I'm 15 years younger than he is,
of course.
Hugh Keevins was my first boss in the wonderful world of journalism,
if the truth be told. A complete gent, he is. One of nature's toffs. An
inspiration. An education.
Why, when Hugh wasn't successfully convincing me that H L Mencken got
his start by scrambling over Joe Harper's back-garden fence and peering
into his living-room, he'd be persuading me to drive him to dodgy bars
in his native Partick and buy him buckets of vodka.
Hugh it was who introduced me almost two decades ago to a convivial
cove with a wide centre-parting . . . Chick Young. As convivial as ever,
Chick now sports more hair on his head than he did as a youth. Odd.
Similarly, Dick Donnelly's gravel-throated Dundonian tones have become a
Super Scoreboard staple, but I'm sure that when I first met him years
ago he spoke with the soprano purity of an Etonian choirboy.
Remarkably like Davie Provan, in fact, a teenaged wizard of dribble
with Kilmarnock back then. And a very presentable young man he was, too,
despite the foot-high permed Afro he affected at the time. And I recall
being introduced to Derek Johnstone, an on-field hero to the Ibrox
legions, as well as to us daft wee laddies on the Weekly News sports
desk -- although we revered Derek not so much for his soccer prowess as
for his ravenous behaviour during a close-season lunch in a Chinese
restaurant in 1977.
One of us, you see, had been sent to record DJ's thoughts for the
Weekly News column we ghost-scribbled in his name. Over steaming heaps
of chop suey. One heap for Derek; one for the wee laddie. Only on this
occasion, the wee laddie was so slow and so preoccupied with writing
everything down, and Derek was so hungry, that, well . . . around the
Weekly News office DJ became TD: Two Dinners.
But I digress. My point is that I know from first-hand experience that
Hugh, and Davie, and Dick, and Derek et al are diamond geezers . . . yet
when I listen to them on Super Scoreboard, I find myself shouting
inhuman things. Calling them bampots and balloons. Decrying their
expertise, mental equilibrium, parentage, and eyesight.
Why? Because, in football, we are all experts, every one of us, with
opinions as valid as any of the ones advanced by your so-called experts.
Because, when it comes to football broadcasting, anyone can do it, can't
they? It's dead easy. Isn't it?
No, it's not. Oh, no. Come with me now to a small, sound-proofed room
in Clydebank that features heaps of telephones and microphones;
teetering piles of old-fashioned eight-track-cartridge tapes bearing
pre-recorded interviews; flickering television monitors with the volume
turned down, and the one man who every week controls the four living,
breathing, twisting, turning hours of radio that is Super Scoreboard,
David Tanner.
At 23, David Tanner is very young to be so capably and confidently
directing the activities of a nationwide team of seasoned commentators,
as he has been doing as Super Scoreboard's producer since he was 19. On
our arrival, David is overseeing Archie Macpherson's interrogation of a
French journalist about Eric ''Ooh-ya!'' Cantona.
David will have a very busy 30 minutes immediately before the show
goes on the air, having been in from 9.30am as it is. Checking whether
or not all the afternoon's alloted correspondents have turned up where
they're supposed to have done, and whether they have any immediate news
to report. Reminding them, in view of overnight snow, to include news of
road and pitch conditions in their pre-match pieces.
Ironing out technical problems with crackling microphones. Directing
the three programme assistants who oversee yet more phone lines in
another studio, and who troop in and out at regular intervals. Editing
the six minutes of Archie's interview into a more neatly-broadcastable
two, and checking that it's OK for Clyde listeners to hear the French
journalist saying what Cantona told France's international team manager
(''you are a bag of sheet'').
It was OK, although later in the programme, during the Open Line,
David will have to employ Clyde's red dump-button to prevent the west of
Scotland being scandalised by a mumping Rangers fan who, during the
course of a senseless complaint about Walter Smith having bought two
good players from Dundee United, casually opines that the Tannadice
club's playing methods are ''bullshit.''
Aside from the red dump-button -- which obliterates bad words by
activating a 6.7-second delay which then has to be filled by
back-pedalling chat from one of the commentators -- there is little in
the studio, and in Tanner's methodical demeanour, to alert you to the
fact that the show is continually flying by the seat of its pants.
It is, though. ''Sometimes the programme gets on the air with a prayer
-- you don't have the benefit of a wing, just a prayer. Losing a
satellite link for a big foreign game is one of the biggest nightmares,
and ours went down 20 minutes before the first important European game
of this season, Rangers against AEK in Athens,'' David reveals.
''You're trying to hassle blokes 2000 miles away to get a move on in
80-degree heat to set up a phone line . . . it's the ultimate terror --
that the show simply won't happen.''
And those red dump-button moments are never too far away; there's
always someone ready to say something that isn't meant to be heard. ''I
remember the first time I had to use the red button, when a premier
division manager suddenly decided he had to have a right good go at one
of our reporters with no expletive deleted.
''Actually, there aren't usually that many problems, but you have to
to be wide awake to the fact that there is always the potential for
problems. Reporters on phones who can't hear me over the crowd at the
match when I'm telling them to start talking; PA systems that are too
loud . . . there was one that played Super Scoreboard back at us at
half-time.
''Then there was the afternoon that Partick Thistle clinched promotion
to the premier division, and Hugh Keevins had got himself into the
dug-out beside Firhill maestro John Lambie.
''When the final whistle blew, Hugh asked John how he felt. John said:
'Delighted to be up, Hugh' -- after which all we heard was the thunder
of stampeding Jags fans, a few muffled exclamations, and then nothing
for the next 20 minutes. We genuinely feared for Hugh's safety.''
Not at Firhill, David. We don't go in for any form of hooliganism. Not
even when it's Paul McStay's best pal, the Old Blind Owl himself, Mr
Keevins. Nevertheless, David concedes that a certain antagonism between
listener and expert gives Super Scoreboard its edge. Aye, when it comes
to love-hate relationships, some of us simply love to hate Chic, Hughie,
Archie, Derek, Davie, and Co.
''Thats what keeps the programme vibrant. Some folk can't stand Chick;
others think he's hilarious. Some people don't like Dick Donnelly's
voice, whereas for me it's got a breezy, musical tone -- like Louis
Armstrong with a hangover. And Archie's gravitas pulls the big names in
. . . if he doesn't know them, he knows their granny. But if the show
isn't contentious, listeners treat you like wallpaper. Maybe we're Artex
. . . if you brush up too close against us, we're jaggy.''
Davie Provan and Pat Crerand certainly seem to brush one another up
the wrong way during the course of the afternoon when Clyde and
Manchester's Piccadilly Radio unite to discuss Eric Cantona, Crerand
diminishing himself badly with his mindless apologia for the Gallic bad
boy. Davie hits back with a winning description of Cantona as ''a nasty
bit of business''.
Punching the air in triumph as the Crerand-Provan heavyweight battle
continues, David Tanner knows he's providing his audience with good,
listenable radio. ''The programme can contain these arguments because
our team is strong, and folk know it's not contrived. Davie has a
dignity . . . he's considered and fair in a journalistic way, yet he
doesn't hang back with his opinions, from saying things he feels need to
be said.''
David Tanner doesn't hang back, either, geeing up ever-ready workhorse
Dougie McDonald -- ''you're speaking too slowly, it's funereal . . . and
don't say 'cup drama', say 'potential cup shocker' '' -- and instantly
informing his team of cup goal shockers up and down Britain.
Time flies by, from the first announcements of team line-ups via
pre-match interviews to early counters; half-time scores to last-gap
winners, full-time round-ups and post-match verdicts. Archie does his
Scottish report for Capital Radio in London. Callers phone the Open
Line. And then the game's all over for another week.
None of the Super Scoreboard team has sworn to themselves off-air. The
closest thing to a cock-up has been Archie beginning a piece with the
immortal phrase: ''If you thought that was a game of picnic . . . '' The
big red light on the studio desk has flashed for a heart-stopping
moment, alerting David to the fact that Radio Clyde's overall supremo,
Alex Dickson, is short of a result for his pools coupon.
From David's lips, I have heard some baffling new phrases. The cart's
one-legged. Go round them all for a tease. Tighten up your fades. Come
in after the shotgun. I have learned David's guilty secret: that
somewhere in his house is a cassette tape of him as an eight-year-old,
humming the Super Scoreboard theme tune and reading the back page of the
Sunday Mail in homage to his sports broadcasting inspiration, Richard
Park.
And, despite my preconceptions, I have learned that the Super
Scoreboard guys ain't half OK at their job.
If the show isn't
contentious, the
listeners treat you
like wallpaper

* Paisley-based Sandy Stoddart (above), neo-classical sculptor
extraordinaire, is at present working on statues of Robert Burns. He
charts his food and drink consumption on a working day.
I SLEPT on the floor all night (for bad back purposes) and got up with
a spring at 8am. What I had for breakfast myself was determined by what
everyone else had, ie a plate of Frosties. Then I had a cup of tea and a
bit of toast, and lime marmalade to keep off the scurvy.
My studios are rented from a factory who let me use their coffee
machine. I had a cup of Gold Blend coffee at the back of nine and
another in mid-morning. Quite often I have a jar of pickled mussels for
a lunchtime snack.
I had a cup of tea in the studio in the afternoon. Then I came home
and gave the children an early tea of fish fingers -- two of which I
stole. My own tea was late because we had a visitor coming. We bought in
pizzas (mine was cheese and tomato with anchovies). With them we had a
bottle of claret -- our national drink!
Then I had a cup of coffee, Alta Rica this time, and at 12 o'clock I
got to bed -- or in my case to floor.
* Sandy Stoddart was talking to Lesley Duncan.

Eugen d'Albert, Piano Concertos, BBC SSO (Hyperion)
* VOLUME Nine of Hyperion's fascinating trawl through the hinterland
of unknown nineteenth-century piano concertos. Not masterpieces
generally, but gems certainly. In their own seventh contribution to the
series, the SSO and pianist Piers Lane give big licks to the wee
Glaswegian-born virtuoso pianist's two concertos.
The first is too long, sprawling, and languid; the second -- shorter,
tighter, and more dramatic -- is more impressive. Each, very much in the
mould of the times (Liszt and co), contains immensely attractive music.
Not immediately striking, but well-played and repays familiarisation.
Alexander Mackenzie, Orchestral Music, BBC SSO (Hyperion)
* BEST known for his academic role in London at the turn of the
century, Mackenzie was a gifted composer whose music here receives some
rare exposure. Don't let anyone jump on the Scottish bandwagon here:
Mackenzie, who played in Germany as a youngster, was a thoroughgoing
European. He utterly absorbed the influences of the day -- from the
Mediterranean warmth of Mendelssohn to the avant-garde of Liszt and
Wagner. Here then is a collection of rarities, every one of them
sculpted with assured craftsmanship, and a few of the pieces --
especially the intense and beautiful Benedictus (a sort of MacBarber
Adagio) and the characterful Dickensian overture, Cricket on the Hearth,
cry out for concert performance. Do investigate this one.

The Herald's team
of reviewers presents
an informed guide
to listening pleasure
Maxinquaye, Tricky (4th and Broadway)
* US critics, we do have our uses. The CD casing of Tricky's debut
album comes pasted with glowing tributes from folk with knowing ears.
''Awesomely beautiful.'' ''One of the greatest albums of the decade.''
''One of the key albums of '95.'' Well, no, hang on . . . D*Note's
Criminal Justice is the album of '95 so far, actually -- but otherwise
heed us pundits when we alert you to the organic goodness of the
claustrophobic plottings and oblique vibings committed by Tricky and his
broody vocal accomplice, the darkly breathy Martine.
Sway and swoon tonight, Glaswegian groovers, when Tricky appears live
on stage at Barrowland.
To Bring You My Love, P J Harvey (Island)
* MS Harvey, of course, is tonight's headline attraction at
Barrowland. The growling slinkstrel's debut solo album finds her living
in the Stygian gloom of Cave-land . . . Nick Cave-land. Beneath a levee
that is set to break. Where Satan's eyes glow red in every cranny. Where
acts of love are hopelessly entwined with notions of original sin; where
kisses are acts of betrayal . . . where strings saw; acoustic guitars
thrash, and organs swell -- oo-er! In other words, about half of this LP
is over-wrought, overblown, and slightly silly. Meanwhile, the other
half pounds along quite marvellously, rather in the manner of vintage
Led Zep, albeit Led Zep with PMT.
Twisted, Del Amitri (A&amp;M)
* AND bolts of lightning split the night and the thunder rolled, and
Thoth, Lord of the Undead, spake: ''By my mighty sword, my mighty
chalice, and my mighty trouser-press -- let there be rockular activity
of crunching strength! Rock of tear-inducing sensitivity! Classy,
tuneful rock that makes otherwise-sensible women smile like goons as
they hip-shimmy dervish-style round their living-rooms.''
Or, to put it another way, this is another routinely splendid album of
grace, power, and melody from our own Del-boys. But scuzzier, fuzzier,
and dirtier than ever before. Hurrah!
No Protection, Massive Attack versus the Mad Professor (Circa)
* AS exclusively previewed in your hipper-than-hip Herald a couple of
weeks ago, a dub reworking of Massive Attack's Protection album which
easily surpasses the original. Rude and rasping bass-noises pulse and
throb. A billowing sonic fog envelopes your radiogram's speakers. Vocal
phrases drift and ebb with an eerie laziness beyond all literal
interpretation. Step right this way -- with slow precision -- into a
deep vat of syrup-up-up-up-up!
Classic Disco Volume 1, various (Mastercuts)
* AND that which was spurned as dross in the hour of its genesis,
circa 1978, shall ultimately be picked from the dung-heap and exalted
above all else. On its own, the full 7min 20sec version of Shame by
Evelyn ''Champagne'' King justifies the price of admission, while Dan
Hartman's original Relight My Fire stands revealed as a shimmering,
bubbling masterpiece in 4/4 time. And you get the gorgeously-mindless
synth-boogie of Can't Live Without Your Love by Tamiko Jones. So dig out
your patchwork denim trouser-suit, granma, and do the Latin Hustle.

THERE flourished in 1930s New York, they say, a publishing house
dedicated to reprints of the classics -- a classic, in this context as
in the movies, being any book old enough to be out of copyright. Their
sales were remarkable, suggesting that every little pip in the Big Apple
had given up on Li'l Abner and dime novels in favour of improving their
minds.
This was not the case; the publishers, while leaving the sacred text
alone, were dressing up their wares in lurid cover art and blurbs -- and
even, if the book were a translation, pepping up the title. Thus did
Victor Hugo's Le Roi s'Amuse enjoy a new lease of life as The Lustful
King Enjoys Himself.
Video distributors sometimes do the same kind of thing with movies.
Recognising that the masterpiece on hand just turned 50 cinemas into
bingo halls overnight, they send it back into the world with a
deceptively angled advertising campaign. And you certainly can't blame
them when what they're trying to shift is The Hudsucker Proxy (rental,
cert PG).
This delightful but typically hard-to-sell jeu d'esprit from imps of
mischief Joel and Ethan Coen, whose wilfully obscure non-blockbusters
include Miller's Crossing (a 1930s-style gangster movie that appears to
be about a hat) and Barton Fink (a Hollywood black comedy enigmatically
centred upon a pin-up of a girl in a swimsuit), has now been subtitled A
Comedy of Invention. It's being marketed as a bright and breezy Little
Man business romp, bursting with all-American optimism and cheer.
Which may not be entirely truthful, but from a commercial point of
view sure beats the more strictly literal alternatives. ''It's a film
about a guy who invents the hula hoop . . . it's a film about a wise old
black office janitor . . . it's a film that has to explain its own
title. . .''
All these things are at least as true as the official version, but
there is very little ''about'' about The Hudsucker Proxy except that
it's about 107 minutes long. Guileless business-school graduate Tim
Robbins gets a job in the hellhole mailroom of giant Hudsucker
Industries, rises to be chairman through the cynical machinations of
vice-president Paul Newman (the old boy's best part in years), and
becomes a national hero by inventing the hula hoop. But the storyline is
only a hook on which the Coen brats can hang a sly, mock-reverent
tribute to the feelgood screwball social comedies of Frank Capra and
Preston Sturges.
Everything about it is as phoney as a three-dollar bill. The period is
the 1950s, but everyone dresses and talks 1930s. The black janitor who
tends the awesome works of the Hudsucker Industries clock is, if not God
himself, at least one of His senior executives. And when angelic
intervention is required, it appears not as a twinkly little star, as in
Capra's It's A Wonderful Life, but as a fat old guy with a cigar, halo,
and wings.
The Coen brothers have no agenda but to enjoy themselves and show off;
their films are about nothing but cinema. The Hudsucker Proxy snaps,
crackles, and pops along with sheer cinematic verve and love of the art.
It may be strictly a con game, but if you love the movies, you'll be
glad to be conned.

THE great Gareth we called him, and with good reason. He was faster
than Gary Armstrong, stronger than Terry Holmes, a better kicker than
Nick Farr-Jones, even more competitive than Sid Going; only Roy Laidlaw
came near him. He was simply the best scrum half I ever saw.
Gareth Owen Edwards won 53 caps for Wales between 1967 and 1978, was
never dropped, and scored 20 tries for his country. He was also on three
British Lions tours. But statistics do not give the whole man.
After the season he was first capped he toured South Africa with the
Cardiff club. His extraordinary versatility saw him pop up at fly half,
centre and full back, as well as in his natural position.
In between times he entertained the company by doing standing backward
somersaults and eating 14 steaks at a barbecue on a big-game trip to the
Kalahari desert.
''If he had been a musician he would have played every instrument in
the band,'' his long-time half back partner Barry John once remarked.
''Oh yes, and he would have been the lead singer, too!''
Gareth Edwards, born 47 years ago, was at Pontadawe School, Millfield,
and Cardiff Training College, where he studied physical education.
He exploded into a Welsh team that was eventually to contain also the
twinkling talents of JPR Williams, Ray Gravell, Gerald Davies, JJ
Williams, Phil Bennett, Bobby Windsor, Charlie Faulkner, Graham Price,
and Mervyn Davies. It was the start of a Golden Age.
During Edwards's unbroken occupation of the scrum half berth, Wales
won three Grand Slams, five Triple Crowns, and five outright Five
Nations Championships.
It was a domination that no other country has ever been able to
achieve, and the rugby was of the highest quality. Edwards was at its
heart.
Coincidentally Gareth, as he reminded me last weekend, had begun a
long love affair with Scotland. Later in life fishing and golf would
entice him north of the border; originally it was just the big match.
''My first visit to Murrayfield was as a young, enthusiastic supporter
in 1961, and ever since it has been one of my favourite arenas. The
surface was always excellent, and I enjoyed playing there.
''Of course I remember the good times, like when we won 19-18 in 1971
or the Triple Crown in 1977. But there were some Welsh hopes brought to
earth with a bump at the Scottish HQ.
''I shall never forget the crowd at the 1975 game as long as I live.
There were over 100,000 inside Murrayfield, and that was just the ones
who paid!
''It is estimated, you know, that we had 50,000 in the red and white
army that day, and what happened? We lost 12-10, Alan Martin's touchline
conversion in injury time just failed.
''That was a major disappointment for us. You beat us by a single
point in 1973 as well.''
Hang on a minute, Gareth, I interjected, we may have won a couple of
home games when you were around, but we were turned over like pigs on a
spit at Cardiff year after year. And it was often you to blame,
considering you scored six tries against us during your career.
''Well, we did have the edge at the Arms Park,'' he conceded,'' and I
did manage the odd try.
Sure, like the 1972 one with Jim Renwick chasing you from one end of
the field to the other, you diving over into a mound of mud and emerging
like a triumphant coal miner who had just won the pools.
No-one, especially JR, will ever forget that one.
''I played against some very tough Scottish scrum halfs,'' Gareth
insisted. ''You did not get much change out of Iain McCrae or Dunky
Paterson or Douglas Morgan.'' Still don't.
We began to talk of the present championship, and he was honest in
saying he had been surprised by Scotland's victory over France.
''We all thought England and France would be the front runners, but it
is to Scotland's credit that they have come this far.
''And now you will see the benefits of a little confidence creeping
into the ranks.
''This will be a tough test for Wales at Murrayfield. The Scots,
whether they like it or not, will be considered as the favourites.
''To be frank I believe we are carrying too many injuries to be much
of a threat to anyone. I think t he main Wales aim will be to find a
settled side for the World Cup where it is vitally important we make the
quarter finals at least.
''If you do beat us, everyone will hope you do us all a favour and
bring down the English. I think England are the best side in the
championship. That does not mean to say they will necessarily win it.
''I will be up in Scotland this weekend to do some television work.
The clubs will be coming with me, and I am looking forward to renewing
old friendships.''
As long as he is not playing, there will be a welcome in the Scottish
hillsides.
How good was Gareth Edwards? JBG Thomas, the doyen of Welsh rugby
writers, was recently asked to name his best post-war fifteen in the red
jerseys.
''There arose no trouble at all at choosing the scrum half,'' he
wrote, ''for Gareth Owen Edwards had it all . . . the complete rugby
player.
''When he played with such success at home and abroad, one was often
at a loss for fresh adjectives to shower on him.  Truly a great one!'

Jonah Jones at The Embers, The Jonah Jones Quartet (RCA Victor)
* THE problem with this 11-track CD reissue of a 1956 album is its
repetitiveness after the third track. There's little by way of variety
of mood or pace (almost all the numbers are up tempo) and trumpeter
Jones's tone barely changes. The overall effect is pretty bland and
samey; the only possible exceptions being the groovy Horace
Silver-penned Learnin' the Blues, and a leisurely Tin Roof Blues.

Renowned saleroom expert
Liz Taylor begins a new
column on what to keep an
eye on with a look at how
nostalgia can be memorable
REMEMBER Mel Torme? Of course you do. He's the crooner who delivers
the schmaltzy Christmas classic: ''Chestnuts roasting on an open fire .
. . '' What's more, he not only recorded it but wrote it.
Torme, it appears, has combined his career as a crooner with being a
song-writer, a drummer, a novelist, and a biographer (he wrote The Other
Side of the Rainbow about Judy Garland), and he is also a movie archive
collector in a big way.
His particular passion is posters, especially the ones relating to
early aviation films and the classics of the 1930s and 40s. Throughout
his life he has been an avid filmgoer and started his collection by
keeping posters relating to films he had most enjoyed. As collections
have a habit of doing, however, it growed like Topsy and now he has
decided to sell. The Mel Torme collection is included in a sale of
Vintage Film Posters at Christie's, South Kensington, London, on
Thursday, March 9.
Torme's collection shares the sale with another brought together by
the veteran film producer Hal Roach, who produced films with Laurel and
Hardy, the ''Our Gang'' comedies, and Of Mice and Men in 1939. Another
source for the sale is a private Irish cinema where the proprietors seem
never to have thrown anything away and have provided a magnificent
selection of 1950 film posters including Elvis Presley's Jailhouse Rock,
Marilyn Monroe's Bus Stop, and Audrey Hepburn's The Nun's Story.
In their heyday, major motion-picture studios turned out an average of
a film a week and commissioned highly-talented graphic artists to create
publicity material that would draw the crowds into the movie theatres.
Some of the best known film-poster artists are Hap Hadley (1895-1976);
Rene Peron (1904-1978); the still living William Chantrell, born 1916;
and the star of them all, Albert Hirschfield, who was born in 1903.
It is fortunate that there were people prepared to retain or collect
film posters at a time when they were regarded as disposable as bus
tickets, for once a film completed its run, the promotional material was
thrown out and keeping archives was considered to be a waste of money by
the studio bosses.
Today, however, old posters are collected not only as works of art but
because they provide insights into how society and values have changed
over almost a century. They delineate fashions, prejudices, social
propaganda, and customs and form part of the cultural heritage of the
twentieth century.
The posters coming up for sale have been sub-divided by Christie's
into various categories and some of the most colourful and exciting are
to be in the Musical section. For example, there is a wonderful poster
for High Society showing Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Grace Kelly arm
in arm while Louis Armstrong plays his trumpet in the background. Its
estimated price is between #200 and #400.
A little known area of film-making, which is recorded in the poster
sale, specialised in films made with black African-American casts. They
were made for black audiences to be shown in segregated cinemas and
provided outlets for actors and actresses who were only cast in minor or
undignified roles in mainstream films.
One of the early, black stars in these fringe films of the 1920s was
Bill Pickett, a black cowboy actor, but it was not until the 1960s that
major film studios began to realise that a high percentage of their
potential audience was made up of black people and their attitudes to
casting began to change. Sidney Poitier became the first black superstar
because of the success of his film, A Raisin in the Sun.
In the sale is a stunning poster created by Albert Hirschfield for a
1943 black film, Cabin in the Sky, starring Ethel Waters, Lena Horne,
Louis Armstrong, and Eddie ''Rochester'' Anderson. Its estimate is
between #3000 and #5000.
There is also a section devoted to posters for the films of Albert
Hitchcock, but they do not appeal to me so much as some of the more
graphically arresting ones. A high price of between #5000 and #8000,
however, is expected for Mel Torme's poster for The Thirty Nine Steps
dating from 1935 and starring Madeleine Carroll and Robert Donat.
Posters for British films; films starring women; the films of Humphrey
Bogart; and ''films noir'' which were billed as ''suitable only for
adults'' make up some of the other sections, with the most eye-catching
among them being a poster for Rita Hayworth in Gilda (estimate around
#500) and another, one of the potentially most expensive in the sale,
for Marlene Dietrich in Shanghai Express (#7000 to #10,000).
A Swedish poster for Louise Brooks in the 1926 film A Social Celebrity
is estimated at around #5000 because no other copy of it is known to
exist. That film launched a fashion for women cutting their hair in a
short bob known as ''the Louise Brooks' bob'' and the poster shows her
in a hairdressing salon having her hair cut by Adolphe Menjou.
TIP OF THE WEEK
* Even the most knowledgeable picture collectors from time to time
come across signed work by artists that are not known to them.
Help can be found in a magnificent new book, Dictionary of Scottish
Art and Architecture, researched and written by Peter J M McEwan and
published by the Antiques Collectors' Club.
It has taken Mr McEwan 12 years to amass the information he includes
in his 626-page tome, and there are over 11,000 entries. Although the
book costs #49.50, it is money well spent for a serious collector.

THE stakes are high at Murrayfield today, but not just on the park.
The game will engender revenue of some #2 million, making it one of the
greatest money-spinners in European sport.
The new Murrayfield, a #44m citadel of Scottish rugby cast in concrete
and steel, was used for the first time in its 67,500 all-seated guise
for the match against the Springboks last November.
The #2m take for 80 minutes' play encompasses ticket sales, which
range from #5 for under-14s to the #22 full price ticket; television
rights; debenture and hospitality revenue; sponsorship, including Royal
Bank match sponsorship which has been running since 1982; trackside
advertising; car parking; programme sales; catering; and sales from the
revamped souvenir shop.
International rugby is now big business, and even within the last
decade the game has soared in popularity.
The advent of the Rugby World Cup has given the sport a hitherto
unknown exposure worldwide.
And since the inaugural competition in the Antipodes in 1987,
television coverage and ever-expanding sponsorship opportunities have
placed the sport on a financial plateau that could only have been
dreamed of when William Webb Ellis, allegedly, set the whole thing in
motion when he ran with the ball at Rugby School in 1823.
Probably, though, Webb Ellis and the game's founding fathers --
steeped as they were in the Corinthian ethic -- will be birlin' in their
graves at the sight of the financial bazaar which their game has become.
In the year ended March 31, 1994 -- the most recent period for which
complete figures are available -- the turnover of the Scottish Rugby
Union was #5,563,554. These are big bucks for an amateur game.
However, the SRU exists purely and simply to service the game and the
clubs in Scotland, and after operating expenses, tax, and other items
had been taken into account, the retained profit for the period was a
mere #16,649.
The tale of the growing popularity of the game, and the burgeoning
bankroll that has accompanied it, can be traced by the evolution of the
the stadiums which have been home to the national side in Scotland.
It all began on March 27, 1871, on the Edinburgh Academicals' cricket
field at Raeburn Place. On that date Scotland played, and beat, England
in the world's first rugby international. After expenses had been
deducted, the cricket club received the princely sum of #13 for the hire
of their ground.
Scotland's next home game in 1873 was played on the West of Scotland
Cricket Club ground at Hamilton Crescent. The fact that Glasgow, or more
properly Partick, was considered a suitable venue for such an important
fixture, indicates that, even then, rugby had influentil disciples in
the West of Scotland.
For the next 22 years, with the exception of three further visits to
Hamilton Crescent, the Edinburgh Academical ground was pressed into
service for rugby internationals.
But the relationship between the Union and the Academy became strained
(the school insisted on their boys using the ground on the mornings
before the big games). Old Hampden Park and Powderhall became emergency
venues while the Union continued its search for a permanent home.
Eventually, for the sum of #3800 financed then, as now, by a ticket
debenture issue, a plot of land was bought at Inverleith just a mile or
so to the north of Raeburn Place. Scotland, therefore, became the first
country to have its very own international ground.
A stand was constructed and the ground was ready for the Welsh match
in January 1899. However, the wintry weather intervened, causing the
game to be postponed, and it was not until the match against Ireland the
following month that Inverleith -- now the home of Stewart's-Melville FP
-- was officially opened.
By the early 1920s, the game had outgrown Inverleith and the hunt was
on again for new premises. Some 19 acres of land owned by the Edinburgh
Polo Club at Murrayield was earmarked by the Union, and the purchase was
once again facilitated by the issue of debentures.
The new stadium, with its stand and three embankments that were to
become a feature of the Old Murrayfield for the next six decades, was
some two years in the building, and by 1925 the ground was ready for
use.
England were the visitors on March 21, 1925, and before a crowd of
more than 70,000 Scotland achieved the first Grand Slam in the nation's
rugby history.
In the years that followed, Old Murrayfield was further developed to
keep pace with the popularity of the game. In 1936, two wing extensions
were added to the cavernous West stand and the seating capacity was
raised to 15,228.
Like most sporting venues, Murrayfield operated a come-one, come-all
policy at the turnstyles. However, in 1975, when a world-record crowd of
104,000 (with many thousands more turned away) jammed in to see Scotland
beat Wales 12-10, the decision was taken to introduce a ticket-only
policy with an upper limit of 70,000.
In the early eighties, with safety considerations on the massive East
terracing principally in mind, plus increasing demand for a comfortable
seat, the decision was taken to level the terracing and replace it with
a new stand.
The #3.15m plan was financed largely by Scottish Sports Council grant
and by 5000 interest-free, 20-year loans of #400 for which the lender
was awarded the right to buy one ticket for each home international.
The Union toyed with the idea of two-tier stands on the end
terracings, with standing accommodation on the lower deck, but the
Hillsborough soccer stadium disaster meant the plan had to be
re-evaluated.
Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry and report, which decreed in 1990 that
all stadiums coming within the remit of the Safety of Sports Ground Act
1975 had to be all-seated by the start of the 1995 season, paved the way
for the new Murrayield super stadium.
The #44m cost was daunting, and especially so for an ''amateur'' sport
that had seen its ''professional'' counterpart dithering over plans for
a new national football stadium at Hampden.
Once again, though, the scheme was financed by the issue of debentures
to the rugby public. It is, though, a high risk strategy, the success of
which is dependent in no small measure on the fortunes of the national
side.
Scotland's emergence from a string of nine games without a win was
greeted with glee, and not just within the playing camp.
Last week, in the aftermath of the team's historic win in Paris a
fortnight ago, they were uncorking the champagne in the debenture office
as well.
SRU finance chief Graham Ireland said that the French connection had
sparked a rush for debentures as fans sought to secure guaranteed
tickets for today's game.
''Inquiries are 100% up, and I'm confident that debenture sales will
be significantly in excess of #31m by the time of the Welsh game,'' he
says.
Play up Scotland. Play up and pay the game!

James NcKillop
concludes his series
on the rugby exiles
DON'T go wasting too many tears on those who enjoy their rugby at Old
Dere Park.
Considering what has gone on before and where they are now, you might
reasonably have expected London Welsh to be crying into their beer.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
''There are no bleeding hearts here,'' I was told. ''We are well past
the stage of feeling sorry for ourselves. We did reach rock bottom, but
now we are on the mend.''
In this corner of Richmond there are no old dears basking on past
glories. ''You can't keep looking over your shoulder. If you do, you
just bump into lamp-posts. We know where we want to be and what we have
to do to get there.''
They are in no mood for patronising hogwash from those who have
witnessed what must surely be the most dramatic decline in the history
of Rugby Union.
London Welsh may be looking to the future, but the neutral making a
first visit to their famous ground overlooked by the pagoda in Kew
Gardens, can still feel the ghosts of the great names of the sixties and
seventies.
It is not at all difficult to imagine JPR Williams, long hair flowing
in the wind and stockings rumpled around his boots, jinking through the
opposition from his own 25-yard line well into enemy territory.
Not even the seemingly invincible Bath of the modern game can hope to
match the achievements of London Welsh in their glory days.
Unlike Bath, which attracts the Scots, Irish and English, all the
London Welsh players qualified to play in only one international team.
Unquestionably, as far as club rugby is concerned, they were the
elite.
Certainly they were by far the best in the Northern hemisphere (they
proved that when they beat the top French team Beziers in a match for
the unofficial championship of Europe). .
Almost certainly they would have come out winners in a club match
anywhere in the world.
Club rugby. Who are we kidding?
The Welsh national side was built around this team at a period when,
to the rest of us, it seemed they were willy nilly picking up triple
crowns and grand slams.
More than that: London Welsh actually sent seven seven players on the
Lions' victorious tour of New Zealand in 1971 when The Magnificent Seven
were: captain John Dawes, Mervyn Davies, JPR, Mike Roberts, Geoff Evans,
Gerald Davies, and John Taylor.
Apart from the Magnificent Seven , London Welsh of the day had a dozen
or so Welsh internationalists in their squad. Among the greats were Mike
Roberts and Billy Hullin. The list seems endless.
No question about it: these were the golden years. They were pouring
into Old Dere Park in their thousands, just to say they had been there.
How the mighty have fallen!
From these heady heights, last year London Welsh were faced with the
embarrassing prospect of being relegated into the London leagues, out of
the national set-up where they were struggling even in Division Five
(South).
How could it happen?
In the swinging sixties and seventies, London was Mecca for all young
men. Trainee doctors such as JPR and school masters were attracted to
the city in droves. Since then we have had Margaret Thatcher and the
introduction of the league system in England.
While finding a job was no problem in the seventies, it certainly is
nowadays. Combined with inflation and soaring house prices in London,
young men preferred to stay home in Wales.
The introduction of the league system also coincided with a period of
huge complacency within the club.
London Welsh had always boasted an impressive fixture list. Apart from
games against the top Welsh sides such as Llanelli, Cardiff, and Swansea
they also played against the Wasps, Harlequins, Baths, and Bristols of
this world.
Even their place in Division Two of the national league meant games
against attractive opposition.
But before they realised what was happening, the club was playing in
Division Three, then Four, and finally Five (South) with visits to
unfashionable venues such as Barking, Weston-super-Mare, and High
Wycombe.
It was the threat of relegation from even that lowly league which
finally brought about a realisation that something had to be done.
Obviously, even those rugby-playing Welshmen who did live in London
were not attracted to the club.
The M4 and a high-speed train service to Wales has made it possible
for them to travel twice a week for training and on Saturdays to one of
the fashionable clubs in the Principality.
Even those Welshmen who might choose to play in London would want to
play their rugby with the top clubs. London Welsh will not nowadays
feature in their thinking.
Ernie Williams, the chairman of the Club, has set out the priorities.
Foremost was the restoration of morale; the appointment of Mike Gosling,
who won success at Wasps; and an improvement in playing performance.
The plan was to achieve promotion to Courage League Division 4 next
season, promotion to the third the following year, and the second within
four years.
Certainly, Welsh are again playing attractive flowing rugby this
season and the signs of a better future are there.
''It is a long time since we have been in such good heart,'' said
Williams. ''There may be the odd hiccup on the way, but the long-term
future of London Welsh looks very bright.''

SCOTLAND are chasing a record today, for never before have they beaten
Wales five times on the trot at Murrayfield. The sight of the navy blue
jerseys often lights a fire in the men from the valleys, and Scotland v
Wales games frequently create a higher quality of spectacle than in
other areas of the Five Nations Championship.
The Welsh have scored some scintillating tries in Edinburgh, and the
three they registered against Scotland a year ago, all wide out and all
by backs, gave a reminder of their potential.
And this despite the fact that stand off Neil Jenkins is rated by
critics as too thirled to the boot and to the creation of positions from
which he can goal-kick Wales to victory.
Modern Welsh players still live in the considerable shadow of those
giants of the past who were in the vanguard of that second Welsh golden
era between 1969 and 1979.
Then, Wales gathered in three Grand Slams, six outright championships,
and six Triple Crowns. They set new standards, having beaten their
rivals to coaching in appointing their first national coach, David Nash,
in 1964.
The Welsh evolved a style based on a higher level of fitness, set
piece assurance, and ball transferance of magical quality.
They were, of course, fortunate in that a number of world class
players came together about the same time, among them J P R Williams,
Gerald Davies, Barry John, Gareth Edwards, and a dynamic back row of
David Morris, Mervyn Davies, and John Taylor.
This was a squad of all the talents yet, like some of their
predecessors, they did not always find Edinburgh a happy hunting ground.
That was due in large measure to the appointment in 1969 of Bill
Dickinson as adviser to the Scottish captain. He brought organisation,
commitment, and success despite some official opposition to his
appointment.
Even in 1971, when Wales were on their way to their first Grand Slam
for 19 years, they should have lost at Murrayfield in one of the most
thrilling internationals ever seen.
If Peter Brown's conversion of Chris Rea's sparkling try had not come
back off an upright, it would have been all over at 20-14.
But Delme Thomas made another perfect lineout deflection, JPR
intruded, and Gerald Davies scampered home for Taylor's touchline
conversion to take Wales home 19-18.
On their next two visits, Wales were the hottest of favourites but
lost both times.
In 1973, Scotland won 10-9 with unexpected scrummage tries -- when
Colin Telfer danced home, then later made a dummy run for Billy Steele
to come in from the right wing and score as an intruding stand off.
That Wales team contained nine British Lions and had accumulated five
consecutive wins over the Scots.
The 1975 match created two surprises -- Scotland won again and the
attendance was a record, 104,000.
Thousands could not get in, and I remember an Edinburgh taxi driver's
tale of how he was watching the match on television when he felt a
presence and found 15 Welsh supporters with noses pressed against his
lounge window.
He invited them in to see the game, and it cost him 45 cups of coffee
and 12 packets of digestive biscuits.
Scotland's current coach Douglas Morgan kicked three penalty goals and
Ian McGeechan a drop goal for a 12-10 win, although there was a heavy
intake of breath as Allan Martin's closing conversion attempt slid wide.
Rugby annals are littered with stirring deeds enacted during Welsh
visits to Edinburgh:
Douglas Elliot giving Glyn Davies a torrid time in 1949 when the heat
off the crowd lifted the fog; Peter Kininmonth's famous drop goal in
1951; the end of Scotland's 17 consecutive defeats with 14-8 victory in
1955; Arthur Dorward's match winning drop goal in 1957.
Then there were 111 lineouts and Clive Rowlands's drop goal in 1963,
Phil Bennett's brilliant try in 1977, and since 1987 consecutive
Scottish wins of 21-15, 23-7, 32-12, and 20 points to nil.
Perhaps the worst Welsh experience in Edinburgh was in February 1924
when, on the Sunday after the game, the Welsh party were taken out to
view the magnificent Forth Bridge.
However, they had lost to Scotland by what remains a record margin for
the series of 35-10. As the players gazed in awe at the bridge a Welsh
selector growled:
''Have a good look at it, boyos, because it's the last time you are
ever likely to see it at the Welsh Rugby Union's expense.''
Some of the most revered figures of the Scottish game were among the
try scorers -- the ''flying Scot'' Ian Smith had three, Selkirk's Willie
Bryce, Herbert Waddell, Phil Macpherson, ''Tubby'' Bertram, and Johnny
Wallace, one each.
In that match, Scotland fielded the Oxford University three quarter
line -- Smith, Macpherson, G G Aitken, and Wallace.
Now Scotland has a Cambridge University loose forward trio -- Rob
Wainwright, Eric Peters, and Iain Morrison.
A happy augury perhaps.

If it will help Scotland to go on and beat
the English, then I hope they beat us
AT chastened Cardiff Arms Park, as England went about their busines of
beating Wales -- totally expected, of course -- the two biggest cheers
of the afternoon followed public announcements of the score from Paris.
The first said Scotland were leading 16-11, and the second announced
the improbable final result. The reaction even drowned out the growing
chorus of Swing Low Sweet Chariot.
In a city that did not want to discuss England that night, the
Scottish success was a major talking point.
One passionate Welsh fan explained what the Welsh exodus to
Murrayfield this weekend means as a result.
''If it will help Scotland to go on and beat England, then I hope they
beat us,'' he declared.
''In fact, much as it hurts me to say it, I think I might even end up
supporting Scotland against Wales for that reason.''
After all, Wales have nothing left to go for this season, and have
even failed in their bi-annual duty of beating England in Cardiff.
There is no doubt that in Welsh minds the next best thing to Wales
doing well is England doing badly, and Scotland represent the last hope
of England being beaten in this Five Nations.
Most Welsh rugby fans know the words of Flower of Scotland; indeed, it
will usually come up on a sing-song night not long after Calon Lan and
We'll Keep a Welcome in the Hillsides.
The trip to Murrayfield is a fun one and, exactly the same as going to
Dublin, the result is less important than the good time had by all --
and a good time is invariably had.
Equally, a rock-solid, guaranteed way of making friends in Cardiff is
to wear a kilt when Scotland are about to take the field at the Arms
Park.
Last year, after Wales had stuffed Scotland comprehensively, a
Scotsman playing the bagpipes stood on a table and held total sway in
Cardiff's Royal Hotel .. . . while Welshmen sang along in high spirits.
That victory set Wales off on their way to becoming Five Nations
champions; indeed, the points difference gained over Scotland was the
primary reason Wales finished above England in the table.
This time round the roles are reversed, as injuries have ripped the
heart out of this season's Welsh effort.
Wales have been unable to pick their first choice full back, left
wing, loose head or tight head for the trip to Murrayfield.
Add on the fact that they have also lost, at various stages of the
season, their right wing, outside centre, inside centre, scrum half, No
8, and blindside, and it is hardly any surprise that last season's
progress has stuttered and stumbled more than somewhat.
Ieuan Evans is a key man on the right wing as skipper and record try
scorer, but against England he looked more than a little short of the
sharpness that made him the world's best.
That is hardly surprising, given that when Evans broke his ankle many
thought it would end his career altogether, and certainly few thought it
possible for him to be playing international rugby again so soon.
Evans is improving game by game, but will probably not be back to his
usual dynamic self until the World Cup.
Of the injured players who returned against England, only centre Nigel
Davies looked fully involved, while back row men Cmyr Lewis and Hemi
Taylor both appeared anonymous after lengthy lay-offs.
Again, that was hardly surprising, and two weeks back in training will
make a considerable difference to the pair who have forged such an
influential partnership for top-of-the-table Cardiff.
Wales have not scored a try against South Africa, France or England,
and the main criticism for that has been directed at the back line in
general and outside half Neil Jenkins in particular.
Someone of his outstanding kicking ability has to be kept in the side
somewhere, it is generally agreed, but perhaps his future is at inside
centre of full back.
Today's game against Scotland could even represent a last chance for
Jenkins to prove he can transfer his excellent form for Pontypridd on to
the international stage, although criticism of hims is often unfair
given the abilities he displays at club level.
Yet form does not always matter for this fixture, anyway.
Two years ago Wales arrived in Edinburgh full of high spirits, having
annihilated England 10-7 at Cardiff, and were in turn taken to the
cleaners up front as the Scots whitewashed them 20-0.
The way the pack was destroyed was a major motivating factor in the
Welsh forward performance last season, and no doubt it will get a few
mentions again this time round to ensure there is no repeat.
Yet this is a shadow of the Welsh side that did well last season.
Apart from the players missing, there are others who still appear short
of full match fitness.
In the front row, where two replacements were need, they have opted
for the massive experience of Mike Griffiths on the loose head and the
raw potential of Spencer John on the tight head.
John will be no easy touch for Scotland, having stood up impressively
to the first choice South African eight when Llanelli played the
tourists in October.
For all that, Wales will be firm underdogs, and not too many Welsh
supporters will let defeat get in the way of their enjoyment.
Two weeks later, all Wales will be with Scotland in spirit when they
head South to Twickenham, trying to succeed where the Welsh failed in
lowering the colours of mighty England.
Even the Welsh tend to think that game might be more important.

Some Welsh
guys were
legends, and
we knew we
faced a real
battle.
THERE is little doubt in the minds of two of Scotland's finest rugby
servants when asked where the 1971 encounter with Wales at Murrayfield
stands in the hit parade of really great games.
The Brown brothers, Peter and Gordon, put that game right at the top;
their memories are crystal clear, with not even a hint of regret that
they lost by a single point -- 19-18 -- in the dying minutes.
These memories came flooding back as we discussed the game. The years
rolled away as their excitement and enthusiasm gave the impression that
it had been played yesterday and not more than two decades previously.
Peter was captain that day, and remembers vividly his efforts to spur
his team on and quickly shake off the tag of underdogs.
He said: ''I remember that game as being pivotal in my career, and
perhaps in Scotland's fortunes.
''For too long we had been approaching games thinking we would do well
just to keep the score to a respectable level.
''I wanted these guys to believe they were up there among the best --
which they were -- and to bring their club form forward.
''We could not have picked a better match to put it to the test.''
The Welsh names just trip off the tongue: JPR Williams, Barry John,
Gareth Edwards, John Dawes, Mervyn Davies.
Gordon Brown recalled: ''These guys were already legends, and we knew
we faced a real battle.
''Peter had made us believe we could do it, and his message was to get
stuck in from the start and take the game to them.
''I will never forget it. The atmosphere was electric, and the lead
just kept changing hands. It was a cracking game, and for so-called
underdogs we were holding our heads up well.''
He went on: ''We were 18-14 ahead after Peter's conversion attempt
following Chris Rea's try hit an upright and bounced away.
''What happened next was a sickener, and will live with me for the
rest of my life.
''We had the throw-in at a line out. and Peter went to number two as a
decoy with the throw meant for me.
''I was confident, as I had been out-jumping Mike Roberts all day.
''Something went horribly wrong, and Dunky Paterson gave the signal
for the ball to go to Peter.
''Billy Steele threw to two and he was caught unawares.
''Delme Thomas just snaffled the ball,it was spun out to Gerald
Davies, and because we did not operate a drift defence like these days
the defence was stretched and he went over in the corner.
''I was raging and was tempted to charge early to put John Taylor off,
but something told me 'that's not rugby' and I did not. The rest, as
they say, is history.''
History indeed, and the stirring finale to what the history books
describe simply as ''one of the most exciting matches ever played'' came
as the bearded Taylor banged over a conversion from near the touchline.
But Scottish hearts did not sink, and final minutes were frantic as
they sought a last-gasp win. It was not to be, but Gordon recalls the
post-match festivities with glee:
''The hierarchy usually allowed champagne for the troops only when we
had won, but since it was so close and such a cracker of a game we got
on to the bubbly early on.
''By the later part of the evening we were having a session, and I
remember saying to the Welsh lads at one point 'What a game that was,
who was it who won again?'
''Don't get me wrong; I was gutted at the result, but very proud to
have taken part in a truly great game and to have put up such a
performance.
''Then it was on to Twickenham and the Lions tour. What a year . . .''
Peter Brown had been in the international squad since 1964, and as
captain was to have a major influence.
He said: ''It was in the days before coaches, and I remember that Bill
Dickinson had only just joined us as adviser but did not have much to
say.
''What was most important was the teamwork which came from working
together, some of us being with the same club and others having known
each other for a long time.
''Things had been a wee bit negative up until then, and while I would
not try to take the credit, I hope that I brought a fresh approach to
things.
''I believe it was an important milestone, because in that game I saw
an attitude in the team which showed they were not going to be overawed
by even this great Welsh side.
''That stood us in good stead that day and beyond. The records show
players in that team went on to share in great things for Scotland as
well as the Lions, and were great servants to their clubs. They just
needed to believe in themselves.''
The match is now in the annals of history as the Game of the 70s and
one of the best ever, and Peter took the opportunity after the recent
Canada international to refresh his memory with the aid of a video.
He said: ''We had friends over for the match and they asked if I had
footage from my playing days.
''I needed no second bidding to watch the Wales game from 1971 again.
It was as fresh and as exciting as it was on the day.''
The brothers share the hopes of all rugby followers that something
similar wil ensue at the new-look Murrayfield this afternoon.
With, a different outcome.

TAMPA: A Florida hospital where doctors accidentally cut the wrong
foot off a patient has begun a policy of requiring staff to write the
word ''No'' on patients' limbs that are not to be amputated. Willie
King, 51, had surgery to remove his gangrenous right foot at Tampa's
University Community Hospital on February 20 -- but a doctor removed his
left foot. A lawyer for Mr King, who remains in hospital, said staff
tried to cover up the error by refusing to say what had become of the
amputated foot and telling him it was bad anyway.

BEBE Moore Campbell's closest friend is white, a fact scarcely worth
mentioning except that beneath its slick conviviality America remains a
racially discordant country, and Bebe Moore Campbell is black. So, they
make an unusual pair, these lifelong girlfriends, Robin still living in
their home town of Philadelphia, and Bebe perched on a Los Angeles
hilltop, the better to spot the first fires and fractures of
California's expected Armageddon.
High School brought them together, but it was adulthood which
reassured Campbell, at least, that this friendship was based on
authentic regard, not curiosity, not condescension. It took that length
of time to feel comfortable in Robin's presence, she says, because --
even when the best motives prevail -- black people in white company
still find themselves on edge, ''waiting for the shoe to drop'', and
vestiges of racism to tumble out and scorch all hope.
Yet in the land where opportunity stands as a flagrant shrine on every
block, trust has never been a straightforard matter, not even in the
ruling club of whites. What makes Campbell's latest novel so relevant
and forceful is its depiction of a world so much on guard against
everyone it sees virtue in betrayal.
Set in the uneasy aftermath of the Los Angeles riots, Brothers and
Sisters' central characters are not the ethnic underclass but a cast of
banking executives whose instinctive discrimination travels by stealth,
driving on their careers but muddling intimate emotions. Esther Jackson
is one of a handful of black officials at Angel City National Bank.
Ambition has stranded her beyond her race, leaving her with fewer
options on whom to marry and her very success merely aggravates Esther's
own pain at the black community's unremitting sense of loss.
This is Campbell's third novel although she has been an author for 16
years, producing such non-fiction works as Successful Women, Angry Men,
and Backlash in the Two-career Marriage. Her insights into the shabby
sophistication of American corporate life are particularly good but it
is her incisive ability to go to the heart of contemporary problems
which makes her a compelling storyteller.
She sees her success as an indication that despite the lingering
imbalance of power, opportunities for blacks are improving in certain
fields. ''They used to say that black people didn't read books, that
they didn't buy books, and that white folk wouldn't buy books written by
blacks. These myths have finally been laid to rest and it's a good time
from that point of view.''
But her optimism does not extend much beyond the immediate horizon.
''My generation, the children of the fifties and sixties, were the first
of wholesale integration in America and we seized the chances with what
could be called an immigrant hunger. But among one's own people very
often the person who breaks out and succeeds is alternately praised and
damned. It still takes Herculean effort to get free of social and racial
obstacles and not every sister and brother can find the required
strength.''
Her own life has always been solidly middle-class. Campbell is married
to a Los Angeles banker and each has an adult child by a first marriage.
Her own parents were both college-educated and she, an only child, was
encouraged to excel. ''But it's always hard for the strivers, and for
educated black women today it's harder than ever because although they
have more chances they do not have the emotional back-up at home.
Neither do they have obvious mentors to guide them through the corporate
maze.''
Like every child, Bebe Moore Campbell was tutored on the adage that
you had to be as good as a white person to get half as far. ''I didn't
want to pass on that dictum to my daughter because I was anxious not to
force pressures on her. But then I saw that she thought life was going
to be as easy for her as it was for a white kid. So, I had to point out
that her father had a master's degree in business administration but his
boss had a college diploma. 'Now why do you think that is?' I asked her.
And that was frightening and shocking to her, in a way it had not been
for me.''
Part of Campbell's skill is her convincing portrayal of white and
black sensibilities. None of her characters exists simply as urban
texture, but she herself feels her colour every day. ''I was on a book
tour in Mississippi a few years ago and my driver was white. We went for
lunch together and as we walked into the restaurant I noticed I was the
only black person there.'' She never felt her colour so intensely as
that moment, everyone looking at her with contempt, wondering about the
significance of this mixed-race couple.
Since then her adopted hometown has known riot, fire, earthquake, and
flood, and of these the violence was, for Campbell, the most terrifying.
''The quake and aftershocks were very frightening but they were over in
seconds. The riots were a three-day war. I looked down the hillside and
I saw flames in the downtown districts being fuelled by uncontrollable
human anger.'' She hopes it was an aberration, but much about Los
Angeles still suggests hostile territory where the only victor is rough
nature of any sort.

* MURRAYFIELD became ''Worryfield'' for Welshmen when, in front of a
then record crowd of 80,000 in 1951, a young Scottish side demolished
the Welsh 1950 Grand Slam champs by the then spectacular margin of 19-0.
The Welsh, containing 11 British Lions, were outplayed.
Sadly, Scotland were not to win again until 1955 and Wales were once
again the visitors when the run of 17 consecutive defeats came to an
end.
* SCOTLAND scored their first win in Cardiff since 1927 in 1962. The
Scottish second row comprising Franz ten Bos and Mike Campbell-Lamerton
weighed-in at 34-plus stones.
The Scots had to wait more than 20 years before repeating the feat.

* SCOTLAND and Wales first met in rugby combat at Raeburn Place in
Edinburgh on January 8, 1883. Under the then scoring values, Scotland
won by three goals to one.
Mystery surrounds the make-up of the Welsh team. One R H Bridie, who
became domiciled in Swansea via Greenock, was selected and listed to
play.
However, he seems to have been replaced by W B Norton of Cardiff.
* THE Scotland v Wales encounter at Raeburn Place in 1895 was the game
of the short pitch.
After the protective straw had been removed, the north end of the
ground was found to be frost-bound.
The Welshmen refused to play unless the offending portion was ruled
out of bounds.
The game went ahead on a pitch that was 18 yards shorter than usual.
Scotland won 5-4.
* MENTION Scotland v Wales at Murrayfield in 1963 and the cognoscenti
will respond: Welshman Clive Rowlands's match.
Wales won 6-0, but the most fantastic statistic were the 111 lineouts
which had taken place in the course of the game.
Scrum half Rowlands kicked his side up and down the touchline to the
benefit of his team, but to the boredom of the crowd.

GAVIN
HASTINGS
Watsonians, captain
Age 33, 6ft 2ins,
14st 8lb, 54 caps
Scored the try and kicked the conversion that provided Scotland with
their historic first win in Paris for 26 years. Today wins 55th capand
is Scotland's most capped player. Has made six Test appearances for the
British Lions, and captained the tourists in New Zealand in 1993.
CRAIG JOINER
Melrose
Age 20, 5ft 10ins,
13st 10lb, 5 caps
Making his fourth consecutive apearance in a Scotland shirt, having
won his first two caps on last summer's tour to Argentina. Made his
Murrayfield debut against the Canadians six weeks ago. A former member
of Scottish schools sprint squad, he has played for his country at U18,
U19 and U21 levels. Also a member of the successful 'A' team that beat
South Africa and Italy.
GREGOR
TOWNSEND
Gala
Age 21, 5ft 11ins,
13st 8lb, 10 caps
Gained first cap as a replacement for the injured Craig Chalmers
against England in 1993. It was his break and deft pass that led to
Hastings's priceless Parc des Princes try a fortnight ago. Townsend has
also worn the Scotland shirt at inside centre and fly-half, his club
position.
SCOTT HASTINGS
Watsonians
Age 30, 6ft 1in,
13st 4lb, 51 caps
Returns to the side after falling out of favour following the defeat
by South Africa last November. Back because of the cheek injury
sustained by Ian Jardine in Paris. Hastings, who today equals Scottish
record for a centre set by Hawick's Jim Renwick, is vastly experienced
with British Lions honours from both 1989 and 1993.
KENNY LOGAN
Stirling County
Age 22, 6ft 1in,
13st 8lb, 13 caps
His club's first internationalist, he achieved the honour when capped
against Australia during 1992 tour. Confidence has provided a tonic for
the Scots when they were going through the recent bad patch. Has
represented Scotland at U-18, U-19, and U-21. Logan has appeared three
times for Scotland A and has toured South Seas and Argentina.
CRAIG
CHALMERS
Melrose
Age 26, 5ft 10ins,
13st 6lb, 39 caps
Wins fortieth cap today. Against France a fortnight ago his tackling
was immense. In recent games has begun to recapture the commanding
presence he displayed since debut as a youngster against Wales in 1989
when he scored a drop goal and a try. A British Lion in Australia the
same year, when he played in the first Test and scored a drop goal and a
penalty goal.
BRYAN
REDPATH
Melrose
Age 23, 5ft 7ins,
10st 10lb, 8 caps
Unusually, won first two caps as a replacement (against NZ in 1993 and
England in 1994). Redpath made debut as a first-choice player against
France in 1994, following Gary Armstrong hand injury against Ireland.
Forms an all-Melrose half-back partnership with Craig Chalmers and has
played five times for Scotland 'A'.
DAVID HILTON
Bath
Age 24, 5ft 10ins,
16st 4lb, 3 caps
Came to the notice of selectors after a series of impressive
performances with the Scottish Exiles. Owes his selection to an
Edinburgh-born paternal grandfather. Enlisted for the Scotland 'A' sides
that beat South Africa and Italy and played well against the Canadians a
fortnight ago.
KENNY MILNE
Heriot's FP
Age 33, 6ft,
15st 12lb, 34 caps
Has assumed the mantle of one of the veterans of pack. He is the
youngest of three brothers to have played in the Scotland front row. The
family chalked up a unique record when, with Iain and David, the
Scotland hooker made up the Barbarians front row against East Midlands
in 1989. Scotland's 1990 Grand Slam hooker, toured with the 1993 Lions
in New Zealand, playing in the first Test.
PETER WRIGHT
Boroughmuir
Age 27, 6ft,
17st 2lb, 9 caps
In devastating form for his club this season, where his strong running
off ruck and maul has been a feature of the Boroughmuir game-plan.
Equally at home in scrummage or in the wide open praires. Despite his
prowess with ball in hand, Wright is also a strong scrummager. A British
Lion in New Zealand in 1993.
DODDIE WEIR
Melrose
Age 24, 6ft 6ins,
16st 2lb, 25 caps
Returns to the side today by virtue of the injury to Damian Cronin.
Came on at half time in Paris and performed with determination to retain
his place. Has played 15 times at lock and 10 at No8, is his preferred
position. Weir's added height will be a bonus in the lineout.
STEWART
CAMPBELL
Dundee HSFP
Age 22, 6ft 6ins,
16st 8lb, 3 caps
Made debut against Canada six weeks ago. He has been in international
rugby in three age-groups and was with West of Scotland before
architectural studies took him to Dundee. Has played three times for
Scotland 'A' and toured Argentina last summer.
ROB
WAINWRIGHT
West Hartlepool
Age 29, 6ft 4ins,
15st 4lb, 10 caps
The Army doctor probably prefers to play at No.8, but his versatility
at international level has seen him enlisted in the role of flanker,
No.8, and as a replacement lock. A Cambridge Blue, he played a stormer
in last season's Calcutta Cup game, scoring a try, before sustaining a
jaw fracture.
IAIN MORRISON
London Scottish
Age 32, 6ft 1in,
15st 11lb, 9 caps

CONSIDERING the knackering domination of work and money over most
people's lives, the fact that so few works of imagination have been
written about either must, as Archy the cockroach poet says, give one
furiously to think about the futility of literature. Welcome exceptions
are the Granta symposium Money (Penguin, #7.99, ed. Bill Buford) and Ben
Hamper's scabrous memoir Rivethead: Tales From The Assembly Line (Fourth
Estate, #7.99), which both gatecrash their subjects into the salon of
art, scarfing up the free drinks and asking the other guests vulgar
questions about how much they earn and what they do for a living.
This edition of Granta comprises 13 prose and photographic essays,
recollections, and polemics on the filthy subject of lucre. Funniest is
Richard Rayner's confession of a life of crime at Cambridge, graduating
from lifting books out of Foyle's to Raffles-style country-house
burglary via sweaty safaris of fraud with stolen chequebooks and cards.
Best is Jonathan Raban's journey through the foreclosed farmlands of
America's MidWest; all the rest are merely very, very good.
Ben Hamper's Rivethead, an exhilaratingly funny true story of life in
a General Motors factory in Flint, Michigan from the late 1970s through
the middle 1980s, will bring a smile of recognition to anyone who ever
had the same kind of job in the years of Western industrial capitalism's
last hurrah. High wages, strong unions, shop-floor camaraderie, and
ample opportunity for a little offhand anarchy; the downside was
monotony, alienation, bad booze habits, and brain death, but these were
as near to being good old days as Johnny Paycheck ever saw.
The madness got to Hamper in the end, but not before famed local
journalist and TV documentarist Michael Moore made him a magazine
columnist (''I, Rivethead'') and encouraged him to write this brilliant
book. Studs Terkel, eat your heart out.
Keith Waterhouse had the bad luck to write his best book (Billy Liar)
very early in his career, then degenerate gradually into a curmudgeonly
old newspaper columnist. City Lights: A Street Life (Sceptre, #6.99),
however, finds him more like his own self, a wry Northern humorist with
a photographic memory and a poignant gift for evoking the past. This
amiable memoir of childhood, adolescence, and professional beginnings in
1940s and 1950s Leeds will charm all but the sternest foes of
grim-up-north nostalgia.
Back to money, dirtier than ever, and Mad Frank (Warner, #5.99), the
ghosted autobiography of the vicious London gangster Frankie Fraser. The
very existence of such books is regrettable, of course, but, as this one
proves, you can't separate the glamour from 1960s London villainy (the
cars, suits, and haircuts were terrific) any more than you can take the
thrill out of sex, war, or The Rolling Stones. Serious 1960s buffs
should pinch a friend's copy -- it seems appropriate -- and give the
cover price to charity. Mad Frank probably doesn't need it.

SCOTTISH education authorities will be unable to meet the Government's
deadline for implementing the Higher Still blueprint for reforming
upper-secondary schooling, it was claimed yesterday.
According to the Scottish Office timetable, pupils will begin Higher
Still courses in August 1997.
However, Councillor Elizabeth Maginnis, convener of the education
committee of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla), said
there was no realistic prospect of councils meeting the target.
Speaking after a meeting of the committee yesterday, she said cuts in
council budgets, imposed by the Government, and impending local
government reform were putting so much pressure on education authorities
that something would have to give.
She said: ''We do not want the Higher Still development to stop but we
do not believe the timetable is realistic.''
Councillor Maginnis, who also convenes Lothian region's education
committee, said the authority's schools were already being pushed to the
limits because of spending cuts.
Staffing levels in some secondary schools would fall below Scottish
Education Department standards for the first time, because Lothian could
not afford to replace 75 teaching posts which would become vacant, she
claimed.
The Scottish Office has said that, across Scotland, 500 teachers would
be needed to work on developing subject areas in line with the
blueprint.
Councillor Maginnis said authorities had insufficient funds from the
Government to cover for staff needed for the development stage. ''I
cannot see us being able to release staff in line with the present
timetable,'' she said.
Many senior local authority officers were taking early retirement,
particularly from the big regions, such as Strathclyde and Lothian,
which were being broken up and replaced by the smaller, single-tier
councils, the councillor added.
Those who were left would not be available in sufficiently large
numbers for the management and planning of Higher Still because they
would be needed to disaggregate the present authorities, she claimed.
The Government maintains that the Higher Still timetable is
challenging but argues that it must be pursued to produce a system of
schooling which will meet, as quickly as possible, the needs of the
growing number of young people who are staying on beyond the age of 16.
A Scottish Office spokesman said last night: ''We have made resources
totalling #4m available. Good progress has been made on the development
programme. The staff development programme is well under way, which will
help teachers implement the changes.''
Cosla, however, is seeking a meeting with Scottish Education Minister
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton to put the case for extending the deadline.
Higher Still will build on the present Higher, the Certificate of
Sixth Year Studies, and Scotvec's mainly-vocational awards. National
Certificate awards will be linked with longer Higher and new Advanced
Higher courses in a unified system based on modules, or short chunks of
learning, to give academic and vocational courses equal weight.

THE BLACK ALBUM
Hanif Kureishi
Faber &amp; Faber, #14.99
IN Hanif Kureishi's new novel the shroud of fundamentalism may be
covering the world, but it doesn't fit. Religion is too tight and
constricting, besides it looks bad, all wrapped up in black and white.
So, like a tailor whose words are scissor-sharp, he plays Joseph and
cuts his own slick multi-coloured suit from the old shroud, mixing
browns and pinks. Then pulling on the forgotten banner of youth culture,
the smiley-faced T-shirt, he rolls off to a rave.
Kureishi hangs his heart on the coat he created for Shahid, a young
student who paddles among the sweat of 1989 and the early rave culture.
It is in pursuit of his lecturer and to distance himself from the
dullness of inherited success that Shahid finds himself in the
kaleidoscope of house parties.
Reflected through the distorted lens of love his life does not seem to
satisfy him. As an Englishman in all manners but skin he walks an
isolated path trying to play pick 'n' mix with religion and drugs. While
around him so many mainline simply one or the other. People like Chad, a
reformed druggie now buzzed out of his brain on the opiate of the masses
or Shahid's brother who has lost his soul among a pile of Armani suits,
car keys, and cocaine. But it's Riaz, the fundamentalist guru, who heats
the broth with a batch of book-burning.
The book is never named but the Satanic Verses is the noose on which
those times hung. God, this is a great novel which takes an era lacking
the clarity which distance can lend and gives it form with fun and wit
and tinges of fear. Holding your hand it leads you past that which you
remember and that which you chose to forget. As one wall collapsed
another was built.
Here divisions stand erect on religious, sexual, and political
grounds. But there is a core of dark laughter and enough sexual heat to
fire up a furnace. Laughs are lassooed by the central idea that a sacred
text has been scrolled by God inside an aubergine. Ha-ha, until
Rushdie's novel appears and the fundamentalists wish to fight
metaphysical fire with actual flame. This is a sleek coming-of-age novel
without the hindrance of literary flotsam such as woolly passages or
wooden characters.
The title is taken from the previously unavailable album from Prince
and the fact it has now been re-released gives the novel a transient
feel as if the pages might crumble with time. In an essay on the
Beatles, Kureishi once wrote that ''you can't dance to novels''. The
Black Album, however, is a novel with a strong pulse and a lot of swing.
If you can catch it you too can wear a coat of many colours and dance in
your bedroom until dawn.

A YOUNG father who shook his 10-week-old baby daughter so violently
that she suffered brain damage and was blinded, had his eight-year
sentence cut to five years yesterday.
Paul Klein, 21, was found guilty by a majority verdict at the High
Court in Edinburgh in December 1993 of assaulting his daughter Danielle
to her severe injury, permanent impairment, and the danger of her life.
Klein, formerly of Orchard Field, East Linton, East Lothian, had
denied attacking his daughter in East Linton in September 1992.
Temporary judge, Mr Robin McEwan QC, told him: ''The jury has
convicted you of a truly terrible crime of an attack on a helpless,
innocent child. As a result, your own daughter has been left blinded
with hearing impairment and also, to some extent, spastic and
brain-damaged.''
The judge lifted reporting restrictions which would have prevented the
media from identifying Klein.
At the time of the incident, Klein said he could not explain how the
baby had been injured and he denied in court that he had lost patience
with her and shaken her.
Yesterday, he appeared at the Court of Criminal Appeal with a
prominent scar down the right side of his face.
His counsel, Mr Herbert Kerrigan QC, told the judges that the injury
had been inflicted in custody. Because of the nature of the offence,
other inmates regarded him as a ''beast''.
''He has suffered grievously and has to have special protection at all
times,'' said Mr Kerrigan. He argued that the eight-year sentence was
excessive.
The trial had heard that Klein had seemed to be a doting young father
and that Danielle's mother, Miss Michelle Spence, had no qualms about
leaving the baby in his care.
Unusually, in a case of this kind, Miss Spence and her family were
still highly supportive of Klein. Miss Spence took Danielle to visit him
in prison five times a month.
Lord Hope, who presided at the appeal, said this was a case where the
child had sustained grave injuries and the court did not wish to
minimise the seriousness of the offence.
However, in all the circumstances, they had decided that eight years
was an excessive sentence and could be replaced by a sentence of five
years.
After the appeal, Michelle Spence said she was very happy that the
sentence had been cut and she looked forward to Klein being free next
year.

THE BOARDMAN TASKER OMNIBUS
Joe Tasker and Peter Boardman
Hodder and Stoughton, #14.99
WHEN, 10 years ago, we sat in a Glasgow bar and went through a list of
his dead friends, the mountaineer Chris Bonington told me: ''None of
these guys had a death wish. They were all very rational people. You are
doing something which you love doing and you know there is a high risk.
If you look at the individual who gets killed he is usually going out at
the height of his life.''
Tasker and Boardman certainly did just that. They died together,
climbing under Bonington's leadership in an attempt to scale Everest by
the then-unclimbed North-east Ridge in 1982 and leaving behind them a
stunning record of Alpine-style Himalayan ascents -- climbing with
minimal assistance and far from help at the outer edges of commitment.
It was that aspect of their characters, the need to push to the outer
limits of human capabilities, that is the key to their lives and to
their deaths.
Bonington, one senses -- from both meeting the man and studying his
many books -- has a streak of innate caution in his make-up which is why
he survived that innovative period in mountaineering history while
others, perhaps more daring, perished.
In his own book, The Everest Years, he deals in the lead-up to the
deaths of Boardman and Tasker with his doubts about his own chances of
making the climb without oxygen, admitting that from the earliest
planning stage he saw them as slim. He would have been as happy to have
fulfilled his own Everest ambitions by climbing the less-exacting North
Col route but he knew that the others wanted to try the great unknown.
He enjoyed climbing with them for their company and for their
superlative ability but he had to face the reality that because of his
age he could not keep up with them, doubting even if he had the strength
of will to reach their previous high point.
The events which followed, where Bonington watched by telescope as
Tasker and Boardman, by now tiny dots on the great ridge, struggled
upwards for 14 hours, vanishing at nightfall never to be seen again,
conclude one of the most moving chapters in mountaineering literature.
Tasker and Boardman, apart from being one of the great climbing
partnerships, each left behind two books which have been gathered
together in omnibus form. Both were superb writers, able to capture the
spirit of adventure which so fascinates those of us bound by desk,
mortgage, and encroaching middle age, but also capable of a degree of
introspection which offers explanations and insights into this
apparently pointless area of extreme human endeavour. There is also an
undercurrent of fun. As he and Dick Renshaw walked back along the line
to Lauterbrunnen, having just made the first British winter ascent of
the Eiger's north wall, Tasker recalled their encounter with the
stationmaster. He asked where they had come from, how many days, nodded
and then said: ''It is forbidden to walk on the railway line.''
It was the same at Alpiglen. They took the train anyway and had to pay
a fine. An incredulous Englishman at the hotel asked: ''You mean you
only bought one-way tickets?''

IT'S good to have the right family connections. When Labour MP Tam
Dalyell was asked to give the James Maxton Memorial Lecture at
Hutchesons' Grammar School in Glasgow, he simply asked his mother-in-law
what the famous Red Clydesider had been like.
Lady Wheatley, 89, had been secretary of Shettleston Independent
Labour Party when Maxton, the fiery speaker, was MP for Glasgow
Bridgeton.
When Mr Dalyell told her he was going to speak to the senior pupils of
one of Glasgow's most famous schools about Maxton, she told him somewhat
tersely: ''Well, you'd better tell them he was a chancer.''
Unwilling to fall out with his mother-in-law, Mr Dalyell chose his
words carefully yesterday when he told the pupils: ''I think that's
perhaps less than generous.''
Maxton, one of the founders of what became today's Labour Party,
probably accentuated his humble origins in his heyday but, the truth is,
he was a former pupil of Hutchie, although he distinguished himself more
in the swimming pool than in the classroom, according to his school
records.
Nevertheless, the school is honouring its former pupil with an annual
lecture, the first of which was given yesterday by Mr Dalyell on the
role of the back bencher.
Followers of Mr Dalyell's parliamentary career were keen to see how he
could switch from the life of John Maxton to one of his favourite
hobby-horses such as the sinking of the Belgrano, the Gulf war, or the
Lockerbie bombing. They were not disappointed.
Maxton, said Mr Dalyell, was a considerable orator, a rouser of
passions; a great man no, but a gifted one yes. One of his strengths was
in challenging opinions and conventional wisdoms -- such as Mr Dalyell
himself has done over the Lockerbie bombing.
It was then time to settle down and hear a detailed exposition about
why he believes the Lockerbie bombing was not carried out by two Libyans
but by Syrian-trained terrorists paid for by Iran in retaliation for the
Iranian Airbus shot down by a US cruiser in the Gulf, killing 290
pilgrims.
Names, places, dates, and details were systematically explained by Mr
Dalyell without the need of any notes, as he told the 100 or so pupils
how it suited the US and UK Governments to blame an uninfluential state
like Libya rather than Syria or Iran, whose support would be required in
the ''ill-conceived'' Gulf war.
He asserted that American embassies warned their officials not to
travel on that flight because of terrorist warnings, which allowed 32
university students to get last- minute cancellations and thus ''get on
the flight which took them to their doom''.
Not everyone agrees with Mr Dalyell, of course, but there is no
doubting his ability to garner facts and present a well-argued case.
He could have had problems when one of the Hutchie pupils asked him:
''If it was the case that the American Embassies had been warned, why
were CIA agents killed in the mid-air explosion?''
''A very good question,'' replied Mr Dalyell, who then named the six
CIA agents who were killed and explained the theory that there was great
rivalry between the Drug Enforcement Agency and the CIA, coupled with
allegations of official involvement in certain drug-running operations.
The rivalry led to information not being freely available to everyone.
It was a fine delivery, even though many people doubt his version of
events. Perhaps if Mr Dalyell was looking for some symbolic sign of
support he should have looked above him in the school hall to the
Hutchesons' Grammar school crest. It has a simple one-word motto.
Veritas.

THE biggest closed-circuit television system in Scotland was switched
on officially in Stirling yesterday.
Nearly 40 anti-crime video cameras have been installed to monitor
town-centre streets and public areas at a cost of #600,000.
Central Scotland Police say the system will leave no hiding place for
the thug and the vandal.
Chief Constable William Wilson said town-centre crime had fallen 40%
since the system came on stream at Christmas.
It was switched on offically by Mrs Janet McVeen from Wellgreen
Residential Home, who will be 100 this month, and pupils from the Allan
Primary School. Both establishments lie within the area covered by the
system.
A bank of screens at Central Scotland Police headquarters will be
monitored by eight disabled operators supplied by Remploy working shifts
round the clock.
Constable Iain Hay, in charge of the system, said: ''The streets of
Stirling will be safer for everyone. We'll be able to have officers on
the scene of an incident in minutes and we'll be able to track criminals
on camera until they arrive.''

A STRIKE threat at Monktonhall Colliery has been lifted after a row
over bonuses was resolved yesterday.
Workers at the Midlothian pit had walked out on Thursday in a dispute
over monthly bonus payments.
The pit's personnel manager, Mr Jackie Aitchison, said the matter had
been nothing more than a local dispute and had been sorted out at a
meeting.
However, some miners felt they had been badly treated. One said: ''We
did react badly over the problems of paying our bonuses. We have been
told we will get what is due to us but we'll be keeping a close eye on
what's happening.''
Mr Aitchison denied suggestions that management was creating a ''them
and us'' situation at the pit, which is run along the lines of a
workers' co-operative.
He revealed his pay-slip, saying: ''The men get paid the same as me.''

THE president of the Scottish School Board Association has revealed
she was warned in a veiled threat not to attend a meeting to establish a
board at a village school.
Mrs Ann Hill had been invited to speak at Auchenblae Primary School
near Laurencekirk when she received a telephone call from someone
purporting to be a Sunday newspaper journalist.
The caller asked if she was worried about ''Scottish Watch''. He also
made reference to letter bombs.
Mrs Hill said yesterday: ''I told him 'For goodness sake, it's only a
meeting about a school board'. I can only think he was trying to
persuade me not to go to the meeting so it would be cancelled.''
Mrs Hill immediately contacted the police to report the call and
Grampian Police Special Branch, having assessed the risks, alerted the
Laurencekirk constable.
The meeting, organised by a small group of parents at the school,
which has about 85 pupils, went ahead. However, there was a frank and
fearless exchange of views.
The phrase ''white settlers'' was used more than once, although at
least two of the targets of the name-calling are from within Scotland.
Mrs Hill said yesterday: ''The meeting was ludicrous. It was filled
with hatred and it was nothing to do with school boards.
''I was just piggy in the middle. It was clearly the village against
the incomers.
''There were references to 'white settlers'. I said that if the
feelings were so strong my advice was to forget about a school board.''
According to a report in the Times Educational Supplement, Mrs Hill
was shadowed by Special Branch officers during her visit to the school
which was searched for bombs before her arrival.
However, like other stories circulating in the village, that appears
to have been exaggerated.
Grampian Police confirmed yesterday they had been informed of the
abusive call to Mrs Hill but the only action necessary was to alert the
local police officer to pay passing attention.
There also appears to be no substance to the story that dog excrement
was smeared on doors and cow dung flung at those keen to see the
establishment of the board.
Mr Brian Walker, area education manager for Kincardine and Deeside,
said yesterday he believed the report by the Times Educational
Supplement to be ''a touch sensational''.
He said: ''There were fairly strong views by the groups from either
side. There was a small group of parents who wanted to form a board with
the majority of parents against.''
He added that he had undertaken to carry out a survey on their views
and that would be completed within a week.
Parents in Auchenblae were unwilling to be identified but several said
they believed the situation had been blown out of proportion.
One of the board supporters declined to comment, saying: ''We have to
live here.''
The apparent catalyst for the atmosphere of resentment was the
expression of interest by some parents last October in setting up a
board because they did not believe the parent-teacher association was
meeting their needs.
The group wrote to Grampian Regional Council but did not seek to
compel the region to hold a ballot, which they could have done at the
demand of only four parents.
Opponents of the board say the school is running well without it and
there was no consultation with the community before the idea was
floated.
Mrs Hill said last night she believed there was a serious
communication problem and if that was sorted out things might improve.

Luke Jennings
Hutchinson, #14.99
LUKE Jennings has made an ambitious attempt to analyse a defining
moment. This novel novel, set in 1947, creates a microcosm of British
society at the end of the Second World War and dissects the emotional
costs of winning in an attempt to merge the uncertainty of the future
with the horrors of the past.
It begins with 16-year-old Cato Parkes on a train journey from London
to the Ocean Docks, Southampton, bored while his father does the Times
crossword. They are to board the Carmelia bound for New York, where, we
learn later, Cato is to undergo heart surgery. The book ends with the
American coast in sight.
In between -- while Cato, his father and the other passengers are
stranded in the confines of the liner and against the backdrop of the
ocean -- a little of their pasts is gradually revealed. Their dreams and
disappointments, regrets and hopes are mingled, their predicament
revealed through the innocence of an adolescent boy who may be about to
die. They hope for life as surely as he does.
They have escaped the reality of a Europe destroyed in the Second
World War and are fleeing the death of an older culture to embrace
something new, rushing towards the American dream, partying as they go
to keep reality at bay. Images of other plush liners with carefree young
things, dance bands, rich food, and continuous parties, cannot fail to
emerge and it is to Luke Jennings's credit that having invited the
reader to make these connections he neither embellishes nor highlights
the association.
No-one is exactly as they seem. Cato is surprised when another
passenger calls his father Reggie, then wonders why the man felt he
ought to ''report in''. His father's military past and current
associations with the War Office seem less important than Cato's
continual fatigue. He knew from ''the dragging in his chest -- the stone
behind his ribs'' that he could not walk the length of the ship in dock.
There is little spare information. The difficulty is disseminating
what information is available, separating simple period references to
the likes of Picture Post and Gold Flake -- there is even a Pathe News
crew on the dockside -- from the range of characters and the fact that
they seem compelled to tell something of themselves at first meeting.
Another problem is the way this information is revealed. At one point
Cato asks a fellow passenger: ''Tell me about yourself.''
This gives a journalistic feel to some of the writing, as though
Jennings was ensuring the important points were covered. Which contrasts
sharply with a number of passages where he uses the information to
extend the narrative, teasing the wonderful metaphor he has established
to its full potential.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the information he gives about
the ship. The physical details are simple reminders of bulk and
capacity, but when they are augmented with menus and games, pursuits and
even the language, the clipped phrases and casual nicknames of the time,
the effect is to underline both the society the passengers have
abandoned and the hopelessness of the atmosphere.
For they are lost. They long for a new beginning, but cannot free
themselves from the changes war has made. They are literally all at sea,
on the run, their futures indistinct, their pasts hopeless. The world
has changed though they may not know it, far less be able to accept the
consequences.
No where is this hopelessness better exemplified than in Cato's early
discoveries. The Carmelia was a troopship which has been recently
refurbished. Passengers settle into their classified cabins as
comfortably as they hope to settle into their new society. The future is
not as certain as the classifications suggest.

SCOTLAND face Wales at Murrayfield today, the 99th time they have
clashed in a series that stretches back to 1883.
But has there ever been a more crucial meeting between the Thistle and
the Dragon?
A victory for Scotland this afternoon will set the side up for a Grand
Slam showdown with England in a fortnight's time.
The prospect is mouth-watering, but Scotland manager Duncan Paterson
is not the man to be counting his chickens before they have hatched.
He has dubbed today's game the Grand Slam semi-final. He knows it will
be tough, and with typical earthiness declares:
''Nobody much remembers beaten semi-finalists, so there is everything
to play for today.''
In the immediate afterglow of Scotland's historic win over France in
Paris a fortnight ago, captain Gavin Hastings, too, was treating today's
game with the respect it deserves.
''The matches ahead are only going to get tougher. It was tough today
in Paris, but the game against Wales in a fortnight's time is going to
be the toughest yet.
''This is a young side and they have grown in confidence each time
out.
''Strangely enough, by winning three games on the trot, we have
created pressures for ourselves. But each time we have overcome that
pressure and have come up trumps.
''Every challenge that we have overcome has led to an even greater
challenge, and I am sure that against Wales the team spirit and
character which this side has displayed since we came together against
Canada will show itself again.''
Saturday, January 21, is the date on which Scotland's fortunes turned.
Nine games without a win, stretching back to 1993, was a dismal
statistic that seemed at one stage to be on the point of overwhelming
the Scotland camp.
Then, with a barrowload of recruits from the successful A side on
board, Scotland secured the pshychological boost that a win always
provides. They termed it the first rung on a long, long ladder.
Next time out, against Ireland, the Scotland captain became his
country's most capped player and the Scots maintained the winning habit
with a timely victory.
Then, in Paris, the Scots were given little or no chance of
overturning the 26-year hoodoo that has blighted Scottish sides.
But the Scots, and in particular Hastings, had not read the script.
In one of the great games of rugby union football they overcame the
Frenchmen and the baggage of historical precedent by logging the first
win on French soil since 1969.
The 78th minute try from Hastings, and Gregor Townsend's almost
lyrical break and ball-presentation which sent the captain in under the
posts, will become one of the momentous moments of the game.
Hastings's conversion which made it 23-21 in Scotland's favour was the
blue icing on an already sumptious cake.
The scene, then, is set for a mammoth struggle at Murrayfield today.
Six weeks ago, before the Scots set about rediscovering the nation's
rugby soul against Canada, none of this seemed possible.
Now anything is possible and, to paraphrase Lord Nelson at Trafalgar,
Scotland Expects . . .

REFLECTIONS OF EDEN:
My life with the orang-utans of Borneo
Birute M F Galdikas
Gollancz, #16.99
ORANG-UTANS are almost human, linked to us through a common ancestry
that comes right down to DNA. Orang-utans once struggled for survival
over large stretches of the planet but now survive only in the islands
of Borneo and Sumatra. Fewer than 30,000 survive.
Birute M F Galdikas arrived in Borneo in 1971 to study orang-utans in
the wild but long before that the intelligence of those apes was evident
to intelligent men. In his Ancient Metaphysics (1779-99), Scottish
philosopher Lord Monboddo declared himself convinced that the orang-utan
''is a human creature as much as any of us''. If orang-utans could talk,
thought Monboddo, they would leave many humans speechless.
In Thomas Love Peacock's satirical novel Melincourt (1817) Monboddo's
ideas are woven into the fabric of a romantic fiction about a lady who
is abucted by a lord then rescued by an intelligent ape, Sir Oran
Haut-ton. Sir Oran does not have to talk to assert his intelligence. His
kind actions speak volumes about his great virtues. Orang-utans are
kinder than some specimens of humankind, so Peacock suggests in poking
fun at the species.
Galdikas is entirely serious in her approach to orang-utans: ''They
are our relatives; they are our kin, the kin who never left the Garden
of Eden and thus never lost their innocence, kin who never made complex
tools, never used fire, and never went to war.'' A primatologist with an
impressive body of scholarly work behind her, she has the soul of a
lyrical poet.
Galdikas completed her education in Los Angeles where she met Louis
Leakey, the anthropologist who introduced Jane Goodall to chimpanzees
and encouraged Dian Fossey to study mountain gorillas in Africa. After a
lecture Leakey delivered in LA in 1969, Galdikas rushed up to him:
''Leakey had been looking for someone to study orang-utans. He was
already expecting me when I walked into his life. I left the lecture
hall in a daze.'' She could hardly wait to get into the wild but had to
hang round for financial support.
Thirty months after meeting Leakey, who raised money for her research,
Galdikas and her husband Rod left so-called civilised life behind and
went looking for orang-utans in Borneo. They headed for a hut in the
Tanjung Puting Reserve and set up a study site which Galdikas called
Camp Leakey after the man she adored as the founding, and funding,
father of her work.
She felt at home in the rain forest where one walk, for instance,
meant a Chrismas Eve encounter with a female orang-utan Galdikas named
Beth. Galdikas followed Beth around the forest for five days then wrote
to Leakey about her feeling of fellowship with the orang-utan. Leakey
was delighted for, after all, he was the man who believed women made
better observers than men. As if confirming Leakey's view, one female
orang-utan hit Galdikas's husband in the eye with a turd. Orang-utans
are big on body language and Rod understood and kept his distance.
But Galdikas kept closing in on orang-utans like Cara who kept on
eating banitan when approached by our author; and Howard who shrugged at
the sight of our author then began to eat banitan. Banitan is a round
green fruit that orang-utans will chew on for eight hours at a time.
Sounds antisocial but orang-utans are social creatures. When not chewing
on banitan they will play games, wrestling and boxing with their mates.
Sometimes Galdikas got too close for comfort. After she had spied on
Cara for several weeks, something snapped in the orang-utan. Cara
watched as Galdikas trapped herself betweeen two logs and the orang-utan
tried to crack down on the intruder: ''Cara wanted to kill me. She
stared straight into my eyes as she repeatedly pushed the snag in my
direction.'' Galdikas survived to tell the tale and forgive Cara for
this was no killer ape but a creature brought to breaking-point by the
repeated sight of a prowler on her patch.
Naturally, Galdikas cared passionately for Cara -- ''I spent more time
alone with her than with any other individual'' -- and Cara's son Carl
and daughter Cindy. When Cara, Carl, and Cindy died, Galdikas felt she
had lost a family and was furious at what she took to be cause of Cara's
death. Malnutrition. The steady destruction of the rain forest deprives
orang-utans of food and Cara was a victim of human encroachment.
Galdikas decided saving the rain forest is synonymous with saving
orang-utans.
She writes of female orang-utans being killed by poachers who then
capture the infants and sell them as pets. She writes of her mission to
return ex-captive orang-utans to the wild. She wants you to write to the
Orang-utan Foundation at 7 Kent Terrace, London NW1 4RP. And you will,
believe me, if you read this wonderfully persuasive book.

AN EXPERIMENT IN LOVE
Hilary Mantel
Viking, #15
HILARY Mantel's intelligent, funny, and disturbing new novel follows a
trinity of girls as they grow up into young women in the Britain of the
1960s and 70s. About experiment, social, sexual, and emotional, this
fiction also probes and dissects, brilliantly and experimentally, the
human heart and a divided society.
Though it grips, and there is a final, shocking revelation, it is a
novel to read less for plot than for the sensuous power of language, and
a carefully woven texture and structure. The self-conscious narrator
remarks that this narrative is (among other things) about appetite,
''its many aspects and dimensions''. It should be savoured, and the
aftertaste may linger.
The novel opens with the narrator staring at a newspaper photograph of
someone from her past, ''as if somewhere in the fabric of the paper,
somewhere in its weave, I might find a thread which would lead me
through my life, from where I was then, to where I am today''. And so
the novel's own threads are exposed: its concern with the processes of
memory -- ''an image blurring'' -- and the formative powers of
experience.
Carmel McBain looks back on her student days in London, in a women's
hall of residence; and, through them, further back, to childhood and
adolescence as a Catholic girl of Irish background in a Lancashire mill
town. Her father was a clerk (''I knew this from quite early in life,
because of my mother's habit of saying, 'Your father's not just a clerk,
you know'.''); her mother, ''made redundant from her job in the weaving
shed, went out cleaning houses''. Weaving, knitting, stitching, such
''women's work'' become a metaphor for the narrator's own task, and in
this narrative of a life, it is women who play the most significant
roles. At university, Carmel's old school friend Julianne, now studying
medicine, shows her a skeleton; it is female, she says, ''women's bones
are more interesting''. This is a typically suggestive detail. Carmel
has a lover, Niall, at Glasgow University -- but men are peripheral
here.
Carmel's difficult relationship with her mother is unsentimentally
drawn: ''I dimly remembered a time before she had been angry.'' This
bitter woman, ambitious for her clever daughter, pushes Carmel to win a
scholarship to ''the Holy Redeemer'', a ''better'' school. Here Carmel
meets Julianne, a confident, snobbish, doctor's daughter; their lives
become linked, and they go to university together, and share a room.
It is Julianne's picture in the paper that triggers Carmel's memories;
Julianne has become a psychotherapist treating the young, rich, famous
victims of ''Slimmers' Disease''. The significance of this becomes
clearer later in a narrative stuffed with references to food, as we
learn that Carmel starved herself as a student.
Significant, too, is Carmel's even older, deeper, childhood
relationship with Karina; these are uneasy bonds, to do with
''restitution''. Karina, with her ''deep, ingrained, organic
pessimism'', asserts her Englishness, but the narrator broods: ''It
torments me now but I am so vague: were her parents Polish, Ukrainian,
Estonian?'' Karina's mother may have a terrible past -- there are
references to cattle trucks -- and Karina herself is shunned and
despised, especially by Julianne, as a ''peasant''. Yet, as Carmel
diminishes, Karina eats and swells and -- without giving too much away
-- she wreaks her own revenge on those more privileged.
The evocation of an era, and the school and university sequences laced
throughout are highly entertaining, as Carmel remembers student
(socialist) politics, and the social gulfs in the classroom and between
the young women at Tonbridge Hall, who eye each other across the
breakfast table with envy, malice, and greed. And while there are echoes
of other writers, such as Margaret Atwood (Cats Eye, The Edible Woman),
these are self-conscious and playful: ''It would be nice if we went
about and talked like an Edna O'Brien novel. It would suit us.'' ''Yes,
it would become us,'' I said. ''We haven't the class for Girls of
Slender Means.'' This last reference, to a Muriel Spark novel, is a
reminder that critics have compared Mantel to Spark. Rightly so, for her
prose, like Spark's, is precise and witty, with darker threads among the
light.
Yet Mantel's manner and concerns are ultimately her own, and her
already substantial body of fiction shows enviable range and depth: a
historical novel, A Place of Greater Safety, a kind of psychological
thriller, Eight Months on Gazzah Street, and several works more
difficult to classify. Her last, highly acclaimed novel, entitled A
Change of Climate, is now out in paperback (Penguin, #5.99), to join the
others.
Towards the end of An Experiment In Love, Carmel, studying law, reads
''the case of Thomas . . . Bradbury (1906) in which an author sued a
malicious book reviewer and won''. Ill luck to the critic who should
presume to greater insight or a sharper pen than the excellent Hilary
Mantel.

SINGAPORE: The pregnable fortress
Peter Elphick
Hodder and Stoughton, #20
THE fall of Singapore in February 1942 was a major British military
disaster. Indeed it might even be seen as a European disaster for it
ended the three Western empires, French and Dutch as well as British, in
Asia. Later attempts to re-establish them proved to be shortlived. Much
like Humpty Dumpty, the pieces could not be put back again. The Japanese
success -- at sea as well as on land -- had been too overwhelming for
any notion of innate European military superiority to survive.
So much has been written about this experience that it might seem that
any further work, certainly a general one of this nature, would be
redundant. Not a bit. Peter Elphick has dredged up much new material and
subjected old to new consideration. He may not change the general lines
but he gives many of them fresh definition. He also suggests that more
of interest has yet to emerge since he identifies areas in the Public
Records which remain sealed, including potentially vital data about
possible British awareness of the intended Japanese assault on Pearl
Harbor (though this is speculation).
This account certainly damages the value of the Official History of
the campaign (in The War Against Japan, Volume I) which pulled too many
punches in its assessment of the Imperial effort. Major General Kirby,
its main author, wrote a more stringent assessment later, but Elphick
thinks it still pulled punches, particularly in dealing with political
matters.
The Japanese won (and took heavier casualties) in spite of a distinct
numerical inferiority. Their morale was superb. Morale was poor on the
other side. It proved to be very poor among Indian troops who were
affected by Japanese propaganda about Asian solidarity. It was also
extremely poor among Australian troops, thousands of whom simply
deserted in the face of the enemy. The Aussies who fought so
magnificently in the Western Desert, where Rommel thought them the best
of the British infantry, did not do well in Malaya. This has been a
previously untold story, but Elphick documents it thoroughly, often from
recently released official documents.
The Aussies were not sufficently motivated, but were also, mostly,
poorly trained, something true of almost all the British Imperial units
involved. Purely British units did better (the Argyll and Sutherland
Highlanders especially so) but the quality of British leadership left a
lot to be desired especially at the very top.
The Japanese were immensely helped by espionage and treachery (one
officer of the Indian Army, Captain Patrick Heenan, supplied them with
vital data especially about the north Malayan airfields). They also
benefited from the way interestingly shows how the British military
authorities on the spot had a perfectly sound notion of the quality of
Japanese equipment, and only a little less of the capacities of their
soldiers.
If anyone is to blame for the debacle Elphick would nominate
Churchill, but his net is far more widely cast so that, of senior
figures, only Wavell's reputation is sustained.
This is not a professional historian's work (it is occasionally
repetitive) but it is both valuable and original, and very well worth
reading.

THE face, the enormous almond-shaped eyes, aquiline nose, chiselled
chin and neck, is legendary. The wide Italian hips flagrantly emphasise
a figure that has created millions of fantasies and made as many movie
dollars. Sophia Loren still projects a powerful sexual mystique.
She is a star survivor, a woman who has stared age in the face until
time blinked. She is positive and erudite, an hourglass of wisdom.
She is also the continental celebrity who has maintained an
international appeal over almost four decades. Bardot -- who celebrated
her sixtieth birthday last year along with Loren, whom she loathes as a
result of her rival's decision to accept a multi-million dollar contract
to advertise fur coats -- Claudia Cardinale, Monica Vitti, and Gina
Lollobrigida have, to be kind, faded.
Loren flourishes especially in Pret-a-Porter (aka Ready to Wear) which
is maverick director Robert (M*A*S*H) Altman's irreverent fun focus on
the fashion business. The movie, which opens?? this week, reunites Loren
with her longtime co-star Marcello Mastroianni. It is very much an
ensemble piece but many, including Meryl Streep, who called Loren's
performance ''a revelation'', believe ''the old lady'' steals the show.
The Italian icon is radiant.
She is the wife and mother caught rather than trapped in the body of a
sex symbol. Somehow all the wrong bits -- the large mouth, weak chin,
and those hips that got an alphabet of men from Cary Grant to Peter
Sellers into trouble -- add up to exotic arithmetic, one of life's more
magnificent accidents.
She and her husband, film producer Carlo Ponti, 81, have homes in
Switzerland, Florida, and the American West Coast. These days they spend
most of their time in a quiet, leafy, suburban corner of California on
the east side of Los Angeles. They have powerful connections, a
worldwide following, and enormous wealth but Loren's most beloved
treasures are her sons Edoardo, 22, and Carlo Junior, 26.
She is one of the century's most famous faces who laughs now that
ageing well is the best revenge and, yes, the lines are there as she
flashes her Beverly Hills teeth, and the face is softer around the
landmark cheekbones; but you'd have to be a nitpicking nincompoop not to
realise this is a stunning woman who just happens to be getting on a
bit.
She is as pragmatic as she is graceful about growing old: ''Age isn't
a privilege -- it's a condition. The difficult time for a woman isn't
reaching 60 or 70, but turning 30. Women are children until they are 30.
Only then do they become adults.
''I've never hidden my age from the world, because I don't care. We
can't hide time. I'm not frightened of it. I'm finding my second youth.
''Actually, I rather like birthdays. It is a good reason to talk to
yourself, to ask yourself what you have been doing, what you are doing,
and what you will do. Girls who can't go off and talk to themselves stay
girls, never become women. Women who can't take stock turn to drink,
pills or worse, but I can take stock. I can send for the bill of life
and add it up, too. If I ever feel depressed, I consider what I have
done and what I have accomplished -- starting from nothing and arriving
with so much happiness.
''It is not luck. I don't believe in luck. It is wanting that counts.
I have always wanted. That is the secret of me. Even as a child from a
poor family whose mother was not married to my father, I wanted and I
got. I did not want -- ever -- for others to get for me. I pay, not just
in money, but in suffering and pain and anxiety for what I have
achieved.''
Loren's mother, Romilda Villani, lived in Pozzuoli, near Naples, and
wanted to be a film star. She won a Greta Garbo lookalike contest at 17,
but Loren's grandmother stopped her taking the prize of a first-class
ticket to California and a Hollywood screen test. Loren's mother
rebelled and ran way to Rome, where she met Riccardo Scicolone. He was
the father Loren only met when she was five.''I always felt I had no
father. Even when you're young you get accustomed to the negative things
in life. You say to yourself: 'Maybe it has to be like this.' But, at
the same time, you don't consider yourself like other children; they
have a father and a mother. I don't talk like this about my father
because I have feelings of hatred. Hatred is something I don't know of.
Besides, I had a lot of love around me. My grandmother and my
grandfather loved my sister and me very much.''
Her sister Maria -- they are very, very close -- is four years younger
and she, too, was the illegitimate daughter of Scicolone. But it was
only years later when Loren was a star that her sister was given his
name. ''She suffered so much. She didn't want to go to school. We
supported each other.'' Her sons are also four years apart, and she
says: ''I always tell Edoardo, 'You should love your brother.' I say the
same thing to Carlo because I like it when brothers are really close to
each other. For, after all, what else do we have in life but family?
When you go out and leave home . . . God!''
The world found her quickly. Sofia Scicolone, as she was then,
suffered from mites and lice as a child. She was so thin other children
called her Sofia Stuzzicadente -- Sofia Toothpick. She blossomed and the
filled-out, 14-year-old Loren won, like her mother, a beauty contest
that sent her on her way to Rome. Her mother, always regretful about her
own missed opportunity, was a supportive and often pushy stage mother.
The young Loren won her first film role as an extra in Quo Vadis, the
spectacular Robert Taylor vehicle in 1951.
She appeared in a string of films including Era lui, si,si! -- an
Italian romp in which she went topless -- before moving on to almost 100
films, including her 1961 Best Actress Oscar performance in Two Women.
She is not precious about her early career, joking: ''I'm not ashamed of
my bare-bottom beginnings.'' She became a voluptuous sex symbol with Boy
on a Dolphin in 1957, but does not regret it.
''I liked it because I was doing it in a joking kind of way. And I
knew that it was a preparation for what I would do later on. It's
impossible to be a sex symbol all your life. You have to be terribly
young and then your career is very short, so at some point you have to
choose roles that you can go further with. That's what I did when I made
Two Women -- I was 25 and I played the mother of a 15-year-old girl. I
really established myself as an actress with that and then I had
wonderful roles.''
Her most spectacular, and often controversial, role has been in her
off-screen marriage to Ponti. They have been together more than 40
years. He is 21 years older, and there have always been stories of other
men. He was married when they met and, as Italy did not recognise
divorce, they were forced into a Mexican divorce and marriage by proxy
in 1957. They were branded as ''public sinners'' and threatened with
arrest for bigamy. Only when Ponti became a French citizen and secured a
French divorce in 1966 was their marriage officially pronounced legal.
The year they married, The Pride and the Passion, in which Loren
co-starred with Cary Grant and Frank Sinatra, was released. During
filming -- and before her marriage -- Loren had an affair with Cary
Grant. He was 52.
''When I met Cary I was 23. He had been my dream since I was little --
tall, handsome, charming, funny, gentle. Carlo and Cary had nothing in
common, but I loved them both.''
She turned down Grant's proposal of marriage because Ponti's divorce
came through and they were able to marry. If circumstances had been
different? ''Yes, I would have married Cary Grant.''
Of her other supposed high-profile romance with Peter Sellers, her
co-star in The Millionairess in 1961, she says: ''We were never lovers.
I have made pictures with Marcello Mastroianni, Clark Gable, William
Holden, Alan Ladd -- lots of fascinating men -- but they can't all be
lovers. It's gossip. Peter Sellers was a great personality and I adored
him. But lovers -- no.''
She is philosophical about what could be seen as public attempts to
wreck her marriage: the gossip columns, the sleazy stories. ''I don't
resent it. I don't even like to talk about it. It seems to me so natural
to be married and to stay married. I think if you find the right person
to be with, you have to stick to it even though sometimes you may have
moments of depression and unhappiness. But that all passes. What stays
is the affection you have. I think you have to try to swallow sometimes
the bitter things.
''Most of the time I don't forget, but I forgive. I am quite a
fatalist. I am Neapolitan, and I look at life with a kind of optimistic
eye.''
Her sons are living evidence of her optimism. She had two miscarriages
before doctors said she would never have children. ''I was convinced
that it was not true, because I believe if I really put my energies into
something it happens. When I became pregnant, I spent the whole nine
months -- both times -- in bed. Maybe that's my strength, I really go
all the way. The lowest point in my life was when I lost my two unborn
children. I didn't want that again.
''As a mother, I feel very vulnerable. We live in a dangerous world,
but I try to keep my fears to myself. I never show them to the children;
that's not the right attitude. I think you have to give your children
confidence in life, in people, society and in the world today.''
But does she feel vulnerable about her age?
''No, absolutely not. Ageing is very relative. I try to keep myself in
shape as much as I can, but getting older is wonderful. You mature.
''You experience so many things. Joy. Sorrow sometimes. But I've had a
wonderful life. My life has been almost completely fulfilled. I have a
wonderful life. And I will have a wonderful life. My life has been
almost completely fulfilled. I said 'almost' but I have no regrets.I'm
proud of what I've done with myself. And I'm very proud of my children.
''There's no question that I took from my mother a kind of strength
and dignity in looking at life. Now everything sounds very easy -- like
I've done everything with a magic stick. But there were lots of
sacrifices and risks that we went through. I never thought, and she
never thought, that I was going to be as successful. I don't know if I
deserve what I have -- it's much more than I ever expected.
''I was born old. I've been in films since I was 15 -- always a woman,
never a girl. When I was 30, the world Press descended on me to ask how
it felt to be middle-aged. I felt like a national institution beginning
to crumble at the edges. When I was 30 they said it was a critical age
for women, and then at 40, and at 50, and now at 60. What counts for me
in life are the relationships I have with my family which you build at
20 or 30 or 40 or 50 or 60.
''A woman's life can be frightening sometimes. At 30, a woman wakes up
and she is no longer a girl and there are things to do in the world.
Often, if she has no children, she is frightened that maybe she'll never
have them. For me, I started work at 15 and have enjoyed all my ages. My
first Oscar was at 26 and I was a success by the important age of 30.
''I did worry about having no children, but they came along. I think the
best thing for an older woman is to have young children. If we're happy,
if we think nice, happy things inside, it radiates out and makes anyone
beautiful.''
Loren, bronzed with those hazel-flecked eyes flashing, knows that it
takes care to beat the clock. She likes to laugh about it: ''Everything
you see I owe to spaghetti.'' Or: ''Sex appeal is 50% of what you've got
and 50% of what people think you've got.''
Some would be happy with 25%.
But she says: ''I look okay -- just okay. My nose is too long, my chin
too short, my hips too broad. But together all these irregularities seem
to work.
''I don't mind ageing. Everybody gets older -- if they are lucky. I
have nothing against plastic surgery if a woman is obsessed with the way
she looks. But I like to stick with my dear old face. I don't mind
getting older. Everyone has to. I'm young inside, so getting old doesn't
make a difference to me. The best thing I've ever done for my looks was
to quit smoking.
''I have a routine for my looks. Soap and water morning and night,
baby cream all over, sunscreen when I go out. I swim as much as I can
and exercise every day at home. When I'm working, all my free time must
go towards rest.
''The important thing is to keep your femininity, maintain your health
and your vitality. Of course, one wants to grow old gracefully. I like
to take care of myself, but I'm not afraid of getting wrinkles. I like
to use baby oil for cleansing my skin and baby shampoo to wash my hair,
purely because they don't contain any harsh ingredients.
''I try to eat healthy food, but my philosophy is to eat a little of
everything and listen to the body's needs. Fresh air is good for your
skin, so is sleep. I try to get nine hours a night.
0
'' I had dreaded my fiftieth birthday for a long time. When it finally
came, I realised something: every age has its satisfactions. I had
achieved a certain balance, a certain harmony in my life, a summing-up.
I'd been down a long road and had become reflective about my personal
and professional lives. It was like a red light at which I stopped and
looked back. I'd come through it all and I was proud.
''I still am.''

A TENNIS tournament washed out by rain gave rise to an afternoon
drinking session for a group of international coaches, an industrial
tribunal heard yesterday.
Some of them, including Mr Fraser Auld, were still drinking at 3am.
Mr Auld, 31, from Troon, Ayrshire, has made a claim of unfair
dismissal against the English Lawn Tennis Association. It says it sacked
him because of his behaviour at a hotel in Leuwarden, Holland, last July
4.
Mr David Drysdale, head of the Australian youth team, travelled from
Australia to give evidence at the tribunal in Reading, Berkshire.
He said the coaches had been drinking together on the night in
question before the Scot ''lost it'' after they had headed back to their
rooms with more drink.
Mr Auld had jokingly picked up a fire extinguisher as they went to
their rooms but put it down again. ''It was then that he started banging
on Beverley's door.'' This was reference to the female US team coach,
Miss Beverley Bowse. Mr Auld had attracted attention by repeatedly
trying to engage her in conversation earlier in the day.
Mr Drysdale went on: ''He then grabbed the fire extinguisher and let
it off in the corridor. The powder came out very quickly. I went back in
my room as I wanted no part of it.
''I tried to get him back into the room before he did anything too
stupid. He went out into the corridor again and that was when he 'lost
it'.
''I told him in no uncertain terms to go to bed. He just would not
listen to reason. He would not listen to the fact he should not do it.''
Miss Sarah Kellaway, the LTA's personnel manager, defended its
disciplinary procedures when questioned by Mr Auld's barrister, Miss Jo
Heal.
Miss Heal asked her why part of the handwritten notes of Mr Auld's
disciplinary meetings had been removed. Miss Kellaway said it was done
only to make the papers clearer.
Miss Heal outlined problems with the lack of detail and times about
the LTA charges and pointed out that Mr Auld had not been invited to
have a colleague with him at the disciplinary meeting.
Miss Heal said: ''He did not have much of a chance to put up his own
defence, did he?'' Miss Kellaway agreed, but she denied that senior
officials had already made up their minds about sacking Mr Auld.
The tribunal was adjourned until July 10.

LOOKING at the moulded-candle creations of Ken Parsons is more like
looking at glowing works of art than mere sticks of wax. The
multicoloured creations resemble millifiori Venetian glass and are made
in the same way as seaside rock.
His company, Spectra Wax based in Peebles, has been making candles for
20 years, but has not always waxed so artistic.
He has become increasingly confident with his material over the years.
'It's malleable,'' he says, ''and you can mould it into any shape, and
colour it in any way you want. It's like a canvas, basically, and you
can do what you want with it in three dimensions.''
It was while trying out different techniques that he came up with his
stained-glass effect. ''We started dipping tapers and discovered that,
if you dipped a knitting needle in wax, it will build up like a taper.
You can slip the wax off the knitting needle and you are left with a
round tube. You cut them into little circles and put them into a
mould.''
The candles he makes today are far from the ones he started making
with his brother 20 years ago. ''My brother was a dentist and used wax
for making impressions of false teeth. There were power cuts in the late
sixties and early seventies and people were frantically importing
candles from abroad . . . so we thought we would start making our own
candles and sell them.
''I was in the kitchen melting wax in pans and the people I was
sharing the flat with would be making fry-ups in them. They didn't seem
to mind.''
Ken's obvious pleasure in his present job comes after a long line of
other work. He was a deckchair attendant on Brighton beach, a computer
operator and he cleaned railway carriages. Now he intends to do more
than produce candles. The latest creations are Tiffany-style wax lamps
retailing at around the #100 mark.
The lamps are selling well, although not every product Ken has made
has been so successful. At one point he tried to break into the tartan
candle market. ''There are easier ways to earn a living than making
tartan candles,'' he says with a smile.

Haven't we seen you somewhere before? Otherwise-trendy
Glasgow stays traditional when it comes to laying out the
tea table, an experienced retailer tells WENDY JACK
'While people are
open-minded and
will admire
something which
is in modern terms
very different,
frequently they
won't buy it'
DESPITE its fashion-conscious image, Glasgow goes it alone when it
comes to buying china. It eschews the new and trendy in favour of
traditional-style bone china.
The preference tends to be for metal-edged -- gold or platinum --
''English'' designs, with tall, narrow, footed cup shapes retaining
greatest appeal. Notwithstanding the dictats of America and Europe which
lead the way, Glasgow makes up its own mind, china . . .
The newer, trendier shapes and patterns may be admired, says David
Goldinger, director of Glasgow's Stockwell China Bazaar -- founded by
his father in 1924, and where his son, Lewis, is managing director.
''But while people are open-minded and will admire something which is in
modern terms very different, frequently they won't buy it.
''In spite of changing trends in the industry in general, in Scotland
these are only marginal.''
This means, for example, that two designs from Thomas, Thin Silver and
Broad Gold, which were deemed ''modern'' about 25 years ago, still sell
strongly in Glasgow, despite the rest of the world having moved on.
Maybe that's true style, refusing to toe a particular line.
Currently capturing the mood for more informal lifestyles, is the very
popular stoneware, quite different to bone china, both in terms of
material and decoration. Rarely, if ever, does stoneware have that
favoured metal edge, while cups are restricted to rounder, heavier
shapes than its more refined relation.
David Goldinger points to Blue Magic, casual tableware from Thailand
which has been, he says, ''absolutely tremendous in its appeal. It's
very price-driven. A dinner plate is only #4.20, so it's great value.
''There are two elements here: a pattern which doesn't really look
casual, it's fairly mainstream; and a price which is so affordable it's
like an old-fashioned earthenware.''
Casual Dining is the name given to everyday tableware as opposed to
the special-occasion set. This has given rise to some interesting new
patterns, especially mix-and-match, which is big news.
While this may look new and exciting to the occasional buyer, to those
in the industry its concept rings bells from the past. ''The wheel is
being constantly re-invented,'' smiles Mr Goldinger.
There are memories of Royal Doulton's Hot Pots of 20 or so years ago,
a serious attempt to provide an affordable mix-and-match range. ''While
it took off well, it didn't last more than four or five years,'' recalls
Mr Goldinger. ''Whether it was the fashion element again, I don't know,
but it went from being flavour of the month to insignificance.''
Similarly, flash back 30 to 40 years, and the Stockwell China Bazaar
was selling Harlequin designs, tea-sets for six comprising cup, saucer
and plate of six different colours. David Goldinger remembers it being
''tremendously popular'' at the time.
He adds: ''Tea-sets were perhaps thought of as being for display
cabinets, rather than using. I suppose that might have been the ancestor
of today's mix-and-match.''
With contemporary mix-and-match, you might find contrasting bands of
colour on various pieces, perhaps interspersed with a floral pattern on
others, self-colour somewhere else, and maybe a totally different
pattern on an ''accent'' plate of eight-inch diameter, to the main
dinner and side-plates.
A typical example, is Villeroy and Boch's Switch, launched last year,
and apparently very popular the further south one goes in the UK. With a
dinner plate costing under #10, the Goldingers would have expected
considerable demand for what is a very attractive design. ''The message
is that the price isn't the barrier, it's simply not in the mainstream
taste up here,'' says David Goldinger.
On the other hand, a beautiful new-last-year Royal Copenhagen design,
Fairytale, which has a mix-and-match influence but traditional looks,
has taken off very strongly north of the Border, despite a dinner plate
costing nearly #30. The look and shape appeals, so people vote with
their wallets.
Brides, of course, have been traditionally important customers when it
comes to buying tableware. Once they came along with Mother to do their
choosing -- now it's more likely to be the 'groom who's in tow,
reflecting more egalitarian times.
Typically, they'll seek broad or narrow bands, some metal accents, and
some relatively restrained colour, whether it's in the form of fine
floral design, speckled bands, or whatever.
In summary, Mr Goldinger believes that while formal, beautiful
tableware is not a thing of the past, demarcation lines have become
smudged, with expensive, informal styles slowly but surely making
inroads into the picture.

THE problems faced by lawyers who try to run one-man businesses were
highlighted yesterday in the annual report of the Scottish Solicitors'
Discipline Tribunal.
Nearly 70% of the cases reported to the tribunal over the past year
involved lawyers practising on their own.
In the report, published yesterday, the tribunal said a recurring
feature of many of the complaints that came before it was the inability
of sole practitioners to conduct and manage a profitable business.
The report shows that the tribunal dealt with 19 complaints in the
year up to October 31, 1994. In the most serious cases, five solicitors
were struck off and five were suspended from practice.
Fines totalling #20,500 were imposed in four cases and the most common
complaint against lawyers was their failure to comply with the
solicitors' accounts rules.
Solicitors practising on their own accounted for 69% of the cases
reported to the tribunal -- an independent disciplinary body -- by the
solicitors' governing body, the Law Society of Scotland.
The tribunal says that, in some cases, the inability of many sole
practitioners to conduct and manage a profitable business led to a
failure to attend diligently to their clients' affairs.
''In one such case where, over a lengthy period, a solicitor had
neglected to wind up several trust and executry estates, a defence was
put forward on the basis that it was the solicitor's duty to prioritise
his workload having regard to the resources available to him.
''This excuse was not accepted. The basic principle must be that a
solicitor should accept instructions only where he has the capacity to
conduct the particular work with reasonable diligence.
''A solicitor's workload is not an acceptable excuse for excessive
delay in attending to the affairs of his clients.''
In the case in question, the lawyer had taken no steps to cover the
situation where the retirement of his senior partner coincided with the
extended illness of his junior partner.
The tribunal adds: ''It was significant that in a number of such cases
the particular solicitors had lost the services of an experienced
cashier and were unable to secure the services of another or to manage
their firm's books personally.''
The tribunal now also has the power to discipline solicitors who
provide inadequate professional services.
The report states: ''In one complaint, where it was established that
there had been inadequate professional services, the tribunal determined
that the solicitor was not entitled to any fee for the services to each
client. In another complaint, the fees were restricted by 50%.''

A CONVICTED Loyalist terrorist was jailed for life yesterday for
raping and sexually assaulting six girls and a boy over a period of 25
years.
George Collingwood, 62, of St Peter's Path, Easterhouse, Glasgow,
appeared in the same dock in the city's High Court where he was jailed
for seven years in 1974 for possessing explosives during a major Ulster
Defence Association trial.
The court heard that Collingwood's sexual offences came to light last
November when one victim went to the police.
Some of his victims, now adults, sat in the back of the court as
Collingwood admitted six rapes, four charges of lewd and libidinous
practices, two charges of shameless indecency, and one of sodomy.
The children involved ranged in age from seven to 14 at the time of
the offences. The court was told that Collingwood would spike drinks
with drugs before abusing the children. He also photographed his victims
in obscene poses. Some of the victims were subjected to repeated attacks
over a period of a year.
Mr Steven MacGibbon, prosecuting, accepted Collingwood's pleas of not
guilty to 16 other charges, some of them involving another six young
girls.
Mr MacGibbon said that, in nearly all the cases, Collingwood's method
was to get friendly with the parents of his victims.
One young victim recalled being given two glasses of wine with a
sediment in the glass and waking up in a strange bed with a hangover,
realising intercourse had taken place.
Another girl, then 13, was undressed and raped. When she began crying,
Collingwood told her to shut up. Mr MacGibbon said Collingwood had sex
with the girl five or six times, restraining her by brute force.
He told her not to tell anyone and warned that he had friends in high
places, including the police and the UDA.
Two of the girls had children by him. One of the two and another of
his victims later attempted to kill themselves because of the abuse they
had suffered.
Mr MacGibbon said that, in many of the cases, intercourse was achieved
by force and fear, and thereafter victims complied through shame about
the initial attack. Collingwood also used a ''reward system'' to induce
the children to have sex with him.
Defense counsel, Mr Hugh Matthews, QC, said: ''This man seemed to have
an influence over these children which is difficult to grasp. He became
something of a magnet for them.''
Mr Matthews also told the court that Collingwood had taken an overdose
in the same month as his arrest. He asked thejudge, Lord Allanbridge, to
be as lenient as possible in view of his client's age and the trouble he
would face in prison as a sex offender.
Lord Allanbridge sentenced Collingwood to life imprisonment for his
''shocking'' offences. The judge added: ''It is quite clear that the
public require protection from your activities.''

<HEADLINE>Superquarry company would buy houses if noise proved too much</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE developers of the proposed coastal superquarry at Lingerbay, in
Harris, have offered to buy the six croft houses in the area and provide
new land at nearby Rodel.
They would also double-glaze any houses if the owners preferred to
remain there, the 60th day of the inquiry at Stornoway heard yesterday.
Dr Angus Walker, an acoustics expert, said Redland Aggregate had made
the offer to buy the houses if noise levels proved unacceptable within
the first five years.
He said it would not be possible to guarantee the recommended noise
levels at all times at Lingerbay but the overall impact was not out of
proportion to the benefits of the development and there was ''not an
overriding reason for the application to be refused on grounds of
noise''.
Dr Walker said noise surveys at Lingerbay had shown the area to be
quieter than average for rural areas, with wind and waves controlling
the background noise level.
It would not be possible to achieve an ideal noise level at all houses
there. However, a good standard as recognised by the World Health
Organisation and which met the limit proposed in the Department of the
Environment Mineral Planning Guidance Note could be attained.
''Redland have expressed willingness throughout to do everything
practicable to meet the best standard at all properties but recognise
that some dwellings cannot be guaranteed to achieve it at all times.''
Dr Walker said there were six occupied croft houses in the Lingerbay
area, of which the nearest to the quarry, No 15, had been offered
already to Redland.
He told the chief inquiry Reporter, Miss Gillian Pain, that most of
the plant proposed for Lingerbay would be very similar to that in use
already at the Mountsorrel quarry, operated by Redland, and which the
Reporter visited in January.
The dump trucks climbed out of the quarry at Mountsorrel, whereas at
Lingerbay they would be descending while laden. This benefit had been
ignored.
He said the detailed modelling of the site had been the subject of
excellent co-operation between himself and consultants acting for
Scottish Natural Heritage -- the principal objectors -- and the Western
Isles Council, and it was understood that the model and its calculated
outputs were agreed between the parties.
Dr Walker explained: ''The noise generated by the surge pile at
Mountsorrel will be reduced at Lingerbay by the use of a luffing
conveyer to markedly reduce the height of fall for the stone.
''The same noise level has been assumed for the ship-loading
operation, with a similar degree of mitigation allowed for the reduced
fall into the hold and for screening measures which can be introduced.''
The inquiry -- into the proposals by Redland to extract 600m tonnes of
anorthosite over a 60-year period from Lingerbay -- resumes on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE>Cruelty Bill vote brings fox-hunting ban closer</HEADLINE>

A BAN on fox and stag hunting and hare coursing came closer yesterday
as MPs voted 253 to 0 for a Bill sponsored by Dumbarton MP John McFall
to make cruelty to wild mammals illegal.
Later, Mr McFall, who called it ''a landmark vote'', wrote to the
Prime Minister asking for the Government to make time available for the
Bill to complete its remaining Parliamentary stages.
This will be refused but the opponents of hunting believe there is
such a head of steam against cruel sports in the country as well as the
Commons that its days are numbered.
Only three years ago, a similar bid was defeated, though only by 12
votes, with 180 Tories, including 14 Cabinet Ministers, voting against
it. This time, the opponents decided not to force a vote and no Cabinet
Ministers turned up.
Home Office Minister Nicholas Baker said the Government was neutral on
matters affecting field sports but would oppose the Bill's licensing
provisions if it reached committee and also had reservations about
aspects dealing with the control of pests and their effect on farmers
and rural communities generally.
Mr Elliot Morley, the official Opposition spokesman, said Mr Tony
Blair had promised that a Labour Government would allow MPs a free vote
on the abolition of fox and deer hunting and would introduce the
necessary legislation if it was approved.
Opponents claimed Mr McFall was being used by an animal rights lobby
with a wider agenda which would seek to go on to outlaw shooting and
fishing, neither of which is affected by the Bill.
Because of the limited time available to discuss Bills introduced by
individual MPs, Mr McFall's Bill, which started off seventh in the
queue, is unlikely to get into a committee for detailed discussion
without special help from the Government.
Earlier this week, the Prime Minister confirmed the Bill did not have
the Government's backing, saying: ''This has traditionally been the
responsibility of individual members and their individual consciences.''
Neither he nor Mr Blair voted. Mr Major was conducting a policy
discussion with middle ranking Ministers at Chequers.
Mr McFall said the vote ''signals the end of hunting and other deeply
cruel activities''. He pointed to the support he had received in the
vote from Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Nationalist, and Unionist MPs.
The SNP Parliamentary leader, Mrs Margaret Ewing (Moray), is a sponsor
of the Bill as is Labour MP Helen Liddell (Monklands East).
Mr McFall said the Prime Minister should take account of the
widespread feeling against cruelty to animals throughout the country
shown by the million signatures to the petition in favour of his Bill
already delivered to Downing Street. Since sponsoring the Bill, he had
received 5000 letters.
As well as banning hunting and coursing, the Bill would make it an
offence to ''cruelly beat, kick, or torture a wild mammal''. Snaring
would be banned except by licence.
Breaking the law would mean fines of up to #5000 for each animal
harmed plus a possible six months in jail. Dog owners could have their
animals confiscated if convicted of using them to hunt.
Although opponents announced they would not force a vote on the second
reading, Mr McFall did so, determined to show the strength of his
support.
Mr McFall said the Bill would end the ''illogical and ridiculous
anomaly'' in the law which made it a criminal offence to inflict cruelty
on domestic mammals but not generally on wild mammals. He said the
country was ''crying out for wild animals to be treated with respect and
compassion''.
The supporters were 210 Labour MPs, 27 Conservatives, 11 Liberal
Democrats, two Scottish Nationalists, two Democratic Unionists, and the
Popular Unionist, plus four Labour MPs who acted as tellers.

FOX hunting supporters yesterday expressed their anger over Labour MP
John McFall's attempt to kill off their sport.
Mr Jack McConnell, Labour's Scottish general secretary, took the brunt
of the fury as he clashed verbally with a hunt and country sports
supporter on the steps of the party's Glasgow headquarters.
The shouting match erupted as opponents of the Bill, including a
huntsman in full regalia with hounds, presented Mr McConnell with a
16,000 signature petition condemning what they called the ''misinformed
and counterproductive'' Bill.
As Mr McConnell was accepting the petition, author and gun dog
training expert Mr James Douglas warned him that Labour was in danger of
losing votes over the issue.
He said he thought Mr McFall had gleaned his knowledge of the issue
''from the Beano and the Dandy'' and that Labour would alienate a cross
section of their voters if the Bill went through.
Mr McConnell, describing the attack on Mr McFall's knowledge as
''offensive'', warned he would ''not be harangued on the steps of an
office'' and said the Bill, noted for its protection of wild animals
from cruelty, had cross- party support.
Objectors, in what was an otherwise good-natured meeting, included
representatives from the British Association for Shooting and
Conservation and the British Field Sports Society who are among a number
of organisations which have joined forces in the Countryside United
campaign to fight the Bill.
The petition was presented by Mr Douglas Ross, spokesman for the field
sports society. He said the society supported only clause one of the
Bill which aims to outlaw the torture of wild animals. ''If clause two
and three were let in, it would cause total devastation to the Scottish
economy.''
Mr Ross also said that to describe the way foxes met their end as
cruel was ''absolute rubbish''. He said: ''The fox either escapes
cleanly or he is killed quickly by the first hound that comes upon him
by a single bite to the back of the neck.''
0 Mr Ross said fox hunting provided a service to farmers by keeping
the number of foxes down. ''The fox has no natural predator and in
lambing time foxes will take lambs.''
Mr Ross added that 8000 people a year went fox hunting in Scotland and
there were 10 packs of hounds. He said 150 people were employed by the
sport.
The protesters said there were a number of knock-on effects should Mr
McFall's Bill become law. Mr Jamie Hepburn-Wright, Scottish director for
the British Field Sports Society, said: ''The Bill would ban hunting in
Scotland, threaten shooting interest, and open the doors to an attack on
angling.
''The strength of this petition shows that country sports' supporters
are simply not prepared to be attacked in this way. Country sports are
the second most popular rural pursuit in Scotland after hill walking.
They contribute some #200m to the Scottish economy every year.''

SIR Nicholas Fairbairn, Queen's Counsel and Member of Parliament,
would have liked it but there is no doubt that Nicky Fairbairn would
have found something outrageous to say about the great and the not so
great, and the good and not so good who gathered in and around St John's
Kirk, Perth, yesterday to celebrate the life of the man of many parts
and contradictions.
They came from all walks. Among them were Baroness Thatcher, who once
dubbed Sir Nicholas her party's ''best captain'', the Lord Chancellor,
Lord Mackay of Clashfern, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, and Scottish
Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.
Also there were political opponents, including Shadow Social Security
Secretary Donald Dewar and Liberal-Democrat Defence spokesman Menzies
Campbell, Scottish judges, other MPs, members of the Faculty of
Advocates, and defence solicitor Joe Beltrami, his partner in many a
High Court case.
The man with the uphill task of attempting to retain the Perth and
Kinross seat for the Conservatives, Mr John Godfrey, also attended.
Nearly 1000 mourners, many standing outside, joined the MP's first and
second wives, Elizabeth and Lady Samantha, and three daughters for the
memorial service.
Sir Nicholas's brother, Cosmo, read a lesson and Lady Thatcher read an
excerpt from The Prophet by Lebanese poet and philosopher Kahlil Gibran,
one of the late MP's favourite authors.
The MP also would have appreciated a personal memoir from Mr Martin
Robb, who described himself as ''last in a long line of battered and
bruised constituency chairmen'' who had worked alongside Sir Nicholas
the politician.
He said there was ''no drudgery about Nicky's life'', which he had
lived to the full, and recalled how Sir Nicholas had told him: ''I've
had a helluva good time on Earth. It has been Heaven. I'm not looking
forward to swopping the castle (his home, Fordell) for a mansion in the
sky.''
Referring to the avalanche of media inquiries which often followed
some of Sir Nicholas's public comments, Mr Robb said campaigning with
him ''ranged from nightmare to magnificence''.
''Whether you were a businessman in Comrie, a shopkeeper in Perth, a
farmer in Crieff, a dress designer in Auchterarder, Nicky would always
give full measure to whatever the concerns that poured in.''
Mr Lang also paid tribute to the ''advocate, MP, painter, author,
poet, QC, fashion designer, Minister of the Crown, landscape gardener,
conservationist, and, of course, bon viveur and wit''.
The Rev David Ogston said: ''Caution and conformity make cowards of us
all. Nicky chose to march to the beat of the drum.''
Hymns included the Battle Hymn of the Republic and piper Corporal
Michael Gray of The Highlanders played Cock of the North and the lament
Lochaber No More.
Outside, as the congregation swopped tales about their friend and
colleague, one said: ''Sir Nicholas would have liked that.''
So, too, would Nicky.

* The Scottish Labour Party yesterday published its short leet of
nominees for the Perth and Kinross by-election, a few hours after the
memorial service.
Local constituency party members will meet on Monday to choose their
candidate from Mr Douglas Alexander, 27, a trainee solicitor in
Edinburgh, who until 1994 was a researcher for Shadow Chancellor Gordon
Brown, and Ms Susan Deacon, 31, from Musselburgh, director of Master
Business Administration Programmes at Heriot-Watt University, and a
former member of the Scottish Labour Party executive.

A JOINER who suffered a badly broken leg and fractured arm after he
fell from scaffolding at the BP Chemicals plant, Grangemouth, has been
awarded damages of #117,000.
At one stage, surgeons thought they might have to amputate Mr William
Cavanagh's leg.
He sued BP Chemicals, Lilley Construction (Scotland), and Deborah
Grayston (Scaffolding) for a total of #200,000.
Mr Cavanagh, of Millrig, Whitehills, East Kilbride, was a
self-employed shuttering joiner. He was working at the site in December
1990 and had climbed a 30ft ladder to a platform on the scaffolding and
was taking down shuttering from concrete columns in heavy rain when he
fell.
In a written judgment at the Court of Session, Lord Clyde said the
platform was wet and there was nothing on to which Mr Cavanagh could
hold. He described Mr Cavanagh as a credible witness who had understated
the extent of his injuries.
He had undergone a series of operations on his leg and was on crutches
until last spring. He suffered bouts of depression after the failure of
a number of operations.
Lord Clyde ruled that all three defenders were liable, to some extent.
He decided that BP should pay one fifth of the damages and Lilley and
Grayston two fifths each.

THE Lord Justice Clerk has been over-ruled in his own court by two of
his ''junior'' colleagues in a driving case which hinged on the
significance of a warm engine.
Lord Ross ruled that Daniel Henderson, 22, should have been acquitted
of driving while banned and without insurance, but Lords McCluskey and
Morison confirmed the conviction.
Henderson was convicted at Dunfermline Sheriff Court. He was fined a
total of #490, banned for six years, and ordered to resit his driving
test.
He took his case to the Justiciary Appeal Court, where the judges were
told that, at about 11.45pm, two police constables had approached a
stationary van in Maxwell Street, Cowdenbeath, Fife.
They noticed Henderson, of Barclay Street, Cowdenbeath in the driver's
seat but lying across the passenger seat. He sat up with a start and the
police found the ignition keys on the floor under the passenger seat.
Henderson was taken to the police station, and when the constables
returned to the locked van about 15 minutes later they found that the
engine was warm. It had not been moved and there was no-one else around.
Lord Ross took the view that before Henderson could be said to be
driving, it had to be shown the van had been in motion and that
Henderson had been controlling its movement and direction.
The sheriff had been entitled to infer from the warmth of the engine
it had been recently running but the engine could have been running
without the van having been moved.
''The evidence relied on by the sheriff is consistent with Henderson
having attempted to drive and started the engine and subsequently turned
the engine off. It is consistent with the engine having been running
without the car having been moved at all.''
The circumstances might lead one to suspect that Henderson had been
driving before the police arrived but there was not enough evidence to
justify the sheriff in drawing that conclusion as a fact. There had been
no case for Henderson to answer, and he should have been acquitted.
Lord McCluskey disagreed. He said the most obvious explanation for a
vehicle in working order being on a public road just before midnight
with a warm engine and a driver in the driving seat was that it had been
driven there.
''It appears to me to be a justifiable inference from the
circumstances that the van was driven to the spot where it was found,''
said Lord McCluskey.
''Having concluded that the vehicle had been driven to the spot at
about the material time, the sheriff was surely entitled to hold that,
in the absence of any trace of any other person connected with the van,
the person who was in the driver's seat when the police found the
vehicle with the engine still warm, was the person who had driven it.''
Lord Morison agreed with Lord McCluskey.

THE European Commission of Human Rights has ruled unanimously that a
disgraced Scottish Tory councillor who was convicted of corruption and
jailed for a year suffered a violation of his human rights during his
trial.
Robert Pullar, 45, who was convicted at Perth Sheriff Court in July
1992, has now been given leave to take his case to the European Court.
The Commission made its ruling after hearing that one of the jurors in
the case was employed by the principal Crown witness and knew another of
the witnesses.
Mr Pullar, a former Tayside regional councillor, was convicted along
with the council's roads and transport convener, Raymond Mennie, of
seeking a bribe to secure approval for a service station on the Perth to
Dundee road at Inchture.
During their trial, an architect and a quantity surveyor maintained
that the men had corruptly solicited money to favour planning
permission.
Both men appealed to the Court of Appeal in February 1993 but their
claims of a miscarriage of justice were denied.
Mr Mennie, a Labour councillor, was also jailed for a year. Both men
continued to protest their innocence from prison.
Mr Mennie is also taking his case to Europe. Last night, his
solicitor, Mr Ronnie Tough, said: ''We want to have Mr Mennie's case
considered in tandem with that of Mr Pullar. It has been our position
all along that an injustice was committed and that it must be
remedied.''
Mr Pullar, of Church Lane, Methven, Perthshire, lost his job with BT
and had his political career as a councillor brought to an end.
Mr Robert Carr, solicitor advocate for Mr Pullar, said: ''We are
delighted. Mr Pullar was devastated when we lost the appeal. He has
suffered ill health and considerable loss. None of that can ever be
properly reversed.
''The jury which convicted my client included an employee of the
principal Crown witness who also knew another Crown witness.
''The situation had been reported to the court administration staff
during the trial but was only brought to the attention of the sheriff
and Mr Pullar after he was convicted.
''The jury's assessment of the credibility of these witnesses was
absolutely critical to the conviction. The juror depended at that time
on his employer for his livelihood and would be influenced inevitably by
his personal knowledge of his employer.''
Mr Carr added: ''I very much hope that the European Court, who will
consider the case in the autumn, will follow the Commission and hold
that Mr Pullar was denied a fair and impartial hearing.
''I understand that this is the first case of impartiality of this
kind to be considered by the European Court. This case and a number of
other recent cases highlight the need for further consideration of our
Scottish jury system.''

NEW powers to reduce the risk of exposure to asbestos were called for
yesterday, after experts predicted that deaths from mesothelioma, an
incurable cancer caused by the substance, were set to soar to 3000 a
year for the next 25 years.
The headquarters of Clydeside Action on Asbestos were flooded with
inquiries after health experts reported that the cancer, already found
among Clyde shipbuilders and asbestos factory workers, would also affect
painters, plumbers, gas-fitters, carpenters, electricians, and vehicle
builders.
Mr Ian McKechnie, of Clydeside Action, said: ''The powers of the
Health and Safety Executive are insufficient and we want to see them
strengthened so that they regulate all aspects of asbestos . . . They
should be given power to bring criminal prosecutions.''
He also called for a ban on the use of asbestos and more resources to
help treat its victims.
Because of the disease's long latency period, the fate of thousands of
workers is already sealed even though their symptoms may not develop for
years to come. Since much of the asbestos they helped to instal is still
in place, the threat remains for a fresh wave of disease among
renovation, maintenance, and demolition workers.
The receiving hospitals for the Clydebank area, Western Infirmary and
Gartnavel hospital group, have already seen a steady increase in the
number of people coming in with asbestos-related disease. There are 20
to 30 cases of mesothelioma a year and many more cases of lung-cancer
associated with asbestos.
Dr Kanti Patel, group consultant physician in respiratory medicine,
said: ''Life expectancy is about a year from the time of diagnosis. The
prognosis for lung cancer is also poor. Less than 10% are operable. For
mesothelioma, nothing at all has been successful so far.''
His patients first appear with breathlessness and chest wall pain due
to the fluid which gathers on the lung. Mesothelioma is often first
suspected when patients say they have worked with asbestos.
''There have also been a couple of cases where wives or daughters were
victims of secondary exposure because they had been cleaning their
husband's or father's overalls. They got no compensation because it
wasn't classed as industrial exposure,'' said Dr Patel.
As predictions of the death toll are revised upwards, the fight to get
fair compensation for the victims of asbestos goes on. The Clydeside
campaign has targeted the law which ensured a claimant's claim died with
him, and is fighting the Compensation Recovery Unit which has clawed
back #3m from invalidity benefit from compensation settlements on behalf
of the DSS.

Dropping her dinner
plates was a blessing
in disguise -- for
her, and for hopeful
customers whose
broken sets she now
helps to restore, says
PENNY SMYTHE
JEANNE HACKETT was feeling pleased. She had managed to build her Royal
Doulton dinner service, piece by piece to completion, after getting
notification that it would be going out of production.
Now she was looking forward to the dinner party she had arranged
earlier.
But calamity struck. As the guests were coming through the door of her
Perthshire home, she dropped some of the precious dinner plates.
''I struggled through the evening with a smile on my face, despite
knowing the plates were irreplacable,'' she recalls.
What she did not know then was that the minor catastrophe would lead
her eventually to a new career in a small but fascinating business.
At that time, recalls Jeanne, ''an acquaintance in England was selling
good china seconds which she bought in Stoke on Trent, at fairs, markets
and so on. A friend here and myself started to do that in a very small
way, until she dropped out because she was having a second baby.
''I continued. I was being asked regularly by people like WRI and
church groups where they could get a replacement for this or that, and I
was giving them English addresses for people who ran china registers to
match up missing pieces. They kept asking why I didn't start one -- and
when I dropped my plates the two things came together.
''At the time,'' she laughs mockingly, ''I was a nice, sensible
academic lecturing in sociology.''
China Galore, located at her home near Blairgowrie, has been operating
for some five years now. ''People contact me by phone. Often the shops
have given them my name and number. If I've got the china they're
looking for in stock, they get it straight away. If not, they can
register with me for a small fee of #6 and I try to find the piece they
need,'' explains Ms Hackett. ''Then it's a case of sitting back and
waiting -- sometimes it can take years.''
Tracking down the myriad requests is done in several ways. ''I do it
through people who want to sell pieces, perhaps because they've broken
so much of a set that it would be almost impossible to replace, or
sometimes when people go to live abroad they take just one set and want
to get rid of another; and people inherit china which they don't have
space to store in modern houses.
''It's no good keeping boxes of china under the bed. It's bad for it
because it will crack. Far better to sell it and let someone else use
it.
''I also go round auctions and antique shops in search of pieces.''
When she purchases from individuals Jeanne either buys on spec all the
pieces she is being offered, taking the risk that she may be left with
them, or she registers what the seller has and buys it piece by piece.
''Obviously they get a higher price that way, but they may be left
with three cups, four saucers and two dinner plates,'' she explains.
Her most regular requests are for Wedgwood and Royal Doulton patterns.
''I think more people have them. Then, of course, there's always the
darling Royal Albert. Off the top of my head I know I could use about
two-dozen of their Breamar cups. Obviously lots of people love it -- in
fact, I could get rid of nearly two full tea-sets.''
Although most of the china being sought is reasonably modern, some do
seek old or antique pieces. ''I'll go back as far as anyone wants. I
think I am right in saying that I'm one of two few eclectic registers
that will try to track anything -- maybe out of foolishness rather than
knowledge.
''Recently I was shown a tulip-shaped cup with no mark on it apart
from made in England. Now that will be very difficult to find. There are
no clues. Unless I see it somewhere with my own eyes, there's no way
I'll get it.''
Photographs, are the best means of showing exactly what piece and
pattern is needed. But these should be taken against a plain background,
says Jeanne, grimacing as she recounts pictures she has received of
floral cups displayed on a checked tablecloth with a background of
flowery curtains.
''You say, where's the cup? It's like Spot the Ball. Sometimes people
send very good tracings of patterns, done on kitchen greaseproof paper.
If they can't get the colours right, they just describe them to me. I
need to know all the marks on the back of the piece too.''
Although there can be frustrations in her work -- such as unreasonable
people who think she should be able to locate what they want in the
twinkling of an eye or who moan about her #6 registration fee, clearly
imagining that she should fund her own time and overheads on their
behalf -- she enjoys her new role.
There is, she says, ''huge satsifaction in making something complete
and there's such joy when people get the bit they've been looking for,
often they've been searching themselves for a few years before they come
to me.
''Recently I found within 10 days the two patterns a woman from the
islands had registered with me about three years ago.''
So, if you've had a smashing time with precious china you can't
replace, Jeanne Hackett just might be able to help.

<HEADLINE>Cleared actor pleads for anonymity for rape accused</HEADLINE>

THE TV comedy actor Craig Charles was celebrating the end of a
''nine-month nightmare'' last night after being cleared of committing a
sex attack on a former Soho stripper.
The Liverpool-born actor shed tears of relief as the jury delivered
its verdict after 90 minutes' deliberation.
He immediately attacked the police and Crown Prosecution Service for
bringing the ''lamentable'' case to court.
On the steps of London's Southwark Crown Court, Mr Charles called for
a change in the law to give anonymity to rape defendants as well as rape
victims.
The star of the cult BBC2 sci-fi comedy, Red Dwarf, had spent more
than three months on remand in Wandsworth Prison, where he was attacked
by other inmates.
He said: ''As an innocent man, I am appalled about the publicity this
case has brought. The fact that my name and address, along with my
picture, can appear on the front of the papers before the so-called
victim has even signed a statement proves that anonymity for rape
defendants is a must and that the law must be changed.''
His demand echoes that of the Surrey police constable Michael Seear,
25, who was cleared at the Old Bailey last month of raping a female
officer after a ''tarts and toffs'' fancy dress party.
The campaign group, Women Against Rape, last night dismissed the
actor's demand. A spokeswoman said: ''Men accused of rape should not be
treated differently to those accused of other crimes . . . it's the
women who suffer the stigma and need the protection.''
Mr Charles, 30, who plays David Lister, the last human in the
universe, in the BBC2 comedy, was accused with a friend, company
director John Peploe, 37, of raping and indecently assaulting a
38-year-old woman at her flat in Clapham, south London.
Both men were cleared of all charges by the jury of eight men and four
women after a 10-day hearing.
The woman, a former girlfriend of Mr Charles, claimed that he had
called at her flat at around 6am one day last July and told her to have
sex with Mr Peploe and a third man called Roger, who has not been
traced.
The woman, who was not in court to hear the verdict, told the jury
that, after she repeatedly refused, the actor tied her up, blindfolded
her, and encouraged one of his companions to rape and sexually abuse
her.
The defendants denied the claims, saying they called on the woman on
the spur of the moment, hoping for a ''bacon butty'' after a night on
the town.
They said she was angry that Mr Charles was planning to marry his
latest girlfriend, another former stripper, and became ''sexually
aggressive''.
While they took cocaine, she put on a succession of seductive clothes,
finally ripping off knickers and shorts and abusing herself with an
olive oil bottle, pen, orange, and some cocaine.
The actor's counsel, Mr Stephen Solley QC, said there were key flaws
in the Crown case, including the ''completely unacceptable, inadequate,
and half-hearted'' forensic evidence.
The jury heard that, despite many forensic tests, nothing was found in
the flat which showed the two men had taken part in the sex acts the
woman described.
There was also criticism of police handling of the case, including
what Judge Michael Harris said was a ''lamentable'' 30-hour delay before
the woman was seen by a doctor.
After the verdict, Commander Tom Williamson, chairman of the
Metropolitan Police serious sexual offences committee, said a change in
the system of contacting doctors in such cases was being considered.
Mr Charles, from Kennington, south London, was fiercely critical of
the police. In a statement read outside the court, he said: ''This is
the end of a nine-month nightmare for me and my family.
''For three-and-a-half of those months, I was locked up for 23 hours a
day and forced to urinate and defecate in a bucket in front of other
people.
''And what is horrendous is that all the lies the so-called victim
told in court and were printed by the press were easily revealed by my
QC, Stephen Solley, under cross-examination and were therefore there for
any fair-minded police officer to see.''
Mr Charles said: ''The jury took only one-and-a-half hours to decide
this matter. This case should never have come to court.
''It was, as the judge said, a lamentable effort by the police to
investigate some serious allegations against me.''
Mr Charles added: ''I hope that the publicity does not deter genuine
rape victims from reporting what is in fact a heinous crime and a crime
against humanity.''
The BBC and Red Dwarf's producers, Grant Naylor Productions, said they
were ''delighted for Craig that he has been acquitted''.
A joint statement added: ''A new series of Red Dwarf was commissioned
last year by the BBC and Grant Naylor will be discussing the actualities
of the production in the near future.''

The plan is -- there's
no plan. The modern
kitchen compiled from
free-standing units is
easier to live with
than regimented ranks,
says Kennedy Wilson
THE cookery writer Elizabeth David, who died in 1992, once said that
the kitchen should be ''the most comforting and comfortable room in the
house''. Mrs David had two kitchens -- her winter kitchen which was
small and intimate, and her more spacious summer kitchen used for
large-party cooking.
Recently, the contents of her kitchens were sold at auction.
Photographs of the doyenne's domain showed a very mismatched,
old-fashioned kitchen -- no shiny stainless steel, no tasteful matching
cabinets and potted plants.
In recent years the kitchen has undergone a transformation from dull
and utilitarian workplace to thoroughgoing living space. In his new book
The Art of Kitchen Design, leading kitchen architect Johnny Grey shows
the kitchen can be made efficient and contemporary using traditional
materials to create an elegant but homely living area. Grey shows a
variety of unfitted kitchen ideas for large and small spaces.
For Grey ''the space and gaps between the furniture assist in making
the kitchen feel more like a living room with its dedication to comfort.
I have long disliked the placing of a hob or stove in a row of base
units because it detracts from the symbolic significance and historical
roots of the hearth. The stove is the focal point of any kitchen''.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, one of Grey's main inspirations was his aunt
who was none other than the celebrated Elizabeth David, and his first
commission was to build a kitchen for her. Other influences included the
country kitchens of Scandinavia and Britain. One of Johnny Grey's great
loves has been the free-standing dresser and he is a pioneer of the new
back-to-basics trend towards ''unfitted'' kitchens.
Like his aunt, Grey prefers wooden draining boards -- Mrs David
considered metal too unfriendly and capable of doing damage to precious
glass and china. In the eighties Grey worked with Smallbone of Devizes
and over the years has received many major awards. The American magazine
Metropolitan Home named him ''the world's best kitchen designer'' and
the cover of his new book labels him the ''creator of the unfitted
kitchen''.
The kitchen is at the heart of the home and it is often a luxurious
fitted kitchen that is the real draw in new show houses. Fitted kitchen
cabinets originated in Germany but were popularised in the States and,
argues Grey, ''reduced the kitchen to a manufacturer's idea of
convenience and efficiency and was devoid of clutter or humanity. These
kitchens might have been easy to clean, but were also cold and sterile.
They lacked any inviting aspects that create a room in which to dwell,
eat or conduct family life''.
Glamorous ''country kitchens'' made for city dwellers look nothing
like the real thing; no uneven flagstones, haphazard furniture or
soot-blackened chimney breast. Now deluxe tailor-made kichen companies
often specialise in carefully designed unfitted kitchens.
In many ways the kitchen has taken over from the sitting room as the
place where the family gathers together, and, far from being the private
preserve of women or servants, is now the most public room in the house.
One reason for this transformation is the disappearance of much of the
endless drudgery that used to take place in the kitchen -- hours of
hand-washing laundry and time-consuming bread-making.
The Newcastle Furniture Company has been established for 13 years,
making some of the finest fitted and free-standing furniture in Britain
today. The company now has a complete catalogue of free-standing
furniture, mainly for kitchens.
Now Newcastle's reliably built, solid wood furniture can be seen at
Kitchens Plus in Edinburgh, which specialises in planning and fitting
bespoke kitchens. Kitchens Plus's Peter Blackhall has seen an increasing
move towards the unfitted kitchen in recent years.
''People who may be in a job for four or five years before moving on
may well prefer an unfitted piece so that they can take it with them
when they move,'' says Blackhall. ''The kitchens we're now designing
tend to have a fitted section and then unfitted elements like a larder
or dresser.''
Unfitted kitchens with features like butcher's block, Welsh dresser,
unmatched cabinets, huge Belfast sink (now being mass produced again)
and open range with Aga or Rayburn are the most fashionable and in
demand today.

ONE owner summed it up by saying: ''It makes the most perfect
meringues in the world.''
While meringues may not be the most economically sound reason for
spending anything from #4000 upwards on an Aga cooker, her words were
spoken with an underlying passion that is immediately detectable in all
Aga owners.
You don't find impartial Aga owners. This rules out the notion that
they are status symbols; the domestic equivalent to the Jaguar in the
garage. Agas evoke unparalleled emotions for what is basically around 12
cwt of iron that cooks and heats water. Their mystique is hard to
quantify but clearly this is not just any old iron.
The Aga was invented in 1922 by Dr Gustav Dalen, a Swedish physicist
and Nobel Prize winner. The name comes from the initials of the company
he managed -- Svenska Aktiebolaget Gas Accumulator -- who made and
marketed the cooker. In 1929 it came to Britain and after the Second
World War, manufacture began in Telford, Shropshire, aptly the
cornerstone of the Industrial Revolution.
Agas operate on a heat storage principle. With a relatively small
energy source that nowadays can be propane gas, natural gas, oil, solid
fuel or electricity, the heat from this source is stored by iron casings
inside the cooker. To retain this stored heat, the Aga is highly
insulated to ensure that the pre-determined temperatures are maintained
for the cast-iron hotplates and ovens and the cooker has thermostatic
control.
The hallmark of an Aga is the two distinctively-styled round
insulating lids. When lowered, they retain the heat within the cooker;
when raised, they reveal the boiling and simmering plates which can both
comfortably accommodate three sizeable saucepans. And there are two (or
four) ovens which can do everything (even revive new-born lambs) and are
hugely forgiving if you make a mistake. But Aga love affairs seem to be
sparked by emotion as much as technology.
Katy McBride lives in Peebles with her husband, one dog, two cats . .
. and a dark green Aga. Hers was a wedding present from her parents
three years ago and being oil-fuelled, it provided the cooking hot water
and central heating for their cottage for about #25 a month.
''The low running costs are an obvious advantage but I also think an
Aga conjures up emotive images, like cosy farmhouse kitchens. It's a bit
like having a cat purring away on a blanket in the corner of the
kitchen,'' she says. ''Oil can be a bit noisy but to me the sound
epitomises security and reassurance and, like many owners, I could not
imagine ever using anything else.''
Katy is a good cook but she believes an Aga makes anyone a good cook.
''It's almost impossible to burn anything for a start and, although you
get instructions and a cookery book, you really learn by trial and
error.
''The simmering oven cooks for hours and produces food that just melts
in your mouth and because the heat is consistent, the baking oven is
great for bread too,'' she adds.
One advantage of Aga cooking is that there are no smells; both ovens
are ventilated into the flue and taken outside.
Katy recently greeted a couple whose car had broken down nearby. ''The
aroma of steak pie wafting from our chimney apparently made us an
irresistible source of a phone call for help!''
An Aga may epitomise a country farmhouse but nowadays just as many are
being installed in towns and cities. Television sports presenter Bill
McFarlane and his wife Caroline have an Aga in their Glasgow villa. ''I
grew up with an old fashioned model and I was desperate to have one of
my own,'' says Caroline. ''In fact, it was the first thing we did when
we bought this house; chaos reigned in every room -- but I had my Aga.
''I love its instant heat and whenever I come in, I rush to it and
stick my feet in it. Bliss!
''It cooks everything to perfection as well, although it is a totally
different way of cooking and it's true you learn by trial and error.
''I remember thinking the Aga would be the ideal place to dry off a
duvet, but unfortunately I put it in the oven and forgot about it. But
even that didn't burn . . .''
Marilyn McMeeking is a partner in Helensburgh-based Reid Heating, one
of two authorised distributers in Strathclyde. ''Agas are not made up
when they leave the factory so installation takes on average a day and a
half on a prepared site,'' she says.
''Natural gas is the most popular choice of fuel, although oil is the
most economical and they now come in a wide range of colours. Many
people believe you can't have an Aga in a flat but you can -- as long as
the floor will take the weight. We have installed several Agas into
tenement flats in Glasgow and they are becoming much more popular in
cities.''
An Aga may be an expensive purchase but, faced with the proposition of
moving home and having to leave one behind, Aga owners admit they would
have another on order before the ink was dry on the missives.

TWO urban regeneration projects in Ayrshire and Inverclyde were
announced by Scottish Housing Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton
yesterday.
They will be part of Scottish Homes' programme of Smaller Urban
Renewal Initiatives.
The Ayrshire project will cover areas in Cunninghame within the towns
of Ardrossan, Saltcoats, Stevenson, Dalry, Kilbirnie, and Beith. In
Inverclyde, the initiative will cover the Strone Farm and Gibbshill
estates.
Lord James said he had invited Scottish Homes, along with local
authorities and enterprise companies, to work up a detailed strategy for
each area.
The Inverclyde initiative would eventually tie in with the proposed
partnership covering the whole of the Inverclyde area which is expected
to be a candidate for Partnership Priority status.
Lord James told the conference of the Chartered Institute of Housing
in Scotland in Aviemore that Smaller Urban Renewal Initiatives had grown
significantly in recent years and there were currently 13 across the
country.
A review of such policies, he said, had confirmed regeneration had to
be comprehensive, tackling the economic, physical, and social problems
of disadvantaged areas.
As a result, the formation of city or district-wide partnerships in
areas of significant concentration of deprivation would be encouraged.
These partnerships would be invited to produce regeneration strategies
at city and district levels and to develop more localised proposals for
priority areas.

JAMES B McLaren, the former Herald motoring correspondent and founder
of the Association of Scottish Motoring Writers, has died after a short
illness. He was 84.
Before going into hospital last month, JB, who was with the former
Glasgow Herald for 50 years, had been riding his motorcycle the only way
he ever knew -- flat out and to the very limit.
Aware that time was running out on an action-packed life, he told me
from his hospital bed: ''I am now 84 and recently going towards a corner
realised the speedo on the bike was showing 82mph. Maybe it's time to
start putting the anchors on a bit.''
Apart from his beloved motorcycle, his other love since retiring from
journalism in 1975 was sailing.
James Brydone McLaren became motoring writer of the Glasgow Herald in
the early fifties. He entered journalism as a 14-year-old copy boy on
the Evening Citizen in 1925 where he remained as a reporter until moving
to the Herald in 1938.
After a period as a sub-editor, he joined the Army in 1940, a year
after marrying, but was invalided out in 1942.
He is survived by his daughter, June.

A deep pile of preferences? Joan Devlin meets a carpet expert who
fulfils her Eastern promise to floor you with ideas.
TRACY COSGROVE will transport you to new heights of delight on her
magic carpets. Think of a theme, dream of a colour, envisage a shape and
she'll wave her wand and summon up a Chinese carpet or rug custom-made
to your every requirement.
Her business, Jade Carpets, began -- although she didn't realise it at
the time -- when she lived in Hong Kong for five years while her husband
was working there. Tracy was employed by the largest designer furniture
company in the colony, running a showroom of 36,000 sq ft.
''I did business with Government House and hobnobbed with people in
all sorts of walks of life who gave me their cards,'' she recalls.
''After that I was the only European to sell carpets in Hong Kong. My
contacts meant I was able to go to the Governor again and to the
managers of places like the Hilton and Mariott, for example, because I
knew them by then.''
It was a heady stuff.
When she returned to the UK four years ago, after her husband accepted
a job in Scotland, the couple's two children were both under 18 months.
Despite a busy home life, Tracy decided she had ''to do something''.
She started importing Chinese furniture. Initially it did well, then
quietened off. She rented a shop in Helensburgh from a friend. When a
woman told her she had always wanted a custom-made Chinese rug, Tracy
told her she could get her one.
When she contacted the Hong Kong carpet company, they offered her a
job. She told them she preferred to start up on her own, and order rugs
from them. They agreed. ''It gave me autonomy -- you can set your own
pace and enjoy it more. If I was starting something from scratch, I
wanted to do it under my own steam, and for my own benefit.''
A year last October, she took a stand at the SECC for the Modern Homes
Exhibition. In three days, she had recouped her costs. Her rug business
burgeoned, and so many people asked her about Chinese furniture, she
started importing that again, too.
Tracy's business is run from home. She finds her clients by taking
stands at exhibitions, and by word-of-mouth recommendation. Traditional
Chinese patterns go by the board here. Customers can choose any design
they like, with Tracy -- helped technically by her husband -- working
out all the details.
One of her customers, a family who lived by the sea, had bought a
striking circular glass-topped coffee table, held up by the rising form
of a mermaid. Tracy designed a large rug, with a curvacious edge to
simulate water, in tones of blue, deepest at the centre, where the
mermaid table sat, and fading gradually through dappled, blue hues to
white at the outer edges, the mermaid emerging from the sea.
''The couple were delighted,'' reports Tracy. ''It's such a happy job,
it's lovely to see people so pleased. I can spend five or six hours with
a client which you could never do in a shop, you'd have to set a price
on that.''
Prices? A 6ft-by-9ft rug starts from #1050, and goes up to #2100. Most
of the designs average #1500 -- ''but you can get a stunning rug for the
lowest price,'' says Tracy, ''which uses four colours . . . enough for
the majority of houses. Delivery is two to four months.''

A DAWN raid was launched yesterday by hundreds of police and security
guards on sleeping M77 protesters as Wimpey surrounded the site on the
south side of Glasgow with steel fences.
Protesters claimed they were dragged from their caravan near
Corkerhill estate and sat upon by security guards while the fence was
erected at around 5.30am.
During the day, three protesters were arrested for breach of the
peace. They included two women, one of whom was reported to be six
months pregnant.
As the third person was arrested, dozens of protesters and pupils from
Lourdes Secondary School nearby attempted to block the police Range
Rover he was placed in, and minor scuffles broke out. All three are
expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court on Monday morning.
Among the protesters were two Glasgow councillors, Pollok's Tommy
Sheridan and Mr Nicky Bennett, who represents South Nitshill. Mr Bennett
said: ''The place was just ripped apart at about five in the morning and
security guards sat on us for about 20 minutes, then they put us by a
fire and put a double cordon round us.''
Councillor Sheridan said he was shocked at the heavy police presence,
which he felt has shattered community relations with Strathclyde Police.
A police spokesman said the steel fence was in place to protect the
public, especially school children, from entering a dangerous work site.
He said: ''Inciting children is a despicable tactic which can do nothing
but damage the cause of genuine protesters.''
A Wimpey spokesman described the day as a success, with more than 350
trees cut down.
Meanwhile, three demonstrators who tried to hold up the workmen were
found guilty of breach of the peace yesterday.
However, a sheriff told Paul Murphy, 28, Jake Hunter, 22, and
20-year-old Frances Claxton, they had given evidence with refreshing
candour. He said he was taking into account that they had unblemished
records and fined them #50 each. Sheriff Archibald Bell, QC, also
warned: ''Others may not be so fortunate.''
During the trial, the court heard that trouble started as workmen
tried to instal a fence at a security compound at the motorway site in
Cowglen, Glasgow, on February 9.
Workmen said they were angry as fencing posts were pulled out, wet
cement scattered on the grass, and the accused stood in front of a
workman with a barrow. The workers said they were being paid by results
and this was affecting their wages.
Police arrested Murphy, of Millbrae Crescent, Langside; Hunter, of The
Hexagonal Tree, Pollok Estate; and Claxton of 1979 Maryhill Road,
Maryhill, all Glasgow.
The accused told their solicitor, Mr Alan Miller, they were protesting
because they felt the new motorway was a threat to the environment. They
agreed they pulled out fence poles, scattered cement and stood in front
of the barrow. But they said if police had told them to stop they would
have done so and did not think they were committing an offence.

They can take a long-dead roof beam and bring it to sparkling life.
Wendy Jack appreciates the recycling work of Touch Wood
WITH his crumpled linen jacket and tousled hair, Doug Glanvill is
unlikely to be mistaken for an accountant. Look at some of the fine
pieces of old pine furniture he sells, and it's easy to imagine them in
their original setting, in a house with a bit of history . . .
But you would be wrong to make assumptions on either count. He trained
as an accountant while his custom-built furniture has indeed had a
previous life -- as roof beams, perhaps.
Recycling may not be a term generally synonymous with aesthetically
pleasing, but a visit to his shop, at Howe Street in Edinburgh's New
Town, proves this particular recycling exercise has resulted in some
very desirable furniture, all the more interesting for its unusual past.
Touch Wood was set up by Doug Glanvill two and a half years ago in
partnership with a friend from the furniture business. ''The idea was
that he would provide the furniture background and I'd look after the
financial aspects and then we'd keep going,'' he says. ''But last year
he decided to go on to something else, so my wife and I bought him
out.''
New good-quality pine is sold by Touch Wood, but it is the old pieces
which are of particular interest.
''Our old wood is salvaged from buildings which have been
demolished,'' he says. ''When it comes to us it's in terrible condition.
We strip it all back and take the nails out. With a big roof beam, the
only thing you can do is use a metal detector: digging out nails out is
a time-consuming business. The wood can then be carved and planed and
made into new pieces.
''Although the old wood actually costs slightly less to buy than the
new, by the time you've done the work on it, eventually it works out
more expensive. It's also much dirtier for the people working with it.''
Some memorably covetable kitchen dressers are on display, and he says
many of them have been designed specifically for customers who describe
what they're looking for. Sketches are drawn and when the right
specification is arrived at, a price is worked out and production can
get underway.
Glanvill weighs in with advice when necessary, to ensure the piece is
kept in proportion. A made-to-measure order takes six to eight weeks
while standard pieces take four to six.
The most common orders are for kitchen, bedroom and dining room
furniture -- the old pine tables are fabulous and can be made to precise
measurements. Drawers can also be incorporated.
''I like to think ours are the chunkiest farmhouse tables around,''
smiles Glanvill, patting one with magnificent hand-turned legs. This
model, 72in by 36in, is #445 -- which seems a bargain compared with many
for a splendidly handsome old table. Another, with slightly less sturdy
legs, is #395.
Brilliant is the word for his Irish dressers. They boast delightful
fretwork detail and are very slim from back to front. ''We decided to
keep them as true to the original design as we could,'' he says.
With cupboards, drawers and plate-racks, it is practical as well as
easy on the eye. In solid wood throughout, it represents fair value at
#875.
''You have to be careful with the old wood, sometimes what you can buy
is not a good quality for making furniture, so we are careful in
selecting it,'' explains Glanvill. ''You need to have the experience to
say 'this lump's in a terrible state, but I can tell it's going to have
a nice grain and character . . .' ''
He employs a team of craftsmen who are responsive to other people's
designs. In fact, if you've got an idea for a design in pine, all you
need do is Touch Wood.

<HEADLINE>Inquiry as The Word flies runaway boy to US</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979566873</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
CHANNEL 4 last night admitted ''an error of judgment'' and launched an
inquiry into the decision by programme makers to fly runaway schoolboy
Peter Kerry to New York.
The channel's youth show, The Word, had planned to feature Peter, 14,
in last night's live programme but the item was withdrawn at the last
minute after his headmaster voiced concern that he was taken out of
school without permission.
By then, Peter, of Harrow, north London, who hit the headlines this
week after flying to Malaysia with his father's passport and credit
card, had already set off for America with the programme.
Channel 4 chairman Sir Michael Bishop said the station had made ''an
error of judgment'' in taking Peter to New York, even though his parents
agreed.
Channel bosses were ''concerned'' that Peter travelled to New York
despite the decision to drop him from The Word.
Sir Michael had asked chief executive Mr Michael Grade to launch an
inquiry into the ''lapse'' and recommend ways to keep the controversial
show, made by independent company Planet 24, on a tighter rein.
Channel 4 and Planet 24 producers made the decision to scrap the item
at a meeting this afternoon.
''The key factor in this decision was the concern expressed by the
school,'' a programme spokesman said.
Dr Alan Robinson, headmaster of Langley Grammar school, near Slough,
Berkshire, where Peter is a pupil, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One
programme that he was ''very concerned'' because Peter should have been
back at school.
''I have not given permission for Peter to be absent for his trip to
the States. I gather that he has left Heathrow this morning and will not
be back until 6am on Monday,'' he added.
''It concerns me that it looks clearly that he has been offered a
reward for what he's done and I feel that is totally the wrong way to go
about it. It's sending the wrong signals to our children.''
According to the producer of The Word, Mr Duncan Gray, Peter's parents
allowed him to make the free trip to New York -- less than 48 hours
after returning from his Malaysian jaunt -- because they feared he would
run away to America at some time anyway. It was the country he most
wanted to visit, said his mother, Pat.
Langley grammar deputy head Ms Janet Jameson said Dr Robinson had
spoken to The Word's producers by telephone during the afternoon.
''They told him Peter would probably say going to Malaysia had been a
bad idea and he did not recommend it, and asked if that would make it
all right,'' she said. ''Well, it doesn't really make anything all
right.''

WOMEN were urged yesterday not to be deterred from going for breast
screening because of the error which led to a Dundee woman being wrongly
sent an all-clear letter.
As a result of the mistake, 300,000 breast screening records
throughout Scotland are to be re-examined to ensure letters sent to
patients correspond with the original results.
The records of 50,000 women in Grampian, Orkney, and Shetland are
among those to be checked.
Mrs Fiona Gilbert, the consultant in charge of Aberdeen's breast
screening service, said yesterday that she was confident it would not
uncover any serious problems because of failsafe procedures already in
place.
The checks would be made back to 1990 but some of these woman had
already been checked as they had returned for a second scan if their
first was in 1990 or 1991.
Mrs Gilbert said that, following incidents elsewhere more than a year
ago, Aberdeen's failsafe procedures were examined.
Five checks were made before notes reached the records office. Staff
there also made checks as they were putting information onto the
computer.
The Aberdeen centre had received only one call from an anxious woman
in the wake of the Dundee revelation but a helpline has been set up on
0224 840570.
''This should not put women off in any way from coming to be
screened,'' Mrs Gilbert said.
''It is very important that they have breast X-rays in order to detect
early cancer so we can alter their prognosis and stop them from dying
from this disease.
''People who have been once should remember to come every three years
because cancers do occur in the interval.''
The reported procedural errors have prompted Ayrshire and Arran and
Dumfries and Galloway Health Board to issue a statement aimed at
reassuring women in the South-west of Scotland.
Dr Jim McHardy, public health consultant with Ayrshire and Arran
Health Board, said: ''Our records are regularly reviewed to try to
prevent any loopholes, and indeed, a double-check of a random 10% of
cases was instituted last summer and is undertaken every week to ensure
total accuracy.
''However, we want to ensure that women in the south-west of Scotland
have total confidence in their local service and that is why we welcome
the recommendation by the Scottish Breast Screening Service for a review
of all Scottish breast screening records.
''It is a sensible precaution that should give peace of mind to
everyone.
''This process will take several weeks but knowing the checks in
place, I want to stress that women in the South-west of Scotland should
continue to use the service which will continue as normal during this
review.''

A SETTLEMENT has been reached between sacked nurses' union official
Mrs Irenee O'Neill and the Royal College of Nursing.
Mrs O'Neill, of Strathaven, had claimed she was unfairly dismissed
from her job as a Scottish area officer with the RCN. Her dismissal last
year related to allegations concerning her car mileage expenses.
She was due to fight her unfair sacking claim at an industrial
tribunal in Glasgow next week but the Central Office of Industrial
Tribunals in Glasgow confirmed yesterday the case had been settled. No
further details were given.
Mrs O'Neill's solicitor, Mr Malcolm MacKay, said: ''Mrs O'Neill is
pleased to confirm the dispute between herself and the Royal College of
Nursing has now been satisfactorily resolved. In the circumstances, she
does not wish to discuss the terms of the agreement but she can confirm
she is satisfied with the outcome.''
It is understood the settlement does not include her reinstatement.
Meanwhile, the Royal College of Nursing refused to discuss the terms of
the agreement but confirmed it was ''very satisfied with the outcome''.
A successor to Mrs O'Neill's post has been appointed. She is Ms Ann
Thomson, a general and mental health nurse and health visitor currently
based at Ruchill Hospital, who is experienced in the health care of
marginalised groups.

THE Rev Norman Shanks, a former convener of the Church of Scotland's
church and nation committee and a lecturer in practical theology at
Glasgow University, has been elected the new leader of Iona Community.
He will succeed the Rev John Harvey from August.
Mr Shanks is married with three children. Before entering the
ministry, he was a civil servant in the Scottish Office from 1964 to
1979, and was private secretary to two Secretaries of State for Scotland
-- William Ross and Bruce Millan.
He said: ''I feel very honoured to have been elected leader by the
members of the Iona Community and look forward with enthusiasm to
working with the community through the next stage of its quest to find
ways to touch the hearts of all.''
Iona Community was initially a movement for renewal in the church. It
was founded in 1938 by the late Lord MacLeod of Fuinary.
Now, with 200 members, 1200 associates, and 1500 friends, the
community describes itself as ''an ecumenical community of men and women
seeking new ways of living the Gospel in today's world''.
Its members are committed to a rule of daily prayer and Bible study,
sharing and accounting for the use of their money and their time, and
the promotion of action for peace and justice in the world.

MARGARET Robertson is living proof of the notion that gardeners are
born, not made.
She started her lifelong interest early on, brought up in a home in
Dundee with a very large garden. Her father was a keen gardener, and
instilled a knowledge of Latin names of plants in her while she was
still a child.
But she remains reticent about her prowess, and says: ''I don't garden
for publicity. It is because I enjoy it, and get a lot of fun out of
growing things, passing on what knowledge I have to others.''
Following a career associated with the land seemed to come naturally,
and she took an honours degree in Botany followed by three years of
research at the then Scottish Horticultural Research at Invergowrie,
near Dundee.
Getting married involved moving to a house in Cambuslang, with a long,
narrow sheltered garden of around one third of an acre.
It contains a wild miscellany of shrubs, rock plants, vegetables and
fruit. It also has a greenhouse, full of fuchsias in summer. That would
have been enough for most people to fulfil gardening aspirations. Not
for Margaret.
She became honorary secretary in 1975 of the Glasgow and West of
Scotland Horticultural Society in 1975, one of the oldest societies in
the country.
''I have seen many changes in membership,'' she says, ''but with its
regular meetings, outings and other activities, the society is
thriving''.
Margaret also took a very big part in the workload involved; in the
planning and planting of the acclaimed society garden at the Glasgow
Garden Festival. She spent many a long, happy day on duty there.
In addition, she was show secretary for 10 years and is now president
of the local horticultural society in Cambuslang.
But Margaret has never rested on her laurels. She was invited to join
the permanent panel of judges for the International Rose Trials at
Tollcross Park in Glasgow, and also judges at local shows round the
country, not to mention giving illustrated talks over the winter months.
Married to a retired civil engineer, with family grown up and left
home, her life centres on gardening and all its ramifications. Husband
Bob does the heavy work, but admits he is happier on the golf course.
Apart from the spade work, Margaret maintains the garden more or less
by herself. You can see the result of her efforts with a visit by
appointment. Details are available in the new Scotland's Gardens Scheme
booklet.

<HEADLINE>Lawyer tells sheriff that attacker of dead man's employer is sitting in court.    Diving death inquiry witness is beaten up</HEADLINE>

A KEY witness at an inquiry into the death of diver Mr Stewart Locke
was beaten up after giving his evidence.
Mr Alex Thomson, a partner in the commercial diving firm which hired
Mr Locke, was assaulted by two men late on Thursday evening, the inquiry
heard yesterday.
Mr Thomson, 39, had spent Thursday testifying about Mr Locke's
involvement in the operation to recover a #20m haul of smuggled drugs
from the beached yacht Ambrosia.
Details of the attack on Mr Thomson were heard at Peterhead Sheriff
Court on the fourth day of the fatal accident inquiry into the
24-year-old diver's death.
Before proceedings opened yesterday, Mr Thomson limped into the court,
clutching his ribs, and breathing heavily. He had bruises and cuts on
his face and a plaster above his right eye.
Mr Thomson's solicitor, Mr Gordon McGregor, told Sheriff Frank Keane
that, when he arrived at his office in the morning, he was confronted by
Mr Thomson's distraught wife. She had told him her husband had been set
upon by two men who were lurking in shadows near their house around
midnight.
''One of the men, who has been identified to the police, is sitting in
court this morning,'' said Mr McGregor.
Mr McGregor said two other witnesses, Mr Jim Floyd and Mr John Thomson
-- who also worked for J Allan Diving Services -- were now terrified of
giving evidence. He added that his client attributed no blame to Mrs
Claire Locke or her family.
During his evidence, Mr Thomson claimed the dead man had been having
marital difficulties and also that he had a number of convictions for
assault. He admitted to the inquiry that he had instructed his lawyer to
raise the possibility that Mr Locke had committed suicide.
The inquiry has heard that Mr Locke's safety and communication cords
had been cut, apparently deliberately, and that he had removed his air
tanks and helmet.
Sheriff Frank Keane said: ''This is a serious matter when witnesses
who have given evidence under the protection of the court are subjected
to violence. This is a court. Justice is a matter for the court,'' he
said.
A spokesman for Grampian Police said Mr Thomson had made a complaint
but that no-one had been arrested, although inquiries were continuing.
Mr Locke, of Strichen, Aberdeenshire, died off Scotstown Beach, near
Peterhead, in October 1993. He left a widow, Claire, and two young
children.
The drugs -- one of the biggest finds in Scotland -- were in a secret
compartment on board the Ambrosia, which broke up after beaching on a
sandbank.
Lieutenant David Ince, until recently second in command at the Royal
Navy's Mine Clearance Unit based at Rosyth, told the inquiry his team of
divers had been called in a few days after Mr Locke's death.
Asked by depute-fiscal Ray Craig what he thought of diving conditions
off Scotstown Beach, Lieutenant Ince said they were hazardous because of
the wave action. He said that, with the weight of all the equipment Mr
Locke had been wearing, it would be ''like diving in a washing machine
on a high-spin cycle''.
Lieutenant Ince told the inquiry he thought the operation being
carried out by the commercial diving team on the day of the incident had
been ''foolhardy at the very least''.
Mr Jim Floyd, the J Allan Diving Services stand-by diver and
supervisor at the time of the death, said Mr Locke had been in a good
mood on the day he died. Mr Floyd told the inquiry he had been living in
Peterhead for only seven weeks before the fatal dive.
Under questioning by Mr John MacRitchie, solicitor for the dead man's
widow, Mr Floyd said Mr and Mrs Locke had taken him under his wing. He
had been for meals to the couple's house and had become very friendly
with them, the inquiry heard.
Mr Floyd said he found it highly unlikely that Mr Locke would have
taken his own life.
''On the day he died, I had never seen Stewart in a better mood,''
said Mr Floyd. He claimed Mr Locke had been enjoying the diving
operation because he was ''anti-drugs''.
Under questioning by Mr McGregor, Mr Floyd said he was surprised Mr
Locke had gone into the water on the day of the tragedy.
Mr McGregor said: ''When Stewart told you that he was going to dive
and indicated to you to get ready, did you have any particular comment
on that?''
Mr Floyd replied: ''I said you are just a mad bugger going in.''
The inquiry continues on Monday.

Let the experts answer your questions
READERS have beencoming along with various questions of late. These
are some of the main ones, complete with answers and tips.
Q: I NOTICED recently some brown spots on my lawn. It looks as if the
grass is seriously diseased and may die back. What has happened, and
what can I do about it?
A: IT is most likely due to someone walking across the grass when it
is covered with frost. This causes physical damage to the blades of
grass and causes them to die back, almost as if they had been burned. It
is unlikely that disease will set in, and the marks should disappear
when there is more vigorous growth.
Q: ON BARE sections of land, in between my fruit bushes, I have a
tremendous amount of grass. I applied contact weed-killer on several
occasions last year. By autumn, the land was clear. Where has this grass
come from and what can I do about it?
A: THIS is quite likely to be annual meadow grass. It seeds profusely,
and is at its peak in May or June. Annual meadow grass is almost an
inevitable part of the lawn, and seeds have obviously blown across or
even been carried on the feet. Although you have applied weed-killer, it
is possible the seeds were dormant in the ground and took the
opportunity to develop in a moist autumn. You could use a residual
weed-killer, but wait in the meantime for warmer and drier weather. Use
any of the contact killers such as Weedol, which will take care of the
grass plants.
Q: DESPITE spending a bit of money on moss-killing chemicals, I see
big patches developing fast on my grass. I followed the directions and
scarified the moss. It all seems to be of no avail, as if I am back to
square one again.
A: I THINK the mistake is in not killing off the moss properly before
getting busy with the scarifier. You have simply spread moss around.
Spores have germinated beautifully in moist weather. I had to apply
moss-killing chemicals on my own lawn twice, even applying locally on
bad patches.There is no once-and-for-all treatment. You will have to get
busy in March or early April, with combined fertiliser and moss killer.
It will help to top dress with gritty sand, especially when combined
with spiking or slitting the surface.
Q: I HAVE a rather ugly garage which I want to screen off. I have been
told I should grow ivy or Virginia creeper.
A: You could do no better than Russian vine, or polygonum. Put a
trellis on the wall. Tie in the polygonum to this. It will, in time, be
self-supporting and grow on to the roof also.

THE Port of Menteith area, in the Trossachs, is home to the osprey,
and just outside the Port, sitting on the side of the hill in beautiful
surroundings is a house and garden that is home to more than 50 species
of birds.
Spotted flycatchers, tree creepers and siskin are residents and
swallows and house martins make their homes in the byre in the spring.
Curlews, lapwings, pheasants and oystercatchers next in the adjacent
fields and buzzards, in the nearby woods; herons fly over the house,
nesting up at the loch just half a mile away. Geese and whooper swans
fly over in the winter.
Through this garden and a small copse of sessile oaks, ash, rowan and
silver birch runs a burn, and hawthorn and other tall shrubs provide
plenty of homes to let to prospective feathered tenants.
In these idyllic surroundings sits a real family house, spacious and
bright with the sun shining in every room of the house at some point
during the day.
The property is surrounded by hills both near and distant, and views
of the Lake of Menteith can be seen from some windows and the garden.
This six-bedroomed house also offers potential for a bed and breakfast
establishment, a small guest house or hotel, or even a nursing home.
It is within easy commuting distance of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Perth or
Stirling and just four miles from Callander and Aberfoyle.
Smiths Gore of Edinburgh are marketing this property at offers over
#175,000.

THE Egyptian-born Fayed brothers, owners of Harrods and at the centre
of sleaze allegations within the Conservative Party, have been refused
permission to become British nationals.
The Home Office last night declined to elaborate on why their
applications have been refused.
Shocked by the decisions, both Mr Mohamed Al Fayed, chairman of
Harrods, and his brother Ali, deputy chairman, were taking legal advice.
There is no appeal and the only hope to keep their applications open
would be a judicial review.
''They consider that these refusals are unfair and based upon
prejudice,'' Mr Michael Cole, media director for the company, declared
in a statement.
Mr Mohamed Al Fayed said: ''My brother and I have lived here for a
long time and have made a substantial investment in British commerce, as
well as making a positive contribution to other aspects of life in this
country.''
Mr Al Fayed was at the heart of parliamentary allegations when
Conservative MPs were accused of asking questions in the Commons in
return for cash payments.
However, suggestions that he had attempted to blackmail the Government
were soon dropped after an investigation by the Crown Prosecution
Service.
Mr Mohamed Al Fayed applied for British citizenship on February 15
last year. Married to a Finnish woman, he has two sons and two
daughters.
His brother, Ali, married to a British national, had applied for
citizenship on January 29, 1993.
Any application for a judicial review by the Fayed brothers will
centre on the fact that, while the applications for citizenship were
lodged a year apart, both brothers received identical letters, signed by
the same civil servant on the same day -- Friday of last week.
''It would appear they were being dealt with together,'' said a source
close to the brothers.
The brothers are said to be amused by the fact that Britain is
prepared to offer citizenship to anyone from Hong Kong prepared to
invest a few hundred thousand pounds in the UK.
They point out that they bought the Glasgow-based House of Fraser
group, which then included Harrods, in March 1985 for #615m.
While House of Fraser companies have since been floated, the brothers
point out that they have invested #200m on Harrods in capital
expenditure.
Mohamed has paid #27m in tax to the British government.
Some believe that, until the sleaze factor broke out, the Tory
Government might have been prepared to turn a bit of a blind eye to a
Department of Trade report over the Fayeds' House of Fraser takeover in
competition with Tiny Rowland and Lonrho and that the Fayeds should be
given British nationality.
Naturally, that is denied by all concerned.
The DTI report found that the Fayeds had lied about their sources,
their wealth, and their background. Last year, the European Court of
Human Rights ruled that the brothers had not been unfairly treated by
this report.
Liberal Democrat MP Alex Carlile, who raised Mr Al Fayed's
''cash-for-questions'' allegations in the Commons, said the decision to
refuse citizenship was ''disgraceful''.
He added: ''I think this is an outrageous piece of political revenge
by the Government.
''These are two people who have made a significant contribution to the
British economy. They are somewhat controversial but they have never
been charged with any offence and indeed the takeover of Harrods and the
House of Fraser was allowed with the connivance of the Government.
''I think that they have been discriminated against out of a
disgraceful piece of pique.''
The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said the decision was
''perverse'' in law and open to challenge in the High Court.
JCWI director Claude Moraes said there were no grounds for refusing Mr
Al Fayed, given his wife and daughters were British, his length of
residence in the country and his contribution to the economy.''
Mr Mohamed Al Fayed's belief that his brother's citizenship
application was being unreasonably delayed sparked his crusade against
Government ''sleaze'' last year.
A story appeared in The Guardian, alleging that the Junior Ministers,
Mr Neil Hamilton and Mr Tim Smith, had accepted money, through the
lobbyist Ian Greer, to raise issues favourable to the Fayed cause in the
Commons.
Mr Smith and Mr Hamilton later resigned.
Mr Al Fayed was also instrumental in bringing to light allegations
concerning Treasury Minister Jonathan Aitken's stay at the Ritz Hotel in
Paris, which he owns.
Even Home Secretary Michael Howard was drawn into the controversy,
when it emerged he specifically asked Junior Minister Charles Wardle to
deal with both citizenship applications.
Mr Mohamed Al Fayed smiles when he recalls that the first property he
bought in the UK was Balnagown Castle, near Tain, Easter Ross.
Since 1972, he has bought up adjoining policies, to the stage where he
now owns 40,000 acres in the area.
He insists that he is most at home when he visits Scotland.
Mohamed Al Fayed has also made it known that he takes some comfort
from an assurance from the local SNP -- when it became apparent that his
application for British nationality might not be a foregone conclusion
-- that he need not worry too much.
''When Scotland becomes independent you can become one of us,'' he was
assured.

IF you're seeking inspiration to decorate a wooden tray, a plain box,
a metal jug or a child's wooden chair -- as pictured here -- Decorative
Folk Art (David and Charles #15.99) is the book for you, writes Leila
Aitken.
Written by Canadians Sybil Edwards and Lynette Bleiler, and Australian
Chris Moore, it is a practical guide to the techniques you need for
decorating and transforming household objects.
It includes 20 step-by-step projects in folk art painting, with
patterns and transfers for the traditional designs. This is less a
coffee-table book than a means of giving the table itself an attractive
new (old) look.

A COTTAGE set in two-thirds of an acre which can be reached in less
than 25 minutes from the heart of Glasgow is someting many dream of and
few achieve. John and Kirsty Watson were smart enough to recognise
potential when they saw it six years ago, and today, thanks to the
sensitivity of their ideas and the expertise of their architect, they
live in an idyllic home in Strathblane, with their three sons,
six-year-old Angus, Sandy, three, and Fergus, who is one.
The ''cottage'', despite having character of the kind usually
developed through age, was built as recently as 1948 -- ''the year I was
born,'' says John Watson, who heads up the old-established Glasgow
printing company which bears his name.
When the couple bought the house ''it was bitty,'' explained Kirsty,
''with several doors opening off the main room.'' It now has an
elegantly homely lounge hall filled with colour and style, and a warmly
welcoming atmosphere, which is not created solely by the blazing open
fire at one end of the room.
A slim archway to one side of the fireplace, approached by a couple of
steps, leads to the bay windowed dining room which was added by the
couple, while above it, with the same window feature, is their own
bedroom and en -suite bathroom.
''If anyone could tell from outside the house that we'd extended it,
I'd have failed in what I was trying to do,'' explained John. Suffice to
say he has not failed. Today, the house combines cottagey charm with all
the space and amenities of a very des. res.
The spacious family kitchen which adjoins the dining room was
extended, and double doors lead from it to a superb conservatory,
planned as an extra room rather than a place only to use in summer,
complete with slated roof.
Kirsty -- a former Norland-trained nanny -- who has considerably
artistic talent, uses the room whenever she can for her painting. It is
in evidence all over the house, on what her husband calls ''oor Wullie''
buckets, decorated with flowers, or with cockerels and used for storing
utensils or fruit in the kitchen, and on fabulous toy boxes in each of
the boys' rooms. In the lounge, the archway to the dining room is
delicately stencilled with ivy leaves which she painted.
With curtains in a rich floral fabric in warm pinks and apricots, soft
lamps, pretty knick knacks comfy upholstered rattan sofas and chairs and
a wheelbarrow filled with plants, the conservatory is a room to dream
of, and one to dream in.
Nearby, another new room has been added, this time a spacious playroom
for Angus, Sandy and Fergus. It has its own loo next door, decorated in
matching blue and apricot. The route back to the lounge leads through
another snug little room: ''It's a sit-ooterie, the rogues' gallery,''
laughs John, referring to dozens of family photographs displayed on its
walls. ''There's a bit of ironing done here, piano practice, or it can
be just somewhere to be quiet,'' he continues.
Back in the lounge, with its swagged and tailed windows in torquoise
and apricot, with floral and plain patterned chairs and sofas, Kirsty
explains that once, the black upright piano and a hifi stood at the end
of the room, facing the fireplace.
''It just didn't work,'' she says. ''A girlfriend of mine said she had
a hanging dresser doing nothing in her garage...it was perfect. It makes
that side of the room.'' In antique pine, it is indeed a brilliant
edition, its shelves and display spaces crammed with all sorts of pretty
treasures.
Up the open-plan stair with its traditionally styled bannisters -- the
Watsons bedroom is a cosy haven with blues and pinks the predominant
colours. The upper walls are finely striped in blue and white, the lower
half has a pattern of blue and pink bows. The flower-covered curtains
and bedspread, are repeated in the drapes used behind the glazed panes
of the fitted wardrobes. The couples pretty bathroom opens off the room.
The three boys have a room each, and their father proudly points out
his wife's artistry on their toy boxes. ''We saw some in Harrods. They
were about #1000 and didn't have nearly as much design on them. Kirsty
buys the boxes for about #35, then paints them...''
The Watsons entertain quite a lot, and agree that the lounge hall is a
room which works very well for them. ''With a lot of people, we used the
whole room,'' says John, ''but if we only have one or two, we just sit
round the fire.''
While they enjoy large, formal dinner parties with the best china and
crystal all laid out in the dining room, Kirsty also loves giving small
supper parties for six, in her pretty, cosy kitchen with its pine table
and chairs. ''It means I can chat and be in on the action'' she smiles.
''It's welcoming and I like it, but I keep it very simple.''
But enough of this idle chat. Upstairs, three small bare bottoms are
hurtling out of the bedrooms. It's bathtime... Time to go.

A FIVE-year-old boy was recovering in hospital last night after
surgeons successfully sewed back his severed penis.
Doctors also managed to re-attach one of his testicles after all his
sex organs were mutilated at his home. Police called to arrest a knife
wielding man had to search the back garden for the severed parts.
Surgeons praised the officers for their quick action, saying that gave
them a chance to restore the organs.
They were packed in ice and rushed to hospital with the child. The
youngster was still sedated last night after the microsurgery.
Consultant Mr James Frame, who led the team of plastic surgeons at St
Andrew's Hospital, Billericay, Essex, said: ''At the moment, his
clinical condition appears stable although still in the recovery
phase.''
Police in Hornsey, north London, were still questioning a 24-year-old
man arrested at the house in nearby Wood Green.
A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ''At this stage, there is no known
motive for the assault.''

WHILE babies tend to grow with amazing alacrity, the problem with most
of their nursery equipment is that it doesn't, writes Beverly Brown.
But now the Norwegians have come up with Tripp Trapp, a chair
ergonomically designed to adapt to a child of any age, height or size --
and which grows with development from babyhood to adulthood.
Available in natural beech or a rosewood stain finish, Tripp Trapp is
can be found at Tony Walker Home Interiors at Charing Cross, Glasgow or
Telford Road, Edinburgh. It retails at around #145, including the baby

A COLLEAGUE of a financial adviser who claims she was sexually
harassed by an Abbey National executive joked about going to bed with
him on the same night, an industrial tribunal heard yesterday.
The remark to David Moseby was part of friendly banter between Abbey
National employees at a Cardiff hotel, said Janet Manship, customer
services manager at the bank's Swansea branch.
She told the tribunal at Southampton that all 11 candidates sitting
tests had been joking about trying to bribe the team of executives who
were assessing them the next day.
Fellow test candidate Anita Gaze, 30, claims that Mr Moseby invited
her to his hotel room for a late night cup of coffee and ''whatever else
might pop up''. He later allegedly harassed her in a lift.
Mrs Gaze, 30, of Bournemouth, has told the tribunal she was given low
marks in the tests after spurning his advances.
She was subsequently sacked from job at the Abbey National office in
Wimborne, Dorset, in 1993, and is claiming sexual discrimination.
Mr Moseby, 43, denies her account of what happened.
The tribunal heard that the following morning Mrs Gaze told Mrs
Manship she had a hangover.
''I felt that we had not drunk an excessive amount of alcohol, but it
may have been excessive for Anita.''
The tribunal later heard that Mr Moseby phoned Mrs Gaze's branch
manager, Pamela Mann, to discuss the test results.
Mrs Mann said he told her Mrs Gaze ''had performed pretty abysmally
and that her computer literacy was dreadful.
''He said that some areas were good and he had tried to beef them up
to put forward what was positive about her.''
She added: ''I think it was his view that she should be given another
chance.''
Mrs Mann said she was given the task of sacking Mrs Gaze just a day
after she returned from the tests.
Mrs Gaze became ''very upset'' and told her about the alleged incident
in the hotel lift.
''She was crying and kept asking why she had been sacked over and over
again.''
The tribunal finished hearing the case, but the panel decided to
withhold its decision. Abbey National and Mrs Gaze will be informed of
the ruling by post.
Mrs Gaze said after the hearing: ''I am now trying to rebuild my life,
but it is very difficult to find a job once you have been sacked.
An Abbey National spokesman said: ''Anita Gaze failed the exams and we
can't allow unqualified people to sell to our customers.
''We categorically deny sexual discrimination or any link with the
alleged conversations with our branch manager Mr David Moseby.''

KENNETH Clarke put his Hush Puppy in it yesterday. He twice praised
Consett as being ''one of the best steelworks in Europe''. It closed 15
years ago with the loss of 3000 jobs.
Telephones at Radio Newcastle went hot with angry callers. The closure
is still a sensitive issue in the North-east.
Listeners' incredulity grew as they heard Mr Clarke state: ''When I
used to come here as a Minister it was still dominated by steel,
shipbuilding, and coal. It was a kind of feeling that they were real
jobs if you got your hands dirty and there was a bit of flame belching
about.
''Actually, at Consett, you have now got one of the best steelworks in
Europe. It doesn't employ as many people as it used to because it is so
modern.''
The site, in fact, is now part large grassy field and part business
park.
On pressed the Chancellor: ''I have talked about the success of
Consett -- British Steel used to be a real liability in this country. It
took a billion pounds' worth of taxpayers' money and lost it each year
until it modernised and now we do produce . . .''
The interviewer interrupted to point out that Consett closed in 1980.
A flustered Mr Clarke responded: ''Sorry -- I have got the wrong one . .
.Redcar . . . thank you for correcting me.
''Redcar is the steelworks which has got the modern steelworks,
Consett the steelworks has closed -- and there's a good alternative
economy in place in Consett which isn't doing too badly.''
The Shadow Industry Secretary, Mr Jack Cunningham, said: ''It beggars
belief that the man who should be in control of Britain's economy isn't
aware that Consett closed in the 1980s as a result of Tory policy. It is
a bitter irony that all those unemployed have to put up with the
complete ignorance of the Chancellor about the impact of his
Government's industrial policies.''

Ian Walls looks at the host of hi-tech growth systems
THE TOMATO has become one of the most popular plants in the
greenhouse, and it is never too early to plan your crop. An important
decision is what cultural system to choose for your tomatoes.
The most basic system uses a greenhouse border, with fairly fresh
soil, which has not grown more than one or two crops of tomatoes.
If it has, sterilise with Jeyes Fluid or Armillatox. Remove any plants
or seedlings first and then give a good soak .
With medium to heavy loam, you need water a border only every few
days. Plant feeding is relatively simple too.
Because things can be tricky if soil gets tomato-sick, many gardeners
prefer the ring system, using a nine-inch ring of degradable paper, with
no bottom.
The ring is filled with John Innes No 2 potting compost, and goes on a
layer of gravel or sand 5-6in deep. Compost should be fresh each year,
to avoid pests or diseases.
Water only in the ring to begin with. As roots develop, soak the
gravel or sand aggregate.
Some say you can stop watering the ring, once roots are well
developed. I do not agree. It is good practice to keep compost well
watered.
Gro-bags or bolsters have become very popular. They have a peat
compost and can take up to three plants. Food in the compost will keep
plants happy for a while. The biggest drawback is a supply of moisture.
This is almost impossible without a trickle irrigation system.
Alternatively, slit the base of the bags and put them on capillary
matting on a layer of polythene.
The only problem is the development of algae. Things can get a bit
messy before the season is over.
A modification is to use growpots, which I tried last year. They have
two concentric rings, the inner one for compost, the outer for watering,
and are inserted into the gro-bags.
I found the holes letting water into the gro-bag itself tended to get
clogged up, but on the whole it worked well. The pots are sturdily made
and will last for years.
You may find it a bit tight to put three of these pots into a gro-bag.
Two might be better. The plants do make vigorous growth.
Other systems include wooden boxes filled with well-rotted manure and
soil from a little used part of the garden. The boxes are stood on
bricks for drainage. Flavour can be superb because plants grow more
naturally.
You can go hydroponic, and grow in nutrient solution. I have tried
that also, and it works. You can get equipment and information from
Glasgrow at 125 Parnie Street, Glasgow. Tel 552 7522.
Another system uses small bales of straw, in a polythene-lined trench
on the greenhouse floor or border. Soak thoroughly and wash in some
nitro-chalk fertiliser to encourage decomposition.
This generates heat and carbon dioxide. Two or three plants go on a
ridge of potting compost. Plants can grow rapidly, but it can be a
problem without some kind of watering system.
If you grow from seed, do so now. I am going for the Shirley variety
again. It gave excellent results last season.

ELGIN police have finally completed their inquiries into the hunt for
Bonnie Prince Charlie.
A warrant for his arrest, the only surviving one in Scotland, had lain
in the archive of the Elgin Museum, Morayshire, for years.
Curators discovered it recently during cataloguing.
However, it was so badly faded in places that museum staff could not
make sense of it. Which is where Elgin police came in. Their forensic
scientists used ultra-violet technology and were able to read the
historic wording.
The writ was issued 250 years ago by George II in an attempt to
apprehend the Young Pretender after the failure of the '45 rebellion. It
offered a #30,000 reward for his capture and instructed that ''wanted''
posters be issued.
The warrant was gifted to the museum by Colonel Stewart of Lesmurdie
in 1860.
Museum curator Jim Inglis said: ''It is a priceless relic. The order
for his arrest would have gone out all over Scotland, but this is the
only one to have survived.''
It will have pride of place in an exhibition, The Jacobites in Moray,
which the museum is holding this summer.

<TEXT>
BARINGS dealer Nick Leeson is expected to spend four months in a
Frankfurt jail while German judges decide whether to extradite him to
Singapore. The Bank of England meanwhile has ordered a global inquiry
into the collapsed bank.
The trader, who ran up losses of more than #600m, said he would fight
extradition when he appeared before an examining magistrate.
He is accused of defrauding and embezzling the bank in Singapore,
which has 40 days to lay further allegations against the 28-year-old and
supply the German courts with corroborating evidence.
In court yesterday, Mr Leeson learned he could face the next four
months in an austere cell, where his comforts are limited to a bed, a
table, a radio, and access to a TV.
He has left behind a luxury apartment, sports cars, and a yacht. He
had built up a fortune estimated at up to #2.5m.
Mr Leeson made it clear during talks with his lawyer that he wanted to
return to London to face justice.
The Serious Fraud Office in London said it was not attempting to have
him extradited to Britain. It also announced an investigation with City
Police into allegations of fraud at the bank's Singapore office.
It was also announced yesterday that Mr Ian Watt, head of the Bank of
England's special investigations unit, is to conduct a global inquiry
into the collapse.
It will cover Barings offices in London, Singapore, Osaka, and Tokyo,
and, ''Where appropriate, it will involve the police,'' according to the
Bank of England.
As the extradition wrangle unfolded, there were calls for Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke to make a fresh Commons statement following reports that
senior managers were warned six months ago of the risk posed by the
trader.
Mr Clarke said the latest claims which appeared in the Financial Times
would be investigated by the Board of Banking Supervision inquiry.
However, the Opposition said the reports called into question his
Commons statement on Monday when he said the cause of the collapse
appeared to be an incident centred on ''one rogue trader''.
Labour's City spokesman, Edinburgh MP Alistair Darling, seized on an
admission by the Chancellor on the radio that he had avoided giving any
real details about the affair.
''He must now tell the House why not and whether he knew that Barings
auditors had warned of serious problems last August when he made his
statement on Monday,'' Mr Darling said. ''It would now appear that, far
from building up quickly without the knowledge of the company, the
crucial facts were brought to their attention last year.''
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, Mr Malcolm Bruce, was more blunt.
''It is now clear that the Chancellor's statement on Barings, suggesting
that unauthorised positions were built up in a few days just prior to
the Bank's collapse, was completely inaccurate.''
According to the Financial Times, internal auditors produced a 24-page
report warning there was a ''significant general risk'' that Mr Leeson
could override the banks controls. ''That is exactly what I expect the
Board of Banking Supervision to investigate and no doubt they are
beginning to do so,'' Mr Clarke told the BBC Radio 4's World at One.
He strongly defended his statement to the Commons made in an effort to
calm the markets rocked by immediate aftershock of the collapse.
Last night, as Mr Leeson settled into Hoechst Prison, his German
lawyer Eberhard Kempf said he has ''problems to cope with, but he is
determined to come through it.'' He said Mr Leeson was determined to
fight every step of the way to avoid going back to Singapore, where he
could face up to seven years on each fraud charge.
He said it was only because the first available flight from Brunei to
London was full that his client took the next flight to anywhere in
Europe -- Frankfurt, where he and his wife Lisa, 23, were detained by
police.
Singapore sent three officers from the Commercial Affairs Department
-- the equivalent of the Serious Fraud Office -- to Frankfurt yesterday
with a warrant alleging he had forged documents in order to defraud and
embezzle his employer.
Mr Kempf said he would be raising concerns over Singapore's legal
system, harsh punishments and human rights record in the fight against
extradition, and hinted that Mr Leeson's defence could drag others into
the frame. ''He is not prepared to name names yet,'' he said, adding:
''I assume he has information which could damage other people at
Barings.''

HIGHLAND Health Board have unveiled a new concept in the treatment of
patients.
It is hoped that Telemedicine will revolutionise medical consultation
for patients in the more rural areas.
The project involves a live television link-up between specialists in
Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and remote rural communities.
It has been piloted with a link to Portree on Skye, 120 miles away.
Initially, the focus has been mainly on dermatology.
However, the pilot scheme is now reaching its conclusion and initial
findings suggest it has been a remarkable success.
The health board's service standards manager, Mr Derek Leslie,
yesterday stressed the collaborative nature of the project.
He said: ''Not only is this a good practical use of technology which
enables people in rural Highland areas to access specialist services, it
is also a product of teamwork between GPs, hospital doctors, the health
board, and the trusts involved.
''Everyone has been working with one aim in mind -- to explore the
potential use of modern and available technology in order to deliver
services to people, irrespective of where they live.''
Mr Colin Shields, divisional general manager for the Highland
Communities NHS Trust, under whose local management the Telemedicine
scheme has been developed, agreed.
He said yesterday: ''I am extremely pleased that the people of the
area can benefit from this new concept in patient care.
''It is a fine example of local care for local people.''

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson last night claimed that
Tory scaremongering over the cost and consequences of devolution
amounted to ''hype and bluster'' which had failed to fool the people.
''We are on the brink of a real revolution in the way our nation's
affairs are run,'' he told a meeting of the John Wheatley Centre, in
Edinburgh, a Labour think-tank looking at policy areas for a future
Scottish parliament.
Mr Robertson was moving to seize back the initiative in a debate on
Home Rule which has been dominated lately by Conservative predictions of
the dire consequences of constitutional change.
''We have had nightmares about #6 a week on average tax bills, we had
19p extra on the Scottish standard rate of tax, parliamentary
representation slashed, the public expenditure formulae scrapped,'' he
said.
''The electors can see through hype and bluster and cynical
over-statement and they resent the insult to their intelligence.
''The smears have been answered, the scares allayed, the inventions
corrected, and the horror stories denied.''
Mr Robertson said that instead of being panicked, people had been
intrigued; in place of horror there was fascination, and instead of
boredom there was a realisation that democracy and decision-making could
be improved.
Referring to the Framework Document, he said: ''Northern Ireland is
different -- with different traditions, politics, religions, and
neighbours -- and the case for a Scottish parliament stands on its own.
''But Scotland is different too and the case for a devolved parliament
is surely all the stronger where people have voted for it, have the
institutions to implement it, and the thirst to make it work.''
In spite of predictions that Labour would be squeezed out in a
straight two-way contest in the forthcoming by-election, Mr Robertson
pledged: ''We will fight Perth and Kinross tooth-and-nail every inch of
the way. With the Tories and Nationalists now in disarray, nothing
should be taken for granted.''
He claimed the Conservatives were ''favouring, flattering, and egging
on the separatists in a high-wire act to polarise the debate.''
He also continued a recent Labour theme of wooing the private sector
when he said: ''We have sought to lay to rest some of the ghosts seen by
the Scottish financial community whose contribution to the Scottish
economy and labour market is immense.
''They have been reassured that there will be no scope to alter the
framework of financial or banking regulation and that corporate taxation
will not be a devolved power. The British level playing field is
protected.''
He suggested that, as in the autonomous Spanish region of Catalonia,
the Scottish financial and business community could end up being
''bitten by the devolution bug''.
He added: ''In tourism, devolution will give to the Scottish hotels,
restaurants, and leisure industry a much better chance of being marketed
without the stifling effect of some Whitehall department and Ministers
who rotate so quickly they cannot even be recalled.''
Universities, housing, training, and the health service could all
benefit from the new atmosphere of devolution, he argued.
Mr Robertson declared: ''The fact is that our plan for Scotland is
simultaneously revolutionary and commonplace. It is a radical change but
also a sensible, moderate reform.
''It will change dramatically the way the country is run, it will stop
separatism in its tracks, and it will inspire decentralist desires all
over the country.''

AN agent for sports personalities was jailed for seven years yesterday
for masterminding a plot to defraud #4m from banks and building
societies.
Judge Derek Clarkson, QC, at Middlesex Guildhall Crown Court handed
down the sentence after finding 40-year-old Ambrose Mendy guilty of
trying to defraud City banks using forged or stolen documents between
July 1 and August 13, 1993.
Mendy, of 42 Draycott Road, Wanstead, east London, had called
celebrity friends and sportsmen to the court in his defence during the
six-week trial. They included former boxer, Mr Michael Watson, and
Britain's only black showjumper, Mr Oliver Skeet.
Mr Peter Carter, prosecuting, said Mendy and his two co-accused stole
company documents including cheques and headed notepaper to try to
persuade banks to transfer cash into their own accounts.
If they had been successful, they would have netted #4m, but the plot
had brought in only #46,000 when police raided a London hotel room and
found Mendy surrounded by stolen documents.
Also convicted were Edmund Hannibal Parkinson, 45, unemployed, of
Croft Down Road, Kentish Town, north London, and Michael Lancelot
Marsden, 40, a self-employed financial consultant of Park Road, Barking,
east London.
Mendy and Parkinson, who are brothers-in-law, were also found guilty
of conspiring to defraud City banks between August 1 and 28, 1993, by
the same means.
Two other charges of conspiring to defraud, against Mendy and
Parkinson, were left on the file.
The judge jailed Parkinson for two-and-a-half years and Marsden for a
year.
Earlier, Mendy's defence counsel David Nathan told the judge: ''He has
two different personas -- a public figure who enjoyed a reputation in
the past for many things of excellence, the other side of Mr Mendy is
Mendy the criminal.''
After Mendy was convicted, the court was told of his criminal record
dating back to 1978.
Among previous convictions were 10 counts of burglary, eight of
forgery, and one of obtaining property by deception. In 1991, he
received 30 months in prison for a #472,000 fraud conspiracy.
