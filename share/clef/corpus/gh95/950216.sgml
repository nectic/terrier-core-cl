DUMFRIES racing driving Allan McNish is preparing to mount an
all-Scots challenge on the on the European Formula 3000 title this year.
McNish has signed for the Paul Stewart Racing team, based at Milton
Keynes after a couple of disappointing years.
He has just returned from Paris where he was at the launch of the new
Lola Formula One challenger which is set to compete in the 1996 season.
''I am hoping to continue my testing with Lola this year,'' he said,
''but my commitment with Paul Stewart takes priority.''
Allan, who had a meteoric rise through the ranks to Formula 3000,
spent much of last year on the sidelines because of lack of sponsorship.
But he drove for Benetton Ford and then signed up as a test driver
with Lola. ''I will be hoping to get a drive with them next year,'' he
said, ''and the more experience I have the better.
''This step with Paul Stewart is purely and simply to put me on the
track for F1. With Paul and Jackie behind me it will be made a little
bit easier but nothing is certain in racing.''
Paul Stewart is still waiting to win the European Formula 3000
championship and McNish said: ''Hopefully I can help them to achieve it
this year.''
McNish did two years in Formula 3000 in 1990, and alsom the following
year, as well as part of 1992. In 1990 he won several races and finished
fourth overall but there were problems. ''Hopefully that is all behind
me.
''The cars this year are expected to be powered by Reynard units,''
said McNish who won the British Vauxhall Lotus Challenge and became the
youngest driver ever to compete in F3000 when he made his debut at
Dijon.

THE ice rink at Kilmarnock's Galleon Centre hosts its second major
tournament of the season when play starts today in the Royal Bank of
Scotland Scottish women's championships.
Kirsty Hay, the former world junior champion, and her team of Edith
Loudon, Joanna Pegg, and Katy Loudon look to be the favourites.
Successes for this line up so far this season include victory in the
European qualifying event, which gained them the right to represent
Scotland at the European championships last December.
Their hopes of victory could also be enhanced by the withdrawal of
Jackie Lockhart, who, in the middle of a pregnancy, has decided not to
play. Debbie Knox will take over the role of skip for this team and
Julia Ewart, last weekend's winner of the Scottish junior title, has
been drafted in to play at No.3.
Christine Cannon, the current title holder, retired after last year's
world championships final, but her term have reformed under Claire
Milne, who played at No.3 last season, and they go on to the ice this
weekend eager to prove that their new formation is competitive at the
top level.

THE North of Scotland Open squash tournament in Aberdeen next weekend
offers Helen Macfie a one-off chance to retain her place in the Scottish
team for the European championships in Amsterdam in April.
And she's determined to take it.
Hampered by a back injury, the 23-year-old former English junior cap
had a disappointing Scottish debut at the World championships in
Guernsey last October, and the same problem forced her to pull out of
this season's Scottish event.
''I had to take a couple of months out, and it's been really
frustrating,'' said the London-based player. ''But I'm now fully fit,
and I hope that I can show people in Scotland my true form in
Aberdeen.''
It was the decision to switch to Scotland last season -- she and
sister Senga qualify as their parents come from Edinburgh -- that
rekindled Helen's career.
''I gave up for 18 months after a disastrous trip to Asia and
Australia that was ruined by illness,'' she explained. ''It was a
terrific incentive to try to get into the Scottish team, and I'm just
disappointed that the injury has halted further progress.''
In Aberdeen, Helen is seeded 3/4 with Wendy Maitland. The top two are
Senga Macfie and Scottish champion, Claire Waddell.
Following her injury problems, Helen has no chance of claiming one of
the two automatic selection spots from the Scottish Grand Prix ranking
list, but a good performance in the North could secure one of team
manager Derek Davidson's two wild cards.
Another long-time absentee, Julie Nicol, could also return to the
international reckoning if she produces the goods on her home Aberdeen
courts.
Sidelined for more than two years with an allergy complaint, the
sister of world No.5. Peter Nicol faces an intriguing first round tie
against Wendy Maitland.
In the men's championship, world No.9 Del Harris is seeded just ahead
of England international colleague Tony Hands. Oban's Martin Heath is at
No.3.

THURSDAY, March 2, at 2.30pm, is a date and time every contractor
engaged in streetworks should take note of.
It is the official launch in Strathclyde at the Stakis Glasgow Airport
Hotel (formerly the Normandy), Inchinnan Road, Renfrew, of the
Susiephone single call method of avoiding dangerous or costly mistakes
when starting excavation work.
Invitations have gone out to 1200 companies, large and small, all of
whom will be fully briefed on how to use the system to help them avoid
damaging public utilities and perhaps causing costly delays to important
contracts.
''Part of the Susiephone system -- the one of most interest to
contractors -- is the Dial-Before-You-Dig one call service,'' said
Janette Gray, Susiephone information officer, West of Scotland.
''Prior to Susiephone, each contractor had to contact the various
utilities, or statutory undertakers, as they are now known. This could
have meant up to seven or eight calls being made, with the usual
frustrations attached to locating the correct office charged with
providing information on the specific location of the work.
''It was a time-consuming business and occasionally there was a
temptation to press on with the work before all of the necessary
information had been gathered -- often with the predictable result.''
Since the New Roads Work Act of 1991 came into force, plans must be on
site before any excavation commences. The introduction of the Susiephone
system has neatly eliminated any of the problems adherence to the
conditions of the Act could have created.
Simply dial the one-call centre and provide the operator with details
of the intended dig, its exact location and the date on which work is
due to start. The information is fed into a computer and forwarded to
the utilities involved, who in turn will provide the caller with the
information required. This generally takes no more than 48 hours.
The system was originally introduced in Lothian Region, funding being
provided by the National Joint Utilities Group, but it has since been
redeveloped and extended to meet the requirements of the 1991 Act.
Development work was undertaken on behalf of a consortium of
utilities, including British Gas (Scotland) Ltd, BT, ScottishPower,
Mercury Communications, United Artists and CableTel, together with the
roads, sewerage and water departments of Lothian and Strathclyde
Regional Councils.
''Scotland is ahead of the rest of the United Kingdom in complying
with the new Act,'' said Mr Iain Hamilton, chief engineer (operations)
responsible for roads maintenance in Strathclyde Regional Council.
''Susiephone is the only operational computer system which meets its
requirements and, by having a different form available on the computer
screen for each type of message, the system is easy to use and provides
the information to everyone in a uniform style.''
The service is totally funded by the statutory undertakers and
regional councils mentioned earlier. There is no cost at all to
contractors. Even making that single call is on a Freephone line.
Fast as the current response time is, it promises to become even more
efficient in future. Some utilities keep records on microfiche, others
use paper plans, but all of the information has to be updated
constantly, a time-consuming and expensive process.
Hence the pledge by all of the utilities to invest in a totally
computer-based system using graphical information systems.
Quite a commitment. ScottishPower, for example, is preparing to scan
all of its 1:500 maps of the South of Scotland into a GIS, creating a
seamless map on computer.
Finding the relevant section is done by using a gazetteer.
Type in the name of the street and a map of the area appears on
screen.
Ordnance Survey map co-ordinates can also be used. If these are
available for a site the street name can be dispensed with.
It is a simple matter of typing in the references and up pops the map.
The computer has a zoom-in facility and print-outs can be provided at
the touch of a button.
The system has been proved at Lothian Water and Drainage. Its GIS
system allows operators to call up maps on screen which show much more
than where pipes are situated under the ground. They also provide
details such as the size and depth of pipes, manhole dimensions and
precise details of all sewerage systems in Edinburgh.
Today's Susiephone facility is designed for excavation work due to
start within a fortnight. Contractors are asked to give the Susiephone
team at least five clear working days' notice to allow for the gathering
of information.
And it should be stressed that it is for the exclusive use of
contractors at present, rather than architects, developers and planners
whose excavation work is usually part of a medium to long-term project
which usually allows for information to be gathered through the usual
channels.
At the launch, contractors will be provided with a briefing on the New
Roads and Street Works Act of 1991, information on how Susiephone can
work to their advantage, be provided with answers to any questions by
the information officer, and view a video entitled ''Safe Digging With
Susiephone''.
Can you afford to miss it?
Since the New Roads Work Act of 1991 came into force, plans must be on
site before any excavation commences.

FRAUD costs business. Large frauds in the South tend to grab the
headlines but there is a worrying trend in the growth of smaller frauds
against business.
Unfortunately, the lessons which smaller companies can draw from major
frauds is not given wide publicity and therefore the attitude often is:
''It couldn't happen to us.'' However there are core risks in all
businesses and fraud prevention is as vital in small as in large
organisations.
In 1994 KPMG's fraud barometer showed reported fraud in Scotland
(where charges have been brought) amounted to #7.7 million of which #2.6
million (34%) was lost by Scottish businesses in just 18 cases. This
category was second only to losses by the public as a result of fraud
and theft by professional advisers.

HAVING gone from Dubai to the Philippines, to Madeira then the Canary
Islands, the European PGA Tour reaches out to South Africa this week --
a move somewhat akin to Rangers playing Grampus Eight of Tokyo in the
European Champions' Cup.
The Lexington South African PGA Championship at Johannesburg Wanderers
club is the first joint venture between the PGA European Tour and the
PGA of South Africa.
Stretching back to the days of Bobby Locke and Gary Player, there have
always been strong ties between Southern Africa and Europe, the UK in
particular, and of course the current Open champion, Nick Price, cut his
teeth among herds of Springbok golfers including defending champion
David Frost.
With what, in modern terms, is a modest prize fund of only #250,000,
with #41,660 going to the winner, the great majority of Europe's
superstars appear to have found something better to do this week than
face the 11-hour flight across the Equator.
Ryder Cup points leader Seve Ballesteros will be an absentee this
morning, as will nearest challengers Bernhard Langer, Colin Montgomerie,
US Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal (recovering from a foot
operation), Ian Woosnam, and David Gilford.
Even intrepid globetrotter Sam Torrance, that avid gatherer of Ryder
Cup points and entry stamps on his passport, and who spends so much time
in airports, he buys his shoes in duty-free shops, is staying at home in
Wentworth.
The list of names who will not answer the roll call would seem to
indicate juicy pickings for the 70 or so European Tour players who have
made the long trip, including Scottish champion Andrew Coltart and
countrymen Dean Robertson, Brian Marchbank, Craig Ronald, William Guy,
Raymond Russell, and Scott Henderson.
However, all is not as it might seem.Heading the line-up of formidable
favourites for Sunday's first prize is local hero Ernie Els.
US Open champion is but one of the titles currently held by the
talented Els. Others include the Sarazen World Open and the Toyota World
Match Play. The fact that he won the Lexington SA PGA title three years
ago is testimony to his ability to handle the rolling course.
Among others challenging Els for his second SA PGA are tournament
record-holder Frost, winner of $4.5m since he took his abundant talents
on to the US Tour, and Fiji's remarkable Vijay Singh, who soared over
the $1m mark by winning the Phoenix Open three weeks ago.
Vijay is using this week as a warm-up for the Southern Hemisphere's
version of the Ryder Cup in South Africa next week-end. The man who was
once a bouncer in a Scottish night club is a member of Greg Norman's
Australasian team to meet a Southern Africa squad, captained by Gary
Player, which will include both Els and Price.

John Cooney reports on Dublin's hope that by amending its
constitutional claim to the north, Ulster Unionists can be persuaded to
come to the negotiating table
A KEY section of the framework document for a political settlement in
Ulster is a commitment by the Irish Government to hold a referendum to
end its territorial claim over Northern Ireland, according to diplomatic
sources in Dublin.
The Irish Government has agreed to modify articles two and three of
the Republic's constitution, which are regarded by Ulster Unionists as
an imperialist claim but which are cherished by nationalists as a solemn
expression of their goal of a united Ireland.
The constitution, enacted in 1937, was the brain-child of Eamon de
Valera, the leader of the main political party, Fianna Fail. These two
articles express in legal form the traditional nationalist case for
political union.
Article two defines ''the nationalist territory'' as consisting of the
whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas. Article
three suspends the enforcement in the north of laws passed by the Dail
(parliament) pending the reintegration of the national territory.
But attempts by Britain to persuade the Republic to delete these two
articles completely from the constitution have met with limited success.
The Irish have refused to do so on the grounds that this would be seen
by the minority nationalist community in the six counties as an
abandonment of their right to be Irish, and it would allow the IRA to
claim that they alone champion the unification of the island.
A compromise has been reached between the British and Irish which will
result in a new phrase being added to article two which will describe
the island as a shared inheritance of all the people living there. The
net effect of this addition should be to put the emphasis on the people
of the island rather than territory as a badge of nationality.
In a similar spirit, article three will be rewritten to guarantee
Westminster and the Ulster Unionists that the status of Northern Ireland
within the United Kingdom will not change until a majority there want a
united Ireland.
The combined effect of these two proposed changes should be to remove
Unionists' fears that these two articles amount to ''a claim'' on
Northern Ireland, high level Government sources in Dublin told The
Herald yesterday.
In spite of the continued hostility of Unionists to this formula,
Prime Minister John Major is prepared to accept Dublin's assurances that
it will renounce its ''claim''. In effect, Dublin will ask the
Republic's electorate to incorporate into its constitution the notion of
majority consent for any change in the status of Northern Ireland.
The broad thrust of these modifications had been agreed by Albert
Reynolds, the former Irish Prime Minister and co-architect with John
Major of the peace initiative. As Mr Reynolds was the leader of Fianna
Fail, his successor as Prime Minister, John Bruton, has stuck to this
wording.
In return, Britain will undertake to repeal or amend an obscure and
forgotten part of the 1920 Government of Ireland Act -- which
underpinned the partition of the island. Section 75 of this Act states
that the ''supreme authority'' of the Westminster Parliament shall
remain unaffected and undiminished over all persons and things in
Ireland ''and every part thereof''.
In the eyes of Irish republicans, this section is a much more
categorical claim than irredentist clauses of articles two and three of
the constitution.
Mr Bruton's calculation is that this deal will win the support of the
new Fianna Fail leader, Bertie Ahern. In the Dail yesterday Mr Bruton
announced that he will give Mr Ahern a confidential briefing on the
framework document on Friday, a sign that all-party unity in Dublin will
match the Mayhew-Blair co-operation at Westminster.
Speculation that Mr Ahern is ready to attack any alterations in
articles two and three have been vigorously denied by the Fianna Fail
leader. He knows that the document was largely shaped by Albert Reynolds
before his resignation last November. Mr Ahern wants to claim a share of
the credit for its formulation.
The backing of Fianna Fail, which commands about 46% support among
voters, will be crucial to the success of a referendum south of the
Irish border. Another important factor for Mr Bruton, whose Fine Gael
party forms a coalition with Labour and Democratic Left, is that Sinn
Fein is likely to be influenced by Fianna Fail.
If keeping Fianna Fail sweet is a domestic priority for Mr Bruton,
convincing the Unionists that the framework document is not a
nationalist agenda is the precondition of all-round constitutional talks
getting under way.
Yesterday Mr Bruton claimed that there is nothing for anyone to fear
in the document, which is ''a fair and balanced'' basis for discussion,
not a blueprint.
Senior officials in Dublin do not underestimate the strength of
opposition from Unionists to proposed cross-border bodies with executive
functions on matters such as agriculture, tourism, trade and the
environment. But these officials hope that Unionists will accept that
these bodies do not amount to an All-Ireland authority. Their operations
will not take sovereignty away from Britain.
Such bodies will be subject to the control of the Dail and a devolved
parliament in Belfast, the details of which are to be proposed by Mr
Major in an internal proposal that will be launched simultaneously with
the joint framework document.
The way is now clear for these two long-awaited documents to be
unveiled by Mr Major and Mr Bruton at a summit within 10 days. The venue
is likely to be Belfast, a sign that the two Governments want to call
the Unionists' bluff.
However, without Unionist involvement in round-table talks, the
framework document will remain unimplemented. London and Dublin will
have the difficult task of persuading the Unionists to come to the
negotiating table.

BATTLE FOR PEACE
In this extract from his Mountbatten Lecture at Edinburgh University
last night, Paul Wilkinson argues that in normal circumstances the
appropriate agency for dealing with terrorist crime is the police. In
the Northern Ireland emergency the Army has played a vital role in
support of the RUC, preventing a full-scale civil war and buying time
for a political settlement
IN AN operative liberal democratic state the obvious framework for
tackling terrorist crimes of violence is the criminal justice system.
The prime agency for preventing and detecting crimes of terrorism, and
for tracking down terrorists and bringing them to trial, is the civil
police. This is the model adopted in all the EU democracies, the US,
Canada and Australia. In all these cases the use of the military to
replace or augment the police role in internal security against
terrorism would be regarded as exceptional. Indeed it was viewed as
exceptional in August 1969 in Northern Ireland, when public order was
breaking down, and the RUC was demonstrably unable to cope, and the then
Labour Government decided to send in troops to help restore public
order.
In more normal situations the police have enormous advantages over the
military in handling terrorism and other forms of civil violence. They
have the great advantage of legitimacy and accountability in the eyes of
the majority of the civilian population. The local police have the
enormous asset of close knowledge of local conditions and members of the
local communities.
There are very strong reasons why government of liberal states should
only employ troops for internal security purposes with the very greatest
reluctance, and why they should seek to withdraw them at the earliest
opportunity.
First, in any conflict of this scale it may be assumed that the
belligerent faction or factions enjoy at least some support or sympathy
in sections of the general population. Hence an unnecessarily high
military profile may merely serve to escalate the level of violence by
polarising pro and anti-government elements in the community.
Second, internal security duties under the strict limits imposed in a
constitutionalist liberal democratic system conflict fundamentally in
many respects with the professional instincts, traditions and ethos of
the military. The soldier's main task is seen as the identification and
destruction of the enemy. In internal security duties it is often
extremely difficult to know who or where the enemy are, for friends and
enemies all look the same. Moreover, according to the constabulary
ethic, the prime objective is not to kill lawbreakers, but to apprehend
and secure their conviction before a court of law. There is a constant
risk that a repressive over-reaction or an error of judgment by the
military may trigger further civil violence. Internal security duties
inevitably impose considerable strain on the soldiers who are made well
aware of the hostility of certain sections of the community towards
them.
In addition to providing a ''last line of defence'' to take over
internal law and order enforcement from a police force that has been
overwhelmed or gravely weakened, the armed forces can contribute the
firepower, force projection capability and expertise, such as
hostage-rescue commandos, sophisticated bomb disposal teams, and
specialist marksmen which the civilian police is unable to provide. To
be truly successful in these internal security roles, military personnel
must have a good understanding of the civilian and democratic ethos.
There is already joint training of senior police and Army officers at
Camberley. More joint training, exercises, and operations would deepen
and extend this key area of co-operation. Contrary to popular opinion it
requires considerable time and effort to achieve this. Police and Army
are very different organisations with different attitudes. However, as
the Army has become more and more involved in peacetime tasks, the need
for closer co-ordination and mutual understanding has become ever
greater.
In the climate of greater optimism engendered by Sunningdale, and with
the phasing-out of internment, the emphasis of British security policy
underwent a significant shift. The decision was made that the Royal
Ulster Constabulary should be reformed, strengthened and expanded so
that it could become a thoroughly professional and impartial police
force accepted by the law-abiding of both Protestant and Catholic
communities and capable, in due course, of taking the major burden
against terrorism.
By the early 1980s they were able to patrol in all the major urban
areas. The so called ''bandit country'' of the rural border areas were
the only districts where the British Army, with its greater firepower
and mobility, of necessity, took the major role.
The prolonged deployment in support of the police against terrorism
has imposed particular strains on the young and relatively inexperienced
soldiers on the front line. This is dramatically illustrated by the
controversy over the Yellow Card, which lays down circumstances when a
soldier can open fire. There has recently been a heated debate in the
press regarding the case of Private Clegg, tried and convicted for the
murder of a girl passenger in a joyriders' car, and two Scots Guardsmen
also convicted of murdering a civilian.
Walking the tightrope between under-reaction and over-reaction in the
face of a brutal terrorist campaign, often targeted on the security
forces, is bound to lead to tragedies of killings of innocent
individuals by police and Army, however carefully the Yellow Card
instructions are drafted. But the Army and police cannot be exempt from
legal accountability and judicial procedures. The important thing is to
try to ensure that the law is fair, sensible and workable.
But the central point I wish to make is this: tragic killing of
civilians and acts of misconduct by a small number of serving soldiers
should not blind us to the fact that the British Army, UDR, the RUC and
the RUC reservists, who together lost almost 700 lives in the 25 years
of terrorism, gained a colossal achievement in preventing the conflict
from escalating to civil war level, and in buying time for the
politicans to get their act together and win the battle for peace. This
is a truly heroic record, and it should be fully recognised as such both
by the British public and internationally.
The challenge of finding a political formula acceptable to both the
Unionist political parties and Sinn Fein/IRA is daunting: their public
positions are as far apart as ever. Understandably, and rightly so in my
view, the Unionist majority are not prepared to settle for peace at any
price. Simply allowing IRA/Sinn Fein to win by propaganda and blackmail
what they could not achieve by the bomb and the gun would be a
disastrous act of appeasement, and a betrayal both of our fellow
citizens in the Province and the hundreds who have died in defence of
democracy and the Rule of Law.
Nor should we forget that the security and political aspects of peace
in Northern Ireland are interdependent; if the British Government fails
in its efforts to ensure a programme of decommissioning terrorist
weapons, including Semtex, the IRA will be able to use repeated threats
of a return to their terrorist campaign as a means of intimidating both
governments and political parties. And reductions in the resources and
readiness of the security forces in the Province would not only be
premature, they would be the height of folly in the light of the danger
of the IRA, or a Republican hard-line breakaway group, or the Loyalist
terrorists, reverting to the bomb and the gun.
Continuing security vigilance at this delicate period is an absolute
prerequisite for ensuring an honourable peace and avoiding a disastrous
collapse of order and a slide into a wider civil war.

THE only statistic in the Scotch whisky industry which is going up is
the amount of duty charged by the Government. Global whisky consumption
has been virtually flat for the past 15 years, and prices have been
forced down as companies fight for a bigger market share. Consumers have
also been trading down -- buying supermarket own-label brands which can
be up to #4 cheaper per bottle than a leading brand name.
Burn Stewart Distillers are the second largest suppliers of own label
whisky but Bill Thornton executive chairman of the company believes that
the price of whisky has been depressed not by the appearance of value
for money brands but by companies unloading surplus whisky stocks at low
prices on to the market.
This argument is backed up by a recent report on the whisky industry
compiled by the US investment bank Morgan Stanley who stated: ''Price
cutting may have been catalysed by recession and excess stocks but we
believe that these price cuts have in all cases been driven by one or
more companies seeking to increase their market share within an
oligopolistic market structure.
''Companies have found it necessary to cut prices to gain market share
because in most cases, branded product volume sales have stagnated, even
in many of the so-called developing markets.
''The overall world market has been flat for 15 years,'' says Bill
Thornton, ''because the growth in markets such as Europe has not
compensated fully for the decline in the USA and UK markets.''
The industry has high hopes for global expansion in emerging markets
such as India, China, and South America as well as in Russia and the
former Eastern block states, but as yet sales have failed to take off in
these countries.
At home the own label sector now accounts for 30 per cent of off sales
market, and there are indications that this sector is also growing in
some export markets such as Germany, France and South Africa.
Burn Stewart Distillers can have no complaint about this trend. Since
Bill Thornton led a management buy out of the company in 1988 when its
major business was the export of bulk blends to Europe he has managed to
switch the whisky company's emphasis to the ''Bottled in Scotland'' end
of the market.
''In 1988 we sold around 100,000 bottles a year compared to the 1.5
million we now sell, around 70 per cent of which are exported,'' says Mr
Thornton.
The new business philosophy has obviously paid off as the company now
own two malt distilleries, Deanston and Tobermory, and having paid #7
million in the buy out, it has become a public company with a current
market value of around #70 million.
However Bill Thornton believes that distillers must make a determined
effort to raise the price of whisky in order to restore margins which
have been whittled away in recent years.
The Morgan Stanley report casts doubts on the industry's ability to
increase the price they receive for their product saying: ''We cannot
see why the retailers would not wish to use any price increases to
supplement their own margin.''
Analyst Charles Winston of Morgan Stanley points out that the major
supermarkets have 54 per cent of the off license trade and he says:
''They have not had to fight for their discounts, they have been given
them on a plate.''
But Bill Thornton believes that, ''there is a more general awareness
in the industry for the need of a sensible pricing policy''.
Morgan Stanley also casts doubts on this scenario as they point out
that, ''the average capacity utilisation currently stands at around
55-60 per cent at the most''. And whenever Scotch whisky sales volumes
look as though they are on a rising trend, there are enough marginal
players in the industry who will step up production of stock to hold for
three or five years and then sell to retailers and other suppliers of
the cheaper VFM (Value for Money) Scotch.''
It is perhaps with this danger in mind that Bill Thornton speculates
on how Burn Stewart will grow in future.
''We will need to look at ways to develop our business,'' he says.
''Organic growth will not be enough but at the end of the day there has
to be a sizeable Scottish-based company capable of competing with the
big boys.''
He believes that Scottish-based producers have to get together to form
such an ''organisation'' saying ''the business is too fragmented at the
bottom end,'' although he also maintains there will always be some
smaller companies around as ''anyone with a bit of money can be in the
Scotch whisky industry''.
The price of whisky, however, is not depressed everywhere in the
world. Bill Thornton points out that Burn Stewart Distillers are selling
their 25-year-old Scottish Leader blend for 400 dollars a bottle in
Taiwan, and are in the process of setting up an office there on the
basis of this success.

DRAKEMIRE Dairy, Hamilton, which currently processes 21 million litres
of milk a year, has set itself the target of becoming the Scottish
powerhouse for long-life UHT milk.
With a #250,000 investment in new plant, financed by the Clydesdale
Bank, it is well on the way to achieving that ambition. It is also into
long-life full-cream milk and the provision of individual catering packs
for airlines and hotels.
This specialisation is part of a strategy designed to keep Drakemire
in the forefront of its chosen sector of the milk market. The dairy is a
partnership headed by brothers Douglas and John Edmunds and
brother-in-law Kevin Connelly, who is production manager.
Drakemire describes itself as the fifth largest dairy in Scotland. In
a very competitive business it has decided to try to avoid a
head-to-head clash with the big boys of the trade such as Wisemans or
Hamiltons Dairies.
Instead, it operates as an integrated creamery, making a variety of
products under one roof, including butter and yoghurt as well as skimmed
milk, whole milk and its long-life specialities.
''What we have decided to do is to sell milk in its constituent
parts,'' said Douglas Edmunds. That includes churning out -- literally
-- 12 tonnes of butter every week. Its production method is based on a
modern-day version of the old farmhouse churn and the product, it has
been told, is of gold-star standard. Drakemire butter sells through
supermarkets and corner shops and is also supplied in bulk to some of
Scotland's leading bakery factories.
The doorstep market for the daily pinta is on the decline, said
Douglas Edmunds, and the firm does not compete on that front. It still
has a significant corner-shop trade both for milk and butter. It is the
long-life product that is its hope for the future, however, with the
Kwiksave supermarket chain as a main customer on a UK-wide basis.
Drakemire, which started from milk rounds built up in Castlemilk by
Douglas and John's father, is a major customer of Scottish Milk. It was
one of those who opted to go for a long-term contract although it sees
the new system of selling milk as one intended to suit the farmers
rather than the processors.
''Nobody on the trade side likes this new system,''said Douglas
Edmunds. ''On the one hand you cannot just phone up and ask for 10
tanker loads of milk. But if you lose a customer and don't need all the
milk you are contracted for you are in trouble.''
Looking to the future, he sees his company increasingly going for
value-added products such as the long-life milks or ice-cream mixes. One
thing he will be steering clear of is cheese, because ''it ties up too
much capital''.

THE jobless total in Scotland has fallen to its lowest level in almost
four years and by about 40,000 since the last peak just over two years
ago, according to Government figures released yesterday.
The seasonally-adjusted number in January fell by 2400 to 209,800, the
lowest level since February, 1991, when 206,300 were registered as out
of work.
Last month's total, 8.4% of the workforce, also shows that the total
of unemployed has continued to fall since the last peak of 249,600 in
December, 1992.
In the United Kingdom as a whole, unemployment fell for a twelfth
consecutive month to a three-year low of 2,389,700.
The seasonally adjusted total, the best long-term guide, dropped by
27,500, leaving a jobless rate of 8.5%.
The figures mean that the jobless total throughout Britain is 582,000
down on its peak of just uner three million, also in December 1992, and
that the unemployment rate is now below the European average.
It is lower than Spain, Ireland, France, Italy, Belgium, Holland,
Canada, and Australia, but still higher than Sweden, Germany, the US,
and Japan.
The crude unadjusted unemployment total increased by 86,307 to
2,503,353 in Britain and by 11,129 to 223,732 in Scotland; but this is
in line with the usual trend of seasonal fluctuations recorded each
January.
The adjusted figures were greeted with delight by the Government,
which claimed the picture of widespread recovery in the labour market
reflected the ''sound basis'' of Britain's economic growth.
Employment Secretary Michael Portillo said he was particularly pleased
that the number of people out of work for longer than a year had fallen
by 154,800 during the past 12 months.
''That represents a third of the total fall in unemployment over the
past year, and is evidence that the proactive role we have been playing
to help the long-term unemployed has been effective.''
The TUC was predictably less positive, claiming a range of indicators
suggested the labour market is slowing down.
General Secretary John Monks said: ''There are fewer vacancies, fewer
people moving off the register, and an increase in the share of
long-term unemployed compared to a year ago.
''These are not the signs of a sustained recovery. The figures suggest
the labour market is slowing down.''
Commenting on the Scottish figures, Mr George Kynoch, who succeeded Mr
Allan Stewart as Scottish Office Industry Minister after he resigned
last week, said he was pleased that the downward trend had continued,
adding that the figures provided a very encouraging start to 1995.
The figures were also welcomed by the CBI in Scotland.
However, its director, Mr Lex Gold, sounded a note of caution and
echoed Mr Monks's comments, by saying: ''The concern must be that the
rate of decline in unemployment may now be slowing.''
Mr Gold said the average drop in Scottish unemployment during the past
six months had been 3700 against 2400 last month.
Opposition parties and the STUC were more critical, repeating claims
that the figures did not reflect properly the number of people without
work.
SNP employment spokesperson Ms Nicola Sturgeon said: ''Following the
recent announcement of job losses at ICI in Ayrshire and Rolls-Royce in
East Kilbride, the Government cannot hope to appease Scots with these
doubtful figures.''
The leader of the Scottish Liberal democrats, Mr Jim Wallace, welcomed
the continued decline in unemployment, but said: ''Unfortunately, there
is little evidence of high skill jobs coming to Scotland in abdundance,
though we are all too conscious of the loss of such jobs from, for
example, Rolls-Royce at East Kilbride.''
He added: ''Underlying employment concern, combined with the inflation
and retail sales figures, must raise the alarm that the recovery is
slipping away like sand through the Government's fingers.''
STUC assistant secretary Mr Richard Leonard said the unemployment
figures, together with the latest inflation figures, should provide a
timely jolt to the new Scottish Industry Minister.
''Tackling unemployment must be the Government's first priority.
''That means resisting pressure to raise interest rates to curb
inflation and turn, instead, to a policy of economic expansion.''

<HEADLINE>Harbro in #1.4m feed mill expansion</HEADLINE>

FARMERS in the Highlands will be able hold on to their livestock for
longer and sell them at a higher price when a #1.4m development of an
Inverness animal feed mill is completed.
Harbro Farm Sales expects to increase its current workforce of 24 when
capacity at Tore Mill is trebled from 25,000 to 75,000 tonnes of feed a
year.
Inverness and Nairn Enterprise, which is backing the project, hopes
the development will offer northern crofters and farmers a local
alternative to expensive imported bagged feeds and will reduce the
pressure to sell beasts young for a quick return.
Nearby cereal growers and haulage operators are also expected to
benefit from the increased activity at the mill. Harbro, which has its
headquarters in Turriff, Aberdeen-shire, has promised to continue its
policy of buying locally. The company has attracted a #160,000
development grant from the government jobs agency Inverness and Nairn
Enterprise, and a #350,000 loan from Highland Prospect, the investment
arm of Highland Regional Council.
Harbro took over the mill in 1989 and this latest investment comes on
the back of a 12,000 tonne increase in capacity in the last five years
and extensive expenditure on new plant and equipment.
Sales director Graham Baxter said: ''The main constraint to sales has
been that the mill has been working to capacity. With production set to
treble we anticipate expanding sales in bagged feed in the Highlands and
Islands.''
Technical director Peter Kenyon said savings because of economies of
scale would be passed on to farmers.
* TOTAL cereal production in Scotland increased by 5% last year,
according to figures published by the Scottish Office. Reductions in
areas grown were more than offset by increases in the yields of all
crops.
The wheat area fell by 4% but the yield rose by 3% to 7.4 tonnes per
hectare. Winter barley area fell by 5% but the yield rose to 6.2 tonnes
per hectare -- up 21%. The area of spring barley, the most widely grown
crop, was down by 5% but the yield increased by 10% to 4.9 tonnes per
hectare.
Oats showed an increase of 14% in the area grown and the yield
increased by 11% to 4.4 tonnes per hectare.
The non-industrial oilseed rape area was up by 16%. A 2% fall in the
area of the autumn-sown crop was more than offset by a 32% increase in
the area of the lower yielding spring-sown varieties. Yields from the
autumn sowings were up by 16% to 3.2 tonnes per hectare and the spring
sowing yielded 61% more at two tonnes per hectare.
The area of linseed declined by 84% and average yield was 1.8 tonnes
per hectare. The protein pea crop area decreased by 32% but the average
yield was up by 132% to 2.9 tonnes per hectare.

EMPLOYEES of Black Isle Helicopters have attracted the attention of
this week's TrailBlazer feature with their development of a new
''flexi-bucket'' -- a lighter, easier to handle, and more hygienic
container used for the transportation of fish to and from fish farms.
The flexi-bucket is friendlier to fish, much lighter than the
traditional aluminium container and when empty, can be folded like a
plastic bag and carried on board the helicopter, cutting down on travel
time and costs to the farmer.
Black Isle Helicopters was established in 1987 by managing director,
John McCallum, to transport fish throughout the north and west of
Scotland. The company operates a fleet of seven helicopters working from
bases at Inverness and Cumbernauld airport and, in addition to
transporting fish, operates a passenger and filming service.
Since the company was founded it has been using aluminium buckets
supplied by the firm itself for the transportation of 15 million salmon
each year. This sharing of buckets can present risk of disease
spreading, and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries encouraged
Black Isle Helicopters to research possible alternative designs with the
ultimate aim of developing a bucket that fish farmers could purchase for
their exclusive use.
Research into the merits of a new flexi-bucket were carried out in
consultation with fish farmers and the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries marine laboratory in Aberdeen.
Managing director, John McCallum, chief pilot, captain Ian Durstan and
crewman, Chris Ostler worked closely with Chris Mitchell of the marine
laboratory to develop the bucket and carry out trials in late 1993/early
1994.
The result was the new flexi-bucket made from no-tear, no-puncture
rip-stock canvas. The new bucket is manufactured by JW Automarine, a
nearby company that makes salvage equipment, using a material similar to
that used to make salvage floatation bags.
There are many benefits that the new flexi-bucket has over the
traditional rigid aluminium design.
''The flexibility of the new bucket means that, in flight, it takes up
a teardrop shape making it much more aerodynamic and
'flight-friendly''', explained crewman Chris.
''The amount of weight the helicopter can carry is a crucial
consideration. As the new bucket is only about half the weight of the
aluminium bucket it means less bucket-more fish per flight and is
therefore more cost effective for the farmers.''
Some of the other benefits that Chris outlined include the fact that
the flexi-bucket can be man-handled with greater ease and can be used in
much shallower water. It also allows for a much quicker response to an
emergency transportation call-out.
''Normally we would transport the aluminium bucket by road vehicle and
the helicopter would follow on later,'' Chris went on to say.
''Now with the flexi-bucket which is light and can be folded, we can
take this on board the helicopter and be on location much quicker.''
The larger diameter of the flexi-bucket means it is friendlier to
larger fish, and it can be loaded and unloaded in only 18 inches of
water as opposed to the two metres required for the aluminium bucket.
It weighs only 50kg, has a capacity of 900 litres of water and an
carry up to 300kg of fish. Due to its shape it can cut about 10% off
flying time, making it a safer as well as more economical option. It can
also be moved around the fish farm itself using a forklift.
The company have three flexi-buckets in operation and have sold two to
New Brunswick Fisheries in Canada. But Black Isle Helicopters is still
working towards the reduction of the current #1000 price tag, something
that could be brought about by increased orders.
''Our aim for the coming season is to convince fish farmers of the
virtues of the new bucket and encourage them to acquire their own,''
explained Chris.
''We will be making as much use of them as we can in order to
demonstrate the benefits in the field and try to wean the farmers off
the aluminium buckets.''

ANY city gent would be delighted to have a presence in as many
boardrooms as James Fullerton. You will find evidence of James in the
Bank of Scotland boardroom, in the headquarters of Adam &amp; Co as well as
in the TSB head office in Edinburgh, not to mention United Distillers,
Robert Fleming Holdings and Proctor &amp; Gamble.
James Fullerton's head office is his studio in Straiton, Ayrshire for
it is his artistic abilities rather than his financial acumen which
makes him so popular in the business world.
Having sold his first painting while still a pupil of Ardrossan
Academy, James did not know what to charge the businessman but finally,
after consulting with his art teacher, decided on twelve guineas.
Fullerton paintings are no longer sold in guineas but you would have
to stump up #700 for one of the artist's smaller works and up to #3,500
for a larger landscape.
James pinpoints the late 80s as the period when interest in his work
grew.
''It was around the time of the collapse in the stock exchange, and at
the same time a Japanese gentleman paid #25m for a Van Gogh, says James.
''City companies then appeared to decide that as well as paintings
making their offices look better they were also an investment.''
The result is that the price of a James Fullerton landscape or still
life surged upwards.
But James hopes that people buy his paintings for their artistic
appeal as well as their possible investment value.
Accountant Jim Wylie of Wylie Frame is a fan of James' work. He
displays the paintings in his boardroom which visitors can buy and he
has also purchased several for his home.
Next time you are in a board room or the head office of a Scottish
company have a glance at the signature on the paintings there is a good
chance that you will find Fullerton boldly scrawled across the bottom.

FOR almost one hundred years, my company has been engaged in handling
import and export cargo to and from Scotland and, working on behalf of
manufacturers, we have also been involved in the storage and delivery of
consumer goods within the Scottish marketplace. Throughout our history,
we have regularly used the services of rail networks in Scotland,
England, Europe and the USA.
Based on this long experience, I am in no doubt that Scotland
desperately needs a co-ordinated transport infrastructure. The current
rail debate and the future management of the road network in Scotland
concerns me greatly.
Back in the 1960s, some of our food customers conducted their Scottish
distribution of big and small loads via rail wagons using long-term,
low-cost contracts. Eventually, though, through delays, damage and
pilferage, much of this type of cargo was transferred to transportation
by road, and I do not believe that traffic of this sort will ever again
be suitable for carriage via rail.
However, for the good of the Scottish economy in general and the
environment in particular, I hope that more freight will travel by rail
in the future. Poor service, low investment, management problems and
strikes all contributed to rail's loss of revenue from freight business
but one hopes that such problems have been overcome. Fortunately, in the
current ScotRail senior management, we probably have the best team in
the country.
Our competitors in the rest of Europe appear to enjoy a much better
funded rail system allowing them to transport goods via an efficient,
competitively priced and generously subsidised rail network. Where does
that leave us? Lagging behind, as usual?
Over the years, we and other transport operators have tried to work
with British Rail management in order to encourage the transfer of more
traffic from road to rail, but this has been a frustrating experience
with little success being achieved. Considering this background, it is
perhaps not surprising that the transport industry believes that a
privatised rail network is likely to make a much greater contribution to
Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole. I accept that this is not a
popular view with the general public, especially when public opinion
tends to be based on the needs of passengers rather than freight
operators.
The proposal, led by an ever-hungry Treasury, that RailTrack should be
required to earn a rate of return of around three times the current
level of inflation on assets revalued at replacement cost was, in my
opinion, grossly excessive. Thankfully, the regulator has done the
Government's job for it by bringing some common sense back into the
situation. The reduced rate of return is still far too high to make the
system work because, what matters is that rail transport must become
more competitive if it is to win traffic back from the roads,
particularly on long haul contracts. Investment into our rail system
must be increased substantially if we are to achieve a network that is
in any way camparable with that of our European neighbours.
So what of our roads? Do we have something that could be accurately
described as a road network? I think not.
In the 1960s and early 70s, we did not have a satisfactory management
structure capable of producing a co-ordinated approach to the provision
of a strategic road network with local county councils and the Scottish
Office often competing rather than co-operating.
The Wheatley reforms of local government and the introduction of
regional authorities went some way towards a more rational and concerted
approach but even that does not go far enough. We still have arguments
between regions and districts over, for example, the Edinburgh Western
relief road and the M77 in Strathclyde.
The roads debate is becoming one of the most complex and important
issues for the future economic success of our country. I believe that
the Scottish Office, together with the reconstructed local government
bodies, must act in concert to ensure the completion of a strategic road
network for Scotland. The national interest should be their guiding
principle, subject of course to the needs of local communities. If
strategic road decisions are left to the political lottery of the new
unitary authorities, then Scotland's future ability to compete in home
and global markets will be compromised.
Everyone, including the road transport industry, recognises that we
must control the future use of road vehicles of all kinds. But I believe
the best way to achieve this is to ensure that we have a strategic
network of roads that allows the speedy and cost-effective flow of goods
and people over long distances; this, in turn, would facilitate the
development of public transport links to accommodate shorter, more
routine journeys.
I can hear the howls of protest from the not-in-my-backyard
fraternity, but we must find solutions to the problems. We must review
our entire transport infrastructure for public and private use and we
must do this as a matter of urgency.
I welcome the initiative of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce in
organising a major conference on the subject and I hope that, by working
together, the various bodies and interested parties can succeed in
creating proposals and recommendations that will allow Scotland to move
forward to the next century with a combined rail and road strategy that
makes sense for all users.

TWO retired farmers David Johnston and Donald Peddie have come up with
what they believe is the answer to Scotland's waste disposal problems.
From 1998 dumping waste at sea will be banned and local authorities
will have to find new methods of disposing of the organic material
including human waste.
Until now the only options really opened to them was to incinerate the
waste, or process it before spraying it on crops or injecting into the
ground.
However David and Donald have between them built a prototype machine
which converts the waste into compost which can be used for a variety of
purposes including laying out golf courses.
The pair have formed Grow All to market their new process and are
hoping to demonstrate the capabilities of their machine to local
authorities around Scotland.
David Johnston, a retired potato merchant who had a farm at Inchinnan,
Renfrewshire explains.
''Donald and I were seperately studying waste disposal when our paths
crossed. We went to the United States where they are 15 years ahead of
us because they could not dump their waste in the sea.
''They have whole plants which dispose of the sewage waste for entire
cities.''
On their return from the States 15 months ago they bought ECL, a Kelso
fertiliser company which had gone into liquidation.
Ironically Donald Peddie had sold this company to an American firm in
1992.
''They did not understand the market,'' explains Donald, ''and as a
result got into trouble. We now supply garden centres with compost
through the company but the main reason we bought it was as a base for
Grow All''.
Until recently the pair were busy building a machine to ''mechanise a
process that is older than time''.
But says David: ''The machine is only one part of it. You need to know
what to put into as a starter to get the compost process going, and the
starter varies according to the waste you put into it.''
Having built their first machine which can be transported to different
sites, Grow All is not demonstrating the machine's capabilities to three
major companies.
''The end product can be used as compost for a variety of purposes
depending on where the original waste came from but it can be used for
intensive vegetable growing, the top soil for golf courses to landscape
wast sites such as bings,'' explains Donald.
Each machine, says Donald, can handle up to 1,000 tonnes of waste a
day, and David and Donald envisage eight machines in Scotland with the
eventual outcome being entire plants built on the same principle.

TODAY, the High Court in London will hear arguments on Wellcome
Trust's decision to sell its shares in Wellcome to hostile bidder Glaxo.
The trust has a 39.5% shareholding in Wellcome and has said it will
commit its shares to Glaxo on February 28, subject to certain
conditions, one of which is High Court approval. Wellcome wants to
ensure any rival bid is given equal consideration by Wellcome Trust.
Despite having less than a fortnight to go before that deadline,
Wellcome, or at least its chairman and chief executive John Robb, has
not given up hope of attracting a higher rival offer. The board remains
firmly convinced that the Glaxo offer undervalues Wellcome and is still
pursuing alternatives to its offer overseas. Mr Robb, who said he was
'''pleased with the response we have had so far'', added that he had a
responsibility to all shareholders to try to secure a better offer for
the company.
The basis for the accusation that Glaxo is trying to buy the company
on the cheap is the past strong financial performance of Wellcome and
the prospect of more to come. Since August 1990, its earnings per share
have grown by 21% a year, dividend per share by 33% a year, and
operating margins have risen from 21.2% to 31.5%. It is a performance
which Mr Robb describes as ''a glowing testament to the skills of our
staff and management''.
Yesterday Wellcome posted its defence document to shareholders
outlining its bullish sales projections for the years ahead. In the case
of the anti-Aids drug Retrovir, it is forecasting sales growth to #392m
by 1998 compared with #207m last year.
Lamictal, the epilepsy treatment, was launched in the UK three years
ago and has already captured a 20% market share. The market worldwide is
currently worth #1000m and is growing rapidly. So far it relies on
mature drugs which often have serious side effects. Wellcome expects
Lamictal sales to be #268m in 1998 compared with just #28m last year.
In the case of Retrovir, marketed as AZT, and Lamictal the company's
own projections are well ahead of those of City analysts. Mr Robb said
Retrovir sales had begun to recover at the end of last year even before
it became widely accepted that combination therapy with AZT and other
drugs was likely to be the best way to treat HIV infection in future.
Analysts have tended to focus on the declining prospects for Zovirax,
Wellcome's anti-shingles and herpes treatment, after it comes off patent
in the US in 1997. However, Mr Robb drew attention to the fact that it
continues to perform strongly. Sales were up 13% last year despite
generic and branded competition and price reductions.
Aware of the loss of sales when Zovirax comes off patent, Wellcome has
been busy promoting the use of Valtrex, its successor. It is already
launched in the UK and Ireland for shingles and is expected to win
approval for genital herpes next year. Wellcome believes that, as the
drug has a number of advantages over Zovirax and can possibly be used
for a wider range of indications, it could have sales of up to #300m by
1998.
Mr Robb was at pains to stress that Wellcome was a company with a
clear strategy that had been implemented successfully. In contrast, he
drew attention to what he described as the uncertain value of the Glaxo
paper, which makes up about 30% of the #9000m bid, its unproven record
in achieving cost benefits from rationalisation following acquisitions,
and the decline in its underlying earnings per share and sales of Zantac
and Zofran, two of its major drugs, last year.
In the meantime, as the City awaited news of developments in the High
Court and a possible rival bid, Wellcome shares gained 8p to 1023p.
Glaxo's rose 1p to 643p.

BELEAGUERED advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi received two body
blows yesterday as both Mirror Group and Gallaher moved their accounts
to the New Saatchi Agency.
That has been formed by brothers Maurice and Charles Saatchi after
they quit the eponymous Saatchi &amp; Saatchi agency, which became the best
known in Britain for the brilliance of its campaigns, particularly for
British Airways. They were followed by a wave of creative designers.
The Mirror contact, according to Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, is worth about
#7.9m, although the publisher spends more than #20m a year on promoting
both Mirror titles including the Daily Record and the relatively recent
management control of the Independent and Independent on Sunday. The
move takes effect immediately.
The Gallaher contract is purely for Silk Cut cigarettes and is worth
#6.8m. It will not be renewed when it expires mid-year.
Gallaher chairman Peter Wilson said clients normally changed agencies
when they were dissatisfied with the advertising. However, Gallaher is
changing because it is delighted with the current advertising campaign
which has been running for 11 years. Since most people connected with it
have moved to the new agency, Gallaher has concluded it too must move.
The advertising world is waiting to see whether the prestigious
British Airways contract follows the two brothers. It is worth about
#65m annually.

* DAVID Norman is accustomed to people holding their hands up in
horror when he tells them that his business is to import hardwoods into
Scotland. ''You are destroying the environment'', is a cry he is all too
familiar with but David, as chairman of M &amp; N Norman specialist hardwood
timber importers, is unperturbed.
He does not need anyone to tell him that our wet forests have to be
preserved, and as a co-founder of the Scottish Hardwood Charter with
botanist David Bellamy he is committed to the proper management of the
world's hardwood forests.
He makes no excuses for importing hardwood and points out that India
is the world's largest producer but that 90 per cent of the wood that is
cut is used for fuel in the same way that Scotland's Caledonian forests
were burnt in times gone by.
As a member of the Scottish Hardwood Charter he is committed to using
timber from managed forests, and by the end of this year his firm will
only be importing timber from managed resources. This managed system is
designed to ensure sustainable supplies and healthy forests.
''I got involved in 1989 because the environmentalists were accusing
our industry of raping the forests. Public sympathy is raised by TV
films of forests being burned or entire swathes of land being cleared by
diggers.
''This type of activity is carried out for agricultural purposes not
for timber.''
Scottish Hardwood Charter was formed in 1990 and now has 530 members
ranging from house builders to architects and timber importers.
M&amp;N import 12,000 tonnes of timber a year which is around 2000 trees
from countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Brazil.
The company now imports 81 per cent of its timber from managed forests
and expects that they will reach 100 per cent by the end of this year.
''My job is to ensure that our timber comes from such forests,'' says
David Norman. ''I visit rain forests in Malaysia, Indonesia and Brazil
two or three times a year to ensure that the forests can continue to
produce timber into the future, and replanting is taking place.
His trips to the forests often take him to remote parts of the
continents he visits.
''Once I arrive in Rio de Janerio,'' he describes, ''I then fly north
for 2500 miles in a single-engine plane and land on a strip which
doubles up as the main street of the village''.
He laughs as he recalls the first time it happened. ''I could not
understand why the pilot flew low over a village several times, but I
soon realised it was to warn the people to clear the street as he was
about to land.''
David's family still controls the business which has doubled its
turnover to #6m in the last three years, and now has plans to expand
into England.
He points out that it takes 90 times the energy to make the same
amount of plastic as it does hardwood, and sitting behind his desk made
of American cherry he nods towards the lights in his ceiling saying.
''I believe in caring for our total environment. That's why we
invested in low energy bulbs four years ago. This halves our eletricity
bill and we have not had to replace one since.''

THE average non-executive director receives almost #1000 for each day
he works with his company and he typically has such positions with five
organisations.
Pay and benefits consultant Sedgwick Noble Lowndes found in a survey
that non-executive directors earn an average of #14,400 for 15 days of
contracted work. The amount rises to #18,750 if they are with larger
companies, defined as those with sales exceeding #600m.
Non-executive chairmen fare even better, getting #33,750 for 30 days,
rising to #57,000 in larger companies.
''On the whole, the fees earned by non-executive directors are roughly
equivalent to the going rate for management consultancy services,
although they earn considerably more in large corporations,'' observed
Andy Christie of Sedgwick Noble Lowndes.
Many non-executives use their posts to augment their pensions, as
nearly 40% are over 60. In the case of chairmen, the proportion rises to
more than 60%. As befits their age profile, they have plenty of
experience, having served an average of 18 years on company boards, five
with their present employer. This is the major advantage of
non-executive directors -- they bring a wealth of experience and have a
more objective view than executives involved in the day-to-day dramas of
running a company.
A third are on formal fixed-term contracts, usually for three years. A
typical board consists of four executive and three non-executive
directors -- the minimum number recommended by the Cadbury Committee.
However, one-in-five companies have yet to implement this.

BERISFORD International's heavyweight #317m rights issue met an
unenthusiastic response from shareholders, who took only 54% of the
#317m issue, leaving underwriters led by Barings to pick up the balance.
The 11-for-five issue of convertible loan stock was made to fund the
purchase of Welbilt for #295m. Welbilt supplies the kitchen equipment
for both McDonald's and Burger King worldwide, along with Pizza Hut's
oven so is very much tied to their growth, which is continuing apace.
Its market is growing at some 6% a year and McDonald's opened 600
outlets in its home market of the US alone last year. The fast food
company insists that all franchisees buy Welbilt equipment to ensure the
product remains the same the world over.
The deal was Berisford's first after its abortive attempt the buy the
private shoe manufactuer C&amp;J Clark at the end of 1993. Its main existing
business at present is Magnet, the home kitchen supplier. Shareholders
may have spurned the issue because of fears the consumer sector is
likely to remain depressed.
The purchase is expected to have a materially beneficial impact on
Berisford's earnings per share in 1995, but its shares still fell
11[1/2]p to 230[1/2]p.

RETAIL rentals in Edinburgh's Princes Street could reach new record
levels of more than #180 per square foot, according to surveyors
Chesterton. The firm's eighth annual review of the Scottish retail
market says that a lack of supply, combined with demand from new
retailers entering the market, is pushing rentals upwards.
Glasgow's Buchanan Street has recently topped #120 per sq ft putting
the street back up in the big league alongside Argyle Street and well
ahead of Sauchiehall Street. Many of Scotland's smaller towns are also
seeing rentals rise as demand from retailers increases -- those which
are as low as #25 per sq ft are likely to see significant rental rises.
Cumbernauld, Dumbarton, East Kilbride, Edinburgh's Cameron Toll, and
Falkirk all saw rental growth of between 11% and 15% last year.
Chesterton predicts that planning consents for out of town retail
schemes will be harder to obtain in future and that the emphasis is
already returning to existing town centres.

GLASGOW is about to see the development of a massive new waterfront
office scheme. Virtually unnoticed, demolition has started in
preparation for the construction of Broomielaw phase II -- a scheme
which has outline planning consent which could add some 650,000 square
feet of lettable office space to the 280,000 sq ft already let at phase
I and now known as Atlantic Quay.
The new development is by Pillar Properties and Bellhouse &amp; Joseph.
The latter was a partner with Japanese developers Kumagai Gumi in the
development of phase I, a very successful scheme which attracted top
names like Bae Sema, Stakis plc, TSB Mortgages, and ScottishPower into
its waterfront offices.
Despite considerable scepticism from some of Glasgow's property
professionals, the first phase achieved rentals of #20 per sq ft -- just
about the highest ever seen in the city.
With demolition underway, the developers will shortly apply for
detailed consent for a 130,000 sq ft speculative office building as the
first stage of phase II. This could be seen as a bold move in a market
which is still sluggish and for a site which is not in the heart of the
central business district. However, Ed Bellhouse of Bellhouse &amp; Joseph,
the man who pioneered the Broomielaw as a major office location, is
confident that he will have no trouble in finding tenants.
Glasgow is rapidly running out of quality office space. Last week's
announcement that Scottish Amicable is to lease the 52,000 sq ft
Grosvenor building on Gordon Street, means that the city has no
unoccupied modern office buildings -- a dire situation in a city which
has always relied on the availability of empty buildings to attract
inward investors. A new spec building on the Broomielaw could be ready
for occupation next year, putting it well ahead of any rival large-scale
schemes.
Ed Bellhouse told The Herald: ''When we first proposed a scheme at the
Broomielaw during the 1980s, people said we'd never assemble the site.
Then they said that we'd never get consent -- and that if we did get
consent, we'd never build. When we did build, the sceptics said we
wouldn't get tenants -- and if even if anyone was prepared to move
there, we wouldn't get good rentals. Well, we proved them wrong on
everything. And we're about to show them that the market is ready for
the next phase of the Broomielaw.''

NORTHERN Electric shareholders yesterday passed a resolution to remove
the restriction in its articles of association preventing any one party
from holding 15% or more of the group.
The company had called for a poll after small shareholders attending
the egm had voted against the resolution on a show of hands. Private
shareholders make up only around 20% of shareholders and institutions
would have been in favour of lifting the restriction, thus paving the
way for Trafalgar House's hostile #1200m bid.
Northern Electric's share price firmed another 2p yesterday to 1093p.
This followed a 12% upsurge on Tuesday on Michael Heseltine's decision
not to refer the bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Trafalgar's bid is worth 1048p and clearly the market believes it is
going to have to up the terms. Analysts have been suggesting a range of
between 1100p to 1200p. Northern has until tomorrow to unveil its last
defence document. Trafalgar then has a week in which to decide whether
or not to raise the ante.

A ''new'' 13-storey building has caught the eye of passers-by as they
stroll in the Charing Cross area of Glasgow.
In fact, the gleaming white block is merely a transformed office
tower, the highest in an otherwise rather drab, concrete jungle that was
developed as a mall between Sauchiehall Street and West Regent Street
around 20 years ago.
Spruced up, totally refurbished, and adorned with Charing Cross Tower
signs atop its four sides, the hotel is the first in the city geared to
offering no-frills, value-for-money facilities to business visitors and
budget travellers.
''It is the first time this concept, common on the continent and North
America, has been tried in Britain,'' explained general manager Eric
Barlow, tempted back to his home town after a 20-year career with Forte.
The #4.5m hotel, which will open on March 17 after a week-long
trial-run with invited guests, is the brainchild of Surveylink Projects,
a Glasgow-based property development company run by local men Bill
Forbes and Hugh Deans.
Research by the Scottish Tourist Board and its Glasgow equivalent has
shown that the top and bottom ends of the market are reasonably well
served by the existing hotel and guest house structure in the city.
But it also uncovered a gap in the middle with at least 700 budget
hotel bedrooms required for this year alone.
''We intend to help fill that gap while at the same time offering a
little bit more to our guests through the likes of direct telephone
lines, satellite televisions in every room, plus bar and dining
facilities,'' Mr Barlow said.
A price of #38.50 per night -- compared to around #100 for top city
hotels -- is designed to appeal to such customers as commercial
travellers during the week and short-break holiday visitors at the
weekend.
''All the standard hotel facilities are on offer and what people save
in not having to subsidise fancy in-house facilities, they can spend in
any of the hundreds of restaurants and bars within walking distance,''
he added.
With this aspect in mind, the company hopes to arrange discount and
advertising deals with local restaurants.
More than #500,000 in pre-bookings have already been taken by the
company, which hopes for a minimum of 60% occupancy when the operation
gets into full swing.
Most of the dozen heads of department have been recruited in the west
of Scotland, ''young, frustrated deputies '' in the catering business
who are out to prove themselves, according to Mr Barlow.
Well positioned for rail, bus, and car access, the hotel has 275
bedrooms. The restaurant will provide simple breakfasts and self-service
lunches and dinners.

COUNTDOWN TO THE FIVE NATIONS' MATCH IN PARIS
JIM Telfer, Scotland's director of rugby, reckons it's all in the
mind. The Scots, who continue their Five Nations' campaign in Paris on
Saturday, have never tasted victory at Parc des Princes and, even more
significantly, have not won at all in Paris since 1969.
Telfer scored the winning try in that historic encounter at Stade
Colombes and he is heartily sick of seeing the grainy, black-and-white
BBC footage dragged from the archives whenever Scotland make their
biennial pilgrimage to the French rugby citadel.
But the former Scotland captain has no time for bogy-ground theories.
There is, he says, no earthly reason for Scotland's 26-year famine on
French soil. Cue, then, the metaphysical.
''It's very much a psychological thing. There is no physical reason
for it whatsoever,'' he argues. ''The French don't necessarily play any
better at home than they do elsewhere, but other teams seem to think
that they are invincible in Paris.
''What worries me is that the media -- and I'm not blaming them -- and
the people of Scotland seem to accept that getting beaten in France is
acceptable. You know, the attitude is one of we'll look forward to the
Welsh game. They keep on bringing up 1969 and all that.
''Even John Jeffrey on 'Rugby Special' the other day was saying that
the French game would be a good one to miss. That kind of attitude just
won't do. If we go to Paris with the attitude that all we are looking to
do is to keep the score down, and then beat the Welsh so we can go to
Twickenham challenging for the Triple Crown -- which, incidentally, I
think will be even more difficult this year -- then we might as well not
go. I don't want that attitude at all.''
Telfer recalls that, for long enough, Twickenham was the Scots'
so-called bogy ground. That, he says, was laid to rest in the eighties
and there is no reason why the Parc des Princes curse can't be disposed
of in the same way.
''It's all purely psychological. We've had some very experienced teams
out in Paris -- you know, Ian McLauchlan and Andy Irvine, and that kind
of bloke. The French were very physical in those days, with the likes of
Chollet and Paparemborde. They took us on physically and McLauchlan's
sides in the seventies took a bit of a mauling. But now, as I say, the
thing is purely psychological.''
Telfer points out that until last season the ''away loss'' syndrome
had worked in reverse. France had won only thrice at Murrayfield since
1969 and, until last season's 20-12 victory, not at all since 1978.
The director of rugby believes that the sessions with Moray House
College sports psychologist Richard Cox have been of benefit to the
Scotland squad. He tends to become more involved for home matches but,
says Telfer, he would have sessions with one or two players before the
Scots leave for Paris this afternoon.
''Yes, these sessions can help. I think he brings focus for the team
as a whole and personal focus for individuals in the side,'' he says.
For years Telfer could not recall much about the 1969 game, in which
he captained the side. He has now, though, enjoyed the video and the
memories came flooding back.
''They had the usual kind of French side, with big forwards and
enterprising backs like Joe Maso and Gachassin. We went ahead early on
and we just held on. They were over our line twice but they couldn't put
the ball down. It was amazing how we won because we were badly beaten
both territorially and for possession. We just hung on in there.
''The try came from a scrummage about 20 metres out. Ian McCrae kicked
the ball out. He picked it up and fed Tom Elliot, who fed me. It was a
simple score. There was nothing much to it. But they were far the better
team. The referee had to be escorted from the pitch afterwards.''

was described as acute tendinitis to the right Achilles tendon. His

SEA LIFE, attractions, and bingo group Vardon is buying the Parkdean
Leisure holiday park company in a #17.8m deal which will add a
substantially larger Scottish element and also establish a third leg in
the mass market, low-ticket leisure industry.
Vardon already has Sea Life centres at Oban and St Andrews. However,
the acquisition of the Newcastle-based Parkdean facility brings in five
Scottish caravan park centres and three in England.
These are Grannie's Heilan' Hame at Embo near Dornoch, Nairn Lochloy,
Erigmore House at Birnam near Dunkeld, Tummel Valley near Pitlochry and
Sundrum Castle outside Ayr. The two in England are at Great Yarmouth.
Parkdean was founded in 1985 by Graham Wilson and came to the market
in October 1993 at 120p.
Pre-tax profits last year jumped 93% to #1.56m on turnover 19% greater
at #11m.
Mr Wilson said that last year Scotland was comparatively dull with
revenue rising by just over 1% but by more than 7% in East Anglia retail
activities.
More to the point, bookings this year are 20% ahead by revenue with
May and June much stronger than in 1994. It appears that a greater
proportion of UK holiday makers prefer to stay nearer home. Around 55%
of the Scottish business originates from within Scotland while a similar
amount overall is repeat booking.
The terms of the takeover deal are 13 Vardon shares, down 5p at 132p,
for every 10 Parkdean, up 33p at 172p. There is a cash alternative at
162.5p.
Parkdean shareholders will be entitled to a 2.85p final dividend.
The acquisition would have enhanced earnings at Vardon last year. It
will make a useful contribution after financing costs are taken into
account in the current year.
Vardon's chairman is David Hudd and its highly regarded chief
executive is Nick Irens. Their existing three-year contracts have been
torn up and have been replaced with two-year agreements.
Their incentive is now based upon a growth in earnings per share of
well into double figures, probably 20%, over a three-year period which
puts to shame those of many privatised utilities and other competitors
in the leisure industry.
Vardon recovered from the slow, hot summer which reduced income from
the attractions such as the London Dungeon and Sea Life although there
were excellent returns from the Cornish seal sanctuary and from Holland.
There was a full 12-month contribution from bingo where margins jumped
from 13% to 17% thanks to a higher spend although the activity will
begin motoring in earnest when a hall in Croydon is opened later this
year. The dividend has been raised from 1.1p to 1.5p a share.
Current year profits should increase to about #11.5m which would leave
the shares on the enlarged capital selling at 14 times earnings.

CURRIE Line, one of Scotland's oldest and largest shipping,
warehousing, and haulage companies, has returned to local control in an
#8.5m management buy-out.
The six-man buy-out team was led by managing director Mike John, who
has been with the company for the past seven years and is currently
chairman of the Firth of Forth Shipping Association.
Formally established in 1790 as the Hull and Leith Shipping Company,
Currie changed to its present name in 1940. It was acquired by Anchor 27
years ago and was in turn bought by Avena of Sweden in 1990.
The parent company's decision to concentrate on its core gas tanker
division gave the Currie management, based in Grangemouth, an ideal
opportunity to organise the money for a buy-out.
The Glasgow office of investment capital group 3i provided almost
#2.5m in equity and mezzanine financing with the rest coming in the form
of banking facilities from Bank of Scotland.
The directors, who also include European director Andrew Wilson and
finance director Alistair Smith, have put up a substantial, undisclosed
sum.
A fully integrated transport company, Currie provides a door-to-door
haulage, warehousing, and container shipping service concentrating on
the export of whisky, electronics, plastics, and range of products from
BP's nearby Grangemouth plant.
In fact, its operations are thought to account for about 10% of all
Scottish manufactured exports sent abroad directly from Scotland.
''Our spread of operations means that we can offer a total European
transport package, particularly to northern and eastern Europe, and this
is the kind of service which sophisticated customers are looking for,''
Mr John said yesterday.
It also handles such imports as lumber, paper, chemicals, and beer,
mainly from northern Europe. Blue-chip clients include Chivas Regal, BP,
IBM, Rohm &amp; Haas, and J&amp;B Whisky.
Despite the recession of the early 1990s, Currie's annual turnover has
risen to #17m from #12m in the past three years and Mr John is confident
about the future as an independent.
''We are planning a substantial programme of capital expenditure on
our container fleet and to increase the number of tractor units and
trailers for the haulage division,'' he said.
The company, which charters its vessels, also hopes to expand its
ships agency operation out of the Forth Ports, which was recently
privatised.
''Currie Line is an old established company led by an impressive
management team and, having successfully weathered the recession, is now
well-placed to expand,'' 3i's George MacRitchie said.

BULK whisky exports are booming at a time when the industry's sales
are flat, raising fears that jobs in bottling plants in Scotland could
be affected.
According to Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, bulk shipments
accounted for 30% of Scotch exported in 1993 compared to 23% the
previous year.
Other industry research shows that 81.8 million cases were exported in
1993, but that bulk shipments accounted for the equivalent of 13.7
million cases.
The Morgan Stanley analysts said: ''The statistics show that a number
of bulk traders also made shipments to a number of more unusual markets
(a notably large shipment to Israel stands out, for example). This
suggests to us that there is a growing stock of mature bulk Scotch
outside of the UK, and that this stock will eventually be destined for
use in locally bottled whiskies and admixture brands -- helping supply
the growing demand for cheaper Scotch.''
The Morgan Stanley analysts also said: ''We expect that bulk shipments
will continue to increase from the current high level for at least a
couple of years.''
At the same time as bulk exports of whisky were increasing, the price
obtained for these whisky shipments was falling.
According to the Morgan Stanley report, the average price of bulk
whisky fell by at least 12% in 1993.

KEVIN Campbell, the former Scotland Under-21 wing-forward who faces a
life ban because of his claim that he is paid #800-a-month to play for
French club Mandelieu, said yesterday that there were bigger names who
also merited a visit from the authorities, writes Derek Douglas.
The Scottish Rugby Union have reported details of the affair to the
International Rugby Football Board, whose administrative secretary, Hugh
Penman, confirmed yesterday that the French Rugby Federation have now
been asked to investigate and report back to the Board.
Campbell, 32, brother of Scotland 1984 Grand Slam player Alister
Campbell, has been in France since 1986. An unemployed accountant, he
said that he had met Mandelieu president Francois Perez on Tuesday night
when the subject of his comments in the Scottish press had been raised.
''I have not been disciplined and so far as I know I am still in the
side to play Dijon on Sunday. Perez just said to me that anything I had
been paid was to cover travelling expenses,'' said Campbell.
''Of course, I'm concerned that I'm now to be the subject of an
investigation. Who wouldn't be? But I've not said anything that isn't
true. It's common knowledge across here that players get money from
their clubs.
''It's not just here. Look at the situation in Italy. They are the
biggest payers in the world. Why else would all those All Blacks and
Wallabies go to play there? They're not going there to take part in
high-grade rugby.
''The New Zealand authorities have already said they are in favour of
paying their players and the Australians are also going down that
path.''
Campbell said that he was just a small fish compared to some players
that the IB could investigate. ''The SRU or anybody else can come
knocking on my door but there are other, much bigger doors -- and some
of them much nearer home -- that they could knock on as well. I've not
done anything out of the ordinary. Everybody does it in France.''
Earlier this week Campbell said that some French internationalists
were being paid #2500-a-month by their clubs. Tonight, in a BBC Scotland
documentary, Toulouse president Rene Bouscatel will reveal that his club
pay fixed monthly amounts plus win bonuses.
In Scotland, players are entitled to the IB-sanctioned limit of
#80-a-day when on international duty. International squad players also
can earn substantial sums for off-field activities under a scheme
overseen by the players' agent, former Scotland captain Ian McLauchlan.
Additionally, and as reported in The Herald last week, the SRU,
mindful of the drift of top players to England, is investigating the
possibility of providing some kind of assistance which would make less
attractive the job-package enticements being put together by prominent
English clubs.
GLASGOW lost 33-11 to St Andrews at University Park yesterday,
allowing the Fife students a place in the Scottish Universities
semi-final on points difference.
Simon Tollerton converted a Jamie Hart try and also kicked a penalty
as Edinburgh won their section with a 10-8 win over Strathclyde, for
whom Alex Stewart scored a try and penalty.
Cup-winners Aberdeen scored eight tries in beating Heriot-Watt 46-25.
* BIGGAR'S 8-0 win over Haddington on Saturday will stand as a
second-division result. Haddington member Ernie Murray deputised when
Jed Thistle referee John Denham retired with a leg injury.
* STIRLING County are to make their first appearance in the Earlston
Sevens on Sunday, April 16. They will join GHK and all the Border clubs.
* LAST night's district union game between Midlands and Glasgow in
Kirkcaldy, called off because of waterlogging, has been re-arranged for
March 29.
RESULTS: Under-19 District Championships -- Edinburgh 27, South 26;
North-Midlands 7, Glasgow 10. Other match -- Lothian Police 12, Oatridge
College 7.
TONIGHT'S RUGBY: Kilmarnock v GHK (7.30), Edinburgh Wanderers v
Watsonians (7.00), Kirkcaldy v Madras College FP (7.30).

* I WAS in cyberspace this week, quite accidentally. There is
significant lack of rapport between me and my computer. I do not
understand how it works, and it regards me with deep contempt.
Generally, though, we manage to get along.
Perhaps I had stroked the wrong keys after lunch at Remo's
(calamaretti e scampi alle stecche, followed by budino di mandorle,
accomapanied by the old-fashioned kind of Orvieto Decugnano dei Barbi
'88.)
Afterwards I walked back to Nerd House and sat myself in front of my
computer in that pompous, deliberate way that people do when they feel
guilty, drunk, or both. There is no way of disguising this. The more
drunk and the more guilty you feel, the more pompous and deliberate you
become.
Anyway, I stroked some keys with a flourish. To my complete
bewilderment, the following message appeared on the screen: ''And the
same to you, you prat; ?'' I looked at this for a while. I turned my
head to the left, to the right, and upside down. But still it didn't
make any sense. People were starting to look at me -- Teetotal Tom from
Tap Issues, for example -- in that crafty, secretive way that folk do in
open-plan offices when they think they have witnessed a scandal. It's
best to ignore them.
But I needed help. I consulted my old friend The Braces, who
understands computers and their bizarre habits. ''Come and look at
this,'' I said. He took a dekko at my screen. ''Wow,'' he said ''You've
broken into somebody's E-mail conversation. How did you manage that?
I've been trying to do it for ages.''
I had to admit that I hadn't a clue. I'd just stroked the wrong keys
presumably. ''What did you have for lunch?'' asked The Braces, sniffing
the air suspiciously. I said: ''Calameretti e scampi alle stecchi
followed by budino . . . '' He interrupted: ''Why do you remember
absolutely everything you had for lunch, yet can't remember a single
thing about how you penetrated somebody else's E-mail? You are computer
illiterate.'' Yes, I said, but lunch-literate.
He told me that the symbols ;  ? were internet surfer's shorthand for
''punching out'' a correspondent who'd made sexist remarks. ''This is
very interesting,'' he said, and began to stroke my keyboard like fork
lightning. ''Yes,'' he said. ''Here we go.''
What turned up on the screen was a very interesting E-mail
conversation between Vera from Venture Capital and Michael of Market
Demand Curves. It went like this:
Vera: ''What's on today, you :-'' (That symbol means ''male'' The
Braces explained.)
Michael: ''OK, and to your place afterwards :-) (This also means
''leer''.)
Vera: ''And the same to you, you prat :?.'' (This is where we came
in.)
The Braces looked at me in confusion. ''This is astonishing,'' he
said. ''Vera and Michael are having a hot affair, under our noses.'' I
pointed out to him, gently, that Vera and Michael had been married for
the last two years. ''But,'' he said, ''that's what makes it
astonishing.''
Then I told him something else. ''When I was at Remo's ristorante that
lunchtime, there was only one other table taken. Guess who was there?''
He didn't have to give it too much thought. Vera and Michael, he said.
But what were they eating?
''Ostriche alla Veneziana,'' I said. ''Oysters lightly grilled in
their shells, with parsley, celery, herbs, garlic, and breadcrumbs. A
smattering of olive oil. A squeeze of lemon.''
''This would have been Tuesday?'' he asked. ''St Valentine's Day?''
Right, I said.
He started to stroke keys again. ''Let's see what happened
afterwards.'' The message came up on the screen. ''Wow,'' he said. I
still don't understand how computers work, but I'm beginning to
understand people.

THE London Stock Exchange yesterday launched the Alternative
Investment Market in Glasgow and published rules which it believes
strike the appropriate balance between entry costs and investor risk.
AIM, which has received strong backing from the President of the Board
of Trade, Michael Heseltine, will be marketed at roadshows in Edinburgh,
Aberdeen, and Glasgow.
It will allow small and growing companies to raise capital relatively
cheaply. With significantly less stringent entry requirements than the
Official List, however, it undoubtedly poses a greater risk for
investors.
The Stock Exchange was keen to emphasise that the rules are minimum
requirements and there is a feeling among institutional investors that,
while some specialist funds may jump in with both feet, others will
require AIM companies to have a sponsor broker before parting with their
cash.
Scottish Enterprise and Scottish Financial Enterprise, the private
sector organisation which promotes the financial community, have worked
closely with the Stock Exchange on AIM, on which a consultative document
was published in September.
Touching on previous hopes that AIM would be headquartered in Glasgow
because of Scotland's financial services infrastructure, Grant Baird,
executive director of SFE, said: ''This is not a Scottish market, it is
a UK market but one in which we wish most strongly to see a great deal
of Scottish activity.''
Although not based in Glasgow, there are hopes that the Scottish
financial services industry can use its expertise to become involved in
AIM south of the Border, effectively securing a large chunk of the new
business anyway.
AIM, which will open for business on June 19, is targeted at
start-ups, management buy-outs and buy-ins, former Business Expansion
Scheme companies, family businesses and regional companies. Former USM
companies, which have slipped into the ''Rule 4.2'' category which
allows dealings in unquoted firms, and other Rule 4.2 companies, such as
Rangers and Celtic Football Clubs, could also join.
There are no restrictions relating to the market capitalisation of
entrants, most of which are likely to fall into the #5m to #25m range,
the age of the company or the percentage of shares in public hands.
After the anticipated initial rush, Russel Griggs, Scottish
Enterprise's business development director, envisaged between 10 and 12
growing Scottish companies joining AIM annually to raise capital, with
others signing up to create a market in their shares.
Companies on the Unlisted Securities Market, which has stopped taking
new entrants, should have the length of trading record required to
secure a full listing by the time it closes at the end of next year.
European Union directives have made a full listing easier and the USM
basically became obsolete.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland had called for some
form of Stock Exchange compensation fund to protect investors, or
mandatory directors' indemnity insurance.
However, Giles Vardey, the London Exchange's director of marketing and
markets development, said yesterday that no such provisions had been
made.
Companies wishing to join AIM will have to produce a prospectus
meeting the requirements of the European Union-influenced Public Offers
of Securities Regulations 1995 and additional information the Exchange
deems necessary for investor protection. Applications will open
following publication of the POS rules, expected in March.
Entrants must retain a nominated advisor and broker, promptly
publishing price sensitive information, as well as providing audited
annual and unaudited interim figures, and details of directors and their
shareholdings and material transactions.
Although a separate market, AIM will be regulated by the Exchange's
supervision and surveillance departments.

WORK will begin in midsummer on the conversion of Glasgow Sheriff
Court's into a five star #16.5m hotel. Melville Dundas expects the
contract on the 163 bedroom InterContinental Hotel to take two years to
complete allowing it to open for business in the spring of 1997.
The complex will include a private restaurant and leisure facilities
providing more than 200 jobs in the Merchant City.
Peter Conway managing director of Melville Dundas said: ''We hope that
the hotel will be a major contribution towards Glasgow's position as the
City of Architecture and Design. The hotel should help stimulate other
activity in the Merchant City.''
Melville Dundas has an equity stake in the Sheriffhouse company set up
to build and operate the hotel in conjunction with InterContinental
Hotels. The construction and development company expect the contract to
provide jobs for around 150 construction workers.
Glasgow Development Agency is at present cleaning the building which
dates back to 1841 and will also carry out other environmental work
around the building including pedestrianisation of some of the streets.
The involvement in the sheriff house project gives Melville Dundas a
healthy order book as in the last six months they have won #30m of other
contracts including two smaller budget hotels, one in Brunswick Street
in Glasgow and the other in Hill Street, also in the city.
Other contracts include the building of Matthew Gloag's #5m new head
office in Perth and another #5m contract for housing in Govan, Glasgow.
Peter Conway said: ''We are happy with the way our business is
developing and we would expect our turnover this year to be around #45m
while we have #3m in the balance sheet and no borrowings.''
Melville Dundas was the subject of a management buy-out following the
collapse of Lilley in 1993.
The Sheriff Court House was originally built as the City and County
Buildings but was converted to courts in 1892, on completion of the City
Chambers.
The building ceased to function as a court in 1984 and in 1987 was
aquired by the Scottish Development Agency for #1, with the intention of
developing the site as a fashion centre, but in 1989 the developer
withdrew due to lack of finance.
Now a #1m scheme is underway, jointly funded by the Glasgow
Development Agency and European Regional Development Fund.
Work being carried out includes important environmental improvements
such as stonecleaning which has been approved in order to safeguard the
building.

The Central Statistical Office is to publish a third measure of
inflation from next month. The additional index (RPIY) excludes indirect
taxes, such as VAT and excise duties, as well as mortgage interest
payments, which are ignored in calculating the underlying measure
(RPIX).
The Bank of England already monitors RPIY inflation, which it regards
as a truer barometer of inflationary pressures in the economy.
The Bank calculated that RPIY inflation was 1.7% in December. The
underlying rate, currently targeted by the Government, was 2.5%.
More important Bank forecasts show that RPIY inflation will remain
below 2.5% in the bottom of the target range. Underlying inflation is
expected to peak at around 3.25% in the summer.
Yesterday's announcement by the CSO has fuelled speculation that the
Government will target RPIY inflation when it redefines its target for
1997 and beyond. This has to be done within the next few months.
Publication of the enlarged inflation data will be delayed by one day,
avoiding the clash with the unemployment statistics.

THE pound held up well yesterday in the face of a mixed bag of
economic statistics, showing a sharp rise in inflation rates, a fall in
retail sales, a drop in seasonally adjusted unemployment, and unchanged
average earnings.
City economists backtracked on speculation that the much worse than
expected producer price figures on Monday would spark off another rise
in interest rates before Easter.
Sterling lost further ground in initial reaction to the figures, but
rallied quickly as the markets digested the detail. The pound's recovery
prompted speculation that the Bank of England had intervened to rescue
it, but there was no confirmation of central bank support.
Gilts made gains of nearly a point in response to reassuring economic
data from both sides of the Atlantic. Sterling managed to edge up from
86.9 to 87.0 on its trade-weighted index. It was 0.05 pfennigs weaker at
DM2.3574 and 0.05 cents better at $1.5610. Helped by a record-breaking
opening on Wall Street the FTSE-100 share index rose 3.6 points to
3074.9.
The rise in inflation was no worse than the City had expected. The
main culprit was the mini-Budget when the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Kenneth Clarke, raised excise duties on alcoholic drinks, tobacco, and
petrol to compensate for the revenues lost when Parliament voted down
the second tranche of VAT on domestic power.
In all higher excise duties added about 0.3% to the retail price index
in January. But discounting on clothing, footwear, and household goods
lines in High Street sales compensated for the higher excise duties, and
a sharp jump in food prices. The Retail Price Index was unchanged at
146.0 (1987=100).
The headline rate of inflation jumped from December's 2.9% to 3.3%,
its highest level since October 1992 when the rate was 3.6%. The
underlying rate (RPIX), which excludes mortgage interest payments, rose
from 2.5% in December to 2.8%, the first time it had been in the top
half of the the Government's 1% to 4% target range since February last
year.
The statistical quirk in the scenario was the 0.4% fall in the retail
price index in January last year, which has now dropped out of the
calculation of annual inflation rates.
Clothing and footwear prices fell by 4.6% in January, but were still
0.8% higher than a year ago. But this year's discounting was less than
the record price cutting last year.
The same was true in household goods where prices fell by 2.1%, a
larger drop than usual in January, but not as large as the exceptional
discounting last year.
Seasonal food prices jumped by 3.5% last month, taking the annual
inflation rate in this category up to 14.5%. Overall food prices rose by
1.1% in January and were 3.2% higher than a year ago.
Headline inflation bottomed out at 1.2% in June 1993 and the
underlying rate at 2% in September and October of last year. There is no
doubt that the UK's inflation profile is deteriorating, but there was
some relief that the underlying rate did not hit 3%.
In the short run the situation has been aggravated by the Government's
defeat on VAT. The second tranche would have taken effect in April, but
it was replaced by tax hikes imposed three months earlier.
Monday's producer prices showed that factory gate inflation shot up to
3.4% in January from 2.8% in December. This was the shock statistic of
the week. Sterling lost the better part of two pfennigs on Tuesday as
traders identified worsening inflation and the Government's political
weakness as a deadly combination.
Yesterday's data provided some reassurance. The retail sales figures,
showing a drop of 0.9% in January after a revised increase of 0.6% in
December, provided further evidence that consumer spending was slowing
down in response to higher taxes and the three half-point increases in
base rates since September.
Year-on-year growth slumped to 0.2% by volume from 3.5% in December
and 0.7% by value. Volumes were just 0.1% higher in the three months to
January than in the previous three months. Growth on the same three
months a year ago was 2.1%.
The Retail Consortium said the year-on-year increase in the value of
retail sales was the lowest since July 1992. Retailers had reduced
margins to attract sales, but the increase in inflation reflected a need
for shops to accept and pass on increased costs.
The consortium's director-general, James May, said, ''We again warn
the Chancellor how perilously close the retail market has come to
showing a decline, and how weak consumer confidence remains, with the
threat of retail closures and job losses.
''We stress again, ahead of the important spring and sunmmer seasons,
the importance of avoiding further interest rate increases or other
confidence-sapping measures.''
The decline in sales in January, which had been foreshadowed by the
CBI distributive trades survey, was across the board with the exception
of household goods, where sales continued to advance.
This is much the strongest sector in retailing with sales rising by
1.3% in the latest three months and 4.3% higher than in the same three
months a year ago. The reassertion of the normal replacement cycle seems
to be triumphing over the weakness in the housing market.
James Capel's Adam Cole warned against reading too much into the
retail sales figures. Annual revisions to seasonal adjustments factors
had led to major revisions to earlier months. The January 1994 figure
had been revised up 0.9%, and there had been significant downward
revisions to the data for the last three months of last year.

A buoyant report about current trading in the Radio Clyde group has
helped push the share price of the Clydebank-based broadcaster, already
at a year's high, up another few pence.
Speaking at yesterday's annual general meeting of Scottish Radio
Holdings, chairman Ian Chapman said turnover in the first quarter of the
new financial year -- the three months to end-December -- had broken all
records.
Local broadcast revenue was up by 5% over the previous year and
national revenue was up by 50%, giving an overall increase of 20%. Such
comments are music to the ears of City traders and the shares, which
have already well outperformed the sector, gained another 3p to reach
638p, a new high.
Clearly not wanting to encourage unrealistic expectations --
particularly given the recent annual results which showed a spectacular
39% profits increase to #4.2m -- Mr Chapman then cautioned:
''However this level of year-on-year sales increase should not
necessarily be expected for the financial year as a whole in view of the
very strong performance in the second half of the previous year.''
The company also formally completed its transfer from the unlisted
market to a full Stock Exchange listing and a corresponding five-for-two
share split, to improve marketability of the shares, was agreed by
shareholders.
Most recent audience research figures show that Radio Clyde One and
Two are by far the most popular stations in Scotland. With Radio Forth,
Radio Tay and Northsound -- the parent company's other main stations --
all reporting listening market shares of between 25% and 34%, the
company is well placed to take advantage of radio's currently
fashionable position in the media.
Newly turned 21, Radio Clyde was established in 1973 with an
investment of only #150,000.

spectacular at Edinburgh's Commonwealth Pool on Friday, April 14.
Evans, a multi-Olympic champion who has dominated women's distance
free-style for the past eight years, heads a cast that includes
top-class swimmers from all corners of the globe.
American free-styler Jon Olsen, Canadian breast-stroke specialist Jon
Cleveland, and the new young Egyptian star, Rania Elwani, who has been
making her name on the current World Cup circuit, have already confirmed
their entries.
''Squads from Russia, Germany, Denmark, Rumania, and Sweden are also
coming, and negotiations are still on-going with several other top
names,'' said meet organiser Wally Lord. ''I'm just waiting to see who
else we can afford.''
England's Commonwealth Games champions, Martin Harris and Mark Foster,
and Ireland's Michelle Smith and Adrian O'Connor, who are both No.1 in
the world short-course rankings, are also in a line-up that is hoped
will attract television coverage.
The World Challenge is the first of an outstanding three days of
swimming at the Commonwealth Pool. The Multi-Nations Tournament, with
teams from Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Belgium joining Scotland,
takes place on Saturday and Sunday, April 15 and 16.
As part of the build-up to the Multi-Nations, the Scottish squad will
head for a two-week training camp in Lanzarote next month.
Four days after the Multi-Nations, Commonwealth Games medallist Fraser
Walker and double Olympian Alison Sheppard will be among those at the
British trials in Sheffield

SCOTTISH boxing was rocked yesterday when Michael Deveney, the British
featherweight champion from Paisley, decided to switch promotional camps
and challenge an agreement signed by himself, his former manager Norrie
Sweeney, and Glasgow promoter Tommy Gilmour.
The promotional row was sparked after 29-year-old Deveney outpointed
Wilson Docherty, from the Gilmour camp, for the vacant title in Glasgow
last month.
It was a close fight, and a re-match would be ideal. Gilmour thought
likewise and, as he had a signed agreement giving him options on
Deveney's next three contests, thought he was in a strong position to
bring about the return.
Deveney, however, has since appointed Glasgow's Alex Morrison as his
manager -- Sweeney will still be in charge of his training -- and
yesterday said that he thought the option agreement was unenforcable.
Morrison says that Deveney will make his first defence of the title on
his daughter Katherine's promotion at a Scottish venue, still to be
decided, on April 29. He also stated that the Paisley man would earn
more cash than he would have under the agreement.
The Scot will meet the official No.1 challenger, Jonjo Irwin, of
Doncaster, and has been guaranteed a purse of at least #10,000 -- double
what he would have been given had he fought under the terms of the
agreement which Morrison and the boxer are challenging.
Said Deveney: ''I did sign an agreement, but didn't read it. I thought
if Norrie had signed then it was okay. I soon realised, however, that I
could be earning more money and that's when the hassle started.''
It is all rather sad, and what seemed to be a happy relationship
between Deveney and Gilmour has been soured. Deveney, in fact, publicly
thanked Gilmour for his help in getting him a shot at the title.
Said Morrison: ''Michael came to me and told me he had a load of
problems. He said that neither he nor Norrie could handle the pressures
and they showed me a copy of the agreement they had signed with Tommy
Gilmour.
''It was typed on paper under the heading of the St Andrew's Sporting
Club and not under the heading of the British Boxing Board of Control.
It is also against the Board rules to have three options -- two is the
maximum. If that agreement falls on even one count it should fall
completely.''
On the question of the proper type of form, I understand that Rule 10
of the BBBC does not demand that form BBC35 is a requirment. Morrison,
however, will contest that.
He continued: ''The agreement gave Tommy Gilmour the rights to promote
three championship defences. Michael would have received #5000,
inclusive of all ancillaries, for the first, #7000 for the second, and
#9000 for the third. He will get at least double that first option when
he meets Irwin. If the fight goes out to purse offers then we will win
it -- that's why I have the title defence pencilled in for April 29.''
Sweeney told me yesterday, while he watched a video tape of Deveney's
win over Docherty: ''Michael and I had a fall out, but it is now
resolved and I am very happy with the way things have gone. I only want
what is best for Michael. It's a tough sport and every fight could be
the last for a boxer.''
Gilmour's legal advisers have indicated that there are strong grounds
to enforce the first two options of his agreement with Devaney and
Sweeney, and Andrew Sleigh, of W&amp;J Burness, solicitors, said: ''My
instructions are to take every appropriate step to do so.''
John Morris, secretary of the BBBC, said that the organisations legal
advisers were looking into every aspect of the case. ''When the lawyers
give me their view we'll tell the parties concerned,'' he said. ''I'm
not getting caught in the middle of this.''
The Board's view should be made known within the next week.
* DENNIS Andries, the former three times World Boxing Council
light-heavyweight champion who last month admitted to being 48 before
thrilling Glasgow fight fans, plans to win his fourth world title in
Scotland on April 29.
Andries, who won the British cruiserweight crown by stopping Denzil
Browne at the SECC, is scheduled to make an appearance on the promotion
featuring Naseem Hamed in Livingston on March 4 -- but that will be a
mere warm-up for bigger things.
The remarkable Andries will then meet French-based African Anaclet
Wamba, at a venue still to be decided, for the WBC cruiserweight crown
-- more than 15 years after having won his first British title.
The show will be promoted by Frank Warren, in association with
Katherine Morrison, and it is hoped that there will be two other title
fights, plus an appearance by Naseem Hamed on the bill.
Said Katherine's father, Alex, yesterday: ''Dennis had hoped to be in
Glasgow today, for he was overwhelmed by the reception he got at the
SECC, but bad weather kept him in London. He says, however, he is
delighted to be coming back next month and then to fight for the world
title in April.
''We have several venues in mind, but we have to look at several
things, including availability.'' The venues being discussed are the
SECC in Glasgow, Pailsey Ice Rink, and The Forum, Livingston.
Meantime, there are very tickets left for Gilmour's promotion in
Cumbernauld tomorrow night when British bantamweight champion Drew
Docherty takes on Ghana's Alfred Kotey for the WBO title.

THE new logo of the Union of European Football Associations proclaims
the message - ''We care about football''
These words have a hollow ring this morning after the scenes from
Lansdowne Road last night -- mainly because the decision of the European
football authorities to play their championships in England in the
summer of 1996 was always flawed.
Now that decision must be discussed in full and, if necessary, the
championships must be re-located. There can be no delay.
The original decision was flawed because the European authorities were
bending over backwards to ''rehabilitate'' the English game after the
horrors of Heysel -- not because the thugs down south had learned any
lessons, but because the English game produces a great deal of money.
From sponsors. From television companies. From the people who want to
advertise their products around the grounds.
But the plan, with the re-admission of clubs and the free entry to the
Champions' League for Manchester United this season, has backfired.
Somehow, UEFA did not realise -- or did not wish to accept -- that
there is a hard, ugly core to the people who follow England. I would not
use the word ''fans'' to describe them.
They are not there to watch football. They are there to cause trouble.
And they do that for various reasons.
Sadly, some are racial. We have witnessed that from English club
games. Others are political and the National Front has been a constant
breeding ground for the organised thuggery which has scarred the English
game, and which may now rob them of the European Championship Finals.
The football authorities in Geneva may duck and dive. They may take
assurances from the Football Association that this kind of trouble will
not be repeated when the l996 extravaganza is held.
The problem is that these promises have been given before. And these
promises have been wrecked by the same hooligans who wrecked the game in
Dublin.
The same hooligans who invaded the pitch at Stamford Bridge last week,
the same hooligans who have disgraced England throughout the years and
across the Continents.
To give them the same opportunities to make mayhem in their own
backyard is unthinkable.
It would be equally unthinkable to have Scottish fans -- if we do
qualify for the finals -- to be involved, as Irish fans were last night,
in tit-for-tat violence.
The SFA Chief Executive, Jim Farry, and the immensely influential
Ernie Walker should speak up on this. Walker was instrumental in
cleaning up our domestic game, and has the ear of UEFA President,
Lennart Johannson. He will be consulted and the men of power will
listen.
They must listen, otherwise allowing the ties to be played in England
could be a death knell for the national game. Already commentators in
the south are suggesting that the FA should abandon their plans, hold up
their hands and admit they cannot go ahead. That would be a wise
decision.
As for the ''minority,'' it is one which has terrorised cities, even
countries, for too many years. It cannot be allowed to continue. And a
nation which houses so many of these mindless morons should not even be
considered as host to one of the great events in world football.
Instead of considering England as a venue, the European Union should,
perhaps, be thinking of outlawing them once again from the international
arena
Unless, of course, television and sponsorship money is going to be the
only criteria the rulers of the beautiful game recognise.
And that cannot be allowed to happen.
Ironically it emerged last night that the game, the supposed
''friendly'' had been arranged between England manager Terry Venables
and Jack Charlton over a friendly drink...
Last night it appeared that the two old mates had shared a poisoned
chalice -- one which could yet end the English dream of hosting the
European championship finals. That is what the thugs deserve.

COLIN Jackson's manager is attempting to overturn the verdict which
last week cost the world champion his 18-month unbeaten hurdles record
-- but the world governing body of athletics yesterday said it would
take something special to alter the official result.
Jackson and his American rival, Allen Johnson, clocked 7.42sec. for
the 60 metres hurdles at an indoor meeting in Madrid a week ago today,
but the Welshman lost the decision -- his first defeat over the barriers
since August 1993.
His manager-agent, Sue Barratt, has confirmed that a protest, lodged
with the jury of appeal at the meeting, had been rejected on the day.
''But I have now taken the matter further,'' she said.
''We asked to see the finish photo, but could read it only through a
microfiche, like in a library. All whom I spoke to, who had seen the
photo, thought it a dubious decision. I have written to the Spanish
federation, asking them to look into it, and to forward the
documentation and photo to the international federation if they cannot
reach a decision.
''It is nothing to do with the result ending Colin's unbeaten run --
all we want is justice.''
Chris Winner, media director of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation, confirmed yesterday that the Spanish federation had sent
them photo-finish pictures.
''But we have no super-sophisticated technology. We assess them in the
same way as every other meeting.
''This was not an IAAF meeting, so the decision effectively rests with
the jury of appeal in Madrid, and they have ruled Johnson was the
winner.
''We have pretty elastic rules, but without something striking, I
suspect we'll stand by the Spaniards' decision.''
* THERE was a further piece of bad news yesterday for the Jackson
stable. Colleague John Regis believed he had broken the UK indoor 200m
record a week past Sunday, when he clocked 20.47sec.
The race had just one other person in it, but under international and
UK rules, a minimum of three competitors are required before a record
can be ratified. Regis is to make an attack on Bruno Marie-Rose's world
mark of 20.36 in Lievin this weekend.

* THE Scottish Athletics Federation has lost its race against time,
failing to find a sponsor for the year's main international, on July 22,
against Turkey, Israel, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
A financial crisis wiped out #60,000 reserves, forcing SAF to find
#22,000 at short notice. Wales have rescued the event, now likely to be
staged in Cardiff. Subject to securing support, next year's match will
go ahead in Scotland.

NONE of the ''official'' Scots were involved in yesterday's third day
of the #132,000 Churchill Insurance World Indoor Championship, but
Dunfermline-born Mark McMahon returned to the Guild Hall rink where he
took the international open title last year.
The Hong Kong hope picked up where he left off with a convincing
four-set win over Channel Islander Adrian Welch.
McMahon needed just 19 ends to complete a 7-2, 3-7, 7-2, 7-1 win over
the Guernsey man.
Also through to the second round went Rowan Brassey, from New Zealand,
and England's Wynne Richards. Brassey beat former UK champion Gary Smith
in five sets, while Richards defeated Irish and British champion Jeremy
Henry in four.
Smith, the No.9 seed and four times a semi-finalist in this event,
looked to be in command when he took a two-sets-to-one lead, but had
reckoned without the cool drawing skills of the Kiwi.
Richards, who lost out to Hugh Duff in the 1988 final, failed to score
on the opening set of his clash with Henry as the Irishman coasted to a
7-0 whitewash in four ends. However, Henry was to score on just four
further ends.
He picked up two singles in the second, which Richards took 7-2, but
failed to trouble the marker in the next and then counted only two
doubles on the fourth as Richards wrapped up a comfortable 0-7, 7-2,
7-0, 7-4 win.
No.14 seed Ian Taylor took the last two sets to edge out young
Welshman Jason Gladesade 5-7, 7-6, 6-7, 7-3, 7-0, while England's Mervyn
King survived a slow start before beating Ireland's Jackie Smyth in
straight sets. King, the No.11 seed, hit back from 0-4 down in the
opener to win 7-5, 7-0, 7-4.

RACING under Jockey Club rules returns to Lanark on Saturday after an
interval of almost 18 years, with riders from both sides of the Border
set to provide a feast of amateur steeplechasing.
The Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire Point-to-Point has attracted a record
entry of 210 horses to the former Flat racing course because of the
closure of Bogside, in Ayrshire, the L &amp; R venue since 1967.
Since the last Flat race in September, 1977, when it closed due to
lack of support, Lanark has been used for trotting and flapping
(unregistered) meetings and some Scottish trainers have galloped horses
there.
Richard Muddle, whose company runs the all-weather tracks at Southwell
and Wolverhampton, considered introducing Fibresand racing at Lanark,
but negotiations with the owners, Clydesdale District Council, came to
nothing.
Saturday's meeting and the Eglinton a month later will mark the return
of recognised racing to a track best known for its links with the Lanark
Silver Bell, dating back to the twelfth century, and the William The
Lion Handicap, the longest Flat race in Scotland.
The abandonment of the Haydon meeting last Saturday and enthusiasm to
race over a new track have combined to attract the huge entry,
necessitating a card of nine races and an early start at 12.30.
Veterinary surgeon Jim Love, secretary of the L &amp; R, and a team of
helpers have worked throughout the week to prepare the course and erect
the portable fences on loan from the Balcormo course in Fife.
A larger than usual turnout of racegoers is anticipated, and with big
fields, especially in the four maiden races, and a tight fast track,
exciting racing is guaranteed.
Veteran National Hunt campaigners Sparkling Flame, Speech, and Kharif,
and the more experienced pointers Jimmy River, King Spring, and Generals
Boy are expected to line up for the men's open.
Kevin Anderson and Jimmy River may just get the upper hand over
Generals Boy on the soft ground. No Joker, a three-times winner last
season, should win the confined, and Bow Handy Man may triumph over
Minibrig in the ladies' open.

CELTIC will play Real Madrid in Malaga later this month in a game
arranged specially for Spanish television.
And the pay-off will be a return clash which would mark the re-opening
of Parkhead in August. I understand that the details for the game have
now been arranged and that Celtic will meet Real, the Spanish league
leaders, on February 28.
It is a tribute to Celtic's continuing status as a top European club
that they have been invited. Even more important, however, is that the
new Parkhead, set to be completed by the start of next season, will have
either Real or Barcelona as the first visitors.
One or other of the Spanish giants will travel to Glasgow for the game
which will begin a new era at the old ground which had housed so many
famous European nights.
Both clubs took part in European ties there -- Barcelona in the old
Fairs Cities Cup, now replaced as the UEFA Cup -- and Real in the
European Cup itself.
Celtic also played two memorable friendlies against the Madrid side.
One took place at Parkhead in the early sixties, the other being a
testimonial in the Bernebeau Stadium for Real's legendary forward
Alfredo di Stefano which took place soon after Celtic's European Cup
triumph in Lisbon.
In the meantime, Celtic, still aiming for a place in European
competition next season, have the opportunity to tune up against one of
the best sides on the Continent.
The last Old Firm clash of the season in the premier division will be
shown live by Sky TV on Sunday afternoon, May 7.
* THERE will be plenty of smiling faces among fans of both Celtic and
Meadowbank Thistle when they take their seats for the Tennents Scottish
Cup tie at Hampden on Saturday, writes Ian Paul. The club is offering
tickets for #5 in the West Stand to Celtic supporters who are OAPs,
unemployed, or under 16 and, at the same time, will give the 250-strong
band of Thistle fans VIP seats in the main stand.
This all comes on top of their earlier ''Valentine'' offer to give one
free ticket along with a #15 purchase.
The reduction of #3 on the tickets for the end ususally reserved for
the away supporters is an attempt to encourage groups who may have less
ready cash to come to the tie.
The tickets will be on sale until 5.0pm tomorrow evening at Parkhead
and a limited amount at Hampden on Saturday.
Said chief executive Fergus McCann: ''At the majority of our matches
this season, we have had unemployed groups from job clubs as our VIP
guests. Hopefully, this promotion will allow many unemployed people to
come to the match who normally could not afford it.''

BOB HOPE CLASSIC: By
A BADLY struck fairway wood hit by the former US president George Bush
hit a tree and rebounded on to the head of a woman spectator in the
opening round at Palm Springs yesterday.
The accident marred a unique occasion in which Bush played with
another former president, Gerald Ford, as well as president Bill Clinton
together with the British-born comedian, Hope, who is now in his 92nd
year, and the defending champion, Scott Hoch.
The spectator collapsed with blood streaming from a wound above her
eye and was escorted to the first-aid centre by marshals.
Bush later chipped in to score a net birdie for the ''presidential
four-ball.'' The incident marred what was a very happy occasion on a day
in which Clinton became the first serving president ever to compete in
an official Tour event.
Ironically, Bush had recently expressed apprehension about the
possibility of hitting people while playing in pro-ams.
''I look up and see smiling faces and wonder how I'm going to miss
'em,'' he stated.
It was a good atmosphere but in such a conservative stronghold,
Clinton had to endure some verbal shots. ''Where's your wife?'' yelled
one fan. ''She's at home envying me this wonderful sunshine,'' Clinton
responded amiably.
Curtis Strange regained some lost form with a 64 at Indian Wells which
put him in the joint early lead, while Tom Kite also was doing well.
Early first-round scores:
64 -- C Strange, M Dawson, J Gallagher.
65 -- K Gibson, D Pruitt, K Fergus.
66 -- T Tolles, S Simpson, S Jones, C Perry, H Tyler.
67 -- D Duval, J Huston, S Gotsche, D Hammond.
68 -- D Stockton.
69 -- H Sutton, C Pavin, N Henke, B McCallister, D Ogrim, L Wadkins, S
Springer, J Cook.
70 -- J Mahaffey, R Gamez, K Clearwater, R Fehr, R Black.
71 -- J Sluman, J Pate, J Haas.

IT may have sounded like the predictable noises which the manager of
the big team makes when he talks about taking on the wee team, but Roy
Aitken has every reason to make his Aberdeen side aware that there could
be a banana skin waiting at Ochilview when they meet Stenhousemuir in
the Tennents Scottish Cup on Saturday.
The victory over Rangers in the premier division on Sunday was a
memorable start for Aitken in his managerial career, but he has been
over the cup course often enough as a player to know that any relaxation
of standards could bring back all the uncertainties that have afflicted
the club's fans this season.
In addition, Aitken has seen the leaders of the second division twice
and could not fail to be impressed each time.
Aitken, none the less, believes that his own side can make it into the
next round if they are as dedicated to the cause as they were against
Rangers. That attitude pleased him greatly, as did the agreement with
youngster Scott Thomson to sign another year's extension to his
contract.
* ST JOHNSTONE and Hamilton will try again on Saturday to play their
much postponed first division match. With both clubs knocked out of the
Scottish Cup and facing an idle day, they quickly got the agreement of
the Scottish League.
In addition the league, with one eye on the B International between
Scotland and Northern Ireland, arranged the following programme for next
mid-week.
Tuesday. Premier division -- Dundee United v Falkirk. Second Division
-- East Fife v Morton, Stenhousemuir v Berwick. Third Division -- East
Stirling v Montrose. Wednesday. Second division -- Meadowbank v Stirling
Albion.
The league also confirmed that the five-times postponed premier match
between Partick Thistle and Dundee United has been re-scheduled for
Tuesday, March 7, as has the third division game between East Stirling
and Albion Rovers.
* THE draw for the fifth round of the Tennents Scottish Cup will be
made at Easter Road on Saturday after the tie between Hibs and
Motherwell.
* REFEREE John Rowbotham has earned a sunshine trip to Portugal as a
reward excellent performances this season.
The Kirkcaldy official has been nominated by the SFA to join the
Scottish Youth team at a top European tournament -- deserved recognition
for Rowbotham, who has risen from the rank of linesman to FIFA referee
in four years.
* HEARTS teenage midfielder Kevin Queen has been handed a chance to
force his way into the European Championship finals in the spring.
Queen is a surprise call up for the Scotland Under-16 squad who go to
Portugal next week for a four nations tournament.
The Scots will meet Portugal, Norway and Iceland, and youth coach Ross
Mathie said yesterday ''Kevin is the only uncapped player at this level
although he has played for the Scotland Schools Under 15 side.''
The 16 strong squad, which includes four from Rangers and three from
Dundee United, is:
Graham, Cook, Watt and Young (all Rangers), Easton, Fallon and
Thompson (all Dundee United), Boreland and McBride (both Celtic), Holmes
and Queen (both Hearts), Galloway and Mitchell (both St Mirren),
McCaffrey and Paton (both Hibs) and Bryson (Aberdeen).
* MORTON last night signed striker Derek Laing. The 21-year-old,
recently released by Dunfermline, has signed an 18-month deal.
Greenock striker Derek Lilley has been linked with a move to Blackburn
Rovers but Morton are intent on holding on to him at least until the end
of the season.

FORMER world champion Terry Griffiths completed a second successive
5-0 whitewash in the #325,000 Sweater Shop International Open at
Bournemouth yesterday.
The Llanelli veteran crushed Canadian Jim Wych in the second round to
follow his rout of Thailand's Tai Pichit. He will next play Fifer Euan
Henderson, who followed his victory over Thai James Wattana with a 5-2
win over Dennis Taylor.
Holder John Parrott beat Scot Billy Snaddon 5-2 to gain revenge for a
defeat in Dubai earlier in the season.
Benson and Hedges Masters runner-up John Higgins beat Rutherglen's
Drew Henry 5-3 and the Wishaw teenager now faces Dubliner Ken Doherty in
what should be the tie of the third round today.
World No.44 Mark Johnston-Allen, who put out Stephen Hendry when he
beat the world No.1 for the third time in three meetings, crushed young
Welshman Mark Williams 5-1. Second-round results:
T Griffiths (Wales) beat J Wych (Can) 5-0; A Robidoux (Can) beat T
Drago (Malta) 5-2; J Higgins (Sco) beat D Henry (Sco) 5-3; P Ebdon (Eng)
beat J Ferguson (Eng) 5-1; E Henderson (Sco) beat D Taylor (N Ire) 5-2;
K Doherty (Ire) beat P Lines (Eng) 5-1; J Parrott (Eng) beat B Snaddon
(Sco) 5-2; R O'Sullivan (Eng) beat T Knowles (Eng) 5-2; D Morgan (Wales)
beat N Foulds (Eng) 5-1; M Hallett (Eng) beat D Roe (Eng) 5-4; M Price
(Eng) beat A Bishop (Eng) 5-1; A McManus (Sco) beat M Davis (Eng) 5-1; J
White (Eng) beat A Hicks (Eng) 5-3; M Johnston-Allen (Eng) beat M
Williams (Wales) 5-1; N Bond (Eng) beat T Jones (Eng) 5-2; S Davis (Eng)
beat D Harold (Eng) 5-3.

WITH sundry Festival Fringes and Garden Festivals under his belt,
Michael Dale could be excused the indulgence of noting that yesterday
was exactly 24 years to the day since he launched his very first
festival as a student in St Andrews.
He must be hoping that Eastwood's new Artsfeast, the first programme
for which was launched yesterday, will be established on a more secure
financial footing than the Fife event. The signs are good. From an
initial level of interest in the arts of around zilch, the
Conservative-controlled district has produced a fine event with funding
contributions from Strathclyde Region, Renfrew Enterprise, the
Foundation for Sport and the Arts, and the Scottish Arts Council
supplementing its own core grant of #80,000.
Dale was particular in crediting Provost Leslie Rosin, chair of the
Festival Trust, with another key element of the finance -- some #20,000
raised in small sums from a long list of local businesses. When a polite
letter failed to elicit a cheque by return, the Provost hit the phones
with zeal.
The result is a week-long festival running from the Easter weekend --
tickets are now on sale through Glasgow's Ticketlink network. The
programme includes 50 events and encompasses the Rachmaninov Trio,
Gaberlunzie, and Strathclyde Youth Jazz Orchestra -- two members of
which were on hand to promote their concert at Eastwood Swimming Pool.
Our picture shows saxophonist Alasdair Henderson, 20, joining in the
fun.
(Come the day -- Wednesday April 19 -- the band and audience will be
on dry land, but choreographed swimming is promised.)
Potentially the most radical part of Artsfeast will be the visual arts
programme being put together by Julia Radcliffe. Full details of that
soon.

SHINTY'S Scottish champions, Kyles Athletic, have confirmed that they
will not be applying for a place in the new national league which will
be piloted next year with four teams from the north and four from the
south.
With Kyles still having a big say in the outcome of this season's
south championship, and the Camanachd Cup starting in a week's time, the
Tighnabruaich side -- with a stack of titles to their name -- could
conceivably be consigning themselves to the lower echelons of the first
division, where they will be playing the current second division sides
and those on the lower half of division one.
In the north, Beauly have declined the invitation to apply, but is not
a surprise, given their lowly status in division one.
Glasgow Mid Argyll and Strachur now have also confirmed their
applications, and Camanachd Association secretary Alister MacIntyre said
he was waiting for just two clubs who had indicated they would apply --
Inveraray, and Glenorchy in the south.
They've been warned that Saturday is deadline.
Mr MacIntyre said: ''Applications received after February 18 cannot be
considered for inclusion in the league irrespective of league positions
at the end of this season.''
Meanwhile there is every possibility that the weather again will
inflict serious damage on the fixtures.
Two Glenmorangie Sutherland cup ties now dominate the card, with
Beauly due to entertain Inveraray, and Oban Celtic meeting Kingussie.
Fort William and Kilmallie await the outcome of these ties.
The pick of the south's scheduled games is due at Glenorchy where the
wee Glen play host to Oban Camanach in the Keyline MacAulay Cup.

PAISLEY Pirates believe they are four points from achieving a place in
the promotion play-offs.
And the high-flying first-division team could achieve that goal with
back-to-back victories over lowly Chelmsford Chieftains on Saturday, and
away to struggling Dumfries Vikings 24-hours later.
Second-placed Pirates have 50 points from 35 games, the same tally as
Telford Tigers, and six ahead of Swindon Wildcats, who have both played
one game less.
The only other side in realistic contention are Trafford Metros with
41 points from 33 games.
Paisley coach Martin Shields said: ''If we can take four points from
this weekend, and I see no reason why we cannot, then I believe we can
secure our place in the play-offs as our competitors have a more
difficult run-in.''
But Shields and his ambitious squad know they cannot afford to be
complacent.
They only have to cast their minds back four weeks ago to a shock
reverse at rock-bottom Lee Valley Lions when they were mauled 11-7 in
London -- one of only three wins this season for the London outfit.
Shields said: ''You've got to work for everything in this league, and
we'll be doing that to take the points.
''We've done really well for a side in only our second year in
Division One, and we don't intend to let things slip now.''
Former Dumfries Viking Mike Speara jetted in yesterday to help to
boost Shields' squad, and the coach said: ''He's good to have around for
the play-offs in case we hit injury or suspension trouble.''

John Fowler went to see the work of a neglected artist associated
with the Scottish Colourists
THE short life of Robert Brough ended in pain two days after he
suffered dreadful burns in a train crash. His distinguished neighbour in
London, the artist John Singer Sargent, hurried to his bedside. So did
another friend -- the husband of the woman who had borne Brough a child
two years before.
Brough, a dashingly handsome man with a glittering future, was in a
sleeper compartment on the night train to London when it crashed
somewhere between Leeds and Sheffield. The carriage was engulfed in
flames.
After that, darkness fell in more ways than one. His name is found in
few accounts of modern Scottish art, and then only with the briefest
details. After his death in 1905 at the age of 32, Robert Brough
virtually disappeared from the record.
Yet he doesn't deserve this neglect, as an exhibition opening in
Aberdeen at the weekend -- the first to cover the full range of his work
-- will prove.
''After his death, essentially he was forgotten'', says Jennifer
Melville, who has put the show together. ''He is very much a neglected
soul. But I think he is one of Scotland's most important artists, and I
hope this exhibition will put him on the map again.''
Brough was born in the village of Delny, a few miles from Invergordon,
in 1872. His mother had been lady's maid to the Duchess of Hamilton,
whose coachman John Cameron was probably the father, though there were
rumours about the duke.
Single mother and child went to live with her brother in Viewforth,
now a suburb of Aberdeen, where the boy's talent was encouraged by an
influential neighbour, the artist George Reid, later a president of the
Royal Scottish Academy.
The young Brough went to night classes, won entry to the RSA school in
Edinburgh, and came top of the class in his first year as a student. He
also studied in Paris where he shared a studio with his friend S J
Peploe, later famous as one of the Scottish Colourists.
Brough set up as a painter in London with immediate success. His
portraits, executed in a dashing style reminiscent of Sargent, were much
admired -- though they later went out of fashion, dismissed by a new
generation sneeringly as representative of ''the splashing school.''
Brough's work was often shown in Scotland and on the Continent, though
little was exhibited publicly in London. He visited Paris and returned
regularly to Brittany to paint. There is a description of him spending a
week at the Prado gallery in Madrid, rapt in front of the great
Velasquez paintings which Melville believes strongly influenced his
style.
Melville, who is assistant keeper of fine art at Aberdeen Art Gallery,
is confident that the range of work on show will cause a belated
resurgence of interest in Brough, and a new assessment of his talent.
There will be plenty of formal portraits among the 100 works on show,
from the vast scale of the Marquis of Linlithgow in ermine to the
smaller portrait of the 10-year-old Philip Fleming on horseback, a
picture full of energy and vitality (and strongly reminiscent of
Velasquez).
But the real revelation is likely to be his smaller works, often
landscapes with figures, inspired by his visits to France and the
company of French artists -- though there are examples from nearer home
including one tour de force, all tumbling water, called Scottish River
in Spate, and two striking flower paintings.
There is a wonderful Breton peasant girl shown side face against a
pattern of leaves in flickering light. Another picture of two women in
Breton costume is, says Melville, ''a real treat, very simple, like a
Gauguin''.
She remarks on the flamboyance of Brough's technique and finds that
his obvious affinity with contemporary European artists -- for example
in his stark Breton Funeral -- sets his work apart from much that was
being painted this side of the Channel.
Getting the exhibition together involved considerable detective work.
The starting point was a core of pictures owned by Aberdeen, but mostly
in store. Then private owners -- not all of whom were willing to lend --
had to be tracked down all over the country.
Sadly, important details about Brough's personal life have been lost.
One of his last acts was to order his papers to be burned. Flames
consumed more than his body. But this exhibition may prove to be a
landmark. Robert Brough is once more a coming man.
* The exhibition Robert Brough ARSA is at Aberdeen Art Gallery from
February 18 to 25 March.

NEWLY crowned Scottish champions Anne Gibson and Bruce Flockhart will
make a sortie into the British rankings this weekend when they head a
youthful Scottish team to take part in the Surrey Open at Wimbeldon
Squash and Badminton Club.
It is the third event on the British Grand Slam calendar.
Both players missed the first Grand Slam event of the season while
competing in America, and they are ready to make up for lost time now
that their national titles are safely stowed away for another year, with
Gibson in particular looking for a result after having reached the final
of the Perth event in October.
Recent international debutants Craig Robertson, Kirsteen McEwan, and
Pam Whiteford have been named in the squad, with regular team members
Russell Hogg, Kenny Middlemiss, and Elinor and Jenny Allen all unable to
attend, signalling that the pillars of the Scottish team for the last
decade are winding down, a move heralded by Jenny Allen's intentions to
retire this year.
Meanwhile, the Scottish Sports Council have come up with the cash for
the Badminton Union to send a team of 10 players to the World
Championships in Switzerland in May, the last World championships before
Glasgow will host the event in 1997.
National coach Allan Campbell confirmed that five women and five men
will be picked from performances at the national championships and from
the Scottish rankings, with the squad expected to be announced next
week.
Theline-up for the Surrey Open will be Kirsteen McEwan (Bridge of
Weir), Pam Whiteford (Airdrie), Sandra Watt (Penicuik), Alexis
Blanchflower (Glasgow), Bruce Flockhart (Stirling University), Craig
Robertson (Fauldhouse), Jillian Haldane (Kirkcaldy), Aileen Travers
(Perth), Anne Gibson (Marlow), Gillian Martin (Barnt Green).

* GOOD to see that the arts have been to the fore during Mahogany
Week, which comes to a close on Saturday. Chief among the contributions
has been Borders-based sculptor Tim Stead's Mahogany Memorial,
commissioned by Friends of the Earth.
Stead's dining suite has a jagged hole burned through the middle of
the table (''to represent the shocking destruction of the tropical
rainforests'').
Mind you, Stead's work is one of subtly coded brilliance by comparison
with Friends of the Earth's cinema advert for the event, which has been
playing the art houses this week. It features a lavatory with a mahogany
toilet seat -- a major cause of deforestation apparently. The chain is
pulled and the w.c. overflows with blood, illustrating the inspired
legend Mahogany Is Murder.
Trio try new Buffet
* ON the same jungle track we encounter the Royal SNO clarinet section
on their way to save the Mpingo tree. All three musicians -- John
Cushing, Joe Pacewicz, and Michael Huntriss -- have played for many
years on Buffet clarinets, made from the Mpingo tree, formerly known as
the African Blackwood, and found in Tanzania.
Such has been the worldwide demand for clarinet production that the
Mpingo is now an endangered species. So the Paris-based clarinet makers,
Buffet, have evolved a new, environmentally-friendly model made from
powdered wood and offcuts. The SNO boys, famed for the mellow sound of
their Buffets, have been invited over to try out the new product.
Dyl on at Playhouse
* SOME stories don't really bear too much careful checking by your
diarist. Consequently we shall simply assume it to be true that after it
was announced that Bob Dylan was to appear at Edinburgh Playhouse, the
box office received a call asking when exactly he was replacing Phillip
Schofield.
(Mr Zimmerman is at the Playhouse on April 7. Mr Schofield has already
been succeeded by Home and Away's David Dixon in Joseph and his Brand
New Leopardskin Pillbox Hat.)
No Emmy for Oscar
* AS Brits storm the Oscar nominations, the Arts Diary is eagerly
anticipating the appearance of Soup, a movie currently shooting in
Wimbledon. It has Alan Howard as God, Trevor Eve as Lucifer, and Ken
Campbell as Einstein and Buddha. Equally winningly, it describes itself
as ''a British film that delivers wit, style, and a rip-roaring
narrative entirely without the aid of Emma Thompson.''

ALTHOUGH Renfrew District Council has always been heavily committed to
health and fitness in the area, with a busy schedule of aerobics classes
at the various leisure centres, the council recently decided to take a
fresh look at both the programme and the facilities. They voted to make
a huge investment of both time and money, and the result is an exciting
and extremely varied and co-ordinated range of classes to appeal to
people of all ages, shapes and sizes.
The mastermind behind the new regime is Michael Mann, who was
appointed aerobics co-ordinator last September within the leisure
services department of the district council. He is not only a UK
aerobics championship medallist but has considerable teaching experience
in the field. His background is theatre -- he used to be events director
at Wembley Stadium -- and he has worked in some of the best and most
prestigious London health clubs (Chelsea Harbour Club, Riverside Racquet
Club). He is also an experienced teacher of teachers and has given
personal training to many celebrities.
Michael Mann appraised the district council's aerobics programme.
Although there were a good number of aerobics classes at the district's
eight centres Mann found that the participants were mainly women in the
18 to 30 age bracket.
''Regular exercise,'' says Michael Mann ''makes people feel more
confident in themselves, people are so much more aware of fitness
although sometimes newcomers and older clientele are nervous when they
take their first step. That's when we should be reaching out and
helping. We hold golden girl classes in various centres which are very
popular and our aqua aerobic classes draw a cross-section of ages. In
these aqua classes people feel very comfortable whatever their level of
fitness due to the support the water provides.''
Many older people who suffer from rheumatism or have had a
cardio-vascular arrest are advised by their GPs to take up safe forms of
exercise and they can take advantage of Renfrew's varied programme and
be confident that tutors are trained in awareness of safe exercises for
people who have suffered health hazards.
New users according to Michael Mann are coming either to lose weight
post-Christmas or -- if they are very thin -- to gain it by doing muscle
control exercises. Former smokers tend to put on weight in their search
for consolation in the larder, but apart from losing the excess pounds
they also need to strengthen both heart and lungs.
Hard-core users come three or four times a week. Aerobics though,
isn't about feeling the burn after an hour, according to Mann, and the
more delicate type of abdominal work is worthwhile.
His team of 64 teachers are always developing and retraining: ''It is
important for presenters to reassess and develop their skills and keep
updated with new techniques and safety standards. We continue to strive
for excellent standards and hold masterclasses and workshops to keep the
team at the forefront of health and fitness,'' said Mann.
Those in the know are aware of the improving quality of Renfrew
District Council's aerobic programmes and of the superb value of classes
ranging from #2 for aqua aerobics and daytime classes to #2.50 for
evening sessions. The council prides itself in making leisure activities
accessible to all, and offers superb concessions for students, UB40 and
senior citizens in daytime classes.
Apart from aerobics, aqua aerobics and step aerobics there's Michael
Mann's own exciting new -- and exclusive to RDC -- class, Legs, Tums and
Bums which works on individual muscle groups in the lower body area,
conditioning buttocks, and inner thighs. This is already a huge success
with all age groups.
Michael couldn't hold back his excitement when he talked about Scotfit
1995, an event the council is holding at the Linwood Sports Complex on
October 1: ''It's my big project at the moment. It will be a fair of
fitness; the best of Scottish presenters, stalls, Fitkid classes,
lectures and demonstrations. It will be great fun, and of course my own
teachers will be in there leading the pack.''
But the Renfrew District plan is not only about professionalism and
expertise in aerobics, or bringing in celebrities to do master classes
and presentation.
Plans are in motion for modernisation at Barrhead, and Renfrew Baths
already has a specially designed, refurbished aerobics studio with a
sprung floor, which has proved extremely popular with users.
Renfrew District Council, in its pursuit of excellence, is determined
to provide one of the best health and leisure programmes in Scotland.

She could have been a passive victim. But as the thalidomide
generation grows older and another scare surfaces, she has become a
fighter on many fronts. 'I do not want anyone to go through what I have
been through,' the Scottish representative of the Thalidomide Action
Group tells Jennifer Cunningham
THEY come as no surprise to Heather Bird, the news that deformities in
Brazilian babies may have been caused by an ulcer-treating drug used
illicity to induce abortions -- and a doctor's warning that this could
be a greater threat than thalidomide.
Born 33 years ago with no arms or legs as a result of thalidomide, she
is well aware of rumours that a new generation is at risk and is
channelling her considerable determination and anger into a campaign to
prevent that.
Simply and passionately, she explains: ''We are freaks. It is like
being a jigsaw with half the bits missing. I do not want anyone to go
through what my parents went through and no way on God's earth should
anyone else have to go through what I have been through.''
Her mobile phone, on a board above a pile of cushions, is the
nerve-centre of Ms Bird's extensive communications network. Like a queen
bee in her hive, she sits on her sofa and controls the strands of her
life. The procession of people in and out of her living room is
constantly interrupted by the ringing phone.
This is the Scottish headquarters of the Thalidomide Action Group. At
a meeting of the group, set up two years ago, the English campaigner,
Freddie Astbury, recognised Heather's fighting spirit and asked her to
be the group's Scottish representative. The sharp and canny Heather's
response was: ''Is it going to cost me any money?'' Since Freddie's
answer was No, she took it on and the action started.
A phone bill for #700 a quarter was soon testament to her hard work --
and to the fact that it was going to take money as well as time. That
bill also highlights one of the issues of their campaign. ''Tell me who
else pays tax on their phone bill?'' she demands.
The group has been calling for money paid through the Thalidomide
Trust set up after the 1973 settlement with Distillers to be tax-exempt.
Heather pays tax on her bill because she sends her electricity, council
tax and phone bills to the trust which deducts the cost from her annual
allocation, which is taxable as unearned income.
They also want stricter controls on how thalidomide (now being used in
the treatment of Aids, leukaemia and severe mouth ulcers) is prescribed,
used and, especially, labelled. Unimpressed by medical protestations of
strict control, Ms Bird says: ''It is prescribed as a painkiller for
certain people with leukaemia. What if a woman in their house was in
terrible pain and they gave them her of these tablets and she only
discovered later she was pregnant?''
It seems such an unlikely scenario that the drug companies insist
there is no danger -- a pregnancy test is done before the drug is
prescribed for a woman. But the whole story of thalidomide has been of a
battle against medical, legal and commercial assumptions.
It took a very public 11-year campaign for a settlement to be reached
between Distillers, the manufacturers, and the parents of nearly 500 UK
children born severely deformed, many without limbs, as a result of
their mothers' having taken the drug in early pregnancy.
Now, however, the ''thalidomide children'' are no longer brave little
mites playing musical instruments with shortened arms or learning to
master artificial legs. Some have become glowing young mothers and
fathers of perfectly-formed children and a few have gained
qualifications and are building careers. Many, though, are angry men and
women in their 30s whom the world would prefer to forget.
As children they tended to be older than their years; now that they
are heading towards middle age they dread years of deteriorating health
with insufficient income to pay for replacement wheelchairs, adaptations
to their houses and nursing support.
Heather, Freddie Astbury, and Kim Morton from Belfast are not going to
settle for what they see as an injustice. ''Our parents did a great job,
but now it is our turn,'' says Heather, who was 33 last month and whose
parents have both died.
''The trust is running out of money. If it continues paying out at the
present rate, it's going to have none left by 2009. The truth is that we
are living too long. My parents were told I would not live for more than
24 hours, but when it became clear I was going to live, the doctors only
gave me until 35. I am going to live at least six months longer than
that just to spite them.''
Heather has the spirit and determination to outlive the medical
prognosis, but as one of the more severely disabled of the group she
insists on making a cautious assessment of her condition.
She has hands attached to her shoulders, but she is able to manoeuvre
only the right one -- and insists on using it to do as much as possible
for herself. Laboriously she manipulates a #10 note between her fingers
into her purse with a bit of help from her mouth or chin.
Her feet are attached to the bottom of her hips. ''There we are,'' she
says, unselfconsciously indicating a bulge in the elasticated tube she
wears to give her hands as much freedom as possible.
One foot now has to be squashed into the side of her 10-year-old
electric wheelchair. A new one is top of her spending list -- but that
would cost #7500 which she does not have. ''Well, we all get bigger as
we get older, don't we?''
She insists on going to the Post Office to collect her allowances and
benefits every week and stops her chair at shop doors to order her
messages, which are then brought out to her.
But it is all getting more and more difficult. The strain on her spine
over the years (she has to be lifted on to the toilet) has resulted in
arthritis, making it so difficult for her to get a night's sleep that
she no longer goes to bed, but lies on her sofa.
So that her boyfriend, John, can sleep, she has recently employed a
young friend, Tracey, as night carer. One of the effects of thalidomide
is is incontinence. Simply knowing that Tracey is there during the night
has has brought her enormous relief, and the social work department is
currently arranging for other part-time carers to augment John's
support.
She does not like to admit it, but she is often in pain and now has a
heart condition. Her health suffered as a result of a 14-day hunger
strike last year -- on which she was joined for the last 10 by Astbury
and Morton before all three were granted an interview with Baroness
Cumberledge, the junior Health Minister. They agreed to call off their
hunger strike for a review of the circumstances of the 459 beneficiaries
of the trust.
''Nothing has happened so far, but we are due to go back in March, so
we'll see what happens then,'' says Heather. She's prepared to starve
herself again for the principles involved, but would prefer to avoid
inflicting more misery on herself.
The trustees are doing their best to share out the money fairly and to
stretch it as far as possible. Neil Buckland, the trust's director,
won't comment on particular beneficiaries but he does say: ''Some people
seem to manage better than others.''
Heather says that moving from the house her parents built with the
lump sum she got 20 years ago was her biggest mistake. After her parents
died, though, it seemed a good idea to move nearer to John's parents.
Five years after she moved in, the former council house she bought still
needs adaptations to the kitchen and bathroom.
She and John have been together for seven years -- and engaged three
times. He would like to get married but she says she does not believe in
marriage -- ''not for me, anyway''.
It is the only time she looks away and suddenly it is clear that for
all her upbeat courage, she will never get over the hurt of not being a
normal woman, wife and mother.

Advice for mothers-to-be from Dr ANNE PETTIGREW
TIME was when an expectant mum could put her feet up, eat for two, and
await the happy event in blissful ignorance. But now medical science
seems to keep adding instructions, warnings, and advice to the pregnant
woman to such an extent that it is at times difficult enough for the
hapless GP to keep up, never mind the patient.
If you're planning a pregnancy you should first consult your doctor
and then buy a large handbag.
It's important to have a blood test to make sure you are immune to
German measles (rubella) even if you had an immunisation at school as
your immunity can change. Rubella caught in the first few months of
pregnancy is still sadly a cause of blindness and brain damage in
newborn babies. It's also important to get advice about starting folic
acid supplements (400 microgrammes per day) before you conceive and
until the 12th week of pregnancy to prevent spina bifida. This is one of
the more common baby abnormalities where a defect in forming the spinal
cord causes paralysis, bladder problems, etc.
Many foods like broccoli, brussels sprouts, breakfast cereal,
black-eyed peas, etc, are rich in folic acid. Despite a Government
campaign it's still common for us to find women booking in at eight-10
weeks pregnant not knowing about this B vitamin. It's too late then.
Stopping alcohol and smoking before conception also improves the chances
of a healthy full-term baby. Before all women of child- bearing age rush
out to buy vitamins there's another warning. Too much vitamin A can
cause birth defects. This is also one of the reasons why the Scottish
Home and Health department now warns pregnant women not to eat liver
which contains a high level of it.
The other reason particularly refers to liver pate which, along with
soft cheeses like Brie can carry listeriosis. This causes a mild
'flu-like illness in an adult but can be serious for the foetus. Other
infections causing pregnancy problems are toxoplasmosis (congenital
brain damage) and brucellosis (miscarriage). Fortunately these are not
too common in this country and hopefully avoided if you don't clean cat
litter trays (toxoplasma) or drink unpasteurised milk or help with
lambing or calving (brucellosis).
So, avoiding the cigarettes, the G and T's, the cheese counter, the
sausage and liver pate and animals have we negotiated all known hazards?
No, there's still chickenpox, endemic it seems to me all year round
and one of the last remaining childhood diseases to elude the vaccine
makers. Unlike rubella it's a particular problem in the last three
months of pregnancy when the mum's immunity is suppressed to cope with
the baby and severe pneumonia can occur. If you're pregnant and in
contact with someone with chickenpox you should see a doctor immediately
for a blood test to see if you need an immunoglobulin injection which
can reduce the severity of the illness if you are unlucky enough to
catch it.
When you actually achieve the pregnant state you are bombarded with
more information, conflicting advice, appointment cards, scan pictures,
and decisions to make about yourself and the new human being you are
growing than in any other condition needing medical attention. They need
to start educating girls in school. There may be enough for sitting a
Standard Grade exam in motherhood if things carry on the way they are
going!
And the handbag? Not for the broccoli and black-eyed peas, but for
your thick A4 case records. In many areas like ours mums-to-be carry
their own. An excellent idea in information exchange which could well be
extended to other patients and save the NHS millions.

WOKE up yest'day evenin', put my mojo in my black cat bones. Yeah,
woke up yest'day evenin', put my black cat in my mojo bones. Lordy,
lordy, lordy, when Eric plays the blues they sure stay played, yes, yes,
indeed. 'Scuse me, don't accuse me, I got me a bad case of bluesological
infection.
Eric played the blues, yup. All kinda blues. Sitting-down acoustic
jamboree-skiffle blues. Jaunty country-swing blues. Gravelly-voiced
blues. Raw-throated mucus-charged blues. Medium-sized big band jump-jive
blues. Ragtime blues.
Semi-acoustic uptempo post-war urban Chicago blues. Neatly-picked
blues. Deft slide-guitar blues. Slow and snoozy. Walking blues, talking
blues. Otis Rush, Muddy Waters, Lowell Fulsom, Elmore James, Jimmie
Rodgers, Freddie King, B B King. Above all else, Eric played bluesy
blues. Not magenta. Not purple. Blue.
Me, I got dem blues when Eric forsook his seat after 20 minutes and
did a version of Howlin' Wolf's Forty-Four that was stately rather than
crisp, that wasn't strange and driven by a bunch of hell-hounds on its
tail. A bit too reverent. Look at it in a museum through a microscope,
rather than take it apart and glue it back together in a new and
fascinating shape.
No pinks. No yellows. No cerise, vermilion, candy-apple orange, puce,
or chartreuse.
How we spell Eric's blues? Bee. Ell. Oh. Oh.
Ohmigodwheninellwegettinlayla. Zuh. Woke up last evenin'. Went home.
'Fo' I went bedwards, I put some jazzy-funky loop-bop on my hi-fi. Some
trip-hop ambient handbag, some country-punky ragga . . . some frigging
folk music -- anything bar more 12-bar blues.

Kicking up a fuss
* PREGNANT women who become emotionally upset can cause their unborn
child distress.
A study of 60 pregnant women at Sydney's Royal Hospital for Women
shows a foetus will kick up a fuss when its mother becomes agitated.
It found that if an expectant mother was upset watching a
heart-rending film her unborn baby started moving in the womb with a
raised heartbeat.
The upset-baby phenomenon lasted only as long as the film scene, says
Dr Leo Leader of the New South Wales School of Obstetrics and
Gynaecology.
Home births debate
* ADDED fuel will be given to the debate on home-versus-hospital
births following the results of an Aberdeen trial. They found that women
at low risk did better at home than in hospital. The report in the
National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit says home births are safe for most
mothers and babies. They point out that some babies may actually do
worse when looked after in hospital.
Wine and dine
* THE debate about the protective effect on the heart of moderate
drinking continues. A report in the British Medical Journal says doctors
should advise the public to have one or two drinks a day, preferably
with meals, perhaps red wine. Provocatively the article blames the
temperance mentality for blurring the protective message and warns
teetotallers of the hazard of continued abstinence.
Mixing it
* WATCH out for a new poster hitting the Glasgow streets on drink and
sex. It's eye-catching if nothing else: After 4 vodkas, 3 gins and 2
brandies, can you manage a stiff one?
It is issued by Drinkline the national phone helpline. If you are
still in doubt over whether sex and alcohol mix they suggest you give
them a call: 0345 32 02 02.

WE don't need a doctor to tell us when we have a cold. The itchy runny
nose which makes us sneeze, the clear nasal exudate that goes green and
then dries up and the dry scratchy throat that never quite becomes sore,
coupled with a feeling of malaise that doesn't show a rise in
temperature, are all well known. Treat a cold and you'll cure it in two
weeks; leave it and it will take a fortnight, say the pundits.
This simply means that we have not yet found a cure for the common
cold. Years of research show that it is mainly caused by rhinoviruses
whose miriad types preclude the possibility of a single inoculation.
Because colds usually get better by themselves the drive to find a cure
with no side effects has lost momentum.
The common cold is transmitted by droplets scattered when we sneeze
and cough, and also by nasal secretion on the fingers. We are infectious
for about 24 hours before symptoms appear and for five days after.
Rhinoviruses are destroyed by an acid environment so they do not survive
in the stomach and are not transmitted in the faeces.
Because colds are caused by viruses they cannot be cured by
antibiotics. But colds can create the conditions where pontentially
noxious bacteria, such as haemolytic streptococci, which may cause
tonsillitis and meningitis, can invade the damaged lining of nose and
throat and spread infection locally to the ear or sinuses as well as
further afield via the blood stream. These conditions do respond to
antibiotics, so if a cold does not improve or fever appears, it is worth
consulting a doctor.
What can you do about preventing a cold? Some people swear by cod
liver oil, some vitamin C, others take garlic. This last may work by
keeping people who are infective far enough away to prevent droplet
spread!
Homeopaths may recommend ABC6 for early cold symptoms or Nat Mur 6X
for watery nasal discharge. Aromatherapists mention inhalations or oil
rubs containing eucalyptus, peppermint, pine, or rosemary. Some people
take an aspirin at night to relieve symptoms and help them get to sleep.
This is for adults only; since the association of Reye's disease, a
serious liver and brain dysfunction, with aspirin given to children in
the convalescent stage as a viral illness has been identified, aspirin
products for children have been withdrawn from the UK market.
Paracetamol compounds are the usual substitute.
An old-fashioned Scots cold cure is a teaspoon of honey, a tablespoon
of whisky (for adults only), and the juice of half a lemon, made up into
a mugful with hot water.
It is each to his own as far as I am concerned. I do not think we can
cure the common cold, but we can try to prevent its spread.
If people who knew they were sickening for a cold took a couple of
days off, while they got over the sneezing and coughing stage, colds
would spread less widely.
Using large, strong tissues to hold up in front of the face to prevent
your sneeze being broadcast may help, especially if you then get rid of
the tissue safely into a garbage bag.
Wash your hands after blowing your nose if you have a cold. Gargle
nightly through winter and spring, using midly salted water. You are
trying to get the same strength as body fluid. This will wash the
breathed-in dirt of the day off your upper throat. If you can't gargle
drink a half glass of luke-warm water last thing at night. It has the
same effect.
Also try to get a good night's sleep. In the deep stages of sleep
growth hormone is released which helps to mend damaged tissue. Much
restorative work in the body is done during deep sleep. My advice to
those of you with colds is to stay at home for a couple of days while
the sneezing is at its worse, take your normal diet and any extra hot
drinks that you like: you often feel thirsty when you have a cold. Above
all see that you get as good a night's sleep as you can.
The sign of an untreatable disease is a huge number of so-called
infallible remedies. We spend about #80m on cold cures each year. You
may know one that works for you. Use it.
Unhappily it may not work for anyone else or the common cold would be
the thing of the past. There are effective treatments for the ''cold
sore'' that so often accompanies a head cold. Some are available over
the counter so consult your pharmacist or GP.

Miriam Stoppard explains how knowing more about your body can help you
enjoy a more fulfilled life.
GOOD health is every woman's birthright. So is a family. So is a
career. Juggling these three, however, can undermine your health. Worse,
it can lead to mistakes; an unplanned pregnancy can be a real spanner in
the works.
You may not realise it, but you have a secret weapon which you can use
to keep all your plates spinning in the air without dropping them, or
exhausting yourself -- planning.
No business would ever survive without planning. Planning reduces
risk, permits growth, encourages stability and, best of all, maximises
the bottom line. In this instance you are the bottom-line.
Planning can enrich your life, leach out the stress, and enable you to
make the most of yourself. Planning is life insurance. Start planning,
and you can enjoy the lifestyle of your choice and good health too.
Planning isn't difficult for women, we're naturals. We've been expert
planners since time began. How else could we get the kids off to school,
do a day's work, see to the family's meals, laundry (and his shirts),
get the football kit ready for Saturday, go to a PTA meeting, and manage
to fit in a hairdo, an evening at a work safety meeting, and an aerobics
class?
Given that today's woman can ''have it all'' she should probably start
planning in her teens. Most importantly you should look into the future
to see the effect of today's decisions when you reach 40 or 50.
Will you be happy with the outcome? If not, change now, so that
today's plans give you a middle-age to look forward to.
For instance, if you decide at 22 that you're going to put off
marriage and babies until your early 30s look at the automatic fall-out
of that decision. First you'll want some time with a partner to devote
to yourselves; that means you might not want children until 35 and it's
not so easy to conceive then -- you may also be trying to hold down a
job or career. Is that what you want?
No? Well, how about having your children 10 years earlier when your
career's in its infancy? When you're strong and energetic? OK? Fine!
It sounds easy, doesn't it? But it requires planning, especially
family planning. Some statistics might focus the mind: Once a couple
decides to have a baby only five out of six will achieve that goal
within six months, so many couples will have to re-arrange their
calendar while waiting to conceive. The older you are, the less chance
you have of being one of the lucky five.
There are easy ways, however, to increase your chances and it's to do
with managing fertility. A woman has a right to manage her fertility,
but to have this power you must know how your body works. In particular,
how the menstrual cycle and ovulation work and their connection to
fertility.
Fertility, for most women, means the time of the month when you're
capable of conceiving. On its first anniversary, WISe, the Women's
Information Service, has found that one year on, there has been some
progress in increasing knowledge but a lot of us are still baffled about
fertility.
A little knowledge about your female hormones will help. Oestrogen is
the primary sex hormone in your body prior to ovulation. Just before
ovulation there is a rise in oestrogen which triggers the rapid release
of another hormone, luteinising hormone (LH). It is the surge of LH that
actually causes the release of the egg from the ovaries, known as
ovulation.
After ovulation the ovary produces progesterone -- the basic hormone
of the second half of the month which, among other things, raises your
basal body temperature slightly from 98.4F to about 98.6F or 98.8F.
To predict your most fertile days you can use a home ovulation test
from the chemist. Most are extremely accurate -- up to 98% -- in
identifying the surge of LH in your urine. As the test gives you warning
of ovulation 24-36 hours before it actually happens, you have time to
plan ahead for intercourse during your most fertile days, thus
increasing your chances of conceiving.
So those women in Britain who are confused about their fertility --
particularly those who think it is possible to conceive on 10-21 days
each month (two in five) -- can relax and start planning.
According to the new study, we all have quite a lot more to learn
about ourselves -- and so do our partners. A boon to you (and your
partner) is a slim, handbag-sized booklet published by WISe, which
contains information on all aspects of fertility, including
understanding how your ovaries work, timing a pregnancy, and the factors
affecting fertility. It's the third in a series of six, aimed at helping
women to understand their bodies and plan for health.
* WISe Up to Fertility is available free from the WISe Line on 0753
676962.
Know you own body
EVEN though nine out of ten women know that ovulation is when the egg
is released from the ovaries, much confusion surrounds how this relates
to conceiving a baby. While we remain confused there's no way we can
manage fertility and plan our lives. Nineties woman needs to know these
facts:
* During each menstrual cycle usually a single egg matures.
* Ovulation is when the egg is released from the ovary.
* It nearly always occurs around the middle of the cycle.
* Home ovulation tests are one of the most reliable and accurate
methods of predicting your most fertile two to three days which occur
around ovulation.
* Only when the egg is alive can it be fertilised by a sperm.
* The egg can be fertilised for approximately 24 hours after release;
sperm can usually live for three to five days.
* The egg can therefore be fertilised if there are sperm already
inside you when it is released.
* It is possible to get pregnant only on the few days surrounding
ovulation -- typically five to six days every cycle.
* As it is not possible to conceive outside your fertile days each
month it is important to time sex for your most fertile days of each
cycle if trying for a baby.
A women's birthright: managing fertility means knowing how your body
works

WHAT'S the point in stories that aren't even true? It's a question
that ran through Salman Rushdie's mind in those first fearful days of
going into hiding after the Satanic Verses fatwah was imposed on him.
What price the freedom of the storyteller? And not surprisingly it's the
question he posed in the next novel he produced, Haroun and the Sea of
Stories.
Its transition to the stage, under the auspices of Scottish company
Benchtours, seems particularly appropriate. It's not just that the
theatre is a natural forum to raise public issues of censorship and
artistic licence -- under the most authoritarian regimes in South Africa
or the old communist bloc, the stage has typically been the last
recourse for voices of dissent (and significantly, Salman Rushdie was in
the audience last night) -- but it's also that the playful, childlike
nature of the novel adapts eagerly to the live art of performance.
This production directed by John Cobb has an elegant and assured flow
to it, executing a simple, uncluttered series of imaginative ideas with
apparent ease. Enlivened by quirky songs and Peter Livingstone's
Eastern-influenced score, it has the feel of agit-prop in its happy
blend of elements. Oddly for a group of performers grounded in physical
theatre, Benchtours often strikes me as a company short on physical
charisma, but what the acting lacks in presence it makes up for in its
sprightly good-naturedness. Lips will be unzipped from here on in.

IT'S enough to make a horse laugh. The film that marks Caroline
Thompson's debut as a director, Black Beauty (U) -- based on the famous
book by Anna Sewell -- lasts 88 minutes going on four hours.
Ms Thompson, who also wrote the script, has an enviable track record,
indeed one to die for. The scripts for Tim Burton's magnificent fairy
tales, Edward Scissorhands and The Nightmare Before Christmas, were
hers. So too was the script for Agnieszka Holland's delighful version of
Frances Hodgson Burnett's classic tale, The Secret Garden. She also
co-wrote The Addams Family.
Why, with a track record like that, she should come such a cropper
with this well-loved book -- to which her script is notably faithful --
is a mystery, especially when you consider that the title is usually all
that's left of a classic after Hollywood gets to grips with it.
Maybe she is just too fond of horses, because it does take a truly
awesome talent for misjudgment to render tedious to behold the sight of
something so beautiful as a horse, let alone stretch 88 short minutes
from here to eternity and back.
Little girls who like horses may well enjoy the film, but it is hard
to imagine anyone else getting much pleasure from it. Black Beauty is
poorly shot, slackly directed, and badly performed -- the child actors
are all ghastly and W C Fields's advice about Babe LeRoy should be
applied to them forthwith; while the adults, notably Alun Armstrong, Jim
Carter, Peter Davison, Peter Cook, Eleanor Bron and David Thewlis, are
clearly there to pay the rent.
One knows to expect the worst right from the start when the soundtrack
erupts with one of those string-drenched scores which make one wish the
composer had never heard of Greensleeves or Percy French.
But the horses, which play Beauty and Ginger, are very good indeed --
quite stunning to look at. They manage to express all sorts of emotions
with their eyes, and to do amazing things on their hind legs.
For reasons that passeth understanding, however, Beauty, who tells his
story, has been given the voice of Alan Cumming. I have nothing against
Mr Cumming, who on this histrionic evidence could clearly could go far
as a member of the BBC Radio Drama Repertory Company, but it is hard to
grasp the reason for having Beauty, born on Farmer Gray's farm somewhere
in Yorkshire, speak in the flat, soporific vowels of Strathclyde.
The film is also very unsure of the seasons, since the foliage on the
trees is high-summer green one moment and russet autumnal tints the
next. Although poor Beauty goes throughout life without ever having sex
(unless he and Ginger get up to something off-screen we are not told
about), the film should serve one useful purpose . . .
It should end the myth of the gooseberry bush. We get an on-screen
birth for our hero in glorious Technicolor. But otherwise it is black
marks for Black Beauty, I fear.
Peter Jackson's Heavenly Creatures (12) is a disturbing film based on
a true story. Set in the early 1950s in Christchurch, New Zealand, it is
about Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey), a lump of a 14-year-old frump
who becomes friends with an English girl of the same age, Juliet Hulme
(Kate Winslet), one of those Angela Brazil mistress-of-all-she-surveys
types, who joins her class in school.
The self-absorbed Pauline is infatuated with this posh new friend, who
suffers from tuberculosis and has all the petulance of a spoiled
only-child. Paradoxically, she is neglected by her rich parents who are
too busy leading their own lives to bother with her.
The girls, both outsiders, discover they share a love of
story-telling, and embark on an intense, homo-erotic and potentially
dangerous relationship. They create a world of their own, Borovnia -- a
kingdom of cloud-capped towers and palaces, inhabited by kings and
queens and ogres, some of whom are suspiciously like their favourite
films stars, and they give each other secret pet names.
Their respective parents eventually realise that all this is less than
healthy and try to break up the friendship -- with catastrophic results,
which it would be unfair to reveal.
Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet give amazing performances as these
two misfits. Lynskey's Pauline is all sullen resentment and puppy fat,
exactly the sort of girl who is her own worst enemy and never one of the
gang; while Winslet's Julia, displaying all the poise of a reject from
the Rank charm school, is the epitome of the lonely, neglected, rich
wild child.
They show quite clearly why one falls for the other -- and why Mario
Lanza is their idol. If the adults seem to over-act (excepting Sarah
Peirse as Pauline's downtrodden guesthouse-keeper mother) that could be
because we see them largely from Pauline's point of view -- which is, to
put it mildly, biased.
The film uses her real diaries to tell parts of the story which give
events a truly chilling dimension by supplying the authentic voice of
incipient madness. The lip-pursing horror with which the respective
parents greet the idea that the girls' relationship might be homosexual
is hilarious. But this was New Zealand, 1952, when the family doctor's
idea that a cure might be found was not so ludicrous as it sounds today.
Their school is also grotesque, a sort of scholastic Cell Block H, but
again it is very much how the girls see it -- a place where nobody
understands them and all the mistresses are gorgons.
Heavenly Creatures is not at all what one would have expected from the
man who made Meet The Feebles, a film I will never forget because it is
the only one I have watched from which an audience of critics got up one
by one and stole silently out, unable to take any more.
On the other hand, it could explain the rash decision to represent
Borovnia with actors and models done up like the Plasticine creatures
created by the girls. The intention is clearly to flesh out their
imaginings, but it was mstaken. The result looks shoddy and lends not
just a totally unnecessary falsity to an otherwise horrible and
all-too-real story of everyday perversity, but renders it funny in quite
the wrong way.
If one thing is clear from the Parker-Hulme affair, it is that little
girls are not necessarily made of sugar and spice and all things nice.
Greg Arkadi's Totally F***ed Up (18) -- that is the title, I am not
being coy about the word in question -- is a group portrait of six gay
and lesbian teenagers in present-day Los Angeles. They talk about life,
sex, Aids, getting high, and falling in love. They get queer-bashed,
betrayed by friends, play the field, and generally have the sort of
dreadfully intense unhappy time that is apparently the fate of all
Californian queens.
The cast, all new to films, have lots of charm and the sex they
perform is safe, so they are not necessarily setting a bad example,
though one does feel that there must be more to their lives than this.
Suicide, to which Andy resorts, is more than just an awfully big
adventure.
Arkadi's last film seen here was The Living End and there is no doubt
that he is an interesting addition to the ranks of gay-film-makers.

IT WAS an American wit, probably Will Rogers, who liked to tell his
audiences that it's no crime to be poor, but it might as well be. In
Britain, as the obituaries for a lousy century are being put together,
we could probably add that it's no crime to be rich -- it just looks
that way.
Three useful things can be said about the Rowntree Foundation Inquiry
into Income and Wealth, published last week. The first is that its
findings surprised no-one; the second that no-one has questioned their
validity; the third that no-one in British politics has a blind idea
what to do about them.
The report said simple, devastating things: that since 1979 the bottom
10% of the population have become 17% worse off while things for the top
tenth have improved by 60%; that the number of people existing on less
than half of average incomes has tripled; that one in three children is
being raised in poverty; and that 30% of us have made no gains
whatsoever from economic growth. It did not add, though it could have,
that all of this took place amid an ''economic miracle''.
Inequality on this scale is no passing phase. It is a worm at the
heart of society. It is one thing to know that the bottom 50% of the
population owns only 8% of the country's wealth; quite another to hear
that the top 10% have locked up almost half of the total.
The Rowntree report amounts to evidence that government neither
represents nor cares for perhaps a third of Britain's citizens, yet
no-one who has drawn breath recently will find its conclusions
surprising. Poverty is on the streets, naked and foul, and it won't be
wished away by Ministers who believe all things are relative, as though
to say Richard Branson is relatively poverty-stricken when set alongside
the Duke of Westminster.
Laissez-faire Thatcherism perpetrated two vicious deceits during the
eighties. One was the myth that anyone can become rich. The second was
the delusion that the accumulation of wealth is at all times a blameless
pastime, good for the country and good for the soul. Wealth would
''trickle down'', as though from a golden goblet to a sewer.
Lacking any good excuses of their own, John Major's administration has
stuck to these lethal, rusty guns. In the Commons this week Peter Lilley
was again defending the idea that inequality means economic efficiency
and accusing anyone who thought otherwise of the politics of envy. Major
was boasting of how, ''on average'' and in ''real terms'', just about
everyone is better off than they ever were.
THE truth, as Rowntree demonstrates, is that wealth in Britain is
being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. The power that this implies
is important, for only those in possession of such power are capable of
effecting change -- one reason why the poor are rarely of any political
consequence. None of this is denied by the Government, of course; only
its meaning is disputed.
Labour, conversely, knows what it all means but cannot bring
themselves to say what they will do about it. Donald Dewar was, by all
accounts, his passionate self in the Commons, enumerating the social and
economic consequences of Britain's biggest growth industry. Yet when
pressed on what, precisely his party proposed, he faltered.
Harold Wilson liked to say that if Labour is not a crusade it is
nothing. The trouble is, you do not embark on a holy war unarmed.
Confronting poverty, Wilson's successors look like naked pacifists
taking on tanks. All the arguments are on their side; all the artillery
is with the enemy.
Writing in one of the Sunday papers, shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown
laid out a convincing case for a reformed welfare state and for
investment in skills and people. He wrote of the need for a national
minimum wage and for the continuing education of 16 and 17-year-olds not
in work. The Dunfermline MP recognised the need to tackle unemployment
head on and ameliorate the effects of free-market policies. But he
denied himself one word.
Nowhere in his article did Brown mention tax. The idea that you can --
indeed must -- achieve redistribution through the tax system has, it
appears, been purged from Labour's thinking.
New Labour's problem is, in this matter, old Labour's problem --
wealth is economic power; share one and you share the other; duck the
challenge and you achieve nothing. Besides, as Peter Lilley knows, we
just aren't killing the poor off fast enough.

William Russell reports from Berlin on a
film festival living up to its opening row.
ALL the best film festivals start with a row. Berlin proved no
exception. It opened with the East German actress Corinna Harfauch, star
of the opening film The Promise, disowning the image it gave of life in
the German Democratic Republic.
She said she had liked the script -- the film, directed by Margarethe
von Trotta, is about a young couple separated by the Wall -- but had
difficulties with the finished film. She was promptly sat upon in the
nicest way by both the director and screenwriter Peter Schneider who
insisted they had been scrupulously fair.
The Promise is a fascinating, well-acted film which tells the story of
the young couple over a period of 30 years until the Wall comes down --
the perfect opening movie.
This has been a true European film festival not dominated by
Hollywood, which is as it should be. There are strong German, Asian and
European entries although there is only one British film, Butterfly
Kiss, in competition.
The best of the German films is that rarity, a funny German film. Die
Mediocren is a sparkling comedy about friendship, love and racial
prejudice involving two thirty-something couples who perpetually switch
partners. The crisis comes in their liberal lives when one of the men is
suspected of being an East German.
A first feature directed by Matthias Glasner, it is not in competition
but in the Panorama section. The best moment comes when one young man
asks his lover what she sees in his friend and she tells the poor sap.
There is also a good Queen Elizabeth joke which must not be spoiled by
being revealed.
Paul Newman is the star of the festival. He has his best role for many
years in Nobody's Fool, a sentimental story of small-town life in
America, written and directed by Robert Benton. Newman plays a feckless
handyman whose world is collapsing but who manages somehow to pick up
the pieces. It is a lovely performance and the film's only flaw is
Benton's reluctance to bring things to a stop.
Robert Redford turned up for his film, Quiz Show, a splendid story of
game show cheating, starring Ralph Fiennes. It is certainly a strong
contender for a prize. But Newman so far has given the male performance
of the festival.
The French director Agnes Varda has come up with an unashamedly
Francophile centenary birthday film for the cinema, called One Hundred
and One Nights. It stars Michel Piccoli as the centenarian Simon Cinema,
recalling his long life to a pretty young researcher. That the cinema it
celebrates is mostly French is fair enough but it is odd that a
Franco-British co-production should ignore British cinema.
There are the odd bows to Hollywood and Italy, mainly because Marcello
Mastroianni plays a visitor to the old man. All the same, the producer
Jeremy Thomas should feel shame. The visitors to the centenarian range
from Catherine Deneuve to Jean-Paul Belmondo, Alain Delon and Jeanne
Moreau. It is very much a train-spotter film -- name the stars, name the
clips. It is a genuine oddity and amusing but strictly for film buffs.
The only UK film in competition, Butterfly Kiss, has yet to be
screened. But the other British film on show, Priest, directed by
Antonia Bird, certainly caused a stir. It is in the Panorama section and
won a prize at Edinburgh last year in its unfinished state when reviews
were banned. It proves a torrid affair and should give rise to
considerable debate. Ms Bird told the audience they were the first
Europeans to see it, which makes one wonder who she thought were in the
audience in Edinburgh -- Martians, perhaps?
Written by Jimmy McGovern, it is about a gay Catholic priest, played
by Linus Roache, who is caught snogging (in EastEnder soap-star fashion)
in a steamed-up Mini with Bobby Carlisle. The police are not amused and,
as if that were not enough, he has other problems -- what to do, for
instance, about a young girl's ''confession'' to him that she is being
sexually abused by her father?
McGovern has loaded the dice. Directed by Ms Bird in operatic style,
the film is certainly entertaining but the realism she strives to inject
evades her.
The divine Gong Li has a whale of a time playing a wicked lady in The
Great Emperor's Concubine, directed by Stephen Shin. The plot involves
warring factions in medieval China and is incomprehensible, but the
battles and banners, the costumes and the scenery, and a cast of tens of
thousands, more than make up for it.
This being the cinema's centenary -- Berlin has opted for 1995 -- the
occasion is being celebrated by a splendid Buster Keaton retrospective.
One of the greatest stars of the silent screen, he was born in 1895 and
his widow, Eleanor, was guest of honour. A spry old lady, she breeds St
Bernard dogs and trains the pooch who starred in the hit comedy
Beethoven.
The star being honoured this year is Alain Delon and there is a
retrospective of some of his finest films. Delon's career may have ended
up in a welter of routine French cops-and-robbers movies but there was a
time, from about 1960 until 1970, when he made some amazing films and
worked for some of the greatest directors. They included Borsalino,The
Eclipse,Rocco and His Brothers, The Swimming Pool and The Leopard, as
well as Plein Soleil,in which he played Patricia Highsmith's amoral
Ripley to perfection.
The French actress Julie Delpy, who is bilingual, has been trying to
make an American career for herself and gets her best chance yet to make
her mark in Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise. She plays a young French
student picked up on a train to Vienna by an equally young American
student played by Ethan Hawke.
He persuades her to break her journey and they spend the day and night
in Vienna looking at the sights and talking about love, life, death and
the problems of being young. Their brief encounter is very charming and
the two stars give delightful performances, although there are times
when one feels one could have done with someone else for company.
One of the other highlights is the Norwegian film Cross My Heart and
Hope to Die. It is about a young boy, the local school football team
reject, who is forced to spend the summer alone in town when all his
friends have gone on holiday. He sees the adult world from quite the
wrong point of view, misunderstanding pretty well everything that is
going on around him. It is funny and rather sad.
There are some interesting films still to come before the festival
ends on Sunday. They include Abel Ferrara's vampire movie, The
Addiction, and a thriller called Fresh Bait, directed by Bertrand
Tavernier which is about that currently fashionable subject, young
teenage killers on the rampage.
Berlin is not a festival about stars. That is the job for Cannes. It
is about films, and this year, if there has been nothing of the highest
quality, the standard has been very consistent and proof that the
European cinema can produce films audiences will enjoy.

PM: Well, colleagues, I think we can congratulate ourselves on another
highly successful week. We lost only two Ministers, the privatised
utility bosses have just awarded themselves a few extra millions in
share options, the top civil servants are going to be better off and
more superior than ever and Ginny has promised the nurses a rise of 35p
per week, less tax. Everything's coming up roses, a song I used to sing
at weekends . . .
Cabinet Secretary: I don't think we should go into that now, sir.
Mr David Hunted: The thing that puzzles me is -- who was that little
twit Wardle, anyway? The first and only time I ever heard of him was
when he resigned.
Senor Michael Horbillo: He was very concerned about immigration.
Bored President of Trade: If we had been a bit tighter on that 30
years ago we might have kept your lot out.
PM: Colleagues, I must ask you to stop quarrelling. I get letters
about it, you know, from our own supporters, who say if we can't agree
among ourselves how can we be expected to run the country. They want us
to fight the Labour Party.
Mr John Deadwood: It's a lot more fun fighting ourselves.
PM: Right, yellow card, last warning, one more foul and you will be
sent off to Scotland. Talking of which -- didn't Ian do awfully well to
point out that devolution would cost more than the entire budget of the
United Nations and the American space programme put together. Stop your
tinkering, Jocks, I say -- oh yes.
Mr Ian Languid: Thank you, PM. You probably did not see it but there
was a programme on television, the Great Debacle as it has become known
throughout the land, where Mr Alex Salmond and Mr George Robertson
shouted at each other for a couple of hours, the audience were allowed
to bawl and boo and the three distinguished journalists on the panel
looked as though they wished they had been posted to Chechnya.
PM: Should we not have been invited to take part?
Mr Languid: No, no, we are only the Government. Robertson and Salmond
both mentioned Brian Meek, though.
Mr Hunted: I've never heard of him either.
PM: Ian, I did see that funny fellow, Mr Jock Straw of the Labour
Party, on the box the other day explaining his party's commitment to
having some kind of English Regional Assemblies in answer to a question
about West Lothian. What's that all about?
Mr Languid: Well you see, if English MPs cannot vote on education in
Lanarkshire but Scottish MPs can vote on education in Oxfordshire it
does not seem quite fair. So the Labour Party might set up an Assembly
in Oxfordshire.
PM: But nobody in Oxfordshire wants an Assembly.
Mr Languid: Agreed. So in that case they will not need to have one.
You only get one if you want one.
PM: How does that solve the question about West Lothian?
Mr Languid: Pass.
Mr Jonathan Aiking: I'm fed up hearing about bloody Scotland, let's
talk about Europe, how we are going to tell Heinrich Hun where to stick
his Ecus, how we are never, never, never going to have a single currency
unless it is called the pound and has the Queen's head on it.
Cabinet: God Bless Her.
PM: No, Jonathan we are not going down that trail again, it only
causes trouble.  I have made my position quite clear.  If I am speaking
to a right-wing audience I am against it, if the Chancellor says he is
for it so I am and the best option of all is to wait and see who has
this rotten job when the time comes to decide.
Senor Horbillo:  But, PM, as Sir Teddy Teapot has so dramatically
pointed out, he has a fax which proves that immigrants could, at any
moment, be pouring over our borders.
Mr Aiking: We are not talking about the bloody Scots again, are we?
Or the Irish?
PM: Thank you, Jonathan, for so kindly raising the subject of Ireland,
quite the greatest triumph of my career as I think you will all agree.
Even the dimwit Blair cannot take that away from me.  Only this morning
I was saying to Mr John Bruton, the Irish tea-cosy, and a lovely man to
boot . . .
Dr John Mahunney: Ye hov to watch out for the Unionists, so ye do.
PM: No problem, John, we are all Unionists in this party.  We are
Unionists in Northern Ireland where we are going to give them a
Parliament and Unionists in Scotland where we are not.  That's logical
as you must agree.  No problems on your front, Frankie?
Mr Frankie Howard: As Home Secretary I can safely say there have been
no prison breaks since this meeting started, PM, although two Group Four
men have escaped from a crowd of warders and I would like to be Foreign
Secretary soon, please.
Mr Malcolm Rough Kind: So would I.
Mr Douglas Heard: So would I.
(Enter a policemen).
PC: Mornin' all.  I am very sorry to interrupt your meeting, Mr Major,
but I think I ought to inform you that there is a h'airyplane proceeding
in a southerly direction and heading for Downing Street, numero 10.
There is a man dressed in an officer's uniform of the RAF holding a
hand-grenade in the pilot's seat and there is a banner coming out the
back which reads: ''It was not me who ordered the expensive wallpaper.''
I thought you should be told.
PM: Under the chairs, lads, bandits at six o'clock high.
Mr Howard (and others): Spitfire for Mr Rough Kind.

WHEN I was younger it was easy to be cowed by puffed-up head waiters
and strutting consultants and ladies selling perfumes and unguents to
open-pored keelies such as me. Age has helped. So has practising
lip-curling disdain in front of a mirror in earnest rehearsal for an
advance application for candidacy of the awkward squad, or at least the
ability to squeak now look here.
When you have striven for years not to be meek, when you spend whole
decades struggling against niceness, when you have to fight against the
urge to pile on another pink necklace and head out with the express
purpose of finding old ladies to help across the road, there is little
left to be fearful of. Except moral absolutists. They scare the hell out
of me.
Wagging furious fingers in faces crumpled under the strain of all of
life's uncertainties, which they do not share, they seem gloriously
untramelled by doubt. Or the notion that they might be wrong.
This week, a doctor was honest enough not to pretend that he is sorry
for ending the lives of two terminally-ill babies 20 years ago. He
acknowledged that what he had done was illegal. In both cases, he said,
the babies were lingering on in a lot of pain and the parents were
deeply distressed, so he gave the children larger doses of a painkilling
drug. He did not know for sure if his efforts had caused the babies'
deaths. He was certain of one thing only. Even though he believed it was
the most humane thing to do, he would not do it now. Inevitably, he
said, one of the pro-life organisations would shop him to the police.
The Life organisation, which campaigns against abortion and
euthanasia, called for the doctor to be jailed immediately. He had set
himself above the law and deserved to be dealt with severely by the law,
they growled. No uncertainty there then.
These things are topical. They will rise higher up the political
agenda in a spume of outraged certainties soon. Some time later this
month we can, if we are so minded, watch on television as a
terminally-ill Dutchman is cleanly and clinically dispatched by his
doctor. Mr Cees van Wendel de Joode of Amsterdam insisted his chosen
manner of death should be filmed. The doctor administered a legally
sanctioned injection to end his immense suffering. His wife held his
hand as he died.
For the euthanasia lobby with its doubt-free advocacy this was Mr de
Joode's farewell gift. Film of a painfree death dignified by choice. But
the death by induction seems somehow impeccably rational and neat and
Dutch. I find its neatness abhorrent. I think I'd rather the old man had
fallen head first into the Herengracht one cold, dark night. And yet . .
.
For most of us, hell would be to find ourselves terminally ill or
hopelessly impaired and to discover that some zealous medical
bossy-boots has fixed us up with tubes and drips so that we may look
forward to a protracted period of technological abuse. We would hope to
be allowed our decent and timely expiration, to die with dignity. And
yet . . .
The last high profile prosecution of a doctor for proactive terminal
care involved Dr Nigel Cox who dispatched his elderly patient with a
syringe full of potassium chloride mixed with diazepam. A friend who is
a doctor was scathing. I was appalled that he was appalled. He is a
compassionate man, a caring doctor, unafflicted by the weary cynicism
that seems to settle on those who stare death and suffering in the eye
of a day.
Bristling with the dull bravado that comes of ignorance, I pointed out
that the woman was in intolerable distress. She was going to die. Surely
it would have shown a reckless inhumanity for a doctor to refuse her the
right to leave her life with some remnant of painfree dignity. Surely
you of all people . . .
The pious swelling of high-dudgeon was nicked by a swift incision. No
good doctor would use such an injection to bring about a patient's end.
This was a bad doctor. A good doctor would use increasing doses of pain
killer which would take the patient out quietly, peacefully, painlessly,
and stealthily. It was not the method but the means employed that my
friend objected to. Doctors have to grapple with the dilemma every day.
Is there a moral difference between accelerating death through
withholding a drug and administering a drug to achieve the same end?
Surely withholding treatment is as much death dealing as active
intervention?
A survey of 2000 family doctors published last week showed they
divided 44:54 against legalising active euthanasia. More than one third
of the GPs had been asked to take active steps to end a life. One third
of those doctors complied. Active euthanasia exists here but it is
covert not overt. We know it happens. We may even, in circumstances of
profound distress, urge it upon doctors. Yet we threaten prosecution.
The British Medical Association does not want euthanasia enshrined in
law. It is ethically acceptable to give terminally-ill patients
painkilling drugs in amounts that curtail life to kill pain, even if
death results. Death becomes the side-effect. But the doctors'
organisation is opposed to its legalisation, worrying it could lead to
situations where a little help to speed us on our way would be seen as
not only permissible but desirable. Seriously ill patients, the BMA
fears, might think they had a duty to die. And I can't escape the
suspicion that some sick, elderly persons -- especially those with money
or an expensive ailment -- might tremble at the sight of a syringe.
Then there is the hospice movement which tells us that pain control
has become so advanced that our final agonies are themselves becoming
defunct.  We can leave instructions not to be resucitated by some
busybody to a twilight life. Beyond that how far should we go? A
rational decision would make euthanasia legal. But we are not a rational
people. Can we know with any assurance how we will feel at the end? By
what right do we decide for others?
I don't know. I wish I did.  I can say only this for sure: those who
have a perfect conviction about the answers scare me far more than the
prospect of an imperfect doctor with compassion and a syringe.

WE have had the Scottish film Chasing the Deer. Watch out now for
Chasing the Sheep. Actually the proper title is Donald McNeep Has Lost
His Sheep.
News of this movie comes to us from an organisation called Audiovisual
Eureka, a ''pan-European media initiative'' with 33 member countries.
They have decided to award a ''Eureka label'' to McNeep the movie, which
should help secure the necessary funds to go into full production.
The film is being made by Armac Films of Glasgow, whose principal is
Alex McCall, a former director-producer at BBC Scotland. It is a
Scottish-Greek co-production about a Scots farmer who moves to Crete
taking all his 2000 sheep with him.
''The film is a kind of EC Whisky Galore but about sheep,'' explained
Alex. Although there is whisky involved. And raki, an explosive mixture.
To summarise a complicated plot, the Scottish farmer ends up owning
some land in Crete after his daughter becomes involved with a Greek
chap. McNeep decides to emigrate flock, stock, and barrel. He then
becomes involved in the macho world of Cretan sheep-stealing, as Alex
describes it.
But, haud on! Is the hero really called McNeep? His real name is
Donald Campbell, admitted Alex, but is thus nicknamed ''because he has a
heid like a tumshie''.
Is this a true story? No! Will the film really involve transporting a
large number of Scottish sheep all the way to Crete? In the current
climate of animal protest, what do you think? ''We'll be looking for
bits of Scotland that look like Crete,'' said Alex. And once the
Scottish sheep are sheared, they will look quite like their Cretan
counterparts.
So who will play the part of Donald McNeep? ''We have approached
Patrick Stewart who played Captain Jean Luc Picard in Star Trek,'' said
Alex.
Any other casting news? ''One of the major characters is a ram called
Shafter,'' said Alex. ''We will probably have a look around Kelso ram
sales for that part.''
Side-lined
THE usual suspects from the Scottish business and political
establishment gathered for a black-tie bash in Kelvingrove Art Gallery,
Glasgow, to bid farewell to British Rail chairman Sir Bob Reid.
Hosts ScotRail also invited a few railway people from over the Border.
One seat remained vacant, however. Richard Hope, consultant editor of
The Railway Gazette and source of many trackside soundbites did not make
it.
Mr Hope had been scheduled to travel up from the South. He missed his
train.
Trunk road
THE Name Game: the director of roads for the Wimpey group, currently
making no environmental friends by cutting down trees for the M77
through Pollok, is one Dan Pollard. Almost appropriate, except that
trees are ''pollarded'' to improve their chances of survival.
* Still on the subject of the M77, we hear that Allan Stewart's
ministerial demise after his brush with the protesters has opened the
door to a career on TV. He is to be the new host of Take Your Pick.
To a louse
THE decision by Rolls-Royce to shaft their committed and efficient
East Kilbride workforce by moving projects to Derby has prompted a
factory hand to pen this variation of the Selkirk Grace:
Some hae work but canny work
And some nae work but want it
But we hae work
And we can work
But we're screwed cos Derby want it.
Rolf's rave-up
WITH Rolf Harris exhibiting such a caring face in his role as
presenter of the TV show Animal Hospital, we had almost forgiven him for
that song about two little boys and their wooden horse. Now it's back to
square one when we hear about the Aussie's new album. Called Rolf Rules
OK, it includes cover versions by the didgeridoo man of Walk On the Wild
Side, I Can't Get No Satisfaction and Wild Thing.
Come dancing
DURING a pleasant ceilidh night at the Riverside Club we were
introduced to the Glasgow Square Dance. It is a simple routine which
begins ''slap, slap, slap, slap'' followed by ''stamp, stamp, stamp,
stamp''.
Very Glasgow, we thought. Although it should be pointed that it is
only your partner's hand you slap. It is the floor, not anyone's head,
on which you stamp.
Mary Laurie, the duenna of the Riverside Club, assures us the Glasgow
Square Dance is a genuine number. But she is from Wishaw so we prefer to
believe that it is an elaborate hoax.
This concept opens the door for the invention of a whole card of new
dances with appropriate movements. Such as:
* The Celtic FC Reel: The Parkhead board members and team manager join
hands and go round in circles. Occasionally the music stops and a new
director or manager joins. The music restarts they go round and round in
circles again.
* The Dashing White Security Guard: Circles are formed, each
consisting of three privatised prison officers and three prisoners on
remand. The steps are similar to the Dashing White Sergeant but at the
end of each set, the prisoners duck under the security guards' arms and
run away.
* Mr Lang's Quango: A dance mainly performed by captains of industry
who are sympathetic to the Conservative cause but are not party members.
Also popular with ''independent'' councillors in rural areas of
Scotland. Dancers form tightly knit circles, indulge in elaborate
handshakes and then scratch the backs of their partners. When the caller
shouts out instructions such as ''health board'' or ''water industry''
the dancers reform into different circles and carry on as before.
No doubt readers have their own ideas of new dances for our ceilidh
collection. Send your suggestions to the Diary at the usual address and
you might win fabulous, but as yet unspecified, prizes.
The normal rules apply except that members of quasi non-governmental
organisations may not enter.

A LEISURE centre which closed after legionella bacteria was detected
is to reopen after further tests showed no trace of the bacteria.
The Time Capsule in Coatbridge has been given the all clear after
specialist cleaning treatment.
The centre was closed over a week ago, when routine laboratory tests
found the bug in shower heads.
A Time Capsule spokesman said: ''We closed immediately after
identifying the problem, our prime concern was for public safety.
''So far as we are aware there have been no reported cases of
Legionnaires Disease and we are very pleased about this.''
Centre bosses say it will be regularly tested to avoid a repeat scare.

SO that was the Great Debate (February 13). Neither great nor debate
to my mind, but assertive, assumptive, and intellectually arid.
Our proposed leader in a devolved Scotland assured us that
independence would ruin Scotland's economy. Our proposed leader under
independence assured us our economy would soar in an independent
Scotland tied to Europe.
Not a figure, not a fact from either of them.
I am sick of being told categorically ''What the people of Scotland
want is'' and ''Only the people of Scotland can decide''.
Give us reasoned debate, backed up by verifiable facts, and then
listen to what we say, although until our voice can be heard through a
proportional method of voting it will hardly be a democratic decision.

FAR be it for me to spring to the aid of a Church of Scotland
committee, but Ruth Wishart, discussing the Kirk and sex, seems
oblivious to the fact that she is arguing her fashionable view of
morality against the Rev Bill Wallace who is, or should be, guided not
by fashion but by the teaching of the Bible. It is or should be argument
versus faith.
Bill Wallace, when he deplores that prostitutes are more and more
middle class, is not betraying bourgeois class-consciousness, he is
commenting that the motivation is not stark poverty but the acquisition
of a nicer car, a foreign holiday. This may well be ''a free, unfettered
decision'', which we may make on all manner of things, but does that
nullify morality? Do the ends justify the means?
I acknowledge the arguments for state-run brothels, but the Bible says
no; similarly with homosexuality as a valid life-style. You cannot
subsume Christianity under socialism, force its teachings into political
correctness. They are separate and distinct faiths. You take
Christianity, or any other religion with a spiritual dimension, or you
leave it. You do not trim religions to the prevailing orthodoxy.
On a different but fascinating point, is Edinburgh City Council,
taking taxes from licensed ''saunas'', living on immoral earnings?

YOUR industrial correspondent, Roy Rogers, gives the distinct
impression that there is an impending dispute over Scottish teachers'
pay (February 9).
In fact Scottish teachers have made a pay settlement with management
until April 1996. The situation he describes relates to England.
As a principal teacher in a large comprehensive school I have been
approached by some concerned parents who felt, as a consequence of your
coverage, that the immediate situation in Scottish schools was not as
settled as they had imagined.

SOLUTIONS to the small crossword on February 3 confirm that the clue
for No 20 across was intended to yield the fitting response
''Antarctic''.
We are happy, in this household, to recognise the Antarctic as a
continent but believe that the restless waters surrounding Antarctica
are known as the Southern Ocean, which is a confluence of the southern
reaches of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans.
The fourth ocean is the Arctic, surrounding the other pole.

RETURNING to my native Glasgow after a long time abroad I was struck
again by a very proud fact in Scottish life which is greatly to the
credit of our Victorian ancestors.
While most cities the world over erect monuments at the center of
their cities to warriors, Scotland's two leading cities have as their
centerpiece statues to the novelist Sir Walter Scott, a tribute surely
to the regard in which an artist could be held in those days.
As the occasion for my return to Scotland was to attend the sad
pageantry which attended the death of Sir Alexander Gibson, I was struck
by how deeply the city was affected by the death of this artist. Surely
no other man of the arts in this century has made such an impression on
the artistic life of his nation.
It would seem appropriate, therefore, to follow the example of the
Victorians and name a major Glasgow landmark in memory of the conductor
who brought international fame to the Royal Scottish National Orchestra
and international credit to Scotland through the creation of Scottish
Opera.
It would be appropriate to consider renaming the Glasgow Royal Concert
Hall the Alexander Gibson Hall to reflect his extraordinary influence on
the life of his country.

RUTH WISHART'S first contribution to the expanded Herald is
reminiscent of Sir Ian McKellen's now famous, or infamous, declaration
that he now tears out the pages of the Bible that refer to
homosexuality.
Presumably Sir Ian tears out the pages because he doesn't like the
Word of God interfering in his sinful, sordid practices. ''Keep out of
my private life,'' he is saying, in effect, to the scriptures.
''Keep out of our bedrooms,'' Ruth Wishart is saying. Familiar tones?
She seems to imagine that it is the Church that is interfering in the
private lives of men and women. It is nothing of the sort. It is the
plain teaching of the scriptures and it is the duty of the Church and or
individual Christians to bring the teaching of the Bible to bear upon
their fellow men and women whether the latter like it or not.
Ruth Wishart has touched upon a subject that is given pre-eminence in
the New Testament. She talks of the Church making sex matter more than
it does. She should consult the New Testament. It is clear there that
sexual sins are the most serious of all outwith the marital
relationship.
It is sad that Ruth Wishart does not seem to understand the nature of
the Church and its ministry. It is incumbent upon that institution to
propagate the teaching of scripture on such matters and, in my opinion,
should do more of it -- not less.
Thank God for the Board of Social Responsibility and all the good work
it does (which she freely acknowledges), but this is not the primary
task of the Church. Its primary task is to promote sound biblical
morality and spirituality.
William Booth and his Salvation Army excelled in social work but never
lost sight of the fact that their principal task was to save souls and
attack (not defend) immorality and spiritual ignorance wherever it was
to be found.

I WRITE as a rectory rebel, having read with sadness Jennifer
Cunningham's article, Unhappy families of the rich and famous (February
9).
Even though I am in my fifties I am often introduced to people as
''Canon Lyth's daughter'' and not as ''Miss Lyth'' or ''Margaret''. Do I
not exist in my own right?
As a child I was burdened by being expected not only to be an
ambassador for the family but for my father's profession, the Church,
and, following from that, for Christianity.
I was constantly told by parents, teachers, and other adults with whom
I came in contact that ''you should know better, your father is a
minister''.
I had to suppress my feelings. The stress and frustration of not being
allowed to be ''normal'' was traumatic.
Only when the eighth deadly sin of titillation is conquered will the
children of public figures be allowed to be themselves.

I HAVE the utmost sympathy for Mr Allan Stewart, Scottish Industry and
Local Government Minister, whose resignation was uncalled for and
unnecessary and yet shows that some politicians are not without honour.
I sleep with a pickaxe helve at my bedside; not, I hasten to add, to
belabour my wife but because although I am licensed to have firearms
they are strictly for sporting purposes and may not be used for self
defence however violent the aggression offered.
But how long before sportsmen, who hunt mainly for the pot, attract
the contumely of the mob in a country where mob rules?
Not long ago a boulder came crashing through the hatchback window of
my car parked outside my home.
The police, who came from 15 miles away, told me I'd been the victim
of assault, as had others. No-one has been apprehended so how safe can
anyone feel as anarchy, under whatever pretext, takes over?
Mr Stewart's gesture, magnificent though it was, serves no useful
purpose in a situation that demands that persons be able to go about
their lawful occasions peacefully, without molestation. The ballot box
is there for those who want to change the law and the lawmakers.
The rule of law is becoming increasingly vulnerable, and there are few
things more frightening than a mob out of control.
While the rule of law is in the balance, I'm hanging on to my trusty
pick helve -- and I don't fault Mr Stewart one little bit for playing
Horatius to Lars Porsena and the ranks of Eastwood's Tuscans.

WHEN I volunteered to fight for my country in 1940, first as a Local
Defence Volunteer and later as a fusilier in Ayrshire's RSF, I was not
asked what part of the country I wished to defend, so I ended up as a
paratrooper in the Far East.
The message, of course, is that some battles cannot be won without
''outsiders''.
With regard to the M77 protesters, it seems to me that people like
Allan Stewart, MP, appear to take the view that the fight to save the
earth's environment can be left to them alone and that ''outsiders'' are
not welcome unless they are road builders and hired mercenaries wielding
chainsaws, pickaxes, airguns, and well-chosen insults against protesters
like myself.
I was at Pollok Castle protest camp to demonstrate solidarity with the
young protesters who cannot see how the invasion of 53,000 fuel-pumping
vehicles a day through the woodlands in deprived areas like Corkerhill,
only 30 metres from the houses and children's play area, will benefit
the environment, far less the 400 young persons living there.

THE Highlands' two leading oil fabrication yards, Brown &amp; Root Ltd and
McDermott International, have reached agreement to merge.
The deal puts them in a stronger position to compete against the
fierce international competition for future North Sea and West of
Sheltand turnkey projects.
It comes at a time when UK yards are working at only 25% capacity.
Four months ago, a report said that the main reason UK yards were
unable to compete on a level playing-field was because of Government
policy.
The new joint venture company, to be called Brown &amp; Root McDermott
Fabricators Ltd, will operate as a North Sea fabrication facility for
turnkey and large topside projects.
Mr Norman Chambers, managing director of Brown &amp; Root Services in
Europe and Africa, said: ''The joint venture foresees a secure future
for Nigg and Ardersier with the partners committed to operating both
yards competitively and effectively.''
It is hoped that increased business and job opportunties will be
created by yards becoming more competitive, although intially some
redundancies among hourly-paid staff are expected.
The joint venture affects only the two yards. The Brown &amp; Root
pipeline bundle facility at Wick and the Nigg Oil Terminal, along with
McDermott's pipeline reeling facility at Ardersier, are excluded from
the deal.
More than 1000 people are employed at Nigg and 600 at Ardersier on
current projects, which will be completed by the joint venture.
The McDermott Scotland Ltd Ardersier yard and Brown &amp; Root's Hifab
yards were both established in 1972. Hifab has orders worth #105m on its
books and Ardersier has #23m.
Last night Mr Tony Mackay, of Mackay Consultants, Inverness, said:
''It really is a sensible move because the merger will remove a
substantial proportion of the excess capacity and it also means that
they will not be competing against each other for the same projects.
''It is not a question of saving jobs because the jobs have already
gone. It is really a question of how many will be taken on in the
future.''

PRIVATISATION was supposed to lead to a better railway system. Instead
we have cuts in services, higher fares, loss of network advantages, no
investment, and massive bureaucracy.
Predictions of reduced safety standards and increased inconvenience to
rail users are proving to be correct.
Up to 600 ScotRail jobs -- 15% of the 4100-strong workforce -- are
threatened in a ''worst-case scenario'' because the Scottish shadow
franchise has been ordered to find 5% of cost savings.
Following a #400m cut in Government funding announced in the November
budget, BR needs to cut its costs by 10% overall. It has warned that
that could involve closing down the least busy 4000 miles of the
9000-mile passenger network. Weekend trains and off-peak services will
be slashed in the May timetables, stations are being closed, and train
capacities reduced.
We estimate that the budget shortfall could lead to a reduction of
one-third in BR staffing levels with more depot closures and job losses
for train drivers.
The Government has spent over #700m preparing for the sell-off, on
management consultants, merchant bankers, accountants, brokers, and
other financial advisers, solicitors, and public relations firms.
That #700m would have provided 57 new InterCity trains or 13 major
signalling systems; modernised the west coast main line to Glasgow and
the West of Scotland; or electrified from Edinburgh to Aberdeen seven
times over.
Instead we have no new orders for trains or equipment and job losses
in Derby, Doncaster, York, Loughborough, and Crewe.
The Central Users' Consultative Committee is forced to demand proper
consultation because the so-called statutory minimum passenger service
requirements announced by Roger Salmon, the franchise director, provide
no requirement for sleeper services from London to Carlisle and Fort
William and Plymouth to Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Cash-strapped BR plans to withdraw these services and combine the
remaining London-Scotland sleeper services to just two trains.
Similar lack of support for Motorail, which carries passengers and
their cars from London and Bristol to Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen,
Inverness, and Fort William, means these services will end on May 28.
Five of the 12 Scotland to London services on the west coast main line
are sleeper trains. Any cut-backs could raise doubts about the future of
the line. The Inverness/Fort William sleeper is vital to the economy of
the Highlands region, both for business users and tourism.
We must campaign to protect these routes. We must also demand proper
grant funding of trains run by the Strathclyde Passenger Transport
Executive.
If the Government refuses to give the SPTE a positive commitment to
long-term viability, the SPTE cannot enter a seven-year franchise
agreement to maintain its services or invest to develop the Strathclyde
network.
Following the tragedies at Bellgrove in March 1989 and Newton in July
1991, more accidents underline the lack of investment in up-to-date and
reliable safety equipment.
The criminal cost-cutting attached to privatisation includes the
shelving of automatic train protection (ATP) which Aslef believes could
have prevented accidents -- including Clapham, Bellgrove, and Newton --
in which 48 people were killed and over 1000 injured in the past five
years.
Lack of new trains means the programmes for installing cab radios (due
to be completed by 1992) and data recorders have also been delayed. No
new stock means dangerous overcrowding continues on many busy commuter
lines.
The Government's priority is maximum profitability and minimum cost
for Railtrack and the train operators. So safety is being subjugated to
all manner of commercial considerations.
John Swift, the rail regulator, decrees that passengers may have to
travel up to 50 miles to buy a ticket, suggesting that the number of
stations offering through-ticket facilities can be reduced, as a
cost-saving, from 1580 to only 294.
This will lead to widespread automation of the remaining local ticket
sales, further destaffing of stations, unattended and potentially
dangerous platforms.
The deception over through-ticketing is typical of pre-privatisation
promises broken by this Government. What future now for discount fares,
for travel cards, young persons' and pensioners' tickets, off-peak
family fares?
The Government deceit machine says these services will be supplemented
by ''commercially responsive'' additional trains, run at the discretion
of the new operators.
In fact we can kiss the social railway goodbye. No additional services
will be provided if they are not economically viable. No profit-oriented
private operator is going to spend his own money doing more than he has
to do.
We can expect the system to be run down, particularly in remote rural
areas (in Scotland, rural Wales, East Anglia, the North). Now the
sell-off is being manipulated by financial juggling over Railtrack's
track. Gatwick Express is charged out at 6p per passenger mile;
Thameslink at 7p per passenger mile; but train operators on ScotRail,
the North-east and North-west of England will have to pay three or four
times this amount -- 17p to 28p per passenger mile.
Even this sleight of hand has not attracted sufficient interest from
private operators. So Mr Swift has instructed Railtrack to bring in
#1500m less in track charges over the next six years.
Making the franchises cheaper to run will damage Railtrack's sell-off
value (and they want Railtrack in the private sector by 1996).
But Railtrack has other major assets: 71,000 hectares of land; #12bn
worth of stations, #10.5bn worth of pensions, etc, so there could still
be a killing for the cherry pickers. No fortune to be made in running a
socially responsive, safe, efficient railway; plenty if you rip off the
profitable parts and finance a pre-election tax bonanza in the process.
For all our sakes, it is time privatisation was stopped in its tracks.

ON the anniversary of the bombing of Dresden it is perhaps appropriate
to mention the efforts of some pupils from Glasgow (February 13).
At Hutchesons' Grammar School some students of German have given part
of their pocket money this month to the rebuilding of the Frauenkirche,
Dresden's most famous cathedral.
In doing so, our younger generation hopes to make a distinctive
contribution in memory of the hundreds of thousands who died in aerial
bombardment everywhere, including London, Coventry, and Clydebank.
This is no political gesture. It is merely a donation made by the
young in the hope that never again will the evil and destruction
perpetrated by all sides during the Second World War be allowed to
happen again in Europe.
We should all hope that the reconstruction of the Frauenkirche in
Dresden should stand in witness to all people's determination to create
a Europe in which all people can forever live together in harmony.

SHERIFF Neil Gow is to be congratulated on the speed with which he has
delivered judgment on the drug deaths of three youths at Ayr's Hanger 13
club. Similar urgency should be shown by the Scottish Office in
preparing legislation which will allow proper licensing of rave clubs
like the one in which the deaths occurred. At this point there might be
an audible groan from our younger readers who discern a typical
middle-aged desire to legislate out of existence anything which
youngsters enjoy. This would be understandable, but unfair. Teenagers do
enjoy raves. Those who argue for them describe raves as basically
friendly gatherings at which violence is at a minimum. A huge outdoor
rave in Edinburgh last year attracted 16,000 people and there was no
discernible violence. Teenagers attend raves to have fun by dancing
rather than by paying for a more passive type of entertainment provided
by others. But if they are lively and energetic, they can also be
inordinately lengthy affairs and it is at this juncture that serious
problems arise.
The first point to emphasise is that the presence of drugs like
ecstasy at raves is utterly unacceptable. Unfortunately raves and
ecstasy, in particular, are linked closely for reasons which, though
understandable in the correct sense, cannot be condoned. Raves involve
teenagers dancing for lengthy periods to very fast music. They quickly
become tired and the unnatural antidote to tiredness is ecstasy. Unlike
alcohol, ecstasy does not make you argumentative or violent. Its effect
is to galvanise the system thereby allowing extreme physical activity
for long periods. This masks from the conscious mind the effects of
extreme exhaustion and the ultimate result can be collapse and death.
For this reason the initial point of legislation should be strictly to
curtail the length of time for which raves run, thereby reducing the
need for stimulants like ecstasy.
The numbers attending should be reduced because this will make the
events easier to monitor. Sheriff Gow's suggestion that stewards should
move through the crowds looking for drugs makes eminent sense. Most
importantly, he focused on the work of the police and of schools in
educating youngsters in the dangers of drugs. It is startling, for
parents and children alike, to discover how available drugs of various
sorts are to the youngest and most vulnerable of youngsters. Education
is the principal antidote, together with responsible attitudes from
parents. The problem is, of course, of considerable antiquity. Human
society has always had difficulties enjoying itself without
consciousness-altering substances. The middle-aged should bear in mind
the effect of their own gin-and-tonic or lager, and also recall that if
alcohol was invented today it would most likely be a class one banned
drug in weeks. None of this is to alter the seriousness of the situation
addressed by Sheriff Gow, or of the sense and gravity of his
conclusions. Hypocrisy, though, should be avoided.

TAKE any group of National Health Service workers, or at least those
not hopelessly thirled to the present political dispensation in the NHS,
sit them down and ask them what the service needs. The answers will be
many and varied. Ask them what the NHS does not need and matters will
become clearer. The National Health Service does not need more upheaval
and chaos. This is a message which the Labour Party, which remains the
likeliest governmental candidate for running the NHS in the medium
future, must take to heart. Labour policy on the NHS is still evolving,
which is a euphemistic way of saying it still has some way to go. Those
who have listened to the emollient Mr Tony Blair on the subject have an
impression of caution, perhaps even verging on a softening of some
attitudes. The Scottish Labour Party, like the veteran warhorse it is,
has snuffled at the political wind from the south and has caught a whiff
of this alien scent. That is why the Scottish Labour Party chairman, Mr
Jim Devine, was so notably outspoken in Cupar this week when he insisted
that Labour was committed to abolishing all NHS trusts and democratising
the NHS.
Mr Devine and plain speaking go together, like catheter and pain. Our
Scottish Political Correspondent reported that his unequivocal treatment
of a number of health issues in his Cupar speech appeared to indicate an
uneasiness with the position being adopted by the modernisers in London.
This matter requires clarification. Mr Devine promises that NHS trusts
will be abolished and that they will be integrated back into the control
of democratically elected health boards. Labour Party headquarters in
London insists that trust status will be removed from hospitals and that
the boards which run them will be made accountable to the public which
they serve. In essence, the apparent differences between Mr Devine and
London appear to boil down to a different use of language; policy
differences, thus far at least, appear to be minimal if present at all.
Nevertheless, the Labour Party, both in Scotland and England, must take
care to use the same words, and indeed the same tone, when addressing
this most delicate of subjects.
Labour policy on the NHS is, as we have already indicated, in the
process of being formed. Much of the detail should be in place by the
time of the party conference later this year when a policy document will
be launched. The length of time between the present and the issuing of
the document could pose problems. Although a General Election is not due
soon, is not likely, and, indeed, if fought on the issue of English
nationalism and Europe, is not wanted, it might still happen. If the
Labour Party does not have sensible and detailed policies to put before
the public on the subject of the NHS it will be in considerable
difficulties, despite the Nolan Committee's increasingly evident
unhappiness with Government offers of reform on nepotism. And yet a rush
to paste together ill-considered notions on how to proceed would be just
as damaging. Labour must think hard about how to democratise the NHS,
restore accountability, and improve morale and service, yet this must be
done without undue disruption of the working patterns of NHS personnel
who have been stretched to breaking point and beyond by the ideological
vandalism of recent years. Healing, as any NHS worker will tell you, is
a gradual process, especially if it is to last. Think deeply, speak
carefully, and ca' canny must be the watchwords.

A DOUNREAY worker is feared to have breathed in plutonium after a dust
leak.
Six other workers at the Caithness nuclear reprocessing plant are also
undergoing health checks after the spray of radiaoactive dust was
accidently released into the air.
The leak yesterday prompted a call for an immediate halt to
reprocessing activities at the site.
But the Atomic Energy Authority at Dounreay claim the incident was
minor and that no risk is posed to the public or the environment.
The seven employees will remain at work while they undergo tests.
An internal probe is under way into the incident which occurred in the
plant where fuel from Dounreay's mothballed fast reactor is reprocessed.
The weekend leak triggered off radiation alarms and led to the people
being evacuated from the affected area.
Atomic Energy Authority spokesman Ian Shepherd said that the leak had
been unscheduled and had been a fiftieth of what the site is permitted
to discharge in a year.
But he added: ''There was never any danger to the public.''
The Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping organisation yesterday called for
an immediate end to reprocessing at Dounreay.
Spokeswoman Lorraine Mann said that the release of plutonium may
already have swept across large parts of the Highlands and Islands.
''It is time to stop the insanity which puts workers and the public at
risk,'' she said.
''This is the latest in a series of mishaps.''

Under stress: as demands of modern-day working take their toll, some
employers are at last recognising the danger of pressures that have
created a dangerously divided nation
BALANCING the competing demands of work and home is becoming one of
the major British pre-occupations of the 1990s. Suddenly there is an
awareness that millions of working women and men are trying to squeeze a
quart into a pint pot too often and the price in terms of stress and
overwork is, in a word, breakdown. That breakdown is occurring at all
levels: individual, family, society.
But while the phenomenon is discussed ad nauseum at the dining table
and in the cosy seclusion of the pub, it barely gets a mention in the
boardroom. On the contrary, British companies, haunted by the imagery of
an aggressive global market, seem hell-bent on ''getting more out of
their people'', regardless of human or social cost.
Joanna Foster believes it is time they thought again. And this week at
a lecture in Glasgow, she tried to hit them where it hurts them most: in
the pocket.
''Old working practices and management assumptions from 20 or 30 years
ago are now seriously damaging Britain's international competitiveness
while at the same time significantly contributing to some of the major
social problems of our time,'' she told her audience at the first of the
annual Town and Gown Lectures at Strathclyde University. The lectures
are sponsored by The Herald.
Mrs Foster knows a lot about the management and mismanagement of
change. As chair of the Equal Opportunities Commission between 1988 to
1993, she grappled with the fate of women entering the workplace and
trying to fight their way up the ladder. Then last year she moved to
chair the UK Council of the United Nations International Year of the
Family.
This was a natural progression, she says, because although the entry
of women into the workplace in huge numbers may be the predominant
change in British working life in the past 20 years, this in itself has
created problems for husbands and for children.
Also, changes in the nature of the global economy, in new technology,
and in personal relationships are creating a level of stress in society
which touches all of us, not just women.
Of course, it is too easy, too simplistic, to blame the rising divorce
rate, violence in families, alcoholism, delinquency and disorder on
outmoded working practices and she doesn't. But she says: ''There's a
considerable quantity of research that clearly shows a traceable link.''
Is it surprising that 30% of sick leave is related to stress, anxiety
or depression, when British men have the longest working hours in Europe
(100 hours a year more than Germany) or when women continue to do most
of the housework, even when both partners are in full-time employment?
A mix of societal and economic pressures have been gathering in pace
quite frighteningly in the past 20 years, says Foster. For example, in
1973, only 43% of couples with children had both partners in employment.
By 1992 this figure was 60% and nearly half of mothers with pre-school
children are working today, compared with about a quarter 15 years ago.
And yet at the same time men are working harder too. One in three men
now works a six or seven-day week.
''Within Britain's commercial life,'' says Foster, ''increasing stress
is being imposed on individuals working even longer hours and with a
decreasing sense of security in their own careers. This is being
compounded by the family problems that flow in part from a decreasing
amount of time spent with the family.
''There develops a symbiotic relationship between the problems of
family and the problems of work -- the long hours, the tiredness, the
lack of time to develop and maintain personal relationships, the
recurrent stress-related illness that employers everywhere are beginning
to notice and the palliatives like alcohol that are sought to relieve
that stress are economic as well as social problems.''
The ''demographic time bomb'' accentuates the problem as more and more
adults become sandwiched between children still in the nest and elderly
parents in need of care. (By 2021 nearly 20% of the British population
will be over 65. Already about one-and-a-half million people, mostly
women, are caring for someone else for more than 20 hours a week.)
''Changing patterns of working life are impacting on the quality of
family life. Families are very busy; no wonder relationships are under
pressure,'' she says.
New technology should make communications easier. Instead, says
Foster, it is making them more complex: ''How often do we try to get
hold of friends and only get the answer phone? You can't sit down as a
family because the kids are upstairs playing computer games or watching
Neighbours. At work people communicate by Email. It may be wonderful not
to have meetings but how can people relate to each other if they don't
even meet?''
Foster also outlines a parallel trend which she finds equally
disturbing, namely the remorseless rise of unemployment, particularly
hidden unemployment which rose from 9% to 18% between 1977 and 1991:
''What we have here is an emerging picture of a dangerously divided
nation -- a majority of the workforce engaged in longer and longer hours
in their employment, with a small but significant proportion of the
population being wholly squeezed out of the productive labour force.''
She concludes that major underlying changes at home and at work are
combining to produce increases in stress and consequent health, social
and financial problems. The ultimate price is a decline in the
well-being of our society, or as she puts it ''a nation clearly not at
ease with itself where families are not at ease with themselves''.
Although her thesis sounds gloomy, Foster insists that there is
nothing inevitable about this process. ''Enlightened companies around
the world -- those that recognise the growing cost of employment
practices that contribute to family breakdown -- are becoming involved
in a variety of new family-friendly employment practices.''
These include flexible working practices such as job-sharing,
term-time working and career breaks. ''They are recognising that
reasonable working hours can make a direct contribution to health,
happiness, motivation, creativity, and productivity,'' says Foster.
One such company is Levi Strauss. This corporate giant employs 22,000
people in the US and a further 4000 in Europe, including more than 1400
(mostly women) in Scotland, largely at the two production plants at
Whitburn in West Lothian and Dundee. Two years ago they carried out a
European survey among their workforce about the relationship between
work and personal life.
A spokesman said:''As a company we need to keep a strong competitive
advantage. Wherever we open a plant we want to be the employer of
choice. This means we have to be aware of the pressures on people. We
need to create a flexible working environment, so that people can
balance work with family life.'' The philosophy behind the policy is
that a cheerful and committed workforce makes sound commercial sense.
Sadly, such companies are rare. As Joanna Foster reminded her audience
this week, recent research by the Government's women into business
initiative, Opportunity 2000, shows that such is the climate of fear and
job insecurity in most UK companies today that when they do try to
introduce family-friendly practices such as term-time working and
job-sharing, there are few takers.
Instead, the trend is towards longer working hours and less holidays.
Foster believes we are paying a heavy price for this, not just in terms
of individual happiness but also as an economy and a nation as well.
Case History:
ALAN is a top salesman in one of Britain's largest companies. He is
married with two young children. When you meet him he comes across as a
well-balanced, bright, fit, articulate young man with a big future. But
in December Alan suffered his second nervous breakdown in two years:
''The workforce in our company is down to about half what it was four
years ago. That's when we had the first restructuring. There used to be
lots of people looking after the mail, taking calls and helping with
research but they disappeared overnight and we had to do it ourselves.
The organisation was changing so fast that you'd forever be phoning
someone about something and find they didn't handle it any more.
''I ended up as a one-man operation. In our company now you need to
have 100 people reporting to you before you qualify for a PA. The
information flows are incredible. I've got a business line, a fax, and a
computer line at home and I'm on two electronic mail systems. I also
have two call answering services, a mobile phone in the car, an office
telephone and an office fax. I have to keep an eye on all of them. Often
I get 30 messages a day. In the old days someone would filter the calls
and mail.
''I used to cover the Glasgow area but now they've reorganised it so
that I cover a particular group of clients all over the UK. The
advantage for the company is that you get to know your clients and your
particular market very well which is good for sales. The disadvantage
for the individual is that you're dashing all over the country. I'd be
in Kent one day and Aberdeen the next. I'd be travelling two or three
days a week, doing 12 or 14 hours every day.
''I began to find it difficult to think clearly. I felt I was never in
the right place. When I was at work, I felt I ought to be at home. When
I was at home, I felt I needed a game of golf. When I was on the golf
course I felt I ought to be in the office. Things started to fall apart
a bit at home. I couldn't sleep. I lost all feelings of affection. I
became very selfish. Then the hallucinations started. I'd look at
someone and see someone completely different. I became paranoid. I was
sure everyone was out to get me.''
After the breakdown he spent several days in a mental hospital and six
weeks off work. ''The same thing happened to three or four others in my
office. They'd come back after weeks off and say they'd had a viral
infection or something but then they'd admit to me that the whole thing
had fallen in on them.
''Eventually the company's chief medical officer went to the board and
said the level of stress among employees was unacceptably high. The
response was to set up an employee effectiveness unit which pays for up
to four counselling sessions but I don't think the company is tackling
the problem properly.
''I started working mostly from home because I couldn't stand the
cynicism and negativism in the office. People would come up to you and
say: 'You'll never believe what they've done now.'
''When I went back the first time my boss was very sympathetic. He
said he'd work me back in gently. I started a different job and I felt
my life was in balance but then the pressures started to build up again.
There was another restructuring. The people I'd been answerable to in
Scotland had been relatively easy-going. Then all of a sudden I was
having to work through London. These guys were hard Thatcherite types.
Psychologically I started to go downhill again. This time clinical
depression was diagnosed.
''It would be very difficult for me to go back into the office. The
attitude of younger people is 'This wouldn't happen to me'. I want to
say to them that I used to think that too. I had six very successful
years.''
Alan considers himself lucky in some ways. ''I felt totally out of
control. I can imagine guys becoming alcoholics or getting into drugs.
But my wife has helped me a lot. We've had our ups and downs but I think
we've talked it through and come out stronger. In fact, I think we're
inseparable now.''

IT was like making a quantum leap for Mr Nick Couts, an auctioneer's
toy specialist, when his eyes fell on the parade of 66 lead soldiers
dating from 1909, among them a contingent of Gordon Highlanders in red
jackets and kilts.
The rare set was so familiar that Mr Couts felt he was transported
back two decades and the toys were once again sprawled over the carpet
in a school friend's home.
0  By a strange coincidence, the small army he was asked to appraise,
for a client of Phillips of Scotland in Edinburgh, turned out to be the
very same soldiers he and a friend had played with as young boys in
Gullane, East Lothian.
From the scrapes and scratches he recognised on the bygone warriors,
he could tell they were exactly the same ones.
It was confirmed when he saw the particulars of the client, who wanted
them included in a toy sale scheduled for April.
Mr Couts expects the set to fetch between #1000 and #1500. As well as
the Highlanders, it includes groups of dragoons and hussars, plus horses
and a field-gun unit, along with an ammunition-carrying limber.

The scent of a Labour election victory promises a rolling-back of the
market-led reforms of the NHS -- but doctors and nurses who fought the
reforms are weary at the prospect of another upheaval
HEALTH workers' leaders who have spent the past six years fighting
Thatcherite reforms were lukewarm yesterday at the thought of another
major upheaval.
Scottish Labour Party chairman Jim Devine, a senior organiser with
Unison, the public sector union, stirred these mixed feelings on Tuesday
night when he reinforced his party's intention to do away with NHS
trusts and GP fund-holding.
With the scent of an election victory in the air, there was
apprehension at the thought of the sixth major reorganisation since
1982.
There was also some questioning as to whether Mr Devine was speaking
with a more radical tone than that being taken up by Tony Blair's new
regime at Labour's Walworth Road HQ.
The party, however, reaffirmed its commitment to undo the key features
of the Thatcher reforms, and it and Mr Devine moved to reassure health
workers and patients that they were not going to be picked up once more
and shaken around.
Mr Devine spelled the future out clearly for current non-executive
members of NHS trusts -- appointed directly by the Secretary of State --
when Labour moves in, it will be time for them to move out and make way
for democratically elected representatives.
A Labour Party spokesman said: ''We will abolish trusts. That doesn't
mean we are going to demolish the hospitals -- as some people seem to
think -- but remove trust status.
''We will replace fund-holding GP practices with joint-commissioning
groups.
''We do not believe there should be a market in the NHS. We don't want
competition between hospitals.
''We are looking at ways of replacing Tory placemen. There is a
consultation exercise and we will be reporting on it in June.
''We are trying to find the best way of making people accountable. It
is not our intention to cause chaos in the NHS. It has not reached a
state of stability as it is. But we have priorities and one priority is
removing the market system.
''The Labour Party is committed to removing trust status and
fund-holding. We want to do it as smoothly as possible without too much
chopping and changing. Some levels of bureaucracy are re-designated
nurses and they would continue doing their jobs, although they are a
minority.''
The British Medical Association pointed out that it had opposed the
reforms. It also spent a lot of money campaigning against the changes.
Many things it had warned would happen had happened -- but the BMA
appears concerned about any attempt to turn things upside down and start
again, claiming that morale was very low at present in the NHS, and
reversing the reform process could lower morale even further.
Its Scottish Secretary, Dr Brian Potter, questioned whether Mr Devine
was in step with his English colleagues. He said: ''The messages we are
getting from Labour in England are not of such a radical nature. They
have a document coming out before the party conference so we will know
more then. We got the impression from them that there was not going to
be a major upheaval.
''One of the points Jim Devine made was about the democratisation of
the boards, and we would have no problem with that at all. The close
involvement of the local community is important and we support that.
''But the last thing we need is a major overhaul of the system. People
are just picking themselves off the ground and it would be just ghastly
if they had to go through another re-organisation . . . I can just hear
the gasps of horror at the very thought. We don't want another
ideology-driven review.
''We do want to identify problems and put them right. Setting the
hospital resources as one trust against another is not something we
support. We want to see sensible co-operation to provide a health
service. The money was supposed to follow the patient but instead the
patients have been following the money, until it has dried up.
''As far as fund-holding is concerned, we are certainly against
anything that produces a two-tier service. The Government has maintained
that this would be a levelling-up process but that has not always been
the picture.
''The accountants have taken over; people have been wandering in after
working in linoleum factories and trying to run the health service on
the same lines.
''We are not against good management, focused on what the job in hand
is. A lot of the market sits easier on the surgical operation, which can
be costed accurately; when it's done, it's done. But the vast majority
of the work in the NHS is caring, and dealing with diseases that don't
always go away.''
Scottish Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, Ms June Andrews,
echoed the BMA's view: ''There are certain aspects of the NHS that are
of great concern to us -- like the proposal for local pay, and
short-term contracts that offer no commitment -- and if Labour could
find a way of swiftly doing away with all that, it would be welcome.
''There are other aspects of the trust system that are okay, or at
least do no harm, and the idea of going through another upheaval for
ideological reasons would be disturbing. Any change should be
incremental.
''Jim Devine does not make clear what they are going to replace the
trusts with. If they replace the bad things and keep the good things
no-one would complain. It is interesting but we need more details.''
However Mr Devine explained: ''We totally agree with the BMA -- we
have had five major reforms in the NHS since 1982. The last thing we
need is another major re-organisation.
''But one good thing about the present structure is that it does lend
itself to democratic control. It is a very simple step to remove
non-executive board members and replace them with people who are
accountable to the community they serve.
''We are, after all, looking at #2400m of public money every year.
They would be accountable for that but would have the power to determine
the priorities of their area.
''But we are not going to go through the upheaval we had over the
introduction of trusts. You can see trusts that are maybe half-a-mile
apart and they are competitors. We want to bring back the kind of
co-operative NHS that does not exist now.''
The introduction of ''filtering'' committees for appointing trust
members, first by the Scottish Office and then, this week, by Health
Secretary Virginia Bottomley, are seen as a response to the criticism
that Labour has mounted over the packing of health quangos with ''Tory
placemen''.
One of Labour's first acts will be to ask for the resignations of the
current non-executive members of trusts.
''The people from our side who have accepted seats under the current
regime are committed to resigning and offering themselves for the
democratic process when Labour takes over,'' said Mr Devine. ''The rest
will be expected to do likewise.''

A RACE against time to save the life of an injured climber, trapped on
Lochnagar for 23 hours, failed yesterday despite heroic attempts by
mountain rescue teams and helicopter crews.
Throughout the day, more than 50 rescuers battled against winds
gusting to 100mph, snow, and hill fog to reach Roger Chippendale, 28,
from Aviemore.
He had been injured and trapped on a ledge after falling 200ft through
a cornice on one of the most inaccessible gullies on the north face of
the 3700ft mountain.
The weather conditions were so bad that a Sea King helicopter was
repeatedly driven back in its attempts to reach Mr Chippendale, who fell
on Tuesday afternoon while climbing with his friend Mr Christopher
Forrest, 34, of Glenmore Lodge.
In spite of his injuries, Mr Chippendale was able to cut out a ledge
on which to shelter in Parallel Gully B, and was able to secure himself
by a rope. Mr Forrest, unable to reach him, climbed out and raised the
alarm.
Members of Grampian police mountain rescue team were eventually able
to climb down to Mr Chippendale at dusk yesterday afternoon, but found
no sign of life. He was stretchered off the mountain and a doctor
declared him dead.
Mr Chippendale was the third victim of the hills in two days.
Twenty-four hours earlier the body of Glasgow walker Allan Sands,
missing for four days, was found above Glencoe, and rescuers recovered
the body of Evesham student Martin Rayner, 22, from Ben Nevis.
Mountain rescue teams had tried to reach Mr Chippendale on Tuesday
night, but conditions were so bad that at one stage they had to withdraw
and shelter in snowholes they had dug for themselves.
They persevered throughout yesterday, starting at dawn, and were
joined by members of the RAF Leuchars team who were taken part of the
way in by helicopter. Eventually they reached Mr Chippendale.
The rescue teams carried Mr Chippendale's body out via Geldershiel, a
shelter used by members of the royal family when they are in residence
at Balmoral.
Mr Chippendale, of Dalfaber Cottages, Aviemore, has been a regular
visitor to the mountains for a number of years. After working in the
Middle East, the bachelor Englishman moved permanently to Aviemore last
month.
Neighbour Adrian Wilmott, 21, a water sports instructor at
Coylumbridge Hotel, near Aviemore, said Mr Chippendale was a ''very
experienced climber who spent every spare minute on his beloved
mountains.''
Only last week Mr Chippendale successfully completed a gruelling
five-day course based at Glenmore Lodge, Scotland's National Outdoor
Training Centre, in the foothills of the Cairngorms.
The course, under the aegis of the Scottish Mountain Leader Training
Board, is for experienced climbers.
It involved two lengthy day trips, testing mountaineering skills in
winter conditions. Three days and nights were spent on an expedition
that included digging snow-holes for overnight shelter.
Only 60 persons go through the course each winter, and it permits the
''graduate'' to take out parties in winter conditions.
Mr Chippendale's landlord, Mr Alex Carmichael, said he was ''a most
personable chap'' who was very familiar with the Scottish mountains.

New York, Wednesday
THE daughter of Deng Xiaoping said her father was now a ''totally
retired old person'' and rejected claims that, at 90, he still holds
final authority in China.
Deng Rong, in New York to promote the her biography of her father,
told a news conference that he had one dream left -- to visit Hong Kong
when it reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
Asked about reports that her father was in a coma, she said she had a
friend in Hong Kong who kept track of the number of times her father had
been reported seriously ill or even dead.
''The number was up to 365. This is the 366th report,'' she said
adding his health was fine for a man his age.
Her book, Deng Xiaoping -- My father, is published in English by Basic
Books, which is owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch.
She said of published by him: ''If I am going to get my book published
in a capitalist society I have to have a capitalist
publisher.''--Reuter.

Hong Kong, Wednesday
THE Hong Kong government has so much money it could abolish income tax
for the next four years or give each baby born in 1995 a #115,000 start
in life, an international accountancy firm said today.
Accountants Price Waterhouse forecast today that years of budget
surpluses meant the British colony's outgoing Financial Secretary Sir
Hamish Macleod could make his mark by doing the unthinkable in his
annual budget speech on March 1.
''With approximately $HK100 billion (#8.25bn) more in reserves than he
needs to meet Hong Kong's obligations to China in 1997, the financial
secretary could make his mark in history by giving it away,'' Price
Waterhouse said.
He could pay a #10,000 bonus to everyone over 60, give each newlywed
couple a #150,000 wedding present in the next year, or abolish corporate
tax for two years.
However, the accountants concluded with the confident prediction that
Sir Hamish would announce no such measures.--Reuter.

Sydney, Wednesday
CLAIMS of Australian cowardice during the Japanese invasion of
Singapore were false, an Australian historian said today, the 53rd
anniversary of the fall of the former British colony.
Historian Lynette Silver announced the findings of her research as
veterans of Australia's Eighth Division laid a wreath at a Sydney
cenotaph to honour the hundreds of Australians who died trying to defend
Singapore in 1942.
British accusations of mass cowardice, desertion, and drunkenness by
members of the Eighth Division were unearthed from war archives two
years ago, provoking a national outcry and prompting Silver to
investigate the documents.
She dismissed the allegations today as groundless and said they were
contained in mostly anonymous statements by British officers upset at
the loss of Singapore during the Second World War.
Silver said she spent months trying to verify the accusations,
visiting Singapore, and scouring war archives.
Australian front-line troops were obeying orders when they retreated
and allegations that Australians ran from battle and got drunk at a
local club were based on rumours, she told state radio.
Some troops who were routed by the Japanese retreated to the club
because it was ''the only place they knew'', she said.
''The rumour went around that this whole group of Australians had
deserted and all run back into Singapore city,'' she said, adding that a
claim that Australians shot dead a British naval captain was an
''absolute fabrication''.
The dead captain's son handed her documents showing the captain was
still alive days after the alleged murder.
Senior British officers had command over the Australians in the

''It's provided the truth,'' former soldier Wal Mariner said after
laying a wreath to the 2000 Australians who died fighting in Malaya.
''It was an insult not only to we survivors but to those who did not
survive,'' said Mariner. ''It was a humiliation and unjust.''
Prime Minister Paul Keating angrily dismissed the allegations two
years ago as Britain's attempt to find a scapegoat for ''the British
Empire's most humiliating debacle''.--Reuter.

A CHILD may have been killed by a virus too small to detect even in a
laboratory, Linlithgow Sheriff Court was told yesterday.
Just a few of the organisms would have been enough to give
18-month-old Claire Davison a fatal dose of poisoning from the E-coli
0157 virus.
The court heard the virus would have stayed almost dormant in milk
drunk by Claire before bursting into frantic growth once in the warm,
moist conditions in her stomach.
Mr Robert Haston and his wife Margaret, owners of the Redhouse Dairy
in Blackburn, deny three charges under the Food Safety Act alleging they
supplied milk unfit for consumption by being contaminated with the
virus.
Microbiologist Dr John Coia told the court he had not been surprised
by the failure of his laboratory at Edinburgh's Western General Hospital
to find the virus in milk samples taken from the dairy.
He stated: ''It is well recognised this organism is very difficult to
isolate in food. It is looking for a very small needle in a very large
haystack. Just two organisms per gram of food can infect a patient.''
A total of 69 people were hit by the bug in West Lothian in May and
June last year. Claire, from Bathgate, died and six youngsters needed
kidney dialysis. Two are still receiving treatment.
The trial continues.

MORE than 50 parents and children staged an angry protest outside a
meeting of Central Regional Council's education committee yesterday over
plans to close schools for children with special needs.
The 35-pupil Whins of Milton school in Stirling was earmarked for
closure in 1997/98 in a review of special needs education tabled by the
council's education director, Ms Maggi Allan.
The region would like to see the teaching of children with special
needs -- such as Down's syndrome -- taking place in special units within
mainstream schools.
Parents from Dawson Park and Rossvail special needs schools in Falkirk
joined the protest.
The primary section of Dawson Park school is scheduled to close in the
next school year, while Rossvail is earmarked to close towards the end
of the century.
In a statement, education committee convener, Mr Rob Ball, said the
council hoped to press ahead with plans to relocate the primary
department of Dawson Park into two mainstream primary schools -- but he
promised full consultation.
The committee also agreed to consultation on the future of Whins of
Milton and Rossvail.
Council leader, Mr Corrie McChord, said the administration wanted to
be flexible. He said: ''We're not prepared to concede on the principle
of integration; what we will concede on is the pace and range of
integration.''
SNP councillor, Mr Walter McAdam, who supports the parents, said that
while integration was of benefit to a large number of children with
special needs, others would always do best in separate schools.

A NEW bout of a political fight over a sewage treatment plant broke
out yesterday.
It stemmed from Kyle and Carrick District Council's vote by 11 to nine
to refuse planning permission for Strathclyde Regional Council's move to
establish the treatment works at Greenan.
The decision leaves the regional council with a dilemma: appeal to
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang -- a costly and time-consumming move -- or
concentrate on other projects, leaving Ayrshire with its notorious dirty
beaches.
Yesterday, unsually tight-lipped Strathclyde officials refused to
indicate their next move.
However, Councillor Ian Welsh, Leader of the Labour Group on Kyle and
Carrick District Council, did speak out.
He claimed to have good grounds for believing the region would lodge
an appeal.
He said: ''The process will now inevitably be dragged out. That is why
this sorry situation is so scandalous for the people in this area.''
Mr Welsh claimed that some Conservative councillors had voted against
the planning officials' recommendation for a sewage treatment plant at
Greenan for ''political ends''.
''I have not a shadow of doubt that there will be an appeal against
this refusal and that the region will be successful.
in that appeal,'' added Mr Welsh.
''It is our own government responding to national obligations to get
our beaches cleaned who are insisting on this.
''National guidelines on planning apply in this instance.
''This pip-squeak and divided administration is holding its own
government to ransom and the populace in Kyle and Carrick, outside
Greenan, are the hostages.''
However, the Conservative MP for Ayr, Mr Phil Gallie, applauded the
district council's decision as''absolutely logical and right''.
He added: ''It was absolute stupidity for Strathclyde to have decided
in the first place to go for that particular site.
''They closed their minds to other options. I do not blame the
officials or the engineers, I totally blame the politicians.
''It is very sad that my constituents will be deprived of a
long-overdue facility.''

New Delhi, Wednesday
BOARD of Trade President Michael Heseltine today rounded off a two-day
visit to India in which he lobbied for British business and signalled a
big push to invest in India.
''I am delighted that I was able to witness the signing of a contract
of Indian Oil with Rolls Royce,'' he told a news conference.
Rolls Royce signed a #20m contract with the state-run Indian Oil
Corporation to supply pipeline equipment.
Two other deals were signed by British companies during the visit,
which coincided with an international engineering fair.
Mr Heseltine said he was keen that British companies win contracts to
set up telecommunication services, which India has thrown open to
foreign investment under its three-year-old economic reform programme.
He asked India to slash its customs tariffs, allow imports of consumer
goods, and open up the insurance sector to foreign companies.
Earlier, he told business leaders at a luncheon that more than 200
joint ventures involving British companies were being formed every year,
many of them small firms.
Junior Trade Minister Richard Needham will visit India next week and
Food Minister Michael Jack in September, and at least 10 British
industrial missions are planned by April 1996, he said.--Reuter.

SOUTH African defence officials tonight dismissed as laughable a
Channel Four TV documentary claiming that right-wing South Africans had
a secret stock of nuclear arms.
In the Dispatches programme, a man described as a former member of
South Africa's secret service alleges that five neutron bombs and one
hydrogen bomb were stored secretly in the Northern Transvaal province.
He said the weapons, produced by the former apartheid government, were
in the hands of right-wing extremists who did not accept the new black
government of President Nelson Mandela. He said he feared a civil war.
In 1993 the then-President F W de Klerk admitted South Africa had made
nuclear weapons, but said it had destroyed all six devices.
Bertus Celliers, spokesman for South Africa's Armscor weapons agency
in Pretoria, called the report ''a load of nonsense''. Sources in the
Department of Defence, now run by ANC Defence Minister Joe Modise, said
the programme had caused mirth, but no concern.

SOUTH African President Nelson Mandela pronounced himself fit for his
age, but ruled out serving a second term after elections in 1999.
''Oh no, definitely not,'' said Mandela, 76, when asked if he would
seek to extend his five-year term as South Africa's first democratically
elected head of state.
In an interview at his Cape Town office, Mandela, widely seen as the
key stabilising factor in South Africa's delicate transition from white
minority rule, said: ''In 1999 I will be 79 or 80. I don't think an
octogenarian should be meddling with political affairs.
''I would like to give over to a younger man. I will be available for
advice if they want me, but to occupy a position as a head of state,
definitely, I won't take that risk.''
Mandela, who has headed a multi-party government of national unity
since winning historic all-race elections last April, did not indicate
who might succeed him. First Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, 52, is widely
regarded as the most likely candidate.
Asked about occasional speculation on financial markets that he was in
poor health, he replied: ''I think somebody is gaining a lot through
spreading these rumours.
''For my age I think I am in reasonably good health. I enjoy walks.
One of my favourite hobbies is to walk . . . sometimes I take three,
four, and even as much as five hours just walking. A person whose health
is frail would not do that. Ask my security guards.''
Mandela was asked about allegations of misuse of foreign aid funds by
his estranged wife Winnie and preacher-politician Allan Boesak, who this
week withdrew as ambassador-designate to the United Nations.
Showing no emotion and referring to his wife as ''Mrs Mandela'', he
said judgment should be suspended on her conduct until an investigation
had been completed, and any action against Boesak would depend on the
outcome of a separate inquiry.
He added: ''I think the way we have handled the Boesak affair
indicates the firmness of the ANC, but the caution it exercises before
it takes any action.''
Mrs Mandela, a deputy Minister in her husband's government, is at the
centre of a row over her leadership of the ANC Women's League. Senior
league members, who resigned last weekend, accuse her of not passing on
a #90,000 donation to it from Pakistani President Benazir Bhutto.
Mrs Mandela says the money was given to her to disburse to the needy
as she wished.
Mandela said his government faced the monumental task of restructuring
an entire nation in which the underprivileged black masses were
demanding ''houses today, not tomorrow''.
He added that the budget to be presented to Parliament next month
would address the wealth gap between the white minority and newly
enfranchised blacks.--Reuter.

Moscow, Wednesday
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin today defended his army's iron-fist military
campaign in Chechnya and said it had been necessary to use force to
crush the rebel region's bid to break away.
''The force of the state was used in Chechnya once federal authorities
had exhausted all other forms of action,'' the Russian leader said in a
message to the nation to be delivered tomorrow.
An advance copy of Yeltsin's speech admitted that human rights had
been violated during the war.
However, he argued, they had also been violated in Chechnya during the
three years the region had been led by separatist President Dzhokhar
Dudayev.
''On a part of Russia's sovereign territory, elementary human rights
were gravely violated, our territorial integrity was challenged, and
Russian laws were ignored . . . '' he said.
''It was not just the authorities which were put in a humiliating
position, but the Russian state itself.''
Yeltsin's own role in Chechnya, where thousands of Chechen civilians
and hundreds of Russian conscript soldiers have been killed, has drawn
fire from human rights activists abroad and embarrassed his political
allies in the West.
A two-day truce was announced between Russians and Chechens today. It
was due to begin at midnight local time, a few hours before Yeltsin
delivers his speech.
The two sides ended a day of talks in Ingushetia, on the border with
Chechnya, with an announcement of a comprehensive 48-hour ceasefire
covering all types of weapons.
Interfax said agreement had been reached separately to hand over dead
and wounded from the two-month war.
The new ceasefire extended a temporary truce on use of heavy weapons,
agreed on Monday, which had already been threatened by military
action.--Reuter.

Washington, Wednesday
TOMORROW should be a moment of rejoicing in the annual revolution of
the seasons: the moment when baseball players should emerge from
hibernation to begin spring training in Florida and Arizona.
Every year, this instant of national ritual and harmony has occurred
in mid-winter, as America's favourite athletes, in their striped
pyjama-like uniforms, re-appear to practise for the coming season.
The times are cold and horrible in the frozen north, and all America
looked forward to the rite of spring in the sunny south; but baseball
players have been on strike since last summer, and there will be no
spring training this week, or at least not as it should be. Twenty
baseball teams will produce replacement players, those not good enough
to make even the worst national team, but it's not the same.
It is a disaster for the several hundred thousand people who make a
living, directly or indirectly, from the national sport.
The dispute is about money, of course. The players are already richly
compensated and want more. The owners are just rich, and they want to
impose a cap on top players' earnings, ostensibly to spread some revenue
around lesser teams.
Last year's season was aborted in mid-passage. There was no World
Series for the first time in 80 years, and all baseball fans went into
mourning.
No wonder the government lost the November election. No wonder the
president tried to mediate. He failed.
There have been negotiations, on and off, since last spring, and the
latest round failed last week. The president suggested legislation to
impose binding arbitration: his view, shared by the huge majority of
Americans, is that this dispute between millionaires and billionaires is
ridiculous and should be settled, we don't care how.
Baseball is special: it is not subject to the anti-trust laws binding
other industries and sports. Players cannot sue the owners when they
band together to refuse to settle.
Last week, the new leaders in Congress said they had better things to
do than get involved in baseball. This week, wiser heads are prevailing.
A Bill is being introduced to end the owners' exemption from the general
law.
Things are so serious that it may well go through, despite Congress's
theoretical objection. Everyone, apart from the owners, hopes so.

Cape Town, Wednesday
RIGHT-WING whites with sticks and dogs shouted racist insults and
attacked black schoolchildren near Cape Town for a second day.
A white man was arrested after beating a boy with a leather whip as
blacks and whites faced one another across a street in the poor white
Ruyterwacht suburb.
Some 100 armed police protected about 3000 black children bussed into
the area from the Khayelitsha township, nine miles away, in a campaign
organised by the National Education Co-ordination Committee to occupy
abandoned white schools.
A spokesman for the NECC said a black youth had been fatally stabbed
in the school grounds today, probably by a fellow student.
Police said they had found a can of petrol and wire-cutters next to
the school's back fence. Residents yesterday threatened to burn down the
school.
ANC co-ordinator of community policing Raymond Jada told senior
policemen the children were registering at the school because it was the
only empty one available.
''Once the two other schools that were promised to us are opened, we
will divide the children and send some of them there,'' he
said.--Reuter.

SPECIAL REPORT by DAVID STEELE
A SHERIFF yesterday issued a stark warning to anyone considering
taking the drug ecstasy. ''A dance with ecstasy can lead to a dance with
death.''
Sheriff Neil Gow, QC, was giving his judgment after hearing five days
of evidence at a fatal accident inquiry into the deaths of three young
men who took drugs at rave events in the Hanger 13 nightclub in Ayr.
At the end of a detailed determination and judgment, he said: ''To
emphasise the dangers, it is necessary to use colourful language here.
''Ecstasy is not for fun. It is a dangerous drug with unpredictable
effects, and is potentially lethal. Drugs can kill. A dance with ecstasy
can lead to a dance with death.''
The inquiry looked into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Mr
John Nisbet, 18, from New Cumnock, Ayrshire, and Mr Andrew Dick, 19,
from Glasgow on May 1 last year; and of Mr Andrew Stoddart, 20, from
Rigside, Lanarkshire on August 21.
He had no particular recommendations to make on stewarding or
searching but said the failure to search stewards or bar staff was ''an
obvious point of weakness''. He also suggested increased undercover
stewarding and improved ventilation.
His findings were widely welcomed. The owner of the Pavilion, which
houses Hanger 13, Mrs Christine Ridha, said: ''I hope that we can
continue in business so that further improvements can be made at the
club.
''Nothing can bring back these three young men who died in such tragic
circumstances but if lessons can be learned for the youth of today then
the inquiry has been worthwhile.
''This has been a very distressing time for everyone and I hope that
we can work together to ensure it never happens again.''
Her son, Mr Fraser McIntyre, manager of the Pavilion, called on people
to come and enjoy events at Hanger 13 without taking drugs.
Their solicitor, Mr James Reid, said: ''We will be closely examining
the sheriff's findings which we broadly welcome. He has identified a
potential area of weakness in searching but there was no direct evidence
or even rumour to suggest that staff were involved in the selling of
drugs.''
Mr Jack Drummond, the uncle of Andrew Stoddart, who represented the
family at the inquiry, said: ''This has been a period of great trauma
and sadness for all the families. I hope that lessons will be learned.
''I am not convinced that the place was properly stewarded and that
this led to difficulties.''
Mr Drummond added: ''If anyone thinks of taking ecstasy they should
think of Andrew Stoddart, Andrew Dick, and John Nisbet. They are dead
and we must make sure they are the last.
''A generation of young people, from about 12 to 20, is at risk from
this drug. Please don't to it. Drugs kill.''
The sheriff found that all three men had died as a result of having
consumed ecstasy or other controlled drugs at public musical events,
popularly known as raves, in the premises known as Hanger 13, Pavilion
Road, Ayr.
Sheriff Gow wants detailed legislation to cover raves.
He called on the Scottish Office to treat ''as a matter of
considerable urgency the preparation in legislative form of model
conditions in licences for raves dealing in particular with numbers,
stewarding and searches so that local licensing boards, managements and
the police have a clear framework within which to operate.''
He added: ''This would help to avoid further tragic deaths of young
people such as happened in this case.''
Councillor John Davidson, chairman of the local licensing board which
suspended the Pavilion licence last November, said: ''The present
legislation does not cover events such as this. We need statutory
guidelines and conditions.''
The sheriff's call was also backed by the Nisbet family MP, Labour's
George Foulkes, who has tabled a question to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang
urging immediate action.
He said: ''If Mr Lang feels he cannot put legislation through then I
will table a private member's Bill and would expect his support.
''Meanwhile I hope that all rave operators will voluntarily impose
number limits, improve searching and stewarding, and provide adequate
supplies of water and chill-out areas.
''This outcome more than justifies the holding of the FAI and shows it
was certainly not a waste of time and money.''
However, the Conservative MP for Ayr, Mr Phil Gallie did not agree. He
said that nothing had been learned after a week that was not known
before. ''This did the families more harm than good.''
Mr Gallie added: ''I would back the calls for guidelines for licensing
baords, however, and feel the Scottish Office are already some way down
that road.''
Sheriff Gow said that the evidence during the inquiry had highlighted
the unpredictable nature of ecstasy which ''makes it so dangerous''.
Medical evidence pointed out that a mixture of taking ecstasy and
dancing in a hot environment can raise body temperature to a potentially
fatal 42 degrees Centigrade.
The sheriff called for an extension to the present co-operation
between police and schools in the education of young people on the
dangers of misuse of drugs.
A Scottish Office spokesman said last night: ''Sheriff Gow's
determination is a useful deliberation which highlights very effectively
the danger of drugs such as ecstasy. It is a message we must get over.
''Many of the recommendations and the determination were covered in
the Report of the Drugs Task Force and are already under way, including
guidance for local authorities.
''For example, the Scottish Drugs Forum has already been commissioned
to prepare guidance for local authorities and licensing boards for their
dealing with rave organisers and this will be taken forward as quickly
as possible.''

The mark of militancy: Maori protester Paoro Rangaho joins 300 others
in a march through Rororua to oppose the New Zealand Government's plan
to settle all land claims relating to the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, which
established British sovereignty.
The protesters were stopped 200yd from the tribal meeting place where
Ministers were trying to garner support for the #400m land-compensation
package. Maori activists reject the deal, saying the Government wants to
settle all treaty claims in 10 years when the wrong done to the Maoris
has been going on for more than 150 years.
In another development Prime Minister Jim Bolger, angered by insults
from Maori protesters during national day events at Waitangi this year,
pledged a different approach to the way future anniversaries were
celebrated. Bolger and other dignitaries were spat at, abused, and
threatened during the February 6 ceremonies, and one protester bared his
tattooed buttocks at Governor-General Dame Catherine Tizard.

Taipei, Wednesday
FIRE roared through a crowded three-storey karaoke parlour today,
killing at least 67 people in Taiwan's deadliest fire on record.
Police said that 67 bodies had already been recovered, but that
rescuers had yet to enter the third storey of the popular Weierkang Club
in the central city of Taichung.
''There will be more corpses inside,'' said one firefighter.
State television said that, of about 100 people believed to have been
in the building when the explosions tore through it at 7.30pm, only 12
had escaped unscathed. Four others survived with serious injuries.
Newspapers said it was the highest fire death toll in Taiwan's
history.
Television quoted witnesses who said the fire started in the stairwell
between the first and second floors. One witness said the waitresses
tried to use the fire extinguisher, but the flames were too big by then.
''There were so many people on the second floor at that time and there
was no way that we could get out,'' another witness said.
Flames swept up the three-storey block and erupted from the roof
before firefighters extinguished the blaze about 90 minutes later.
One firefighter, Wu Ching-fang, told a news agency that all windows in
the building had been sealed and that there was only one ground floor
exit and no fire escape equipment.
Police said iron bars on the windows prevented many from escaping.
The cause of the fire was not immediately known. However national
television quoted survivors as saying they heard an explosion inside the
restaurant, possibly on the second floor.
''At first we thought it was a car crash because we heard some
explosions,'' said Tong Ling-yu, a telephone operator at the Zhongshan
hospital opposite the entertainment complex.
''I could feel the heat come over the road and there were sparks
outside my window,'' she added.
One witness said that the complex was unusually busy today, as if
booked by a special party.
More than 100 people have died in a series of fires at Taiwan's
entertainment venues in recent years, but today's was the worst for more
than a decade in terms of lives lost.
Karaoke parlours, or KTVs as they are known here, are a popular form
of entertainment. They comprise a warren of private rooms in which
customers sing along to the words of tunes played on TV screens.
Many KTVs have been criticised for poor safety facilities and many are
unlicensed.
An aide in Taichung mayor's office said that authorities were
investigating whether the complex had been properly registered.
''We will punish those who are found to be responsible for the safety
of public places like this,'' said the aide.
A manager of the club, Wu Chen-seng, was tonight held for questioning.
Last October, 13 people died in a karaoke parlour fire in Taiwan's
capital, Taipei. In January 1993, 33 people were killed in a suspected
arson attack on a Taipei restaurant.--Reuter/AP.

THE trauma and tragedy of the Hanger 13 deaths was etched on the faces
of three parents who spoke to the inquiry of their loss and their lack
of knowledge about their sons' drug taking.
Throughout the inquiry, Mr Andrew Stoddart, 45, sat listening to
details of how his son had met his death, after taking as many as three
and a half ecstasy tablets.
At times he lowered his head, as graphic details of the fight by
stewards and medical staff to resuscitate his dying boy were recounted.
He insisted that he had never had any idea that Andrew, 20, a van
driver and member of his local amateur football team, had any connection
with drugs.
Andrew, known to friends as Star, had joined his girlfriend, Claire
Prentice, 18, for a trip from Rigside, Lanarkshire, to the nightclub to
celebrate a friend's birthday.
On the journey, a cannabis joint had been passed around and some beer
drunk. Ms Prentice wept as she told of how Andrew had shown her some
ecstasy and had later taken ill.
Mrs Jean Nisbet, 41, spoke of her happy-go-lucky son John, who lived
with the family in New Cumnock, Ayrshire, but who was ''not himself''
after having four teeth extracted.
She was not sure if he had gone with friends to Hanger 13, but she had
been alerted by police, in the early hours of May 1, to go to Ayr
Hospital where her son was fighting a vain battle for life in the high
dependency unit.
Asked about possible drug taking she insisted: ''I never saw any
difference in John. He was the same way all the time. Happy go lucky. I
never had any idea he was involved in anything.''
Mrs Helen Dick, 43, had thought her son Andrew was staying with a girl
in Paisley, when he had died, despite the efforts of medical staff at
Ayr Hospital. He had become another victim of ecstasy.
The theme running through the parents' evidence was that none of the
boys fitted any accepted conception of people involved in the drugs
scene. They had not been seeking release from despair as is often the
case in hard drug use.
Instead each sought a ''high'' from the combination of a drug,
euphemistically given the labels ''leisure'' and ''recreational'', and
loud music and wild dancing in a hot atmosphere.
It was a quest which was to cost them their lives, deprive parents of
their young sons, youngsters of their brothers, and groups of people of
friends and companions.
The analogy drawn by one medical witness summed it up. ''Three people
can go out in the rain and either one, all or none can catch a cold. The
following week the same three can venture out and all be fine. With
drugs of any kind the risks are enormous and you will never know when
they may cause illness or death.''

IT will be business as usual on Saturday as dance nights continue
while the appeal against loss of the venue's entertainments licence is
considered.
On November 24, last year, the Kyle and Carrick district licensing
board suspended for a year the licence for the Pavilion, in which Hanger
13 events are staged, after the Chief Constable of Strathclyde
complained public order and safety would be threatened by its continued
operation.
The owners appealed and a Sheriff at Ayr is expected to give his
decision next week.
The dance nights began on March 13, 1993, as demand for events
variously known as dance and techno nights grew. The management have
conistently said Hanger 13 is not a rave event, adding these are
normally all-night dance parties held in large venues or in the open
air.
Hundreds of young people, some as young as 13, travel from throughout
Scotland to dance to bands and records. In the words of Sheriff Gow:
''There is loud popular music of a typical type, a good deal of vigorous
dancing, and a very hot atmopshere.''
In the words of a string of young witnesses: ''Ecstasy is part of the
night. It makes you hyper, pure full of it. It gives you energy and
helps you dance for hours.''
Because the decision on whether the Pavilion will stay in business is
still with the courts, the management were reluctant to specify future
plans but insist they will add to security precautions and follow any
guidelines put by police or other authorities.

THERE is deep concern among police officers fighting the spread of
so-called ''recreational'' drugs such as ecstasy and amphetamines.
This is coupled with a determination that both supply and demand must
be combated with vigour.
Ecstasy -- technically known as 3.4 Methylene Dioxy Methyl
Amphetanmine -- was developed in 1914 by German scientists as an
appetite suppresant but never reached the market because of its
potentially devastating side effects.
Its re-emergence in the 1970s was coupled with the rise of the dance
culture and it became known in the United States as the ''love drug''
because of its ability to create a good feeling, heighten awareness and
increase energy to unnatural levels.
But the authorities were quick to spot the dangers and it has been
banned, and given the same Class A status as heroin and cocaine, since
1977.
The medical evidence of how the three Hanger 13 young men met their
deaths was horrifying - their bodies overheated leading to muscle spasm,
clot forming factors in the blood broke down, enzyme systems failed and
the vital organs could no longer operate properly.
In the words of Dr Leo Murray, the accident and emergency consultant
at Ayr Hospital who treated the victims, ''their bodies were wrecked.''
He remains convinced that taking ecstasy is akin to playing Russian
Roulette.
He said: ''It could be that a person can take ecstasy for many months
without adverse effects. Yet the next time they take any of the drug
they could become seriously ill.
''I have treated many young people in hospital suffering to a greater
or lesser degree from the effects of drugs. In three tragic cases the
effects were devastating and ultimately fatal.
''We do not know what the conditions are which lead to more serious
reaction to drug abuse so the only way for people to avoid the risk is
to stop taking drugs altogether.''
Dr Murray said that there was no evidence to suggest that ecstasy
causes physical dependence but he agreed that there can be a
psychological dependence on the drug. ''Some people believe that you
cannot have a good night at a rave or dance club without the mood
enhancing effects of ecstasy.''
Despite the Hanger 13 deaths, and at least nine others in the UK in
recent years, the demand for the drug known colloquially as E, Adam or
XTC, continues to grow and small fortunes are being made by suppliers
willing to take the risks and bring in the drug in either powder or pill
form.
It is coming in to the UK in ever increasing quantities and some pills
have appeared on the streets of Strathclyde with a hammer and sickle on
them. Drugs squad officers are convinced that these originate in the
former Eastern bloc countries such as Poland as criminal elements seek
to boost their coffers with Western currency.
As one officer put it: ''The flow continues unabated despite every
effort to curb it. It is coming in aboard ships, on lorries carrying
otherwise innocent cargoes.
''We have to cut off that supply but as well as that side, we have to
work with everyone concerned to inhibit the demand. The risks cannot be
stressed enough.''
During the inquiry, Detective Constable Donald Fraser of Strathclyde
Police drugs squad, told of a network of suppliers and dealers feeding
the demand from dance nights, raves and parties.
A pill can be bought by a supplier for 50p, sold to a street dealer
for #5 and then marked up by over 200% to be sold to the person who
consumes it.

THE coastguards' union has warned that lives could be in danger unless
more staff are hired to keep radio watches on the maritime distress
frequency.
BT's contract to monitor emergency radio messages on 2182mHz is due to
end in April. Coastguard chiefs have said that there will be no
difficulty with their existing staff doing the work.
However, Mr Dutchy Holland, chairman of the coastguard sections of the
National Union of Civil and Public Service, said yesterday that
coastguard stations were being asked to take the extra duties without
having enough officers to do the job.
''The lives of seafarers and passengers could well be at risk,'' he
said. ''There's nothing more tragic than a missed Mayday call.''
In an incident off Shetland last year, a BT operator did not hear a
Mayday call from a fishing boat, leading to a delay in alerting the
rescue services.
Mr Holland said: ''Keeping a listening watch on the medium frequency
radio is very stressful work, requiring intense concentration. There's a
lot of background noise and Mayday messages can be very faint -- and
sometimes as far away as Canada or the Mediterranean.
''In the Royal Navy, radio operators are relieved after 40 minutes to
an hour on this duty.''
The proposal would mean officers on duty would be working so hard that
they would not be able to take any breaks for fear of missing a distress
call, he claimed.
Mr Richard Crowther, the depute regional controller for coastguards in
the north and east of Scotland, dismissed the idea that existing staff
could not cope.
''We will be managing our operations rooms in such a way that the
extra duties shouldn't be a problem.,''

PLANS for a massive housing expansion on the outskirts of Aberdeen
were thrown out yesterday by Grampian Region's planners.
A consortium had been seeking outline planning permission to build
3000 houses on 650 acres of land around the garden suburb of Westhill.
Principal planning officer Frank Bowman said the proposals included
re-routing the A944 Aberdeen/Alford road as well as relocating Westhill
golf course.
The application was put forward by the Ashdale Land And Property
Company, London and Clydeside Holdings, and the Westhill Development
Company.
Gordon District Council had already registered its objection to the
proposal and Councillor Morag Morrell said the planned development was a
direct result of Grampian Region's decision not to proceed with a new
town but to go along with a housing dispersal policy.
Councillor Maitland Livingstone said the region should be concerned
with issues such as roads and education and added that the effects of
the housing plan on Westhill Academy and the Lang Stracht commuter route
would be serious.

THE widow of a cigarette smoker suffered a major setback yesterday in
the first attempt in Scotland to sue a tobacco company over a lung
cancer death.
A judge ruled that the Scottish Legal Aid Board did not act perversely
or unreasonably in refusing to fund Mrs Margaret McTear's legal action
against Imperial Tobacco.
Mrs McTear's solicitor made it clear, however, that the decision by
Lord Kirkwood in the Court of Session is unlikely to mean the end of the
case.
Mr Cameron Fyfe said: ''I will meet senior counsel to discuss where we
go from here; meantime, we will continue on a speculative basis without
legal aid.''
One possibility was to submit a fresh application for public funding
based on recent English cases where legal aid had been granted for
research into similar cases.
Alfred McTear died aged 49 in March, 1993. He had raised an action
against Imperial Tobacco, makers of John Player cigarettes, which he had
smoked for almost 30 years.
Lawyers went to his home at Cherrywood Drive, Beith, Ayrshire, to take
evidence, but Mr McTear died before completing it.
He had claimed that when he started smoking in the 1960s he was not
made aware of the risks involved and that cigarette companies had
advertised smoking as the ''sexy'' thing to do.
He became addicted and was unable to give up until death stared him in
the face.
After he died, Mrs McTear applied for legal aid to continue his case
and sue in her own right, but this was refused by the legal aid board
(SLAB). She went to the Court of Session seeking a judicial review of
that decision.
Lord Kirkwood said yesterday that SLAB had obtained the opinion of Mr
Colin McEachran, QC, who took the view that Mrs McTear had a good
prospect of winning her case and that her claim was worth about
#100,000.
However, Lord Kirkwood said
that although SLAB was bound to have regard to his views, it was not
bound to accept them.
It was entitled to consider if Mr McTear had voluntarily accepted the
risk of smoking, which would defeat his claim, and the issue of
contributory negligence, which would reduce its value.
The judge added: ''The board believed that the health hazards of
smoking received wide publicity during the 1960s.
''The board also noted that Mr McTear had continued to smoke for more
than 20 years after warnings appeared on packets; that he continued to
smoke long after the time when risks were known; and that his
consumption of cigarettes actually increased.''
SLAB had concluded that difficult issues such as contributory
negligence and accepting the risk of smoking might be decided against
Mrs McTear.
The board then looked at the amount of public money involved if the
case went ahead, and the possibility that the action would fail and
public funds would not be recovered.
Lord Kirkwood said that while cost could not be the sole reason for
SLAB's decision, it was a relevant consideration.
''Mrs McTear has not succeeded in passing the exacting test of showing
that the board acted irrationally or unreasonably,'' the judge added.
Mrs McTear said: ''I promised my husband I would see the case through.
Although disappointed, I am sure we will ultimately succeed.''

THE Prime Minister will be challenged today to intervene in Defence
Ministry plans to axe more than 1000 civilian jobs across Britain.
The move follows an announcement by Armed Forces Minister Nicholas
Soames that naval support services are to be cut to help save #174m over
the next 10 years.
The jobs scheduled to go include 427 at Devonport, 348 at Eaglescliffe
in Cleveland, 215 at Exeter, 92 at Wrangaton in Devon, and 90 at Rosyth
in Fife.
However, 28 posts will be created at a waterfront site at the Clyde
submarine base at Faslane and at a new central storage and distribution
centre at Portsmouth.
The announcement came yesterday despite two Parliamentary Defence
Select Committee reports in the last year urging a rethink on the Front
Line First policy of cost-cutting in logistical back-up for the armed
forces.
It also included a proposal to privatise some services at Faslane, the
UK's most sensitive nuclear base, and home to the new generation of
Trident missile submarines.
Faslane was exempted from privatisation in 1989 because of its unique
strategic value and the increased risk of allowing any dilution of base
security.
Shadow Defence Secretary David Clark said yesterday that the
announcement gave a hollow ring to the Prime Minister's pledge, given at
the Tory Party conference, to put an end to the reductions in defence
staff.
A delegation of civilian defence staff from all over the UK is to
assemble outside Downing Street today to hand in a letter of protest.

LADY Brocket was given a one-year conditional discharge and ordered to
pay #40 costs yesterday when she appeared in court and admitted trying
to trick a chemist into handing over enough pain-killing drugs to kill
herself.
The American-born former model, Isabel, who has three young children,
used a forged prescription in an effort to get a chemist to dispense a
deadly amount of the painkiller pethidine, magistrates at St Albans were
told.
Lady Brocket's former husband, Charles, 43, a polo playing friend of
the Prince of Wales, was remanded on bail on Saturday, at the same
court, on charges of trying to defraud insurers of #4.5m by claiming
that four classic cars were stolen from the family home, Brocket Hall,
near Welwyn, Hertfordshire.
Lady Brocket,35, who was accompanied in court by her consultant
psychiatrist, Dr Mark Collins, admitted two charges, one of deception
and one of forgery on January 4 this year.
Ms Phillipa Mcatasney, defending, said Lady Brocket ''committed the
offences against a background of despair''.
She added that Lady Brocket now recognised she had depression and had
admitted herself to hospital.

CHILDREN will soon be able to give evidence via close circuit
television in courts throughout Scotland.
Facilities will be provided at Aberdeen, Airdrie, Greenock, and
Falkirk from April.
Cameras have already been installed in Glasgow and Edinburgh where
pilot schemes in sheriff and High Court criminal trials have been
running since 1991.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang announced the move in answer to a
parliamentary question from Mr Raymond Robertson MP, asking when the
extension of closed circuit TV for taking children's evidence in these
courts was expected.
It was confirmed arrangements were being made to extend the provisions
to the whole of Scotland from April 3.
''The necessary facilities will be provided in one court house in each
sheriffdom.''
Statutory provision to allow children's evidence in criminal trials to
be taken using a live, closed circuit TV link was introduced through
legislation in 1990.
The facility can be used where the presiding judge or sheriff has
given approval.

SAFEWAY is to become the first British supermarket to offer customers
the use of self-service price scanners.
The system is to be tested next month in Solihull, West Midlands, and
the firm hopes it will drastically cut down checkout queues and speed up
shopping.
If the trial is a success, Safeway aims to introduce the system in 50
or 60 of its 383 stores by the end of the year.
Customers taking part in the trial -- which begins on March 14 and
will last for at least a month -- will unlock one of the hand-held
scanners from a dispenser when they enter the store.
As they move around they then scan the bar code of each item selected
before dropping into their trolley.
When customers return to the dispenser after completing their
shopping, a receipt is printed and they pay at special express
checkouts.
The scanner is able to delete a price from the bill if a customer
decides to put an item back on the shelf.
The shopworkers' union Usdaw said it was concerned about the effect
that do-it-yourself scanners could have on jobs.
''We are not Luddites and we don't condemn new technology out of hand,
but we are obviously concerned,'' said Mr Frank Murphy, Usdaw's national
officer
''If such methods were adopted nationwide on a large scale, the impact
on employment could be serious.''
Safeway said that DIY scanning devices had been used successfully
abroad.

MORE than 80 senior Army officers, including major-generals,
brigadiers, and colonels, are to be axed in the latest round of defence
job cuts next month.
Although the Army Board has not yet made final decisions about who
will go, the reduction in senior officers is seen as an essential part
of more than 480 redundancies across the ranks.
The Army is determined the right balance in the promotion chain must
be maintained.
The redundancies will include around eight major-generals, 32
brigadiers, and up to 48 full colonels.
The jobs of the most senior officers -- including nine
lieutenant-generals and six full generals -- are thought to be safe.
The redundancies form part of the Defence Costs Study review under
which the Royal Air Force is the hardest hit with 8600 job losses, while
the Royal Navy has 2400 redundancies.
There is particular concern about the problems of finding civilian
jobs for the senior officers, who will be in their late 40s or early to
mid-50s.

RESIDENTS in Scotland's smallest council estate are pleading to have
their homes demolished.
The scheme is marooned in acres of raspberry fields and miles from the
nearest town.
The houses, built for workers at a long abandoned mill, have no shop,
telephone box, post box, bus service, school, playpark, or pub.
Tenants claim they are ''forgotten people'' in the estate, which is
surrounded by acres of farmland in picturesque Perthshire countryside.
The Old Mill Road scheme is two miles outside Blairgowrie and contains
a tenement block of 12 flats, of which only three are occupied, and six
semi-detached properties.
Mr Graeme Low, 28, a father-of-five, said: ''I have been stuck here
for six years. It's in the middle of nowhere. I don't have a car and in
the bad weather it's hopeless.''
Unemployed Mr Low added: ''There's nowhere for the kids to play. The
flat is totally inadequate.
''There is no central heating. Even though there is double glazing the
draughts still come in and my youngest child Christopher has to go to
hospital because of his asthma.''
Another resident of the block, Mr Lawrence Edgar, 30, complained:
''We're marooned. We have to go by taxi everywhere and that costs us #20
a week, which we can't afford.''
Susan Chalmers, 28, lives in her three-bedroomed flat with her four
children and boyfriend. She said: ''They should knock all this down and
build it closer to the town.
''This scheme is a dump and the houses are freezing. We have just been
forgotten about. I have been here two years and am desperate to get
out.''
Mr Ron Ashton, depute director of housing at Perth and Kinross
District Council, said: ''The difficulty with the area is the isolation.
We are in partnership with Scottish Homes to see how we can regenerate
the scheme.''

BARNEY the parrot earned himself an extra helping of his favourite
cashew nuts last night -- after causing a courtroom flutter by
identifying his owner with two piercing wolf-whistles.
Jurors and court officials burst out laughing when the exotic bird --
worth #625 -- showed his appreciation for Georgina Morgans, 27, in
time-honoured fashion.
Barney, a Red Lored Amazon parrot, had been carried in a cage into
Kingston Crown Court, London, in a bid to prove that Miss Morgans was
his real owner.
He had been stolen in a burglary at her home in New Malden, Surrey, 16
months after she had bought him But the man accused of handling stolen
goods, 39-year-old Eric Buckley said Miss Morgans was mistaken.
Barney was not Barney at all -- but his own bird called Blue, he said.
However, Barney's courtroom antics helped convince the jury that he
belonged to Miss Morgans.
They found Buckley, of Surbiton, Surrey, guilty and Judge Kenneth
MacRae adjourned sentence until next month for reports.
After the hearing, Miss Morgans, a garden centre manageress, said:
''Barney is a wonderful bird and I wouldn't swap him for any other. He
certainly helped convince the jury Earlier, the parrot, with bright
green feathers and a red flash on his forehead, put on quite a show when
he was carried into court as Exhibit 3 while Miss Morgans gave evidence.
As Barney spotted her in the witness box he let out a wolf-whistle and
clambered upside down in his cage to be near her. Then he puffed out his
chest and gave a second throaty wolf-whistle as the court burst into
laughter.
Miss Morgans tickled Barney under the chin -- which she said nobody
else could do without getting their finger nipped -- then the pair
billed and cooed in unison.
She said she had recognised Barney from five feet away when she first
saw him in the police station after he was recovered from Buckley's
home.
''I whistled and he joined in the tune. He was pleased to see me and
started talking to me. He doesn't speak a lot of English, just noises,
such as whistling and chirrups that he uses to communicate.''

The founder of the Taylor
Woodrow Group, Lord Taylor, died yesterday at the age of 90. He had
created one of the biggest construction groups in the world after
building two houses when he was just 16.
Frank Taylor left a council school at the age of 13 and worked for his
father's greengrocer's in Blackpool.
He saved #30, borrowed #70 from his father and persuaded a local bank
manager to make him a loan of #400 so he could build the houses for his
family.
His journalist son-in-law Robin Marlar said that when ''he was 16 he
was prematurely bald which helped persuade the bank manager he was older
than he looked, so he was able to borrow the money''.
Taylor Woodrow now employs 8500 workers, has an annual turnover of
more than #1000m, and has offices in 15 countries.
Lord Taylor did not smoke or drink and followed a healthy lifestyle,
playing tennis well into his 80s.
Lord Taylor, who lived at Hadfield, Derbyshire, died of pneumonia in a
Florida hospital. His wife Christine was at his side. He leaves three
daughters from two marriages.

NEWSPAPER peer Lord Camrose died yesterday aged 85. He was part of a
Fleet Street dynasty founded by his father, the first Viscount Camrose,
and his uncle Lord Kemsley.
John Seymour Berry succeeded to the title in 1954 but he did not
succeed to control the Daily Telegraph due to ill health and it passed
to his brother, later Lord Hartwell, who is his heir.
As Major John Seymour Berry, he was a Conservative MP from 1941 to
1945, but spent much of the period on Army service in the Royal
Artillery in the North African and Italian campaigns. He was mentioned
in dispatches.
When he succeeded his father in 1954 he was deputy chairman of the
Daily Telegraph and a director of Amalgamated Press. His brother,
Michael was deputy editor of the paper.
A noted yachtsman and golfer, he did not marry until he was 76, when
his bride was Princess Joan Aly Khan.

A COUNCIL tax increase of around 15%, coupled with 1000 job losses,
are the likely effects of a draft #70.6m cuts package drawn up by
Strathclyde Regional Council, in a bid to meet its worst financial
crisis.
However, council leaders indicated yesterday that jobs losses, as far
as possible, would be by means of natural wastage, non-filling of
vacancies, redeployment, and early retirement.
Grant cuts imposed by the Scottish Office, have left the council with
a budget shortfall of #107m. The draft package, worked out in
consultation with union representatives, still leaves a #37m shortfall,
which the council hopes to meet by funding some revenue expenditure from
the capital budget.
This tactic, still to be approved by the Secretary of State for
Scotland, would wipe out a number of capital projects and hit an already
hard-pressed construction industry.
Councillor John Mullin, Strathclyde's finance chairman, said yesterday
that, should the Secretary of State refuse permission for the transfer,
then the council would seek a judicial review.
This move was suggested to the Labour administration recently by Dr
Christopher Mason, leader of council's Liberal Democrats.
The region's package of savings includes a 10% increase in rail, bus,
and ferry fares; cuts in property repairs; reduced office cleaning;
increased charges for the use of council premises; an 8% increase in
school meals (from 93p to 98p or 99p); reductions in hospitality and
travelling allowances; and reduction in initatives related to disabled,
race, and women's issues.
There are plans to close one home for the elderly and ''rationalise''
children's homes. There would also be a 10% cut in outdoor activities.
Of particular concern is the move to make cuts in the employment
grants scheme.
In addition a #2m reduction in the police and fire services is being
considered.
On a lighter note, the council is to abandon its practice of providing
cut flowers for regional council offices, thereby saving #29,000. And
using the passenger cruiser on Strathclyde Loch only for booked parties
will save #3600.
Councillor Mullin said: ''We are in a horrendous position, and the
blame lies squarely with the Secretary of State for Scotland. I hope the
trade unions will remember that when discussing any action they propose
to take.''
Mr Matt Smith, the Scottish Secretary of Unison, the local government
union, warned that there could be an adverse public reaction to the
Government-imposed cuts which could lead to street demonstrations.
He said: ''There are two main issues for us. There's the one about
service delivery and the other is about the effects on staff, and these
are exacerbated by the fact that we're only eight weeks away from
elections to the new unitary authorities.
''We'll be starting off in the new authorities from a very low base
point. If one thinks of the impact of the base point being reached now
going into new authorities then we can see services deteriorating even
further.
''We're concerned about the general driving down of service delivery
and the driving down of employees' aspirations and conditions of
service.''
The council's ruling Labour group is expected to finalise its budget
later this month.
Meanwhile, Lothian Regional Council's political groups are studying
how they can cut #20.5m from next year's budget to avoid being capped by
the Government.
The region's finance committee heard yesterday that #20.5m was the
difference between the budgeted relevant expenditure and the capping
limit set by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
A report by finance officials showed that, on current estimates, the
amount to be raised from the council tax would be #29m more than in the
present year.
Councillor Brian Weddell, who chairs the committee, said comment had
already been made about the inadequacy of the financial settlement for
Lothian from the Government and the unrealisitic capping limit.
He said that said all political groups would now be working out how to
bring next year's budget down to the capping limit.
''We have to come down to the capping limit, if we are to control our
own destiny,'' he said. Because of the work still to be done, it was not
possible, at the moment, to estimate what next year's council tax would
be, he added.
Members were also told that despite the fact that the region was still
getting receiving #1m a month from the poll tax, there was still #117m
outstanding. There was also #15m still due from last year's council tax.

MR ALLAN Stewart, who resigned as Scottish Office Minister last week
following an incident at the M77 construction site, is to be appointed
to the Commons Scottish Select Committee, where he will become the
senior Tory MP.
Last night Mr Stewart, 52, said he would be happy to serve on the
Committee: ''I am proposing to be an active and involved member.'' He
effectively swops places with Mr George Kynoch, who has become the new
Scottish Office Minister.
The appointment, which is expected to be confirmed by the Committee of
Selection later this month, will be welcomed by Labour, in particular
because it avoids having an English Tory MP named to replace Mr Kynoch.
Mr William McKelvey, the Scottish Select chairman, said: ''I would
welcome him with open arms on the committee. His experience in Scottish
matters will be invaluable.''
Ten days ago Mr Stewart, MP for Eastwood, was involved in an exchange
with motorway protestors in his constituency during which he picked up a
pick-axe. Although no charges have been laid against him, he resigned
three days

LABBOUR is increasingly becoming the party of the centre as well as
the left of centre and has taken over ''the mantle of one-nation
politics,'' Mr Tony Blair claimed yesterday. He told the Newspaper Press
Fund lunch in London the mantle was now ''draped rightly and properly
round our shoulders''.
Inequality was now a middle class issue, said the Labour leader,
because the better off could not escape the consequences of living in an
increasingly divided society.
He warned that the fabric of society was in danger of being torn apart
because Government policies had created ''two nations within the same
country''.
Aimed firmly at middle class voters the speech promised that Labour
would not fight inequality by penalising success.
''As the critical mass of the Tory party moved further and further to
the right it is Labour that is increasingly the party of the centre and
left of centre.''
Mr Blair said a whole section of society has lost it access to
opportunity and its wealth-creating ability as a small group of ''vested
interests'' thrived at its expense.
''A strong society must be based on the principle that all citizens
have a stake in it,'' he said.
''If people feel in effect that they live in different nations within
the same country then the social fabric becomes torn, creating
alienation amongst one group and insecurity and concern among the rest.
''Even the better off cannot escape its consequences. Inequality is a
middle class issue. It is an issue of enlightened self interest as well
as social justice.
''The means of tackling it should be through the politics of
opportunity, not envy. It is about levelling up, not levelling down.''
He said Labour would switch the emphasis from wasting billions on
crime, unemployment and social decay to building a new economy based on
sound education and training.

BOUNDARY changes which will leave leading Conservative Michael Forsyth
struggling to hold on to his Stirling seat were condemned yesterday as
''disgraceful gerrymandering'' by the MP.
The Government confirmed previously announced decisions of the
Boundary Commission for Scotland which leave representation at 72 seats
but switch one seat from Glasgow and give a new representative to the
North-east.
The most high-profile Scottish politician to do badly out of the
review was Home Office Minister and prominent right-winger Mr Forsyth.
He claimed yesterday: ''My constituents will be very disappointed that
the Secretary of State has not responded to the many representations
from people of all political persuasions against the Boundary
Commission's ludicrous proposals to move Bridge of Allan and Stirling
University into Clackmannan and out of the Stirling constituency.''
''This is a lost opportunity and I shall be taking advice on whether
any further options are open to me to prevent thse proposals going
ahead. Whatever the outcome, I shall, of course, fight the Stirling
constituency and am confident that we shall win victory.''

THERE is no English Office but the Department of the Environment comes
closest.
While Scottish Questions in the Commons are usually enlivened by ''the
constitutional question'' which has kept Scots MPs intermittently active
since 1967 DOE questions tend to circulate around less heady topics
like, as yesterday, water leakage, area cost adjustment, the waste
strategy programme, and, for the seeker-out of specialised excitements,
''air pollution in Rotherham.''
The Government, readers will be pleased to know, are getting on top of
water leakage hoping to reduce the current, to a layman startling, 29%
of loss to 20% over the next few years. Mr Robert Atkins, an insouciant
DOE Minister and cricket-loving chum of the PM, told us that it was
uneconomic to try and get leaks below 15%. Mr Major would probably
settle for 15% at a time when the Government is springing leaks in all
directions.
Not, of course, from the Environment Secretary, Mr John Gummer, a
slightly built exponent of muscular Christianity. If we lived in a
theocracy where confession was compulsory one would expecte politicians,
along with advertising men, second-hand car salesmen and, you might add,
journalists, to have a tougher time than most. Even Mr Gummer, a man
once appointed Conservative Party chairman because of the unimpeachable
purity of his character, declared roundly: ''This party and this
Government do not go back on its promises. A few of the newer Tories
blushed faintly while Labour hooted but the old hands or lags muttered
'hear, hear' as if VAT on domestic fuel had never been invented.''
There is a tiresome ritual about Scottish, Welsh and DOE questions
relating to the mind-boggling, eye-closing topic of revenue support
grant. Labour says the Government never gives councils enough and
produce dire lists of wrecked services, teachers sacked, streets unlit
and, very nearly, half naked children begging at pub doors. Change and
decay all around they see.
Tory Ministers say briskly that if councils handle their finances
better, draw on the reserves, become more efficient, the funds they have
been given will prove ample. Labour say the councils have made all
possible savings, have no reserves left and are miracles of efficiency
already.
There are a few Labour councils on whose behalf not even an Opposition
MP feels brazen enough to make such a claim but I have set out the
general tenor of the exchanges.
Mr Frank Dobson, the tubby, genial, bearded Shadow Environment
Secretary had thought up a slogan ''You pay more and get less'' which he
tried out several times, doubtless rehearsing for the local elections
later in the year. A deputy, Mr Tony Lloyd, repeated it as well so the
Tories can't say they haven't been warned.
Conservative MPs, on the other hand, still furious at their loss of
every county council in England except loyal Buckinghamshire, assailed
the spendthrift and incompetent radicals now ravaging counties, some of
which still thought before the elections that they were being governed
under a modified version of the feudal system.
Mr David Amess, one of those phenomenons of our century who become
slightly famous by accident -- his Basildon constituency election result
showing Labour failing to win necessary marginals hit the television
screen just before other similar results -- bemoaned what the Lib-Labs
were doing to Essex.
''Impeach them,'' he demanded, sounding inadvertantly like a
Roundhead.
Despite this effort the temperature remained below boiling point. The
Scots and the Welsh, if the English will forgive what might seem an
ethnic slur, have a capacity for sustained indignation that eludes most
Anglo-Saxons. When Mr Atkins told Mrs Joan Ruddock: ''We have more waste
disposal policies than you'' the Opposition remained calm.
If DOE questions represent what an English assembly -- the only one
that has not been promised by Labour -- would be like analysis suggests
that it would at any rate be quieter than a Scottish one.

Strasbourg
THE federalist chairman of the Tory Euro-MPs fought off a challenge
for his job from Eurosceptics last night.
Mr Tom Spencer, regarded as one of the most Europhile MEPs in
Strasbourg and a target of Tory rebels, emerged victorious in a
three-way contest with the Thatcherite Eurosceptic Bryan Cassidy and the
mainstream Tory Edward McMillan-Scott.
The result was seen as a surprise. Many observers believed Mr
McMillan-Scott would take the job which has equal status with that of
the European party leader, currently Lord Plumb.
The leadership was not contested last night.
Giving backing to a federalist will be seen in Westminster as another
potential problem for the Prime Minister in his continuing campaign to
find common ground between the sceptics and the pro-Europeans.
The Tories, who once held 45 Euro-seats, were reduced to only 18 at
the last election. Mr Spencer appears to have survived because the
opposition was split evenly. He won 11 votes and his two rivals shared
the remainder with no abstentions allowed.
Mr Spencer's victory means the Tories in Europe will continue to
support a single European currency and to take a soft line on the
question of abandoning the national veto in the council of ministers.
He was at pains last night to play down a rift between the Tories and
the centre-right umbrella group, the European People's Party (EPP),
which has an unashamedly federalist agenda.
He said: ''First proposed by Margaret Thatcher, then fully endorsed by
John Major, the EPP group link makes sense far beyond the tactical
advantage for a national delegation reduced to 18 members.''
A further challenge to Mr Spencer is expected within a year.

RAILTRACK chairman Robert Horton yesterday told MPs he would discuss
the Forth Rail Bridge with railway officials in Scotland, adding that he
understood people in Scotland were unhappy about the state of the
bridge.
Mr Horton, giving evidence to the Transport Select Committee's inquiry
into railway finances, was pressed by Labour MP Brian Donohoe to account
for claims from railway campaigners that the bridge is rusting through
lack of maintenance and poses a safety hazard.
Mr Horton said maintenance patterns for the bridge had changed.
''Where we now shot-blast and apply four or five coats of anti-rust
paint that lasts for 25 years, in the old system it was wire brushes and
applying paint which looked nice but lasted four or five years.
''I can well understand that many people in Scotland are unhappy at
the physical appearance of the Forth Bridge.'' But, he added, he had no
hesitation guaranteeing its safety and integrity.
Mr Donohoe said the problem was that no money was being spent by
Railtrack on maintenance, despite receiving #170m a year from ScotRail
in access charges. ScotRail officials have expressed concerns that there
is no evidence that the money being paid to Railtrack is being spent on
the railways.
Mr Horton said he would discuss it with with officials in Scotland
''to make sure there is no misunderstanding on the finances''. He added:
''Money is short. Perhaps I could leave the matter there. I will look
into it.''
* A warning that rail services in Strathclyde could suffer or fares
could rise unless Government funding was provided came from the director
general of the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive, Mr Stephen
Lockley.
He told the committee that for 1996/97 the position was very
uncertain, and there was ''considerable disquiet'' about the amount of
money the authority would get.
Decisions were having to be taken now, but Mr Lockley said: ''We need
an assurance that we will get significant grant funding from the
Government, because we do not want to invest capital and then find we do
not have the money to spend on services.
''We are extremely concerned that we may not be able to commit
ourselves to the continuing support of some services unless we get the
support we need.''

THE Government's decision not to referTrafalgar House's #1.2 billion
bid for Northern Electric to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission will
threaten the independence of Scotland's two electricity companies, the
Scottish Nationalists warned in the Commons yesterday.
SNP leader Alex Salmond told MPs it set a precedent which would mean
''open season'' for the takeover of other electricity companies, as the
Government faced demands for assurances that the decision would not lead
to foreign buyers taking over British electricity companies.
The Government was forced to explain its decision before MPs. In an
emergency statement Trade and Industry Minister Jonathan Evans said the
ownership of privatised utilities was solely a matter for the markets.
Tuesday's decision by Trade President Michael Heseltine was ''fully
consistent'' with the Government's policy that proposed mergers should
be referred to the MMC ''primarily on competition grounds''.
He said Sir Bryan Carsberg, Director General of Fair Trading, gave
advice that the merger ''did not raise any competition concerns and that
the wider public interest issues raised by Northern Electric and by
third parties did not warrant reference to the MMC''.
Shadow Trade and Industry Secretary Dr Jack Cunningham claimed there
were ''strong grounds'' for a reference to the MMC and protested the
public interest was being ignored.
In the Commons MPs expressed reservations, citing Electricity
Regulator Stephen Littlechild's recommendation that the bid be referred
to the MMC because it is the first for a privatised utility and a full
discussion of the implications would be welcome.
Mr Salmond asked Mr Evans: ''How on earth is this not a precedent?
Haven't you effectively opened season on the other regional electricity
companies?''
Mr Evans told MPs that Mr Heseltine, who is on a trade mission to
India, had noted the regulatory concerns of the Director General of
Electricity Supply, Professor Stephen Littlechild, and ''obtained
assurances from Trafalgar House to address these''.

THE Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, says today that he
will not be silenced on Europe.
His insistence on making the case for closer European unity and giving
favourable consideration to the idea of a single European currency will
heighten tensions within the Tory Party.
In an interview in today's Daily Telegraph Mr Clarke says that as
Chancellor of the Exchequer he has a duty to spell out the possible
advantages to Britain of joining a single currency and intends to do so.
His remarks can be seen as a calculated snub to the Prime Minister who
is believed to have planned to warn Ministers at today's Cabinet Meeting
that they must stop making contradictory remarks about Europe and, in
particular, the single currency.
This was urged on him on Tuesday by the executive of the 1922
Committee which represents all Conservative back-bench MPs.
They expressed concern that the public splits between Cabinet
Ministers were damaging the strength of the pound and undermining the
Conservative fight back against the Labour Party which has been
developing policy splits of its own.
Some members of the executive even suggested that Mr Clarke should be
moved from his job if he continued to speak out as he did recently on
the single currency.
The interview seems a direct response by the combative Chancellor who
is one of the Cabinet Ministers most favourably disposed to the idea of
a single currency.
In a recent major speech he said that while the conditions under which
Britain might enter a single currency needed to be clarified, joining
should not be ruled out now.
His remarks clashed with the views of Cabinet Euro-sceptics like Mr
Michael Portillo, the Employment Secretary, and even his own deputy, Sir
Jonathan Aitken, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who said he would wait
''an eternity'' before signing up to a single currency.
The interview is a clear indication that Mr Clarke feels he is strong
enough to be able to insist that he is allowed to go on putting the case
for Britain playing a part in developing the European Union rather than
as Euro-sceptic colleagues would prefer, limiting Britain's involvement.
If Mr Major is unable today to persuade differing Cabinet Ministers to
call a truce, the current squabble is likely to escalate.
Mr Major has tried to unite the Cabinet behind the position that
Britain will not join a single currency in 1996 or 1997 and that it is
too early to judge whether it would be in Britain's interests to join at
a later date like 1999.
He would dearly like all Ministers to ''sing from the same hymn
sheet'' and stop making speculative speeches about what might happen in
the years ahead.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang last night launched his most ferocious
attack so far on Labour over its policies on local government financing
in Scotland, covering both business and domestic spending.
He told the Commons in a debate on a series of local government
spending orders that far from under-funding and attacking local
government in Scotland, it had prospered under the Tories.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson angrily countered with a
charge that the Tories had been vindictive and punitive in their
attitude to local government.
Mr Lang concentrated particularly on the moves to bring in a unified
business rate which, he said, already had delivered #440m worth of
''significant'' benefits to Scottish business.
It was astonishing, he said, that just as the Government had secured
its goal Labour was planning to throw those benefits away by returning
control to local authorities.
Mr Lang said: ''The hike in business rates that would inevitably
result from local authority control and the destruction of the level
playing field that we have achieved would seriously undermine the
ability of Scottish companies to compete in the market place. Existing
businesses would be threatened, new businesses deterred, and our efforts
to attract inward investment to Scotland would be jeopardised.
''Labour's motives in proposing such a policy patently have nothing to
do with the needs of business and nothing to do with the needs of the
Scottish economy. I have not heard a single Scottish businessman calling
for business rates to be returned to council control. Labour clearly
want to satisfy the desires of their free-spending councillors
irrespective of the needs of business.''
On the domestic front, Mr Lang insisted that the reality of the
situation was very different to the rhetoric from the Opposition. In the
past 10 years, expenditure by Scottish local authorities had increased
in real terms by over 20% and nearly doubled in cash terms. In the seven
year period to June, 1994, staffing levels in Scottish local authorities
increased by over 6%. In the same period staffing levels in English
authorities reduced by almost the same percentage figure.
For Labour, Mr Robertson hit back in similar style. He said Mr Lang
had described this year's settlement as ''extremely tight,'' and added
that this was an understatment.
He said: ''For two regional councils, Strathclyde and Lothian, it has
not just been tight it has been punitive, arbitrary, and its effects
will be a reduction in services for people. It will, force up the
council tax and local charges.''
Mr Robertson concentrated particularly on the housing budget, stating
there had been one of the most savage and vindictive housing settlements
for years. Services would be affected and the standards, quality and
availability of housing would be hit all over Scotland.
The main reason for what the Government was doing was to cut funding
this year in order to find room for pre-election tax cuts next year, he
claimed, and he accused the Government of a ''cynical abuse of power''.
The SNP spokesman, Mr Andrew Welsh, said: ''The Scottish Secretary
obviously has no interest in fighting for Scotland. His constant refusal
to help Scotland's councils' financial problems is based solely on
Treasury dogma.
''One wonders why he should lead in this debate if he is going to hand
on the responsibility of chronic underfunding of Scottish councils to
the Treasury.
''This 'nothing-to-do-with-us' attitude sums up the Tories. They want
all the credit when things go right but none of the responsibility when
things go wrong.''
At the end of the debate, the Opposition forced a technical vote on
the level of local government financing in Scotland, which the
Government won by 290 votes to 247, a majority of 43.

INSURANCE agents are having a good chuckle over the latest batch of
claim forms from drivers.
One motorist described to Colonnade Insurance Brokers at Weymouth,
Dorset, what happened when he smashed into another car.
''I was sat at the traffic lights when a man knocked on my car window.
I thought he was going to ask for directions but he put a rat through
the window. I panicked and drove into the car in front of me.''
Another claimant tried to explain why he hadn't got any insurance
details from the other driver: ''The car driving in front suddenly
stopped dead because the woman in front of her swerved to avoid a
squirrel. The squirrel and the driver ran away.''
Another driver said: ''I pulled away from the side of the road,
glanced at my mother-in-law, and headed over the embankment.''
Staff must have been mystified to hear this account of events leading
to an accident: ''I was on my way to the doctor with rear end trouble
when my universal joint gave way causing me to have an accident.''
Another unlucky traveller reported: ''I was thrown from my car as it
left the road. I was later found in a ditch by some stray cows.''
Staff were bewildered when one motorist wrote: ''I was driving along
when the iron fell off the dashboard, burning my leg, which caused me to
run into another car.''
They were equally puzzled by a claim which said: ''I was reversing out
of the car park when my foot slipped off the clutch and hit the

Yet another driver explained: ''The guy was all over the road and I
had to swerve a number of times before I hit him.''
Another wrote: ''I had been driving for 40 years when I fell asleep at
the wheel and had an accident.''
A few other excerpts from the company's files:
* Coming home I drove into the wrong house and collided with a tree I
don't have.
* I collided with a stationary truck coming the other way.
* I had been shopping for plants all day and was on my way home. As I
reached an intersection, a hedge sprang up, obscuring my vision, and I
did not see the other car.
* An invisible car came out of nowhere, struck my car, and vanished.
* I told the police I was not injured, but on removing my hat I found
that I had a fractured skull.
* The pedestrian had no idea which direction to run so I ran over him.
* I saw a sad-faced old gentleman as he bounced off the roof of my
car.

COUNCILLORS in Dundee were furious yesterday after they discovered a
video of the city's history had been been filmed 50 miles away in
Culross, Fife.
The tape, which is called Dundee -- Burgh of Discovery, is to be
launched tomorrow at Dundee City Chambers.
Ms Anne McGovern, Fife regional councillor for Culross said: ''I don't
know whether Culross should be flattered or horrified. Culross is very
historic and several film crews have filmed the town, but it does seem
odd that a film about Dundee should be made in Fife.''
Councillors in Dundee were not amused. Mr Neil Powrie, Tory group
leader on Dundee District Council, said: ''This beggars belief. It
sounds more like a comedy than a documentary.''
The video was made by Mr Joe Handy, a Dundee district councillor, and
partly written by Mr Iain Flett, a city archivist.
Mr Flett said: ''The film was staged in Culross because we had
problems in Dundee with background noise and vibration. But we have
included some of Dundee's historic scenes in the film.''

CORRUPTION and fraud laws must be strengthened to help police track
down those who abuse power in local and central government and in the
Civil Service, a police chief said yesterday.
Assistant Metropolitan Police Commissioner David Veness told the Nolan
Committee into standards in public life that corruption should be made a
serious arrestable offence in the face of the threat of increasing
fraud.
Courts should also be able to disqualify those convicted from holding
public office.
He also suggested a telephone hotline, similar to CrimeStoppers, for
people who wanted to blow the whistle on suspected corruption in public
life, without fear of reprisal.
Mr Veness, who is in charge of specialist operations at the Met, said
police investigated about 100 cases of reported corruption nationally a
year, but his best ''guestimate'' was that the real figure was probably
about 10 times that amount.
On the question of MPs' outside interests, constitutional reform group
Charter 88 told the committee that MPs should be allowed second jobs,
but their pay at Westminster should be cut to reflect that part-time
attendance.
Mr Colin Darracott, the group's co-ordinator, said it used to be
accepted that Britain was governed honestly, but trust had broken down.
Dr Peter Hennessey, Professor of Contemporary British History at
London University, urged Lord Nolan to ask to see the ''precedent book''
kept by the Cabinet Office.
This is a collection of notes about the conduct of Ministers and
ex-Ministers, gathered over many decades. It is one of the few documents
in Britain's unwritten constitution.
Dr Hennessey said that Britain could no longer rely on the morality of
each new political generation.
He rejected the argument from some Ministers that they should continue
to be able to take any job they wanted as soon as they left office.
In a scathing attack he said: ''Being a Minister used to have
something to do with duty. It's not a job-creation scheme for the
would-be upwardly mobile.''

<HEADLINE>Banks 'keep quiet' about fraud losses.  Inquiry under way as hole-in-the-wall thefts are alleged to run into millions of pounds</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>IAIN WILSON, CHIEF REPORTER</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979829006</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MILLIONS of pounds are being robbed from customers' accounts by the
use of bogus cash machine cards -- with banks and building societies
making up the losses to keep the scale of fraud out of the public eye,
it was alleged yesterday.
The claims coincided with two separate court appearances in London,
where it was alleged that clearing banks had been defrauded of a total
of #2.6m, heightening fears that such scams are more widespread and
costly than had been believed.
Meanwhile, it was confirmed that a major fraud investigation, under
way throughout Britain, is not just confined to the Abbey National,
which alone has lost more than #1m from its cash machines.
The Metropolitan Police's cheque and credit card squad is also looking
into illegal withdrawals from customers with the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Inquiries into the Royal ''have only just started,'' according to the
specialist operations squad which is part of Scotland Yard's
International Organised Crime Branch.
Last night, a spokesman for the Royal admitted the bank has come
across ''a handful of people duplicating cards because they have had
access to customers' Personal Identification Numbers.''
He added: ''We have identified it, and spoken to the customers
involved. We emphasise the need to keep Pin numbers secret.''
Three people appeared in Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court yesterday
charged with conspiracy to steal #1.4m from clearing banks on or before
February 13.
The accused are Mr Andrew Stone, 31, an engineering consultant, his
wife, Amanda, 27, both of Beaumont Rise, Fareham, Hampshire, and Mr
Russell Poynter, 47, unemployed, of Grinstead Lane, Lancing, Sussex. The
two men were remanded in custody by magistrates, and Mrs Stone,
described as a housewife, was granted bail.
It was confirmed that their arrest on Monday, followed a nationwide
investigation into alleged credit card frauds involving the Abbey
National and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Their appearance also followed an exclusive report in The Herald of a
massive investigation by the Metropolitan Police, other forces, and the
Abbey National's own security investigations department, into the
alleged use of bogus cash cards to raid Abbeylink customers' accounts.
That investigation, involving 10 customers in Glasgow and 100
elsewhere in the UK, was confirmed only after our inquiries into the
case of a Lenzie woman who had #2700 removed from two accounts last
week. The Abbey returned the money and made an ex gratia payment of
#250.
However, police inquiries extend way beyond the Abbey National, which
recently became a bank. Officers said yesterday that they are worried
especially about the vulnerability of building societies to breaches of
security at cash machines.
Three other people also appeared at Horseferry Court yesterday on
separate charges relating to alleged conspiracy to steal #1.2m from
clearing banks. They were arrested in November for allegedly making
counterfeit Abbeylink cards used to withdraw money.

A GROUP of Scottish Second World War veterans has voted unanimously to
exclude German and Japanese ex-servicemen from what has been billed as
Scotland's biggest VE Day commemoration.
Twenty-four delegates to the Perthshire County Committee of the Royal
British Legion voted in support of a motion objecting to ''the presence
of former enemies at any remembrance service on VE or VJ Day.''
Former Cameron Highlander Willie Caldow, 74, chairman of the Perth
branch of the British Legion, said: ''Feelings are running very high. No
way should the Japanese or Germans be involved in any ceremonies.
''I was in Hong Kong in 1945 and saw our PoWs come out of Stanley
prison camp. The atrocities committed by the Japanese against our boys
and innocent civillians were not real.
''Their behaviour was appalling. At least the ordinary German soldiers
behaved like soldiers, but the Japanese were monsters. We cannot forgive
or forget.''
Former PoW Maurice Patterson, also 74, is backing the committee. He
said: ''I was captured at St Valery with the Highland Division in 1940.
I was a prisoner for five long years and have seen quite enough of
Germans.
''It's funny how none of them nowadays is a Nazi, yet at one time
there were millions of Nazis. VE Day and VJ Day should be kept as a
British affair.''
Lieutenant Alasdair Maclean, press officer for the British Legion in
Scotland, commented: ''It is impossible for the legion to have a policy
on this matter. It must be up to the conscience of each individual
member whether or not they decide to parade with those representing our
former enemies.''
Perth's VE Day will include a veterans' parade and 250 musicians from
massed bands of Scottish regiments.

CONDITIONS imposed by Edinburgh District Council on the firm which
runs Ingliston Sunday Market were yesterday ruled illegal.
Sheriff Andrew Lothian at Edinburgh Sheriff Court refused new
conditions which the council's licensing board had wanted to apply to
Spook Erection Ltd., which rents pitches to traders at Ingliston.
The board was seeking to make it easier for trading standards officers
to tackle the problem of counterfeit goods being sold by some of the
traders.
Spook Erection, which was not itself involved in selling goods, had
appealed on the grounds that the conditions were unlawful because they
were unclear, unreasonable, or went beyond the licensing board's powers.
The board wanted the officers to have free access to the whole of the
market at any time and the right to inspect a register showing names,
addresses, and other details of each stall holder.
Sheriff Lothian said if Parliament had not given trading standards
officers such rights, the board did not have the power to do so.
''I think the imposition of such duties is a matter for Parliament
alone,'' he said.
The board's motives could be applauded but it had gone about the
matter in the wrong way.
Sheriff Lothian said duties had been imposed in such a way as to
create an impossibly difficult task.
He refused a condition that all stall holders should have to display
their name and address prominently.
The board had wanted Spook Erection to stop stall holders operating
from ''fly pitches'' which could be easily folded away or abandoned in
the event of ''unwelcome official interest''.
The Sheriff said this was void due to uncertainty because the board
and Spook Erection had different ideas of what a ''fly pitch'' was.
He said the conditions were not only a restriction on the way Spook
Erection carried out its business but threatened the firm with criminal
action or the loss of its licence if it could not make stall holders
comply.
The board had argued the conditions were clear enough and reasonably
easy to comply with.
A council spokesman said later that a report would be made to the
licensing board.
Mrs Alison Magill, general manager of Spook Erection, said: ''We are
pleased with the decision.''

TWO newspaper publishing groups in Scotland are to be involved in
appeals against industrial tribunal decisions.
The Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail (1986) Ltd has lodged an
appeal against a Glasgow tribunal's finding that Sunday Mail deputy
editor Mr Ken Laird was unfairly sacked.
And Ms Karen Gordon has intimated an appeal against part of an
Aberdeen tribunal's decision in her claim against Aberdeen Journals, in
what was labelled ''the dotted couch case.''
The Glasgow tribunal ruled that Mr Laird, 43, of Kelvinside, Glasgow,
was unfairly sacked over his company's involvement in the publication of
two free newspapers.
He was awarded #13,941 but found to be partly to blame.
Meanwhile, Ms Gordon, of Fernielea Road, Aberdeen, has also appealed.
The tribunal rejected her unfair dismissal complaint but awarded her
#1500 compensation for sex discrimination.
Both appeals are likely to be heard by the Employment Appeal Tribunal,
Edinburgh.

A HEAD teacher alleged to have gagged a pupil with tape is being
reported to the procurator-fiscal at Falkirk. Mr Alex Christie, head of
Carmuirs Primary School, Camelon, was suspended on Tuesday after a boy
claimed his mouth was taped to stop him talking.
Central's director of education Maggie Allan said: ''Our own internal
investigation into the allegations against Mr Christie will continue.''

HANDYMAN Matthew Dodds swindled power companies out of more than #2m
by fiddling hundreds of meters across Britain, a court heard yesterday.
He charged a sliding scale for his services and even offered a
discount to pensioners.
A policeman said some people must have regarded him as a modern-day
Robin Hood.
Dodds, 50, travelled throughout Scotland and the north of England
winding back up to 60 meters a week for five years before he was caught
by undercover police.
Yesterday, he was jailed for three years when he admitted conspiracy
to defraud electricity and gas companies.
Newcastle Crown Court heard that Dodds would receive requests to turn
back power meters at homes, restaurants and hotels through the post
because he was not on the telephone.
Mr Glen Gatland, prosecuting, said Dodds was driven to his
''customers'' armed with his tools and authentic power company stickers
and seals.
He charged between #7 and #30 with the discount for old age pensioners
and on some of his trips, even wore a British Gas jacket to look the
part.
The court heard that Dodds, of Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne, began by
turning back his own power meters but was soon in demand from others
wanting to fix their bills.
''This was no small scale operation,'' said Mr Gatland. ''The
up-to-date position is that there has been a revenue loss to Northern
Electric of #1,875,000 and an estimated loss to British Gas of #514,800.
''But it is very difficult to know how much Dodds himself gained from
his activities.''
Jobless Dodds was finally arrested afer undercover police, alerted by
the power companies, put him under surveillance.
Sentencing him to three years, Recorder Peter Hepple, QC, said: ''This
was a massive fraud.
''You were at the hub of these events and were the author and the
cause of those significant losses to both companies. You were skilled at
this job.''
Dodds, who is married with a four-year-old child, admitted conspiracy
to defraud Northern Electric and British Gas.
His lawyer, Mr Roger Moore, said: ''He realises the amounts involved
in these offences must be very high but he has difficulty accepting the
figures put forward. Certainly he had no obvious trappings of wealth.''
Bernard Davies, a 44-year-old publican of Low Fell, Alan Fearon, 36, a
garage owner of Hebburn and businessman David Scott, of High Heaton, all
Tyne and Wear, were each jailed for three months after admitting
conspiring with Dodds individually.
Karl Sargeant, 34, of Newcastle was given a one month sentence after
admitting stealing Northern Electric stickers from the printers where he
worked.
The power companies have agreed not to take Dodds' customers to court
if they pay the outstanding amounts owed on their bills.

<HEADLINE>Higher test for doctors trained overseas is unlawful</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE General Medical Council unlawfully demanded higher standards from
an overseas-trained doctor wanting to qualify for full registration in
the UK than those which applied to doctors trained in Britain, a High
Court judge ruled yesterday.
The landmark decision was won by Dr Balbir Singh Virik, 44, of
Swindon, Wiltshire, and is expected to affect thousands of other
overseas doctors.
Mr Justice Carnwath said Dr Virik was born in Malaysia and qualified
as a doctor in his home country and India before gaining limited
registration to practise in Britain in August 1982.
Despite his experience, the GMC refused his application for full
registration in 1992, a decision upheld up by the council's review board
in 1993.
The judge ruled that the GMC had applied a higher test than that used
for domestically-trained practitioners, instead of properly deciding
whether or not all the evidence established Dr Virik's competence for
full registration under the 1983 Medical Act.
The GMC was refused permission to appeal, but is now expected to ask
the Court of Appeal itself to consider the case because of its important
implications for the medical world.
Mr Virik's solicitor, Mr John Wardley, said after yesterday's hearing:
''The ruling will affect many thousands of doctors who may wish the GMC
to reconsider a refusal of registration.
''It must mean that so many overseas doctors in this country who are
qualified to work in the NHS, or in private practice, have not been
allowed to do so.''
Mr Wardley said a practitioner trained in the UK was able to gain full
registration as a doctor after one year as a hospital houseman or
housewoman.
In contrast, Dr Virik, after working successfully for nearly five
years as a senior house officer, including periods as a registrar, was
still refused registration.
Dr Virik, now on income support and unable to practise as a doctor
because his limited registration ran out after five years, said after
the ruling: ''I am personally very pleased. I will now press ahead to
get full registration.''
The judge said Dr Virik had been forced to take ''irrelevant'' jobs to
support his wife and family but had always kept in touch with the
medical world, continuing private studies and attending hospitals.
Mr Wardley said Dr Virik was one of many overseas doctors adversely
affected since 1978 by GMC rules and regulations requiring them ''to
jump through hoops both too high and too small'' in order to qualify
fully.
He said: ''About 1000 doctors each year have actually applied and have
been refused by the GMC in the recent past.''
Yesterday's case cost #20,000 to bring and could never have been
launched without legal aid, he added.
''This is the attractive face of the legal aid system,'' he said.
''Justice would never have been achieved without it.''

VICTIMS of Thalidomide yesterday called on the Government to set up a
public inquiry into the case of a doctor who admitted ending the lives
of two handicapped babies.
The Thalidomide Action Group is furious over the disclosure by Dr
Richard Nicholson, editor of the Bulletin of Medical Ethics, that he
took part in ''mercy killings'' as a junior doctor 20 years ago.
Mr Freddie Astbury, 35, chairman of TAG, who was born without arms or
legs, said: ''We want Virginia Bottomley to set up an inquiry into this.
Thalidomide victims -- who in many cases lead independent lives
despite their handicaps caused by a sedative drug taken by mothers
during pregnancy -- are furious over Dr Nicholson's admission in ITV's
3D current affairs show to be screened tomorrow.
Mrs Nuala Scarisbrick of the pressure group LIFE urged doctors to send
handicapped babies to the charity's new baby hospice in Liverpool rather
than kill them.
A viewers poll carried out by GMTV, showed 81% thought it acceptable
for doctors to take the lives of severely handicapped children.
A total of 13,961 called the programme's hotline to back the doctor's
actions, while only 3186 viewers said it was never acceptable.
However, chairman of the British Medical Association Ethics Committee
Stuart Horner yesterday ruled out advocating any change in the law.

A LAWYER yesterday accused the Crown of making a mockery of the Bail
Act.
Mr Alan Miller was speaking after representing three M77 protesters
who appeared at Glasgow Sheriff Court on breach of the peace charges.
Thomas Dyamond, 23, of Calfhill Road, Pollok, Ian Bogle, 34, of
Warriston Crescent, Carntyne, both Glasgow, and Lindsay Keenan, 30,
whose address was accepted as the ''Pollok Free State'', were freed on
bail.
But they had to agree not to approach, obstruct, or interfere with
contractors, workmen, plant, or equipment at the construction site in
Pollok.
Mr Miller told Sheriff Brian Lockhart that Keenan, who made the
pickaxe allegations against former Government Minister Allan Stewart,
lived on the site and would automatically face arrest if he attempted to
return to his home.
He also told the sheriff that two protesters who appeared in court on
Friday and went to prison rather than agree to the same conditions had
been freed on bail 20 minutes earlier by another sheriff in the same
court building.
This happened after the Crown agreed to drop part of the conditions
saying they must not approach the site.
However, Sheriff Lockhart said the conditions were appropriate.
Later, Mr Miller said: ''The Crown is making a mockery of the bail
system.
''It has accepted that Keenan lives on the site, then tells him if he
returns to that address he faces arrest. It is a nonsense.''
All three men deny breach of the peace charges arising out of
incidents on Tuesday when the site was surrounded by police as
contractors moved in to fell trees.
Dyamond has also been charged with police assault and resisting
arrest.
His trial will be on March 2, Keenan's on March 3, and Bogle's on
March 10.

TWO more M77 protesters were arrested yesterday as builders Wimpey
conducted a game of cat and mouse with more than 100 activists gathered
at the Pollok Estate protest camp in Glasgow.
The most serious clashes in a day of comparative peace came early in
the morning when protesters were alerted to the presence of tree-cutters
in the woods adjacent to Haggs Castle Golf course.
Around 30 protesters, outnumbering the security force provided by
Wimpey, quickly surrounded tree-cutters in their four-wheel drive
vehicle while others climbed the threatened trees.
Two people were arrested after an incident involving protesters and
security guards in which one man is said to have been injured.
It was originally feared that Mr William Moore, 50, from Pollok, had
sustained serious back injuries, but he went home after treatment at the
Southern General hospital.
The arrested men are expected to appear in court today charged with
disorderly conduct and assault.
The police operation was heavily criticised by protesters. Ms
Catherine Davis, from Stirling, said: ''I was extremely shocked at their
heavy-handedness.''
Anger at the perceived role played by police was a constant theme of
protesters yesterday.
Representatives from Scottish Militant Labour, including district
councillors Tommy Sheridan and Nicky Bennett, angrily denounced the
police presence.
A news conference was called by anti-Criminal Justice Act body the
Scottish Defiance Alliance, to announce their decision to terminate
discussions with police and Wimpey.
The alliance also released plans for an illegal demonstration on
February 24, when it hopes thousands of people from all over Britain
will assemble in George Square for a march to the camp.
Mr Allan McCombes, a march organiser, said the campaign against the
Act would now centre on the camp dubbed ''Pollok Free State,'' with
further ''guerrilla'' demonstrations against the road planned.
Councillor Sheridan also wrote to Strathclyde's chief constable Leslie
Sharp yesterday, protesting at the deployment of officers from divisions
in Ayrshire and demanding their withdrawal.
Superintendent Louis Munn, spokesman for Strathclyde Police, said his
men had acted appropriately in very difficult circumstances, and
promised a full investigation in the event of any formal complaint.
He had no knowledge of Councillor Sheridan's letter, and insisted the
police would not discuss details of the deployment of officers in any
operational situation.
Wimpey spokesman Mr Iain McConnell, director of corporate relations,
said: ''We are determined to build this road. We have been contracted to
do a job and we will do it.''
The company had been able to continue work at three sites on the
road's route yesterday, he added.
Meanwhile, 20 environmental radicals from England led a procession of
cars from the camp to the headquarters of Strathclyde region in the city
centre, where around 60 protesters mounted a noisy 20-minute
demonstration.
A bag full of sawdust was dumped on the office's doorstep by one
activist, who yelled: ''Put that back together.''
One car was temporarily chained to a railing, but was unlocked when
the group was asked to move on by police. No arrests were made.
The group had travelled overnight from Oxford and Brighton when they
heard of Tuesday's tree-felling at the Pollok Estate camp.
A Strathclyde region spokesman said a policy decision had been taken
and would not be reversed.

OPPOSITION to the M77 has been hijacked by outsiders, who have
obscured the case for the extension with gimmicks and violence, local
MPs claimed yesterday in an effort to shore up support for the project.
Four Ayrshire Labour MPs and former Scottish Office Minister Allan
Stewart said one-sided reporting of the running battles between
protesters and builders Wimpey in Pollok Estate give the impression that
the work might be stopped.
The MPs claim that the case for the project has been pursued --
without violence -- by politicians and local residents for almost 20
years. The M77, they said, is essential to Ayrshire's economic
development and for reducing the accident rate on the A77.
''We've secured it, it's gone through all the proper procedures, work
has started, and now there's an uproar,'' said Mr William McKelvey, MP
for Kilmarnock and Loudoun.
''What is particularly offensive are those groups who come from
outside; they're practically rent-a-mob. The whole case is one sided and
lop-sided and the press enjoy reporting the activities of those who
cause excitement and problems but that will not save those who died on
the A77,'' he added.
Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, said it
was time to mobilise the majority of local people who support the
project: ''We intend to win the argument by force and reason, not by
gimmicks and protests.''
But he warned that people in Ayrshire ''are beginning to think that
there is a chance that it might be stopped''. If that happened huge
penalties would have to be paid to Wimpey for breach of contract.
The Ayrshire MPs -- Mr McKelvey, Mr Foulkes, Mr Brian Donohoe and Mr
Brian Wilson -- want the case in favour of the motorway to be made more
clearly, although they are not advocating public protests. They argue
the extension has the support of the ''overwhelming'' majority of
residents along the route.
Mr Donohoe, MP for Cunninghame South, said: ''The protesters had the
opportunity at the time of the public inquiry to express their views.''
He added that the lack of a motorway infrastructure was the cause of the
run-down of the ICI plant in his constituency.
Mr Foulkes said he had received letters from opponents in Edinburgh
and Glasgow. ''It's easy for them who already have access to the
motorway network to say 'no more road building, we've got ours'.''
The MPs say the extension has gone through all the statutory
consultation procedures and has been approved. They emphasise that it is
needed to link Ayrshire to the rest of the national motorway network, to
reduce congestion in the south side of Glagow, and to reduce accidents
on the A77.
They were joined in condemning the anti-M77 campaigners by Eastwood MP
Allan Stewart, who resigned last week as Scottish Office Minister
following a confrontation with protesters, at the construction site in
his constituency.
''There is a widespread feeling that the campaign is being hijacked by
outsiders, by cranks, by people with their own agenda. Yet there is
virtually universal support for the route.''

THE seventh Edinburgh International Science Festival opens next month
with a child-friendly theme.
A series of activities have been organised to stimulate the interest
of children as young as three in the world of discovery and innovation.
Speaking at the launch of the programme yesterday, festival operations
manager Julian Smith said: ''It is an exciting development because it is
bringing children in early to show that there is no reason that science
should be the same as it was when their parents were at school.''
A play-centre will use puppets and song, gooey slime, and other
interactive exhibits to introduce youngsters to basic science
principles.
For sevens and older there are various hands-on demonstrations from
genetics to electroplating and creating colours from chemicals.
The festival is now billed as the biggest such event in the world.
Last year it attracted 200,000 visitors.
*The festival runs from March 31 to April 17. The Herald is publishing
the official programme, copies of which will be distributed free with
next Wednesday's issue.

<HEADLINE>Former provost accused over house buying deals.  SNP claim Labour leader who bought five former council homes 'exploited Tory legislation'</HEADLINE>

THE Scottish National Party has accused the Labour leader of Falkirk
District Council of reprehensible behaviour in exploiting Conservative
legislation to buy five former council houses in Camelon.
The Nationalists claim it is another example of what it calls Labour
sleaze in Scottish local government.
Former bus driver Dennis Goldie, a member of the housing committee and
one-time provost, has bought the houses over a six-year period.
A spokesperson at Scottish Labour Party headquarters in Glasgow said
Councillor Goldie had told them that two of the houses were being left
to him in wills, and that he bought the three others at market value.
As to whether it was wrong for him to buy the houses under legislation
that Labour vehemently opposed at the time, the spokesperson said: ''He
and his wife have a property company. I wouldn't necessarily say that
purchasing a house is a problem.''
However, a senior Labour Party member in Falkirk disagreed. ''It may
not be illegal, but it's totally inconsistent with being a Labour
councillor to make money this way,'' he said.
''People who work all their lives, yet are lucky to have a roof over
their heads, will be disgusted.''
Falkirk District Council's register of councillors' interests shows
that Mr Goldie has an interest in DM Properties, a private company.
He and his wife, May, bought their own council house in Aitken
Terrace, Camelon, for #10,640 in 1988. The legislation allows tenants to
buy their own houses at a discount that depends on the number of years
they have been tenants.
A year later, Mrs Goldie's aunt, Mrs Veronica Moir, bought her council
house in Wilson Avenue for #9400. It was transferred to Councillor
Goldie and his wife three years later.
In 1990, Mrs Goldie's mother, Mrs Mary Mitchell, bought her council
flat in Simpson Street for #5775, and it was also transferred to
Councillor Goldie and wife May three years later.
Tenants who buy council houses at a discount have to pay back the
discount if the house is subsequently sold within three years.
Councillor Goldie also declared an interest in a house in Telford
Square which was bought in 1993 from a couple for #23,500. Last year the
Goldies took out a bank loan to buy a flat in Watling Avenue for
#29,000.
This flat is now rented out, as are two further flats in the area that
were bought by Councillor Goldie's son and daughter and in which he also
declared an interest.
Mr Goldie's only employment was listed as councillor. His annual
allowances are #5240.
Yesterday, he was upset at The Herald taking pictures of his
properties. His only comment on the purchases was: ''I have made a
public declaration of interest. It's there, and I have no further
comment to make on that.''
His SNP opponents were, naturally, more forthcoming. The new Falkirk
council to be elected in April is one the nationalists have targetted,
having won 12 of the present council seats to Labour's 16.
SNP group leader David Alexander said: ''I don't believe a socialist
or self-proclaimed socialist should be taking advantage of Tory
legislation in such a fashion.
''There are 12,000 on Falkirk's waiting list of whom 5000 are waiting
for their first home.
''I don't know how Councillor Goldie can justify his actions to young
people coming along to his surgeries who cannot find somewhere to live
because the council has not built a single council house for years.''
The SNP's attempts to exploit Mr Goldie's position comes in the wake
of its campaign of claiming that Labour's long-running control of many
councils in Scotland is just as sleazy as some of the exploits of
Cabinet Ministers.
In the past the SNP has made great play of criticisms of
Labour-controlled Monklands and Motherwell district councils.
It argues not that Labour councils are inherently corrupt, but that in
many places they have been in power for so long that the differences
between right and wrong have become blurred.
Frances Horsburgh, Local Government Correspondent, writes: Senior SNP
councillors yesterday gave a preview of the kind of hard-hitting
anti-Labour campaign they intend to pursue in the run-up to the
elections for the new single tier authorities on April 6.
At a news conference in Edinburgh they singled out for attack the
property dealings of Councillor Goldie and the plans by Glasgow District
Council leader Pat Lally to rebuild Tait's Tower.
SNP headquarters chief executive Michael Russell said of Mr Goldie's
actions: ''This is an example of the use of the right-to-buy legislation
in order to allow for personal gain.''
The cost of Councillor Lally's plan to rebuild Tait's Tower, part of
the Empire Exhibition in 1938, was also attacked.

THE SNP MP for Moray, Mrs Margaret Ewing, is seeking a meeting with
Scottish Office Health Minister Lord Fraser over what appears to be a
growing crisis at Moray Health Services Trust Board.
Yesterday two of the five #5000-a-year non-executive directors
resigned in the wake of last week's unexplained resignation of the
Trust's chief executive, Mrs Elizabeth Hogg.
It is understood the resignation from their posts of Mrs Marjory Adams
and Mr Willie Phillips is linked to the resignation of Mrs Hogg and the
behaviour of other board directors in the events leading to her
departure from the #47,000 job she had held since April 1993.
There has been speculation there was a personality clash between Mrs
Hogg, 55, and medical director Dr Bryan Heap, who had moved last year
from Norwich.
Yesterday Mrs Adams said it was with sorrow and after much thought
that she had tendered her resignation. She has written to Lord Fraser
and to Mr James Snedden, the chairman of the board, explaining her
reasons.
In the letter, she said: ''Sadly the events of the last two weeks have
led me to believe that the trust and openness which the Trust Board
strived for have broken down. I therefore feel unable to continue to be
part of the board.''
Mrs Adams last night declined to expand on her statement. ''All I will
say is that anyone who knows me will be aware that I would not resign
unless it was something very serious.''
Mrs Ewing said: ''In her work on the Trust Board, Marjory was an
excellent and committed non-executive director who strove to ensure the
best possible delivery of all aspects of the health service.''
Mrs Ewing also praised the efforts of Mr Phillips.
''I am now so concerned over recent events in the Trust Board that I
am seeking an early meeting with Lord Fraser. The loss of Marjory Adams
and Willie Phillips, added to the as yet unexplained resignation of
chief executive Elizabeth Hogg, is a blow to the community and a full
investigation must be instituted.''
Concern was also expressed by the chairperson of Moray Trades Council,
Mr Conal Smith, who said he was seeking a meeting with the board for
clarification.
Last night a Scottish Office spokesman said they had not received the
letter from the non-executive directors and therefore could not comment
on the circumstances which might or might not have prompted their
action.
In a statement, the trust said the resignations had been accepted with
regret and both members had made a significant contribution to its first
two years.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday won the support of the main
steelworkers' union in his bid to rewrite the party's constitution.
The Iron and Steel Trades Confederation said that it was formally
backing the plan to rewrite Clause 4, even though the precise wording of
the reworked clause had yet to be divulged.
The ISTC claims to be the first union to express official public
support for the change, following a consultation exercise among its
40,000 members.
However, leaders of the shopworkers union Usdaw and the Manufacturing
Science and Finance union have made it clear they hope to steer their
unions in the same direction.
Conversely the train drivers' union Aslef has emphasised there can be
no change in Aslef's support for retention of Clause 4, which demands
public ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange.
The Rail Maritime and Transport union has been almost as firm, with
its only concession being a readiness to accept the inclusion of
''ownership or control''.
All trade unions, which together control 70% of Labour Party
conference votes, are considering their positions.

THE DEATH sentence that threatened to end the short but eventful life
of a dog called Slitz has finally been lifted.
Now the five-year-old bitch's owner is free to walk her through the
streets and parks of Peebles without fear.
Owner Mr Andrew Cleghorn, 32, and his pet can enjoy the freedom of the
Borders town following a decision by depute procurator-fiscal Mr John
Napier not to challenge a sheriff's ruling that Slitz is not a pit bull
terrier.
It meant that the bricklayer and his dog could be reunited after being
separated for more than three months.
Slitz was impounded last November and kept in custody pending the
outcome of a trial in which Mr Cleghorn, of Dickson Place, Peebles, was
accused of being the owner of a pit bull terrier.
A guilty verdict or a successful appeal by Mr Napier against Sheriff
Nigel Thomson's ruling last week would have meant death for Slitz, who
is not registered as a pit bull terrier under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs
Act.
Agonisingly for Mr Cleghorn, Slitz could not walk free on Sheriff
Thomson's decision. She had to remain in a cat and dog home for the
outcome of any appeal or -- as it turned out this week -- the signal
from Mr Napier that he would not challenge the sheriff.
Yesterday, while a delighted Mr Cleghorn was at work, Slitz was being
cared for by a friend.
Mr Cleghorn acquired Slitz in exchange for a choice section of frozen
salmon when she was introduced to him as a Staffordshire cross pup in a
Peebles pub.
On that occasion he was quaffing an American beer called Schlitz and
doctored the brand name to produce a handle for his new pet.
The trial evidence included conflicting opinions from vets on Slitz's
likely pedigree.
Sheriff Thomson preferred the view of the defence vet and gave her a
glowing character reference, saying that there was no indication of
aggression in her disposition or temperament.
He also criticised the law on dangerous dogs, describing it as ''most
curious'', particularly because it put the onus on the defence to prove
its case -- the opposite of the norm in criminal law.
Last night, Mr Cleghorn said: ''I only hope that the publicity in this
case helps other people and their dogs, who might be in the same
position, realise that you can fight this law and win.

<HEADLINE>Euro ruling brings ban on crating veal calves closer</HEADLINE>

A EUROPEAN Union-wide ban on the crating of veal calves came a step
closer yesterday when the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly
against the practice.
The decision is not binding on EU member states but it will reinforce
British-led efforts in the Council of Ministers for a total ban on
crating. The practice, denounced by animal welfare activists as cruel
and unnecessary, has led to mass protests and the death of a woman
demonstrator in the south of England.
One of the leading anti-crating Euro-MPs, Conservative James Provan,
who formerly sat for North East Scotland and now represents an English
seat, said later: ''This is a major step. It is now up to the council to
make a decision and I believe this one last shove may be the crucial
one.''
Mr Provan's resolution calling for a total ban received strong
cross-party support. He also won backing for shorter journey times for
animals being transported to slaughter. The council is due to meet in
Brussels on Monday when animal welfare is on the agenda.
He said: ''This vote should give the council a prod in the right
direction. The pressure is now on the French presidency to take action.
They hold the key as most member states have supported William
Waldegrave's tough stance on animal welfare.
''We are now closer to ridding Europe of these appalling methods of
veal production than at any time. I hope the council acts soon to carry
through Parliament's clear demands.''
At Mr Waldegrave's request, the European Commission is bringing
forward a review of the practice of crating calves for veal production.
Meanwhile, the council is looking at ideas for cutting journey times for
animals bound for slaughter houses.
The Parliament surprisingly rejected a Greens-sponsored resolution
expressing deep shock at the death during a recent demonstration in
Coventry of animal rights activist Jill Phipps. Euro-MPs said later the
decision did not mean they were unsympathetic.

MR JIMMY Airlie has decided not to stand for the vacant presidency of
the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union and will take early
retirement in November 1996.
The former leader of the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders sit-in will continue
in his post as AEEU executive councillor for Scotland until his 60th
birthday, when he will take advantage of an early retirement scheme
designed to whittle down the two dozen or so national officials to about
half.
Last weekend, he confirmed to AEEU colleagues in Glasgow he had opted
to go early and would not be standing in the election to find a
successor to Mr Bill Jordan who vacated the AEEU presidency on being
appointed the first British general secretary of the Brussels-based
International Confederation of Free Trades Unions.
This weekend he will be attending a meeting of the AEEU left-wing
Gazette group in Preston, Lancashire, which had hoped to convince him to
stand.
With the loss of their most effective candidate, it is now expected to
select London and South East executive councillor Roger Butler to be the
left's standard bearer.
With AEEU engineering section general secretary Sir Gavin Laird also
due to take early retirement next summer, Britain's largest
manufacturing union will soon be without a Scottish presence at the top
for the first time in over 20 years.

BBC Scotland's local news coverage will be a major beneficiary of the
director general's latest improvement plans, unveiled in London
yesterday.
Next month will see a significant expansion to both the length and the
frequency of its bulletins and, for the first time, it will become a
seven-day operation.
In what is described as the BBC's pledge to keep ''its finger on the
nation's pulse'', Mr John Birt has announced details of a new strategy
designed to bring the organisation closer to its audience. It wants to
appeal more to younger and needier people and to those living outside
the South-east.
Mr Birt said: ''The heart of BBC tradition has always been that you
put before the public things they don't know about, but when they see
them they love them and sometimes are utterly delighted by them. That is
what we will continue to do.''
The moves follow the BBC's biggest audience research project.
It shows that, though viewers and listeners recognise the authority,
quality, and integrity of the service, those furthest away from London
feel it should do more to reflect their lives and concerns.
Initially the Corporation is releasing an extra #85m from savings to
finance new ideas arising from the review. Among the ambitious projects
is a 26-part history series, The People's Century, which at #13m will be
the biggest documentary made by the BBC. There will also be a new
(radio) festival of live music, new drama, entertainment and leisure
programmes, and a special Science Week '95.
In Scottish terms, however, the most immediate benefit will be to news
gathering. BBC Scotland is to have its 12.50pm bulletin expanded from
five to eight minutes and its key 9.30pm bulletin expanded by 1min.
15secs.
For the first time the station will also find itself with a
four-minute Scottish news slot on a Sunday (just before Songs of
Praise). Previously, BBC Scotland's news department has never operated
on the Sabbath.
The strategy document also announces a plan to establish a new monthly
Scottish current affairs programme in the Question Time slot on Thursday
evenings plus improvements in travel and weather information and the
strengthening of election coverage.
Scotland is also to benefit from a #300,000 ''fast response vehicle''
which, when linked to either a satellite or a microwave link, will make
it much easier for reporters to deliver live reports from the scene.
Mr Ken Cargill, head of news and current affairs at BBC Scotland, said
that, in the longer term, they hoped to introduce a greater opt out for
news and current affairs in the late evening. London, he said,
recognised the fact that Scotland had a different agenda and needed more
time to cover items which did not necessarily fall into the news
bulletins.
The national review was headed by BBC1 Controller Alan Yentob and the
managing director of BBC Network Radio, Ms Liz Forgan.
Mr Yentob admitted the BBC had been ''a bit lazy'' in recognising the
need to respond fully to changing audience needs. However, the number of
factual programmes at peak time on BBC 1 meant it had ''no chance'' of
matching the ITV record of nightly popular dramas. Nevertheless, it
intended to find resources to increase investment in BBC 1 drama.
Meanwhile BBC Radio Scotland confirmed yesterday that it is to axe the
Annie Webster programme, which is produced in Glasgow, after only seven
months.
It is understood that the Tom Morton programme, broadcast from the
Inverness studios at 11am, will be moved to Ms Webster's early morning
slot and that Edi Stark's afternoon show, The Slice, which comes from
Aberdeen, will be moved forward in the day.
Ms Webster will continue to front the programme until April.
* The BBC was strongly criticised yesterday for alleged political bias
by a leading Cabinet right-winger. Welsh Secretary John Redwood accused
it of being dominated by an ''Islington Blair-band'' who dictated what
was right and wrong in society.
Mr Redwood singled out the treatment of the Rowntree Foundation report
which identified a growing gap between rich and poor. He claimed that at
no stage did the BBC attempt to analyse or question the data.
He told Tory supporters in Wokingham, Berkshire, that Monday's
Panorama programme went out of its way to draw a series of invalid
distinctions in the health prospects of two young mothers-to-be from
wealthy and poor backgrounds in Glasgow.

THE Prime Minister and key Cabinet colleagues have agreed a game plan
for the next stage of the peace process for Ireland which will go to the
full Cabinet today. Next week final decisions will be taken, as Unionist
storm clouds gather.
Yesterday, after two hours with the Prime Minister at No 10, the
Unionists issued dire warnings about the imminent London-Dublin
initiative, which is aimed at bringing the constitutional parties of
Northern Ireland into serious negotiations about the future of the
province.
They believe that, despite Mr Major's reassurances, there will be
proposed cross-border joint authorities. But, more serious, the
Unionists are alarmed by the prospect of London and Dublin appealing
over their heads to the people to sustain the peace movement, now that
the ceasefire has lasted nearly five months.
Mr Major summoned his Cabinet Northern Ireland Committee last night to
assess the situation and to figure out a way to avoid a split with the
Unionists. This possibility is so serious, that Mr Jim Molyneaux, leader
of the Ulster Unionists, and Dr Ian Paisley, head of the DUP, are even
considering joining forces again.
Today Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, will report
to the full Cabinet.
He is seeking, along with the Prime Minister, approval to agree a
launch date with Dublin next week for a joint framework document,
mapping out the path for negotiations leading to a new Stormont Assembly
and ultimately a referendum in Northern Ireland about the future.
Yesterday the Ulster Unionists were beginning to bring out their big
drums again. They have been given a clear indication by Mr Major about
the London-Dublin document and they do not like what they hear.
Mr David Trimble said yesterday that he is ''extremely pessimistic''
about the way the peace process is moving.
He and two other Ulster Unionists have despatched a ''grim'' five-page
letter to Mr Major, declaring that they will not enter all-party talks
with Sinn Fein and others on the basis of what they call the
''nationalist agenda'' set out in the framework document.
Last night, Mr Major's meeting of Ministers, including the Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd, Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew,
Home Secretary Michael Howard, and Viscount Cranborne, the Cabinet
Minister in charge of the House of Lords, had to decide whether the
British Government has to steel itself for a test of nerve with the
Ulster Unionists.
Today the full Cabinet is expected to endorse a decision that this has
to be undertaken.
Yesterday Mr Trimble threatened that the Unionists could boycott the
next stage of all-party negotiations. ''If the document comes out and it
is as bad as some of the reports in the papers say, then I think we
would have to seriously consider that line, because there is absolutely
no point in going to discuss a menu, all of the items of which are
unpalatable.
''You are sending people the wrong signals and you will be driven into
the same sort of foolish compromises that destroyed so many Unionists in
the past.
''I think there is a very serious danger that the Government has made
a massive misjudgment of the situation.'' The Ulster Unionist leader Jim
Molyneaux sent three of his colleagues to see the Prime Minister on
Tuesday, because he wanted to be sure that when the issue comes to the
test next week Mr Major knows exactly the limitations of Mr Molyneaux's
influence.

SIR Russell Johnston, the MP for Inverness, Nairn, and Lochaber
yesterday made an eleventh hour bid to persuade Dr Brian Mawhinney, the
Transport Secretary, to use his powers to ensure the threatened Motorail
and Fort William sleeper sevices continue to run.
The Liberal Democrat MP's appeal follows the statement yesterday by
Sir Bob Reid, the retiring British Rail chairman, that he thought a
final decision would be made by Dr Mawhinney this week as to whether
there would be a formal consultation over the threatened services.
A Department of Transport spokeswoman, however, didn't think that an
announcement from Dr Mawhinney on consultation was imminent. If the
services were going to be withdrawn there would have to be consultation,
but it was not clear what form that consultation would take, she said.
Most still assume, however, that a formal consultation would require
the services to remain in timetables in the meantime, and probably after
Mr Roger Salmon, the director of rail franchising, has announced his
draft passenger service requirement in May.
In his letter to Dr Mawhinney, Sir Russell makes the case for
including the services in the ScotRail Franchise.
He says: ''It would be tragic if services promoted by British Rail for
the social and economic welfare of the Highlands are lost because of
Government policy on change of ownership.
''They are of the greatest local importance, as well as making a very
significant contribution to the tourist industry. Please ensure that
this does not happen.''
* NORTH Tayside conservative MP Bill Walker yesterday supported the
retention of the Motorail service between Scotland and England. He also
called for it to return its Scottish base from Stirling to Perth.

MR Jacques Santer's determination to press ahead with the abolition of
EU passport checks for internal journeys was made clear yesterday but he
diplomatically avoided a confrontation with the British Government by
glossing over the subject in a keynote speech.
Mr Santer, President of the European Commission, merely remarked in
his talk to the European Parliament that all EU citizens needed to have
their security guaranteed if a ''true frontier-free area'' was to be
created for the single market.
That was as close as he came to crossing Mr Major, who has threatened
a veto, if a proposed European directive later this year is seen in
Britain as jeopardising security at immigration points.
However, the removal of all passport checks for internal EU travel
remains firmly in the commission's work programme for 1995.
The programme was warmly recommended by Mr Santer. Germany, France,
Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, and Portugal have agreed to end
all internal border controls on their citizens from March 26.
Others plan to follow suit as soon as possible. The prospect of
Britain doing the same led to the resignation last week of Mr Charles
Wardle, a junior Minister.
Britain, worried about illegal immigration, could find support from
Denmark which is sceptical on the issue and perhaps Ireland, which has a
tradition of close co-operation with the UK, because of concerns about
terrorism.
Otherwise the Government, harassed by its Euro-sceptic rebels, appears
on yet another collision course with Brussels. Mr Major insists that a
declaration drawn up by Margaret Thatcher in 1985 at the conference with
set up the single market is sufficient to protect security at British
immigration points.
The declaration states that nothing in the single market legislation
will interfere with member states' right to take suitable measures to
protect themselves from terrorism and organised crime.
Euro-sceptics say this will not prevent a tidal wave of illegal
immigration to Britain through the Euro-back door.
Mr Santer also pledged to respect the timetable for creating a single
European currency, which the Maastricht treaty said could become a
reality in 1997 for some member states.
Britain has left the question of joining a single currency to
Parliament. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke has derided the idea of monetary
union before 1999.
''The timetable has been agreed,'' Mr Santer said. ''I am simply
asking that we stick to it.'' He said his priorities would include
fighting EU fraud, helping industrial competitiveness, and working on
information technologies.

THE feel-good factor took a beating yesterday, but pressure for a
panic rise in interest rates abated and the battered pound held its own.
Headline inflation jumped from 2.9% in December to 3.3%, its most
menacing level for 28 months, and the underlying rate rose from 2.5% to
2.8%, the first time it has been in the top half of the Governmment's 1%
to 4% target range for nearly a year.
The City was reassured by an unexpectedly large drop of 0.9% in retail
sales in January and inflation figures no worse than feared.
Rising inflation and falling sales suggest that the consumer is being
squeezed by recent rate increases and higher taxes.
Further tax rises will take effect in April and even if an early rate
hike is avoided base rates, raised to 6.75% earlier this month, are far
below the peak of 8% to 9% forecast by most City economists.
The pound took heart from the evidence that the economy might not be
over-heating after all, but it remains vulnerable to further outbreaks
of internecine strife in the Conservative Party and disturbing economic
pointers.
The retail sales figures gave the strongest indication so far that
consumer spending was slowing. Sales were only 0.2% higher by volume
than in January of last year and 0.7% higher by value.
The Retail Consortium, which represents 90% of Britain's shops, said
it was the worst performance since July 1992 and warned the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, not to raise interest rates again.
Other evidence of a slowdown in activity came from a 27,500 fall in
seasonally adjusted unemployment to 2,389,700 after drops of 51,000 and
46,000 in December and November.
In Scotland seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by 2400 to 209,800,
equal to 8.4% of the workforce and the lowest level for nearly four
years.
Monthly figures are volatile and there are dangers in drawing too many
conclusions from them. The inflation figures were hit by the higher
excise duties imposed in the mini-Budget to compensate for the revenues
lost when Parliament voted down the second round of VAT on domestic
power.
January's poor retail sales figures came after a bountiful Christmas
for High Street shops. But in the three months to January retail sales
were only 0.1% higher than in the previous three-months. The average
decline in unemployment in the latest three months was 41,000.
Average earnings growth held steady at 3.75% in December for the
seventh consecutive month. But the decline in unit labour costs fell
back from 1.6% in November to 0.6%.
Pay settlements have already started to pick up, and Inflation is
beginning to take off just as the wage bargaining season gets under way,
and trade union bargainers will be sure to use it to good effect.
The Government's golden scenario of steady growth with low inflation
is under threat.

THE Clydesdale Bank was last night accused of trying to ''buy off''
its employees in an attempt to limit the effects of tomorrow's strike by
branch staff.
Officials of the Banking, Insurance, and Finance Union expressed
surprise that the bank's decision, to add an extra 0.5% to the salaries
of most its 6000 staff, had not been mentioned during discussions
yesterday at the conciliation service Acas.
Those talks broke up after six hours, with no resolution to a dispute
over salaries. However, Mr Pat Lennon, the bank's head of human
resources, later told The Herald that the vast majority of staff would
receive the extra payment.
It will be in addition to imposed pay increases of between 3% and 7%
for staff whose work is deemed ''satisfactory'' under a controversial
performance-related pay scheme.
Mr Lennon said the new increase, which would be backdated to January
1, was intended to reflect yesterday's 0.4% rise in the headline rate of
inflation.
Asked if the move was intended to weaken the resolve of staff on the
eve of tomorrow's strike, he replied: ''That was not in our thoughts.''
However, Mr Hugh Roberts, Bifu's negotiating officer, last night said
the bank was ''obviously terrified'' by the prospect of industrial
action. ''They are trying to buy people off; it's a bribe, and I don't
think it will change the minds of staff.''
Bifu is demanding a 4% increase across the board, with an extra 2.5%
available on a performance-related basis.

RIOTING English football fans shamed their team and the game again
last night when they forced the abandonment of a friendly match with the
Republic of Ireland in Dublin. The referee stopped the match after just
27 minutes when English supporters in the upper tier of a stand started
raining missiles down on Irish fans below, injuring several people after
Ireland took a 1-0 lead.
Some of the English supporters had earlier been chanting: ''No
surrender to the IRA.'' Then they began ripping up seats and hurling
them at people below.
Women, children, and other England fans were among the targets.
The violence, which caused hundreds of fans to flee on to the pitch,
again raised questions about England's participation in international
games, and could even threaten their hosting the European Championships
next year.
Ireland had scored the only goal when sticks, pieces of metal, and
whole benches began to be hurled from the stand.
England captain David Platt appealed to the rioting fans to stop.
Instead, they turned on him and he had to retreat as a hail of
spear-like wooden splinters was aimed at him.
Police moved quickly to allow supporters in the lower tier to spill
out on to the pitch, and Dutch referee Denis Jol stopped the match.
The Garda cleared Irish fans from the ground first, leaving English
supporters in their sections.
Then, when it was announced over the public address system that police
were ready to escort the English fans to waiting ferries, a new cascade
of broken seats and iron railings came raining down on to the pitch, now
ringed by police with dogs.
The Garda moved among the fans, and there were clashes with police
using batons to control the troublemakers.
Chief Superintendent Patrick Doocey said there had been several severe
casualties. ''I personally saw one youngster hit on the head with the
point of a spike-shaped piece of metal that had been ripped off a seat.
He fell unconscious immediately.''
An emergency treatment unit was set up in a room alongside the West
Stand as casualties came in by the dozen. At least 20 people were
treated in St Vincent's Hospital. One was understood to have a skull
fracture.
An Irish fan in his sixties collapsed and died from a heart attack
while leaving the ground when the match was abandoned.
Later there were running battles in Dublin's O'Connell Street. There
were also scuffles at the port of Dun Laoghaire where some English fans
were escorted by police to ferries.
Police said a total of 40 English supporters had been arrested as well
as three Irish people.
Almost immediately after the riot, Mr Graham Kelly, chief executive of
the English Football Association, was facing questions over whether
England was now fit to host the European Championships next year.
Mr Kelly, who was at the match, said he was ''very distressed'' by the
incident.
Irish Sports Minister Bernard Allen, who was among the 46,000
spectators at Lansdowne Road, said: ''The English Football Association
has some answers to give us tonight.''
England manager Terry Venables condemned the fans' behaviour and said
because of the quick action of the referee, none of the players had been
injured. ''My reaction is the same as everybody else. We are appalled.
It is terrible. I haven't got words strong enough to describe how we
feel about this.''
Republic of Ireland manager Jack Charlton, a former England player,
reacted furiously, remonstrating with an Irish fan at one point for
appearing to retaliate.
He said: ''I have never known anything like it. I have seen a lot in
football but nothing like this.''
Even before the violence erupted, the atmosphere in parts of the
ground occupied by England fans had been ugly. Irish supporters claimed
they had been taunted before the start of the game.
One said: ''When they started singing God Save The Queen, the English
started jeering at us and some were shouting 'IRA bastards'. Things
calmed down as the game got under way but when Ireland scored it was
obvious there was going to be trouble.
''A few minutes later, I saw English fans beginning to rip up the
seats and throw them down towards the crowds in front of them.''
It was estimated that about 4500 English supporters were in the
ground.
A Garda spokesman said senior officers were aware there could be
trouble at the game because of the behaviour of a section of the English
support before the kick-off.
''Because of their behaviour last night and this morning we knew we
were facing a difficult situation,'' he said. ''We had made arrangements
but we hoped we would get better co-operation from the fans.''
Home Secretary Michael Howard condemned the hooligans for what he
called a ''disgraceful night'', and called for a full inquiry. ''I hope
as many as possible of those responsible will be speedily brought to
justice and dealt with very severely.''
At Westminster, Labour leader Tony Blair, a Newcastle United
supporter, said: ''The English fans are a total disgrace both to
football and to the country they claim to support.
There can be no excusing what they did. Their chanting was offensive
and potentially dangerous. Obviously this raises questions for the
football authorities. The game that millions love stands condemned once
more by a group of idiots who bring shame on Britain and contempt on
themselves.''
Labour's Tony Banks, a Chelsea supporter, said they should be
identified and banned. ''They're total trash.''
David Platt, speaking for his team, said he was ''angry and
disgusted'' with the behaviour of the rioting fans.
''Everybody who witnessed those scenes should be appalled and
disgusted. I am speaking for all the players and nobody can condone what
happened.''
English football had worked hard over the last fifteen years to combat
the problem of hooliganism but has now slipped ''right back to the
bottom of the ladder''.
He added: ''When something like this happens you don't fall back just
one or two rungs you go right back to the bottom.''
Platt, referring to the recent rioting at an Italian League match
between Milan and Genoa, the city where he plays for local rivals,
Sampdoria, said ''just two weeks ago English football was being held up
as an example to the Italians on how to curb the violence''.
''I now have to go back to Italy and face the same journalists who
wrote that.''
England player Alan Shearer said: ''It's a sad night for football.''
The thugs responsible should be ashamed of themselves, he added.
''It's a shame for soccer.''
Irish player Niall Quinn said: ''It was a horrible night. This will be
remembered for a long time. It has never happened here before. Let's
just hope everybody gets home safely.''
He said the violence was ''as bad as I've ever seen''.
The riot follows a litany of excesses by English fans at both club and
international level, the most recent at a World Cup qualifier against
Holland in Rotterdam in 1993.
A few months earlier England fans staged a pitched battle with police
in Oslo before a World Cup qualifier with Norway.
At the last European championships in Sweden in 1992 hundreds of
England fans rioted in Malmo, and during the World Cup in Italy, 246
England fans were deported from Rimini after a night of fighting.
In 1989, Polish and English fans fought on the streets of Katowice
after the teams drew 0-0 in a World Cup qualifying match.
Shortly before, the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had urged
the Football Association to consider pulling England out of the World
Cup after more than 100 fans were arrested when riots erupted after 0-0
draw with Sweden in Stockholm.
In the summer of 1988, hooligans caused mayhem at the European
Championships in West Germany, fighting pitched battles with German fans
in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf.
