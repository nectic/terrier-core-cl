SOUTH Africa's Shawn Lynch, suspended from British events for 12
months following a positive drugs test, has been stripped of his British
keirin title. Lynch lost the crown he won last month after the British
Cycling Federation decided to make the ban effective from the date of
the offence.
The move follows protests from the Scottish CU, whose rider, Steve
Paulding, was beaten by Lynch in the keirin championship. Paulding has
been awarded gold in the event, in which riders jockey for position
behind a pacing motorcycle before a final sprint for the line.

BARRY Sutherland gained the boost of a new job last week -- squash
development officer for the West of Scotland -- and now aims to start
the playing season in style this weekend, when he heads the Newlands
challenge in the European Club championships in Helsinki.
Sutherland has the backing of former caps Derek Ritchie and Alan
Frame, Irish internationalist Steve Richardson, and William Boswell and
Brian Garry in a team that won bronze medals last year.
But Frame admits that it will not be easy this time. ''Only four
players instead of five will take part in each match this year. That
will hit us hard, because strength in depth is our asset. A lot of teams
have imported world top-10 players at No.1, but that's something we
cannot afford.''
It is Sutherland who will face the toughest opposition, but he regards
it as a good test of his form as he bids for a place in the Scottish
team for the World championships in November.
Alison Bowie, who celebrated her 100th cap by helping Scotland win a
bronze medal at this year's European championships, leads Edinburgh
Sports Club in the women's European club event this weekend. Scottish
junior champion Lisa McKenna and Desni Nixon complete the Edinburgh
line-up.

THE World Boxing Organisation yesterday got tough with featherweight
champion Steve Robinson -- defend your title againstNaseem Hamed or the
title will be declared vacant.
The Welshman's manager, Guy Gardiner, has been given a 48-hour
deadline by the WBO to formally confirm that Robinson will fight leading
contender Naseem Hamed by the end of the month.
Robinson, however, is ready for the fight scheduled for Cardiff on
September 30, although a contractual problem has flared over money.
Promoter Frank Warren agreed a seven-fight deal with Gardiner,
containing all purses and conditions, so Robinson cannot really expect
any more cash. ''He will be paid exactly what's he's entitled to,'' said
Warren.
''In his time with me Robinson has had just one mandatory defence
(against Colin McMillan). His next mandatory is 12 month overdue -- and
that has got to be against Hamed.''
Hamed, the unbeaten WBO super-bantemweight champion, said: ''I'm sure
the fight will go on. Robinson says he's fit and ready to defend against
me. He says he's confident, but so am I. I think I can stop him in four
rounds.''
The Sheffield fighter has emerged as the most exciting prospect in
British boxing in recent years and will be strongly fancied to end
Robinson's reign.

WEST of Scotland are turning back the clock in an effort to recapture
their glory days. The Hamilton Crescent club, pipped at the post in
league and cup last term, have responded to their double disappointment
by handing the reins to veteran seamer Colin Mair for next season's
campaign.
Mair, who led West to a string of successes when he was last in
charge, replaces Jon Williams.
''At 42, this is obviously a short-term measure,'' said Mair. ''But if
the club feels I can help out I'm delighted to give it a shot.
''We're going through a transitional phase with a lot of promising
youngsters coming through. It will be my job to get the most out of them
and to groom a successor to myself.''
Mair led West to three Western Union titles and one Scottish Cup
triumph when he was last in charge in the late eighties.
A club official was delighted with the situation: ''I'm delighted with
the appointment. Colin is definitely the man to help this club back to
winning ways.
''The younger guys all look up to him and are already looking forward
to next season's action.''
* ASHLEY Metcalfe has been dropped by Yorkshire for the final
championship match after having refused a new two-year contract.

DUNDEE will be the centre of attention for hockey aficionados next
Easter, when the city plays host to the European Cup-winners' Cup and
also supplies one of the entrants, Bonagrass Grove.
This is the first time a major club tournament has been staged in
Dundee, but the sport has a strong base on Tayside and the Grove girls
hope to put on a show which will not only enhance their own image but
that of Scottish hockey.
Grove made the breakthrough on the domestic front last term -- they
finished runners-up in both the league and cup -- and should encounter
no great difficulty in making the adjustment to the international arena.
They have many outstanding players in their side, including Alison
Ramsay, Pauline Robertson, Susan Fraser and Audrey Sime, and it is well
within their capabilities to emulate Edinburgh Ladies, who won the
European title two years ago.
The European Hockey Federation have also confirmed that the men's
representatives in the Cup-winners' Cup, Gordonians, will be the guests
of HDM in The Hague.
In the club championship, Grange will travel to Prague, while Western
Click Photopoint, who will be making their fourteenth successive
appearance in the women's tournament, will be competing in Germany at a
venue to be decided next month.

THE season is not yet a fortnight old, but already the focus is on the
widely divergent fortunes of two premiership clubs who just six months
ago were battling it out for championship honours.
Tonight, as the SRU Tennents Premiership embarks upon a full programme
of nocturnal matches, championship runners-up Watsonians sit at the top
of the table while champions Stirling County prop up the bottom.
Early days, but there is no denying the fact that, as Watsonians gird
the loins for a local derby against Heriot's FP with a better than even
chance of making it three wins in a row, County are in the unusual
position of viewing the Bridgehaugh visit of Edinburgh Academicals with
more than the usual trepidation.
For Stirling it is a case of two down but still 12 to go, and for
coach Brian Edwards, as his side seeks to log that first championship
win tonight, the watchwords are focus and calm.
''What's gone wrong? Well, there are 101 things I could talk about,
but the main thing now is to get the lads focused on where we are going
and what it is we are trying to do.
''Really, this is all just part of the growing-up process and the side
are having to learn to overcome all of the media attention and the
adulation from last year. We have to concentrate on what made us
champions, and that is playing rugby.
''We have to have the inner patience to build up to a winning position
and get back the control, confidence and the calm that we had last
season. However, we're not panicking.
''In the opening game against Hawick we lost by a drop-goal in the
last minute and on Saturday against Watsonians the end result would have
been a lot closer if we hadn't taken so many wrong options at crucial
points and if we had taken the opportunities that we had worked for.
''Once we've managed to cut out the silly mistakes then we are more
than capable of beating any team in the league.''
Tonight Stirling field Scott Crawford in place of right winger Angus
Turner, who is unavailable because of business commitments, while
regular scrum half Kenny Harper is still nursing a rib injury and new
recruit Murray Fraser, who has had a premiership baptism of fire, must
try once again to forge a workable link with Mark McKenzie.
Edwards is not thinking of sending out at SOS to boost the playing
squad at Bridgehaugh. On the contrary, he is dismissive of what he terms
the ''short-termism'' which has seen many first division sides
recruiting heavily from the Southern Hemisphere.
This could be construed as a dig at Watsonians, who have cast their
net certainly as wide as some division one rivals during the close
season. However, there is little doubt that, with the John Connor cash
injection and additional responsibilities for Gavin Hastings likely to
be confirmed any day now, 'Sonians are currently flavour of the month.
They are now the premiership pace-setters with all the pressure that
implies. Yesterday coach Peter Gallagher declared: ''We're the side that
everybody wants to knock off our perch, but I think we can live with
that. After finishing runners-up last season there is now an expectation
at Myreside which hasn't been there for a few seasons.
''Also, with all the publicity that we have had over the summer the
club has a higher profile than it has had for years. However, even
though we have a young side there are old heads there for guidance and
I've no doubt that we can live with the pressure.''
Gallagher is only too well aware that there are many hours of rugby to
be played before the championship is decided in mid-November. ''This is
all new to everybody. The eight-team leagues and the home and away
nature of the premiership mean that we're dealing with the unknown. We
beat Stirling on Saturday, but we know that we have to beat them again
at Bridgehaugh and who knows what will happen then.
''If we can win all of our games in the first round, if you like, then
I would see that as a strong position to challenge for the title, but
until then nobody can really say how the new set-up will turn out.''
Watsonians have John Kerr in for Graham Inglis on the right wing,
ex-London Scottish and GHK flanker Craig Brown in for the injured John
MacDonald and Colin Campbell restored in place of Duncan Gray. Heriot's
are unchanged from the side which defeated Hawick at the weekend.

THE Presidential Palace and, indeed, Steaua Bucharest, the former
military team, themselves were always reminders of a dark and oppressive
recent past and in an ideal world the more fortunate would do more to
help Romania recover from the appalling effects of Nicolae Ceaucescu's
reign.
However, there can be no philanthropy from Rangers tonight in the
Steaua Stadium.
In terms of finance and facilities Rangers are here as visiting
aristocrats, but money alone is not enough to survive the rarefied
atmosphere of Champions' League football, where the only real currencies
are technique and flair.
Steaua are far from poverty stricken when it comes to playing genuine
football. If given too much space, they are liable to display all their
skills which were only partially shown when they played at Ibrox in a
pre-season tournament. They lost 4-0 and while Walter Smith has been
telling his players to dismiss that result, the Romanians are using it
to galvanize their squad.
''Our players were hurt by that match,'' said Steaua's president Ion
Alexandrescu, ''and they want to take some kind of revenge. Also, they
know that if we are to get back among the elite in Europe, we must begin
by beating Rangers.
''This group we are in with Rangers, Borussia Dortmund, and Juventus,
is the most powerful and also the most difficult one. And so it is
important to be properly prepared, but it will be hard because most of
the players at Rangers are internationalists and their foreign players
are among the best in Europe.''
The president neglected to point out that many of his own players also
are internationalists, but that truth has not been lost on Smith, who
knows Steaua presents a daunting obstacle to his team's progress.
''They can play all right,'' was his typically uncluttered assessment
of a team which he has studied closely. He is understandably relieved
that Marius Lacatus, Steaua's main flair player, is suspended, along
with right-sided defender Aurel Panait.
''Steaua are an attacking side, very aggressive, and also very
athletic with their main strength lying in their overall team play,'' he
added. ''Lacatus was the one who would have given them that little
something special.''
However, it would be foolish of anyone in Rangers' party to believe
Steaua will be unable to produce the unexpected, because Eastern
European teams are technically proficient and capable of finding holes
in the best of defences, and if that happens tonight Adrian Illie and
Ion Vladoiu, who achieved a degree of infamy in last year's World Cup
finals in America, where he was sent off five minutes after having been
introduced as a substitute in Romania's game against Switzerland, will
be presented with opportunities to test Andy Goram.
Retaining possession will, in fact, be a key element and Smith is
likely to use a midfield of Paul Gascoigne, whose face was grinning out
from the sports pages of Romanian newspapers on arrival here, Charlie
Miller, and Brian Laudrup.
Stephen Wright and Alex Cleland, who will take over from the suspended
David Robertson, will be ordered to push forward in support leaving
Richard Gough, Alan McLaren, and Gordan Petric at the back, but even so
the midfield might be on the light side, especially if, as Smith says,
the Romanian champions are aggressively athletic.
With Stuart McCall and Ian Ferguson injured, the manager has no real
choice other than to go for touch and skill, which may be no bad thing
since these are the qualities every good side must have. Also, if Steaua
play with only Illie up, then Petric might be able to strike forward and
use his vision and passing to greater effect.
''It is not vital that we win the first game, but it is important to
start the Champions' League with something from this match,'' Smith
said. ''This is the first time the competition has offered three points
for a win and that will make a difference.''
Laudrup still remembers Rangers' ill-fated attempt to qualify for the
Champions' League last year, but he believes the team is much better
prepared this time and being identified as the main threat doesn't
bother him at all. ''It isn't about one player, because if I play well
and the rest of the team are off-form, it wouldn't be any good. We all
need to play well,'' he said.
Like a handful of his team-mates, who were beaten by Steaua in the
European Cup in season 1988-89, the Dane has played in the Steaua
Stadium before -- Denmark lost 3-1 to Romania in a World Cup qualifying
tie in 1989 -- and he would like to take some kind of recompense and
help set Rangers up for a successful series of games. ''I had three
years in German football with Bayern Munich and two in Italy with AC
Milan, and it would be good to return to these countries with Rangers
and upset teams there,'' he added.
He was referring, of course, to Dortmund and Juventus, who also play
tonight, and before setting off for training last night he had one more
thing to say: ''With 60 caps for Denmark, I have nothing to prove, but
it would be good to reach the quarter-finals with Rangers, where we
might play Real Madrid. Then I would be able to play against my brother
Michael.''
Laudrup stops there, unwilling to go any further, but not so Petric,
who also has played in Bucharest when he was with Partisan Belgrade.
They played Dynamo Bucharest and lost 2-1 a number of years ago. Petric
said: ''But Rangers are a big club and, with a little luck, we can win
the cup.''
Despite Petric's optimism that is an unlikely scenario, but at least
Rangers are back in the big time and approximately 500 of their fans
have followed them here. The city's police have been put on alert but no
real trouble is expected.

CELTIC'S players, and everyone connected with the group, have been
advised to stay away from the town centre of Batumi during their 24
hours in the Black Sea resort, writes Ken Gallacher.
The warning came from Parkhead security chief George Douglas as the
club left Glasgow yesterday.
He said: ''Certain areas can only be reached by going through police
controls and I recommend that you do not visit the town centre during
your stay.
''If you leave the hotel then you must walk in groups.
''Credit cards and cheques cannot be accepted, and valuables,
particularly your passport, must be kept safe.
''Do not depart from the itinerary which has been prepared for your
safety.''
Douglas visited Batumi last week and has warned the club that
conditions there are primitive and that security must be observed at all
times.
Celtic will arrive just 24 hours in advance of their European
Cup-winners' Cup clash against Dinamo, and after the match they will
leave directly for Istanbul, before returning to Scotland on Friday
afternoon.

EVEN if he emerged from his team's dressing room with a smile on his
face after Raith Rovers' 3-1 win over Akranes in the UEFA Cup first
round last night, manager Jimmy Nicholl was not waving any flags in
celebration yet.
''We still have a tie on our hands and we have a lot of work to do
yet. We were never fully in control of the game and in the end it was a
hard-working performance rather than a particularly good one.
''Their No.9 threatened us every time he got the ball, but all in all
I have to be pleased.
''We were disappointed at half-time when they equalised but I told the
players that it could still be 3-1 or 4-1 if we got stuck in.''
Nicholl added that if his team do get through in the second leg it
should be recognised that they will have been a very decent team, even
if they come from an unfashionable footballing country.
''They are a very tidy outfit and you could see for yourself the
quality players that they have. We were not on our game and it was when
we decided to change things about by putting on Ally Graham that things
came good for us.
''There was nothing pretty about it but it gives us a chance of
getting into the next round and I would have settled for that scoreline
before the start.''
Substitute Graham, whose height and strength unsettled the Akranes
defence, said: ''I was surprised at how physical they were and I was
sent on to try to change the pattern and get to high balls at the far
post. Their No.9 was brilliant but we have a great chance now of getting
through.''
Danny Lennon, who scored two goals, was gaining some recompense after
having missed the Coca-Cola Cup final in November. He said: ''It won't
be easy to get through yet because they are no slouches. In fact they
are very quick up front and we will have to defend very well.''
The only black spot for the Fife team was the news that the booking of
Julian Broddle means that he will miss the second leg in two weeks'
time.

CELTIC manager Tommy Burns yesterday revealed the reasons behind the
club's decision to take their own food and drinking water to Georgia.
As the Parkhead squad began their trek across Europe for their
overnight stay in Istanbul, Burns explained that Dinamo Batumi's
previous round opponents had been stricken with food poisoning just 24
hours before the game.
Burns said: ''We have found it very difficult to get information from
Georgia itself. But what we did do was contact Belgrade club Oblic, who
played them in the preliminary round. They told us that six of their
players suffered stomach cramps and sickness just the day before the
match. Clearly, they felt it was a big factor in their defeat.
''That is something we cannot risk. We would always have taken our own
food, but in this case the players have been told not to even clean
their teeth with tap water or eat salads. The Oblic team felt it was the
water that caused their players' illness.''
Yesterday Burns and his men flew to London, then made the five-hour
trip to Turkey, and today they face another three hours in the air as
they head across the Black Sea to Batumi.
But Burns said: ''I don't want to make too much of all the travelling.
I am not in the business of making excuses. After all, they will face
problems when they come to Glasgow.''
This is just the first of a series of important matches facing Celtic
-- Motherwell in the league on Saturday followed by Rangers in the
Coca-Cola Cup on Tuesday -- and, with that in mind, Burns decided to
leave injured Dutch striker Pierre van Hooydonk at home.
Burns said: ''Without the important matches we face I might have taken
Pierre, even if he was only 75% fit. But in these circumstances I
thought it better to allow him the chance to regain full fitness for the
game against Motherwell on Saturday.
''It has not been too disruptive to my plans, because there was always
the thought at the back of my mind that we might use Andy Walker in this
match.
''We do have slight problems regarding Tosh McKinlay and Andreas Thom,
who were injured at Pittodrie. But our hope is that both will be fit for
this match.''
Burns admits that he is less well prepared than he would have hoped
for his first European game as a manager. He said: ''It is always better
to see the opposition at first hand. You like to have that opportunity
and we have been denied it.
''But the Yugoslavs sent us videos and I have studied them. Batumi are
a team who like to pack the midfield and play the ball around in that
area. They don't go from back to front quickly. They don't play balls in
behind defenders.
''They like a patient, gradual build-up. So we have been able to
assess that and to work out our own tactics for the game.
''I am not going to be too concerned about how they play. I always
feel that these games are more about how we play. We will have the right
approach and I think we have the players who will get us a result.''
* CELTIC'S players, and everyone connected with the group, have been
advised to stay away from the town centre of Batumi during their 24
hours in the Black Sea resort.
The warning came from Parkhead security chief George Douglas, who
said: ''Certain areas can only be reached by going through police
controls and I recommend that you do not visit the town centre during

CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE ROUND-UP
JUERGEN Kohler, who played for Juventus against Borussia Dortmund last
season, aims to upset his former Italian team-mates tonight in their
Group C match in Germany.
The defender, who in June led a procession of ex-Juventus players to
Dortmund, was sent off for the second time in his career on Saturday in
a league match but can play in European competition.
Kohler, a member of West Germany's 1990 World Cup winning side, was
instrumental in Dortmund's downfall in the UEFA Cup semi-finals in
April, levelling the tie at 2-2 two minutes from the end of the first
leg in Italy.
Now he lines up in Dortmund colours but insists that this in not a
special game for him. ''I will continue to give everything but won't go
into the game against Juventus over-motivated,'' Kohler said.
He has rejoined former Juventus colleagues Stefan Reuter, Andreas
Moeller, and Julio Cesar. Reuter has declared himself fit despite having
to have blood drawn off a bruised knee at the weekend, but missing from
the team will be the suspended Gianluca Vialli and Fabrizio Ravanelli.
Blackburn manager Ray Harford will depend on the ''British bulldog
spirit'' when the English champions take on Spartak Moscow at Ewood
Park.
After a poor league start, Harford wants to return to the honest
virtues which earned their invitation to the competition.
''We played a high tempo game last year. We played with a lot of
passion, pace and power,'' said Harford. ''There's a feeling that that
doesn't work in Europe against better technicians. But if we can
pressure them in areas where they want to play, we'll see how good they
are.''
Defending European champions Ajax have called reserve striker Ignacio
Tuhuteru into their squad for their Group D opener against Real Madrid.
Kluivert was involved in a recent car crash in which the driver of the
other car was killed. Ajax are also without captain Danny Blind and
Arnold Scholten, both suspended.
Real were beaten at home on Saturday and have been hit by suspension
and injury. Michael Laudrup is out for three weeks with a calf injury,
while defender Quique Sanchez is suspended.
Legia Warsaw striker Jerzy Podbrozny has been ruled out of the Group B
home clash with Rosenborg, while Porto hope to have Carlos Secretario
fit to face Nantes in Group A. Panathinaikos travel to the Ukraine to
play Dynamo Kiev, and Grasshopper Zurich take on Ferencvaros in
Switzerland in Group D.

Stenhousemuir 3, Montrose 1
A HAT TRICK by Hutchison was the high point of a game which
Stenhousemuir dominated.
They opened the scoring in 22 minutes when a great move by Bannon and
Logan finished up with Hutchison shooting into the net.
A minute from the interval the striker scored a second, his shot
giving Larter no chance.
Montrose were a poor side and seldom looked like pulling the game out
of the fire.
The home side were awarded a penalty after 58 minutes, but keeper
Larter saved Hutchison's drive. Stenhousemuir eased the pressure with
two minutes to go, again through Hutchison, and Montrose scored a
consolation goal when McGlashan lobbed the keeper.

Dunfermline 2, Forfar 1
IN the wake of their swashbuckling start to the season, Dunfermline
stuttered to a rather unconvincing victory over Forfar last night at
East End Park.
Riding the proverbial crest of a wave following four successive
victories, the Fifers were made to work by a lively Forfar side who
refused to be overawed by the stature of their opponents.
It may have been something to do with the fact that local rivals Raith
Rovers were competing only 12 miles away in the infinitely more
salubrious UEFA Cup competition but, whatever the reason, the Pars
failed to exert any significant pressure on their opponents during a
laborious first half.
Forfar looked the likelier side with former Dunfermline man Mark
Bowes, and impressive Paul Hannigan both forcing excellent saves from
Guido Van de Kamp before the interval.
Then, with only three minutes played in the second half, the visitors
took a deserved lead when a cross from the left by Don McVicar was met
by the unmarked Dave Bingham, who headed powerfully into the net from
six yards.
However, Dunfermline moved into overdrive and equalised in the
fifty-first minute. A viciously struck inswinging corner from Derek
Fleming found Greg Shaw in front of goal and the striker's glancing
header eluded the arms of Gordon Arthur.
Dunfermline continued to lack penetration but, as extra time began to
fill the thoughts of the 2086 crowd, substitute Andy Tod moved forward
to meet Mark Millar's cross and his forceful header flew into the net.

STIRLING Albion withstood a spirited display from Alloa to eventually
win a six-goal derby thriller.
Alloa took the lead in 14 minutes, when a hopeful through ball by

poke the ball home.
Albion equalised in 25 minutes, and five minutes after half-time
Taggart chested the ball in after Balfour failed to cut out a cross.

Albion Rovers 1, Brechin 3
TWO goals early in the first half settled Brechin City at Cliftonhill
and they eased into the quarter-finals.
After Joe McBride had hooked a shot over the bar, the roof fell in on
Rovers.
In 16 minutes Ralph Brand drove goalward from about 25 yards and Marc
Osborne allowed it to slip in at the near post. Two minutes later Bobby
Brown had a simple job to tap in a Smith cross.
Six minutes later, Rovers were back in the game as a splendid
triangular move culminated in Paul Crawford poking the ball into an
empty net. The victory was assured in 62 minutes when a 25-yard Cairney
free kick slammed against the crossbar and fell at the feet of Ralph

Dundee United 3, Hamilton 0
UNITED manager Billy Kirkwood experienced both joy and despair as he
watched his side ease their way through into tomorrow's quarter-final
draw of the Challenge Cup.
Kirkwood could not help but have been impressed with the display by
comeback man Paddy Connolly, but on the other side of the coin, the
manager was despairing afterwards at an injury sustained by his other
comeback man, Scott Crabbe.
Not a Hamilton player was near him when he collapsed after taking a
free kick on the edge of the penalty area 15 minutes from the end.
United made their first breakthrough in 19 minutes. The game's
oustanding player, Scotland midfielder Billy McKinlay, raced to within
30 yards of Allan Ferguson's goal before unleashing an effort which, by
way of a deflection, forced the keeper into a quality parry.
When the ball broke out, Connolly was first to react and drove home
his side's opener from 10 yards.
United carved out chance after chance only to be baulked by either
slack finishing or Ferguson's outstanding handling. But even he had to
admit defeat again five minutes into the second half, when Connolly hit
a quite magnificent 20-yarder following a neat combination between
McKinlay and 18-year-old Paul Walker.
United wrapped things up five minutes from the end. McKinlay's
blistering 25-yarder was parried by Ferguson, but only into the path of
Grant Johnson, who promptly dispatched the ball into the net.
Accies Martin McIntosh was booked for a first-half challenge on the
unfortunate Crabbe.

Malmo 2, Nottingham Forest 1
FOREST manager Frank Clark said that his side were lucky to escape a
heavy defeat in Sweden.
This defeat ended an 18-match unbeaten run stretching to February, and
Clark claimed: ''We will have to do much better than that in the second
leg. ''On balance, a 2-1 scoreline flatters us because Malmo were better
in every department.''
Although Forest scored first through Ian Woan, they were indebted to a
string of superb saves by keeper Mark Crossley, but even he could not
keep out second-half strikes by Joakim Persson and Anders Andersson
which gave the Swedes a well-deserved advantage.
Clark took off his #2.5m striker Kevin Campbell early in the second
half. He had been doubtful before the game with a back injury but Clark
said: ''He looked a bit tired and flat. When Jason Lee came on he did
very well.''
Forest were fortunate near the end when an Andersson shot beat
Crossley, clip the inside of a post, and spin across the face of the
goal, eluding the lunging Petterson by inches.
But Just when it seemed survival was Forest's only option, they raised
a late revival and the largely anonymous Bryan Roy wasted a great chance
to level matters on the night, shooting tamely into the side netting
after Lee, unwittingly, unhinged Malmo's defence by lunging and missing
Stone's clever cross.

Rotor Volgograd 0,
Manchester United 0
MANCHESTER United's young side earned their battle honours last night
as they withstood a trying night in the Stadium of Heroes.
Manager Alex Ferguson said before the UEFA Cup first round, first-leg
clash he was convinced his youngsters had the guts and talent to take
all the Russian side could throw at them.
With Roy Keane limping out of the action after just 23 minutes, the
young Old Trafford players did everything the manager asked of them.
With Paul Scholes operating as lone striker, but Ryan Giggs and David
Beckham breaking quickly from midfield, United gained early ascendancy.
And in only the fifth minute they could -- and should -- have gone in
front.
Beckham turned well into space on the halfway line and fed Nicky Butt
on the right. He played in an angled ball to Giggs which the Welshman
met on the volley but could only direct across the face of goal.
Ferguson seemed happy with the score and sent on Paul Parker for
Scholes 19 minutes from the end, Giggs taking the striking role.
''It was a test for them but they didn't let us down and they all
worked very hard,'' said the United manager.
The Russians piled everything forward as the game wore on, but United
stood firm and deserved their draw.

Spartak Vladikavkaz 1,
Liverpool 2
JAMIE Redknapp celebrated Liverpool's return to Europe with a fine
30-yard strike that took the heart out of the Russian League leaders.
Redknapp's crowning glory came after 52 minutes, leaving home keeper
Xavier Harpov rooted to the sport as his shot sped into the top
right-hand corner, silencing the 43,000 fans who had seen their side
concede a first-half lead.
The game did not start too well for the English side. Mirdjal Kosynov
caught out Liverpool keeper David James from a free kick, and the home
side were in front.
Their joy did not last too long, however, and it was Steve McManaman
who did the business. He was picked out by a pass from Steve Harkness,
kept his cool before curling a right-foot shot into the net from the
tightest of angles.
The Russians made strong claims for a penalty when Tetradze picked out
Tedaev in the area and the Vladikavkaz player went down under a
challenge from Rob Jones. But to the relief for the small band of
Liverpool fans in the crowd, the referee waved aside the appeals.
Roy Evans' side continued to live dangerously, James needing two
attempts to smother after having mishandled a cross. However, Liverpool
grew in confidence as the game developed and must now strongly fancy
their chances of going on to triumph in the second leg at Anfield in a
fortnight's time.

Raith Rovers 3, Akranes 1
THE job is not yet done, but Rovers have at least given themselves a
real chance of reaching the second round of the UEFA Cup and taking on
the kind of classy names they have been seeking since they entered the
European community for the first time.
It was a night of fluctuating emotions at Stark's Park as the 5284
crowd at times cheered and at times feared, in a tie that was always
fascinating and entertaining. An early goal by Danny Lennon lifted home
hopes, but just when the picture began to look really bright Akranes
equalised just before the break.
To Rovers' credit they did not let their heads go down and with a
combination of grit and will came back to take the lead again, once more
through Lennon, and then scored the all-important third goal through
Barry Wilson. The tie is by no means settled but it is set for quite a
night in Iceland in two weeks' time.
The fear that Rovers would still be reeling from the thrashing by
Rangers at the weekend was quickly dispelled as the Kirkcaldy side went
about their business with verve and confidence.
It became clear very quickly that the Icelanders had come to Scotland
anticipating a defensive night. Raith decided to meet their request,
although their energy did not extend to producing many serious chances
in front of goal.
One genuine opportunity did fall to Colin Cameron after Tony Rougier
had caused problems on the left, but his hasty shot went much too high.
The next chance, in 14 minutes, that they created was used profitably.
Steven McAnespie laid the ball in front of Lennon just outside the
penalty area and the midfield man took careful aim before smacking it
out of the keeper's reach.
Rovers might have made it two four minutes later when a corner from
Wilson was met by Dennis, whose header was touched over at the last
second by keeper Thordarson. The Scots withstood a couple of
counter-attacks from Akranes before Wilson hit a tremendous 25-yard shot
which the Icelandic keeper did really well to parry.
Jonsson, who was the victim of one of Graeme Souness' infamous tackles
in an international 10 years go, was himself booked for a much less
contentious offence, dissent, as the Icelanders seemed to be losing
their hitherto excellent composure.
That, however, soon returned as they grasped the equaliser that made
such a difference to them just before half-time. It was goal they
scarcely deserved but accepted with understandable delight when Olafur
Thordarson took advantage of a ball that bounced off the shin of Dennis
to shoot home.
The Icelanders, buoyed by that goal, reappeared in confident mood and
a clever piece of play by one of the impressive Gunnlangsson twins,
Arnar, ended with a lob over the bar. The Icelandic twins then combined
to put the ball in the net, but this time Bjarki was declared offside.
In 65 minutes the locals had something splendid to cheer when Rovers
went in front again. A cross from Kirkwood was only half-cleared and the
every alert Lennon hit a left-foot shot into the corner of the net.
Suddenly, Akranes did not look quite so composed any more.
All their good work could have been wasted but for a splendid
clearance by Scott Thomson at the feet of Bjarki Gunnlangsson when a
goal seemed certain. They took full advantage of that escape in 78
minutes when Wilson, taking a pass from Cameron, shot home their third
goal.
Kirkwood was booked for a foul, likewise Broddle near the end, and
Ronnie Coyle replaced scorer Wilson but in a frantic finish Rovers hung
on grimly to the two-goal lead that could yet prove enough to take them
to the next stage.

KIWI Isaac Feaunati will make a quick-fire debut for injury-hit
Melrose today after an energy-sapping journey half-way round the world.
The 22-year-old Feaunati, who was born in Western Samoa, played for
Wellington on Sunday in a Ranfurly Shield match, then boarded a plane
for Scotland.
He arrived in the Borders on Monday night after a gruelling 26-hour
journey and was immediately penned into the line-up for tonight's match
against Hawick at the Greenyards. He will be joined in the Melrose side
by fellow New Zealander Nick Broughton, who will be making his first
full appearance.
Feaunati replaces Andrew Redpath, sidelined by a knee injury, while
Broughton takes Stuart Inglis' place at open-side. Craig Joiner is also
out with a leg knock, and Craig Chalmers will take over the Melrose
kicking duties from Gary Parker for the derby.

Monaco 0, Leeds United 3
INJURIES to two Monaco players, one former Rangers defender Basile
Boli, took the gloss from Leeds' stunning success in the Principality,
Tony Yeboah hitting a hat trick.
Boli and home keeper Marc Delaroche were knocked unconscious and taken
to hospital after having clashed heads after 80 minutes of the first
round, first leg last night.
The accident happened as Delaroche made an abortive attempt to stop
Yeboah scoring his third goal. ''The injury to these players has taken
some of the sting out of our celebrations,'' said Leeds captain Gary
McAllister.
Yeboah, on target after three, 64, and 80 minutes, has now scored 20
goals in 23 games since his $5.28m move from Eintracht Frankfurt. ''The
first goal was lucky but it made everything possible,'' said Yeboah.
''We were very strong and we fought from the very first minute.
''I was pleased with the second goal but it doesn't matter who scores
the goals. The fans give me great support and I am proud to be at Leeds.
''I don't think there will be any problem for us in the home match.
Normally on our grounds nobody can beat us. It is very special to get a
hat trick and the team performed very well. I am very happy.''
Monaco manager Jean Tigana was a little less chuffed: ''It was a
horrible night for us. Not only did we lose the match but we also lost
two players. I have no hope for the return.''

Ross Finlay finds the 400 and 600 series share family good looks
ONE glance at the Rover 400 and 600 is enough to make it clear that
they have been designed as the smaller and larger members of the same
family, except for the 400 Tourer, which is based on the previous
generation 400 design. Both ranges are fine-looking cars, well equipped
and at the top end of the market in their respective categories.
Available only with four-door bodywork, the 600 is the older and
larger design. It starts with the 620i at #15,295, and that same
two-litre 16-valve engine is fitted in different stages of tune, in
individual models with steadily upgraded trim and equipment levels, as
far as the 620SLi at #18,245.
While the 620i uses the engine in 115bhp form, which allows a 0-60mph
time of just over 10 seconds, a test-track maximum around 123mph and
fuel consumption returns like 43mpg at 56mph, 35 at 75 and 27mpg in
town, the Si and SLi have the advantage of a 131bhp output. That trims
some time off the acceleration figures, mildly increases the maximum
speed, offers stronger mid-range performance and, naturally, puts up the
fuel consumption to a certain extent.
The 623, as an SLi at #19,295 and a very well specified GSi at
#23,495, comes with a 2.3-litre engine with a noticeably higher power
output of 158bhp. This is a substantially brisker car on the road. Its
0-60mph time comes down to just over eight seconds, the test track
maximum speed rises to over 130mph, and the much stronger torque
provides better acceleration all the way through. Fuel economy alters to
40mpg at 56mph, 33 at 75 and 25mpg on the urban cycle.
Top-of-the-range cars include features such as air conditioning,
excellent upholstery and trim, and all those little touches like chrome
surrounds for the rear number plate which the 600 pioneered in its
class. Burr walnut inserts are neatly placed, and the Rover security
system is among the leaders in this category.
As well as those cars with the 2-litre and 2.3-litre petrol engines,
Rover has two very interesting additional power plants in the 600 range.
The company's own two-litre turbocharged diesel engine is fitted to the
SDi at #16,495 and the SLDi at #18,245. These are really strong
performers, able to reach 60mph in under 11 seconds, with imposing
mid-range pull, and remarkable fuel consumption figures for cars of
their size.
At 56mph they will manage about 70mpg, compared with 51 at 75 and
48mpg around town. Their ease of cruising, and their steady-speed fuel
consumption capability, make them impressive motorway cars.
Last of the 600-series engines is another powerhouse, the 200bhp
turbocharged two-litre petrol unit installed in the 620ti. At #20,495,
fitted with hydraulic engine mounting, traction control and much more
sporting wheels and tyres, the 620ti is a real high-performance
business-size saloon, capable of 0-60mph in seven seconds, a test track
maximum approaching 145mph, and yet reasonable steady-speed fuel
consumption figures like 46mpg at 56mph and 10mpg less at 75.
In recent years, Rover's body finish has improved almost
unrecognisably, and one of the strengths of the 400 range, which is
hardly offered at bargain basement prices, is that it shares in that
improvement. While the whole 600 range is made up of four-door saloons,
the present 400 comes only as a five-door hatchback, always excepting
the Tourer.
The entry-level model here is the 414 at #11,795, sharing the
1.4-litre version of Rover's well thought-of K-series engine with the
improved-equipment 414i at #400 more. Like the other 400s, these are
compact cars compared with the 600, but the standard of presentation
remains high. Paisley pattern trim fabric is an intriguing feature of
the interior design.
General performance is brisk for a 1400. The 414 will sprint to 60mph
in 11 seconds, and it has a test track maximum of 115mph. The curious
thing, when comparing it with the manual transmission 416 cars which use
the 1.6-litre K-series engine, is that the smaller capacity version is
unexpectedly close to the bigger one in performance, while the big one
is unexpectedly close to the small one in economy. The manual 416, at
prices from #12,995, should return 55mpg at 56mph, 43 at 75 and 29mpg in
city traffic. Its steady-speed returns are almost identical with those
of the 414.
As a #950 option over its usual #14,995 showroom price, the 416SLi can
be specified with automatic transmission. And here there is a curious
anomaly. Rover does not, at the moment, have its own automatic gearbox
to fit to these 400-series cars, and in this model uses not only a
transmission bought in from its previous partner Honda, but also a
1.6-litre Honda engine to go with it. The two 1.6-litre engines, one for
the manual car and the other for the automatic, are unexpectedly unlike
each other in their power delivery.
On sale only since May of this year, the quiet and refined 400, with
its pleasant balance of handling and ride, is a range in its early
stages. Two-litre petrol versions and diesels, will be available
shortly, and the plan for 1996 is to begin marketing four-door saloons
alongside the present hatchback choice.

LIKE several of the major manufacturers, Rover offers its own
financial package for new owners. Rover Select Finance was introduced
three years ago, with terms which were particularly competitive compared
with rival schemes, because although Rovers were priced above many of
their mainstream rivals, their trade-in values were also high. There is
a linked MG Select scheme to be put into operation when the new sports
car hits the showrooms.
The basis of the calculations is that finance is provided over a
two-year or three-year period. Two years is the more popular term. At
the end of it, the customer can either pay a certain guaranteed sum and
retain the car; or part-exchange it for another model from the Rover
range and enter into a new Rover Select agreement; or hand back the
original car with no more to pay.
On signing a first agreement, the customer has to decide how many
miles the car is expected to cover. Assuming that the car is in good
condition, the trade-in value predicted at the start of the period is
guaranteed. A reduction will be made if the mileage is exceeded.
The standard mileage bands are 6000, 12,000 and 18,000 per year,
although there is also a 24,000-mile option on the two-year repayment
scheme only.
The total cost, that is the deposit of between 10% and 40% plus
monthly repayments, as well as an administration fee and sales agency
fee added to the first of them, currently includes delivery to the
dealership, two years' warranty and servicing, a year's road tax and a
year's free AA membership. As a safeguard, there is an arrangement by
which the car can be exchanged, or the initial payment refunded, if the
customer is not satisfied during the first 30 days or 1000 miles.
A typical example would be of a Rover 414i, financed over two years
with an annual mileage of 12,000. The normal cash price is #12,781. A
25% deposit would come to #3195.25, there would then be 24 monthly
payments of #268.30, and the guaranteed minimum future value would be
#5970.

FOR most people, the idea of an auction salesroom conjures up images
of tagged and numbered furniture stacked to the ceiling and a cornucopia
of household artefacts and heirlooms decked out in front of potential
buyers as they pick and choose between lots.
For the past 153 years, the city's longest established auctioneers,
Robert McTear &amp; Co, in the heart of Glasgow, has been true to that
popular perception. Until now.
From the founding of the company in 1842, occupying premises in Argyll
Street, successive moves first took the business to the Glasgow
Salesrooms in Gordon Street, then to St Mary's Hall, Renfield Street,
before opening the purpose-built Royal Exchange Showrooms in St Vincent
Place in 1874.
Then, as now, the salesrooms held a fascination for the public,
mirroring the shifting patterns in taste and fashion. From the days when
the wealth and influence of the Tobacco Barons allowed the gentry to
reach out for every corner of the world and finance the amassing of
large and exotic collections, McTear's has seen art and antiques change
hands in this time-honoured fashion.
It was here the young William Burrell is said to have purchased his
first painting, only to re-sell it almost immediately due to a doubtless
embarrassing, though thankfully temporary, shortage of funds.
The Victorians were voracious collectors and, living in a time of
great commercial and industrial activity, many were able to indulge
their interest in life and art swept into Britain on the trade winds.
Their fascination for the unusual and the exotic ensured McTear's a
steady supply of ''varied and unrivalled'' goods, as its advertisement
in the Glasgow Herald in the 1850s proclaimed just eight years after
opening.
And so it was that as Glasgow gained the reputation as Second City of
the Empire, a visit to McTear's was often rewarded by much more than
family heirlooms and Scottish curios.
Collections of stuffed birds and animals from the Orient, African
masks, spears, vases, new fabrics and designs, all enthralled and
appalled Victorian sensibilities in equal measure. Little wonder
McTear's went from strength to strength. In that respect, little has
changed in the salesroom today. It remains a popular lunchtime meeting
place for buyers from all over the world as well as professional people
and the simply curious.
More recently, however, the salesroom was in danger of asphyxiation
from burgeoning traffic congestion. Back in Queen Victoria's Britain,
horse-drawn carriages brought prospective buyers to St Vincent Place in
grand style. Parking problems were unknown and goods were simply
delivered to the customer's door at a later date.
However, traffic congestion, parking meters and the attendant traffic
wardens in the Glasgow of today, and the introduction of one-way road
systems, ensured McTear's became a victim of its city centre location.
Getting goods in and out became an exercise fraught with difficulties,
while access for the buying public was limited almost entirely to those
on foot. The writing was on the roads for McTears, and it was decided to
look for larger premises with improved access outside the city centre.
The answer to the problem was found just a mile away in the basement
of the Clydeway Business Centre in Finnieston. Well lit and spacious,
with an outsized loading bay to the rear offering easy access to the
Clydeside Expressway, McTear's settled easily into the roomy new
premises. But would the customers follow?
Initial anxieties proved groundless as regular auction- goers followed
newcomers and locals into the salesrooms to enjoy the novelty of being
able to wander around the lots to touch and inspect the diverse wares.
In addition to the weekly sales of furniture and effects, McTear's also
conduct regular catalogued sales of fine jewellery, silver, porcelain,
paintings and antique furniture.
On request, representatives will arrange to inspect the contents of
mansions, dwelling houses and business premises before offering advice
on the most advantageous method of obtaining the best price for clients.
Arrangements can also be made for the uplift and removal of individual
items or complete contents of houses and offices to the salesrooms, for
inclusion in an appropriate sale.
McTear's valuation service extends throughout the country and detailed
inventories and valuations can be prepared for the following purposes:
inheritance tax; family division; current auction and liquidation;
willing seller and willing buyer; going concern; insurance (replacement
and indemnity).
But despite the new premises, with its ease of access and array of
services, the real attraction of the salesrooms, the charged atmosphere
of a busy auction in progress with bid and counter bid, remains
remarkably unchanged.
But this is, perhaps, the essential and evergreen fascination of the
salesroom. The uncertainty of the price. The weird and the wonderful
goods, coupled with the curiosity value of seeing the contents of other
people's houses and a glimpse into the minds of those who considered the
likes of a stuffed crocodile a fine piece for the drawing room. It also
offers the chance to buy goods no longer available on the High Street,
and even the possibility, no matter how remote, of picking up an
unrecognised piece for a song on a quiet day's bidding.
In short, it's the excitement of the auction, a quality which, during
150 years and more of trading, Robert McTear and Co have long recognised
and will continue to encourage.

<HEADLINE>British Coal steps up pressure on tenants</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>976404616</RECORDNO>

TENANT farmers who have been negotiating the purchase of their
holdings from British Coal yesterday accused the corporation of a
cyncial attempt to bully private individuals into accepting
responsibility for pollution and subsidence arising from past mining
activities.
James Wilson of Lumphinnans Farm, Cowdenbeath, said that tenants who
had received a legal offer from British Coal setting out conditions of
sale were coming under increasing pressure to conclude a deal.
''The latest conditons of sale are accompanied by a letter indicating
that there is no possibility of negotiation on the terms and that the
tenant should agree to them within one month -- and have his finance in
place at that time,'' said Mr Wilson, a member of the tenants' Scottish
committee.
The disagreement between the tenants and British Coal centres on who
will shoulder future responsibility for pollution arising from previous
mining operations. The farmers have insisted that British Coal should
accept specific responsibility and have that spelt out in the terms of
sale. The major banks have also expressed reservations about lending,
with a standard security, on property which could be subject to an
open-ended pollution damages claim.
Those tenants who have expressed an interest in buying but require to
raise a loan to complete the purchase would find difficulty in financing
the deal. The banks are still anxious to get assurances from British
Coal on the pollution issue before finalising any loans.
British Coal has refused to give any indemnity and insist that the new
Environment Act, which comes into force next year, will give adequate
protection under the ''polluter pays'' principle.
Its spokesman, Stuart Oliver, said the pollution issue seemed to be of
more concern in Scotland than in England. On a UK level nearly 70% of
farmers who had been quoted a price and given conditions of sale had
indicated acceptance. Despite the reservations which had been expressed
about pollution in Scotland the level of interest in accepting was about
the same.
''As I understand the new legislation the principle is that the
polluter pays,'' he said. ''In the circumstances we are talking about
the farmer would not be the polluter. ''British Coal will be in
existence for a further two years. After that any outstanding
liabilities will be passed to the Department of Trade and Industry -- it
would be the body to approach in future.''
British Coal's unwillingness to negotiate is seen by the farmers as a
breach of an assurance given by DTI Minister Richard Page that issues of
pollution and subsidence would be dealt with during the legal process
and that price adjustments could be made if the value of the land was
affected.

A SOUND trade for top-quality sheep but a lack of a middle market were
the features of the annual sale of North Country Cheviot rams at St
Boswells yesterday, writes DAN BUGLASS.
Topping the sale at #3600 was one from Sandy Dun, Shoestanes, Heriot,
which sold to George Milne, Kinaldy, St Andrews. Shoestanes also took
the group award and one of that trio went at #2000 to James Thomson,
Howdnam Grange, Kelso, with another making #1200 to Gwyn Davies,
Tregaron, Dyfed, Wales.
Second top price was #3200 for the best of the consignment from Tom
Pringle, Yorkston, Gorebridge, which went to Shoestanes. The Allanshaws
pen of Roderick Runciman sold to a peak of #3000 to Ritchie Strawhorn,
Broomhillbank, Lockerbie.
Overall the 152 North Country Cheviot rams averaged #497.30 -- up
#78.02. The auctioneer was John Swan &amp; Son.

WORLD champion Michael Schumacher does not envisage a lasting feud
with Damon Hill following their collision in Sunday's Italian Grand
Prix.
Schumacher, who had to be pulled away from Hill by track marshalls
after the English driver's Williams had run into the back of his
Benetton, said: ''When we're racing, we all know that mistakes can
happen. The most important thing is to admit those mistakes. When I next
see Damon it will not be a problem for me to say hello and shake
hands.''
Sunday's crash was the third serious collision between the two drivers
in less than a year. Hill was given a one-race ban, suspended for one
race, and Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone warned both drivers they
could kill each other through their on-track feud.
Meanwhile, Schumacher was appointed special envoy for education and
sports by UNESCO yesterday. ''I accept this appointment with great
honour and with a great sense of duty,'' said Schumacher during an
official ceremony at the Paris headquarters of the United Nations
Educational, Scientifical and Cultural Organisation.
''I look forward to promoting equal opportunities for children in
need. It has always been a target for me to help poor people and to give
them a chance. I'm earning more money that I can spend and I want to use
it to help people.'' Schumacher recently signed a lucrative deal to
drive for Ferrari.

SCOTTISH badminton has received a #40,000 boost from the Sports
Council to fuel their development and excellence programme.
However, the award comes in the wake of Allan Campbell's resignation
as director of coaching and development. As mastermind of the plan,
Campbell's post must be filled quickly if the sport in Scotland is to
retain the impetus it worked hard to earn.
Bruce Flockhart and Anne Gibson, currently close to Olympic selection,
will benefit from the extra funding. The pair now will be able to attend
the Danish and German Opens next month in their bid for world rankings
points, crucial in the race to reach Atlanta '96.
The funds also will be used to develop junior players. ''We have no
players to fill the space between our current internationalists and
those coming through,'' said Campbell. ''Aileen Travers and Jenny
Williamson have retired this year, and we need young players to take
their place.''
Campbell's solution has been a new Fast Track scheme for those players
likely to make the grade, with extra coaching and detailed fitness plans
paid for from the development of excellence fund.
The extra cash will be used to send a junior squad to the Gentofte
tournament and Danish Junior Cup also next month in a bid to launch
Scotland back into the junior scene after a dismal performance at the
European championships.

PRIDE, it is said, always comes before a fall. And it certainly
couldn't be more true for luxury housebuilder Adam Scotland -- although
in this case the fall is highly beneficial.
The pride comes from the recent success of site manager James Harkins
winning an NHBC award for his attention to quality at Henderland Gate,
the company's #6.5m development of prestigious flats and villas on a
commanding site in Bearsden.
Then, as Adam -- the only housebuilder in the Milngavie and Bearsden
area to figure in this year's Pride in the Job awards -- celebrated the
accolade, came the fall -- in interest rates, which should benefit the
housing market in general.
But the good news does not stop there -- for Adam had no sooner
released the second and final phase of luxury flats last week than five
had been sold.
''Since the end of the summer holidays and the schools going back we
have found interest has picked up tremendously,'' said managing director
David Nelson.
''Indeed, we have taken five reservations over a 10-day period, and
the cut in interest rates will add to the general feeling of optimism
that is slowly returning to the property market in Glasgow.''
Of course the success of any development ultimately rests on the
quality of the product -- in this case endorsed by the premier standard
setting and warranty organisation in the UK -- but there's another
reason to take a trip to the tranquil surroundings of Henderland Gate,
just off the Switchback in Bearden, with splendid views to the Erskine
Bridge and Clyde estuary.
For Adam offers a unique house exchange plan which discerning house
buyers are finding hard to refuse.
Billed as the brave new world of house-buying, the deal removes
clients' fears about being unable to sell their existing home and
guarantees they simply cannot lose. The only ''catch'' is the
customer's: a brand-new luxury home.
Under the exchange plan, after reserving one of the villas the
client's own home is valued by an independent valuer and a mutually
acceptable minimum part-exchange price is agreed with Adam.
Once missives for the purchase of the new home are concluded, the
seller's property will be marketed by a leading estate agent, with all
advertising costs and agent fees borne by Adam. Should the property be
sold for more than the agreed minimum value, the seller keeps all the
proceeds. Should it sell for less, or not at all, Adam will still pay
the agreed minimum price in part exchange for the new home.
''We've been delighted with the response. We are giving the client the
confidence to go ahead and put their house on the market because we are
picking up the estate agents' fee and advertising and providing a
minimum fall-back. It's a no-lose situation,'' said David Nelson.
''People are worried about spending weeks and weeks advertising with
the costs going up, worried about two mortgages. What we are doing is
underpinning that.''
The development comprises a range of two and three-bedroom flats (28
in all) and 15 four and five-bedroom detached homes. All are built to
the highest standards, offering exceptionally spacious accommodation and
a very high level of specification. The first phase of flats is now
occupied and people have started moving into the houses. It is
anticipated the development will be completed late next spring.
''The flats have been selling so quickly that we haven't had time to
have a showflat, but we do have a completed flat which people can look
round.''
The showhome, opened in March, is a five-bedroom Carnoustie detached
villa with interior design by Decorum of Sauchiehall Street. The rooms
are generally much larger than usual, and the double doors into the
lounge, the patio doors in the dining room, the generous hallways on
both ground and upper level, the large ensuites, and the extensive
landscaped gardens all serve to give a feeling of space. A choice of
stylish bathrooms and fully equipped quality kitchens -- designed to
maximise on space and storage -- is included in the price.
''Another reason for the continued popularity is the amount of space
in these flats and houses,'' said David Nelson. ''In the five-bedroom
house, for example, even the fifth bedroom can take a double bed, and
all the kitchens -- even those in the flats -- have been designed to
take a table for dining. All of the flats have balconies leading off
from the lounge, most with a view.''
Each flat is supplied with satellite television, and there is an
aerial point in every room. The villas have living flame fireplaces and
patios leading to the gardens, and the developers offer a carpets and
curtains package.
Henderland Gate is close to shopping and transport as well as being
within easy reach of the city centre. Prices are from #98,000 for a
two-bedroom flat and from #198,000 for the Braemar four-bedroom detached
villa.
''We think we have a winning package at Henderland Gate. The site has
been complimented by the public and visitors all summer, and the NHBC
award -- designed to foster quality in construction and reward
commitment to quality workmanship -- was a real bonus. Considering the
number of quality house builders in Milngavie and Bearsden, we are
delighted to be the only company in the area to figure in this year's
awards.
''With such an accolade, and our part-exchange scheme, we think we are
on to a winner.''

<HEADLINE>Producer prices fall in US</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976404627</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Washington, Tuesday -- Wholesale prices fell slightly in August, the
US Labour Department reported today, adding to the belief that inflation
pressures have largely been wrung out of the economy.
The Producer Price Index fell 0.1% last month, after being unchanged
in July. The August result was even better than Wall Street estimates of
an increase of 0.1%.
The department said that, with the volatile food and energy sector
factored out, the underlying ''core'' rate of wholesale inflation rose
0.1% after gaining 0.2% in the prior month.
The new data comes as the economy appears to be recovering from a
slump in the second quarter and consumers are taking advantage of low
long-term interest rates.
The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee meets later this month
to decide the course of short-term interest rates and many economists
believe it will decide to lower rates another notch.
''The figures look terrific,'' said Eugene Sherman, senior
vice-president and director of research at investment firm M A Schapiro
&amp; Co. ''It's a very positive number from the sense of inflation being
very calm and stable. At the producer level, we are close to price
stability and that's the Fed's goal.''
The department said the decline in August matched the June drop and
was the largest fall since a 0.4% drop in October of last year.
Energy prices, the department said, declined 0.9% as gasoline prices
fell 1.9%.
Food prices were unchanged, with veal and beef falling 3.4% and pork
rising 1.5%. Vegetable prices plummeted 12.7%, while fruit rose 6.3%.
* THE US trade deficit shot up to $43.62bn (#28.14bn) in the last
quarter, the worst performance in the country's history, the Commerce
Department reported today.
The soaring deficit presents a political problem for President Bill
Clinton, who has made economics a key priority of his foreign policy. It
was the worst showing on record, topping the previous worst figure of
$43.28bn set in the final three months of last year.
At the same time the department said the US current account deficit
climbed 11.8% in the April to June quarter from a first-quarter deficit
of $39.03bn (#25.18bn).

MORE than #10m was wiped off the value of Pittencrieff Resources'
shares yesterday, after the Edinburgh-based oil and gas company
announced interim pre-tax profits of only #227,000.
The shares plunged 18p to 72p, cutting its market capitalisation from
#51.8m to #41.4m.
The company said profits would have been about #1.5m greater but for
the weakness of gas prices.
Pittencrieff Resources also revealed that its interests in Corpus
Christi, Texas, purchased last year for about $38m, had so far not lived
up to expectations.
Taken together, the Corpus Christi fields constitute the largest chunk
of Pittencrieff Resources and the news of their poor showing could have
been the principal reason for the share price collapse. The City may
consider that the company paid too much for the assets.
Pittencrieff Resources is taking #151,000 from reserves to help
finance an interim dividend of 0.5p for the six months to end-June. It
justified this on the grounds of its operational cash inflow of #2.6m.
Since Pittencrieff Resources was formed from its predecessor company,
Pittencrieff, with the purchase last year of the Corpus Christi fields
and the simultaneous demerger of a US communications subsidiary on to
Wall Street, the board did not believe it possible to release any
meaningful comparative figures with yesterday's interims.
However, the poorness of the results is obvious when they are compared
with the #1.05m pre-tax profits it made in the seven months to
end-December.
Chairman Michael Munro admitted the results were disappointing but
declined to give a view on the stock market's reaction to them. He said:
''We would like to have seen better results. There are no two ways about
it.''
He added: ''Clearly Corpus Christi drilling is, to some extent, a
disappointment but it doesn't alter our commitment to develop the
reserves in a profitable way.''
Commercial production has been achieved but overall volume from deeper
zones has so far not lived up to the company's expectations.
An unusually mild winter in North America meant the average gas price
the company received was down one-third on that received by the
predecessor company in the first half of last year, at $1.35 per 1000
cubic feet. Gas accounts for 70% of Pittencrieff Resources' total sales
volume.
However, Mr Munro said the recent upward trend of gas prices, if
sustained, would come straight through to higher net profits.
Also on a more positive note, production at Fort Chadbourne in Texas,
should increase in the second half, as will that at the
Patricia/Dinosaur gas-field in Canada, assuming prices improve.
Prior to yesterday's results, brokers were forecasting full-year
profits of about #3m but they are likely to have slashed their
expectations.

Stewart Fraser goes by Largs to charter a boat
CHARTERING a boat is a relatively simple way of getting afloat,
without the oncost of buying new or secondhand. To check out the system,
see how good the boats are, and exactly what is involved, it is good
strategy to have a word with one of the many companies on the Clyde.
The first surprise -- albeit a pleasant one -- was just how carefully
all the safety aspects involved are covered. There was no -- ''Here's a
boat. Off you go.'' Individual and general points were all spelled out.
We had to be clear about the difference between the fire extinguishers
aboard, and why halon was used in the engine compartment. How to operate
the sea toilet in the heads, including dealing with the seacocks. We had
to operate a code of practice with the gas supply: on at the main
bottle, then at the cooker in the galley. And everything off when
finished. A spare bottle is in the stern locker: you have to know how to
change them over if necessary.
The workings of the Volvo Penta were explained in detail. Finding a
personal lifejacket and harness was an absolute: wearing them, a strong
suggestion. The importance of hooking on to the safety line along the
side deck in bad weather -- crawling on knees, if that felt the safe way
to go forward. So it went on: chartering bareboat, we would have to go
through the two pages of ship's inventory -- three anchors, VHF radio,
tattie masher and corkscrew included. With berths for eight, naturally
there were knives, forks and spoons for eight: count them.
So far, so good. Probably second nature to the experienced enthusiast.
But a worthwhile overall routine for beginners. What about the First
35S5 we were supposedly chartering?
The 28hp Volvo took us out quietly from Largs, manoeuvring in the
marina was no problem. With the new roller reefing system for the No2
genoa, and a standard main, we were sailing pretty quickly, lightly
heeled. Three reefing lines are fitted to the main, led aft to the
jammers. All lines to the cockpit is rapidly becoming standard practice
these days. It takes a good deal of strain out of family sailing.
The main sheet and track is on a triple purchase. In the lightish airs
prevailing, we ignored the reefing lines and moved the main windward,
for a better set. The genoa track seemed possibly more suited to the No1
sail, but we left things alone, content with our progress.
In a few moments, we were out with the stern trawlers, in the open sea
beyond the Cumbraes. Tacking was almost a one finger operation, and
comfortably within 90deg. Keeping crew to either side did not cause any
imbalance. Making a decent cup of coffee -- the standard practical test
of any sailboat -- was neither dangerous nor long delayed.
There was little temptation to try out the berths: eight aboard is
maximum, six is comfortable, and four at a time would be luxurious.
Standing headroom of 6ft suits most people, and the 11ft 9in beam
ensures good creature comfort below decks.
Removing the companionway steps gives access to the engine. There is
reasonable room to fiddle about, but nothing spectacular. In any case,
we had done the customary checks before setting out: that's another part
of the standing orders. Cruising at a steady five knots, discussing the
best approach to Millport, we were surprised to find ourselves almost
motionless just two minutes later. West coast weather can be fickle
indeed.
Catching a forecast on the VHF that spoke of ''gale to storm force
winds, imminent'' caused even more surprise.
It was reassuring to find it was Belfast putting out the warning. And
it was good to be in the quiet waters of the Clyde, many miles away from
the heavy weather. Chartering should be for pleasure, after all, not
creating a macho image.

CLYDE Petroleum yesterday announced a ten-fold increase in interim
pre-tax profits to #19.4m, having achieved a 22% increase in oil and gas
production, writes IAN McCONNELL.
The company's final results will be boosted further by #11m of gains
on the recent sale of 13.5% of the Gryphon North Sea oilfield, reducing
its stake from 35% to 21.5%.
Gearing plummeted from 92% at the year-end to 65% at end-June, and the
disposals of 10% of Gryphon to Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy and of 3.5%
to Dutch company Oranje-Nassau Energie Participatie will result in a
further substantial reduction.
The interim dividend was up 14% at 0.4p.
Chairman Malcolm Gourlay said yesterday that the company had the
resources to undertake a major ''corporate'' acquisition if the right
opportunity arose.
Such a chance might come up if a major player was to sell its entire
interests in a particular country, which would probably comprise a
mixture of production, development, discoveries and exploration.
Mr Gourlay said: ''We have the resources to do such a transaction if
the right one comes up. The disposals of Gryphon have transformed the
financial position of the group.''
Such a bid, which would probably be an agreed one, would be over and
above Clyde's plans to spend about #15m a year on the acquisition of
individual assets, such as stakes in fields or reserves.
Clyde has earmarked another #10m a year for exploration, which will
allow it to participate in between 10 and 15 wells a year.
Development costs associated with acquisitions and exploration may
take the total annual investment to #75m. However, this should be more
than covered by an anticipated annual cash inflow, after interest and
tax, of #85m.
Average daily production during the six months to end-June was up 22%
on the previous 12 months at 42,548 barrels of oil equivalent, with a
strong contribution from Clyde's Dutch operations.
In the Netherlands, where Clyde increased its presence with the $5.4m
(#3.5m) acquisition of part of Mobil's offshore interests, first-half
gas production increased from 52.6 million to 89 million cubic feet per
day.
In spite of yesterday's results, Clyde shares were cut 1p to 47[1/2]p,
in a generally weak sector.

Ross Finlay test drives the Micra SLX
WHILE the Nissan Micra is familiar enough, and was the winner of the
European Car of the Year award in 1993, it is not a model which is
offered all that often for testing. I had driven a one-litre, and a 1.3
fitted with the company's excellent N-CVT transmission, but it was only
recently that I found myself at the wheel of a manual transmission 1.3,
the top-performing model in what I think of as a rather appealing
supermini range.
The retro styling of the Micra gets mixed reviews, even -- as I
reported a while ago -- from members of the same family who have one in
the garage. It does not always ''click'' with the women drivers for whom
it was very largely designed. I have always quite liked it, not least
because the unusual height compared with length and width makes this
compact little car unexpectedly roomy and airy.
There is a remarkable spread of prices from bottom to top of the Micra
range. At the new September showroom price of #10,250, the 1.3 five-door
SLX is the most expensive car on the list. Like all Micras, this is a
car which impresses because of the unusual sophistication built into its
engine design. A twin-cam 16-valve layout is hardly the norm in the
realm of the mid-sized supermini.
With a capacity of 1275cc, the engine pushes out a healthy 75bhp and
offers quite meaty torque for its size. This Micra will sprint to 60mph
in about 12 seconds and go on to a test track speed just on the high
side of 105mph. Fuel consumption figures for the manual transmission
model range from 57mpg at 56mph and 42 at 75 to 42mpg in city traffic.
The extra-cost N-CVT transmission reduces the performance and slightly
increases the petrol usage, but, although the test car had the
five-speed manual box, the Micra is one of the very few cars in its
class where the use of automatic transmission seems like a pretty good
idea.
All that fancy engine design for a comparatively small-capacity unit
pays off in the Micra's throttle response and general manners on the
road. It manages to be very lively for its class, as well as smooth and
quiet even when being pressed quite hard. The Micra also benefits from
what always seem, on any visit to the Sunderland factory where it is
built, to be high standards of assembly and quality control.
Ride quality and handling ability are features not easy to provide to
the same extent on a fairly short-wheelbase design, but here again the
little Nissan scores well. The whole idea of this car in its design
stages was that it was to be a supermini for Europe. While there is no
doubt that the Japanese are in ultimate control, organisations like
Nissan's European Technology Centre at Cranfield had a substantial
input, and it was to the Micra's definite benefit.
The unusual roof height means that four adults can travel in the Micra
without any cramping, although there is hardly what you would call
lounging room in the back. Its interior is neatly laid out, with a cute
little instrument pod to add to what so many people see as the car's
toytown looks. I think, though, that the fashion in car interiors has
moved on, since the Micra first appeared, to the extent that the light
grey material with which the fascia and the sensible fascia tray are
covered ought to be upgraded.
Out on the road the Micra is light and precise to chuck around. While
I also like the N-CVT version, the test car's slick gear change added to
the fun.
Thanks to the considerable glass area, visibility all round is fine.
With the extra pull of the 1.3-litre engine, the Micra moves up more
than simply a price band. While retaining all the smoothness of the
smaller version, it has just that extra performance bite which attracts
the keener driver.

REACTION from hostile bidder Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (RPR) to
pharmaceutical group Fisons' first-half results was to describe them as
good, which makes something of a change from the exchanges so far.
At times, from RPR's criticisms it was difficult to see why it was
actually bidding #1700m for the company. But yesterday's remarks by RPR
chairman Robert Cawthorn that anything less than a good-looking set of
results would have been very disappointing -- particularly as they
benefited from a strong hay fever season in Japan and it is on the
receiving end of a bid -- could be the signal for a softening approach.
Fisons, after all, has insisted all along that the 240p-a-share bid
undervalues the company, not that it does not make strategic sense.
It has unveiled a 41% rise in profits before tax to #37.6m which tops
market estimates of around #35m. Pharmaceutical operating profits,
before exceptional items, increased by 31% to #47.6m on sales up 6%.
Shareholders are to receive an 18% increase in the interim dividend from
1.7p to 2p as a sweetener on underlying earnings per share up 55% from
2.2p to 3.4p.
At 259p, down 1p yesterday, the shares already stand substantially
above the bid price. The market is still anticipating either a higher
bid from RPR or some other deal by Fisons with another group, although
the prospect of a white knight appearing seems to be diminishing.
Fisons' chief executive, Stuart Wallis, said last week in the
company's defence document that no quick news on the collaboration front
can be expected although negotiations are continuing with a number of
people.
Monday was the first closing date for the RPR offer and predictably it
reported that acceptances totalled a lowly 0.24% of Fisons' equity, but
this is pretty well par for the course at this stage of a contested
takeover.
Naturally, Fisons was quick to seize upon this. RPR need be in no
hurry but unless Fisons really can pull something out of the hat, a
reasonable increase in the terms would seem to be on the cards.
Certainly there is absolutely no reason for shareholders to take any
action yet.
If RPR was to decide to pull out and the market was not impressed with
the company's alternative options, that would be a different matter and
some analysts are advising their clients to take profits.
But Fisons does seem to be putting up a robust defence at present,
though RPR would also have to take into account the long-term
implications of the company's strategy of concentrating on its core
pharmaceutical marketing operation and selling its other activities,
including its research and development arm which was sold in March
bringing in an exceptional gain of #84.8m in the first half.
The disposal of the group's scientific instruments and laboratory
supplies business should be completed by the year-end.
So far as the first half is concerned, Fisons did benefit from a
strong hay fever period, not just in Japan but also in the US and
Europe.Sales of its asthma treatment drug Intal advanced by 7% outside
the US but dropped by 28% to #28m in the US as, in its nebuliser form,
it was hit by cheap generic competition. RPR had suggested that sales
had dropped substantially in the US but while accepting this, Fisons, in
its defence document, said that the aerosol version of the drug was
unaffected.
Fisons stresses that its results have been achieved after a reduction
in research and development expenditure of less than #2m giving the lie
to RPR's assertion that the company's pharmaceutical franchise has
stalled.
The approximate gross proceeds of #400m from the divestments of the
scientific instruments business and the majority of the laboratory
supplies business will, says Fisons, leave it with the cash resources to
support further expansion.
The outlook looks assured this year and in 1996. It is 1997 and beyond
that RPR will be mulling over as it debates whether the bid should be
increased as the market seems to think appropriate.

<HEADLINE>Group withdraws from financial sector to concentrate resources on tea. James Finlay profits tumble</HEADLINE>

JAMES Finlay is selling off its banking division in order to
concentrate its resources on the tea industry, where it continues to
wrestle with low prices.
The announcement came as the Glasgow-based group announced a sharp
fall in pre-tax profits to #1.8m in the six months to June 30 from a
restated #6.9m in the same period last year.
Turnover fell to #79.5m from a restated #82.8m and the company halved
the interim dividend to 1p, prompting a 1p fall in the share price to
54p.
Chairman Richard Muir said James Finlay had already agreed management
buy-outs for two of its UK financial subsidiaries -- Gaelic Invoice
Factors and James Finlay Insurance Brokers.
The four remaining four subsidiaries of its James Finlay Bank
Holdings' umbrella group would be sold off by the end of this year, he
added.
The disposal of these businesses will get rid of #54m of debt and #53m
of guarantees and cut gearing from 73% to between 20% and 25%.
However, the effect on the profit-and-loss account should be broadly
neutral. ''It could be a small plus or a very small minus,'' Mr Muir
said.
Withdrawal from the financial sector will allow James Finlay to focus
on its core activities of tea growing, trading and processing. ''I think
it is best that we concentrate on what we are good at,'' he said.
However, it will not be plain sailing. James Finlay faces a sharp fall
in tea prices and see-saw currency fluctuations in Kenya where the
company grows two-thirds of its tea.
These factors led the company's plantations in Africa, Asia and
Australia to report an operating loss of #246,000 in the first six
months of this year, after a profit of #4.5m in the same period of 1992.
The strategic decision to pull out of banking and focus on tea will
lead to Richard Capper, the managing director of James Finlay Bank,
leaving the board later this year.
Bill Eyton, the brains behind James Finlay's instant and decaffeinated
tea business for the last 20 years, will replace him as an executive
director. His promotion follows the recent appointment of Pat Lockett, a
former senior partner with accountants Ernst &amp; Young, as finance
director.
The plunge in interim profits means that James Finlay's earnings for
the full-year are unlikely to be better than the #8.2m achieved in 1994.
Nevertheless, Mr Muir highlighted an upturn in the company's tea
trading, processing and packaging activities. He said tea trading in
Kenya should show a #500,000 profit for the full year after a loss of
#1m in 1994. The chairman also predicted that tea trading profits in
London, which were virtually wiped out by a #700,000 bad debt last year,
would also improve dramatically.
However, prices for Kenyan tea at the London auction have fallen to
less than 90p per kilo from 125p a year ago. ''That sort of change
represents a difference of about #7m in our profits,'' Mr Muir said.
James Finlay also remains at the mercy of roller-coaster movements in
the Kenyan shilling. The currency appreciated strongly in 1994, raising
James Finlay's operating costs in Kenya and eroding profit margins. But
it has fallen back sharply this year, inflicting #1.5m of foreign
exchange losses on the first-half profits.
''The results are a good deal worse than expected, but there are a lot
of one-offs in there,'' one analyst at a Scottish broker said.
Last year's first-half profits were restated #2m higher following a
change in James Finlay's method of valuing tea stocks. And the company
suffered a #1.4m exceptional loss in the first half of this year on its
sale of Adviser Inc, a fund-managing company based in Texas.
Given the uncertain outlook for tea prices, James Finlay has no plans
to embark on any major new investments. Mr Muir said the company would
concentrate on completing two major projects under way at present -- the
rehabilitation of abandoned tea estates in Uganda and the construction
of an instant tea factory in Sri Lanka.
He said the company would continue to operate the confectionery
business of its George Payne subsidiary for the time being, but this
might be sold off in due course.

Theatre
ENGLISH classical theatre is studded with the wit and wisdom of
Irishmen. Where would we be without Wilde, Goldsmith, Farquhar and
O'Keeffe. O'Keeffe, you say, now who would he be? In fact, we've taken a
long time to rediscover the 18th century O'Keeffe whose delightful
comedy, Wild Oats, revived by the RSC in 1976, provided Alan Howard with
an excuse for one of his most outrageously comic performances as the
itinerant, roving actor.
Jeremy Sams's National Theatre production has a very different feel to
it, but still confirms the play's status as an actor's paradise. A tale
of indigency and honour, mistaken identities and preposterous twists of
plot, Sams's Rover and spouter of bon (mostly Shakespearean) mots is the
small, perfectly formed Anton Lesser -- an actor of romantic delicacy
where Howard was all posture and emphasis.
You warm to Lesser rather than feel pole-axed by him.  But he carries
this production with a deftness and gentle sincerity perfectly in
keeping with the play's essential warm-heartedness and frivolous
invention.
A veritable hymn to theatre and it's humanising pleasures, around
Lesser, in William Dudley's witty pastoral setting, Sams has built a
crew of outstanding comic cameos: Benjamin Whitrow lugubriously funny as
a leching quaker; Sarah Woodward coolly ironic as the otherwise
thanklessly ''good'' Lady Amaranth; James Bolam in bucolically handsome
form as a naval captain all at sea on land and newcomer Mark Addy as a
simpleton, rural son with a heart of gold.
But, really, it's an all round happy affair and if you don't exactly
come out humming the tunes, banish the blues it certainly will.

As Glasgow prepares to host the ultimate musical series, Michael
Tumelty has an offer that no concert-goer can refuse
CALLING all music lovers. Stand by for the free-ticket offer of the
decade. Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall is about to celebrate its fifth
birthday at the beginning of October. Part of the anniversary
celebrations will be a gala week of glittering concerts featuring some
of the best musicians in the world, from the glorious St Petersburg
Philharmonic Orchestra to the supreme diva, Montserrat Caballe.
In association with the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, The Herald is
about to offer a unique opportunity to attend all of these concerts.
Free of charge.
Never, since the hall opened back in the heady days of 1990, Glasgow's
year as European City of Culture, has there been such a concentration of
world-class events. Six concerts in five days. It's a historic moment in
the culture of the city. This is your chance to witness it all from the
best seats in the house. At no charge.
Over three days next week, from Monday to Wednesday on the arts page,
The Herald will run a competition. There will be three prizes: three
pairs of top-price tickets for every event in the fifth birthday week of
the concert hall. Each pair of tickets is worth over #250. This is not
just a prize; for music lovers, this is the ultimate dream ticket.
Before telling you more about the competition, here is a taster of the
week in store for prizewinners. It opens thunderously on Monday, October
2, with the Wadaiko Ichira Drummers from Osaka. No mere drummers, this
troupe of 10 artists -- who have appeared at the Edinburgh Festival and
Sadler's Wells Theatre -- combine physical energy with visual spectacle
in a mind and eye-numbing display of percussive choreography.
Centrepiece of the week for many will be the two-day residency by the
great St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra. They've been here before,
they've just been at the Edinburgh Festival, but you've never had an
opportunity to hear them like this. In two evenings the orchestra will
give three concerts featuring the complete symphonies of Tchaikovsky, a
project the St Petersburg Phil has made its own.
They will be directed by their music director and principal conductor,
Yuri Temirkanov, here absolutely in his element with the music of his
native Russia. On the Tuesday, Temirkanov will open the cycle with
Tchaikovsky's First and Fourth Symphonies. The latter, one of the
composer's most turbulent and impassioned works, is an autobiographical
document.
On the Wednesday evening, Temirkanov and his orchestra undertake a
marathon. The remaining four Tchaikovsky symphonies will be given in two
concerts, one starting at 6.30 (numbers two and five), the other
starting at 9.00 (numbers three and six -- the final, heartrending
symphony, The Pathetique). These two nights alone represent the
opportunity of a lifetime: to hear the oldest and one of the greatest of
Russian orchestras -- and if you've never heard them, you will not
believe the sound of their massive string section. It will shake you to
your boots.
On the Thursday evening the actual fifth anniversary concert will be
staged: an opera gala featuring the Royal Scottish National Orchestra
conducted by Alexander Lazarev. Not only is Lazarev principal guest
conductor of the RSNO, he is artistic chief of the Bolshoi Opera in
Moscow. The opera gala will feature soloists from the Bolshoi in a
two-part programme of Russian and Italian operatic extracts.
And finally, at the climax of the week on Friday, soprano Montserrat
Caballe, the diva from Barcelona, will command centre stage in a recital
(details of which are still to be confirmed) concluding an intense and
unrivalled week of top-class events.
The timetable for your opportunity to win a pair of tickets for every
concert in the anniversary week is as follows. Answer the three easy
questions that will appear, one per day, on the Arts page from next
Monday to Wednesday. On the Wednesday, send the answers to me at The

WELL, here's a funny old period piece given a sharp post-modern gloss
by Neil Bartlett. What, you wonder, possessed one of the most subversive
stylists of his day to revive such a seemingly wooden, stuffed shirted
melodrama and treat it with such perfect decorum and respect.
Then you look again at the black rim framework surrounding the central
stage, the vibrant blue-green and day-glo slashed back wall and the way
Bartlett has directed the Chinese members of the cast as giggling
antagonists to the audience. Humble scene-shifters, they yet know
something we don't -- and you realise Bartlett has framed it within our
own times, looking back . . .
A useful vehicle for Joanna Lumley to show she has more in her
dramatic armoury than those required for Abfab and the disastrous Class
Act, you also begin to realise that W Somerset Maugham's 1927 thriller
about an English woman in Malaya who shot her lover isn't just about
passion versus good old solid decency; it is a quite perfectly preserved
example of English colonialism at its most subtle and repugnant.
Sure, some of the dialogue is intolerably arch (such lines don't work
unless you have the likes of Celia Johnson to give them heart) and
Lumley's brittleness is too one dimensional for pity.
But it's a telling portrait all the same with Tim Piggott-Smith, Neil
Stacy, Kate Seaward and Charles Edwards crisp reminders of what was so
odious about the system and Benedict Wong's ingratiatingly polite junior
legal clerk running rings round the colonisers, a deadly accurate
portent of things to come.

* MEANWHILE, if further evidence was needed to illustrate the dire
straits in which the British construction industry finds itself, a
string of half-year results from construction and building products
companies in recent weeks has provided ample proof with little sign of
an upturn on the horizon.
Government figures last week showed that construction output fell for
the second consecutive quarter in the three months to the end of June,
reflecting the weak housing market and subdued industrial investment.
And figures yesterday from the Department of Environment showed that
new orders in the three months to the end of July were 10% lower than in
the previous three months and 10% below the corresponding period last
year, some improvement over the three months to June but still a
depressing picture. Moreover, private industrial orders are 23% lower
than in the first quarter.
The hard-pressed private housing sector is 11% lower in the second
quarter over the first and 21% down on the same quarter a year ago.
There seems little prospect of the housing scene improving at present,
which does not bode well for construction and building materials, most
of whom have warned about second-half prospects in the UK.
If the Chancellor was to take action in the Budget to help the housing
market as some members of the industry, including one or two mortgage
lenders, have called for, this could provide some respite. But as yet
there are no clear signs the Government is thinking along these lines.

Music
FIRST things first. For those who couldn't wait last night through the
deliberations of the jury at the end of the first round of the Scottish
International Piano Competition, here -- as they say -- are the results.
Of the original 34 pianists, 12 now go ahead to the semi-finals on
Thursday and Friday.
It is an international line-up: three pianists from Britain, two from
Italy, and one each from Lithuania, China, Russia, Poland, Sweden,
Venezuela, and the United States. They are: Bartolomiej Kominek, Ruslan
Sviridov, Lori Kaufman, Charles Owen, Roger Owens, William Fong, Maria
Rostotsky, Giampaolo Stuani, Vanessa Perez, Nicola Ventrella, Polina
Chersonskaya, and Christopher Zhong.
Impressions? Having been in London through the early rounds, I haven't
heard them all play. Of those I did hear, there are a few distinctive
features. Standards are mixed: the Mozart playing I heard generally
suggested one thing -- most of them can't play Mozart. (Their
personalities and determination to get their own interpretation firmly
across tend to get in the way of what Mozart both wrote and meant.) The
jury has obviously allowed for idiosyncrasy: the Chinese pianist
Christopher Zhong is a heavy breather and a singer. Another jury might
have flayed him for it. This group didn't let his mannerisms stand in
the way of his stylish pianism. Venezuelan Vanessa Peres overcooked
Liszt, but it didn't mask her musicianship.
Some of the playing was superb. Italian Nicola Ventrella is an
extremely refined player, while Polina Chersonskaya -- studying in
Scotland and a popular choice -- played Prokofiev with maturity and
intelligence, as well as fire. Daily coverage of the semis follows at
the end of the week.

GOVERNOR of the Bank of England Eddie George yesterday told mortgage
lenders that homebuyers could no longer expect prices to increase as
they had done in the past.
Addressing the International Union of Housing Finance Institutions'
World Congress in London on the housing market and the financial
services revolution, he said the demand for housing as a financial asset
-- as a hedge against inflation -- should decline, so that overall real
house prices may tend to rise more slowly over time.
Mr George said that if we succeed in moderating the economic cycle,
real house prices should also become more stable. ''Greater economic and
price stability should also make for less financial uncertainty -- and
for that reason to lower overall real interest rates as the uncertainty
premium is reduced.''
It may also, he added, affect the form of mortgage finance with more
emphasis on fixed interest rather than variable rates, for example. And
he suggested that such trends too may help improve the capacity of
borrowers to service their loans.
Replying to a press question later Mr George said that Monday's
Producer Prices data -- factory input and output prices -- for August
did seem to indicate a ''substantial tailing off'' of factory price
pressures, strengthening the belief that he had moderated his call for a
further interest hike at his monetary meetings with Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke.
In his speech to the congress, the Governor said there should be less
erratic demand for houses. In the past buyers have been sucked into the
market by the prospect of rising prices during the boom phase, only to
find they had difficulty servicing their debt when interest rates had to
be pushed sharply upwards to bring the economy back under control.
Even so, because demand tends to be particularly sensitive to
expectations, and because the supply of housing is likely to remain
inelastic, at least in the short term, real house prices may still be
more variable than other prices. ''And in an environment of general
price stability, that could mean that falls in nominal house prices
become somewhat more common than they have been in the past,'' he said.
Mr George told the congress that moving to a more stable,
low-inflation environment can involve problems of transition -- which as
we are still seeing in this country -- and these can be acutely painful
for both mortgage borrowers and lenders.
''But it clearly also raises longer term questions for you about the
nature of your business,'' he said. ''Whether or to what extent is
appropriate to concentrate asset portfolios on housing for example,
questions about appropriate loan-to-value ratios or earnings multiples
and questions about the appropriate forms of housing finance.''

Theatre
MICHAEL F Ackerman's play is a piece of new writing, transferred to
Glasgow after a deservedly positive reception in Edinburgh, which
succeeds in bringing new perspectives to the much-explored subject of
the Holocaust.
In the year which marks the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation of
the Nazi concentration camps, compassion-fatigue for the plight of the
millions of Jews murdered and tortured in Nazi Germany is a very real,
if highly regrettable, possibility.
Ackerman's thoughtfully structured and incisive writing completely
avoids such traps.
The central character of David Goldberg, whose imprisonment in West
Berlin in 1961, pending his trial for the murder of Erich Mauler, a
former SS Officer, forms the core of the piece, is forcefully and
engagingly portrayed by Donald Munro in all his hard-edged wise-cracking
Jewish humour.
The current of smart-arse one-liners and almost cliched Jewish comedy
which runs through the play seems at first to be treating the issue of
Nazi atrocities as a black, warped joke, logic devoid of humanity. But,
as the plot unfolds, revealing Goldberg's deeper, more personal motives
through a series of flashbacks; accounts and testimonies of Mauler and
his fellow Nazis's chilling cruelty are juxtaposed with the Jewish
comedian routine to powerful and moving effect.
Factional Theatre, under the direction of Andrew Lorretto, give the
piece a simple and direct staging; with an evocative use of the Arches
Theatre's bare brick walls, fluid movement between scenes and
timescales, and strong performances throughout.
A production which proves that good writing and focused direction beat
needless innovation any day.

CLAREMONT Garments, which employs around 800 people at its Glasgow
factory, reported a 31% increase in pre-tax profits to #6.8m in the
first six months of the year, writes NICOLA REEVES.
Sales grew by 24% to #78m but were up 12.6% on a like-for-like basis.
Claremont experienced strong sales growth in most areas of the
business although it had particular success in dresses and bras. The
company is a major supplier to Marks &amp; Spencer which has 14% of the UK
clothing market. Claremont raised its interim dividend by 10% to 4.4p.
Peter Wiegand, its chairman and chief executive, said the first half
of 1995 had seen strong organic growth within the group and considerable
progress in further integrating Magellan and Bellrise. Bellrise was said
to have made a larger than expected profit contribution helped by
investment in improved planning and production systems.
A broader product range in areas such as menswear and childrenswear,
improvements to customer service and production efficiency coupled with
its strong partnership with M&amp;S give the company confidence for the
future.
Although it remains committed to UK production, in line with other
manufacturing companies, it has had to look overseas where labour costs
in particular are lower.
In addition to established relationships with Morocco and China, it
has for the first time sourced tailored garments from Lithuania and
Slovakia. Mr Wiegand said these areas of involvement were very important
for the long-term development of the group's production capacity.
The City views Claremont as one of the winners in the depleted textile
sector. It is expected to perform better than its peers over the next 18
months.
Increasingly, textile companies that out-perform will be those that
generate above average sales growth, primarily through product
innovation or marketing, and consequently reduce their unit costs.
Claremont, along with Dewhirst another M&amp;S supplier, is leading the way
in this respect.
* COATS Viyella has agreed to pay #3.7m to acquire Atkins in a
recommended offer. It is offering 110p in cash for each Atkins share.
The latter is a significant manufacturer of ladies' hosiery products in
the UK and will fit strategically into Coats Viyella's existing hosiery
business.
Welcoming the takeover, Andrew Freeman, chief executive of Atkins,
said that on its own his company was potentially vulnerable.

OF the many recent theatrical adaptations, Michael Boyd'sdramatisation
of Janice Galloway's award-winning novel is by far the most striking and
innovative, faithful not only to atmosphere and characterisation but
also to stylisation -- invoking Galloway's typographical games with
phrases projected on to gauzy screens -- yet also creating a robust
theatrical language. Arresting images are created and dissolve,
characters appear among the audience -- an imaginative use of space
which makes this intensely personal story seem at once both epic and
intimate.
Boyd directs, reproducing the stream-of-consciousness narration by
having three actresses play the central character Joy Stone, a woman
who, following her lover's death by drowning, is adrift on a sea of
grief, battling with interfering do-gooders as well as her own
depression and doubt. It's a device which could have been troublesome
but here is pulled off with such confidence and aplomb, in both
direction and performances, that at times I was so sucked into Joy's
story I became unaware which actress had just spoken, so completely did
they elide.
They're distinct roles for all that; Jennifer Black playing the Joy
who deals with the world with a very humane mix of irony and bleakness,
Siobhan Redmond fiercely caustic as her constantly questioning inner
consciousness, and Neve McIntosh gently optimistic as a lyrical memory,
her beautiful voice occasionally lifting in dreamy song.
Other performances are similarly high-calibre; Peter Mullan is
outstanding as Joy's terrifying sister Myra, Forbes Masson makes a
coolly uninvolved psychiatrist, Eileen McCallum turns in a series of
assured cameos, while the rest of the 17-strong company offer
magnificent support.

BID speculation surrounding Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television (YTT)
mounted yesterday in the wake of the publication of the company's
interim results which showed a welcome recovery in advertising revenue
and programme sales and an encouraging start to the important autumn
quarter.
Advertising revenue grew by 12% to #81.8m.
YTT continues to supply some of the ITV network's most popular
programmes, including Emmerdale, Heartbeat and A Touch of Frost. It is
looking to increase the production of family, made-for-television films,
for which it believes there is strong demand on both sides of the
Atlantic.
Profit before tax in the six months to June 30 was #7.4m, which
compares very well with the #300,000 made in the corresponding period
last year. In 1994, the company's performance was depressed by costs
relating to the overselling of airtime.
The strong improvement in the results coupled with the board's
optimism for the future led to the interim dividend being raised from
0.1p to 3.7p on the back of growth in earnings per share up from 0.4p to
9.4p. The results benefited from lower staff and operating costs.
There is a lot of external activity swirling around the television
industry as a whole and recently the Government's Heritage Department
published its initial thoughts on-cross media ownership.
The City hopes that media ownership rules will be relaxed thereby
paving the way for either of YTT's major shareholders, Gerry Robinson's
Granada or Lord Hollick's MAI, to make a bid. Granada and MAI already
own two television franchises and are currently unable to expand on
this.
However, there have been calls for market domination to be based on
total share of the television advertising market. YTT already has close
business links with Granada. The pair have merged their overseas
programme sales operations with effect from this autumn.
Ward Thomas, chairman and chief executive of YTT, said he regarded the
merger as a logical step towards integrating peripheral aspects of ITV.
He added that YTT was as concerned with the bottom line as it was with
collecting awards for its programmes.
This means that after careful consideration YTT has decided not to
proceed as part of consortium for Channel 5. It believes that over the
first five years of its life the new channel would need more money than
it is willing to devote. But it is considering how best to respond to
the Government's proposals for digital terrestrial broadcasting
announced last month. However, it is expected to be several years before
digital television becomes a major force in broadcasting.
Former TV-AM chief Bruce Gyngell, who was appointed group managing
director of YTT in May, is to become its chief executive next year. Mr
Thomas will remain as chairman.
Yesterday, YTT shares were 3p off at 610p.

WE reached a turning-point in American politics on Monday night, or at
least a milestone in the 1996 presidential race. General Colin Powell
actually said something.
He has written a long book (advance: $6m) and made innumerable
speeches this year without once dropping out of the mode of soporific
bromide. He dodged every question, evaded every opportunity to state a
policy, a choice, or even an opinion, on any matter of public concern.
It was all quite brilliant.
His star rose high in the firmament as Bill Clinton, Bob Dole, and the
rest battled in the mud, splattered with all the promises, proposals,
and policies they have advocated over the years. Colin Powell was a
blank slate upon which his admirers could draw any image they wanted --
and the numbers of his admirers grew relentlessly.
Then on Monday we saw him on television, actually expressing opinions.
He has given a series of interviews to Barbara Walters, and ABC News
broadcast a few snippits to excite us.
The general, it turns out, is pro-choice: he concedes women's right to
have abortions. He supports gun control: he owns various guns, and sees
no objection to being subjected to the minor inconvenience of having to
register them. He supports affirmative action, meaning favouring blacks
and other minorities. He doesn't want prayer in schools. There is a
little vagueness on this point, but he was quite firm that he opposed
bringing schoolchildren together in their schools and making them say
their prayers.
All this is heresy and anathema to the ''Christian'' conservative wing
of the Republican Party. They take these social issues very seriously.
Indeed, they are much more passionate to ban abortion than anything
else. As for the real right-wing zealots, their touchstone is gun
control: they will oppose anyone who admits that any limit at all should
be set to their right to own a complete arsenal. The general has taken
the decision to set himself apart from the ultra-right. He is a
moderate, and all the rules of the game have changed.
True, he left a last doubt over his party affiliation, hinting to Ms
Walters that he might still go Democratic, and challenge Bill Clinton,
but he was obviously much more inclined to the position of moderate
Republican. Now either his sudden access of candour is a terrible
mistake or a sign of political genius. We will see.
His model, obviously, is Dwight D Eisenhower, who played coy for
several years before at last allowing the Republican Party to draft him
in 1952.
There are differences. General Powell is not quite the man Ike was.
With all respect to Operation Desert Storm, it didn't match D-Day.
If he's going to offer himself in the primaries it has to be as a
quasi-independent. The party faithful will vote for Dole, Gramm, or
Buchanan -- but perhaps the general's popularity is so great that the
large mass of Republicans who don't usually vote will turn out for him.
The same day that the general came out of the closet, another
candidate, the governor of California, Pete Wilson, abandoned all hope
of winning the Iowa caucuses, the first vote of the primary season next
February. Only dedicated party enthusiasts attend those gatherings, and
it seemed clear that the Christian right would dominate the process --
and Mr Wilson, a moderate despite his efforts to seem extremist, stood
no chance at all. They would probably reject General Powell, too, but he
would do better in New Hampshire, the first true primary, where anyone
registered as a Republican can vote.
Americans have often showed a partiality for general- presidents,
though most of them did not shine in office. They are now so exasperated
with the political system and the leaders it produces that they are
clearly ready for something else.
The general would be a very formidable candidate. If he could handle
the strains of a campaign and win the nomination, he would be the clear
favourite to beat Mr Clinton. It is very tempting indeed.
He hasn't yet decided, or admitted to have decided, but he agrees that
he is tempted. In fact, everything he is doing suggests that he will
announce his candidacy, probably in November, and has already settled on
his strategy.
The Republican Party has slid far to the right -- and may choose an
unequivocal moderate to lead it. America, which is still grappling with
its racism, may choose a black president. Now that would be a proper
turn-up for the book.

MEMORY Corporation has begun production of its hi-tech device that
corrects errors in defective computer chips, making them even more
reliable than factory approved originals, writes ROBERT POWELL.
The Dalkieth-based company said technical problems holding up
production had been overcome and the first commercial deliveries were
made in August.
''We expect to commence trading profitably on a monthly basis in the
fourth quarter of this year,'' said chief executive Cameron McColl.
The announcement came as Memory reported results for the first half of
this year and announced that its shares would start trading on the
unlisted securities market on September 18.
Until now they have only changed hands occasionally on the unlisted
securities market.
Memory buys defective chips known as partial DRAMs in Colorado and
ships them to Berlin where a German sub-contractor mounts groups of them
on boards, together with a device for correcting their defects.
These boards, called Single In-line Memory Modules (SIMMs), are then
sent to Dalkieth for testing before being delivered to computer
manufacturers.
Chairman Alex Deas said his company would build up production slowly
to avoid any hiccups, but the sales potential of its invention was huge.
''We believe it is going to make a massive impact on the industry
which is worth $33bn this year,'' Mr Deas said.
Shortly before Memory raised #3.15m through a stock market flotation
in December, it signed a contract worth $84m over three years to deliver
SIMMs to a major semi-conductor company.
Mr Deas said he expected to sign more important commercial agreements
shortly. Memory Corporation, which was founded two years ago, should
therefore have have no difficulty in turning its first-half loss of
#744,000 into a fat profit.

HEAVENS to Betsy, what's a girl to do? You spend your life acquiring,
developing, and perfecting a social skill only to have to surrender it
in the face of advancing years.
Apparently, there's stuff deemed unsuitable for a woman who is 20 and
quite a lot of somethings. It's time to put away childish things; there
might be kitsch cred to be had from collecting Barbie dolls but you're
supposed to have outgrown certain kiddy behaviour, like making perfume
out of rose petals or quarrelling over who gets the plastic toy in the
cereal box. And the sulking has to stop.
I'm happy to buy Chanel No 5 and surrender the geegaw but I'm having
trouble with the last no-no. Sure, sulking in the face of adversity
might be a singularly immature response but the trouble is I'm so damn
good at it I'd hate to give it up. I could sulk for Scotland. I can't
think of any other combative sport in which I so excel; when it comes to
volleyball, netball, or basketball my digits are made of Lurpak but my
sulks are steely.
It's all down to years of dedicated practice. As a toddler I perfected
the petulant pout, drawing when necessary on the trembling-lip ploy. No
other little girl could hold a candle to my tantrums and I'm surprised I
was able to sniff my way through adolescence, so often did I cut off my
nose to spite my face. Always with a sense of style of course; I made
quite an art out of the slamming of the door, transforming it into a
choreographic treat. Certainly it was one which often earned a,
admittedly sarcastic, round of applause.
At university I did a nice line in huffy stand-offs and in my early
twenties I excelled at the strop. I wouldn't say I'm touchy but I would
confess to a certain empathy with Oscar Wilde's dictum that, ''I can
take any amount of criticism, so long as it is unqualified praise''. Who
could argue with such a clever chap?
I now pride myself on having moved on to a more sophisticated sulk, a
simple but effective if-looks-could-kill withering glance. At least
that's what I like to think: I see myself as a smouldering femme fatale,
shooting deadly daggers at mine enemies. Strangely, they're usually too
busy sniggering at the spectacle of a grown woman acting like a brat to
feel the stabs.
The Sulk is usually triggered by an apparently innocuous remark from
someone, anything from ''yeah, you look okay'' (immediately interpreted
as ''you look a right state''), ''sorry, I forgot we planned to do
that'' (ie, ''I totally take you for granted''), to ''oh, look it's time
for that documentary I wanted to watch'' (a clear sub-text of ''I know
you always watch Brookside at this time but I am deliberately trying to
wind you up because I'm an evil, manipulating monster who doesn't give a
monkey's what you want'').
In the initial stage The Sulk is simply a state of mind and, if
performed by an accomplished practitioner, should even be difficult to
detect, with the sulkee possibly pursing only her lips.
The first action is merely to sit still and radiate bad vibes around
the room. If the target of The Sulk is too thick-skinned to notice and,
as they have been insensitive enough to insult you in the first place,
it's odds-on that they are, further measures will be necessary.
The sulkee should stare straight ahead, with a fixed but unseeing
glare, and answer any questions as curtly but over-courteously as
possible, preferably in the negative -- ie, ''fancy a coffee?'' ''No
thank you.'' Muscles should gradually tense up, lips should tighten,
eyes slide into snake-like slits and eyebrows glower as ferociously as
plucked lines can. As a last resort the baleful silence created can be
punctuated by heavy sighs.
The object is to paralyse the target with guilt and, however long it
takes, draw out the sought-after inquiry; ''Is something bothering
you?'' At which point you savour your triumph with the response ''no,
nothing'' in the kind of strangulated, martyred tone which indicates
anything but.
The follow-up query, ''Are you sure?'' should always be parried with
the transparent untruth ''yes, I'm fine''. If successful the target of
The Sulk will then have to be really, really nice to you to get back
into your good books.
This is all fine and dandy until everyone around suddenly grows up,
deciding it's time to become mature and responsible, treating your
beautifully crafted sulks with patronising contempt and coming over all
bloody Bob Hoskins, banging on about the need to talk about things
rather than going in big huffs.
Parents might amusedly pander to their children's sulks and teenage
boyfriends will put up with any kind of mood, convinced that if they can
only coax you out of it then sex will be their reward, but my age group
simply manifests impatience, refusing even to acknowledge The Sulk.
Men, of course, believe that it is a girlie thing. During a straw poll
of mixed-sex mates -- four straws and a jug of margaritas -- the menfolk
insisted that they would never stoop to such a thing. ''I don't sulk, I
get even,'' one said.
Stuff and nonsense. Men are just as likely to take recourse to sulking
but they have a different self-perception; they see a sulking woman as a
Violet Elizabeth ''I'll scweam and scweam until I make myself sick''
clone and see their huffy selves as mean, moody, and magnificent. Ha,
'scuse me while I sew up my splitting sides. I might be deluded enough
to think that sulking is any kind of answer but at least I'm honest
enough to admit guilty as charged.

SCOTTISHPOWER has launched a pre-emptive strike to undermine the
impact of Manweb's final defence document, aimed at resisting a hostile
#1000m bid by the Glasgow-based power company, writes ROBERT POWELL.
The Manweb defence document, detailing a package of financial benefits
for loyal shareholders, is expected later this week.
But ScottishPower said yesterday that any Manweb profit forecast for
the current financial year to March 30, 1996, would be a poor indicator
of long-term performance.
It said the Chester-based utility would be hit by additional price
controls during the next four years, which would reduce its distribution
revenues by about #50m in 1996-97.
ScottishPower also warned that Manweb would have to borrow heavily to
deliver a package of cash benefits to loyal shareholders and this would
increase its risk.
''A financial engineering package by Manweb would leave it, on its
own, a highly-geared, low-growth company with even less potential,''
said ScottishPower chairman Murray Stuart.
''ScottishPower has the strength to invest further in building its
businesses and, as the lowest cost distributor of electricity in the UK,
we are confident we can improve Manweb's business for the benefit of
shareholders and customers,'' he said.

THE aftermath of Braveheart, the absolutely true story of the great
hero whose story is mostly untrue, grows stranger still. What with the
SNP continuing its long fight against cultural stereotyping and the
distortion of Scotland's history by clasping to its bosom a picture that
is, historically speaking, cobblers, cobber, and Shadow Scottish
Secretary George Robertson all but declaring that Wallace would have
favoured the additional member system, in steps Michael Forsyth.
True, it probably makes a change from playing Lady Macbeth's valet,
but what are we to make of the fact that he has tossed an extra #100,000
to the Scottish Tourist Board to spend exploiting tourists keen on the
flick? Tired of hanging, drawing, and quartering opponents before
impaling them on poll taxes, the Secretary of State now presents
himself, in Wallace-speak, as the Guardian of Scotland.
Is it really left to the Diary to recall that Stirling and environs
are now being styled, with no regard whatever for historical accuracy,
as ''Braveheart Country'', and that, further, the MP for Stirling, with
a tiny majority, nasty new constituency boundaries, and no vested
interest whatever in anyone's pork barrel, is one Michael ''Blueheart''
Forsyth? Still, all is not lost.
If someone could just persuade Mel Gibson to star in Assembly!, the
tale (we have several scripts in turnaround) of a small nation's heroic
battle to throw off the colonialist yoke and regain control of its own
theme park, we might be getting somewhere.
Talk of the town
THE price of fame was ever high. Edinburgh's Evening News this week
confronted actress Una MacLean with one of those questionnaires designed
to uncover your innermost thoughts, delve into your deepest feelings
and, as she notes astutely, ''sell a few papers''.
Q: ''What do you remember about your first love?'' A: ''He was a guy
called Charles Frederick Rough and he owned the Drumclog Inn, just
outside Strathaven. I was just 17 and he was in his late 20s. I fell
madly in love with him.''
Q: ''If you met that person while with your partner, would you
introduce them?'' A: ''It would be difficult -- because he died years
ago''.
Elsewhere, Miss MacLean gives a dusty and negative response to the
impertinent inquiry, ''Have you ever tried an illegal substance?'' The
News, contrariwise, would seem to have been inhaling furiously.
The price is wrong
SOMEWHAT late in the day -- say 50 years -- the bankers of adorable
Switzerland have stumbled over some small change -- well, $34m actually
-- thought to be from secret accounts of Jews killed in the Holocaust.
Conveniently, this lucky discovery has taken place just after
Switzerland's long-awaited apology for the lethal neutrality that saw it
through the war and saw many fleeing Jews turned back at its borders to
face Nazi justice. Jewish groups, needless to say, have been campaigning
for the recovery of the cash for some time.
As a general rule, Swiss banks charge between $85 and $850 to anyone
who wants to check the books in search of old accounts. Entering
wholeheartedly into the spirit of reconciliation that has swept Europe
this summer, and maintaining the reputation that has made them popular
across the continent, they have therefore refused all Jewish requests
that fees be waived.
Perhaps ''bankers'' isn't quite the right word.
Width of opinion
THE generosity of the Scottish Republican Socialist Party knows few
bounds.
Another post arrives and with it another T-shirt, this time a stylish
garment bearing the face of the great John Maclean that we will, take
our word for it, wear with pride.
Last time out we mentioned how patriotism's outfitters had failed to
come up with a garment labelled ''Made in Scotland''. We did note,
however, that even given the self-evident fact that the Diary's
mid-section is now an expanding autonomous republic all of its own, the
shirt fitted no bother.
Still no mention of ''Made in Scotland'' on the new duds but in its
place, hand-lettered, is the mysterious legend ''XL''. Can anyone tell
us what this means, politically speaking?
Voice of the people
THE transformation of the grim old USSR into a collection of modern,
thriving nations never ceases to amaze. After decades of repression and
bad suits, the thirst for freedom remains strong -- though not without
the odd local difficulty.
Thus we hear parliamentarians in the Ukraine's heavily pro-Russian
Crimean peninsula have ordered that the American soap opera Santa
Barbara be broadcast with Russian rather than Ukrainian dubbing after
500 Crimean communists demonstrated last week in Simferopol, the
region's main city.
''Workers of the world, unite,'' they said, or words to that effect,
''you have nothing to lose but bad Ukrainian voice-overs!'' Some of you
might be wondering why the party of world revolution is getting its
dialectics in a twist over shaky scenery and plots which would shame The
Beechgrove Garden.
As it turns out, life in the former Soviet Union is so entirely
thrilling Santa Barbara has become ''a highlight of the day'' for
millions. Even by promising still more episodes each week, Ukrainian
state TV failed to placate the Crimea's ethnic Russian majority.
Imagine, just for a moment, the effect of Take The High Road.
Judge for yourself
A CONTRIBUTOR to the letters page of the Berwickshire News is agitated
over Tweed bailiffs, salmon poaching, and class war. He writes: ''If
being a poacher makes me a criminal then that I must accept. But I am
not a housebreaker. I would not like my house, car shed, or boat broken
into, therefore I would not do these things to others. As for
sympathetic judges, I have never found one in the past 25 years''.
The gentleman in question then offers his full name and address,
enabling any bailiff or judge to be just as entirely sympathetic as he
wishes.

IT is a romantic fallacy that culture somehow makes you good. In fact
the greatest figures of culture are often amoral, if not immoral,
because they are necessarily concerned with the perfection of their art,
not with what others may think of them.
It is no trouble to compile a list of people who have combined high
cultural achievement with nasty personalities, from Jean-Jacques
Rousseau through Richard Wagner to Vladimir Nabokov and Isaac Bashevis
Singer. Salman Rushdie makes a worthy addition to the list.
To say this in no way reflects on his writing. I do not find it quite
as marvellous as his train of sycophants say it is. Midnight's Children
was a beautiful novel, though its successors have fallen some way short
of it. I have bought his latest one, The Moor's Last Sigh, and perhaps I
shall like it better, but I approach it with no special preconceptions.
What irks me is the self-centred complacency of the man in a martyr's
role which he unwittingly created for himself but which, it seems to me,
he has come to enjoy. It must be great to throw out a casual aside, as
he did on his visit to Edinburgh this week, that of course the European
Union has taken up his case and conducted negotiations -- not just any
old negotiations, but secret negotiations -- with the Iranians in
Madrid.
And has the European Union done enough for him? No, it certainly has
not. The sage counsel for Rushdie's camp was that it should impose
penalties on Iran. What sort of penalties could sway the ayatollahs, I
ask myself? Could it be that the literary set in London will go the
length of boycotting Caspian caviare? But such matters of high policy
were not to be vouchsafed to the sweaty multitude. ''It would be
premature to talk about them at present,'' Rushdie airily declared.
I smell something here: the odour of sanctity. In our post-modern
world, theistic religion has largely been replaced by secural religion
-- Europe, the nation, ecology, or just plain worship of the self. But
most selves are not especially worshipful, and the trouble with the more
abstract objects of reverence is that they lack the vital element of
personification that sustained theistic religion.
You can talk, or think you are talking, to the Blessed Virgin Mary or
Lord Shiva. Jacques Delors was scarcely a substitute in his day, and in
any case he certainly would not have listened.
So you get something like the situation in the Middle Ages when, what
with plagues, murrains, wolves, rats, fleas, floods, famines, and what
not, God must often have seemed very far away. You get local cults of
saints. Rushdie is a modern equivalent. Like many of those saints, he is
wronged and suffering, yet shows a noble fortitude. It is right and
proper to venerate him.
If most red-blooded Britons could not care less about an avant-garde
novelist, that is little to the point, may indeed confirm his band of
hangers-on in their devotion.
It gives them a mission, a task of enlightenment. Since many of them
sit at the heart of the metropolitan communications industry, Rushdie
has it made. He becomes not just a personal cult, but an industry all in
himself. That was in fact how the successful medieval cults turned out,
and kept themselves nicely ticking over with regular miracles
(appearances at the Traverse) and with indulgences (admission tickets)
plentifully sold.
With hindsight we can see that the faithful were gulled. I suspect
that a future generation will reach much the same conclusion about
Rushdie's martyrdom, if it is remembered at all. A more unsaintly
personage it would be hard to imagine, at least to judge by my own
single encounter with him, when he came to give a talk in Edinburgh long
before the publication of The Satanic Verses, with no air of injured
innocence, therefore, to perfume his noisome sentiments.
He was sour, curmudgeonly, arrogant, and especially intent on bringing
home to a polite bourgeois audience what racialist rat-bags they were,
whether or not they liked or were prepared to admit it. You are guilty,
he was saying in effect, while I by the same token am innocent and,
looking each in the eye, holier than thou.
It is interesting to observe that, while the object of his obscure
resentments has perforce changed today, the structure of his thinking
has not.
The performance was the more bizarre because Rushdie must have come
from a background at least as privileged, to say the least, as any of
ours. Not many lads from Bombay find their way to Rugby and Cambridge;
come to that, not many lads from Edinburgh do. Papa no doubt had pots of
money but, as is often the case, used it to buy his son an education he
would hate.
Everyone I have ever met from Rugby School has been perfectly
horrible, so I am ready to believe young Salman had a rough time there,
the memory of which even the more civilised Cambridge could not efface.
The irony was that the liberalism of the British society which he came
to detest was not an imperialist sham, but absolutely genuine.
He stayed on to work and write and publish what he wanted, perhaps
growing all the more enraged inside at the warm reception that he won.
When the death threats came, they came not from the people whose
repressive tolerance he sought to expose, but from the alien masses
whose miseries he wished to vindicate against it.
It is a sad story in many ways, but not every man with a sad story is
a nice or a good one.

AIRDRIE-based Henry Bannerman Garments has been bought from
administration by the Ross-shire-based Ky-LIN Group for an undisclosed
sum, it was announced yesterday, writes IAN McCONNELL.
The move safeguards more than 140 jobs at Airdrie. Ky-LIN's plans to
expand the shirts, leisurewear, corporate uniform and children's wear
business, by opening a purpose-built factory in Alness, could create 40
new jobs.
A corporate rescue team from Ky-LIN, which operates in the same field
as Bannerman, was called in by the management shareholders about a year
ago in an attempt to save it from liquidation.
However, although the team significantly improved trading, Bannerman
was hit by a bad debt of about #100,000 at the end of last year and
Bryan Jackson, managing partner of accountancy firm Pannell Kerr
Forster's Glasgow office, was appointed administrator in February.
The move froze all the company's debts and temporarily prevented even
secured creditors taking steps to recover money owed.
As part of the sale agreement, Ky-LIN has adopted all the contracts of
employment of the Airdrie workforce.
Mr Jackson said: ''Administration is a rarely-used procedure in
Scotland but, in appropriate circumstances, it can be used very
effectively.''

Mary Brennan meets Maria Teresa del Real, a ballerina with a zest for
dramatic,passionate roles
MARIA Teresa del Real positively lights up as she lists a few of her
favourite roles: ''Fire-cracker roles? Oh, yes! Something dramatic in it
please! Some passion, character. Like Juliet. Or Katarina in Taming of
the Shrew.''
The fact that she enjoys dancing Giselle -- dances it well, by all
accounts -- brings momentary pause. You would hardly describe Giselle as
feisty . . . still, she has a very determined set to her in Act II . . .
yes, Giselle fits the del Real bill after all.
So too does Swanilda, the somewhat headstrong heroine of Coppelia and
the reason why del Real is in Scotland. She is currently guesting with
Scottish Ballet on its autumn tour, dancing Swanilda and tackling, for
the first time, Titania in Robert Cohan's version of Midsummer Night's
Dream.
''No, I hadn't seen it until last week in Aberdeen. So I've been very
busy learning it -- it's very interesting to do, good to work in.
''I'm always amazed by contemporary dancers, the things they can do
with their bodies. And I think when -- you know, as a classical dancer
-- you work in those movements, it gives you so much richness to bring
back into your dance. It expands how you see dance, it helps you to
release things -- you find you have other muscles!''
Watching her -- she is a highly articulate, physically expressive
conversationalist -- you catch glimpses of the little girl who started
dancing because her mother hoped it would keep her quiet.
''My mother used to say I was born to be an only child,'' she says,
laughing. ''Actually, I have two brothers. But I was so full of energy,
always needing to have something to do, that she sent me to dance
classes to keep me quiet. And I really liked it, and I was good at it --
so it turned into my career and here I am.''
Her being here is, in part, testimony to the quality of teaching that
existed in Puerto Rico. Born in Miami, of Cuban parentage, del Real was
hardly toddling when the family moved to Puerto Rico. No, it's not very
famous or well known in the dance world, is it?'' she says with a
mischievous grin.
''But I feel I had a really good beginning there. The principal -- a
Puerto Rican lady -- had been with Balanchine in New York City Ballet
and her right-hand person -- also Puerto Rican -- had worked with Alicia
Alonso in Cuba, and knew her technique. So from the start I had this
diversity of styles which I think is very important. You have to be
flexible, adaptable.''
Her own adaptability -- and talent -- took her at an early age (as a
scholarship student) to summer schools at New York's School of American
Ballet. At the age of 14 she was already in the corps of Ballets de San
Juan, since then she's danced with companies in Pittsburgh, Flanders and
-- before going freelance -- with the English National Ballet.
Freelancing has turned her into a resourceful nomad. Nowhere is really
home any more -- home would be a place where she could indulge her love
of cooking for vast numbers of friends.
On the road, there's no stove to call her own. But freelancing has,
she says, taught her a certain kind of self-discipline. And how to be
tough, too.
''I manage my own career, and so I have to go to the director and talk
money, asked for what I want -- and dancers don't usually do that kind
of thing. They're shy of doing it. They just want to dance. But I have
to do it, and then I have to go into the company -- and first day, they
don't know who I am, they're feeling 'Well, let's see what she can do'
and they're waiting for me to fall off pointe! But you have to fit in,
co-exist, try to bring good things into the company.''
One of the good things she's brought into her own dancing recently is
a stronger sense of her own womanliness. ''There is this terrible
sickness -- it is, yes, a sickness -- in ballet that women have to be a
certain body type. Very thin, sexless. Until, maybe a year ago, I was --
'No, no front, no bottom. Nothing. I can't be a woman on stage, I have
to be a bean. A straight line'. But then I realised, I don't like to see
that in other dancers. I want to see the beauty of woman on stage. I
want it to be joyful, uplifting for the audience too.''
The petite and thoroughly feminine Ms del Real will make her words
flesh on stage at Glasgow's Theatre Royal tonight when she dances
Swanilda with Scottish Ballet.

MR Tony Blair could not have looked forward to his encounter with the
Trades Union Congress yesterday, but just as obviously he had no doubts
about what he wanted to say. The speech, and the way in which it was
received by delegates, marked another reference point on the long march
to modernisation which was started by Neil Kinnock, carried on in a
different manner by John Smith, and which now appears unstoppable under
Tony Blair. Whether his two predecessors would have done it the same way
is a large question. Whether the TUC, the assembled delegates, and union
leaders in the country are content with the approach taken by the Labour
leaders is just as big a question. What is abundantly clear is that
there is not much they can do about it and that they have precious
little desire to kick up a fuss. In that sense Tony Blair's speech
yesterday was a success. He arrived in Brighton late, presumably to
allow colleagues to try to defuse the row which had been sparked by the
leaking of a document from earlier this year which made clear that
collective union involvement in the party must end and that Labour must
be a genuine one-member, one-vote organisation if it was anything.
The document was written before the new Clause 4 was adopted, but even
by restating the requirement for the relationship between the unions and
Labour to be changed its sudden prominence stood a chance of inflaming
sections of the Labour leader's audience. In the event they were not
inflamed, and even if they had been it would not have mattered. Mr Blair
spent a significant portion of his speech reinforcing the essential
message of the document, which was that the relationship had to change,
not into a distant one but into one which had clearly defined borders.
The key to making a success of a difficult speech like this is that an
overriding factor must be present. Mr Blair has produced it before and
he produced it again yesterday. It is, as he said, ''the utter futility
of opposition,'' with its potent corollary, the necessity of power.
There is no doubt that this message carries weight with the unions.
In the old, luxurious days of union muscle there was enough fun and
satisfaction to be had by vigorous flexing of what they had. Unions now
have next to nothing. They have been stripped of power and influence by
legal means, have suffered the pains of contraction and straitened
times. Like the workforce they used to represent so powerfully they are
anxious and feel impotent. In this they are joined by the
middle-classes. New Labour, powerful, effective, and potentially a
winner, is all they have and the chances that they will kick against it
diminish by the day.
This allows Mr Blair to take what would formerly have been considered
as liberties. He told them bluntly that not all Tory union laws would be
repealed. By this he meant the requirement for ballots before strikes
and the banning of flying pickets. He did not say which of the more
Draconian impositions would be removed by a Labour Government but,
whether or not his audience liked it, ballots must stay and flying
pickets must never return. This is sense, and in their hearts they knew
it too. An effective orator, Mr Blair is at his best when he leaves his
text. It was at this point that it was obvious that, pace cynicism, he
is a desperately serious politician who believes in what he is saying
and is utterly determined to accomplish it. If his audience had any
doubts left about his intentions they were dispelled. It may not be
possible to agree with all he says, but at the moment he is the most
intriguing politician in sight.

<TEXT>
THE Governor of the Bank of England had much of interest to say about
the future of house prices in his speech to mortgage lenders yesterday.
Assuming that a low inflationary environment is here to stay, then
house-price stability is likely to replace the boom and bust of recent
years. That should be welcomed though, as Mr George pointed out, home
owners face problems of transition. These are evident enough in the
stagnant market, in negative equity, and repossessions, though there is
a marked difference in experience between Scotland and England in these
areas, partly because Scottish house prices generally did not reach the
levels common in England, especially in the south and east, and partly
because borrowers were more prudent in the size of the loans they took
out. For these reasons the Scottish market, though often sticky, has
seldom been stagnant; negative equity, while not unknown, is hardly
common; and the same is true of repossessions. That may be small comfort
to anyone actually suffering from the entrapment of negative equity or
the loss of repossession, but the general Scottish experience remains
more benign than its southern equivalent.
It looks as if home ownership will cease to be the automatic choice
for young people starting out in independent life -- renting will be
much more common, especially because the state has ended its hostility
to landlords but also because the advantages of mobilty conferred by
renting are better understood, while the fiscal privileges of ownership
have been restricted, though not entirely eliminated. A house will cease
to be regarded as an instrument of investment rather than a place to
live: and Governor George was surely right to hope that buyers would
consider fixed rather than variable-interest mortgages. This would end
the problem which faces many who bought at market peaks only to find
themselves badly stretched when the interest rate cycle went its own
way. It would be worth paying more interest for stability, especially at
a time when changing patterns of employment make long-term income flows
far more difficult for borrowers to predict and lenders to trust.
Yet there are virtues -- and advantages -- in home ownership even in
an era of modest inflation. If real prices do rise, then those of
second-hand houses, the overwhelming majority of the stock, must tend to
rise as well as new house prices will go up. And, longer term, ownership
(especially if financed by fixed rather than variable-interest loans)
ought to beat renting. A house will remain a sound instrument for
saving, even if the returns are not distorted by inflationary influences
and expectations. Not everyone will want to rent, which is not a cheap
option, though one most easily tailored to changing financial
circumstances. People may buy houses later in life and with larger
accumulated deposits: lending institutions should be more reluctant to
advance loans equal to the value of the property on which they are
secured (and not least because such values are notional and subject to
considerable fluctuation).
The Government should ignore calls to use its powers to reactivate the
housing market. It certainly should not restore the tax advantages of
mortgage interest relief. The pain of mortgage payers will diminish
where their borrowings were subject to annual repayment instalments; and
even those with endowment mortgage schemes, though not so well placed,
could yet turn out to be less crippled than is feared. Home ownership is
not a way to easy money but involves considerable immediate sacrifice
for longer-term gain. That reality is obscured by periods of high
inflation.

THIS is not proving to be an easy year for the Duke of Atholl despite
a private fortune estimated at a cool #140m or 10 roll-over lottery
jackpots. Some of the natives and virtually all of the press corps are
getting restless at the Duke's ability to call to arms not just his own
private Army but the public one as well.
It emerged in July that the Royal Engineers had answered the call of
nobility in July to repair a river bank on the Duke's estate. This
followed an earlier controversy in May when he was accused of cashing in
on a BBC TV series by charging motorists a fiver to drive through his
estate on a potholed road. There is no suggestion as yet that the
potholes are next on the Army's agenda.
Now it has emerged that the Army performed a double cross-Scotland
airlift of military tents and gear for horse trials at Blair Castle late
last month. Apparently four Gazelle helicopters flew the equipment in
from Lothian while Territorial Army soldiers from the local Black Watch
regiment were on hand to fix showjumps during the international trials
at the four-day event.
Nothing so vulgar as money changed hands for this rather expensive
exercise, the Army citing it as ''payment in kind'' to the Duke's factor
for allowing them to train on his estate.
All of which has provoked a considerable stooshie with my colleague,
Roseanna Cunningham, the new MP for Perthshire, rather memorably summing
up the Duke as a ''chancer'', which is both briefer and more printable
than some of the local comments.
The Army has reacted with a suitably stiff upper lip pointing out that
the Duke is by no means alone in being helped as part of their training
exercises. The National Trust is just one organisation which has had
recent cause to be grateful for logistical support.
This is a fair point, of course, and I suspect that many local and
charitable organisations throughout Scotland have been helped out by
their local regiment or base. I was at Boddam gala on Saturday and the
RAF tents pitched down at the harbour were pretty vital for protection
in the prevailing weather conditions in the North-east of Scotland.
However, there is a bit of a difference, is there not between the
local military helping out local charitable organisations on the one
hand and supporting the estate of a Duke on the other. These are tough
times for aristocrats, no doubt, but the Duke of Atholl is not yet on
his uppers.
Nor are the Atholl Estates run as a charity or by the public interest.
It is revealing to compare the Ministry of Defence rapid response to
the Duke of Atholl with their tepid attitude to film-makers. A Mr David
Davies of the MoD, speaking from London, told the Press and Journal last
week that film-makers were charged premium rates for using their
services.
Rather proud of his department's new-found commercial expertise, he
commented, ''We just think why not? It's coming back to the taxpayer
after all.''
Mr Davies reckoned that film-makers would pay top whack for the
expertise on offer from the British Army and no doubt some do. ''Our men
and equipment are geared for warfare therefore the bill will be much
higher than a commercial one.''
However, this was not the view of the makers of Braveheart to whom the
willing support of the Irish Army was one of the factors which took much
of the filming from Scotland. As I understand the position, the Irish
Arts Minister Michael D Higgins has the authority to offer this as part
of his hugely successful pitch at Hollywood.
The MoD whine that they have no record of any approach from Braveheart
while the Scottish regiments make it clear that they would have been
delighted to have their soldiers re-enacting the battles of Stirling
Bridge or Falkirk. But no-one seems to have had the command or the
initiative of a Michael Higgins.
Michael Forsyth, undaunted by being roundly booed by the fans at the
premiere, says he is anxious to learn the lessons of the Braveheart and
the Irish experience. This is, of course, with the exception of the most
obvious one which is that Ireland is a small independent and now very
commercially geared-up country.
Initially the bold Michael thought that the exceptionally attractive
tax deal might be just the thing until perhaps he realised that the
Chancellor of the Exchequer might take a different attitude. He has,
however, found #100,000 from the Scottish Office budget to help promote
Scottish tourism on the back of Braveheart. This in truth will not make
much of a splash in marketing terms in the French and German markets but
has the virtue of being a relatively cheap press statement.
Now Scotland's ''faintheart'' is looking at other ways we can emulate
the Irish in offering real co-operation to film-makers. Can I suggest
that in this latest initiative he finds a starring role for the Duke of
Atholl as Scotland's answer to Michael D Higgins.
Clearly this is the man with the experience to put our forces at the
disposal of the film industry. And who knows what movies he can inspire?
With our noble families at last thirled to the Scottish as well as their
own cause we could look forward to a fascinating remake of Kind Hearts
and Coronets -- Brass Neck and a Coronet perhaps?

ACCORDING TO Robbie Dinwoodie ''a clear majority of Scots want a
parliament to legislate for domestic affairs . . . '' (September 8).
But how does he know this? Where is the evidence? Opinion polls?
Voting patterns? Surely not.
I believe the vast majority of people living in Scotland could not
care less about a Scottish parliament. When asked if they think it would
be a good idea to have one, the majority shrug their shoulders and
answer ''Yes'' out of politeness.
However, it is easy to say ''Yes'' when, at the moment, they do not
know how much it would cost, and what it would mean for their job or
their chances of getting a job.
George Robertson and Jim Wallace have, we are told, ''removed the
final obstacles to a Scottish parliament'' by agreeing that it should
elect 73 so-called MSPs and appoint a further 56. What nonsense! Major
obstacles are still in the way -- and I believe they will never be
removed.
For example, how much will all this cost? By how much will income tax
in Scotland have to rise to pay the salaries and perks of all these
''new'' politicians alone? How will the Westminster Labour Government
overcome English and Welsh resentment to Scotland having its cake and
eating it? Why should companies invest in Scotland when its taxes will
be higher than the rest of the UK? Etc, etc.
These are all cans of worms which no Labour or Lib-Dem politician will
dare to open. But, unfortunately for them, these questions will have to
be addressed and when the people finally hear the answers they will
respond with an emphatic NO!

I MUST take issue with the statement attributed to manager Moira
McKenzie in the Tom Shields Diary that the Usher Hall ''has an
energetic, new look, alive and kicking approach'', since my experience
of attending three concerts during the Festival at the Usher Hall
contradicts that statement.
I found, on the contrary, that the Usher Hall is sadly in need of a
complete interior refurbishment. The seats are most uncomfortable and
squeak at the slightest movement. The bar facilities are totally
inadequate and very congested and the hall in general looks very seedy.
I have a suggestion to make to Ms McKenzie. Why not transfer the
orchestral concert series during the Festival to Glasgow's Concert Hall,
whose facilities are Miles Better, and apply for some of the Lottery
money (as did the Covent Garden Opera Company to the tune of #58m) to
carry out the necessary upgrading of the Usher Hall?

IF Labour wins the next General Election we get a Scottish taxing
assembly whether we want it or not. If the Conservatives win, it doesn't
follow that we don't want such an assembly nor does it mean that we do;
but it won't go away.
With a population of 50 million in England and five million in
Scotland, General Elections are normally decided by English voters
whether we in Scotland like it or not. Hopefully the next election will
be decided on a compendium of important national issues for the United
Kingdom such as the state of the economy, a common currency,
unemployment, education, etc.
Whatever happens, it cannot be the right way to decide the
constitutional future of Scotland, which deserves and demands detailed
examination and decision as a separate issue by the Scottish people.
The solution is plain. There should be a referendum ''Yes'' or ''No''
for a Scottish Parliament with taxing powers. This should be held
before, not after, the next General Election. The advantages and
disadvantages of such an important constitutional change would be
properly rehearsed and understood before voting. The political parties
would see to that.
There was indeed a referendum many years ago, but it was inconclusive.
Moreover it was put about that to defeat the assembly all you had to do
was stay away from the poll. That must now be allowed to happen again.
Before committing us Westminster should therefore find out whether
there is a reasonable majority for or against; this time on the basis of
votes cast in Scotland.

ONE of the unexpected pleasures of a recent holiday was to experience
the high regard with which Scotland and Scots are viewed by Canadians.
The industry, courage, and perseverance of Scottish pioneers have been
accepted as general characteristics of the nation. Comforting and
flattering as this may be, much respect was given generously to the
whole nation and not ascribed to any particular political, religious, or
geographical groups.
Consider the recent behaviour of the SNP over the film Braveheart and
the character of William Wallace. The contrast could not be more
striking. While all political parties seek prosperity and employment
from the growth of the film industry in Scotland, only the SNP seem to
have the need to manipulate the memory of a national hero for their own
political ends.
They would serve Scotland better if they put the same energy into
securing a devolved Scottish Parliament, as they did into sidling
obsequiously into Mel Gibson's shadow.
Mr Salmond's posturing in Stirling hardly evokes the qualities
exhibited by Wallace, whose memory and spirit belong to Scots of all
persuasions. Wallace is a national hero, not a nationalist icon.

NICOLA Reeves wrote a column (September 7) on a subject even dearer to
my heart than hers, but I am 70 years old and she is not.
My goodness! We auld yins are a problem, no doubt about it, but if
everyone is as mixed-up as Nicola seems to be, it's no wonder. Her heart
is in the right place, but what are we to make of someone who says,
writing of a patient/client/customer/problem lying on a NHS bed and
about to be shunted elsewhere, ''Obsession with budgets means that
social services delay paperwork so that the NHS, ie the taxpayer, picks
up the tab''? Who else pays for the social services but the taxpayer? We
pick up both tabs.
Nicola Reeves continues: ''Hospital is the wrong place for the frail
elderly; properly regulated privately run residential facilities are the
answer. They are better able to provide a cost-effective service.''
I don't know the relative costs of private/NHS care, and I suspect
that if she knew them, she'd have trotted them out; without the figures,
the statement is mere opinion.
The ghastly thing is that even if we did receive figures from an NHS
or Scottish Office source, I for one would not believe them. That is the
state that this accursed Government has produced, and I am an ex-civil
servant with over 20 years' service behind me!
Back to Nicola Reeves's column: ''There is insufficient money to put
into the NHS.'' Our political masters have learnt well from Herr
Goebbels. Tell a big enough lie, tell it often enough, and it becomes
the truth.
There is plenty of money; just look at the Lottery flood; look at the
millions poured out on unnecessary subsidies to agriculture, in spite of
leading farmers from the Scottish North-east having the courage to speak
against featherbedding. Look at the amounts poured into nuclear power,
and poured out of the public purse with every privatisation.
Look at the #25 billion or more lost on Black Wednesday by Lamont and
Major, without a pursing of their lips. There is plenty of money.
There is, however, no political will. That of course may change with
the nice, mark two avuncular Mr Forsyth. Alas, my abiding memory of him
following on the heels of Margaret Thatcher as her most fervent acolyte,
and my shudder as I realised the similarity with Adolf Hitler and his
following Hitler Youth, makes Forsyth an unlikely saviour. A cobra can
never become a grass snake.
Nicola Reeves takes hope from this new idea currently being trawled,
that you could pay for long-term care out of your pension fund, though
the fact that this will significantly, perhaps disastrously, reduce your
monthly pension seems always to be ignored.
This, by the way, is so that the geriatrics, having existed on a
lacerated pension, can die happy in the knowledge that their heirs can
now sell their house and blow the proceeds. What a good idea!
We are in the hands of the most dishonest, dehumanised politicians
this country has seen in generations. They are also the most
incompetent. Having sold, as Harold Macmillan chided them years ago, the
family silver, and now the kitchen table, they still have to borrow
billions each month.
David Mellor, of all people, blew the gaff. He said it would cost one
additional penny on income tax to solve the problem. Just do it!

YOUR correspondents on Braveheart (September 8) seem to have missed
the point of the SNP's campaign. No-one would seriously believe that
there is an exact historical parallel, but there are strong lessons to
be learned from the story of Wallace.
The first is the duplicity of the Scottish ruling class, who then and
now work in their own interest, which usually means against Scotland's
interests. That same establishment has sought to eradicate knowledge of
Scotland's history, and play down our heroes in typical colonial style.
The second is the simple point that just as Edward I wanted Scotland
for what it could give him -- money, troops, and influence -- so
present-day Unionist opponents of independence run down Scotland and our
prospects of nationhood because they are benefiting from the status quo.
For Labour this means lobby fodder at Westminster; for the Tories it
means oil wealth to fund their policies.
If someone else wants what you have so much that they are prepared to
gerrymander democracy and campaign to undermine your self-confidence to
get it then surely you should ask yourself -- what's in it for them?
Having got the answer, we should value our own country and seek to
make it worth living in for all our citizens. In doing so we will, like
Wallace and Bruce, have an eye on international contacts and our role in
the wider world, which Edward I, John Major, and Tony Blair all want, or
wanted, to deny us.
Ballot boxes, not broadswords, can now provide independence and
self-respect for Scotland. The film certainly gave me that message, as
well as much entertainment. Mel Gibson was perfect in the role, and
while he was right to call the SNP ''cheeky'' for its campaign, a little
cheek is what we need when faced with the arrogance and insolence of
those parties and leaders who pretend to act for us, but are actually
against us.
Toom Tabards are all around us, as the tone of your correspondents
perfectly shows.

NIALL Stuart displays a fine sense of selective indignation at the
''vicious brutality portrayed in Braveheart'' (September 8), Mel
Gibson's fictional (and therefore conceivably exaggerated?) Hollywood
representation of William Wallace's thirteenth-century struggle for
Scottish independence.
May I enlighten him as to the precise circumstances which prompted our
nation's greatest patriot to take up arms in his country's defence?
In the spring of 1296, the year before Wallace's famous victory over
the English at Stirling Bridge, the invading army of Edward I had
ransacked the town of Berwick -- with the reliably estimated loss of
between 17,000 and 20,000 Scottish lives.
This was clearly an appalling medieval example of ''ethnic cleansing''
which naturally inspired in the Scots an entirely appropriate
''revulsion'' coupled with a ''determination to avoid its recurrence''.
Hence the guerrilla resistance led by Wallace which even after his
brutal execution in 1305 continued to inspire the Scots to go on to
complete the struggle for independence under Bruce.
It was the English -- under their allegedly ''great'', if not quite
''civilised'', Plantagenet leader -- who were the undoubted aggressors.
The Scots were simply defending their own territory and their own
freedom. It is regrettable that Mr Stuart is so pathetically blind to
the obvious justice of their cause.
Mel Gibson's film celebrates not anti-English violence for its own
sake but the struggle for freedom which is a universal theme. As
Wallace's priestly uncle taught him in his boyhood: My son I tell thee
soothfastlie/No gift is like to libertie.

OVER the next four years or so we will be hearing more and more about
the Millennium. The year 2000 is a nice round number because we use the
decimal system.
Were we to use the hexadecimal system, appropriate to the computer age
we are in, it would be the year 7DO which is not very special. The date
is not very special either in the Chinese, Islamic, Judaic and other
calendars.
As it is, it represents the fact that some people believe that Jesus
was born roughly 2000 years ago, a fact which might be of some
importance to practising Christians.
It certainly has no importance in Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism,
Islam, Shintoism, Sikhism, a large number of other religious beliefs,
atheism and (I cannot quite make up my mind about this one) to
agnosticism.
It is clear that it is a junket thought up by certain businessmen to
collect money to use on pet schemes and have a source of funds from
which they can legally cream off expenses and operating costs.

PROFESSOR Macleod leaps to the defence of his son John (September 7)
following the outcry over John's article about Michael Barrymore and
homosexuality. He states that John's ''condition'' is thinking it
perfectly natural to exercise free speech on the subject of
homosexuality.
Well, that's maybe an understandable spin for a father to put on his
son's outpourings. Isn't there a saying about every beetle looking like
a gazelle to its parents?
A more dispassionate view might be that young John's ''condition'' is
that he is an ignorant bigot. Ignorant in that, among other things, his
understanding of how human sexuality is formed and developed is well
wide of the mark eg. ''homosexuality is a lifestyle not a condition into
which we are born . . . ''
Oh really? Try talking to some gay people and learn from their
experiences of the real world. My dictionary defines a bigot as an
intolerant adherent of a creed or view. This might, as Professor Macleod
asserts, fit some of his critics, but it seems tailor-made for his son
too.
Profesor Macleod concludes that no son of his will ever turn the
blowlamp on homosexuals. Well, maybe not physically but journalistically
surely that's exactly what he does. Perhaps if he swapped his blowlamp
for a searchlight, like the best journalists use, we might all gain some
illumination.

NOT yet a year old, the National Lottery is such a vast and complex
organisation that it is bound to need adjustment in both its
fund-raising and spending procedures. Knee-jerk reactions to errors of
judgment or time in allocation south of the Border are not the best way
of reviewing allocation in Scotland.
The funds raised are beyond all expectations but the wide range of
imaginative and valuable capital projects bidding for funds can result
in cultural facilities throughout Scotland which we can all enjoy.
I estimate that most of those bids can be satisfied -- either through
arts, heritage, or millennium Lottery funds -- by 1998. To change
directions earlier would frustrate and disappoint many legitimate
schemes now in the pipeline.
By 1998 it is useful to consider transfer of the present capital arts
funding to endowment funding of particular companies or particular
schemes which will make the arts more accessible in Scotland.
For example, a theatre company with educational programmes, a gallery
with international exhibition plans, an experimental, innovative
community project might be endorsed.
Why not simply a transfer of money to revenue funding of the arts? The
danger of that would be to release central and local government from its
democratic commitment to support the arts and put arts funding at the
mercy of the vagaries of Lottery funds and of a non-elected paymaster.

A controversial charity is to be evicted from its HQ after failing to
pay the Ministry of Defence for the premises, reports George Hume
A BOGUS Army officer who claims to have given up a Rolls-Royce
lifestyle to make a new life for thousands of Rwandan orphans is being
evicted from his charity headquarters in Fife.
Donald Barker, who likens his work to that of Mother Teresa of
Calcutta, has been ordered by a sheriff to remove himself from a
Ministry of Defence compound in Cupar. He has until next month to pack
up his officially registered charity, The Disaster Aid Centre (UK) --
slogan, For Those in Need -- and hand back the premises. Sheriff Charles
Smith heard that he had failed to pay for them.
Barker has squatted among the sheds and offices of Hawklaw -- a former
GCHQ early-warning station -- surrounded by hundreds of pairs of ex-Army
skis dating from the Second World War as well as several miles of
mine-sweeping cable that saw service in the Gulf war.
The one-time Rolls-Royce driving, vicuna-coated property developer was
able to move in to Hawklaw following support from East Fife Liberal
Democrat MP Menzies Campbell.
After an approach from Barker, who claims a commission in the Royal
Engineers of which the Ministry of Defence has no record, the East Fife
MP interceded on his behalf with the then Secretary of State for
Defence, Tom King.
The result was that Barker was given the go-ahead to occupy Hawklaw
without having to pay for it first. He did, however, put down a deposit
and later a further sum of money. But the balance, which should have
been paid by August last year, remained outstanding. Because of
ministerial involvement, the MOD's plan to take him to court and seek an
eviction order had to be approved by Mr King's successor, Malcolm
Rifkind.
Of his support for Barker, Campbell said: ''The cause seemed a
justified one. It seemed to me to be an entirely sound and honourable
idea and I did not think it was necessary to investigate his background.
I took this man entirely at his face value when he asked for my
assistance. I knew nothing of his operations.''
Barker, 64, who once gave evidence in court to the effect that his
kitchen went on fire because his attention strayed when he found a
50-year-old African princess naked on a sheepskin rug in his
sitting-room, claims to have spent #100,000 of his own money to aid
victims of war and political upheaval worldwide.
Chairman and chief executive of The Disaster Aid Centre (UK), Barker
lives in an office behind the security fence at Hawklaw and keeps hens
on grass where giant masts once kept an ear on Soviet radio traffic.
Some years ago Barker suffered difficulties when he became, briefly,
the laird of Dunmore Castle at West Loch Tarbert in Argyll, a property
which the then developer ''bought'' but on which he still owed a
substantial sum of money when he moved in.
Today Barker admits that he took over the estate before paying for it
and that things then ''turned nasty''. A fire broke out at the castle
after he moved in and destroyed the tower but Barker had stored his
furniture in the castle garage. According to Barker: ''Police
investigated the fire but were never able to pin it down.''
Mrs Tova Grey-Stevens, whose home was Dunmore Castle prior to Barker's
arrival on the scene, recalls: ''He squatted -- literally. He put more
and more of his stuff in the castle and even when we changed the locks
he still got in.''
Now Barker operates from the boarded-up Hawklaw buildings which sit in
a sea of smashed packing cases and paper wrapping. Stored inside are the
superannuated skis, piles of chemical toilets, table loads of mess
stewards' jackets, several thousand body bags -- ''we call them bags,
general purpose,'' says Barker -- and a small amount of canned and
bagged food in ordinary domestic quantities.
Down the centre of one long room are three trestle tables referred to
by Barker as the Kurdistan, Bosnian, and Rwandan ''desks'' while outside
lie three giant coils of steel-cored mine-sweeping cable from the Gulf
war which, Barker says, he bought to build bridges in Rwanda.
The Disaster Aid Centre (UK) was registered as a charity four years
ago, the contact name given in the public record being that of solicitor
Mr George McQuitty. An assistant in his office in Cupar carried out the
formation of the charity for Barker who, according to McQuitty, ''paid
for the work -- eventually''. But the charity's founding document and
the annual report and accounts are not held by McQuitty.
Barker said: ''Nobody here gets paid -- just expenses. I don't get
paid. I can account for ever penny spent -- including the petty cash.''
Despite the difficulties, Barker remains stoic. He said: ''Donations
have dried up and I think the reason the money doesn't come in as I
think it should is that people misunderstand my principles. They ask
'Why does he do it?' I say to that 'Why does Mother Teresa?'.''
He went on: ''I used to live in a castle on a lovely estate and drive
a Rolls-Royce but there is more to life than personal possessions. Our
reward is to put a smile on these children's faces, that is all we ask
in return.''

Jack Webster surveys the scene after the heavens opened on God's
country
IN THE wake of the finest summer in recorded history, the floods which
came cascading on North-east Scotland have brought a nightmare scenario
without parallel in living memory.
This Doric Deluge has a special irony in that it is so severely
localised to an area, particularly the Moray Firth, which can claim the
best of Scotland's climate.
The glorious summer had raised hopes of a bumper harvest as the wheat,
barley, and oats responded to ideal conditions. But the best-laid
schemes come hopelessly unstuck when our unpredictable weather patterns
decide to pull one of their meanest tricks.
The result, which I witnessed for myself on a tour of the North-east
yesterday, is a vast succession of lochs where lochs were never meant to
be -- farmland lost to sight and trees up to the oxters in floodwater.
As rivers like the Don, the Spey, and the Lossie burst their banks,
one man at Keith reported a loss of 200 sheep while hundreds of farmers
surveyed the devastation of their crops.
Parts of the Forres-Dalls road was washed away and detours had to be
made wherever you drove. And at Banff Links 40 people had to be rescued
at a caravan site.
The loss of farming revenue runs into millions but the figures are
better understood in terms of the individual. Prominent Aberdeenshire
farmer Jack Sleigh of West Fingask, Oldmeldrum, cast an eye over the
ruination of his crop and told me: ''I had #40,000 of wheat growing
there. Now I'll be lucky to salvage half of that. This is without doubt
the worst flooding I have experienced in nearly 50 years of farming.''
Not far away at Inverurie another farmer was trying to coax his
livestock on to higher ground.
Yet, driving north from Glasgow you had not the slightest hint of what
lay ahead. Up through Perthshire you were basking in the glories of
early autumn -- blue skies and warm sunshine with the cereal crop cut
and secured and the stubble of a successful harvest stretching as far as
you could see towards the blue hills of that picturesque county.
After the record summer that was also the prospect for the North-east,
even if its seasons are marginally later. It was within that margin --
and with the ill-luck of the incomparable deluge which came day after
day with hardly a break -- that the damage was done.
On an idyllic day the first flood signs on the road north appeared
between Stonehaven and Aberdeen. But it was only on the approach to the
Granite City that a backcloth of sinister cloud rose out of the northern
sky.
I struck out for Inverurie, where the Don had burst its banks and the
landscape had taken on an even more unfamiliar look when that famous
Aberdeen landmark of Bennachie uncharacteristically disappeared from
view under a veil of cloud.
Picking my way around North-east roads, I ran into John Ross,
president of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, who had driven
from his farm at Stranraer to see for himself what his members were
suffering.
''There are hundreds of acres of uncut crop under water and thousands
more at risk,'' said Ross. ''I'm off to see one wheat crop which, I'm
told, is under four feet of water.
''One of the most worrying aspects is, that with the warm, wet
conditions, those crops are starting to germinate. I should think the
seed-potato people will also be facing a problem.
''For all these farming losses there is, of course, no insurance. It
is part of the risk we have to take.''
So I drove on by Huntly and Keith, where the Isla was overflowing, and
saw those massive rolls of straw floating on new-found lochs with little
hope of recovery.
Crossing over to the Moray coast by Cullen and Portsoy, I found a
similar story on an area of Scotland renowned for its pleasant climate.
Apart from the rescue at Banff Links, Grampian Fire Brigade was
pumping water out of houses along the coast to Elgin. Teachers at
Portknockie and Findochty were unable to reach the classroom while one
school near Keith was closed, apparently because of lack of water!
Grampian's firemen were also hosing down roads strewn with debris in
what was the start of a huge mopping-up operation. Ironically for the
farmers, the memorable summer had so dried up the soil that the sudden
deluge simply washed over it before there was time for absorption.
The weather men were forecasting better things to come before the
weekend. But as life gets back to normal, the farmers of the North-east
will be starting to count their losses at the end of what really
amounted to an outright tropical storm.

Hard on the heels of criticism of charges at Buckingham Palace, Lesley
Duncan hot-foots it to Edinburgh's royal residence where she finds value
for money
''THEY'RE guarding the change at Buckingham Palace.'' So ran one of
the wittier headlines in yesterday's papers. It referred to a damning
judgment by the Consumer Association's Holiday Which? The magazine had
looked at London's premier royal residence in the course of a
value-for-money survey of Britain's heritage sites.
Out of 14 locations visited, Buckingham Palace -- which has raised #5m
for the restoration of Windsor Castle since it opened to the public two
years ago -- was found to be the most expensive, charging #8.50 for an
adult and no less than #26 for a family of four. The palace's tourism
managers, the Royal Collection Trust, were accused of doing little to
repay visitors for their support -- a charge hotly denied by trust
spokesman Dickie Arbiter.
The Palace of Holyroodhouse, Edinburgh -- also linked to the trust --
was not included in the survey, though Edinburgh Castle joined Bath's
Roman baths and Fountains Abbey in being declared good value for
visitors. So how would the capital's own royal residence rate in the
public mind?
An overcast Edinburgh day had not brought out large numbers of
tourists at lunchtime yesterday. All the same, the palace shop -- which
opened at the same time as the new mews entrance to the palace in April
this year -- was doing good business. Foreign voices could be heard
among the throng of customers eyeing everything from chocolates
decorated with heads of Bonnie Prince Charlie and other figures of
Stuart history (cost: #2.50) to reproduction tapestries (cost: some
#200).
Colonel David Anderson, the palace superintendent, meanwhile busied
himself on behalf of an old lady who wanted a postcard of a watercolour
painted by Prince Charles at Balmoral. Delighted, she paid her 30p.
Not surprisingly the spacious shop is ''doing a bomb'' without being
overly commercial. ''This isn't Sainsbury's and we're not selling tins
of beans,'' says Col Anderson. The shop's turnover is expected to top
#480,000 by next April with a surplus of some #110,000. This compares
with an estimated palace admissions figure for the same period of
248,000 and an estimated surplus of #500.000.
Holyrood's admission prices were increased this spring, reflecting new
amenities inside and outside the palace. The sums remain modest compared
with Buckingham Palace's fees. They are #5 for an adult; #3.50 for
over-60s; #2.50 for under-17s; #12.50 for a family of two adults and two
children (small children are free).
But what about the public, who are, after all, the raison d'etre of
all the enterprise? There were just a few of them in the throne room in
the early afternoon. A Mr Makimoto from Japan was viewing the paintings
from the middle of the new red carpet which visitors are encouraged to
walk on (yes, this is a public-friendly palace). A query about his
knowledge of British history elicited an alarmingly erudite repost about
Richard I and Ivanhoe.
Would three geographically disparate Americans -- Sylvia Hamilton from
California, Janet Troutman from Atlanta, and Joe Zgonc from Wisconsin --
turn out to be impressed by Holyrood? ''Oh yes,'' said Ms
Hamilton,''this is just beautiful and the people on duty are very
helpful answering questions.'' Time and again people would stress how
informative and pleasant the staff were.
One recurring criticism did emerge -- the absence of audio or printed
information in each salon. No-one thought the new guide book -- also
available in French, German, and Japanese, to which Italian will soon be
added -- overpriced at #3.50. But several pointed to the practical
difficulty of lugging around numerous guidebooks when you are
travelling.
Into the picture gallery with its array of imaginary Scottish kings
and thence to the apartments of Mary Queen of Scots. Here the trickle of
visitors had turned into a flood. A blond Scandinavian couple were
eyeing the ambiguous patch on the floorboards, which might just be the
blood of the murdered Rizzio manifesting itself from 1566.
This chamber, stuffed with Stuart artefacts, many recently returned
from Windsor Castle, would make the palace visit worthwhile in itself to
anyone touched by the presence of history.
Ironically most people in the room seemed foreign, down to the group
of Spanish teenagers who pronounced the palace ''All right!'' No
Scottish 16-year-old were to be spotted. Do Scots undervalue their own
heritage?
Meanwhile Col Anderson is quick to take on board criticisms of the
lack of printed information on display. The aim has been to make the
rooms look as if the Queen has just left them. However ''some moderately
discreet signs'' are on their way, as is a much-needed tearoom.
Just how responsive the Holyroodhouse management is to the public is
perhaps shown by the garden paths. Some four tons of chips have been
removed from them to make them easier for wheelchairs (and high heels)
to negotiate.

Benedict Brogan investigates how political parties are getting to
grips with the Internet, recognising a propaganda tool they could grow
to love
To me it's a fundamental change, like introducing gunpowder to warfare
NEXT month Labour's annual conference will make electronic history by
being the first to take place not just live in Brighton but worldwide in
virtual reality, thanks to the party's enthusiasm for that darling of
the computerised classes, the Internet. If the wildest predictions come
true, the next step will be the abolition of Parliament and government
by the click of a mouse.
Those with access to the right equipment -- a computer, and a modem to
connect it to the telephone -- will be able to dial in and visit the
conference without leaving the comfort of their sofa. A computer
simulation of the Brighton Centre will appear on screen, leading the
visitor through the doors and into the foyer.
From there more computer doors will lead to the press office, the
conference exhibition or the conference itself. Depending on the choice,
the visitor will be able to leave messages for Labour's press team,
browse through the different stands or follow the conference's key
speeches. And at the conference, delegates will be able to stop by a
Cyber Cafe, equipped with terminals, to learn about the Internet. Shadow
Cabinet members, including Tony Blair, will even take time out to answer
e-mail questions.
The most logical response to this is: ''So what?'' There will be
enough of the conference on the BBC, the Internet is for electronic
trainspotters, and life is too short to waste time following politics on
a computer screen. But at Westminster the debate over politics and the
Internet is just beginning.
The Internet is a global system which allows computers and their users
to speak to each other and share information, for the cost of a local
phone call. In America it is already an established tool for government
and Congress alike. Here politicians and civil servants are struggling
to make sense of this possibility for politics. Some are even talking of
the birth of an electronic Athens.
Last year, egged on by the sudden popularity of the Internet, the
Government launched its Open Government initiative, which placed
information about the activities of certain departments -- including the
Scottish Office -- on the user-friendly part of the Internet, the World
Wide Web. Users at home, in schools, in businesses or abroad, can access
the information.
So far most of what's available amounts to propaganda. But supporters
praise it as a potentially revolutionary way of opening the workings of
government to those far removed from Whitehall. This openness -- at no
charge -- is something the Government is predictably suspicious of.
The House of Commons itself is finishing work that will give each MP
access to the Internet from their offices. Those who have mastered
computers will be able to invite their constituents -- and anyone else,
anywhere else -- to raise issues, seek information, and comment on their
performance. Only a handful of MPs have so far gone on-line, but more
are interested in the possibilities.
The Liberal Democrats were among the first to explore them, and leader
Paddy Ashdown is said to be an assiduous e-mailer. Labour, through
Shadow Heritage Seretary Chris Smith and his team, has produced a policy
document on information technology which seeks to marry the demands for
free access to information with the state's reluctance to tolerate an
unrestricted system that offers all sorts of possibilities to
pornographers and fraudsters.
In addition to its conference special, Labour has set up e-mail
addresses for a number of its senior politicians, including Tony Blair.
But the most active MP on the net so far is Anne Campbell, the Labour MP
for Cambridge. She holds a weekly hour-long e-mail surgery. With her
computer she can take questions, exchange views and resolve problems.
Her enthusiasm matches that of her university and hi-tech constituency,
which claims at least 20,000 Internet users.
In more deprived areas, however, the demands for surgery by computer
may be more limited, which may explain why Scottish MPs have yet to
appear on the small list of parliamentary Internet surfers. Despite its
growing popularity -- an estimated 40 million subscribers worldwide --
the Internet remains the preserve of the educated and well-off enough to
afford computer, modem, and telephone. The disenfranchised single mother
in Easterhouse can't e-mail Tony Blair from the battered phone box on
the corner.
Chris Smith is acutely aware of this. He points to Labour's policy
commitment to ensuring that the new information networks, from Internet
to cable television, reach every part of the country, and are not just
available to people who can afford to buy computers.
''We want it to go into every school, every library, every health
centre, every hospital, to make sure that even those who can't afford to
access it at home can walk down to their library or community centre and
do so.''
A Labour government would put the proceedings of Government, from
White Papers to debates in the Commons, out on the net for all to read
-- and comment on.
It is this latter point that raises problems. Parliamentary purists
fear anything that might erode the primacy of Westminster as the place
of government. If the people are given the right not only to vote, but
then comment on the activities of their elected representatives, what,
you might ask, is the point of Westminster at all? And if the people --
or at least those on the net -- are given the right to comment, does
that not amount to government by referendum?
William Heath, a partner in Kable, an information technology
consultancy, is enthusiastic about the prospects. ''To me it's a
fundamental change, like introducing gunpowder to warfare. There are MPs
for whom it's not worth getting into. They are beyond it. It's time for
a new generation of MPs.''
But he also sees limitations. Access to information and politicians is
one thing, handing over parliamentary democracy to a 24-hour open forum
is another. ''There's a limit to how democratic you want to be. You
don't want to have a free vote on hanging every week.''

Margaret Vaughan examines how, in the wake of the Dungarvan affair, an
Irish expert's claims about HIV transmission have caused dismay and
alarm among Aids workers in this country
A YOUNG woman infected with the Aids virus exacts a terrible revenge
by having sex with dozens of men. She confesses to a Catholic curate to
having slept with as many as 80 men in a mad fit of vengeance at her
awful plight.
The compassionate priest in whom she confides feels bound to disobey
the cardinal rule of the confessional and breaks the dreadful news to
his parishioners. The woman talks of having sex with men she met in
pubs, in discos, from County Cork to Tipperary, from Clonmel and
Thurles, and Kilkenny to Dungarvan, County Waterford, in one dreadful
splurge of anger, at society, and most particularly at men.
A horde, a veritable shoal of men come forward to say yes father, they
have sinned. The priest counsels them and sends them across the sea for
tests that will disclose their fate.
The horrible ploy of one disturbed woman has, it seems, ruined the
lives of five men who are confirmed as HIV positive. Another five live
in dread of hearing the results of tests. A further 15 queue up to fly
to the obscurity of an overseas centre where they will be tested in
anonymity. Others, an unknown number, quake secretly.
It may sound like the plot of some terrible, tacky Hollywood revenge
movie. It is, indeed, a horrible tale. If it's true. And that's part of
the difficulty. For there is a deal of scepticism. If not within the
believers of the congregation of the small, pretty, pious coastal town
of Dungarvan, population 7000, who gathered yesterday in uncertainty and
bewilderment and cold fear to discuss the latest round of rumours, then
most certainly within the scientific community of the Republic of
Ireland.
And it is their reaction which is, possibly, the most bizarre element
of the whole affair.
If it is true -- and how is it to be proved otherwise but for the
passage of time? -- it is a morality tale of mythical proportions. And
there, perhaps, may lie a clue to reaction to the priest's claims.
Leading the sceptics is the man who was, until last year, Ireland's
national Aids co-ordinator. Dr James Walsh insists that any such woman,
carrying the HIV infection, would have to have sex with each of the men
500 times to infect him. What's more, he added, some researchers argue
it would have to be 1000 times for the unlucky man to contract the
virus.
It was possible some people had travelled to Britain to have HIV
tests, acknowledged the Republic's leading physician specialising in
Aids, Dr Derek Freedman, but, he thought, it was unnecessary. And what's
more, he insisted, it was very unusual to find such a high reported
transmission rate, adding that the whole case ''served as a warning''.
''We have been reasonably successful here in having an HIV awareness
programme that emphasises, first, that one should choose a partner with
care and then, as a second measure, to use a condom -- which is slightly
converse to what you have done in the UK, where you have put a condom
first,'' he said.
The sharp intake of breath among Aids researchers from this side of
the Irish Sea to the doctors' assertions should have caused a tidal wave
on the shores of Co. Waterford.
''There is absolute cast-iron proof that only one exposure during
unprotected sex can lead to the transmission of HIV,'' said Dr David
Goldberg. He should know. As a consultant epidemiologist he is the
deputy director of the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental
Health, the man described as Scotland's leading authority on Aids and
HIV transmission.
Where Dr Walsh got his information remains, to him, a mystery: ''It's
quite simple. The situation is that if an uninfected man has unprotected
sex with an infected woman, then that man can become infected after one
exposure. There is no question about it.''
There have been cases where one exposure has resulted in infection: it
is not multiple exposure that carries the risk, it is the stage of
infection in the individual: ''Some people carrying the virus are much
more infectious than others. It varies with the length of time the
person has been infected.''
In other words, it is not the quantity of sex that is the risk factor.
It is to do with how infectious your partner is when sex takes place.
People carrying HIV are most infectious within three months of becoming
infected, and when the virus develops into Aids.
Robert Power, a researcher at the UK Centre for Research on Drugs and
Health Behaviour, said he was appalled by the reaction of the scientific
community in the Republic: ''The quantity of sex is neither here nor
there. If somebody is infectious your likelihood of being infected
exists in even one encounter. There is not a shred of doubt about it. It
is extremely dangerous and flies in the face of all the research to say
otherwise.''
Roger Lewis, the Aids co-ordinator of Lothian, offers perhaps the most
prosaic explanation for such an apparently high incidence of HIV
infection and for the reaction to it: ''The Irish situation is this: we
know that Mountjoy Prison has a high level of sero-positive people, that
is prisoners carrying the HIV virus. For cultural, historic and
religious reasons, Ireland has had a lot of difficulty in confronting
the full extent of HIV infection in its population.''
There was, he says, a significant heroin epidemic in Dublin in the
early eighties, at the same time that heroin abuse became such a major
problem in Edinburgh and which led to very high rates of HIV infection
in Lothian
''It has been observed, by colleagues in the field in London, that
maybe the Irish figures for HIV are not as high as they should be,
because people have not come forward for testing, just don't know they
are infected, or are afraid to be screened.''
Lewis, too, says he is baffled by the source of the Irish Aids
expert's claims that you need to have sex 500 times to risk becoming
infected. It is a dangerous, even deadly, miscalculation
''I don't know how he would have done such a calculation. We are aware
of couples who have had unprotected sex where transmission has not taken
place. We are also aware of cases where transmission has taken place
after one encounter.
''What people should be aware of is that when people are
sero-converting -- when they first have the infection, or where they are
moving from HIV to full-blown Aids -- they are extremely infections.''
In the past year, he said, the number of newly infected cases in
Lothian went up from 52 to 75. Of these, nine were injecting drug users,
35 were homosexual transmissions. The other 23 were heterosexuals who
contracted the virus from an infected partner.
There is, he suspects, an element of cultural denial going on within
the Irish scientific community. The difficulties of preaching safe sex,
and the use of condoms, in a culture thirled to Catholic teaching on
birth control and the advocacy of abstinence may offer an explanation,
but not an excuse.

Essex, Maryland, Tuesday
A MAN estranged from his wife drove his family to a shopping mall
parking lot and blew up their car, killing himself, his wife, and three
children.
The thunderous explosion yesterday shredded a station wagon, shaking
nearby homes and raining debris and body parts for blocks.
The dead were identified today as Mark Clark, 32, and his estranged
wife Betty, 32. Their four-year-old daughter, Krysta, and two of Mrs
Clark's children, Malissa Ray, 11, and Ricardo Valdez, six, were also
killed.
The girl was pulled alive from the blazing wreck of the vehicle but
died after being flown by helicopter to a hospital, witnesses said.
Police said they had no records of domestic violence, but relatives
have told police Clark had threatened his family.
''We strongly suspect that he brought his family in his car with the
explosives and the intention to kill them,'' said a police spokesman,
Lieutenant Steve Doarnberger.
Police suspect a form of dynamite called slurry caused the blast that
ripped apart the 1987 Ford Taurus station wagon.
Police cadets searched the scene today for more clues. Agents from the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms were also on the scene.
The explosion outside a shopping centre in this suburb of Baltimore
scattered debris and body parts hundreds of yards in every direction and
knocked out power nearby. The car's glove compartment was found about
half a mile away.
Police spokesman Brian Uppercue said the car was stationary at the
time it exploded, about 20yd from the entrance of a department store.
Investigators did not have any witnesses to the blast, which
completely demolished the car. Uppercue said it appeared all five
victims had been in the car when it blew up.--AP/Reuter.

Modena
OPERA star Luciano Pavarotti yesterday welcomed the Princess of Wales
to his home town and a gala concert in the park.
The princess exchanged kisses on each cheek with Pavarotti, who had
extended a personal invitation for the concert in aid of the child
victims of war-torn Bosnia.
''How nice to see you,'' the princess told Pavarotti, who greeted her
at the entrance of the Parco Novi Sad in Modena, near Bologna in
northern Italy.
It was an official engagement for the princess who first called on the
mayor of the town.
She had arrived in Italy just hours earlier to support the concert for
the British charity War Child.
War Child was started in 1991 by two cameramen who were shocked by
what they saw in the war in Croatia.
''Help'', an album compiled for the charity by some of Britain's best
young pop bands and featuring former Beatle Paul McCartney, went on sale
in Britain last Saturday just five days after it was recorded.
Also performing for the princess at the concert were Bono and The Edge
from Irish super group U2, Meatloaf, Michael Bolton, and Simon Le Bon,
vocalist with Duran Duran.
Among highlights of the show was a new song, Miss Sarajevo, performed
by Bono and The Edge with Pavarotti.
Entrance to the concert was free but all proceeds from audio, video,
and television sales of the two-and-a-half hour concert, shown live in
Italy by public broadcaster RAI, will go to War Child.
Concert organisers said War Child hoped to use some of the proceeds to
establish a musical therapy centre for children in Mostar.
''Our desire, our hope and our dream is to raise money so they can
live better,'' Pavarotti said.
''I remember myself when we were bombed here in the last war, we were
in the basement singing and that is what these kids have to do.
''We have to do something for them,'' he said in a televised
interview.
The concert, mixing opera, a 60-piece classical orchestra and rock,
before an audience of more than 20,000 people, was televised live in
Italy and will subsequently be screened worldwide.
In a strange combination of classical and contemporary music styles,
Pavarotti sang with Bono, the Edge, American superstars Meatloaf and
Michael Bolton, Simon Le Bon, Zucchero, who recently had a hit single
with Joe Cocker, with Delores, Irish folk band The Chieftains, Italian
rapper Jovanotti, and Brian Eno.
The princess met the stars of the show, including Irish band The
Cranberries, at a backstage reception and was later to be entertained by
Pavarotti at a celebrity dinner in the Modena Military Academy.

LABOUR MP John Home Robertson arrived in Sarajevo yesterday with the
first aid convoy from an overseas charity to reach the city since the
air strikes began.
The MP for East Lothian was among volunteer drivers who took six
trucks into Sarajevo for the charity Edinburgh Direct Aid.
The trucks were escorted over Mount Igman by French UN troops and
entered the city just before nightfall.
The charity, one of whose Scottish volunteers was killed by a sniper
last year, said: ''The trucks were carrying much-needed food parcels to
give to both individuals and organisations.''
Meanwhile, British officials have acknowledged Serb concerns that
Bosnian government forces could exploit the withdrawal of heavy weapons
from around Sarajevo.
Britain has urged the United Nations to negotiate local ceasefires
between Serb and Bosnian government forces and provide guaranteed
protection for the Serb population and forces.
The intiative has already received a ''cautiously positive'' response
from the United States and further talks are planned with the other
members of the Bosnian Contact Group.

PUBLICATION of nude pictures of the Prince of Wales in an Italian
magazine was condemned yesterday by royal officials as a ''gross
intrusion''.
The pictures show the Prince dressing in his private room while on
holiday last week at a French villa.
It is the second year running that paparrazzi photographers have taken
nude pictures of the Prince at the villa in Provence owned by a family
friend, Baroness Louise de Waldner.
A spokeswoman for the Prince said: ''There is no justification for
intrusive photographs taken of the Prince of Wales whilst on holiday at
the private home of friends in France.
''No public interest is served whatsoever by this gross intrusion. It
is nothing more than prying for profit.
''We hope that no British publication will use these photographs. We
understand that at least one foreign publication has published these
photographs and we are considering our options.''
The pictures in the magazine Eva Tremila Express, taken with a long
lens, show the Prince back view and side on as he puts on white boxer
shorts. Similar shots were in Paris Match last year.

Sarajevo
NATO warplanes today picked off Bosnian Serb military targets around
Sarajevo, ignoring growing Russian fury at the air raids.
A Kremlin statement said Russia could not be indifferent to ''the
tragic fate of the children of our brother-Slavs''.
It claimed: ''The survival of the present generation of Bosnian Serbs,
which is threatened by genocide, is called into question.''
Tonight President Clinton brushed such talk aside.
''There has been no genocide,'' he said. ''There has been an
extraordinary amount of care and discipline, with firmness and strength
and the air raids were appropriately done.''
Clinton said the White House and the Republican-majority Congress were
united in being opposed to the resumption of killing of innocent
civilians in UN-protected ''safe areas'' in Bosnia. ''We said we
wouldn't do it, we wouldn't tolerate it, and we can't,'' he said.
However, in its strongest protest over the Nato action so far, Russia
said that although nobody had counted the number of children killed, the
''tragic list'' was growing every day.
In the latest wave of attacks Nato aircraft targeted Bosnian Serb
ammunition dumps at Vogusca, north of Sarajevo, causing explosions which
could be heard clearly in the Bosnian capital.
Future raids could also see the American radar-dodging Stealth fighter
in action, once the Italians agree to its using bases there.
Italy wants a bigger role in the whole Yugoslav peace process in
return for having the bat-wing F-117As on its soil.
Italian diplomats denied any rift with Washington but said Rome felt
its contribution to military operations had to be matched by a more
prominent say on the diplomatic front.
Italy was giving careful consideration to the Stealth request but one
diplomat added: ''Our decision will inevitably also depend on the
framework of participation in the negotiating process.''
Nato would like Stealth jets, which struck Iraq with impunity during
the Gulf War, to be based in Italy as part of the Alliance air force.
In Washington officials said an agreement was expected soon and said
there had been no effort to shut out Italy from the peace process.
Meanwhile, US peace envoy Richard Holbrooke was today ordered to
return to Europe after briefing President Clinton to continue peace
moves started in Geneva which have so far yielded agreement on the basic
principles for a settlement.--Reuter.

north-west Rwanda near the border with Zaire, aid workers said
yesterday. The incident was likely to deal a blow to UN efforts to
repatriate more than one million Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire.
A UN spokesman said details of the raids were sketchy, but the
attackers were believed to be Hutu supporters of the Hutu government
which was ousted and driven into exile in Zaire by Tutsi rebels during
the civil war in Rwanda last year.

Beijing
THE body of a woman found in the Chinese beauty spot of Guilin is that
of British teacher Gillian Llewellyn, it was revealed today.
The Chinese Public Security Bureau told British officials they were
''in no doubt'' that it was 35-year-old Miss Llewellyn, who had been
missing since the end of last month.
The Foreign Office said local police had launched an investigation to
determine whether she had been killed.
''The Chinese police are in no doubt that the body is that of Gillian
Llewellyn,'' said a Foreign Office official. ''They are still
investigating whether there were suspicious circumstances.''
She was last seen alive on August 30 as she left her hotel in Guilin
on her way to Hong Kong.
She should have returned to her job as a geography teacher at the
Hewitt School, Norwich, last week but failed to make her flight
connection from Shanghai to Hong Kong.
The alarm was raised after colleagues contacted her parents at their
Swansea home. They immediately alerted police and Interpol and an
intensive international search was launched.
However, there was no trace of her until the Public Security Bureau
told British officials yesterday that a woman's body had been discovered
in the Guilin area.
Miss Llewellyn, who did not speak any Chinese, was an experienced
trekker who had walked through Peru and Burma on solo trips before.
She lived alone and spent all her annual holidays travelling around
the world.
The Foreign Office said it was waiting to hear whether the Chinese
planned to carry out a post-mortem examination on the body.
Hewitt School headteacher Christopher Wade said: ''We had rather
expected the worst after hearing a body had been found. I now have to
tell the staff and pupils about her death. That will be difficult.
''She was a marvellous teacher and a valued colleague who was liked by
everyone.''
Guilin, which has a sub-tropical climate, is one of China's top
tourist attractions and is famed for its landscape of beehive mountains
which dominate the tranquil River Li.

<HEADLINE>Hole in ozone 'the size of Europe'</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT EVANS</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>10</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976404685</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A RECORD ''ozone hole'' the size of Europe has formed over Antarctica,
threatening the Earth with increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation,
the United Nations' weather monitoring body reported today.
The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said the ozone decline, an
annual feature of the southern hemisphere spring, was the most rapid on
record since the problem was identified in the 1980s.
And WMO special adviser Romen Bojkov told a news conference the trend
-- although predicted -- reinforced arguments for developing countries
and transition economies to cut their emissions of the ozone-destroying
bromine chemical.
''The problem is that the effect is cumulative,'' he said. ''It is not
dangerous at the moment but could be depending on how long these
conditions continue.''
A WMO announcement said: ''The area with severely depleted ozone at
present covers over 3.86 million square miles, about the size of Europe,
and is twice the size of that during the 1993 and 1995 austral springs
in the same period.'
The ozone layer absorbs and blocks most ultraviolet rays coming from
the Sun. Any sustained surge in radiation reaching the Earth could lead
to an increase in cancer in humans and animals, reduce crop yields and
affect global food production.
The latest findings confirmed predictions by WMO experts last year
that, despite actions by governments to cut emissions of gases that
destroy ozone, the problem would get worse before it improved.
This year's figures, compiled by monitoring stations in the southern
hemisphere, showed that ozone values last month were generally 10% lower
than last year, the previous record.
However, during the second half of August and early this month, there
were several days when ozone values were at less than 200 units -- the
level at which scientists say a hole effectively exists in the layer.
Under agreements in Vienna and Montreal in 1985 and 1987, developed
and developing countries agreed to phase out by 1999 the use of
chlorofluorocarbons -- the ozone-destroying CFCs commonly used in
aerosols and refrigeration.
They later brought the date forward to this year, but many specialists
doubt the target can be met, although CFC use has dropped dramatically
in many industrialised nations.
In a report last year, the WMO said government moves to curb and
eliminate harmful emissions should prepare the ground for the recovery
of the ozone layer by the middle of the 21st century.
Experts still warn, however, that if even just one big developing
country -- China and India in particular -- failed to implement
phase-out commitments, this timetable could be ruined.
The UN Environment Programme said last month that while 25% of the
world's population had nearly completed the phase-out of ozone-depleting
substances, the 75% in developing and transitional economies had still
to begin reducing consumption.
A meeting in Geneva last month failed to reach accord on a plan for
cutting production of methyl bromide to be presented to a ministerial
conference in Vienna in November, due to resistance by developing
countries.
''If all CFCs are phased out but methyl bromide is increased, after 20
years or so we would wind up with another major problems for ozone
destruction,'' Mr Bojkov said.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
SWISS bankers have found millions of pounds' worth of assets in their
vaults which could be from secret accounts of Jews killed in the
Holocaust.
But the Swiss Bankers Association dismissed speculation that the
assets have swelled with interest over the past half century to #5bn.
The possible Jewish accounts found so far are currently worth #22m,
the bankers' association said today.
As the Swiss banks in Berne disclosed new procedures to help heirs
find the lost wealth, Jewish groups were meeting in Brussels to keep up
the pressure for recovering assets lost in the Holocaust.
Earlier this year, the Swiss Government formally apologised for its
treatment of Jews, including turning back many would-be refugees to
certain death at the hands of the Nazis.
The re-examination of the banking assets has been spurred by eastern
Europeans who were unable under communist rule to pursue their interests
in the West.
The bankers' association said that it had found 893 pre-1945 accounts
which had been without contact from customers or heirs since 1985 or
longer -- meaning they may have belonged to Holocaust victims.
The effort to track the money has been complicated for survivors by
Swiss banking secrecy, which was tightened after the Nazis came to power
in 1933.
Often the depositors were unable to pass on the account information to
survivors before Nazis killed them or they otherwise perished.
Under the new procedures, the bankers' association will set up an
office under the independent Swiss banking ombudsman to assist with
searches in accounts that have lost contact with their owners for 10
years. -- Reuter

MIKE TYSON has paid a ''minuscule'' sum to settle out of court with a
publicist who accused the boxer of sexually assaulting and beating her,
his lawyer said..
The civil case, filed by publicist Ms Phyllis Polander, was to have
begun today in New Jersey state court.
The trial would have ''distracted'' Tyson from his efforts to regain
the heavyweight boxing championship, lawyer John Trombadore said.
The publicist had worked for Tyson's now ex-wife, actress Robin
Givens, and often travelled with the couple. She claimed Tyson attacked
her in 1988, and she filed the lawsuit five years ago.
The court sealed the amount of the settlement, and Trombadore would
not disclose the amount but described it as minuscule. He also said the
fighter was not admitting guilt by settling the case.
The two sides settled last night, he said.
Tyson was released in March after three years in prison in Indiana for
the rape of Ms Desiree Washington, a Miss Black America
contestant.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S Communist Party was today confident that it is set to make an
election comeback that could give a powerful hammer-and-sickle alliance
domination of parliament.
Four years after a failed coup against Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev brought an abrupt end to more than 70 years of communist rule,
a new-look political force is waving the red flag.
''I expect us to strengthen our position significantly,'' said Gennady
Zyuganov, leader of the mainstream Communist Party of the Russian
Federation.
Beaming with confidence in the run-up to the December 17 poll, he
predicted that not many of the groups taking part would get the 5% of
the votes needed to enter the State Duma, or lower house of parliament.
''Seven or eight groups will determine the political process of the
future State Duma,'' he said.
But real power will still stay with President Boris Yeltsin unless
there are changes to a constitution that is heavily weighted in his
favour.
The Communist Party, which has about 10% of the 450 seats in the
present parliament, is leading in most opinion polls and an alliance
with the powerful Agrarian Party looks hard to beat.
Zyuganov said his party was also considering co-operation with former
Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov's Power to the People bloc.
But he made it clear that the Communist Party considered itself first
among equals. ''Our party has restored itself as a major political
organisation,'' he said, with party cells set up in even the most remote
corners of Russia.
Analysts say potential communist voters include the older generation
who are nostalgic for the past and struggling to adapt to market
reforms.
The party seems to have cast off the shame of the bungled coup attempt
by senior Soviet officials against Gorbachev in August 1991.
Shortly after the coup, Yeltsin supporters overran Communist Party
offices, party leaders disowned the organisation, and many burned their
once-precious party membership cards.
Zyuganov insisted there are many differences between the party now and
the old monolithic structure.
The revamped Russian party has abandoned the old ideological rigidity,
but its idea of market reforms is a long way from the present
government's course.
It calls for a crackdown on crime and market speculation, rebuilding
links with former Soviet republics, restoration of a state monopoly on
alcohol production and trade and reversal of what it describes as
illegal privatisation.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
FRANCE today accused New Zealand of misusing the International Court
of Justice to stage a political protest against French nuclear tests.
A Paris foreign ministry lawyer rejected claims that the explosions
threaten the environment.
Lawyer Marc de Brichambaut opposed New Zealand's bid to get the UN
court, based in The Hague, to ban the tests in the Mururoa Atoll and
said Wellington's legal team had played on public fears of nuclear
contamination.
''Your court is not a tribunal of opinion,'' he told the court's 14
judges. ''New Zealand has directed itself to world public opinion and
presented an apocalyptic vision.''
He said France, which does not recognise the court's jurisdiction, had
agreed to take part in preliminary hearings which will decide whether
New Zealand can reopen an earlier case it brought against French tests
in the 1970s.
But the French lawyer said Wellington had misled Paris by ignoring the
legal issue and instead using the court to air political objections to
the latest series of tests.
France held the first of a planned series of eight underground nuclear
tests in the South Pacific last week, triggering fierce protests around
the world.
New Zealand's Attorney General Paul East angrily denied using false
data to lure France into a public debate about the safety of the
underground tests.
''It is absolutely outrageous and we vehemently deny it,'' he said
during a break in the proceedings.
New Zealand told the court on Monday that the cumulative effect of
French nuclear tests on the atoll posed a serious threat to the area's
fragile marine environment.
But de Brichambaut insisted the tests were harmless and said New
Zealand.
New Zealand hopes to obtain a ban on the tests by reopening a case
which it brought against French atmospheric nuclear tests over 20 years
ago.
The court was due to conclude the preliminary hearings today and is
expected to decide within the next few weeks whether there are grounds
for a review of the 1974 case.
* A BRITISH Greenpeace activist who was arrested on Mururoa Atoll and
kept on the island during the nuclear test explosion today claimed
French soliders had threatened to kill him.
Matthew Whitting, 36, from Hereford, and fellow activist Al Baker, 31,
from Lewes, Sussex, gained access to the atoll during the countdown to
the explosion.
Mr Whitting, a former British soldier and French legionnaire, today
claimed: ''Getting onto the island was as easy as falling off a log.''
He said he had initially evaded capture, but was eventually tracked
down by six young French paratroopers.
He claimed he was pistol-whipped and then tied with a nylon cord round
his neck attached to a rope holding his arms and feet.
The soldiers swung him from side to side dragging him along the
ground, he told a news conference at Greenpeace headquarters in
Islington, north London.

A FRENCH general has proclaimed that Jewish Captain Alfred Dreyfus was
a victim of a military conspiracy in a famous scandal that divided
France a century ago.
Wearing full-dress uniform to emphasise that he spoke in the name of
France's military establishment, Brigadier General Jean-Louis Mourrut
said: ''The army's position is clear. Dreyfus was innocent.''
The sensational Dreyfus affair strongly raised the issue of
anti-Semitism a century ago in the French military.
Dreyfus, the first Jew to serve on the French General Staff, was
sentenced to life imprisonment in 1895 for spying for Germany on
fabricated evidence submitted secretly to his judges.
He spent nearly five years on Devil's Island penal colony off French
Guiana, where guards were forbidden to speak to him.
A campaign for his rehabilitation that rallied the French left was led
by writer Emile Zola, whose celebrated article ''J'Accuse'' detailed
accusations against army officers.
In 1896, new army intelligence chief Colonel Georges Piquart
discovered that the real culprit was a Major Ferdinand Esterhazy and
that his own predecessors had fabricated evidence.
However the general staff ordered a cover-up on grounds that the
disclosures would dishonour the army at a time when France was preparing
for war against Germany.
Dreyfus was legally rehabilitated in 1906, promoted to major, and
decorated with the Legion of Honour when it emerged that he had been a
victim of a case of mistaken identity.
But successive military leaders, long smarting from the harm caused to
the army by the generals' role in the Dreyfus affair, had never openly
proclaimed his innocence.
Mourrut, who made his declaration while addressing historians and
French Jewish leaders last week, said today: ''The case is clear. Either
one respects the decisions of justice or one does not.''
Dreyfus, who died in 1935, was a ramrod-straight patriot who long
refused to admit he was a victim of the generals in whom he placed his
trust, saying: ''I was just an artillery officer whose army career was
broken by a tragic mistake.''--Reuter.

Alison Kerr explains why women have long adored the scarf and its
ability to transform a plain outfit into a colourful creation
WHAT a difference a scarf makes. Any outfit can be transformed simply
by draping a strip or a square of material around the neck. Possibly the
easiest, and occasionally the cheapest, way to revitalise an old suit is
to spice it up with a contrasting colour or fabric.
On our trawl through the high street shops on the quest for scarves we
found that not only do they come in all shapes and sizes, but they also
span the price range: from the remnants of material which pass as
accessories in some of the cheaper stores, right through to the
glorified dish cloths which sell for nigh on #200 in designer outlets.
The scarf has clearly survived the decades to become one of the most
accessible of accessories -- and the most versatile.
As our pictures show, this season offers a classy crop of scarves:
Liberty has a huge and mouth-watering selection of sumptuous velvet
numbers in deep, glowing hues, from midnight blue to yellowy gold.
These are best set off against dark, unpatterned fabrics and look just
as stunning with a heavy winter coat as they do when they're doubling as
wraps over slinky evening dresses.
Similarly dual-purpose are the devore scarves which have caught on in
the high street since designer Georgina Von Etzdorf first sparked the
trend for burning patterns out of velvet.
For those more concerned with keeping their necks warm as the warmer
months disappear, woollen scarves in both traditional tartans and bold
colours will not disappoint.
A little searching will uncover a scarf that can be worn with any
outfit, any colour, and on the coldest of days to simultaneously provide
glamour and high fashion.
There are plenty of role model scarf-wearers to take as inspiration.
With shirts and high-collared jackets, the scarf-fancier can opt for
the Bertie Wooster/Noel Coward/Biggles look and create a cravat effect.
Or you can follow the Tom Baker-as-Doctor-Who example and sling it over
your shoulder, as you would your school scarf.
Alternatively, you could tie it round your head, a la Grace Kelly (but
take your rollers out first or you'll end up resembling Hilda Ogden), or
knot it at your throat (shades of Chanel).
But whatever you do, don't adopt Isadora Duncan -- the scarf's first
fatal casualty -- as your source of influence. Remember: motorbikes and
scarves don't mix.

THE RMT rail union has accused ScotRail of not ''learning its lesson''
following the decision to send the train damaged in the Largs rail crash
to England for repair.
The contract has gone to the Derby-based ABB -- even though ABB failed
to deliver its previous contract on time and within the original cost
limit.
Mr Hamilton Connolly, chairman of the joint shop stewards' committee
at the Springburn locomotive repair depot in Glasgow, said it was
incomprehensible that Springburn again should be overlooked when ABB's
previous record was taken into account.
The last major order from ScotRail was for the repair of two trains
damaged in the floods last December, when the two sets were totally
submerged at Glasgow Central's low-level station.
After undercutting Springburn, ABB said that due to additional water
damage being found, the repairs would cost more and the return of the
sets would be delayed by two months.
Mr Connolly said: ''It seems ScotRail has learned no lessons from
their experience with ABB.''
However a ScotRail spokesman said that it had done a lot of business
over the years with the Derby company and it was very happy with the
level of work that it had carried out.
The delays and increased costs on the previous order were perfectly
understandable and had been carried out with the full agreement of
ScotRail, he added.

THE Prime Minister and Tony Blair were manoeuvring for the tactical
high ground yesterday in the approach to the new political year, which
takes us to next autumn, when a General Election is feasible.
Mr Blair used his speech to the TUC to try to firm up resolve. Mr
Major, in Birmingham, launched a hard-edged political education plan.
Tomorrow, he gathers his Cabinet at Chequers to orchestrate Tory
revival.
Sensing that the Tories now might be emerging from a long sleep, the
Labour Party has been suffering an attack of nerves over the summer. Mr
Blair, in off-the-cuff remarks to the trade unions, sought to end this
wobble.
He left these to the end of a fairly lacklustre performance which had
been greeted politely. However, delegates rose to him when he declared
that what he is doing to the party and the union movement is not for his
own aggrandisement but to take power from the Tories.Power, he asserted
passionately, was what it was all about.
There would be a minimum wage under a Labour government, but its
timing and rate had to be flexible.
There would be a reinstatement of trade union rights, for casual
workers as much as those in permanent employment.
However, there were no other concessions to union leaders about their
place in the governance of Britain under Prime Minister Blair.
He did nothing to undermine the impact of a leaked strategy paper from
his campaign consultant, Philip Gould, which calls for even tighter
control of the party from the top.
Mr Blair told the unions that they should be absolutely clear about
their future relationship with the party which would have to change. In
future, they would be listened to, just like the employers.
''But the decisions must rest with us. We will govern for the whole
nation, not any vested interest within it.''
It was a watershed day in the Blair leadership. The political scene
has changed since Mr Major put his leadership to the test last July. Now
it falls to Mr Blair to do the same (without the encumbrance of an
actual election), with the unions, who see their influence ebbing away,
and very soon again at the Labour conference.
Mr Blair knows that his honeymoon period is over and that the Tories
are about to descend on him after a long period in the doldrums,
weakened by their own divisions.
Mr Major was addressing his pet subject of expanding the independence
of grant-maintained State schools. He is going to legislate for more
self-governing status and to allow them to undertake their own
commercial borrowing, perhaps mortgaging their buildings to provide
better equipment and results.
He confessed that he is talking about the ''nitty-gritty'' of
standards. However, education, he reaffirmed is the Government's top
priority.
The aim of the Tories, spearheaded by the political gifts of deputy
Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, is to undermine the Mr Blair and
expose what they regard as the Labour Party's ''policy vacuum'' a
judgment shared by the Labour left.
All Mr Major's endeavours now, in his conference oratory next month
and the new legislative programme in November, will be geared to this
political comeback.
And then there is the Budget. This will be used -- tax cuts or not --
to remind the electorate that the Government still is in control and the
days of drifting are over.
Mr Major's continuing excercise in consultation with his party
activists will be used in a succession of announcements by Government
Ministers to reassure the Tories that they have a ''hands on''
Government again, with the chance of holding on to power until the
Millennium.
Mr Blair, for his part, will warn that if Labour's nerve fails now it
could lose what he has called its ''last chance'' to defeat the Tories.
Yesterday saw a quickening of the political pace as the struggle for
power increases in urgency.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday laid down the law to his union
supporters and critics alike, emphasising that his controversial
modernisation of the party must continue if it is to win office.
In an uncompromising speech to the TUC in Brighton, he warned of the
futility of Labour remaining in Opposition. Only once in power could
Labour help the unemployed, the homeless and under-privileged.
Neil Kinnock -- present on the platform as an Euro-commissioner -- had
been right to begin the modernisation process, and the late John Smith
had been right to continue with it.
''And it is right now,'' Mr Blair said, adding that there would be no
new Britain without new Labour.
His couragous appeal, which earned him a prolonged standing ovation,
was made against a background of huge repercussions over the leaking of
an internal party document acknowledging that Labour was not yet ready
to govern and setting out plans for a centralised command structure
under the personal control of the leader.
Called The Unfinished Revolution, the document from Mr Blair's
strategy consultant Philip Gould, also suggests ending collective union
involvement in the party.
However, Mr Blair brushed aside this embarrassment, saying that Mr
Kinnock had been attacked similarly.
He appeared to suggest that such steps had to be taken in the
all-important cause of dislodging the Tories.
Defending his crusade for new Labour ''without apology and without
hesitation'', Mr Blair said he had to do it because the better, fairer
society he wanted to create was not some fantasy or dream -- ''it could
be true''.
However, it could only come true if Labour had the guts to ''tell it
like it is'' and not make promises it could not keep.
The main priority was ''power for a purpose,'' including helping the
long-term unemployed, improving education and workers' rights, ending
privatisation and introducing a national minimum wage at a rate to be
decided on once Labour took office.
Union leaders generally welcomed the commitments given by Mr Blair
but, in the interests of not jeopardising Labour's electoral chances
were reluctant to criticise his methods.
Meanwhile, a ''mole'' hunt has been launched to establish just who was
behind the embarrassing leak of the internal document which was
available only to a very select few close to the leader.
Blair aides made no secret of the fact that they felt that Shadow
Chancellor Gordon Brown's office was responsible.
As the row threatened to overshadow Mr Blair's first speech to the TUC
since he became Labour leader, the Prime Minister was swift to take
advantage of the turmoil in Opposition ranks.
During a visit to Birmingham, Mr Major warned that Mr Blair's
honeymoon with the voters was at an end and predicted that Labour's
negative campaigning would lose it the next election.
Although all union leaders were angry at the contents of the leaked
document, few were surprised as it was precisely what they feared had
been the case.
There was, therefore, some satisfaction that the ''kitchen cabinet's''
plan to dominate party affairs had been exposed to public scrutiny.
Few were prepared to comment on the record, but Fire Brigades Union
general secretary Ken Cameron voiced the feeling of many of his union
colleagues when he said the disclosures were ''extremely worrying'' and
''smacked of a Stalinist regime''.
The Labour document argued that the party had no ''political project''
to match the election-winning Tory agenda of Margaret Thatcher in 1979
and lacked a campaigning operation to ensure victory.
It also called for further cuts in union voting power to make Labour
''a genuine one-member one-vote party''.
Most damaging of all, it called for a ''unitary command structure
leading directly to the party leader''.
The paper also warned that Labour did not have the 6% swing needed for
a working Commons majority.
Shadow Cabinet members mounted a damage limitation exercise as the
leak raised fears that the internal wrangling over the pace of change in
the party would once again rear its head.
Shadow Education Secretary David Blunkett dismissed the document as an
''irrelevance''.
Former leader Mr Kinnock said the leak must have been done ''with
malice aforethought'' by an anti-moderniser, but dismissed the document
as insignificant.

CONGRESS was told yesterday that the future of the trade union
movement was tied to its ability to organise part-time workers.
Margaret Prosser, national organiser of the Transport and General
Workers' Union -- who is set to become the next TUC president --
outlined a campaign on the issue, telling delegates of measures aimed at
recruiting the six million part- timers into union membership.
The campaign has three key demands: equal rights for part-time
workers; an end to ''discrimination'' against 2.5 million who earn less
than #58 a week, and the introduction of a statutory national minimum
wage set at half male median earnings.
''Without part-time workers our hospitals, schools and factories would
grind to a halt,'' Ms Prosser said.
IN AN attack on the Government's abolition of the Department of
Employment, Congress backed a motion calling for a statutory training
levy and a national public employment service that addresses the needs
of the unemployed and employers.
LABOUR'S leadership was accused yesterday of blocking the selection of
Asian, Caribbean and African candidates for the next election. The
National Black Alliance said not a single black person had so far been
selected in a winnable parliamentary seat. It called on the party's
leadership to introduce black-only shortlists.
TUC general secretary John Monks claimed yesterday that the
organisation was now more dynamic. It had ''redirected resources away
from producing papers read by a handful of people at a committee, to the
production of a relentless stream of hard-hitting reports on crucial
issues facing people at work.''
ACTOR Tony Robinson -- who played Baldrick in the Blackadder TV series
-- yesterday attacked the Government for cutting arts funding and led
calls for an extra #37m to be spent on the industry.

<HEADLINE>Loch Lomond seeks tourism strategy</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A THINK tank is to be set up to promote tourism on Loch Lomond. One of
its first tasks will be to bid for Millennium Commission funds to help
develop part of the controversial Drumkinnon Bay site, at the southern
end of the loch.
Creation of the group was formalised yesterday at a meeting called by
Dumbarton's Labour MP, Mr John McFall, who is concerned about the
management of the area in the wake of local government reorganisation.
Mr McFall, who is to be chairman of the think tank, said: ''I am
delighted to have the backing of Dunbartonshire Enterprise in a
constituency-wide consultation on ideas for a project.
''I am looking for something that will enhance the area's considerable
tourist potential and put Dumbarton district even more firmly on the
map, creating jobs in the process.''
The decision to apply for Millennium money was taken after executives
of Dunbartonshire Enterprise took the wraps off some of its #52.5m
proposals for the Drumkinnon site.
Within a few years, it thinks that its tourism strategy could be
helping to double the existing spending by the area's visitors to around
#100m every year.
At the full trading position within 10 years, the strategy is expected
to have created 2000 jobs, 500 of them tourism-led, and 4000 new jobs
for Scotland overall.
Delegates attending the meeting were told that the reality of Loch
Lomond was far from the picture postcard image often portrayed.
Mr Donald MacInnes, the Dunbartonshire Enterprise's chief executive,
said the loch area was Scotland's foremost natural attraction, yet most
tourists only ever saw it through the window of a car or coach.
The problem was not just a matter of attracting visitors; five million
already travelled past the Bonnie Banks each summer. The challenge was
to encourage more to stop, stay longer, and spend.
That would require a better range of tourist facilities, both in terms
of quality and choice, he said.
Among the plans for Drumkinnon are an 80-bed three star hotel; a River
Leven footbridge linking Drumkinnon and Balloch Park; a Lomond visitor
centre; and wet weather facilities.
Mr David Hastings, the enterprise company's director of development,
said that without improving visitor attractions and accommodation,
businesses in the area were going to be extremely limited in their
ability to expand.
The demand and performance of Loch Lomond would continue to bump along
at the sub-optimal level it was at just now, and would only increase by
natural growth, he said.
Given the environmental sensitivity of the loch, there were limited
opportunities for new developments to take place. This offered a
fantastic opportunity for existing businesses.
Mr Ian Fernie, director of planning with the new Dumbarton and
Clydebank Council, said he hoped the new authority would see itself as a
major player in the future of Loch Lomond.
He pointed out that one-half of the authority's 100,000 constituents
lived within six miles of the loch, while the remainder were no further
than 10 to 15 miles distant.
But he warned: ''No other similarly located density of population
exists in any of the other authorities whose geographic boundaries
include the loch, and it is hoped that the new council will perceive
Loch Lomond as representing an absolutely priceless opportunity to help
increase the quality of life of its constituents.''

THE Women's Aid Federation and the Body Shop have joined forces in a
bid to highlight the problem of domestic violence in Scotland.
Yesterday, they launched ''One in Five'', a nationwide campaign to
educate the public on the scale of the problem and the desperate need
for funds for more women's refuges.
They also urged the Government to provide more cash for refuges for
the 32,000 victims of domestic violence in Scotland each year.
Campaigners say as many as one in five women will suffer verbal,
emotional, or physical abuse at some stage during an intimate
relationship, often hidden behind closed doors.
Simultaneous launches of a petition pressing the Government for
funding were made in Glasgow and Edinburgh, backed by MPs, councillors,
and celebrities.
The Glasgow Cenrtal MP, Mr Mike Watson, pointed out that the success
of the high-profile Zero Tolerance campaign which highlighted violence
against women had led to a serious shortfall in funding for refuges.
''The momentum of the Zero Tolerance campaign, which was so
successful, will be lost if back-up funding is not made available to
allow them to deal with the increased number of women who now realise
that they can bring their suffering out into the open,'' he said.
In Glasgow, demand for places in refuges has increased by 27%, but Mr
Watson said funding of the service was now threatened by the demise of
Glasgow District Council in local authority reorganisation. He called
for the Government to accept the need to follow up Zero Tolerance.
In Edinburgh, which pioneered Zero Tolerance, council leader Lesley
Hinds said: ''We welcome this campaign by the Body Shop to highlight
domestic violence, but also to put pressure on the Government to provide
more money for refuges for women.''
Ms Lesley Irving, Scottish Women's Aid spokeswoman, said the campaign
would raise public awareness of the growing problem and its impact on
women and children.
The Proclaimers' Charlie Reid was among the celebrities who have
backed the campaign.
He said in Edinburgh: ''Anybody would support something like this --
opposing domestic violence of any sort against women and children who
seem to be the main victims.''
The Body Shop will distribute campaign leaflets in 239 stores and
display petitions asking for public support.

A PSYCHIATRIC nurse who stole drugs, including Temazepam, from his
Lanarkshire hospital ward yesterday escaped being struck from the
profession's register.
A professional conduct committee decided in Edinburgh that Paul
Simmons, 32, who was dismissed from Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride,
could remain on the register but that he should be issued with a caution
about his future conduct.
Mr Simmons, currently a factory worker, admitted misconduct by
stealing 14 Temazepam tablets, 200ml of Temazepam elixir, and varying
quantities of other drugs from ward stock in November 1992.
He admitted a further misconduct charge of having amphetamine sulphate
and herbal cannabis in his possession without authority and for his
personal use.
The committee heard that the situation came to light when Strathclyde
drugs squad officers arrived at the hospital and questioned Mr Simmons,
who had a room in the hospital's nurses' quarters, but that no court
action was taken.
He had said at a disciplinary hearing that he had obtained the
amphetamine sulphate and herbal cannabis from outside the hospital, and
that they and the drugs from ward stock were for his own use.
Mr Simmons told the committee members he had problems with a personal
relationship at the time, felt ''stressed out'' at work, and was taking
drugs over a period of only a few weeks to help get himself to sleep.
He said he no longer had the personal problems and added: ''I like
working with patients. I miss it a lot. I would like to get back to it
if possible.''
Giving the committee's decision, the chairman, Mrs Elizabeth Rush
stressed that they did not condone Mr Simmons's conduct ''in any way''
and urged him to study the professional code and to update his knowledge
of nursing practice before returning to the profession.
The caution will remain on his record for five years.

AN organisation dedicated to improving the quality of management in
Scottish companies found its own management style under the microscope
yesterday.
The Edinburgh-based Quality Scotland foundation, with 130 member
companies, was taken to an industrial tribunal by a secretary, Mrs
Sheila McKerron, 48, who claimed unfair dismissal.
The tribunal at Inverness heard that at first the mother of three and
her new boss, Mrs Karen Stewart, 33, got on well when Quality Scotland
-- involved in the Investors in People scheme -- opened an office for
the Highlands and islands in Inverness last year.
But after a few months the two fell out.
Mrs McKerron, of South Street, Elgin, claimed the office manager was
bullying and dominant, guilty of ''blame transference'', and treated her
like an office junior despite her experience and qualifications.
Mrs Stewart, with five years management experience including hotel
marketing, also referred to her as ''McKerron'' instead of using her
first name or calling her Mrs McKerron.
The younger woman claimed Mrs McKerron was guilty of inefficiencies
and was aggressive and abusive when criticised.
The secretary by-passed her boss and went to see chief executive David
Justice, 60, at the head office in St Andrew's Square, Edinburgh.
Mr Justice said: ''This was a case of two ladies who did not want to
work together any more.''
The hour-and-a-half interview was largely spent discussing Mrs
Stewart's management style. But he felt the secretary's ability to
perform was coming under increased pressure as the workload in the
two-person office also increased.
He would have chosen the other candidate shortlisted for the
secretary's job but allowed himself to be overridden by Mrs Stewart, who
preferred Mrs McKerron's better personality.
Mr Justice thought Mrs McKerron lacked practical skills through being
out of circulation for several years raising her family.
Mrs McKerron said: ''He made it plain he could not do without Karen.
If anybody had to go it would have to be me.''
Mrs Stewart said: ''She was very unhappy that I had documented her
shortcomings. She would not discuss it. The next thing I knew she had
gone to see the chief executive.''
The tribunal will give its decision later.

EARL Waldegrave is not to be prosecuted over his wife's claims that he
threatened to kill her, police said yesterday.
The Crown Prosecution Service has reviewed a file concerning the
allegation and decided to recommend ''no action'', said a spokesman for
Avon and Somerset Police.
The 54-year-old earl, brother of Treasury Chief Secretary William
Waldegrave, has been on police bail pending the decision of the CPS.
He was arrested at the end of last month after an alleged incident at
the family's 3500-acre estate at Chewton Mendip, near Wells in Somerset.
The earl was taken for interview to Wells police station and released
on bail to return on September 28.
His arrest came after police were called to the family home, Chewton
House, by Lady Mary, 49, a former journalist.
She claimed her husband prevented her from leaving with their two
sons. Eight-year-old Edward and six-year-old Riversdale had been
spending the summer holiday with their father before returning to school
in London.
The police spokesman said: ''The CPS has recommended no action after
the review. That is what we will do. That is the end of the matter. Earl
Waldegrave was told of this this morning.''
The former Lord Chewton inherited the earldom in May. He had
completely denied his wife's allegations and maintained the alleged
incident was ''something of a joke''.
However, he admitted that the couple, who married in 1986, were
consulting solicitors over their matrimonial problems.

THE first transplant of a pig's heart into a human is expected to take
place in the UK next year.
Imutran, a company which has been developing transgenic pigs to
provide the hearts, hope to start a clinical trial at Papworth Hospital
in Cambridge.
Its plans were announced yesterday when the company disclosed a major
success in trials using monkeys.
Two immuno-suppressed monkeys have pigs' hearts still beating in them
60 days after they were transplanted.
They were among 10 monkeys given transplants with the same level of
immuno-suppression that would be given to humans. The overall median
survival period is upwards of 40 days.
The company told a meeting at the Royal Society of Medicine in London
that the experiment showed it had cleared the major hurdle in
cross-species transplant -- hyperacute rejection.
This is the body's front line of defence against invasion by foreign
organisms, and is aimed at rushing them before they get a foothold.
It involves a process called complement, which causes mineralisation
of the tissue.
''The data shows clearly that we have found a way to trick the immune
system of a primate into accepting a pig organ,'' said Dr David White,
director of research at Imutran.
''However, it is now just as important to to make sure the public
understands the potential of this technology to save the lives of people
waiting desperately for transplant operations.''
The Papworth trial will be carried out under guidelines from the
regulatory authorities, but the criteria for patient selection have yet
to be confirmed.
Mr John Wallwork, the hospital's director of cardiac transplantion,
said: ''The research is now well-advanced and we are making excellent
progress in developing animal organs for transplantation -- but it is
important to understand that it will be several years before they are
routinely offered as an alternative to human organs.
''The programme of human clinical trials will be a big step forward in
the development of a genuine advance in transplantation.''
If the transgenic pig proves a successful source of organs, it will
solve the major problem affecting transplant surgeons -- the shortage of
human donors.
Transplant experts attending the British Association festival of
science in Newcastle agreed that the future lay with biological organ
transplants.
Mr Michael Thick, in charge of liver transplants at the city's Freeman
Hospital, said: ''Mechanical implants have been the bridge between what
we could do in the past and the arrival of the genetic era. Now the
whole scientific community is waiting with bated breath for these
clinical trials.
''We have had to suffer the problem that we need, for example, 200
donor hearts here each year but we can only do 10.
''With livers, we have the particular problem that there is no
intermediate support system while you are waiting for a donor organ.''
Professor Martin Black, of Sheffield University, said: ''It may not
after all be such a pipe dream that, when you are born, you have a
litter of pigs available so that you can replace different bits as they
drop off over the years.''

POLICE investigating the death of Rachael Lean yesterday arrested a
man.
The man, being held at Cromer police station, is believed to be Ian
Wells, the boyfriend of Maria Hnatiuk, 27, who is also in custody.
Miss Lean, 18, was found stabbed to death on Sunday near RAF
Coltishall in Norfolk, close to her home in Buxton.
Mr Wells, a father-of-two, once shared a house with Ms Hnatiuk in
Lamas, Buxton.
His arrest came as Miss Lean's father Peter spoke for the first time
of his ''lovely daughter who did no harm to anyone''.
Miss Lean went missing on Tuesday of last week as she made her way
home from the Naafi shop at the airforce base. Her body was found in
undergrowth on Sunday.
Ms Hnatiuk was initially interviewed by police in Bristol, where her
mother lives, and later travelled with detectives to Norfolk where she
was arrested.
Police have been granted an extension to keep her in custody until
this evening.

<HEADLINE>Sensor aims to cut asbestos death toll</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ALAN MACDERMID</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

Alan MacDermid reports from the British Association festival of
science in Newcastle.
A CHEAP detector no bigger than a pocket-watch could save the next
generation of potential asbestos victims.
Consisting of a simple tinplate casing containing an
electro-statically charged film of polymer, the detector will attract
dust from the environment in which the wearer is working.
Developed by Dr Richard Brown, at the Health and Safety Executive's
Sheffield laboratory, it is the first of its kind in the world.
Introducing the sensor for the first time in public yesterday, one of
his colleagues, Dr Garry Burdett, said it was being used in a pilot
study to assess the exposure risks of maintenance workers.
Electricians, plumbers, carpenters, and others who work in buildings
are expected to be the next wave of asbestos victims to die over the
next 30-40 years from asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma.
Thousands have already died over the years, firstly in the asbestos
production industry before HSE regulation, then the heavy user
industries such as shipyards and railway carriage works.
The death toll is currently about 3000 a year in the UK. Building
trade workers already make up a quarter of that total which is expected
to go on rising, peaking at up to 10,000 a year between 2010 and 2025.
''There are thousands already exposed who will die over that time and
unfortunately nothing can be done to protect them, but we must ensure
that no more maintenance workers, who are often unorganised in small
companies moving from site to site, are affected,'' said Dr Burdett.
The detector, which will be cheap to produce, will not provide an
instant warning of asbestos in the way that a radiation badge does.
However, it can be handed out to workers for a few days and taken away
for analysis so that the HSE can get a better picture of the exposure
levels.
This will be a major advance on current technology, a cumbersome,
heavy pump which has to be used by prior arrangement with employers -- a
fact which may lead to a misleadingly favourable picture emerging -- and
requires supervision by HSE staff.
''The batteries run out, the filters have to be replaced, it is
awkward to wear,'' said Dr Burdett. ''There are no such problems with
the new passive sensor.''

PSST . . . fancy a nice cuppa? Well, I know the very place.
Just drive down the M74 and pull in at the Blue Boar's Waterside
service station near Lockerbie, Dumfriesshire.
''What?'' I can hear you yelp over your cornflakes. ''All the way to
Lockerbie for a cup of tea?''
But this is special. The service station has won the award for the
best motorway cup of tea in Britain, an annual trophy given by the Tea
Council. It is the first time the award has come to Scotland.
So I tore down the motorway to sample it, only to discover it was the
very same place I had been less than 12 hours before on my journey
north, returning from a long weekend.
Yes, I had been impressed by the service station and had made a mental
note to call there again. But I had no recollection of the tea being
anything but ordinary.
Now, you may think, like I did, that one tea-bag is awfully like
another.
''Nonsense,'' boomed Illtyd Lewis, director of the Tea Council, busy
fishing out the tea-bag from my pot of tea.
''See this? It's one of the world's travelling wonders.'' It looked
just like a tea-bag to me.
''It contains a mixture of 20-30 teas drawn from two continents,'' I
was told.
Who makes it? ''Ashbys.''
Sorry, never heard of them. Well, they are the de luxe end of the tea
market, like Gucci to handbags or Rolls-Royce to cars.
''What sort of tea is it?'' It looked like a very ordinary little
tea-bag to me.
'' English breakfast. We wanted a refreshing drink with a brisk
flavour to welcome the morning,'' she said.

No less than four world pre-
mieres of commissioned work and the showing of a rarely seen Scottish
art collection form the core of the programme of the sixth Borders
Festival, launched yesterday at Thirlestane Castle near Lauder.
The two-week event runs from Friday, October 13, and includes 80
performances at 35 locations spread over some 600 square miles. The
themes of the festival are Women in the Borders and The Auld Alliance.
The largest of the newly commissioned works is directed by Ann
Plenderleith. The show, The False Alarm, is about local reaction to the
lighting of beacons in 1804 in the belief that Napoleon's army was
invading.
The other two new plays are the work of local women writers. Get Up
and Tie Your Fingers is about the lives of the fisherwomen of the east
coast at the end of the last century.
Derners Twae is the sequel to the hugely successful The Derners, Mary
Strathie's tale of women in the textile mills of Galashiels.
The fourth commission is from harpist Savourna Stevenson, and is her
third work from the Borders Festival. The new piece, Beyond The Ballad,
is a collaboration with bassist Danny Thompson and singer June Tabor. It
will tour Britain after its premiere in Peebles.
That town is also the venue for the exhibition of Scottish paintings
from The Drambuie Collection. The family business has one of the largest
private collections of Scottish art and it is rarely on public display.
THE Highlands have won more than 100 jobs in the clothing industry
as a result of a #2m investment with the Ky-LIN Group.
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, in partnership with Ross and
Cromarty Enterprise, have secured the investment package at Averon
House, Alness, Easter Ross.
The Ky-LIN Group last night also announced a takeover of Airdrie firm
Henry Bannerman Garments, which has been in receivership for several
months.
This is the single biggest inward investment won for the area by Ross
and Cromarty Enterprise. Its chief executive, Mr Sandy Cumming,
described it as ''a major coup''.

THREE companies are being invited to bid for a #2m contract to build
the new North of Scotland Water Authority's headquarters in Inverness.
Mr John Robertson, chairman of the new authority, said yesterday that
each company would have exactly the same opportunity and it was absurd
to suggest otherwise.
Following Herald revelations that the Morrison Group was aware of the
brief for the contract before some of its competitors, an investigation
was carried out by the Scottish Industry Minister, Mr George Kynoch.
The inquiry cleared the Morrison Group, its chairman Fraser Morrison,
who is chairman of Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the water
authority, and Mr Robertson, who is also a member of the HIE Board, of
any impropriety.
The authority told the inquiry that it had approached Morrison and
other companies in other areas for ''indicative'' costings to assist it
to decide where to locate its headquarters.
At its first meeting last month, it was decided the authority's
headquarters should be in Inverness although only 80 of its 2000 staff
will be based there. It plans to spread its resources throughout its
area -- which stretches from the Firth of Tay to Unst -- and yesterday
announced that its information technology department would be in
Tayside, creating 15 jobs.
Mr Robertson told the authority's second board meeting in Dundee
yesterday that chartered surveyors D M Hall had been appointed to assist
it to identify suitable premises to buy or rent for its headquarters.
Its preliminary investigations of interest had resulted in four
''substantive responses'' which the board had considered.
It had unanimously agreed to invite proposals for leasing or outright
purchase from three of the developers who were offering new-build
options.
The fourth proposal involved an existing building and he said it was
not suitable and also was the most expensive option.
Mr Robertson said all three developers would start with the same
opportunity.
''It is quite absurd to even suggest that anyone was given an
advantage and I would refute it absolutely. They all start from they
same point, as you would expect.''
Draft charges for 1996/97 will be considered at the board's next
meeting in Inverness next month.
Mr Robertson said that during the private session of yesterday's
meeting the authority had taken a first look at the principles which
will underline its charges but it was too early to speculate what the
level of these would be.
''The general expectation is that charges will continue to increase as
they have in recent years,'' he said.
''Over time the new arrangements will facilitate efficiencies and
economies of scale but other factors such as new investment will add to
upward pressures. The board will consider carefully how to minimise the
increases in charges while permitting the authority to maintain and
improve the level of services.''

ACTORS in the Gaelic soap, Machair, have accepted #2000 after a
compensation wrangle over cancelled filming. Managers at Scottish
Television doubled their previous offer of #1000 compensation with
strings attached, after shooting of the autumn block of 13 episodes was
scrapped.
Twenty six episodes are normally made each year on Lewis.
Scottish Television had originally refused to pay compensation
although production dates for autumn shooting had already been given to
the cast. Many of the actors claimed they had turned down other work.
The 18 main stars then called in their union, Equity, to sort out the
wrangle.
Yesterday Equity's Scottish organiser, Mr Drew McFarlane, said: ''I
can confirm there's been an amicable settlement. All the actors are now
looking forward to working on the next series in the spring.''
He refused to comment on insiders' claims that Scottish had threatened
to pull the plug on Machair if the actors refused the #2000 offer.
Equity had originally claimed the actors' estimated autumn earnings of
about #6000 each.
One actor, who asked not to be named, said: ''They made it quite clear
that #2000 was their final offer. At least by accepting this, we hope
there will still be work for at least a few more years.''

Celtic chairman says fans must recognise positive connections.
CELTIC chairman Fergus McCann has spoken out against sectarianism in
football.
He also expressed disappointment at the persistent failure of some
people to distinguish between religious bigotry and the positive
connection his club retains with Ireland.
Seeking to explain Celtic's ''proud history'' as a non-sectarian club,
he hit out at critics of their decision to fly the Irish tricolour
beside the Scottish saltire, insisting the club's links with Ireland
would always be maintained.
Mr McCann made his comments in the club newspaper, The Celtic View,
where he revealed that Celtic have set up a charity fund which intends
to support children's needs, community action on drugs, and projects
which develop and promote religious and ethnic harmony.
The Northern Ireland Children's Holiday Scheme, which is based in
North Belfast and aims to break down the barriers of sectarianism by
bringing together deprived children from Roman Catholic and Protestant
areas, is among the projects Celtic are supporting.
Ms Jackie Chalk, NICHS director, explained that every club in Scotland
and England had been contacted about the Northern Ireland scheme but
Celtic were the only club north of the Border, and among the few in
Britain, who replied.
Celtic's involvement through their charity fund would help to
refurbish the NICHS youth club, she said. Their support was a ''positive
and constructive step'' in publicly opposing sectarianism and would help
to build relationships between the young people of Ireland.
Ms Chalk explained that NICHS was very much a ''practical
endorsement'' of the peace process at grass-roots level.
''The youngsters here are segregated and divided at a very early age,
but children themselves are not bigoted,'' she said.
''Our aim is to break that mould, even before it has the opportunity
to form opinions in the minds of tomorrow's adults.''
Mr McCann said the club's new charity fund was very much in keeping
with the club's traditions.
He explained that Sligo-born Marist Brother Walfrid had founded the
club in 1888, principally to raise money for the poor in Glasgow's East
End. During this time the city had a new Irish population developing,
and tensions were high between native Glaswegians and the new influx.
Brother Walfrid's aim had been to bring people together and create an
appreciation and understanding between Scottish and Irish cultures, Mr
McCann said.
Insisting that the club's links with Ireland would always be
maintained, the chairman went on: ''I was amazed last year when the club
was criticised for wanting to fly the Irish tricolour along with the
Scottish saltire.
''The white of the tricolour stands for peace between the green and
orange factions of Ireland. I cannot think of a more responsible message
for Celtic to promote.''
Mr McCann added: ''I want people to realise that Celtic is a club that
welcomes people of any sex, religion, colour, or creed.
''We are first and foremost a football club and a thriving business,
but that must be balanced with the realisation that Celtic is a major
social institution and the responsibility that brings with it.''
Anyone wishing to make donations to the club's new charity should
address them to: The Celtic Charity Fund, Celtic Football Club, 95
Kerrydale Street, Glasgow, G40 3RE.

SENSITIVE kettles and cuddly toasters could be on the horizon if a
domestic electric appliance company goes ahead with a bizarre marketing
idea. It is considering whether to back a research project aimed at
producing appliances which respond to the moods of their owners.
Dr Cliff Friend, reader in advanced materials and co-chairman of the
smart materials group at Cranfield University, Bedfordshire, said the
group had taken part in talks with the company, which he did not name.
''There are polymer materials already, which can respond in different
ways, like play putty which will bounce if formed into a ball. It (the
company) is looking at materials that can be made to stiffen if you lift
them aggressively, or soften slightly if you are feeling in a more
tender mood.
''From its point of view, the angle is that you fall in love with its
toaster and go out and buy one of its kettles.''
The sentimental kitchen may be some 10 years off, he said, but other
more serious applications are nearer at hand.These include optical fibre
sensor systems built into aircraft to monitor their structural condition
and bar the pilot from performing a hazardous move in the event of metal
fatigue.
Also carbon fibre lattices would replace steel in reinforced concrete,
so that a deterioration in the concrete could be detected through
changes in the fibre's electro-conductivity.

WEDDING cakes have become a barometer of modern society's laid-back
attitude to marriage, according to Dr Simon Charsley, a Glasgow
University sociologist .
He revealed that the traditional, three-tier structure, solidly-iced
in white, was designed to take Victorian wedding guests' minds off sex.
''In those days marriage was compulsory, in the sense that it was the
only relationship society approved of. Sex loomed large in the equation.
''But the Victorians were embarrassed about sex, so the cake was part
of the strategy to distract their attention from it.''
Now the old form of cake is crumbling away -- as marriage has become
one of a range of options for a relationship, so there are options for
different kinds of cakes, often personalised to reflect the couple's
life.

A BUS driver who ploughed into a group of sea cadets was jailed for
three months yesterday. Three teenagers were injured when the bus
crashed through a fence and crashed into their Clydebank heaquarters.
Andrew Watson, 33, of Plean Street, Scotstoun, Glasgow, admitted
driving dangerously while more than twice the drinks limit. He also pled
guilty to driving without insurance.
Jailing him at Dumbarton, Sheriff James Finlayson said: ''I would be
failing in my duty to the public if a failed to impose a custodial
sentence.''
The accident happened on June 15 as the 30-strong group gathered
outside the hall.
Mark Gill, 13, Richard Hamilton, 16, and 14-year-old Lisa Wotherspoon
were all hit and taken Glasgow's Yorkhill Hospital. Mark, of Heather
Road, Hardgate, Dunbartonshire, needed surgery on his elbow.
Defence solicitor Andrew Berry said Watson was driving the bus a short
distance to have its toilet cleaned out when he lost control.
Watson was also banned from driving for a year and ordered to resit
his driving test.

A SCOTTISH bride has been killed in a road crash on the first day of
her honeymoon in Turkey, just three days after her wedding.
Mrs Linda Millar, 33, died when the taxi carrying her and husband Tom
crashed as it was taking them from Izmir airport to their hotel in
Bodrum.
Mr Millar, 35, a constable at Drylaw Police Station, in Edinburgh, was
also injured in the crash on September 5.
Mrs Millar, was originally from Dundee and had a son, Mark. Her family
was too upset to speak yesterday.
Fr Neil Dorward, of St Leonard and St Fergus Church, Dundee, said:
''The family does not wish to say anything.''
A funeral service will take place in Dundee tomorrow.
A Foreign Office spokesman said last night that he did not know how
the accident happened.
A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said the force was stunned
by the accident, adding that Mr Millar ''is a very popular officer and
everyone is very saddened''.

<HEADLINE>NHS collapse warning as Dorrell takes hard line</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976404733</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE health service will collapse in the next five years unless radical
changes are made, a former trust chairman predicted last night.
The warning came as Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell pressed home
Government plans for a blitz on NHS managers.
Mr Roy Lilley, a founder member of the NHS Trust Federation, warned
that the NHS would have no future as long as it concentrated on
providing direct health care.
Instead, it should follow the model of some town halls and buy
treatments from some of the best private health care organisations, he
said.
Speaking at the federation's annual conference in Nottingham, Mr
Lilley dismissed suggestions that he was calling for the privatisation
of the NHS. He claimed: ''That would be like introducing a poll tax with
bandages.''
He believed that the health service should be free at the point of
delivery. But it no longer made financial sense for it to be publicly
funded, as 40% of adults were economically unproductive.
Ministers who believed that keeping local cottage hospitals was the
way forward were going down the wrong road, he said. Unless action was
taken now, the ''NHS would not survive''.
Mr Lilley added that the man in the street did not care who owned
hospital buildings or provided treatment, as long as they received help
when it was needed.
Meanwhile, in a blunt message to trust hospital chiefs, Mr Dorrell
warned they had to improve efficiency as much as other health workers.
His warning, made to the NHS Trust Federation annual conference, comes
just weeks after he predicted thousands of management jobs were on the
line.
Giving an after-dinner speech, Mr Dorrell said: ''What we must now do
is tighten up management. That means insisting that managers are subject
to the same pressure to improve efficiency as they quite rightly impose
on others in the health service.''
This also meant looking at the structure of management and improving
it.
''We must make sure that every pound of taxpayers' money spent on
direct patient care is spent to the best possible effect,'' he said.
''And we must make doubly sure that every pound spent on indirect
patient care -- on the salaries of managers for example -- offers good
value for money and is necessary for the efficient running of the
service as a whole.''

AS DRUG related crime spirals on Strathclyde's streets police officers
never know when violence will explode.
Yesterday seven officers were given commendations for their bravery
when confronted by armed criminals.
And Chief Constable Leslie Sharp revealed that all the incidents had
stemmed from drug related crimes. He said: ''Increasingly drugs are
becoming part of everyday crime.''
Sergeant Denis Feeney revealed how a man he and three colleagues were
trying to arrest in Norham Street, Glasgow, suddenly produced an
automatic gun from his trousers.
He fired at Sergeant Feeney and narrowly missed him.As the officers
attempted to overpower the man he tried to shoot at each one of them in
turn.
The lives of Sergeant Feeney and the other officers honoured --
Constable Michael Lavelle, and Detective Constables John Kyle and Donald
McKinnon -- were only saved because the gun jammed.
Constables Hugh Currie and Robert MacInnes were on patrol in East
Kilbride, when they were called to an armed robbery at a restaurant.
As they checked the premises a man came at them with an iron bar but
then drew a handgun.
Eventually the officers grabbed the gun, which later turned out to be
a replica.
The other officer to be honoured, Constable David Hamilton, was
off-duty, out shopping with his brother, Douglas, in Summerston.
A sub-post office alarm went off and the pair were on the trail of
three robbers, one of whom was brandishing a sawn-off shotgun.
After a chase one of the suspects was caught. Chillingly, one of them
had shouted to his armed accomplice ''Let them have it.''

RUSH-HOUR motorists on the M8, one of Scotland's busiest roads, were
yesterday spared the frustration of the usual one-mile queues after a
traffic lights failure.
Drivers using the motorway linking Edinburgh with Glasgow experienced
a trouble-free morning as traffic flowed freely on and off the Newbridge
roundabout, where lights were installed a year ago.
But opinion was divided over the benefits of the failure. While
drivers between the two cities were experiencing an easier journey, huge
tailbacks built up on other roads to the roundabout.
Elaine Berry of AA Roadwatch said there had been reports of two-mile
tailbacks on the M9.
''Drivers coming on and off the M8 have priority at the roundabout, so
this would allow traffic to flow freely, unlike the usual situation with
the lights, which gives drivers from each fork on to the roundabout
equal priority,'' she said.
A police spokesman said the rush-hour problems on the M8 had
disappeared with the failure of the lights. ''The lights have been out
on a number of occasions and there have not been that many problems,''
he said.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said the failure had been caused
by rain seeping into the signal box.
He said yesterday's problems demonstrated the clear need for traffic
control at the roundabout, and said there were no plans to withdraw the
lights.

A WOMAN plunged 13 floors to her death after a neighbour threw a
petrol bomb into a flat to stop music coming from a party, a court was
told yesterday.
Mr Peter Thurston, a BT engineer, wore a mask and dark clothes and was
carrying what seemed to be a machine-gun when he appeared at the door
and kicked a petrol bomb into the flat in Leyton, London, Mr John Bevan,
prosecuting, told the Old Bailey yesterday.
The resulting fire and confusion gave him time to cut power lines in
the fuse box and stop the music, he said.
Forty or more people at the party were surrounded by choking black
smoke and ''there was understandable panic''.
Many climbed on to the balcony and tried to escape to a balcony below.
However, Donna O'Dwyer, 26, is said to have fallen from the balcony to
her death.
Mr Thurston, 34, denies murder, arson, and two charges of inflicting
grievous bodily harm.
Mr Bevan told the jury: ''Noise may be a serious pollutant, but the
prosecution case is that this defendant is particularly susceptible to
noise and it makes him lose his temper.
''His reaction in this case was both outrageous and lethal.''
Mr Bevan said it was ''a particularly unusual and particularly
horrifying case of murder''.
''It is unusual because the Crown says that this defendant's primary
motive was not to kill, it was to stop the music,'' he said.
The trial continues.

IF they are wearing pink or gold shorts don't tackle them, and if
their shorts are purple keep well away. These are the rules which the
Aberdeen Strollers will have to abide by when they take part in a unique
rugby tournament in New Zealand later this month.
If they come up against Spanish opposition they will be hoping the
ball doesn't reach Ramon Morales because, at 94, he is definitely a
purple shorts player ''and all we can do is block his path,'' said Mr
Iain Hopkin, one of the stalwarts of the Aberdeen team.
However, if Ramon does score, no tears will be shed because the ninth
Golden Oldies World Rugby Festival is all about ''fun, friendship, and
fraternity''.
''It is really just grown men behaving like children,'' said Mr
Hopkin, who admits their activities are all designed as an excuse to
enjoy a beer or two.
''We swap badges, shirts, sweat-shirts, almost anything. I don't
expect I will return with any Aberdeen Strollers kit but I will have
bits and pieces from all over the world.''
The only qualification to join the 80-strong Aberdeen Strollers club
is age. You you can become a member if you are over 35.
The Strollers play friendly games against local clubs and their roots
go back to the mid 1970s. Their international debut was in 1985 when
they discovered the World Golden Oldies and at short notice took part in
the festival in London.
In 1989, they flew to Toronto as Scotland's only representatives in a
competition where the results are said to be so unimportant no-one
bothers to count the score.
In 1993, they competed in Dublin and later this week a party of 22 fly
to Christchurch for the largest event staged there since the 1974
Commonwealth Games. Two hundred teams are participating.
Around 6000 players and spectators are expected from 25 countries and
50 teams had to be turned away because there was nowhere big enough to
hold the end-of-festival dinner.
Amongst the nations participating are Oman, the Cayman Islands, and
Slovenia.
Have the Strollers upped their training in preparation?
''Well we don't actually do any training,'' said Mr Hopkin. '' . . .
other than elbow-bending training.
''We have members from clubs all around Aberdeen and we play the
occasional friendly when we run around and remember what we used to be
able to do.''
The oldest member of the Strollers party playing in Christchurch will
be Mr Bill Low. At 65, he has only just qualified for his gold shorts.
''The idea is to get a penalty 10 yards out and pass it to someone
with gold or purple shorts because no-one can touch them,'' said Mr
Hopkin. ''Imagine scoring a try at 65, or even 94.''
Amongst the teams the Strollers might face will be The Clontarf
Irregulars from Ireland, The Puckered Ruckers from England, The Hawgs
and Hookers from the US, and The Hong Kong Contemptibles.
Golden Oldies Rugby was started by Air New Zealand and is the flagship
of a growing sports travel movement for the over-35s, with festivals now
also staged in cricket, netball, hockey, and football.

A ROMAN Catholic priest who has caused an Aids alert in the Irish
Republic was interviewed by health officials last night as experts
continued to raise doubts about his claims.
Afterwards, Father Michael Kennedy reported that the woman at the
centre of his allegations that she deliberately infected up to 80 men
with the Aids virus ''has only weeks to live'.'
He confirmed that the unidentified woman was in hospital in Britain.
''I have a lot of basis for my claims. I am going to stand by my
position -- that people came to see me in absolute fear,'' he said.
Father Kennedy, who has family links with America's Kennedy political
dynasty, also spoke to his bishop, Dr William Lee, about the widespread
alert that has followed his sensational charges about the 25-year-old
woman carrier of Aids.
He said the woman could have infected as many as 80 men after brief
unprotected liaisons in up to seven southern Irish towns and cities.
Father Kennedy agreed to speak to officials from Ireland's health
board after demands intensified on him to provide evidence for his
claims.
The priest had earlier said that five of the men involved had been
tested in London after approaching him so that they could remain
unidentified, and that others were due to be tested there shortly.
He told parishioners at a Sunday mass that the woman had acted ''in a
spirit of revenge'' after contracting Aids from a boyfriend.
In his interview with the health board, Father Kennedy, 40, again
refused to identify any of the men, but agreed to approach them once
more to seek permission to pass on names and other details sought by
officials.
A spokesman for the board said later that, of 70 HIV tests undertaken
in the area last year, none had proved positive.
But anticipating fears among the public, two new testing centres for
sexually transmitted diseases were being established and a freephone
number would be operated and manned by doctors.
Scepticism over the priest's claims was led by Dr James Walsh,
formerly National Aids co-ordinator for the Irish Republic.
He said the woman would have needed to have slept with each man
allegedly infected at least 500 times, based on the current state of
research.

LABOUR MP John Home Robertson arrived in Sarajevo yesterday with the
first aid convoy from an overseas charity to reach the city since the
air strikes began.
The MP for East Lothian was among volunteer drivers who took six
trucks into Sarajevo for the charity Edinburgh Direct Aid.
The trucks were escorted over Mount Igman by French UN troops and
entered the city just before nightfall.
The charity, one of whose Scottish volunteers was killed by a sniper
last year, said: ''The trucks were carrying much-needed food parcels to
give to both individuals and organisations.''
Meanwhile, British officials have acknowledged Serb concerns that
Bosnian government forces could exploit the withdrawal of heavy weapons
from around Sarajevo.
Britain has urged the United Nations to negotiate local ceasefires
between Serb and Bosnian government forces and provide guaranteed
protection for the Serb population and forces.
The intiative has already received a ''cautiously positive'' response
from the United States and further talks are planned with the other
members of the Bosnian Contact Group.

THE Forth Road Bridge's two steel towers could be at risk in the event
of a collision involving a tanker or other ships, according to a secret
report to be considered by councillors today.
A copy of the document, which has been obtained by The Herald,
recommends that consultants should undertake an evaluation of the most
appropriate form of defence to protect the steelwork and estimate the
costs involved.
The report to the Forth Road Bridge Joint Board, which has a
membership of councillors from Fife and Lothian, has been drawn up by
the bridge's general manager, Mr Bruce Grewar.
It reveals that the board has already considered a report looking at
the risk of a collision involving a ship, but this did not address the
ability of the 31-year-old structure to withstand the impact.
The Babtie Group was appointed to undertake the first stage of the
study to consider ''the effects of ship collision with the main towers
of the bridge''.
The report reveals: ''The Babtie Group has now reported that the
concrete piers of the towers have sufficient capacity to withstand the
ship collision forces.
''They have, however, concluded that it is possible for a tanker
vessel to impact on the steelwork of the towers before striking the mass
concrete piers.
''It is considered that any ship impacting with the steelwork of the
towers is undesirable due to the fact that the towers are highly
stressed. It follows therefore that suitable ship collision defences
should be provided for the bridge towers.''
The board will now be asked to consider looking at establishing the
most cost-effective solution, taking account of the environmental and
navigation issues.
The report also recommends talks with Forth Ports and other interested
groups including Crown Estates and the planning authorities.
The report recommends the that Babtie Group should undertake the next
phase of the study at a cost of #25,000.
The last serious shipping incident in the Forth was in August 1976
when -- between the two bridges -- the Royal Navy oil protection vessel
HMS Reward sank after being rammed by a German container ship.

ASIAN restaurant owners fear that the Government will put an unfair
burden on them by making it a criminal offence to hire illegal
immigrants.
They claim it will turn them into virtual immigration officers, doing
the work the Government should be paying for and adding to their already
large amount of paperwork. In addition, any conviction could give them a
criminal record leading to a possible loss of a drinks licence and
consequently their business.
A Glasgow solicitor, Mr Dilip Deb, says he has been contacted by a
number of restaurateurs who believe that it would be an impossible task
for them to carry out such checks.
It is known that the Home Office is considering introducing a new
Immigration Bill to try to tighten up immigration controls. One
suggestion is that people who hire illegal immigrants should up fined up
to #5000.
Mr Deb added: ''It is for the Government to stop illegal immigrants
entering the country. It is not the job of small businessmen like Asian
restaurant owners to run immigration checks.''
A spokesman at the Home Office said that lots of things were being
considered but no final decision had been taken.

IT now seems certain that the body set up to protect the public's
interest in Scotland's ferry services will only consider the public's
view of the Skye ferry's withdrawal after the event.
The Railway Users Consultative Committee for Scotland, despite its
name, has responsibility for ferries. Yesterday, its sixth meeting was
held in Stornoway to consider its position over the Caledonian MacBrayne
service between Kyle of Lochalsh and Kyleakin and its withdrawal when
the Skye bridge opens next month.
At issue was the committee's statutory right to be the sole body which
would commission a public inquiry into withdrawal of ferry services.
Its predecessor, the Scottish Transport Users Consultative Committee,
exercised this right unchallenged. However, the Government appeared to
have forgotten this in its enthusiasm for the privately funded Skye
bridge.
No procedures were put in place to consult the ferry-using public. The
original view of the Scottish Office had been that the 1993 Railways
Act, which replaced the STUCC with the RUCCS, still allowed the former
to call public inquiries.
The Department of Transport disagreed. It issued a legal opinion that
even the STUCC never had the right to call public inquiries. The RUCCS
was told to hire a lawyer to advise it on this issue.
Yesterday, however, it emerged the Scottish Office had written a
letter to the RUCCS making it clear it held this right. Mr Bill Ure,
secretary to the RUCCS, explained: ''Under the Act, the committee has
the power to look into any matter it considers it should look into, or
any matter brought to its attention, as long as it's not a funding
matter.
''So it is quite clear that as far as the Kyle/Kyleakin service is
concerned the committee does have powers. What it doesn't have, and the
Act does specify, are the procedures to exercise these powers.''
Mr Ure said he did not think a public inquiry would be of great use at
this time. As a result of the meeting, Caledonian MacBrayne will now
publicise the fact that its service shall be removed.
Mrs Helen Miller, the new chairman of RUCCS, said she wanted more. She
said: ''It is more than likely that we will be putting up posters and
asking for passengers' views after the ferry is withdrawn. But we will
consider later whether to have a public inquiry.''

A COUNCIL worker in Ayrshire has been suspended and faces disciplinary
action after an elderly couple were buried in separate graves.
The family is now considering legal action over the blunder which will
involve a court order to reopen both lairs.
''We shouldn't have to go through things like this,'' said Anne Kyle,
44, of Irvine, who is seeing a bereavement counsellor after the mistake
involving her parents James and Patricia Gordon.
''It's bad enough seeing your parents get buried once. Now we've got
to go through with it again.''
Mrs Gordon, 75, died on May 26 this year and was buried in Knadgerhill
Cemetery, Irvine. Less than three months later, on August 5, James
Gordon, also 75, died.
The family attended both funerals but it was not until Mrs Kyle's
sister Hannah Payne, 41, visited the graves after the funerals that the
mix-up emerged. Her parents were in graves three lairs apart.
''I went up with my children and it just didn't feel right,'' Mrs
Payne said. ''The pictures I took of the background proved it. There is
someone else down there with my father but we don't know who.''
Cunninghame District Council, which owns the graveyard, is understood
to have contacted relatives of the third person.
Mrs Kyle, 44, of Bourtreehill, Irvine, said: ''I was up at the
cemetery when they were opening the graves and my son had to identify
the coffins because it was too much for me.
''We haven't been told the reason why or how it happened. We just got
an apology. It's macabre, like a black comedy. You don't think it will
happen to you.''
Mr Michael Callaghan, director of leisure services with Cunninghame
District Council, said last night: ''We deeply regret the distress
caused to those families involved in the mix-up of burial plots at
Madgerhill Cemetery.
''This appeared to have been caused by an error in the numbering of
lairs. A disinterment notice is being processed by the sheriff court and
we have informed the families involved of what they need to do to allow
this to proceed.''

SINGER Michael Hutchence was fined #400 yesterday after he admitted
attacking a photographer at a hotel where he had spent the night with
girlfriend Paula Yates.
The lead vocalist of Australian band INXS, who has also launched a
solo career, asked for 28 days to pay the fine and compensation of #1600
to a Sun photographer.
A second charge of using threatening and violent behaviour was
dismissed.
The couple had been harassed over dinner the night before the assault
by certain journalists on adjoining tables in the restaurant, Maidstone
Magistrates Court heard.
The situation came to a head the following morning, March 20, when the
couple tried to leave Chilston Park Hotel, at Lenham, near Maidstone.
Hutchence, 35, said in a statement later: ''I am very pleased this
matter has been resolved. I believe the modest level of the fine
reflected the magistrate's disquiet at the press intrusion into the
privacy of people who have expressly asked to be left alone.''
Ms Yates, 34, was not in court. She gave a written statement, which
was not read out.
Mr Andrew Jones, prosecuting, told the court how Hutchence ''became
quite annoyed by the pressure of the Press at the hotel''.
Mr Jones described how witnesses said they saw the singer ''launching
himself'' at the group as he and Ms Yates tried to leave the hotel.
Sun photographer Jim Bennett suffered a cut to his forehead, a bruised
upper lip, and a swollen left thigh. Almost #1800 of camera equipment
was smashed.
Reporter Mark Wood restrained Hutchence, causing #200 of damage to the
journalist's watch.
Hutchence struggled free and continued to abuse journalists verbally
as he and Ms Yates got in the cab.
Mr Jonathan Laidlow, defending, said the attack had been provoked
following three months of ''relentless tabloid press intrusion'' into
the couple's relationship.
''Mr Hutchence had just enough of this appalling behaviour,'' he said.
Mrs Susan Perkins, chairwoman of the bench, ordered Hutchence to pay
#1600 in compensation to Mr Bennett, #200 to Mr Wood, and #80 towards
court costs.

We dinna hed anither spate,
Like auchteen twenty-nine.
Aberdeenshire poet David Grant (1823-86) - only six at the time of the
Muckle Spate o' Twenty-Nine -- records a fervent hope for the future
after he had depicted the scenes of devastation in a poem. At least nine
people and hundreds of sheep and cattle were swept to their deaths as
rivers burst their banks.
THIS week's rainstorms are believed to be the worst to hit Grampian
since the Muckle Spate of August 1829.
Then, more than 24 hours of torrential rain left a trail of
destruction from Banff and Elgin on the Moray Firth to Aberdeen.
Contemporary reports in the Aberdeen Journal branded it a ''national
calamity'', estimating the cost of the damage to valuable crops, houses,
bridges and roads as running into hundreds of thousands of pounds.
At least nine people died and farmers were hit by a huge loss of
livestock.
Banff was said to resemble Venice with a fleet of boats ferrying
residents from house to house.
Hundreds of people watched helplessly as water levels in the rivers
Dee, Don, Deveron, Urie, and Spey rose rapidly by up to 14ft, washing
their homes and possessions downstream.
Lines of communication to the north were virtually cut off with
bridges at Banchory, Ballater, Dyce, Banff, Huntly, Keith, and Grantown
either destoyed or impassable.
Roads throughout the region, many of which were built close to the
route of the river, suffered a similar fate.
Historic Duff House, near Banff, was flooded, and the the garden at
Mar Lodge was swept away.
The ground floor of Mar Lodge, recently bought by the National Trust
for Scotland, was covered in a thick layer of mud and gravel.
Among the dead, a Towie blacksmith and an assistant schoolmaster from
Strathdon both drowned in separate incidents, trying to ford the swollen
Don.
An Aberlour innkeeper took refuge in a tree, but when villagers
launched a boat to try and rescue him, they were beaten back by the
force of the current.
The man's cries could be heard long into the night until the tree
finally gave way and he drowned.

A SECOND child has been told to stay away from a Lothian school
because of behaviour problems, it emerged yesterday.
The mother, who asked not to be named, told The Herald that her
seven-year-old boy had been excluded from school in the same way as
five-year-old Shaun Murray, who earlier this week was told to stay away
from his primary school.
She claimed her youngster suffered from attention deficit disorder,
but claimed both doctors and education officials had refused to
acknowledge the condition.
''I think this little boy is suffering from the same condition as my
son, in that he constantly talks in class and is mildly disruptive.
''No-one seems to be doing anything about it. Lothian doesn't seem to
have a policy on it. Other regions do have a policy on behaviour
problems,'' she said.
She has raised the matter with the Labour MP for East Lothian, Mr
JohnHome Robertson, to demand Government action.
A spokesman for Lothian region's education department said it was
''highly unlikely'' that recognised physical disorders would be ignored
by the authority.
He added that it was likely Shaun Murray would be back at his desk at
Trinity Primary School, Edinburgh, later this week.
The spokesman said talks were under way with concerned parties. ''We
are looking at the best way possible to ensure the continued education
of this child. He has been excluded until September 14, but I would
expect him to be back at school after that date,'' said the spokesman.
The boy was told to stay away from the school after only nine days of
his first term.

<HEADLINE>Counsel did not turn up to defend himself. QC's nine-day sleep fails to impress</HEADLINE>

A SENIOR member of the Scottish Bar claimed that he slept for nine
days and missed his own court appearance.
Mr Peter Vandore, QC, was supposed to represent himself in a case
where the National &amp; Provincial Building Society was trying to repossess
his home.
When the advocate failed to show up, a sheriff found in favour of the
society by default.
Mr Vandore, of King's Stables Lane, Edinburgh, appealed to Sheriff
Principal Gordon Nicholson at the city's sheriff court after the
decision, but has now lost his case.
The QC made Scottish legal history in 1989, when he represented the
first man in Scotland to be prosecuted for allegedly raping his wife.
His client was acquitted.
Sheriff Nicholson threw out the appeal after rejecting Mr Vandore's
explanation for not turning up at the original sheriff court case in
April.
''That explanation can only be described, in my view, as involving a
quite extraordinary episode when, according to the defender (Mr
Vandore), he was out of touch with reality for something like nine
days,'' wrote the sheriff in his judgment.
He also criticised Mr Vandore's presentation of his case at the appeal
as ''rambling'', and pointed out that what he said in court was
different from what he had stated in his written arguments.
Sheriff Nicholson said that, normally, when someone appeared for
himself he would not take too much notice if they were difficult to
follow.
However, he said he had to take a more serious view as Mr Vandore was
a Queen's Counsel and senior member of the Scottish Bar.
Mr Vandore failed to produce a medical certificate to back his claim
that he woke up the week before the case was due in court with his face
puffed up. He said he stayed in bed and, when he got up to buy milk,
found it was nine days later and he had missed the case.
The sheriff asked Mr Vandore if he had consulted a doctor about the
nine days he was ''in some kind of comatose state'' and was told he had,
but only at a much later date.
''The account which was given by the defender seems to me to be
riddled with improbabilities and unanswered questions,'' wrote the
sheriff.
The building society sued Mr Vandore for repossession of his house
when his mortgage arrears reached almost #8000.
Mr Vandore, who became an advocate in 1968, and a Queen's Counsel in
1982, claimed that the problem with his mortgage came about after he was
mistakenly made bankrupt by Customs and Excise.
He said that he was in intensive care at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary
when he was sequestrated, and knew nothing about it. He maintained that
he did not owe Customs and Excise ''a brass farthing''.
In his arguments against the building society, Mr Vandore also said
that he simply passed all correspondence about his mortgage to the
accountant in charge of his sequestration.
He also claimed that, as a bankrupt, he was not allowed to make direct
payments to the building society himself.
Yesterday, Mr Vandore said: ''I was ill and didn't know what was
happening. A few days before the case I woke up and could not open my
eyes.
''I stayed in bed for nine days but did not know what was going on. I
did not know what time had passed. One night I crept out of the house to
buy milk and realised nine days had gone by.''

Roads blocked, trains halted, homes flooded, and crops ruined as
weather goes against the grain.
FARMERS' leaders were last night preparing a case for financial aid
from Europe to cushion the industry in the North-east of Scotland
against the effects of a disastrous spell of wet weather over the past
week.
Torrential rain, at the end of a superb summer, has dashed hopes of an
outstanding grain harvest.
The rain brought chaos to the North-east for the third consecutive day
after two inches fell in 12 hours.
Roads and rail lines were closed and fire engines were called to pump
water out of homes in Huntly, Keith, Banff, and Elgin.
Council workers ran out of flood warning signs as dozens of minor
routes filled with water.
All major roads into Aberdeen were blocked for several hours during
the night and police advised drivers to take extra care on their way to
work.
The A96 Inverness to Aberdeen road was closed at Huntly when the
Deveron burst its banks. Traffic was diverted through the town and
police warned drivers that any journey in the area was ''not advisable
and should be treated with extreme caution''.
Trains between Inverness and Aberdeen were also halted.
Mr Alan Silver, Grampian region's director of roads, said yesterday:
''We have problems all over the place. Our crews have been up all night
sandbagging, pumping water off roads, and pulling cars out of trouble.''
One of their biggest headaches was tracing manhole covers that had
been forced off by the pressure of water in drains, leaving springs in
the middle of roads.
Rivers which 10 days ago were in danger of running dry were yesterday
at record high levels. Flood warnings were posted at all main rivers
flowing into the Moray Firth.
Mr Nigel Goody, of the North East River Purification Board, said: ''I
have never seen anything like it and water levels are still rising.
''We need two or three days of dry weather to allow the rivers to
return to their normal levels, but I cannot see that happening until
next week sometime.''
Hundreds of children, senior citizens, and handicapped people were
turned away from Elgin Community Centre yesterday after flood waters
swept through the building.
Playgroups, free pensioners' lunches, and sports classes were all
scrapped becauseof the water levels.
The ground floor of the centre, which caters for around 4000 people
every week, was under two feet of water yesterday.
More than 100 children under five who are dropped off for a playgroup
every morning were sent home.
But it is the farmers who face the long-term damage. Mr John Ross,
president of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, toured the
North-east with local office-bearers to assess the damage.
''Some farmers will face substantial financial losses,'' he said. ''We
have contacted the Scottish Office and Brussels -- but it is always
difficult to get weather aid.''
One farmer, Jim Innes of Deskie, Glenlivet, put his losses at #30,000
for 100 acres of barley which should have gone for malting but is now
sprouting in the field. ''We are looking at a 100% loss,'' he said.
The North-east farmers have paid a heavy price this year for being
some weeks behind their southern counterparts in seeing their crop ready
for harvest.
At the Aberdeen Grain Co-operative, managing director Glyn Whitehead
said he was still awaiting significant tonnages of barley, wheat, and
oilseed rape from members.
''It is very disappointing for farmers -- grain is sprouting in the
ear now and I can't see there being any more malting barley,'' he said.
More than a week of non-stop rain has also posed a threat to livestock
and some farmers have seen straw, intended for winter feed or bedding,
swept away by floodwaters.
September has already become the wettest month on record in the
North-east and there is more rain to come.
Mr Douglas Yule, of Weather Watchers, said: ''A low pressure area
hovering over the North Sea is causing all the rain. More than nine
inches have already fallen in many parts so far this month and we should
see more towards the end of the week.''

SCOTLAND'S new local authorities will be put under pressure to refuse
to collect bills for the new water quangos from next April.
The Hands Off Our Water group claims it is already organising a mass
non-payment campaign which will be greater than the one which led to the
end of the poll tax.
In particular, it will be asking Labour-controlled councils to justify
collecting the money for the new water boards, after councillors
boycotted taking positions on the boards.
The three quangos take over Scotland's water and sewerage services in
April. However, the boards are expecting the new councils to collect the
money for the service along with council tax, the method used at
present.
HOW campaigners believe that if the councillors opposed the setting up
of the boards, then they have no justification to become their cash
collectors.
Glasgow Councillor Tommy Sheridan, a leading member of HOW, explained
yesterday: ''Given that local authorities in Scotland are in complete
opposition to these boards, we believe it is encumbent on them to refuse
to either issue bills or collect bills on behalf of these Tory quangos.
''The position is different from the poll tax, where councillors tried
to argue that they had to collect the tax otherwise local authority jobs
and services would be put at risk.
''This would not be the case here, as it would have nothing to do with
local government jobs and services, because the councils would no longer
be responsible for these services.''
In addition, HOW is committed to organising a mass non-payment
campaign, and is holding a conference in Glasgow on Saturday to discuss
how it should work.
Given that many of the people behind HOW were active in the campaign
against the poll tax, the water boards will have to take the threat of
non-payment seriously.
Mr Sheridan emphasised that, despite scare stories to the contrary,
the new water boards would not have the power to disconnect people for
non-payment. Their only remedy would be the normal debt collection
avenues used for the poll tax.
As water bills will be considerably less than poll tax bills, he
believes that many people angry at water services being removed from
democratic control will be willing to refuse to pay.
A separate protest group, the West of Scotland Campaign Against Water
Privatisation, will be demonstrating at Strathclyde Regional Council
today, to demand that the council refuses to assist in the transfer of
assets to the new water quangos.

Labour pledges to fight 'tooth and nail' any attempts to entice more
schools to opt out.
SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth has held a summit with the Prime
Minister to discuss key policy issues in the run-up to the General
Election, including the continuing ''revolution'' in education.
It took place days before Mr Major's speech in Birmingham yesterday
when he announced controversial measures to entice schools in England
and Wales to opt out of local authority control and enable inspectors to
name good and bad teachers.
Although the detail of his speech applied to education south of the
Border it was made clear last night that the thrust of policy would be
the same for Scotland.
A Scottish Office official said last night: ''The Government is
putting in place initiatives to raise quality and standards in education
throughout Britain. The Prime Minister's speech covered some of these
areas.
''Much is also happening in Scotland, although as a result of our
different education system the way in which we secure these improvements
may be different.
''The Secretary of State was able to discuss policy for Scotland with
the Prime Minister last weekend. Meetings planned with education bodies
in the coming weeks will give the Secretary of State the opportunity to
explore the way forward for education in Scotland.''
The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, said last night:
''This policy has been a miserable failure in Scotland and most Tories
admit that there is little or no chance of another school opting out
this side of a General Election. We will be fighting tooth and nail to
ensure that is the case.
''It looks as if they are prepared to throw money at parents and
schools and rig the rules to follow an ideological fixation and that
will make them even more unpopular in Scotland. If they try to change
the legislation, for example by removing the need for ballots, we will
resist that fiercely.''
Mr Forsyth and his Education Minister Raymond Robertson want to inject
life into the Government's stalled opting out strategy in Scotland. It
will be next month before Scotland's second self-governing school comes
into existence.
Mr Major yesterday announced several measures to encourage all state
schools in England and Wales to opt out of local authority control and
become grant-maintained. These include:
* Allowing GM schools to retain the full proceeds from the sale of
property.
* Giving them permission to borrow commercially to finance
improvements.
* Simplifying the rules about the way they are financed and monitored.
* Freeing them from local authority funding formula.
* Giving them greater freedom on admission policies.
Opting out has slowed to a trickle in England and Wales and Mr Major
will hope that these initiatives will give the policy a boost. He
believes opted-out schools have a ''liberating effect'', raising
standards and improving facilities.
Mr Robertson is undertaking a review to establish why opting out has
failed in Scotland. Both he and Mr Forsyth believe that initiatives are
needed to inform parents and communities of the ''benefits'' of
self-governing status.
If they conclude that incentives are needed to attract Scottish
parents then legislative changes will be required.
There will be a Scotland Bill in the Queen's Speech in November which
will include education matters.
In his speech to the Grant-Maintained Schools Foundation, Mr Major
described earlier education reforms as the ''building blocks of a
revolution'' in schools.
Other key elements in his major policy speech included:
* English and Welsh school inspectors being given the power to report
direct to headteachers when they have seen examples of particularly good
or bad teaching.
* The education watchdog Ofsted inspecting the teaching of reading in
the three London boroughs with some of the poorest results.
But Labour said the speech was backward-looking and the unions warned
the opting-out drive was doomed to failure.

THE Highland dentists who founded a private alternative to the
National Health Service have now launched a company aimed at setting up
similar schemes throughout Britain.
Some 58 out of 63 dentists practising in Highland region are now
members of the private, non-profit-making Highland Dental Plan.
The co-operative was set up in 1993 after claiming it was the only way
to ensure a quality of service in the face of Government funding
restrictions.
The dentists, with more than 3000 private patients signed up, now aim
to spread the HDP gospel via an offshoot, IndepenDent.
Details of the firm will be provided at a private presentation to
dentists attending the Scottish Association of Local Dental Committees'
meeting in Bridge of Allan at the weekend.
IndepenDent will offer dentists back-up to set up their own private
practices along HDP lines, including training programmes,
administration, and accident and emergency insurance cover.
An HDP spokesman said that dentists in Scotland, England, and Wales
had expressed a keen interest in the HDP model, adding: ''There are
early signs that many groups want to use this experience, through
IndepenDent, to set up their own schemes.''
HDP was established following controversy over Government changes to
dentists' contracts.
The Highland dentists -- who faced a hostile reception from some
quarters -- argued that preventive care in particular was increasingly
impossible under the ''conveyor belt'' conditions within the NHS.
Many still have NHS patients but they are refusing to take on any new
ones in the profession's continuing dispute with the Government over
fees and working conditions within the public sector.
The group now believes that the time is right for dentists in other
parts of the country to follow their lead because there is a ''wider
acceptance that proper dental care is no longer accessible through the
NHS''.
However, a spokesman for Highland Health Board said that HDP had
''caused problems'' for patients who chose to remain within the NHS or
could not afford to join what he described as ''in effect, a private
insurance scheme''.
The board, with eight dentists and 89,000 NHS customers, was committed
to meeting their needs and to extending available services. It hoped to
take on more dentists and cut waiting times for check-ups.
Mr Mark Gallacher, a Scottish spokesman for the General Dentists
Practioners' Association, conceded it could be argued that private
practices were at the expense of the NHS and were wrong morally.
However, the association was not against the principles behind HDP.
Those involved had joined for positive reasons; they believed dental
services at levels they wanted could not be provided at the prices the
Government paid for them.

A BONE cancer unit made wrong diagnoses on 79 patients, two of whom
had limbs removed, it was revealed yesterday.
The catalogue of blunders was discovered in 1993, after a
nine-year-old boy was found to have undergone months of chemotherapy
needlessly, after being wrongly diagnosed as having cancer.
The final inquiry report into the spate of wrong diagnoses was
published yesterday, more than two years after the first case came to
the attention of hospital managers at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in
Northfield, Birmingham.
A separate report, written by the hospital, said that one wrongly
diagnosed patient had subsequently died, and stated the death ''may have
been avoidable''.
This report, compiled after investigation into 2000 cases, said 18
people had received inappropriate treatment, and estimated that four had
had amputations or suffered ''very significant functional loss''.
The clinician responsible for most of the blunders was Dr Carol
Starkie, who carried out the analysis of bone tumour samples for the
Royal Orthopaedic Hospital.
Dr Starkie, a senior pathologist who worked at Birmingham's Selly Oak
Hospital, was suffering from multiple sclerosis and retired from the
medical profession because of ill-health just one day after the first
blunder came to light.
Dr Jackie Chambers, Birmingham's director of public health, said
management of the pathology services at the specialist unit had been
altered.
Thirteen of the 79 patients were said to have suffered serious and
long-term detriment to their health.
Mr Bryan Stoten, chairman of South Birmingham Health Authority,
confirmed that 53 former patients had made legal claims for
compensation, and said the authority had accepted negligence in relation
to the diagnosis in 15 cases, and reached a financial settlement in one
instance.
He said each case would be treated individually, but expressed his
sympathies to the individuals and families who had been affected by the
scandal.

THE Wylfa nuclear power station on Anglesey could have faced a
catastrophic meltdown and a serious release of radioactive material
because an emergency was not dealt with quickly enough, a court heard
yesterday.
Despite the obvious risk of danger, the No 1 reactor at the atomic
station, operated by Nuclear Electric plc, was not switched off for nine
hours after it was realised that a metal grab -- part of an overhead
crane device used to refuel uranium cylinders -- was missing.
The company, which employs 500 people at Wylfa, admitted four charges
brought under the Health and Safety at Work Act at Mold Crown Court and
will be sentenced today.
Its admission of guilt prompted the Shadow Trade and Industry
Secretary, Mr Jack Cunningham, to say the case offered a stark warning
that commercial pressures appeared to have pushed safety and
accountability down the list of priorities.
''The privatisation of the nuclear electricity generating industry
will exacerbate the conflict between safety, accountability, profits and
dividends,'' he said.
''A Labour government will impose a most rigorous safety regime on any
privatised nuclear industry, but our intention is to campaign against
privatisation.''
The court heard that officials had their ''brains in neutral'' at
Wylfa and in effect put money before safety because they were anxious
not to face penalties from the National Grid by closing one of their two
reactors down.
The chief of Britain's nuclear inspectorate, Dr Sam Harbison, said he
viewed the actions of Nuclear Electric during the incident as ''a matter
of grave concern''.
In a statement read to the court, Dr Harbison said that in his view,
the events were potentially the most serious in the UK during his time
as chief inspector.
''I am particularly concerned about the blatant failure of Nuclear
Electric's safety culture,'' he said.
Despite the fact that the metal grab was missing, the operation of the
reactor was allowed to continue -- a ''severe violation'' of safety
policies.
Failure to act promptly to prevent a possible fuel channel blockage
accident by immediately shutting the reactor down meant that, should
something else have occurred, then there could have been a serious
release of radioactive material.
Mr Hugh Carlisle QC, prosecuting for the Health and Safety Executive,
said the metal grab had fallen into a fuelling channel in the reactor
but there was a reluctance by station officials to assume the worst.
The incident happened in 1993, the year the station received a Royal
Society for the Prevention of Accidents' Gold Award for its safety
record.

TWO women yesterday told a court that two doctors, a man and his wife,
reduced them to a state of terror when they were caught up in an
altercation over the doctors' car which had been boxed in at a car park.
The women were giving evidence in the first day of the trial at
Bearsden and Milngavie District Court of Dr Goran Jamal, 42, who works
as a consultant neurologist at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow,
and his wife, Vian, 33, who is a pathologist at the Royal.
Dr Jamal, of Camstradden Drive West, Bearsden, denies causing a breach
of the peace and vandalism during the alleged incident on October 28
last.
His wife, who faces a charge of breach of the peace, also pled not
guilty.
The court heard how Mrs Pamela Baird, 37, of Morven Road, Bearsden,
was confronted by the Jamals when she returned to her car at 12.15pm at
the Kirklee car park, near Bearsden Cross, after picking up her
four-year-old daughter from playgroup.
Mrs Baird said the Jamals' car, a white BMW, had been boxed in by her
Cavalier and another white BMW. However, both her car and the Jamals'
were legally parked in designated parking bays and the obstruction was
being caused by the third car, Mrs Baird said.
The Jamals were ''very abusive'' even although she pointed out to them
that she was parked in a proper space and not the cause of the
obstruction. They shouted: ''Who do you think you are?'' and would not
listen to reason. They said they had called the police and that she had
not to move her car.
Mrs Baird said: ''Mr Jamal was standing over me all the time in a very
bullying and intimidating fashion. I was in a state of great fear.'' Her
daughter was very upset by the incident.
She got into her car and locked the door. However, Dr Jamal started
banging the windscreen with his hand and it shattered after three or
four blows. ''It was terrifying,'' Mrs Baird said.
She eventually drove off in hysterics and stopped at a nearby shop to
call the police.
Under cross-examination she denied she had trapped Dr Jamal's hand in
the car door. She also denied that he was shouting and banging on the
car because he had been trapped as she drove off.
The court also heard from Mrs Lesley Adey, 31, of Douglas Park
Crescent, Bearsden, who had returned to the car park after picking up
her son.
She said there was shouting and abusive language. She went over and
tried to reason with the Jamals, but things went from bad to worse. He
was shouting: ''She was a f-----g idiot'' and shouldn't be parked there.
''I was worried for Mrs Baird's safety,'' she added.
Mrs Adey said Dr Jamal started banging on Mrs Baird's windscreen with
a clenched fist. ''I was terrified at this point myself,'' she said.
While all this was going on Mrs Jamal was hitting the car bonnet.
''She was very angry, too.''
Cross-examined by solicitor William Macreth, for Dr Jamal, Mrs Adey
said she could not be sure that Mrs Baird had not started the row.
She also dismissed a suggestion that Dr Jamal's hand had got caught in
the doorframe of Mrs Baird's car.
Another witness, Miss Elizabeth Picket, 26, a nanny, of Morano Street,
Glasgow, said she had seen a man stomping about and thumping the bonnet
of Mrs Baird's car. The man, whom she could not recognise in court, had
tried to attack Mrs Adey. ''He sort of lunged for her, but his wife
tried to stop him.''
The trial, before magistrate William Dudgeon, was adjourned until
Monday.

Hurd joins board of NatWest bank
A ROW broke out at Westminster yesterday after it was confirmed that
former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd is to join the main board of the
banking group NatWest from October 10 for #20,000 a year.
Mr Hurd, 65, who retired from the Cabinet in July and is to stand down
as an MP at the next election, will also become deputy chairman of the
group's investment bank NatWest Markets, for which he will be paid an
undisclosed sum.
His appointment follows hard on the heels of the controversy over
former Minister Richard Needham's decision to take up a number of posts
in the business world soon after leaving public office.
It has also reopened the debate about whether the recommendations of
the Nolan Committee into standards in public life are being followed.
Downing Street said the Prime Minister was ''obviously aware'' of the
appointment, but Labour reacted furiously.
City spokesman Alistair Darling said Mr Hurd's decision had driven a
coach and horses through the spirit of the Nolan recommendations.
He said: ''Douglas Hurd is the latest in a long line of Ministers who
are deserting the Cabinet room for the boardroom with indecent haste. We
were told that the Nolan recommendations would put a stop to this
practice. It is now clear that Nolan has changed nothing for the
Conservatives -- it is business as usual.
''The Prime Minister must make a clear statement as to where he stands
on Nolan and explain what he is going to do to reassure an increasingly
sceptical public that there will be a clear interval between departure
from ministerial office and outside employment.''
Labour industry spokesman Brian Wilson said: ''There is a
shamelessness about the desperation of ex-Ministers cashing in on their
public office which the electorate finds highly offensive.
''Mr Hurd will continue to collect an MP's salary until the next
election. What is the big hurry to start picking up directorships? It
demeans the post of Foreign Secretary that he should immediately start
acquiring boardroom jobs on the back of it.''
In a statement, Mr Hurd said: ''I am delighted to have been asked to
join the board of the NatWest group and to have the chance of helping
one of the best-known British banks build up its strengths overseas.
''This will in many ways be a continuation of the work I have done in
Government in promoting British interests abroad.''
He said that although the changes suggested by Lord Nolan to rules
governing Ministers taking up jobs after retirement had not yet come
into effect, he had decided it was sensible to contact Lord Carlisle,
the chairman of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments,
informally.
Mr Hurd said: ''Lord Carlisle has commented that my appointment
appears to meet fully the likely criteria by which any application from
Ministers will be judged.
''He feels sure the committee would have advised me that it was quite
proper to accept the appointment, subject only to the three-month
waiting period proposed by Lord Nolan. I will comply with this
requirement.''
Mr Hurd, who has a young son and a daughter by his second marriage,
received a salary of #67,819 as Foreign Secretary.
He draws an MP's salary, which from January goes up from #33,189 to
#34,085.
Mr Martin Owen, chief executive of NatWest Markets, said: ''We are
committed to developing NatWest Markets as a leading global investment
bank.
''Douglas Hurd's appointment to the new role of deputy chairman is an
important step in achieving this aim.
''His knowledge of world markets and geo-political developments will
be of enormous benefit to our business as we continue to build our
network on a worldwide basis.''
But the Banking, Insurance, and Finance Union moved quickly to urge Mr
Hurd to help stop the threat of further job losses at NatWest, where
thousands of workers have been made redundant over the past five years.
Deputy general secretary Ed Sweeney said: ''There are jobs for the old
boys but job insecurity for staff. We hope Mr Hurd will help remove the
threat of further job losses and branch closures.''
He said 20,000 jobs had been lost at the group since 1990 while a
further 3000 were being lost this year. The group employed 87,400 at the
end of last year.
One City economist said last night that Mr Hurd would not bring any
financial expertise to the bank.
''What he brings is a huge number of contacts with important people,''
said Mr Andrew Milligan, international economist at the Japanese
investment bank New Japan Securities.
''If there is a privatisation, say, in the Czech Republic, he will
probably know a few people.''
''But after the doors have been opened it is up the NatWest
professionals to push the deal through.''
He added: ''A lot of it is prestige. He is very famous and will be
very appealing on the letterheads and at conferences he will be a
crowd-puller.''
''It is down to the bottom line and NatWest obviously feel that the
amount of money they will get out of Mr Hurd is more than what they are
paying him.''
Although the City is unlikely to react with great interest to the
news, some may take it is a further sign that senior Conservatives do
not believe they can win the next election and are seeking another job
now.

Straw denies 'wobble'.
LABOUR'S spokesman on constitutional affairs, Welsh MP Dr Kim Howells,
last night received an unprecedented dressing down by Shadow Home
Secretary Jack Straw for speaking out of turn on Scottish devolution.
''What Kim said was not party policy,'' Mr Straw told The Herald last
night. ''He was, I am afraid, out of order. The position was plainly
spelled out last week by Tony Blair and, for the record, I repeat that
assurance.''
Dr Howells, MP for Pontypridd, and a junior spokesman on Home
Affairs,angered his leadership by reopening the issue of the party's
supposed ''wobbles'' on constitutional change so soon after leader Tony
Blair had gone to such pains to stress his personal commitment to home
rule.
The Welsh MP told The Herald on Monday that change was more of an
issue for the chattering classes than on the doorsteps, equated
nationalism with fascism, and expressed doubt on whether enthusiasm for
constitutional change would survive beyond a General Election victory
for Labour.
He is also believed to be hostile to a Scottish parliament's
tax-varying powers. Although he stressed that he believed both Mr Blair
and Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson would see Labour's
devolution plans through, his apparent personal lack of enthusiasm
brought the sharp rebuke from Mr Straw.
Mr Robertson said last night: ''Jack Straw is Kim's boss. That's it
settled. The issue is over.''
However, the SNP last night called for Dr Howells's sacking, claiming
he was following in the footsteps of his mentor Neil Kinnock, ''the
Welshman who did more than anyone else to scupper the last Labour
government's Scottish and Welsh devolution legislation,'' according to
deputy leader Allan Macartney.
''Tony Blair must repudiate Howells, or stand condemned of complicity
in a long-running and elaborate Labour con-trick.''
Perth and Kinross MP Roseanna Cunningham told the same meeting in
Dundee that Labour was again revealed as untrustworthy, adding: ''By
exposing the inadequacy of devolution, the SNP can build support for our
goal of independence.''
Dr Howells had claimed of devolution: ''It is not an issue, frankly.
In seven years of campaigning I have been asked about it two or three
times on the doorstep, whereas I have faced two or three hundred
questions on education and unemployment.
''It is largely a property of the chattering classes rather than the
ordinary voters.''
Dr Howells's comments were seen as at least a ''wobble'', if not a
clear split in the Labour ranks over the commitment to Scottish
devolution, but yesterday Mr Straw moved to distance himself from his
colleague's remarks. The Welsh MP is likely to be spoken to by Mr Straw,
but whether the matter will go as far as a ''carpeting'' by Mr Blair
remains unclear.
Mr Straw said: ''There is no wobble, and the commitment which Tony
Blair gave last week on revenue-raising powers is agreed and is
absolutely certain.''
Labour has been rumoured for some time to be seeking to tone down its
plans for devolved parliaments or assemblies, and recently was
criticised by a senior party figure for not going far enough with regard
to proposals for increased powers to be given to regional assemblies in
parts of England.
However, Mr Blair moved last week to dispel doubts over his commitment
to devolution, saying: ''I have seen these stories with complete
bemusement. They are total and absolute drivel. My commitment to
Scottish devolution has been a commitment as long as I have been in the
Labour Party.''

Forsyth takes lead in war on dealers
SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday reinforced his law and
order credentials with new tough rules on Temazepam possession and with
a promise of a ban on the sleeping drug's jelly form, measures aimed at
giving front-line policing an extra weapon.
He also told Strathclyde Chief Constable Leslie Sharp and his senior
officers at Paisley that he would seek the assistance of the Lord
Advocate to make the courts and legal profession more user friendly for
witnesses facing intimidation from those accused of drug offences.
Mr Forsyth also told Whitehall that Scotland would go it alone on
Temazepam legislation if the Government was not willing to face down the
drug companies.
The previous Scottish Office team, a Government source says, had not
carried sufficient weight to persuade London Ministries of the need to
control Temazepam, but Mr Forsyth's voice had been heeded. The result
was that the Home Secretary, Mr Michael Howard, yesterday announced
similar controls for the rest of the UK. The measures were yesterday
widely welcomed by doctors, politicians, and front-line drug workers.
From November 1, it will be illegal to possess Temazepam, now the most
widely abused prescription drug in the UK, without a prescription.
Unlawful possession will carry a sentence of up to two years
imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both, giving the police a valuable
and much-needed edge in their attack on drug dealing.
The rescheduling of Temazepam into a higher category will also mean it
must be more securely stored at wholesale premises and pharmacies, and
that import and export licences will be needed.
The Government drew back, however, from making doctors write out
individual prescriptions by hand because 800,000 a year in Scotland
alone would have been needed, and seven million throughout the UK, at a
time when the Government is trying to minimise GPs' paperwork.
The soft, gel-filled Temazepam capsules are called ''jellies'' by drug
abusers. They melt them in microwave ovens and inject the liquid.
The capsules are the subject of a public consultation, but Mr Forsyth
made it clear the ultimate intention was a ban. But GPs' records of
prescription of the rescheduled drug are to be monitored for the
Government by health boards, a measure clearly to restrict prescribing.
Mr Forsyth chose Paisley to make yesterday's announcements in an
effort to help restore the town's image, unfairly tarnished, he said, by
biased media coverage of what was really a nationwide problem.
''This is a serious problem for us,'' Mr Forsyth said.
''Temazepam has a perfectly legitimate therapeutic use to help people
sleep, and we do not want to interfere with the proper use of the drug.
The consultation on our proposal to ban the jellied form from the NHS
altogether finished only last week, and most of the representations
supported our view,'' he said.
Scottish Office statistics showed that 41% of those who admitted
abusing drugs indicated they misused Temazepam, figures which indicated
that misuse of the drug had become a serious social problem. He
dismissed any suggestion that the measures were ''too little, too late''
as cynical, pointing out that a total manufacturing ban would mean many
innocent, decent people being deprived of an excellent sleeping drug,
and that would be going too far.
''There is not a town in Scotland where people do not know about
Temazepam and are not sick and tired of this drug and the violence and
crime associated with it,'' he said.
At Paisley police headquarters, Mr Forsyth heard the history of the
outbreaks of drug-related violence in the town and was shown a
formidable collection of guns being held as evidence in forthcoming
trials.
Detective Superintendent Bill Gordon, head of the local CID, told him
of a wave of witness intimidation which made it nearly impossible for
officers to get the truth about killings and shootings.
Mr Sharp told him there were also problems with the legal profession,
and cited one case where officers visiting a victim in hospital were
threatened by his lawyer with an injunction if they tried to question
his client. Despite offers of rehousing, there was still endemic fear.
''I think the legal system could do a lot to help by making the courts
more hospitable to witnesses, making sure their addresses are kept
unknown, for example. The legal profession should also look at the way
witnessess are treated in the witness box. Lawyers tend to use the very
extremes of the legal system to protect their clients,'' Mr Sharp said.
Mr Forsyth reaffirmed that he wanted the police to have the tools to
tackle the drug dealers and that he would approach the Lord Advocate
with specific ideas from Mr Sharp and his officers.

WHEN you look out across the Firth of Clyde you begin to realise why
foreign folks spend so much money to come here, writes Stewart McIntosh.
We're used to it, and we get it cheap. But those who drive up from the
south or fly in from abroad have a very different outlook. They spend
hundreds of pounds, thousands of dollars, and squillions of roubles to
come here. So it behoves those of us who live in the west of Scotland to
have a good look around us and seriously consider some of the advantages
of living in this part of the world.
Could you possibly rue Rhu? On the east bank of the Gareloch, it is
near the city yet has that unmistakable west coast atmosphere.
Now a major builder is offering to sell some exceptional building
plots near Rhu. Tilbury Douglas Homes is marketing 10 plots on the
shores of the Gareloch, each of which has marvelous views. This a chance
to realise your own dream -- each plot has building consent, so
purchasers can come up with their own ideal home so long as it meets
with the normal building regulations.
Tilbury is offering to support purchasers by helping them to plan the
type of house suitable for each plot. A kit builder can provide an idea
of the price of each completed home. But there is nothing to stop anyone
buying a plot and then building their own dream home -- and some of the
plots are exceptionally large.
''This is a new initiative for Tilbury Douglas -- in fact as we are
aware it is an unusual project for a house builder to be involved in,''
says Jan Jeram of Tilbury Douglas.
''It's a great opportunity for anyone who wants a home built to their
own specification in a wonderful part of Scotland. This is one of those
chances that does not occur very often.''

JUST 55 miles west of Glasgow lies a little paradise. Almost an
island, it is surrounded on three sides by water and of one of
Scotland's most charming coastal villages is its centrepiece. Views to
the west are dominated by the Paps of Jura, rising out of an azure sea
(if the weather is right).
So near, yet the narrow peninsula which lies between Loch Sween and
the Sound of Jura is almost untouched by the tourist industry. That's
because it's so far -- those 55 miles as the crow flies become a snaking
100 miles by car through some of Scotland's most dramatic scenery.
Those of us who know the area around Tayvallich usually try keep the
secret to ourselves, but paradise can only be enjoyed if it is shared --
and there is a clutch of interesting properties available near the
Argyll village at prices from #55,000 upwards.
Just to the south of Tayvallich, Taynish is situated on the end of a
peninsula. Linked to the mainland by a private road, it has the
atmosphere of an island without having to use a boat unless you want to.
The property owns a right of access to the foreshore of Loch Sween
together with the right to use a jetty.
Loch Sween is a spectacular sea loch which opens out into the Sound of
Jura. The area is widely recognised for its exciting sailing with
numerous sea lochs, islands and miles of varied coastline. Tayvallich
itself is a well-known sailing centre, is greatly sought after for its
sheltered moorings, and has a good pub and restaurant serving excellent
local sea food.
Set in five acres of its own grounds, the rest of the peninsula is a
National Nature Reserve owned by Scottish Natural Heritage -- which
guarantees that the peace and natural beauty of the peninsula will not
be compromised. The nearest neighbour is a mile-and-a-half away.
Taynish House is believed to have been built in the first half of the
eighteenth century. The original house was extended in the later half of
the century by adding curved rooms on either end and a curved stairway.
A curved kitchen was added next to the dining room in the early
nineteenth century and the house was repaired after fire damage in 1955.
The result is a traditional Laird's House of with three reception rooms,
two halls, a large kitchen, six bedrooms, and two bathrooms. The house
is listed Category B and is built of harled stone under a part slate and
part shingle roof.
To the side of the house is a large, walled garden and the site of a
former garden cottage. In front of the house is small octagonal
building. Situated below this, out of sight of the house, is a farm
steading with a large barn (which is ruinous) and a range of cattle
courts and a dilapidated cottage.
The property is enclosed within a fence and extends to about five
acres in all.
Since 1957 Taynish House has been a second home used for holidays. It
has been occupied, either by the owners or tenants, from about April
until September annually, but has been empty during the winter months.
''It has been maintained to a perfectly acceptable standard for this
purpose, but is in a generally dilapidated condition with no 'mod
cons','' says the the commendably frank Jamie Macnab of estate agents
Savills. ''Any prospective purchaser contemplating full-time occupancy
should be prepared to consider considerable refurbishment.''
As a result, Savills are asking for offers over #225,000 for Taynish
and its five acres.
Just up the road, a mile or so north of Tayvallich, Scotnish is a
small estate lying on the shore of a sheltered inlet off Loch Sween.
Included in the sale are several lots including Scotnish House, a lodge
cottage, a four-bedroom bungalow and two semi-detached cottages. The
properties have loch frontage and are presently in use as holiday lets.
There is also a large boathouse, a private slipway and a private pier
which is used occasionally by local fishing boats to land their catches.
The present owners accept prawn in lieu of landing fees!
Scotnish House sits high above the Loch and enjoys panoramic views
from its own observatory. Built at the turn of the century, it has two
reception rooms, a kitchen with Aga, seven principal bedrooms and four
secondary bedrooms. It is surrounded and protected by delightful gardens
and grounds extending to about 40 acres.
Scotnish occupies a superb position high above Loch Sween with its
grounds sloping down to the water's edge. Edinburgh-based agents Brodies
are seeking offers over #55,000 for one of the cottages to offers over
#330,000 for Scotnish House and grounds.

THE next few weeks is white-knuckle time for the green-welly set.
Selling a country house during the winter is a bleak prospect. Anyone
wanting to raise cash from their property has to find a buyer before the
clocks change, the leaves falls from the trees and the weather worsens.
Getting a quick sale can depend on a balance of the positive and
negative aspects of your property, according to Colin Strang Steel of
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, estates agents to the gentry. ''Certain assets
always add to the value of a property and make it much easier to sell.
They are usually on the shopping lists of ideals for buyers and in
today's market it is important to buy a house with as few negative
factors as possible,'' he says. He has drawn up a list of positives and
negatives in country houses he has known -- and their impact on selling
prices.
These are the factors that make a house more (or less) desirable than
the one next door or in the village.
Positives include:
* Easy access to main commuting routes adds 15% to the selling value
* Within 20 minutes of good schools adds 15%
* Fashionable village situation adds 10%
* Well-sited and with right amount of land for property size adds 5%
* Good views adds 5%
* Extra accommodation, such as granny flat, adds 5%
* Well decorated and in good structural order adds 5%.
Negatives include:
* Structurally unsound takes 30% to 40% off the value
* Motorway, flightpath, or railway noise -- 20% to 30% off
* Close to industrial or council estate -- 15% to 20% off
* Large house with inadequate land -- 10% to 15% off
* No view -- 10% off
* Overlooked by other property/poor situation -- 10% off
* Poor decorative order -- 10% off
A close look at the list shows that most of a country house's best
assets are tied up with where its is situated. ''It confirms agents'
favourite cliche when advising clients -- look for location, location,
location,'' says Colin Strang Steel. ''But whatever their situation,
sellers should do what they can to make a house sellable -- ensuring
that the property is structurally sound and in good decorative order are
basics. It is not just the value these assets add to the property, but
the way in which they ease and speed up a sale.''

A REVIVAL of gracious Georgian living is gathering steam across
Scotland, as more and more home buyers opt to transform city-centre
office buildings into townhouses.
Traffic and transport headaches have combined with plummeting
commercial property values to make office conversions an appealing
option. And a new tax ruling that lifts VAT on such projects gives
office renovators added financial incentive.
Edinburgh architect Lorn Macneal, who is supervising increasing
numbers of conversions, says buyers are becoming disillusioned with
suburban luxury homes.
''Many of them don't want to face a half-hour drive to get to work in
the morning, and those with young families would rather their children
didn't face drunk drivers and busy roads.
''Buying a city-centre home can solve these problems and often give
you much more space than you'd get elsewhere. It's becoming more and
more common to see full four and five-storey offices converted into
single homes. And most of them will support a separate basement flat for
some bonus income.''
Potential buyers can expect to pay upwards of #250,000 for a
convertible building in a mixed business/residential area -- a
two-thirds reduction from what the same building might have commanded
five years ago. Costs of renovating are likely to exceed #100,000 and
are often double that.
But the new tax break helps keep costs reasonable -- conversion work
is zero-rated for VAT, the equivalent of a 17.5% discount. Planning
permission is usually given far more readily for single-home conversions
than for blocks of flats, as homeowners are less likely to want to
subdivide large rooms.
Solicitor Alastair Strong, of Menzies Dougal in Edinburgh, says office
conversion has been a migratory trend. ''We saw quite a bit of it in
parts of London and it seems to have come north from there. It has
become particularly popular in Edinburgh and Glasgow's Kelvinside and
West End. There are also some smaller opportunities for conversions
further north.
''Potential buyers should take as close a look at their neighbours as
they do at the house. It is much better for property values and for
peace of mind if your commercial neighbours are all on long-term leases.
If they're not, you run the risk of having a tanning salon open up just
after you move in. Surveyors are now beginning to take the neighbours'
leases into account in determining the residential value of a
building.''
City-centre homeowners can enjoy more than convenience, exclusivity
and spacious rooms. According to Terry Levinthal, of the Cockburn
Association, part of Edinburgh's Civic Trust, they can make an
invaluable contribution to the city's atmosphere. ''Have you ever been
in London's City on a February night? It's the most soulless, depressing
place in the world because there's nothing there but empty buildings.
''Having a mixture of residential and business buildings in a city
centre keeps it alive all day and night. It gives it warmth and
variation. In many places the buildings were originally intended as
homes and we feel that's often their most appropriate use. We're often
presented with very crass schemes to convert offices into multiple
flats. Home conversions are typically handled much more sensitively.''

IF you can't afford to live in a grand old house you can do the next
best thing -- live in a converted mansion.
St Margaret's House in Paisley's Brodie Park Crescent was
comprehensively refurbished and restored by Ossian Construction. The
builder worked hard to replicate the original period charm of the
building and there has been extensive use of replacement cornicings,
moulded door facings, skirtings, picture rails and such like.
A ground-floor conversion with two bedrooms is being marketed by
Slater Hogg &amp; Howison.
The impressive communal resident's hallway has natural hardwood
flooring. The apartment offers flexible accommodation which is all on
one level. The specification includes gas central heating with
thermostatic valves on the radiators, a modern fitted kitchen, main
bedroom with en-suite shower room, modern fitted three-piece bathroom,
security alarm system and security controlled main door entrance way.
The lounge has moulded cornicing, a decorative ceiling rose, and a
carved oak fireplace with a slate hearth.
The property has an extensive basement cellar accessed from a hatch in
the cloakroom and there are private parking spaces to the rear of the
building.
Offers over #94,000 are being sought by Slater Hogg &amp; Howison.
