JOHN Little has a point in discussing the often ill-understood north-south
aspect of time zones. Those who cross five 1-hour zones at high speed in flying
from New York to Glasgow may suffer jet lag. Those at the South Pole who walk
round all 24 zones, or through some them, in a few seconds report no adverse
effects.
I am not quite sure what he means by astronomical time. I understand that
observatories either work in universal time (UT), or in local time. That is, an
observatory has a UT clock synchronised with clocks in every other observatory,
so making the earth just one time zone.
In local time Glasgow would be about four minutes later than Edinburgh. That
system abolishes zones (or more correctly creates an infinite number) because
it takes its local noon to be when the sun is due south. That system also
existed 150 years ago when travel was by slow stagecoach.
Trains moving at 60mph made it inconvenient for Glasgow clocks to be different
from those in Edinburgh and they imposed Railway Time that turned the UK into
one time zone. Larger countries like the USA did not always do that and so
there are inconsistencies.
Recently I received a 1996 diary that has a time-zone map of the world. I see
that China from east to west has only one time zone. Just beyond its northern
border, Russia, between the same meridians, seems to need three. Clearly there
will be towns close together in large countries where the zone changes and
there is a difference of one hour in the clocks.
What is the difficulty with Britain having a different time zone from
continental Europe, especially since we have a distinct boundary that does not
produce adjacency disruption?
However, I think it may be an advance to have airline time. Aircraft travel 10
times as fast as trains and so should need bigger zones. It could be an
advantage to have airline time that was the same all over the world. Airports
would have two clocks, airline time and local zone time. From starting the
journey until the destination, airline time would be observed.
There would be no such thing as an international date line so timetables would
be much simpler. Airport notices would advise those leaving the airport other
than by air to adjust their watches to local zone time.

IN your leader headlined Scotland: the way ahead is clear, you state, ``In
assessing the conflicting claims there is one constant, and that is the
importance of the Union for all Scots'' (December 1).
That is the sentence that displays a closed mind. It is the Union that
separates Scots from the oil resources in their waters, the Scots from their
own parliament, and therefore Scotland from direct access to the rest of the
world.
The ending of the Union, which has brought benefits in the past without doubt,
would free Scotland and allow it to prosper and take its rightful place among
the new nations in the world, its future dependent solely on the efforts of its
citizens.

THE Speaker yesterday made a suggestion which could undermine parliamentary
democracy as we know it in this country. Nolan and Scott are small beer
compared with this.
Miss Boothroyd has found as she attends functions around the country and meets
ordinary people - which, in this case, means all those who are not MPs - that
they are ``sick and tired'' with the personal attacks that go on in the Commons.
She thought they were right, and would be looking for exchanges to concentrate
on policies in future.
The goody-goodies and the sycophants gave a little cheer. The rest were silent,
presumably appalled at the prospect of one of the fun bits of being an MP
vanishing.
Nolan is making it more difficult to earn an extra bob or two, and now one
might be prevented from being rude to the other side.
Miss Boothroyd's remarks seemed to come under the heading of an observation
rather than a ruling. However, she already had made a pre-emptive strike.
Mr Don Touhig (Islwyn - Lab.) attacked the Government's plan to develop a
``fast track'' for schools to go on to grant-maintained status. Welsh Education
Minister Rod Richards responded that Mr Touhig's leader already had ensured a
fast track out of Islington local schools for his son to attend a
grant-maintained establishment.
The Speaker told him sharply to answer the question and not attack another
Member. Some Tories exchanged startled glances. Mr Blair's perfectly legitimate
decision to put his son's educational interests first had seemed to them a
useful illustration of the difference between policy and practice which they
discerned in Labour.
It might be argued that it is not so much the invective as its quality that is
turning off those citizens Madam Speaker meets.
Disraeli's calling the entire Treasury bench ``exhausted volcanoes'', Churchill
describing Ramsay MacDonald as the ``boneless wonder'', Denis Healey describing
a Geoffrey Howe attack on him as like ``being savaged by a dead sheep'' - are
these and other jewels in the crown of parliamentary debate to be banished?
Their like have admittedly temporarily disappeared.
Is this intervention from the chair to leave us with nothing but talk like
yesterday's ``outward divestment'' from Mr Paul Flynn (Newport West - Lab.),
meaning firms and jobs leaving an area.
Mr John Butterfill (Bournemouth West - Con.) rose to seek the Speaker's help.
His intention to bring in a summertime Bill has brought him such a heavy
postbag that he cannot cope. Bodies supporting his Bill have offered him
secretarial help. But would he be caught by the new Nolan rules and be regarded
as their paid advocate if he accepted and perhaps not be allowed to proceed
with his Bill?
The Speaker said that this was a grey area and she could not anticipate what a
committee which has yet to buckle down to clarifying matters might decide.
Mr Dennis Skinner (Bolsover - Lab.), a man whose name springs to mind when
parliamentary rudery is mentioned, suggested that if Mr Butterfill did not have
enough time to deal with his postbag he ``should pack in those moonlighting
jobs he has got''. Mr Butterfill grinned, the Speaker decided that did not
constitute a personal attack and we moved into the Budget debate and the new
era of politeness to all.

n A RATHER self-admiring article in new intellectuals' magazine Prospect
informs us that the Russian Playboy is going great guns, introducing
sophistication, argument, and the most restrained of nudity into a hitherto
rather trashy market. After all, Cindy Crawford on the cover of issue two is
actually concealing her breasts with her hands, rather a vogue among American
superstars at the moment (for example Demi Moore and Janet Jackson).
One Russian author not so far tempted to contribute to the magazine is
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, perhaps put off by the publications which share the top
shelf with Playboy; SPID-Info, for example (or Aids-Info), evolved very quickly
from a sort of public service publication to an extended Readers' Wives and
letters forum covering everything from incest to shepherd dogs, it says here.
Women make up one-quarter of the Russian Playboy's readership, the highest of
all the world's Playboys, apparently, which editor Artyom Troitsky puts down to
having ditched the traditional Entertainment for Men slogan in favour of Food
for Thought - and Fun for All. Here's hoping they weren't expecting recipes
inside, then.
n AND, from Prospect again, come Hillary Clinton's reflections on 20 years of
marriage to Bill. He proposed more than once, it seems (she was initially
reluctant to marry a man who was ``going to build his life in Arkansas'' - boy,
was she wrong, or boy, did she get to work on him), but what finally swung it
was the house he bought as a surprise for her - it was ``only 1000 sq ft and
had no air-conditioning, but it did have a big attic fan, a screened-in porch,
a living-room with a beamed cathedral ceiling, a fireplace, and a big bay
window''. Nice to know romance isn't dead and that the Clintons ``love each
other more now than when we married''. One thousand square feet, for all you
cynics, is about the size of a one-bedroom tenement flat.
n HAPPY 10th birthday to the San Jai project, set up in Garnethill, Glasgow, to
advise and counsel immigrant Chinese families, organise social events, and
bring awareness of a different culture to the new country. Latterly it has
worked on domestic violence, family breakdown, and opportunities for Chinese
children.
Andrew, 14, says they supported him with problems he could not talk through at
home, a service many second-generation children would appreciate. ``I have also
been able to relax there as all the people at the project can understand what
it's like growing up in Scotland as a member of a Chinese family.'' Many happy
returns.
n IT'S not the kids who spend too much time gazing into computer screens; it's
their mums, according to a survey by US company CompuServe Inc, which provides
on-line services such as tax guidance to more than 3.6 million subscribers.
Women in the survey were likely to be college graduates, married, aged 35 to
54, and with a household income of $70,000, and spent more than half their
eight hours of free time each week gazing through the on-line services.
Far from indicating a generation of go-getting hot computer mamas, however, the
women were looking for information which would help their children and their
families, especially as the majority of them had the job of sorting out the
family finances. Perhaps Pop was too busy watching the ball game; plus ca
change . . .
n CHRISTMAS requests from readers of Gardening Which? December issue range from
the ambitious (a brand-new garden!) through the down-to-earth (a bag of
manure), to the very stuff of dreams itself (a handsome young gardener). Only
one hopeful correspondent wrote in with this suggestion. The most popular gift
choice was garden-centre gift vouchers, no doubt nestling alongside those
luxurious handkerchiefs in the Christmas stocking.
n AND in case all this talk of Christmas seems a bit previous, Easter is upon
us already; Nestle Rowntree has already announced that the theme of its 1996
Easter range will be more choice - the range will include a staggering 33
different sorts of egg, including the new After Eight, Matchmakers, and Aero
egg. Kids' favourite last year was the Smarties egg, says Nestle.
n BOOTS is hiring out TENS machines for women who want to try alternative pain
relief during labour. BabiTENS will cost #23.50 per calender month, and should
be picked up two weeks before your due date, available in major stores
throughout Scotland.

New York
ANNE SCHEIBER retired as a US government auditor during the Second World War,
bitter about never having been promoted.
Living frugally and investing wisely, she built her $5000 savings into a stock
portfolio valued at her death this year at $22m (#14m). Her last act was to
bequeath the fortune to New York's Yeshiva University to help women overcome
discrimination.
``Elation would be an understatement,'' said Dr Norman Lamm, Yeshiva's
president.
College administrators had never heard of the benefactor, who lived as a
recluse until her death in January aged 101.
Scheiber's gift was born of bitterness, her lawyer said, because she felt that
despite having a law degree she was held back for 23 years at the Internal
Revenue Service simply because she was a woman. She retired in 1944.
``This grew on her year after year,'' attorney Benjamin Clark said. ``She was
very much embittered while employed at the IRS.''
Clark, who met Scheiber in the mid-1950s, said she lived alone for decades.
``She was the loneliest person. I never saw her smile,'' he said. ``She was
very distrustful . . . she didn't want anybody to know what she had.''-AP.

Grozny
A POWERFUL car bomb killed at least a dozen people in the capital of Russia's
rebel Chechnya region ahead of parliamentary elections later this month.
Many fear the attack may be the start of a spiral of violence in the run-up to
the polls.
The bomb ripped a big crater in a street outside the offices of the Russian
regional administration in central Grozny.
One of the victims, an elderly woman, was hurled against the wall of a
neighbouring building by the blast, eyewitnesses said. Russian officials said
children were among the victims of the explosion, the biggest for months.
Some sources said as many as 18 people were killed, but estimates varied
because local people had hurriedly removed the bodies to bury them before
sunset, in line with local Muslim tradition. Up to 60 people were believed to
have been hurt.
``The aim of the terrorist act was to scare the people of the republic in the
run-up to the elections,'' Russian State Television said, quoting a statement
by the Moscow-backed Grozny government, whose offices were badly damaged in the
blast.
Russian television said a column of troops was ambushed on its way out of the
region last week and the Moscow-installed leader of Chechnya Doku Zavgayev,
escaped with minor injuries when his motorcade was attacked in Grozny last
month.
Moscow is making preparations for Chechnya to take part in a Russia-wide
parliamentary poll on December 17 and also to vote for a new leader for the
war-torn region.
Some ordinary Chechens have already said they will not go to the ballot box
because they are afraid both of rebels, who still control big pockets of the
region, and patrols of heavily-armed Russian troops.
Several candidates have put their names forward for the Chechen leadership
poll, but rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, hiding out in the towering mountains
to the south of the tiny North Caucacus region, has condemned the election as
illegal.
His supporters say the presence of Russian troops, who flooded into the region
one year ago to try to stop it splitting from Moscow, means the poll cannot be
fair.
They have threatened to disrupt voting which they say is a provocative attempt
to spark a civil war.
Police sealed off the bomb-wrecked area of Grozny and used sniffer-dogs to make
sure there were no more explosives amid the rubble of twisted cars and
shattered glass, bricks and metal from neighbouring buildings.
``This act against the peaceful population, victimising women and children,
cannot be justified,'' said Oleg Lobov, Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
representative in Chechnya.
``The murderers will have to answer before the law,'' he said in a statement
carried by Itar-Tass news agency.
Russian officials have predicted a surge in violence in the run-up to the poll
but have dismissed suggestions that they should be cancelled owing to security
risks in the republic, where a five-month ceasefire is hanging by a
thread.-Reuter

FOREIGN Secretary Malcolm Rifkind tonight welcomed a ``tightening of the
screw'' by European governments against the dictatorship in Nigeria.
He was speaking in Brussels after EU foreign ministers extended their protest
against the executions of author Ken Saro-wiwa and eight other human rights
activists by cutting off all formal sporting contacts with Nigeria.
The ministers also decided to expel Nigerian military personnel from the
regime's embassies in EU capitals, withdrawal their own military staff from
member state embassies in Lagos and widen existing visa restrictions to include
all civilians deemed to be in contact with the regime of General Sani Abacha.
Mr Rifkind told a news conference: ``This is a further tightening of the screw
against the Nigerian regime.''
He said the new measures were intended to be a ``clear indication'' to the
regime that the EU expected steps to be taken to restore democracy and human
rights.
EU governments have already banned arms sales to Nigeria and clamped down on
visas for officials linked to the regime.
However today they again stopped short of freezing Nigerian assets in Europe or
imposing an oil embargo - both measures considered impractical without wider
backing through the United Nations Security Council.
Such sanctions would in any case require evidence of a threat to international
stability - and another stumbling block is that Nigeria itself is currently a
member of the Security Council.
Mr Rifkind explained that the move to end formal sporting contacts would
prevent national sports teams from the member states going to Nigeria or
receiving visiting teams from the country.
Meanwhile, Immigration Minister Ann Widdecombe defended plans to send back to
Nigeria democracy activist Abiodun Igbiuidu, who claims he faces persecution
and torture at home.
Mr Igbiuidu, a member of the Campaign for Democracy in Nigeria, had his
application for asylum refused and his case is now undergoing judicial review.
If that fails, he will be deported to Nigeria next weekend.
Miss Widdecombe said his claim had been thoroughly examined by the Home Office
and an independent adjudicator.
``He has lost his appeal. Therefore I feel we have no option but to deport
him,'' she said.
Claude Moraes, of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: ``We
don't believe Mr Igbiuidu's case has been looked at objectively.
``We believe that in view of the recent executions of opponents of the Nigerian
government, he may be in physical danger should he be sent back.''

Srinagar
TWO Britons and a German held hostage by the shadowy Al-Faran militant group in
Kashmir entered their sixth month in captivity today with no sign of an end to
the crisis.
``We have been appealing to the abductors to release the hostages before
Christmas, but it is all in their hands. They have not made contact with the
government for the last week,'' said government spokesman K B Jandial.
This is by far the longest hostage crisis involving foreigners in Kashmir. Two
Swedish engineers working on a power project in the valley spent 97 days held
by the Muslim Janbaz Force in 1991 before escaping.
Britons Paul Wells and Keith Mangan and American Donald Hutchings were
kidnapped on July 4 along with American John Childs, who escaped. Dirk Hasert
of Germany was taken hostage four days later.
Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe, also kidnapped on July 8, was found beheaded
on August 13.
The Western tourists are known to have suffered stomach and eye ailments, and
Hutchings is believed to have frostbitten feet.
Al-Faran, unknown before the kidnappings, has demanded the release of 15 jailed
separatists. India has refused to bow to the militants' demand and has ruled
out a rescue operation for fear the hostages might be killed.
Al-Faran broke off contact with Indian authorities several times after weeks of
fruitless negotiations. The longest gap was 52 days before November 9.
On Saturday Al-Faran asked the All Parties Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference, a
political umbrella group of separatist organisations in Kashmir, to mediate in
the crisis.
The Hurriyat Conference turned down the plea and reiterated its appeal for the
unconditional release of the hostages.
The four Westerners have been periodically sighted by Kashmiris as the
abductors lead them through isolated villages and were last sighted a week
ago.-Reuter.

You have to hand it to President Clinton for the panache, tact, empathy, and
political sophistication of his visit to Britain and Ireland.
He was alert to all the sensitivities and did not make a false step. In
Northern Ireland that was a triumph in itself.
The president's tour de force has left a deep impression on the public mind in
these islands. His carefully balanced words to the people of Northern Ireland
were much more acceptable to everyone than the nationalist bias which has
coloured some of his administration's attitudes and antagonised Ulster's
Unionist majority.
Does the visit mark a shift in the US stance on the peace process? Has the
White House started listening to Whitehall as much as to Dublin?
It will be a long tramp still to a peaceful settlement of our differences in
Ireland. In this year, though, when the 50th anniversary of the end of the
Second World War was commemorated in London, Washington, Belfast, and Dublin,
the President's visit symbolises the shared heritage of the peoples of Britain,
Ireland, and the United States.
Together we have unequalled potential for peace, stability, and democracy in
the world when we unite in friendship for a common purpose.

WHY do politicians and others assume that everyone in Scotland longs for a
Scottish parliament? This assumption is very far from the truth, as a
referendum would prove.
I belong to the Orkney Islands which until 1468 were part of Norway;
history-conscious Orcadians certainly have no wish to be dominated once more by
the Scots.
In spite of the safeguards specified in the Deed of Impignoration (1611) our
native rights were filched away, our language (the Norn) was abolished, and we
were reduced to penury and slavery.
In the words of a distinguished Orcadian historian: ``Right down to the Union
with England (1707) Scottish dominion could only be regarded as a curse''.
The long years of oppression had eventually broken the spirit of the islanders,
and, though our links with Norway are still strong, our loyalty to the British
crown is not in doubt.
That any sensible person should wish to be governed in any way by the
quarrelsome Scots beggars belief (witness the recent illegal shenanigans of
postal workers in both East and West); for, in the event of a Scottish
parliament, overwhelming power would be wielded by the Central Belt.
What has happened to the old truism, ``United we stand, divided we fall''?

ABOUT 60 of 78 passengers and crew were killed when a Cameroon airliner crashed
into a mangrove swamp as it attempted to land in the Central African country's
commercial capital, Douala.
The Boeing 737 was on a scheduled flight from the city of Cotonou in Benin,
which has been playing host to heads of state at a summit of 47 French speaking
countries.
The meeting ended today and dignitaries from the summit were said to be on the
doomed flight.
Most of the passengers were from Cameroon but there were also said to be a
number of Europeans and other West Africans on the flight.
Fishermen in dugout canoes were the first to reach the wreckage of the Boeing,
which came down in the swamp in pitch darkness last night, complicating rescue
efforts.
``Rescuers, essentially fishermen, did not reach the disaster site until an
hour after the crash,'' said an airline official.
The army, joining the rescue effort, pulled out six people alive, among them
the pilot, co-pilot, and a stewardess. Several people were still unaccounted
for.
Five of the survivors, including the stewardess, were taken in critical
condition to local clinics.
A privately-owned helicopter hovered above the crash site about two miles from
the runway, directing a beam of light over the swamp to help rescuers.
The cause of the crash was not immediately known but airport officials said the
pilot first tried to land then aborted the attempt, apparently owing to
problems with the undercarriage.-Reuter.

PROPOSALS for taking the law on the management of wild deer in Scotland forward
to the next century were given their second reading in the Lords yesterday.
The Deer (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill gives revised powers to the Deer
Commission for Scotland - a new name for the Red Deer Commission - and widens
its scope to control marauding deer to cover serious damage to the natural
heritage and threats to public safety.
The commission will be empowered to authorise out-of-season shooting in certain
circumstances.
Scottish Office Minister the Earl of Lindsay, who insisted that welfare was
central to the Bill, said: ``Deer are our largest wild land mammal and there
are no natural predators. They therefore need effective management to allow
them to live in harmony with their habitat and other land uses.''
There are some concerns on the Tory benches and elsewhere about the powers
being given to the new commission.
For Labour, Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove said everyone accepted that
something had to be done but there was uncertainty over whether the Government
had managed to get the balance right.

PRIME Minister John Major was facing growing pressure last night to limit the
Princess of Wales to a charity role on the world stage.
Influential back bench MPs were showing a wariness bordering on hostility -
believed to be reflected in the Cabinet - to the princess's wish to become a
roving ambassador.
The role of the Princess of Wales is expected to be high on the agenda at this
evening's routine weekly meeting between the Queen and Mr Major.
Buckingham Palace and Downing Street were sticking yesterday to the strict rule
of silence governing all palace audiences, but MPs believed it was
inconceivable that the issue would not arise.
Back benchers were swift to demand a strict limit on the official role for
Diana sanctioned by the Government.

the princess's ambassadorial skills.
``It really is not enough just to smile at people and pat them on the head,''
she said.
``I am quite sure she has a talent to comfort people and make them feel better,
but if you are going to be a diplomat, you have got to have many years of
experience.
``Diplomatic relations can be extremely delicate. It is extremely easy to
offend when you don't mean to, to say the wrong thing when you don't mean to.''
Mr Bill Walker, a senior Tory MP, said: ``Her first duty should be to her
children. A woman should be looking after her children's interests. I don't
think enough attention has been paid to their needs.''
The Southend-east MP, Sir Teddy Taylor, was one of the few MPs prepared to come
to Diana's defence.
``She can achieve friendship and understanding with foreign leaders without
getting involved in politics,'' he said. ``It would be very sad if that great
asset was to be lost.''
The princess expressed her desire to be a ``queen of  hearts'' among ordinary
people as well as an ambassador at large during her astonishing BBC TV
interview two weeks ago which laid bare the painful details of her marriage
break-up.
Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay plans to table a series of questions asking Mr Major
to clarify the princess's future role.
He said: ``We have a right to know what is going on. I am considering raising
the issue with Mr Major in the Commons at Question Time tomorrow.''

TWO winners in succession yesterday lit up the gloom for Susan Bradburne at
Edinburgh when Charming Gale and Blue Charm completed a 38-1 double.
These successes ended a lean spell for the Fife trainer. In all it was a great
afternoon for ``the kingdom' with Rocket Run winning for the second time in
seven days, giving Kinross-based Lucinda Russell another success.
Her Fiveleigh Builds, who has won twice, was sent off 6-5 favourite to take the
feature chase. Andrew Thornton took him into an early lead which the the pair
maintained until blundering six out. Charming Gale, always up with the leaders,
was left in front and stayed on to win by six lengths.
Bradburne acknowledged the luck had gone her way, but also praised conditional
jockey Andrew Watt.
Blue Charm completed the double for the Cupar yard when Tim Reed brought the
five-year-old with a run in the home straight to win the Levy Board Hurdle by
five lengths from Triennium.
Wills Telmar, odds-on for the Lasswade Chase, blundering and unseating his
rider when about to make his challenge. Rocket Run led all the way to give
Russell her sixth winner in her first season.

THE Government yesterday rejected a call by doctors' leaders to cut the
drink-driving limit by almost half.
The British Medical Association had written to Transport Secretary Sir George
Young calling for the alcohol limit to be reduced from 80mg per 100ml of blood
to 50mg. This would bring Britain into line with other European countries and
greatly reduce the risk of accidents, the BMA said.
However, while the Government turned down the BMA, its stance was welcomed by
the traffic standing committee of the Association of Chief Police Officers in
Scotland (Acpos), which announced that breath-testing this year is up by 26%
for the first 10 days of the Scottish police forces' drink-driving campaign.
The association said that 15,255 motorists had been breath-tested compared with
12,024 last year. Of this number, 317 had given positive tests compared with
295 last year. The positive breath tests represented 2.07% of motorists stopped.
Speaking the day before the Government launches its #1m Christmas
anti-drink-drive campaign, Transport Minister Steven Norris said the public
accepted the present limit.
He said: ``There is no point in setting the (drink-drive) limit at zero or any
other figure if in the end people simply ignore it.
``Eighty milligrams is the kind of level people accept. They think it's
sensible. At that level, we have the best drink-drive record in the Western
world.
``There isn't actually any link between the actual legal limit and the number
of drink-related deaths in some countries in western Europe.''
Former Tory Roads Minister Peter Bottomley, MP for Eltham, said drink-driving
had been cut to probably the lowest level in the Western world.
``This has not happened because of a change in the law. Drink-driving has been
reduced, especially among young men, because of a change of culture.
``To save the remaining 500 lives lost each year through drink driving - down
from 1800 in 1978 - we all need to offer alcohol-free drinks to drivers, make
sure that as passengers we choose alcohol-free drivers, and that as drivers, we
decide in advance whether we are driving or drinking.''
The call to cut the limit was made jointly by the BMA and the Parliamentary
Advisory Council for Transport Safety (Pacts), a cross-party road safety
pressure group.
In their letter to Sir George Young, the BMA and Pacts said: ``Research
evidence indicates that the relative risk of driver involvement in road traffic
accidents is increased significantly at a blood alcohol level of 50mg/100ml.''
A BMA spokeswoman said: ``We are not trying to ruin people's fun, but being
killed by a drunk driver can also wreck your Christmas cheer.
``All the evidence suggests that reducing the alcohol limit would make a big
difference to the number of fatalities and injuries.''
The BMA was supported yesterday by Mr Ian Mackinnon, Acpos traffic secretary
and assistant chief constable (traffic) in Strathclyde. He said: ``The
committee is pleased to note the stance taken by the BMA in calling for a
lowering of the limit.''
Last week, Acpos called for a lowering of the blood/alcohol limit to 50 at the
launch of the 1995/96 Scottish police forces' festive drink-driving campaign.
Police chiefs in Scotland said the reduction would have prevented 213 serious
accidents and saved #183m in Scotland between 1988 and 1993.
Meanwhile, police in Strathclyde have breath-tested almost 10,000 drivers in
the first 10 days of this year's campaign. There were 129 positive tests
compared with 115 last year.
A police squad has carried out 3100 tests since it went into operation on
November 27 and, so far, a total of five drivers have been found positive.
``Of the five who proved positive, all were tested between 8am and 10am,'' said
officer in charge, Inspector John Fenemore. ``This underlines our warning to
people about the morning-after effect - that is, the danger of driving the
morning after a night of drinking alcohol.''
q A survey yesterday showed that Britain's roads were among the safest in the
world, with the number of cars increasing but deaths from accidents falling.
From the mechanical breakdown insurance company Warranty Holdings, the survey
showed that Britain had 6.7 road deaths per 100,000 population, compared with
Portugal, the least safe country, which had 33 per 100,000.
q Owners of new vehicles will be given more flexibility in deciding the date of
the first MOT test, under plans laid before Parliament yesterday.
The proposals will allow owners to have their vehicles tested up to one month
before the third anniversary of a vehicle's first registration.
The plans will remove the need for owners to apply on the anniversary of the
vehicle's registration to avoid being penalised.

UN urged to end
Rwanda mission
UNITED NATIONS: Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has proposed that the
UN pull out its 2100 troops and observers in Rwanda later this week because the
Kigali government no longer wanted them.
The government had claimed the Unamir mission ``does not serve the real needs
of Rwanda'' and it could not remain without its consent, he reported. The
mandate of the Unamir mission ends on Friday. It was not certain whether the
Security Council would accept his advice as donor nations, troops contributors,
relief agencies and Rwanda's neighbours want Unamir to stay.
King has stroke
WASHINGTON: King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has suffered a stroke and has had
treatment from a specially flown-in US medical team, US officials said. The
72-year-old monarch was said to have been partially paralysed but was ``doing
well''.
Coach guilty
STUTTGART: Czech-born figure skating coach Karel Fajfr was yesterday given a
two-year suspended sentence for sexually abusing one teenage female skater in
his care and beating another.
Mandela is Santa
PRETORIA: Greenland has awarded South African President Nelson Mandela the
title of International Santa Claus of the Year, for his work on behalf of
children. Prime Minister Lars Emil Johansen unveiled a life-size sculpture of a
smiling Mandela in a red and white fur-lined Father Christmas costume. His
President's Children's Trust will receive the #60,000 prize money.
Islanders flee
PLYMOUTH: Government offices moved to the north end Montserrat yesterday and
many children were let out of school a week early as the island's volcano
continued to rumble. About 4000 residents from the island's southern end
settled into temporary quarters to the north in the second big evacuation since
Chances Peak roared back into life in July after 100 years.
Raiders strike
NAIROBI: Bands of armed attackers killed 18 people and drove off more than
40,000 animals in raids on three remote villages of northern Kenya, according
to police and a local MP. About 4000 raiders reportedly took part in the attack
in Turkana district.
Frying tonight
NEW DELHI: The Delhi High court allowed Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) to reopen
its New Delhi outlet yesterday, quashing an closure order imposed on the
American fast food chain by the city's municipal corporation. KFC has been
targeted by the country's main Hindu opposition party, which opposes opening up
the Indian market to foreign consumer goods.
Sex slave plea
SEOUL: At least 1000 nuns marched to the Japanese embassy in the South Korean
capital Seoul yesterday to protest against Tokyo's refusal to apologise
formally to women forced to serve as sex slaves during the Second World War.
The group demanded Japan pay compensation to those victims still alive.
Deadly flood
GRENOBLE: A teacher was drowned, four children were missing, and two children
were injured after a river suddenly flooded in the French Alps. The children
from a boarding school in Grenoble were on a nature-study trip walking on the
bed of the Drac river when its level rose, apparently owing to release of water
from a hydro-electric dam.
Crib record bid
STOCKHOLM: The small southern Swedish town of Nybro is trying to build the

A YEAR ago the people of Norway voted to remain independent and retain control
of natural resources like oil and fish. Before the November 1994 referendum
supporters of EU membership warned that rejection would result in a disastrous
exodus of businesses seeking re-location in EU countries.
Although none of the four main parties here advocates full Scottish
independence on the model of Norway or Iceland, it would be helpful if Scottish
electors could be told if any major companies have moved out of Norway since
November 1994, or if any are currently planning to move.

A MAN with what turned out to be a fake gun took a classroom of children
hostage at a Paris primary school yesterday before surrendering to police after
a two-hour siege.
All the youngsters were freed unscathed, a police chief said.
The man, in his 30s and armed with a fake pistol, was ``someone who simply
wanted to make himself seen and heard'', he said.
``Negotiations took place with the individual and he gave himself up. There was
no use of force.''
The man rang the doorbell at Louis Aragon school in the north-west Paris suburb
of Clichy, put his gun to the woman caretaker's head, and took 30 children and
their teacher hostage just as the school day was about to end.
Jessica Adigery, a six-year-old pupil, said: ``He came into the classroom and
told us to stick our hands up. Then he said to put our hands on our heads. Then
he said to put our hands down and get on with our work.''
Police said the attacker freed seven of the children after 75 minutes, and
negotiators began talking to him while police commandos took up positions
around the school. ``He released the children in good condition. The teacher
managed the situation very well. It's a happy end after a big fright,'' said
the spokesman.-Reuter.

A FIREMAN died yesterday after an attempt to rescue two workmen from a huge
silo of chemical dust went wrong.
The accident happened as a team of firefighters fought to free the workers from
the 40ft-high silo at Perth harbour yesterday morning.
Fireman Roderick Nicholson, 43, became trapped himself amid five tonnes of
sodium carbonate ash - described as similar to quicksand - and died at Perth
Royal Infirmary.
The firemaster of Tayside, Mr Derek Marr, said last night his officer had made
``the ultimate sacrifice''. His death is understood to be the force's first
fatality on active duty in the last three decades.
More than 30 firefighters from Dundee, Perth, and Coupar Angus arrived at the
Shore Road site occupied by Daltrade, after reports that the two workers had
become engulfed in the ash.
It was not clear last night why they had entered the silo. The ash, which is
used in the glass and textile industries, is not toxic but has irritant
qualities.
The only access to the silo is from a small inspection hatch in the top.
Firefighters climbed down an internal ladder and used ropes to reach the men,
while cutting equipment was used in an effort to drain the container from its
base.
Both workmen, Mr Alistair Lockhart, 54, from Aberuthven, and Mr Paul Martin,
22, from Perth, were eventually lifted free within two hours of the rescue
beginning. They were taken to hospital after receiving medical treatment at the
scene. Their injuries were last night understood to be serious but not
life-threatening.
Firemaster Marr said Mr Nicholson had been instrumental in the rescue of the
two men but the officer, who was wearing breathing apparatus, was sucked into
the ash and became submerged before his colleagues could pull him free.
He said the team had been forced to work under the most difficult and trying
conditions. He described the inside of the silo as extremely claustrophobic,
clouded by dust, and with temperatures at levels which most people would be
unable to bear.
``We understand at the end of the day he had to be dug out and pulled out by
his colleagues. That is the most harrowing of tasks for officers to be forced
to face the rescue of a colleague.
``I can only commend the courage of the officer concerned who had gone into the
silo to try to help members of the public.
``That officer has lost his life though his brave actions. There is no praise
high enough for an officer who is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.''
He said fire crews were ``stunned and shocked'' and added: ``They've lost a
good friend and colleague.......an officer who was prepared to lay down his
life for others.''
Mr Nicholson, from Scone, who is survived by his wife, Yvonne, and a young
child, had been with the force for more than 20 years.
Officials from the Health and Safety Executive were last night at the harbour
site. A fatal accident inquiry is almost certain to be held.
Management at Daltrade, a chemical supply company, refused to comment on the
accident.

Brussels
OPPOSITION Euro-MPs rounded on the Scottish Office last night when it was
disclosed that Scottish fish farmers were left to rely on the Irish and other
governments for EU help in the salmon war with Norway.
The Irish, supported by the French, Swedes, and Finns, have taken the lead in
formally requesting European Commission intervention against alleged dumping of
salmon by the huge Norwegian fish farming industry.
The Scottish Office - representing 5000 workers in a struggling industry worth
#250m a year in sales - has so far declined to make a formal request for help
from Brussels. ``We are considering our position,'' a spokesman said last
night. ``We have been in very close touch with the industry and we are closely
monitoring the situation.''
The Commission will not act in the absence of an official request from a member
state. An Irish Government spokesman said last night: ``We have sent in a
letter asking for urgent action. It is a formal request.''
The Irish Government also led the way at talks with the Commission last week
when a Scottish Office official was stranded at home by an airline strike.
Irish officials have complained privately at a lack of support from the UK.
Dr Allan Macartney, SNP fisheries spokesman in the European Parliament,
denounced the Scottish Office's approach. ``Three cheers for the Irish,'' he
said. ``Why are our people not taking similar action?''
Labour's fisheries spokesman, Mr Hugh McMahon, said: ``I can't understand why
the Scottish Office is not being more aggressive about this. They should be in
there punching their weight.''

INJURIES to Stirling County's two capped backs, Ian Jardine and Kenny Logan,
have forced Glasgow to make further changes for the inter-district championship
match against North and Midlands at Beveridge Park, Kirkcaldy, tomorrow.
Jardine has a neck strain, an injury that prevented him from playing for
Stirling in the premiership match against Boroughmuir last Saturday at
Bridgehaugh, and Logan injured a knee in that match, while he was playing at
full back instead of his international position on the left wing.
The place at centre has gone to Tim Sanderson, a district newcomer from GHK.
Logan is replaced on the left wing by his Stirling colleague, Angus Turner, who
has had 13 previous games for Glasgow.
Sanderson is the third newcomer in the team, joining his former Old Anniesland
colleague, Iain Sinclair, the 19-year-old wing forward who is now with
Watsonians, and Guy Perrett, the 20-year-old West of Scotland lock forward.
Chris Simmers, the Edinburgh Academical centre who was omitted from the
district team after the 21-7 win over South African province Griqualand West at
Hughenden three weeks ago, has voluntarily dropped out of Glasgow's squad and
has thrown his lot in with Edinburgh. Glasgow's team is now:
C Sangster (Stirling County); T Mathewson (Glasgow Academicals), T Sanderson
(GHK), A Garry (Watsonians), A Turner (Stirling County); C MacGregor (Glasgow
Academicals), C Little (GHK); J Gibson (Stirling County), G Bulloch (West of
Scotland), G McIlwham (GHK), M Norval (Stirling County), G Perrett (West of
Scotland), F Wallace (Boroughmuir), captain, M Begley (Glasgow Academicals), I
Sinclair (Watsonians). Replacements - H Bassi (GHK), J McLeod (GHK), F Stott
(West of Scotland), J Brough (Stirling County), G Doran (Glasgow Academicals),
C Docherty (GHK).
q EDINBURGH were due to select their side last night to play the Scottish
Exiles at Richmond tomorrow.
The Exiles, however, have already made their choice on the side which kicks off
their title defence. Team:
G Fraser (London Scottish); M Dods (Northampton), A James (Wasps), R Eriksson
(London Scottish), G Smith (Orrell); S Laing (Instonians), D Patterson (West
Hartlepool); D Hilton (Bath), M Scott (Orrell), P Burnell (London Scottish), A
Nesbit (London Scottish), K Stewart (Cardiff), D Blyth (Waterloo), E Peters

Might I be alone in wondering if President Clinton has permitted himself a wry
smile when he considers the lengths that the British Premier and his cohorts
went to in order to attempt to undermine his bid for the White House at the
last presidential election?
I suspect that John Major is now more grateful for the backing and support of
Bill Clinton than ever he dreamed possible just three short years ago.
And wouldn't it be ironic if future historians were to judge Clinton as being
infinitely more adroit in his handling of foreign policy issues than either of
his two immediate predecessors, the Republican Presidents Reagan and Bush?
It's a funny old world, as Lady Thatcher would put it.

The Scottish Green Party is a member of the Federation of European Green
Parties which includes all the national Green parties from the Atlantic to the
Urals.
Within this, the Scottish Green Party, the Green Party of England and Wales,
the Green Party of Northern Ireland, and Comhaontas Glas, the Irish Green
Party, have formed a group to meet regularly to discuss areas of mutual
interest.
Although the UK voting system means that we have yet to make an electoral

people elected at all levels of Government including two MEPs, one TD, and a

LEADING political figures were among a congregation of about 600 at St Giles'
Cathedral in Edinburgh yesterday for a service of thanksgiving for the life of
former Conservative Prime Minister Lord Home of the Hirsel, who died in October.
Together with representatives of the royal family, they heard the Duke of
Buccleuch, in his address, speak of Lord Home - who was aged 92 when he died -
as a man of charm, intelligence, wit and ``a sense of service to others.''
The Duke said that Lord Home - Prime Minister from 1963-64 - had climbed to the
top of the ladder in his field ``without ever using his rivals as steps.''
He said Mr Harold Wilson, who succeeded him as Prime Minister, had said he was
the most honourable person he had come across and did not think he had an enemy
in the world, while Mrs Thatcher had called him ``the wisest man I've ever
met''.
``Tributes to great politicians are customary, but they have seldom been so
deepy sincere,'' the Duke said..
Among those who attended the service were Lord Whitelaw, who was deputy Prime
Minister during Margaret Thatcher's leadership, former Defence Secretary and
former Scottish Secretary Lord Younger, and the present Scottish Secretary, Mr
Michael Forsyth.
Mr Forsyth was accompanied by other members of the Scottish Office ministerial
team, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Mr George Kynoch and Mr Raymond Robertson.
Sir David Steel was among a number of politicians from the Opposition parties.
Lord Younger read extracts from Lord Home's biography, The Way The Wind Blows,
and the 23rd Psalm to the tune of Crimond, a favourite of Lord Home's, was sung.
Lord Home's son, David, and one of his three daughters, Caroline, gave
readings, and prayers were led by the Most Rev. Richard Holloway, the Bishop of
Edinburgh, and the Rev. Gordon Tams, vicar of St. Mary's and All Souls,
Coldstream, where Lord Home was buried.
The blessing was given by the Right Rev. James Harkness, Moderator of the
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

LABOUR yesterday challenged the Government to admit that the average family
would be worse off as a result of the Budget.
The Cabinet was in a state of ``considerable confusion'' over the Budget, the
Opposition claimed.
Party deputy leader John Prescott wrote to Deputy Prime Minister Michael
Heseltine urging him to admit that the Budget changes now mean a typical family
is #670 a year worse off than in 1992.
Mr Prescott asked Mr Heseltine to confirm the true picture in a Commons debate
today.
In the letter, Mr Prescott said: ``Last week, senior Ministers were claiming
that, as a result, the average family would be #9 a week better off next year.''
However, Mr Prescott said Conservative Party chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney had
conceded when interviewed at the weekend that this was not the case and the
Budget would only be responsible for a small percentage of that figure.
Labour leader Tony Blair tonight will expect his MPs to abstain on the
Chancellor's 1p tax cut, while the Liberal Democrats will vote against it.
The SNP yesterday challenged the other Opposition parties to support it in
voting for a Budget amendment which would allow VAT on fuel to be reduced from
8% to 5%. It also wants support in voting against the increase in petrol duty
and the 1p income tax cut.
SNP leader Alex Salmond said last night: ``If our amendment is selected, we
call on all Opposition MPs to join with us in voting for our proposal which
allows VAT to be reduced to the European minimum of 5%.
``By tabling these amendments, the SNP is signalling its clear intention to
divide the House at the end of the Budget debate.''
In yesterday's continuing Budget debate Shadow Health Secretary Harriet Harman
accused Tory right-wingers of wanting to see an end to the National Health
Service as a free service available to all.
She clashed bitterly with Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell, who said the Budget
continued the real-terms growth in spending on the health service.
Former neuro-surgeon Sam Galbraith (Strathkelvin and Bearsden - Lab.) condemned
the Private Finance Initiative as ``privatising'' the NHS.
In Glasgow, a contract concerning the care of the elderly had been let. Now
changes were needed but the health authority was ``locked into'' a long-term
contract.

Despite the invention of fabrics which should have made the iron obsolete, this
household chore remains. DEEDEE CUDDIHY talks to women who get all steamed up,
and a man who thrives on it.
WE ALL know now that whoever said new technology would cut down on paperwork -
and it was probably someone who went on to make a fortune  was talking complete
nonsense. But what about that other great lie of the twentieth century: the
claim that man-made fibres would mean never having to say ``iron'' again?
The whole point of drip dry was being able to wash something and then wear it
without doing anything tedious in between.
So why is it that, all these years after the launch of that first miracle
fabric, I still meet people - women, actually, if I'm being perfectly honest -
who complain about the huge piles of ironing they have waiting for them at
home?
Janice, for instance, a new woman if ever I met one; Sheila, so naturally
undomesticated that her husband does all the shopping and cooking; busy, busy
Barbara who admitted she even irons her children's socks!
Liz, thank goodness, didn't let me down. She was out at a union meeting when I
phoned but her daughter assured me: ``Mum never irons although my dad sometimes
does if he needs a shirt.'' But she revealed there was a rebellious cousin in
the family who ironed everything ``including her knickers''.
Although brought up to appreciate the finer points of a well-turned-out
organdie bedspread (my sister and I had a twin set - with curtains to match), I
had my eyes opened to the tyranny of ironing when a friend showed me how the
severe shaking of every item of clothing as it is taken from the washing
machine, prior to being hung up to dry, will reduce wrinkles to virtually
nil.
``And what can't be dealt with in that way isn't worth owning,'' she declared.
Since that day, our iron has rarely been taken from the cupboard. In fact, it
was last used 11 months ago to remove candle grease from a black wool jacket.
Admittedly, ironing isn't anything like the chore it was in the days of
Upstairs Downstairs when big houses employed a full-time laundry maid and there
could be as many as a dozen different irons in the fire to cope with such tasks
as crimping, gauffering, and plaiting, not to mention smoothing out the
master's breakfast newspaper.
But despite the invention of fabrics which should have made irons and ironing
obsolete, there still seems to be a whole lot of repassage going on.
Raymond Trainer is one of an increasing number of people who not only wash
dirty linen for a living but iron it as well.
A former marketing and advertising man, Trainer was a regular customer of the
cunningly named, Glasgow-based company Iron Lady, and likes the service so much
that he decided to buy it. Turnover has more than doubled in recent years with
domestic laundry accounting for around 40% of the current business.
TRAINER says: ``We have 70 regulars who we pick up from and deliver back to
each week. They range from single business people and couples, families where
both partners work, the disabled and elderly - even students who chip in
together to have a bag of 15 items of laundry washed and ironed for #17.75.''
Six women handle the ironing side of the business and one of the perks of being
the owner of the company, Raymond points out, is that you get your own laundry
done for free. ``My wife hasn't picked up an iron for years,'' he added.
Raymond maintains that the industrial, hand-held irons they use provide a
finish which is superior to anything that could be achieved at home with a
domestic appliance.
Even so, for those people who continue to insist that clothes must be pressed
but prefer to do it themselves, there are some irons on the market today which
look as if they could do everything short of actually folding the laundry up
and putting it away in your drawers.
The latest edition of a well-known superstore catalogue includes, among a
selection of three dozen irons, the #128 Ultraglide Elite incorporating
vertical steam facility ``ideal for suits, curtains and delicate items such as
silk on hangers''.
For #79 there's the power injection model with turbo feature and electronic
pump and, at #57.50 there's the chic, black Rowenta Guardian iron which offers
10 levels of variable steam.
And for those people who can't bear to be parted from their irons even when on
holiday, the same catalogue offers a choice of three travelling models which
can be folded up and tucked in beside all your easycare bikinis and T-shirts.

TOM Kite, newly appointed as leader of the 1997 US Ryder Cup team who will
attempt to retrieve the bauble from Europe at Valderrama, has indicated his
ambition to do so as the playing captain - a function last fulfilled as long
ago as 1963 by Arnold Palmer.
Perhaps this would be the appropriate moment for the US PGA to introduce a
sanity clause as a condition of their invitation to Kite. For one thing, in
Palmer's day the match was not only no contest. Britain and Ireland, then
alone, were as resistant to defeat as tissue paper to rising damp.
But Kite alone should not be mocked. Severiano Ballesteros also is on record
that if, as is widely expected, he is made Europe's captain for the first match
on this side of the Atlantic to be held outside the United Kingdom, he would be
equally enthusiastic about assuming the dual role.
Now then. Kite is 45 years old. By the lightning surfing of the Internet for
which this computer-driven mind is renowned, by the time he arrives in Spain he
will be two years older. Similarly, Ballesteros, currently 38, will have joined
the ranks of the 40-somethings.
But that is not all. Kite, who has career earnings on the US Tour of some #6m -
second only to Greg Norman, whose arrival in America conveniently coincided
with the escalation of prize-money to stratospheric levels - took 104th place
on this year's money list, his worst finish since 1973, when he turned
professional.
Scarcely to be outdone, although Ballesteros won the Spanish Open last May, the
Spaniard finished No.33 on the European order of merit, his second-worst
position. Ballesteros played in his eighth Ryder Cup match mainly on the
strength of his performances in the late 1994 tournaments. Kite, not
surprisingly, never did make it to Oak Hill.
Ballesteros in in the middle of a five-month respite from the tournament grind
- a decision which, given the sharp decline in his game, may have seemed
justified to him, but whose validity will be proved only after he has returned
to the fray. So prolonged an absence may not prove to be the cure he craves.
The fact is that the state of both their games, by their own high standards,
deserves the dismissive phrase memorably used by a Texas politician to describe
the office of Vice-President of the United States: ``Not worth a bucket of warm
spit.'' By 1997, impending seniority will be closing in on Kite; on
Ballesteros, who knows what.
Kite says: ``The main job of the captain is to make sure the players are as
comfortable and relaxed as they can be, so that they can concentrate on the
golf and not get caught up in the hoop-la that surrounds the match now.'' Quite
so. How, then, can a captain expect to do the equivalent of walk and chew gum
at the same time?
``I will,'' Kite declared, ``consult the last eight American captains to get
the feel of the problems they encountered.'' They were Dave Marr, Jack Nicklaus
(twice), Lee Trevino, Raymond Floyd, Dave Stockton, Tom Watson, and Lanny
Wadkins - all of whom were, of course, non-playing and more than content to
be so.
The last playing captain here - and he led only home countries' sides - was Dai
Rees, who began four successive combinations of the task as long as 40 years
ago. Apart from that rare nugget among the dross, victory at Lindrick in 1957,
the outcome was never less than utterly predictable and consequently the match
was nothing like the stressful occasion that it has become.
Certainly, all a far cry from the third of the 15 Ryder Cup matches this
correspondent has attended. In 1971 players, officials, media, and some few
supporters filed almost apologetically on to the same aircraft at Gatwick for
the journey to St Louis, where the ritual evisceration was duly performed. No
more.
It's all Concorde for the players, and those and such as those, oppressive
organisation, and protection of razor-wire impenetrability round the team
hotel. Brad Faxon, of the American side, wrote of this September's experience:
``In my room all my clothes for the week were laid out on a bed. There was a
day-planner with my name on it.
``Inside was a list of exactly what we had to wear, what we had to do, and
where we had to be every minute of every day. Even my trousers were numbered.
When I got to the Oak Hill club I discovered that each player was allocated
five lockers. Only five?''
Now, the Ryder Cup match has, thankfully, been rescued from certain oblivion to
become a successful occasion, subject to huge media attention, and generating
great financial rewards for the two organising bodies. Therefore, the very idea
of playing captains is laughable and should not be difficult to resist - if
only to protect the incumbents from being consigned to padded cells.

JAILED Nick Leeson was today considering whether to appeal against his
six-and-a-half year sentence.
As the rogue trader was trying to become accustomed to prison life in
Singapore, his London lawyer was said to have been handed a court order to hand
over all documents linked to the collapse of Barings.
Legal sources in Singapore said Stephen Pollard, Leeson's London-based lawyer,
was served with a court order on Saturday requiring him to produce all
documents linked to Baring's #860m collapse. The order was by lawyers for Price
Waterhouse, the liquidators of Baring Futures (Singapore).
The order would allow the liquidators to examine all documents related to
Barings or related to deals made by Leeson, his wife Lisa, or Mr Pollard over
Barings.
The sources said the aim was to gain information, and there was no suggestion
Mr Pollard had acted improperly.
The papers and documents would include any that provide evidence of assets,
contracts, and arrangements entered into by either of the Leesons or their
agents for the sale of any book, television, newspaper, or screen rights, the
sources said.
Media reports have suggested that Leeson's story could form the basis of a film
featuring Hugh Grant.
Leeson recently signed a book deal for #450,000 giving his side of the story
and there have been numerous unconfirmed rumours of other lucrative contracts
with newspapers around the world.
Singapore's white-collar crime bureau, the Commercial Affairs Department of the
Ministry of Finance, has not ruled out further charges against others involved
in Barings.
Leeson, meanwhile, has until a week tomorrow to decide whether to appeal
against the harsher-than-expected sentence handed down by Judge Richard Magnus
in Singapore on Saturday.
A spokeswoman for his Singapore-based lawyer, John Koh, said today: ``There is
no decision on an appeal. At this point, it's too soon.''
There was widespread speculation before his sentencing that Leeson had struck a
plea bargain deal requiring his close co-operation with the prosecuting
authorities in return for a relatively short sentence.
On Saturday, Leeson and his advisers were clearly shocked by the length of the
jail term.
However an appeal is considered unlikely. Leeson would have to demonstrate that
the sentence was ``manifestly excessive'', and he could have received a 14-year
sentence.

BRITAIN will find itself on a fresh collision course with Brussels today when
it is singled out as the only hardline defender of the national veto.
Ministers are determined to resist any moves at next year's Inter-Governmental
Conference to extend majority voting and erode Britain's power to say ``no'' to
Europe.
The Government's isolation on the issue will become clear when a draft agenda
for the 1996 Euro-summit is published today.
Meanwhile Tory splits on Europe are set to be reopened when defeated leadership
contender John Redwood launches a campaign to rally businessmen against a
single currency.
He is to publish a pamphlet setting out the arguments against economic and
monetary union (EMU) next week.

THERE is no battle between crofters and windsurfers over access to Crossapol,
Travee, The Maze, Balevoulin, Balephetrish and Gott Bay - six major sailing
areas on Tiree.
The only problem exists at the Green, Comaig, where an ancient right-of-way to
the shore and Comaig harbour has suddenly been gated and fenced.
The problem of erosion of Tiree's coast is centuries old - the main causes
being the wind, the sea, and its tides. Marram grass has helped to secure the
machair's soil but only considerable investment and landscaping can secure the
beaches. Perhaps the ``ambivalent'' local factor and councillor could initiate
a land erosion scheme similar to the successful one at Findhorn on the Moray
Firth.
Windsurfers are undoubtedly putting a considerable sum of money back into the
local economy. This is evident through the improved prosperity on the island.
The high cost of getting to Tiree by ferry from Oban means that a ``cheap''
holiday is out of the the question. Therefore most windsurfers spend at least
10 days on the island necessitating frequent visits to the island's stores.
Tourism is the key to a bright future for Tiree, a future in which crofting and
windsurfing coexist happily in a mutually respectful way within Tiree's unique
environment.

ATHLETICS:
JUST before the bell, during the 800 metres at last summer's Scottish track
championships, the unthinkable happened - a young Scot had the temerity to
burst past the leader, Tom McKean, challenging the six-time national champion
to the long run for home. Nearly 300m further on, 19-year-old Des Roache was
still in front and McKean had dropped out, clutching a calf muscle.
Though Roache missed out on a medal, the Clydesdale youngster had shown a
healthy contempt for elders' reputations, perhaps explaining why he collected
the AAA under-20 1500m titles indoor and out, and ended the season as Britain's
top-ranked runner of his age at 800m, 1500m, and the mile.
Yesterday, these credentials won him a #1000 bursary, the biggest of nine made
in a range of sports by Scottish Friendly. And if Roache was a little sheepish,
that was explained by McKean's presence at a ceremony where the teenager, with
a certain inevitablity, was dubbed the next Tom McKean. ``You can't call me the
new McKean,'' dismissed Paisley University student Roache with healthy realism.
``I hope one day I can get to Tom's level. But he has been there and done it.
I've still got to get there, never mind do it.''
McKean himself was generous: ``He's a very talented boy, with a good coach, but
it will depend to some extent on the Scottish public. They are not renowned for
getting behind their athletes. He'll need help, decent sponsorship, or he won't
make it.''
It was the former world and European champion's first public athletics
engagement since failing to make Britain's world championship team earlier this
year. The scars of rejection, not just by Britain, but by Scotland, are still
tender. But do not write McKean's international obituary yet: ``I'm still
training, and very fit - I'm saying no more than that.''
Roache is no stranger to misfortune himself. Clubmates have referred to him as
Mecanno Man, after three metal pins he carries in his right knee, since an
injury curbed promising football talents five years ago.
``The pins have never given me any problem, except that the knee gets a little
stiff in winter. I'll probably be stuck with them and be an arthritic old
man,'' he said.
Roache travelled to the European Junior championships in Hungary this year with
a personal best of 3min. 44.98sec. for 1500m, and high medal hopes.
However, when well placed in a very physical final, two runners behind him
clashed, and one stumbled, raking Roache's right Achilles tendon so badly that
he collapsed.
It was thought to have been ruptured, and he returned home in plaster. Although
he escaped the worst, he was out for seven weeks, missing the rest of the
season.
``It was all very disappointing. It was frustrating to lie there and realise
gold was won in 3-45, and bronze with 3-47.''
He will use the #1000 for altitude training in South Africa this winter, hoping
to win a place in the under-23 Europa Cup.
He is already Britain's fastest over two laps at under-23, and Brian
McAusland's Clydesdale squad, the best men's middle-distance group in the
country, should ensure that he gets the chance to maximise his undoubted
promise. Other Scottish Friendly Assurance bursaries (#250 each):
Lynsey Ann Graham (water-skiing), Bianca Hopkins (trampoline), Sarah, Jenny
Blamire (both table tennis), Gillian Fraser (skiing), Kirsten Dyce (athletics),
Gordon Jamieson (fencing), Kirsti Buchanan (archery).
q KAREN Macleod's Atlanta Olympic hopes may have been blown by a faulty time
clock.
The Scot finished second in Sunday's California Marathon in Sacramento,
credited with 2hr 34min. 23sec., behind the American winner Michaela Reger
(2-32-45).
Maria Trujillo (USA) took third with 2-34-46, while England's Julie Colby was
fourth in 2-38-25.
But times on the finish clock, and on Macleod's own watch, suggest she ran
faster, and if not amended officially, the #2000 prize she collected will be
scant consolation.
Three marathon women will go to the Olympics, and the third quickest UK
contender, US-born Suzanne Rigg, has 2-34-21 to her credit - just two seconds
faster than the Skye woman, who was fourth in last year's Commonwealth Games.
A photograph of her crossing the finishing line, underneath the clock, will be
sent by a US journalist and used in a bid to establish her correct time with
selectors - or at least persuade them she and Rigg should race over the same
course for the third Olympic spot behind Liz McColgan and Marianne Sutton.

THE leaders of the largest unionist and nationalist parties in Northern Ireland
are to seek talks with the Prime Minister on the future of the province's
economy.
Ulster Unionist David Trimble and Mr John Hume of the SDLP agreed the move at
the end of a meeting yesterday, which both described as constructive and very
positive.
As the peace process moved in to a new phase following President Clinton's
visit and Mr Major's twin-track agreement with Irish premier John Bruton, the
meeting was the first between the two sides for more than six months and
signalled a determination to move forward together on the economic front.
Although there is SDLP opposition to Unionist proposals to set up some sort of
assembly as a move towards all-party talks on the future of the province, they
are united on what steps are needed to beef up the social and economic
structures in the wake of the terrorist ceasefires.
The two sides are to meet again before Christmas and meantime will press Mr
Major for a meeting.
Both Mr Hume and Mr Trimble were upbeat when they emerged from last night's
talks, at which more new proposals were agreed.
Mr Hume said: ``Enormous international goodwill now exists to this part of the
world and it means we can work together to translate it into real benefits for
our people in terms of inward investment.''
Mr Trimble said the main focus of the discussions was on the economy, though
wider political issues were touched on.
``We have, after an understandable hiatus, resumed meetings and we are
determined, particularly on economic matters, that we shouldn't simply be
reactive and passive and letting the Northern Ireland Office and other people
set the agenda,'' he said.
q The Rev Ian Paisley slammed down the phone to end an Irish radio interview
yesterday after saying he was refusing a talks offer from the Dublin
Government.
The Ulster Democratic Unionist Party leader halted the interview with the
words: ``We will put every obstacle in the way for the south to get their own
way in the north.
``We will resist it, have you got the message? Right, that's good. I'm glad you
have got the message.''
Mr Paisley earlier said he would not answer invitations to discussions from
Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring
under the terms of the new twin-track basis for the Northern Ireland peace
process.
q Two men were being questioned last night over an arson bid at a house which
has been attacked 55 times already.
Mr Stephen Lismore claimed police were not doing enough to protect them from
Loyalist paramilitaries whom he claimed were trying to drive them out of the
house at Blacks Road, near Dunmurray, West Belfast.

BRITISH troops touched down in the former Yugoslavia last night to spearhead a
massive Nato peace-keeping operation.
The huge Nato commitment was given an important boost last night when France
decided to rejoin virtually all the alliance's military structures.
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette was expected to announce the move
today at a rare joint session of alliance Foreign and Defence Ministers,
diplomats said. ``France is essentially coming back in,'' said one delighted
alliance source.
RAF Hercules C-130 transport planes landed in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo and
the Croatian port of Split yesterday, carrying key advance parties and
equipment.
A group of 56 troops from 7 Signals Regiment will set up a communications
network for the headquarters of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, which will
command the operation on the ground from Sarajevo.
The RAF's Mobile Air Movements Squadron was flown into Sarajevo to establish a
vital air bridge to the city.
More than 120 staff officers from the ARRC headquarters arrived to prepare the
ground for the arrival of the bulk of the 2500 staff under the command of
Lieutenant General Sir Michael Walker.
Several hundred US soldiers loaded equipment in Mannheim, Germany, ready to
travel by train to Hungary, where a staging post is to be set up for the
20,000-strong American contingent on its way to northern Bosnia.
Over the next 10 days, an ``enabling force'' of more than 2000 troops will
arrive in Bosnia to build up the infrastructure for the 60,000-strong force.
Command of the operation is expected to move from the United Nations to Nato
and Lieutenant General Walker around December 20.
The British signallers, who boarded their aircraft at RAF Bruggen in northern
Germany, were looking forward keenly to the arduous task ahead.
``I'm ready to go, it's my job,'' said Lance Corporal Raymond McGrath.
Most knew the problems they would face, as they had already taken part in
UN-led operations in Bosnia. ``I have a wife and two kids here, it's rough to
be away at Christmas, but it's part of the job,'' said Lance Corporal McGrath.
Nato forces will be given much more robust rules of engagement than the UN,
which will allow troops to open fire first to protect themselves, and will
operate under a single chain of command to remove indecision.
The order for the main force to move will come after the official signing of
the peace accord in Paris next week, and a subsequent meeting of the UN
Security Council.
However, the bulk of the British force, including Challenger tanks and AS90
self-propelled howitzers, will not start to deploy until early January.
The ARRC will have three divisions, commanded separately by Britain, the US,
and France.
France's decision to rejoin Nato's military structure came after intensive
talks between French President Jacques Chirac and US President Bill Clinton.
Paris decided to take up a seat at the alliance's defence planning committee
(DPC) and its military committee.
France left Nato's integrated military structure in 1966.
Nato sources said De Charette, who will make the announcement in the opening
speech today, will stop short of full reintegration, saying Paris would decide
at a later date an ``appropriate role''.
``The fact is that by rejoining the DPC and the military committee, they are
almost as good as there. It is a recognition of the reality,'' said an alliance
souce.
He added the French decision was a shot in the arm for co-operation on the
ground in Bosnia. ``Paris realises that to be part of the game you have to be
in there politically as well as militarily,'' he said.
q An international ``pledging'' conference for donations towards the
reconstruction of Bosnia has been postponed ``because we are nowhere near
knowing what is required'', Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said last night.
A date in early January is now on the cards for the critical stage in the
restoration of peace in the former Yugoslavia - a worldwide gathering, in
Brussels, of countries deciding what they can afford to give towards the
rebuilding of war-torn territories.
Mr Rifkind outlined to his colleagues the details of this week's international
conference in London, which will signal the start of the practical moves to
implement the peace accord.
More than 40 countries and 52 delegations, including the United Nations and the
World Bank, will be at the meeting to establish priorities for putting the
peace plan into operation.

THE US Supreme Court refused yesterday to shield the tabloid newspaper the
National Enquirer from an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit by actor Eddie Murphy's
illegitimate son and the boy's mother.
The justices let stand rulings that a California jury should decide whether the
newspaper report was ``newsworthy'' and therefore unassailable.
The Enquirer reported in 1992 that Murphy and Tamara Hood had a two-year-old
son, Christian Edward Murphy. It reported that Murphy bought a #250,000 house
for the boy and his mother; established a $1m trust for him; and initially sent
Hood child-support payments of #1300 monthly.
Murphy, who previously had denied having any more illegitimate children than a
young girl he had acknowledged fathering, never challenged the article, but
Hood sued.
A state judge threw out her invasion-of-privacy claim, ruling that the Enquirer
had a right to publish the truthful story. However a California appeals court
reversed part of the judge's ruling and reinstated part of the lawsuit.

LABOUR yesterday accused Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth of ``fanning the
flames of separatism to save his own political skin'' as the row raged over his
comment that Britain could face break-up by the year 2002.
Mr Forsyth last night returned the taunt with interest, accusing his opponents
of a ``shoddy, personal attack,'' and claiming that Labour policies offered
victory via the back door to nationalists who could not win the argument for
separatism ``in a straight and honest fight.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond remained sanguine, claiming it was his party which now
was dictating the political and constitutional debate in Scotland, while
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said that only the ``unholy
alliance'' of Tories and Nationalists would break up the UK.
Mr Forsyth had remarked on weekend television: ``It may well be that by 2002
we'll be looking at an independent Scotland'' - a remark which echoed the Prime
Minister's recent observation that an independent Scotland would be ``viable.''
The Scottish Secretary's words had been seized on with glee by the SNP and
regarded with something approaching horror by Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson, who consistently has proclaimed himself a Unionist who believes that
only devolution can halt the demands for separatism.
Mr Robertson yesterday narrowed the focus of his attack by linking the comments
explicitly to Mr Forsyth's efforts to save his highly marginal Stirling seat at
the next General Election.
He wrote to the Scottish Secretary saying he was ``appalled'' to see him
``playing fast and loose with the Union in what was obviously a desperate
attempt to talk up the Nationalist vote.''
He added: ``As you are well aware, a slight last-minute surge in the
Nationalist vote at the last election was the only thing that prevented the
Labour Party candidate from taking your Stirling seat.''
Mr Robertson claimed that, with Tory poll levels plummeting in Scotland, Mr
Forsyth had calculated that the only way of saving his political career was to
talk up the SNP to split the anti-Tory vote.
He wrote: ``You are obviously resigned to your party's defeat, but are prepared
to fan the flames of separatism in order to save your own political skin.''
Claiming that Labour would never do anything to jeopardise the Union, Mr
Robertson said: ``To stoke the fires of nationalism with these crude
frighteners not only debases the office of Secretary of State - it threatens
the very future of the Union himself.''
However, Mr Forsyth said last night: ``It is Labour's foolish proposals which
would saddle Scotland with a tartan tax and put our caring services in
jeopardy, as their funding would continue to be determined at Westminster,
where our voice would be diminished. These proposals are what threaten the
break-up of Britain.
``The Nationalists cannot win the argument for separation in a straight and
honest fight, but Labour has created an opportunity for this by the back door,
following the acrimony and dissension which their ill-thought-out proposals
would provoke.
``I did not invent the tartan tax. George Robertson did. Anyone who aspires to
hold the important office of Secretary of State for Scotland should be capable
of defending their policies without indulging in shoddy, personal attack.
``This is a battle for Britain and for Scotland's place in it. It is high time
Mr Robertson realised what is at stake.''
Mr Salmond said: ``Every time the Scottish constitution is discussed, the
independence option emerges ever stronger. The Labour and Tory parties sought
to marginalise the SNP on St Andrew's Day, but all they achieved was to show
how their Unionism unites them.''
While Labour said only devolution could save the Union, the Tories said
devolution would hasten the onset of independence. Mr Salmond said voters would
react by short-cutting this and voting for the SNP.
For the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Mr Jim Wallace said: The only thing that
will lead to the break-up of the UK is the unholy alliance currently being
forged by Michael Forsyth and Alex Salmond. But however much the Nationalists
and Tories may work together, this will not alter the fact that the majority of
Scots want their own parliament within the UK.''

NORMAN Hogg may possibly be aware of the fact that for over 100 years the
Labour Party has had a policy for a Scottish Assembly.
Given that after all this time his own party is only now setting out its stall
as to how this assembly should operate, it is rather churlish of him to
criticise the SNP for placing its vision of an independent Scottish parliament
before the people after 61 years (November 28).
The SNP vision of a real Scottish parliament has of course been a matter of
record for many years. The fact that the party chose St Andrew's Day to launch
its vision has obviously upset Mr Hogg greatly.
His display of sour grapes may indicate that he is worried that some people in
Scotland may draw comparison between what Labour is offering compared to the
SNP.
Using a footballing analogy, the SNP is offering Scotland a chance to play
among the elite of Europe. The Labour Party believes that the Scottish people
do not deserve to be given this status.
The prospect of nationhood for Scotland dwarfs any Labour/Tory contest about
who is going to rule in the UK for the next four or five years. The past may
belong to Labour in Scotland but the future belongs to the Scottish people
being represented independently inside the European Community.

IA SCOTTISH Office spokesman is quoted (November 27) as saying that no
objection to the proposed Skye Bridge toll regime was made at the local public
inquiry held in January 1992.
This is hardly the truth. The bridge Order had by that time been signed, but
there were very strong objections made to the charging of tolls. Sixteen out of
20 community councils were totally opposed to tolls of any kind, and three of
the four others accepted a minimum toll regime reluctantly, as did the district
council.
A petition with over 7500 signatures, out of a Skye population of then under
10,000, was collected against the proposed tolls.
Highland Regional Council expressed its disquiet over the proposed tolls, and
even the Government's own appointed recorder at this inquiry said the tolls
were too high and should be reduced.
As usual the Scottish Office chose not to listen to local people, but continued
to say it was consulting locally. Can we have an assurance that it will listen
to the new Highland Council?

THE 60,000 alliance-led troops who intend to keep the peace in Bosnia have
several significant advantages over their hapless predecessors who arrived
under the flag of the United Nations. Most importantly, they actually have a
peace to keep, at least for the moment. The crucial error of the United Nations
leadership was to imagine that it could in some way impose a peace as well as
keeping one. This lunatic idea was given flesh by Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali in a report to the summit meeting of the Security Council in
January 1992. Boutros-Ghali even suggested the formation of peace-enforcement
units under his command, an idea which senior figures in Washington could not
tolerate. The United States will supply a significant part of the new
peacekeeping force and while this is welcome as a sign that the efforts of the
Western alliance may now acquire some coherence, there are enough doubts
lingering over the American presence to cause concern.
President Clinton has made clear his own determination that US troops must be
involved in the peacekeeping process. He is right to say that it is not
logically or morally consistent for the United States to have made the peace
and then to withdraw and let allies police it. To allay fears back home he has
laid down ground rules which ensure that if his troops are attacked they will
respond with overwhelming force. That might make the civilians feel more
content, but skilled troops determined to press home an attack can cause
considerable damage and many casualties before they succumb to that
overwhelming force. Nor is President Clinton absolutely clear on the length of
time that US troops will spend in Bosnia. The objective is to withdraw the
troops within a year which, as many people have noted, may have some connection
with the presidential election.
These issues should not be seen as carping. President Clinton knows perfectly
well that he has managed the peace negotiations with aplomb and deserves credit
for the achievement. He knows equally well that opinion polls show a majority
of Americans opposed to sending American troops to Bosnia and that any hint of
a repetition of the events in Somalia could devastate his chances of
re-election. He is taking a principled risk and, in essence, that is what the
leadership of the United States should be about. In that context the problems
of his Republican opponents are thoroughly deserved. Senator Dole and his
cronies are in the exquisitely difficult position of opposing the deployment of
troops but finding it impossible to press home their position for fear of being
seen to deny support to the troops who will go to Bosnia. They have recovered
their position a little by drafting strict controls on the deployment but
nothing they can do will disguise the faintly nauseating nature of their
unprincipled isolationism.
Aside from military matters, the vital task of the alliance, but particularly
of the Americans, is to make Serbia's president, the unappealing Slobodan
Milosevic, honour his commitments to the peace agreement. In essence this means
that Milosevic must be pressured by all means available to force his Bosnian
Serb allies to abide by the terms of the Dayton agreement. If he does not do
this he should be told bluntly that sanctions will stay in place against his
regime. The Bosnian and Croatian parties to the agreement should also be told
firmly that they must adhere to Dayton, or else. This is not a time for
delicate niceties; too much is at stake.

As Forte's share of the Savoy goes up for grabs, Chris Stone reflects on the
hotel's snob value
AFTERNOON tea at the Savoy does not seem to have quite the same ring to it as
the Ritz and, indeed, the latter is pricier at #17.50 against the Savoy's
#15.95 and it is often necessary to book further in advance. But the tea is of
equal quality and has remained so even after the Fortes effectively took over
the running of the show after fierce opposition from the old guard D'Oyle Carte
family loyalists led by Sir Hugh Wontner.
He served for more than 50 years until his death as chairman in 1992 and
famously saw off a hostile takeover bid in 1953 by Mr Charles Clore, a famous
retailing magnate of the time, and Mr Harold Samuel, then chairman of Land
Securities property company.
Another Savoy stalwart was old Etonian former managing director Giles Shepard
who remarked of Forte when it was attempting to take control of the hotel,
``the stewardship of the Savoy could not be entrusted to a vast combine which,
among other things, runs service stations on the main arterial roads''. The
somewhat sneering and, one has to say, snobbish approach to Lord Forte and his
son Rocco by the Savoy establishment could hardly have been more eloquently
expressed.
Forte, in fact, never did gain full control of the Savoy Group (which takes
three other hotels, Claridges, Connaught and the Berkeley); the two-tier share
structure introduced by Wontner saw to that. But it did gain 68% of the shares,
if only 42% of the votes, enough to considerably expand its role and dictate
the running of the group.
Now, Forte, under bid pressure itself from Granada, is putting its share stake
up for sale, a quite extraordinary move when one considers that it took a
13-year battle from 1981 for it to reach the influential position it now holds,
even if full control still eluded it. Lord Forte, who proposed to his wife in
the Savoy and spent part of his honeymoon there, will have to bite the bullet,
though, in these perhaps more pragmatic times.
It was felt, again by the establishment, and no doubt by some of the regular
customers, that the appointment of Ramon Pajares as managing director of the
hotel group, the first foreign MD in the hotel's history, would mean the
lowering of standards and an undermining of the hotel's reputation in a
relentless search for profits.
He, though, insisted that he would improve the standards but at the same time
cut out wastage. The old guard would have argued that with a hotel like the
Savoy, shareholders were not primarily interested in making money but in
sharing in its traditional and historic ways.
There have been changes, some of which would undoubtedly have brought
disapproving sniffs from Sir Hugh Wontner and perhaps the D'Oyle Carte family.
The hotel was created in 1889 by Richard D'Oyle Carte, the legendary
impresario, as a result of the success of his Gilbert and Sullivan operas.
Changes include the closing of the group's purchasing departments for meat and
vegetables. The centralised wine-buying operation has also gone, including the
departure of Mr Giles Townsend, the wine buyer and son of Group Captain Peter
Townsend. The Savoy's in-house printing operation has also been shut.
These changes, it has to be said, do not appear on the surface at any rate to
have caused any damage to the Savoy or deterred its clientele which tends to
stay loyal.
The American Bar, the famous Grill Room, as well as the River Restaurant
continue to attract their regular customers. Nor has the Savoy become any less
what some people might regard as stuffy and others traditional. There still has
to be a certain amount of dress decorum, and paying in cash, at least in some
parts of the hotel is considered distinctly infra dig. One famous City
journalist, years ago, upon leaving the Grill room was reputed always to get
the head waiter to sign for him.
The Savoy is very much a hotel for business occasions. It always was and places
such as the substantial River Room, the Beaufort and seven private rooms named
after Gilbert and Sullivan operas, accommodate from six to 100 guests.
And the Savoy can certainly boast that it has played and continues to play host
to film stars and celebrities generally. There was an occasion when this
particular journalist was sorely tempted to forget an especially stuffy
business conference and head off instead to interview Shirley Maclaine to whom
a kind and thoughtful member of the staff had directed me.
Another time, an excited visitor ran up to the actor holding court in the
foyer, screaming ``Peter O'Toole!''. Richard Harris did not try to dissuade
her. The American actress Elaine Stritch was so enamoured of the Savoy she
lived there for many years, presumably on reduced terms.
certainly a new broom is sweeping through the hotel but not neccessarily to its
detriment though only time will tell whether all the changes are positive. In
the meantime various deals are on offer for those who have the inclination and
can afford it and can include dinner and dancing in the River Restaurant or
pre-theatre supper in the Savoy Grill at #330 for two on the first night and
#240 for each additional night.
It is not quite like the early days of grandeur which included the flooding of
a courtyard for a party given by champagne millionaire George Kessler with
Caruso singing from a gondola, later transformed into a beautiful ballroom
where Pavlova danced. But the Savoy remains essentially the Savoy.

NOT since the late President John F Kennedy came out and clarified much which
had previously puzzled by walking tall at the Brandenberg Gate and admitting to
startled Germans ``Ich bin ein Berliner'' - a type of doughy bread roll, the
Prussian equivalent of the bap - have I winced so much for an American on the
make.
Few have the talent to sell a heavily clocked old banger with panache and make
the victim feel privileged to be stuck with the wreckage and politicians are
not to be counted among their number. Best advice for them is ``don't give up
your day job'' and stay away from the used-car lot.
Alas, few do and thus, exposed these past few days to retread rhetoric,
clapped-out policies, and dangerously loose thinking toshed up as this year's
chrome-plated winner, my toes have curled so tight they may never unfurl.
The cringe factor was triggered when President Bill Clinton told the
inhabitants of the Republican capital: ``I feel like a real `Dub' today.''
Voters in America with Irish connections, please note. ``A real Dub''.
As also, please note, those synagogue goers who might bolster his chances of a
second term in the White House after seeing their President wearing a yamulka
at the funeral of Yitzhak Rabin. Pay attention to those with only a slender
grasp of life's verities who applauded his thinly veiled ``whop ass''
admonition to American troops setting off for Bosnia. They, too, now know where
to put their cross on the ballot paper without counting the cost of the body
bags.
Such behaviour as we have seen recently from Whitewater's ``boy most likely to
succeed'' is, I imagine, no more calculated to raise a laugh or give offence
than is the long-established habit of American film makers to flag the obvious
for those contributing to their box office receipts who may have spent their
most taxing school days at the back of the class doing arcane things with
raffia.
I refer to that strange Hollywood addiction to splash every film sound-track
with cue music...... a Brigadoon skirl when a Scot walks into frame, a
rollicking Left Bank squeeze of the accordion when a Frenchman appears centre
right, and so on.
What fascinates as much as it repels is the sheer crass lack of sensitivity to
others' sensibilities. If it is Tuesday it must be Germany therefore lederhosen
and who gives a sauerkraut if you pulled them on with the wee flap at the back.
New World naivety can be charming, home-spun grits and beans manners in the
style of The Waltons bringing a sympathetic smile to the face of even the most
cynical in much the way that a pyjama-clad, sleepy eyed tot will be indulged
when he strays into a dinner party and asks if the fat man with the red face
sitting next to his mother is likely to explode.
But Presidents should know better. And so should we. In all the best westerns
the cavalry comes to the rescue, the renegades are routed, and the good guy and
his gal ride into the sunset with the benign blessing of John Wayne...... all
passion, and ammunition, spent. But real life does not come in two reels with a
Cornetto in between.
Real life is intractable political and budgetary problems at home, plus Newt
Gingrich giving you a bad time, thus the imperatives of survival represented on
the world stage as the beacon of world peace. I have visited too many war
graves - yes, in the Falklands too - to buy that crock of selfless service.
The image may be ``as seen on TV'' but we do not have to buy. The revved-up
promise of politicians, especially Presidents and Prime Ministers, should be
taken with a pinch of salt, the small print checked, the bargain beneath the
Simoniz closely scrutinised for rust, dents, and filler.
Why, given their common line with tradesmen who assure that their intervention
is necessary solely because of the botched job of the chap who went before, do
we pay any attention to politicians?
Why, even yet, do we not tell them that they have been rumbled, the game's a
bogey, and that we know their power broking has ephemera as its stock in trade?
Perhaps we are, after all, suckers for salesmen...... even those from whom we
would not buy a used car.
More people in this country now play the National Lottery than intend to vote
at the next General Election. Could it be they believe that with the lottery
they have at least a chance, however slender.
The low level of public esteem in which politicians have for some time been
held - be they the late bread roll, the incumbent ``Dub'', our very own
soap-box orator from Brick Lane, the entire Italian Cabinet or assorted EC
finaglers - does not augur well for a healthy political future. How can it all
have come about?
Meantime, not yet at the front line of joined-up political thought but already
big on fearless self exposure, with the Irish problem sorted, Bosnia done and
dusted, the Middle East no longer problematic and Spain brought on side, where
next for Bill Clinton to slay dragons?
Clearly, given the traditional flexibility of presidential genealogy, he is
unlikely to shrink from claiming kinship with the troubled French, pressing the
flesh in Paris, and telling them: ``I feel like a real Gauloises today.'' He
might be offered a light, perhaps win a few votes back home on Walton Mountain.
But should we care?

Jerusalem
THE widow of assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin held open the
possibility today that she would embark on a political career.
``I am not saying yes and I am not saying no at this stage,'' said Leah Rabin,
67, in a television interview.
``I hear about it everywhere,'' she said about speculation she might run for
office. ``It seems to me everything is still terribly fresh and painful and it
is not the time to deal with what will happen later.''
Public debate on the issue was touched off by her daughter Dalia Ben-Artzi
Philosof, who said her mother had the qualifications to be a leader in her own
right.
Such talk, Mrs Rabin said, ``embarrasses me very much'', although she thanked
her daughter for the thought.
After the assassination Mrs Rabin was outspoken in her criticism of the Israeli
right wing, which she accused of fostering an atmosphere of hate that led to
the killing by a religious Jew.
In the interview, a month to the day after her husband was killed, Mrs Rabin
said she could not shake the memory of his final moments as they left a Tel
Aviv peace rally.
``It is as if I pushed the pause button on the video and I see the same
picture, which always appears before my eyes. I am walking down the stairs,
just as we did, happy and filled with satisfaction and joy at what had happened
at the rally a few minutes earlier.
``Now there are three shots and I see him fall - and they told me it wasn't
real,'' she said, referring to the initial confusion after the shooting.
``In retrospect, I know that at that moment he was almost clinically dead. This
picture does not leave my eyes.''-Reuter.

THE Queen Mother left hospital yesterday, 18 days after her hip operation.
The 95-year-old looked in good health as she walked with sticks from the King
Edward VII Hospital for Officers in London's Marylebone.
She was wearing a royal blue dress suit with matching jacket and floral trim.
She smiled and waved at photographers from the steps of the hospital,
accompanied by a matron and a nurse who later presented her with a posy of
yellow flowers.
She then stepped, without help, into a black and brown Daimler, waving to
onlookers as the car left for Clarence House accompanied by her lady in
waiting, Lady Margaret Colville.
A Clarence House spokeswoman said: ``She is very well.''
The Queen Mother was last seen in public at the Ritz Hotel last month, hours
before being admitted to hospital for the operation to replace her right hip.
At her last public engagement at the Royal British Legion festival of
remembrance service, she was able to walk only a few yards with the aid of two
sticks.
A Buckingham Palace spokesman said yesterday: ``She has made satisfactory
progress and is being allowed home.''
She has no public engagements in her diary and is not expected to be seen in
public again until the royal family gathers at Sandringham for Christmas.
It is hoped that she will be able to attend the Christmas Day church service.
She will need continual care and exercise, and to keep mobile for her hip fully
to recover.

ANOTHER festive season, another gritty drink-driving advert, but as the
Government unveils its latest PR ploy to reduce alcohol-related accidents, it
is still cold-shouldering a growing clamour for legislative change.
This week, those at the sharp and often bloody end of the debate - the police
and medical officials - have called for a near halving of the legal drinking
limit from 80 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood to 50
milligrammes.
It's the first time they've come out with such a clear-cut call and it comes on
top of stronger evidence that even a small amount of alcohol impairs ability,
and a growing public perception that drink-driving is a social evil.
But the Government has refused to budge. Today it takes the wraps of its new
Christmas anti-drink-drive campaign, a day after Transport Minister Steven
Norris insisted the existing limit worked and was palatable for the public.
Department of Transport officials repeated the same line yesterday. ``First and
foremost, the only safe level is zero,'' said a DoT spokesman. ``Our position
has been for many years, don't drink and drive and we have been extremely
successful over the years with our campaigns in changing people's attitudes.
Most people in the UK now agree that drink-driving is socially unacceptable . .
. but we don't want to risk losing public support if the public perceives the
50mg limit as being too low.''
But there are some in the medical profession who believe now is the right time
to take advantage of the public's distaste for drink-driving and tighten
restrictions. They point to studies which show that drivers' reactions are
impaired by up to 20% for two hours after drinking, even though their
bloodstream levels were below the current legal limit.
Dr Keith Little, a consultant in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary's accident and
emergency department who deals with the aftermath of drink-driving accidents,
believes the Government has the ideal opportunity to crack down on
drink-driving.
``Things have improved progressively and there has been a change in attitude
out in the community, but we still have a significant number of people involved
in road accidents who have been drinking and driving.
``We would like a nil level but we realise that that is not practicable. Any
reduction would be desirable to try to utilise the public's changing attitudes,
something like half of the current level. I think the public would be ready to
accept that.''
But the DoT remains resistant to such ideas. ``Public perception is the key to
this being a successful campaign,'' said the DoT spokesman. ``What we don't
want to do is risk that level of public support by changing to a limit which is
not necessarily justified. We're not convinced the support would be there. The
thing that matters here is those being hurt and killed on the roads, and only
2.5% of drink-driving accidents involve levels of 50mg to 80mg.''
The British Medical Association, in calling on the Government to reduce the
limit from 80mg to 50mg, pointed to the rest of Europe, where many countries
have taken a stricter stance. France, Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands,
Norway, and Portugal have 50mg limits; Sweden and Poland meanwhile have a 20mg
limit; and the limit in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Romania is zero.
A Scottish spokeswoman for the BMA said she felt the time was right to apply
added pressure for change, but the BMA was not confident of being able to shift
the Government. ``As with tobacco, you're up against vested interests aren't
you?''
The Automobile Association has said its position is a little difficult because
it believes a lowering of the limit would overstretch police resources, but it
acknowledges that the police and public see lowering the limit as a positive
step.
Dr Little, meanwhile, won't need to watch the launch of the new Government
advert today to get an idea of the impact of an alcohol-related accident. He
sees enough of it on a regular basis.
``Like the 18-year-old drunk driver who bent down to pick up a can of beer
which had spilled in the car and lost control of the vehicle, killing his
friend who was in the passenger seat,'' he said. ``Or the individual with five
other people in the car who drove straight into a tree at 60mph to 70mph. Or
the five-year-old girl brain-damaged for life by the drunk driver who left the
road and struck her full on as she walked along the pavement. So it goes. It's
just endless.''

EIGHT school projects worth nearly #9m are being passed to new unitary
authorities by Strathclyde region, because it does not have time to make the
necessary legal commitments before it is abolished on April 1 under local
government reorganisation.
The projects, including a long-awaited #2m upgrading at Oban High School, were
the cause of concern to local members at yesterday's private meeting of the
region's Labour group.
Some fear projects in their areas could fall by the wayside as unitary
authorities grapple with acute financial crises in their early days of
operational existence.
Other projects on the list are:
q.Rockfield Primary, Oban, dining hall extension - #640,000;
q.Notre Dame R.C Secondary, Glasgow, extension - just over #1m;
q.Glasgow secondary schools' science laboratories upgrading - #600,000;
q.Our Lady of the Annunciation and St Mirin's R.C Primaries, Glasgow, upgrading
- #1.2m;
q.Harthill/Benhar Primary School, Lanarkshire, replacement - #1.85m;
q.Tinto Primary School, Lanarkshire, extension - #300,000;
q.St Bride's R.C High School, East Kilbride, upgrading - #1.22m.
The Labour leader, Councillor Robert Gould, explained: ``We can't legally
commit these projects in the time available. These will be left to the
succeeding authorities to deal with.''
According to a senior council official, all eight would continue to be
developed in terms of preparing drawings, tendering documents, and acquiring
sites.
But a council source warned that Scottish Office plans to provide block capital
allocations to councils rather than to individual services made it more
difficult to confirm that any particular project in education would get
precedence over, say, a project in social work.
The source added: ``Councils might not only face competition from other
authorities for resources, they might also be competing with other services
within their own authority.''
Meanwhile Labour councillors have agreed to go out to consultaion on the
proposed closure of Garthamlock Secondary School, Glasgow, which is less than
40% full and needs #780,000 of urgent repairs following a fire in May.
They also agreed to invite the Greater Easterhouse Redevelopment Company to be
part of that consultation.

SEVE Ballesteros, as a brash youth of 17, once gave voice to his opinion the
night before the first round of the Spanish Open at La Manga that it was
impossible for a professional golfer to score in double figures at a single
hole. His audience recoiled in horror at this tempting of the fates and, as
they suspected, it was not long before he had to eat his words.
At the ninth the next day he ran up an 11, having been out of bounds twice,
later finding water and then sand.
Greg Norman is the latest to discover that, in his own words: ``Golf is a very
humbling game.'' At the weekend he, too, scored an 11, at the fourteenth of The
Lakes course in Sydney in the third round of his own Greg Norman Classic,
having hit four shots into water from the same spot.
There is a kind of perverse pleasure in knowing that the world No.1 is capable
of descending briefly into the domain of the hacker. It would be more true to
say that we empathise. We know all about the bushes, trees, ditches, and
waist-high rough that lie in wait, especially for those who have just thought
they have cracked the game at last. The golfing gods know, you know.
My favourite source of comfort after such harsh lessons in reality is to dip
into Chris Plumridge's ``Book of Golf Disasters and Bizarre Records''. There,
in addition to the Seve story, you will find that the highest known score at a
single hole is 166. It is a barely believable tale of supreme idiocy.
Those who recorded this performance by an American woman in 1912 on the
sixteenth at Shawnee Country Club were kind enough to omit her name, though
there was a saving grace. The competition was a qualifier with the same number
of entrants as qualifying places so all she had to do to succeed was to post a
score, any score.
The ball she was using, it seems, was capable of floating and when it went into
a large water hazard from her tee-shot, she commandeered a boat and played most
of her shots from the vessel before finally moving the ball on to dry land. Why
she never took a penalty drop is not recorded.
That particular course also claimed the record for the highest score by a
professional, as recorded in the Golfer's Handbook, in the 1927 Shawnee Open.
At the seventeenth, Tommy Armour, who had won the US Open the week before, lost
count of the number of balls he hooked out of bounds and thought it might have
been a 21, but he erred on the safe side and called it a 23.
There were a few quiet disasters in this year's Open Championship at St
Andrews, most memorably Jack Nicklaus's 10 at the fourteenth.
The official annual of the tournament is just published and at the back you
will find hole-by-hole scores of every competitor. The eclectic worst at each
hole over the four days by the 159 players came to 123, or 51 over par.

A #2m expedition to re-examine the wreck of the biggest British vessel lost at
sea was announced by the Government yesterday.
The expedition should clear up the 15-year-old mystery of the Teesside-built
bulk carrier MV Derbyshire, which went down in a typhoon off Japan in 1980 with
the loss of its British crew of 42 and two wives.
The decision follows a report on the Derbyshire from former Master of the
Rolls, Lord Donaldson.
``I have concluded that the likely cost of such an examination, although large,
is fully justified in the light of the potential benefits to ship safety,''
said Lord Donaldson in his report.
An official inquiry into the disaster in 1987 said the weather was probably to
blame but families of the crew, trade unions, and shipping experts have long
argued that the disaster was caused by structural defects.
Lord Donaldson was asked to make a fresh assessment following a #380,000
union-financed expedition which located and photographed the ship's wreck last
year.
Describing the loss of the Derbyshire as ``one of the great unsolved mysteries
of the sea'', Lord Donaldson said the case for a fresh expedition was ``not
only made out but is compelling''.
Transport Secretary Sir George Young said the European Commission had agreed to
share the cost of the expedition, although he added that Lord Donaldson had
been so persuasive that the UK Government would have stood the cost alone if it
had had to.

Alan MacDermid reports on a new hospital lifeline
for underwater casualties
Divers are in danger of being lured to their deaths by the siren call of the
computer. They wear them on their wrists, like a jumbo-sized digital watch, and
they are programmed to tell a diver how much time he has left down below, to
the second.
This slavish regard for accuracy may be one reason, says a West Highland
doctor, why Scotland's newest hospital has established itself in a few short
months as one of the busiest treatment centres in Britain for divers with the
bends.
The wrecks along the west coast are a magnet for amateur divers from all over
the UK, but since March nearly two dozen of them have also sampled the delights
the Lorn and Islands Hospital in Oban.
Their first port of call was the recompression chamber at Dunstaffnage Marine
Research Laboratory on the other side of town, after which the majority would
go on to spend a day or two convalescing at the hospital, sometimes returning
to the chamber for a repeat procedure.
The symptoms, which vary in severity - from itching and joint pains to
paralysis - are caused by gas bubbles accumulating in the diver's tissues as a
result of the hyperbaric pressures of the deep. Too rapid an ascent causes the
bubbles to expand before the diver's system has had time to clear them.
Their treatment is undertaken by Dr Gordon Murchison and Dr Colin Wilson, two
local GPs who also work as anaesthetists at the hospital and have made a
specialty of diving medicine.
Every self-respecting diver now wears one of the new generation of computers on
his or her wrist. Costing several hundred pounds, they can be programmed
through desk-top PCs from tables which correlate air use, depth, time, gas
mixture. The most sophisticated will monitor the diver's exertion rate and feed
it into the time-left information that can be called up at the touch of a
button. Afterwards the data can be downloaded into the PC to keep a detailed
log of each dive.
To listen to these specifications is to wonder how divers managed before
computers came along. For some, though, it is perhaps all too simple. Dr
Murchison said: ``The number of divers we are treating has gone up and up with
the use of these computers. A lot of them are using algorithmic tables which
have not been proven in practice.
``More and more fancy equipment and not enough expertise and training are
leading some of these people into trouble. Because they are so precise divers
maybe put too much reliance on them, using up all the time they have been
quoted, whereas divers working out times for themselves using traditional
tables might come up with, say, 55 minutes, and stay down for 50, allowing a
margin for something going wrong.''
The outcome of these events, Dr Murchison notes, is added expense for the NHS -
though at local level it is perhaps more of a money-spinner than a burden.
Jonathan Best, chief executive of the Argyll and Bute NHS Trust, which runs the
new hospital, pointed out: ``Most of the divers are from down south, so they
are treated as extra-contractual referrals. That means we bill the patient's
host health authority - #750 a night for observation only, and #1300 per case
if there is treatment involved.''
Divers, however, are not the only business the rest of Britain sends to his
door.
``Our busy time is in the summer months, when the population multiplies
threefold,'' said consultant physician Dr Allan Henderson, a Londoner who came
to Oban last year.
Among the more exotic cases he recalls was one of swordfish poisoning, which
causes vomiting, diarrhoea, intense flushing and collapse (in the patient, not
the swordfish).
``It had been imported and gone off. Apparently it builds up a lot of
histamine,'' said Dr Henderson. The bad news for the restaurant concerned is
that the patient was a Glasgow solicitor.
For local people, though, the #16.5m hospital is an asset they have awaited for
39 years, replacing five old hospitals on separate sites. It is currently a
two-week home-from-home for Mrs Jean Graham, 35, headmistress of the village
school at Minard, near Inveraray.
She has been receiving respite care after being diagnosed in March last year as
having multiple sclerosis. She is remarkably cheerful, given such a cruel blow,
but clearly misses her husband, her little boy, Gordon, aged three, whose
photograph sits by her bedside, and the other 22 children in her charge at
Minard.

ICE SKATING
STEPHANIE Main is proving a hot property for professional show promoters. But
the Edinburgh-based skater, who recently won back the British figure-skating
title, has given them the cold shoulder.
Main, 19, who came third in the multi-nation Piruetten '95 tournament in Norway
last weekend and stars in an ice pantomime at Paisley this weekend, wants to
remain amateur to compete in the 1998 Olympics and has turned down several
big-money offers.
q JUST 13 days after the death of double Olympic gold medallist Sergei Grinkov,
the remaining cast of the Discover Card Stars on Ice figure-skating tour
returned to the ice in Lake Placid, New York, to perform in his honour.
Grinkov, who twice won gold partnering his wife Ekaterina Gordeeva, collapsed
and died of a heart attack while practising at Lake Placid.

IT'S time to look out the long johns and the thermal vests again. After one of
the mildest autumns this century, weather forecasters last night gave warning
that snow, frost, and bitter winds from Siberia will start arriving today.
Eastern areas of Scotland and England will be hit first, with anything from a
mild dusting to ``significant accumulations of snow on the hills''.
A spokesman for the Glasgow Weather Centre said the east coast of Scotland
would get biting winds developing during the day. ``It looks like the cold air
will hit the west by the end of Tuesday. We will be shivering for the rest of
the week.
``Overnight the temperatures will drop to -1C or -2C with the wind coming
straight from Siberia.
``It is going to feel bitterly cold.''
The big chill is likely to continue all this week and bookmakers William Hill
have cut the odds on a White Christmas from 10-1 to 8-1 after a string of
punters laid bets.
British Rail, which was caught out in 1991 with the ``wrong kind of snow'', is
confident that it will cope with any weather problems this week.
European-style powdery snow brought the network to a near standstill in
February 1991, with BR chiefs saying that they were more used to the slushy
``British'' snow.
Railtrack said it had a plan to make sure the points remained operational,
using points heaters which automatically come on in low temperatures.
As an extra precaution, staff would be checking the points in forecast ``cold
spots'' to ensure all was well.
A spokesman said: ``We also have de-icing trains and snow ploughs standing by.
``We will certainly do our very best to keep services              running.''
The RAC warned motorists not to get caught out. A spokeswoman said half of the
three million breakdowns attended by the organisation last year could have been
avoided through regular servicing and maintenance of cars.
``It's the first icy blast of winter which catches many motorists out but
forward planning can help keep the wheels turning in the cold,'' she said.
The RAC is urging drivers to check anti-freeze, wiper blades, batteries, and
tyre pressures, to listen to weather forecasts, and to slow down.

OUTRAGE is spreading in France at plans to push through radical welfare reform.
A wave of strikes has already broken across the country. Right-wing Prime
Minister Alain Juppe has staked his credibility on social security reforms
which he claims are needed to allow France to meet conditions for European
monetary union in 1999.
The strikers' grievances spread into the private sector. The country, now in
crisis, is close to paralysis.
Aides say the Government wants talks with union leaders but will not compromise
in its aim to get rid of the welfare deficit of almost #8000m a year. The trade
unions, despite being riven by rivalry, are determined to wreck government
plans which include social security cuts, lower pensions, cuts in the rail
network, and privatisation of telecommunications.
When even the Gaullist newspapers are stirred to draw extravagant parallels
between the current turmoil and such fateful dates as the French Revolution of
1789 and the 1968 uprising of students and workers, it is clear that the
proposed radical overhaul of France's welfare state has tweaked a touchy nerve.
The demand for a sacrifice may jeopardise the survival of M Juppe's Government.
If there is a political lesson for Britain in the current chaos across the
Channel, then it will be drawn from two separate strands of the argument that
has propelled the country into turmoil. For both right and left wings of
Britain's Conservative Party may draw parallels to suit their case.
Yesterday the manoeuvring for control within the party broke the surface. The
fierce internal row over the Conservative election manifesto, and the fight for
the soul of the party, emerged into public view.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke is heading a campaign to prevent any further moves to
the right over Europe and any further erosion of the welfare state.
John Redwood, meanwhile, the right's leader-in-waiting, signalled his intention
to break the fragile truce on Europe by mounting a campaign to persuade
businessmen to rally against a single European currency. He is to publish a
pamphlet arguing against economic and monetary union.
So both left and right of the Tory party can find arguments from the French
chaos to support their case.
Mr Clarke faces claims from right-wingers that the #3000m reduction in planned
Government spending left too little room for bigger tax cuts. They want a
commitment to big cuts in welfare spending to be included in the election
manifesto. But look, he may say, at the result of such an assault on the core
values of welfare provision in France.
He has already indicated that he will stand firm in resisting demands from the
right for cuts in benefits. He regards tax reductions as a lower priority than
maintaining spending on services such as health and education.
Those who favour a root and branch retrenchment of the welfare state are, in
his words, living in cloud-cuckoo-land. ``I win more votes and I safeguard more
votes by putting it into public services,'' he argues.
His decision to raise the stakes in the battle for control of the Tory party,
by branding nationalist right-wingers as nutters for wanting to erode the
foundations of the welfare state, is seen as a signal of his intent to emerge
as a leadership contender after the election.
It is matched by his determination to halt any further slide in European policy
towards the Euro-sceptics. Mr Clarke is viewed as one of the survivors of a
Tory generation which embraced the post-war settlement.
For him, surely the main argument to be drawn from the strike-ridden French
experience under a dry right-wing government is the danger of bucking a public
consensus in favour of decent welfare provision.
From the politician he views as the chief inhabitant of cloud-cuckoo-land, John
Redwood, the drive is to secure a pledge in the election manifesto ruling out
Britain's joining a single currency in the lifetime of the next Parliament,
which, on one hand, seems to assume a Tory win but is actually some sleight of
hand indicating where he would take a reborn party under his leadership, after
it loses.
As an advocate of a minimalist state, favouring private pensions and an
insurance system to replace public health care, the jettisoning of social
security payments in favour of personal protection plans, the lesson he will
draw from the French experience will be the perils of striving for monetary and
economic union.
Redwood is to launch his pamphlet campaign just three days before the European
summit in Madrid, where talks will take place on next year's Inter-Governmental
Conference on the future of the European Union.
With the Prime Minister fighting a rearguard action to hold his party together
on Europe, sealing the leaks by ruling out a single currency in this
Parliament, but making no public declaration on joining the European monetary
union at a later date, it is hardly the most helpful time to sustain such an
assault. The silence of the Euro-rebels, bought by fudge and nudge, may be
shattered.
The fate of the Maastricht Treaty's goal of a single European currency by 1999
is being played for higher stakes on the streets of France this week. The wave
of strikes is a response to an assault on welfare reform. It is at the same
time a crisis over Europe.
President Jacques Chirac's call for two years of austerity to cut public
deficits was followed by Prime Minister Juppe's overhaul of the debt-laden
social security system. This coincided with tax increases and rising
unemployment.
If the French Government falls, with some observers predicting a snap election
and polls showing two out of three people sympathising with the strikers, it
will have resonance far beyond the picket lines of Paris.

SRU director of rugby Jim Telfer has sounded the clarion call for the
inter-district championship, which gets under way tomorrow, with a reminder
that international reputations will be made and broken over the next four weeks.
Telfer, a long-time proponent of the theme that the district scene is the
natural stepping-stone between club and country, said yesterday that the series
of matches, which reach a climax on December 31, will be the proving ground for
a number of players aspiring to international selection.
The championship, unsponsored and unloved in many quarters, is particularly
significant this year because it may well be the last.
Next season, when Scotland will be represented in the new European Cup
competition - with ties to be played mostly, if not exclusively at weekends and
before Christmas - an already overcrowded fixture card indicates that something
has to go, and the prime candidate for the chop is the inter-district series.
The current championship, with the Exiles defending the title amid a backdrop
of speculation as to their continued survival, also takes place amid the
ongoing debate as to whether club or district sides will be Scotland's
representatives in Europe.
The SRU currently favour the district route for the unarguable reason that they
would be stronger than club sides. However, the added complication is that it
remains to be seen whether or not English clubs who might also be involved in
Europe will release their Scottish players to play for rivals in the lucrative
competition.
In fact, when this very point was put to Newcastle's Rob Andrew and Sir John
Hall last week - vis-a-vis the availability of the likes of Gary Armstrong and
Doddie Weir - both executed a neat side-step with the declaration that it was
much too soon to say.
On one point there is no debate. For the continued well-being of the national
side, Scotland cannot afford to lose the Exiles or, more particularly, the
expatriates' recruitment network which has thrown up a host of individuals over
the years who have laboured effectively in the national cause.
Symbolically, the Murrayfield photocall which brought together Dave McIvor,
Stuart Reid, Fergus Wallace, and Jim Hay - representing North and Midlands,
Edinburgh, Glasgow, and the South - was without a representative from the
Exiles. Nothing sinister, just a by-product of travel difficulties and
competing commitments, but the absent Exiles might well be a precursor for the
future.
This year's championship, which kicks off with games tomorrow between the
Exiles and Edinburgh at Richmond, and North and Midlands versus Glasgow at
Kirkcaldy (7pm), has already been diminished to an extent by competing
premiership interests.
The opening game, between the Exiles and the South which should have been
played on Sunday, was cancelled and is, apparently, to be re-arranged at a
later date.
Additionally, the North and Midlands clash against Exiles on Sunday, December
17, is likely to be hard-hit because the contingent of Stirling County players
in the N and M side have their championship-deciding game against Heriot's FP
the previous day.
Similarly, Edinburgh's game against the South could well be affected, although
in this case any Herioters involved in the Edinburgh side might well consider
the district game to be of more value to them than the club game.
Nevertheless, Telfer yesterday hammered home the fact that, so far as the
international selectors are concerned, the district championship is one not to
be missed.
``Given that this is a year of transition, with a number of senior players
having retired from international duty, the selectors will be taking a
particularly keen interest.
``On the principle that many are called but few are chosen, the championship is
therefore the proving ground for a number of players aspiring to international
selection,'' he said.

TIM Arkless's response to my recent article about windsurfing on Tiree makes it
clear that he is well aware of the conflict between ``unscrupulous'' elements
in his chosen sport and local interests.
I reported the events concerning the rights of way issue as accurately as they
were related to me, although it subsequently appears that the local council has
taken a hand to try to establish the exact position on the issue. Does this not
rather emphasise the strong local feeling on the issue?
I could have added further incidents, with names and addresses supplied, where
locals were disgruntled by some rogue elements within the visiting windsurfing
community. I did try to make it clear that not all windsurfers are implicated.
Mr Arkless appears not to have grasped the Hebridean use of patronymics. He
erroneously refers to Willie MacPhail of Clachan Farm - known to islanders as
Willie Clachan - as Mr Clachan. This has caused some considerable mirth locally.
As to his economic argument, renovating ``ruins'' for seasonal residents does
indeed provide a welcome boost for local builders and provide much-needed
mainly winter accommodation on an island where housing is a major problem.
However, locals find it virtually impossible to compete with incomers when it
comes to buying these ``ruins''.
The same amount of work would be available to island builders if locals were
able to compete, in hard cash terms, in the housing market.

All too often the experience of dining out in an Indian restaurant is a much
too hasty affair. The food may well be excellent, but if the service is on the
brisk side and the atmosphere and ambience are not conducive to relaxation, the
evening can be ruined.
This is frequently the case in city centre restaurants where you feel as if you
are on a conveyor belt, and where there is little opportunity to form a
relationship with the staff or indeed the chef before it's time to leave, often
feeling over-full.
At New Amritsar International things are decidedly different. The restaurant
was well established at Kirk Road in Bearsden but it is now undergoing an
exciting metamorphosis. It has been completely refurbished to form an intimate
and flexible dining space suitable for parties large or small, or an intimate
tete  tete.
A soft and subtle decor is combined with attractive new artwork, tables and
chairs designed for style and comfort have been imported from Italy, and the
impressive horses of white Carrara marble which form the restaurant's dramatic
centrepiece symbolise the highest aspirations of the management.
Fresh flowers, pot plants and candles all add to the ambience and there are
many little personal touches and an attention to detail which is refreshing in
these hurried days when elegance is sacrificed for turnover.
Hot towels after your meal are one of these little luxuries, as are sorbets to
cleanse the palate, but most importantly, owner Manjid Singh has recruited a
highly committed staff whose aim is to give discreet and sensitive service and
to get to know customers personally. This staff is truly international, and
includes two young Italians whose expertise is on the wine side, two Spaniards,
a Turk, and maitre d'hotel, Jaffa Fallahi, who is Iranian.
Being in a residential district like Bearsden is an advantage for a restaurant
like Amritsar. Cities can be depressingly impersonal, but since many people
don't want to have to travel into town to eat, a local establishment has the
opportunity to build up a relationship with its clientle and get to know them
personally. And of course if the food is good and everything else is right,
people will want to keep coming back.
Jaffa Fallahi feels this personal relationship is very important, as is a
philosophy of creating a relationship with the community. He also believes that
the chef should get to know his customers too, and their likes and dislikes.
Amritsar International is fortunate that it has a chef who is not only highly
skilled in Indian cookery, but who is equally at home with French sauces and
has a particular interest in seafood and game. His new European menu is
adventurous and varied, and will be seasonal, another refreshing new idea in
Indian eating on offer at Amritsar.
Buffet nights such as are planned by Amritsar International make good sense
because they introduce new tastes and styles of cooking to people shy of
venturing into the unknown. They encourage diners to be a little more
adventurous and give chefs the opportunity to present new dishes which
complement one another. There is a great variety of cuisine in the Indian
sub-continent and much of it is unknown even to inveterate Indian food
consumers like the citizens of Glasgow and its environs.
Amritsar International's buffet evenings will feature Indian regional cooking
from the Punjab, Kashmir and other parts of the sub-continent.
Chef Mussawar Naqui was born in Lahore but has spent a good part of his life
travelling, picking up ideas and skills and in Glasgow, which he assures me is
his last stop, a splendid Glasgow accent. He is equally at home with Sauce
Bearnaise or Chicken Tikka, and cooking is not just a job for him. He loves it.
He believes that Indian food in Glasgow is not so much ethnic as national like
lasagne and spaghetti. It's different from London's Indian food, but better,
more ethnic and contantly developing.
I can especially recommend Mussawar's Mussels a la Ostende, delicious titbits
in a light batter served in a pastry shell.
These, combined with Amritsar's Special Starter Mix with piquant accompanying
sauces are a meal in themselves. Leisurely starters, of course washed down with
wine, set the tone of the meal and also give the chef time to freshly prepare
main dishes to order.
Beware the food that comes too quickly. The restaurant runs a busy take-away
service with a 20% discount on menu prices. You can phone in your order and you
can even be ultra-lazy and opt for home delivery.
Amritsar encourages children on Sundays for special family evenings, but
children under 12 have a 30% reduction on all menu prices at all times.
New Amritsar International is taking bookings now for excellent value Christmas
lunches from 11th-24th December, for a special Christmas Fayre Festive Dinner
from 4th-24th December (children half-price), and for Christmas Day Dinner.
For the curious, Amritsar is a city in India, in north-west Punjab, centre of
the Sikh religion and site of a shameful massacre in 1919 by British troops of
unarmed supporters of Indian self-government. Better remembered for its famous
golden temple.

WAS interested to read the article on the challenge to the authority of the
collector of tolls on the Skye Bridge (December 1).
It is now nearly seven weeks since a score of us refused to pay the toll on
that wet, windy opening night of the show. So far over 400 occasions of refusal
to pay have been reported to the Procurator-fiscal in Dingwall, in whose
territory the alleged offences took place. So far none of the alleged offenders
has been prosecuted.
All these reports have been passed to the Crown Office in Edinburgh, where they
are no doubt receiving due thought and consideration.
Surely, if the Procurator-fiscal and the Lord Advocate were legitimately able
to convict us, they would have done something about it by now?
Skye Bridge Ltd claims that over 36,000 users have paid the tolls so far. If
the lawyers you quote are right and prove in court that the collector has no
warrant to do his business, then there is going to be an awful clamjamphrie as
Sir Iain Noble and his company refund the decent folk who have so far paid up
in ignorance!
Further, if Skye Bridge Ltd has no warrant to collect money from the public, it
certainly has no right to delay motorists while it searches for police to
caution them.
Police, toll-men, and management have shown great forbearance and courtesy in
dealing with the complicated procedures required for us to record our dissent.
It would cause far less trouble to motorist, toll-man, and police if we simply
handed in a card bearing name, address, and a signed statement of refusal to
pay.

AN expedition to try to solve one of the sea's great mysteries and improve
international shipping safety was announced yesterday by the Government.
No fully satisfactory explanation has been made for the loss of the 169,000
tonne Teesside-built bulk carrier MV Derbyshire.
All 42 British crew members died together with two wives of crewmen when the
ship went down in a typhoon off Japan in September 1980.
An official inquiry into the disaster in 1987 said the weather was probably to
blame.
But families of the crew, trade unions, and shipping experts have long argued
the disaster was caused by structural defects in the vessel.
In the last 15 years, 149 bulk carriers have been lost at sea.
Fresh evidence from a union-sponsored examination of the wreck last year led to
the setting up of a new assessment of the Derbyshire situation by the former
Master of the Rolls, Lord Donaldson.
In a report published yesterday, he concluded that the case for a second
examination of the wreck was ``compelling'' and Transport Secretary Sir George
Young yesterday ordered a #2m expedition.
Sir George said the European Commission had agreed to share the costs of the
examination, which would take place either in next spring or in spring 1997.
Lord Donaldson came to no firm conclusions about the cause of the tragedy.
But he did say it was ``a realistic possibility'' that there could have been a
fracture at bulkhead 65 on the vessel followed by a separation of the two parts
of the hull.
He also said that it was impossible to evaluate this probability ``without a
positive identification of the present position of the stern section''.
Later at a news conference, Lord Donaldson said: ``I am confident that an
expedition is likely to identify either the cause of the accident, or so narrow
down the probable causes of loss, that the maritime community will be able, or
in fact be compelled, to look again at design standards.''
News of the expedition was welcomed on all sides, with RMT leader Jimmy Knapp,
whose union had helped support last year's expedition, saying it was ``a
disgrace it had taken the Government 15 years to act''.
Labour transport spokesman Graham Allen said the mystery surrounding the
sinking had been ``very unsatisfactorily handled so far'', adding that the
families of those lost in the disaster had been ``let down by the Government''.
European Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock said: ``The persistence of those
who have campaigned for further investigation is to be strongly commended.''
He described the death toll from bulk carrier disasters in recent years as
``appalling''.
The ships' officers' union, Numast, said the Derbyshire controversy was ``a
scandal which has dragged on since the ship sank''.
The union's general secretary, Mr Brian Orrell, went on: ``A sorry saga of
cover-ups and whitewash has hung over the case for far too long.''
Marion Bayliss, who lost her husband, the Derbyshire's chief officer, in the
tragedy, said yesterday: ``I would like to know what happened - how my husband
died.''
She told BBC Five Live's Nationwide programme: ``If nothing is done, my husband
and the other 43 people aboard died in vain.''
Doreen Hutchinson, who lost her son and daughter-in-law, told the programme:
``A further examination of the wreck may help to save others. We want to know
the truth.''
The Derbyshire was one of six identical ships. It was when one of the sister
ships, the Kowloon Bridge, broke in two after running aground off Ireland in
1986 that it was decided to hold an inquiry into the Derbyshire loss.
Sir George said that he envisaged an expedition involving manned or unmanned
submersibles which would go down to photograph the wreck, which lies at a depth
of about 4100 metres.
Lord Donaldson said he did not contemplate any part of the ship being raised,
save for the possible cutting off of a small piece of wreckage which could be
examined later.

The costs of educating Scottish pupils vary enormously. So what does
yesterday's balance-sheet report
tell us? Education Correspondent Barclay McBain looks for the facts behind the
lack of nuances
THE local school is one of the biggest businesses in many communities, the
Scottish Office Minister for Education, Raymond Robertson, said yesterday. He
was speaking on publication of the latest Parents' Charter- prompted swathe of
education statistics about the costs of Scottish schools.
We've already had this year's examination results, and after school costs will
come attendance and absence tables, as well as information telling us what
pupils do after they leave school - almost a business in itself.
So does it amount to death by a thousand indicators? Or is there life in all
these pointers to schooling? Mr Robertson certainly thinks so. Publishing facts
and figures about school costs had led, he said, to a growing awareness of the
costs of running a school and of the importance of value for money,
particularly when headteachers were taking responsibility for the vast majority
of school-based spending under devolved school management.
Yesterday's report is an introduction to the complex area of school costs, and
it carries 13 health warnings about interpreting the figures. But that did not
stop Mr Robertson from drawing attention to areas where the figures do not
stack up, at least superficially. He chose to highlight the higher per-pupil
costs of secondary schooling in Lothian region - as much as #7523 - compared
with Fife, at most #3071.
This, he said, was due to local policies, which in Fife's case means a
long-term commitment to large, well-utilised secondary schools. Of its 19
secondaries, Fife has only three with rolls of fewer than 800 pupils. The
Minister's reference to Lothian has more potential to mislead, since the school
with the quoted highest cost, Wester Hailes Education Centre, is one of several
community highs to which Lothian is strongly committed but which require high
budgets to offer programmes of extended provision, including wide access for
adults, and to address the needs of the deprived areas they serve.
If Mr Robertson finds a problem with these comparative costs, the solution from
his point of view seems to be close at hand, since it is clear from the first
year's budget guidelines for the new unitary councils that they will find it
extremely difficult to find the finance to maintain the social strategies which
have underpinned their whole policy framework for the last 20 years.
As the report points out, you will need to delve elsewhere for the many nuances
determining school spending which lie behind the raw data. The report shows
that, in primary schools, the average per pupil cost has gone up from #1656 to
#1724, while in the secondary sector it has risen from #2658 to #2708.
The tables show that Holyrood Secondary in Glasgow once again has the lowest
average cost, while the most expensive is Sanday Junior High School in Orkney.
However, another Orkney school - North Walls Junior High - would certainly have
had the highest per pupil cost but for the fact that its tiny roll exempted it
from inclusion in the tables.
The individual school calculations used in the document are based on the
budgeted running costs for financial year 1995-96. These include staff,
premises, supplies and transport costs, plus examination entry fees. Pupil
figures, however, relate to rolls at September 1994, which can differ
significantly from the anticipated rolls at September 1995 on which authorities
base their actual budgets.
Some of the most important factors which have to be borne in mind when
examining the tables include:
q.Bigger schools have larger total running costs, although they can spread
their costs over more pupils.
q.Large schools offer staff savings because of a higher teacher-pupil ratio.
q.Schools with rolls well below capacity tend to have higher overhead costs
because fixed costs, such as rates and heating, apply irrespective of the
degree of building use.
q.The age and condition of buildings affect expenditure on repairs and
maintenance.
q.Some education authorities provide extra staffing and resources to schools
serving areas of deprivation.
The danger in the raw data is therefore that, lifted straight from the page, it
does not compare like with like. Nor do any apparent discrepancies in cost
between schools of similar roll and age of building necessarily imply lack of
financial efficiency. Indeed, most schools already have a high degree of
responsibility for managing their budgets and by April next year this will
apply to all schools under DSM.
Much more useful guidance on using the school costs information is provided in
the foreword to this year's report by the retiring HM Senior Chief Inspector of
Schools, Mr Nisbet Gallacher. ``In order to make useful judgments,'' he
explains, ``school costs need to be set alongside other key indicators such as
the quality of the learning and teaching, pupils' progress, the ethos of the
school, attendance and, for a secondary school, examination results and the
destinations of its leavers.'' This not only places school costs within a
proper context but diminishes their significance as raw data. It also offers an
acknowledgement from the Scottish Office that no single set of statistical
information - including the annual report on examination results - offers a
complete picture of the quality of a pupil's school experience.
In this respect the current research on added value, funded by the Scottish
Office, which is seeking to determine what a school adds to the pupils it
inherits, appears to offer the best way forward.

MAGNIFICENT Mike Atherton was the hero of England yesterday after masterminding
cricket's version of the Great Escape.
He scored an undefeated 185 to lead his side to a remarkable second Test draw
against South Africa at The Wanderers.
And, when Atherton and courageous partner Jack Russell hugged each other and
saluted their cheering team-mates, he had been batting for 11 hours in all.
Keeper Russell, holder of a new world record after taking 11 catches in the
match, was only a short way behind his skipper in the order of outstanding
merit and they deservedly shared the man-of-the-match award.
Russell frustrated the South African bowlers for close on five hours while
contributing 29 to an unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 119. They survived a
chance apiece, but deserved the luck that came their way.
Atherton's innings - his ninth Test century and biggest yet - will go down as
one of the great rearguard actions. He offered a half-chance on 99 - Gary
Kirsten failing to hold a sharp catch at short leg off Allan Donald's bowling -
and he lost Robin Smith after 75 minutes of the morning session.
Although Atherton finished short of a double hundred, he had posted the highest
Test score at Wanderers, with the help of twenty-eight 4s and earned himself a
permanent place in cricket's hall of heroes.
When England resumed on 167 for four, the victory target of 479 could be
forgotten, but hopes of a draw remained so long as Atherton survived.
The skipper took nearly an hour to add the 18 runs required to complete a
century spanning 259 deliveries.
But Smith was clearly determined to be positive if the opportunity presented
itself. He hit eight boundaries but his attempt to add a ninth gave South
Africa the breakthrough.
Donald tempted the Hampshire batsman into a cut which was not properly
controlled and Pollock held a well-judged catch moving in from third man. That
ended Smith's 44-run contribution to a stand of 87.
South African tails were up, and Russell was lucky to escape next over when
gloving an attempted pull against Brian McMillan into no-man's land between
short leg and square leg. Then Meyrick Pringle failed to hold a waist-high
return catch when Russell tried to play through the leg-side.
After lunch, Russell knuckled down in his own inimitable fashion to give the
captain great support. At one stage after tea, with spinner Clive Eksteen
bowling, Russell was surrounded by six close catchers. But his response to that
over-crowding was to pull a short ball from the left-armer for 4.
Taking into account the home side's second innings, Atherton had been an
ever-present on the field for 19 hours when the match finished. Scoreboard:

Paris
PRIME Minister Alain Juppe stood his ground in a bitter confrontation with
trade unions today, vowing to press ahead with an overhaul of the country's
welfare system despite mounting unrest and widening strikes.
At an emergency meeting of his Cabinet, the conservative premier said there was
no question of holding a referendum or dissolving Parliament to settle the
crisis provoked by his controversial plans for reform and austerity.
Government spokesman Alain Lamassoure told a news conference after the meeting
that Juppe felt the strike action had now reached its peak.
``If we hammer home a number of truths often enough, the vast majority of
French people and many of those on strike today will realise that there are no
grounds for a strike,'' he said.
However trade unions hardened their stand, urging private sector workers to
join striking public employees and calling for mass demonstrations in big towns
and cities tomorrow.
Today's strike action hit the transport sector hardest, causing record traffic
jams around Paris. For the second successive week there were no trains, buses,
or Paris Metro services and thousands of electricity, gas, and postal workers
remained on strike.
Juppe's government stuck to its guns, insisting it would not back down on a
planned overhaul of social security combining higher taxes, health cost
controls, and later retirement for public employees.
The Prime Minister, who has made no public statement since last Wednesday, met
his Cabinet to discuss the snowballing unrest.
He was expected to break his silence in an address Parliament tomorrow during a
debate on a no-confidence motion tabled by the Socialist opposition.
Since the government has a four-fifths majority in the National Assembly, the
motion denouncing the proposed welfare reform has no chance of passing.
And in a boost to Juppe, an opinion poll today found that 51% of voters wanted
the government to stand firm against striking workers. That compared with an
earlier CSA poll which had shown 62% siding with the strikers.
However the French franc came under fire on the foreign exchanges today.
Dealers said financial market operators increasingly feared a long conflict
that would harm the economy and threaten government efforts to meet the
criteria for a single European currency in 1999.
Today the Paris region motorway network was saturated before dawn and by 2pm
there was a record 387 miles of traffic jams around the capital.
The government began hiring 1700 private buses to transport up to 100,000
suburban Paris commuters free but the substitute system was not expected to be
fully operational until tomorrow. A special free Seine riverboat service began
in Paris.
Six leading three-star hotels announced they were offering frustrated commuters
bed and breakfast for a big discount price.
The road chaos worsened during the day as some truck drivers joined the strike.
The Force Ouvriere trade union said some 700 to 1000 lorries were blocking or
hampering traffic on main roads around the towns of Troyes, Bordeaux, Grenoble,
Lyon, and Rouen.
Their action, along with a 24-hour stoppage planned by dockers at the
Mediterranean port of Marseilles tomorrow, looked set to disrupt freight
services further and deal another blow to the slowing economy.
In other sectors, the strike was followed by 19% of employees at the state
telephone company France Telecom, but by just 5% of post office workers.
Two unions called on secondary school teachers to join the movement from
tomorrow and employees of the airlines Air France and Air Inter were due to
start a 24-hour strike on Thursday.
The unions urged private sector workers to join public employees in protest
unless a controversial welfare overhaul is dropped.
``Now is the time, because today we are strong,'' Communist CGT union leader
Louis Viannet said. He accused the government of refusing to negotiate
seriously and urged workers to make tomorrow a ``new and powerful day of
action''.
``The Juppe plan must be withdrawn,'' he said. ``After that, we will
negotiate.''
President Jacques Chirac, saying France was at a crossroads, stood by Juppe in
a speech in the west African state of Benin, broadcast repeatedly on French
television. ``It is this path, the path of reforms too long delayed, that I
have chosen,'' he said.
In a radio interview today, the president acknowledged he was worried, saying
he was in regular contact with Juppe and was following the situation
hour-by-hour while attending a summit of French-speaking countries in Cotonou.
Socialist opposition leader Lionel Jospin called on the government to
``negotiate to find a way out and not give in to the temptation of a test of
strength''.-Reuter.

LECTURERS at The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, are heading for
confrontation with their management over a bid to switch from national to local
negotiations.
The lecturers, members of the Educational Institute of Scotland and the
Manufacturing, Science, and Finance Union, are prepared to invoke their
disputes procedure as a result of a management proposal to introduce contracts
for new staff which the unions claim mean a 25% increase in lecturers'
workloads.
The unions are prepared to fight to retain national negotiations and have
demanded the withdrawal of the contracts which have been described as ``the
worst contract in any sector in higher education in Scotland or England''.
Yesterday, EIS national officer Marian Healy and Mr Jim Cowan of the MSF met
the management, including the Principal, Dr David Kennedy, and demanded the
withdrawal of the contracts.
Ms Healy said: ``I told them our legal advice was that they could be challenged
in a court if they were to issue these contracts to new or existing staff.
``I also told Dr Kennedy that if he wished to discuss terms and conditions of
employment for staff at RGU he must do so at the joint national negotiating
committee. He told me that negotiating machinery was no longer legal because
the employers had withdrawn in 1994.
``However, it is again legal opinion that by virtue of the fact that the
managers and unions still continue to negotiate through this forum that it is
binding and legal. For the past two years, this collective machinery, albeit
operating on a voluntary basis, negotiated pay for all universities.
``They are now going to take away our legal opinions and have their legal
people check them. Presumably they will get back to us if they think there is
some way forward.''
A spokeswoman said last night the university regretted the unions'
unwillingness to accept the proposals for changes.
Dr Kennedy said: ``Both management and unions have agreed since 1988 that there
should be a move towards parity of conditions of service and salaries in the
higher education sector. However, repeated attempts to solve the issues
nationally have met with a single response from the unions - that agreement
should be at local level.''
He said the proposed changes would bring the university in to line with all the
pre-1992 universities. Academic staff taking up new appointments will receive
30 days and 11 public holidays. Existing academic staff will continue to enjoy
50 days and 11 public holidays.

EXCLUSIVE
LABOUR leader Tony Blair has agreed to include a Cabinet-level department for
international development in the party's election manifesto, dispelling
speculation that it might join the Ministry for Women among New Labour's
abandoned policies.
If Labour wins the next election, it will upgrade the existing Overseas
Development Administration, currently a branch of the Foreign Office, into a
full Government department with a team of Ministers and a Secretary of State.
As part of the measure, Labour also would create a Commons Select Committee to
oversee the department's activities and Britain's international development
programmes.
The new department would take over responsibility for international
environmental policy - including implementation of the Rio treaty - from the
Department of Environment, and World Bank negotiations from the Treasury.
At a private meeting last month with Shadow Overseas Development Minister Joan
Lestor, Mr Blair accepted her argument that Labour should give international
assistance a higher profile.
Mr Blair is understood to have been persuaded by the absence of any political
difficulties presented by the proposal. Unlike a Ministry for Women, it would
not require new funding to build it from scratch, nor is it ideologically
contentious.
Since his election as party leader last year, Mr Blair has imposed a rigorous
control on manifesto commitments. He has criticised the Tories for breaking
their 1992 commitments and does not want to leave a Labour government open to
the same criticisms.
A behind-the-scenes committee has been established to develop the idea. It will
have its first meeting next week and will be made up of MPs, former civil
servants, and a representative from Mr Blair's office.
One source said: ``This is a personal triumph for Joan Lestor. Given that we
have dropped our commitment to create a Ministry for Women, obtaining agreement
on this new department is an achievement.''
A commitment to introduce a Cabinet Minister for Women, with a full department
dedicated to ensuring that ``women's voices are heard at the highest levels of
government'', featured in the last manifesto. It was dropped earlier this year
because it was deemed to be too costly and too politically correct.
The manifesto also committed the Department for International Development to a
steady increase in the UK's aid budget over five years, from the current 0.31%
of GNP to the UN-recommended level of 0.7%. That commitment has also survived
the review.
Last week's Budget imposed a 6.7% cut in real terms over the next three years
on the ODA's #2.1 billion spending. In cash terms, the cuts will remove #124m
from the overseas aid budget next year.
Aid agencies and Opposition parties have condemned the Government for
sacrificing Britain's contribution to international assistance programmes for
the sake of politically-motivated tax cuts.
Labour described the scale of the cuts to the ODA's budget as an acceleration
away from the 0.7% goal. Overseas aid spokesman George Foulkes accused the
Government of breaking its promise in the Queen's Speech that a ``substantial
aid programme will be maintained.''

A spiritual experience on the night of her mother's funeral changed Carole
McLean-Smith's life for ever, as Victoria Freedman discovers
CAROLE McLean-Smith is not a peculiar, little old lady who spends her evenings
in a darkened room sitting around a table with other little old ladies, holding
hands and summoning up spirits. Yes, she is in communication with those who
have passed on, or popped off, as spiritualists say, but Carole would like to
dissolve that popular image of mediums and convey to more people the beautiful
philosophy of the Spiritualist Church.
The image of the seance sitter is, indeed, at odds with this well-groomed and
very attractive fashion model who was born into a life of ease in Newlands
50-odd years ago. She was brought up to believe in God and go to church, but
spent little time pondering about religion or the reason for her own existence.
Theology had no place in her life. As a child it was filled with Brownies,
choir, and school, as an adult with modelling, motherhood (she has a son,
Richard, now 26 and an actor) and marriage (four to date). Then in 1975, while
between marriages, Carole had a spiritual experience. On the night of her
mother's funeral she was sobbing noisily when she heard her mother's voice by
the side of the bed telling her to stop crying and to listen carefully.
Her first priority, she was told, was to look after her young son properly. She
should also go to the Spiritualist Church.
``The what?''
``The Spiritualist Church, dear,'' said the mother, who then assured her
daughter she was well, happy, and had been glad to go.
``I know it sounds peculiar,'' admits Carole. ``But it was my mum's voice, and
so real and so emphatic that I wasn't frightened and I didn't question it.''
Accordingly, she gave up her career to devote herself entirely to Richard and
set about finding the Spiritualist Church, a place she had not previously known
existed. The following Sunday she approached its front door, holding tightly on
to Richard's hand, fully expecting a congregation of crackpots.
``I sat at the back, praying, that the medium wouldn't come to me with a
message.''
Carole left the church still sceptical after the display of mediumship but
uplifted by the service.
``It was beautiful,'' she reminisces. ``There was a nice opening hymn, an
address, a healing minute where everyone sat in silence and threw their
thoughts out to people in trouble, because thoughts can be powerful, positive
waves, then another hymn and 20 minutes of mediumship.''
Carole began attending regularly, interested by the messages given by the
medium, certainly, but more impressed by the ``beautiful'' sermons. Inspired,
she began to live her life spiritually.
``I was always helping old ladies with their shopping. You really go overboard
at first because you want to love everybody. It took me some time to realise
that you can love everybody but you have to look after yourself as well.'' She
was soon immersed in the philosophy of spiritualism. Simplified, it is
concerned not with religion but with the progression of the soul. Life on earth
is to work towards a more evolved soul that is kind, tolerant, non-judgmental,
and all-loving. At the point of death, the soul leaves its carriage, the body,
and continues to exist at a different vibrational level.
``I found that my friends were very interested. Some of the more Christian
people thought it was the work of the devil, but they had terrible
misconceptions. They imagined us sitting round in circles `calling up the dead'
and saying `Is there anybody there?' But those expressions are simply never
used. We don't call up the dead. They call us.''
Carole was ``called'' three years later, by which time she had resumed her
career and was working on a cruise ship.
Although immediately open to her mother's survival, Carole was initially
reluctant to believe her first contact from an unknown spirit, a male voice,
urging her to pass on a message to a young man on board who was confused about
his career.
Nevertheless, she passed on the message and afterwards found that the spirits
would often contact her when she was in the company of someone who needed help,
leading her to work in her spare time as a medium.
Nearly 20 years later Carole continues to give sittings, free of charge, for
those who are troubled or have lost a loved one. She tunes in, like a radio,
she explains, and receives voices of relatives, or personal spirit guides,
frequently accompanied by a visual image in the form of a picture.
``I think if I saw the whole person I'd run a mile,'' she admits with a laugh.
Although contact with those who have popped off can be emotional, there is
lightness too. At a recent sitting, she says, a man came back to apologise to
the recipient for disbelieving in the afterlife and all the arguments it had
caused.
She found that such contact takes away the fear of death and comforts those who
are grieving when they hear that the dead person is fine, that messages from
spirit guides offer advice and hope during difficult times. It may be that
Carole's kind, concerned, and gentle voice is a solace in itself.
Personally, she says, her beliefs have helped enormously, seeing her through
marriage to a violent man, to a man who left her in debt, and two failed
marriages. She now lives in a council flat in East Kilbride, still in demand as
a model, but working only when energy allows, for she has suffered from ME for
the past eight years.
``I've had a horrendous life, but I now view everything in a spiritual way.
I've never once said `Why me?' or been angry with my ex-husbands. I used to be
quick-tempered and stamp my foot. I had no patience, no tolerance.
``But I am now incapable of being rude. If I was bitter and twisted because of
my marriages, or resentful and rude because I've got ME, it would work against
my soul. Instead, I feel I'm lucky.''
Carole is aware that she, and other mediums, have to provide sitters with
evidence of survival for them to believe in life after death, but she is
convinced that even without contact with the departed, many would benefit from
the ideals of spiritualism and enjoy the church services.
``I want to dissociate myself from fortunetellers who are in it for the money
or do it as a party piece. Spiritualism is different. It is a guiding force,
always encouraging, always beautiful. Try the Spiritualist Church,'' she urges.
``You'll be met with love.''

VOLLEYBALL
CITY of Glasgow Ragazzi get a first-hand look at top-level European volleyball
when they host Group 11 of the European Confederation Cup at the Kelvin Hall
this weekend.
University Club of Paris, Croatians Metalac-Olt Osijec, and Bulgaria's
Balkancar Tran Sofia are the rivals as Ragazzi rub shoulders with some of the
best talent in the game.
The University Club have won the French title 12 times and, coached by former
Dutch national team coach Harry Brokking, include Russian internationalist
Gennadi Tcheremissov and Canadian cap Bruce Edwards, as well as the two best
players France has ever produced.
Setter Alain Fabiani - rated as one of the best players in the world at his
peak - and Laurent Tillie have won a staggering 862 caps between them.
Ragazzi coach Tommy Dowens said: ``We have a 19-year-old setter Steve Linton
who can learn a lot from watching Fabiani. Our preparations have been hit by
injuries and work commitments, and we're not as well prepared as we should be.
But we'll video all the matches and we can learn a lot from this weekend.''
It is the biggest weekend ever for Scottish volleyball, with Kilmarnock playing
in Group 6 in Portugal. Also involved are hosts Castelo Da Maia, Hapoel Kfar
(Israel), and Medikemia (Hungary). Paul Carruthers, Allan Thomas and Scott
Russell, who all missed Saturday's defeat by Bellshill Cardinals, will set off
with Kilmarnock tomorrow.

NEW Labour has made it abundantly clear that it will abstain on the Budget vote
tonight, thereby allowing the Chancellor's 1p tax cut to go unchallenged. This
is a mistake and deeply depressing for those who believe that the task of Her
Majesty's Opposition is to oppose, not just on ideological grounds but on a
sensible analysis of the facts. That analysis has been made. Labour politicians
have enjoyed themselves over the past week picking holes in a Budget which is a
good deal more devious than it appeared at first glance. The logical extension
of their argument, for reasons which we will examine, is that the 1p cut in
income tax should be opposed. That will not happen; they will sit on their
hands because the phantoms and shadows which haunt New Labour are more
terrifying than the power of reason.
To be specific, New Labour is afraid of the reaction of the middle-class voters
which it pursues with such desperate intent. The received wisdom is that the
middle class will reject any party which puts up taxes, and by extension which
criticises tax cuts. This is a hangover from the terrible mess Labour made of
their tax proposals just before the last election, but if a whole series of
opinion polls is to be believed the middle classes would reject a tax cut if
essential services could thereby be maintained or improved. This isn't good
enough for the cynics. They believe that what people say to opinion pollsters
on this subject is reversed in the secrecy of the polling booth. That might
have been true a few years ago, but taxes and the uses to which they are put
are seen in a different light now. The link between taxes and the provision of
services is clearer than it has ever been. The middle classes (many of whom are
readers of this newspaper and who give us their views with force and
perception) are just as vulnerable as the rest of the population to the
diminution of these services. They know that tax cuts must be paid for by
cutting public expenditure, and they know equally that the derisory Public
Finance Initiative is unlikely to pour private money into provision, and that
even if it does the need for a healthy return on the investment will come back
to haunt us all.
Chancellor Clarke has argued that he did not cut taxes more energetically in
order that public services might be maintained. This is only partly true,
especially as the examples which he used illustrate nothing more than his
considerable ability for sleight of hand. The National Health Service will get
extra money, said Mr Clarke. So it will, but not nearly as much as he implied.
The actual sum is not clear but is believed to be in excess of #1billion. This
sounds impressive but is largely bogus, being composed mainly of money which
was already agreed or in last year's spending plans. Capital spending on health
is to be cut, with a Micawberish expectation that the PFI will make up the
difference. Much the same is true of education, that other plank-to-be of the
Tory election manifesto, which Mr Clarke insists will receive an extra #878m.
Again, this sounds good, but acquires the quality of ectoplasm when it becomes
evident that this comes at the cost of cuts in local capital spending or at the
expense of other local government services. Significantly, the 1p cut in the
basic rate of tax has cost the Chancellor #2billion in a full year. If he had
not made the cut that sum could have turned the illusory gains made by health
and education into genuine advances. The Labour Party should abandon its queasy
agnosticism on this matter and vote against the tax cut. In its heart of hearts
it knows that this is right. If the Liberal Democrats show the courage of their
convictions, why can't Labour?

SNOOKER
PETER Ebdon, losing finalist in the Royal Liver Assurance UK Championship at
the weekend, yesterday found out who his opponent will be in the first round of
the German Open in Frankfurt today.
India's Yasin Merchant will face Ebdon after a 5-0 victory over German Peter
Wagner in the preliminary round. Merchant had breaks of 62, 48, and 38 but
needed a blue-to-black clearance to complete the whitewash.
Of the wild-card invitations, only Belgian Ivan van Velthoven succeeded in
winning a frame. He did so against Englishman Dave Finbow, who rattled in
breaks of 84, 77, and 42 to complete a 5-1 victory and earn a first-round tie
against former world champion Steve Davis.

SWEEPING new powers for the local goverment Ombudsman to act as a watchdog
over
council staff appointments and to investigate complaints against individual
councillors are likely to result from the latest report into the way local
authorities are run.
The report, by a special task force, was commissioned by Mr Michael Forsyth a
mere 19 days after he took office as Secretary of State and marks the latest
episode in his sometimes turbulent relationship with local authority leaders.
It diplomatically avoids making any firm recommendations but clearly points
the
way to much closer scrutiny of the actions of local authority officials and
their political masters.
However, those same masters seemed unperturbed by the report's findings,
claiming that they expose the gulf between the sweeping allegations of
Ministers and what actually happens in practice.
In addition, where the report identifies areas which could be improved they
counter that local goverment is already addressing these.
The establishment of the task force followed the setting up of a public
inquiry
into a series of allegations about the way staff appointments were made at
Monklands District Council and ``jobs for the boys'' rows over the filling of
senior positions on some of the new councils.
An inquiry is also now to take place into appointments procedures at the new
North Lanarkshire Council. An announcement about who will chair it is expected
within days.
The task force's report states clearly that ``political, family, race and
religious, or factors other than merit'' have no part to play in the
appointments process. But it adds that it is difficult to devise any method
which can entirely guarantee such outcomes.
The report also suggests that the Scottish Secretary could be given wider
powers which would allow him to act more promptly in setting up an inquiry
over
complaints against a council such as in the case of Monklands.
It also puts forward possible options for raising standards in a number of
areas including tightening up the National Code of Local Government Conduct,
simplifying the way in which councillors declare financial interests, and
improving the financial monitoring of council ``arms length'' companies.
It proposes ways of making local government more open and accessible but it
also sees little wrong with the general conduct of councils on many issues.
It was this that was seized on by Cosla's Labour vice president, Councillor
Keith Geddes, who claimed Scottish local government had been given ``a clean
bill of health'' by the task force over the mechanisms used for monitoring and
reviewing its internal conduct.
Councillor Geddes said the report suggested ways of refining and improving
systems which were already in operation.
This was in sharp contrast, he claimed, to the sweeping statements about local
government in recent months from Mr Forsyth and his Ministers which had been
based on prejudice rather than on clear analysis.
He added: ``Much of what has been suggested in the report is already under
way.
For example, Cosla is currently preparing good practice guidelines on
appointments and we are already working with the Accounts Commission as
suggested in the report.''
Mr Forsyth said he regarded it as a priority to remove unnecessary constraints
from local government but it was then all the more necessary that local
authorities had to act responsibly and be properly accountable.
The task force had identified a range of options for ensuring that a proper
framework of checks and balances existed to support this.
``Allegations made about local authorities often prove to have no substance,
therefore it is as important for the credibility of local government that this
should be shown to be the case as it is to put wrongs right,'' he said.
The report was welcomed byScottish Labour leader George Robertson, who claimed
it had given support for
key Labour demands on good local government practice.
The report - compiled by Scottish Office and local government officials along
with Ombudsman Derrick Marks and Controller of Audit Robert Black - does not
make any definite recommendations but simply lays out a series of possible
options for change in the various areas which it examined.
On the currently high profile area of staff appointments the report says some
form of external adjudication for complaints is necessary but it is not
enthusiastic about the idea of a setting up a permanent staff commission to
oversee appointments.
A possible alternative, it says, is the extension of the Ombudsman's powers so
that he could investigate complaints from people applying for jobs who do not
have access to a council's own complaints procedures.
Looking at the Scottish Secretary's own powers to act if councillors default
on
their legal duties, the report says they are rarely used and the Monklands
and
even the more recent North Lanarkshire inquiries are the only instances in
recent years where the alleged default falls into area of conduct.
One option put forward would be to allow the Scottish Secretary power to set
up
an inquiry even if a legal duty had not been breached. Another option would
give the Scottish Secretary powers to order accused councils to commission
their own inquiries but they would have to be chaired by an independent person.
The report says that the National Code of Local Government Conduct requires
substantial review taking into account ``the Seven Principles of Public Life''
drawn up by the Nolan Committee.
There is a strong case, it says, that where a breach of the code results in
maladministration, the Ombudsman should be able to investigate even if the
complaint arises from the actions of a single councillor.
Another option put forward is  that the Ombudsman's powers should be widened
to
allow the investigation of the competitive tendering process within councils.
The report states: ``We understand that there have from time to time been
allegations that authorities did not follow fair and established procedures in
awarding contracts which could not be pursued through the courts or the
Accounts Commission.''
On the issue of councillors declaring their financial interests being
restricted over voting on matters which affect them, the report states that
the
existing rules work well.
But it suggests the present legislation could be simplified, laying down a
threshhold of #1000 above which interests must be declared and a member could
not take part in discussions or vote.
A section dealing with the Accounts Commission says the evidence suggests that
corruption or financial irregularity is not a widespread problem with councils
in Scotland.

WITH barely four months to go until its demise, Strathclyde Regional Council is
preparing to take the Scottish Office to court over a plan for #4m of water
services revenue debts to be borne by the succeeding 12 unitary authorities.
Although this possibility is enshrined in legislation, it appears Strathclyde
region has only become aware of it in the last week or so, and has responded
with the threat of a judicial review should the Scottish Office persist.
An angry Strathclyde Labour leader, Councillor Robert Gould, said yesterday:
``It's a late kick in the teeth and has been done without consultation. It's
putting a liability on to the unitary authorities for a service that they don't
operate.
``You would have expected, on the basis of equity, that this deficit would be
passed on to the new water authority.''
He added that if it were the Government's intention to write off water services
capital debt so that the new water authorities could start off with a clean
slate, then Strathclyde would be seeking a judicial review as to why capital
and revenue debt was being treated differently.
The #4m debt in question relates to reduced income from non-domestic water
rate, non-domestic sewerage rate, water meter charges, and water council tax.
What appears to have happened is that the consumption of water in those classes
of users has fallen. Big industrial firms are beginning to understand that
water is a costly commodity and they are taking more care over its use.
Consumption is also down because of a reduction in industrial activity.
In short, Strathclyde had budgeted for a certain levels of income from these
categories and the consumption had not met that projection.
According to council finance officials, the legislation was ``pretty silent''
on where these debts should be apportioned.
A senior official added: ``What's happening is, after discussions with the
Scottish Office, these balances are being passed to the new unitary councils
and not to the water authority, and that's where the problem arises.''
The leader of the Conservative group on Strathclyde region, Councillor Iain
Drysdale, said: ``I think this is an unfortunate situation, but if the
successor authorities are prepared to pick up the benefits of any surplus, then
these things are inevitably a two-way stretch.''
But a Scottish Office spokesperson explained: ``The legislation requires all
property rights and liabilities of the current regions and islands councils in
respect of water and sewerage to be transferred to the new water authorities.''

A CONSULTANT illegally aborted an 11-week-old foetus during a hysterectomy
operation on a childless woman, a court was told yesterday.
Reginald Dixon, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at the King's Mill Hospital,
at Sutton-in-Ashfield, in Nottinghamshire, performed the abortion when he
discovered during the operation that Barbara Whiten was pregnant.
Mr Simeon Maskrey QC, prosecuting, told Nottingham Crown Court: ``Mr Dixon
carried out a hysterectomy with her consent.
``During the course of the operation, he discovered what nobody had previously
appreciated, namely that she was pregnant. He could have stopped the operation
there and then. He could have decided to go no further.
``What he decided to do was to proceed with the hysterectomy in the knowledge
that it would have the inevitable consequence of terminating the pregnancy.
``He did it without her consent.''
Mr Dixon, from Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, denies unlawfully procuring
a miscarriage, a charge brought under the Offences Against the Persons Act.
Mrs Whiten, 35, was admitted to the hospital in 1993, for the operation to cure
endometriosis, a condition from which she had suffered since 1990.
Mr Maskrey said Mrs Whiten, who had two stepsons from her husband Michael's
previous marriage, did not want children at the time but did hope to have
children in the future.
When she was first admitted to the hospital, Mrs Whiten was examined by a
doctor but no internal examination was carried out and no-one realised she was
pregnant.
Mr Dixon first spoke to Mrs Whiten as she was being wheeled to the operating
theatre on the day of her operation. He claims she asked that he remove her
ovaries in the operation because she was reluctant to undergo future surgery.
However, Mrs Whiten claims she asked him to remove them only if they were found
to be diseased.
Mr Maskrey said that on the basis of this conversation, Mr Dixon decided to go
ahead with the termination, believing she did not want to endure further
operations.
He tried to contact her husband once the operation had begun and he realised
she was, in fact, pregnant. Mr Whiten could not be found and Mr Dixon discussed
the problem with the anaesthetist and consulted Mrs Whiten's medical notes
before deciding to continue with the operation.
Her notes reported she had tried to overdose herself in 1992 and was prescribed
drugs for depression.
Mr Maskrey told the jury this decision did not constitute an emergency, which
would therefore have made the operation legal.
The court heard that in his notes on the operation and in a letter to Mrs
Whiten's GP, Mr Dixon believed he was doing what his patient wanted.
Mr Maskrey said: ``It is not a question of whether she would have wanted him to
carry out the termination but whether the law allowed Mr Dixon to carry out the
terminaton.''
The case was adjourned until today.
Earlier, the court was told that Mrs Whiten was ``devastated'' when told of the
abortion the day after the operation.

BRITAIN'S largest manufacturing union, the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union, has elected its first left-wing president since Mr Hugh
Scanlon, now Lord Scanlon, retired in 1978.
Tyneside local official Davey Hall, 44, has broken the right-wing stranglehold
which developed after the introduction of postal balloting in the early 1970s.
When the ballot result was declared yesterday, it confirmed that Mr Hall had
romped home to succeed Mr Bill Jordan, who moved to a new post in Brussels a
year ago.
Mr Hall's victory by 74,060 votes against right-wing candidate Jackie Crystal,
also from Tyneside, makes him the union's youngest AEEU president and one of
the youngest TUC general council members.
Mr Hall said he wanted to give the AEEU a modern image.
``I have the opportunity to take our union forward into the next millennium,''
he said. ``All the hard work, time, and effort I injected into a gruelling
country-wide tour has been worthwhile. I was classified as the outsider but I
have overtaken everyone to win.''
He used to work at Swan Hunter Shipbuilders on the River Tyne, where he became
a shop steward before becoming Tyne district secretary of the union in 1988,
taking in the Sunderland district in 1993.
Despite his left-wing support he has been an active member of the Labour Party
for 20 years and is a supporter of Labour leader Tony Blair.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, the Scottish AEEU executive member who declined the left-wing
nomination in favour of the younger man, described the result as ``great for
the AEEU and great for the labour movement''.

THEY may have been celebrating on an open-top bus on Sunday, but Aberdeen's
Coca-Cola Cup heroes might be well advised to please their manager on a more
consistent basis or they may be asked to get on their bikes.
Roy Aitken is not the kind of manager, nor was he as a player, who dwells on
yesterday's news, and the league form of his team is causing him concern.
In the wake of the defeat by Partick Thistle on Saturday, Aitken has promised
that he will radically alter his squad if the team does not come up with
championship challenging performances in the next six weeks.
``We must show more consistency in our league results,'' he said. ``We are in
fifth place and I am looking for this to be improved quickly.
``I want a squad of players I can rely on from week to week. It is up to me to
recognise the ones who can and cannot do this. If they can't meet these
standards, they are no use to this club. If they can't handle the challenge
then obviously I must bring in players who can.
The former Celtic captain, a man well used to the demands of consistent play,
went on to point out that the next six weeks of the season are vital.
``Winning a trophy showed what it meant to the city, but the cup is history
now. It is time to move on and be contending in the league and the Scottish
Cup. Players must respond and show they can take a step further.''
While he makes these observations, the Aberdeen manager also concedes that the
dallying with relegation last season left an unfortunate legacy at Pittodrie.
``It is a constant education process after what happened last season,'' he
said. ``Players have got to get into my way of thinking, which will also take
time.
``It is going to be more difficult to get them to do it over 36 games in the
league. So far I have not made major changes, buying just two players. When
things are not working out, different permutations are tried, but you must have
real strength in depth to do this. At the moment I am still building towards
this.''
He is asking for wins in his next three home games, starting tomorrow night
against Kilmarnock, to produce a greater threat to the Old Firm.
Striker Scott Booth and midfielder Stephen Glass, missing against Partick
Thistle, seem certain to return. And Eoin Jess, taken off with a thigh strain
at Firhill, is making a rapid recovery.
KEVIN Gallacher, the Scottish internationalist striker, could earn a surprise
recall to the bench for Blackburn Rovers' final Champions' League fixture
against Rosenborg at Ewood Park tomorrow night.
Gallacher, who has not appeared in the first team since injuring a hamstring in
the season's opening game, has played and scored in three junior and reserve
games and could be drafted in as Rovers are down to 12 fit experienced players
- including two keepers.
Gallacher, who has played only two games since breaking a leg at Highbury in
February, 1994, could continue his rehabilitation in today's Pontin's League
game at home to Bolton.
THE all-seater stadium being built near Paris for the 1998 World Cup finals is
to be called Stade de France, thus ending weeks of debate within the country.
The 80,000 arena is being built in St Denis, just north of the capital, to
stage the opening match and the final.
ALEX McLeish was booked in Motherwell's 1-0 defeat by Hibernian in a Premier
Reserve League match at Easter Road yesterday.
The Motherwell manager played against a strong home side which included Andy
Millen, Joe Tortolano, Mickey Weir, and Gareth Evans. Mike Renwick scored the
only goal of the game after 31 minutes.
CHRIS Myers, freed by Dundee United, is on a fortnight's trial with
Dunfermline and played last night in the reserves against East Fife.
Stephen Glass: seems certain to return for tomorrow night's match against
Kilmarnock at Pittodrie.

BRITAIN'S Richard Burns closed to within five seconds of winner Tommi Makinen,
but still had to settle for third place after a thrilling climax     to the
Rally of Thailand              yesterday.
Burns, driving a Subaru, finished a second behind Kenneth Eriksson, putting in
a storming late effort after having failed to significantly reduce Makinen's
21-second overnight lead in yesterday's early stages.
Burns, third in last month's Network Q RAC Rally, expressed his dismay at
having to settle for that position again. ``To be just five seconds from
winning and to finish third after more than 168 miles is disappointing,'' he
said.
``It's been a great battle against Kenneth and Tommi - we've pushed each other
to the limit and I've thoroughly enjoyed it.''
Makinen's triumph helped his Mitsubishi team secure the Asia-Pacific
championship manufacturers' title.
q THE Pacific grand prix team have withdrawn from Formula One for financial
reasons. The team, who in February formed an alliance with Team Lotus, have
struggled to make an impact and failed to win a world championship point during
their two years in the sport.
Pacific's managing director, Keith Wiggins, said: ``We have tried hard to
establish our position in F1, but due to the difficult financial position we
have not been able to progress in the way we planned.''
The withdrawal of Pacific - whose 1995 drivers were Belgian Bertrand Gachot and
Andrea Montermini of Italy - leaves the world championship with only 11 teams,
and 22 cars for next year.

n.THE confectionary company which produced sweets such as Skullcrushers and
Munchy Maggots has gone into receivership. Choc-u-Luv, of Glenrothes, once
employed 500 people but its last 40 employees have now been laid off. ``It is

creditors will receive any dividend,'' said provisional liquidator Graham

n.TEXTILES group Coats Viyella has sold Compton Webb, part of its clothing
division, to a new company for around #11.6m. The company will be formed
through management buy-outs from Compton Webb and PUC, which used to be owned

The two businesses will be merged to form the new firm, which has received
backing from 3i, Murray Johnstone and the Midland Bank.
n.IT is all change at the top of international chemical company Courtaulds. At
the AGM on July 16, 1996, Sir Christopher Hogg will retire as non-executive
chairman and will leave the board. In addition, chief executive Sipko Huismans
is also retiring, after 35 years service.
After spending almost all their working lives in Courtaulds both men feel the
time is right to make way for their successors. Sir Christopher will be
replaced by Sir David Lees of GKN, already a non-executive director. Gordon
Campbell, currently deputy chief executive (operations) will become chief
executive.

THE direct descendant of the Englishman blamed for the most notorious of last
century's Highland clearances has been asked to hand over 90,000 acres of land
free of charge.
Mrs Betty Mackenzie put it straight to the Countess of Sutherland, whose
forebear, the first Duke of Sutherland, cleared 8000 tenants to make way for
sheep.
Mrs Mackenzie said: ``Why do you not give us the land for nothing.''
The duchess replied: ``Could you manage it?''
Mrs Mackenzie, clerk to the Skerray grazing committee, said yesterday: ``It was
an informal meeting and I thought I would take the chance to ask the countess.
After all, the estate next door at Melness has been offered to crofters for
nothing. She was very nice about it but I did not get a full answer.''
Yesterday, the countess, speaking from her London home, said: ``Yes, Betty
asked about the possibility of the crofts and crofting land being handed over
to the crofters free of charge. It is different from the Melness case, because
I have got family to consider. I have 12 grandchildren and eight of them are
boys. The rents question was a mistake and it was something I did not know
about. But everyone will be meeting in spring, when people have had a chance to
think about things.''
She insisted: ``Nothing has been ruled out.''
Last month, the 74-year-old countess stepped in to a rent row involving 130
crofters at Tongue, Borgie, and Skerray in the far north of Sutherland.
She vetoed plans by her son and heir, Lord Strathnaver, and factor Christopher
Whealing for massive rent increases.
The countess said : ``I am sensitive to local feeling.''

THE cruel financial pressures of the Depression tear a family apart: the father
sent to a state penitentiary, the mother to a brothel and the son to an
orphanage. The boy's sexual awakening coincides with his arrival at another
house of ill repute, the austere advice of his Boy Scout manual contrasting
sharply with the nightly chorus of bed-springs in the rooms around him. In his
innocence he falls for one of the working girls who refuses to take advantage
of him until, one way or another, true love wins out.
Not much of a story, but in Erin Cressida Wilson's poetic hour-long telling it
becomes a thing of beguiling appeal. The heightened language is beautifully
crafted, delicate and elegant; too spartan and too lucid to fall into
self-indulgence, and too much rooted in its earthy subject matter to allow it
to become whimsical.
Indeed there's a great tension between the brutal, functional language of male
sexuality at its most mechanical, and the romantic gestures of hope embodied in
typical Wilson images of melting ice, bursting cocoons and the lingering moon.
The microphones and overhead projections of Peter Mackie Burns's production
might suggest another bout of contemporary ``experimental'' theatre at its most
cliched, but in fact this is a supremely well-measured interpretation, not
afraid to be still and quiet, yet rarely losing the cool, clear momentum of the
dialogue, and getting much creative mileage from a tight budget.
I suspect it's too fragile a piece to make a long-lasting impression, but
seductive, slick and sympathetic performances from Molly Innes, Stephen
McCreadie and Joel Strachan ensure that every bit of its subtle charm is
present on the night.

DAME Edna Everage's week-long sojourn in Glasgow has three distinct sections.
In matching fashion, its constituent parts can be awarded three ascending
grades. A low C mark - C for cadaver, in fact - goes to Sandy Stone, a
mouldering representative of the undead who delivers a long, rambling, and
fatally-theatrical monologue about things not being what they were when he was
alive.
Old stalwart Sir Les Patterson earns a middling B: B for his heroic capacity
for burping, for his blotchy face, and his smut-peddlar's debt to St Benny
(Hill) and St Bernard (Manning). Hurrah for Sir Les's grotesque
trouser-contortions, his sprays of spittle, and his troupe of saucily-clad
nubiles! Double hurrah for his mirthful mis-use of the word pianist and his
description of his wife's haemorrhoid treatment!
But it's a treble hurrah and a big A grading for Dame Edna, who brought last
night's opening show to a rousing conclusion. A for Australian, of course. But
A for Audience-manipulation, too. For the mischievous Dame Edna plays an
audience as a spider plays with flies: spinning gauzy webs which make mincemeat
out of the unsuspecting.
Having swiftly gauged the status of the top balcony - ``paupers'' - Dame Edna
set her sights on the stalls. Second row, woman in a red dress, wide mouth:
``Don't stand on street corners, Letterbox.'' Directing a woundingly-innocent
inquiry towards Betty from Pollok: ``Pollok? Is that as nice as it sounds?''
Dame Edna's comedy of refined cruelty reached its apogee when young Eaglesham
bungalow-dwellers Ivor and Elaine were suddenly confronted with their manifest
failings in the baby-sitting department. Dame Edna Everage? Above average.

SCOTTISH textiles group Dawson International has plummeted in the estimation of
its sector stablemates to become one of the UK's ``least admired'' companies.
Among the pick of the crop in Scotland in their respective sectors, according
to a poll in this month's issue of Management Today, are Bank of Scotland,
Royal Bank of Scotland, ScottishPower, and General Accident.
The survey, which takes in the views of senior directors of the 10 largest UK
players in each of 25 sectors, is based on the premise that those best
qualified to assess a company's strengths and weaknesses are the senior
management of its direct competitors.
In each sector the directors were asked to rate their nine stablemates
according to nine criteria. Companies were judged on their quality of
management, financial soundness, quality of products or services, value as a
long-term investment, capacity to innovate, quality of marketing, community and
environmental responsibility, use of corporate assets, and ability to attract,
develop and retain top talent.
March's boardroom coup at Dawson, which has just moved its headquarters from
Edinburgh to Kinross, came too late to halt its spectacular fall in the eyes of
its peers.
In 1990, the textiles group was ranked second in its sector and 48th out of the
210 companies which were then included in the survey. By last year, it had
fallen to 212th position, out of 260. This year it was the sixth-least admired
company.
Dawson, which uses golfer Nick Faldo to promote its flagship Pringle brand, was
judged to have the best products and marketing back in 1990. This year, its
peers considered its marketing worst in the sector.
On a more positive note, the Scottish clearers have grown in the estimation of
their fellows banks.
``Big four'' bank Lloyds was held in the highest regard, followed by Bank of
Scotland, the most admired Scottish company in 57th position overall, and Royal
Bank of Scotland.
Lloyds, as a result of its merger with 213th-placed TSB, will soon be
registered in Edinburgh.
ScottishPower has the respect of the electricity sector. The Glasgow-based
utility, although down from 96th to 116th position in the top 250, was the
third-most admired electricity company behind English generators PowerGen and
National Power.
In insurance, Perth-based General Accident was ranked third behind Prudential
Corporation and Commercial Union.
Although not in the top three in their respective sectors, brewing giant
Scottish &amp; Newcastle, hotels and casinos group Stakis, and engineering group
Weir were all rated highly.
Cadbury Schweppes, which this year made its largest-ever acquisition in the
form of Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, was the most admired company in the UK. Rentokil,
which came out top last year, fell to 11th position.
Troubled conglomerate Trafalgar House registered the lowest score, with Channel
tunnel operator Eurotunnel not far ahead.

BANKS should take responsibility for their mistakes and stop blaming computer
errors, according to a consumer watchdog.
The National Consumer Council claimed yesterday that many banks had lost the
personal touch, and too often gave preferential treatment to customers not
experiencing hardships.
The council organised eight discussion groups in locations throughout England
to gauge customers' views on the financial services they received. It concluded
that there was a need for a free advice service to help people avoid financial
difficulties.
``Banks and insurance companies happily compete for new customers, but our
survey shows that their enthusiasm wanes once consumers experience money
problems,'' said council chairman Lady Wilcox.
``They provide an umbrella when the sun shines, but take it away at the first
sign of rain. We want to see the return of the personal touch to financial
services, and a new emphasis on the needs of people on low incomes and those in
hardship.''
The report says that banks should make more use of their knowledge of peoples'
personal circumstances. Customers who overdraw a day before their pay goes into
their account should not be sent a threatening letter - for which they have to
pay.
The consumer body said computers should also be programmed to ignore one-off
hiccups: ``We had so many complaints about this kind of thing,'' said a
spokeswoman.
q The Midland Bank has snubbed the Government over its plans to involve the
bank in backing student loans. Other financial institutions have also made it
clear that they are unlikely to join a new loans scheme.
They cite customer reaction and their fear of alienating students as future
customers among their reasons.

EVERTON and former Rangers striker Duncan Ferguson today will ask the Scottish
courts to allow him to make an immediate return to football.
Ferguson, who recently completed a three-month spell in Barlinnie for
head-butting former Raith Rovers defender John McStay, is seeking a judicial
review of the decision by the Scottish Football Association to suspend him for
12 matches over the same incident.
A full hearing of the judicial review is not expected to take place for some
time and, meantime, Ferguson will ask a judge at the Court of Session today for
recall of his suspension.
The player and his club feel that he has good grounds for challenging the SFA
ban.
Ferguson was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court in May this year for assaulting
John McStay during a Premier Division game between Rangers and Raith Rovers at
Ibrox in April 1994.
In October this year, three appeal court judges rejected his claim that the
sentence was excessive and Ferguson began his jail sentence.
The court was told that Ferguson had three previous convictions for assault and
was on probation for an offence when the Ibrox incident took place.
Lord Hope, the Lord Justice General, made it clear that the courts did not wish
to intervene in physical contact sports.
He added, however: ``When acts are done which go well beyond what can be
regarded as normal physical contact and an assault is committed, the court has
a duty to condemn and punish such conduct.
``A footballer who assaults another player on the football field is not
entitled to expect leniency from the court just because the incident occurred
in the course of a football match.''
The SFA ban, which had been suspended during the court proceedings, took effect
on Ferguson's release from Barlinnie last month.

THE industrial upheaval in France could affect the draw for the 1998 World Cup
qualifiers in Paris a week today.
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said: ``It would be foolish not to be concerned.
But the local organising committee know their backyard better than we do and
they tell us they can cope. However, if there is a deterioration of the
situation, there's likely to be a problem.''
Asked if FIFA had contingency plans to switch the draw or change the date,
Cooper added: ``All sensible organisations have contingency plans for what
might go wrong. But our plans are to stage the draw in Paris on December 12.''
FIFA delegations will arrive in France from tomorrow for meetings in advance of
the draw, which is being staged at the Louvre in the presence of French
president, Jacques Chirac.
A record 172 countries have entered the World Cup and the draw for the
qualifying competition will be televised live round the globe.

THE procurator-fiscal in Glasgow yesterday ordered a police investigation into
Saturday's Partick Thistle-Aberdeen football match in which Dons skipper
Stewart McKimmie was sent off for allegedly elbowing an opponent.
In a separate development, the Crown Office confirmed that it is considering
whether it should provide procurators fiscal throughout the country with
guidelines about incidents on the field of play.
The Glasgow fiscal's decision to ask Strathclyde Police for a report on
Saturday's game is the latest in a series of interventions by the criminal
justice system in football pitch incidents.
McKimmie, 33, was shown the red card just nine minutes into the game at Firhill
when he clashed with Partick's Callum Milne, who was booked for his part in the
incident.
The Aberdeen captain, who is a member of the Scotland squad and has won 36
caps, has been fined #500 by his club.
A spokesman for the fiscal's office said yesterday: ``We have asked the police
to supply certain information on the match at the weekend.''
The latest request from the Glasgow fiscal's office follows its demand for a
report on alleged on-field incidents at the Rangers-Aberdeen match at Ibrox on
November 11. Police inquiries into that game are continuing.
Yesterday, Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken refused to comment on police
investigations into Saturday's match.
He said the club would hold the same position it took after police inquiries
were launched following his team's match against Rangers last month.
The controversy over criminal law's relationship with sport has raged since
Duncan Ferguson made football history by becoming the first professional to be
jailed for an on-field assault on another player.
The Everton striker was released last month from Glasgow's Barlinnie Prison
after serving half of a three-month sentence for butting Raith Rovers player
John McStay in April 1994 while playing for Rangers.
Yesterday, The Herald asked the Crown Office to comment on reports that it was
preparing to issue a set of guidelines for fiscals. A spokesman said: ``The
Lord Advocate is considering whether to issue guidance to procurators fiscal
and chief constables. He intends to discuss some of the implications with chief
constables.''
Broadcaster Jock Brown, who is a sports law consultant with the Glasgow-based
Harper Macleod legal firm, said yesterday: ``I am entirely in favour of
guidelines because there is great uncertainty right now. There is also the
question of consistency among different regional procurators fiscal.
``I hope those guidelines distinguish between on-the-ball and off-the-ball
incidents, and leave the former to the referee and the SFA to sort out.''
McKimmie's red card at Saturday's Firhill game means an automatic one-match
suspension and he will miss tomorrow's Premier League game against Kilmarnock
at Pittodrie. It is understood the SFA is unlikely to punish McKimmie further,
given the immediate action of the referee and the swift response of his club.

The fiftieth Fringe should be the biggest yet, says Mark Fisher, who learns of
a drive worldwide to encourage everyone andtheir auntie to perform
NOT content with presiding over the biggest arts festival in the world,
director Hilary Strong seems determined to make the Edinburgh Festival Fringe
even bigger. If that isn't quite her intention as she continues a programme of
international travel in the run up to the 50th birthday of the city's three
oldest festivals, it will more than likely be the result.
The Fringe has long had a practice of holding meetings every year in London to
explain the whys and wherefores of the event to would-be performers from
England. Strong's predecessor, Mhairi Mackenzie Robinson, also visited the
United States towards the end of her tenure to explain the set-up to companies
over there. In this same spirit, Hilary Strong has recognised that the further
performers have to travel, the less likely they are to understand the workings
of Edinburgh's unique free-market cultural jamboree, and she's given herself
the task of seeking out artists the world over to tell them what they're likely
to lose and gain by performing in the Scottish capital.
With 49 Fringes under our belts, it's easy for those of us living here to take
the event for granted. The Fringe is the Fringe, it happens because it happens,
and its thrill is its unpredictability. But Strong and her team working year
round know there's rather more to it than that and, without wanting to dull its
wayward spirit, they can see there's room for improvement. Strong's watchword
is accessibility - for performers and public alike - and she recognises that
the finer points of a festival that is both spontaneous and organised, that is
free as long as you pay for your place in the programme, your venue hire and
your accommodation, are not the easiest to come to terms with.
That's certainly what she found on a recent trip to Poland, her first venture
into Eastern Europe, where the culture gap makes the Edinburgh Fringe look even
more of a curious phenomenon than it already is. For the average Polish artist,
festival participation only comes about after receiving an official invitation
to perform. The idea that both the initiative and the financial risk might be
borne by the performer is hard to get to grips with.
After the penny had finally dropped at one of the Polish meetings, one
participant explained to Strong that to call the Fringe a festival was simply
too confusing to Eastern Europeans - a better description, he said, would be
that it was like going to a market and hiring a table, and the amount of money
you had to spend determined the size of table you could afford. ``We had to use
that analogy so they could understand what we were talking about,'' says
Strong. ``But although a lot of these companies find the whole thing bizarre,
many of them want to come to do it.''
Strong has identified Eastern Europe, and Poland in particular, as the place
most in need of clear information about Edinburgh. That the standard of work
coming out of this area is exceptionally high has been ably demonstrated in the
Fringe programmes of Richard Demarco and Tomek Bork of Edinburgh Venue
Associates - both of whom got involved in Strong's Polish trip. But by opening
up better lines of communication and providing the full administrative
resources of the Fringe Society itself, Strong believes that both the companies
and Edinburgh can be better served.
``The most important thing about Poland was to come away with registration
forms for companies that could then be in direct contact with the Fringe,'' she
says. ``That was achieved. I don't think there's anything wrong with puffing
the Fringe because we know that when it does work it's a great experience for
them. Most of the problems that we've had in the past relate to Eastern
European companies that have come to the Fringe without having direct contact
with us. In every situation that goes wrong it's because we don't know about it
in advance, whether it's a British company, an American company or whatever.''
On this particular trip Strong travelled to Krakow and Warsaw, meeting
representatives from theatre companies, the British Council, the Ministry of
Culture, Visiting Arts (an organisation dedicated to giving financial support
to artists journeying to Britain), and from civic arts officers. Reactions
varied from the enthusiastic to the indifferent, making Strong aware that her
role falls somewhere in-between the supportive and the proselytising. She is
not a programmer and is in no position to invite artists to the Fringe, but she
can make things easier for those who want to come, and she can sing Edinburgh's
praises to those who need to know more.
It's a policy she hopes to continue over the next two or three years. She held
one meeting in the US before this year's Fringe and she'll take the opportunity
of a private holiday in New York later this month to hold another one there. In
Eastern Europe she's got her eye on Moscow, St Petersburg, Minsk, and Kiev, and
after that she'll move on to Western Europe.
``A lot of companies from France, Germany, Italy, and Spain will take the view
that it's perfectly OK to go to the Avignon Off, but not to the Edinburgh
Fringe, and we have to challenge that view. I think it's probably the language
question. A lot of people ask me if it's a problem doing a show in a foreign
language, and the answer is no - obviously it's a slightly minority audience,
but in Edinburgh more than anywhere people are prepared to go through that.''
With all this travelling on the cards, Strong inevitably has language barriers
of her own to overcome, but she reckons she's at least stumbled upon the one
off-hand remark that can raise a smile in any language. ``The best thing was I
discovered my standard joke that works in every language,'' she says. ``I say,
`Anyone can come to the Fringe, even your auntie,' and that always gets them
laughing.''

LOWER fuel bills are expected to follow the launch in Edinburgh yesterday of a
computer program to measure energy efficiency of homes.
The National Home Energy Rating Scotland is based on the Building Research
Establishment's Domestic Energy Model.
NHER(S) can take account of higher winds and lower temperatures in Scotland,
and consider different building materials an methods of building. It will
recommend ways of improving energy efficiency in existing properties or new
homes.
NHER(S) works on a scale of 0 to 10, where 10 is the most energy efficient
home. The average NHER(S) in Scotland is 3.3, compared with the UK average of
4.3.

IT is a pity, writes Stuart Paul, that the issue of corporate governance - the
way in which companies are directed and controlled - only came to prominence in
the UK in the wake of a string of well documented corporate disasters.
Remember Polly Peck? the shameful fate of Maxwell pensioners? you can add your
own favourite to this sorry catalogue.
The debate on governance was further fuelled by the role, many argue the
ineffectual role, of non-executive directors in the light of huge rises in
boardroom pay.
Are ``non execs'' an essential part of an effective checks and balances system
in the boardroom? an essential link between the shareholders and the full-time
directors who run the business? or are they simply toothless tigers picking up
handsome fees for occasional attendance?
Whatever your viewpoint the debate on corporate governance will be of interest
to everyone who is concerned that our great companies should be well managed.
It is appropriate that, following hard upon the appointment of the new
committee on corporate governance, we look at recent books on the subject. Our
reviewer is Aileen Beattie, above, director of accounting and auditing at the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland.
HARDLY a day seems to go by without reference being made in the press to
corporate governance issues.
However, some influential figures have recently expressed the view that
excessive emphasis is being placed on the subject, not only in the press but in
business in general. So are we in danger of losing sight of the benefits of
good corporate governance under a raft of rules and regulations?
There can be no doubt that the UK's first committee on corporate governance,
the Cadbury Committee, was badly needed to restore confidence in our corporate
governance framework, but its newly formed successor (chaired by Sir Ronald
Hampel) must tread a careful path between improvement and overkill.
In addition to any guidance which may emerge from the Hampel Committee,
directors can, of course, strive to improve their performance and understanding
of their role by recognising the importance of continuing professional
development.
Research published in April this year by the Institute of Management considers
this point. In Coming on Board - the non-executive directors' role in
strengthening boardroom leadership*, Patrick Mileham states his belief that by
definition, non-executives are generalists who should not normally view their
job as a specialist function. However, corporate governance and what one might
call advanced directorship knowledge and competencies are increasingly expected
of them.
This research revealed a strong consensus in favour of the training and
continuing professional development of all directors, but with non-executives
requiring training to cover strategy, regulatory matters and generalist
subjects.
The concept of whole board training and development was considered to be of
value, although this is likely to prove one of the most challenging areas for
those providing the training.
All in all, this is a book which any potential or current non-executive
director would find helpful when striving to identify what exactly their role
should be. It also has the obvious advantage of covering UK issues, much of the
literature is geared to the US market.
One such recently published book is, however, worth dipping into for an insight
into the American experience of corporate governance, Corporate Governance* by
Monks and Minow, though intended primarily as an academic text, is an extremely
comprehensive yet readable analysis of the subject.
The authors are well-known US scholars and activists, a combination of talents
which flow through into the book in their ability to bring the theory to life
by use of ``case in point'' examples.
The technique used is to address a theoretical issue, give an example, ask the
reader to form a view and then probe further by asking ``would your view have
changed if . . . ?'' This is a very effective way of making the reader think
about the issues rather than merely read the book. A UK version of this book
would be a useful training tool for directors.
The book also includes a chapter on international governance, which is very
much an up and coming topic. Indeed, I have recently been involved in working
for the International Capital Markets Group (ICMG) to produce a book called Who
holds the reins?*
ICMG, a joint-venture of the international bodies of lawyers, accountants and
stock exchanges, recognised that with the advancement of multinational listings
on stock exchanges worldwide and interest being taken in foreign markets by
institutional and private shareholders, there was a need to consider the
international dimension to corporate governance.
The book concludes that no attempt should be made to prescribe an international
standard for corporate governance, as the frameworks used around the world were
so deeply engrained in the cultures of the countries. Instead, major companies
should be encouraged to disclose key areas of their corporate governance
processes to enable international investors to understand the differences and
to take account of them in their decision-making.
The key to these proposals is that, to be competitive, companies need to be
dynamic and progressive. Corporate governance should not restrict such
dynamism, but rather give it direction.
Hopefully, future improvements in corporate governance worldwide will heed
this, but there is always the danger that books such as the ICMG one, which put
forward recommendations, will sit and gather dust on a shelf. Let us hope that
this will not be the case.
So, as corporate governance is still obviously alive and well, we will continue
to draw on books such as those mentioned here to help us develop our thinking
on a subject which is of importance to national and international companies
alike.
*Coming on Board by Patrick Mileham. *Corporate Governance by R Monks &amp; N
Minow. *Who holds the reins? by ICMG.

IN the space of a few days in October, Dunedin Fund Managers lost its chairman,
its deputy chief executive, the heads of its European and Pacific operations,
and its Chicago-based marketing director.
Not surprisingly, three United States clients have upped sticks as a result of
the debacle.
Following the departure of another six fund managers yesterday, British Linen
Bank chief executive Eric Sanderson is sure there is nothing more to emerge
from what has turned out to be a Pandora's Box. Only time will tell what damage
has been done.
No doubt, Mr Sanderson will be worried by the rumblings from the board of
Edinburgh Investment Trust, which has a major stake in Dunedin. However, it
would seem any or all of the investment trusts would only seriously consider
defecting to another fund management outfit as a last resort.
With the backing of a giant in the form of Bank of Scotland, it is unlikely
that Dunedin will be allowed to fall further from grace. If it had been an
independently-quoted investment house, the dangers would have been far greater.
Mr Sanderson had to sort out the astonishing rifts which opened up as a result
of the departure of investment director Gordon Anderson and could not be
accused of having left the job half done.
The key now is confidence. Dunedin's clients need a signal that it is back on
track. The Bank of Scotland may yet have to take the bull by the horns and
expand Dunedin through acquisition.
Market fizz
THE #425m purchase of Courage by Scottish &amp; Newcastle appears to have been
timed fortuitously as the UK beer market may be struggling back to its feet.
That is despite the depredations caused by the imports through Calais. There
are also indications the pub trade is showing some growth, partly because of
the success in attracting women to themed outlets.
But there is a pronounced north-south divide. Courage volumes in the three
months under S.&amp;.N control jumped 7.5%, whereas the core S.&amp;.N operations were
up by just 1%. The net result was flat S.&amp;.N brewing profits with the #9m
uplift in divisional operating profit due entirely to Courage - and so it seems
likely to continue.
There are indications of some improvement in consumer confidence, particularly
in the South of England if the rise in Courage volumes is a reliable guide,
although that was in part weather related with outside drinking and the
availability of pub gardens much commoner, for obvious reasons, than in
Scotland.
Market reaction to S.&amp;.N's half-time results was somewhat negative, attention
focusing on the rationalisation costs which were #50m higher than expected.
That seemed more important than the #75m of annual savings, which were almost
twice initial calculations.
With a beer market share up to 30% according to some calculations and 25% on
S.&amp;.N's own reckoning, the pressures imposed on the sector by the four industry
leaders, Scottish Courage, Bass, Carlsberg Tetley, and Whitbread, will increase
the need for the smaller operators to consolidate or else change their spots to
become pub companies - Greene King and Vaux are the most likely. Bass will not
sit back as quietly as it has in the last two or three months for much longer.
And what price for Center Parcs now? Again profits were flat in local currency
terms and there seems no rush to add to the existing portfolio with little
being said about new openings. Under S.&amp;.N ownership, it has so far done very
well. Its parent's corporate strategy has been the most successful in the
industry in the past decade but it may be time to move it on.
Fiery Forte
GRANADA came out of the traps running in its bid for Forte, mostly thanks to
the dynamic strategy of its chief executive and chairman elect Gerry Robinson.
The Forte track record is scarcely a major defensive asset for a company under
siege but there may be something of a sea change under way although it is still
early days.
Forte's statement yesterday that it was putting high profile assets up for sale
is the first thing of substance it has said since the bid was announced.
However, there are still many mountains to climb and paths to follow into dense
undergrowth which may well lead to unexpected places.
It would have been fascinating to have been a fly on the wall when the decision
was taken to sell the Savoy stake. So painfully acquired over eight years as
the Forte's passport to the highest echelons, it is now to be sold to fend off
the pressing attentions of another motorway cafe owner.
Savoy now has a market value of about #230m but a street price somewhat lower,
even if the Barclay Brothers did pay #75m for the Ritz. Altogether, the 68%
owned hotel company, the roadside restaurants, the White Hart and Travelodge
businesses should raise about #1450m and will seriously dent the projected
Granada cash flow that is expected from its disposal programmne of Forte assets.
In a term that Mr Robinson may live to regret, he said that hotels were simply
repetitive business, something which patrons of the luxury end of the market
will not forget.
So far Granada has said nothing of substance - only sound bites. It will need
to seize the initiative again soon or else it could start being pushed
seriously on to the defensive.

SARA Thornton, jailed nearly six years ago for killing her alcoholic husband,
had snapped after a long period of drunken abuse and should not have been
convicted of murder, the Court of Appeal heard yesterday.
Evidence not used at her trial showed her suffering from ``battered woman
syndrome'' which could cause someone to lose self control and act in the heat
of the moment, making her guilty of manslaughter but not murder, said Mr
Michael Mansfield QC, for Thornton.
An expert witness had stated that the wives of alcoholics ``lived on the edge
of a volcano'' and could easily snap as a result of a culmination of
provocation over a long time.
Sexual taunts - such as those levelled by Malcolm Thornton on the night he died
when he called his wife a whore and threatened to kill her if she had been
selling her body - were particularly hurtful to such women and caused deep
emotional wounds.
Thornton, 38, of Atherstone, Warwicks, was jailed for life in February 1990 for
murdering her husband, a former policeman, with a single blow from a kitchen
knife as he lay drunk on a sofa.
Her original appeal was rejected in 1991 when judges refused to quash her
conviction or even reduce it to manslaughter on the grounds of provocation
before the killing. The court held there had been no ``sudden and temporary
loss of self-control''.
However, her case was referred back to the Court of Appeal by Home Secretary
Michael Howard in May this year and she was released on bail, pending appeal,
on July 28.
The case highlighted the issue of women driven to kill by repeated abuse. Other
women convicted of domestic murder have since been freed.
Mr Mansfield told Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, sitting with Mr Justice
Hidden and Mrs Justice Ebsworth, that Thornton's trial lawyers put forward a
defence of diminished responsibility because she was suffering from a
personality disorder.
The issue of prior provocation and its effect on her had not been investigated
fully.
In one of a series of exchanges with Mr Mansfield, Lord Taylor said that if
Thornton had snapped and suddenly lost control, one would have expected some
remorse afterwards.
Instead, she told police: ``Let the bastard die.'' She spoke also about having
sharpened the knife.
Mr Mansfield replied that, according to expert witnesses, such responses were
consistent with ``dissociative behaviour'' by someone not wishing to face
reality.
In fact, Thornton did show remorse. When told her husband had died, she said:
``Oh my God. I loved him so much.'' She told how she had tried for a year to
save him from excessive drinking and said she could not believe she had killed
him.
Lord Taylor stressed that to establish manslaughter rather than murder, there
had to be sudden loss of control - the court had said in an earlier case that
this requirement could be removed only by Parliament.
He said: ``Selecting a knife, sharpening it, and then doing the act seems more
like vengeance.''
Mr Mansfield replied that, if that was really what happened, the question arose
whether Thornton took the knife to defend herself against possible violence
from her drunken husband and then used it under provocation.
``The evidence indicates that the type of provocative conduct issued by this
victim would plainly upset, anger, and provoke a woman with a personality
disorder and with the history of a battered woman,'' he said.
The hearing continues today, when Crown counsel will oppose the appeal.

A FORMER chairman of Dundee Football Club has lost his bid to be reinstated as
a lawyer.
Three appeal court judges have ruled that the Scottish Solicitors Discipline
Tribunal was fully entitled to order that Mr Andrew Drummond be struck off the
roll of practising solicitors for professional misconduct.
Mr Drummond was found guilty of unreasonable delay in handling clients' trusts
and winding up estates, failure to provide accounts, and delay in transferring
assets to beneficiaries. He was also found guilty of misleading the Law Society.
Mr Drummond, who practised under the name of Drummond Robbie and Gibson in
Dundee, argued that his conduct did not justify such an extreme penalty, in
view of the effect on his livelihood.

OF all the performers who mattered to Alexander Gibson, Janet Baker was surely
the one who mattered most. First in Cosi fan tutte, then in The Trojans and Der
Rosenkavalier, she helped him to establish Scottish Opera as a company with its
own proud personality, at a time when every production was both an event and a
triumph, and famous singers found themselves lured into roles they had never
tackled before.
Tonight Dame Janet will be back in Glasgow to pay tribute to a conductor who
clearly mattered as much to her as she to him. Who would have expected this
most serious of opera singers to be a success in comedy, turning Mozart's
Dorabella, the giddier of the two sisters in Cosi, into a portrayal delicious
in its comic timing?
Dido, in Berlioz's epic opera, was more obviously her scene, but even in this
role she startled her audiences with the sustained intensity of expression she
brought to music in which she indelibly charted the tragic queen's progress
from love to death.
As Octavian in Strauss's Rosenkavalier she portrayed, no less tellingly, a
different sort of love and Sir Alexander found that he had drawn from her yet
another of her precisely focused characterisations.
What was it - I asked her last week - that made their operatic partnership work
so well? All singers have their favourite conductors, but Gibson, she says,
earned her ``absolute admiration'' in his handling of the balance between stage
and pit. ``He looked after our voices in the most instinctive way and with a
constant understanding of their size and quality. He had this special ability
to underpin a musical line without diminishing it. It was the art of
accompaniment and it's becoming a lost art.''
Dame Janet last met Gibson in the autumn of 1994 when he was conducting a new
production of Tosca at the London Coliseum. Again, she says, she was aware of
``his grasp, his relaxed and understated control in the pit, his ability to
nurse the singers the way they should be nursed. You seldom hear operatic
conducting like it''.
His personality, she claims, was of the most special nature. ``I would have
done anything for Alex, so inspired was I by his enthusiasm. I was prepared to
make any effort to be with the company as much as I possibly could, for he had
this remarkable ability to attract people who would work for the idea rather
than for stardom.''
Does she believe he fulfilled himself? ``In many ways, yes - though after the
first years of adulation, being a prophet in your own country can place you at
a disadvantage. It would be criminal if Scotland forgot his contribution. New
faces are right and necessary, but nobody did for Scotland the things that Alex
did.''

<TEXT>
DUMBARTON will appeal against the five-match suspension on keeper Ian McFarlane
imposed last week by the SFA, and that will allow the player to make a comeback
for the struggling first division side on Saturday against St Mirren while
waiting for a hearing.
The Boghead club are upset at the severity of the punishment imposed on
McFarlane, red-carded twice for the one incident against Airdrie. Referee
George Clyde reported him for allegedly headbutting and throwing a punch at
striker Jim McIntyre.
McIntyre had suggested that it was ``handbags at 10 paces,'' but the McFarlane
punishment means that he will be out for eight games.
The keeper has already served the automatic, three-match ban from the offences,
but still has the additional five matches imposed to sit out.
Meanwhile, newly signed keeper Ken Meechan, from Greenock Juniors, will play
tonight for Dumbarton as they return to Tayside to face Dundee.
Meechan comes in for 17-year-old Peter Dennison, but manager Jim Fallon
stressed yesterday: ``That decision was taken before we lost eight to Dundee
United on Saturday. We do not want to ask too much of Peter, for he is still a
young lad.
``I cannot blame him for what went on during Saturday's game. He had
experienced players in front of him, but their defending was shocking.''
Fallon will make other changes, but admitted: ``We do not have a big pool of
players so it is very difficult. I will move things around, but these are the
same players who won us promotion last season. It will be difficult going back
to Tayside so soon, but it is a different game and a different team we face, so
it is up to us to lift our game.''
Meantime, Dundee are set to hand midfielder Gary McKeown the chance to help
them go top of the first division promotion race tonight - and prove to himself
that the age of miracles has not passed.
The former Arsenal player, out for 15 months with a series of major knee
injuries, returned to the side as a substitute as Dundee won 2-1 at Paisley on
Saturday. Manager Jim Duffy hinted last night that McKeown's passing style
could be a crucial factor against Dumbarton, with Dundee needing a win to edge
in front for the first time this season.
``It would be superb to have the chance of being involved in a game like this
after what I've been through over the last couple of years,'' said McKeown.
``There were times when I wondered if I would ever play again as I lay in a
hospital bed with drips sticking out of my knee. Saturday meant a lot when I
played the second-half and my aim now is simply to try to make a challenge for
a first team place.
``There is still a long way to go in this promotion race, but going to the
front would mean the others would have to try to knock us off the top for a
change.''
And McKeown believes that could take some doing. ``We didn't play well against
St Mirren and can be more pleased with the result than the performance, because
we spent most of the time defending after I came on. But we did show
character.''
McKeown also revealed he was never allowed to feel too sorry for himself during
his injury ordeal. ``I spent a lot of time working with a couple of other lads
with long-term injuries while I was trying to get back.
``One of them - Dougie Bell - has had to give up the game and the other -
Gordon Tannock - has just undergone his tenth operation. So I really have
learned that there is always someone worse off.''
Dundee will still be without winger Neil McCann tonight, and player-manager
Duffy also is ruled out. His place in defence will go to Roddy Manley, who has
shaken off his latest knee problem.

CELTIC supporters were up before dawn yesterday as they prepared to pay tribute
to one of their favourite sons.
Manchester United will be the visitors to Parkhead a week tonight in a
lucrative testimonial for Celtic captain Paul McStay and, as tickets for the
big night went on sale yesterday, queues were already forming at the Glasgow
ground.
``The first fans arrived at one o'clock in the morning,'' said Celtic spokesman
Peter McLean. ``By 8.30 the queues were stretching down the street and that was
still three hours before the tickets were due to go on sale.
``I think this is an indication of the huge emotion that Paul's bond with
Celtic provokes among supporters - and the excitement surrounding a visit by
Manchester United.''
Celtic are hoping to be given the green light later this week to open a
temporary stand at the currently two-sided ground to push the capacity for
McStay's testimonial to more than 37,000.
The 3000-seater structure has been unable to open for several weeks because it
has failed to receive the necessary safety certificates.
Tickets for McStay's testimonial are priced #12 for adults and #5 for children
and OAPs so the Scotland star looks set to rake in close to #400,000 from the
match. He joined the club on February 20, 1981.
Meanwhile, a testimonial is planned for Mike Galloway, who has recently fought
back from a life-threatening car crash during the summer.

MILES Maclagan and Michele Mair have emerged at the top of the Scottish
rankings.
Maclagan, who reached the second round at Wimbledon and made his Davis Cup
debut for Britain in July, replaces Ross Matheson as men's No.1 after a
productive year on the Challenger and Satellite circuits.
Matheson is No.2 with Jason Barnett, still chasing his first world ranking
after two years on the full-time trail, one place further back, displacing Ken
Wood by virtue of having a better British rating.
Mair, ranked 453 in the world and No.15 in Britain, confirmed her place at the
top of the women's list when she won the Du Pont national championship in
August without dropping a set, but Jennifer Duncan, the world No.935, drops to
third place behind Heather Lockhart.
The Scottish grass and hardcourt champion teamed up with Mair to win the four
nations' international in September, and despite having no listing on the WTA
computer, she has a higher British rating than the Dundee teenager.
Tayport's Nicola Payne, who tops the junior girls list for the first time,
makes her first appearance on the women's rankings at No.4.
Heading the 16-and-under lists are double Scottish junior champion Jonathan

EXACTLY a week after the anniversary of Raith Rovers' finest hour, when they
won their first major trophy in the club's 112-year history, the Coca-Cola Cup,
manager Jimmy Nicholl was feted in Glasgow yesterday as the Scottish
Professional Sports Photographers Association personality of the year.
The former Manchester United, Rangers, and Northern Ireland player managed to
keep his team on such a high after that magnificent achievement that they won
the first division championship, made it through to the second round of the
UEFA Cup, and are currently fourth in the premier division.
Nicholl was presented with his award at a lunch in a Glasgow hotel where the
main speaker was another famous Fife manager, Jim Leishman, the ex-Dunfermline
leader who is now inspiring Livingston at the top of the third division.

Nicol turns back
on Scottish title
HAVING turned down selection for the recent world team event, Peter Nicol has
decided not to defend the Scottish championship at Heriot Watt University in
Edinburgh next week.
The 22-year-old is in India preparing for the Mahindra International, but his
London-based manager, Neil Harvey, said yesterday: ``Bombay is the end of a
long tour and Peter reckons he needs a rest.''
Scottish champion for the past three seasons, Nicol was on course to equal Mark
Maclean's record of four successive wins.
Having dropped in the world rankings following a summer operation, it was the
pursuit of glory in Super Series tournaments that prompted Nocol's absence from
the world event. He showed a return to form by reaching the semi-finals of last
week's Qatar International before going out to world champion, Jansher Khan.
However, failure to enter the Scottish championships without explanation to the
governing body must have raise doubts over his presence at the European
championships at the end of the season.
Ironically, his father, Pat, is the sole selector and manager of the Scottish
team.
On a positive note, Scotland's No.2, Martin Heath, another world championship
absentee, has entered the championship, which start on Friday week.
The world No.30 from Oban, who also competes in India but has been unfortunate
to draw top-seed Rodney Eyles in the first round, will be the favourite ahead
of the former English junior internationalist, Stuart Cowie.

A FORMER policeman was convicted yesterday of making indecent phone calls to
women after claiming his body was inhabited by the spirit of a
nineteenth-century pervert.
While Anthony Cooper, 43, physically rang the numbers, it was the ghost of
Peter Wilson, who died more than 100 years ago, who spoke to the women,
magistrates in Hemel Hempstead, Hertford, were told.
Justices ruled out the defence case that Cooper was acting in a state of
automatism after being subjected to ``spirit attachment by Peter The Pervert''.
Cooper, of Waterdell, Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, denied four charges of
impersonating a police officer and three of making indecent calls between July
and September, 1994, but was convicted on all counts.
Magistrate Malcolm Barker said: ``On what we have heard so far, we are
considering custody.''
Sentence was adjourned for reports until January 3.
Cooper, who has been married for 18 years and has three step-children, had told
the court: ``I admit it must have been me who made the calls. But I still do
not have any knowledge of them.''
He said he had experienced ``strange feelings'' after receiving burns during a
fire in 1985.
Mr David Markham, for the Crown, said Cooper's conduct was ``deliberate and
conscious''.
For 10 years, Cooper was chief of security at the Asda supermarket in Luton,
Bedfordshire. Between 1971 and 1974, he was a police constable in Bedfordshire.
Mr Markham alleged: ``Cooper used his accumulated experience to embark on a
course of conduct the object of which was his sexual gratification.''
Cooper would choose his female victims from magazine advertisements and would
call, claiming he was Inspector Harrison from Watford police station.
``He would say to the woman that she could expect a call from a pervert and
could expect to be on the receiving end of lewd and rude comments,'' Mr Markham
said.
As Inspector Harrison, Cooper told the women to keep the man talking for as
long as possible.
Mr Markham said: ``He was very plausible - some agreed to assist and he would
give them an entirely false number.
``The female would then receive a call very shortly from a man calling himself
Peter.''
The caller told one woman he was a transvestite looking for a room.
The court heard how the calls were later traced to the Asda store.

Major aims
to extend
war grave
pilgrimage
scheme
PRIME Minister John Major was mobbed by hundreds of war widows last night as he
announced plans to extend the Government-aided war graves pilgrimage scheme.
They surged forward to surround Mr Major when he made a surprise appearance at
a central London reunion for widows who have already benefited from the 10-year
programme.
Amid remarkable scenes, they jostled for position to have their photographs
taken alongside him and put their arms around him.
There were rousing cheers when the Prime Minister revealed that the scheme to
help widows visit their husband's final resting place was to be extended by a
further three years until 1999.
Mr Major paid an emotional tribute to the courage and strength of the women who
were left as young widows at the end of the Second World War.
``I hope in some small way this will illustrate in a more concrete way that
there are many people who will never forget the sacrifice that was made,'' he
said.
``This is but a small way of saying thank you for your courage, thank you for
the sacrifice your family has made.''
The decision was praised warmly by women who have joined the pilgrimages
organised for the Government by the Royal British Legion.
Mrs Dorothy Pattison, 76, of Hartlepool, Cleveland, urged widows who had not
seen their husband's graves to take advantage of the scheme.
``When you first see the grave, you simply break your heart,'' she said.
``But then there is a feeling of calm and there is no doubt it helps even after
all these years.''
Vice-Admiral Sir Geoffrey Dalton, the legion president, described the extension
of the scheme as ``absolutely marvellous''.
He said: ``It has been a tremendous success over the past 10 years. We know
that it is terribly important for these widows to visit the graves of their
husbands and also to see where they fell. Afterwards, they have this remarkable
feeling of calm.''
Over the past 10 years, more than 3000 widows and 8000 close relatives have
visited the graves of their loved ones in 42 different countries.
In the past year alone, 1375 people including 117 widows have joined
pilgrimages to cemeteries as far afield as Hong Kong and Malaysia.
The legion said demand for the grant-aided programme was still very high.
The Ministry of Defence pays seven-eighths of the total cost of a widow's trip
and, in cases of extreme hardship, the legion makes up the difference. Other
relatives go at their own expense.
Mr Major revealed that a further 20 pilgrimages were planned for 1996,
including Burma, Normandy, India, and North Africa.

THOUGH its players look young, and though this was their first appearance in
Scotland, the excellent Prazak Quartet is within sight of its quarter-century
on the platform.
From the way it performed Smetana at last night's New Town Concert, with the
most subtle gradations of tone and changes of pace, the evidence of its mature
rapport was there for all to hear. But the uncommon positioning of the viola
player opposite the first violin, and the way both of them turned to face the
audience at moments of high expressiveness, said something else about the
ensemble: that this could only have been a Bohemian quartet, performing to the
limits of its emotional identity.
Every moment of Smetana's autobiographical masterpiece in E minor disclosed
this to the full, making the performance a wonderfully tender, passionate, and
picturesque sequence of musical reminiscences. At the climax of the slow
movement, an almost orchestral richness was achieved as the big chords were
heaved into place, but the gentler moments, as one soft theme then another
emerged from the texture, were no less astonishing and enthralling.
When a Czech quartet plays the music of one of its fellow countrymen, it does
so with fire and spontaneity. Earlier, perhaps, the Prazak had failed to bring
quite such powerful identity to Ervin Schulhoff's Five Pieces, a dance suite in
which Bartokian graininess was mixed with Stravinskian spikiness.
There was no doubt, however, about the vitality of the performance, or about
the freedom with which Beethoven's early B flat major quartet was played at the
start of the programme.

EVEN before last week's cut in mortgage rates, signs were emerging that the
housing market was stabilising after months in the doldrums.
Prices rose last month by a seasonally adjusted 0.3%, making four months in
succession that they increased, according to the Halifax Building Society in
its monthly survey, published early this morning.
October's rise was revised up from 0.1% to 0.2%. Even so, prices are still 1.4%
lower than November last year.
The Halifax, Britain's largest mortgage lender, said the figures confirmed
``our view that house prices are no longer generally falling and remain more or
less stable''.
Last week the society cut its mortgage rate from 7.99% to 7.74%, amid
speculation that the Budget would lead to a cut in bank base rates sooner or
later. The Halifax's move has been followed by most major mortgage providers in
an effort to revive the housing market.
Figures from the Bank of England showed that growth in the narrow measure of
the money supply, M0, accelerated in November, but this was not thought to
undermine the prospects of lower rates.
``Any rises in house prices will depend on improvements in consumer confidence
which should occur as incomes are boosted by tax cuts in 1996,'' the building
society said.
``The downward trend in interest rates, signalled by the Halifax's recent
decision to lower mortgage rates, should further help to stimulate the market
next year,'' it added.
The Halifax figures follow data from the Nationwide Building Society on Friday
which showed prices rose 1.5% in November, but remained 2.2% down on a year ago.
Some economists have taken encouragement from a pick up in new mortgage
approvals recently, although it has yet to translate into lending figures.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders has cautioned that the rise in approvals may,
in large part, reflect ``churning'' - existing homeowners switching for a
better deal, rather than heralding a market recovery.
The rise in the Halifax index last month took the average house price to
#61,317 from October's #61,092. Prices paid by first-time buyers were unchanged
at #44,768. New house prices rose 2.3% in November.
M0, which covers notes and coins in circulation and bankers' balances, rose by
0.7% last month, with the annual rate picking up from 5.2% to 5.6%, well above
the Government's 0% to 4% monitoring range.
The three-month annualised rate was 5.9% and the six-month rate 6.1%. Excluding
bankers' balances, monthly growth was 0.5%, the same as in October.
James Capel's Adam Cole said: ``While the relationship between monthly M0 and
monthly retail sales is not close, today's numbers add to other evidence - such
as the John Lewis sales figures - suggesting that November should see a
reasonable rebound in retail sales after two disappointing months.''

SCOTTISH Radio Holdings yesterday gave more details of its bid to operate a
Dublin-based radio station broadcasting to all parts of the Irish Republic.
Chief executive Jimmy Gordon said Scottish Radio was competing with four
Irish-based groups for the Irish national radio franchise, which will probably
be awarded in February.
If successful, Scottish Radio hopes to put a new FM station on the air in
September, broadcasting a broad mix of music and speech. This recipe is
unashamedly based on Mr Gordon's winning formula for launching Radio Clyde more
than 20 years ago.
``It would be what Radio Clyde was before we split frequencies, a broad-based
programming with a fair amount of speech and a broad range of music, with
everything from pop to classical,'' he said.
Mr Gordon reckoned the Irish station would cost #4m to launch and would
initially employ about 50 people.
Scottish Radio has a 35% stake in a consortium applying for the licence
alongside two partners who Mr Gordon referred to as ``capital providers''.
If the application is successful, Scottish Radio will effectively run the new
station.
But first it must fend off rival bids from three Irish radio stations and a
group of Irish entertainment promoters. This will involve putting forward a
good case at public consultation hearings in January.
Scottish Radio is determined to expand outside Scotland and diversify from
radio into weekly newspapers because it has little room to expand further on
its home turf.
The Glasgow-based company, which owns Radio Clyde, Radio Forth, Radio Tay and
the Aberdeen station Northsound, bought the Morton group of weekly newspapers
in Northern Ireland for #11.2m in October. Further newspaper acquisitions are
planned and it is eager to apply for the licence for a new regional radio
station in Yorkshire.
Scottish Radio already has one toehold south of the Border. It owns 40% of West
Cumbria Radio. Last week, the company announced a 22% rise in pre-tax profit to
#5.1m. It has #8.2m of cash in the bank.
n.Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) has agreed with Argus Press to acquire
the Argus Business Media magazine and exhibitions business for #35m cash.
The acquisition is complementary to existing businesses of the trust which also
owns the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and London's Evening Standard.
Argus Business Media publishes trade and technical journals, yearbooks and
directories for a range of industry sectors and organises exhibitions and
conferences.
The unit produces 52 titles, 27 annuals and about 50 exhibitions a year. In the
year ended March 31, 1995, it made a pre-tax profit of #3.6m on revenues of
#25.3m.

IF pride remains a currency of any strength in a business increasingly
dominated by finance then Rangers just might complete a pretty miserable
Champions' League campaign on a high in Dortmund tomorrow night.
Having qualified from Group C behind Juventus this tie carries little
significance for Borussia Dortmund, but even at this late stage the Ibrox side
are anxious to prove that they are much more than bit-part players.
A win might also impress Fortuna Cologne's Mikkel Beck, who is expected to sign
on at Ibrox some time next week provided, of course, no other clubs make late
moves for the Danish striker's services.
It is believed Beck has a clause in his contract which prevents his club from
asking more than #600,000 if he sees out his agreed term, which expires at the
end of this season, and means it is in Fortuna's interest to transfer him while
he is in contract. It would also be to the German club's liking if two or more
clubs became involved in a bidding contest, but Rangers would be unlikely to
pay more than #1m.
Fortuna were unwilling to sell him before the start of their winter shutdown
this weekend and are hoping he can do something against Wattenscheid to help
ease their relegation fears.
It should be said, though, that Rangers are still likely to have the
21-year-old with them next week and the Brazilian, Jardel, should also sign
although he requires to secure a Portuguese passport to get around the need for
a work permit.
Of course, neither of these players will be able to help Rangers tomorrow
night, but in the last couple of weeks the side has been playing with something
more like the style expected of them and if they can carry that improvement
into the European theatre they might yet demonstrate their true capabilities.
Having gone a full Champions' League campaign undefeated after having qualified
in season 1992-93 - they failed to qualify in the next two seasons - Walter
Smith's side have still to win a tie in the current series having lost twice to
Juventus and once to Steaua Bucharest.
Rangers drew with the Romanian champions at Ibrox and also Borussia, who
secured their place in the quarter-finals with a 2-1 win against Juventus in
Turin, but within Smith's squad their is a genuine belief that they can close
the campaign in triumph.
Borussia will be forced to make some changes because of suspension and recovery
from injury and it still pains Rangers' players when they look at their section
and are reminded they have secured only two points from five matches.
``We have done well in the last couple of away games in the premier division,''
said Smith, ``and, in fact, we haven't lost an away match in domestic
competition.
``However, we haven't won a game in the Champions' League and we would like to
turn that around.''
At least Smith's anxiety when it comes to selecting three non-Scots to play in
Europe will be eased because Gordan Petric, who was cautioned in the 1-1 draw
with Steaua a couple of weeks ago, is suspended and although Craig Moore has
resumed training after injury it is unlikely he will be asked to play.
Indeed, Rangers could revert to the more traditional 4-4-2 formation for this
match although Smith has been determined to remain true to his desire to have a
three-man central defence so far this season.
Gary Bollan and John Brown also could play central defence, but even without
Petric, who has been culpable several times this season when Rangers have
conceded goals, Smith must hope others like Paul Gascoigne and Brian Laudrup
take up the challenge and provide something extraordinary. If Rangers are to
win in Germany their best players must make the difference.
Gascoigne has certainly been producing better work recently and if he is
approaching his best again Borussia could be in for a surprise, especially a
defence which will be without Jurgen Kohler, who is suspended.
Lars Ricken also is banned and Matthias Sammer has flu, but, on the plus side,
the German champions, who are back at the top of the Bundesliga, have Stephane
Chapuisat and Karl-Heinz Riedle available again after lengthy spells recovering
from injuries.
``They have recovered from an indifferent start and are looking good, but we
have picked up also,'' Smith said.
By way of highlighting another incentive for Rangers to do well, the manager
also mentioned the fact that in Champions' League football each point is worth
#250,000, but while the accountants would relish #750,000 from the final tie,
the manager and players are driven by something more important to them.
Restoring their pride will be reward enough.

A DRINK driver deliberately crashed into a police car in a bid to escape
capture, a court heard yesterday.
Linlithgow Sheriff Court was told the incident took place after a high-speed
chase through Whitburn, West Lothian.
Depute fiscal Michelle Paterson said McCready, 31, refused to stop for a
tailing police car and the officers had to radio ahead for help.
He swerved round two road blocks and weaved in and out as he sped through
residential streets.
Two marked traffic cars finally managed to sandwich McCready's Vauxhall
Cavalier and force it to a halt.
However, he slammed his car into reverse and crashed into the police car at his
rear in a final getaway bid.
Miss Paterson said: ``At that time, the officers spoke to the accused and
smelled alcohol in his breath.''
McCready, of Glenalmond, Whitburn, admitted reckless driving and having more
than twice the legal limit of alcohol in his breath.
Sheriff David Crow fined him #3000, banned him from driving for three years,
and ordered him to resit the driving test.

KANSAS City Chiefs and Pittsburgh Steelers have booked NFL play-off places with
wins. They are the first teams to clinch divisional titles.
In Oakland, the bitter rivalry between the Chiefs and home-team Raiders lived
up to all expectations, with Kansas winning the ill-tempered exchange to grab
the AFC West crown thanks mainly to veteran running back, and former Raider,
Marcus Allen, who racked up 124 yards and a touchdown in the 29-23 win.
The 8-5 Raiders have now fallen three games behind the 11-2 Chiefs, but should
still make the play-offs.
Pittsburgh (9-4) claimed their third AFC Central title in four years by
thumping Houston Oilers 21-7, wide receiver Yancy Thigpen taking six catches -
one for a touchdown - to pass 1000 yards receiving for the season.
Washington Redskins, not enjoying the best of seasons after nine losses, pulled
off a shock double victory over Dallas (10-3), scalping the Cowboys 24-17 at
Texas Stadium.
This may be the Redskins' last season in the American capital, with speculation
mounting that they may have jumped on the switch-cities bandwagon with a deal
to move the team to a new 78,600-seat stadium across the Delaware in Maryland.
In other match-ups San Francisco 49ers (9-4) defeated Buffalo Bills (8-5) 21-17
helped by a 96-yard fumble return by linebacker Lee Woodall in the third
quarter. The Bills turned the ball over five times. NFL Week 14 results:
Thursday: New York Giants 10, Arizona 6.
Sunday: Atlanta 20, Miami 21; Cincinnati 10, Green Bay 24; Cleveland 13, San
Diego 31; Houston 7, Pittsburgh 21; Indianapolis 10, Carolina 13; Jacksonville

THE assistant director of the institute responsible for the Edinburgh unit
investigating links between BSE, the so-called ``mad cow'' disease, and its
human equivalent yesterday pledged the research would not suffer because of job
cuts.
Dr Barry Freeman, assistant director of the Government-backed Institute for
Animal Health, which governs the neuro-pathogenesis unit in Edinburgh,
confirmed that about 50 redundancies had been asked for from the institute's
530 staff. Around 70 work at the Edinburgh unit. The remainder work in Surrey
and Berkshire.
Staff in Edinburgh were told last month they had until December 21 to meet
voluntary redundancy requirements or face compulsory cuts.
Concern has been expressed at the threat to the Edinburgh unit, which is
involved in the development of detailed tests in a bid to establish a common
agent linking the cause of bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE) in cattle and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans.
Dr Freeman said funding for research into BSE was set to increase by #1m next
year, and added that the institute was hopeful of receiving some of the cash.

<HEADLINE>Forte plans shake-up to fend off Granada</HEADLINE>

SIR Rocco Forte surprised the City yesterday with a plan for the fundamental
restructuring of the hotels and leisure group that would lead to the splitting
off of the restaurants business and the possible sale of the 68% stake in the
Savoy hotel.
This is the first significant movement since Granada launched an unexpected
#3300m bid for Forte and has impressed some analysts.
Granada chief executive and chairman elect Gerry Robinson immediately swung on
to the attack. He said Forte would be splitting two business that sat together,
adding that he thought the group would be worth less if it were divided up.
That is because there would be less control over the key issue of purchasing.
Forte shares eased 4p to 338p while Granada firmed 2p to 651p to value each
Forte share at 328p.
The Forte strategy to help fend off the increasingly hostile bid is to form the
Little Chefs, Happy Eater, Welcome Break, and Cote France roadside restaurants
into a stand-alone company which would be floated off.
Initial calculations suggest it could be worth about #1500m before deducting
any debt relating directly to the chains which operate in Britain and France or
anything that may be loaded on to them in the event of flotation. That could
reduce their net value to about #1000m.
Also lined up for disposal is the White Hart hotels chain, which some analysts
believe to be worth just #100m.
The biggest surprise is the decision to sell the 68% stake in the Savoy hotel,
particularly as Lord Forte and his son Sir Rocco have spent so much time and
effort while suffering many slights in their attempts to gain control.
The Forte stake is still just 42% of the votes because of the Savoy's unusual
voting structure.
The Travelodge business is also worth perhaps #100m but that may continue to be
jointly owned by the restaurants company and Forte.
On Sunday it said it sold its Lillywhites sports chain to Jeronimo Martina of
Portugal for #28m. The quarter share in the Alpha Airports aircraft food
services associate will also be sold.
q.THE man ousted from his post as managing director at the Savoy has been made
boss of The Ritz in Piccadilly.
The appointment of Old Etonian Giles Shepard as managing director was announced
last night.
Mr Shepard left the Savoy last year after a long battle with Sir Rocco Forte.
He had been in charge for 15 years. He received a #569,000 pay-off when he left.

As an innovative RSNO associate conductor scheme initiated byThe Herald grows
in shape,Michael Tumelty offers a term report
IT'S almost a year since the death of Sir Alexander Gibson, the man who founded
Scottish Opera, revivified the Scottish National Orchestra, and almost
singlehandedly triggered a renaissance in Scottish musical life.
Tonight, in a celebration of the life of Sir Alex, a gala concert featuring the
two organisations with which he was most closely associated is being staged in
Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
Shortly after the death of Sir Alex last January, The Herald announced that it
was to promote the founding of an associate conductorship at the Royal Scottish
National Orchestra. This was intended to give a talented young conductor the
opportunity to gain invaluable experience, and a foothold in a profession that
is notoriously difficult to enter.
Such projects necessarily have a long period of gestation. And this one still
has a long way to go. None the less, it is shaping up to be a venture that will
give a young conductor a broad range of experience that will be unrivalled, and
is liable to become one of the key international opportunities for any aspiring
and talented conductor.
It is appropriate, on the day of the gala concert to celebrate the memory and
achievement of Sir Alex, that The Herald can now outline the scale and scope of
the project which is evolving.
For a start, it has grown. The Herald and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra
have joined forces with the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (which
already has a number of conducting schemes in place). All three will
collaborate to offer a young conductor a comprehensive range of experience over
a two-year period.
The project will take the form of a competition. The working name is The Sir
Alexander Gibson International Conducting Competition and Fellowship. The case
for a competition was argued forcefully by the musicians of the RSNO
themselves, who feel that they will be able to judge potential far more readily
in that way.
The judges at the competition will include the principal conductors of the
orchestra - currently the Viennese, Walter Weller, and the Russian, Alexander
Lazarev - and Edwin Paling, the leader of the RSNO (who will also play under
each competitor).
To understand the import of the prizes on offer, it's as well to consider for a
moment that the biggest international conducting competitions tend to offer a
cash prize together with a significant engagement with a major orchestra.
The Herald/RSNO/RSAMD competition will go far beyond any of these. The post of
associate conductor will run for two years. It is felt that such a time scale
will be required to gain maximum benefits for both the conductor and the
orchestra. With the RSNO, the conductor will undertake a series of summer Prom
concerts and will be given his or her own week in the flagship winter season
series.
Additionally, the post may be used to generate some ``out of town'' work for
the RSNO in smaller venues, where the orchestra's presence has fallen away in
recent years. The conductor will also understudy the RSNO's principal
conductors, work with the chorus master, and participate in educational
projects.
The RSAMD will offer a fellowship to the conductor. The fellow will have the
chance to conduct at least one of the RSAMD orchestra's big public concerts
each session. In addition there will be opportunities with the RSAMD's wind,
brass, and big bands. The conductor will also work with the RSAMD's repertory
orchestra, a training orchestra which meets four or five times per session.
The conductor will also work throughout Scotland in outreach activities with
the RSAMD orchestra, and with the RSAMD's opera school. And there is a whole,
new, untapped area here awaiting the lucky recipient of the fellowship.
In 1997 the new Sir Alexander Opera School is scheduled to open at the RSAMD.
It will cost #5m. Over a million was already gathered when, recently, the
school was awarded #2.5m of lottery money towards its completion. The new opera
school will provide the prizewinning conductor with opportunities to work with
young playwrights and directors, as well as to give in-house and touring
performances of opera.
On top of all this, the conductor will be able to get experience at the cutting
edge of Scotland's thriving contemporary music industry, working with composers
and groups like Academy Now!, the RSAMD's specialist contemporary music
ensemble, as well as the academy's early music department.
``What's going to make this competition unique, and different from any other
competition, is the tremendous range of experience we can offer,'' says Rita
McAllister, director of the school of music at the RSAMD.
That experience will include the opportunity to study, for up to three months
in the two-year period of the post, with one of the gurus of conducting at the
St Petersburg Conservatoire in Russia, with which the RSAMD has established
strong exchange links.
Such will be the amount of work available, the comprehensive nature of the
experience on offer, and the commitment required, that the person who holds the
post will effectively be salaried for two years to work in Scotland.
As to the time scale for the venture, it is envisaged that the competition will
be held next season (1996/97) with the winner taking up the post at the start
of the season after that. Auditions are expected to be held in about a year,
and, with a lead-in period of around six months necessary, it is expected that
the ground rules for the competition will be established by next Easter.
Rita McAllister expects world-wide interest in the post and fellowship. ``There
are young conductors who are working with provincial European companies or
orchestras who are looking for the big break,'' she says. ``And the whole of
Eastern Europe is a huge potential market.''
Matthew Rooke, music director of the Scottish Arts Council, yesterday welcomed
the collaborative project between The Herald, the RSNO and the RSAMD. He said
that with the range of opportunities offered by the scheme, the project could
become ``a focal point for talent internationally''. The entire project, says
Rooke, would represent for young conductors, ``a dream finishing school''.

Opera. Tonight, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, 7.30pm.

IT was one of those moments when we wondered if he was leading us towards one
of his outrageous punchlines, the kind that leaves you squirming at your own
naivete. In fact, Jimmy Nicholl was telling the truth.
``Sometimes I don't pick the team until we are on the bus going to the game,''
he said, as he treated us to one of his press conferences before a European
match, during which the Raith Rovers manager was thinking aloud about exactly
what line-up to use.
That is one of his endearing habits, even if it does not lend itself to a
mountain of information or the listening hacks. He does think so deeply about
every aspect of his job that he has actually left the team selection until he
is forced to write it down on the referee's list.
However he arrives at his decisions, Nicholl gets it right more often than not,
which is one reason he was chosen yesterday by the country's sports
photographers as their man of the year. The fact that he is well liked by most
sections of the business helps, of course, but award winners do need to be good
at their job.
Nicholl, in a relatively short space of time, five years, has established
himself as the man most likely among the younger brigade of team leaders, and
has done it with an unfashionable club which has never had this kind of success
or publicity in the past.
Winning the first division championship twice in that spell was commendable
enough, but to confirm a place in the top league at the same time as winning
their first major trophy, the Coca-Cola Cup, was far beyond the realistic
aspirations of the Fife club.
The European qualification which came with that memorable victory over Celtic
left much of the country giggling at the prospect of the wee Rovers taking on
one of the mighty names of the Continent.
After Rovers made it through a preliminary round and then the first round of
the UEFA Cup, none too impressively, the cynics were out in force, preparing to
have a laugh at the Stark's Park embarrassment when they faced Bayern Munich,
Jurgen Klinsmann, Jean-Pierre Papin, et al, in the second round.
Beaten 2-0 in the first leg, Rovers went to Germany with most Scots praying
that they would not suffer the kind of humiliation that can take many months,
even years, to overcome. It was a foolish fear. This is a better team than
anybody bar Nicholl thought. He had bomdarded us with the inevitable chatter
based on the strange uncertainties of football, the possibility of a complacent
Bayern and all the usual, whistling-in-the-dark observations that are designed
to transmit some kind of hope to the players.
It did not produce the miracle. Raith went out as expected, but there was no
deep dejection on the plane home that night. In fact, there was an
unforgettable moment in the Olympic Stadium, Munich, when every one of the
Scots present, and I include the ``neutral'' media corps, enjoyed a feeling of
deep national pride that has been a rarity for a long time.
Rovers, as recorded by the giant electronic scoreboards at each end of the
ground, were 1-0 ahead, playing really well, and seriously believing they could
do the impossible.
Those bonnie scoreboards stayed that way until half-time, at which point
Nicholl confessed afterwards that he had stopped quietly and had a good look at
them. ``I thought: this is worth remembering. It might never happen again.''
It was the very fact that he threw in the word ``might'' that is perhaps the
most revealing glimpse of his style of management. It is his supreme
self-motivation that spawns the conviction that, if players play to their own
limitations, anything is feasible.
In his Kirkcaldy stint he has produced a mixture of experience and youth that
is unafraid of any challenge. To take a team like Raith to fourth place in the
premier division, where they are at the moment, after the glorious failure in
Europe and the magnificent victory in the Coca-Cola Cup, not to mention the
first division title, demands a plethora of talents.
It is not easy to admit this but here goes: the snappers have got it right.

<HEADLINE>Forsyth calls for report as another Cornton Vale inmate is found hanged Third suicide tragedy at women's jail</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By LACHIE KENNEDY</BYLINE>

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth last night expressed his concern over the
third suicide death in six months at Scotland's only women's prison.
A fatal accident inquiry is to be held into the death of mother-of-two Joanne
O'Reilly, 26, who was found hanging by a bedsheet in her cell at Cornton Vale
prison, near Stirling, on Sunday.
The tragedy came only two days after an FAI into the deaths of the two other
inmates, Kelly Holland and Arlene Elliot, was adjourned until early next month.
Their suicides were the first at the prison in 10 years.
After meeting the chief executive of the Scottish Prison Service to discuss the
latest suicide, Mr Forsyth said yesterday: ``This is an extremely unfortunate
and regrettable incident. Miss O'Reilly is the third young person to lose her
life in Cornton Vale this year.
``The chief executive is taking this matter very seriously. I have asked him to
report to me on this incident once the outcome of the fatal accident inquiry is
known.''
Last night, Labour MP John McFall, Shadow Scottish Home Affairs spokesman,
called for an immediate probe by the Inspector of Prisons and said: ``An
immediate inquiry and a public report is essential.''
He added: ``This tragic death raises very serious questions about the efficient
running of the prison. The inquiry should cover all aspects of the management
and practices at the prison in order to allay public concern. The integrity of
the prison service is at stake. This must not be undermined.''
Miss O'Reilly's grieving family were too upset to talk about the tragedy but
one relative said: ``We are meeting people tomorrow to find out the full facts.
Until then, there is no comment we can make.''
Miss O'Reilly, from Nitshill, Glasgow, leaves two sons, aged six and four, who
are to be looked after by her mother.
Friends said Miss O'Reilly had been standing at a bus stop chatting to a friend
Sharon McGurn, 16, of Househillwood Road, Nitshill, last Thursday when a police
car drew up and arrested her in connection with charges of theft and failing to
appear in court.
The latest death now questions the Scottish Prison Service's ability to deal
with young people at risk despite the introduction three years ago of a suicide
prevention strategy.
Already this year there have been 16 suicides in Scottish prisons, three times
the average annual rate among the country's 44,000 prison population.
Mr John Gerrie, spokesman for the Scottish Prison Service, admitted the number
of suicides was ``very worrying''.
He added: ``One suicide in prison is one too many. The fact that rare events
sometimes cluster and that the rate of suicide among young males in Scotland as
a whole has increased is of little comfort.
``It has proved difficult to ascertain why there has been an increase in the
number of suicides in prison and no common theme or pattern has emerged.''
The SPS has already enlisted the help of Professor John Gunn, of the Institute
of Psychiatry in London, to assess ways the service can prevent suicides. His
report is due later this month.
The SPS is also installing new ``at risk'' cells in Scots prisons at a cost of
#30,000 per cell. Ten have already been completed at Aberdeen and a further 13
are in the pipeline for Barlinnie, Edinburgh, Longriggend, Perth, and Cornton
Vale.
Canvas gowns and blankets in the cells are replaced with non-tear clothes and
sleeping bags. Resuscitation equipment will be available in all halls and cells
will be free of projections which can make suicide by hanging easier.
Mr Robbie Glen, governor of Cornton Vale, said: ``It goes without saying that
everyone is shocked and upset.''
Last week, while giving evidence at the FAI into the deaths of Kelly Holland
and Arlene Elliot, the prison's deputy governor, Mr William Low, 49, said there
were flaws in the prison's current suicide-prevention policy.
He said he would like new therapeutic practices implemented and that Cornton
Vale was trying to move away from its policy of isolating prisoners if it was
felt they were going to harm themselves.
However, Mr Low, who has been deputy governor for 10 months, added that a more
therapeutic regime, involving the modernising of cells and the provision of
full-time counsellors, would drain a huge proportion of the prison's budget.

A MAN accused of terrorism charges was given #2000 to start a new life in
Scotland, the High Court in Glasgow heard yesterday.
Mr Lindsay Robb, 28, was also issued with a gun for his own protection after
witnessing an IRA murder.
His home in Lurgan, Northern Ireland, was fortified against IRA attacks after
he gave vital evidence for the prosecution.
RUC Sergeant George Forde said that after an IRA man called Duffy was convicted
of murder Mr Robb was screened by the witness protection unit and given the
#2000.
He said: ``He was given the money to resettle in Scotland.''
Mr Forde said the IRA man's defence lawyers hired private detectives to
investigate Mr Robb's background during the murder trial.
He told defence QC Mr Donald Findlay: ``This caused some concern and was
reported to the Department of Public Prosecution in Northern Ireland.''
He told Mr Findlay that screening showed Mr Robb had no criminal record.
Mr Robb, an Ulster politician who has taken part in peace talks, and five
others deny conspiring to acquire weapons for the UVF with intent to endanger
lives.
The court has heard that Mr Robb lived in Lurgan with his fiancee and their
three children and also his mother, but was also due to marry Margaret Glen of
Airdrie.
The other accused are Mr John Johnston, 49, of Campbell Crescent, Laurieston,
Falkirk; Mr Francis Hives, 45, of Prescott Road, Liverpool; Mr William
McArthur, 41, of Ure Crescent, Bonnybridge; Mr David White, 29, of Northburn
Avenue, Airdrie; and Mr Alex Davidson, 23, of Greenhill Park, Lurgan.
Advocate-depute Mr Ian Bonomy, QC, prosecuting, told the jury: ``To direct one
bullet into Northern Ireland is one too many and is a matter for the law.''
The evidence showed that Mr Robb was the go-between to get weapons and
ammunition for the UVF, he said.
``He was the organiser. You can be the main player without doing the actual
dirty work yourself.''
He said Mr Johnston went to Liverpool to try to set up the scheme where he met
Mr Hives and that Mr White and Mr McArthur went there to collect firearms.
Mr Bonomy said that Mr Davidson's arrest at the ferry terminal at Stranraer
showed ``where the conspiracy was going''.
Evidence in the case has finished and legal submissions by defence counsel are
expected to last several days.

IT will be a nervy night for all concerned in the Jurland Stadium, Lyon, where
Frank Clark's Nottingham Forest are asked to walk the UEFA Cup tightrope of a
one-goal lead against the club from France's second largest city.
Forest, who scored their first-leg goal two weeks ago at the City Ground with
just a few minutes of the match remaining, have mixed fortunes for tonight's
game, with Bryan Roy missing the game, although top scorer Jason Lee looks set
to return after having missed out recently with thigh and calf injuries.
A worry for the English side is that around 2000 tickets for the third round,
second-leg tie have been illicitly despatched to England.
The fear is that mindless hooligans will take the opportunity to attach
themselves to the official party of Forest supporters and could cause trouble.
French police have liaised closely with British officers from the Football
Intelligence Unit and warned of stringent action, described by the Lyon police
chief as ``oppressive.''
``We are aware of the possibility that national yobbos could come here and
cause mayhem,'' said Clark, ``but as a club there is nothing more we can do. We
have followed the guidelines and can only hope things go off reasonably well.''
However, Clark hopes to give Lyon worries of their own. ``We must be positive
whenever we can,'' said the manager, ``as another goal for us would mean they
must score three to beat us, and I cannot see them being capable of that.''
Werder Bremen, having a poor domestic season, will play host to PSV Eindhoven
tonight with high hopes of going further in the competition.
The Germans, whose form has shaded since Dutch coach Aad de Mos replaced Otto
Rehhagel in the summer, came away from Holland with just a 2-1 defeat in the
first leg, and now must fancy their chances of reaching the next round.
Bayern Munich travel to Benfica with a 4-1 cushion from the first leg.
Christian Ziege is suspended and central defender Thomas Helmer is doubtful but
the Germans should have no problems.
Barcelona, European champions in 1992, will not be over-confident in their
all-Spanish duel with Seville despite home advantage and a 1-1 score from the
first leg.
AC Milan, travel confidently to Prague after their recent 1-0 win over Lazio in
Rome for Thursday's match with Sparta. Milan defend a 2-0 lead from the first
leg.
Fellow-Italians Roma will be less confident as they take on Brondby, of
Denmark, who beat Liverpool in the previous round and won 2-1 in Denmark.
Spain's Real Betis, fresh from an inspiring 2-1 win over league leaders
Atletico Madrid, play French visitors Bordeaux, who hold a 2-0 lead, tomorrow,
while in the final game of the round, also on Thursday, Lens, of France, play
Slavia Prague after a goalless first leg in the Czech Republic.

ALLEN has made its first acquisitions in Scotland, with the tool hire and
construction group paying #429,000 cash for four plant hire depots.
It is buying Capital Plant Hire, which has premises in both Edinburgh and
Glasgow, and Broty Tool Hire in Dundee.
This raises the total Allen network to 84 units, to become the second largest
sector operator in Britain behind HSS.
Half-time profit jumped 31% to #3.6m on turnover 12.3% greater at #55.5m. The
impetus came decidedly from hire, where operating profit doubled to #2.22m and
should continue to show a strong performance in the current half year.
The housebuilding side is under pressure, with likely completions for the year
expected to fall by over a quarter to 315 units. However, civil engineering is
bucking the general trend, with rising profitability and is benefiting from
long-term contracts with North West Water.
Analysts expect full-year profit to rise over #1.5m to about #7.7m. The interim
dividend rises 25% to 2.5p.
the Preference terms were delayed until after the Budget in case there were
changes in legislation in the small print.
Amec has advised stock holders to reject this offer as it has the Ordinary
share bid.
A Japanese construction firm which is in a joint venture with Amec to build the
new Hong Kong airport has acquired a holding thought to be less than 1%.
That was sufficient to spark off some speculative interest in Amec which rose
2p to 101p compared with the Kvaerner offer of 100p cash. The offer closes on
December 18 unless there is a counter bid. Kaverner now owns 18.1%.

A #500,000 European boost for the Scottish beef industry was announced
yesterday by Brian Simpson, chief executive of the Scotch Quality Beef and Lamb
Association.
For the third year running, SQBLA successfully bid for promotional funds from
the European Quality Beef Scheme, Mr Simpson revealed when officially opening
Scotch Premier Meats' Christmas Carcase Show and Sale at Inverurie.
The exact amount is still to be agreed but is likely to be similar to the award
made last year of #500,000, he said. The Scottish industry won the award as a
result of the leading position it has developed in quality assurance on farms
and in meat plants, he added.
The additional funding on top of SQBLA's existing promotional spend of #1.3m
was utterly essential to counteract the adverse publicity the meat industry was
being subjected to, he said.
The champion beef carcase in the show was a 682lbs home-bred Limousin cross
heifer from JGS Duncan, Jacobshall, Gamrie, Banff. It was sold by auction for
the top price of #2600 to Coventry specialist catering butcher Aubray Allen.
Reserve was a Caithness-bred Charolais cross steer weighing 821lbs from WM
Fettes, Braes of Enzie, Buckie, which was sold for #1600 to Mills, butcher,
Lichfield, Staffordshire.
Pairs of Beltex cross Charollais lambs from WJ&amp;M Hunter, West Cairnhill,
Culsalmond, Huntly, took both the championship and reserve in the lamb carcase
section and sold for #120 each to Selfridges, Oxford Street, London, and #105
each to Mike Richardson, Ealing, London.
Selfridges also paid #140 for the champion pork carcase from Charles Downie,
Mains of Techmuiry, Fraserburgh, and #115 for the reserve champion from JL
Machrie, Mill of Torry, Udny.

<HEADLINE>Scottish increase twice that of UK Electronics help exports to rise 23%</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT POWELL</BYLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>25</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975044724</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH exports of manufactured goods soared by 23% last year, growing twice
as fast as exports from the UK as a whole. A huge increase in shipments of
computers and electronic engineering goods was mainly responsible for this.
But exports in 1995 are likely to grow only 9% as demand from France and
Germany falls and Scotland experiences a gap in large new electronics factories
coming on stream.
These findings come from Scottish Council Development and Industry (SCDI), an
independent trade promotion body which conducts quarterly and annual surveys of
Scotland's export performance.
The SCDI annual survey for 1994, published yesterday, shows Scottish exports
rose 23.6% at current prices last year to a record #14.3bn.
This was mainly because of an 63.8% increase in shipments of computers and
office equipment and a 78% rise in the export of other electronic goods,
ranging from computer components such as circuit boards to domestic goods such
as vacuum cleaners.
Stripping out the effects of inflation, Scottish exports grew by 22.8% at
constant prices, compared to only 9.5% for the UK as a whole.
SCDI general manager Alan Wilson said the opening of several new electronics
factories geared to overseas markets gave a special boost to Scottish exports
in 1993 and 1994.
``I think we are seeing the fruit of investment in the late 1980s and early
1990s when the country was sold as a springboard for foreign markets,'' he said.
But he predicted that Scottish exports would be more in line with the rest of
the UK this year. ``It will probably be single figures,'' he said.
Ian Armstrong, SCDI's business information executive, estimated that Scottish
exports would grow by 9%.
This slowdown in export growth is already evident in the SCDI's quarterly
surveys. The third-quarter survey, published last month, showed a fall in
exports from the second quarter, with signifant declines in chemicals and
computers.
According to the 1994 annual survey, based on returns from 1120 companies, 66%
of Scotland's exports go to western Europe, where France, Germany, the
Netherlands and Italy are the largest markets.
Japan and the Far East take 13% of Scottish exports and constitute the fastest
growing overseas market. Exports to the Far East grew 38% last year,
outstripping a 28.3% rise in shipments to fellow members of the European Union
and 18.4% growth in exports to the mainly Scandinavian members of EFTA.
The United States and Canada follow in third place, with a market share of 12%.
But Scottish exports to North America grew only 5.7% last year.
This perhaps reflects the fact that many Scottish computer plants are owned by
US firms and were set up to export to Europe, the Middle East and Africa,
rather than back to the US.
France consolidated its position as Scotland's largest export market last year
after overtaking Germany in 1993. Exports to France rose 51% to #2338m, with
computers accounting for most of the increase.
The composition of Scottish exports reveals a dramatic growth in the market
share of computer equipment and other electronic goods. Together, they
accounted for 49% of exports last year, up from 42% in 1993.
The market share of traditional sectors such as whisky, with 15% and mechanical
engineering with 6% has, meanwhile, declined.
According to SCDI, the number of jobs in Scotland directly dependent on exports
increased to 121,000 last year from 110,000 in 1993.

THE use of growth promoters in the production of meat does not pose a threat to
consumers, provided hormone implants are applied in the right dosage and at the
correct point in the production cycle. That was the overwhelming scientific
conclusion to emerge from a three-day conference held by the European
Commission in Brussels.
Ironically, however, the political message was that the EU's resolve that
European producers should not use implants was as firm as ever.
EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler set the tone for the gathering of 80
scientists and 170 non-scientific observers when he told the opening session
that, while he saw the event as a vital assessment of current science on growth
promoters, everyone should realise that the framing of future policy on hormone
usage in Europe remained the responsibility of EU institutions, not conference
delegates.
``There is no point in proclaiming loudly that hormone prohibitions in Europe
exist to appease irrational demands founded on misinformation and ignorance,''
he said. ``At the other extreme, I see no merit in insisting, without evidence,
that growth promoters constitute an unnatural and unacceptable interference
with life itself and must, therefore, damage the health of the human race for
generations to come.''
The control measures required by the prohibition of certain substances within
the EU were both burdensome and costly, he said. At times they had some very
real and brutal consequences. ``Controllers in the field are exposed regularly
to threats and violence. Convicted users of illegal substances are rightly sent
to jail and have to pay heavy fines.''
Despite such actions, there had been occasions when consumers had become ill
from eating the produce of animals treated with dangerous substances. This was
the result of an illegal trade in implants which had developed ``thanks to our
controls'', he added.
``Such stark realities place a heavy responsibility on EU opinion-formers and
decision-makers to develop a framework that will ensure essential safeguards to
consumers on health aspects, while allowing the controlling authorities to deal
ruthlessly with substances and practices which pose real risks to health,'' he
said.
However, risk-assessment measures concerning the possible impact on consumers
of hormone-raised produce were called into question by Professor Jim Bridges of
the University of Surrey. He said: ``We are still using the scientific
techniques of the 1960s and 1970s to answer the scientific questions of the
1990s.''

PRESSURE on EU farm spending is going to make things increasingly difficult for
many livestock producers, according to a leading farm consultancy.
This makes it all the more imperative breeders and finishers get up to speed on
their farm management systems, claimed Simon Taylor of the Signet farm business
consultancy.
``The decision to retain full livestock compensatory allowances at the same
level as the past two years is just one example of the coming squeeze. Input
costs are also rising as a result of relative shortages of both cereals and
forage crops.''
Mr Taylor, who was speaking on the eve of the launch of a new Signet service at
the Welsh Winter Fair today, said leading producers wanted more farm management
information.
``we have introduced a whole farm business system to ensure the business stays
on course. It is, in effect, a one-stop shopping system offering access to the
top experts in the field.''

LEADERS of the UK farmers' unions and the Irish Farmers' Association have
adopted a united front in opposing any moves towards re-nationalisation of farm
support policies.
After a ``summit'' meeting at National Farmers' Union of Scotland headquarters
at Ingliston, the unions issued a joint statement underlining their support for
a single European market for farm produce with fair terms of internal trade.
The unions identified world trade talks (GATT mark two) in the year 2000 as a
major factor which would concentrate minds on further reforms of the CAP, with
increasing pressure for the moderation of any economic policies judged to be
distorting trade.
Political pressure for progress towards accession of the eastern European
former Communist countries was also seen as a lever which would be used to
bring about changes in the CAP.
John Ross, president of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, said that
there was absolute agreement around the table that they did not want
agricultural policy re-nationalised. ``We really do want common policies so
that there can be a common single market,'' he said.
For the immediate future - over the next two or three years - he forecast there
would be only minor adjustments to the CAP.
The union representatives pointed out that past experience had shown the
introduction of major changes could be a slow process. The accession of Spain
and Portugal had been achieved over a 10-year period as they adapted to the EU
system.
Michael Berkery, chief executive of the Irish Farmers' Association, forecast it
could take up to 20 years to integrate the central and eastern European
countries into the CAP. There appeared to be a view in these countries that the
EU would meet them half way, dropping its standards as the former communist
countries raised theirs. ``I do not believe that will happen,'' he said. ``When
we joined we had to take on board the fundamental rules of the system.''
He expected huge difficulties in assisting the former eastern bloc countries to
achieve EU standards. ``Legal ownership of land as we understand it doesn't
exist,'' he said. That, in turn, meant credit was difficult to get. ``Until
these issues are resolved they won't have the capital or the management
capability to make anything happen.''
David Evans, director of the English NFU, said the political climate in Europe
was not yet right for major changes in the CAP. Sweden and Britain were the
most prepared for these, but it should be remembered there were still reforms
to be enacted from the 1992 package, including those relating to wine and
sugar.
On current issues, the Scottish NFU president, John Ross, called for firmer
control of the cereals market within the EU as a way of helping livestock
farmers faced with high feed prices and the possibility of supply shortfalls.
``The intensive sector are major customers and need stability both of supplies
and prices,'' he said. ``We have agreed we want a well-managed, stable,
non-fluctuating cereals market at EU level.''

SCOTTISH Television managing director Gus Macdonald will become executive
chairman next year, but a new managing director will be appointed to share the
responsibilities of day-to-day management.
Mr Macdonald, 55, will be promoted once Scottish's present non-executive
chairman, William Brown, retires at the company's annual meeting in May.
A Scottish spokesman said Mr Brown, 66, had expressed a desire to step down
some time ago, but announcement of the move had been delayed until Scottish's
strategic alliance with cable television operator Flextech had been completed.
In August, Flextech, a UK subsidiary of the US cable giant Telecommunications
International Inc, bought a 20% stake in Scottish. Flextech also transferred
its 20% stake in the Welsh ITV station HTV to the Scottish broadcaster as part
of the #64m deal.
In return, the latter undertook to provide television programming for Flextech
and its associate companies. The two partners also announced in October that
they would set up a new cable television channel for Scotland.
At that point Scottish also announced that it was planning to provide local
programming for Live TV, the cable channel of Mirror group.
The Mirror Group, publisher of the Daily Record and Sunday Mail, also owns 20%
of the Glasgow-based television company.
A sub-committee of Scottish's board is looking at who to appoint as the new
managing director.
The spokesman was unable to say what the split in duties would be between this
new appointee and Mr Macdonald in his new role as executive chairman.
But Mr Macdonald hinted that he would concentrate on broadening the company's
business activities away from its ITV franchise, where City analysts see
limited potential for future growth.
``I look forward to building on our present success as the pace of change
across the media creates opportunities for growth,'' Mr Macdonald said.
He joined Scottish from Granada as director of programmes in 1985 and became
managing director in 1990.

<TEXT>
A COMPANY which was ordered to compensate two people who contracted cancer
after playing as children near a factory is to appeal against the landmark
court ruling on asbestos.
British-based multinational T&amp;N plc was ordered to pay a total of #115,000 to
two Leeds women in the first case in which a British court ruled that a company
was liable to compensate people other than its own workers for asbestos-related
illnesses.
Mr Arthur Margereson and Mrs June Hancock contracted cancer of the chest lining
as a result of living and playing as children near the JW Robert factory in
Armley, Leeds - now owned by T&amp;N - ruled Mr Justice Holland at the High Court.
T&amp;N argues that, before 1959, when the factory closed, no-one knew that
asbestos in low doses could harm health.
Mr Margereson died in 1991, aged 66, before his claim was settled and his
widow, Evelyn, 69, was awarded #50,000.
Mrs Hancock, 59, who has been given less than two years to live, was awarded
#65,000.
T&amp;N said yesterday that the awards had been paid and the company would not
demand its money back if the appeal was successful.
T&amp;N has already paid #250m worldwide to people directly affected by asbestosis
and other related diseases.
The Leeds decision was expected to lead to a flood of cases from victims of
asbestos-related diseases who had lived near factories.

A MAN alleged to be Tory MP David Ashby's lover yesterday denied any physical
intimacy between them when they shared a double bed during a French break.
Dr Ciaran Kilduff, 32, told Mr Justice Morland and the jury on the ninth day of
Mr Ashby's libel action against the Sunday Times that he was surprised when he
saw their room at the Chateau Tilques, St Omer, near Calais, in January 1994.
``Somewhat to my surprise, it wasn't twin-bedded. It had one very large double
bed. I thought I had booked a twin-bedded room.
``But it had been a long, cold day and we weren't in the mood to go back down
saying `this isn't good enough, can you change it please'.
``It was an enormous bed. I would have been embarrassed to force the issue and
insist on going back downstairs to change the room. I think Mr Ashby felt the
same.''
Mr Ashby's counsel, Mr Geoffrey Shaw, QC, asked: ``Was there, as the Sunday
Times alleges, physical intimacy between you?''
Dr Kilduff: ``None whatsoever.''
The 55-year-old MP for North-west Leicestershire is claiming damages over an
article published on January 16, 1994, which said he shared a double bed with a
man friend during a holiday in Goa at the end of 1993.
He says it alleged that he was a homosexual who had misled his estranged wife,
Silvana, about the nature of his sexuality; that he had lied to the public
about having an affair with Dr Kilduff in France; and that he was a hypocrite
in having emphasised the importance of the family in his last election address.
Times Newspapers Ltd and former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil deny libel.
Although they accept that Mr Ashby did not holiday with a man in Goa, they
assert he was, and is, having an affair with Dr Kilduff.
Dr Kilduff, of Westleigh Avenue, Putney, south-west London, said he became
friends with Mr Ashby, who was in the process of buying the flat above him,
when they were on the same flight to the US in September 1992.
In October 1993, he had to go ex-directory when Silvana Ashby left a number of
obscene messages on his answering machine to the effect that he had been Mr
Ashby's boyfriend for the past three years.
That Christmas, he had planned to spend his one day off from the psychiatric
wards at the Royal London Hospital having lunch with the MP.
The night before, they were about to have supper prior to attending midnight
mass when Mrs Ashby tried to burst into the flat.
``She was in a complete frenzy. She kept pointing her finger at Mr Ashby. Then
she went into his study and started ripping wallpaper off the newly-decorated
wall.''
Mr Ashby was so miserable and embarrassed by the incident that Dr Kilduff
suggested he take a few days off.
When Mr Ashby asked him to keep him company on a tour of the battlefields of
Agincourt and Crecy, Dr Kilduff agreed once Mr Ashby said it would not cost too
much as they would share a room.
Earlier, Miss Alexandra Ashby, the couple's only child, who works as a
stockbroker in Milan, said her mother could become ``extremely angry,
frustrated, furious, sometimes even violent''.
She said that over the past two years, her mother had accused her father of
having homosexual affairs with a parliamentary research assistant called Tim,
barristers named David and Tim, and another unnamed barrister.
When she was 15 or 16, her mother had accused her and a girlfriend, with whom
she was sharing a changing cabin on the beach, of being lesbians.
Her mother had been loving, caring, and protective, but she was also possessive
and jealous, said Miss Ashby.
She said a failure of communication was the basis of her parents' marriage
breakdown, in 1993, but many fights were based upon jealousy.
The hearing continues.

AN Arran man who assaulted a three-month-old child because it would not stop
crying, was jailed for 15 months at Rothesay Sheriff Court yesterday.
The court heard that Mark Armit, 22, had to jump out of a first-floor window to
escape pursuing relatives.
He had been left in charge of his girlfriend's baby while its mother and
grandmother went out drinking and playing darts and bingo. The child began to
cry and he struck it repeatedly on the head, causing bruising, reddening of its
eyes, and blood clotting in its nose.
Procurator-fiscal Arthur Wheelan told the court that, when the mother arived
back at the house in Port Bannatyne, on Bute, Armit was changing the child's
nappy. When she saw its injuries, she picked up her baby and ran to a
neighbour's house and alerted her brother, who chased Armit, causing him to
jump out of the window into the street.
Armit had to be taken to Victoria Hospital, Rothesay, for treatment.
The court heard how, when police arrived at the house, they failed to get a
statement from the child's mother because of the amount she had drunk.
A doctor's examinations of the child confirmed the injuries which had cause
bleeding in several parts of its head. It was detained in hospital for two days
for treatment and observation.
Armit, of Balmore Lane, Broddick, Arran, admitted through his solicitor James
Hannay, that he had slapped the child twice and put his hand over its face
momentarily. He said he had been under stress and his temper had snapped
because of the child's continued crying.
Armit, who has been in prison for the past four months, had spent the past six
weeks in solitary confinement because of the nature of the charge he was facing.
Sentencing Armit, Sheriff J Irvine Smith said the term of imprisonment was
justified because of ``the extreme gravity and nature of the offence''.

THE new director general of the Forestry Commission, who only last week was
managing a large timber-supplying operation in Australia, yesterday said he was
bewildered by the criticism coming from UK conservationists about his
appointment.
Mr David Bills, 47, said he believed it could be a result of a ``very active
and quite militant conservation movement'' in Australia, which had chosen to
personalise issues in the information they had put out about the forest
industry. Forestry there is the number one issue before whales and nuclear
matters.
``It's disappointing but I can understand in the UK some confusion with all the
material coming over,'' he said when he took up his duties at the commission's
UK headquarters in Edinburgh.
Three years ago, he was elected president of the National Association of Forest
Industries, a lobby group representing 85% of the Australian industry.
Mr Bills said he felt some conservationists considered him ``a representative
of the arch-enemy''.
On the much-publicised incident involving Professor David Bellamy, one of the
first UK environmentalists to criticise his appointment, Mr Bills said he was
``totally bemused''.
He said that, in 1981, the professor took part in a demonstration in Tasmania
against the building of a hydro-electricity dam.
``The tree felling he recalls was being done by the Tasmanian Government's
hydro-electricity commission to open up a road to allow the dam to be built. He
says I was associated, which is certainly not true, and he's talking about it
as if I'm the chap who got him into jail.''
He said forest products were becoming increasingly scarce in a more demanding
world and the UK had recognised the deficits many years ago and made
``extraordinary preparations'' by doubling the amount of land under planting.
He added that society here had traditionally valued the outdoors and the access
to it.
``The real challenge, and I think it can be well met, is to integrate both the
wood requirements of the nation with the non-timber values of forestry.''
Asked about reports that environmentalists feared he might accelerate forest
sales and erode access, he said no-one had said anything to him within the
commission that indicated he was being brought in to speed up that programme.
``I suspect the conservation interests here are taking the opportunity of a
change of guard to make a point and to remind the Government that access is
important.''

<RECORDNO>975044840</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A CAIRN thought to be around 5000 years old is to be dismantled stone by stone
before bulldozers get to it.
It was discovered two months ago near the standing stones at Callanish, Lewis.
The site, close to Breasclete School, is in the way of road improvements. The
islands council agreed to delay work after the find but time is now running out.
A team of archaeologists are digging to unearth its secrets. The bulldozers
move on to the site in about two weeks.
The archaeologists will probably have to dismantle the cairn and rebuild it
nearby unless they can persuade councillors to divert the road.
Pleas so far to Western Isles Islands Council to reroute the road around the
site have fallen on deaf ears because of the cost.
Council spokesman Nigel Scott said: ``Historic Scotland agrees that, although
the Callanish Stones site is as important as Stonehenge in many ways, it is not
worth spending a six-figure sum to go around the cairn.''
The full council will debate the cairn's fate tonight.
The kerbed chamber, measuring eight-and-a-half metres across, was found by
island archaeologists Ron and Margaret Curtis after soil was stripped for the
roadworks close to their home.
Mrs Curtis noticed that pieces of quartz, rare in the islands, had been turned
up by a digger.
The cairn is thought to date from the same time as the 49 standing stones that
dominate the skyline on a hill a mile away.
Local historian Dr Finlay Macleod said: ``The cairn is        in line with the
main north    avenue of the Callanish   Stones.
``We don't think it was a tomb but a place where human remains and bones were
burned with charcoal. It's a mysterious place.''
Mr Curtis added: ``It would be terrible to bury it all under tarmac.''

WHAT is it that sets the grand voyager apart from tourist class? Money used to
be the dividing factor, but over recent days Bill Clinton has reminded us of
another indicator. The visiting alien, with enough clout in his pocket, is
spared the irascible welcome of immigration officials. And rather as the rest
of us travel with extra underwear, the US President moves around the world with
an extra plane at his disposal, the first kitted out as a miniature Oval
Office, the second an emergency hospital. America has lost too many heads of
state to the assassin ever to assume the simplest journey will be trouble-free.
The other sign of Clinton's real distinction as a traveller is that he commits
his luggage to the avid safekeeping of bearers, thus avoiding the muscle-strain
of dragging his suitcases to Check-In, then worrying about whether the wretched
stuff will ever make it to the aircraft, and finally hanging about the carousel
at the other end only to discover that the whole lot is stuck somewhere at
Hoboken. Where would shuttle diplomacy be if power politicians were obliged to
make bucket-shop arrangements?
But it is a funny thing about Bill Clinton's bags. As you might expect, he has
truck-loads of them, yet he always seems to end up wearing the same suit. Not
so with overcoats, however. During last week's extraordinary tour of Ireland,
North and South, he appeared in three separate coats in one day: a black Melton
on his Shankill walkabout, a brown trenchcoat in the Falls, and a second black,
but slightly different, Melton in Derry. By night-time, for the big Belfast
switch-on of Christmas lights, Clinton was back in the first coat, this
repertoire of apparel residing on the arms of several aides spread over the
various motorcades. So, if the Comeback Kid mislays one coat somewhere en
route, another isn't far behind.
Unlike royalty, however, Clinton travels with cash in his wallet. In East
Belfast he spent #3 on fruit and a mixed bunch of flowers for Hillary. In
Dublin, as he left Cassidy's Pub, he planted a bunch of punts in a charity box.
Was it all stage-managed? Yes, to some extent, but now when politicians
generally mask mediocrity with arrogance, Clinton's spectacular crowd sense
exposed the lack of true leadership close to home.
And if he never put a foot wrong that, in some way, was because security
officers were barnacled to him like glumly possessive valets. Which one, we
wondered, was the man carrying the nuclear button in his personal organiser?
Was he the Patrick Malahide look-alike, face sharp and hostile as a
searchlight, so suspicious of everything that he probably sleeps with his
earpiece still switched on?
There were moments, though, when a war of nerves operated between the agents
and the President himself. With microphones hidden in their cufflinks and, very
probably, their own land-to-air missile potential tucked into their socks, the
guys in fawn raincoats believe themselves to be the superior presence. ``Mr
President, hurry it up. We're 10 minutes behind schedule,'' one barked at
Clinton as he dived into the Derry crowd, ignoring all persuasion to the
contrary. In Dublin, the President was the one to fish out a fallen child in
the crowd, while a security officer, huffed that his instructions seemed to
count for nothing, trained a gimlet eye on one of Hillary's spontaneous
suitors: ``Jasus, you're looking great,'' the stranger told her, adding: ``Have
you got any sisters knocking around?''
And outside Belfast's City Hall, two agents suddenly found all their reference
points on sanity sliding away as a chap from the Springfield Road told the
crowd Sandy Wilson, mouthpiece of Ian Paisley, had dismissed the gifted
Christmas tree from Nashville, Tennessee, because it was green. ``Honest to
God, what does he want, an orange tree? Well, he can have an orange tree but
he'll find that's mostly green as well.''
Down in Dublin, hours later, that ominous secret service vehicle which prowls
behind the presidential limousine, looking tactlessly like a hearse, was once
again in action, the back window open for agents' easy access to its arsenal of
weapons in the event of any attack. Twenty-five years of violence in Ireland
haven't numbed the shock of seeing men with shoulder-holsters. ``Isn't the
sight of that stuff enough to put the heart crossways in you?'' said a member
of the Garda, with a heavy sigh. And then, in obvious satisfaction, he turned
to the real duties of the day, directing College Green's over-excited Clinton
watchers towards a spruced line-up of municipal WCs.

However, cash reorganisation costs are higher than market expectations and will
amount to #80m for the full year. Less important, due to the strength of the
S&amp;N balance sheet, is a #70m asset writedown.
Chief executive Brian Stewart said management integration had gone ahead very
well, while the Courage brands had out-performed with John Smith elbowing out
Tetley as the best selling ale.
Some 160 management jobs have gone so far, although details of the full
integration - including the extent of the distribution network closure
programme - will not be announced for a few weeks.
Overall group pre-tax profits in the half year to end-October were ahead 6.2%
to #155m on a turnover advance of 33% to #1345m. The shares fell 12p to 617p as
analysts scaled back their full-year expectations marginally to a profits rise
from #264m to just over #310.
The interim dividend had been raised 7.5% to 6.55p.
Mr Stewart said there was a definite north-south divide, beer sales in southern
England benefiting from the weather to a much greater extent and from a
stronger uplift in consumer spending.
S&amp;N's own production rose just 1% and that was helped by the large number of
brands, such as Becks and Theakstons, which appeal to the more specialised
sectors. The underlying volume position was also helped by the 11% growth in
take-home business.
Beer operating profits were effectively unchanged, excluding Courage. However,
there are continuing benefits from the Chef &amp; Brewer acquisition with the pub
retail side ahead almost 10% at #80.4m. There is much more to come there with
food sales, up a sixth, still below the UK average in what is a decided growth
sector.
The group operates 2600 pubs, assuming that the 100 or so acquired with C&amp;B and
planned for disposal go within the next few months.
Center Parcs had a mixed experience even in Benelux where the Belgian units
out-performed their Dutch counterparts. The British centres more than held
their own.
The leisure division's overall profits were marginally stronger at #50.9m on
turnover of #216m.
Full-year capital expenditure is estimated to be around #200m although gearing
will remain comfortably below 40%.
The dividend total could increase to 20p for a 4% yield.

DRUG dealer Alistair Malcolm, 46, who was caught with cannabis with a street
value of almost #11,000, was jailed for five years at Perth High Court,
yesterday.
He admitted being concerned in the supply of the drug at his flat in Commercial
Street, Dundee, and elsewhere in Tayside, between August 1994 and last January.
Rates appeals
OWNERS of more than 1800 non-domestic properties in the Borders have lodged
appeals with the regional council against the outcome of this year's
revaluation exercise. The figure represents almost 28% of the total of 6770
properties, with a combined ratable value of #49.5m.
Crash death
A 26-year-old man died after the car he was driving hit a brick wall during a
police chase in Orpington, Kent, yesterday. The man had to be cut free from the
car, which was believed to have been stolen. He died later while being
transferred between hospitals.
Murder hunt
A MURDER hunt was under way yesterday, after a 21-year-old man died in
Fazakerley Hospital, Liverpool, after he was found with serious head injuries
outside the Garage Club nightspot in the city's Wood Street. The man's name has
not been released.
Irish challenge
THE Irish High Court yesterday gave the go-ahead for a legal challenge to last
month's referendum decision to scrap the ban on divorce. Anti-divorce
campaigner Des Hanafin was granted a petition to appeal the outcome - which
succeeded by just 0.5% of more than 1.6 million votes - and the case is likely
to be heard early next year.
Killing charge
MR John Evans, 36, of Northfield Road, Gloucester, appeared at the town's

A DENTIST tried to fiddle his books by claiming for work he had not done.
Raymond Smith gave one patient veneers instead of crowns and said he had filled
more teeth than he had.
Over an 18-month period, Smith overstated the dental treatment he had given to
64 patients, Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard yesterday.
On another occasion, Smith, of Garleston-on-Sea, Norfolk, pretended he had
inserted a gold inlay into a tooth.
Smith, 51, admitted attempting to defraud Grampian Health Board of a total of
#7627.40.
He had had a surgery in the city's West End, in Albert Street, and also carried
out work at Old Mill of Frosterhill, near Oldmeldrum, in Aberdeenshire.
Depute fiscal Sandy Hutchison told the court that Smith's fraudulent scheme
came to light after he submitted claims for payment to the Scottish Dental
Practice Board in Edinburgh.
Smith's not-guilty pleas to four further similar charges were accepted by the
crown.
Sheriff Alexander Pollock, who was told that Smith is not in good health,
deferred sentence for three weeks for social inquiry and community service
reports.

IT started the Sunday before last with a poll splashed on the front page of
Scotland on Sunday claiming that 15 unnamed leading companies would ``quit
Scotland'' if the promised Labour/Liberal Democrat assembly, with limited
income tax powers, ever came to pass.
By this Sunday the Sunday Times had done its own post-St Andrew's Day ``straw
poll'', revealing that four equally-anonymous quoted companies were threatening
to ``relocate under home rule'' while another seven top businesses were keeping
the matter under review.
By yesterday the Scottish Sun - still fighting for independence in modest
12-point type in its masthead - was endeavouring in true tabloid style to name
the guilty men. Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the Weir Group, and Edinburgh Fund
Managers had all, it seems, been seen leaving the premises, raincoats shielding
their blushing faces. None would talk to the Sun about what it was up to.
All this on top of a much-ventilated poll commissioned by the Scottish Chambers
of Commerce on the same subject which has had more interpretations placed on
its findings than the meaning of life. Polls, straw or otherwise, are now
deeply woven into the fabric of our society. There's no escape from their
prescriptions.
But it's worth remembering that what people tell pollsters they will do and
what they end up doing are, often, two quite different things.
Asking a company, in the current context, where it will conduct its business
from under this or that constitutional settlement - as Scotland on Sunday did -
could mean moving the core headquarters team to protect key executives from
additional income tax. It could also, of course, mean relocating the whole
corporate and operational shooting match. But the massive costs associated with
the latter option, in the case of Weirs say, or S&amp;N, would inevitably act as a
major deterrent.
Let's suppose S&amp;N is one of the unnamed ``quitters''. Chairman Sir Alick Rankin
has made no secret of his hostility to home rule in the past. But quitting, on
the grand scale, for S&amp;N means moving brewing capacity, bottling, and
distribution. It also means selling pubs but, presumably, endeavouring to
maintain market share north of the Border once Scottish Brewers was relocated
in, say, Reading or Newcastle.
If Sir Alick or his successor and the rest of the S&amp;N board were to try that
on, the resistance to Guinness stout among Scottish drinkers which followed the
hostile takeover of Distillers in 1986 would look like mere tokenism. We all
remember how adroitly the S&amp;N board played the Scottish card in its successful
defence against takeover by Elders. If it were to move at the mere whiff of the
Edinburgh parliament most Scots say they want, who, among Scotland's drinkers,
would forgive them?
It would be easier for Edinburgh Fund Managers (total staff 150) to relocate,
although the move might require a name change unless it was to one of the other
Edinburghs, in Indiana, Queensland, or Tristan da Cunha. Another problem would
be the ``canny Scots'' cachet our fund management groups like to trade on. Hard
to sustain that image from the middle of the South Atlantic.
EFM, as it happens, has a more pressing challenge ahead than a legislative
assembly in Edinburgh, Scotland. It is 53% owned by the British Investment
Trust, the main trust it manages. British Investment Trust is, in turn, 85%
owned by the two main coal industry pension funds in the UK.
But, with the privatisation of the British coal industry, CINMan, the main
management vehicle for the pension funds, is currently up for sale. Last month
CINVen, the venture capital side of the business, was sold to its management.
And where CINMan ends up - the deal is expected to be completed by Christmas -
could have a far more critical impact on EFM's future than any home rule
settlement.
Just two examples of the complexities which underly an apparently simple poll
question. Multiply that throughout the sample and it's easy to see why lumping
them all into the ``We quit and we're taking 9000 jobs with us'' story-line
Scotland on Sunday came up with stretches credibility.
In that particular poll, Scotland's top 300 performing companies were
questioned. Seventy eight responded. Of these, 12 said they would ``conduct
their business'' from outside Scotland, if a Scottish assembly with the power
to raise or lower income tax by 3p in the pound were created or Scottish
independence within the European Union were ever achieved.
A further three said they would move if Labour-style home rule were enacted.
Five more - we are told they were a different five - said they would leave
under SNP-style independence. The words move and leave are not mine, but the
interpretation again placed on the answers by the newspaper concerned.
That means 58 of the 78 companies polled will stay whatever happens. Twelve
will conduct their business from elsewhere if there is either Labour or
SNP-style home rule. Five more will leave only in the event of independence.
But what are we to make of the three companies who will leave if a Labour-style
parliament is created in Edinburgh, but will, apparently, stay if Scotland
votes for independence?
I can think of one rational explanation. That the trio concerned see home rule,
with taxation powers, within the UK as added cost while they see independence,
whatever the cost, as a new, separate market which has to be served. But,
equally, I can see a trio of companies bemused and befuddled by all the endless
constitutional wrangling.
I have no doubt that some Scottish companies - particularly larger companies
with big markets outwith Scotland - are concerned. I've no doubt some of them
see constitutional change as added cost. Labour will have a job convincing them
that the Scottish parliament's power to raise (and lower) income tax by 3%
makes sense.
But the decision-makers in the companies concerned should remember Sir Bruce
Pattullo's wise words. Whatever their personal reservations, it's people not
companies who have votes. And if the people want change it's not the business
of business to thwart them. Anonymous poll answers which allow the newspapers
concerned to splash ``We'll quit'' threats are no way to encourage a
constructive, open debate about the options.

DUNEDIN Fund Managers, which has already lost $590m (#384m) of US funds as a
result of top-level departures arising from management disputes, yesterday
announced that another six fund managers had resigned.
They are believed to be moving en masse to Castle Rock, a new fund management
operation set up with the backing of a US regional bank which is thought to
have put in some funds to get the venture off the ground.
Industry analysts, and Dunedin itself, believe that former Dunedin investment
director Gordon Anderson is behind the establishment of Castle Rock.
Mr Anderson said he was not managing director of the new operation, but would
not comment on whether or not he was involved with the venture.
Industry experts believe more money will walk out the door as a consequence of
the apparent decimation of Dunedin's second tier. However, they are sceptical
about Castle Rock's ability to mop up the lost business, if indeed this is its
strategy.
Rolly Crawford, investment trust analyst at broker BZW in London, said: ``It is
a shame to see a house like Dunedin in this kind of trouble and Bank of
Scotland must step in and actually be prepared to spend money to secure the
business.
``That may involve purchasing another fund management company to quickly
rectify the position.''
Among the latest six to leave Dunedin are Alan Clark, manager of Dunedin Income
Growth Investment Trust, and Neil Pirie, manager of the Dunedin Smaller
Companies trust. Emerging markets specialist Euan Rae is also resigning.
The debacle at Dunedin has resulted in the loss of one smaller and two major US
clients, which have moved $590m of funds.
However, this loss has been offset by the attraction of $200m (#130m) of funds
from two new clients and an existing North American client which has confirmed
its decision to give more money to Dunedin in spite of the shake-out.
It was the departure in July of Mr Anderson, who was replaced by Richard
Muckart from Ivory &amp; Sime, which set in motion the exodus from Edinburgh-based
Dunedin.
The power struggle within Dunedin was first revealed with the announcement of
the resignations of chairman Hamish Leslie Melville and deputy chief executive
Alan Kemp at the end of October.
Their departure was a consequence of the intervention of British Linen Bank, a
Bank of Scotland subsidiary and Dunedin's majority shareholder.
The last straw came when British Linen Bank learned that Nigel Barry, head of
Edinburgh-based Dunedin's Pacific operation, and Peter Tait, head of the
European arm, had handed in their notice.
British Linen Bank chief executive Eric Sanderson, who is leading Dunedin while
a new executive chairman is found, is confident that the exodus is now at an
end.
Commenting on the latest resignations, which came on Friday, Mr Sanderson said:
``I took steps in the middle of last week to distinguish who among the
investment staff were committed (to Dunedin) and who were not.
``It was really this which resulted in the resignations of these people.''
The responsibilities of the six fund managers have been reassigned internally
and Dunedin envisages that, at most, it will have to recruit one or two
specialists.
Mr Sanderson said Dunedin had had a 30% surplus as far as staff numbers on the
investment side were concerned.
Numbers in the investment team have been reduced from 35 to 27, which Mr
Sanderson considered adequate given that it was only realistic to expect
Dunedin's growth would be slower than previously anticipated as a result of
recent events.

A MAN was fined #1000 yesterday for a string of wild bird offences, including
possessing tawny owl, kestrel, kingfisher, and sparrowhawk eggs.
Trevor Cooper, 32, admitted four charges of possessing eggs, disturbing a
merlin's nest, and having equipment for preserving eggs.
Magistrates at Burnley, Lancashire, heard that police found the cache when they
searched Cooper's home while investigating thefts from his employer.
Mr Michael Travers, prosecuting, said: ``He took the entire batch of eggs from
the nest every time.''
Cooper, of Burnley, also was fined #100 for stealing tools and cleaning fluid
from the chemical company where he worked.

MORE than 1000 cashpoint customers were filmed secretly by a gang of crooks as
they withdrew money during an ``ingenious'' swindle, a court heard yesterday.
Close-up shots of unsuspecting account holders as they keyed in pin numbers
gave the fraudsters all the information needed to make hundreds of bogus cash
cards. Teams of thieves then ``trawled'' large areas of England, raiding Abbey
National Building society branches. They withdrew #30,000 in one two-day period
alone.
Southwark Crown Court was told that their unfortunate victims did not realise
they had been targeted until they received their account statements or learned
thatmortgages and other bills had gone unpaid.
In the dock was John Gravette, a 50-year-old car dealer from Edmonton, north
London, who was jailed for four years. His son Warren, 27, of Palmers Green,
north London, once a player for Spurs, was jailed for two years.
The men, said to have lived a ``cash rich'' lifestyle on the #60,000 plus that
could be directly attributed to their part in the swindle, had pleaded guilty
to one charge of conspiracy to steal.
Mr Michael Holland, prosecuting, said the Crown accepted the two men could be
shown to have been involved in the conspiracy for four months of the two years
it existed.
``We can't say who the mastermind is. They and the others involved have not
been caught,'' he told the court.
More than 2500 illegal withdrawals were made, which netted more than #601,000.

A FACTORY worker who pulled a superheated steel rod out of his head after an
accident was awarded an estimated #1m damages yesterday after the High Court
heard he was now a ``helpless nobody''.
The 85-metre-long bar, heated to between 500 and 700C, shot off a cooling bed
at the Sheerness, Kent, factory where Mr Kelvin Page worked in October 1991,
piercing one side of his skull and going out through the other.
Mr Page, 28, pulled the rod out with his bare hands but it had caused severe
damage to both frontal lobes of his brain.
``Remarkably, he was conscious throughout the entire event. It must plainly
have been a most horrific experience for him,'' said Mr Justice Dyson.
Mr Page, 28, who was once an ``ambitious, highly motivated man'', now ``moved
around as a helpless nobody''.
The judge paid tribute to Mr Page's wife, Vanessa, 28, who has been caring for
him since the accident.
``She has clearly done a remarkable job. She has refused to give in despite
sometimes feeling in despair,'' said the judge.
His former employers had not disputed liability.

DEBUNKING is a disease of the age. For the past decade, and more, it has been
the height of chattering-class fashion to bare an idol's feet of clay. Now,
this autumn, Channel 4 has celebrated the trend with its Secret Lives series,
dramatic film-biography of famous subjects exposing their hidden depths of
darkness, badness, and eccentricity.
So the Duke of Windsor is ``outed'' as a Nazi sympathiser, a traitor to British
interests in the Second World War. Marie Stopes, queen of family planning and
author of Married Love, was last week exposed as a eugenicist, her prime
interest in contraception being its utility in a strive for a master race - not
to mention her loveless, brutal marriage, her suffocating upbringing of an only
child, and a colossal vanity. This week Baden-Powell, he of Scouting for Boys,
is due for the Secret Lives treatment: word is that the great man will be
``outed'' as a closet homosexual; a paederast with dark, sadistic tendencies
(though there is precious little evidence that Baden-Powell had such drives,
and none at all that he practised them).
The trouble with this sort of thing is that, so amenable are we to anything
that tickles our own prejudice, we tend to agree with the hatchet-jobs on idols
we despise and indignantly defend the characters of such deceased as we admire.
Secret Lives produced not a scintilla of evidence that ex-King Edward VIII was
an active, self-conscious Nazi agent; they rehashed many ancient libels, and
disclosed abundant proof that he was an idiot, which we knew already. I enjoyed
the Dr Stopes profile hugely, having a peculiar dislike of opinionated and
power-hungry women (I had an adolescence under Thatcher, after all). The
Baden-Powell programme is as yet unscreened; I suspect, however, that I will
find it most tenuous and unjust.
There is the hint, to this series, that this is revisionism for its own sake.
Some bigshot writer, and a team of researchers, seize on a subject, ascertain
his or her historical image, and then build up all the evidence they can to
tear 'em to pieces. Certainly the writers of Secret Lives have picked a
suspiciously fashionable line.
It is trendy to despise and mock the royal family; and the Duke of Windsor (who
cut a ridiculous figure at the best of times) is easy meat. Recollection of the
last war, and of Nazi evil in particular, has given us a horror of racism, and
thus Stopes's work in eugenics can be blasted in outraged virtue. And in our
sex-sodden, sex-obsessed, sex-daft age - and looking back to a figure as quaint
as Baden-Powell - it is hard for anyone in London of the nineties, I doubt, to
think of a gung-ho shorts-wearing pensioner who liked being with boys but
didn't, in truth, feel any sexual atraction to them.
This is not history. History has its own discipline and, in its highest form, a
grim and steadfast morality. In the first, it looks at a subject in his
historical role, and assesses that individual by the ability, judgment and
character he exhibited in that role. In the second, it assesses achievement by
its endurance through time. In the third, it judges a man within the context of
his time.
And underlying all this, of course, is classical methodology - use of
contemporary sources, documentary and archeological; the unceasing search for
corroboration; the moral obligation to separate the truth of the past from the
exigencies of the present. (Still, Ulstermen hate to be reminded that King
Billy went to the Boyne with the Pope's blessing; and that his victory over
James II excited torchlit rejoicing in Rome.)
An example. One of my great heroes is Jean Calvin, a French-born cleric who,
from his Genevan base, produced the greatest theology of the Reformation.
But the historian in me must accept, as proven fact, Calvin's complicity in the
execution - by burning - of a heretic called Servetus, who denied the key
doctrines of the Christian faith. There are extreme Protestants, to this day,
who try desperately to argue that Calvin had nothing to do with it. And there
are, of course, Romanists and their fellow-travellers who bang on about smoking
Servetus as if it was the defining act of Calvin's life.
The fair historian accepts, as fact, an event which undoubtedly happened and in
which Calvin was unquestionably implicated. But he also puts the episode into
the context of Reformation Europe, when Servetus would have gone to the stake
in every capital in Christendom, when Mary Tudor (a woman as kindly as she was
crazed) was burning Protestant after Protesant in Smithfield Square. Toleration
of a minority faith was a concept undreamed off in the West at that time.
Have Secret Lives been fair to their subjects? Edward VIII's woolly, addled
views on wealth and race were unexceptional among Englishmen of his class.
Eugenics, in the twenties, had none of the connotations - post-Auschwitz,
post-Nuremberg - it conjures up today.
In the innocence of a pre-war world, society thought nothing of scout leaders
watching a swimming competition by lively naked boys . . . and so on.
What is even more puzzling is that ``revisionism'' seems essentially negative,
as practised by contemporary writers and broadcasters. For one, if I were
tempted to devote years of my life to writing a biography, it would have to be
on a subject I admired - or at least for whom I had a certain sympathy;
investing all that time and energy in some gleeful, sustained hatchet-job seems
as malicious as it is perverse.
For another, there are quite a few historical figures from the recent past
deserving of a kindlier image in the contemporary world. Queen Victoria was a
woman of considerable charm and ability, with much more liberal views on, say,
race and sexuality than are generally credited to her.
Harry S Truman, demonised today for dropping the Bomb in 1945, was one of the
best-read men ever to occupy the White House.
And so on. Can the team at Secret Lives not find a few characters, for a
change, deserving of new and brighter public relations?
There is one cheering aspect to this. If the trend abides, and deepens, we may
all look to a day when some of our present sacred cows will, in a generation or
two, be fed to the revisionist wolves. Ho Chi Minh, Stephen Hawking, Derek
Jarman, Andrea Dworkin . . . well, libel laws forfend; but I doubt if our
children will view these colourful subjects in quite the reverential light we
shine upon them in our day.

A #40M shopping centre is being proposed for the centre of Inverness in a
development which could bring up to 700 jobs to the Highland capital but which
could mean the demolition of several existing buildings.
A model of the development, which alone is understood to have cost #40,000, has
now been set up in Highland Regional Council's Inverness headquarters for
public viewing. This accompanies the planning application from MFI Properties
which has been lodged with the council.
The development, one of the largest ever proposed for Inverness, would create a
two-storey shopping mall fronting on to Academy Street and covering 167,000sq
ft, with a Debenhams department store occupying 80,000sq ft. There would be 39
further units and a 600-space car park. The ``Academy Centre'' would be
serviced from an underground level.
The development would also create a direct link between Inverness rail and bus
stations which would allow the construction of a covered pedestrian walkway.
The existing bus station would be demolished.
The MFI store and the Carpetwise store currently on the site are planning to
relocate to edge-of-town units. Negotiations are continuing with others on the
site, including the Royal Bank of Scotland and William Hill.
The St Albans-based Redbourne Group are MFI's project managers. A spokesman
said yesterday: ``This project will enable Inverness to face the challenge of
significant retail market enhancements in places like Edinburgh, Glasgow,
Aberdeen, and Stirling.''
Mr John Greaves, Highland region's depute director of planning, said yesterday.
``It is possible a report might go to the meeting on the planning committee on
February 7 or March 20 but I have alerted the shadow Highland Council.''
Mr Greaves said that even if the council was of a mind to grant planning
permission, it would have to consult the public over the closure of existing
streets proposed in the development.
If there were any objections it would have to be sent to the Secretary of State
with the likelihood of a public inquiry. There were also listed buildings on
the site, such as the bank. This meant Historic Scotland would have to be
involved.
Meanwhile, tomorrow's meeting of the council's planning committee will discuss
a proposal from Nairn-based Narden Sevices which has applied to build a #50m
development at West Seafield near Culloden.

<HEADLINE>Forsyth challenged over Laggan pilot</HEADLINE>

LABOUR and the SNP have challenged the Scottish Secretary to prove that giving
the people of Laggan control of their forest was not just a pre-election
publicity stunt.
They want him to extend his initiative so that other communities get preference
in all Forestry Commission sales.
It emerged yesterday that the 25 crofters in two Lochaber townships, Inverroy
and Bohuntin, are interested in buying 1000 hectares of grazing land on the
Forestry Commission-owned Inverroy Estate, as well as several woodland
plantations.
Western Isles MP Calum Macdonald, a Labour spokesman on the Highlands and
Islands, has written to Mr Forsyth following his announcement that he wanted to
help the people of Laggan take over and run the 3500-acre Strathmashie Forest,
which would be Britain's first community forest.
Mr Macdonald tells the Scottish Secretary: ``Since 1979, the Government have
disposed of more than a quarter of a million acres of Forestry Commission
holdings on the open market. The vast majority of these has gone to private
commercial interests. Very little has passed into any form of community
ownership.
``Therefore, there is understandable scepticism about whether your announcement
on Laggan represents a genuine change of heart by the Government, or whether it
is simply a pre-election ploy to grab favourable headlines, but without any
real commitment to change the existing policy with its emphasis on sell-offs to
the private sector.''
Mr Macdonald said that this scepticism could only be erased by a clear
statement from the Scottish Office that, in future, first preference would be
given to community ownership over private companies or individuals.
``If you feel unable to make such a commitment now, then I ask that you
announce an immediate moratorium on all Forestry Commission sales until there
is a comprehensive and thorough review of all the disposals policy with a view
to increasing its social and development value to the local communities.
``Such an announcement would truly mark a genuine new departure in Government
policy, and would be warmly applauded by all those who have the interests of
rural communities and of responsible forestry management at heart. On the other
hand, if such a commitment cannot be made, then rural communities will know
that the Strathmashie announcement is, sadly, no more than a publicity stunt;
good news for the local community involved, but without any wider signficance.''
The Inverroy crofters did not want to speak about their project yesterday. A
report prepared for Highland Regional Council, however, stated that they were
keen to examine the potential of the afforested area on the estate, beyond that
of cyclical timber production.
``The possibility exists for some of the current woodland blocks to be
redesigned to give a greater species mix, providing a more diverse woodland
habitat. If this potential does exist, there are a number of opportunities such
as increased access and interpretation which could be developed if the crofters
acquire the estate.''
SNP land spokesman Councillor Rob Gibson said last night: ``Michael Forsyth has
shown by his action, in approving the Laggan woodland as a pilot study in
community ownership, that he is coming round to the views of the majority of
people in Scotland, that local communities should have control of the land and
resources.
``This move must strengthen the case for the Inverroy crofters to own the
woodland on their estate and gain economic benefit from it. But Mr Forsyth must
now ensure that this opportunity is afforded to other communities throughout
Scotland.''
Inverroy is the third group of crofters in recent weeks to make a move towards
community ownership.

<HEADLINE>Iceland and N Brown team up for #1100m Littlewoods bid</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE family-owned stores, mail order and pools giant Littlewoods has received a
#1100m takeover approach from a partnership of two other retail groups, it was
confirmed yesterday.
The bid involves a consortium of Iceland frozen foods and mail order group N
Brown.
Sir David Alliance's Manchester-based home shopping company N Brown is offering
#650m. Its part of the deal would be financed by bank borrowings and a share
issue.
Iceland is chipping in #450m in cash and planning a joint venture to own most
of the Littlewoods properties.
Any deal would have to be approved by the 32 Moores family members who own all
the shares in Liverpool-based Littlewoods. The now disunited family will be
voting on these plans and a takeover move by former chief executive Barry Dale
on Thursday.
Last week members listened to the views of Michael Gatenby, a former deputy
chairman of investment bank Charterhouse, about the company's future direction.
A stock market flotation emerged as one possibility.
Iceland already runs franchises in 38 of Littlewoods' biggest stores.
Ladbroke, the betting shops and hotels group, is believed to have been offered
first option by the consortium to buy the pools arm, which would complement its
Vernons operation.
The home shopping division, which made a #73.4m profit last year and commands a
21% share of the market, would be seen as an ideal fit with N Brown, which has
just 5%.
The story of the Liverpool brickie's son who set up a multi-million pound
company from scratch only to see his descendants squabble over his wealth could
have been taken from the Merseyside soap opera Brookside.
But the threats faced by the retailing, mail order and football pools concern
are real enough. It could lose its status as the UK's largest family-owned
company if its 32 shareholders accept one of the two takeover deals on the
table.
A sale would also end its history as one of the country's most secretive
companies.
The firm was founded in 1923 by the late Sir John Moores who introduced the
concept of football pools to Britain. After a hesitant start, the business grew
and in 1932 he expanded into mail order and, in 1937, into chain stores.
Sir John, the son of a bricklayer, maintained an iron grip over the company and
jealously guarded the family-owned status up to his death in 1993, aged 97.
As his influence waned in the years leading up to his death, disagreements
broke out between members of the extended family about the direction the
company should take.
In March, the board fired chief executive Barry Dale for undisclosed reasons.
Mr Dale retaliated by putting together a #1200m hostile bid.
In the same month, Sir Desmond Pitcher, chairman of North West Water and
Merseyside Development Corporation and a leading figure in the City, resigned
as vice-chairman.
Then in April this year, John Moores III, a grandson of the founder, who owns
6.5% of the company and lives in Monaco, quit the company.
Pre-tax profits from the stores, catalogue shops and mail order activities rose
88% between 1989 and 1993 to #90.5m on sales of #1800m.

THE Maid of the Loch Trust was finally assured ownership of the historic paddle
steamer when it received the keys to her cabins at Balloch yesterday.
Members of the trust joined Dumbarton District Council Provost Pat O'Neil, who
has been one of the driving forces behind the fight to save Loch Lomond's
floating landmark from a watery grave.
``This is the first time in my life I've been given a paddle steamer,'' said Mr
Michael Hughan, of the trust. ``It's been three years to the day that the local
council bought her and saved her from the scrapheap. We've been campaigning to
get her back in service ever since.''
Trustees recently were given the opportunity to acquire the Maid from the
district council once they raised #200,000 towards her restoration. The current
total is well in excess of this figure.
The total cost of restoring the ship to her former glory is estimated at #1.8m.
Applications for European Union aid and lottery funding have been submitted.
Musician and broadcaster Jimmy MacGregor, who was on board for the ceremony,
said: ``I'm delighted to see that trust status has finally been achieved for
the Maid.
``I used to sail on her as a child with my mum and dad and have never forgotten
the pleasure a paddle steamer can give you.''
The Maid is the last major paddle steamer to be built in Britain. She was
constructed in 1953 at the former Inglis yard at Pointhouse, Glasgow, and taken
in sections to Balloch for re-assembly.

A DRUG dealer convicted of supplying a 15-year-old schoolboy with the class A
drug methadone, was jailed for six years yesterday.
However, a jury returned a majority not proven verdict against John Allan, 28,
on a charge that he had killed his young victim by supplying him with the
heroin substitute.
The prosecution against Allan at the High Court in Edinburgh was the first
since the Court of Criminal Appeal ruled last year that it was competent to
charge dealers who caused death with culpable homicide.
Lord Coulsfield told Allan, of Loaning Crescent, Edinburgh, that he regarded it
as a particularly unpleasant and serious case.
``You are a man of 28 and you were supplying a class A drug, an extremely
dangerous drug, for a boy who had just turned 15,'' Lord Coulsfield said.
Whatever the accused's own drug problems, there was no possible justification
for such disgraceful and disgusting conduct, he said.
Allan had denied supplying methadone to Alan Colquhoun of Hay Drive, Edinburgh,
on July 26 or 27 in the city's Wauchope Square. The youth's 15th birthday had
been on July 11.
Allan also denied the culpable homicide of Colquhoun on the same date by
supplying him with the potentially lethal drug.
The jury heard that the victim was a substance abuser who was known to take a
number of drugs, including methadone, cannabis, amphetamine, ecstasy,
Temazepam, and valium.
Mr Robert Henderson told the court that Colquhoun was no stranger to drugs and
was already on a downward spiral of abuse.
As Lord Coulsfield pronounced the six-year sentence, Allan shouted abuse at him
from the dock.
The ruling that drug dealers could be charged with culpable homicide followed
the case of Scott Russell, 19, a student from Broughty Ferry in Dundee, who was
charged with killing Miss Jill Kerr, 18, by supplying her with a lethal amount
of amphetamine.
Miss Kerr collapsed at a rave disco in Carnoustie and died in hospital several
hours later.
Lord Coulsfield was also the judge in that case and decided the culpable
homicide allegation against Russell could not go to the jury.
He said Russell could not be said to have caused Miss Kerr's death because she
had sought supply of the drug and decided on what dose she should take.
The judge pointed out that Russell had not instigated, suggested or encouraged
the taking of the drug except by the actual supply.
The Lord Advocate referred the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to
challenge Lord Coulsfield's view on the culpable homicide charge and to seek
guidance for future prosecutions.
The appeal court ruled that dealers who caused the death of a drugs user could
be charged with culpable homicide.
The appeal judges compared it with an earlier case in which the supply of
glue-sniffing kits to children was ruled to be a criminal offence and stated
that consent on the part of the victim, or even instigation of the supply by
the victim was of no importance.

MILLER Group, the Edinburgh-based construction and housing giant, has knocked
off motor dealer Arnold Clark as Scotland's largest private company.
Jordans, the directory of Britain's biggest privately-owned companies,
announced yesterday that Miller was at the top of the Scottish list.
In 1994, the construction group made pre-tax profits of #3.1m on turnover of
#359.6m.
The rankings, based solely on turnover figures, placed Miller as the 14th
largest private company in the UK.
Group chief executive Keith Miller seemed a bit non-plussed when he heard the
news. ``Being the `largest private company in Scotland' is a nice tag line, but
what we're really interested in is the bottom line, which is profit,'' he said.
``Our philosophy is, profit margins come first and turnover levels are second.''
Miller will have a better idea how its bottom-line margins are faring after
December 31, the end of its fiscal year.

A PERJURY trial was postponed yesterday because of the illness of the accused.
Mrs Jill Thornley, 51, had collapsed in the dock at Stranraer Sheriff Court on
Friday and was taken to hospital.
Yesterday, Sheriff Robert Dickson was shown a medical certificate stating that
Mrs Thorley was unfit to stand trialand invited submissions from both the Crown
and the defence legal teams.
Mr James Kelman, depute-fiscal, accepted that Mrs Thornley was unfit to stand
trial, asked leave to raise a fresh indictment, and asked for an extension to
the 12-month limit on the case, which is due to expire on January 30.
Mr Neville Shaffer QC, defence counsel, said it was quite clear that his client
was unfit to continue with the trial and added that he was not opposed to any
of the requests from the fiscal.
Sheriff Dickson agreed to the fiscal's requests and discharged the jury.
Mrs Thorley, of Knocknar Monreith, Port William, faces charges of perjury and
attempting to pervert the course of justice.
It is alleged that on August 17, 1994, during an inquiry at Stranraer Sheriff
Court into the death of Mr Daniel Lowe, a patient at Hillcrest Retirement Home,
Wigtown, she said her son Robert Thorley was the sleep-in member of staff at
the home on the evening of February 6, 1994, and that the level of staff was
sufficient to take it within social work guidelines, when she knew that Mr
Thorley was not at the home and that the only member of staff was Ms Marie
Blackley.
It is also alleged that between February 6 and August 17, 1994, she induced Mr
Thorley and Ms Blackley to give false information and false evidence at the
fatal accident inquiry at Stranraer Sheriff Court.

CUSTOMERS who have been flocking for their Christmas shopping to Costco, the
American-style discount store in Glasgow's Springburn, have been fair taken by
one of their lines. It is a 6ft-tall stuffed orang-utan, ideal for the weans
for to romp around with.
But one customer, a West End lady, was concerned that the orang-utan did not
appear to have the all-important safety tag as issued by the European Union. So
it was no go. But the West End husband was quite keen and asked the Costco
checkout staff if the beast did in fact have a safety certificate. The staff
said they would check and get in touch.
Thus it was by the time the West Enders got home there was a message on their
answering machine from an American chap who had been seconded from the US to be
a manager in Springburn.
He confirmed that he had been in touch with the suppliers of the stuffed
orang-utans - in South Korea - and it did indeed have the relevant safety tag.
``Due to the large amount of fur on the orang-utan, it may be difficult to
locate the tag. For future information, the tag is located on the animal's
bum.''
So, if you see customers at the Costco store in Springburn lift a large
orang-utan, turn it upside down, and carefully inspect its nether parts, they
are doing so only to make sure it is safe for their children.

neighbours' to alert friends using an agreed cascade system.''
Parting shot
JOHN Murtagh, artistic director of Borderline Theatre Company, was deposed in a

of the Borderline board. He was due to open four days later at the Magnum
Centre as the dame in Babes in the Wood panto which he had also written and
directed.
Also in his pay poke, which he received just before the shock news of his
dismissal, there was a wee homily, an exhortation from Borderline to all
employees about better communication with your co-workers.
Invisible man
PEOPLE say Jim Farry, secretary of the Scottish Football Association, has no
sense of hunour but we have evidence to the contrary. Donald Finlay, QC,
vice-chairperson of Rangers FC has been in constant communication of late to Mr
Farry protesting about the unfairness of various SFA ordinances and treatment
of certain Rangers players.
Mr Farry has faithfully replied but all of the letters have been addressed to
Mr R Campbell Ogilvie, secretary of Rangers FC. Mr Finlay is a man who does not
like to be ignored so he wrote to Mr Farry requesting that at least have the
decency to write back to him in person.
Mr Farry replied to Mr Finlay's plea with the explanation that the SFA always
communicated with member clubs through the office of their secretary. Yes, the
letter explaining this was sent to Mr R Campbell Ogilvie, secretary of Rangers
FC.

WELSH Water and South Wales Electricity have called a truce and agreed to merge
in a cash and shares deal worth #872m. News of the bid propelled Swalec shares
up 57p to 1165p, while Welsh Water gained 16p to 703p.
Welsh Water is offering one new share plus #40.25 for every five Swalec shares,
valuing the company at 940p a share. There is a cash alternative of 930p.
Swalec shareholders will keep their shares in the National Grid company after
the deal.
A statement from the two companies said the equivalent value of the offer would
be #11.34 with the National Grid interest, which would represent a premium of
22% over the price of Swalec shares prior to bid speculation. The acquisition
is expected to be materially earnings enhancing for Welsh Water April 1, 1996
and will enable it to achieve better dividend payouts.
Welsh Water's chief executive Graham Hawker said the deal would allow Welsh
Water to ``gear up the balance sheet quite significantly''. The combined
company will face a tax charge similar to Welsh's 12%. Up until the merger
Swalec has had a 23% rate.
Mr Hawker said the cost savings from merger of the two firms with their
geographical and customer overlap were ``substantial'', thought to be as high
as #30m.
The deal is the second union between a regional electricity company (REC) and a
water company. North West set the ball rolling in September with a #1580m bid
for Norweb. The bid was raised to #1800m and succeeded in November.
While it had been envisaged that RECs would be attractive to outside predators,
it was never thought that a privatised water and electricity company would
merge, resulting in a multi-utility group serving the same customer base.
Water companies have faced big capital expenditure programmes since
privatisation in order to comply with stricter EU legislation governing
quality. These have resulted in cash outflows. Faced with such an outflow, it
makes sense for a water company to acquire a cash generator such as a REC.
Since privatisation five years ago, the cash generating capacity of the RECs
has enabled them to grow underlying dividends by around 15% per annum. In a
similar time, water companies have grown theirs by about 10% per annum, but at
the cost of falling dividend cover.
Given the multiple attractions of owning a REC, despite the prospect of more
competition, there are likely to be no shortage of suitors for the remaining
independent RECs.
n The European Commission is to investigate Lyonnaise des Eaux's #823m agreed
bid for Northumbrian Water. Last month's bid by the French group is the first
takeover of one of the 10 largest UK water companies.

SCOTTISH Homes is to consider a code of conduct for tenants throughout Scotland
involved in the transfer of their houses to alternative landlords, it was
announced yesterday.
The move was welcomed by the Freedom of Choice Campaign, which had the support
of Labour MPs John McAllion (Dundee East) and Sam Galbraith (Strathkelvin and
Bearsden).
Its secretary, Mrs Mary Reid, said: ``We have worked for a considerable time
for a code which would protect tenants, feeling that we could complain, but get
nowhere.''
She said the interests of tenants and their rights had to be protected, adding
that the organisation would be delighted if housing stock could be released to
help those waiting to be housed.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth said last week he would be willing to
consider the possibility of councils being allowed to bid for housing sold by
Scottish Homes.
The agency's agreement to consider a code of conduct follows talks between its
chairman, Sir James Mellon, and a delegation of campaigners.

<TEXT>
CHILD vandals caused the death of nine-year-old Craig Bottley in a blazing
flat, a sheriff ruled yesterday.
Sheriff Iain Pirie said Craig died as a direct result of the criminal
activities of a group of children who were completely outwith the control of
their parents. He said: ``Such conduct on the part of young children is
symptomatic of serious social problems, the resolution of which lies beyond the
scope of this inquiry.''
The sheriff was giving his findings after a fatal accident inquiry at Glasgow
Sheriff Court into Craig's death on October 3 last year.
His body was found in an unoccupied flat in Balgair Street, Possilpark,
Glasgow, after children set the tenement ablaze.
But after the ruling, Craig's parents Catherine and Fred Bottley said it was
unfair to lay all the blame on the children.
``The fire brigade and the council all made blunders and now they have blamed
the boys,'' Mr Bottley said.
Sheriff Pirie said it was the district council's intention that the property at
23 Balgair Street be demolished as part of general development.
On the afternoon of October 3 last year, the two remaining tenants left. At
about 4.30pm, three boys between the ages of 11 and 13 broke in by forcing the
``meshlite'' security sheeting from the half-landing window at the rear of the
building.
They made their way to the top flat and scattered rubbish and overturned
furniture left by the outgoing tenant.
In his findings, the sheriff said the three boys went downstairs and met other
boys including Craig.
All except Craig went to a first-floor flat and set fire to a polyurethane
foam-filled three-piece suite in the living room.
The fire took effect quickly and thick black toxic smoke engulfed the first and
second floors.
Sheriff Pirie said: ``Because of the rapid spread of smoke, heat, and fire,
Craig was trapped in the living room directly above the seat of the fire.''
The sheriff then described how firemen were confronted by a hostile crowd of
disorderly children who interfered with the hydrant water supply and breathing
apparatus and rolled lorry tyres downhill at the fire appliances.
He said the firefighters had no reason to believe the boy was trapped in the
building and no-one informed them.
It was only when smoke was clearing from the second floor that the boy's body
was discovered partly concealed under a section of bedroom unit.
Sheriff Pirie said there had been criticism by a solicitor for the family that
the fire brigade and in particular a station officer had failed to inquire
whether anyone was still in the building.
He said the station officer had no reason to believe                   anyone
was trapped in the building.

way through Singin' in the Rain but it appears that Gene Kelly was years ahead
of his time.
As he performed his ``terpsichorean delights with cheerful proletarian grace''
in 1952 - his umbrella no more than a prop - Kelly knew that a steady stroll
for shelter is the smart way to stay drier when it's raining cats and dogs.
To flee or not to flee.......that is the question that has for years taxed
scientists investigating man's natural instinct to dash for cover in a downpour.
Now researchers at Reading University have concluded that a steady stroll for
shelter is the smart way to stay drier.
Their experiments show that rapid movement into the path of raindrops results
in a more severe soaking than weathering the storm at normal walking pace.

Ice hockey
STRUGGLING Murrayfield Royals have been rocked by the walkout of talented young
forward Tommy Boll.
The Ayr-based player did not turn up for Sunday's defeat by first-division
leaders Blackburn Hawks, and last night team manager Billie Dunbar said:
``Tommy did not appear for training last Thursday and did not turn up for
Sunday's game. I've been told that he does not want to play for us again and is
fed up because he did not get on the ice during the first period of last
Tuesday night's game against Dumfries.''
Royals have lost 17 of their 20 league games this term, and Boll was a key man
in the side.
Dunbar added: ``I want to speak to him about this, but I'm disappointed if he
has decided to pack in, as he was progressing well with us. He won't get as
much ice time with another club as he will here.''
Cycling
COLIN Bark and Julian Hopper, of the Glasgow Nightingale Club, became the

A JUDGE has praised the courage and determination of a young man who is
rebuilding his life after he suffered severe brain damage in a road accident at
the age of 12.
Lord Marnoch was speaking at the Court of Session, where he awarded Mr Maurice
O'Connor, 19, damages of #207,263.
Mr O'Connor has managed to gain a number of Standard Grade passes and has
recently started a computer course with the ultimate aim of gaining a Higher
National Certificate.
Although he can no longer pursue his ambition to become a professional fighter,
he still regularly attends training sessions at his boxing club.
Mr O'Connor, of Kilgarth Street, Coatbridge, had been crossing Viewfield Road
in the town when he was struck by a van in December 1988.
He suffered a severe brain injury and was in hospital for seven months. He has
been left with marked physical disabilities, the most serious of which is an
involuntary tremor in his limbs.
Lord Marnoch ruled that both Mr O'Connor and the van driver, Mr James Matthews,
of Rhinds Street, Coatbridge, should have seen each other in good time to avoid
the accident. He decided that Mr 0'Connor was 50% to blame for what happened.
The judge said there were a number of positive features about the case for
which Mr O'Connor was due praise.
Apart from his attendance at the boxing club, he had succeeded in obtaining a
number of Standard Grade passes and recently had started a course in computer
application at Motherwell College.
Lord Marnoch added: ``Whether he will succeed in this is perhaps questionable
but his determination to do so is not in doubt.
``He gave a good account of himself in the witness box and came across as an
extremely personable and likeable young man who bore his ills with humour and
fortitude.''
After the accident, Mr O'Connor went to Ashcraig School which, the judge was
informed, is well known for turning out its physically handicapped pupils with
social skills to do their best in the community.
``If that is so, then Mr O'Connor is a credit to these teaching methods,'' said
Lord Marnoch.
``However, it is important to realise that these skills cannot in the end truly
compensate for the underlying physical and intellectual disabilities from which
Mr O'Connor is suffering and which must be regarded as permanent.''
In the damages award, the judge included an element to cover loss of earnings,
after hearing evidence from an expert in rehabilitation that there was no real
prospect of Mr O'Connor obtaining profitable employment in the future.
Lord Marnoch said he had found the expert a thoughtful, careful, and reliable
witness but added: ``At the same time, it would not wholly surprise me if Mr
O'Connor were, in due course, to prove him wrong.''
