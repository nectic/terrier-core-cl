ROME: Three Italians, two missionaries and a female aid worker, were
found bayonetted to death in south-west Burundi yesterday near a church
where they were to celebrate morning mass. Italy's Foreign Ministry was
sending the ambassador from Uganda to Bujumbura to demand an immediate
inquiry.

THE opinions of the advocate-general, when ruling in the case of
Jean-Marc Bosman at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg last
week, have been welcomed by almost everybody interested in the future of
football, and more importantly, footballers.
The common view has been that footballers must be allowed to act as
free agents once their contract has expired. Of course, this is
acceptable in most walks of life. However, the sport of football is
different: it is essentially an entertainment business, while also being
a participation sport; you do not force footballers into their
occupation, but is this the case in other jobs?
As well as being entertainment, the football club often provides a
much-required focal point for a deprived community; helps to sustain
local businesses etc. This is why footballers cannot be considered as
say, a bricklayer.
Clubs, therefore, must continue to be allowed to recover outlay on
players who let their contracts run out; for many clubs, and communities
cannot afford to lose such assets; it could mean the difference between
new training facilities that will attract and develop future stars. The
opinions expressed in this regard by the advocate general for a fee for
clubs who develop stars is the minimum required for smaller clubs. But
the larger clubs must also be permitted to sell stars, and recover
massive outlays, in order to continue to help their local areas.

AMID the celebrations and congratulations regarding the hard-earned
Ryder Cup victory, it would be inappropriate to allow Sky TV's dreadful
coverage of the event to pass without comment.
Obviously, commercial breaks at regular intervals do not assist with
continuity, but it appeared at times that there was total lack of
communication between 'director(s)', cameramen, and commentators. On the
statistical side, overall summaries of match positions were too
infrequent and the particular game on camera lacked the vital
holes/shots information in the top right corner of the screen.
For goodness sake, BBC, put your hands deep in your pockets and give
golfers and golf spectators the benefit of your superior expertise and
teamwork in this particular field of sport.

I WAS greatly saddened to read of the dreadful accident suffered by
Gordon MacIntyre on the shinty pitch and my heartfelt best wishes go out
to this fine athlete and ambassador of the game.
However, the truly sickening aspect of this incident has been the
attitude taken by the Camanachd Association. This group have constantly
disregarded the safety of the players by stubbornly refusing to allow
the use of face visors. I am afraid that to continue to claim that
visors themselves would cause injury in a contact sport is now such a
pathetic argument that it would be laughable if not so damaging to the
interests of the players, its image to the world, and inevitably, to the
future of the game as a whole.
How the association can continue to deny that the game is speeding up,
players are hitting the ball harder, and therefore serious injury is
becoming much more common is beyond me. Considering that visors are now
a regular feature of hurling matches, does the Camanachd Association
continue to believe that shinty is in some unique situation where
blinding and face injuries remain a justifiable part of the game?
I am afraid that they are not and as parents and schools read of such
injuries they will prevent their own children from playing, losing them
to football and rugby.
I offer the above thoughts through bitter experience. More than a year
ago I was struck in the face by a ball hit from all of 15 yards. I would
like the Camanachd Association to answer to me for the week I spent in
Gartnavel Hospital opthalmic department under morphine, while the bones
of my cheek were repaired.
Is it justified to them that I should continue to suffer from blurred
vision, the pain of a pinned cheek, and permanent dilation of one eye,
all because those who have not lifted a caman in years tell us it would
be too dangerous to wear visors.
I have written to the president and chairman of the association on the
subject for which I did even receive the courtesy of a reply. In one of
those letters I said that it was simply a matter of time until someone
was blinded by either a stick or ball. My genuine sorrow is that it has
now occurred.
My fear, as I said, is for the game itself. Whilst we, the players,
are risking our heads and faces without proper protection, those who run
the game see fit to continue to bury theirs in the sand.

I HAVE read The Herald for quite a number of years now, because I like
to feel informed. Unfortunately your article and its presentation on the
recent shinty injuries will reinforce most readers' prejudices
concerning the apparent barbarity of this most misunderstood of sports.
Whilst wearing helmets sporting some form of face protection should,
if safe, be encouraged particularly among younger players, any
caman-wielder worth his salt herring will tell you that the best form of
protection is a sound blocking technique with the caman (stick for the
uninitiated), coupled with an appropriate level of fitness. The error
and subsequent injury generally comes with that failure in judgment
present in all fast, potentially dangerous sports.
The Herald normally devotes about five column inches per week to the
game; if the teuchters go mental it gets a quarter of a page.
I reckon it's time for you former highlanders to grow up. At least be
consistent and give the readership the customary amount of coverage
(with no room for sensationalism) or provide a mature, weekly
quarter-page so that they can be better informed about our true national
sport.

WITH reference to your interesting article in today's (27/09/95) paper
on the coverage of the Ryder Cup on SKY where you make comment about the
BBC's Grand Prix coverage.
Surely, excluding the edited highlights and repeats, the two to three
hours coverage is a relatively short time to cover each event live i.e.
about 50 hours per year when it can claim viewing figures
internationally for several hundred million.
The BBC can and does spend time on one snooker tournament.
While I will admit that grands prix are not everyones choice, I think
his assumption on its potential viewing figures is way off the mark.
Perhaps some research into events and viewing figures
nationally/internationally would be enlightening.

ON GASCOIGNE
If he can keep his act together then he will become a hero to the
Ibrox fans
ON RANGERS
The five years at Ibrox were the most rewarding of my career
ON SOUNESS
I had not played for some time and yet Graeme bought me and believed
in me
ON RAY WILKINS
I have played with Ray and his knowledge of the game is superb
ON THE FUTURE
I thought that the Premiership would offer me the challenge I still
need
WHEN Mark Hateley moves south to Queen Park Rangers within the next
few weeks, his injury problems behind him, he will end a five-year love
affair with Ibrox, and he will leave with the obvious regrets.
However, at the same time, Hateley,the perpetual professional, will go
to Loftus Road seeking to add to his already impressive soccer c.v.
At the week-end, as he continued his recovery from an ankle operation,
Hateley said: ''I have made a decision. I am leaving Rangers and going
on to another challenge and, you know me, when I move on I move on
without too many backward glances.
''I have to be motivated and when I realised that I was not going to
get the boost of the Champions' League, then I looked at the chance and
thought that the Premiership would offer me the challenge I still need.
''The other attraction was that I was going to be teaming up with Ray
Wilkins again. I mean, I know Ray, and I have played with Ray, and our
paths have crossed so often and I have tremendous admiration for him.
''His knowledge of the game is superb and the thought of working
alongside him again influenced my whole thinking on the move.''
Yet there was a wrench for Hateley and his family. He admits that. He
will miss his home in Helensburgh. He will miss the warmth of the
Scottish people. He will miss the Rangers' support who made his career
north of the Border so rewarding. And he will miss the winners' medals
which arrived with such regularity.
''The five years at Ibrox were the most rewarding of my career. I
don't think I have had better times,''he reminisced the other day.
''There have been so many good memories, so many ocasions which will
remain with me for the rest of my life. On a personal level, I think
about winning the two Player of the Year awards in the same season. One
from the Football Writers' Association and the other from the players
themselves.
''These are awards which count for a great deal. You cannot put a
price on them. It's impossible to say how much they meant to me at the
time, and still mean to me, and will always mean to me.
''And then I had two years helping Alastair McCoist win his Golden
Boot awards and that gives me some statisfaction as well, that I could
make some contribution to Alastair's goals in these couple of seasons.''
Hateley will always leave a piece of his heart at Ibrox and one of the
reasons for that is the faith shown in him by Graeme Souness when he
signed him from Monaco for a million pounds in the summer of l990.
''I was in a similar situation to Paul Gascoigne is now,'' he recalls.
''I had been a long-term injury victim and I had not played for some
time and yet Graeme bought me and he believed in me.
''I know that a lot of people criticised him and said he had made a
mistake in buying me but, over the years, I think I have been able to
answer anyone who made these noises back then. In 218 games I have
scored 114 goals for the club and I think it has been the best and most
productive period of my whole career.
''Rangers gave me a lift back to the big stage and I would like to
think, as I am leaving, that I have repaid them. That is what I have
wanted to do.
''I felt I had to give them something back. To some extent they
rescued my career after all the worries I had had in Monaco.
''I think Paul has arrived in the same way I did. People criticise
Rangers for buying him and they snipe about him but the other night he
showed what he can do at the very top European level. As far as I can
see, Paul has the ability to be a huge success with the club.
''It might not be easy for him because of the spotlight which is
focussed on him -- but if he can keep his act together then he will
become a hero to the Ibrox fans. And I know how rewarding that kind of
status can be.
''Honestly, if Paul can continue to play as he did against the
Germans, then he could be one of the biggest stars of all in the
European Championship Finals in England next summer.''
Hateley's move will carry him away from the huge Ibrox crowds and the
glamour of the Champions' League into a Premiership battle to keep the
Loftus Road club among the giants of the English game.
It is a thought he relishes. He claims: ''There are good young players
at QPR and I just want to get in there and try to help them by passing
on some of my experience. With Ray in charge, and with a young chairman
who is ready to back Ray's judgment, and young players who are keen to
learn, it will be an exciting time for me.
''Obviously, though, I'll still look for Rangers' results. I thought
they would have won the other night. I tipped a 3-2 victory and, when
you remember the two tries which hit the woodwork, I might have been
right.
''I still believe that qualification could go to the last game in
Dortmund and if that happens then you have to remember Marseille and how
well the team played there, and believe that they can take second place.
''I would not bet against them. And I believe they will be able to win
the ten titles in a row as well, and when they do I'll celebrate with
them and remember the little bits I was able to contribute to that
run.''

IT was difficult to know where to turn yesterday. There was so much
football available on the box that there was a real danger of
overloading the mental system.
The return of the game's enfant terrible, Eric Cantona, in Manchester
United's match against Liverpool was especially intriguing, but so, too,
was the match between Juventus and Napoli from Italy's Serie A. Also,
another Premiership match, Everton against Newcastle, demanded attention
as did the premier division game between Hibernian and Hearts at Easter
Road.
All that football and the European Grand Prix from the Nurburgring,
the Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe, and Hugh Duff in a major bowls
tournament. A sports fan could easily o.d. on days like yesterday, the
family coming home to find the victim twitching on the axminster and
mumbling: ''Ooh ah Cantona . . . come on my son . . . Vialli's in pole
position.''
Sunday had never been so good, but while it was a pleasure to be able
to look in on so much sport, provided, of course, your house has
attached to it one of those ridiculous dishes which makes the old semi
look like an air-traffic control tower, the danger of having such a wide
choice must be examined again. We must also ask ourselves some serious
questions about where exactly we are heading now that sport has been
handed over to television executives.
The various associations, especially in football, are still in
existence and continue to give the impression they remain in charge, but
their power is being diluted. That is the price they must pay for
accepting television's millions.
The offers are always attractive, usually almost impossible to resist,
and while it was suspected from the beginning that the TV companies
eventually would demand greater control for their money, the signals
were ignored. Now, there is way too much football on television and it
isn't healthy. Having taken the money, football has come to rely on the
handouts, and the executives who sanction the payments realise they have
the advantage and are intent on getting their money's worth.
Matches now kick off at strange times and practically on any day or
night, but that isn't the real threat to the sport. Television coverage
is beginning to kill the desire to rummage around in the back of the
cupboard for the scarf and venture out to the game.
Anyone in authority who can't see that some fans of the little clubs
are finding it increasingly difficult to make the effort to go and
support their teams is not looking properly. Then again maybe they are
turning away deliberately, unwilling to look at the manner in which the
game is being undermined. The problem is not confined to Scotlamd.
When the best club tournament UEFA have ever devised, the Champions'
League, fails to attract full houses there must be something seriously
amiss and the problem may run deeper than inflated ticket prices such as
those which Rangers are asking their fans to pay. Prices range from #21
to #30 for Rangers' home games and last midweeek when they played
Borussia Dortmund in the first of their home Champions League ties only
33,000 paid up, but it is likely the usual 40-odd thousand would have
been in place had the game not been on TV.
However, had Rangers offered their tickets at more realistic prices
they might have been one of the few clubs in the competition able to
sell out even with live TV coverage.
The Champions' League does have enormous apeal and there are so many
people around the world desperate to catch some of the action, but by
showing the games live fans are not encouraged to man the stands and
that weakens the actual tension and passion inside the grounds. The
atmosphere is not as charged with excitement and that is a great pity.
Every football fan relishes the big European night when there is a
tingle of anticipation. The journeys to the game, no matter how long,
were undertaken happily and it used to be that the weather didn't matter
either. The cold and the damp were dismissed immediately the floodlights
could be seen in the distance.
These were the kind of nights which made mundane league matches
bearable, yet now we are seeing wide open spaces inside grounds.
Television is much too easy an option and it is throwing up a serious
contradiction. The cash from TV companies is needed badly but so, too,
are supporters and the more matches they are offered inside their own
homes or in their locals the easier it becomes for them to stay away.
It is depressing to say the least when two major teams walk out to
perform in a big stadium in an important competition and around them the
players see empty seats. It isn't supposed to be like this and perhaps
it wouldn't be if there were fewer matches shown on TV.
The clubs themselves are not blameless because they want television's
money and they are making vast amounts even if their grounds are not
full, but they owe it to the game's traditions and to their players to
ensure the arenas are vibrant, seething places.
Television people say it isn't in their interests to have empty seats,
but don't listen to them, because their raison d'etre is to have as many
people as possible at home, eyes fixed on the box. They don't care if
they ruin the game and if eventually they arrive at the conclusion that
football without fans in residence is not the same they will turn their
cameras away from our pitches and focus on some other sport.
Football is playing a dangerous game which it might not win.

DENISE Booker shot a closing-round 70 yesterday to pull off a maiden
Tour victory when she won the Italian Open at Il Picciolo in Sicily.
With an eight-under-par 284, 23-year-old Booker, just 105th on the
merit table at the start of the week, finished one stroke ahead of
Spain's Amaia Arruti.
Booker, born in Kent and who moved to Australia at the age of one, had
won only #2265 from 13 tournaments before deciding to make a late entry
to play in Italy.
''My funds were getting low, but I decided to play.'' she explained,
after haing collected a #15,000 winner's cheque.
''It was a good decision and I have now escaped having to go to the
Tour qualifying school.''
Booker had started the final round one stroke behind Arruti, winner of
the title two years ago, but had drawn level when she reached the turn
in 35.
Booker had gone ahead with a birdie at the short fifteenth then Arruti
drew level with a birdie two holes later but going for another birdie at
the long eighteenth, ran three feet past the hole then missed the
return, for Booker to become the Tour's fifth first-time winner of the
year.
Scotland's Julie Forbes had been only two strokes off the lead moving
into the final round, but a closing 77 dropped her back into a share of
fifth place on 292.
It lifted the Aboyne golfer into eighteenth place on the merit table
to lead the Scots, three places ahead of Dale Reid. Leading scores (GB

FRED Funk birdied two of the final three holes to clinch a one-stroke
victory at the $1m Buick Challenge in Pine Mountain, Georgia, yesterday.
Seven players were within one shot late in the final round as the
leaderboard changed almost by the minute, but Funk emerged from the pack
to win with a five-foot birdie putt at the final hole at Callaway
Gardens.
He finished on 16-under-par 272, one stroke ahead of fellow Americans
Loren Roberts and John Morse, both of whom missed birdie putts at the
final hole.
''It makes all the hard work worthwhile,'' Funk, 39, said after having
received a cheque for $180,000 for his third US Tour victory, his second
this year.
''I wasn't uptight until the last couple of holes,'' he said. ''I just
wanted to be in a position to have a chance to win. Obviously the breaks
fell my way.''
Funk, who shot a closing five-under 67 after having started the final
round tied for the lead, birdied the par-three sixteenth after a
No.4-wood to 15 feet.
He made a fine par save at the seventeenth, where he got up-and-down
from 30 yards, before hitting a brilliant No.6 iron to set up his
final-hole birdie.
''It was about as easy a putt as I could have to win a tournament,''
he said. ''It was straight down the grain but I was a nervous wreck.''
Morse had the most reason to be disappointed, after having missed a
10-foot birdie chance at the seventeenth, and leaving a 15-footer at the
last short.
Roberts continued the strong form he displayed to win three of his
four matches at last week's Ryder Cup, but for the second week he came
up just short of his goal.
''I felt steady over the ball all day,'' said Roberts, who made five
birdies in a flawless 67. ''I played solid again. I didn't miss a
fairway and I only missed one green.
''The first two days I left a lot of strokes out there. I bogeyed
three of the last four holes on Thursday. Looking back, I lost the
tournament there.'' Final scores (US unless stated):
272 -- F Funk 69, 67, 69, 67.
273 -- L Roberts 70, 69, 67, 67; J Morse 71, 68, 67, 67.
274 -- G Boros 68, 69, 72, 65; J Sluman 67, 69, 70, 68; K Triplett 71,
66, 69, 68.
275 -- D Ogrin 70, 68, 70, 67.
276 -- S Hoch 70, 70, 69, 67; J Huston 67, 71, 70, 68; L Nelson 71,
65, 70, 70; S Stricker 66, 67, 72, 71.
Other scores included:
279 -- G Norman (Australia) 71, 68, 72, 68.
281 -- B Crenshaw 70, 70, 69, 72.

A JOINT third place in the Smurfit European Open at the K Club, near
Dublin, yesterday was enough to take Colin Montgomerie, the No.1 for the
last two years, back to the top of the European Order of Merit. The
#36,595 was just sufficient to edge Monty ahead of his fellow-Scot and
close friend Sam Torrance.
A tired Torrance could only finish with a 73 which left him well down
the field. In the all-important money table Montgomerie now has #626,651
while Torrance has earned #625,671.
There are, however, two counting tournaments to go this season, the
German Masters this week and Volvo Masters at Valderrama at the end of
the month. ''We will be slugging it out to the end,'' promised Torrance,
his words immediately echoed by his great rival.
''The order of merit is the only reason I came to Ireland,'' confessed
Montgomerie. ''I am mentally exhausted after the Ryder Cup and I am sure
Sam is too. But the title of No.1 means a lot to me.''
It looked as though England's Barry Lane was going to romp away with
yesterday's #108,000 first prize. He had been at the head of the field
since the first day and was playing steadily in the gusty, showery
conditions.
Lane was two shots clear of the field as he stood on the seventeenth
tee. Just ahead of him, at the eighteenth, however, the German maestro
Bernhard Langer, sank a 70-foot putt for an eagle 3 and a 68 which also
included three birdies. Lane took three from the edge of the eighteenth
green, so he and Langer set off for a sudden death play-off.
They halved the first extra hole, the eighteenth, with birdies, though
Langer nearly put his second in the water. At the next Lane hit his
second into a bunker but came out to four feet. He never got a chance to
putt. Bernhard, his putter now on fire, swept a 25-footer into the hole.
''I really love coming to Ireland -- I led my first professional
tournament in this country and the supporters are something special,''
declared Langer. ''So is my putter.''
Poor Lane -- he has now made it to three play-offs and lost all of
them. ''There is not much you can do against putting like that,'' he
observed mildly. ''I probably blew my chances when I hit that No.7 iron
too long at the eighteenth.''
Langer, another of the Ryder Cup heroes, had been complaining of
feeling sleepy all week. ''I stay in bed for 10 hours and still wake up
tired,'' he related. There was nothing dozy about his finish.
It was also remembered by many that after the last Ryder Cup in
America -- when he missed a vital putt -- Langer bounced back to win the
German Masters the following week.
It was his thirty-fourth European Tour victory and his third of the
season. ''My swing has improved every day this weekend,'' he said, and
who was going to argue?
Montgomerie finished on 283, sharing the spot with American Jay
Townsend. Yet the big Scot certainly made a brave effort to come even
closer.
He birdied the first and third, both times suberb iron play leaving
him small putts. At the seventh he hit his second into the River Liffey
then saved his par with an eight-foot putt.
At the long thirteenth, Monty cracked a majestic No.3 wood over trees
to set up another birdie. Sadly, at the very next hole he hit a No.5
iron left of the green and his challenge faded.
''I cannot be anything but satisfied with the way things have worked
out.''
The next best Scot was Aberdeen's Paul Lawrie, who finished on
one-under with a final round of 73. This will shoot him up the order of
merit from his previous 118th spot.
''I did not make any putts out there today,'' said Lawrie, ''but I
have played well tee to green all week.
The sorry saga of Sandy Lyle drags on. He began brilliantly with three
birdies in the first seven holes, threatening to challenge for the big
money. Instead, in the kind of roller-coaster his supporters have
learned to suffer, he destroyed his round with bogeys at the tenth and
twelfth plus a ghastly 8 at the sixteenth. He was in water, dropped out,
and hit it straight back in again.
He then finished with two birdies for a 76. ''I played like a
millionaire, giving away money like it didn't matter,'' he reflected
ruefully. Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
280 -- B Langer (Germany) 74, 70, 68, 68 (won at second extra hole,

''TIME cannot extinguish Maradona's genius,''gushed an Argentinian
newspaper as the somewhat portly 34-year-old player made his fourth
comeback to football. The prose flowed thick and fast as the fallen hero
marshalled a rusty Boca Juniors to a 2-1 victory against the Korean
national side in Seoul. ''An oasis of clarity and technical
refinement,'' bellowed La Nacion.
Older and wider, Diego Maradona returned to a game blunted by 15
months of his absence on a doping ban. The fallen hero of world soccer
according to one paper still ''represents the most popular sport on
earth.''

BEBETO equalled a Spanish league record with five goals yesterday,
four of them in the final six minutes, to give Deportivo La Coruna a 5-0
victory over Albacete.
The 31-year-old Brazilian, born Jose Roberto Gama de Oliveira, led the
Spanish league with 29 goals in 1994 and had three in his first four
games this season. He took only two minutes to get started.
With Deportivo clinging to a 1-0 lead late on, Bebeto added goals
after 84, 85, 87 and 89 minutes.

LAST Thursday was there not Tommy Craig, Aberdeen FC and Scotland
Under-21 coach, telling Ms Edie Stark, of Radio Scotland, that football
was an art form. And of course he's right. Sometimes it is even genius.
The reason why I will argue that Pele, for instance, was actually a
genius is because he thought of things which nobody else did. The
greatest goal scored wasn't scored. It was when Pele dummied
Czechoslovakia's keeper, Viktor, in the Mexico World Cup finals.
Odd though, that the plastic arts, painting, sculpture, the visual
arts, have had so little contact with the people's art and indeed any
form of sport. Some of the greatest writers of this century have
centered on sport. Do not forget that Ernest Hemmingway, Ring Lardner,
Damon Runyon, A J Leibling, admittedly all Americans, were originally
sports writers.
Every major sports crescendoes, from the Olympics to the footy finals,
to a humble sports telly show, has to have the grandest and most
pompous, and sometimes affecting, snatches of classical music. I once,
in a pub, wept at Nessun Dorma, along with a hundred others when
Pavarotti sang it and we were only watching a television set for
heaven's sake.
So art is there. But, for a world-wide multi-billion dollar industry
in which a multi-million audience from Sumatra to Tierra Del Fuego, it
does seem strange that so few visual artists in the most visual
entertainment we know, have bothered to chronicle the largest shows on
earth.
Thus you have something strange, I suspect I have a first in sports
journalism: an art review. ''This Sporting Life'' was the title of the
exhibition in the newly-opened Leith Gallery in, where else, Leith, and
opened by giant boy wonder Gordon Sherry.
Paintings and prints of billiard tables -- there is an elegant an
rather erotic painting by Terence Macklin, with the girls who disport
themselves at major snooker events making themselves up and sporting,
(Ha!) nylons. It's a nice bright painting.
So are the splendid paintings of horses and racecourses and, well
horses. Robert Sanders has a magnificently fluid painting of a splendid
girl in a summer hat against a vivid, lime green sward of a racecourse.
Actually she is wearing clothes as well as a summer hat but it is a good
painting all the same, with, and I say this as an artist and critic as
well as a failed punter, with some authority. But I write with some
bemusement, too.
There are prints and paintings -- and they are very reasonably priced
indeed -- of a number of sports in this show. Many a pub and bistro
would be glad to have seen this exhibition, for such places ever have an
interest in sport or at least their customers do.
Golfers would gape at smashing prints signed and delivered. Up-market
bookies would love the signed prints from Clare Eve Burton or Graham
Ison, both of whom adoringly illustrate horses and racecourses, the
sheer frisson of the races. But racehorses are simply among the most
beautiful creatures on earth. And more than that, there is a history of
fine art when it comes to the Sport of Kings.
Some of the greatest paintings of Edgar Degas were of racehorses, the
dumb animal equivalents of ballet dancers. Indeed, Glasgow Art Gallery
and Museum at Kelvingrove has perhaps one of the most elegiac paintings
of beats ever seen; the racehorses in the rain, a lovely pastel. Easy to
have art out of horses. A long tradition in equine painting too,
starting with Stubbs. But what of other sports?
In the late 1920's the New York Ashcan School attempted to portray
ordinary and everyday life, including sport. Arthur Bellows went as far
as to depict boxing matches, complete with ringside gore, and a prurient
proletariat. Even 50 years later his paintings -- now worth fortunes --
were considered vulgar but why? And why are so few artists interested in
the largest entertainment focus of all, in sport? Sure I seem to
remember Peter Howson foraying a little into, in fact boxing scenes. But
where is, for instance, soccer?
A couple of months back, Celtic accepted a bronze bust of the late
Jock Stein. It is not in fact, much of a work of art. It's not bad, but
it's not good either.
Celtic also has a painting of the great man, which used to hang in the
Jock Stein Suite. Though the painting is honest and a sincere tribute to
the colossus of Scottish, indeed world football, it could have been
painted by a talented fifth-year pupil from a photograph, and I suspect
it was.
Were there no artists out there who sought sittings with Jock Stein?
Or other football, and sporting, heroes either? These football clubs and
cricket and golf emporiums are worth a fortune, and their members and
business cohorts are as well.
Did it never occur to any of those people to commission an artist to
immortalise the great sportsmen of a sporting century and a half. It did
to the Victorian Corinthians. There must be more bronze busts of W G
Grace than there are of Prince Albert and that is saying much. Myself, I
want an entire stookie of Albert Murphy, and that's a fact. Crossing
himself.

PAUL Gascoigne deserves his success. He is entitled to take any money
sponsors wish to throw at him, even the absurd amounts Adidas are
offering. His football talents, his foibles, and his propensity to claim
headlines at both ends of our newspapers make him a name with which
others want to be associated. That they are all willing to pay for
little Gazza pieces is not his fault.
If there are wrongs -- and I'm certain there are -- in the manner in
which much of the money spent on sport is funnelled, then the blame lies
with those who control the finance and not with individual recipients.
But it is not only the fan who is asked to pay up to #30 a ticket to see
Rangers play in the Champions' League, who recognises the sharp
imbalance in all of this.
In other sporting fields there are athletes, champions even, who
through eyes which sting as droplets of sweat trickle off their brows
see great injustices in a world so dominated by the rustle of banknotes
that all perspective and sense of priority has been lost. Gascoigne can
be given an incentive of #2.5m to wear Adidas boots while someone like
Graeme Obree pursues his own goals in relative anonymity and with little
financial backing.
If we need heroes then we should not look beyond the 30-year-old from
Ayrshire. Against odds which would overwhelm all but the most powerfully
single-minded he is becoming the stuff of true sporting legend. The
establishment in the cycling world would like Obree to pedal off into
the sunset, but he refuses to go and only last week he almost literally
reached the top of the world.
Obree went to Colombia and, high up in the thin air there, he
travelled through the fabled pain barrier and emerged world 4000 metres
individual pursuit champion a year after his bike had been deemed
illegal by his sport's Italian-dominated authorites. His machine, which
he constructed himself, outlawed and no sign of a big-time backer . . .
that would have been the time for Obree to turn and walk away.
Few would have blamed him had he done so, but knowing he had been
wronged made him stronger and more determined. Even then there was a
dark period at the end of last year when he was given cause to look
beyond the horizons of sport and suddenly bicycle racing appeared
inconsequential.
His brother, Gordon, died after a road accident last October. Parents
Marcia and John, sister Yvonne, and Graeme's wife Anne were left to cope
with their loss. They all required time to come to terms with the death
of their son and brother, who was a BA in electronics and who held a
private pilot's licence. Then, in January of this year, Obree was sacked
by the Le Groupement team who claimed he had lacked loyalty and
enthusiasm.
Obree, in fact, was suffering from an unspecified illness at the time
he was supposed to report for training in the Alps and sent a medical
certificate, but his French employers dismissed him even though he was
only five days into his contract. It was suspected that Gordon's death
affected him badly, but Obree said: ''I'll be back and I'll be fine.
Don't worry about that.''
His triumph in Colombia suggests Obree has overcome his problems, and
even the obvious displeasure of the sport's bureaucrats, who may simply
just have a dislike of some upstart Scot who appeared suddenly in the
mid-eighties and who was laughed at because of his peculiar
downhill-skier position. When he broke the the world one-hour record in
1993 the authorities were not amused and they went out of their way to
make life difficult.
Contrary to popular belief his bike was not illegal, it was his riding
style which didn't please the International Cycling Union. He was
disqualified from last year's world championships, but as we know now he
returned last week and became champion proving that he will not be
bullied or beaten.
His success was close to the anniversary of his brother's death and
his after having watched his final in her daughter's home his mother
said: ''Gordon's death hit us all very hard. We have all lost some
relatives, but the death of a child is something else.
''It hit Graeme particularly hard. There were just 14 months between
them. He and Gordon were like twins, and nobody was more proud of Graeme
than Gordon.''
Graeme intends now to regain the world hour record (55.291km) from
Tony Rominger in Manchester in a fortnight's time and his other aim is
Olympic gold. ''There have been times when I have thought 'it isn't
worth it,' but thenI remember Peter Gabriel's song Don't Give Up and I
carry on,'' he said.
''It was good to come back after what I had been through emotionally
and with the ICU. In January and February there were few people who
thought I could come back and win the world title, but even when I made
a bad debut in my comeback race at Easter I was determined not to
suender.
''The ICU officials thought I was finished when they outlawed my
riding style and I never doubted I would regain this world track
title.''
Having been denied the right to use the style which suited him, Obree
devised another position which he calls the ''superman position'' and
still the union made rigorous checks of his bicycle before his races in
Colombia. He watched them fuss, looking for infringements and his
determination grew.
''Before I was rated only a good mechanic, but not a good athlete.
Does winning back the title prove I am a good athlete?'' he asked. ''I
admit to some satisfaction in that these same people who banned me had
to hand me my gold medal.
''I could see they were biting down on their lips, but when someone
tries to stop me from doing something I become more determined.
''However, I don't want to rant and rave, I don't like people who do
that. The beauty of having won the title back is that I don't have to
say anything for myself.''
There is something about Obree when he speaks, something innocent,
almost naive, yet every now and then the remarkable inner stength of
this young father of two boys, Ewan and Jamie, emerges. He is one of
those rare individuals who would succeed in any walk of life because he
has the desire and the capacity to suffer the pain and heartache which
stand between the ordinary and the great.
Now he is confronted by a paradoxical problem. While his sport has
made him rely almost exclusively on himself in that he must train alone
and race alone, he needs financial backing, a sponsor, to help him
prepare properly fo the Olympics.
He described the last three laps of last week's final against against
Italian Andrea Collinelli as ''an out-of-body experence'' because oxygen
was short and thinking straight had become difficult. He was operating
by memory. An athlete can do that only if the preparation has been
correct. His work for the challenge in Colombia began in March and he
will need to dedicate himself now to the Olympics in Atlanta next year.
''But I need a sponsor now to get me to the Olympics,'' he said. He
would be value for money because gold could be the reward for whichever
company or companies sponsor his efforts.

ARTHURLIE swept over Dunipace 4-0 to maintain their 100% league record
and secure top spot in the Reebok Premier Division.
The Dunterlie Park team -- scoring almost at will this season -- has
now rattled in 17 goals in four games as they attempt to mount an early
challenge which can help them prise the title back from fierce rivals,
Pollok.
Striker Colin Crichton was again on the ball, underlining his
reputation as one of the best frontmen in the junior game.
His potent goal-a-game ratio has delighted manager Fergie Ferguson,
who snatched Crichton from Shettleston during the summer.
''There aren't too many clinical strikers around in junior football,
so to have a player like Colin in the side is a big advantage.''
Ferguson stated.
Big money signing from Glenafton, Scott Archer grabbed one of the
other three goals, along with junior internationalist David Fulton and
Mark Donnachie.
Pollok bounced back from their shock Abercorn Cup final defeat by
Blantyre Vics to scrape a 3-2 win at Larkhall, while Maryhill and
Shettleston fought out a 1-1 draw.
Youngster Scott McHarg scored for 'Hill with Pat Kelly levelling for
Town.
Petershill moved into the second round of the Whyte &amp; MacKay Cup after
a battling 4-2 win at Largs Thistle.
The Ayrshire side were confident of winning after a 1-1 draw at
Springburn a fortnight ago in the first game, but their hopes were
dented when David Cowan gave Peesies the lead.
However, strikes from Jim Meechan and Pat McCurdy put Largs in front,
before Eric Kielty forced extra time.
Jim George's side then stepped up a gear, and Derek Kennedy's goal
took them in front before Cowan added his second to seal the tie.
Kilsyth came through the other Whyte &amp; MacKay first round replay 3-2
on penalty kicks after their game with Lanark had ended three goals
apiece.
In the Western First Division Cumnock suffered their first reverse of
the season when Irvine Meadow defeated them 2-1.
Phillips and Arthur were the scorers for Meadow, with Montgomery
replying for Cumnock.
Livingston pulled off the shock result of the day in the east when
they sent Camelon spinning out of the Skol League cup with a 1-0 defeat.
And on Tayside, Tayport came out tops in the crucher with Dundee St
Joseph's courtesy of a single goal win. Results:

Aberdeen 3, Raith Rovers 0
ABERDEEN'S new record signing, Paul Bernard, will have to battle for a
place in the now settled team which defeated Raith Rovers with a
determined and entertaining performance.
For seven games in a row the line-up has been the same with the
exception of goalkeeper Michael Watt, who has performed well enough to
keep his place for the last three matches since he took over from Theo
Snelders, when the Dutchman missed a cup match to welcome home his new
baby.
Roy Aitken has instilled in his Aberdeen team a determination to
ensure they are competing at the top of the league this season and not
within the relegation zone, and with each game their confidence is
rising, and more of the flair they are capable of is emerging.
They are still prone to lapsing into spells of lethargy, and Aitken
was quickly on the touchline to bellow a few choice words to shake them
out of it when it happened against the Fifers.
Six minutes into the game Jess, McKimmie, and Dodds linked well to
slice apart a shaky Raith defence and leave Booth to tap the ball into
the net for the opener.
Raith deserved a penalty midway through the first half when Inglis
brought down McInally, but the referee, who was on the spot, waved play
on, and when play switched to the other end, Booth sent in a perfect
cross for Miller to head in. Booth scored the third with his head from
Hetherston's cross in 71 minutes.
Aitken said afterwards that scoring just three had let Raith Rovers
off lightly, but he was not unduly worried about the squandered
opportunities.
''I would have worried if we hadn't scored three,'' he said. ''But I
will settle for making 10 chances and scoring three.''
Bernard replaced Miller for the last 25 minutes of the game and gave
the crowd a fair indication of his considerable ability, which certainly
includes robust tackling.
Scott Booth has played with him in the Scotland Under-21 team and
said: ''He is a quality player who is very good on the ball, agile, sets
up attacks, and puts great tackles in as well, so he will benefit us.''
Aitken was impressed by his brief debut but made it clear that his #1m
tag will not mean automatic first-team football.
''He is an asset to the squad and like everyone else he is fighting
for a place.''
Jimmy Nicholl kept his feelings to himself about the game and declined
to speak to the press. He perhaps was preoccupied about what Bayern
Munich might do to them in the UEFA Cup if they perform
uncharacteristically poorly again.

THERE'S a touch of frost in the air, leaves are turning gold and
tumbling from trees, and nights are getting shorter. To many it's a time
for pulling chairs closer to the fire and hibernating. But to The Breed
Apart the onset of winter is viewed with gloom. Their raison d'etre is
under threat.
Look around at any golf club. They'll be sitting near the bar --
twitchy and sullen-faced, muttering dire predictions about rain and
snow. Generally they are the male of the species. These are the true
fanatics, who put Old Firm supporters in the shade, zealots who could
make religious fundamentalists seem tame.
For three seasons of the year they play golf most evenings and then
retire to the clubhouse for a pint with their friends and moan about
'Her' PMT, the children's constant demands, and the three-foot putt that
got away.
In summer they hunt in packs with their Wednesday fourball as
immovable on the calendar as the arrival of Santa Claus. Often they have
a leader whose word is law. He arranged the tee times and checks that
the others are available. A father figure, The guru salves their sagging
egos when their game is off and chides them if they are late.
On the course they are politeness personified until they encounter
slow play or women. The ladies of the club, commonly known as vermin,
are anathema. But this can be disguised. So as they head up the
fourteenth, The Breed Apart will wave encouragingly across to the
unsuspecting female foursome walking up the sixteenth while one mutters
out of the side of his mouth: ''Face like a gargoyle, swing like a
chimp.''
But there's no way to fight Mr Winter Chills . . . or is there?
There's always the delights of the winter league and The Breed Apart
are nothing if not wily. So they will go to almost any lengths to keep
on playing and avoid ferrying the children to parties or, worse still,
washing the car.
So come mid-November, when even Captain Scott would have stayed
indoors, they are poised on the first tee with more layers of clothes on
than Michelin Man and with a series of accessories in their bags to
counter the weather.
First there's the handwarmer. This mysterious object, probably bought
from one of those catalogues of useless appliances, is kept in the
pocket for occasional use. It cannot be used for balls -- of the dimpled
variety -- even in brass-monkey weather. It's a pity the catalogue
doesn't have a melt-your-own-snow machine.
Then, to keep their heads warm, they resort to all kinds of devices
from lurid pom-pommed hats to balaclavas. They could easily be mistaken
for amateur rapists.
Bags will be stuffed with Mars Bars and assorted confectionery not to
mention the hipflask. Should the course be unplayable they will head for
the coast in the hope that the seaside links courses have escaped the
worst of the snow. If not, the pool table might enter the reckoning.
Even satellite television in the clubhouse means there's a faraway
tournament to watch over a pint.
If the worst comes to the worst there's that week away to Spain or
Portugal. You know the one, boys. ''I really need a break darling. I've
been working so hard lately. Of course I really don't want to go but I
can't let the others down. A threeball would be out of the question.''
This conversation can be heard simultaneously in four homes. The Guru
always has been a master tactician.
For no matter how bad your golf gets, boys, it's always better than
shoving a trolley round the supermarket. What would The Guru say if he
caught you with a half-priced cabbage in your hands?

PRINCE Naseem Hamed was labelled as Britain's own Sugar Ray Leonard
after his whipping fists flogged Steve Robinson in front of his own
Cardiff public.
Promoter Frank Warren also tossed in the names of Marvelous Marvin
Hagler and even Sugar Ray Robinson for good measure after Hamed's
awesome ''coronation'' in the drizzling night air dampened and then
silenced a passionate 16,000 Welsh crowd to become king of the world's
featherweights.
Hamed will now ''chill out'' in Barbados and Jamaica and fight again
in December, perhaps in defence of his new title, or even go for another
world crown in a different division, depending on what deal Warren can
conclude.
A demoralised Robinson, defending his title for the eighth time, was
stopped after one minute 40 seconds of the eighth round when Puerto
Rican referee Ismael Fernandez stepped in with his act of mercy once the
Welshman had gone down for a second time.
Perhaps Fernandez should have taken the cocky Prince to task for his
talking and taunting throughout the action, the only unsatisfactory note
on Hamed's glory night, but the official in charge of his fifty-eighth
world title bout allowed him to go through his entire repertoire.
It was doubtful if the 26-year-old Welshman landed a dozen solid shots
during the whole of the one-sided affair. Hamed's lightning reflexes saw
to that, and only courage kept the defending champion going.
Brash and flash to the last, Hamed shimmied to the ring with the crowd
baying for his blood,. He was hit by a coin propelled from the masses,
but the young showman was about to cash in on his first world title.
Warren's problem could now be matching Hamed once news of this
high-pace, high-calibre performance gets around the world. He said:
''America has had its Sugar Ray Leonards, Marvin Haglers, and Sugar Ray
Robinsons, I think we've seen a British legend.
''It was one of the best performances I've seen from a challenger, and
fully justified the WBO's decision to put him in the No 1 challenger's
position.''
The 21-year-old Hamed, Sheffield-born of Yemeni parents, added: ''I
said what I was going to do, the crowd wasn't on my mind at all. I went
to do my business, but credit to Robinson. He took some great shots.
''It was the perfect ending, one shot to stop the fight. I'm born a
winner. Now I want to defend the title against anybody who wants it.
What happened was from God. I was destined to be world champion. I'm
blessed with a gift.''
* GLASGOW'S Dave Anderson lost his unbeaten professional record at
Basildon on Saturday night when he failed to wrest the British
lightweight title from Ealing's Michael Ayers.
The Englishman produced a rock-solid display to win his fourth British
title fight in seven months, pounding Anderson for seven rounds until
the challenger's corner sensibly pulled their man out of a one-sided
contest.
* GERMANY'S Ralf Rocchigiani successfully defended his WBO
cruiserweight title, scoring a unanimous points victory over Marc
Randazzo of the United States.

Manchester United 2, Liverpool 2
ERIC Cantona returned with a spot kick to earn Manchester United a
draw with Liverpool that left Old Trafford manager Alex Ferguson
delighted with his efforts.
The French genius, back after a 32-match ban stretching around eight
months, created Nicky Butt's 67-second opener with a pin-point left wing
cross.
While not fully match fit, Cantona was involved in all United's best
work, although they looked to be slipping to defeat when two superb
goals by Robbie Fowler -- taking his tally to eight for the season --
put Roy Evans' team ahead.
But Cantona was the right man in the right place 19 minutes from time
to steer home a penalty after Jamie Redknapp was adjudged to have hauled
back Ryan Giggs as the Welshman ran on to the Frenchman's through ball.
And Ferguson gave Cantona a hearty thumbs-up after his display. The
manager indicated just how badly the Old Trafford side have missed him
since the infamous events of Selhurst Park in January.
''I thought he did really well,'' said Ferguson. ''Obviously he tired
near the end, but that was to be expected.''
Of his part in the opening goal, Ferguson added: ''Eric is capable of
doing that at any point in the game. We got off to a great start, but we
relaxed after that and gave them the initiative.
''Liverpool had us chasing about the pitch although we thought their
second goal was a foul by Fowler on Gary Neville.''
Then the penalty for United. Ferguson's verdict almost was
predictable. ''As far as we were concerned, it was a clear penalty kick
because Ryan was pulled back, and when it came to the penalty, Eric
showed he's an expert at that particular thing.
''He just looks at the 'keeper and puts it the opposite side. After
that, we looked as if we could have won it, although it needed a
fabulous save from Peter Schmichael to keep out Redknapp's free kick in
the last minute.''
Ferguson said that the enormous interest in the build-up to the game
had not helped the match. ''All the hype is finished now, thank
goodness.
'It didn't do either team any good, but we still produced a
marvellously entertaining match. It's understandable that Eric was tired
at the end but he will get better as the games go on.''
While Ferguson was pleased with the result, the contrast with Roy
Evans could not have been greater.
The Liverpool manager was convinced his team had been deprived of two
clear penalties, the first when Fowler fell under a challenge from Steve
Bruce, and the second when Steve McManaman went to the ground under
pressure from Roy Keane.
And Evans was even more furious at the spot kick referee David Elleray
had given for Redknapp's pull on Giggs.
''I've read this week, with the referee writing it, that the spotlight
was on him and it shouldn't be,'' said Evans. ''All he has to do is make
the right decisions and he didn't do so.
''For the one in the first half, Robbie went down when he was through
on goal, and he just is not the sort of player who would dive, while, as
for the one that was given, Jamie kicked the ball -- it's as simple as
that, but it's gone against us.''
Evans added: ''I'm really sick about it. We worked really hard out
there even though we did not start too well because we were a bit
jittery.
''But after that we controlled it to the end. We didn not have any
real self-belief at the start and having no supporters made it
difficult.
''All the talk has been about Cantona -- it was as if we were not
supposed to turn up, but in the end, I think we've lost two points
because of a dodgy decision.''
Ferguson also revealed that Dennis Irwin has been forced to withdraw
from the Republic of Ireland's crucial European Championship qualifier
against Latvia in Dublin next week.
The full-back missed the Liverpool clash with a knee injury, and
Ferguson said: ''He's two or three weeks away. It's a bad blow for him
because it's a big game for Ireland.''

A SPORTING Diary survey of life in the football fast lane shows that
Rangers' dominance extends beyond the pitch to the hospitality suite. In
a busy week for football, the Diary brought its considerable
knife-and-fork and elbow-bending skills into play.
With total disregard for the danger of cholesterol overkill and the
possibility of exceeding the regulation three units of alcohol per day,
we accepted invitations to junket at both the Ibrox and Parkhead
European fixtures.
From the first sip of champagne in the Argyle suite of the Govan stand
at Ibrox to the last cup of tea at the Walfrid restaurant at Parkhead it
was sheer indulgence of a level to kindle feelings of good old-fashioned
Roman Calvinist guilt.
The Diary asked for a pint of McEwan's lager at Ibrox but the steward
said ''no''. The sponsor's product is not available pre-match. It had to
be champagne.
We struggled manfully with the bubbly stuff and, actually, you get
used to it after the first couple of pints.
The Old Firm were evenly matched with the quality of their four-course
meals. Rangers opened with coronets of smoked salmon and prawns that
were delicious, if slightly predictable. Celtic replied with an
interesting cold seafood concoction.
Both clubs fielded minestrone soup to follow -- Celtic's having the
slight edge being chunkier, the way Italian mammas make it.
There was little to separate the main courses, Rangers opting to go
foreign with a fillet steak Perigordaise while Celtic took the Scottish
route with some succulent venison.
It has to be said that the Parkhead roast potatoes were pretty
special, as you would expect of a club with links to the ould country.
Rangers really scored with their half-time pies, sandwiches, and fancy
cakes. Some of the cakes are decorated with the Gers' badge and motto
and are real collector's items. The Diary got some to take away as a
lasting memento, but ate them for elevenses next morning.
The Ibrox catering team have the edge when it comes to wine. Their
champagne was chilled to perfection whilst the Parkhead variety was a
touch warm and lacking in fizz. The Rangers wines, chardonnay and
cabernet sauvignon respectively, were more aristocratic in nature than
Celtic's workmanlike vins de table.
The staff at both venues are equally friendly and helpful, but where
Rangers score is that they have that extra hint of professionalism.
The Diary was served by a very nice waitress who didn't bat an eyelid
when she asked for our choice of liqueur and we replied: ''Anything
green.'' It's hard going that Chartreuse stuff, by the way.
We hear of a waitress who works at Ibrox but whose affections lie with
Celtic. Spotting that one of the guests in the hospitality suite was
also a Tim, she cheered him up no end by telling him that she might be
wearing the Rangers tartan but she had her green knickers on underneath.
One of the drawbacks of the Argyle suite at Ibrox is that you have to
watch the game from inside a glass box at the very top of the stand. A
bit of a change, we thought, with the animals outside the cage looking
in. (That's a terrible anti-Rangers joke and we unreservedly apologise).
At Parkhead we got to sit outside in the old stand and gaze across in
wonder at the backdrop of the amazing new Jock Stein Grandstand, as it
should be called. It was as well to have something to look at since
Celtic were so far ahead against Batumi that Yogi Hughes and his fellow
defenders spent most of the night passing the ball between themselves.
Tony Roper, resident Parkhead wit, cried out at one point: ''Come on,
ref, put some life into this game! Award a shy!''
Lest you think the Sporting Diary only goes to upmarket footballing
junkets, we should point out that our other two games of football took
us to Civil Service Strollers against Edinburgh University in the first
Scottish Cup qualifying round and to fabulous Firhill for a thrilling,
side-to-side encounter between Thistle and Falkirk.
The Strollers were knocked out of the cup by the yoonie boys but they
can be very proud of the stovies served at half-time at the civil
service sports club.
The Thistle board may have closed the door on any takeover bid from
those Asian buinessmen, but the mobile catering stand on the terracing
is selling chips with curry sauce.
Which might men there is something in the wind.

DOUGLAS Kinnaird's CV makes interesting reading. It includes two short
spells in Libya, a successful period as a photo-copier salesman and
until recently he was rated as Scotland's top headhunter before forming
his own consultancy MacDonald Kinnaird.
Among those he tracked down for top executive positions are Crawford
Beveridge as chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, and Roger Young,
chief executive of Scottish Hydro-Electric.
Mr Kinnaird described how both men were headhunted for their top
positions, and refuted the concept that it is only money that talks.
''The Scottish Enterprise job had to be advertised because it is in the
public sector, but we circulated details of it to the Scottish community
throughout the world, and the job was brought to Crawford's attention at
a cocktail party in California which Locate in Scotland was organising
for the expat Scottish community.''
In the case of Roger Young it was simply a case, said Kinnaird, of
straightforward research, and tracking down the right person for the
job. ''Filling top jobs is not about simply offering a lot of money,''
he explained. ''Very often the new jobs carry less money than the person
is already earning. Such people are turned on by the challenge of a
position.''
Strangely it was Kinnaird's success as a headhunter which eventually
led him to change directions and form a human resource development
company on his own.
PA Consultancy, impressed by his performance in Scotland, persuaded
him to take responsibility for their UK headhunting operation. ''I did
not want to go to London so it was agreed that I would only have to
spend two days a week there, but they soon wanted me to spend three days
a week in the south.''
Two years ago Kinnaird gave up his UK responsibilities, and returned
full-time to Scotland, but he believed the company was becoming more
London- orientated, and earlier this year he formed his own consultancy,
MacDonald Kinnaird, which he stresses is not a headhunting operation.
''The world is changing,'' he says. ''I believe that the recruitment
of middle to senior managers by companies will reduce dramatically.''
Instead he believes the company will concentrate on high-quality
training for their in-house managers, and Kinnaird aims to supply this
demand for senior executive training courses.
Explaining his resistance to moving to London, he explained: ''In the
early part of my career I worked in London, and not a day passed without
someone commenting on the fact that I was Scottish. It would also be
very disruptive to my children's schooling, and the quality of life is
much better here.''
Looking around, and not finding the MacDonald to fit the first part of
his consultancy's title, a smiling Kinnaird explained: ''MacDonald is my
middle name.''

Kelso 17, West of Scotland 32
KELSO remain rooted to the foot of Division Two, and their performance
at Poynder Park on Saturday gave little cause for their supporters to
hope that they will start moving up the table.
They did play well in patches, and West coach Gordon MacPherson
conceded that the scoreline was not a fair reflection of their efforts.
However, they too often wasted scoring opportunities, while, at times,
West were able to breach their defence with ridiculous ease.
A prime example was the visitors' opening try in seven minutes after
Graeme Aitchison's penalty had given Kelso the lead. An attempted
clearing kick was charged down by John Shaw, and from the five-metre
scrummage Fraser Stott found John Lonergan on his inside for the No.8 to
score comfortably.
Alan Williamson converted with his left foot from right out, off a
post, but Kelso might have responded five minutes later following a
storming run by Adam Roxburgh into the West twenty-two. But when he went
to ground, the ball re-emerged on the West's side, enabling Stott to
send a clearance back to halfway.
Aitchison, who finished with a goal-kicking record of four successes
from eight attempts, narrowed the gap with a penalty.
Then Kelso showed what they could do when they kept the ball in hand.
From lineout possession, Richard Laing looped Gordon Laing in midfield
and linked with Roxburgh, probably Kelso's best player. The flanker
supplied the path for left winger Gary Robertson to squeeze in at the
corner in 28 minutes.
West, though, had the upper hand from then on. Five minutes before
half-time, Shaw ran in unopposed behind a post after a move sparked by
Dave Barrett half charging down Keith Utterson's kick.
The West stand-off converted and added a penalty before half-time,
then crossed for a try himself in 42 minutes from ruck ball inside the
Kelso twenty-two. Aitchison landed two more penalties, the second from
the halfway line, but West finished strongly in the last five minutes,
with a penalty by Barrett who converted Lonergan's easy push-over try
right at the end.
''We're still making too many mistakes and giving away too many
penalties,'' said MacPherson. ''But we're a young side and there are
signs that things are coming together. Our next two games are at home
against Dundee and Selkirk, and if we win those we'll have a clearer
picture of our promotion chances.''
Kelso -- G Aitchison; S Ross, G Laing, R Laing, G Robertson; K

Stirling County 38, Heriot's FP 6
STIRLING County will have learned at least two things from this
attractive demolition of Heriot's. The first is that in a world of
''support'' for jumpers in lineouts, the inclusion of a rumbustious Jim
Brough as front jumper affected their pack effort positively in the
injured Stewart Hamilton's absence.
The second is that the macho attempt by Murray Fraser to show the
crowd and Tony Glasgow his pleasure at being tackled roughly just won't
work. It was the weakest little play at a head-butt in the history of
mankind -- it wasn't one really -- but, my god, was it crass. Such a
shame for such an exiting player and a real prospect to look so daft.
Stirling County are the only team in the leagues to use rolling mauls
and they did it so successfully against the hapless souls of Heriot's
that time and again the magnificent Gareth Flockhart, or Brough and
Malcolm Norval, or a hyped-up Kevin McKenzie, were left galloping into
space well in front of the gain line. The sooner someone develops the
intrusion of centres to carry on these frontal attacks the better.
It was attractive stuff, and with Ian Jardine and Fraser in playful
mood before Fraser's sending off, Mark McKenzie back in form, and Craig
Sangster suggesting that only he can blow a future cap, County, despite
what must have been tired legs following their Barbarians game on
Tuesday, were all over Heriot's in the good, old-fashioned sense of the
word.
All of Heriot's points came from Teri Rahui and they were delivered in
the first 40 minutes. Set against that were some superb passages of
handling play from County -- they genuinely looked set on an attractive
but effective game-plan -- that spawned two glorious first-half tries.
Gus Turner finished off a move that involved the back in form --
Jardine -- Kenny Harper, Colin McRobert, Flockhart, and Fraser. Their
second, when McRobert went over, was equally adventurous.
In the second half, McKenzie added two more kicks and Sangster
underlined his promise with a try down the blind-side. All of which
added up to a very pleasing day's work for County who look as though
they will blow a few sides off the pitch on this form.
Perhaps they let Craig Humphries take too much ball at the front for
Heriot's, but, despite Kenny Milne's quite obvious displeasure at being
pressurised by Stirling's eight without too much support from his own,
the men from Goldenacre were never really in it, and when his bruised
knee has been fixed Stirling can still bring back the Herald's man, too.
Stirling County -- C Sangster; A Turner, I Jardine, M Fraser, C
McRobert; M McKenzie, K Harper; J Manson, K McKenzie, B Robertson, J
Brough, M Norval, D Elliot, G Flockhart, B Ireland.
Heriots -- D Officer; H Gilmour, A Glasgow, G Lawrie, C Aitken; T
Rahui, F McMillan; J Bryce, K Milne, S Paul, C Humphries, P Young, I
Shand, T McVie, G Dall.
Referee -- D Girdwood (Stewart's Melville).

THE top of Division Three imploded as Biggar lost their unbeaten
record at Glasgow Accies while Kirkcaldy returned to winning ways.
The result is -- all three now share the top spot. Accies scored a
17-9 success at Anniesland over Biggar, who were on the backfoot
throughout, despite leading momentarily at the start of the second half.
Determined visitors' tackling, plus the nasty weather, made Accies'
task difficult. Calum MacGregor passed up five first-half penalty
attempts out of seven, and with Dennis Lavery having two successes, the
teams turned level.
Biggar took the lead in 44 minutes with Lavery's third penalty, but
from there it was all Accies, with a magnificent try sandwiched by two
further MacGregor penalties. A kick to the right wing by stand-off
MacGregor was taken at full pace by Torquil Mathewson, who found John
Mason arriving outside him to carry on for the touchdown.
Not for the first time, John Mitchell earned the bulk of Kirkcaldy's
points, as they won at home, 21-10, over Peebles.
The teams were level at the turn. Mitchell and Andre Bell, having
exchanged penalty, added conversions to tries from, respectively, Andy
Imrie and Bob Fletcher.
Early in the second half, Mitchell appeared outside his wing for a
try. Though he missed the conversion, he put over a brace of subsequent
penalties.
By converting his own try and kicking a penalty, Cliff Livingstone
built up a 10-3 lead for Musselburgh at Grangemouth. But a penalty try
to the homesters let them turn all square. In the second half they went
on to their second successive win, by 17-15, thanks to a Mike Parsons
try plus a penalty and second conversion from Kenny Halliday.
Preston Lodge halted their losing streak, winning 23-12 at
Corstorphine, who remain pointless. Tries by Mark Hastie, Neil Clyde,
and Dave Allan, who converted one and kicked two penalties, put them
23-0 up before Corstorphine rallied in the final quarter.

KILMARNOCK tasted defeat for the first time and found themselves eased
off the top rung of Division Four by victors Glasgow Southern. The packs
cancelled each other out while Kilmarnock showed more endeavour behind.
But, on the day, the greasy ball too often went to ground and Southern
punished the errors.
With 30 minutes gone, the home stand-off, James Dunlop, had kicked
three penalties to build up a 9-0 lead. However, the Kilmarnock pack
worked their way to the line for a try by Michael Welsh which Robbie
Stewart converted.
In the second half Dunlop kicked three more penalties for Southern's
18-7 win.
Gordonians determination to take Aberdeen to the uppermost stratum of
the premiership resulted in a 60-16 home win over Wigtownshire. Tries
came from Duncan Pickup (3), Mark Estachy (2), Dave Crawford, Charlie
Richard, Steve Lipp, Steve Driscoll, and Andy Fleming, with Bruce Doney
kicking five conversions.
Wigtownshire remain pointless but the determination that was evident
as they closed the scoring on Saturday, with a try from Neil Scott,
prevents smart money being placed on them as relegation candidates. But
can the same be said of Edinburgh Wanderers?
Visitors Ayr dominated the proceedings to win 50-15 with the pack
putting a stranglehold on the second-half and setting up excellent tries
for David McVey and Doug Smith.
The other tries came from Geoff Caldwell (2), Ewen Logan, and Jim
Limburn. Craig Foster kicked four conversions and three penalties and
Andy Hay dropped a goal while all Wanderers' points came from the boot
of John Cropper.
Haddington's winning run came to an end when hard-tackling visitors
Langholm won 20-12 to break their own losing sequence. Alan Hotson
scored at a first-half pushover with Gary Brannan converting and kicking
a penalty for a 10-6 interval lead. Poor home defence let Brannan score
Langholm's second try which he converted besides kicking a second
penalty.

Boroughmuir 21, Watsonians 21
IF ever the new premiership needed a shot in the arm then this was it.
The Colinton near-neighbours served up a delicious feast of rugby based
on widely contrasting styles and the 3000-plus Meggetland crowd were
treated to a dish fair reekin' with high endeavour and just enough class
to keep the purists happy as well.
It was the Myreside Cavaliers versus the Meggetland Roundheads,
Watsonians' haute cuisine versus good old mince and tatties from
Boroughmuir. The 'Muir pack was outstanding. They cleaned in the lineout
and some of their driving play was out of the top drawer.
Watsonians, despite the fact that their pack had to accept a poor
second-best, were always adventurous to almost suicidal degree and Jamie
Weston's second-half try was proof positive that, when outrageous
adventurism comes off, it does so to spectacular effect.
The try was conceived behind Watsonians' goal-line with a pass from
Fergus Henderson to Gavin Hastings. Never mind that it had 'Ward 10'
written all over it. The Cavalier-in-chief spurned the safety-first
option of a kick to touch and sent brother Scott bounding up the park.
Hastings Jr shipped the ball to Weston and only Duncan MacRae stood
between the scrum half and the Boroughmuir line. Inexplicably, MacRae
contrived to stumble and fall and Weston was given a free run in for the
touchdown.
For Boroughmuir, meanwhile, Stuart Reid represented a magnificent
presence. The big No.8, profiting from the fact that the Meggetland pack
were in rampant form, was into everything, and then some. From a
Boroughnuir viewpoint, the pity was that on this occasion the forward
play was not matched by the threequarters.
Despite the fact that this was, without question, the most
entertaining match of this premiership season, both coaches, post-match,
underlined the fact that the men at the sharp-end invariably do not see
the same game as uncommitted neutrals.
Boroughmuir coach Henry Edwards considered that championship points
shared represented a point lost. ''We knew that they would be lurking
around the fringes and our game-plan was to keep driving down the middle
to suck them in. I can't fault the commitment of our boys but there were
an awful lot of silly passes going on after we had done the initial
spadework,'' he said.
Peter Gallagher, meanwhile, chided his side not so much for standing
off rucks and mauls but for doing so to no good effect. ''We stood off
and let them come at us but then we let them come at us again by which
time they were over the gain-line.''
He was, though, happy with the spirit of adventure with which Hastings
G embues his side. ''That try from behind our own line is the way that
we want to play the game. We're always looking to win but allied to that
is the fact that we want to play a 15-man game.''
Watsonians went into a six-point lead through two penalty goals by
Duncan Hodge. After 22 minutes -- for most of which time Boroughmuir had
been on the back foot -- Hodge's flat-mate and opposite number Bryan
Easson went over for a try after spadework by Lineen, Reid, and Cadzow.
Some 13 minutes later Easson kicked 'Muir into the lead with a penalty
goal, but within a minute Watsonians were back in front, Hodge nipping
over for a try after a dynamic burst from the impressive Tom Smith. The
stand-off added the conversion to give Watsonians a five-point cushion.
Boroughmuir, profiting from stirring forward play, narrowed the
interval gap with another Easson penalty goal and five minutes into the
second period, with the game swinging their way, the home side went into
a slender lead with yet another penalty from Easson.
Weston's try put Watsonians back in front but, once again, Boroughmuir
roared back with a fine Lineen try which Easson converted. Watsonians
drew level when Boroughmuir were ''flagged'' for stamping and Hodge
speared the crucial penalty shot between the uprights.
By this time, as Gallagher confided later, he and fellow coach Andrew
Ker had settled for a share of the points but had not Gavin Hastings
spilled a difficult pass on the Boroughmuir line in the third minute of
injury time, then Watsonians would have stolen a game which, as the old
cliche so truthfully puts it, neither side deserved to lose.

Edinburgh Academicals 13, Hawick 30
IT had been predicted from the outset of the Tennents championship
that success in the reformatted structure would fall to the clubs with
the strongest squads. The inverse of this proposition is equally true;
namely that clubs with insufficient reserve strength will find it tough
in the top tier.
So it has proved for Edinburgh Academicals. Six key players -- Simon
Burns, Chris Simmers, Brian Hay-Smith in the backs and Malcolm McVie,
Jeremy Richardson, and Paddy Haslett in the forwards -- are currently on
Academicals' injury list. Replacing a sextet of this calibre -- quite
apart from the sheer organisational exercise of fitting in so many
newcomers -- would stretch the resources of most first division sides.
To some extent this explains the below-par performance of the Raeburn
Place side against Hawick on Saturday.
Not that Hawick were undeserving winners; it was, however, true that
Academicals' rawness in a number of positions made it easier for the
Greens to play to their real potential. Which they most certainly did
with some delightful handling in the backs, speedy delivery of
second-phase ball by a rejuventated pack in which 18-year-old Andrew
Barnes made an impressive debut, and a fine individual performance by
stand-off Scott Welsh.
The 27-year-old Welsh looks to be in even better form than that which
won him selection for the Scottish Select side against South Africa at
Rubislaw last November. On Saturday, his astute reading of the game and
decision-making in shifting the direction of attack brought tries for
David Grant and Tony Stanger. And significantly, the stand-off had a
major hand in two of the other Hawick scores, by Cameron Murray and Jim
Hay, not just in the sense of moving the ball but in making an
instantaneous summation of the offensive options.
Hawick's other try came from the interception of Ken Baillie's pass to
Richard Porter by Keith Suddon, the Greens' left wing thereafter having
the easiest of canters to score under the posts. Yet for all that Hawick
bagged five tries, Billy Murray, their coach, although pleased, was not
totally satisfied with his side's performance. ''We could have scored at
least three more if we had moved the ball wide,'' observed Murray. ''But
I'm pleased that we got it right in terms of ball winning and ball
retention.''
With Hawick's talented backline beginning to fire on all cylinders,
supporters of the Green movement should witness further try scoring
against Gala at Mansfield Park on Saturday.
Meanwhile, for Academicals, life over the next few days will be about
medical bulletins as their numerous wounded strive to regain full
fitness.
Edinburgh Academicals -- K Baillie; R Porter, C Murray, M Finlayson, G
McKinley; M Duncan, K Troup; J Fayers, D Wilson, B Stewart, A Adamson, S
Murray, D McIvor, M Waite, C Allan. Replacement -- R Houle for Waite
(38min).
Hawick -- G Oliver; D Grant, A Stanger, C Murray, K Suddon; S Welsh, K
Reid; B McDonnell, J Hay, A Johnston, I Elliot, A Imray, D Turnbull, B
Renwick, J Graham. Replacements -- C Turnbull for Oliver (2min), B
Lothian for A Johnston (14).
Referee -- J Bacigalupo (Edinburgh Wanderers).
SCORERS: Edinburgh Academicals -- Penalty try; Duncan 2p, 1c. Hawick
-- Murray 1t; Grant 1t; Suddon 1t; Stanger 1t; Hay 1t; Welsh 1p, 1c.
* ALL Black selectors have named four new caps and left out seven of
their World Cup squad for their forthcoming tour to Italy and France.
New boys Justin Marshall and Ofisa Tonu'u were included at scrum-half,
while Taine Randell and Todd Blackadder were named in the forwards. The
seven missing are Marc Ellis, Ant Strachan, Graeme Bachop, Paul
Henderson, Kevin Schuler, Mike Brewer, and Jamie Joseph.
There were recalls for North Harbour loose forward Liam Barry and
Auckland's experienced Michael Jones.

SCOTLAND'S win and a draw in their double-headed international
shinty/hurling clash with Ireland was their best-ever performance
against the Irish. The Scottish senior team has now gone three
successive matches undefeated, and the eventual 5-4 outcome at
rain-lashed Fort William on Saturday flattered the Irish.
The Scots were two up in 12 minutes, Victor Smith scoring in just 51
seconds. Ronald Ross, the outstanding Scottish forward, then grabbed the
first of an eventual hat-trick.
The Irish hauled themselves back, John Troy forcing goalkeeper Graeme
MacMillan into his only error of the day. MacMillan's breathtaking form
kept the Scots in the game at a crucial stage, but it was significant
that the man of the match award international went to Irish 'keeper
David Fitzgerald, who withstood a tremendous barrage of shots late on.
Ronald Ross had another strike disallowed in the 31st minute before
Brian Corcoran eventually broke free from his markers to bring the Irish
back to 2-2 with a spectacular volley.
The Scots replied within four minutes when Ross latched on to a long
through ball, and four minutes later he made it 4-2 with a stunning
finish. Two minutes later Corcoran pounced again to earn the Irish a
fighting chance.
However, the Scots, with the wind at their backs, kept an iron grip,
and Ali Borthwick got a just reward for some probing runs with the fifth
goal in 51 minutes.
Troy netted the Irish fourth with just five minutes to go. It was a
stunning victory for Scotland, and Gaelic Athletic Association
Vice-president Albert Fallon said at the post-match dinner that they
were now ''ahead of the Irish in many respects.''
That situation is one the Irish, who have numerical odds of 100-1 in
player number terms, will want to address, particularly as their
under-21 squad failed to beat a bold Scottish side.
The match ended 4-4, Newtonmore's Stuart Ferrier grabbing a last-ditch
equaliser. Kevin Hunter of Scotland won the man of the match award with
an outstanding goalkeeping display.

CLYDESDALE and Pender Uddingston must be wondering if winning
promotion last season was in their interest, as yesterday's matches in
the National League saw them concede 17 goals at McDiarmid Park, Perth.
Clydesdale, despite creating the greater number of scoring chances
against Torbrex Wanderers, trailed 0-4 at half-time before crashing to a
10-1 defeat. Gordon Shepherd was the main tormentor, scoring five.
John Christie sank Uddingston, hitting four Menzieshill goals in a 7-0
victory. In their three games to date, the Lanarkshire men have now
conceded 24 goals and have yet to score.
Kelburne and Western produced one of the best matches before the
Paisley team emerged victorious by the odd goal in five. Dougie Wylie
hit the winner in 52 minutes.
There are, however, new league leaders. Grange, in beating MIM 4-0, go
two points clear of Touche Ross Gordonians, surprisingly beaten 2-1 by
Insights Inverleith. Gary Ward hit the winner. Results:
Saturday: National League Div Two -- Watsonians 5, Edinburgh
University 1; Stirling 2, Harris 1; Perthshire 3, Comware Carnegie 2;

BRUCE Mactaggart showed that big money does not necessarily buy
success when his 10-year-old gelding, Side of Hill, beat Sue Bramall's
fancied Spanish Fair in a head-to-head tussle at Kelso.
The 14-1 shot of four, a cast-off from Martin Pipe's yard, cost Hawick
businessman Johnny Rudkin 800 guineas in February, while Spanish Fair,
8-11, at one time with the late Arthur Stephenson, was bought two years
by his Yorkshire owners for 72,000 guineas.
As they battled up the steep incline in the final stages of the #4000
Famous Grouse Chase, three pounds claimer Graham Lee produced a great
rally from his mount to edge ahead in the last 50 yards.
Spanish Fair, attempting to make every yard of the extended three
miles, didn't jump well and hung right on the run-in. Bramall explained
that the seven-year-old had ''put his back out'' but no excuse, however
valid, could take credit away from the winner, who was given a
tremendous reception from his Hawick following in the big crowd.
Side of Hill won four times over fences for Pipe, but since crossing
the Border has not enjoyed the best of luck, twice being involved in
void races at Kelso. He showed his best form in May when third to Pink
Gin, also at Kelso and was second to Greenhill Raffles at Aintree when
he fell at the last but was remounted.
Mactaggart, whose only winner last season was novice hurdler Well
Appointed, said the horse had been bought as ''a hack'' but it was
decided to give him one more year's racing.
Rusty Blade, who finished third, could make no impression on the
leaders despite the efforts of Gary Cahill, given a four-day suspension,
from October 11-13, for using his whip with undue force and frequency.
Lucinda Russell, who achieved international recognition riding
eventers, looks as if she is about to make a name for herself as a
trainer. Vavasir, 5-1 winner of the Highland Park Chase, was her second
success from three runners in her first season at Milnathort, Kinross.
Fiveleigh Builds won for her at Perth last month and on Saturday,
Vavasir, with Peter Niven aboard, jumped well to beat Peter Monteith's
well-back 4-5 favourite Killimor Lad by eight lengths.
He won from the front, much to the surprise of his trainer, who had
warned the jockey he might be ''a bit doggy'' but nevertheless had a
small bet.
It was a ruinous day for favourite backers, with the first five all
going down. A ''get-out' opportunity did come in the last -- an amateur
riders' hurdle -- when Hit The Canvas, 10-11, got home by half a length
from long-time leader Master Bavard.
Four bets of #1000 and two of #1100 were recorded.

ALTHOUGH Melbourne Cup favourite Double Trigger goes into quarantine
today, doubts remain about his participation in the Australian race
following a dismal performance in yesterday's Prix du Cadran.
Trainer Mark Johnston was awaiting the return of his Ascot Gold Cup
winner this morning and still plans to isolate the colt until a final
decision is made over whether or not to send him Down Under.
That decision will be made soon according to Johnston, who said: ''We
have to get flights booked so we will have to move pretty quickly.''
After yesterday's race Johnston was critical of jockey Jason Weaver,
whom he felt should have made more use of the colt by quickening up the
tempo earlier.

BORUSSIA Dortmund, who drew with Rangers at Ibrox in a Champions'

Dortmund won 3-1, and there was further misery for Bayern, who meet
Raith Rovers in the next round of the UEFA Cup, when they lost top

Stefan Reuter opened the scoring from the penalty spot, then Christian

Dortmund the lead again in 79 minutes, and Michael Zorc completed the
scoring when he gave Bayern keeper Oliver Kahn no chance from 18 yards.

LAMMTARRA became one of racing's greats when running on in grand
fashion to take the Forte Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp, Paris,
yesterday.
He earned a place in the sport's hall of fame by completing a
brilliant big race treble, achieved only once before.
Until yesterday no horse had matched Mill Reef's feat of winning the
Derby, King George, and Arc in a season. But unbeaten Lammtarra, with
the Breeders' Cup Turf his next likely target, has the world at his feet
after having carried Frankie Dettori to an emotional triumph in front of
a crowd of 30,000 in the French capital.
Britain's champion jockey was in tears as he realised the moment he
had claimed his first ''Arc'' and yet another amazing success for the
Godolphin team from Dubai. ''This horse is a lion,'' he said. ''I don't
know the words to describe him. He's so tough, he doesn't want to lose,
just win.
''I'm so excited, I just can't believe it. I so much wanted to win and
he must be the best horse we've seen for years. If they find one better
I'd sure like to ride it.''
In a race that has produced its share of hard-luck stories, Dettori
had a dream run round, settled in second behind Luso, enlisted by the
Maktoum team to ensure a good pace.
Luso could only carry him to the final straight, but when Lammtarra
went to the front he fought off every challenge to finish three quarters
of a length clear of Freedom Cry, with Swain two lengths third, Lando
fourth, and Pure Grain fifth.
The thousands of British race fans were ecstatic as Dettori delighted
them with a flying vault out of the saddle into the winner's enclosure
and the arms of Godolphin's mastermind, Sheikh Mohammed.
''This is a great feeling, as good as Derby day. We wanted a true-run
mile and a half race and got it,'' said the Sheikh.
''I've never seen a horse like him. I knew he must be good after he
came through sickness during the winter. He had a very serious lung
infection and was almost dead. This horse just does not give up.''
Lammtarra, unbeaten now in all four starts, is expected to fly to New
York for the Breeders' Cup before going to stand, either at Dalham Hall
or Gainsborough Studs in England.
Racing manager Simon Crisford said: ''I think he will go and try his
luck in the States. We were very confident here without being arrogant.
The whole race unfolded as we hoped it would.
''He was improved since Ascot. When Lammtarra won the Derby he was
very immature, like a schoolboy, now he is the ultimate racing
machine.''
Of the other British runners, Balanchine finished tenth on almost
certainly her last appearance, Luso thirteenth, and Strategic Choice one
place further back. Last year's winner, Carnegie, was sixth.
Walter Swinburn, who lost the ride on Lammtarra after having won the
Derby, said Balanchine never fired but saluted his former partner.
''I was always fighting a losing battle on Balanchine,'' he said.
''All my emotions about Lammtarra went away back in July. Now I am
thrilled for the horse.
''I had reservations about the ground but he has come into this race
with a better preparation than he had for the Derby and King George.''
Lammtarra completed a remarkable day for the cross-Channel raiders,
who were earlier celebrating the eighth triumph this year by the
ever-improving Hever Golf Rose in the Prix de l'Abbaye.
She, too, could make the trip to the USA at the end of the month after
having set a post-war record of wins in a season for a British-trained
filly or mare aged four or more.

Dundee HS FP 16, GHK 10
SPARE a thought for GHK. They are having the kind of luck this season
which shouldn't happen to a dog.
Coach Mike Hunter almost ran out of fingers as he counted out the
number of first-choice players out through injury.
Add to that the four performers in this makeshift side who had to
retire through injuries of varying kinds and severity and you realise
the Glasgow side's predicament.
That they managed to hold on to a lead until the last 10 minutes of
the match against a Dundee High School FP team eager for victory was
testament to their tenacity.
Eventually, though, the barrier they put up was going to be breached
as the hosts turned pressure into points.
The visitors were forced by circumstances to invite the evergreen
Walter Malcolm out of semi-retirement to fill a gap in the second row.
Even his skill and enthusiasm was never going to be a threat in the
lineout to Scotland internationalist Stewart Campbell, assisted by
Gregor Hayter.
Once again the importance of lineout possession was clear, although
the Dundee forwards have a lot of work to do in ball retention as they
were turned over time and again by the collective attentions of Andy
Ness and Ian Sinclair.
The loss of Cammy Little to hamstring damage will be a bitter blow for
GHK in the coming weeks as he looked in sparkling form and was at the
heart of all the good moves made by the visitors.
Derek Busby, too, will be greatly missed after having suffered
concussion when punched by an opposing forward. Surprise was expressed
at referee Chuck Muir's decision merely to warn the offender.
Kiwi Chris Robinson, emerging as a real find for Dundee, opened the
scoring with a penalty goal before Graham Agnew finished off Steve
Hirini's dent and Cammy Little's blind-side break with a try.
A second Robinson penalty goal restored home advantage before the
dream team of Little and Agnew combined again for the latter's second
touchdown.
Relentless pressure paid off as Mike Cousin finished off a
breathtaking passage of play, in which Paul Rouse shone, with a try.
The nail in the coffin came when Tony McWhirter crashed over for a try
from a lineout and forward drive.
Dundee HS FP -- S Newton; M A Cousin, P R Rouse, D R Hamilton, J R
Jardine; C Robinson, G Sandford; S J Lithgow, G Scott, N Robertson, R J

Currie 33, Stewart's Melville 9
WHO needs backs to score tries when we're around. That was the cry
from the forwards' club at Malleny Park when red hot Currie notched
victory No.5 with the forwards scoring all four touchdowns.
An unusual occurence yes, but Currie are an unusual club. I would not
put any money against them getting where they want to be . . . and that
is among the upper echelons in Tennents Premiership leagues.
It's early days in the race to win the second-division title but
Currie are growing in confidence with every match. No-one is predicting
an unbeaten league season, they might be toppled by Jed at Riverside on
Saturday, but it wouldn't undermine their self-belief.
And it was this air of assurance that took care of Stewart's Melville.
The visitors did not lack spirit either but it was from a limited few,
and, in general, they lacked the skills to go with it.
Currie are enjoying the Kiwi influence. Big Chad Eagle is immence in
the pack and the others respond to his efforts. Full back-cum-centre (he
switched positions repeatedly) Dean Sheppard is class in motion. Fly
half Ally Donaldson, so often decried for overkicking, has tempered his
thumping of the ball and he is laying off the ball with great dexterity.
The Malleny Park side set the standards by running out of defence from
the visitors' kick-off. Winger Geoff Keen was just crowded out from
making a sensational opening, but it was Stew-Mel who opened the
scoring, Graham Stirling slotting a sixth-minute penalty.
Currie effervescence wouldn't be denied, although it took two
Donaldson penalties to get them on the scoreboard. The first of the
Forwards' Scoring Club struck in 25 minutes when Ian Russell plunged
over after Mark Blair had been held up. Donaldson converted but Stirling
then had another penalty for the visitors.
Minutes from the interval the Eagle swooped for a try after Hunter was
held up. Just on half-time Stirling hit his third penalty but Currie
were untroubled.
A minute into the second half Donaldson hit a penalty from the
touchline. Then flanker Steve Logan got try No.3 when he picked up a
loose pass.
The match finished with a classic try started by the brilliant
Sheppard. Donaldson and Hunter combined to put Graham Ellis over,
Donaldson converting.
Currie -- D Sheppard; C Robertson, D Wilson, M Tonkin, G Keen; A
Donaldson, R Hunter; D Massey, G Ellis, C Boyd, M Blair, C Eagle, B
Ward, I Russell, S Logan.
Stewart's Melville -- N Gallagher; N Penny, A Huett, F Pollock, G
Stirling; D Wyllie, G Burns; J Blackhall, B Thomas, J Conlin, B Gordon,
W Faulds, K Dobson, D Clark, K Hamilton. Replacement -- M Paton for
Hamilton (38min).
Referee -- C Henderson (Kelso).
SCORERS: Currie: Russell, 1t; Eagle, 1t; Logan, 1t; Ellis, 1t;
Donaldson, 3p, 2c. Stewart's Melville -- Stirling, 3p.

KENNY Dalglish went back to his roots yesterday at Possil YM in
Glasgow and took the opportunity to give Scotland's manager Craig Brown
a boost which he will relish as the national side head towards the
European Championship finals.
Dalglish, who stepped up from being Blackburn manager into a
consultancy role, said: ''Craig Brown has done a good job for Scotland.
You can't doubt his success and it will be good to see us in England
next year. I just hope Greece don't put us under pressure by beating
Russia.''
Along with a host of other former players of the youth club, Dalglish
helped launch the newly refurbished club hall.
The former Celtic and Liverpool striker said that he had enjoyed what
he has seen of Scottish football this season but would not comment on
transfer speculation involving Blackburn and and Jackie McNamara of
Dunfermline or John Collins of Celtic.

UNSETTLED Celtic defender Tony Mowbray is set to leave Parkhead before
the end of the week. Frozen out of the first-team picture after the
arrival of John Hughes from Falkirk, the former England B international
looks certain to be moving back down south.
Several English clubs, including Sunderland and Bolton have made
enquiries about the player, but Ipswich and Leicester have emerged as
favourites to capture the services of the 31-year-old.

CELTIC manager Tommy Burns and Partick Thistle's Murdo MacLeod will
take charge of Scotland's B squad against Sweden later this month.
Scotland manager Craig Brown revealed the appointments ahead of the B
and full international friendlies in Sweden on October 10 and 11.
Brown will name his squads for both games tomorrow with a number of
players seeking to press their claims for Euro '96.
Coventry midfielder Paul Telfer will be in the B squad and likely to
join him are Aberdeen new man Paul Bernard and Chelsea pair John Spencer
and Craig Burley.
Motherwell duo Brian Martin and Rob McKinnon also are likely to be
involved with the B game. Under an agreement between the two countries,
the sides will field a maximum two players with more than six senior
caps.
Brown will not be calling up many of Scotland's successful Under-21
side, who look bound for the European Championship quarter-finals.
''They still have one game to play against San Marino in November and
then, hopefully, there will be home and away ties as well,'' said the
Scotland manager. ''That is enough for these lads to be going on with at
this stage.''
That means 19-year-old Rangers' Charlie Miller will have to wait for
the international step-up many observers have predicted.
There seems little chance that Miller's Ibrox team-mate, in-form
Richard Gough, will be recalled after a two-year absence. Although Gough
says he would attend if selected, Brown is not prepared to alter his
stance on the Rangers skipper, who criticised him and predecessor Andy
Roxburgh in his autobiography.
Brown is hoping to line up A and B games against European champions
Denmark next April.

Everton 1, Newcastle 3
NEWCASTLE manager Kevin Keegan sent a message to the rest of the
Premiership yesterday after his side chalked up a 3-1 win against
Everton at Goodison Park.
The victory secured Newcastle's status as top-flight leaders and
Keegan said: ''We look like a team who can win something this season.''
The goals came from Les Ferdinand -- his 100th in English football --
Robert Lee from the penalty spot and substitute Paul Kitson, with Anders
Limpar replying for outclassed Everton.
And reaching a personal milestone boosted Ferdinand's claims for an
international recall.
The 28-year-old striker's goal sparked an emphatic victory for
Newcastle as they confirmed their status as Premiership leaders.
England coach Terry Venables names the squad today to face Norway in
Oslo next week.
Blackburn's Alan Shearer and Teddy Sheringham of Spurs are Venables'
current favourites -- but Ferdinand is a man bang in form.
Meanwhile, Joe Royle's men may be advancing in Europe in the Cup
Winners' Cup, but are slipping fast in the Premiership and this was
their fourth successive league defeat.
Yet they could have had a comfortable lead before Ferdinand fired
Newcastle ahead. Tony Grant floated in a delicate chip that beat keeper
Shaka Hislop but came back off the crossbar.
Hislop then blocked a fierce effort from Paul Rideout before watching
in relief as Dave Watson powered a free header over the top. However,
when Ferdinand struck after 11 minutes that was the end of Everton's
challenge.
Ferdinand, whose formative years were spent in non-League football,
skipped away from Watson and cut inside Dave Unsworth before firing an
unstoppable shot past Neville Southall.
He could have had a second after a superb one-two with Frenchman David
Ginola, only to lose his footing after going round Southall.
Southall then made a marvellous point-blank save from Ferdinand after
Scott Sellers and Lee had linked up to carve open the Everton's defence.
Newcastle's football was at times irresistible and they got a second
goal after 59 minutes.
Ginola forced his way into a scoring position only to be impeded first
by Earl Barrett and then Unsworth. Lee made no mistake from the penalty
spot.
Kitson replaced Ginola, who had been doubtful before the game because
of injury, in the 64th minute. And a minute later he scored Newcastle's
third with only his second touch, getting on the end of a cross from
Barton to head home.
Substitute Anders Limpar scored a consolation goal for Everton with
nine minutes to go, with Newcastle's players claiming he was offside.
A jubilant Keegan picked out Ferdinand and Lee as being the key
players in the club's seventh win in eight league outings.
He said: ''That was as good a performance as I have seen from a centre
forward. He led the line superbly and put himself about in the best
possible way.
''Everton manager Joe Royle talks about his dogs of war. I have one of
my own in Lee. He edged out John Ebbrell and Joe Parkinson in tackles
and then his skill took him through.''
Royle said: ''I am very disappointed. We have got to get back to that
relegation spirit of last year, which took us away from trouble.''
* LIKE Ferdinand, Paul Ince will hope to hear today that his England
banishment was only temporary.
But Matthew Le Tissier will not be holding his breath when Terry
Venables interrupts his libel defence to name his squad for the friendly
against Norway.
His biggest problem is at left-back where former captain Stuart Pearce
is set to return for his 60th cap, with Graeme Le Saux ruled out and
third choice Tony Dorigo struggling to make the trip to Oslo. Injury
also rules out Peter Beardsley, captain David Platt and Darren Anderton.
That gives the England coach a window of opportunity to welcome back
Ince in his most significant squad announcement yet.
No-one is under more pressure than Inter Milan recruit Ince, who
ducked the Umbro tournament to go on holiday and was duly left out last
time.
Many, however, would like to see room made for Aston Villa's Mark
Draper, who has made an impressive start to the season since his
#3.25million move from Leicester.

NEWSVIEW: a community with pride born out of despair
Jennifer Cunningham visits a housing association which is restoring
community confidence as well as homes, and hoping to build a brighter
future from an impoverished past
THE domes and spires of the skyline are among the heartlifting glories
of life in Edinburgh. To have your horizons bounded by the roof lines of
endless concrete blocks in that city of architectural wonders is
therefore a wrongful imprisonment of the spirit.
Every student teacher, architect, planner, social worker and, above
all, smart-Alec politician should be taken to Clovenstone Primary School
in Wester Hailes. It is a low, large-windowed building, designed no
doubt to stimulate the expansion of young minds in conditions of space
and light. Those generous windows look out on endless, dismal walls of
four-storey blocks. There is an asphalt playground, and on the other
side of the fence a temptingly green, grassy mound. It looks
exhilarating to roll down, but is far too steep for any sort of game,
and anyway is covered in dog excrement. This is the green hill without a
city wall which added rustic bonus to sixties' plans to cover farmland
in concrete.
We all ken noo they got it wrong, but five-year-olds are still
skipping in there for their first taste of the world beyond home and
trooping out at 11 having made their mark by adding their rage or their
name to the obscenities on the walls.
In desperate circumstances people band together to generate power and
purpose. Among the many community organisations in Wester Hailes doing
that, the tenants' association campaigned for a new housing strategy.
The Wester Hailes Community Housing Association was formed in 1990, and
immediately bought three high-rise blocks which the district council
could not afford to refurbish. They demolished them and built, by
popular request, low-rise flats and two-storey houses with their own
front and back door at Walkers Rigg, named after the farmer who once
turned it beneath his plough.
To social historians and design-conscious architects, it embodies the
horror of the Wimpey-Barratt facing-brick school of community
architecture. To its tenants it is heaven. The doors close with a
reassuring clunk. The windows are double-glazed units with detachable
handles so that if someone does break the glass, they cannot open the
window and small children cannot open upstairs windows and fall out. You
can feel warm, not just impoverished, from your fuel costs.
Westburn village, the association's #11.77m second development, is a
startlingly confident stride forward from that. They had earmarked a
disused stone quarry as a site for new-build housing, despite site
problems including the need to move overhead cables to the other side of
the by-pass. Scottish Homes, the main funder, stipulated a two and
three-storey development. There was a recognition, too, that this would
be a distinctive, cohesive community. The result is a confident mix of
one to five-bedroom houses and flats.
It has the friendly feel of the apparent jumble of an old village, but
given structure by bold round stair towers familiar from most Scottish
towns. These, however, have very untraditional glass blocks through
which the stair lights shine at night as landmark beacons.
The fishing village style was partly the result of adopting the
traditional response to the inhospitable climate of the exposed site,
said Alistair Scott, director of Smith, Scott, Mullan &amp; Associates,
project architects. After visits to a number of towns and villages such
as South Queensferry, there was enthusiasm for gables, the tradition of
different roof heights, and even for the odd blank wall. Scott believes
that many community housing associations now have an interest in
architecture and building which takes them beyond the personal. ''The
initial debate about washing poles and front gates has given way to a
debate about energy and the micro-climate,'' he said.
As a result, there is increasing respect on both sides for each
other's agenda. An instance is the colour of the houses which vary from
white and brown to a rainbow of blue, pink and yellow. There was, says
Scott diplomatically, ''a debate''. Initial reactions of distaste were
tempered and eventually emboldened by the realisation that other places
had been doing this for years. The final palette was determined from a
postcard of Tobermory.
Client-architect negotiations gave way to humour. A maverick cat which
had crept into one of the drawings and became a means of identifying it
was cast in concrete and set in one of the walls. In a place which has
evolved through the centuries, it would be a quirky little feature of
which local worthies would recount the tale. In the shadow of the
monolithic blocks it is a talisman of the human scale -- and of the
promise of human partnership.
''Architects can only build the buildings, the people have to build
the community,'' adds Alistair Scott. This community may have been
conceived in communal despair, but it starts life with a communal pride.
Carpet-fitters' vans are buzzing round the narrow streets as the 220 new
tenants and 10 co-owners get their houses shipshape for the grand
opening tomorrow complete with children's street games and songs.
The needs of children have influenced the design of the street layout.
There are short cul-de-sacs off the main road with front-of-house car
parking which also give safe space for roller-skating and trike-riding
as well as small enclosed play areas overlooked by houses.
As soon as the burly figure of John McInally, the association's clerk
of works, is spotted, he is inundated with requests to sort out minor
problems, like Joan Hickson's sticking front door. He is as proud of the
village as the residents. ''You can see it from the by-pass and during
construction, people would drive up and ask how much the houses were
going to cost. They just assumed they were for sale,'' he recounts with
glee. ''One of the interesting things about this quality of development
is that suddenly every minor imperfection is reported. Everyone wants
everything to be perfect,'' he said.
As an encouragement to keep it that way, the association employs two
local people in Westburn to wash communal stairs every day and do
environmental maintenance, including keeping the litter under control.
That service is built into the rent levels which vary from #33 for a
one-bedroom flat to #59.50 for a five-bedroom house.
A second phase is planned which will include more shared-ownership
houses and some for outright sale as well as for rent. Yet this is
housing for social need and 75% of the tenants in Wester Hailes receive
full or partial housing benefit. That opens the wider question of what
this is all about. It is one of the four urban partnership areas, along
with Castlemilk in Glasgow, Ferguslie Park in Paisley, and Whitfield in
Dundee, designated by the Scottish Office in 1988 for a 10-year
multi-agency blitz led by the Scottish Office.
It was the new approach which followed the 10-year appraisal of the
Glasgow Eastern Area Renewal Project in 1986. That found that despite
the physical regeneration, the employment opportunities were being taken
by people from outwith the area. It highlighted the lack of skills in
deprived areas and concluded that the need was not only to train the
unemployed in those areas but to attract other people with more skills
into them.
Essentially the task of the Urban Partnerships is to iron out the
social and economic differences between their areas and the surrounding
ones. It is a tall order. The current unemployment rate in Wester Hailes
is 17% -- not by any means the worst pocket in Scotland. In Edinburgh as
a whole, however, it is 8%. Since statistics were published ward by ward
12 years ago, they have moved up and down with the economy, but the one
constant has been that the figure for Wester hailes is twice that for
Edinburgh.
Strategists in local authorities and elsewhere have argued that while
improving housing meets certain needs, it cannot in itself create jobs
and a much more radical shift in Scottish Office thinking is needed to
bring major new employers back into the cities which grew from an
industrial base.
One of the stated aims of the Wester Hailes Partnership is to halve
the gap between unemployment rates there and in Edinburgh. A closer
inspection of the figures shows that the rate for women is 8% compared
with 24% for men. The major problem of all the partnership areas is the
post-industrial age. There are no longer large numbers of manual or
semi-skilled jobs for men. Training is one way of tackling that. Another
of the post-Gear solutions was to use community-funded jobs and
community businesses as a stepping-stone back to commercially-based
employment. That approach is seen as patronisingly wrong-headed by
critics of the present industrial strategy in the Scottish Office. Dr
Douglas Robertson of the Centre for Housing Policy and Practice at
Stirling University, is one who fears that the jobs generated by the
partnerships amount to a service sector for the poor.
Willie Docherty, director of the Wester Hailes Partnership, says
criticism that it's all about houses and not about jobs, despite being
led by the Industry Department, is unfair. He accepts that improving
housing is easier than improving job prospects and says the next five
years will be when the jobs can begin to be counted. ''We are not taking
a one-club approach, we are tackling it with the whole golf bag,'' he
said. He expects the upgrading of the town centre to provide a
significant number of jobs as well as a physical and psychological
boost.
Plans include a refurbishment of the shopping centre, a new bingo
hall, multi-screen cinema, ice-rink and library. The display in the
shopping centre has attracted optimistic interest. Tracy Simpson's hopes
are high. At 32 she's had enough of short-term shop jobs and is on a
training course which she hopes will lead to a career in residential
care. ''I'd like to do something to help teenagers.''
Others want to know why most of the new employers are still being
lured to new towns and greenfield sites when the people who need the
jobs are on the edge of the cities.

AJAX, reigning European Champions, have protested to UEFA about the
increasing racial abuse being suffered by their players.
The Amsterdam club, which has been discriminated in the past because
of its Jewish origins, have threatened to withdraw their players from
any forthcoming tie in which there is any recurrence.
Indeed Ajax, who have eleven coloured players in their squad,
contemplated such extreme action during last week's tie against
Ferencvaros in Hungary where they prevailed despite a relentless torrent
of bigotry.
The problem also exists within Holland and the Dutch FA is determined
to stamp it out. Referees have been authorised to abandon games when
racist behaviour becomes intolerable.
Louis van Gaal, the coach who has stylishly guided Ajax to the
pinnacle of the European game, revealed his concern. He said: ''Around
50 per cent of my players are black and they now are being affected.
''The chants were so bad in Hungary that I threatened a walk-out at
half-time. The time is coming when this action will be taken.''
Their gifted coloured midfielder Edgar Davids added: ''We try not to
listen to the jibes but this eventually becomes impossible. Some players
are affected more than others.''
A Dutch FA spokesman said:'We must lead by example and do everything
possible to stamp out racism within our football.''
Players at Antwerp in Belgium have already taken a commendable stand
against their own unruly supporters.
They called a press conference last week to blame their rioting, pitch
invasions and vandalism within the stadium for undermining their form.
Damage at their latest match will cost more than #100,000 to repair.
They also demanded more action to weed out the culprits and have them
banned.
Black defender Pascal Zere, sent off for the third time this season
with Harelbeke in Belgium, has blamed his disciplinary record on his
inability to cope with racial taunts.
* UEFA have been embarrassed by the admission of Sepp Piontek, the
coach of Danish side Aalborg, who were drafted into the Champions League
to replace Dynamo Kiev, banned for bribery.
Aalborg were beaten in Denmark last week by Panathinaikos and Piontek
revealed: ''I wonder what we are doing in this competition. We have not
been able to prepare for it properly.
''We are not a big enough club and have no chance of reaching the
quarter-finals.''
* THE German FA is considering a request from St Pauli to order a
replay of their game with Hansa Rostock which the Hamburg team lost 2-0.
St Pauli lost the services of their keeper after a tear-gas canister was
thrown.

SCOTLAND's international players will meet within the next ten days to
formulate their position in advance of contracts being issued by the
Scottish Rugby Union.
Players' Trust spokesman Rob Wainwright said yesterday after the
International Board meeting in Tokyo had ratified the Paris Declaration
which sweeps away the game's amatereurism regulations, that the players
were now as keen as the SRU to get the contracts in place before the
first Test of the season against Western Samoa at Murrayfield on
November 18
Wainwright, who returns from English Division I side West Hartlepool
at Christmas and is likely to rejoin Edinburgh Academicals, added: ''We
want to get some form of agreement with the Union which would be
mutually beneficial. Obviously we want to maximise our earnings and we
realise that there is a finite amount of money available but we would
certainly like to be involved in the decision-making process,'' he said.
The international players' agent, the former Scotland prop Ian
McLauchlan, will meet SRU officials on Wednesday night for the first
bout of serious contract negotiations. Until now negotiations had been
delayed pending this weekend's IB ratification in Tokyo.
SRU Board representative Fred McLeod was due back in Scotland last
night and will stage a media briefing at Murrayfield today.
The IB also announced that the 1999 Rugby World Cup will be increased
from 16 nations to 20. Only this year's finalists, South Africa and New
Zealand, play-off winners France, and hosts Wales will qualify
automatically.
The introduction of restrictions on rugby league players being
reinstated into the union code have been placed in the hands of domestic
officials.
* Gary Armstrong, who has been out for a month with a rib injury, took
a full part in Scotland's work-out at Murrayfield yesterday and is set
to make his comeback for Jed-Forest against Currie on Saturday.
Director of Rugby Jim Telfer said that the team for the Western Samoan
game would be picked on October 30 and an announcement on the captaincy
would be made then as well.

GARY Armstrong came within a signature of crossing the great divide to
rugby league for a deal worth nearly #200,000, he reveals in his
autobiography to be published this week and serialised exclusively in
The Herald.
Negotiations between the Jed-Forest and Scotland scrumhalf and the
then fledgling Carlisle club had reached an advanced stage and contracts
were about to be exchanged when Armstrong's lawyer ran a check on the
club's finances and they were discovered to be technically insolvent.
The deal was almost struck after a series of secret meetings but came
to nothing after the lawyer had conducted the financial check.
Armstrong declares: ''At the back of my mind was the niggling doubt
that if I signed professional forms then I would just become a piece of
meat to be sold on the open market to the highest bidder.
''I'd had approaches from top flight rugby league clubs and I was
worried that, perfectly understandably, Carlisle might want to sell me
on for a profit at some point in the future.
''Eventually the whole affair just dwindled and died. In retrospect
I'm glad, and I still had good times to come with my club and
Scotland.''
Today, Armstrong reveals, too, that, of all his international
opponents, he has little or no time for England who he condemns for
their arrogance and, in particular, he lambasts England hooker Brian
Moore for possession of the biggest mouth in world rugby and fellow
Englishman Mickey Skinner for emptying a jug of water over Scotland
hooker Kenny Milne at a post-match banquet.
He recalls, too, the French lesson administered at Parc des Princes by
the Tricolors Pierre Berbizier. ''He just took the mickey out of me.
After the game he walked off the pitch without shaking hands and
wouldn't swop jerseys. I hadn't earned his respect.
''I never forgot that lesson and when we went back to Paris two years
later I gave as good as I got. At the end, Berbizier was all over me
wanting to shake my hand.

IT'S a funny old thing, but I can't help but thinking that this early
start to the leagues has caught most of our clubs embarrassingly off
balance with lack of preparation. Every Sunday it seems Welsh games that
we see on TV produce more tries as the sides down there make a real
effort to go for the extra points that the tries bring them. Last week
the scorer of the relevant try for Cardiff, Steve Ford I think, shook
his fist in triumph when he realised that in crossing the line he had
not only given his team five points, but a bonus one in the leagues.
He was happy, the crowd were happy, we were even happy sitting 400
miles away, that there was a real attempt to put on a spectacle in front
of a far bigger crowd than would watch all but the Rangers and Celtic of
our world. It's something we could be thinking about as soon as possible
is the additional league points for scoring tries. The Welsh may never
again be the power they were in world rugby, but their club stuff has
always been good to watch and they look to be organised and innovative
this season.
Speak to the folk involved in rugby here in Scotland and they can
hardly believe that here we are almost in the middle of the competition
and we are barely into October. It used to be that nothing very serious
happened until after the September weekend, but all of the teams have
now played six league matches.
It has been that hurried rush into high-level competition that has, no
doubt about it, contributed to some of the scrappy games on view, and
the injuries. A conclusion then is that either the leagues started too
early at the very inception of the season, or the players and clubs
weren't ready. In either case fault is easy to apportion.
I actually think that very few clubs got their collective acts
together early enough, and you can see that some of them are only
getting into gear, and demonstrating some kind of pattern now that we
are past the tail of September. It will be an arresting problem next
season, assuming the clubs never relinquish hold of centre stage in our
domestic set-up to a more European outlook and an emphasis on provincial
rugby, for the clubs to get themselves far more prepared than they were
this year. Only an influx of overseas players has saved some clubs.
One of the side-effects of the lack of preparation of the clubs is
that the national selectors will need a whole sideboard full of headache
pills as they try to make sense of the performances of Scotland's
players and make their minds up about who replaces Gavin Hastings as
full back, for one, and who replaces Gavin Hastings as place kicker for
another.
Aye, there seems a long way to go in club rugby in Scotland, and we
all know it.
* ONE club trying to expand rugby in the West are the Hamilton
Academicals who have recently concluded a 60-year lease with Strathclyde
Regional Council to take over the playing fields at Laigh Bent in
Hamilton. They intend to raise a half a million pounds to build a new
clubhouse and all-weather surfaces.
Tonight they have an open night, and Doddie Weir, Bryan Redpath and
Stewart Hamilton will be there. I'm going along to see what they propose
and it is quite impressive as they believe, as I do, that if you don't
like football in this country, then you're ignored.
Their first XV are back into the leagues, but it's what they are doing
lower down the grades that is so impressive, not just in rugby. Their
prospectus reads: ''Women's rugby is the fastest growing sport in the
Western Hemisphere . . . basketball is another growth sport . . .''
They will promote tennis, and, importantly, a broad range of women's
sports. A circular to local schools has produced 34 girls who want to
play rugby. You can play touch rugby, you see. You can't play touch
football.

Gala 12, Melrose 29
DODDIE WEIR'S lineout ascendancy, the power threat of a detached Isaac
Feaunati, and the cultured direction from Craig Chalmers were important
ingredients as Melrose ground out a hard-fought Netherdale triumph over
a Gala side deprived on match morning of their captain, Gary Issac, and
whose backs couldn't quite achieve the incisive qualities of their
opponents.
Weir's craft and expertise ensured that Melrose were able to drive a
fair percentage of their throw-in possession so that their experienced
midfield operated from an advancing platform.
Feaunati took some holding in augmenting a back line in which every
member at one time or another made some inroad.
Had their finishing been more clinical, Melrose would have had more
than their two trys although in brave Gala cover and tackle, John Amos,
David Changleng, and Brian Swan set splendid examples.
One Chris Dalglish tackle and swift retreat by Mark Moncrieff thwarted
respectively Derek Bain's threat and Jimmy Turnbull's surge and chip.
Chalmers didn't strike every place kick on the meat yet piloted over
19 points from five penalty goals and two conversions, his timing
improving with each effort.
David Boland kept hold of his basics in a spirited display and
Changleng embraced a mainly percentage format with improving use of his
boot, although he must work on his weaker foot and one miscue almost
opened the way for another try by Gary Parker, who twice came in off his
left foot with disarming effect.
Scott Paterson made some important tackles but wasn't entirely
convincing at full back and limited in intrusion opportunities that
might have provided more ammunition for two snappy wings, of whom
Moncrieff had a plus or two in restricted space.
Nor were Gala able to make scrummage profit out of their much heavier
tight five so that Tom Weir had just the one explosive pick-up,
repetition of which might have lessened the impact made by the Melrose
breakaways.
Steven Scott covered acres to much support effect, Scott Aitken
provided an additional lineout dimension, and Nick Broughton embraced
the less glamorous chores with unfettered enthusiasm.
Melrose also came closer to achieving the link between drive and
spread and were more effective in dislodging Gala ball in the tackle.
Yet, because of error in judgment and execution, committed defending,
and too much punting by sides so conversant with each other's method,
the contest lacked flow and continuity of spectacle and never looked
likely to match the 77 points of last year's meeting.
It spoke volumes, however, for Gala resolve that they lifted their
tempo in battling back from 19-3 to 19-12, albeit with the second,
third, and fourth of Changleng's penalty goals although it also took
Broughton sinkings of Paterson and Moncrieff to check impending danger.
Both Melrose tries were cleverly constructed. Bryan Redpath and
Broughton achieved surging counter-attack prior to ruck delivery that
enabled Redpath to shrug past two tackles for the score.
Then, when Scott supported another Turnbull break, Redpath and
Chalmers switched ruck ball left and Graham Shiel's double miss pass
opened the gate for Parker to scuttle home.
Melrose, thus, topped the table while narrowing the gap in league
games with this sixth win to Gala's 13.

DAMON HILL conceded defeat in his world championship bid yesterday
after having crashed out of an extraordinary race won by title-holder
Michael Schumacher.
''I will not be world champion this year,'' said Hill, who is 27
points behind Schumacher with three races to contest. ''There is still a
mathematical chance but the championship is over.
''I'm obviously disappointed. I put up a great fight and did
everything I could to win the race.
''It just did not come off but I do not feel any regrets, nor am I too
downhearted.''
Hill slid out of contention just eight laps from the finish when he
slammed into a tyre wall after his steering had been damaged in an
earlier incident with race leader Jean Alesi.
''I would not have settled for second place -- that was no good to me.
I had to get past Alesi as he was holding me up and I was losing time to
Michael,'' added Hill.
''I did not leave any margin for error. Alesi must have seen me yet
gave me no room. But let's not get embroiled in anything about that.''
Earlier, Hill and Schumacher had engaged in a series of breathtaking
overtaking manoeuvres with each trying to outdo the other.
Hill recovered from a dreadful start when he slipped from second to
fourth and passed his rival, only to be retaken on the same lap as he
went wide on a corner.
The Englishman tried again, with Schumacher -- racing under the shadow
of a suspended ban -- going to the limit to prevent his opponent and
almost forcing him off the circuit when he hit the back of Schumacher's
car.
He finally passed Schumacher when the German went in for his second
stop midway through the race. Hill later made it clear that he bore the
German no ill-will.
''That's the way he drives,'' said Hill.
Hill's disappointment was doubled as the resistance of Alesi, who had
led for most of the race, finally broke on the penultimate lap as
Schumacher overtook him before celebrating his second victory on home
soil this season.
David Coulthard's hopes of a second successive victory were hit by a
spin during the formation lap which forced him to use the spare car
which had been prepared for team-mate Hill.
Coulthard, who led in the early stages before faltering after a pit
stop, eventually finished third, 35 seconds behind Schumacher.
Alesi, whose gamble of racing on slick tyres paid offwhen he inherited
the lead as the top three stopped early, went in for his only pitstop
with an advantage of nearly 40 seconds.
Schumacher's Benetton colleague Johnny Herbert was fifth, one place
ahead of Jordan's Eddie Irvine, who celebrated his signing for Ferrari
with a rare points finish.
Ligier's Martin Brundle was seventh but McLaren's Mark Blundell, who
began the day out of a job for next season, spun out after 15 laps.
Schumacher's victory and Herbert's fifth place enabled Benetton to
extend their lead over Williams in the constructors' championship to 20
points.
1, M Schumacher (Germany), Benetton, 1hr 39min 59.044sec (average

CHAMPIONS TROPHY
ENGLAND'S hockey players finished sixth and last in the Champions
Trophy in Berlin yesterday when they lost 6-5 in a penalty shoot-out
after drawing 2-2 with India.
''No complaints, but it would have been useful encouragement for our
younger players to have finished fifth,'' said England manager David
Whittle.
''Considering we brought a squad full of late replacements, including
two uncapped players, we have performed well enough to suggest we can
achieve a lot more in the future.''
Olympic and European champions Germany won the Trophy final on
penalties after Australia had scored a late equaliser to force a 2-2
draw.
Matthew Smith to put Australia ahead after 27 minutes -- it was the
first goal conceded by Germany in the tournament -- but the European
side equalised three minutes into the second half through Patrick
Bellenbaum.
Within three minutes, Germany were ahead again when substitute
Christoph Bechmann netted, but Australian skipper Mark Hager grabbed a
late leveller after Jay Stacy's shot from a penalty corner had been
saved.
Holders Pakistan finished third when they came from behind to beat
Holland 2-1 in a play-off match.

Airdrie 0, Hamilton 0
SEVENTEEN months after vacating Broomfield, now the site of a
supermarket, Airdrie are still looking for somewhere to call home.
The frustrations of a temporary tenancy at Broadwood were again in
evidence in a disappointing 0-0 draw against fellow-nomads Hamilton.
The open-ended Cumbernauld venue lacks the intimacy the Diamonds have
been used to and the fact that only 1461 turned up for a Lanarkshire
derby must be of serious concern -- even more so since the side are
challenging for promotion to the premier division and are in the
semi-final of the Coca-Cola Cup.
The dwindling support could turn into a real crisis unless the
authorities hasten a decision on Airdrie's application for planning
permission for a new stadium at Raebog on the outskirts of the town.
Manager Alex MacDonald was disappointed at taking only a point in a
game they dominated and admitted that there is a pressing need for those
in local authority power not to inhibit the club's progress.
He said: ''The money is there and we are just waiting for the
go-ahead.''
The early play suggested an all-action encounter in prospect with
Hamilton keeper Allan Ferguson saving bravely at the feet of Jim
McIntyre while Paul Hartley and Gary Clark fired narrowly over at the
other end. But goalmouth incidents were in short supply, although Paul
Harvey, Sandy Stewart, and substitute Peter Duffield hit the woodwork
for Airdrie who were also denied by a series of instinctive saves from
Ferguson. MacDonald said: ''We played some excellent football but could
not take our chances.
''There are times, however, when we need to be more direct and put
additional pressure on opponents. We played two many square balls.''
Hamilton manager Iain Munro feels his side are making some progress,
having drawn three games in succession after four opening defeats. They
remain in bottom spot and Munro, who lost leading-scorer Duffield to
Airdrie in a #135,000 close-season deal admits his experience is badly
missed. He said: ''We were always a goal threat last season, but not
this time.
''If the players can get more confidence in themselves I am sure the
results will come.''

Clydebank 2, Dumbarton 1
IT was Clydebank's worst display of the season, according to manager
Brian Wright. But the Bankiesrecorded their first home win, collected
three valuable points, and the fans went home happy. ''It's a funny old
game, right enough,'' mused Wright.
He believes there was nothing wrong with the derby performance against
Dumbarton which cannot be sorted out on the training ground.
Dumbarton's Jim Fallon was also optimistic, despite watching his side
slump to their fifth league defeat in a row since taking charge.
Fallon was adamant there is no confidence crisis at Boghead. ''I don't
have to give the team any confidence; we played well and will take it
from there. There is a lot of spirit, everyone worked, everyone
contributed to the game,'' he said.
In truth, Dumbarton have real problems with inconsistency during the
90 minutes that teams, even when playing badly, will punish. Clydebank,
still struggling with a new three-man system at the back, badly missed
skipper Scott Murdoch whose father died last week, with the funeral on
Saturday morning.
However, top scorer Jim Grady gave them a dream start with a super
headed goal in 22 minutes from a cross from Gary Bowman, who somehow had
managed to shake off two defenders.
David Nicholls and Gary Agnew then took control of midfield, always
finding that extra yard to create openings. They were well supported by
two wide men, Bowman and Joe Robertson.
Clydebank were contained for the rest of the first half mainly by an
impressive performance by Chic Charnley, a man among boys -- and still a
character who amuses and exasperates in one.
The home side, who could have been three up at the interval, collapsed
early in the second half, allowing the visitors back in with a fine run
and shot by Charlie Gibson in 56 minutes.
But Dumbarton could not turn the screw even as the home fans in the
disappointing 939-strong crowd got more and more restless.
Led by left-back Colin Sutherland, the Bankies' recovery included a
Ken Eadie diving header which came off the bar. Grady turned goal-maker
in 83 minutes, cutting back a cross to the far post by Nicholls for
Sutherland to tap in from a yard.

EAST Fife's winning goal at Ochilview may not have exactly come out of
the blue, but certainly the winner had origins across the Atlantic.
Arnold Dwarika, who has won about 50 caps for Trinidad and Tobago
including some World Cup qualifying matches, shares a flat in Dundee
with Raith Rovers' Tony Rougier, who hails from the same Caribbean
island. When one thinks also of Jerren Nixon and of Livingston's
Barbadian goalkeeper Horace Stoute, the thought occurs that they could
have an interesting side if the footballers banded together as the West
Indies, just like their cricketers do.
Dwarika is a typical striker from that part of the world -- full of
running, with skill on the ball and a readiness to shoot. He had a
curling 20-yard shot well saved just a couple of minutes before the only
goal of Saturday's game at Stenhousemuir. With 10 minutes left, Robert
Scott headed the ball on to the West Indian substitute, who made no
mistake.
'Muir manager Terry Christie admitted that his team will have to pick
themselves up for Wednesday's Challenge Cup semi-final against Stirling
Albion at Forthbank.
Albion drew 1-1 at home to Clyde, whose Ian McConnell replied in kind
to Craig Taggart's headed goal. Berwick hit back for a 4-1 rout of Queen
of the South at Dumfries, where the home fans are as frustrated as those
of Ayr, whom they entertain next Saturday.
Ayr had a goalless draw at home to Stranraer, as did Forfar -- who had
Bobby Mann and Dougie Craig sent off -- against lowly Montrose.

Selkirk 13, Jed-Forest 33
TO WATCH Calum Brown rampage over every inch of the Philiphaugh turf,
one could hardly believe he is only now recovering from a groin injury
sustained in the final match of last season.
The Jed-Forest flanker scored all three tries which broke Selkirk on
Saturday, and set the stage for a showdown against the division-two
leaders, Currie, next weekend.
Victory at Riverside would bring Jed level at the head of the table,
and the hosts promise the return of international scrum half Gary
Armstrong for the crucial game.
''Yes, Gary is going for it next weekend,'' confirmed coach Donald
Miller. ''Clark Laidlaw did well in his place, but if we can take as
much ball against Currie as we did here, then Gary will lend another
dimension. Realistically, I think we can now win promotion.''
With the air mild and the ball dry initially, scavenging backs kept
Selkirk in the game off sparse rations, trailing 13-10 at the interval.
Keith McConnell plunged over after a two-handed take at the lineout, Pow
converting, then eventually adding two penalties.
But when drizzle arrived as forecast, Jed kept it tight, remorselessly
recycling from fourth and fifth phase, grinding down an impotent Selkirk
pack.
The clinically precise Chris Richards converted Brown's three tries,
and added four penalties as home deficiencies were exposed by Jed's
maurading back row.
''That's the worst I've seen us in years,'' confided Selkirk coach
John Rutherford. ''Jed were first to everything -- played us off the
park.''
His casualty list, which includes New Zealand prop Bev Johnson (sprung
ribs), hooker David Graham (ankle ligaments), and back-row forward Dave
Nichol (knee), deepened the gloom.
Despite having to draft in Scotland under-18 centre Duncan Hemmings
and stand-off Greg McKechnie for his first match, Jed gelled from the
start.
The previous weekend, Brown had been summoned at 45 minutes' notice to
his comeback, and was ''not mentally prepared,'' he admits. This time he
was, first initiating moves, then in at the kill, with tries in 15, 54,
and 60 minutes.
''It was only my second game since last spring. My groin has been a
real problem after two previous operations.''
Can't wait to see him fit.
Selkirk -- D Hunter; R Pow, K Johnston, D Gage, M Jaffray; S Nichol, S
Tomlinson; B Johnson, D Graham, S McColm, K McConnell, D Cameron, D
Nichol, S Laurie, W Gentleman. Replacements -- P Minto for Nichol
(60min), D Johnston for D Graham (73).
Jed-Forest -- C Richards; K Amos, D Hemmings, D Scott, M Yule; G
McKechnie, C Laidlaw; N McIlroy, K Barrie, G Kerr, C Hynd, A Dunnet, K
Armstrong, C J Brown, R Kirkpatrick. Replacement -- S Turnbull for D
Scott (25).
Referee -- R Megson (Edinburgh Wanderers).
SCORERS: Selkirk -- Pow 2p, 1c; McConnell 1t. Jed-Forest -- Richards
4p, 3c; Brown 3t.

DAVID Coulthard ended weeks of anticipation when he was named
yesterday as a McLaren driver for next season -- and immediately
insisted the former Formula One greats could be winners again.
Coulthard has agreed a lucrative two-year deal that will make him a
millionaire, with fellow Briton Mark Blundell making way for the
Scottish ace.
The Monaco-based driver will partner Finland's Mika Hakkinen next year
for the Mercedes-powered outfit which has not won a race since Ayrton
Senna triumphed in Australia in 1993.
''It will be disappointing to leave Williams,'' admitted Coulthard,
who effectively joined McLaren when world champion Michael Schumacher
opted for Ferrari.
''Williams were my first team in Formula One and gave me my first
grand prix victory. But I think I have been of value to the team over
the last two-and-a-half years and helped in their success.
''But it is an exciting move to McLaren. They are one of the top three
teams in Formula One along with Williams and Ferrari, certainly in terms
of finance,'' said Coulthard.
''When you see the changes they have made this year, with that sort of
commitment it is only a matter of time before they produce a winning
car.
''They were a mile away at the start of the season and although they
have not been as competitive in the last couple of races they have made
great steps forward.''
''The secret of Williams' success is their continuity with Renault.
That will be a factor next season with McLaren when they enter their
second year with Mercedes.''
McLaren chief Ron Dennis wanted Coulthard this season but Williams
went to a contracts board to clinch his services before deciding midway
through this campaign to partner Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve.
Dennis is delighted to have finally captured the Scot after having
lost out to Ferrari over Schumacher.
''Performances will ultimately determine how long David stays with the
team,'' said Dennis.
''The initial period of contract is for two years but our objective is
to win races together and there is no reason why he cannot stay with the
team until his retirement.''

Dunfermline 2, St Johnstone 1
KENNY Dalglish sat wrapped up well against the chill wind that
whistled through East End Park on Saturday. The problem was that what
was served up, especially by most of the home lot during the afternoon,
did little to warm the Blackburn Rovers' employee or many others in the
old ground for that matter.
The English champions, as everyone knows, are sweet on Dunfermline
defender Jackie McNamara, so there was the great man having a peek.
Dalglish should have been impressed as the full back nipped up and down
the field with great zest and purpose, but the rest of the Dunfermline
side, well, that's different.
Dunfermline, on their most recent showing, are light years away from
being a good side. Although successful against St Johnstone, they
perhaps should feel embarrassed at taking all the points.
The kind of moves that people pay to watch, inter-passing, darting
runs, and intelligent play mostly came from the guys in blue shirts. So
why were they stuffed, you may ask. The answer is one of stature, or
lack of it.
The Perth side badly need a centre half to play alongside Davie Irons,
someone with authority when the ball comes hurtling into their danger
zone. This was St Johnstone's Achilles heel on Saturday, and Dunfermline
eventually exploited it to telling effect.
The game started well enough for the away side with George O'Boyle
scoring just after 12 minutes, but Stewart Petrie and Greg Shaw, late in
the day, spoiled their afternoon.
It could have been different had St Johnstone striker Kevin Twaddle
remembered to place a right and left boot on his corresponding feet, or
at least this appeared to be his trouble when it came to shooting. But
his manager, Paul Sturrock, would have no truck with criticism for
Twaddle.
''He is going to be the new Ted McMinn of this era,'' said Sturrock.
Is that good or bad? ''You saw the good, bad, and ugly of Kevin today,''
added the manager. ''But you must remember that he has just come from
junior football. I know he has it in him.''
One man who has what it takes is McNamara. He said he was unaware of
Dalglish's presence, but added it would be a ''dream come true'' to move
on upward and better his game.
Kenny, why not ask Uncle Jack if you can borrow his cheque book.

JOHN Bland shot a closing one-under-par round of 71 to claim a
four-shot victory yesterday on his seniors debut in the London Masters
at the London Golf Club.
The former European Tour regular from South Africa was 50 on Friday
and earned himself a #13,350 top prize birthday present with a
six-under-par 210.
And today, he flies to San Francisco to take up his first invitation
on the American Seniors tour at Napa.
He will try for his full US tour place at the pre-qualifying schools
in November and December, but plans to return for the main European
events next season.
There was disappointment for former PGA champion Tony Grubb, who had
opened with a new course record 68.
Grubb was always in contention for his first seniors victory until the
closing nine holes and lost outright second place and around #3500 after
three-putting on the final green.
Grubb posted a final 74 to join John Morgan (73) and two other South
Africans, Bobby Verwey (69) and Hugh Inggs (74), on two-under-par 214.
Leading final aggregates (British and Irish unless stated):
210 -- J Bland (S Africa) 70, 69, 71 (#13,350).
214 -- B Verwey (S Africa) 72, 73, 69; H Inggs (S Africa) 70, 70, 74;
J Morgan 71, 70, 73; T Grubb 68, 72, 74 (#5332 each).
216 -- C Evans (USA) 73, 70, 73 (#3200).
217 -- N Coles 73, 70, 74; B Waites 75, 71, 71; N Ratcliffe
(Australia) 74, 69, 74 (#2720 each).
218 -- B Hunt 72, 72, 74; T Horton 74, 73, 71; J Fourie (S Africa) 73,
72, 73; L Higgins 72, 72, 74; B Huggett 71, 75, 72.
219 -- A Garrido (Spain) 75, 72, 72; F Abreu (Spain) 72, 72, 75; R
Campagnoli (Italy) 77, 74, 68; M Gregson 74, 72, 73.
220 -- D Creamer 74, 72, 74; J Hudson 75, 73, 72; C O'Connor 73, 71,
76; G Will 71, 78, 71; R Vines (Australia) 74, 73, 73.
* GLASGOW assistant John Greaves, together with his amateur partner
Ian Anderson, won the Denis Lovell Assistants' Foursomes at Royal
Dornoch on Saturday.
The pair carded a highly creditable Stableford total of 39 points to
finish two points ahead of two partnerships led respectively by Cardross
assistant Alan Purdie and Paul Wardell of Longniddry.
Scottish under-25 champion Nigel Scott-Smith from Dullatur tied for
fifth place on 36 points with Haldane Lee of Routenburn. Leading totals:
39 -- J Greaves (Glasgow) and I Anderson.
37 -- A Purdie (Cardross) and J McGregor; P Wardell (Longniddry) and B
Duthie.
36 -- N Scott-Smith (Dullatur) and G Urquhart; H Lee (Routenburn) and
A Graham.

AND then there was one. Arsenal's 1-0 defeat at Chelsea on Saturday
left Nottingham Forest as the only unbeaten team in the Premiership, yet
with nothing more than eighth place in the table to show for it.
Not bested, in fact, since last February by anyone other than Malmo
(in the UEFA Cup) and Bradford City (in the Coca Cola Cup), they lack
last season's winning combination of consistency and flair. What Frank
Clark's team has post-Collymore, might be better described as a drawing
combination, having finished level in five of their eight league games.
Saturday's 3-0 win over Manchester City was thus only their third and
must be measured against the poverty of the opposition. Far from
building on the confidence gained from a successful fight against
relegation last spring, City have regressed and Alan Ball is losing
support weekly. His cause was not helped on Saturday by Ian Brightwell's
dismissal a minute before half time, and a seventh successive defeat
duly followed.
Bolton are now the only side still within their reach at the bottom,
and that thanks only to a last minute home defeat inflicted by Queens
Park Rangers. Danielle Dichio, already keeping out the England under-21
international Kevin Gallen, appears to be put on his mettle by Mark
Hateley's arrival at Loftus Road, scoring a fifth goal in four games.
Champions Blackburn were well beaten again, 2-0 at Middlesbrough,
despite joining the growing ranks of those clubs using a more modern
3-5-2 system. Theirs involved moving Chris Sutton back into defence, but
he was not able to prevent Nick Barmby and Craig Hignett taking 'Boro
into seventh place.
Elsewhere, Saturday was derby day in England as well as Scotland,
which may explain why the goals that fell like rain the previous week
slowed to something nearer a trickle.
Only Tottenham and Wimbledon, whose meetings are never uneventful,
managed as many as four goals between them, Spurs claiming three to
continue an improved run. Teddy Sheringham, scorer of two at QPR last
Monday, added two more.
Imported stars shone brightest in the three other local derbies. Ruud
Gullit overshadowed not only his compatriot, Dennis Bergkamp, but
everyone else as well in Chelsea's victory over Arsenal.
Tony Yeboah, presented with a goal of the month award before Leeds's
game at home to Sheffield Wednesday, added a contender for the September
prize which is likely to be beaten only by his own strike at Wimbledon
the previous week. Gary Speed added a second as Wednesday were well
beaten. David Hirst was sent off for foul language.
Another cosmopolitan Premiership day was rounded off by Aston Villa's
Serbian striker Savo Milosevic, scorer of two late goals as Coventry's
38-year-old player-coach Gordon Strachan was unable to turn the tide in
a 3-0 home defeat.

NOT SO long ago a funeral march was the most apt theme to play at

Now a vibrant young Clach team brings a different musical sound to the
Inverness club's dressing room.
Clach boss Roshie Fraser and assistant John Innes have had their team

Following his side's sparkling show against Buckie Thistle, he said:
''Our dressing room boogie box appears to be working wonders!''
Hearts sent spies north on Saturday to tune in to a Clach side already

Midfielder Stuart Golabeck is believed to have been the Edinburgh

Clach have a rich seam of talent in Stuart McKay, a trialist at
Sheffield Utd, Golabeck, Chris Stone, Darren McLachlan, and Colin
Sinclair, amongst others.
Elsewhere, wily Wick Academy boss Don Cowie masterminded his club's

Ex-County stalwart Cowie watched as Alan Duff, another former Victoria

THE new season is a month old today. Can it only be four weeks since
the Scottish game embarked upon its journey into the uncharted territory
of premiership, professionalism and Cup? Unbelievable as it may seem,
yes it is.
Time, then, for an interim report. How fares the great game as it
seeks to come to terms with so much that is new and, in some cases,
forbidding? Well, to tell the truth, the three words which spring
immediately to mind are bewitched, bothered, and bewildered.
Today Scotland's two International Board representatives, Fred McLeod
and Allan Hosie, will return from Tokyo like wise men from the East
bearing on tablets of stone the Board's final dictat on professionalism.
Yes, we know that it was Moses and not the wise men who came down from
Mount Sinai with the biblical commandments but the image of McLeod and
Hosie slip-slidin' down Mount Fuji and then paying the excess airline
baggage charges on the weighty pronouncements is one that has us, at
least, chortling into our columnar coffee.
Remember, too, that once Moses had struggled back with the
commandments etched in stone, he discovered that the Israelites were
engaged in idolatrous worship and was so cheesed off that he rent the
tablets asunder by throwing them to the ground.
Heaven forfend, then, that when McLeod and Hosie arrive at Murrayfield
today they will have to cast their IB tablets of stone to the ground
because, in their absence, there has been just too much worshipping of
graven images and too much in the way of unrealistic expectations.
To whit. There isn't a club side in Scotland which can afford to pay
its players and anybody who says that there is is living in cloud cuckoo
land. Since the start of this season, clubs have pulled out all the
stops in an effort to maximise sponsorship and marketing opportunities.
Even after all that effort, nobody is getting rich.
And anybody who has been around club grounds in Scotland this past
month will have been struck by one unarguable fact. With one or two
welcome exceptions, most notably the throng which attended the
Watsonians v Melrose clash at Myreside, the premiership is certainly
attracting no more #6-a-head spectators than did the championship last
season.
Where, then, is the money coming from to pay club players? The answer
to that one is easy. There isn't any and there won't be. Within the next
couple of weeks, and once McLeod and Hosie have delivered the word from
on high, then the clubs and their representatives might be just a little
less bewitched, bothered and bewildered but we wouldn't bet on it.
But what of the rugby this season? Often, so bewildering and at the
same time so damned interesting have the off-field machinations been
these past four weeks that it has been only too easy to look upon what
actually happens on the pitch as a dratted distraction from the big
picture.
Well I reckon that the eight-team premiership divisions have been good
for the game. I don't think that we should pay too much attention to
those clubs who maintain that the premiership set-up, with its two-down
format, is too brittle and encourages negative rugby. That is very much
a case of special pleading.
Gavin Hastings, in his new Hastings International Ltd guise, has taken
to calling the game ''the product''. And, probably, the ''product''
represents better value for money when every game means something rather
than under the old 14-team leagues when, let's be honest, many of the
games were mis-matches.
The message from Tokyo, then, will be one of ''keep taking the
tablets''. They might not make you feel any better but at least once
we've all sneaked a look at the prescription we might have a better idea
of just what those bewitched, bothered, and bewildered symptoms really
mean.

CUMBERNAULD indoor bowling club manager Hugh Duff rounded off a great
tournament for Scotland's bowlers when he lifted the SAGA International
Open title in Preston yesterday, and with it the #10,000 first prize.
Duff, world indoor champion in 1988, produced his best form since that
triumph at Alexandra Palace to beat Australian Ian Schuback 2-7, 7-3,
7-4, 7-1.
''I had a lot to prove this week after bad recent publicity,'' said
Duff, who was sent home from the home international outdoor championship
after having allegedly breaching a team curfew.
Duff counted an opening-end double but was left stunned as the man
from the Gold Coast replied with three shots on the second end followed
by a maximum 4 to wrap up the set 7-2 after just three ends.
''That put a lot of pressure on me for the second set,'' said Duff.
''I knew that I couldn't afford to lose that one -- against a man of
Ian's experience and ability. It would have been a tall order to come
back from 2-0 down.''
The Scot found the perfect answer in the second set. With the scores
tied at 3-3, he picked up a maximum 4 for a 7-3 win, and then went on to
take the third set 7-4.
The third set turned into the longest in the final, going to nine ends
before Duff got the match-winning single.
The players then traded singles on the opening two ends of the fourth
set before Duff produced his victory charge, reeling off six shots over
the next four ends to take the set 7-1 and the match.
''When you come down here you're just hoping to do your best, and
after getting through my opening two matches I really hit form in the
quarter-finals against the holder, Mark McMahon. I felt after that win I
could go all the way,'' added Duff.
A disappointed Schuback said; ''I didn't deserve to win it -- I
scratched around a bit and didn't have any touch. I under-read the pace
of the carpet -- it was certainly slower than yesterday's semi-finals.
''My only goal left now is to win another world indoor title. Schuback
has claimed two world pairs and a world singles win in recent years.
In Saturday's semi-finals, Duff saw off the challenge of fellow
Scottish international Paul Conlan in a top-class encounter. Duff took
the opening set 7-6, the second 7-3, but then saw Conlan, the reigning
Scottish champion, open his account with a 7-3 win in the third.
Duff forged into a 5-2 lead in the next set, but Conlan looked as if
he might force a decider when he squared with a count of 3 on the sixth
end, but Duff wrapped up victory with a double on the next end.
Schuback ended hopes of an all-Scottish final when he beat East
Lothian's Graham Robertson, winning 7-2, 2-7, 7-2, 7-5. Results:
Semi-final -- H Duff (Scotland) beat P Conlan (Scotland) 7-6, 7-3,
3-7, 7-5; I Schuback (Australia) beat G Robertson (Scotland) 7-2, 2-7,
7-2, 7-5. Final -- Duff beat Schuback 2-7, 7-3, 7-4, 7-1.

RAPID Breathing, stewarded by Rob Smith, made sailing history winning
the first Tunnocks Scottish Melges 24 Championship by drifting across
the finish line of yesterday's final race in more than 40 knots of wind
-- with no sails and no mast left standing -- to scrape to a third place
and win the Scottish title overall by just one-quarter of a point.
Smith, who won the Melges Class at the Rover Series on Loch Fyne in
May and then Cowes Week in August, has established his Welsh-based crew
as the class pacemakers when the winds are strong.
Rapid Breathing won the first of yesterday's two races off Kip Marina
by a comfortable margin. They were first again to the first buoy on the
second race yesterday and under no threat from the next two chasing
boats, set the bigger of two isometric spinakers, and paid the ultimate
penalty.
However, 500 metres short of the finish line, the boat buried its bow
in the back of a large wave and the space-age carbon-fibre mast
collapsed.
Relinquishing a half-mile lead, the crew were left to hold up handfuls
of sail-cloth each and with that rescued their title hopes.
Keith Musto, 1964 Olympic silver medallist in the Flying Dutchman
class, led through Saturday's three light-breeze races, scoring two
first places but later finished eighth and then retired from the fifth
and final contest. Top Scottish boat was Largs' Jim Donaldson in sixth
overall.
Overall result -- 1, Rapid Breathing 11.5 points; 2, Ab Trust Bounder
(M Richards) 11.75; 3, RawHyde (T Robinson) 27; 4, Pinnel &amp; Bax Sails (I
Barker) 28; 5, Hooked on Speed (K Musto) 29.5.

ADRIAN Callan held off fast-finishing Glen Stewart to give Shettleston
a narrow victory in Kilbarchan's 4 x 2 miles George Cummings Relay.
Clydesdale, fielding four international 800m runners, snatched third by
one second from Kilbarchan.
But Shettleston's margin of just five seconds over a makeshift Leslie
Deans Racing Club will be on the Glasgow team's minds as they look
forward to Saturday's official opening of the winter season, Victoria
Park's McAndrew Relay event at Scotstoun.
Shettleston, fielding their strongest team, led from the start and
enjoyed a 40-second margin at one stage. But only Callan's experience
and determination denied former Scottish 1500 metres champion Stewart,
who recorded the fastest lap of the day, having started 15 seconds down.
When the Edinburgh side call in such as Tom Hanlon, John Robson, Scott
Cohen, and Ian Brown -- plus Peter Fleming, if they can persuade him
back from Colorado -- they believe they have the depth to maintain their
domination of the relay season, and their hold on the Edinburgh to
Glasgow trophy. Results:
1, Shettleston (G Wight 11-23, G Mackay 11-33, W Coyle 11-39, A Callan
11-27) 46min 02sec; 2, LDRC (I Veitch 11-35, K Chapman 11-48, D Ross

* SCOTS filled four of the top five places in the final event of the
British Hill Racing Championship at Nant Peris in Wales, and Shettleston
seized second on the day to secure the British team championship bronze
-- the first Scottish club to win medals in the championship. Results:
Elidir Fawr 5-miles/2800ft hill race: 1, C Donnelly (Cambuslang) 51min

SRI Lanka dealt another blow to Pakistan's pride with a 49-run victory
yesterday in the second one-day international in Faisalabad to square
the three-match series.
Following Sri Lanka's surprise 2-1 win in the three-match Test series,
it was another reversal for the world one-day champions.
Put in to bat, Sri Lanka piled up a formidable 257 for seven, with
half-centuries by Sanath Jayasuriya and Asanka Gurusinha, and 47 from
Kent batsman Aravinda de Silva.
They then restricted Pakistan to 208 for eight in their 50 overs to
register their eleventh win in 51 one-day internationals between the
sides. The final one-day match will be played at Rawalpindi tomorrow.
Teenage opener Salim Elahi, a century-maker in Pakistan's win in the
first match in Gujranwala, was again their top scorer, hitting a 61-ball
47. But the remaining batsmen gradually fell behind in the run rate.
Sri Lanka were given a superb start by their top-order batsmen, built
on the foundation of a 75-run opening partnership between Roshan
Mahanama (30) and Jayasuriya, who hit 51 from only 72 balls.
Gurusinha continued the attack on the Pakistan bowlers with a 73-ball
66 and de Silva's 47 came from only 54 deliveries before he was run out.
* SOUTH Africa beat England in the final of the Hong Kong Sixes
yesterday and denied them a prize of a #65,000 diamond encrusted bat for
the first team to win the title three times.
England, winners for the past two years, missed out despite setting
South Africa a target of 82, with Surrey all-rounder Adam Hollioake
hitting 32 and Derbyshire's Phil DeFreitas 31.
Test players Adrian Kuiper (36) and Jonty Rhodes (20) steered South
Africa to 86 for three.

THERE was a lament for absent friends in the British camp yesterday
after two low-key teams struggled into the minor places at the World
Half-Marathon championships at Belfort, France.
The British men could finish only sixteenth in a race dominated almost
inevitably by Kenya. Spain -- on $8000 a man -- finished an impressive
second and Italy third, ahead of the emerging Japanese and, even more
surprisingly, Brazilians.
How Britain could have used Paul Evans. Their first counter, Martin
McLoughlin, was forty-fourth.
But it was Liz McColgan's absence which was most remarked on,
particularly noted by the women's winner, current Olympic marathon
champion Valentina Yegorova. The 31-year-old Russian is due to clash
with the Scot in next month's Tokyo marathon, and on yesterday's
evidence, is preparing for a vigorous defence of her title in Atlanta.
Yegorova, like McColgan, plagued with injury -- also a hip problem --
recorded 69min 58sec on a course with its share of uphill features.
Yegorova will be bidding for a hat trick of wins in Tokyo, having
finished fourth when McColgan won there in 1992, and expressed surprise
at her UK rival's absence.
The British women, however, did somewhat better than the men,
finishing eighth, with Cath Mijovic (74-13), Angie Hulley (74-16), and
Scotland's Vikki McPherson (74-27) -- all better placed than McLoughlin.
Non-scoring Pitreavie veteran, Trudi Thomson, hacked 39 seconds from her
previous best with 75-28.
''When I saw the time of 34-24 at 10,000 metres, I felt brilliant, but
I got a bit carried away and was passed by Cath, and then Angie caught
me,'' said McPherson, who will now take three weeks off before preparing
for the WorldCross series. Details:
Men: 1, M Tanui 61min 45sec; 2, P Yego 61-46; 3, C Tangus (all Kenya)
61-50; 4, A Serrano (Spain) 61-56; 5, J Thugwane (South Africa) 62-28;
6, DA Dos Santos (Brazil) 62-32. British placings: 44, M McLoughlin

RONNIE O'Sullivan made a shock exit from the Thailand Classic in
Bangkok yesterday.
The world No.3 lost 5-4 to Mark Johnston-Allen, the second time this
year the teenager has lost to the world No.48.
''He is a far better than his ranking might suggest. I could name
quite a few players I would rather have been up against,'' said the
Benson and Hedges Masters champion. ''I had a great chance to win the
last frame but messed it up when I'd made a break of 33.''
Johnston-Allen admitted he was apprehensive after O'Sullivan produced
a 78 break to force the decider.
''I was wondering what to expect from him at 4-4,'' said the
26-year-old. ''For four frames I was walking around in a daze wondering
what was going on. When I beat Ronnie in the British Open it was an
all-action match -- one chance and a frame was over.''
Johnston-Allen, who next tackles Dene O'Kane, added: ''His performance
wasn't what I expected and there were times when I couldn't concentrate
properly. But at the interval I gave myself a kick up the backside and
got on with the job.
''I think any player prefers an opponent to perform to the ability you
know they are capable of, but you still have to beat the name and
Ronnie's is a big name to beat.''
However, Johnston-Allen seems to have the right temperament against
top players, for he has become something of a bogy player also for world
champion Stephen Hendry.
Nigel Bond completed a 5-1 victory over Michael Duffy with a break of
105 and plays Steve Davis in the second round. Ulsterman Joe Swail
reeled off four frames to win an all-Irish battle by 5-2 against Ken
Doherty, while John Parrott cruised past Irish veteran Dennis Taylor
5-1.
Local hero James Wattana squeezed past Welshman Anthony Davies 5-4,
while Welsh veteran Terry Griffiths beat another Thai, former Asian
champion Rom Surin, 5-3.

IF LIZ McColgan proves as adept at conquering adverse weather
conditions in Atlanta as she was yesterday, then her dream of Olympic
marathon gold could well be fulfilled. But John Ngugi, former Olympic
5000 metres champion, returning after a three-year absence, is some
miles short of recapturing former glories.
Ngugi revealed that he, too, hopes to launch an Olympic marathon
career next year, but Kenya's five-times world cross-country champion,
having been belatedly reprieved from a dubious doping ban, could beat
McColgan by only 16 seconds over 10,000 metres in a brutally
inhospitable Edinburgh.
Just two weeks after dispatching the world marathon champion to win
the Great North Run half-marathon, McColgan recorded the fastest
10-kilometre time by any British female this year, 32min 27sec, to
eclipse the women's field in the BUPA Great Caledonian Run.
McColgan finished thirty-first overall, 64 seconds clear of the second
woman, Marian Sutton, and with international-standard men behind her.
''You know me -- I'm never happy,'' said McColgan. ''But in these
conditions, it's okay. It's one of the toughest courses you'll get.
''I'm preparing for the Tokyo Marathon, and did not let up on
training. I'd already covered 100 miles this week, and if I'd been
challenged, I could have gone faster. I feel very strong.''
Her time would have been a good one even in decent weather. Heavy rain
lashed the runners as they stood, stripped off, on the start line,
soaking them to the skin before the gun sounded. The rain mercifully
ceased, but the runners had to lean into a strong, chilling wind for
most of the route to the halfway mark.
By then McColgan had only male companions. She reached 5000m in 16-27,
then with the wind behind, and a downhill finish, returned in 16-00.
A 10-mile race in Portsmouth next week, and a further 10,000m in
Coventry a week later, are her immediate goals. Thereafter she heads for
a month at altitude in the Mexican camp used by London winner Dionisio
Ceron as she prepares for Tokyo on November 19.
If the altitude experiment proves successful, former world 10,000m
champion McColgan will use it again before her championship debut at the
marathon next summer, when Atlanta promises sauna humidity.
Though he finished nearly three-and-a-half minutes behind the winner,
Gary Staines, Ngugi's presence took something from the Belgrave man's
victory. Ngugi, who finished just seven seconds ahead of 41-year-old
former London winner Alaister Hutton, confirmed: ''I hope to run my
first marathon in London next April, and qualify for the Olympic
marathon. It was a very big thing here, to begin redeeming my future. I
am not in good shape, but will be by December -- then maybe I can be
world cross-country champion again.'' He is angry at the lost years, and
plans to sue the IAAF for $10m.
Staines won for the second time in three years, in a course record of
28-48, a remarkable achievement in the conditions. Though a former
European 5000m silver medallist on the track, he rarely produces his
best in the summer. An asthmatic, he suffers badly from pollution and
pollen, and does best on roads.
Staines headed a six-man early break, which included Scotland's Chris
Robison, but Staines and Andrew Pearson were clear before 5000m (14-43),
then Staines dropped Pearson with 2min 32sec for the ninth kilometre,
fastest of the race. Results and leading Scots:
Men: 1, G Staines (Belgrave) 28min 48sec; 2, A Pearson (Longwood)

St Mirren 1, Morton 4
MUCH zeal was again shown by St Mirren about the new bureaucratic
fashion to make everything metrical. For the second Saturday they played
a man short. Ten looks neater right enough. In a boisterous game,
however, it didn't add up to a team.
Rougher arithmetic applied. Eleven minus one for more than the last
quarter of the match equalled a couple of goals more for Morton.
Allan McGraw, the Greenock manager, was embarrassed about taking them.
The afternoon had been too much and too little for him. He seemed
saddened by so much success. ''I thought there was too much passion,''
he said.
Certainly, Morton's start was unrestrained. From the kick-off Derek
McInnes found Marco Rajamaki on the left wing . Although his delivery
looked stamped and addressed to Alan Combe in St Mirren's goal, the ball
was only parried for Warren Hawke to post it.
A chronometrist in the press box assured the lapsed time at 25
seconds, a metrical period of sorts.
At the 10-minute mark John Boyd had replied for Saints and Morton
answered back with a high, soft header by Derek Lilley that dropped into
the net gently, like an autumn leaf.
St Mirren supporters who down the years had given their goalkeepers
harsh nicknames could be testing out toothless for the luckless Combe.
Morton were all of a piece. They moved well in all of their parts.
Most conspicuous was the bouncy energy of Lilley and Rajamaki who had
the third goal after St Mirren went down to 10.
A minute from the end the robust Hawke, five goals in three games,
headed in a sweet cross from the lively Derek Collins.
With three Dereks on board there might be a pun about how high Morton
are equipped to hoist themselves. But it was not a game that left room
for being smart. It was tempestuous stuff with full backs dribbling each
other and wingers doing some tricky defending.
St Mirren kept to the hectic tune better for most of the first half.
Much of their promise, though, came from Martin Baker until he was
ordered off. His swinging boot seemed to be aimed mainly at Ayr. But
that view was from the back of the stand and he did not obviously have
any good in his mind.
Referee Eric Martindale issued eight more cautions, five of them to St
Mirren players. Observers were indebted to the match programme for the
nugget that the ref runs across Glasgow in the morning to his work in a
city hospital.
On his Saturday off he also kept well on his toes and up with the
action so closely that he took a couple of bumps.
At first he tried sweet reason on the Renfrewshire gladiators. It was
never a nasty encounter. Just neighbourly, really. The trouble with
yellow cards is that they are like lemon drops. Once you start on them
it is hard to stop.

Dundee 2, Dundee United 3
BURKE'S Peerage, that well-known publisher of all things past leading
to the present, are ready to put into print a ''World Book of
McKinlays''. If you read your scribe's name, you may realise how I came
by that piece of information. Okay, I'll come clean. It was a mailshot.
However, I would suggest politely that if they do not have the name of
McKinlay, William, footballer, Dundee United FC, in this incredible
compilation, then an immediate reprint, suitably corrected, should be
ordered.
Dundee United have been looking for inspiration from someone -- anyone
-- since their adventure in the first division began this season.
McKinlay picked the perfect stage -- a few hundred yards up the road
from home at Dens Park -- made the perfect entrance with a penalty in
the eighth minute, and almost brought the house down after 64 minutes
with a superb volley which came out of nothing. That was what made it so
spectacular.
Of course, there had to be a finale. McKinlay started the move in
midfield 10 minutes later, and was there to finish it off for his hat
trick and a superb victory for United.
There, unfortunately, the Billy McKinlay story must rest for the
moment. The chappie has been the subject of much transfer speculation --
for example Southampton supremo Laurie McMenemy apparently was spotted
in the stand -- because it would seem he is not keen to attend normal
after-match conferences.
Hanging about never has been a McKinlay trait -- he proved that on the
park -- so we'll leave it to United's manager, Billy Kirkwood. ''Billy
McKinlay's got to get a wee mention,'' he severely understated. ''With
all the speculation going about, he's kept his dignity and just got on
with the game.''
Now you're talking.
There's more. ''Playing like that today, he will go a long way to
helping Dundee United get back into the top league. He had an attacking
role behind the front two. Midfield players should get forward, take
responsibility, and hopefully score. I had to do it when I played.''
Kirkwood, not normally one to single out players, did mention the
contributions of Maurice Malpas, keeper Ally Maxwell -- who had at least
two outstanding saves -- and Andy McLaren, of whom he said: ''Andy has a
big future. He's one of the few people nowadays who has the ability to
take people on and beat them.''
In case it has escaped your notice, there was another team who made
this Derby match a cracker in front of what was the second biggest crowd
of the day in Scotland, just under 10,400.
There we have another rising star who must have impressed Mr McMenemy
and any others looking for a few pounds of football flesh. Jim Hamilton
got both Dundee goals, one of them also from a penalty, the other from a
cracking strike. He led the line well, along with a man who, if there
was a bonus for workrate, would break the bank -- George Shaw.
Dundee manager Jim Duffy is concerned about his defence. He said: ''We
played well going forward. Two out of the three departments are doing
well, but we are giving away too many crazy goals.
''Okay, McKinlay's second goal was just one of those situations you
could do little about, and all credit to the guy. But we'll need to
address the problems at the back. It just wasn't to be our day.''
Back to that crowd. Although one lot went down the road happy, no one
should have complained about the entertainment value, nor the onfield
behaviour of the players. There were four bookings, but not for anything
drastic, and Billy Kirkwood probably summed up the day best of all.
''There were 10,000 plus people out there today. They saw a lot of
quality football, and that should be seen in the top division. It was an
ideal argument for a bigger top league.''
The man's name might not be in a Burke's Peerage publication, but it
was a point sincerely and well-made.

Celtic 0, Rangers 2
IT wasn't only the tactical change demanded by Rangers manager Walter
Smith at half time that brought out the best of Paul Gascoigne in the
latest Old Firm clash. There were also words of warning from captain
Richard Gough that helped bring about a change in attitude from the
English mifdielder, and the combination produced the second goal that so
effectively killed any belief of a comenack that Celtic may have
harboured.
Gough admitted: ''I had a word with Paul before we went back out for
the second half and told him not to get himself so involved. He had been
booked, and I told him that if he was in trouble again then he would be
letting down the whole team.
''I know the pressure he was under. People are always trying to wind
him up, especially in an Old Firm game, and I am not criticising Celtic
players when I say that. If it was the other way around then I would be
doing it, too.
''It is all part and parcel of the game. What you have to do is try to
rise above that and, after half time, Paul did that and scored the goal
which was so important for us.''
As well as Gough's important words of wisdom, Gascoigne had also been
told by manager Smith to push forward more, and by doing so he helped
himself to his first Old Firm strike in 56 minutes. By that time Alex
Cleland had already scored for Rangers, and suddenly Celtic were left
facing defeat from their oldest rivals for the second time in 11 days.
It must be a deep psychological blow to the Parkhead men, even though
afterwards their captain, Paul McStay, was reluctant to admit that.
''This is a blow to us, of course,'' he said, ''but we have a long way
to go and this is our first setback in the league.
''We had so much of the play in the first half but could not get a
goal. And in these games you have to be able to take half chances when
they arrive.
''We did not sustain our form throughout the 90 minutes, and that was
disappointing. I thought Paul Gascoigne played well, but we are upset
that we had so much of the game, again, and finished up losing.''
McStay's match analysis is an accurate one. Celtic did have the
territorial advantage yet again, just as they had done in the first
clash between the two Glasgow rivals in the Coca-Cola Cup.
On each occasion, though, Celtic found it almost impossible to break
down the Rangers defence. The first game saw them limited to long-range
goal tries, two of which were superbly stopped by Andy Goram.
This time Goram was tested once early on with a Rudi Vata header after
he had allowed a free kick from Pierre van Hooydonk to squirm from his
grasp, and later from another free kick from the giant Dutchman. Yet the
Ibrox 'keeper was never put under serious examination.
That is an area where Celtic failed. They kept trying to find a way
through the centre of the defence -- and, as manager Tommy Burns pointed
out later, that is where Rangers are at their most powerful.
Celtic's foreign stars, van Hooydonk and the German Andreas Thom,
found that out the hard way. Apart from set pieces they never threatened
the champions, and van Hooydonk, for all his great height, caused not
the slightest flicker of worry in the air.
The three central defenders for Rangers, Gough, Gordan Petric, and
Alan McLaren are maturing as a unit as an understanding grows between
them and, individually, all are enjoying a rich vein of form.
Rangers are back at the top of the league, and Tommy Burns must cast
envious eyes at the spending his counterpart was able to do in the
summmer.
Proper perseverance by the men who hold the purse strings at Parkhead
might have had Petric on the other side at the weekend. But Rangers went
for the deal with a swiftness that left their rival behind and added the
Dundee United man to their already massive shopping list.
While Burns has been able to bring Thom and John Hughes to bolster his
squad, Smith added, as well as Petric, Stephen Wright, Oleg Salenko,
and, of course, most famously Gascoigne.
Burns has maintained since the Thom signing that he still needs
quality players to mount the kind of challenge that will satisfy him and
the thousands of disillusioned supporters who left the ground long
before the end of Saturday's game. The two Old Firm results support his
view.

AFTER an average of one draw only every fortnight, the basement's
derby day produced three of them on the one afternoon.
In fact, everything seems very even -- except for those runaway
leaders, Livingston.
Jim Leishman's men maintained their 100% record with a seventh
straight win, courtesy of the reliable Jason Young's goal after 36
minutes for the only score at Cowdenbeath.
However, going by numbers, the Highland clubs are in a different
league from their fellow cellar-dwellers. A crowd of 3625 -- the eighth
highest in Scotland -- saw Caley Thistle and Ross County share the
points at Inverness, where three red cards kept up the excitement.
Caley struck first through an Alan Hercher header but that was
equalised on the half-hour mark by Jamie MacPherson, who later became
the first for an early bath. He was later joined in the pavilion by
Caley's Graham Bennett and Charlie Christie.
Brechin had to come from behind to draw after Ian Porteous put
Arbroath ahead just 30 seconds after the interval. Jamie McKellar struck
back around the hour mark.
Alloa and East Stirlingshire shared four goals, with the Wasps opening
through Mark Whyte but 'Shire seemed to have turned it around in a
10-minute spell through Iain Lee's penalty and a Martin McBride goal 11
minutes from the close. Willie Newbigging deprived 'Shire of their first
win.
Albion Rovers did gain their first win through a Gordon Young double
and Joe McBride goal after David Arbuckle's strike for Queen's Park in a
lively end to the first half at Cliftonhill.

Motherwell 3, Kilmarnock 0
KILMARNOCK chairman Bob Fleeting threatened to quit the club last week
after being verbally abused by fans, but the Rugby Park manager and
players, who must feel they are being mugged every time they step on to
the field, have no intention of throwing in the towel, despite yet
another flop.
Alex Totten's men are stuck at the foot of the premier division table
without a point and just one goal to show for their efforts over the
first five matches. Breaks are hard to come by, and, according to
central defender Neil Whitworth, morale in the dressing room is low.
Because the club have to pay for the magnificent job they have done in
rebuilding Rugby Park, Totten does not have the money he would like to
bring in a fresh face or two. But Whitworth, who gave away a silly
penalty at Fir Park, is adamant that the current playing staff will
eventually pull things round.
''The lads are really low, especially after today,'' said Whitworth.
''We are all desperate to get a result, but nothing is happening for us
at the moment. Our morale isn't the best at the moment and we are in a
hole.
''But we've got the same players as we had last season when we fought
our way out of trouble. It's up to us all to get together and dig
ourselves out of the hole.''
Manager Totten was in similar mood, saying: ''There is no money for
new players, so all I can do is work with the players I've got. When you
are down there you don't get the breaks and our confidence is down at
the moment, but it's up to me to keep the players heads up, keep them
working and persevering.
''It's not much fun for any of us at the moment, but I have to say
there isn't one player who is giving me less than 100%. We all want to
do well for the club and the fans. This is my livelihood and I want to
keep my job. The players feel the same and, just like last season, we
will have to fight our way out of trouble.''
In a match that seldom climbed above the level of mediocrity,
Kilmarnock gave as good as they got until they lost the first goal. Paul
Lambert did well in holding up the ball until he spotted Tommy Coyne
clear in the box and the striker, who hadn't scored since April, steered
his shot away from the keeper.
Eddie May added a second after 61 minutes when he ran on to a low
cross from Shaun McSkimming at the far post, and Coyne made it three
from the penalty spot after Whitworth had handled a corner from the
right.
It was a thoroughly deserved win for Motherwell, who had drawn their
first four league matches, and a relief for one Fir Park stalwart who is
a bit of a statistician. ''Do you realise,'' he said ''that Dundee
United went down last season with 36 points. If we had continued to draw
every match until the end of the season we could have been relegated.''
No chance, old son. Motherwell will again be competing up at the sharp
end of the table, especially now that Coyne has found his scoring touch.
Said manager Alex McLeish: ''The players deserved that win today. They
showed patience when they needed to, and they showed urgency when it was
needed. After those frustrating draws it all came together.''
Now Motherwell face a buoyant Rangers at Ibrox tomorrow night and
McLeish and his men are looking forward to it. Said the manager:
''Rangers are going great guns at the moment and Ibrox is always a
cauldron, but we have gone there in the past and performed well. We will
be going to Glasgow in a positive mood.''

Partick Thistle 1, Falkirk 1
FIRHILL was a tale of two goalies, one the real thing, the other
co-opted into the multi-coloured jersey. Tony Parks, the last line of
Falkirk's defence, had to go off hurt and, as his team had not brought
along another keeper, it was Stevie Kirk, better known as a scorer than
a saver, who swopped shirts and stood guard for most of the second half.
The real goalie lost a goal, the imitation lost none. Strange old
business, is it not?
Maybe we should expect these bizarre bits and pieces at the home of
the Jags, where life has ever been eccentric and especially when their
manager of recent times, John Lambie, returned to the ground in charge
of the opposition. It was Lambie who did not include a goalkeeping
substitute in his team list, mainly because he is short of staff in that
department and also because he had been told by the players that Kirk
was something of an expert in this regard.
In the end, Lambie was justified. Kirk did fine, Falkirk earned a
point and nobody went home fuming. The entire crowd would have demanded
money back if the form of the first half had not been left behind,
however, a period when the exchanges were drearily predictable and
painfully unproductive. Lambie, naturally, had a more prosaic way of
describing it. ''It was crap,'' he said in that couthy style, ''and so
were we.''
Thankfully, things did get better, although Parks might have something
to say about that. He was in severe pain when he felt a sudden tug in
his hamstring as he raced out to beat a couple of Thistle attackers to a
fine cross by Andy Gibson. ''I thought I was shot in the leg,'' he said.
''And although I did get a hand to the ball, the pain was so bad I could
not stay up, nor could I get off the ground to knock it away.''
The consequence was that the ball broke out to Albert Craig who fairly
hammered it home, despite a brave effort by Jamie McGowan to head it off
the line.
That seemed to give the home lot a big advantage, especially when
Parks, clearly out of commission, had to be carried off and the deputy,
Kirk, took over. It didn't turn out that way as Thistle, inexplicably,
appeared to forget that they were up against a makeshift keeper who,
however able, might have been vulnerable to the odd well placed cross.
There was no sign of Partick being aware of this, no sign that they
wanted to see how good the deputy really was. In fact, tested him only
once, with an Ian Cameron free kick which he held at the second attempt.
''I was a bit lucky with that one.'' said the substitute who recalled
playing for 88 minutes as a deputy keeper for Motherwell at Tynecastle.
''I don't practise playing in goal, but it is something I have always
done with every club I have been at. I was never really under any
pressure.''
Part of the reason for that was the way Falkirk took command of the
midfield, with Derek Ferguson and Steve Fulton very much the playmakers,
aided by Maurice Johnston who did well as an extra midfielder and who
still carries a wee touch of class. Lambie, nonetheless, was critical of
the ball players. ''They wanted too many passes.'' he said, ''There are
times when you have to be more penetrating, not turn around and start
again.''
His team did equalise from the penalty spot after Paul McGrillen was
judged to have been impeded by Steve Welsh, although from our angle
there didn't seem much wrong. Johnston made a sound job of the spot-kick
and Falkirk went on to go very close to snatching a winner.
Their manager is looking for a couple of players and has money to
spend. He did want Richard Cadette, their former striker, but Millwall
asked for #150,000 and that is more than they had paid Falkirk for him.
Until the price comes down, Lambie will sit tight.
He would be familiar with the situation in which his Thistle
successor, Murdo MacLeod, finds himself. ''We have no money to spend,''
said MacLeod. ''And it takes time to set up swop deals.
''Nearly all the squad here is experienced and you don't want to give
away that experience without getting some back.''

Hibs 2, Hearts 2
HIBS, conquerors of Rangers last weekend, had a second successive
victory snatched from them in injury time yesterday.
Back at their own Easter Road stadium, they looked to be heading for
victory over city rivals Hearts when, suddenly, with the referee
allowing the game to move towards two minutes of injury time, John
Robertson struck to claim an equaliser.
That was the final flourish from a dramatic second half which had seen
a determined Hibs fightback, and the ordering off of Tynecastle veteran
Gary Mackay, before Robertson added his own postscript.
That moment of madness from Mackay, after 63 minutes, could have cost
his team their chance of sharing the points.
The game was poised at 1-1 when Mackay was shown the yellow card after
stamping on Gareth Evans as the Hibs player lay on the ground.
Referee Willie Young had no option and so Mackay was sent off for the
second time in a year in an Edinburgh derby.
Last season he went off for two yellow card offences. Yesterday it was
one red card which counted, and one which almost allowed Hibs to win a
match that they had seemed so much out of before half-time.
In that first period, Hearts had dominated, and the Easter Road men,
playing a back three of Gordon Hunter, Andy Millen, and Steven Tweed,
looked uncomfortable against the quick attacking from Alan Lawrence and
John Robertson.
Twice in the opening quarter of an hour the Hibs defence could have
lost goals, once from a Lawrence cross which Brian Hamilton just failed
to reach properly at the far post, and then from a George Wright cross
which Hamilton headed against a post.
Five minutes before half-time, Hearts scored the goal that their
pressure had deserved.
Once more the Hibs' defence looked untidy and disorganised when John
Robertson chipped a ball over the face of the goal from the right hand
side of the penalty box.
There was Dave McPherson at the far post, bending low to direct a
header beyond Jim Leighton and into goal.
At this stage, it was difficult to see how Hibs would recover -- but
with some changes at the back they began to look much more organised.
Graeme Donald came on at the start of the second half in place of Andy
Millen and Graham Love went to the centre of the defence and suddenly
there was a more cohesive look about the side and they began, too, to
throw men forward.
Fifteen minutes after half-time they equalised. Again, the goal was
earned by the amount of pressure Hibs had exerted.
Gareth Evans broke through into the Hearts' penalty box and then fired
a low ball across the goalmouth. Twenty-one-year-old Donald raced on to
the ball and hammered a low angled shot to the far corner of the net.
Now Hearts were up against it -- and their cause was not helped when
Mackay was sent off. Evans had challenged John Millar, who had come on
at half-time in place of Gary Locke. The Hibs' player went down and
Mackay came in looking for retribution, stamped on his opponent, and
went off.
Within nine minutes Hearts felt his loss in the worst possible way.
A long ball out of defence was brought down perfectly by Michael
O'Neill just inside his own half. He flighted the ball forward, beyond
the Hearts' defence, and Keith Wright gathered it before squaring it to
the unmarked Pat McGinlay, who had the easiest of tap-ins to put his
team in front for the first time.
There is no doubt they should have remained there. They had most of
the ball, and the better chances. With just four minutes left, for
example, O'Neill was clear in the box and then mis-kicked and allowed
Hearts to clear the threat.
Then came that late, late goal from Robertson.
Hearts were awarded a free kick from some 30 yards from goal. John
Colquhoun played it forward short and Robertson came from his marker and
headed the ball on. The Hibs' defenders reached it, tried to scramble it
away, but only succeeded in sending it back to the little hitman who
snapped a fierce shot past Leighton to give Hearts a point that they
must have believed, even themselves, that they had lost.
And suddenly it was the visiting fans who sang in the new stand where
they had been sitting silently for so much of the second 45 minutes.
Hibs will see this as an opportunity missed, because they had the
chance of victory, and could have underlined their credentials as
potential championship challengers this season.

IT was about 1.45pm, well before kick-off time, and Celtic Park was
empty apart from groundsmen fussing around on the pitch and the
gathering army of stewards and policemen. The calm before the storm
which would be whipped up by the supporters of Celtic and Rangers who
were about to come together for the second time inside a fortnight.
The fans were already beginning to gather outside the ground, many of
them wondering about one player in particular. Would John Collins,
recently fallen from favour and banished to the reserves, be brought
back by Celtic manager Tommy Burns, or would the midfield player be no
more than a bystander at what could have been his last Old Firm game?
Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson is to see his chairman this week in
an attempt to persuade him to sanction the #3m offer for Collins which
Burns is thought to be seeking.
Perhaps sensing the end of an affair with Celtic, Collins walked alone
on to the pitch and took a good look around. The turf would have felt
good beneath his feet and the vast sweep of the new stand could only
have made him doubt the logic of sport. When eventually completed,
Celtic Park will be one of Britain's most impressive and passionate
arenas, yet Collins is on the verge of leaving.
Asked by an eager radio reporter if his presence meant he would be
playing against Rangers, the Scottish internationalist declined to throw
much light on the matter saying only: ''Could be,'' as he wandered back
towards the tunnel.
However, as he was about to disappear, he glanced up towards the
press-box and offered the first true indication that he would, indeed,
be playing. He made a gesture -- and it wasn't a friendly wave --
towards the box and a quick look over a shoulder made it clear there was
only one press-man in place at the time.
Moi? Could he have been gesturing to me? It was, I suppose, reasonable
to assume this might have been his response to recent observations I had
made on aspects of his game.
Clearly, the criticism was not appreciated and, obviously, Collins was
in the mood to demonstrate how good a player he really is, perhaps with
the added intention of signing off against Rangers with a flourish.
Soon after he had gone back indoors another midfield player appeared
and he, too, wandered around the pitch for a while. ''I get bored
hanging around dressing-rooms so I like to come out and get some fresh
air,'' said Paul Gascoigne, who would cement his relationship with the
Rangers support.
It was, then, very much a tale of two midfield players and Gascoigne
won the contest easily in the end, just as his team triumphed in the
match which ran away from Celtic after Alex Cleland had scored the first
of the Ibrox side's two goals. Celtic's play became even more ragged
and, long before the end, Rangers were cruising towards a win which
convinced their supporters that they will be celebrating an eighth
successive premier-division championship come the end of this season.
The reaction to Collins' reinstatement was mixed, although the
majority of Celtic's fans seemed relieved to see him back in the
midfield alongside Paul McStay, Simon Donnelly, and Phil O'Donnell and
while there should have been enough talent within that group to menace
Rangers, none of these players emerged as a real influence after the
first half-hour.
Eventually, Gascoigne, Ian Ferguson, and Stuart McCall, with Cleland
advancing in support, would dominate, relegating Celtic's opening
flurries to no more than vague memories.
Celtic's front men, Andreas Thom and Pierre van Hooydonk, were never
really in the match and Andy Goram was virtually idle after a couple of
early saves, although it should be said also that Gordon Marshall wasn't
greatly troubled either apart from the goals and a vicious shot from
Cleland four minutes from time.
Gascoigne was booked for a foul on Collins -- the pair tussled several
times -- but the Englishman won the contest and ended the afternoon
pacing before his supporters, who were singing ''there's only one Paul
Gascoigne.'' That is a relief, the world isn't ready for two Gazzas yet.
By way of a stark and dark contrast, Collins made his way from the
pitch head bowed slightly. He left behind many fans wondering if they
had just witnessed his final contribution to the Celtic cause.
Hopefully, we will know the truth soon because his transfer saga is
beginning to become tedious.
It would be better for everyone if the matter was resolved quickly now
and both Celtic and Collins were allowed to move on even if that means
in different directions.
Collins, who decided to have his say in public via television a couple
of weeks ago, accepted his punishment quietly enough and had been
anxious to shine on his return on Saturday, but although he ran and
worked as hard as usual he was unable to influence the game in any
profound way.
Maybe he has overstayed his welcome.

HEARTS' long-serving midfielder Gary Mackay, sent off yesterday in the
Edinburgh derby, will be disciplined by the Tynecastle club. The
31-year-old was red-carded by referee Willie Young after 63 minutes of
yesterday's 2-2 draw at Easter Road.
It was the second time in a year that Mackay had been sent off in an
Edinburgh derby. He walked yesterday after having stamped on Hibs
forward Gareth Evans. Manager Jim Jeffries was forced to admit: ''Some
of us in the dugout thought that Gary had stamped on the player. We will
wait to look at the video of the game, but he will be dealt with by the
club.''
Mackay, who will face an automatic one-game suspension from the SFA,
will be fined by Hearts.
While the midfielder found himself in trouble, his fellow veteran,
John Robertson, was celebrating a very special hat trick.
His late goal -- which arrived in injury time -- gave Hearts a vital
point. It also pushed Robertson's total of league goals level with Tommy
Walker, at 184, and one ahead of Willie Bauld. It was also Robertson's
twenty-second strike in 44 derby games.
He said later: ''It's a nice goal scoring rate for these important
games. I know that if my father was still alive he would be a proud man
today because Willie Bauld was his hero, and now I've gone ahead of him
in league goals for the club.
''I think that we deserved a draw overall. We had the best of it
before half-time and then Hibs controlled things for most of the second
half.
''When the ball came down to me I was only thinking of where I was
going to go to celebrate -- it was the perfect distance for me.''
Thirteen thousand fans were at the new look Easter Road to watch
Hearts go in at half-time leading by a Dave McPherson goal. Afterwards
Hibs scored through substitute Graeme Donald and then went ahead with a
Pat McGinlay goal in the 72 minutes before Robertson denied them
victory.
Angry Hibs manager, Alex Miller, said: ''We had the game won. It was
criminal to lose a goal like that in the closing seconds of the game.''
Hearts remained puzzled by the chalking off of a Dave Winnie ''goal''
after 62 minutes. Referee Willie Young had awarded a free kick before
the ball crossed the line.

The area round a glen where Campbells tread softly has more to offer
than the half-told tale of a murdered people, says Rennie McOwan.
A LOAD of nonsense is talked about stupendous Glen Coe. It is said the
name means the Glen of Weeping whereas no-one nowadays can be sure of
its origin. It is said to be the glen where the Campbells massacred the
MacDonalds (and one of the local pubs has a notice saying jocularly:
''no Campbells served here''), but the killing was done by a regular
unit of the British Army with royal assent. It is true, of course, that
there was a strong Campbell influence.
Glen Coe is the best known glen in Scotland and the spectacular rock
cliffs and buttresses soaring up beside the modern road are truly
impressive. Some visitors look at the upper glen and wonder how on earth
the MacDonalds scratched a living there, but their main townships were
around and in the area of modern Glen Coe village. They had a healthy
life on the whole, herding cattle and borrowing other people's. Boats
came into Loch Leven and Loch Linnie from Scandinavia, France and other
countries. They were not insular.
It is wonderful mountaineering and walking country, including the long
passes through to Glen Etive, the Lairig Eilde (pronounced eel-che,
pass-of-the-hinds) and the Lairig Gartain (a man's name).
The car borne visitor coming from the east can admire the swelling
hills of the Blackmount and then Glen Coe and it is good to turn off a
short way and eat and drink at historic Kingshouse Hotel.
It was known to the cattle drovers of past times when huge herds were
driven from the Highlands and Islands to the great fairs or trysts at
Crieff and then at Falkirk, Stenhousemuir and Reddingmuirhead. Beasts
were resold as far away as Carlisle and Norfolk and much of the roast
beef of old England went south from Scotland.
Kingshouse was also a military barracks, hence the name, and a place
where mail horses were changed.
Keep an eye out in the narrows of the glen for a large, circular cairn
monument on the north side of the road. It puzzles many. It is the
remains of a goal pen which Robert Louis Stevenson had pointed out to
him when he visited the area and when he drew on aspects of the glen for
his novel Kidnapped. It was recycled as a road block during the Second
World War and has now been neatly tidied up into a massive heap.
The waterfall in The Study, in the glen, was probably not the one
which gave Stevenson the idea of Alan Breck and David Balfour leaping
the river. He saw other contenders in Glen Orchy, at the Falls of Leny,
the Branklinn Falls, near Callander, and the Falls of Rogie, near
Strathpeffer. But he did set the scene in Glen Coe.
There are parking bays in the main glen where the travelling people
play the pipes. Some are descended from broken men, the remnants of
clans destroyed in power struggles and they have a deserved place in the
glen.
Take time to scan the huge rock faces. On Aonach Dubh, the Black
Ridge, is a huge gash-cave called Ossian's Cave. Ossian was the bard son
of Fingal, the warrior god of Gaelic mythology and the father of Oscar.
Rock climbers sometimes go up into it, but it is not a pleasant place
with wet walls and a sloping floor. It is a certainty that the Glen Coe
MacDonalds checked it out as a possible refuge and rejected it.
The National Trust for Scotland has a visitor centre in the western
section of the glen which is the subject of controversy because it
breeches the ''natural management'' wishes of the Trust's mountaineering
benefactor, Percy Unna. The centre is to be moved after several years of
public debate and argument to a less obtrusive site. The nearby Clachaig
Inn is a mountaineer's haven.
The best visitor site in this corner is not the Trust's centre, but
the Glen Coe and North Lorn Folk Museum in Glen Coe village. It is not
large, but is packed with interest and staffed by people who really know
their stuff. There is much material about how people lived in the past
and the legends of the area. The booklets on sale, particularly by
Highland scholar Barbara Fairweather, are a joy. Among other exhibits is
the last funeral boat which went to a burial island, off Ballachulish,
dedicated to the Celtic St Findan Munda.
It is pleasant to stroll from this centre up through the village to
see the little monument which commemorates the infamous massacre of
1692.
The huge slate quarries at Ballachulish which opened the year after
the massacre have now been tidied up and there is a handy visitor
information centre there. It is a good place, too, to look back at the
western mouth of Glen Coe and see the prominent Pap of Glen Coe (meaning
breast-shaped) and the route round to Kinlochleven.
It is a hard slog to climb the Pap, but the views are stunning,
particularly to the hills of Ardgour and the coastline round towards
Appin and where Colin Campbell of Glen Ure, the so-called Red Fox, was
shot off his horse in what become known as the Appin Murder.
Who shot Colin Campbell is a long standing mystery which Stevenson
brought into Kidnapped. There is a memorial at the new Ballachulish
Bridge to James-of-the-Glen, the Stewart leader who was hanged for the
killing although he was innocent. There is a cairn in the woods at
Lettermore which marks the murder spot and a handy leaflet to Stevenson
sites in Appin.
Thousands of visitors drive past St Munda's Isle (Eilean Munda) and
its neighbours, just off the Ballachulish shore, and where Camerons,
MacDonalds and Stewarts were buried in past time. Each had their landing
inlet called the Ports of the Dead. The old church on the island was
accidentally set on fire in a brawl. A legend says that the last person
buried there cannot go to the hereafter until there is a new burial so
someone is hingin' on as funerals ended there in the 1950s.
Nearby were two other islands, the Isle of Discussion and the Isle of
Ratification, where clan chiefs held discussions. The islands prevented
them being taken by surprise and the talks format was very civilised.
Finish off with a visit to the aluminium village of Kinlochleven, the
face of the changing Highlands. There is an information display there.
This is fabulous walking country and some folk go up to the Blackwater
Dam built by thousands of Irish and Highland navvies and set amid
glorious Highland scenery. This is the country of Donegal-born Patrick
McGill's faction novel, Children of the Dead End. He was the Robert
Service of the navvy's world.
The glens of the clans have a continuing history.

<HEADLINE>A cautious welcome for new service</HEADLINE>

AMID some allegations of gagging, the British Veterinary Association
appeared to give the thumbs up to the controversial national Meat
Hygiene Service at its congress at Winchester.
But it was pointed out that the 400 veterinary surgeons employed by
the service had signed contracts preventing them from talking about the
service in public or to the media.
A further sign of politics at work was the change in title of the
debate to a simple and less controversial ''Meat Matters''.
Setting the tone for the debate, chairman Colin Maclean, director
general of the Meat and Livestock Commission, said it was wrong to make
an early assessment of whether the MHS, set up in April this year, was a
success or a failure. There was cautious optimism about its operations
although there was room for improvement.
Keith Meldrum, the Ministry of Agriculture's chief veterinary officer,
admitted the service faced a number of challenges, not least the need to
improve its public relations to demonstrate it could deliver. He was
also sure there would be new functions the service would absorb.
In the meantime, the official veterinary surgeons, who had an
unenviable job at meat plants, should be seen as team leaders and
troubleshooters to maintain and improve standards. They also needed to
listen to the wide range of opinions presented and to resolve conflicts.
Vets were primarily concerned by future training opportunities and
potential cost-cutting exercises. Mr Meldrum said the current trimming
was not a cost-cutting exercise per se but had resulted from an overall
examination of manning levels needed to carry out the essential work of
the MHS against established guidelines.
Keith Baker, from the Ministry, pointed out that further improvements
in the service were needed but the meat industry said they would only be
interested if these did not cost more. This was in marked contrast to
other countries such as New Zealand where the industry had supported a
research project involving post mortems on one million sheep.
Colin Maclean said the industry regarded the MHS as a consumer service
with no added value to the meat sector.
Mike Teal, an MHS officer, said he took exception to meat plants
blaming the service for vets for financial problems. ''The industry has
under-invested in the last 20 years in a quite dramatic way. They are
under pressure and for some this is the last straw.
''Martin Cook, chairman of the BVA veterinary public health section,
said there was uncertainty and discontent caused by the lack of
communication. ''But I am fed up with complaints about paperwork and the
calls for a return to the old system with local authorities. The MHS is
here to stay. Let us get on with the job.''
No vote was taken but there was little real dissent from the statement
and Johnston McNeill, MHS chief executive, commented: ''I am encouraged
by the support here today -- it makes a very pleasant change.''

ALAN Cantlay dresses the part when he visits Hector Russell
Kiltmakers' 18 shops throughout Scotland, wearing full Highland regalia.
He also displays, as chairman of the company, the commercial
astuteness of the conventional pin-stripe suit.
Mr Cantlay took over Hector Russell two years ago, and since then has
been quietly restructuring the company which has shops in a number of
locations, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, St Andrews, Inverness,
Aberdeen, Fort William, and Dumfries.
Hector Russell has been selling kilts and tartans which it
manufactures in its Inverness factory since the company was formed in
1949, but under Mr Cantlay's guidance it is becoming more focused.
The group has now opened specialist whisky shops, and already five of
these are in operation, another two are expected to open in the near
future.
Since moving into the company from a small family business based in
the Trossachs, he has had to deal with not only the recession but also
the sharp fall in the tourist trade which supplies most of Hector
Russell's customers.
He is confident that the company has overcome the general downturn,
emerging with a slightly increased annual turnover of almost #6m, and
now confidently looks forward to a period of expansion.
The confidence stems from Hector Russell's takeover in June of the
Seattle-based Scottish Shoppers' Corporation. ''This is a distribution
base into 200 Scottish piping and dancing shops throughout the USA, and
we would hope to sell our kilts, tartans, and Scottish foods through
this distribution network,'' Mr Cantlay explains.
He expects orders from the US to provide work for the company's
kilt-making factory in Inverness, and expects the numbers employed there
to rise from the existing workforce of 25-30.
''We are already trying to recruit kiltmakers,'' he explains, ''as it
takes five years to train a kiltmaker.'' But it is not only export sales
which Mr Cantlay expects to rise, but also the domestic market.
''A very large proportion of Scottish males want to get married in the
kilt, and many ask for a kilt as a gift for their 21st birthday. The
kilt is now fashionable but I don't think it is a fashion which will
pass,'' he says.
Mr Cantlay is still only 31, but he points out that he has been
involved in the retail business since he was 17, and had built up the
family business of Glen Country stores before moving into Hector
Russell.
''Even when I was at university I was still actively involved in the
family business, and by 1993, when I took over this business, we had six
units all based in the Trossachs.''
To escape from the pressures of business he walks the Trossachs hills
and mountains, and believes in keeping himself physically fit. His
knowledge of the area has led him to become a member of the local
tourist board, and he also chairs the Rural Stirling Partnership.

<HEADLINE>Farmers ponder the benefits of paying #10 ecah to get their message acrossto the public. A communications breakdown?</HEADLINE>

IF the Ayr area executive of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland
is at all typical it is going to be an entertaining diversion watching
the national Farmers' Union of Scotland come to a conclusion about its
need to create a public affairs division.
The debate has reached the nitty gritty stage, when members have to
decide if they are prepared to see their subscriptions go up by #10 a
year in order to finance this new department at headquarters.
One speaker at last week's Ayr executive meeting pointed out that the
average subscription was #100 and so a #10 increase was substantial in
percentage terms. Area president John Ross, who had not long since been
telling the meeting what a good year farmers had had in Ayrshire,
responded that farmers had been saying that they wanted public relations
people to represent them.
''If, in a year such as this, they aren't prepared to pay #10 I think
we may as well pack up and go home,'' he said.
He pointed out that the English NFU had spent more than #1m at the
time of the veal crates controversy, trying to get the farmers' case
across. That line of argument very nearly proved an own goal. It opened
the way for the assertion that the NFU's #1m had not been very well
spent -- and if their long-established PR department could not turn the
tide of that argument what hope was there for a much slimmer Scottish
operation having any better chance of success?
It's true, of course, that it isn't always the big PR department that
comes up with the goods. When the National Consumer Council came out
with a call for radical reform of the CAP last week the NFU in London
failed to come up with a response and it was Scottish president John
Ross who put up a spirited defence for the farmers.
That would appear to lend weight to one view put forward to the
executive -- that public relations should be placed firmly at the top of
the union's agenda -- but that it should be the responsibility of
existing staff. ''It's a case of making the ball land at someone's foot
at headquarters, making them responsible for it and telling them to make
it a number one priority -- and to do it within the existing
structure.''
What was not made clear, of course, was what existing services would
be given up so that headquarters staff could be diverted to look after
the public relations side.
What is being considered, after all, is not the appointment of one
person to act as a mouthpiece for the union. In the paper produced by
chief executive Tom Brady, the proposal is for a public affairs division
run by a communications director with a communications assistant. The
director would be responsible for both press and internal communications
and for fulfilling a remit which would include improving the public
image of farming, co-ordinating the industry message when under attack
on food, welfare, or environment issues, improving the farming food and
environment message to schools, improving communication with members,
setting up computer links with area and branch secretaries and
maintaining the momentum on Farm Assurance schemes.
It would be a major development and, like marriage, not something to
be entered into lightly. There could be no room for the suggestion,
which has been made, that a #10 additional subscription could be agreed
for one year and then reviewed at the end of that period. Nobody worth
their salt would accept employment on that basis.
When he presented his paper to the NFUS council, Tom Brady emphasised
the importance of local newspapers in getting the farmers' message over
and that was a point well made for an organisation like the NFUS which
has branches meeting up and down the country.
Each meeting is an opportunity to put over the farmers' side on
current issues and most of these opportunities are probably missed.
The picture of farming as a traditional industry going quietly about
its business in time-honoured fashion is certainly far from the truth
today. It is more likley to be seen as staggering from crisis to crisis.
Animal welfare, use of chemicals, destruction of wildlife habitats, CAP
-- all of these have become sticks used at times to beat the farmer. The
next controversy could be just around the corner.
It appears that the Americans are about to start exporting
hormone-treated beef to Europe under the revised Gatt agreement. The
hope is that it will be clearly labelled so that at least the consumers
will know what they are buying.
''O no, groaned one farmer,'' when he heard that news. ''Meat is just
getting over the BSE scare. Now we'll be back where we started.''
Not necessarily, of course. It could be a golden opportunity to
emphasise the merits of Scottish farm-assured beef.

THE extent of the disaster in the North-east is becoming clearer. It
is awful but even so, wry smiles are reappearing on the faces.
Whereas a fortnight ago all those who were caught in mid-harvest were
in deepest depression, the mood now is more like, ''well we have seen it
all before''.
We haven't, of course, not people my age anyway. But the boys with
what might have been malting barley and those with a lot of wheat which
they had written off, have all been able to salvage something. They have
managed to get perhaps half the crop, which is a disaster for sure, but
even that feels good if you had written it all off.
The trouble is that half the crop doesn't mean half the profit. The
expenses are way up and the wheat which might have made #115 a tonne and
the barley which would have made #150 are being scrambled away for
pig-feed at #60 to #70 a tonne after drying charges.
It's a disaster all right but farmers are so resilient.
Take young Ochyoch. He's in the early stages of a limited partnership
agreement where he does all the work and takes all the risks on his 350
acres, while the landlord would take half the profit if there were any.
He needed a good year. He was well on his way to getting it when they
got 30% of his annual rainfall in 12 days.
He was depressed.
And yet, with everything tidied up at last, he reappeared on Sunday
evening at the discussion group. The smile was back on his face. ''I did
try to come last week, boys,'' he said, ''but I couldna get my bottom
lip in over the car.''
Those of us who were lucky enough to have our harvest in before the
flood are having to keep our heads down. Most of us don't protest when
we are described as ''lucky'' at having got our harvests in in good
order. To point out that luck had nothing to do with it doesn't go down
at all well.
But that doesn't stop one man.
Mossie had all but a few acres of wheat harvested with big yields and
low moistures and that could earn you a scud in the lug about here. But
when one of our agri-businessmen asked him the other day why it was that
Mossie managed to get better yields our man was as quick as a flash:
''Management,'' he replied, without hesitation.
''Oh, no. I don't think that's fair,'' said the agri-businessman,
understandably hurt. ''We had terrible weather this year.''
''Right enough,'' says Mossie. ''Five miles make a helluva difference
weatherwise. And there was me thinkin' you had the same weather as the
rest o' us.''
How he survives is a mystery.
He's been a bit hard on me too. I had 11 of my 12 fields resown again
before the flood. The ground had been far too dry but that didn't last
long.
Now we have some problems with the new crop. The slugs have got at one
of my fields which was in setaside and is now in rape. I got the pellets
on quite quickly so it is nothing like the disaster in 1993 when we had
to redrill a park of rape that was wiped out.
You would have thought I would have learned the lesson I thought I had
learned: ''after setaside you need slugacide''.
And it turns out the rape roots had blocked a drain in a field which
was going into winter barley. That has meant an unsightly mess of large
black patches among the green shoots.
During the drought there was nothing in the drain anyway so I feel I
was unlucky. How was I to know it was blocked? But Mossie still says I
am hopeless. He still doesn't believe in luck.
I am not sure whether he is pulling my leg or not but he was made me
promise to get a graip and a bag of seeds and dig up and scatter the
good seed on the sodden land just to tidy the job up.
It is purely cosmetic for all the patches put together can't be a
quarter of an acre but even that is a fair dig nowadays.
Still, I'll have to do it though I suspect he just wants to appear
with the red Rooster, Crookie and Big Hamish for a laugh. Or perhaps,
he'll bring a camera to show what an antiquated place Little Ardo is.
''There's Charlie with his latest cultivator. It's what we used to call
a graip -- only older.''
I had Mains in the other night with his bill for the year's combining.
He has a nice old-fashioned way of doing business.
He presents his bill in decent time. And he saved the price of a stamp
by delivering it himself.
Those of us who can remember a gentler time would never see a
colleague come to the door on business and leave without a business
dram. There is no way you could grab the bill and shut the door. I have
never tried it but I suspect if I tried to shut the door I would find
there was a foot in it.
It soon becomes clear that Mains is not going to leave without his
cheque and that he has a whole evening free. He is in no hurry.
There being no business dram without business the Breadwinner goes for
the chequebook and I go for the bottle.
Mains has had a good harvest too so we have no embarrassment in
toasting another good year. But Mains is still in no hurry.
I enjoy Mains. He is one of the few young men I know who likes the old
wisdom. And on the third business dram he came out with a piece of
wisdom of his own.
We were agreeing that those who finished early on the night the flood
broke must be kicking themselves for not combining away all night.
''Aye,'' said Mains, ''hindsight may be more accurate but foresight is
a damned sight more use.''

NAMBARRIE tea was introduced into Scotland from Northern Ireland, and
now David McGirr, managing director of distributors Matheson McLaren &amp;
Co, plans to give England the taste for it.
At present Nambarrie sales top two million a year, but although he is
now 61, Mr McGirr has one remaining ambition left, and that is to
achieve five million of annual sales before he retires.
One route to achieving this target is by taking the tea into the north
of England as far down as Manchester. ''We are looking to develop in the
north of England and Manchester,'' he says, ''and one of the major
multiples has now agreed to list it to all their stores in this area.''
Tea may be served in small cups, but it is big business with sales in
Scotland totalling almost 40 million.
Mr McGirr, is proud of the fact that he has brought Nambarrie to third
place in the Scottish market but admits that Typhoo dominates the
marketplace with a more than 50% share.
Matheson McLaren is part of the Twining Tea Group, but fight its own
corner from its Rutherglen headquarters where it has a staff of 20.
Britain is the world's largest importer of tea, and we consume 1355
cups per person per annum but it is facing fierce competition from the
cold drinks sector with colas alone now almost equalling the sale of tea
bags.
''Overall the sale of tea is static,'' explains Mr McGirr, ''but
although the market is not expanding I want to grab a bigger slice.''
He appears to be succeeding in this aim with last year Nambarrie's
sales increasing by 15%, and recently the company's catering division
was awarded the contract to supply tea to all Stakis hotels and casinos
in Scotland.
When he is not selling tea Mr McGirr can usually be found either on
the golf course at Dunblane or polishing his collection of 300 single
malt whiskies.
''I started off several years ago trying to collect a malt from each
of the 118 malt distilleries in Scotland,'' he explains, ''but it
mushroomed and I now have several different vintages of many of the
malts.''
The closure of a number of malt distilleries has meant that some malts
are extremely difficult to obtain which led to Mr McGirr choosing
Sorrento in Italy as a holiday destination because he knew he could
purchase a particular single malt in that area.
Despite being a keen malt whisky collector, he says: ''I get more
pleasure out of selling Nambarrie than I get from my whisky, and I love
my whisky collection.''
Although he only has a golf handicap of 19, Mr McGirr is also enjoying
some success out on the course recently achieving a hole-in-one.

A BIG week for Scottish companies offsets the lack of interest
elsewhere and which will lead to a more active period than usual for
Edinburgh and Glasgow based analysts.
The dominant company is the Bank of Scotland on Wednesday which will
be accompanied by plant hire group Hewden Stuart, mini-conglomerate
Grampian Holdings and specialist spirits group Burn Stewart.
The bank is expected to show bad debt charges falling to #77m from
#119m in the first half of last year to enable pre-tax profits to climb
to #263m (#212m) as the middle of a range from #250m-#280m although the
latest figures will be distorted by a #24m gain on the disposal of the
bank's interest in its associate Halifax Credit Card to Halifax Building
Society.
While the bank has enjoyed relatively strong loan growth, mortgage
profit margins have narrowed, costs will have risen around 8% and last
year's figures included a special dividend from venture capital group
3i.
Shareholders should be able to look forward to a 15% increase in the
interim dividend payout to 2.45p.
However, sentiment towards the stock is dominated much more by what
may be said in addition to earlier statements about the controversial
acquisition of the Bank of Western Australia.
Plant hire and construction equipment group Hewden Stuart may have
enjoyed a 24% leap in earnings in its first half. Increased demand from
the major contractors will have helped taxable profits in the six months
to the end of July rise from #16.2m to #20m. On a longer-term view,
Hewden is not impervious to a slowdown in construction activity, but the
increasing drains on cash being experienced by contractors should lead
to increased use of hire plant and equipment.
Chairman Bill Hughes at Grampian Holdings on the same day should be
able to point to a continuing good performance from the Malcolm
transport business and encouraging prospects for the golf-related
activities. Beady eyes will focus more on the animal health operation
with half time profits of #3.9m (#3.6m) probable.
Scotch whisky prices will be the principal feature of Burn Stewart
Distillers' full-year figures, particularly in the wake of the basically
not too optimistic comments from Guinness last week. The best news that
the industry could hope for would be news of price increases by the new
management team at Whyte &amp; Mackay.
It is this company which has been responsible for keeping the pressure
downward on price over recent years, according to NatWest. Taxable
profits for the year to June are expected to have dipped slightly to
#4.02m from #4.2m
Engineering group Meggitt on Thursday announces interim profits which
are expected to show a 12% decline to #7.6m, according to broker Strauss
Turnbull.
A cold, wet spring followed by a baking summer are expected to have
taken their toll on Austin Reed, the clothes producer and retailer. On
Thursday, pre-tax down a third to #1.2m is expected.
Eurotunnel ends the week with half-year figures which will influence
discussions with its bankers. The Channel tunnel operator recently won a
moratorium on its interest repayments and slashed its duty free prices
in its attempts to compete with the ferries. Broker UBS has pencilled in
losses of #300m. More important will be details of the group's market
share of Channel traffic and future projections as to revenue inwhat is
a nail biting situation for 225 banks.
Light relief may be granted tomorrow as just two days after the
disgraced French striker Eric Cantona made his first appearance for
Manchester United on Sunday after an enforced eight-month absence, his
football club is likely to reveal almost flat annual profits to the
chagrin of manager Alex Ferguson.

THE Scotch Whisky Association is calling upon the Government to
introduce a phased programme of reductions in duty on spirits by cutting
duties by 4% annually until all alcohol excise dutiers are levied at the
same rate according to alcohol content.
However, the SWA is asking that given the weak state of the market,
there should be a kick start to the programme with an initial double cut
of 8%.
The association says that it recognises that a change cannot be
achieved overnight but the Chancellor has to take radical action on a
tax system that has depressed sales in the home market and encouraged
overseas governments to discriminate against scotch as is the case, for
example, with Chile.
To put the matter into context, the duty on scotch in a pub is 29p,
while imported wine bears tax of just 17p and an equivalent amount of
beer, a half pint, carries 15p.

EQUITAS, the Edinburgh-based small business finance specialist, marked
a first full year of activity yesterday by recording its twenty-first
start-up company success.
The firm also announced it has been approved to deliver expertise
under the Scottish Enterprise diagnostic scheme.
This scheme is designed to help companies reduce costs on consultancy
programmes by up to 50%. Equitas has already advised Scottish Enteprise
on biotechnology funding.
Managing director Gavin Don, a former corporate financier with
Hambros, who set up the company said: ''We have worked with companies
from start-ups to a turnover of #5m, completed work to raise more than
#500,000 in funding and are currently working on total fundings of
#900,000.''

ALTHOUGH a spokesman for National Power, Britain's largest privatised
electricity generator, would only say '' no comment'', it is expected
that it will reveal a #2800m agreed bid for Southern Electric this
morning.
It is probable that chairman John Baker will offer around 1025p cash
in what will be a recommended offer compared with Southern's closing
price on Friday of 897p, up 61p in late trading although in relatively
muted volume of just more than 1.2 million shares.
It the offer goes ahead, it will mean that there will be just five of
the original 12 regional electricity distributors still independent or
at least not subject to a takeover approach.
Southern trades in a swathe of territory from south-west London, down
to the south coast and as far west as Somerset.
It had been a possible participant in the bid for its westerly
neighbour Sweb but decided against competing with the Southern Company
utilities group of the US.
If the bid approach is confirmed, the National Power moves come as a
complete reversal of earlier policy.
Only in July did Mr Baker call for the ScottishPower offer for Manweb
to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission but he also said
that he was not interested in acquiring a Rec.
He argued that an MMC was nessary as one of the main objectives of
privatisation was that the English and Welsh eletricity markets should
not have vertically integrated companies as is the case with
ScottishPower which both generates and distributes and also retails
domestic appliances.
But the attitude of Trade Secretary Ian Lang, who has so far nodded
through all the bids to date despite ever louder calls for the whole
matter of concentration in the industry to be fully investigated by the
MMC, has obviously changd Mr Baker's mind.
However, National Power will try to head of accusations of having too
much market weight through being prepared to sell off up to 4000MW of
generating capacity through the disposal of three power stations.
That would reduce its market share south of the border by 20% to about
26% and so then it would be able to argue that it has no monopoly
implications.
It has been suggested that the policy change is due to the increasing
competition in the generating sector with many new entrants and the
desire by some major users to have tied suppliers rather than operate
through the erratic electricty pool pricing system.

AGGREGATES group Bruntcliffe has been able to raise half time taxable
profits by 8[1/2]% to #860,000 on a 27% sales gain to #11.8m.
However, while trading was generally satisfactory, the company which
acquired the Scottish quarrying activities of Tarmac has been hard hit
by the changes in regional government in Grampian which has effectively
led to a hiatus in new building.
As a result, volume sales in the region have tumbled by 43% in an
activity which accounts for about half the UK total by volume and seems
unlikely to show any substantial recovery in the current financial year.
Thistle Aggregates' Craigenlow quarry in Aberdeenshire is benefiting
from past capital expenditure. However the medium term prospects look
better with Bruntcliffe about to ship stone from Ullapool to East Anglia
and also hoping for planning permission to develop a substantial sand
and gravel quarry seven miles from Inverness.
However, UK trading profits eased 8% to #711,000 partly because of th
Grampian problem while in the US there was a 13% reduction in
contribution to #440,00 as a result of price weakness in Pennsylvania
but which has now been reversed.
Chief executive Mike Wallis and Scottish divisional excecutive John
Baxter, both ex-Tarmac, are more confident on the overall pricing front
with the Rugby operation having sold all its current production forward
to Tarmac, RMC and Camas.
Full year profits are expected by brokers Albert E Sharp to improve
from #1.62m to about #2.1m to leave the shares at 22p trading at just
over nine times likely earnings.
The stock is underpinned by the on-going yield of 7.1% and a 30p a
share net asset value -- looks interesting.

WHITBREAD has sold a chain of 137 of its public houses to Pubmaster in
a #12.5m deal as part of its programme of reducing its estate to comply
with the Beer Orders.
The pubs concerned are mainly in the north west of England, the west
country and Kent.
The transaction, the latest in a string of expansion moves for
Pubmaster, comes as the pub operator is being prepared to be float off
from its parent company, the embattled betting and leisure group Brent
Walker.
It is believed that BW is looking for proceeds of about #160m,
although there is the problem that there are a number of pub chains
being lined up for a stock market quotation.
Pubmaster has grown since 1991 to be one of the country's leading pub
operators, alongside Greenalls, and currently has 1700 houses under its
wing.
It was formed four years ago when it owned about 900 pub properties.
It has been able to grow because big brewers such as Whitbread,
Allied, and Bass have been forced to sell under recent legislation.

MEDIA group Pearson would have a value of 900p a share if it were to
be split up, according to broker Henderson Crosthwaite. It reckons the
Financial Times is worth #585m, educational publishing and Penguin books
worth #1480m, the Tussauds side #345m and the Lazards merchant bank
#255m. W H Smith is embarking on price-slashing on books in order to
recapture customers and sales. At 369p the shares remain vulnerable,
sell.
THE OBSERVER
HOUSE of Fraser is labelled a bargain buy after its price slump to
161p compared with the 180p for which it was floated last May. Do not
sell fund manager Gartmore at 262.5p, a full bid is on the cards.
MAIL ON SUNDAY
CARPETRIGHT at 368p is near an all-time high. A profit on the shares
of almost 505 in five months is too tempting to ignore.
INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY
MORRISON Construction, one of the UK's largest privately-owned groups
in the business, makes its market debut at 115p this week. The current
jitters in the market and its sector should see the shares remain steady
for the first few days.

The Scottish traders donned their lucky white heather in their mission
to improve business. Ken Smith, who accompanied them, reports from
Boston on their success rate. . . and a free piece of free advice from
an American lawyer.
HARLAN Doliner is an American lawyer, and unusually for an American
lawyer he was giving his advice for free.
His subject was American businessmen and how their approach to
negotiations were perhaps a little different from their counterparts in
Scotland. The Americans he said, were prone to a little bit of
overstatement, a little more puffing as he put it, in what they could
deliver.
''You may come out of a meeting with an American thinking 'I've got a
done deal with this person' but at the same time he is coming out of the
meeting and all he is thinking is 'Well, this may be a good prospect.'
''
Harlan, a big man in many ways at the Boston law firm of Goldstein &amp;
Manello, was giving the final briefing to two dozen Scottish business
people who were about to be unleashed on the American business
community.
''Remember,'' he warned them. ''There is no deal until documents are
executed.''
He need not have worried. Canny Scots do not believe the deal is done
until the documents are executed, the goods are paid for, and the cheque
is cashed.
They were in Boston on a trade mission organised by the Scottish
Council Development and Industry. They were a mixed industrial bag of
smoked salmon producers, quality knitwear manufacturers, lawyers, human
resource advisers, and engineers. Some were trade mission virgins,
others had been doing business in the States for years, but saw no harm
in seeking out new customers.
But there has been a boom in the trade mission business in recent
years, with numerous bodies organising them. So Industry Minister George
Kynoch accompanied the East Coast mission last week to see for himself
whether they were worthwhile or simply an expensive holiday.
Perhaps the crucial point about a trade mission is the quality of the
people organising the business contacts at the other end. If they can
fix you up with quality contacts instead of time wasters then they are
really doing the business for you.
In Boston, the Scottish Council was dealing with Massport, the
Massachusetts Port Authority. They were given details of the Scottish
companies in advance, circulated them to local businesses, and those who
wanted to meet the Scots were timetabled in for a day of what they call
''matchmaking'' meetings.
So after Harlan's cautionary words the Scots were taken to Boston's
Trade Centre where they were kitted out with a sprig of lucky white
heather, given a table each big enough to seat four, in a large
riverside meeting room, and a timetable of visitors who were scheduled
to come to see them during the day.
The room soon filled up as Americans called in.
Later, at a reception organised at the British Consul-General's
residence in Boston, the Scots discussed the effectiveness of the trade
mission.
Some had done very well indeed from initial contact. A heraldic shield
manufacturer for example had gone out hoping to do business with the
ex-pat Scots community wanting shields of clan crests. But instead he
met an importer who talked about the big business in college plaques for
the ''Class of '95'' and so on who wanted to mark the occasion. He will
now send back samples for what could be significant orders.
The knitwear manufacturers also had some good talks.
Others had not done so well. One company had no one turning up at the
matchmaking sessions. But the company representative was flying on to
other meetings in the United States, so the matchmaking was not the only
focus of her trip.
Another, a gasket manufacturer, discovered that British quality
standards did not count in America, and a whole raft of documentation
would have to be tackled before anyone would contemplate buying
Scottish.
Most firms judged the contacts made as promising. Many had combined
the Boston trip with visits elsewhere to other contacts. British
Airways, who fly direct to Boston from Glasgow, had helped with the
travel arrangements, so the cost of the trade mission was not high -- up
to #750 depending on the number of nights in the hotel.
Almost all the Scots seemed very positive at the end of the trip. All
are realistic enough to know that it can take time after initial
contacts before final orders are made. There is still a lot of hard
follow-up work to be done.
And there is competition. The week before it was a 20-member business
delegation from India who were in town. Next up is a matchmaking session
for businesses from the southern German region of Baden-Wurttenburg.
Then the Peruvians will arrive.
0   But to be positive, the opposition should be seen as a challenge.
Perhaps Scots companies should learn from Harlan Doliner and do a bit
more ''puffing'' about what they can deliver.

MACALLAN-Glenlivet's marketing director Malcolm Watt is leaving the
company after a 2[1/2] year stint ''due to a divergence of views.''
Mr Watt, 48, joined what is seen by many as being the most prestigious
of the independent whisky distillers after eight years in a similar
position at Matthew Gloag, blenders of Highland Distilleries' Famous
Grouse.
It is believed that he will receive compensation of around #140,000,
representing about two years salary on his three year rolling contract
which is still adopted by Macallan.
Managing director Willie Phillips paid tribute to Mr Watt, saying that
there had been a measurable improvement in sales performance but in the
last six months differences had arisen. The decision to part was by
mutual consent.
It will be several weeks before his successor is announced.
The shares are very tightly controlled with Remy Cointreau having
26.3%, partly as a result of the complex deal whereby Highland acquired
its initial stake in the Orpar holding company for the French cognac and
champagne group.
Suntory of Japan has 25.4%, the Prudential 3% while the family with
28% remains the key strategic influence.

ANNE COWAN finds one way of removing the hassle from entertaining
HOW do you take the crisis out of the drama of entertaining? One
solution is to invite guests out instead of in. Possible settings in
which to celebrate a birthday, wedding, christening or any other happy
event include hotels, pubs and clubs, caves, castles, lighthouses, zoos,
historic houses, planes and boats and trains.
The Kronenbourg 1664 Party Venue Guide covers gatherings of less than
50 people, guest lists in excess of 1000 and everything in between.
Costs of hire of premises range from under #100 to more than #1000. Some
venues just charge for food and drinks provided you use in-house
catering. Others allow you to arrange the buffet or meal, but insist
upon providing the bar. If the firm allows you to bring your own
bottles, they may charge corkage.
Details such as flowers, music, and table settings represent a joyful
challenge to some hostesses, an organisational nightmare to others. Will
the management take care of them? How early may the hosts arrive to add
final touches? Who clears up? To research such information for all the
venues in your area is a time-consuming business. The strength of The
Party Venue Guide lies in its depth, nearest railway station, parking,
access to lavatories for disabled guests, child-friendly, and how late
the band can play.
Charlotte Atkins, who compiled the guide, lives in North London and
has two children. A journalist and travel writer (she is travel editor
of Woman's Own), she still finds time for parties. It was while trying
to track down an original and atmospheric venue for her husband's 50th
birthday bash that she realised what an asset a guide book would have
been.
Charlotte Atkins's Scottish suggestions include:
* Balbirnie House Hotel, Markinch
* Barlfour Castle, Orkney
* Blairquhan Castle,
Maybole
* Chatelherault, Hamilton
* Deep Sea World, North
Queensferry
* RRS Discovery, Dundee

A conservationist rationale can improve life for town dwellers: Paul
Welsh previews a major conference which will discuss practical ideas for
eco-villages.
URBAN living can certainly put a damper on family life; traffic stops
children playing outside, poor air quality, lack of green spaces . . .
and the list goes on. But what's the alternative? What can a family do
to improve its situation when living in town is the only option?
A conference opening at the weekend at the Findhorn Foundation,
Scotland's internationally renowned ''alternative'' community on the
Moray Firth, aims to address the problem and develop a practical option
for families who feel they could do better ecologically, economically,
spiritually or culturally.
''Eco-Villages and Sustainable Communities: Models for 21st Century
Living'' is bringing together professionals from 38 countries and a
diverse range of disciplines. The conference is supported by Prince
Charles, who has advocated the idea of ''urban villages'' for a number
of years, and will be attended by luminaries such as Jonathon Porritt,
former director of Friends of the Earth and still a prominent
environmental activist.
''Eco-Villages are human scale, full-featured settlements in which
human activites are harmlessly integrated into the natural world,'' says
Robert Gilman, co-author of the Eco-Village Report, which forms the
basis of the conference. ''This can be done in a way that is supportive
of healthy human development and can continue indefinitely with
success.''
Idealistic, yes, but the conference does not lack a practical edge.
Economists, architects, designers and politicians will rub shoulders
with ''grass roots'' activists during the seven-day event which features
one important new initiative aimed specifically at Scottish households.
The Global Action Play (GAP) workshop will outline a six-month
programme that helps save money in the home and protect the environment
at the same time. A number of pilot schemes supported by local councils
have been tested over the past 18 months and results are encouraging.
Each month, participants receive a GAP Action Pack that concentrates
on a different environmental issue -- shopping, transport or water, for
instance -- and suggests a range of actions from simple ideas for
reducing household waste to more complicated methods for making a home
more energy efficient.
Going further, it suggests how much time to spend on each solution and
explains exactly what impact this has locally and globally. From buying
loose fruit and vegetables to passing toys on to schools, many of the
solutions don't sound earth-shattering and that is precisely why they
are encouraged.
''Ideally, the catalyst for a new GAP community is a local authority
which can subsidise the action packs and provide good resources as
back-up,'' says Trewin Restorick, director of GAP in the UK, the parent
charity partly-formed by the Department of the Environment.
''The involvement of a local authority means volunteers can be
trained, and they support participating families, recruit new households
to the project and co-ordinate GAP locally,'' he says.
Failing that, however, the #10 cost of the GAP membership, including
six monthly packs, is negligible when you consider that pilot households
have achieved an average saving of 10% on water, a 25% reduction in
domestic rubbish and 8% in fuel consumption during the trial period.
Translated into financial reward that means a #50 saving to the
average family of four, over the course of a year, and among other
things, fewer cars on the road and lower levels of pollution.
In addition, the packs also include educational games for children,
posters and saving vouchers for environmentally-friendly household
goods, including energy-efficient ''long-life'' light bulbs and home
compost kits. Three thousand households in England and Wales are already
involved in the scheme, and the organisers say the number is growing by
50 every week.
The scope of the conference itself, however, still goes well beyond
environmental issues. Joing co-ordinator, John Talbott, believes the
worldwide Eco-Village movement is uncovering a ''blueprint'' for a
sustainable human community that encompasses the best of village life,
but is still applicable in large-scale urban settlements.
''The first priority is to develop a sense of belonging and this can
be based on any activity, whether it is establishing a recycling project
or simply knocking on a neighbour's door,'' he says.
This is often what is missing in city life and something an initiative
like GAP can influence. Once someone has got the ball rolling, the
potential is there for a rich, fulfilling life at every level.''

HELEN Lederer gives me a specific insight, she with the face that
launched a thousand milk cartons, the cheery grin that chuckled her way
through five series of Naked Video, the eyes that on the screen appear
to spin out in every direction, though in real life settle down quite
normally. It is that celebrities really do have to work hard at being
seen to be cool.
If you're in the public eye, if image and appearances count for
everything, you can't be seen just to hang about on street corners. You
must be busy, active, go-getting, wanted, desirable, interesting.
So here I am sitting opposite Helen Lederer and frankly she's
panicking. She's drifted into Edinburgh's George Hotel at just the right
time for me to have arrived there first to greet her, and she is
delighted at the attentions of a photographer -- not because she's vain,
but because it makes her look like someone important.
But an all-important TV company meeting has been delayed by an hour
and a half, which means that unless I extend my interview with her to
fill in the gap, she is going to be left hanging around looking uncool
in what's probably the most high-pressure TV environment in the country.
Lederer tells me that in the kind of business meeting I'm about to
leave her to she would never talk about her daughter -- the
five-year-old Hannah who she has brought up alone since her marriage
broke up when the child was just a baby.
It would be seen as a sign of weakness, of distraction of a life not
wholly committed to the cause of work, and it seems wiser not to mention
it at all.
This is an experience shared by working mothers in all walks of life
-- the idea that they should be embarrassed not nourished by their
family, but for the single parent -- and Lederer points out there are
1.4 million in the UK -- such prejudices are all the more keenly felt.
Her book, Single Minding (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, #9.99) which has just
been published is a light hearted attempt at reflecting the experience
of lone parents and at presenting their lives as normal.
It's no piece of polemical tub-thumping (it was, after all, the
publisher's idea not hers and it's comical enough for her to be working
on a spin-off stand-up show for next year), but it is driven by a
genuine desire to set the record straight about a still stigmatised way
of life.
''There's so much criticism and accountability just from doing what
everybody does,'' she says. ''I mean it's not very difficult to have
children, so I haven't done anything strange or remarkable but society
gets a bit uptight about it if you do it in a different way.
''My book is just being funny about a social fact and about things
that people get very nervous about. There is a chapter on barbecues for
example, because the barbecue represents normality and to have a single
person going into a barbecue is an interesting phenomenon.''
But while things can be socially awkward, Lederer resists the idea
that she should be seen as a weeping and wailing victim struggling
against adversity.
Rather, the experience of motherhood, and lone parenting in
particular, has encouraged Lederer to take a step back from showbusiness
competitiveness, something she says is felt acutely by female comedians
in a male dominated industry.
''I just felt there was no space to waste time on thoughts that are
not going to get you anywhere,'' she says. ''It's the same with being
divorced. I just thought I mustn't let my thoughts go down this negative
route, because I need all the energy I can get for the rest of it. It's
just pragmatism.''
Pragmatism does also mean, however, that she has had to sacrifice
career opportunities, like the two tours she was offered and turned down
but she refuses to be bitter or resentful about it. She is more than
happy to be a mother and can nearly always find solutions to practical
problems.
She is part of a ''nanny share'' scheme, for example -- ''You look
after someone else's child in return for them looking after yours'' -- a
system that allows her a fair degree of flexibility even if it means
fitting in with someone else's arrangements.
''I think the nuclear family is a good system but there are other
systems that can thrive -- and why do people get so upset about other
systems?
''I have been funny about a fact of life and I'm not going to take on
board hysteria. People are becoming very hysterical about violence and
videos and single parents.
''If there was a war we wouldn't be discussing those things but
there's a space at the moment and that's the issue of the day and it
doesn't make any sense at all.''

Britain's social tapestry is woven from many different threads these
days. Here Jennifer Cunningham looks at the problems of families who
have adopted children, while entertainer Helen Lederer tells Mark Fisher
of life as a single parent.
ADOPTIVE parents radiate a warmth combined with commonsense. They are
copers. Only when they gather together in large numbers, as they did in
Glasgow at the weekend for the annual meeting of Parent to Parent
Information on Adoption Services, does the full story of what we are
asking them to do emerge. It does not make easy listening.
For more than 20 years, adoption has moved from matching childless
couples with the babies of unmarried teenagers, to finding homes for
''difficult to place'' children.
What has only just become clear is that it is not only children who
have been physically and sexually abused who are damaged, and that love
and committee parenting alone cannot undo that damage.
Among others like themselves, these parents are free to reveal the
horrors of their daily lives: not just the crockery smashed in anger,
but televisions kicked in, the three-hour temper tantrums from
teenagers, children who bite their parents, stealing, and a cruelty
which resulted in a kitten being put in a microwave which, to the
obvious relief of the audience, that child could not remember how to
operate.
Increasing breakdown of adoption placements and demand for support for
beleaguered families has brought some research and understanding of the
problem. According to parents, however, blame is still laid firmly at
their door by the agencies they turn to for help, social workers,
schools, and the police.
Kathy Moss has heard it all before. She heads a specialist unit to
treat such children in Cleveland, Ohio, where these difficulties have
been diagnosed as attachment disorder, a failure to relate to other
people caused by a disruption of the natural process of infant
development.
When the first needs for food, care, and love are met the child learns
to trust adults and form relationships. When the child is cold, hungry,
and neglected, their development is stuck in the raging
crying-for-attention mode. And when they are sometimes cared for,
sometimes struck or abused, a survival mechanism kicks in which makes
them suspicous of everything.
As a social worker who had placed older children with families who
kept returning with difficulties, she realised she was spending all her
time dealing with post-adoption problems instead of her alloted task of
placing others.
After having two children of her own and adopting two others, a baby
boy from Vietnam and an older girl with foetal alcohol syndrome, she
returned for post graduate study. ''I guess I was looking for answers. I
couldn't understand why the girl with supposedly greater problems was
getting on so much better than the boy,'' she said.
She knows now that the damage was done in the first 10 months of his
life, spent in a hospital cot, cared for by staff with so many children
to look after they could do little more than give bottles and change
nappies.
''When we picked him up at the airport, he arched his back away from
me and he continued to resist being held. If I knew then what I know
now, I would have held on to him. We should be giving all adoptive
parents that vital piece of advice: hang on to these kids when they want
to get down,'' she added.
Among the many intervention techniques, she and her colleagues at the
Beech Brook and Centre in Cleveland use is holding. Holding therapy is
an intense two-week regime where the parents hold the child in a loving
but inescapable manner. It is tried only after every other avenue, such
as intensive family support, art, music, and drama therapy. The idea is
to replace the physical bonding which was missing after birth -- and
many of the children regress briefly to states of wanting to be bottle
fed and wrapped in a blanket.
At the end, according to Moss, the hyper-alert, suspicious stare which
characterises such children has been softened to a normal gaze.
It is a fairly desperate measure for desperate cases. Some of the
sessions provoke noisy protest from the child. Video recordings shown by
Kathy Moss and Mershona Parshall, a psycho-therapist who has specialised
in the technique during their visit to the UK, has been more disturbing
to British audiences than American ones, said Moss.
Both believe that holding time, a less intense version carried out by
parents at home, is a valuable technique providing they are prepared to
see it through since giving up half-way is even more damaging.
There was clear anger at the meeting that the social welfare system in
the UK was failing both these children and the adoptive families who are
expected to pick up the pieces without such specialist support.
''When I read about some youngsters who have committed murder, my
first reaction is to wonder what happened to him in the first two years
of his life. The authorities have not yet grasped that what they do at
that stage and during our kids' childhoods, is going to save them so
much later on,'' said Moss.
Many parents whose adopted children are now adults and still looking
for support to deal with problems which include pregnancy and crime,
echoed her words.
This is a dimension the welfare debate has yet to begin to think
about. Tinkering with child benefits is mere camouflage for a desperate,
daily problem. The babies being put up for adoption now have flattened
heads from banging against their cots for attention. Angry parents
received applause for stating what everyone clearly believed: ''It is
seen as an adoption problem, but adoption is the only answer. Our kids
need us, because no-one else will have them.''

THE historic medieval parish church of St Mary's in Haddington often
features concerts in its range of activities, but this weekend brought a
new departure when BBC Scotland utilised the church for the first time.
Its Music Weekend offered three concerts, with the BBC Scottish Symphony
Orchestra's appearance on Sunday night preceded by two recitals on
Saturday, with all three being recorded for future broadcast.
I suspect the sound captured on tape will be beautifully crystalline,
but in the church itself it was a little more problematic at times from
the pews. In the lunchtime recital, mezzo-soprano Sandra Porter's voice
was a little overwhelmed by the scale of the acoustic space around her,
while the piano in both concerts lacked the final edge of sonic clarity
and sharpness.
Porter was accompanied by Graeme McNaught in their recital, but
describing his role as accompanist does scant justice to the way this
pair work as a genuine partnership. Porter has a finely focused voice
and admirably secure delivery, while her vocal timbre and colouration
lies on the lighter side of the mezzo spectrum.
They chose an imaginative programme, with Thomas Wilson's The Willow
Branches, a song cycle based on ancient Chinese texts, as the
centrepiece. Its overall reflective mood is balanced by an underlying
tension, and even desperation, which erupts to the surface on occasion
in both the singing and the darting flurries of the piano.
It was framed by Samuel Barber's Four Songs, Op 13, in which they
conveyed his typical fusion of intrinsic romanticism and American
pragmatism with fine judgment, and Schumann's rather stodgy settings of
five songs by Burns. Three of Erik Satie's quirky comic songs and the
more substantial, chanson-derived Je Te Veux rounded out a pleasing
recital.
The weather had turned wet and nasty by the time of Nikolai
Demidenko's evening recital, which rather detracted from the charm of
the church's lovely riverside setting. The pianist chose a programme
largely made up of works from the turn of the eighteenth century, but
the rather dark intensity of his conception is probably not heard to
greatest advantage in them.
That is not to say he did not play them well, but he sounded like a
late Romantic specialist throughout. That was betrayed in small but
telling ways, as in his tendency to overuse the pedals in Clementi (the
Sonata Op 24, No 2, with its Magic Flute-like main theme) and Field (his
two-movement Sonata No 4, with a Nocturne in E-flat interpolated between
the movements), or his slightly too weighty, overly intense touch on the
three Chopin Nocturnes he played, which lacked the luminous quality
others have found in them.
His fingering was dazzlingly sure on the passages of virtuoso
showpiece writing in all of these works, however, and he tackled the
closing piece, Weber's Sonata No 2, with genuine, attention-grabbing
relish, and added a little Schumann by way of encore.

Stirling has not been noted as a centre of artistic excellence, but
Clare Henry finds Elspeth King is just the person to put it on the map
IS Stirling a cultural desert? If so, can things change? One look at
the really superb exhibition, Patrons &amp; Painters, at Stirling's Smith
Gallery till November 5, proves anything's possible.
Elspeth King, former supremo at the People's Palace, now director of
the Smith, is addressing the challenge head on. Her plans are
predictably ambitious, and will be presented at a public meeting there
at 7.30pm on Thursday. She is determined to make the gallery ''a centre
of excellence; a major visitor destination as good as the castle''. Her
upbeat slogan is ''You've not seen Stirling till you've seen the
Smith!''
Plans include an extension (designed by the original architect in
1874), upgrading the building inside and out, commissioning art and
sculpture, and changing the crazy, outdated policy which bans buying art
made after 1930. ''We're going for Lottery cash with a great bid and
help from Stirling Initiative and Forth Valley Enterprise. About #3m
should do it!'' she says.
King took on the gallery last April. The Smith has a record of ups and
downs. In the early 1980s it was threatened with demolition to make way
for a car park. That battle won, it went on to establish a name for
artistic enterprise (Scottish Amicable's Smith Biennial and Matilda
Mitchell's Friends were high points) before again slipping.
Meanwhile, Stirling's MacRobert Centre and Art Gallery (which got off
to a well-financed flying start in the 1970s with great exhibitions like
Penrose's Surrealism and J D Fergusson) also fell on hard times.
Currently minus a gallery curator, its present shows -- Edward Summerton
and the Scottish Sculpture Open (to December 9) -- have suffered,
lacking the fanfare opening necessary to attract viewers to this
out-of-town university campus.
Geographically midway twixt Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, and Perth,
Stirling should be an ideal spot, and King is just the person to put it
on the map. Her next show, Stirling's Story and the Jacobites, features
''fabulous stuff from the store never seen before''. Meanwhile Patron &amp;
Painters takes advantage of Stirling's location by inviting young Dundee
and Glasgow artists to exhibit -- and sell -- alongside top-notch
artists collected by local businessman John Rae.
Rae shows just what miracles can be achieved from scratch in five
years. And he is keen to encourage others in his new-found passion. Rae
took to art in a big way during 1990, Glasgow's year as European City of
Culture. ''Till then I'd been collecting traditional stuff, but I got
bitten by the New Scottish Art bug.'' A fast mover, he rapidly amassed a
stunning collection by luminaries like Howson, McDonald, Banks,
Mulholland, and Macpherson. ''I just buy what I like, as long as it's
Scottish. You should help the local economy if possible. Some folk are
frightened by modern art. That's nonsense. With so much variety, there's
something for everyone.''
Right from the start Rae's purchases have been courageous -- even
outrageous. Big, bold, often with an uncomfortable edge, despite the
fact he buys for his own home, Rae always chose with an eye for
excellence, never for decoration. Howson's oils of Barlinnie Boys
running wild emit an electric charge, while Craig Mulholland's Royal
Infirmary glowers ominously. Two brilliant large nudes by Jenny Saville
and Paul McPhail were commissioned long before the artists attained
international stardom, pre-empting both the National Galleries and
Glasgow Museums.
Rae is involved with the Princes Youth Business Trust so has combined
his love of art with fund raising. Young artists, generous as ever, are
giving 25% to the Princes Trust, despite the fact that with recent
despicable government cuts (30% in three years) most must take out loans
to supplement their ever diminishing grants. It's a wicked, topsy-turvey
world when students are asked to live on #26 a week (top 1995 grants are
#1820, or #1390 if living at home) while income support has risen to
#36.80 plus Housing Benefit -- which students don't get. The Princes
Trust sees the results of graduates average #6000 debt to the
Government's Student Loans Company, a debt which is predicted to rise as
grants are cut next year.
Patron &amp; Painters is beautifully presented. Rae's 50 pictures lead
straight into 90 bargains by the well-established Steve Campbell, Lesley
Banks, Jim McDonald, Carol Moore, and Jim Tweedie. Don't miss Richmond's
Dillion, Harper's Desire, Whyte's #500 Intimate Gesture, Telford's Sewn
Cloth, Faulkner's #450 heads, Gilbert's Fool, McIntyre's nudes,
McGregor's Glenbrook, Kay's Containment, Cook's #95 Golda, Black's #75
drawing, Waugh's icy landscape, and Jeffrey's pretty children. All for
sale.
Coincidentally Edward Summerton, at the MacRobert till Saturday, first
caught my eye as a student when I judged the Smith Biennial in 1983. We
gave him first prize. He has not disappointed. His imaginary world of
relics embedded in ice speaks of isolation and endurance, both physical
and spiritual. Boldly painted pagan and Christian totems imply modern
ritual built around age-old basics: cloth, fish, knife, leaf. ''His
personal vocabulary uses the clarity of Magritte and the mystery of De
Chirico together with his own visual poetry and humour,'' says Professor
Will Maclean. Praise indeed. His oils are cheap. Rae and the rest of you
should buy.
The 8th Scottish Sculpture Open is more ''open'' than ever this year
with artists from the UK and abroad. After its usual premier in
Aberdeen's Kildrummy Castle, Stirling University campus is its
''southern'' venue, a park long under-used and begging for sculpture.
This should be encouraging, but sadly, overall has produced a
lacklustre display, with too much mundane work among the 14 sculptures
scattered round the lake.
Among the best, two pieces stem from artists invited to Lumsden's
Granite Carving Symposium: Swede Bjorn Fjellstrom's polished Point T-36
is really beautiful and the construction by Japanese artist, Mashiba
works well. Artists' statements help. Iain McColl's vivid description of
the inspiration behind his three black, scarey, 15ft-high Fish Head Gang
is memorable. As official assistant war artist to Bosnia (and about to
return there with Edinburgh Direct Aid) he translates the cocktail of
fear he endured from the ruthless, drug-soaked bandits who terrorise
convoys between Split and Vitez with violence, torture, and even
execution.
Pete Bevan's Gazebo is a seriously innovative, elegant, and unique
redefinition of sculpture, while Diane Maclean's giant shoe, with its
hints of medieval tower, moat, and bridge, has a nice light touch. I
also enjoyed Charles Poulsen's expert subversion of soft pillows and
hard concrete which reminds me of Anne Bevan's work.
McColl has generously given a picture to support Tod Garner's new
ceramics gallery which opened this weekend in Glasgow's Parnie Street.
Meanwhile, Edinburgh Direct Aid plans a fund-raising art exhibition next
month.
There was a time when farmers, shipyard, and steel workers were ''the
salt of the earth'. In post-industrial society it's often artists who
work long and hard in back-breaking conditions contributing energy,
craftsmanship and skills, helping the sick, the poor, mentally ill --
even the Bosnian war effort. Glasgow has reinvented itself on the back
of culture. A strange but true late twentieth-century turnaround.

Theatre
THERE is something bewitching about A Little Night Music, Stephen
Sondheim's sexually charged, musical-chairs response to Ingmar Bergman's
Smiles Of A Summer Night film -- a fragility that leaves you thinking
you're not quite sure what you have seen. More like a waking dream, it
is, perhaps, exactly how some of the characters must have felt at the
end of this long Scandinavian summer night of changing realities and
rites of passage.
Sondheim's music is the key. Out of the tones of discordancy
(exacerbated by some odd orchestrations by Jonathan Runick and musical
direction from the normally inspired Paddy Cuneen that feels
unnecessarily laboured) those strangely adapted waltz times and the
still astoundingly beautiful Send in the Clowns create a climate of
exquisite, ethereal pathos. The latter, especially, though hummed
through the length and breadth of the land, in Judi Dench's hands
becomes entirely new-minted -- a bitter-sweet hymn, perfectly rendered,
to the agony and farce of middle-aged love, rueful with grief and
self-mockery.
Not that Sean Mathias's National revival is quite so fortunate in
other departments. The sheer size and technological wizardry of the
Olivier stage does the piece no favours, diffusing its impact,
distorting the concentration.
But when it begins to come together, and the various amorous
entanglements of young and old alike begin to bubble, the enchantment
becomes irresistible. Joanna Riding (Julie in the NT's Carousel) and
newcomer Brendan O'Hea -- the one sexually reticent, the other
tormentedly frustrated -- lead the charge on the senses. But it is the
trio of Sian Phillips, Patricia Hodge, and Judi Dench -- seasoned stars
all -- which makes this so outstanding an experience and compulsory
viewing for all Sondheim fans.

ONE of the things that Dundee Rep's artistic director, Hamish Glen,
has always been good at is giving second airings to recent Scottish
successes. It shouldn't seem such a remarkable thing to do, but in
reality you're much more likely to see another Oscar Wilde or Noel
Coward than a play that caused a stir only four or five years ago.
Anne Downie's adaptation of Jesse Kesson's novel of a deprived
Aberdeenshire childhood is one such play, here being given only its
third professional production in 10 years. Seeing it for the first time,
post-Bondagers, post-Steamie, post-Guid Sisters, it seems to fit in well
with the strand of big, honest, female-oriented plays at which Scottish
theatre has excelled in recent years.
True, as an adaptation its structure is a little loose for the stage,
but its rich, poetic language, its portrayal of a close-knit community,
and its story about separation, loneliness, and loss are all things that
can work compellingly in a theatre.
Directed by James Robert Carson, this is a good-looking production,
moodily lit by Neil Goodwill and imaginatively designed by George
Souglides whose set cleverly straddles the real and the abstract, even
if it is sometimes over-emphatic (someone mentions a ball -- and a ball
appears; a dress -- and look, there's a dress) and it does miss the
sense of tenement claustrophobia.
The first act is hard to pin down, somehow too noisy, uptight, and
uncertainly focused, but it finds its emotional stride in the second,
thanks in no small measure to a lovely, warm, and lively central
performance by newcomer Caroline Devlin. And by the end it feels like a
rounded, satisfying production.

THE elves at the bottom of Julian Cope's garden are hopping mad, and
not only on account of the noise. They reckon he's been tampering with
their dandelion and burdock. Some even report seeing spaceships. They
are glad he's away on tour, and so are we.
Julian's idea of a night out is to play what many regard as a full
set, then rest the band for 45 minutes while holding the stage with as
many songs as he can remember, plus a few scatty poems.
He brings back the band for another hour, surfing straight into the
encore, because he can't be arsed to leave the stage. If, towards the
end of the third hour, one's delighted grin becomes a little frozen,
it's because you can have too much of a good thing, although a stomping
Reward is just that.
So how does this -- not blend exactly, more random explosion -- of
whimsy, angst, laughter, and thundering epic psychodelia, with its links
to the late sixties Underground, relate to the robotic nineties?
Precisely as an answer to the spreadsheet culture. Here is a camp,
lanky, elf king in electric tights and high floppy hat, striking
mock-heroic poses, flashing his beautiful superstar smile, and
descending startlingly into the audience to embrace and bestow cases.
And when he rocks, his synthesisers do not thump like constipated
metro-gnomes. No, Captain, they go whee and whoosh, which is the best
way to achieve the perfect liftoff.

SPACE to work -- basically, the time and a place to develop ideas --
was, as expected, a main topic at last week's Tramway discussion on
dance directions in the city.
It was particularly appropriate, therefore, to have the week end with
a double bill at CCA showing work that had resulted from residencies at
the centre. The past fortnight has seen Arlette George and a company of
three -- Brigid McCarthy, Michaela Rowan, and Vanessa Smith -- exploring
aspects of step dance and waulkin' songs with no predetermined outcome
in mind, just an enthusiastic curiosity about the sounds, the rhythms,
and the moves.
The sequences presented as ''work in progress'' juxtaposed pattern
bursts of step dance, with the different dynamics of contemporary
movement and an intriguing section danced on bubble wrap, which popped
merrily underfoot like bladderwrack on the shore. In all, a marvellous
concoction of textures: silence, and rhythmic clattering, fragments of
mouth-music (from Michaela) and dance that encompassed both tradition
and innovation.
Terminal Wanderlust -- devised and performed by dancers Ruby Worth and
Annis Joslin and composer Isa Suarez -- was completed during a residency
at CCA in March and subsequently shown on the Edinburgh Fringe. The long
tunnel-feel of PS 2 upstairs (and Bob Pringle's sympathetic lighting)
really enhance the look of this piece about inner restlessness and the
activity of travelling.

BY the time she appeared last night, in the second half of the opening
concert of the City of Glasgow Philharmonic's new season, Carol Kidd was
sorely needed to revivify a show that was earthbound, shot through with
arrangements of everything from West Side Story to MacArthur Park: all
of it -- conducted by Adrian Drover -- stodgy and stubbornly resistant
to any feeling of relaxed swing.
Kidd transformed the evening -- including the sound of the orchestra,
which had been subject to some dodgy amplification. With the resources
of a full symphony orchestra at her disposal (though the heavy brass was
saved till late on) she concentrated on what she does best. Ballads; a
stream of them -- I Can't Get Started, This Bitter Earth, I Think it's
Gonna Rain, Send in the Clowns, a Judy Garland medley.
On and on she went, with an embarrassment of riches, almost flawless
in her breath control, super-articulate with a lyric, and in absolute
control of a melodic line -- when she soars, effortlessly, into the
stratosphere, her voice gleams like silver. Variously accompanied by the
orchestra (strings at last with a touch of opulence, and a cushion of
trombone sound) and her own trio, Carol Kidd made and saved the show.
There was one striking feature that should be noted: the playing of
pianist Brian Kellock. It may be common knowledge in jazz circles -- so
forgive me for stating the obvious -- but in his accompaniments to Carol
Kidd's pristine ballad singing, Kellock is supreme. He has a clarity of
line that exactly matches hers. His playing is light, fluid, and -- like
the singer -- he never loses the line. In combination they are
matchless. Superb.

THIS is where it could go wrong for Jarvis Cocker and his Pulp
cohorts. Having crafted remarkable art from his unremarkable lifetime as
a perennially disaffected odd-bod, Jarvis has become fashionable, adored
by the very folk who would hitherto have despised his consumptive's
frame, maroon slacks and pink slim-jim ties. How will Jarvis cope with
people taking him seriously?
Judging by the evidence of last night's newer, post-fame songs, he'll
cope OK. Gimme them crucial high-camp couplets, Jarvis! ''I really love
it when you tell me to stop/Oh, it's turning me on'' and ''I've kissed
you mother twice/Now I'm working on your dad.'' Jarvis remains wholly
improper, like a Sunday-school teacher suddenly overcome by satyriasis
during communion.
He's plainly unseduced by mindless teenage adulation. ''I know your
mother,'' he deadpanned to one young worshipper in last night's
front-row throng.
Another admirer threw him her silver lurex scarf. ''I'm sure that
keeps you ever so warm,'' Jarvis said tartly in tones recalling Alan
Bennett's.
Reminiscence has been a big part of Pulp's success to date. Their
sound hymns the bygone glam-rock days of Roxy Music and Sparks.
Moreover, big hits like Babies and Do You Remember The First Time lean
heavily on Jarvis's adolescent past.
So it's reassuring that another new song, I Spy, from Pulp's
forthcoming album, attempts to break from what could become a
constricting formula. I Spy's sound is denser, while Jarvis adopts a
non-Jarvis persona, too. Worryingly, though, last night's young audience
mis-interpreted Pulp's anti-drugs song, Sorted For E's and Whizz. Aim
for their mothers, Jarvis, chuck.

FRONTIERS OF COMPLEXITY: the search for order in a chaotic world
By Peter Coveney and Roger Highfield
Faber &amp; Faber: #18.99
''THE Universe is not only queerer than we imagine, but queerer than
we could imagine.'' These words of Albert Einstein were not simply an
admission of how little science knew in his lifetime, but have proved to
be prophetic. Since Einstein's death in 1955, science has undergone a
seachange.
The prevailing approach when he spoke was reductionist -- the way of
explaining the whole world in terms of its parts. At its most extreme it
reduces activity to interactions between atoms. Or genes, if you want to
describe forms of life.
But what happens when the atoms themselves dissolve into sub-atomic
particles which in turn are reduced to even smaller theoretical
particles called quarks? If the quarks cannot be seen or isolated or
proved, then the ever-so-certain framework of physics begins to look
like a mirage. Having dissected Humpty Dumpty into a series of
specialisms and defined him in terms of physics, chemistry, and biology,
scientists have begun to find that the truth about Humpty is a lot
queerer than they realised.
This book is an attempt to put Humpty together again and to prove that
he is a lot greater than the sum of his parts and not, as one scientist
put it, ''When you get down to it the human body is just a few dollars
worth of chemicals''.
The authors, a Cambridge research fellow and the science editor of the
Daily Telegraph, are scornful of the mindless simplicity and the zealous
faith which scientists of the past half century have placed in
reductionist techniques. Yet they do not underestimate the profound
effect that reductionist techniques have had on our way of explaining
the natural world.
A mother whose son dies from cancer will be tempted by various
alluring theories of a reductionist nature.
Was it the artificial colouring in his favourite orange juice which
proved cancerogenic? Was it the effect of the HT electric cable running
above their home? Was it the cigarette smoke he inhaled? Or a defective
gene which ran in the family?
Any and all of these are held out as rational explanations which
depend on reductionist approaches.
The Coveney/Highfield approach is to suggest the alternative notion of
complexity. They define it as ''the study of the behaviour of
macroscopic collections of such units that are endowed with the
potential to evolve in time''. It is a holistic perspective which
enables insights to be made into difficult concepts such as life,
consciousness, and intelligence which have so far eluded science and
philosophy. An example might be the question of whether viruses are
living or non-living things.
''Life is not some sort of essence added to a physico-chemical system
but neither can it be described in ordinary physico-chemical terms. It
is an emergent property which manifests itself when physico-chemical
systems are organised in a particular way.''
The words are not those of the authors but Dr John Habgood, the former
Archbishop of York who was at one time a distinguished physiologist. He
is but one of a band of scientists who are dissatisfied with the arid
explanations offered by reductionist methods and are questioning some of
the pillars upon which an alternative temple of atheism has been built.
In the new climate, nothing is sacred, not even atheism. Darwinism has
been questioned in recent years and its temptation to view the world as
a continuum with no break between the animals and ourselves can rebound
on us when we begin to notice some very human capacities in animals and
we begin to wonder if they are not capable of consciousness which is
similar to our own. That need not belittle human consciousness. It means
that consciousness is not able to be studied in isolation from other
factors, with sharp boundaries between different scientific disciplines.
The human brain is the supreme example of the complexity theory.
Nowhere is the inadequacy of reductionist theory felt more keenly. The
brain depends on a web of cellular activity but from this flow
properties of the whole organ such as consciousness, and from this flows
such things as emotions or concepts such as spiritual value.
Don't think that this a new version of ''God of the gaps'' (ie what we
can't explain, we assign to a ''God''). Complexity works both ways. It
has shocks in store for both hard-boiled atheists and for believers in a
mystic hand behind nature's artistry.
The worst shock for believers in the idea of a spiritual realm is the
suggestion of the authors that artificial intelligence and artificial
life might be able to synergise such a thing as artificial
consciousness.
And what difference is there between a computer virus and the
biological kind? The latter in its simplest form is in the form of
mathematical language called an algorithm. It depends on logic, on
statements which are either true or false, an either/or approach which
is suited to the on/off apparatus of digitalised statements. But there
are now computer viruses which are much more complex. They are closer to
biological viruses which seem to be more than the sum of their parts.
Alan Turing, the British scientist whom the authors rediscover as the
uncrowned king of modern artifical intelligence, reasoned in 1950 that
if a computer could fool someone who was communicating with it, that its
responses were that of a human, this would have created a new threshold.
Sir Roger Penrose in The Emperor's New Mind contended that this
threshold meant creating consciousness which depended on non-computable
processes.
He held that computers merely execute algorithmic processes and can
never be as smart as we are. However, those of us who have been crunched
by an advanced computer chess game, may begin to have our doubts, and
such fears are given credence by the last chapter in this book.
The best and most useful thing about this book is that it represents a
comprehensive and intelligent guide to the sharp end of science and
philosophy at the present time. It is not an easy book to read, but the
main thesis is convincingly hammered home -- that reductionist
approaches will no longer suffice.
It is high time the biologists, the computer scientists, and the
physicists started talking to one another. The synergy that might come
out of this will no doubt raise a new round of philosophical conundrums
to prove that the world is an even queerer place than in Einstein's day.
It is published in the week that Stephen Hawking's book The Physics of
Star Trek has revised his previous belief that time travel was
impossible. Just travelling back to the era when Einstein made his
remark about the queerness of the world, proves how far science has come
in a short time, and how out of date reductionist techniques have
become.
This represents good news for theology, which was once known as the
''queen of the sciences'' but was made to look increasingly irrelevant
by science which relied on reductionism, behavioural psychology, or
linguistic analysis (which allocated nil meaning to statements of
spiritual value).
The next step is to devise a common language by which they can all
talk to one another, since theologians have developed their own kind of
reductionist jargon to talk to one another. Perhaps if it is beyond the
imagination of a human, a computer will oblige.

MR Danny Kelly, purveyor of quality meats to the parish, is wont to
ask you if there will be a little something for the weekend. He's
talking, natch, of his packets of four.
Four delicacies known locally as porkers; veritable kings in the land
of the fine sausage.
When guests who are well enough for a cooked breakfast after a night
in our establishment are exposed to the giant porker it is almost always
love at first bite. Most find an excuse to call upon Mr Kelly en route
for home in order to stock up supplies to hoard about their freezers in
those parts of the country as yet uncaptured by this culinary
wunderfurter.
Mr Kelly's porkers are not available in any other measures except
multiples. You do not enter his premises demanding 454 grams of porkers,
or, for that matter, a kilo joint of lamb. This happy state of affairs
will continue to be legal for the next four years or so until the Metro
police follow up their metrication of all pre-packed foods with similar
injunctions for the loose variety. At which juncture all those of us for
whom numeracy has been an elusive concept will either become
fortuitously sylph-like or accidentally gargantuan given our innate
inability to discern our grams from our ecus.
Neither is this some cri de coeur from the ranks of the Eurosceptics.
Buying wine by the litre has never provoked any ideological resistance
in this household, while nations which can cook like the French or the
Italians are entitled to buy the ingredients therefore in whatever
strange fashion they please.
It is merely to note that for many thousands of us waking up to M-Day
yesterday morning didn't so much herald a bright new Euro dawn as strike
terror in our unmetrified ranks. And there's not the smallest point in
trying to reassure us that life will be unmeasurably (sic) better when
we live in units of 10 rather than sticking stubbornly to our 12in or
16oz.
The same propaganda offensive was utilised at decimalisation and
utterly failed to stop the nation -- or that portion of it brought up on
sterling -- from spending the rest of their days doing hard sums in
their head in order to remember to baulk at being charged 17 and
sixpence for a cup of British Rail tea.
The point was not that 10p was indisputably more logical than a
shilling, just that most folk had an ingrained instinct for what was
worth five bob.
Feet and inches are an even more persuasive case in point. For the
metrically challenged among us buying fabric in metres finds you nodding
gamefully at salespersons unable to confess that you have only the
smallest notion whether the amount suggested will stop halfway down your
window.
Feet are just comforting, that's all. If a chap with a collecting tin
for the Baroness Thatcher Foundation is six feet from you and closing,
you can make a really accurate estimate of how fast you have to take off
in the other direction to avoid the smallest chance of confrontation.
But if a neighbour asks permission to house his tame ferrets in a hutch
a full three metres from your shared fencing you don't know whether to
give him your blessing or sew up the legs of your denims.
Children who grew up in a metric world are spared all this angst. They
have been properly programmed to live on the planet M. They know how
many beans make five but they'd instinctively rather work in tens. For
them a metre is this long, easy peasy. For the rest of us it's three and
a bit feet, no, hang about, six and a bit. Oh the hell with it. The
point is it's like any foreign language; no matter how much of the
vocabulary you learn by rote, no matter how much of the grammar you
acquire, you still can't have a sensible conversation without complex
simultaneous translation going on in your brain. And it's tiring. Not
even to say trying.
But it's manageable, fun even, during a fortnight's sojourn in
southern France when shopping for holiday breakfasts still comes under
the heading of adventure, and the full range of your talents as a mime
come into play. Metrication as a way of life doesn't quite summon the
same careless rapture. Trying miming in Safeway's veg department and
staff will check the number for the men with the wrap-round coats.
Of course there is an upside to all those revolutions. If your upper
body contours are sufficiently modest to have prompted an alleged friend
to have gifted you a ''This Side Up'' T-shirt, then there may be
something to be said for your statistics, re-stated in centimetres,
becoming instantly revitalised. Those chaps who do most of their
thinking below the waist and seem obsessively interested in the
dimensions of some of their manly attributes, might also find
centimetres flatter to deceive compared with unimpressive inches.
Yet these are small gains set aside the potential for sheer chaos in
the kitchen and the supermarket. A kilo of prepacked potatoes will
hardly stave off malnourishment for a family of four, three kilos could
see a boom in hernia ops. Recipes will turn into mystery tours. Old
cookbooks with proper measurements will get you in a fankle when the
purchased ingredients are labelled only in grams. New recipe suggestions
with metric instructions will read like Sanskrit to the ''handful of
this and pinch of that'' brigade.
Anyway there is a clinching argument for the joys of not letting the
sun set on Imperial Britain. Have you ever tried to cut a birthday cake
into 10? Halves, quarters, and eighths are a doddle. Tenths are a short
cut to domestic mayhem. Count on it.

IN the past few weeks I have changed my Scottish pounds for Belgian
francs, changed the Belgian francs to French francs, the French francs
back to Belgian francs and then to Spanish pesetas and back to Belgian
francs. When this column appears I should, barring mishaps, be in Berlin
armed with D-marks which I must then change back to Belgian francs
before heading for Strasbourg which means more French francs . . . it
just never ends.
You begin to see why the European single currency can never come soon
enough for me. Until that day dawns those of us who chronicle the new
Europe will be forever condemned to live with purses, wallets, poly
bags, bulging pockets, and rattling briefcases full of worthless coins
which the banks don't want while they charge us a king's ransom for
changing our paper money.
If the latest wrangling about the single currency tells us anything it
is that suddenly the bigger states are beginning to take this whole idea
seriously. The day when fateful decisions must be taken is fast
approaching and like a bride with last-minute nerves the politicians and
bankers are suddenly feeling the feet cooling.
Into this increasingly fretful air in Brussels last week came Alastair
Dempster and Alan Scott from the Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers.
Their concern was to safeguard Scottish bank notes in the single
currency. Unlike most visitors from home they were not distributing free
samples to the media but you can't have everything.
Both men agreed that nowadays Scottish money is far more acceptable to
the English than it was in the days when shopkeepers south of the Border
charged sixpence in the pound for the privilege of accepting our notes.
They should try changing Scottish money in Europe. It is often
impossible. What is doubly irritating is that those new-fangled
automatic exchange machines at European airports nowadays are, I hear,
made in Dundee but still they won't take Scottish money!
I am grateful to Alan Scott for the information that Scotland's mint
was protected by the Treaty of Union. But, like much of our heritage,
the mint disappeared sometime after 1707. The upside is that we have
less to lose than most Europeans in joining a single currency. Our
central bank, for example, disappeared long ago.
And did you know that Bank of England notes -- like our Scottish notes
-- are not legal tender? According to Alan Scott the only notes which
were legal tender were the old Bank of England #1 notes, now
discontinued. So next time you feel like revenge for past slights in
England about our money, tell the bearer of an English tenner you can't
accept it unless you charge commission. See how he reacts.
More seriously, the threat to the survival of Scottish bank notes is
there. Maastricht lays down that the new European Central Bank (ECB) and
national central banks will issue the new money. ''The bank notes issued
by the ECB and the national central banks shall be the only such notes
to have the status of legal tender within the community,'' it states.
This has caused some concern in the Scottish banks who are eager to
exploit a protocol in the treaty which states: ''The ECB shall respect
as far as possible existing practices regarding the issue and design of
banknotes.''
Scots bankers' concern for the survival of their notes -- and Northern
Irish money as well -- is shared by the Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke. I
know because I raised the question with him earlier this year. He has
been fighting for the Scottish and Northern Irish banks to be allowed to
continue issuing notes within a single currency if and when it should
come about for Britain.
The Scots are loyal to their notes, even if others suspect them. Right
now there are Scots notes worth #1.5billion in our pockets, accounting
for about 95% of the paper money in circulation in Scotland. Public
acceptability of a single currency in Scotland could turn on whether the
new money has a Scottish as well as European identity. To that end there
are suggestions -- not firm plans as yet -- to allow national designs to
form part of one side of the new notes. That should do the trick.
Messrs Dempster and Scott concluded in a memo to the Eurocrats: ''If
the alternative were to be notes issued by the UK central bank (Bank of
England) with their name on the new currency, it could generate a
considerable amount of adverse nationalist sentiment.''
Quite right, too.

WHAT is Mr Tony Blair up to? Is he offering us a change of Government,
or merely a change of Prime Minister? If he does not address this
question pretty soon, we the voters will answer it for him, maybe next
year.
Perhaps Mr Blair has been awaiting his moment -- the Labour Party is
gathered in Brighton this week -- to begin to tell us how, given power,
he would achieve his aims. These are pretty much the same as everybody
else's: steady growth, fair taxation, low inflation, and as close to
full employment as you can get.
Put it another way. If the Government is unable to achieve these aims
(and we shall hear a lot about that this week), exactly how and why
would Prime Minister Blair be competent? The speeches of his Shadow
Chancellor Gordon Brown are so constrained that I am hard put to find a
Tory who can honestly disagree with them.
If this is the case, it is no surprise that disquiet in the Labour
Party has increased, is increasing, and will continue to increase. One
of Labour's chief cards, solidarity in the face of persistent Tory
disunity, is in danger of being trumped. There are distinct signs that
the Tories are at last uniting behind their leader.
Mr Blair, it can be argued, has correctly used his honeymoon period to
drive through, as a matter of priority, a process of party reforms set
in train by his predecessors Neil Kinnock and John Smith. He tells us
that this process is to continue. Those who resist have to contemplate
yet another period in Opposition. He is going to do it, anyway.
This week he is confronted by conference challenges on his attitude to
grant-maintained schools, a minimum wage, and the dumping of an
''extreme'' left-wing prospective parliamentary candidate, Liz Davies.
It does not sound much when you consider the party conference
confrontations over the past 30 years that Labour leaders have faced.
It does not sound much, because, in 1995, it isn't much in the way of
fundamental political philosophy. Compare it with unilateral nuclear
disarmament, getting into (or out of) Europe, nationalisation, incomes
policy, secondary strike action. Compare it with the rise of the
Militants and the departure of Labour leading lights to found the Social
Democratic Party.
Nevertheless, the press (myself included) will make much of these
comparatively trifling disputes of 1995 at the Labour conference -- if
for no other reason than that we know the Tories will make much of them
when they gather for their conference in Blackpool the following week.
And rightly so; if that is all that is going on at the conference of the
party that aspires to power as soon as possible (I repeat, maybe next
year) that is what we report.
I suspect that Mr Blair is sufficiently in command of his party to
finesse this year's conference difficulties. We will not be utterly
distracted by them, whether he succeeds or fails, if Labour has
something more important to tell us. What we should be anticipating is
Mr Blair and his Shadow Ministers spelling out the difference between
them and Mr Major's possibly revived Government.
If Labour fails again to do this effectively, they are in danger of
having their other chief political card trumped. The nation's weariness
after 17 years of Tory Government may not prove to be terminal for the
Tories if Mr Blair is concerned only to massage the voters.
This is not to say that Mr Blair has got to come up with a big new
idea. Various politicians have looked for such a thing with the
dedication of a search for a holy grail. They are hard to come by.
Margaret Thatcher's privatisation (Harold Macmillan's ''selling the
family silver'') was the last one. Nor should we look for something
''really socialist''. Try China or North Korea.
If Blair is the true inheritor of Roy Jenkins's socialism, if new
Labour is, in effect, the erstwhile SDP, so be it. There are Tories who
would argue that that is what Majorism is. The voters may well relish a
propaganda truce. Indeed, they have it already on some issues like
stable growth and Northern Ireland. If you want your clear political
divide between Labour and Tory, you have it in Scottish devolution and
reform/abolition of the House of Lords. Is that enough?
Having accepted that the basic force of modern economies is the
private sector and the market-place (as the way of the world), Labour
must demonstrate precisely how the force would be tempered for the
profit and not just the social conscience of the voters. Real jobs,
training, housing, education, and health all cost money. More than can
be found by cutting waste (the Tories have pretty well done that) or a
one-off windfall tax on utility profits.
This week Mr Blair should square up to the accusation of John Wells,
the lecturer in economics at Cambridge University and former adviser to
John Smith. He claims that Labour has diagnosed Britain's ills correctly
but as yet has provided no policy cure.
Blair's ''New Economic Future for Britain'' has advanced little since
1992, he says. ''The novelty comes in measures to combat unemployment,
eschewing greater generosity in benefits and a complete absence of
specifics on tax and spending. To argue the case for increased national
investment and then fail to provide and advocate the necessary means for
achieving this is, arguably, a great deceit on the British public.''
(Red Pepper, October, 1995).
He finds certain areas in Labour's thinking, like the welfare state,
to be ''idea-free zones''. He concludes: ''Labour's leaders must do more
than show that they can be more competent managers of a capitalist
economy.''
That is what Mr Major is trying to do now. So why change Prime
Ministers, let alone the Government? Tell us, Mr Blair.

WE were interested to read the perception of Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton that today's health service in Scotland is better than
ever (September 27). The Minister seems to conclude that just because
beds, patients, waiting times, and costs are counted better the reformed
NHS is actually ''working for patients''.
What we see is a health sevice apparently drifting along with no one
person at the helm. Morale is at an all-time low.
Doctors who used to complain about being forced to retire at 70 are
now eager to retire in their early fifties, thus exacerbating current
shortages particularly in paediatrics, accident and emergency, plastic
surgery, and anaesthetics. In general practice there is a large number
of unfilled trainee vacancies.
Lord James reminds us that funding has increased since 1979. But so
have the administrative and bureaucratic costs of running the service
and these are on top of more money which needs to be spent because of
new treatments and increasing demand.
Today's problems in the NHS have been compounded by a series of new
initiatives introduced one after the other in an unco-ordinated fashion
-- for example, the much needed move to reduce the working hours of
junior doctors at the same time as introducing a shorter training period
to reach consultant level.
Reduced bed numbers and the early discharge of patients into the
community have been instigated before proper arrangements are in place
for primary care teams to cope.
Like Lord James we believe that it is the patient's health service and
that they have the right to know about what is really happening.
However, his contention that making a complaint will be a frequent form
of input into the health service shows how little attention is paid to
the wishes of patients by those at the centre of decision-making and by
those in charge of trusts.
Scotland's health service is very good but there is nothing to be
gained by denying its undoubted problems.

I am writing my appreciation of the objective reporting of the report
into the killing of a man by a schizophrenia sufferer (September 26).
There is a danger of such tragedies leading to an attack on the whole
policy of Care in the Community, a concept which NSF (Scotland)
supports, both in principle and in practice through a wide range of
services.
There have been problems, as the report highlights, with lack of
resources and poor communication between health and social services, but
isolated tragedies do not mean that community care policy as a whole is
failing.

RUTH Wishart's article, Defence of NHS now down to us (September 25),
bears little relation to the facts.
To suggest that Ayrshire and Arran Health Board ''enthusiastically
embraced private medicine'' is absolute nonsense since there was and is
no question of privatisation. Trust hospitals remain firmly within the
NHS as Ruth Wishart would find if she was referred to our consultant
staff.
No patient attending any hospital in the South Ayrshire NHS Trust
since it was established on April 1, 1992, has had to pay for treatment.
Treatment in our hospitals remains free of charge as it does in any
hospital under NHS trust management.
Putting services out to tender, whether clinical services or ancillary
services, is aimed at achieving better services and the best value for
public money. Treatment remains as always free at the point of need
exactly as envisaged in 1948 when our NHS commenced.
To state as Ruth Wishart does that ''medical staff were advised not to
publicise their reservations under pain of sudden unemployment'' is just
not founded on facts. She must have a remarkably short memory if she
does not recall the vigorous opposition to trust status taken by very
many in the medical profession in Ayrshire.
Happily the majority of those opposed four years ago now see the
advantages to their patients. Our staff has worked very hard to make a
success of the new NHS in Ayrshire.
Where are the ''technological goodies'' with which Ruth Wishart claims
we were provided? Much of the excellent equipment in Ayr Hospital was
installed as a result of good housekeeping, money being saved by
transferring the best equipment from the three hospitals which closed
when Ayr Hospital was commissioned.
Any ''technological goodies'' since then have been purchased within
our own resources and to provide the highest standard of investigation
and treatment for our patients.
Ruth Wishart should really do some research before she makes her
attacks and I now extend a warm invitation to her to visit us at Ayr.

Chairman, The South Ayrshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Ayr.

AS organiser of the Doors Open Day in Glasgow I respond on behalf of
Glasgow Building Preservation Trust to Jan Jamieson's letter which
complained that the event had only been publicised to a small in-crowd
(September 28).
This year's open day attracted well over 75,000 visits to buildings
through the city over the two-day period. Clearly someone, somewhere,
had stumbled upon the secret and spread the word.
Perhaps it was due to the 100,000 leaflets that we distributed, or the
articles and adverts in the press in the weeks leading up to the
weekend, or the free buses laid on to shuttle members of the city's 49
housing associations around talks and events on the day, or the fact
that Ceefax and Radio Scotland carried notification of the event.
The ''in-crowd''also seemed to consist of people of all ages, social
groups, and geographical spread. On the weekend itself, if you happened
to be in Glasgow it was impossible to avoid crowds of people all
clutching their orange leaflet.
Yes, it did feel a little like a club as countless numbers of
overheard conversations between complete strangers revolved around where
they had been and where they would be going on to next -- but this was a
club of thousands of genuinely interested, motivated people who not only
were enjoying themselves, but learning about the city, and feeling a
deep pride in it.
The Doors Open Day publicity will not have reached all inhabitants of
Strathclyde, probably not even everyone in Glasgow, but then as Doors
Open Day is organised by a charity with a staff of two and is dependent
on not only the goodwill of the building owners but also on the
enthusiasm of many unpaid volunteers we cannot afford to be totally
dispirited by this.
Glasgow's Doors Open Day was easily the largest public participation
event in architecture in Scotland. We are grateful to those many
thousands of people who took part in a spirit of genuine delight and
appreciation.

AS someone who devoted my Saturday on Doors Open Day to helping to
open a building in Glasgow's city centre, I was delighted to read Jan
Jamieson's letter declaring that it was the most brilliant day ever.But
why did she carp that the day was poorly publicised and ''open only to
the in-club''?
Doors Open Day is run by a charity, Glasgow Building Preservation
Trust, which organises the day, free of charge, to all-comers. I
certainly saw it advertised and publicised in The Herald and the Evening
Times.
I also saw heaps of leaflets in my local library. I know that they
were very widely circulated throughout the city. In fact the trust sent
out almost 100,000 leaflets. As a volunteer, I delivered a good few of
these and kept places topped up.
Glasgow Building Preservation Trust has to raise every penny it spends
on Doors Open day, so just how much more publicity is it expected to
provide? It is a free day run on the goodwill and hard work of a great
many people. Even some of the larger city centre buildings would have
found it difficult to cope with more visitors.
The building which I helped to open to the public was simply
constantly packed with Glaswegians of all ages and descriptions, and
visitors to the city from as far away as Japan. Many hundreds of
interested individuals passed through the doors. People told me that at
venues the queues stretched down the street and thousands visited.
On Park Circus on Sunday, the trust even organised occasional street
theatre performances to entertain those queueing to get into the various
buildings. If this is ''only an in-club'', then we must be the biggest
in-club in Scotland.

A YOUNG newly qualified civil-engineering graduate seeking his first
professional appointment was recently invited for interview at the other
side of the country. In these times interviews are difficult to come by
and this opportunity was hard-won after circulating many CVs to
well-known and less well-known organisations.
The offer made carried a remuneration equivalent to #1.80 per hour.
When the graduate pointed out that he could neither relocate nor live on
this amount the prospective employer, fully agreeing, offered two
solutions: first, take a second job to supplement his income, secondly,
seek a parental contribution for his support.
It is accepted that young graduates will need some time before they
can make a substantial contribution to an organisation but this period
has in the past been viewed as an investment in the future or indeed a
moral obligation to contribute to the training needs of industry.
I am sure I cannot be alone in condemning organisations who expect to
be subsidised by ''parental contribution'' or by their staff
''moonlighting''.
This attitude of greed bodes ill both for the future of the industry
and the country when five years of dedication to gaining a degree
results in such abysmal behaviour from captains of industry and
commerce.

THERE appears no end to the lengths some companies will go to extract
additional cash from their unsuspecting customers.
Recently I went into a travel agent to book a short autumn break. Not
content with trying to sell travel insurance at exorbitant prices, they
informed me that there is now a #1 charge per person if the account is
paid by credit card.
On questioning this I was informed it was the fault of the banks but I
strongly suspect it is simply the travel agent or tour operator trying
to improve their margins.

I AM very interested that Lloyds Bank are introducing a left-handed
chequebook. I am (extremely) left-handed and have learned that the
easiest way to write a cheque and still make a signature resemble the
one on the back of my guarantee card is to take the cheque out of the
book first.
Since I am a Clydesdale Bank customer I will have to continue doing
this -- not a great problem. What I do find a problem is Switch and
credit-card machines where you have to sign the slip while it is still
in the machine.
If I hold my pen as usual I end up pressing at least four or five
buttons on the machine and still not managing a very good signature. If
I try not to press the buttons then I have to suspend my hand in mid-air
(also not ideal for doing my normal signature).
When are they going to sort this out? In the meantime Lloyds' effort
is admirable but slightly misguided. I can tear a cheque out of the book
but there's damn all I can do about those machines.

DERMOT FEENAN'S Open Forum makes an important contribution to the
medical ethics debate on life-or-death issues (September 21). But these
arguments revolve around individual cases which could nevertheless lead
to '' . . . greater use of advance directives about medical treatment .
. . ''
Therein, perhaps, lies a danger of generalising from the specific
tragic case (with which we can surely emphasise) to procedures which
affect the wider populace.
Before we rush to surrender our most precious right to life, we should
contemplate the entire spectrum of possible consequences. We must
examine the fine print of any legal changes which could potentially
affect every person living today, as well as future generations.
We are all deeply affected, physically and psychologically, by the
outcomes of change to fundamental human rights and the protective laws
and medical ethics which have served developed societies well over the
years.
When, exceptionally, the withdrawal of life-support is deemed
necessary -- bearing in mind continual advances in general and
palliative medicine, and the penchant of the State to reduce public
spending -- it should only be decided on a case-by-case basis by an
independent tribunal consisting of lay persons, advised by legal and
medical experts.
This must include persons acting on behalf of the patient, whose
interests are paramount.
If we can find money to fund panels and committees to decide Council
Tax appeals and employment issues, we can surely do so for such vital
resolutions. The decisions reached by special-case medical tribunals
would certainly protect individual doctors and reduce the burden of
responsibility for such a patient's relatives.
There shoud be no carte blanche legislation for fundamental changes
which could weaken medical ethics and diminish our inherent trust in the
medical profession.

AS French nationals living in Scotland, we feel we have a moral
responsibility to define our stance regarding the nuclear tests carried
out in the Pacific Ocean on the orders of Mr Chirac's Government.
This irresponsible policy puts the health of thousands of people at
risk. It reflects an utter disrespect for these populations and for
public opinion.
In addition, it may act as an inducement to further development of
nuclear armament.
We are stunned and angered and as further tests are about to be
performed, we are determined to continue the protest and to keep sending

THERE is no point in being snooty about it. If the voters of this
country wish to flock to the support of the Scottish Nationalist Party
because they have been enthralled by the acting of a small Australian
and the scenery of Ireland, who can object? Labour for one, although Mr
Salmond and his clever cohorts who spotted the marketing possibilities
inherent in Braveheart are to be congratulated for remembering that
politics is not only about statistics, truth, and justice, it is also
about emotion and about appealing to altruism as well as to pockets. The
SNP made the link between the film and the recent increase of public
interest in their party apparent yesterday when the chief executive
spoke about an intelligent response to the film and thousands of
expressions of interest from cinema-goers in reaction to the SNP's
leafletting campaign outside cinemas. If this is the reason behind the
leap in support for the SNP shown through our System Three opinion poll
this morning it is a remarkable affair and an indication of the impact
that popular culture can have on the forming of political support.
Nevertheless, in the terms normally associated with assessments of the
weight of policy and argument this is not serious politics. Nor is it
likely to be in the long run unless the appetite for cinematic
representation of Scottish heroes continues until the next election.
Mr Salmond will not mind. Politicians can be the most pragmatic of
people and anything which popularises his party will be welcome. He has
also benefited from the conjunction of the SNP conference, which was a
relatively successful affair, with the taking of the poll samples. There
is, however, a deeper and more important trend running through the
polling results. Labour has been losing ground and has dropped 11 points
since the middle of the summer. There is no point in Mr Robertson
fretting about this for the level of support for Labour throughout much
of Mr Blair's first year in leadership was unnaturally high and was
never likely to be converted to permanence. What is important is the
level at which support for Labour bottoms out, for only that will give
an inkling of what might happen over the months until the next General
Election.
In this respect Mr Blair, whose second party conference as leader is
bound to be more difficult than its predecessor, must make a success of
Brighton. It is clear what sort of conference he wants because he has
said already that it should demonstrate a closing of ranks. Mr Blair
does not want trouble; he is just as likely in his speech on Tuesday to
make this abundantly clear as he is to spend time attacking the Tories.
His wish will not be granted entirely, and for this we should be
grateful. Bloodless politics is anaemic politics and an anaemic Labour
Party is an unappealing prospect. It is likely, though, that the
opposition which Mr Blair must face, ranging from issues like the
minimum wage to the abolition of grant-maintained schools and the need
to renationalise those parts of British Rail which have been removed
from public hands, is probably capable of management. But this is not
enough. It is not sufficient for the Labour Party and it is certainly
not sufficient for the country. Mr Blair must tell his followers, and
those listening outside, precisely where he wishes to go. This is not a
demand for a detailed election manifesto, but it is most definitely a
request for solid policy details. Mr Blair has to take heart and be
brave, like the SNP.

<HEADLINE>Nigerian act of clemency. Government bows to world opinion</HEADLINE>

THE Nigerian military government has bowed to world opinion and
rescinded its severe sanctions on 40 alleged political conspirators
whose intended coup it claimed to have forestalled. Since some were to
have been executed and others subjected to very long prison sentences,
this act of clemency will be widely welcomed and not least because the
original trial which condemned the victims was held in secret. It was
impossible for anyone objectively to assess the evidence and the
sentences were generally held to be political and not legal in nature.
The same is true of the fate imposed upon the businessman, Moshood
Abiola, who probably won the last presidential election in 1993, but who
is in prison accused of treason because General Abacha, the country's
dictator, could not accept such an outcome. Both the act of clemency and
the continued imprisonment of Mr Abiola are testimonies to the highly
personal way the country is ruled. Much the same element is seen in the
proclaimed return to civil rule which an elaborate, but tortoise-like,
progression of constitutional devices prolongs to three years.
This is an example of world opinion, often precisely focused by
diplomatic activity, having a positive effect on a non-elected regime.
Foreign governments made their opposition to the whole affair open and
emphatic. They included three of the country's main trading partners --
Britain, France, and the United States -- whose involvement in the
economy could not be ignored by General Abacha. (For example, the
Americans take half Nigeria's oil exports which are almost the only
source of hard currency earnings.) Possibly important too was the fear
that Nigeria might be denied participation in this year's Commonwealth
conference, an outturn which would have been felt adversely by domestic
public opinion. That opinion was itself a factor in the regime's
surrender for it has stoutly remained unwilling to accept the various
apologia of General Abacha and his colleagues, although it has lacked
any power to impose its own views.
The regime has surrendered, but only in part. Using the thirty-fifth
anniversary of the country's independence from British rule as a pretext
to justify the clemency, General Abacha has held on to power effectively
by emasculating the constitutional proposals through insisting on a very
long timetable to implement them. There is no obvious reason why it
should take three years to hold free elections. Nigeria does have
enormous problems, which derive from the fact that its status as a
single country came only from its imperial experience and was
contradicted by almost every other consideration -- language, religion,
regional and ethnic identities, social and economic development. Making
it one country was bound to take a long time, even without events like
the Biafran war of the 1960s which helped to alienate the Ibo people who
had previously had the greatest stake in national unity.
All the difficulties provided for in the timetable are therefore
entirely plausible but the vital question is whether these are best
confronted by the military government or might be better addressed by a
new civilian administration. The soldiers' usual answer to this is that
the civilian politicians fall too quickly into corruption, something
which has destroyed all previous civil administrations. This is
indisputable but the experiment is always worth making -- democracy is
damaged by corruption, sometimes seriously, but not always defeated; if
it were the history of Western democracy would be very different.
Nigeria deserves the opportunity a return to civilian rule confers. It
is what most thoughtful Nigerians aspire to enjoy and it is only General
Abacha and his friends who at the moment deny them the chance.

THERE'S an awful lot of corn on the road to Iowa. It begins at a
cinema near you, where fat-bellies, who should know better, sink the
full weight of their obesity into the seat beside you, set about those
disgusting troughs of popcorn and gorge themselves unto the limit of
abdominal tolerance.
If you haven't been to the pictures in recent years you won't know
what I'm talking about. But, take it from me, the hot stench of that
animal fodder is what keeps people like me from visiting the cinema more
often.
It is now, however, such a major part of the profit for those
multi-screen organisations that they won't give it up.
With such comfort in their modern picture houses -- and so many good
films on offer -- the least they could do is to provide a food-free area
where those of us who go to see the film, and not to hold a picnic,
could concentrate our attention without distraction from the vulgarity
of guzzlers.
At East Kilbride the other night I allowed my sense of humour to
concede, for once, that the corn had perhaps a certain relevance for
those of us watching The Bridges of Madison County, praised by the
critics as a candidate for the Oscars next year and featuring the
exquisite Meryl Streep and the hopelessly miscast Clint Eastwood.
After all, the film takes place in that great corn state of Iowa,
where the crop grows as high as an elephant's eye. And to extend the
analogy, those critics are falling over themselves to say that this film
is all the more brilliant because it came from such a corny novel.
I don't know what they are blethering about. With the novel, I found
The Bridges of Madison County to be a touching love story, beautifully
written with a spare but deceptive simplicity by Robert James Waller, a
tall, gentle academic who sat down at the age of 53 to write his first
novel.
A genuinely modest man, he told me later he had expected to run off
100 copies for friends. Instead, a New York agent came upon the
manuscript, wondered where Waller had been all his life, and sold it to
Warner Books.
The Bridges of Madison County was soon the publishing sensation of
America and when we met in London, the bewildered author was trying to
absorb an initial sales figure of four million hardbacks, with so much
more to come.
At that point, however, he had not yet received a single dollar in
royalties and I had the pleasure of seeing Robert James Waller,
anticipating the status of multi-millionaire, conveying his charming
wife around the showrooms of Kensington and gazing at that magnificent
Porsche, which he would soon be able to afford.
It was a fairy-tale come true. I warmed to the Wallers and soon
realised that they were basically the models for the main characters in
the book. Robert becomes Robert Kincaid, freelance photographer working
for National Geographic and driving down Iowa to take pictures of the
quaint old, real-life, covered bridges of Madison County.
His wife, Georgie Ann, became Francesca Johnson, the Italian girl who
went back after the war with her GI boyfriend, Richard, to the life of
an Iowan farmer's wife which didn't exactly fit the dreams of her
romantic soul.
But she was resigned to her duties, a faithful wife of 20 years, when
husband and teenage children went off to the state fair for a few days
-- and a stranger came up the farm road, looking for directions. Robert
Kincaid had lost his way and who better to guide him than the Latin lady
with time on her hands?
Those few days became the secret which she carried to her eternity,
revealed only in a letter to her children when the will was read. It is
a delightful tale.
So what happened to the film? Well, I do remember Robert James Waller
telling me that either Robert Redford or Clint Eastwood had been
mentioned for the part. Eastwood seems to have gained control of the
project, to the point that he decided not only to direct it himself but
to take on the leading role of Kincaid.
All credit to him for choosing Meryl Streep as the leading lady. This
amazing woman, incredibly plain and stunningly beautiful almost at the
same time, must surely rank as one of the greatest actresses of this or
any age.
In The Bridges of Madison County she has chalked up a performance
which could well bring an Oscar nomination.
And Clint Eastwood? His performance is little short of disastrous,
rivalled as a travesty only by the snail-pace of his direction.
Having been charmed by the book, I was ready to applaud the film. But,
oh dear.
There is only so long you can linger with facial studies and no
action.
At one stage he is poised to kiss his new-found lover but hovers so
long and so farcically that the lassie beside me, pausing from her
popcorn, called out: ''Oh for Goad's sake, kiss 'er!'' I thoroughly
sympathised.
The plain truth is that Clint Eastwood is too old for the part
(gruesomely worn, I have to report) and if this stiff and unromantic
performance gets anywhere near the Academy Awards it will surely be to
qualify for the wooden spoon.

Julia Langdon meets with mixed fortunes at the Brighton races
IT WAS John Prescott who was foolish enough to give the first hostage
to fortune at Brighton Races yesterday afternoon when he picked out
Naval Gazer in the 2.15 race.
''I certainly won't be backing that,'' he told a variety of punters
from the centre of the parade ring before the off. Navel-gazing is not
in vogue in New Labour circles, one gathers. They all have their eyes
set on the distant sunlit uplands, on future horizons, on new
beginnings.
Indeed, Mr Prescott recommended us instead to consider Pearl Dawn in
the 5.30 race. Unfortunately for him, however, Naval Gazer, happened to
be the 7-4 favourite and the odds actually came in as the opening of
Brighton's first Sunday race meeting approached.
Your reporter had the honour and privilege of hearing the party's
deputy leader nagging the poor horse to slow up as it cruised towards an
easy win. I did gather, however, that Mrs Pauline Prescott, like others
among us, had not taken her husband's advice.
There were plenty of sunlit uplands to delight the eyes of the
politically optimistic at Brighton. The racecourse is a couple of miles
above the town, on the Downs, and is laughingly described as being on
the flat.
It provides a magnificent view of both town and countryside, and the
Labour Party could not have wished for a more fitting location for the
first race meeting ever sponsored by a political party.
In the first place, it is a municipal racecourse, a fact which is
obviously a plus for the people's party -- old and new, while they
continue to argue about the degree of state ownership in Britain
tomorrow -- and there is the added advantage of Brighton council being
under Labour control.
The taxi driver did mention that I had done well to leave my own car
behind as the racecourse car park was often targeted by dissatisfied
council tenants, and the Whitehawk Estate below the course is the one
where Poor little Maria Colwell lived and died, and put a name to child
abuse all those years ago.
But yesterday was a bright, sparkling day with the wind off the sea
whipping racecards and betting slips from the hands of the unwary, most
of whom were looking more at the company they were keeping than at
either the prospects on the course or the Sussex horizon. It will be a
surprise to no-one to learn that politicians continue to talk as horses
approach the post.
The first problem of the day had been what to wear. John Prescott and
most of the rest of the Shadow Cabinet who presented prizes were in
suits. There were plenty of mobile telephones, but scarcely a brown
derby among them. I searched in vain for The Herald's tipster, Robin
Cook, who would certainly have hit the right sartiorial note, but he was
reputed to be in hiding to stop people asking his advice.
It was said to be extremely poor form to suggest that successful tips
were being exchanged for votes in this year's National Executive
elections.
There was some reassurance on this score to be found by the
manifestation at the gates of none other than Barbara Follett. It was as
if she was there for the very purpose. Mrs Follett is, of course, the
style guru, credited with dressing New Labour in clothes appropriate to
its ambition.
That was before she herself became the Labour candidate for Stevenage.
History and the style-conscious New Labour racegoer may care to note
that yesterday she decided not to wear her ''Rolling Rose'' T-shirt,
which had been an option, and chose instead straight black trousers, a
tartan-style wool jacket, and had her black hair tucked into a checked
cap. She looked really like any well-to-do comrade, not too dressy, but
not too downbeat.
It was a jolly occasion assisted by a number of hospitality suites.
The Parliamentary Beer Club was said to have a tent somewhere although I
kept meeting MPs still anxiously searching for it.
A special conference ale was on sale, bearing pictures of Tony Blair
and John Prescott, although it was slightly disappointing to read on the
label that the contents would be best between October 20 and next
February.
The weather was fine. The going good. There was the atmosphere of a
family outing and the horses, like the ordinary Brighton punters, took
all the political nonsense, well in their stride.
For the record: Thatcherella came nowhere in the last race. As for
Pearl Dawn, it was placed third after a photo. Mr Prescott should be

A seasonal hysteria begins to evidence itself, George Hume observes as
diminishing daylight leads to a sense of foreboding
THE nights, as the saying goes, are drawing in . . . the season of
mellow fruitfulness the harbinger of a seemingly endless retreat into
cold, dark and damp. Some look forward to winter's bleakness spent with
a fireside book, a tempest on the far side of the curtains adding warmth
to a glass of medicinal sustenance.
Others will seize winter's opportunity to turn out Mondays, Wednesdays
and Fridays to attend -- for the fifth successive season -- First Year
French or Intermediate Macrame. Another great army, the ranks of which
overwhelm the combined force of readers and learners, will submerge its
collective sloth in a soup of soaps and quiz games, a stir-fry of new
sit-coms, a stew of old sit-coms and a five-star order of repeats that
gives the programme pages of the fourth estate a stellar quality with no
fear of sparkle.
Untold millions, subscribing to the belief that life is a lottery,
will spend their winter weeks closed to the prospect of failure, ears
and eyes stopped up with a tampion of Instants to be removed only on
Saturdays in the small-screen company of Anthea Turner.
But an unhappy band of Britons, an estimated half-million strong, will
spend those months when the Cockbridge to Tomintoul road is blocked,
wracked by real suffering, victims of a condition known as season
affective disorder which gives the nifty acronym SAD.
SAD is all about shorter days and lack of sunlight, the condition
manifesting itself in depression with a side serving of over-eating and
weight gain and a tendency to spend more time between the sheets sound
asleep . . . at some cost to the study of French irregular verbs and the
finer points of fringing and knotting.
To those unhappy men and women who are SAD the ripening of apples and
the browning of nuts is a count-down to six months of purgatory. Fun and
games at Christmas and a New Year debauch do little to lift their
seasonal gloom -- SAD, for its sufferers, is no laughing matter.
Now, given that there are few among us who would be hard put to claim
a good excuse for depression, and even fewer who would admit to enjoying
a wet queue for the 8.15 to work on a Monday morning in dark December,
how are the compassionate among us to recognise those sorry cases who
really are SAD . . . in a word, tell the clinically gloomy from mere
malingerers who may spoil it all by a quick burst of joie de vivre?
Thanks to medical advances over the past decade and the vigour of the
SAD Association in encouraging those who can't face another winter to
come out and join up, their propaganda, driving most of us to the point
of tears just as soon as the sedge has withered from the lake, it is
easy to spot tubby SADman and his snoozing wife.
They will spend several hours a day -- at home and at work -- sitting
in front of a light-box. Straighten up. There they will be, too
depressed even to be allowed to attend a funeral, soaking up light-rays
in order to turn themselves into a barrel of laughs.
Thus are they easily spotted for no-one, unless either just come down
with the last shower of rain or not utterly hacked off with the whole
winter darkness business, would bother to cart around a box of light
bulbs, plug it in and light up.
The idea, apparently, is that the light-box makes the body think it is
summer again, thus kidding it into lifting the depression. As any doctor
can tell you some bodies are easier fooled than others. The condition
strikes, one is told, in autumn when -- as we have already agreed -- the
nights draw in.
Research shows that the shorter autumn days set off a chain of
hormonal reactions, starting -- the SAD Association will tell you if you
are not too depressed to ask -- in the pineal gland in the centre of the
brain. (Could it be that knowing this kind of thing makes one
depressed?) The gland responds to growing darkness by producing the
hormone melatonin. So now you know.
The SAD Association reports that the winter blues have come early this
year because of the greater than usual let-down experienced at the start
of this autumn following a Saharan summer. Pride, as every Calvinist
knows, comes before a fall: likewise great light before great
despondency . . . and there was you thinking it was just a natural
reaction to the political conference season.
Those among us who do not have the sheer face to lug around a
light-box and plug in the winter months -- this being Scotland there are
six of them and that is some lug -- may none the less need some form of
comfort blanket when daylight reduces to a peep and the sun hibernates.
But, chances are even if we could find something worth trying that is
not packaged in 75 centilitres at 35%, it would not work. Soaked in
rain, mislaid in winter's stygian dark, stiff with frost, our comfort
blanket would soon have us reaching for the chocolate bars and putting
on the weight, depression one-nil in our year of two halves. SAD really.

<HEADLINE>LOOSENING THE OLD SCHOOL TIE. Prince Charles went -- though William won't -- but all is not lost at Gordonstoun.</HEADLINE>

IF YOU walk through the magnificent grounds of Gordonstoun School
early of a morning you will not hear the panting of 450 pupils on a
torturous mandatory run, nor will you hear their screams as they shiver
under an icy cold shower.
If that ever was the case then times have changed at the school where
the royal family have traditionally sent their offspring, and indeed
change is fundamental to the philosophy on which the school was
established and which has helped maintain its standards and reputation
for more than 60 years.
There were some raised eyebrows when it was announced that Prince
William was to break with tradition by going to Eton rather than the
Morayshire establishment where his father and grandfather were educated,
but at Gordonstoun they are putting on a brave front.
''Disappointed? No we are not disappointed,'' said Mr James Thomas,
the director of external affairs. ''It is difficult to be disappointed
when the Duke of York and the Princess Royal are on our board of
governors and Peter and Zara Phillips are pupils here.
''It is entirely up to parents where they think their children are
going to have the best education. I think we would have been delighted
and honoured if they had decided to send him here because I have no
doubt this is a school where he would do very well.''
Perhaps that message will be conveyed to Prince William's grandparents
when they visit the school on Friday for a timely royal boost, although
the Duke of Edinburgh is well aware of the lifestyle at Gordonstoun,
having been a pupil there in the 1930s.
Life certainly was more Spartan then but as he himself has said, it
never was as bad as was reported in the media.
''Traditionally we are a disaster,'' said Mr Thomas. ''One examines
the things we are doing every year or two and unless there is a very
good reason for hanging on, it may be changed, and that's what happens
to things like the cold shower and the morning run.
''The morning run still happens but it is voluntary and even when it
wasn't voluntary it was only round the house as a waker-upper. It wasn't
10 miles or anything, only a few hundred yards. Also it was never done
in the dark or the wet, so that ruled out about half of the year.
''The cold shower scenario was that after you had your hot shower in
the winter you had a cold one so you didn't catch a cold when you went
outside. There were six hot showers on either side of a cold one in the
middle and you were meant to jump under it on the way out. A third of
them did it, a third of them didn't, and a third of them probably didn't
bother with the hot shower either.''
The Duke of Edinburgh was a pupil at Gordonstoun in the 1930s shortly
after it had been founded by Dr Kurt Hahn, a headmaster who was under
threat from the Nazis for standing firm in the face of aggression and
left Germany to establish the international school.
Concerned by a decay in society he wanted to foster in young people
skill, compassion, honesty, initiative, adventure, and service to their
fellow beings.
These objectives remain unchanged, but Gordonstoun is constantly
striving to deliver them in the best possible ways and ones which are
appropriate to a changing society.
''Gordonstoun believes that by lighting fires in the hearts and minds
of boys and girls and by challenging them to appreciate that there is
more in them than they think they will be prepared for citizenship and
life,'' says the glossy brochure which is part of the marketing
operation to continue to attract pupils at #12,000 a year despite a
declining number of children and the recession.
One of the successful initiatives has been their summer school which
attracted 22 in 1976 and now enrols 10 times as many for a month of
typical Gordonstoun life including sports, creative arts, cultural
activities, an adventure expedition, and an ocean cruise.
The summer school has successfully whetted the appetite of many pupils
and their parents for a more permanent taste of Gordonstoun life and the
school remains unable to satisfy all the demand for places from
applicants around the world.
Physical education is the backbone of school life at Gordonstoun but
Mr Thomas insists that there is no youngster who is not able to adapt at
Gordonstoun even though, just as Prince Charles has stated publicly,
there are some aspects less enjoyable than others.
''When they arrive I always say it doesn't really matter whether they
are hearty little rugby players or enthusiastic artists who play three
musical instruments,'' said Mr Thomas.
''The musicians and artists have to climb the odd mountain and go
sailing and the games players have to spend time in art, design,
technology, and music as well and may well find they have a bit of
talent at both ends.
''If you said to a class of 18 14-year-olds, 'hands up who wants to
climb Stac Polly this weekend' you would get two if you were lucky. If
you said, 'Come on chaps, everyone's going to climb Stac Polly this
weekend' and they all went, out of the same 18, 18 would have had a
great time. If presented in the right way they enjoy it and they find
things in themselves.''
''What don't you like about Gordonstoun?'' I asked a group of senior
pupils, and the best complaint they could come up with was ''the
weather''. Even that came from American Jeff Lang who followed a string
of family members across the Atlantic from the warmth of LA. He and his
fellow pupils all speak well, and well of the school, and seem convinced
that taking part in a wide variety of activities is benefiting them.
Until his arrival at Gordonstoun Jeff had a less than respectful view
of the game of rugby. He is now an enthusiastic member of the currently
very successful rugby team captained by Fergie Gladstone, a descendant
of Prime Minister Gladstone.
Young Gladstone shares not only the back row with Peter Phillips but a
sense of humour. The Herald erroneously named the young royal as the
captain for a recent high-profile game and he was quick to cut out the
offending sentence and stick it on Gladstone's bedroom door -- which
suggests they read the right newspapers at Gordonstoun.
Jeff is also a member of the school's fire service unit, part of
Grampian Fire Brigade, which responds to two or three local calls each
week. There are three shifts of pupils and one shift always carries
pagers so they can respond instantly to emergencies in the two
appliances based in the school whether it be 3am or they are in chapel
or chemistry.
They are a highly trained team with Peter Phillips as the pupil head
of the service although they are under the command of sub-officer David
Spooner, the head of English.
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will see their grandson involved
in a fire-fighting display during this week's visit to the school.
In addition to the fire service there are trained coastguards in the
school who are on call along 50 miles of Moray coastline; there is a
mountain rescue team and a ski patrol, an inshore rescue unit, the canoe
lifeguard, and the Special Boat Service train pupils to save life in and
from the water.
The Air Training Corps caters for the high-fliers and the community
service work in hospitals, hostels, schools, and clubs, while the
Conservation Service is involved in a range of projects.
''We lead a very full life at Gordonstoun and it can be very tiring,''
said sixth-year pupil Nicholas Howden from Lancashire. ''If you manage
to get everything done by midnight you are doing well.''
The school day starts with assembly and chapel at 8.20 and then from
8.40 until 2.30 there are normal academic classes with an average pupil
to teacher of 7:1.
For the rest of the afternoon they are involved in ''activities''
which range from rugby, football, and netball to art, music, and
pottery.
The evening involves homework until around 8.30, after which there are
debates, squash games, and a host of other activities for those with any
energy left.
One of the strengths of Gordonstoun, as they see it, is that they
offer the variety to ensure the school produces rounded, independent
individuals rather that ''types''.
''We are trying to develop the strengths of the individuals who come
in using the vast range of things that go on here. We have to be
completely dynamic right across the board in terms of the spectrum of
activity, be it cerebral, physical, or cultural,'' said Mr Thomas.
''You have to relate it to what these youngsters are going to find
when they leave. There is no question we are forward-looking and well
ahead of the game, as was the founder and successive headmasters have
been in looking at what we are doing to meet the particular needs of the
generation coming through.''

Los Angeles
THE jury in the O J Simpson double murder trial begins its
deliberations tomorrow, fully aware the verdict will be closely examined
in a racially-charged city where police are on heightened alert.
Emotions were running high among spectators outside the courthouse on
Friday when Judge Lance Ito handed the case to the 12 jurors to decide
the fate of the black former football star, who is accused of murdering
his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and a friend, Ron Goldman.
If they were not aware of the potential fall-out of their verdict, Ito
reminded them that ''the world is watching'' whether they convict
Simpson of first degree or second degree murder, or if they find him not
guilty.
Police chief Willie Williams, conscious of the volatile nature of a
city not fully healed after the 1992 race riots in which over 50 people
died, said on Friday his force is prepared for any street violence that
may be triggered by the Simpson verdict.
Although he stressed there was no indication there would be civil
unrest after a verdict is returned, Williams took a swipe at the defence
team for potentially inflaming emotions.
During the nine-month trial, lead defence attorney Johnnie Cochran
suggested to the jury of nine blacks, two whites, and one Hispanic, that
Simpson was framed by a white detective, Mark Fuhrman, and that there
was a racist conspiracy within the police department.
In his closing arguments last week, Cochran called Fuhrman, who has
since retired, a ''genocidal racist'' and compared him to Adolf Hitler.
''We're going to have to live with the bile spewed out these past few
months,'' said Williams, a black officer who took over the department
several weeks before the 1992 riots.
That street violence, the worst in the US this century, was triggered
by another trial verdict -- the acquittal of four white police officers
for the videotaped beating of a black man, Rodney King. Two of the
officers were later convicted of federal charges and the case has
seriously hurt the Los Angeles Police Department's image.
Cochran was unrepentant for using what the prosecution has called
''the race card''.
Prosecutors ridiculed the police conspiracy theory and in his closing
argument, Christopher Darden, who is black, told the jury that the best
way to send a message to the police was not to convict Simpson.
''It is true that Mark Fuhrman is a racist. It is also true that this
man killed these two people,'' he said, pointing over his shoulder to
Simpson.
The defendant's fame and race should not effect the way justice is
meted out, Darden told the panel.
The jury, which has been sequestered in a hotel since January 11,
chose a foreman in only five minutes on Friday, but observers expect
them to take at least 10 days to two weeks to reach a verdict.
Judge Ito has cancelled visits from relatives during deliberations
which begin tomorrow, one year and six days since jurors first reported
for the selection process.--Reuter

Lagos
MILITARY ruler Sani Abacha, bowing to international pressure, today
commuted sentences on alleged coup plotters and announced a timetable to
take Nigeria back to democracy -- but not before three years.
In a nationwide radio and television broadcast to mark the 35th
independence anniversary of Africa's most populous country, General
Abacha announced a detailed programme leading to the handover of power
to a democratically-elected government on October 1, 1998.
Britain, Nigeria's former colonial power, cautiously welcomed the
commutal, but regretted the long tenure ahead for General Abacha. The
Foreign Office said it regretted ''a lack of commitment to an early
handover'' to civilian rule.
London's reaction is important to Nigeria, which could be barred from
next month's summit of the Commonwealth of former British colonies, in
New Zealand, over human rights abuses.
The National Conscience Party, led by radical Lagos lawyer Gani
Fawehinmi, dismissed the general's broadcast as ''empty rhetorics''.
''National Conscience Party rejects in its entirety the Abacha agenda,
as everything contained in the broadcast has no element of truth and
cannot be trusted,'' it said in a statement.
Lagos streets were calm with no visible reaction to the broadcast in
which General Abacha did not specify how long the 40 alleged plotters --
who include former ruler retired General Olusegun Obasanjo -- would
spend in jail.
But the announcement meant that for the first time since 1976 Nigeria
would not execute people over a coup plot or attempt.
World leaders had pleaded for clemency for the 40, convicted in July
during a secret trial that outraged the world. Western nations had
warned Nigeria of economic sanctions if anyone was executed.
''In consideration for the earnest pleas of our friends, and in the
spirit of national reconciliation which has been the centrepiece of this
administration's policy, government has decided to commute the sentences
on the coup plotters,'' General Abacha said. ''This situation will be
reviewed at the appropriate time.''
The original sentences were never made public, but Mr Obasanjo was
said to have been given life, while his former deputy Shehu Musa
Yar'Adua and 13 others received death sentences.
Western diplomats said commuting the sentences may save the Nigerian
military government from sanctions over human rights abuses. ''No death
sentences probably means no additional measures, but three years to
restore democracy seems rather long,'' said one.
The general said the case of detained presidential claimant Moshood
Abiola, facing treason charges, would be decided by the court.
Chief Abiola was widely believed to have won a presidential election
which the army annulled in 1993. In June last year, he was detained for
proclaiming himself president.
He was charged with treason in July last year, but the case has since
been stalled in court while there have been worldwide pleas for his
release.
General Abacha restated his long-held view that hid case was judicial,
saying: ''An act of treason is as serious as it is grievious.''
Chief Abiola's senior wife Kudirat reacted with outrage and appealed
for international pressure to free him.
''I am very concerned about his welfare and my principal anxiety is
that General Sani Abacha has already convicted Chief Abiola before the
trial,'' she told reporters in her Lagos home.
''The international community should respond in stronger terms to
force Nigeria to conform with the rule of law,'' she said, adding that
the US, which buys half of Nigeria's crude oil, on which the economy
depends, should impose an embargo.
General Abacha's programme, leading to civil rule in 1998, includes a
series of elections prior to a presidential vote. Reuter

Baghdad
IRAQ today dismissed a newspaper report that it was massing tanks near
the border with Kuwait as part of a campaign being waged against it to
ensure United Nations sanctions are not lifted.
The Sunday Times said Iraq had moved 100 tanks and armoured personnel
carriers into an exclusion zone declared by the United Nations after the
1991 Gulf War which expelled the Iraqi army from Kuwait after a
seven-month occupation.
The report said US defence officials could not decide whether the
build-up meant Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was planning another
invasion.
However, the official Iraqi news agency quoted an Iraqi official in
London as saying the report was ''a fabrication and a desperate attempt
to create an atmosphere of tension in Kuwait. It is part of a
fabrication campaign against Iraq ahead of the next review of UN
sanctions.''
The UN Security Council will soon carry out a regular six-monthly
review of the sanctions which have crippled Iraq's economy.
In Washington, a Pentagon official declined to discuss the substance
of the report but warned: ''We are prepared to take the necessary steps
to protect our interests.''
In Kuwait, Planning Minister and Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs
Abd al-Aziz Dakhil al-Dakhil was quoted by state radio as saying the
emirate was taking the report seriously.
Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 and massed troops on the border
again last year, only to pull them back after a few days.
The Sunday Times report said Iraq had been moving the tanks in small
numbers by night to avoid satellite detection, and that American troops
in the area had picked up signals of heavy traffic.
* UN official Rolf Ekeus left Baghdad today with unanswered questions
about Iraq's secret military programmes, predicting criticism when the
Security Council discusses Iraq later this month.
Ekeus, heading the commission charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction, said he was still not certain all Iraq's banned
missiles and biological and chemical warheads had been scrapped.
''There are issues remaining to be cleared up both in the missiles and
chemical side, and also in the new biological field obviously we have to
verify a number of issues,'' Ekeus said as he left for New York.--Reuter

Manila
TWENTY-nine people were killed and thousands fled to rooftops as a
tropical storm pounded the entire length of the Philippines, triggering
landslides, floods, and mudflows.
''This is a major disaster,'' Defence Secretary Renato de Villa said
after torrents of mud roared down from Pinatubo volcano, isolating
10,000 villagers.
The storm, named Sybil, flattened hundreds of houses, blew down power
and telephone lines and left a trail of blacked out cities and towns.
De Villa said the storm, with winds of 60 mph, first battered parts of
southern Mindanao island on Friday night then churned up the length of
the archipelago, ravaging 30 provinces and more than 20 cities.
President Fidel Ramos who flew to Malaysia earlier today, had to delay
his departure.
Thousands of villagers escaped the mudflows -- locally called lahars
-- by running to the roofs of their houses.
Army helicopters managed to lift off towards nightfall to rescue
several residents and relief officials said the navy was sending rubber
boats and amphibious vehicles to take them to safety.
The 29 dead included 18 people crushed when landslides buried five
houses in the town of Valencia in the mountains of Bukidnon province,
500 miles south of Manila.
A family of four was killed when mudslides in nearby San Pablo city
crushed them inside their house as they slept. Four were electrocuted in
central Iloilo province and in Manila while two drowned in Pampanga and
Nueva Ecija provinces.
About 20 typhoons and storms hit the Philippines every year, making
mudflows a regular menace near Pinatubo. -- Reuter.

Bangkok
TWO Britons, who are alleged to have run a factory manufacturing the
drug ecstasy in Thailand, have been arrested in Bangkok in a crackdown
on designer drugs.
The Britons, who were said to be producing the drugs for Thai yuppies
and holidaymakers on the holiday island of Ko Pha-ngan, face life
imprisonment.
Mr Carl Parker, from Bristol, and Mr Justin Jackson, from Sheffield,
were last night being held in Bangkok's Central Police headquarters
together with an American named as Mr John Chick.
They will also be charged with trafficking in cocaine from South
America to Thailand's affluent middle-class society.
The arrests were made after a long police surveillance in the Patpong
area of Bangkok and a nearby street which contains a mix of fashionable
discotheques and gay bars attended by media personalities and Thai rock
stars.
Mr Parker, 28, had been living in Thailand for three years, most of
them working as a disc-jockey for Radio Bangkok. Mr Jackson, 38, taught
English to employees of the Petroleum Authority of Thailand. Both,
however, gave up their paid jobs several months ago, said police.
Mr Chick was arrested with eight bars of cocaine weighing 55.5g each,
said Thai Police Lt Col Vichai Sangprapai. Mr Parker allegedly had 95
Ecstasy tablets and Mr Jackson allegedly had 349 Ectasy tablets on him
at the time of their arrest. The arrests were made simultaneously in
different apartments in Bangkok.
For several years Thailand, which imposes strict penalties for drugs
offences has turned a blind eye to the goings on on the island of Ko
Pha-ngan, off the province of Surat Thani in South Thailand.
Every month thousands of hippies and lotus eaters flock there for
''Full Moon'' parties or raves.

New York
A JURY today convicted 10 Muslim radicals, including the Egyptian
cleric Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, of conspiring to bomb the United
Nations, tunnels, and a bridge to frighten the United States into
changing its Middle East policies.
The jury also convicted one of the defendants, El Sayyid Nosair, in
the 1990 killing of extremist Rabbi Meir Kahane, an assassination once
described as an isolated attack by a crazed gunman but later as the
opening blow of a ''war of urban terrorism''.
The jurors had deliberated for a week.
Most of the defendants looked on sternly, but one smirked and another
repeatedly yelled in Arabic: ''Allahu Akbar!'' or ''God is great!''
Abdel-Rahman, a blind cleric, kept his head bowed, as he had
throughout the trial, while he listened to an interpreter through
headphones. His lawyer, Lynne Stewart, cried.
Later she told reporters: ''He's not the first person to go to prison
for his beliefs . . . and he won't be the last.''
The verdict concluded a nine-month trial featuring more than 200
witnesses and hundreds of exhibits in a heavily guarded Manhattan
courthouse patrolled daily by a bomb-sniffing dog.
Facing a rarely used Civil War-era seditious conspiracy charge, the
defendants were accused of plotting bombings and killings to make the
United States stop supporting Israel and Egypt, two enemies of militant
Muslims.
The sheikh and Nosair face life in prison; the other eight up to 30
years.
The centrepiece of the plot featured five bombs in 10 minutes, meant
to blow up the United Nations, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the
George Washington Bridge, and a federal building housing the FBI,
according to the government. Videotapes showed defendants mixing bomb
ingredients in a Queens garage just before their 1993 arrests.
The government had cast a wide net with the trial, using an FBI
informant codenamed Dallas to shut down a terrorist cell that
prosecutors said had operated in the United States since 1989.
It cited proof of telephone contact between the sheikh and World Trade
Centre bombers and transcripts of hundreds of taped conversations and
excerpts from speeches in which the Egyptian sheikh said: ''We must
terrorise the enemies of Islam and . . . shake the earth under their
feet.''
Assistant US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said that in 1990, the
57-year-old cleric, months after arriving in the United States, urged
attacks similar to a suicide bombing that killed 241 U.S. Marines and
caused the withdrawal of a peacekeeping force from the Middle East.
He said Abdel-Rahman called the United States ''the No 1 enemy of
Islam''.
Members of the Jihad Organisation allegedly sought to bring a global
holy war to the United States by killing Kahane and bombing the trade
centre.
They then allegedly sought to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, bomb five sites in a single day, and kidnap or kill other
dignitaries. They even discussed kidnapping former US President Richard
Nixon and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
''Terrorism is real. It is here. It is in this courtroom,'' Fitzgerald
told the jury.
In the 1980s, the sheik had been acquitted twice in his homeland of
commanding others to kill Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, who was
assassinated in 1981. He was convicted in his absence last year for a
role in a 1989 anti-government riot and was sentenced to seven years'
hard labour.
Four defendants testified in the trial, but not the sheikh.
It was the second of three of trials stemming from the trade centre
bombing, which killed six people, caused #350m worth of damage, and
diminished the feeling of security among Americans.
Four men were convicted last year in the trade centre bombing and were
sentenced to 240 years in prison.
In a third trial, expected next year, the scope will be widened
further as the government claims that the trade centre bombing was part
of a worldwide terrorism campaign that continued into this year with
plans to bomb aeroplanes from the sky.
That trial will feature the case against Ramzi Yousef, the alleged
mastermind of the trade centre bombing. He was arrested in Pakistan this
year after two years on the run.--AP.

San Francisco
THREE former leaders who played key roles in ending the Cold War --
Mikhail Gorbachev, George Bush, and Baroness Thatcher -- argued today
over the role of the United Nations.
Bush and Lady Thatcher said the United Nations had limitations, while
Gorbachev argued for it to be made more effective as a means for
settling international conflict.
Their debate ended the State of the World Forum, an international
meeting of 500 politicians, scientists, and artists chaired by
Gorbachev.
Bush said the international effort to expel Iraqi forces after the
1991 invasion of Kuwait showed that when the Security Council could
agree, ''the UN can have a very important role in setting international
law''.
''I'm optimistic about the UN but I see its limitations. I don't think
that the UN can solve all the problems,'' he said, adding that Nato and
bi-lateral diplomacy were still needed.
Lady Thatcher said that while the UN passed the resolutions
authorising military action in the Gulf War, the US, Britain, France,
and some Arab states did the fighting.
''The fact is that Saddam Hussein would still be in Kuwait and
probably right down the Gulf and in charge of 60% of the world's oil
reserves unless George Bush and Britain and other nations had taken
action and thrown the tyrant out,'' she said.
She contrasted the swift action against Iraq with the handling of the
Bosnian conflict, which she said had been a ''great mistake''.
''Bosnia should never have been under UN authority but under the
authority of those nations prepared to take action when we might have
resolved it much more quickly.''
Gorbachev, however, defended the UN. ''I believe that the UN alone is
capable of dealing with the tensions, with the possible conflicts and
lack of understanding,'' he said, acknowledging that the world body
needed reform.
There was now a united Germany, while Russia would revive and China
and India were gaining strength, he said.
''Do you think that all of them will agree to being secondary players
and do you think you do not need a format for co-operation with them? I
am sure that we must build a new United Nations with efficient tools for
action,'' he said.--Reuter.

Papeete
FRENCH commandos today seized the Greenpeace ship Manutea in
international waters off Mururoa atoll, just hours before France carried
out the second of its bitterly disputed nuclear weapons tests.
A Defence Ministry statement in Paris said the 110-kilotonne blast was
detonated underground at 11.30pm GMT. It was the second in a series of
six to eight tests breaking France's three-year-old moratorium on
nuclear testing.
A Greenpeace spokesman said the Manutea, ''was seized this morning in
international waters''.
A French military officer said the steel schooner was seized by
commandos after it launched a canoe containing three Polynesian
activists which breached the military exclusion zone around Mururoa.
''The French Navy observed the boat came from the Manutea,'' the
officer said. ''The Manutea was taken in international waters for the
same reason as the MV Greenpeace.''
France seized the supply and communications ship MV Greenpeace in
international waters on September 1, saying a helicopter launched from
the ship had breached the military exclusion zone around Mururoa.
Greenpeace says the seizure of its ships in international waters is
illegal.
Manutea is the fourth Greenpeace protest ship to be seized by French
commandos and the last major Greenpeace ship involved in anti-nuclear
protests off Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls in French Polynesia.
French military said there were 10 people aboard the Manutea and the
three Polynesian activists were also detained.
The move was the latest effort in what appears to be a crackdown on
anti-nuclear and pro-independence activists.
In Tahiti, 750 miles from the test site, the third-ranking figure in
Tahiti's pro-independence party, Athanas Teriitehau, who was accused of
taking part in the riots, was arrested, his lawyer said.
The lawyer, Stanley Cross, said 237 people had been jailed on
riot-related charges.
France has flown 780 more riot police into Papeete in the past few
days as merchants batten down their stores with steel shutters and
doors, fearing renewed riots.--Reuter/AP.

ON one of Petula Clark's dressing-room walls there is photograph which
captures the very alchemy of show business. The face gazing from a plain
black frame could be that of any silent movie goddess. Panda eyes, the
frizz of a curling tongs coiffure, thin perpendicular eye-brows giving
edge to that look of enigmatic anguish. And the lips, of course the
lips, indelibly inked into a tremulous Cupid's bow.
Theda Bara, Pola Negri, Gloria Swanson. . . that face might well
belong to all three. But Petula Clark? The thought seems inconceivable.
Yet she it is, and that is Sunset Boulevard for you. God made man in his
own image; Hollywood turns veteran actresses into Norma Desmond. Even
Clark herself is slightly spooked by the transformation.
But the mask has not entirely made every true-life facial detail
disappear. After so many decades the jaunty beauty spot has found a real
theatrical purpose, dotting the chin of Billy Wilder's mythical
tragedienne. Clark at 63 is now completing her first month in Andrew
Lloyd Webber's musical interpretation of the 1950 Wilder movie, and of
all those who have tackled this particular version of Desmond (Glenn
Close and Elaine Paige among them), she is the oldest and possibly the
performer most experienced at making herself over. So far Clark has
employed three successful career identities: the pert child star; the
virginal coquette; the potent chanteuse, voice filled with yearning and
just a dash of bitters. A classically dramatic progression.
By mid-October Paige, refreshed from holiday and other professional
commitments, will return to the role at the Adelphi Theatre in the
Strand. Clark, meanwhile, will have left London again for New York to
complete her next album and take the opportunity to visit two of her
three children, Bara and Patrick, both students in the States. Kate, her
other daughter, is an interior designer in Paris, adding to the
trans-continental spread of a family remote now from the tight ''little
England'' horizon of Clark's early Epsom days.
Yet the precise location of ''home'' remains a puzzle, even to her.
Claude Wolff, her French husband of 34 years, divides his time doing
business in Paris and the couple's houses in Geneva and the French Alps.
They first met when she was on a promotional tour of France and he was a
record-company publicist. ''He was no Svengali but I did fall in love
with him there and then. As for Claude, I think I sort of grew on him.
I'd arrived with one of these really awful British colds -- red nose,
green complexion, and orange hair from a film I'd been making. I must
have really looked a mess.''
But up to that moment France was among the last countries where Petula
Clark wished to be. She didn't speak the language, she didn't especially
like the place, and she was happy in London. ''I had my sports car and
boy friends, and I was fine.'' The fact was, however, that unless her
career could somehow be reinvented she was in danger of becoming
embalmed in the candy-floss tulle which passed for British glamour in
the fifties.
''At that time the public here just didn't want me to grow up. For
them it was like watching their own youth disappear as I grew older. But
the French knew nothing of my sweet-little-girl image, so I was able to
shed all the cute tricks I'd picked up as a child.'' France, she says,
matured her and by assimilation she learned the artistry of heartbreak
from melodic masters: Piaf, Aznavour, and Brel.
But today she sees herself more as a roving player, touring the world
and meeting up with Claude for scarcely more than holidays and
Christmas. She says this casually but with the kind of polite reserve
which curtains off life's tender corners, prohibiting further
explanation. Then, as an afterthought, she observes that probably
everyone's existence is not quite normal to somebody else. ''Mine seems
perfectly ordinary to me.''
Should we start at the beginning? Since her career began at the age of
six the tale would require at least one volume of biography, and she has
had enough of one already. An unauthorised version, published years ago,
was complimentary but in her view parochial and rather cosy. ''All a bit
dandruffy,'' she said at the time. But the essential facts are these:
she belongs to that generation when star-struck parents dreamed of
turning pretty daughters into Shirley Temple, and her father, Leslie,
very nearly succeeded.
Almost from the moment of her birth, Leslie, an incorrigible romantic,
contrived a theatrical name for her, stitching Pet and Ula together in
memory of two former girl friends. A spot on the wireless led to
overseas tours for the troops -- if Vera Lynn reminded them of
sweethearts, Petula Clark symbolised the children left behind. Then came
her own radio show at the age of 11 and by 12 she had appeared at the
Royal Albert Hall, killing time in the wings by reading comics.
That same year she was signed up as a Rank starlet, all set on the
dubious road to everlasting coyness and light. ''Adolescence was
especially difficult for me because I was really a bit of a tomboy but
that side was never allowed to be seen. Obviously I was more valuable to
Rank as Britain's Little Darling rather than a gawky teenager.''
At least, though, a neat fortune was piling up. Or was it? By the time
she thought to ask her father, now her manager, the money had melted
away in poor investments. She was broke and the only thing for it was to
start afresh and work harder than ever. Petula Clark might never say so,
but it was probably around this time that the demons of insecurity set
about her psyche. ''Even now I'm still very shy and often unsure of
myself. But I think that's all part of making me do what I do. The
moment I lock into this thing we call theatre I leave my problems and
complexes behind.''
Stage work in America, however, has taught her to be a little more
aggressive. ''To be unafraid and to walk into a room confidently, that's
what America is all about. It's still a problem for me because I
belonged to that British generation which was brought up to think it
wasn't nice to be sure of yourself. That just doesn't work in the
States.''
But it is wrong, she insists, to hear in her story some echo of Norma
Desmond's. The Sunset Boulevard protagonist lives every moment in denial
of reality, refusing to believe her audience has vanished. In contrast
Clark's own in-built lack of confidence has always made her sensibly
aware of the two-faced nature of fame. Her career switches -- from the
frilliness of Our Pet warbling life's cares away to the funky hipster
belting out Downtown, her biggest hit -- have all responded more to fact
than fantasy. Long before the public wanted it she sought her most
dramatic costume changes to survive.
In reality she is the most unstarry person, free of all those
ornamental gestures which often spill over on to actors when off stage.
Yet her performance in Sunset is mesmeric. Paige plays Norma Desmond
with camp flourish. Clark brings out the trembling loneliness,
accentuates the bleakness of Desmond in her Pharoah's tomb.
But the life of a play is the life of the unconscious and here is also
the poignant make-believe of a Tin Pan Alley child grown old: ''I have
my own theories about Desmond,'' says Clark. ''She started in this
business when she was 16, probably abandoned by her parents and later by
men. But she was a sexual woman who had been both adored and adorable.''
Spoiled and possessive in her terror of rejection, Desmond finally
only exists through the clothes and make-up of her prime. ''It happens
in this business, but it can also happen to women anywhere. I once saw a
wonderful interview with Jane Fonda where she recalled a traumatic
breakdown in her life and at one point she had hysterics. In the middle
of all the tears she suddenly caught sight of herself and said: 'Ah, so
that's what it's like.' In a way that's awful but there are real
experiences which an actor logs for later use.''
The process of digging into memory, however, can be painful. ''There
are moments in Sunset Boulevard where Norma has a sort of panic attack.
At first I thought I'd never seen anyone go through that, then I
remembered I'd suffered something similar a long time ago. So you drag
it all back and that can be exceptionally painful but it helps to make a
role authentic.''
Clark is sitting by an open window in her lemon-tinted dressing-room,
two hours before her first entrance at the Adelphi. It will take her 20
intense minutes to apply her Nora Desmond face and for that she will
require solitary confinement. ''Right through rehearsals I couldn't find
any connection with this woman. I just thought I was wrong for the part.
I had never sought it and I can't even remember saying 'Yes, I'll do
it'. But Trevor Nunn, the director, was always very encouraging and as
soon as we got the make-up on everything changed. The make-up artist did
an extraordinary thing, just painting one half of my face as Norma and
leaving the other half as me. Suddenly I saw this other person staring
back from the mirror. It wasn't Petula Clark any longer, and I knew we'd
be all right.''
Just now, though, Clark looks rather like a reflective teacher from
the Sorbonne. Her ash-grey hair is in the fluffy disarray of someone who
believes hair styles inconsequential. Her freckled face is entirely
cleansed of cosmetics, and she is wearing a long black and white skirt
with a Provencal flower-print, black jacket and thick black stockings
and moccasins. Tonight she will have 10 swift costume changes, all that
heavy 1920s motley becoming a potential death trap in those agitated ups
and downs on Sunset's sweeping staircase.
The phone rings. A friend hopes to drop by to say hello. ''I'd love
that, really,'' she says, ''but I'm just not seeing anyone between
performances. This part is so exhausting I've got to conserve my energy
and rest the voice. Anyway, I look like a gargoyle at the moment.''
To some extent this is Petula Clark protecting an interior life. There
is also an aspect to her work which is never observed by public: her
United Nations duties lobbying foreign governments on behalf of
refugees. ''Right now the problem is so huge there is practically a
whole nation of displaced people,'' she says. ''Very often the camps are
horrendous and dirty but there are tremendously admirable people doing
the best they can with scant resources.'' And, although she's loath to
discuss it, her own commitment isn't just the decorous handing over of
petitions to the powerful. In Malaysia and Africa Petula Clark has got
down on her knees and scrubbed the wrecked and fetid world of exile.
''I've wasted a lot of my time doing nothing very much,'' she says
reflectively. ''I don't ever want to do that again.'' There is a
repeated lyric in Sunset Boulevard which claims of Norma Desmond: She's
never known the meaning of surrender. Next January Petula Clark will
climb back into Desmond's doomed skin at the Adelphi, and stay there for
the year, making that line, above all others, very positively her own.

NEXT month's Budget could make or break the Conservatives' chances of
retaining power against the formidable Labour challenge. The Chancellor,
Kenneth Clarke, tells Geoffrey Parkhouse, Political Editor, that 1995 is
the ''key year'' when he has to get all his judgments right. He is
constrained by market sensitivity to his fiscal proposals for November
28, but he is uninhibited about a Scottish Parliament with tax raising
powers. He is opposed to it as an unnecessary extra burden of taxation
and government. He may not be able to reduce the overall burden of
taxation by much this year, but he hopes to simplify the way some of
this tax is paid. And he rejects changes that would be damaging to
Scotland in the way that money is apportioned by his Treasury.
Q: One of your back benchers came up with the idea that Scotland's
apportionment of money from the Exchequer should be on a per capita
basis rather than need. The Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth told us:
''Over my dead body.'' Would it be over your dead body too?
A: If there was any change in the system for Scotland's money to per
capita, I think you probably would get a few Labour members from the
North and a few Conservative members from the North-east and a few
Conservative members from the South-east saying that. But we have this
system of allocating money for Scotland. I think its generous. I have to
say that I think Scotland does well out of the deal, but we do have a
basic understanding about how we allocate money for Scotland and
personally I have no intention of going back on that, neither does the
Government. We could consider convergence over the long term. I actually
do think that Scotland, compared to England, is provided for very
favourably. I genuinely believe . . . I am trying to set aside that I am
an Englishman myself . . . I actually think Scotland does very well out
of the deal. Nevertheless there is a formula, there is an understanding
and my discussions with Michael Forsyth and William Waldegrave's
discussions with him are on that basis. Any English Conservative member
who raises a change -- forget it. We are not moving to per capita.
Q: Is it feasible to have a Scottish Parliament without tax-raising
powers?
A: I am not going to be subject to this Scottish Parliament. As a
friendly observer, I can't for the life of me see why anyone should want
it. It doesn't turn Scotland from a nation into a nation-state. You get
an additional local organisation which is given some special tax-raising
powers to levy tax on its population. And I'm glad to say that we have
beaten off the Labour Party from a lot of rubbish about East Midlands
regional assemblies. In my part of the world I can assure you that the
inhabitants of Nottinghamshire want it like a hole in the head. What
special status or feeling of pride the Scots derive from prospects of
paying a higher rate of income tax compared to the income tax that
people get in the South I cannot imagine.
Q: They would be able to reduce taxation, if they felt so inclined.
A: In my experience of local government, I have never known anybody
with tax raising powers say that they actually wish to reduce taxation.
I hate to agree with the Nationalists, but it is neither fish nor fowl
what is proposed. In one respect I do agree with the Nationalists that
this falls neatly between two stools. They see it as a step on the way
to independence; but it isn't independence, it is actually still in the
Union. It is a new tax-levying local body. And so you wind up with a
Scottish nation which is not a nation state but for some reason
requiring an additional level of government and taxation compared to the
rest of the United Kingdom.
Q: So you don't see it, a Scottish Parliament able to have tax-raising
powers?
A: I am opposed to the idea of a Scottish Parliament having tax
raising-powers. I think it is a pretty silly idea. I would have thought
that the people who are likely to pay extra tax will think it a silly
idea as well. Everybody has their views about the level of taxation, but
why people in one of the countries of the United Kingdom should say that
we want the unique right to pay a higher level of taxation, whatever
earnings we have, I cannot understand.
Q: There is a suggestion that if the Scottish people had an additional
tax levy on themselves, they would taxation more seriously and react
accordingly with their politicians.
A: The rate of taxation should involve some onus of the need to
constrain spending, that is true. I don't find that is always the case
with county councils in the south. The advocates for a Scottish
Parliament get wonderfully indignant about comparisons
with regional or local government in the south, but I just think its
another tier of local government with a bigger territory with more
tax-raising powers.
Q: Where is it that Scotland can be involved about taxation and this
balance between what Scotland gets from the Exchequer and vice versa?
A: I think the key thing about Scotland which gives it a far more
devolved measure of government than a lot of Scots appreciate is that I
do not attempt to influence the way in which Michael Forsyth spends his
money. The settlement that I shall be arriving at with Michael is a
block of money. A Scottish block. The Scottish Office is a kind of mini
government within a government. The Scottish Office is always a slight
law unto itself. The result is that when Michael Forsyth gets his money
the decisions about how it is spent are taken in Scotland and the
pattern of spending in Scotland are different to the patterns in the
South. And I am sure that he would argue that this reflects the
different needs and the different distribution of the population. So the
British Treasury does not attempt to determine the pattern of spending
in Scotland. All that is determined in Scotland.
Q: One of the arguments about Scotland having its own tax powers is
that we could get down to some real simplification of the tax. Have we
any chance in the next year or two of really radical simplification of
taxation?
A: I don't know yet. Simplification is highly desirable. It's
something we have got to concentrate on, particularly as we move towards
self assessment which is going to be quite a big challenge. It drives us
to make it simple so that it works and produces the benefits. The last
two Budgets I have had, I will admit, paid little regard to
simplification because the main thing I had to do was to raise some
revenue and cut public spending in order to stop us borrowing too much.
I shall look at simplification again in this Budget. But you have got to
be careful about tax experts who come in telling you about simplifying
the tax system in order to produce a moderately perfect structure which
is pleasing to them as purists. The question I always ask when people
come in with a simplification proposal is which taxpayers gain and which
taxpayers lose. And you find that quite a lot of the advisers who come
in in the interests of neatness are less concerned about the fact that
some people will end up paying more and some people will pay less. As a
politician I have to ask ''just tell me who the losers are'', because I
shall certainly hear from them once we have simplyfied the system.
Q: Do you have any strong personal views about the neccesity to
seperate national insurance from income tax?
A: I have always believed that the national insurance system is
beneficial because it links your entitlement with a contribution. It's a
misnoma. Its not an insurance system at all, you pay for it as you go
along. Nevertheless people do understand that they have a stake in what
they are going to get. Its almost a popular tax because people are
prepared to contribute, thinking of the benefits they are going to get.
Having said that they are both different forms of taxes on earnings.
Most employers you talk to about this complain like mad about the
complications of having to work out both their PAYE and national
insurance contributions. As part of the deregulation simplification we
are making the two work together. And I would like to make the rules
closer together so that it's all less complicated. Anyone contemplating
starting a new business is that they get two huge piles of literature
from the two agencies involved which someone has got to master . . .
doing the PAYE, doing the national insurance, and also I might add,
doing the VAT. I was once a registered trader for VAT, so I do think
that making VAT more user-friendly is a good idea. That's not
simplification of the tax system as an attempt to simplify the way we
deal with the taxpayer without of course making it easier for people to
fiddle.
Q: A lot of the bad feeling that is about is caused by people saying
what's the point of an income tax reduction if my spending taxes are
going up so much.
A: I think that is quite important. We had from before 1979 -- I can
remember Iain MacLeod as Shadow Chancellor going on about shifting the
burden of direct to indirect taxation. The case for that is the accepted
case that if you take less of every extra pound that somebody earns he
feels more satisfaction and puts in extra effort to earning the extra
pound. It sounds simple and it does have an effect. And I think one of
the reasons that we are performing better now as a market economy is we
just take less of the extra pound. I have never evoked Iain MacLeod as
Shadow Chancellor before . . . I am a lifelong follower of Iain MacLeod.
When he was Shadow Chancellor we were facing a standard rate of over 40p
in the pound. Everybody thinks that all barristers earn a kings ransom,
but I was a young barrister and I didn't earn all that much and I got
into a surtax that was above 40p in the pound. You could end up paying a
huge percentage of your income. I was a broke young barrister, so I was
trying to earn money. There is absolutely no doubt that a modern economy
requires marginal rates, as far as the basic rate is concerned, lower
than the one we have got. We have now got 25%. At 40%, the higher rate
is about right. I am convinced, whatever Tony Blair might say, that he
will bung up the higher rate of tax. That does have a damaging effect on
an enterprise economy. The higher rate is paid by people not earning a
king's ransom, but in quite responsible jobs -- secondary school
headmasters, most of them pay the higher rate of tax. Marginal rates do
matter. Now I'm a believer in the welfare state. I find it astonishing
when some commentators describe me as left wing because I say that I
believe in free national health service which is the best method of
delivering health care in the world. I believe in a state education
system, driving up its quality and I believe in a modern safety-net
welfare state that we can afford. We have taken off some taxation but
there has to be a limit to taking down the overall burden of taxation.
We the Conservatives kept it down far lower than the other modern states
in Western Europe now. But we will do are best to get the overall burden
of taxation down.
Q: Do you think that the balance is about right at the moment?
A: Between direct and indirect tax? We'll have to wait and see how
Budgets unfold. I can't anticipate the Budget, but most of my speeches,
when I talk about the sort of tax system I would like, my long-term
aims, as opposed to talking about this year's Budget, I am still in
favour in getting the balance between direct and indirect taxation
right. I just think that the Government should'nt take too much out of
your pay packet.
Q: How about a windfall tax on the utilities? The way Gordon Brown
sets it out, this could be a very popular political idea. But you appear
to have squashed it.
A: I have said nothing about a windfall tax. In the speculative world
outside, it appears to be tax of the week. If we carry on between now
and the end of November having tax of the week in the newspapers no
doubt it will help me very much with my choices, but I am not going to
comment on that.
Q: The Treasury Chief Secretary, William Waldegrave, said on BBC TV
the weekend before last that the Conservatives would know in the next
six months if they have a serious chance of winning the next election
and that the November 28 Budget is crucially important to this. How do
you feel about having this win-or-lose responsibility on your shoulders?
A: The Budget is a crucial part of economic policy. I have said that I
thought that 1995 was my key year for all the right judgements on
monetary policy, which means interest rates and fiscal policy, which
means the Budget. I just have to say absolutely nothing, give no hints
about the Budget. One thing that dominates my judgement, I am not just
looking at November and the hoo-haa that surrounds a Budget, the key
thing is to deliver a growing, recovering economy that's going to make
us all bettter off and our jobs more secure.
Q: That doesn't sound very exciting.
A: It may not sound exciting, but it matters a hell of a lot. I want
people -- let me take a date at random -- by the end of 1996 or early
1997, to realise that they are living in a successful, enterprise
economy, to feel that they and their families are getting better off and
to realise that with a Conservative government they are going to get
better off still. That is what I think the Labour Party can't beat and
they haven't the first idea about how to set about challenging that
analysis.

The darling couple of British showbusiness have separated. GAVIN BELL
looks at the rocky road which led from passion to parting for Kenneth
Branagh and Emma Thompson
THE writing was on the wall -- or at least in the pages of a biography
-- at the end of last year. The marriage of Kenneth Branagh and Emma
Thompson got off to a rocky start, according to the book, it was under
mounting strain from heavy work schedules and rumours of affairs, and it
would be tough to hold together.
Less than a year after the publication of Ken and Em by Ian
Shuttleworth, the golden couple of British showbusiness have justified
its doubts about whether their relationship could survive the intense
pressures and glamorous liaisons of their respective careers.
Long periods of time spent apart was the principal reason given for
their separation, which was said to be amicable but painful. This is
understandable -- any marriage would be strained by such prolonged
absences -- the wonder is that theirs lasted as long as it did.
Ken and Em have carved out brilliant careers together, and
independently of one another, despite coming from very different
backgrounds. Branagh grew up in Reading, where his dad was a joiner.
Thompson was raised in the more rarefied atmosphere of Hampstead, where
her father was an author and narrator of the Magic Roundabout television
series. Her mother is the classical actress, Phyllida Law. Branagh went
to a comprehensive school in Reading, while Thompson graduated from
Newnham College at Cambridge.
It was the Fortunes of War -- the TV adaptation of the Balkan Trilogy
-- that brought them together across the class divide in 1987, first as
co-stars and ultimately as man and wife. They married two years later,
hosting a #30,000 party for 200 guests at Cliveden House near
Maidenhead, and the society columnists prepared to confer on them the
mantle of Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. In a comment that has come
back to haunt her, Thompson said: ''Meeting, falling in love, and
marrying Ken, is what really matters to me. I'm very happy and very
lucky.''
But according to Shuttleworth's book, the marriage almost did not take
place. After two years together Thompson discovered Branagh had been
having an affair with another actress. She stormed off to New York,
declaring that she never wanted to see him again. Branagh promptly
followed her and demonstrated his love for her in the most conclusive
way, by asking her to marry him. The circumstances of the proposal, the
author notes dryly, ''could have been happier''.
This little misunderstanding behind them, the newly-weds embarked on
glittering careers which were greeted with a mixture of applause, envy,
and disdain. Together and individually they were box-office successes,
and they won prestigious awards, but some critics continued to sneer at
them as ''fashionable luvvies''.
After co-starring in a series of films, notably the critically
acclaimed Much Ado About Nothing, their careers began to diverge. While
Thompson was filming a big-budget Hollywood comedy with Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Branagh was returning to Shakespeare as Iago in a remake
of Othello. While Thompson was fluttering around the bright lights of
Los Angeles, making five films in two years, her husband was drawn more
to the classical vistas of Tuscany. They were, as their joint statement
announced yesterday, drifting apart.
Given the nature of their work, the long separations, and the artistic
circles in which they moved, it was inevitable that rumours of
infidelities would surface. Several duly did in Shuttleworth's book.
Branagh was said to have had an affair with Helena Bonham-Carter during
the making of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein -- a suggestion later
vigorously denied by the actress.
Thompson was reported to have had liaisons with Denzel Washington and
Keanu Reeves on the set of Much Ado About Nothing, and for good measure
Washington was also said to have had an affair with Branagh. The latest
gossip, reported by a Sunday newspaper, is that Thompson is being
accompanied by Greg Wise, a 29-year-old actor whom she met on the set of
Sense and Sensibility.
Given her hectic work schedule, and the intrusive glare of publicity
on her private life, it was hardly surprising when she was reported to
have checked into an expensive health clinic this year suffering from
exhaustion. Reports that her marriage has been effectively over for
months suggest that this may have contributed to her breakdown.
On the eve of her wedding, Thompson told reporters: ''I see us as
having something that is full of little bits of gold. I don't ever see
myself giving away those little bits of gold.'' The golden era is over
for the illustrious couple, and it remains to be seen how they will fare
in their respective careers.
Critics suggest that as an actor Branagh has not lived up to the
promise of his early years, and his work as a film director is still
experimental. Thompson, for all her plaudits for Howards End, Remains of
the Day, and Carrington, is judged by some to be less of an actress than
Vanessa Redgrave and Maggie Smith. Even as a couple, they were deemed to
have lacked natural glamour. They were not another Olivier and Leigh,
the critics said, let alone a Bogie and Bacall.
So there are those who will conclude that this marriage was much ado
about nothing after all. Yet it was a passionate affair, that fuelled an
extraordinary dynamism between two talented artists. We should be
grateful for their dangerous liaison, if saddened by its ending.

Paris
SUSPECTED Muslim guerrillas attacked a bus carrying civilians in
southern Algeria today, killing 18 people and wounding 15.
The attackers struck about 9am in the southern province of Laghouat,
205 miles from Algiers.
Security forces moved in and killed four of the assailants, according
to the statement which did not number the attackers.
In separate incidents, security forces have killed 30 Muslim militants
in nine regions across the country.
The bus attack, part of mounting violence ahead of contested
presidential elections due in November, is the most deadly assault on
civilians so far.
Eleven people were shot dead on January 11 when suspected militants
ambushed a bus carrying workers in the mountainous province of Batna.
Another four people were shot dead in the same month in the same
province when gunmen sprayed bullets at worshippers leaving a mosque at
the end of evening prayers.
The army-backed government is striving to rally more than 12 million
would-be voters to turn out for the presidential poll.
Each presidential hopeful must have collected 75,000 signatures by
tomorrow from at least 25 of the country's 48 provinces to be eligible
to contest the November 16 poll.
More than 40,000 people have been killed in almost four years of
violence in Algeria, pitting army-backed government forces against
Muslim guerrillas.
The conflict started after the authorities cancelled a general
election in January 1992 which the Islamists were poised to win.
LYONS: Youths burned about 30 cars, broke windows, and pelted police
with stones in the Lyons suburb of Vaulx-en-Velin two days after a
native son and prime bombing suspect was killed.
Khaled Kelkal, a 24-year-old Algerian suspected of links to Muslim
militant groups, was killed on Friday night by paratroopers after a
spectacular manhunt.
Kelkal was thought to have organised six bombings and attempts in
France since July, killing seven and wounding hundreds.--Reuter/AP.

TBILISI
A MAN hijacked a bus in Georgia today, shot dead a woman, and set off
a grenade which killed a male passenger before security forces seized
him.
At least 10 of the 35 passengers were hurt, six of them seriously, a
police source said.
Acting Security Minister Avtandil Ioseliani said the lone hijacker
threw the dead woman's body out of the window after seizing the bus in
Kutaisi in the west of the former Soviet republic bordering the Black
Sea.
He was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying police and security
forces followed the bus 125 miles to the edge of the capital Tbilisi
before a special Omega force tried to ''nullify'' the hijacker.
Witnesses said the security forces had surrounded the bus after it
came to a halt after running out of fuel. But they said the hijacker had
detonated the grenade and jumped off the bus before any of the security
forces went on board.
Tbilisi police chief Demur Mikadze also said the hijacker let off the
grenade and jumped out of the bus. He was then arrested.
Ioseliani named the hijacker as 28-year-old Gia Tkemaladze from
Rustavi, near Tbilisi.
He said Tkemaladze seized the bus after a brawl with three passengers,
including the woman who was shot dead. He had made no demands and the
motive for the crime was not known.
''We think he was psychologically disturbed,'' said a police source.
Bus hijacks have become widespread in the former Soviet Union,
especially in lawless parts of southern Russia near rebel Chechnya,
which neighbours Georgia. -- Reuter.

Tbilisi
GEORGIAN authorities accused former Security Minister Igor Georgadze
and Russian ''extremists'' of masterminding a recent foiled attempt to
kill leader Eduard Shevardnadze.
Kviraya suggested Georgadze had acted on the orders of ''reactionary
forces'' in Russia in the August 29 bomb attack in which Shevardnadze,
the former Soviet foreign minister who helped end the Cold War, escaped
with facial cuts.
''Georgadze is very close with (Russian President Boris) Yeltsin's
opponents,'' he said.
Kviraya also said Georgadze had ties to the Mkhedrioni (Horsemen)
paramilitary group, long accused of involvement in extortion rackets in
Georgia in recent years.
Shevardnadze later addressed the meeting at the Council of Ministers
building in central Tbilisi. He said Russia had agreed to extradite
Georgadze to Georgia to face trial.
Shevardnadze also announced that he had stripped the Mkhedrioni,
headed by flamboyant former warlord Jaba Ioseliani, of its official
designation as a ''rescue corps'' -- removing its last vestige of
legitimacy.
Georgadze, a former officer in the Soviet KGB security police, fled to
Moscow shortly after being sacked as Georgia's Security Minister after
the blast.--Reuter.

Cairo
THE 2200-year-old Pharos lighthouse -- one of the Seven Wonders of the
World -- has been discovered lying in the Mediterranean Sea, but may
never be recovered because of its immense size, archaeologists said
today.
It was found by French and Egyptian divers who are completing a
three-month survey charting a 24,000sq yd patch of seabed off the
Egyptian port city of Alexandria.
This week, the divers are to begin bringing up a group of statues that
have been submerged for centuries, part of a treasure trove of hundreds
of ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Hellenic statues.
During dives the team confirmed the Pharos lighthouse was among the
ruins off Egypt's second-largest city, founded by Alexander the Great.
The white marble building stood 400ft high and its giant lantern,
probably magnified by a reflecting device, could be seen over 35 miles.
Earthquakes brought portions crashing down in 1100 and 1307, when the
lighthouse was demolished.
The expedition became a race against time when the Egyptian government
said it may resume the dumping of concrete blocks to build a sea wall to
protect a 15th-century fort on the beach. Work was suspended in 1993,
after an outcry from archaeologists.
The recovery of 20 to 30 statue pieces is to begin on Wednesday.
Divers have already begun fixing cables to the statues, expedition
spokesman Colin Clement said.
A crane will drag them from the water in an operation that could take
days. The recovery of one of the pieces, a huge sphinx, may prove
especially difficult, Mr Clement warned.
But no attempts will be made to retrieve the lighthouse because the
blocks that made up the ancient building are simply too big.

Moroni
FRANCE sent warships towards the Comoro islands today, three days
after the government of President Said Mohamed Djohar was overthrown by
French mercenary Bob Denard.
Foreign journalists in the seaside capital Moroni said one warship had
already appeared off the coast but made no attempt to enter the port.
French military officials said several more were trailing behind.
France has said it would not intervene unless its estimated 1500
nationals there were in danger.
However in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, African diplomats said Paris
was coming under pressure from African governments to step in and remove
Denard.
''The man is a responsibility of France and Paris has a duty to remove
him and his fellow criminals from the Comoros,'' an African diplomat
said.
In Paris, a French military spokesman said French forces were still on
alert in the region. He said measures had been taken ''to ensure if
necessary the safety of our citizens''.
France has about 4000 troops in Djibouti, on its island of La Reunion,
and on Mayotte, a Comoro island which stayed French when the other three
islands voted for independence from Paris in 1975.
The Foreign Ministry has said that French citizens on the islands have
not been threatened.
Prime Minister Alain Juppe said on Friday that there was ''no question
of a military intervention'' despite appeals from the ousted government.
However government sources say that President Jacques Chirac has not
ruled it out.
France has a 1978 defence agreement with the Comoros, dealing in
particular with ''external aggression''.
The Organisation of African Unity has condemned the ouster of Djohar
and demanded the return to democratic rule in the Comoros.
In the Comoros yesterday, hundreds of euphoric Comorans staged a
colourful rally to celebrate the overthrow of Djohar, but opposition
party officials demanded the departure of Denard and his white ''dogs of
war''.
Many citizens said they accepted new military strongman Combo Ayouba's
promise that his Interim Military Committee would organise polls within
two weeks.-- Reuter.

Lisbon
PORTUGAL'S Socialists stormed to victory today in elections that ended
a decade in opposition.
As the official count neared its end, the centre-left party conceded
that it would fall slightly short of an overall majority in the 230-seat
Parliament, but pledged to work with what it had.
''We are going to win a little under 44% which will be the biggest
vote in our history,'' said Socialist leader Antonio Guterres. A vote of
45% is generally regarded as necessary for an outright majority.
''I congratulate the Socialists for their indisputable victory,''
ruling Social Democrat leader Fernando Nogueira told a news conference.
''I offer my best wishes to Antonio Guterres for his government and my
sincere desire that it will be good for Portugal,'' he added.
He promised that the centre-right PSD, which won absolute majorities
in Parliament in 1987 and 1991, would be a ''constructive and
responsible'' opposition.
His party won around 34% of the vote.
Outgoing Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, who had handed over the
PSD leadership to Nogueira in February, also saluted the Socialist win
and praised Nogueira, saying he had ''fought like a hero''.
Jubilant Socialist leaders had earlier claimed victory with half of
the ballots counted.
''Portugal will have a new Prime Minister,'' said spokesman Jaime
Gama.
''This is the best electoral performance in the party's history,''
said Socialist campaign co-ordinator Jorge Coelho. ''We're going to have
a stable government, and we're going to govern alone. We will have no
alliances or coalitions.''
The victorious party had had little to celebrate since President Mario
Soares, a socialist, was premier between 1983 and 1985.
''This is a very, very happy night,'' said one beaming supporter
outside the party's headquarters, while horn-tooting motorists filled
Lisbon's streets.
Triumphant Socialist supporters filled the main thoroughfare, the
Avenida de Liberdade, waving the party's red-and-white flags.
The party, led by 46-year-old engineer Guterres, is pledged to free
market policies and financial markets have reacted calmly to the
possibility of the PSD losing power.
Industry leaders were equally sanguine.
''We are not worried . . . we just want a government as soon as
possible,'' said the head of the Portuguese industrialists' association,
Pedro Ferraz da Costa.
Portugal has bad memories of minority rule after suffering the
turbulence of 16 governments in 13 years between the 1974 revolution and
Cavaco Silva's first absolute majority in the 1987 elections.
However political commentators say much has changed since the days of
the revolving-door governments and that even if the Socialists failed to
win outright parliamentary control, there was now a high degree of
agreement between the leading parties on important issues.--Reuter/AP.

TRANSPORT Minister Steven Norris yesterday admitted that many
businesses had suffered from the recession, which he said was a direct
result of Tory policies.
Mr Norris, 50, announced on Saturday he would be standing down at the
next election in order to rebuild his own business interests which had
run into difficulties during the recession years.
The Minister, who sold out his share of his car sales business to his
partner in 1991, retaining only a small stake, said he was leaving
Parliament for ''straightforward financial reasons''.
''I was in the position that a lot of my colleagues were in, that I
was able to bank a fairly sizeable cheque before I worried about my
parliamentary salary,'' he said on televesion.
''For nobody's fault but my own, my business is not able to do that
now and, therefore, having hugely enjoyed myself in politics, I'm going
off to do something else.''
Although he did not blame the Government for his own difficulties, he
made it clear that he thought it was the policies pursued during the
1980s under Chancellor Nigel Lawson that had caused many of the
difficulties facing businesses now.
''The reasons for the recession in the early 1990s are now a matter of
record. The boom in the 1980s -- the Lawson boom -- clearly caused a
great deal of difficulty for some businesses,'' he said.
''To try to rewrite history now would be incredibly specious. Clearly
the damage was done. If I were somehow to deny that, there would be a
great many people out there who've suffered far worse than me who would
be extremely angry, and rightly so.''
Mr Norris, who gained instant notoriety two years ago when it was
disclosed that he had five mistresses as well as a wife, denied he was
quitting because of the press reporting of his private life.
''One thing you've got to remember about the tabloids is that they're
going to spend a lot longer on the bottom of a bird's cage than they are
in people's hands,'' he said.
''There's such nonsense in the tabloids. I enjoy them incidentally --
how can you not? -- but you mustn't take them too seriously.''

<HEADLINE>Bid to strengthen EU relations with America</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>976093444</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is to back an ambitious new plan for strengthening relations
with America as a counterweight to increasing EU integration.
The bid for a revived transatlantic partnership, the brainchild of
Euro-Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, is in line with demands made by
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, who will endorse its aims at talks in
Luxembourg today.
It answers increasing British concern about the end of the ''special
relationship'' and ensures Europe's traditional transatlantic ties are
not overlooked as the EU struggles over the scale of its own political
and economic links.
Sir Leon, commissioner for external economic relations, will be
reporting to a meeting of EU foreign ministers on the US feedback to his
package of 200 measures for strengthening ties between the EU and the
US.
Senior EU officials spent the weekend negotiating in Washington and
the aim now is approval of a comprehensive transatlantic deal ready for
endorsement by President Bill Clinton at an EU-US summit scheduled for
early December in Madrid.
Sir Leon's 19-page document envisages far closer transatlantic
co-operation in everything from international security and disarmament
to dismantling trade barriers and working together in the fight against
organised crime, terrorism, and drug trafficking -- what the Americans
call the ''drugs and thugs'' policy.
The long-term goal could be a transatlantic free-trade area --
although the prospect has already raised fears that the rest of the
world would see such a deal as a trade carve-up between the two richest
zones in the world.
Sir Leon, whose job involves tackling his share of trade problems with
the Americans, has stopped short of that in his initial proposals,
anxious first to evaluate the response from the Americans.
The response from the EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg will be
positive -- particularly from Mr Rifkind who sees the plan as a welcome
antidote to too much Europe.

CORNCRAKES, secretive farmland birds, are making a slow come-back from
the threat of extinction following special care measures by farmers and
conservationists.
The birds, which are related to moorhens, used to be widespread in the
countryside but a dramatic decline linked with modern agricultural
methods drove them towards extinction.
The population is now virtually confined to Scottish islands, where
farming methods are more traditional.
It has taken a special project, which this year cost #300,000, to halt
a decrease there too.
A report to a review meeting in Glasgow yesterday shows that, after a
5% increase in the number of corncrakes last year, numbers this year
were thought to have grown by 15% -- taking the figures back to the 1988
level.
This was a total of just 574 calling males -- their distinctive
rasping calls are the best way to estimate how many are present. In
1993, the number was down to 446.
The growth in numbers was announced by the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds, which has been working with Scottish Natural
Heritage and the Scottish Crofters Union.
Urging more farmers to take part, Scottish RSPB director Stuart
Housden said that ''with sensitive management, goodwill, and all-round
co-operation, we have a real chance of reversing the long-term
decline''.
For four years, crofters and farmers have been paid to cut hay or
silage after July 31, and encouraged to use mowing techniques which
reduce risks to grass-dwelling creatures from farm machinery.

* High-flying executives are getting smaller pay-offs when they crash
to earth, according to a survey by career consultants DBM.
Their average severance pay-off is now 3.1 weeks for every year of
service, compared with 4.1 weeks in 1989.
However, the well-paid British executive is still at about the
half-way place in the international league table.
He is well ahead of counterparts in the United States, where the
average pay-off is 1.2 weeks for every year, but trails bosses in
Venezuela where it is an extraordinary 21.3 weeks for every year.
The figures, published yesterday, are based on the 10,000 executives
internationally, 425 in Britain, to whom DBM gave counselling last year.
DBM added that the executives it encountered were those valued highly
enough by their firms to be given outplacement counselling -- employees
not offered counselling were probably getting less.

THERE comes a point during a hike when you would gladly sell your soul
for a foot massage.
People who take on the might of the West Highland Way, 98 miles of
undulating terrain, can do just that.
This summer, they have had the chance to experience the revitalising
skills of massage therapist Sarah Miller.
The 28-year-old masseuse began her enterprise in July, and reckons she
has rubbed hundreds of pairs of exhausted feet back to health at
Bienglass Farm, near Inverarnan, and Crianlarich Youth Hostel.
''It really does help. I make the walkers take off their boots, bathe
their feet in warm water laced with peppermint oil, and then massage
their feet with vitamin E cream. It is very relaxing and totally
revitalising.''
However, she adds: ''A lot of the hardened walkers don't want to take
off their boots. Some are a little proud to admit they could do with a
foot massage and others are just embarrassed about their feet.''

SHELTER, the Scottish campaign for homeless people, last night warned
that mortgage interest benefit changes could result in increased debt,
repossessions, and homelessness.
From today, people taking out a mortgage will be affected by the
changes in benefit.
If they become unemployed, they will not be eligible to receive income
support to cover mortgage costs until nine months has passed. At
present, some state support is available straight away and covers full
interest payments after 16 weeks.
The Government has said it expects borrowers to take out private
mortgage insurance to cover the initial nine-month period. However, Ms
Kate Caskie, depute director (Communications) of Shelter Scotland, said
she was concerned that private insurance would not bridge the gap.
Ms Caskie said: ''Our experience through our housing advice work is
that not everyone who is able to get a mortgage will also be eligible
for full insurance protection.
''We have seen examples of people who thought they were covered for
loss of income only to find an escape clause for the insurance company
in the small print of the policy. The result is increased arrears,
increased repossessions, and increased homelessness.''
She added that the Government should work with the insurance industry
to promote model policies and to ensure that independent information and
advice is available to new homebuyers.
Ms Caskie said current insurance policies cost between #5 and #7 a
week.

SUPERMARKET chief David Sainsbury benefited from a #37m shares
windfall in the past year -- more than a hundred times his #362,000
salary.
Figures published today reveal that Sainsbury's chairman heads a
league of company chiefs who were given #137m in dividend payments.
Mr Sainsbury topped the dividend chart after an absence of two years
during which he had donated a large block of shares to his charitable
foundation Gatsby.
A Labour Research magazine survey shows that in the past year Mr
Sainsbury collected #37,635,924 in dividend payments on his
shareholdings.
Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber came second in the league table by
getting #19.2m in dividends from his Really Useful Group, on top of pay
of #7m. Sir Andrew's total earnings in 1994 were more than #26m.
Labour Research -- which claims to be independent, though left leaning
-- says 65 directors from 47 companies earned at least #500,000 in
dividend payments and a further 27 board members received #1m or more.
Ranked third in the survey were Mr Ronald Hobson and Sir Donald
Gosling, who founded the National Parking Corporation which owns the
chain of NCP car parks.
Mr Hobson received #4.9m and #4.1m in dividends, but both are due to
receive a special bonus dividend of almost #132m ahead of plans to float
the company on the Stock Market.
The three surviving members of rock group Queen also collected more
than #2m in share payments.
Guitarist Brian May, bassist John Deacon, and drummer Roger Taylor
each received #667,000 in dividends on top of salaries which ranged from
#350,000 to #847,548.
A spokesman for Labour Research said last night: ''Some of the
dividend amounts being raked in are seen by many ordinary people as
obscenely high.
''Company bosses already earn bumper salaries without collecting
massive share bonanzas as well.''
Among the other top dividend earners were turkey tycoon Bernard
Matthews (#1,455,957), Carpetright chief Sir Philip Harris (#1,687,977)
and Amstrad's Alan Sugar (#1,027,843).
The survey also suggests that family dynasties are also faring well in
the dividend payouts league.
Mr Simon Weinstock of GEC earned #2,970,696 in dividends -- nearly
three times what his father and managing director Lord Arnold Weinstock
received.
Sir David Alliance, chairman of mail order group N Brown, collected
#2,872,493 in dividend pay, three times more than his brother Nigel.
Mr Brian Souter and sister Mrs Ann Gloag have built up bus group
Stagecoach and both make over #1m a year in dividends.
While Mr Souter collected #1.7m, Mrs Gloag received #1.4m enabling her
to buy Beaufort Castle and all its contents for #2.8m.
Sir Rocco Forte and Mrs Olga Pollizi are another winning brother and
sister combination. Sir Rocco, chairman of the hotels group, got more
than #1m in dividends last year, while his sister received #769,469.
In March last year his brother Robert and Mr Alan Wiseman successfully
floated the dairy business founded by their father. They benefited from
dividends of #536,975 and #646,535 respectively.

<TEXT>
A WATER services department has been forced to apologise to hundreds
of consumers after raising fears over the weekend that their water
supply would be cut off for months.
Householders in north Argyll on Saturday morning were astonished to
find an unsigned letter from the Strathclyde Regional Council department
giving them less than a day's notice of the start of a major, 32-week
mains upgrading programme.
The letter asked them to fill a bath before 8am in order to provide
water for flushing their toilets during the programme.
Mr Douglas Trigg, secretary of Ardchattan community council which
covers part of the affected area, said: ''My phone didn't stop ringing.
''Elderly people were calling to ask whether the water was going to be
off for 32 weeks. They said a bathful of water wouldn't be sufficient to
flush the loo for that time. They were really concerned.''
He said that as well as having no signature, the letter bore no
address and, because it was delivered on a Saturday, people could not
get through to the department concerned.
He said he had written a letter of complaint to the regional council's
chief executive.
The deluge of complaints prompted a second letter, delivered yesterday
from the Lochgilphead-based area manager, Arthur Barclay, apologising
for ''any confusion or inconvenience'' over the first letter.
''The work proposed requires sections of the trunk main to be isolated
and provision will be made, as far as is practical, to maintain supplies
to all customers,'' Mr Barclay's letter read.

WESTERN Isles councillors are preparing to check what they believe is
a move too far for the priceless Lewis Chessmen, by refusing to return
the set of 67 to the British Museum in London.
The 840-year-old Norse pieces, hand carved from Walrus tusk and
discovered at Uig on the west of the island in 1831, have been on a
three- month loan to the Western Isles Museum in Stornoway, due to end
on October 7.
However, a cross-party alliance led by Independent councillor Alasdair
Nicholson and Labour group leader Calum MacMillan, tomorrow will ask the
council's arts and leisure committee to request the set be given
''permanent residence'' on the island.
If the British Museum refuses, Mr Nicholson is prepared to do
''whatever is legally appropriate'' to keep the pieces, some of which
are worth more than #1m, he said yesterday.
Mr Nicholson, already backed by a council motion passed in June, which
demanded the return of the set, added: ''A dialogue has been open with
the British Museum for several months. As the loan ends next week, we
will now push it for agreement to make it permanent.
''There is no reason why this cultural colonialism should continue,
with the pieces locked away in the back vaults of the museum in London.
People should be able to see them against the geographical and cultural
backdrop of the community in which they were found.''
Mr Nicholson said the success of the chessmen's display in Stornoway,
which has attracted a record 15,000 visitors on an island with a
population of 30,000, was ''a successful experiment which must be
continued''.
He added: ''The economic impact on the island has been vast. This is a
practical, as well as an emotional, appeal. It would be rather mean
spirited and bad PR if the British Museum asked for them back.''
The alliance has sought legal advice and will press the council to go
to court to establish custody if the request is refused.
Mr MacMillan said: ''If the museum says 'no', I will be asking the
council to hang onto them until the lawyers prove ownership.
''Permanent loan is the best way to establish the issue does not arise
-- but they are in our possession and in our building. That is a pretty
powerful bargaining position.''
However, the British Museum said it was considering its position.
''There is a written agreement over the length of the loan,
conservation of the pieces, and their display,'' said a spokesman.
''I am not aware of any of our loans never being returned before. But
if they are not, we will have to respond.''
Members of the international chess community have expressed support
for the island's campaign, including British Grandmaster Nigel Short,
who recently sent a message of support while playing in an international
tournament in Bulgaria.
In July, the promise of playing with the chessmen lured many of the
world's leading competitors to take part in an international chess
festival in Lewis.
Chairman of Lewis Chess Club, Mr Alasdair Macleod, said his group
planned to make the tournament, which attracted more than 400 players,
the first of an annual event.
He said: ''If any evidence is required as to why they should stay, the
tournament is it.''
The set was discovered in 1831 by a farmer. They are believed to have
belonged to a Norse merchant, who hid them at a time of danger.
A local entrepreneur took them from Lewis and sold them to a dealer in
Edinburgh, from whom they were acquired by the British Museum --
although 11 accompanying pieces were sold to a Mr Kirkpatrick Sharp, a
Scot, and passed to the National Museum of Scotland.

A MEETING of Stornoway Trust has accused Western Isles Islands Council
of misleading it over provision of a football pitch to replace Macaulay
Road playing field.
Last June, the trust, landlord of the publicly-owned estate, agreed to
grant a minute of waiver to allow the Scottish Co-operative access to
the playing field, used by the junior football league, to build a #5m
supermarket. Work has now started at the site.
As a result of the deal, the council received #1m and the Stornoway
Trust #100,000. The Co-op completed a Section 50 agreement to provide
appropriate substitute playing fields.
However, the trustees have been told now that the phased project to
provide a #1m all-weather sports facility could take up to three years.
The council originally planned to provide the substitute field to the
west side of its HQ but this was abandoned. It is now proposed that the
all-weather facility will be at the playing field at Nicolson Institute.
The playing field there is to be relocated to the east side of the
council HQ.
At the trust meeting, members were told by Mr Charles Nicolson, who
sits on the council's playing field working group, that it was now
likely the project would take up to three years.
It was agreed to make strong representations on the issue.
However, Mr Brian Stewart, chief executive of the council who
master-minded the Co-op deal, said the replacement pitch adjacent to
Smith Avenue was being undertaken as a matter of urgency. A planning
application was in the process of being submitted.
He added that if work began on the site now it could jeopardise the
chances of obtaining funding from other bodies.

<HEADLINE>Courtroom to use computer system for instant text as Winchester braces for media invasion. Hi-tech bid to speed West trial</HEADLINE>

THE judge and legal teams at the Rosemary West murder trial will use a
hi-tech computer system similar to that used to record proceedings in
the O J Simpson trial in Los Angeles.
Computers will provide immediate text of the spoken proceedings in the
No 3 courtroom at Winchester Crown Court, where Rosemary West will face
10 murder charges tomorrow.
The judge, Mr Justice Mantell, will have a lap-top computer on his
elevated bench and identical terminals will be available to Mr Brian
Leveson QC, prosecuting, and Mr Dick Ferguson QC, for the defence.
The state-of-the-art reporting system will help speed the trial, which
is expected to last two months. Legal teams will not have to make
copious amounts of notes -- although they can make notes alongside the
screen text on their terminals.
A team of three shorthand writers will use the real-time system, which
translates their keystrokes into on-screen text. The team, from official
court reporters W Lloyd Woodland will use a system called CaseView for
Windows, which is the latest derivative of a system used in the trial of
O J Simpson.
A special editing room has been set up and each day a complete
print-out will be processed, if required. The proceedings will form a
vast database, instantly accessible through keywords.
The trial's hi-tech approach is also reflected in a large-scale model
of No 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, which was formerly the home of
41-year-old Rosemary West.
The prosecution will allege the house and garden of the inner-city
home provided the graves of nine of her alleged victims, including her
daughter Heather, 16.
Rosemary West is also accused of murdering her eight-year-old
step-daughter Charmaine, whose remains were discovered by police diggers
at a former West family home at 25 Midland Road, Gloucester, less than a
quarter of a mile from Cromwell Street.
The mother of seven denies all the allegations.
Her husband, builder Frederick West, 53, was found hanged in his cell
at Birmingham Prison on New Year's Day.
He had been charged with the same 10 murder counts as his wife -- and
was further charged, alone, with having murdered his first wife,
Catherine ''Rena'' Costello, 25, and Scottish babysitter Anne McFall,
18.
The detailed model of 25 Cromwell Street will be the centrepiece
exhibit in aiding the judge and jury to follow the evidence covering a
16-year period to 1987, during which the Crown claim the murders were
committed.
The bodies found in the house and garden were those of young women
aged between 15 and 21. Every seat is expected to be filled in the
courtroom in the court complex of the historic cathedral city.
Members of the public wanting to follow the trial from one of the 59
seats in the public gallery will have to queue for an admission ticket.
Priority will be given to relatives of the victims and the West family.
The public gallery overlooks the tiered courtroom but is out of sight
of the long dock, which stands immediately beneath it. Only Rosemary
West and two uniformed prison officers will be in the dock.
Thirty seats have been allocated to the media in the main court area,
which will also house senior police officers, court officials, and a
handful of court artists.
More than 130 journalists, representing massive British and overseas
media interest, have been given accreditation for the trial. Five
authors will also be following the trial.
Most of the journalists will be accommodated in an overflow annexe on
the opposite side of the corridor from the first-floor courtroom where
the trial is being held. They will follow the trial on an audio link.
The ancient city of Winchester is bracing itself for a media invasion.
Most hotel rooms in the city were booked by media teams within days of
the trial date being set.
The impressive open courtyard of the top-security court complex will
be the vantage point for photographers and television crews poised for
the arrival of Rosemary West and trial personalities.
Police will seal off side roads close to the court to speed Rosemary
West's journey from Winchester prison, which is less than half a mile
away.

DISGRUNTLED British tourists are among the most inventive when it
comes to getting refunds, a new survey claims.
One couple demanded a refund because they had ''seen a child peeing in
the sea''.
Another asked for cash back on a holiday in Greece -- because ''the
whole place was full of Greeks and all they could eat was Greek food''.
New travel magazine, Travel Agency, had asked for the best excuses and
tales of woe agents had heard.
One woman, who got pregnant on holiday, demanded that Abta should
trace the father.
The survey appears in the first issue of the monthly magazine, being
launched at the Abta annual convention in Sun City, South Africa today.

<TEXT>
BT confirmed yesterday it is investigating complaints that people are
being charged for calls to engaged numbers.
Responding to a Sunday newspaper report, the company maintained it had
found no evidence of charging for unanswered calls.
A spokesman said the company believed that very short calls on
itemised bills resulted from callers hanging up when they reach a wrong
number or avoiding an answerphone.
The Mail on Sunday report claimed millions of callers who hang up
after a few seconds when they hear an engaged tone are billed as if
their call had been answered. The paper claimed the overcharging could
be bringing in up to #100m a year for BT.
However, the BT spokesman explained: ''We've been looking into this
issue for two or three years and the number of queries has risen since
bills became fully itemised at the end of last year.
''In every case that we have investigated we have not been able to
find any evidence of a call registering a charge if it has been
unanswered or encountered the engaged tone.
''There are many instances of calls of one or two seconds such as
people who don't like answering machines, misdials which are realised in
a second or two, and calls into a queuing system.
''It's true that we have a working party looking into this, it will
continue its work, and we will continue to investigate every individual
case.''
He said BT wanted to hear from a woman mentioned in the Mail on Sunday
story who found five charges of one unit for the same number and
discovered it belonged to her doctor, whom she had called many times
before getting through.
''We are happy to hear from customers who dispute such charges and if
a customer is adamant we may agree to waive the charge and credit it
against the next bill,'' the spokesman added.

BRITAIN's leading cosmic physicist, Professor Stephen Hawking, has
accepted the possibility of time travel -- an idea he ridiculed for
years.
''If you combine Einstein's general theory of relativity with quantum
theory, it does begin to seem a possibility,'' he told The Sunday Times.
However, the Cambridge mathematics professor added that he thought
time travel would probably never be practical.
Professor Hawkings had previously scoffed at the idea, using advanced
science and ordinary logic to argue that something which could let you
kill your ancestors or alter your past was unthinkable.
''The best evidence that time travel will never be possible is that we
have not been invaded by hordes of tourists from the future,'' he said
two years ago.
His change of heart is spelled out in the foreword to a new book, The
Physics of Star Trek, by US astronomer Lawrence Krauss, which is due to
be published next month.
''One of the consequences of rapid interstellar travel would be that
one could also travel back in time,'' writes Professor Hawking.
Speculation that time travel may be possible was prompted by Einstein,
who showed that time and space are closely related and that both are
affected by gravity.
His ground-breaking theories led to the idea that enormous
gravitational fields, such as those around collapsed stars, known as
black holes, could reverse the flow of time.
However, harnessing enough energy for a machine to send travellers
back through time would pose a major problem.
Professor Hawking adds: ''We may not yet be able to boldly go where no
man or woman has gone before but at least we can do it in the mind.''

A COUPLE were married on a disused ferry yesterday because the island
where they met does not have a church.
Mr Bert Waiter and Ms Penny Beveridge invited 60 wedding guests to
their wedding on Easdale, Argyll, more than doubling the population of
the island.
Mr Waiter, 31, a lorry driver, from Johnshaven, Kincardineshire, and
Ms Beveridge, 33, from Aberdeen, were on Easdale for their summer
holiday.
They were drinking in the Puffer Bar when they said they would like to
be married on the island.
Landlord Bert Baker suggested they use the disused puffer Ealean
Easdale as a venue and the Rev Robert Brown from neighbouring Seil
Island agreed to conduct the ceremony on the deck.
Islanders Tony Sayles and Mike Baldock dressed up as Para Handy and
Chief Engineer McPhail to add atmosphere and violinist Bobby Harvey
played the organ.
Ms Beveridge, a graphic designer, walked down the ''aisle'' to the
deck of the puffer with three bridesmaids and her two dogs Hudson and
Harvey.
Mr Waiter said: ''As weddings go, it's been a cracker. I am a big Para
Handy fan and when Bert suggested the idea for the wedding we just
jumped at it.
''Marriage is a serious business but we've all had a good laugh too.''

<HEADLINE>Cameras get credit for cut in accidents</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
POLICE cameras in Strathclyde are helping to cut accident rates by up
to 70% in some areas three years after they were introduced in the UK.
The cameras are being credited with persuading drivers to slow down at
accident blackspots.
The force says its three-year experience of the cameras had produced a
''very positive story'', with few public complaints.
Superintendent Fred McManus, who managed the introduction of the
cameras in the region, believes that part of the acceptance lies in
their passive nature -- the devices do not run all the time but are
triggered only by an offence.
''There is no question about them having a deterrent effect. In some
areas, we get a 70% reduction in accidents -- and a similar reduction in
offences,'' he said.
Speed trap cameras have caught countless speeding motorists since the
first person to be prosecuted on the strength of their evidence, a
London postman, was fined #156 for doing 78mph in a 50mph zone in
October 1992 as he rushed to see his pregnant ex-girlfriend in hospital.
The Department of Transport and police forces stress that the
principal objective is to reduce the human misery associated with
serious and fatal accidents, rather than to raise revenue.
One study in west London, where the first network of cameras was set
up, showed an 18% reduction in accidents overall and a 26% reduction in
those classed as fatal or serious.
Last year, 3650 people died in accidents on Britain's roads -- and the
DoT estimated that about 1500 of those deaths were directly related to
speeding.
In 1993, the death toll was 3814. The DoT said it was difficult to
talk in precise terms but it believed the speed cameras played a part in
cutting the figure.
The stress on deterrence rather than revenue raising is evident from
the way the camera systems are organised.
In most systems, only a limited number of camera boxes is operational
at any one time -- the rest are dummies. Cameras are rotated from site
to site so that drivers can never be sure whether or not a box is
photographing their number plate and recording their speed.
0 The Scottish Council for Civil Liberties argues that the cameras
simply displace speeding to other districts and that they identify the
offending car -- but not necessarily the offending driver.
''We don't believe there is any long-term deterrent effect,'' said
SCCL director Carole Ewart.
* Meanwhile, county council road safety officers have begun to copy
police speed radars with their own devices to slow dangerous motorists.
Officials in Northamptonshire and Leicestershire have borrowed the idea
of mobile cameras from a Swedish design.

<HEADLINE>Equality guidelines rejected</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE national housing agency Scottish Homes has refused to endorse
guidelines drawn up by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations
aimed at ensuring contractors and consultants hired by its members
operate fair and equal employment and training practices amongst their
own workforces.
The refusal comes even after an initial SFHA Contract Compliance
guidelines document was redrafted following consultation between the two
organisations. The SFHA is now expected to issue a third and final
version independently of Scottish Homes.
The SFHA document was rejected, says a Scottish Homes spokesperson,
because it ''did not set down clear and concise action guidelines''. It
therefore ''did not fit Scottish Homes' monitoring role of housing
associations''.
The national agency is responding by drawing up its own guidelines.
However, while the SFHA document covers sectors of the population such
as women, ethnic minorities, and the disabled, the Scottish Homes
guidelines will be limited to race equality. These will be added to its
existing Raising Standards publication setting out the performance
standards the agency requires of housing associations.
According to its director, Mr David Orr, the SFHA had undertaken
widespread consultation including the Equal Opportunities Commission,
the Commission of Racial Equality, local authorities, and organisations
already operating a contract compliance system.
''Everyone, except Scottish Homes, was content with the tone, content,
format, and the way the document had been developed,'' he said.
Mr Orr added: ''Our members have been asking for something on contract
compliance for some time now. We are now ready to provide that.''
Although Mr Orr was concerned that ''two different documents will
confuse things'', he hoped they could complement each other, at least in
the field of race equality.
One objection made by Scottish Homes to SFHA's first draft proposals
was advice that contracts be terminated for non-compliance -- thereby
laying associations open to defending costly legal action.
Mr Orr insisted this was a misunderstanding on the part of Scottish
Homes. The SFHA had always intended that housing associations should
instead remove offending firms from a list of approved contractors, he
said.

A SCOTS father was reunited at the weekend with the daughter he last
saw more than 40 years ago, when she was just five years old.
Mr William Stupart, 73, had not seen Jeanette since he and his Dutch
wife Maria separated in Holland, in 1952.
However, a chance meeting between Jeanette and a Scottish salesman at
a business fair in Brussels, finally led to an emotional reunion at her
father's Dundee home.
Mr Stupart met his wife in 1946, while serving in the Pioneer Corps
rebuilding Rotterdam after the devastation of the Second World War.
The couple returned to Mr Stupart's home town of Dundee the following
year, and Jeanette was born in Scotland in 1947.
The family returned to Holland but, in 1950, Mr Stupart rejoined the
British Army and, two years later, split from his wife and returned to
Scotland.
Last year, Jeanette, who had moved to Belgium but kept the surname
Stupart, met Mr George Johnstone, a representative of Dundee textile
firm Godfreys, while working for a Belgian company at a sales fair in
Brussels.
She mentioned to Mr Johnstone that she was born in Dundee and, after a
year of searching, 48-year-old Jeanette finally made contact with her
father.
Mr Johnstone explained: ''I met her at the trade fair and she told me
she was born in Dundee. I recognised the surname Stupart and offered to
help her trace her father.
''It's taken a year and a lot of hard work at the Dundee register
office to bring Jeanette and her father back together again,'' he added.
After a tearful reunion, Mr Stupart, of Lochee, Dundee, who never
remarried, said: ''It came as a great surprise when Jeanette sent me a
letter and said she wanted to meet up again.
''I had gone back to Holland to try and find her but I couldn't find
any trace of her. We won't be losing touch again.''
His daughter said: ''It was only when my mother died, eight years ago,
that I thought I must do something to try and find him.
''It's been a long time but I have thought about meeting him again for
more than 40 years.''

THE UK is being choked by a ''mad rush'' of urban motorists
undertaking unnecessary journeys, it was claimed yesterday by Scottish
supporters of the Traffic Reduction Bill.
Throughout October, the Glasgow-based Traffic Reduction Campaign will
mail-shot MPs, asking them to sign an early-day motion in support of the
Bill.
Already 81 MPs from five parties, including four Conservatives, have
backed Green MP Cynog Dafis's Bill which would require local councils to
detail their efforts in reducing vehicle movements.
Launching the action, Traffic Reduction Campaign co-ordinator Kay
Allan said: ''This Bill is not anti-car, it is anti-traffic.''
Mrs Allan said that although emission levels in Scottish cities tended
to be lower than those in England, the hot summer and concentration of
tenement buildings, particularly in Glasgow, had trapped pollution in
busy areas in recent months.
The umbrella campaign -- which co-ordinates action from environmental,
cycling, and cross-party political groups -- involves circulating
petitions around town and city centres and distributing 4000 leaflets in
Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Dundee.
A Department of Transport study published last month showed UK car use
had increased by 15% in 10 years, with two out of every three commuters
travelling to work in private vehicles.

ABOUT 200 people a day are joining churches in the spiritual 1990s,
offsetting the number leaving disillusioned, according to figures
published yesterday.
The latest edition of the UK Christian Handbook shows most of the
growth is in evangelical churches, among pentecostal, baptist, and
independent congregations.
The Evangelical Alliance claimed people were flocking through the
doors because the Christian message was being put forward in an
understandable way.
The Rev Clive Calver, director general of the alliance, said: ''The
materialism of the 1980s has left a vast spiritual vacuum in the lives
of many people.
''Where churches proclaim in a relevant way the potential of a
relationship with God, which can be experienced daily, people respond
with great interest.''
The handbook, published by Christian Research, says there are
currently 6,500,000 members of churches in Britain, with one in seven
adults regularly attending.
For every 200 people who join every day, 200 leave disillusioned and
another 200 die.
Christian Research assistant director Heather Wraight said it had long
been known that the number of churchgoers was falling but the figures
were more encouraging than previously thought.
The handbook also lists a record 5900 Christian organisations, 500
more than the previous edition two years ago.

* Electronic tolls on motorways could land the Government with a
political disaster of poll-tax proportions, a report warned yesterday.
The Government could be forced to abandon the system if motorists en
masse refused to pay, according to the report.
The system proposed is so complicated there could be more than 100
million ''spurious'' reports a year of motorists violating the
pay-as-you go system, it said. The complaint-sorting process would be
''an administrative nightmare''.
The fact that the report is published by the Centre for Policy Studies
-- the right-wing think tank with close Conservative Party links -- is
bound to add to Government embarrassment over its highly critical line.
The plans for trials of toll technology to start next summer on a
stretch of the M3 were announced two months ago by Transport Secretary
Sir George Young.
The trials will involve three electronic technologies for registering
the presence of a vehicle and sending a bill to the owner.
In yesterday's report, author Michael Schabas, a transport adviser,
suggested the equipment would be liable to make mistakes.

FILM stars Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson have separated after six
years of marriage.
The couple made their announcement in a statement to PA News, blaming
work as the reason they had drifted apart.
''It is with great sadness that we have decided to separate. Our work
has inevitably led to our spending long periods of time away from each
other and, as a result, we have drifted apart.
''The separation is entirely amicable but, as with the breakdown of
any relationship, it is painful for both of us and we ask the media to
respect both our privacy and that of our friends and families.''

A SHIP said to be carrying a consignment of highly toxic nuclear waste
sailed into a storm of protest as it headed towards Britain yesterday.
Fifteen Greenpeace protesters were arrested after trying to prevent
trucks carrying the waste being loaded on to the ro-ro vessel Arneb
which left Bremerhaven, Germany, at 5pm on Saturday bound for the
Dounreay nuclear reprocessing plant in Caithness.
Mr Mike Townsley, of Greenpeace International, said the Arneb was due
to land at Felixstowe on Wednesday. ''This means she is going somewhere
else before that. It could be anywhere but we fear she will dock in
Scotland at either Aberdeen, Grangemouth or Leith.''
Mr Townsley said: ''The material should have gone to the US. However,
political difficulties both in Germany and the US means that Scotland is
getting the ship -- and faces the prospect of getting hundreds more.
''Over 500 shipments of weapons grade nuclear waste -- or spent highly
enriched uranium fuel rods -- could be travelling the length of Scotland
over the next 10 years on their way to Dounreay.
''The US is considering a deal to support the reprocessing of between
5000 and 14,000 American-made research reactor fuel rods at Dounreay.
Such a deal would mean a massive increase in reprocessing at Dounreay
and a massive increase in its radioactive discharges.''
After several public consultation periods in the US, the Clinton
administration intends to reach a decision by the end of this year on
the proposal to offload the US-originated waste in Scotland.
Previously the rods were returned to the US for disposal. However, the
US take-back policy lapsed in 1988 after lobbying by US environment
groups and could not be restarted until an environment impact assessment
had been carried out. That assessment is almost complete.
Mr Townsley said: ''While no-one has bothered to ask them, it is now
time for the Scottish people to tell Washington and Whitehall they are
not prepared to accept the risk of nuclear waste transports.
''While it would be obviously attractive to be able to demonstrate at
the port of entry, that may not be possible. However, we are trying to
establish the itinerary of this transport so people living along the
route can be alerted to the threat of hundreds more transports.''
SNP environment spokeswoman Roseanna Cunningham said the shipment was
Dounreay's attempt to prove to the US that it was possible to talk about
big shipments being made in the future.
She said: ''I would challenge the Government to consult the people of
Scotland on what they think about this.
''Clearly, they are trying to avoid being confronted with the will of
the people. The underhand methods they are using shows they believe that
the opposition to this shipment is very substantial.''
The shipment was also criticised by Friends of the Earth Scotland.
Director Kevin Dunion said: ''There is no justification for this fuel
being reprocessed at Dounreay. Without any consultation with the
Scottish people we are being touted as the world's nuclear dustbin.''
Friends of the Earth Scotland said further action was also planned for
Britain.
A spokesman for the UK Atomic Energy Authority at Dounreay denied at
the weekend that the shipment was nuclear waste, saying it contained 52
irradiated fuel rods which would be reprocessed at the plant between
January and March.
He added: ''Nuclear waste is technically the final product. These are
fuel rods which can be reprocessed and returned to the country of
origin.
''Waste produced from the reprocessing operation will also be returned
to the country of origin. That is the position with all our contracts
and applies to the agreement with Germany.''

LABOUR MPs are divided over plans to open a central party office in
Edinburgh, casting doubt on the future of the current headquarters in
Glasgow.
The former local party office at Ruskin House in Edinburgh's Windsor
Street, has been bought for around #150,000. A further #100,000 will be
spent refurbishing the building.
Scottish general secretary Jack McConnell said it would be used to
serve the needs of a future Scottish parliament.
He said no final decisions had been made on whether it would be used
as a single Labour headquarters in Scotland but added it was certain to
be used as a ''centre of operations'' for the party's senior staff.
He indicated that there may be several ''headquarters'' in the future
for different party functions, such as administration and political
activity.
Mr McConnell said: ''The scale of our operations will be made larger
when we have a Scottish parliament. We will need a staff level and
office capability to meet that need.''
He said the political focus would inevitably shift eastwards with a
devolved parliament in the capital.
Most of the party's 16 full- time staff are based at Keir Hardie House
in Glasgow's West End, which has been Labour headquarters in Scotland
for the last 20 years. There is one full-time worker in Edinburgh and
offices have recently been opened in Aberdeen, Inverness, Ayr, Stirling,
and Dumfries.
A review would be carried out to reassess staff needs should Labour
win the next General Election and set up a Scottish parliament.
MPs have given mixed reactions to the plans. Glasgow Shettleston MP
David Marshall said he would oppose any attempt to transfer the
headquarters to Edinburgh.
He said: ''I would certainly want the head office to remain in
Glasgow. The majority of the population and constituencies are in the
west of Scotland and Glasgow.''
Glasgow Pollock MP James Dunnachie said the Scottish Labour
headquarters had always been in the heartland of the party in the west
of Scotland.
He said he was cautious of the idea but added: ''If it helps us win
seats then I have no argument with it but it may have an effect on
voters in the west.''
The MP for Glasgow Cathcart, Mr John Maxton, said it would be
surprising if there was not a stronger Labour presence in the capital
after the establishment of a parliament.
He added: ''I can't see anybody in the Labour Party contemplating a
total move from Glasgow -- that would be wrong. However, it is right to
build up our strength in Edinburgh.''
His views were echoed by Edinburgh MPs. Leith MP Malcolm Chisholm,
whose constituency after boundary changes will include the new office,
said: ''It is not of great significance but it is appropriate that it
should be in Edinburgh with the establishment of a Scottish parliament.
Mr Alistair Darling, Edinburgh Central MP, said: ''I always thought
that the rivalry between Edinburgh and Glasgow -- whether over an opera
house, an art gallery or the headquarters of a political party -- is
grossly exaggerated. I can't see any difficulty with this.''

A 17-YEAR-old leukemia victim who was ''adopted'' by football star
Paul Gascoigne has died, it was learned yesterday.
Zachary Critcher, who spent an hour with his hero on the day the
player signed for Rangers in July, will be buried today in the Rangers
away strip which Gascoigne bought for him.
Zachary had followed Gascoigne's career for years and was overjoyed
that the star took time out to talk to him at Ibrox and kick a ball
about with him at Rangers' training ground.
Close family friend Gary Morris, 31, said today: ''Paul couldn't do
enough for Zachary. He posed for photographs with him in the dressing
room then had a kick-about with him at the training ground before he met
the press.
''Paul gets a lot of flak . . . but when he was with Zachary, nothing
else seemed to matter.''
Zachary, of Manor Road, Ealing, west London, who also had Down's
Syndrome, had suffered from leukemia from the age of eight.

DELEGATES in Brighton will be allowed to debate and vote on the
banning of 31-year-old barrister Liz Davies from standing as a
parliamentary candidate for Leeds North East at the next General
Election.
Mr Blair had been facing a revolt after the ruling National Executive
Committee quashed Ms Davies's nomination.
Delegates were further angered when they learned 30 resolutions for an
emergency debate had been thrown out by conference organisers.
However, the party's general secretary Tom Sawyer said at a news
conference yesterday he hoped it would be possible to persuade people to
discuss a statement from the NEC.
The issue of barring Ms Davies has sparked a heated internal party row
which spilled over at fringe meetings yesterday. Party chiefs had
already confirmed she was barred from standing even though there was no
finding of guilt on allegations against her.
By allowing a debate in the conference, the NEC has kept the lid on
the situation, at least for the time being.
Mr Sawyer admitted ''people are angry with the NEC'' and explained why
it had decided to reject Ms Davies's bid to become an MP.
''The NEC said they wouldn't endorse her because of her long track
record of actions which include breaking the whip and being economical
with the truth on certain items, and her attitude over a long period of
time. They decided she was not a suitable parliamentary candidate.''

TONY and Cherie Blair were quick off the mark yesterday when publicly
challenged by a church minister.
The Rev Mary Bailey surprised the Labour leader and his wife by
proffering a microphone and demanding: ''Tell us who you are.''
The Blairs responded to the light-hearted welcome to the Dome Mission
Methodist Church in Brighton by giving impromptu self-descriptions.
Mrs Blair told the congregation of 300: ''My name is Cherie. I am a
mum and a barrister and I have recently become Queen's Counsel, which is
very smart.''
Mrs Bailey then asked Mr Blair to speak.
He replied: ''I am Tony Blair. I am a father and I am leader of the
Labour Party -- I am not sure whether that's smart or not but I do
harbour ambitions.''
The good-natured exchange came at a Harvest Thanksgiving service on
the eve of the Labour Party conference.
In her sermon, Mrs Bailey spoke movingly of the legacy of the late
Labour leader John Smith and told Mr Blair: ''Go, go and do well.''
In the afternoon, the Blairs attended a Labour-sponsored race meeting
at Brighton.

A PRIVATE seminar attended by prostitutes, high court judges, and
members of the Scottish establishment has thrown up new evidence that
more and more teenagers, some as young as 15, are being lured into the
twilight world of prostitution.
The worrying trend came to light at an all-day seminar organised by
Edinburgh University. Among the other items discussed was whether
prostitution should be legalised.
Lothian's director of public health, Dr Helen Zealley, said the extent
of the problem involving young people and prostitution had come to light
during the discussions. She said she would be exploring the issue
closely and looking at what could be done to cut the numbers involved.
Dr Zealley said: ''The number of young people being drawn into
prostitution certainly bothers me, particularly from a health point of
view.''
The event's organiser, the Rev Andrew Morton, said the
behind-closed-doors discussion had been worthwhile, with all sides
talking freely. He described the meeting, believed to be one of the
first when everyone from prostitutes to High Court judges attended to
debate the issue of prostitution, as open and successful.
Mr Morton, Edinburgh University's associate director of theology and
public issues, said another may be held to develop points raised.
He said the event, held in New College at the university, had not been
publicised to allow those attending the chance to air their views openly
and to ask the questions they wanted. He hit out at reports the event
had been ''secret'' and said no recommendations would be coming from it
on whether prostitution should be legalised or not.
Among the 40 people attending the meeting, held 10 days ago, were two
High Court judges, Crown Office officials, sheriffs, public health
representatives, leading churchmen, police officers, and representatives
of the Scottish Prostitutes Education Project and Scottish HIV Action.
Mr Morton said because the meeting was private it would be wrong to
single out the names of particular people who attended the seminar.
However, it is believed they included High Court judge Lord James
Milligan and the Episcopalian Bishop of Edinburgh, the Most Rev Richard
Holloway.
Dr Zealley said the meeting had been very positive and made it clear
she had never had the impression it had been supposedly secret. When
asked what she had taken from the meeting, she replied: ''The
information about the number of young people becoming involved in
prostitution was very important and useful. We will be taking a close
look at the situation encompassing teenage pregnancies and the issue of
prostitution.''
The decision to stage the seminar came against a background of
controversy in the capital over the city council's policy on licensing
saunas which offer sex for sale. The move sparked world-wide interest
and Mr Morton said it was important that the general issue of
prostitution was discussed.

<HEADLINE>Moderate unions draw line at 50% voice as Labour leader pursues internal reforms. Blair wrestles with age-old links</HEADLINE>

TRADE union leaders of all political persuasions have confronted
Labour leader Tony Blair with a demand that the unions retain a 50%
voice in the party they created.
This firmer stance by the unions was revealed by the traditionally
moderate Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union on the eve of the
party conference which opens in Brighton today amid confusion over the
party's commitment to the introduction of a statutory national minimum
wage.
The AEEU had been a prime mover in the initial move to modernised the
link between the party and the unions which saw their share of the
conference vote cut back from 90% to 70% in 1993.
It will be trimmed back further later this week to 50% to give the
unions and the Constituency Labour Parties parity.
Mr Blair set the alarm bells ringing earlier this year by suggesting
that the union vote could be depressed further if individual party
membership continued to grow.
Leaders of several major unions complained at the time but now even
the AEEU is saying that enough is enough.
Acting general secretary Ken Jackson said in Brighton yesterday that
''trade unions from the left, right and centre were saying there should
be no reduction below 50%''.
This had been spelt out personally to Mr Blair at a recent meeting of
the Trade Union Labour Party liaison committee.
Another area where the AEEU was out of line with the Blair modernists
was union sponsored MPs. Any move to abolish sponsorship would be
opposed by the AEEU which was very keen to continue its unique
arrangement under which AEEU members are trained to be prospective MPs.
On the key issue of the national minimum wage, Mr Jackson said the
AEEU was content to trust Mr Blair and his team to decide at what level
it should be set once they are in government.
Yesterday it was unclear what would become of a contentious composite
motion calling for a minimum wage of #4.15 an hour, via ''a legally
binding national minimum wage, initially at half median male earnings
and uprated overtime to two thirds of average earnings''.
Edinburgh Central CLP delegate Ms Jane Saren is due to move the
composite later today although she is coming under strong pressure to
remit the motion in the interests of unity and because the reference to
median and average earnings have left the motion ''flawed''.
If it is debated, the big unions are divided: with Unison and the
General Municipal and Boilermakers, and the Communications Workers
Union, who together wield over 25% of the total vote, due to give
reluctant support; and the AEEU and the Transport and General Workers,
the shopworkers Usdaw and the Manufacturing Science and Finance union
aggregating some 30% of the vote, opposing.
This represents a dramatic about-turn by the TGWU whose general
secretary Bill Morris had said repeatedly that his union would support
#4.15 ''wherever it appeared on a conference agenda''.
Yesterday, however, he declared his union, the largest party
affiliate, would not be supporting the composite because of its confused
wording.
From being a potential thorn in Mr Blair's side Mr Morris has been
transformed into the Labour leader's most influential ally, swinging his
union's 13% block vote firmly behind Mr Blair's call for the setting up
of a low pay commission to decide the minimum wage once Labour assumes
power.

ENGLAND rugby captain Will Carling relaxes at a Putney cafe/bar with
fellow England player Brian Moore yesterday.
Carling was a try-scoring hero for his club Harlequins at the weekend
-- and his next goal is to win back his wife, his father said.
The troubled star arrived at the ground near Twickenham stadium in
silence but was greeted on the field with a thunderous standing ovation
from a rare capacity 4000 crowd.
His father, Bill Carling, said he was confident Will would patch up
his differences with wife Julia.
Mr Carling said: ''He is a tough guy but he is also human and he will
be very sad about it all.''
Mr Carling was speaking before he and his wife Pam attended the match
to support their son.
Carling and Julia separated after persistent reports of the
29-year-old rugby star's secret friendship with the Princess of Wales.
The strain showed yesterday, until a first-half touchdown restored the
smile to Carling's face and helped his side to a 34-18 victory over West
Hartlepool.

THOUGHTS of an imminent General Election were emerging here in
Brighton last night as the Labour Party gathered for its conference.
Some MPs are suggesting that, if the Tories can reduce the Labour lead
in opinion polls to 10%, they might go to the country before Christmas.
Next week in Blackpool, the Tories will set out to reduce Mr Blair's
commanding lead but here, thoughts of a pre-Christmas election serve
only to reinforce party discipline.
Yesterday, Mr Blair was able to finesse most of the problems ahead of
him at his conference. There is a commitment to be voted on to
renationalise British Rail after privatisation -- but only as soon as
possible. The mighty Transport Workers' Union announced that it was not,
after all, to try to force a Blair government to produce a minimum wage
of #4.15.
The party national executive yesterday accepted a long policy motion
on Northern Ireland which does not break the bipartisan policy that the
IRA must start decommissioning its weapons before Sinn Fein can be
admitted to constitutional talks.
On Tuesday, the thorny issue of the executive's decision to block
barrister Ms Liz Davies' parliamentary candidature is expected to be
tackled in a conference debate. Thirty emergency resolutions in defence
of this left-winger, who was rejected by the national executive for the
Leeds North East seat, have been rejected but the national executive
wants the issue aired and is producing a conference statement for
special debate.
This was sewn up yesterday in the knowledge that, if the vote goes
against the Davies proscription, all the conference can do is refer the
matter back to the executive.
So Mr Blair looks set for a successful conference, one that seems
determined to show itself to the nation as united and seriously
preparing for government.
The Tories are looking for Labour weaknesses -- and they may well spot
one in the Labour conference's intentions on the future of British Rail.
Mr Major will claim that this is a conference fudge and that the old
nationalisation Labour Party still lurks behind the new Labour image.

THE MP for Cunninghame South, Mr Brian Donohoe, has called on the
Accounts Commission to investigate Ayrshire and Arran Health Board's
award of a public relations contract which he claims was outwith the
competitive tendering process.
Mr Donohoe alleges the contract with Glasgow-based Alan Clark
Associates was worth up to #100,000 over the last four years.
It was first awarded in October 1991 for two years and was continued
in 1993 for a further two years.
It ended on September 30, just days after Mr Donohoe received a reply
from Scottish Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton to a
Parliamentary Question tabled more than two months ago.
Mr Donohoe said: ''I am very concerned that the health board may well
have breached guidance on the award of contracts. There must be question
marks over the propriety of the board awarding contracts of this size
without them being subject to tendering.''
He criticised the ''inordinate amount of time'' taken by the Scottish
Office to respond to his question and said: ''The Accounts Commission
must become involved in this matter to prevent the health board and the
Scottish Office covering up what is a totally disgraceful set of
events.''
However, Ayrshire and Arran Health Board's acting general manager, Mrs
Marjorie Durie, rejected the MP's allegations. She said the contract was
awarded using correct procedures under the board's Standing Financial
Instructions.
Mrs Durie said the specialist skills and extensive local knowledge
available from Alan Clark Associates were considered important by the
board in successfully explaining structural and developmental changes
within the NHS over the time of the two contracts.
She said: ''The board judged that expertise necessary for the best
conduct of its press affairs and our Standing Financial Instructions
allow for this form of expertise to be secured in the best interests of
the service.''

* FORMER England soccer captain Gary Lineker was yesterday urged not
to renew his contract to advertise Walkers crisps because of a union
dispute at the company.
The GMB general union has written to Lineker asking for his support.
A spokesman for Lineker said the union's complaints had been passed on
but Lineker wished to remain apolitical.
* THE Government is backing better rights for Eastern European workers
than it is prepared to grant to UK employees, Labour claimed yesterday,
after Britain agreed a new EU deal with Russia and the Ukraine.
The agreement means that each EU member state has to ensure that the
treatment given to Russian and Ukrainian nationals working abroad is the
same as the rights for its own citizens.
However, Labour said the Government continued to block the EU Posted
Workers Directive which would give workers from EU countries --
including the UK -- the same rights as local workers.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair will demand a shake-up of the National
Lottery and might stop the organisers making profits if his party wins
the next General Election.
Mr Blair claimed yesterday that most people regarded the current
profit levels as excessive and said he believes all spare money from the
weekly lottery should go to good causes.
In an interview with a London-based newspaper, Mr Blair said both he
and the British people have always wanted as much Lottery money as
possible to go to good causes, adding that ''every man, woman, and child
should benefit.
''So we are looking at whether it makes sense for the Lottery to be a
profit-making source at all. No other country in Europe runs a private
profit-making lottery.''
Camelot's six-year contract will end towards the end of Mr Blair's
first term in office if Labour wins the next election.
* Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown will unveil a new policy package
tomorrow designed to win over voters fearful that a Labour government
would spark economic chaos.
He is expected to outline to the party conference in Brighton
initiatives designed to bury once and for all the ''tax and spend''
image of the past.
Mr Brown will make Labour's first spending commitment -- a bold #1000m
scheme to wipe out youth unemployment, financed by a one-off tax on the
profits of privatised utilities.
The shadow Chancellor will flesh out Labour's approach to general tax
and spending issues but is not expected to reveal details of planned
income tax rates.
Advisers said a key feature of the speech, launching a document
entitled A New Economic Future for Britain, would be a firm emphasis on
the need to build success on stability and low inflation.
Mr Brown is due to tell delegates: ''With a Labour government, there
will be no inflationary booms, no massaging of the figures, no quick
fixes, no short cuts, no pay explosions, and no shopping list of
irresponsible commitments.''
Mr Brown will stress the Labour view that job security and
opportunity, particularly for the under-25s, is an essential feature of
economic prosperity.

AMID the clatter of tills and the bleep of check-out scanners,
Metrication Day passed with barely a whimper in Scotland's supermarkets.
Large stores, such as Safeway and Sommerfield, opted against bright
billboards and customer announcements, chosing to remind people of the
changeover by discreet conversion charts or the odd leaflet.
For shoppers it was business as usual, with staff reporting that they
had received few requests for assistance. However, while protests were
not audible the signs of customer confusion were there to see as brows
creased at the meat counter and crowns were scratched while weighing up
the cheese.
From yesterday, under an enforcement of EU rules which date back to
1971, shops must sell all pre-packed goods in litres and kilogrammes and
can be fined up to #5000 for displays in which pounds and ounces are
unaccompanied by the metric equivalent.
Only select items are unchanged: milk and beer will continue to be
sold in pints and loose fruit and vegetables in imperial measures.
It had been thought that the effect of the switch would be felt most
by the elderly, but at Sommerfield in Glasgow's Victoria Road younger
shoppers also expressed confusion.
''I'll find it very difficult,'' said Ms Sharon Fulton, 25. ''Although
I learnt kilogrammes at school you get brought up to buy things in
ounces or pounds. You don't go into a shop and ask for a kilogramme of
apples, do you?''
Mrs Julie Rafferty, 35, with children Julie, 12, Danny, 11 and Kevin,
four, in tow, said her shopping round had been ''baffling''.
At the other end of the spectrum, Mrs Margaret Hall, 72, claimed the
benefit of experience. She said: ''I haven't really given it much
thought. It's just like decimalisation and we'll have to get by
regardless.''
As shoppers struggled over the conversion arithmetic, the biggest
problem was time.
''Shopping is definitely taking longer,'' said Mr John Craig, 50, and
his wife Margaret, 48. The couple weighed the options at the poultry
counter for several minutes before plumping for a 1.5kg chicken.
''I don't have a clue how much this really weighs,'' said Mr Craig.
''I studied the tables all last week but I've forgotten how to do it.''
Only the instinctive shoppers remained unflustered. Mr Paul Mitchell,
25, said his purchasing technique was simple and would not change. ''I
usually just go by the size and if the price is OK, I'll buy it.''
* CALENDAR maker Valentines is already suffering some confusion over
the metric scale.
In its Scenes of England 1995 calendar a picture of Grasmere in the
Lake District is shown for the month of October.
But the blurb under the picture reads: ''Grasmere Lake, barely one
metre by half-a-metre wide.''

A GROUP of lesbians has started a series of ''direct actions'' at
Glasgow's Mitchell Library amid claims that gay literature is being
hidden from public view.
The women, who distributed leaflets at the reference library on
Saturday, and plan further protests, claim that Glasgow's head of
libraries, Mr Andrew Miller, is using the the Local Government Act to
censor the national lesbian and gay publication, the Pink Paper.
Mr Miller returns from leave today. The activists are requesting a
meeting with him this week and lobbying Glasgow councillors to clarify
the authority's position.
Kate Henderson, one of the Lesbian Avengers, said that staff at the
Mitchell were ''very sympathetic during our polite and gentle
demonstration''.
The women were concerned at public statements made by Mr Miller about
contact advertisements in the Pink Paper.
''There are explicit small ads in the daily newspapers on open display
every day,'' said Ms Henderson. ''We are worried about the Act being
used to encourage censorship and access to information on lesbian and
gay issues.''
Section 28 of the Local Government Act, introduced seven years ago,
bans local authorities from promoting homosexuality.
Publications such as Gay Scotland and the Pink Paper may be found in
the social sciences section of the library, but not on open display in
the main reading room.
Councillor Frank McAveety, convener of the city's arts and culture
committee, said any decision by the head of libraries was a managerial
one. ''We will be discussing this, but we do not have a policy of
restriction on reading materials and information,'' he said. ''The Pink
Paper is no different to any other publication.''
The editor of the Pink Paper, Andrew Sexton, said he hoped any problem
in Glasgow would be resolved amicably, but that his newspaper was
consulting the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties over the
controversy.

IRISH Prime Minister John Bruton hopes to prepare the way for early
all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland when he meets the new
Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble today in Dublin.
Mr Trimble will become the first Ulster Unionist Party leader to enter
Dublin government buildings.
Yesterday, an Irish Government spokesman said Mr Bruton was trying to
shift the focus of the peace process away from the stalemate on arms
decommissioning to creating the conditions for the holding of all-party
talks.
The meeting between Mr Bruton and Mr Trimble is regarded as highly
significant by political commentators in Dublin where there is a growing
realisation that no political settlement can be reached without the
support of the Unionists.
Mr Trimble will be accompanied by his deputy leader, Mr John Taylor,
and by the party's security spokesman, Mr Ken Maginnis.
He will also have talks with the Fianna Fail leader, Mr Bertie Ahern,
and Ms Mary Harney of the Progressive Democrats.
Before meeting Mr Bruton, Mr Trimble will attend the launching of a
book claiming that Irish unity will spell financial ruin for both
Northern Ireland and the Republic.
According to sources close to Mr Trimble, the aim of the Unionist
delegation will be to bring their case to the heart of Dublin.
In press reports over the weekend, Mr Taylor called on the Republic to
rejoin the Commonwealth and to replace its Punt with Sterling.
However, in a less strident interview yesterday on Irish radio, Mr
Taylor praised the Irish Government for recognising the existence of
Northern Ireland and the right of its people to determine their own
future.
''The Irish Government does not talk in insulting terms about us in
the way the South used to,'' said Mr Taylor.
Referring to the IRA and Sinn Fein, Mr Taylor said there must be ''a
practical demonstration of the disarming of the Republican terrorists''.
However, he was complimentary to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams's
efforts in advancing the political process.
''I think Mr Adams is trying to lead his people towards democratic
politics. He has a very difficult job which I recognise.
''Mr Adams has been associated with a murder campaign. That was his
policy. So he has to undergo a complete transformation from being a
terrorist to being a democratic politician. It is a challenge to any
person and I understand the problems he has.''
Mr Taylor went out of his way to reassure the Irish Government that Mr
Trimble's plans for a Northern Ireland assembly envisaged an internal
settlement confined to Ulster alone.
He said the Ulster Unionist Party wanted to address four strands in
its search for a political settlement. These were: improving links
between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom;
constructing an internal administration in Northern Ireland; increasing
co-operation between Northern Ireland and the Republic; and bringing the
Republic and the UK closer together.
He added that the Union could be protected by Ulster Unionists and
Irish nationalists participating in an assembly in Belfast. At the same
time, the Union would be strengthened by improved links between Britain
and the Irish Republic in the context of the EU.

RECENTLY appointed senior staff at Lothian and Borders CID and the
fiscal's office in Edinburgh are to be given a new briefing on one of
the most notorious unsolved murder cases in Scottish history.
Police chiefs said last night the briefing sessions on the murders of
Helen Scott and Christine Eadie, both aged 17, who were murdered in 1977
in what became known as the World's End pub murders was a matter of
routine for new senior staff.
They played down the significance of the move and made it clear no
fresh evidence had become available.
The murder case centred on a meeting between the two girls and two men
who were last seen drinking together in the World's End pub in
Edinburgh's High Street.
The girls' bodies were later found in East Lothian. The two men they
were seen drinking with were never traced.

CLAIMS that children suffered crippling side-effects from unnecessary
measles vaccinations were strongly denied by the Government yesterday.
The Department of Health defended last year's mass vaccination
programme, saying it prevented a measles epidemic which could have cost
up to 50 lives.
It insisted there was no evidence of children suffering long-term side
effects from the combined measles and rubella (German measles) vaccine.
More than seven million boys and girls aged up to 15 were vaccinated
last November during the #20m campaign.
Although 100 children were known to have had a serious adverse
reaction, all made a full recovery, the department stressed.
A number of parents were reported to be taking legal action over the
effect the vaccinations had on their children.
The parents' group Justice Awareness and Basic Support (Jabs) said it
was aware of more than 80 families with children who fell ill.
Forty of these appeared to have long-term and in some cases crippling
illnesses, including epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis and encephalitis, it
said.
It was claimed there was no solid proof an epidemic had been about to
start and the Government had misled parents about the need for
vaccinations.
The department said it had not been made aware of any legal action and
challenged the parents to back their allegations with evidence.
A spokesman said: ''We vigorously deny these unsubstantiated claims.
We believe our vaccination campaign prevented a measles epidemic in 1995
which could have led to the deaths of up to 50 children and permanent
brain damage for hundreds more.
''We had evidence from the World Health Organisation and other
independent scientists that an epidemic was on its way.''
He said of Jabs: ''This group takes a very dogmatic view of
vaccinations and believes they shouldn't be done at all. If they want to
make these claims, let them come up with some evidence.''

<HEADLINE>Urgent inquiry sought on Government's BOO plans</HEADLINE>

THE Commons Scottish Affairs Select Committee is being asked to hold
an urgent inquiry into the Build, Own, and Operate schemes, being
promoted by the Government as the method of attracting private finance
to new water and sewerage develpoments in Scotland.
The initiative for the inquiry has come from the Liberal Democrats,
whose Scottish leader Jim Wallace has made a formal request to the
committee chairman, Kilmarnock and Loudoun Labour MP Willie McKelvey.
The request follows a report that BOO schemes fail any reasonable
value-for-money test, and that their use imposes an excessive and
unnecessary burden on council-tax payers and business ratepayers.
There are also claims that the entire Government private finance
initiative scheme, launched by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke in 1993, is in
chaos because of a bottleneck caused by complex negotiations.
Strathclyde has argued that the BOO schemes envisaged under the PFI
for water and sewerage would cost both council taxpayers and business
ratepayers more than twice the traditional option -- councils borrowing
from the National Loans Fund.
The Scottish Office hotly disputes the region's figures, arguing that
competition for BOO schemes, and more commercial discipline in their
operation thereafter, will provide value-for-money solutions.
Strathclyde released a further analysis from Chemical Bank, which
compared the alternative ways of replacing the existing Dalmuir sewerage
works, Glasgow, where the capital cost is put at #102m.
Under this, the cost of the Government's BOO scheme is estimated not
at double, but at between 44% and 55% higher than conventional loans
fund financing, depending on how much risk the successful private bidder
takes on.
Chemical Bank says the BOO schemes, as planned, still fail any
value-for-money test but the Scottish Office insists the analysis is
flawed and that money will be saved in the long term.
In his letter to Mr McKelvey, Mr Wallace states that the Government's
attempts to refute the Chemical Bank report have been ''half-hearted and
half-baked''.
Mr Wallace points out that The National Audit Office, the Government
spending watchdog, cannot investigate BOO schemes until after they have
been built, by which time the extra cost will have been paid. Mr
Wallace, MP for Orkney and Shetland, told The Herald yesterday: ''We are
anxious this should be properly looked at before the new water
authorities come into being, and before they start entering into
contracts on the BOO scheme.''
An inquiry into BOO schemes would prove politically sensitive for the
Tory members of the committee, which did not sit for years because of
the reluctance of Tory MPs to serve on it.
The private finance initiative has been seen as something of a
Government flagship and the Tory members -- who include Scots
backbenchers Allan Stewart, Bill Walker, and Phil Gallie -- may be
uncomfortable with an investigation which could result in a report
critical of the Government.
On the other hand, they may welcome the chance to defend the
Government's strategy.

THE Euro-money name game has a winner. Monnet, Florin, Franken,
Shilling, and Ecu all put in their tuppence worth, but the European
single currency is set to be called the ''Euro''.
''Euro meets all the criteria,'' Belgian finance minister Philippe
Maystadt said after a weekend debate by EU finance ministers and bankers
in Valencia, Spain.
The name may score nil points for originality but it does end years of
wrangling.
''For France the good denomination is the Ecu,'' Bank of France
governor Jean-Claude Trichet told the meeting. It was not only the name
given to the present European Currency Unit used for EU accounting, it
was also the name of a coin used in medieval France.
However, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl did not like Ecu because it
sounded like the German word for cow. It also sounds like cow in broad
Scots too, while it vaguely resembles dog in Gaelic.
Other suggestions included Florin, Franken, and Shilling. Some people
had proposed Monnet, in honour of Jean Monnet, the French politician who
helped lay the foundations of the EU after the Second World War.
However, despite French talk of a lack of consensus, officials
insisted there had been a breakthrough at the talks and, once government
chiefs give the final go-ahead, it will be the Euro which is adopted.
They said the ministers and central bank chiefs had discussed whether
to break the news of their agreement in principle to the public or to
keep it secret, to be unveiled at the Madrid summit in December. They
eventually decided it would not be possible to keep the news quiet.
''Euro'' was proposed by German finance minister Theo Waigel.
Until now most countries have favoured Ecu but Bonn is against that
because of links to the ECU ''basket of currencies'', which has steadily
devalued in recent years.
The meeting in Spain also unanimously backed 1999 as the deadline for
switching to a single currency, whatever it is called. The determined
stand was a bid to reassure nervous world markets, but there were
conflicting reports about just how much progress was being made on key
technical aspects of the change.
''The date is 1999. Confirmation has come without exception. It's very
encouraging,'' European Commission spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas said.
Britain said there was still disagreement on a set of technical steps
proposed for the jump into a single currency.
The 15 EU leaders are due to reach a final decision at the summit in
Madrid.

SNP rides high in poll as Labour takes a fall
LABOUR enters its conference week with a drop in the polls to its
lowest standing in Scotland for more than a year -- and with the SNP
dramatically shortening the gap, according to a System Three poll for
The Herald.
Labour are on 46%, down 11 points since its high point in July --
while the SNP has climbed eight points over the same period to reach
30%. The figures match the SNP's best rating of last year but that was
achieved on the back of a highly successful European election campaign.
Since the Nationalists' heyday of the mid 1970s, this month's poll
rating has been bettered only during the months following their Govan
by-election victory in 1988.
SNP leader Alex Salmond called the surge a ''dramatic sea-change in
opinion'' which could be put down to three factors.
He cited the party's ''head and heart'' campaign capitalising on the
Braveheart film while spelling out the economics of independence, a
highly successful conference, and a backlash against what he claimed had
been a negative smear campaign against them by Labour.
Mr Salmond said the poll tended to bear out what they were hearing on
the streets and he said that since the launch of their Braveheart
campaign, with activists leafleting cinema queues, membership
applications were running at the unprecedented rate of almost 60 a day.
He said: ''The last two months are of fundamental significance.''
It showed that their ''head and heart'' initiative was striking home
with great success.
''The more people see of the SNP, the more they appear to like us. In
contrast, the more people in Scotland see of New Labour, the less they
are trusted.
''Labour are not trusted on economic and social policies and on the
constitution, and are starting to suffer as a result for their
Southern-focused policies.
''In addition, (Shadow Scottish Secretary) George Robertson's
unpleasant smear campaign against the SNP has rebounded in spectacular
fashion.''
SNP strategists point out that all previous surges in support
comparable to this one have come on the back of hustings and electoral
victory.
Labour dismissed it as a ''rogue poll'' because it was conducted
between September 21 and 26, coinciding with the climax to the SNP
conference in Perth.
They refused to be rattled by the poll, even though others in England
in recent days indicated that the honeymoon period of Tony Blair's
leadership may be at an end.
Mr Robertson said: ''This is simply a rogue poll coinciding with the
maximum publicity from their conference.
''It was completely contradicted by the real poll which took place in
Dundee on September 14, when the Nationalists were badly beaten in an
area that used to be one of their strongholds.
''We have been at a very high level, historically, and there has been
some bad publicity over the summer affecting the national picture, but
our lead is still commanding and we remain the only party that can
challenge the Tories.''
Scottish Conservative chairman Sir Michael Hirst welcomed what he
termed the ''modest but steady'' improvement in their standing -- up 1%
since August -- adding: ''Labour's lead has come unstuck north and south
of the Border as the electorate increasingly sees through their
sound-bite and smile politics.''
Of the three-point rise in Scottish Liberal Democrat fortunes since
August, chief executive Andy Myles said: ''This increase is welcome and
reflects the strong, clear message that came out of our conference in
Glasgow.
''The figures also show that Tony Blair's honeymoon is very definitely
over. People want clear, honest policies. Warm words are no longer
enough.''
With the Tories unable to get above 13% in System Three polling all
year, Mr Salmond added: ''Michael Forsyth is proving to be the first
political leader in history to have no honeymoon period at all.''
Mr Salmond said he had been detecting straws in the wind over the
summer months that something unprecedented was stirring in the Scottish
electorate. Every previous SNP surge had been on the back of specific
electoral successes.
In June this year, a five-point jump to 27% was clearly attributable
to the Perth and Kinross by-election, while last year's July peak of 30%
stemmed from the party's European election campaign.
This month's second successive advance, he said, reflected the
benefits of their new campaigning style. ''I am happier about our
'hearts and heads' campaign than about anything we have done in years,''
he said.
''There is real power in the emotional appeal of Braveheart coupled to
an economic case for independence which is coming through very
strongly.''
This week, the party would be extending its Braveheart campaign, going
beyond targetting cinema audiences to making a more general appeal.
Braveheart, which features Mel Gibson as Sir William Wallace, has been
playing to packed houses in Scotland.
SNP chief executive Michael Russell said last night the leaflet drive
targetting filmgoers had been the most successful the Nationalists had
yet organised.
Thousands of people had returned reply-paid postcards asking for
information about joining the party.
''People really are responding to the film in an intelligent fashion.
They're saying that it raises the whole question of Scottish
independence, and that they're interested in it.''

SIX people were arrested on various breach of the peace charges during
clashes between around 200 loyalists and republicans at a rally
addressed by Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams in Glasgow yesterday.
Mr Adams flew into Scotland on his first official visit to the country
to call on an audience of 400 in Govan Town Hall to support the need for
all-party peace talks and to raise awareness of Ulster politics.
Tempers flared as demonstrators holding up Union flags and Ulster
flags hurled abuse at republican supporters making their way into what
was billed as a cross-party meeting.
Republicans responded by entering the meeting with fists clenched and
scarves wrapped around their faces.
As a line of 40 police officers kept demonstrators on the opposite
side of the road, bottles were thrown at the town hall to cheers of
''scum'' and ''no surrender to the IRA''.
When the trouble escalated, 60 more police officers were drafted in.
Mr Adams was escorted unnoticed into the back of the hall. He was
accompanied by some of the meeting's organisers, the Scottish Committee
for Peace in Ireland, members of the James Connelly Association, and Mr
Jim Devine, of Unison.
Mr Adams told those assembled, who had obtained tickets at #1 each
through trade unions, the SNP, and Labour Party activists, that the main
obstacle to peace after a 14-month IRA ceasefire was the British
Government.
He demanded Mr John Major assert his authority in a bid to keep the
peace process moving. On the eve of the Labour party conference, there
were also sharp words for Tony Blair. Mr Adams warned him he could not
continue to ape Tory party policy on Ulster.
He went on to warn that, while he was certain there would be peace
eventually in Northern Ireland, the peace process was in jeopardy over
the issue of the decommissioning of IRA arms.
There were, he said, several armed groups in Ulster.
''The largest is the British army, then the RUC, and we have two large
loyalist groups armed by the military establishment. It is no accident
that the British Government are not calling for disarmament and are only
calling for the surrender of one of the armed groups. It's clear to me
that the IRA is not going to disarm.''
Earlier, at a press conference at Glasgow airport, he said the subject
of decommissioning had been flogged to death.
He said later that Scotland and Ireland shared a common historical
legacy. Both, he said, had suffered mass evictions and forced emigration
under English ''colonialism'', although he added Sinn Fein did not want
to get embroiled in the politics of Scottish nationalism.
Departing to a standing ovation, Mr Adams was hurried away from the
town hall in a convoy of cars. The remaining handful of demonstrators
drifted off behind the police lines.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke today lifts the threat of a swingeing cut in
the #14,250m Scottish budget by changing the basis of Treasury
allocation. ''We have a basic understanding about how we allocate money
for Scotland and I have no intention of going back on that and nor does
the Government,'' he said.
Mr Clarke broke off from his November 28 Budget preparation to give
The Herald this undertaking in an exclusive interview. There has been
growing pressure from English Tories to change to a per capita system
instead of allocation of money according to need.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth has been resisting this pressure
since he was appointed last July, when he told The Herald ''over my dead
body''. Now the Chancellor, with whom he is negotiating next year's
budget, backs him.
Under the present system, Mr Forsyth gets 10.66% of the allocation of
English spending departments, despite Scotland's population of only five
million. He gets it as a Scottish ''block'' which he can allocate
according to need. Spending on some areas is much higher -- like health
and local authorities (22%) -- than in the south.
Mr Clarke conceded that English MPs, keen to get more for their own
regions, would like a per capita system for Scotland. He said: ''Any
English Conservative member who raises a change -- forget it. We are not
moving to per capita.''
He hinted though that, in years to come, the Scottish ''block'' might
be reduced. ''We could consider convergence over the long term. I think
that Scotland, compared to England, is provided for very favourably. I
am trying to set aside that I am an Englishman myself . . . I actually
think that Scotland does very well out of the deal.
''Nevertheless, there is a formula, there is an understanding and my
discussions with Michael Forsyth and Chief Secretary William
Waldegrave's discussions with him are on that basis.''
He believes that Scotland does so well out of the existing system of
taxation and spending that he urges voters to reject an Edinburgh
parliament with tax-raising powers.
The Chancellor aims to establish an election-winning ''feel good''
factor for the voters by the end of next year.
''I want people by the end of 1996 or early 1997, to realise that they
are living in a successful enterprise economy and to feel that they and
their families are getting better off.''
With pre-Budget caution, the Chancellor said he was picking a date
''at random'' for the return of the feel-good factor. But it was a clear
message to the Tories, who need him to provide a serious chance of
another election victory, that he can't produce a breakthrough in eight
weeks' time.
He wrote off Labour's plans for a tax-raising parliament in Edinburgh
as ''a pretty silly'' idea.
He believes that a Scottish parliament would mean more tax, not less.
''I think it is a pretty silly idea. I would have thought that the
people who are likely to pay extra tax will think it a silly idea as
well.''
The Chancellor insisted that he could not discuss the detail of his
coming Budget but it looks as though some relief from paperwork is on
its way for hard-pressed businessmen in working out PAYE, National
Insurance, and VAT.
''I shall look at simplification again in the Budget . . . I would
like to make the rules closer together so that it is all less
complicated.'' He made no promises about tax cuts but he said the higher
rate of income tax is ''about right'' at 40%.
''I am convinced that whatever Tony Blair might say, he will bung up
the higher rate of tax. That does have a damaging effect on an
enterprise economy.''
He reaffirmed that he wanted to reduce the overall burden of taxation
and get the balance right between direct and indirect taxation.
