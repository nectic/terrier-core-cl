How good or bad is the Scottish tourist industry?
The Herald investigates.
Tourism is now the biggest global industry. Scotland, with its
glorious and abundant natural assets, should be well placed to develop a
tourist infrastructure the equal of any in the world. But our efforts so
far have been derisory.
The Herald commissioned Jill Crawshaw, one of the UK's most
experienced and respected travel writers, to spend a long weekend in the
Highlands, travelling incognito.
Her three-part report begins today. It amounts to a dreadful
indictment of our tourist industry. Although she did encounter some
kindness, efficiency and helpfulness, for the most part she experienced
amateurish incompetence, rudeness, indifference and a wretched inability
to deliver even the basic requirements of an ordinary tourist.
Her reports will not make happy reading for those involved in this
crucially important industry. They will make particularly depressing
reading for the mandarins of the Scottish Tourist Board.
JILL CRAWSHAW is based in London. She has won many awards, both in the
UK and beyond, for her travel writing. She has been UK Travel Writer of
the Year three times. An Oxford graduate, she has travelled extensively
on all five continents. She is a former travel editor of the Daily Mail
and the (London) Evening Standard and is one of the judges in the
Hotelier of the Year Awards. She currently writes for the Independent on
Sunday and the Times. She also contributes regularly to Weekend Extra in
The Herald.
MY always friendly and normally efficient travel agent was stumped; he
could offer me packages to Goa or Phuket, he could particularly
recommend a riverbank hotel in Luxor -- but when I asked what he knew
about holidays in Scotland, he admitted cheerfully: ''Not a lot''.
He did add two dubious assets with which Scottish tourism appears
forever to be linked; that after a ''wee dram'' or three, I might even
spot the Loch Ness monster.
But eventually, after rooting around his back room, he did produce a
Scottish Tourist brochure.
''It looks quite pretty, doesn't it?'' he commented helpfully,
returning to his perusal of Last Minute Bargains to Florida (from #290
for the flight and two weeks' car hire) and winter cheapies to Tunisia.
It was not the most auspicious beginning. But deciding to tackle the
challenge at source, so to speak, I rang the Scottish Tourist Board in
Edinburgh.
''Is that the Scottish Tourist Board,'' I asked politely, having
received a mere ''hello'' in reply to my call.
''Yes.''
Then silence. My turn to speak.
''I'm thinking about a weekend in Scotland in late September, and I'd
like some advice.''
With the icy tones that the Scots often reserve for those with
southern English accents... ''I'll put you through to information'' was
what I got.
I suppose a ''Thank you for your inquiry'' might have been nice, but
then this isn't America.
My next contact at least seemed a bit gentler. To my same inquiry:
''Oh, we don't SELL holidays. I can send you a general brochure.''
Honestly, I tried. What about the Highlands, perhaps? ''I'll send you
the general brochure.''
I'd heard there was a Burns Festival. She didn't know about that, but
she'd send me the brochure.
(Memo to the lassie for future reference: the Burns Festival is in
January, and is clearly described on page 14 of the blessed General
Brochure entitled ''For more than Auld Lang Syne'', illustrated in
glossy colour).
A call to the London office elicited no more information, but they
sounded a deal less unhappy at hearing from me.
The rest you can guess..... they couldn't recommend any particular
areas..... they explained with some distaste, that of course they don't
sell holidays (though why not, I ask myself, is it such a revolutionary
concept since no one else appears to do so either?).
And yes, they did promise to send me a brochure.
Out of curiosity, I rang the Irish Tourist Board, who were much better
on information and even suggestions. They also promised to send me
brochures which never did arrive. It seems you pays your money and takes
your choice.....
Brownie points to Edinburgh -- their package, costing 155p in postage,
arrived within two days, beating London's 145p-worth by three days.
Ravelston Terrace's contents included the colourful ''Scotland -- When
will you go'' and ''Events in Scotland'' which included surf rodeos,
jolly boat championships, the Kingussie Golf Competition, the Knitting
and Needlecraft Fayre, the Lochaber People's Half Marathon and... the
Lucozade Junior Foot Tournament -- all good solid stuff no doubt, but
which hardly set the pulse racing, though the Common Riding and
Black-Faced Sheep Shearing sounded more promising.
The London offerings when they arrived were rather baffling; the
glossy brochures were on East Lothian, the Scottish Borders, Kirkcaldy
District, North East Fife, and the South of Scotland Guide which even my
feeble grasp of the geography of the British Isles tells me are somewhat
distant from the Highlands.
I trudged back to my travel agent and tried first of all for the
reprieved Fort William sleeper service which, he thought, left King's
Cross Station (which turned out to be Euston), and was full anyway.
''Must be the huntin', shootin' and fishin' crowd.'' he mused. I
prayed for no more Loch Ness jokes.
But the next joke was definitely on me.
The Friday afternoon flight to Inverness, returning Monday or Tuesday
from Glasgow cost me..... #250, admittedly allowing some flexibility,
and there were some cheaper late evening flights.
For #250 my agent could sell me an autumn week with hotels in Turkey
or Tenerife, and two weeks in the Balearic Islands, Costa Brava or Costa
Blanca -- all with flights, transfers from the airport, hotel or self
catering accommodation, with some meals thrown in.
It would probably cost a little more to get to Goa or Phuket, and the
riverbank hotel in Luxor began to seem increasingly attractive and
affordable.
By now a major stockist of Scottish tourist literature, I set about
choosing a hotel for my first night in Inverness, looking for medium
grade, reasonably priced accommodation.
Enter the STB's ''When will you go'' book, with 80 pages of listed and
graded hotels, plus the STB Quality leaflet which assured me that,
''Just like you, the STB Inspectors appreciate clean, well furnished and
heated establishments, and they know that quality should be assessed
irrespective of the range of facilities they offer.'' Fair enough, OK by
me.
I first of all rang the Palace, 4 Crowns, ''Commended'', reflecting
''a good overall standard''. The price advertised in the brochure, B&amp;B
from #29 a night seemed reasonable too -- except that when I phoned, the
only room they could offer was #59 -- while the 4 Crowns ''Commended''
Windsor, also #29 for B&amp;B, offered me one for #50.
The Station Hotel was only 4 Crowns ''Approved'', described as
reflecting ''an acceptable overall standard''. They didn't list a price,
but did say that ''discounts are available throughout the year''.
''We've got a single room without facilities for #42, with facilities
it costs #62.'' What about the discount? ''That's all we can offer,'' I
was told firmly. I booked the #42 room. The die was cast.
There were plenty of guide books at the newsagents in the Domestic
Terminal 1 of Heathrow airport -- for San Francisco and Prague,
Stockholm and Rome, but none of Scotland. Maybe I should have nipped
across to the Long Haul Terminal 4! Instead, I scanned my fellow
passengers soon to embark on my flight, departing at 1400 hours.
There seemed few if any of the gun and rod brigade, but I suppose
they'd hardly wear their green wellies in the plane. A small clutch of
Japanese men with brief cases rather than cameras, heading for a
conference or convention perhaps. A man in Salvation Army uniform --
Security insisted that his hat went through the X-ray machine -- and a
child wearing Mickey Mouse ears and Celtic stripes, returning home to
Inverness, I discovered, from a Florida holiday.
With my airline apple and meringue tart I bribed him for an instant
survey of local holiday habits; he'd spent some of his holiday with
relations in London, and two weeks in Florida.
On other occasions, he'd been to Edinburgh on a school trip, likewise
to Skye. Oh, the blase youth of the 1990s, my young friend couldn't
remember how often he'd been to Spain, but he did remember that they
didn't holiday in Scotland.
Florida was his favourite, so we discussed Disney's The Pirates of the
Caribbean, as well as Gazza's hairstyle. Then the clouds parted just
beyond Edinburgh, the afternoon sun dappled the bare rumpled hills, and
my spirits soared as the plane banked over the Moray Firth, gently
coming in to land at Inverness, Gateway to the Highlands...
For so many tourists, taxi drivers are the first and last impression
of a country; I try to take a taxi when I first arrive, to find out some
of the stuff that doesn't get into the guide books.
The most entertaining are in the West Indies, where they'll fill you
in instantly and unasked on the local economy, politics and cricket (all
dire); the worst are in New York, where they not only don't know the
way, but are surly with it.
''Conversation costs extra'' one snarled from under his head protector
against mugging, when I tried questioning him about the best places to
go in So-Ho, in Manhatten. Only in Manchester, in my experience, do taxi
drivers still open the door for you, and help you with your luggage.
I didn't get that from my young Inverness driver, but he was polite
enough; ''Well, there's the Castle,'' he replied to my query about local
highlights, ''that's nice, and the shopping streets...''
I queried about Culloden: ''Yes, that's nice... there's not much
else.'' Then, as an enthusiastic afterthought he added: ''You should go
to Glencoe, that's really nice!''
Oh how I wish I'd heeded his advice as I heaved my bag down the empty
corridors to my #42 room at the Station Hotel, Inverness!
From the outside it looked like a pre-war postcard, stately even
mellowed by age. Inside, the regal staircase that swept down to the
lobby looked worthy of Gone with the Wind -- they're a grand old breed
these station hotels, crying out for careful restoration, modernisation
and investment.
Certainly my cell-like room, No. 222, was the genuine, untouched
article; it measured 9ft 4ins by 11ft, clean enough, with tea-making
equipment, television, a hairdryer, a nice little bowl of fruit and, a
rare luxury as I was to discover later, a telephone.
When booking, I decided that I was not prepared to pay the extra #20
for a room with a bathroom -- but the one down the corridor was.....
unappealing; a cold lino floor, a basin so minuscule you could hardly
get both your hands in it at the same time, a bathmat but no towels, and
worst of all, as I was to discover during a long night, a faulty catch
on the door which a long succession of night visitors tried to secure by
banging it shut.
But this was a loo with a view, over a series of sheds it is true, but
to the river beyond.
I would have swopped that happily with my bedroom -- the view I mean;
I'd scarcely hoped for an unrestricted backdrop of heather-clad hills
and misty mountains -- single rooms in my experience are often converted
servant's rooms, and as such not worthy of a great panorama.
But I was unprepared for the sheer horror of it all as I gazed out
through my cracked window pane, over the inside well of the hotel, its
once white (I suppose) walls streaked with grime, huge pipes and
crumbling, peeling window frames encrusted with pigeon droppings.
I thought wistfully of the last hotel I'd stayed in exactly three
weeks earlier, the All Star in Orlando, with two huge double beds, a
fridge, television, bathroom, soap and other unguents, looking out over
a huge swimming pool and garden, that had cost the two of us a total of
$69, say #45, admittedly without breakfast.
Or the one in Dinard in France where our double room had a delightful
terrace by the pool, for 460 Francs, #62, with Continental breakfast.
And here I was, on my own, paying #42, though Scottish breakfast (about
which more later) was included.
So even though it was only 4.30 in the afternoon, I drew the curtains,
made no excuses and left -- to tour Inverness.
The sturdy streets looked positively welcoming after Room 222 (a
number which will ever be etched in my mind), the Tourist Information
Centre was open, superbly stocked with..... brochures, and the
delightful, friendly and helpful girl utterly incorrect about most of
the information she gave me. It was a pattern with which I soon grew
familiar.
Perhaps it was out of kindness that she told me nothing would be open
after 5pm but there, immediately behind the Centre rose the Castle, and
with it my spirits.
Even if it wasn't the Macbeth original, it was imposing enough, and
there at last was a view, from the battlements over the river, and
leaning over the battlements was a lad in a red jacket, beard and kilt,
in Reebok trainers.
''I'm a cast member,'' he explained to my enquiring looks, ''and I've
nipped out for a fag.
''We do 32 performance a day,'' though not explaining what
performances, ''and we're just about to start the last one.''
Which is how a handful of bemused visitors and I became the latest
recruits to the Highland Regiment, having first had to pay #2 entrance
fee for the privilege.
We were then ushered through a series of rooms, supposedly barracks,
where we were ''sworn in'', shouted at and cursed by different members
of the cast. We were not your ideal, responsive participants; the
American joined in gamely, the Italian couple understood not a word, and
I left profoundly depressed -- as I have done on similar excrutiating
occasions in many other countries.
A couple of the lads taking part were trainee actors, and even after
so many performances, delivered their banal lines with a passion that
was miraculous -- and although I hated every second of it, I cannot
sneer at such enthusiasm.
Just at the thinking behind it, that allows such a tatty display, 32
times a day, in such a magnificent setting and largely, by such nice
people.
I spent the rest of the evening in the Station Hotel -- sad that my
family back home could watch the Ryder Cup on Sky Television.
In the hotel, the Scottish Tourist Board literature stand was empty,
and remained so for the duration of my short stay, but the dusty
bookcase in the lobby was a treasure trove of guide books -- on the
Cornish countryside, Devon, Flanders and Brussels. The only Scottish
offering I could find was the October '94 issue of Executive Travel,
with a feature on Inverness Airport.
Oh, and there was a 1985 issue of Historic Homes and Gardens, and best
of all, a 1967 Readers Digest, marked at three shillings.
Dinner in the hotel was good, the waitresses efficient and cheerful,
but it was like eating in a rose pink Renaissance funeral parlour; the
room which could have held maybe 100 diners, rattled somewhat with four
singles, and about five elderly couples, who, in true British tradition,
never spoke a word to each other.
Are we too used to telly dinners, or is there some Calvinist or
Puritan guilt about enjoying food and drink?
And enjoy it I did -- the best mussels I've had this year, venison, a
selection of Scottish cheeses and, defying the suspicious looks of some
of my fellow diners, a half bottle of wine, all for about #16, which was
excellent value for money.
If it had only been a bit jollier! On the Continent, and particularly
in Italy and France, two people can create a hubbub as they positively
shout at each other.
Here, at last one of my fellow diners broke the silence: ''Shall we go
dear,'' he said.

GLASGOW Accies took a firm hold of Division Three of Premiership. As
they were beating Grangemouth 33-10 at Anniesland, Biggar slipped up in
the derby at Peebles, leaving Accies out on their own.
Accies began with a second-minute try from centre Mike Davis. Calum
MacGregor converted and immediately carved through the Grangemouth
midfield defence. However, it was Accies rather than the visitors who
believed it was going to be an easy win.
Grangemouth gave as good as they got in towsy forward exchanges, so
although MacGregor kicked a penalty, it was no surprise when powerful
right wing Iain McFarlane ended a run with a clever chip to Accies'
line, where Mike Tuckerman scored with Kenny Halliday converting.
Although MacGregor's penalty let Accies turn leading 13-7, Halliday
immediately brought the score back to 13-10. However, in the final
quarter, Accies got their rucking right. MacGregor kicked his third
penalty, converted Jonathan Williams' try, and scored the third try.
Dummying to a four-man overlap, he cleared the cover and advanced on
the visiting full back, feinted to go right, came to a complete halt,
and stepped inside to touch down, convert, and close proceedings with
his fourth penalty.
Peebles dominated the opening half to deserve their 15-3 lead through
five Andre Bell penalties. Biggar stormed back thereafter and despite
tremendous defensive work from fullback Gordon Wilson they got over for
a try through Simon Reed converted by Dennis Lavery, who also kicked a
penalty.
Having lost at the last gasp the week before, Peebles feared the worst
with two minutes left as ex-Peebles man Lavery stepped up for a penalty.
However, it failed and Peebles were home by 15-13.
Biggar's loss brings Kirkcaldy back into the reckoning and the Fifers
were so far ahead that they should have beaten winless Corstorphine by
more than 47-10. The season's best performance brought seven tries via
Keith Ferguson (2), Ian Brocklebank, Ross Dewar, Alex Carruthers, and
John Mitchell (2), with Mitchell also kicking three conversions and two
penalties. David Zavaroni was Haddington's try scorer. George Liddle
kicked the conversion and a penalty.
Musselburgh knew the benefit of new recruit from Gala, Graham Paxton,
as they won 21-8 over Preston Lodge at home. Andy McLeod and Stuart
Young grabbed the Musselburgh tries, Scott Gilliland going over for PL.
* JASON White, capped for Scottish Schools while he was at Cults
Academy last season, will make his debut for Lothian in the Bank of
Scotland schools district championship match against Midlands at
Goldenacre tomorrow. The lock forward, now at Watson's College, missed
the win over South earlier this month because of injury, but he now
joins four Myreside colleagues in the Lothian pack.

SHINTY
KINGUSSIE emphasised their complete superiority in the modern game,
winning Saturday's annual Aviemore Mountain Resort indoor six-a-side
championship for the fourth year in a row.
Two goals down to Glenorchy in their first match, Kingussie eventually
powered their way to a 3-2 win. They then demolished Tayforth 5-0 before
beating Newtonmore 2-1 in a thrilling semi-final.
In the final, they met Fort William who had overcome the surprise
packets Beauly, 3-1. Two goals from Ronald Ross -- which brought his
tournament tally to nine -- saw Kingussie on their way. Captain Dave
Anderson, playing with four stitches in a cut chin, added a third to
clinch the title.
Ronald Ross was chosen as the Player of the senior tournament for the
second successive year.
What had been a somewhat low-key re-vamped tournament had been brought
to life by the juvenile competition won by Inverlochy who defeated
surprise packets Rockfield Primary from Oban, in the final.
Ross Brown of Wester Ross, a five-goal hero, for his own side, was
selected the juvenile player of the tournament.
Outdoors, Scottish junior champions Fort William defeated Beauly 7-0
in a preliminary tie. The other Badenoch side Kingussie, disposed of
Lochbroom 7-0. Top scorers were Lovat who outclassed Kinlochshiel 10-1.
Three players have been suspended following the bruising league match
between Fort William and Kilmallie.
Fort's Robert Douglas was banned eight games for his dismissal along
with Grant Jamieson of Kilmallie, who is banned for four. Kilmallie's
Garry MacKay, also ordered off in the game which saw several players
hospitalised, is banned for three.

BOXING
JOE Calzaghe may have the power of a piston and the pace of a runaway
train, but there is little doubt that his engine needs some fine tuning.
The need for a bit more control was apparent as Calzaghe won the vacant
British super-middleweight title in his fourteenth professional fight by
halting Scotland's Steve Wilson in the eighth round at the Royal Albert
Hall on Saturday.
The young Welshman too often was wild with his attacks but rightly
argues that the finesse will come with experience -- and better
sparring.
That means Calzaghe may have to shift his training base before fights
from Wales to the London area.
It was Calzaghe's first time in front of the ITV cameras which,
despite his high-pace triumph, must rate overall as something of a
disappointing screen test.
''I've got a lot to learn. I've only been beyond four rounds twice,''
admitted the new 12st champion. ''I have a long way to go in my career.
Maybe I was trying too hard to impress. I hurt Wilson with a right in
the first round, and got too excited. I couldn't land another good
punch.''
With Chris Eubank retired and Nigel Benn a couple of WBC title
defences away from following his old rival into calmer pastures, the
division can open up for a smoother and more controlled version of the
former three-times ABA champion.
Good class American opposition can be beneficial for Calzaghe, but he
is not quite ready to step up, reckons joint-manager Mickey Duff.
Co-manager Terry Lawless added: ''Joe needs some rough edges cleaned
up. I was anxious to find out how he would cope with the pressure of a
British title fight.''
0 Luton's Billy Schwer copied Calzaghe with an eighth round success in
his Commonwealth lightweight title defence against the South African
Ditau Molefyane -- and now waits for a call to challenge for the
European championship.
Within the next couple of weeks, purse offers will be demanded for
leading-contender Schwer's European title engagement with the French
holder, Angel Mona.
Victory over Mona in a January or February fight would rocket Schwer
way back up the rankings, a year after his cuts loss to IBF champion
Rafael Ruelas in his first world attempt.
Manager Duff realises it will take a substantial cash bid to bring the
fight to Britain. Mona is popular in his homeland and the French
television stations pay well to screen their top fighters.
Duff, though, will be armed with the backing of ITV to stage
Mona-Schwer in Britain in the new year.
Schwer decked Molefyane twice before the intervention of referee Larry
O'Connell when the South African had been knocked through the ropes,
nose bleeding heavily from the early rounds as testimony to the
champion's stiff punching.
''I did not have as much sharpness as I would have liked,'' said
Schwer, who had not fought for four months and believed he may have
over-trained.
Vitally, Schwer did not get cut. His special diet and treatment to
harden up his features following the bloody loss to Ruelas appears to be
working.
British performance of the night must rate as Billy Hardy's European
featherweight title triumph over the French holder, Medhi Labdouni, in
the Paris suburb of Fontenay-sous-Bois.
Hardy, 31, won by the convincing margins of 117-113 (twice) and
116-112, overcoming a champion who had been unbeaten in 18 fights -- a
sequence stretching back to March, 1991.
''Give me Naz,'' was Hardy's plea after his upset in his fifteenth
major title fight. He was, of course, referring to a showdown with WBO
featherweight king, Prince Naseem Hamed.

GLASGOW'S selectors met yesterday at Hughenden to pick their men, a
task that no doubt will have occupied their minds quite considerably.
It's a dreadful job having to pick a team -- the Scottish selectors
will be having some fun right now -- but it can be even trickier picking
the right coaches, and I rather suspect that some of the Glasgow men
will be having a few doubts at the moment.
I'll take you back. As an international player, it was always a wonder
to me just how much I respected some of the people who were in control
of me, and how much I despised and silently mocked some who thought they
could coach but couldn't. I could step up a level as a player, and yet
go down a level with the standard of coaching.
The reason you find so few former players criticising Jim Telfer is
that we remember him as our coach. It always disturbed me just how much
of an effect Telfer had on my life as a young man. In short, he was like
a second father. I fought to impress him. We all did.
It was like little boys grovelling at a father's boots for his
respect, a respect that was given only grudgingly. So we remember that.
But there were others, and I won't name them, who were absolutely
rubbish. Dreadful. Even well up the ladder. And, no matter how hard you
tried, you could not play for these blokes.
Coaches have a huge effect on a team, and what is becoming
increasingly obvious now is that rugby is becoming more like American
Football with its short-yardage game, and so the technical direction and
precision of the practices become even more important.
I sat beside Kevin McKenzie at a dinner recently and he told me that
he marvelled at Richie Dixon's ability to take game situations and adapt
them into training practices.
Stuart Reid told me last week that Henry Edwards is doing the same at
Boroughmuir. Has the Melrose pack been as coherent since Telfer stopped
''doing'' the forwards? I don't think so.
In England, the players take much more to do with coaching -- as they
do in New Zealand and South Africa -- but here in Scotland, we rely
heavily on the man with the duties to direct. Players have to believe in
a coach, they have to trust in a coach, and when they do both, it gives
them an edge in any game in which, on paper, both teams are equal.
So why does this impinge on Glasgow? Well, I have done some digging,
and it appears that one of the reasons some of the players have left the
Glasgow team to go to the North and Midlands is that they don't rate the
coaching set-up in the city's team. That is one hell of an indictment.
Whether the accusation is justified or not, I don't know. Whether they
see blaming the coaches as a nifty excuse is anyone's guess, but the
accusation must now be investigated by those at the top of Glasgow's
tree.
It may just be a credibility gap. For instance, the Stirling boys --
and it is they who have gone to the North and Midlands -- are coached
daily by Brian Edwards, who knows his onions. I apologise again if I
make any mistakes here, Brian. Daily is a crucial word.
When they go to Glasgow they are coached only periodically by the
coach. And here the word periodically is crucial, too; plus it will be
very difficult for a coach to tell a whole bunch of players from
Stirling, a successful club, to play now in the style of a less
successful team.
And, quite honestly, that is where we are in the West at the moment.
There is a powerful players' voice, which, in this instance, has to be
listened to for the benefit of the game in the big city. I believe that
the right coaches have to be installed in charge of the team to get the
right kind of respect from all of the players involved, and I believe
that the set-up is almost there now. The players are there, and the
management is there.
The players tell me that they rate Kevin Greene, the Glasgow Accies
coach, highly. And so they should, as Greene, a former scrum half in New
Zealand, coached Waikato to the Super 10s, and received an award in his
native country for being the best coach among all sports.
He is to take charge of the Glasgow team for two games -- Leicester
and Griqualand West -- but Glasgow could do themselves a favour by going
further than that.
Glasgow should copy Scotland now, and have Greene in charge with the
able Colin Mair as assistant in the backs, and Gordon MacPherson and
Hugh Campbell in charge of the forwards. When it comes to coaching,
quite a few things matter, but few matter more than respect and
pedigree.

KILMARNOCK won the Ayrshire derby 19-8 to stay at the top of
Premiership IV, but now they find themselves alone after Gordonians
scored their second win over Glasgow Southern to open up possibilities.
Despite dominating possession and territory, Kilmarnock led only 7-0
at the turn. Midway in the half an outrageous steal by Stewart Kerr put
Stewart Bennett romping through for the try converted by Phil Gordon.
Although Craig Foster pulled back a penalty for Ayr soon after the
restart, Robbie Stewart's timely intrusion put Tony Finnigan away for a
fine try converted by Gordon. Ayr's hopes were raised by a try from Andy
McLean but Finnigan's support try, after Stuart Jenkins had been held
short, made sure for Killie.
A tough forward battle at Countesswells saw countless penalties, two
Southern forwards warned, and only three tries in a 33-16 scoreline to
Gordonians. Southern led 16-9 at the turn, with John Clinkenbeard
scoring and James Dunlop converting, besides dropping a goal and kicking
two penalties.
Bruce Doney had kicked three penalties for Gordonians. However, from
the restart, left winger Andy Rose was set away. When he was high
tackled on the line a penalty try was awarded and converted by Doney to
tie the scores.
Four penalties from Doney across the subsequent 38 minutes prologued a
last-minute try. Flanker Kevin Wyness, head swathed in bandage from
earlier Southern footwork, fittingly finished off a pushover.
Southern now face a home fixture with Langholm, who closed on them
with a 16-6 home win over bottom club Wigtownshire. However, the
Borderers will have to improve on this performance, which was ruined by
purposeless kicking by both sides.
Two early penalty successes by Langholm's Robin Masterton were later
matched by David Drysdale. In the second half Masterton kicked a third
penalty before, in 71 minutes, a try finally arrived. Stuart Mabon was
the man to touch down with Masterton converting.
Edinburgh Wanderers' Kiwi stand-off Carl McWilliam continued to
impress. His two converted tries and two penalties allowed
relegation-threatened Wanderers to lead 20-3 as they switched ends with
Haddington. However, a motivating speech by home captain Brian Craig
sparked a fightback.
Tries from Craig and David Cunningham (2), all converted by Phil
Hodgson, who also kicked two penalties, seemed to have got Haddington
the win until, in the last minute, Wanderers' centre Andrew Wilson broke
through to the posts with McWilliam converting to see them home 30-27.

THE hopes of Scotland's Charlie Kane to become British and
Commonwealth light-welterweight champion lasted less than two rounds
when holder Ross Hale struck with perfect timing at Bristol.
A cut on the right eyelid threatened to undo all Hale's world title
ambitions in front of home-town fans. But a right hook to the temple
midway in the second round toppled Kane, and referee Richie Davies
counted him out as he climbed to his feet.
''That was an important punch for me,'' said Hale. ''With the eye cut,
he was looking for a big win.
''Everyone in the corner was relaxed when I went back after the first.
We all knew what I had to do.''
Former Commonwealth Games gold medallist Kane said: ''I thought I'd
beaten the count. I certainly felt OK to go on.''
The 27-year-old Scot more than held his own in the opening round,
landing some useful left hands.
But with only nine professional fights under his belt -- the last of
them 12 months ago -- he was always going to be vulnerable to his
opponent's greater experience and power.
Hale's victory swept away some of the frustration caused by the
cancellation of his match with WBO champion Sammy Fuentes.
The Puerto Rican pulled out saying he was not ready for the fight --
another setback for 28-year-old Hale, who had two previous world shots
fall through.
He said: ''It is disappointing, but I'm a professional and I just have
to get on with the job.
''I have to be satisfied with this performance. It kept me ticking
over and hopefully the New Year will bring that world title chance.''
Veteran Dennis Andries tuned up for a needle-match British
cruiserweight title return against Terry Dunstan.
In his sixty-third contest, Andries had to work hard for a points win
over American Art Pendergrass.
The former three-times world light-heavyweight champion had stormed
out of the ring in disgust five months ago after having lost a decision
to Dunstan in Glasgow.

IN ENGLAND:
HISTORY eluded Les Ferdinand and Newcastle yesterday as they escaped
from Tottenham grasping a lucky point after a 1-1 draw which increased
their Premiership lead over Manchester United to two points.
But Kevin Keegan pulled the switch on White Hart Lane's giant
television replays to deny an enthralled full house the chance to savour
and judge a magnificent match full of rewatchable moments and bitter
controversy.
Spurs were denied two transparent penalties for hand-ball, partially
balanced by the visiting view that Chris Armstrong's third goal in as
many matches looked half a yard offside after 21 minutes.
Against that, David Ginola's stunning leveller after 47 minutes, the
Frenchman's second goal for the Geordies, came after a clear,
shirt-pulling foul on Dean Austin.
The game was in the crucible right to the death when Ian Walker's two
late saves from Ferdinand denied the 16-goal England contender the
chance to match Willie Wardrope's 100-year-old Tyneside record of
scoring in nine straight matches, and cost Newcastle a club record of
nine consecutive victories.
Meanwhile, Old Trafford did not seem quite sure how to take the news
filtering through from the meeting of the two clubs Manchester United
dislike most.
A 6-0 defeat for Manchester City would normally have been cause for
raucous celebration.
This time glee was tempered by the fact that it was Liverpool who
administered the drubbing, and moved menacingly into third place to
boot.
Ian Rush and Jamie Redknapp claimed two goals each to add to the 4-0
beating City suffered at Anfield only three days earlier in the
Coca-Cola Cup.
Leeds, Nottingham Forest, and Blacburn were all satisfied, too, with
the prelude to another week of European club competition.
The Elland Road side went one down at home to Coventry before
Scotland's captain Gary McAllister stepped in with two goals in two
minutes and then a disputed penalty to complete the first hat trick of
his career.
It will need more of the same to retrieve a 5-3 deficit away to PSV
Eindhoven tomorrow.
Forest, who start with a 1-0 lead against Auxerre, carried their
unbeaten league run to 24 games by drawing 1-1 at Queen's Park Rangers.
After the game, Ray Wilkins confirmed that Mark Hateley will
officially join the London club today and should be fit -- despite press
reports to the contrary -- within ''two or three weeks''.
Blackburn warmed up for Legia Warsaw's visit in the Champions League
by beating Chelsea 3-0, with Alan Shearer inevitably among the scorers.
They intend to add yet another medium-priced midfield player to their
ranks today by signing Graham Fenton from Aston Villa for #1.5m.
So only Everton of the European brigade (''contenders'' seems an
unrealistic word in one or two cases) were left disappointed.
They went down 1-0 at Aston Villa, a scoreline which would put them
out of the European Cup-Winners' Cup if repeated away to Feyenoord on
Thursday.

PETER Monteith, enjoying his best start to a season, was talking
confidently of the Scottish Grand National after his most recent
acquisition, Emerald Storm, won the feature steeplechase in impressive
style at Kelso.
The eight-year-old gelding outjumped his more fancied rivals to take
the Andy Scott Handicap Chase, leaving the others well strung out on the
long uphill haul to the line. It was Monteith's ninth winner, four more
than he had at this stage last year.
A 16,500 guineas purchase at Doncaster in August by Tim Finch, of the
Scottish Bloodstock Agency, Emerald Storm has already repaid almost a
quarter of the outlay by winning #4000. The son of top National Hunt
stallion Strong Gale, he was with Nicky Henderson at Lambourn, where he
won four of his 16 starts.
In April at Punchestown, he was a respectable fourth in the big chase.
Monteith's fears that the trip of two-and-threequarter miles might be
too sharp, were proved groundless as Tony Dobbin drove Emerald Storm
into a challenging position in the back straight.
He took over the lead from Kushbaloo at the fourteenth, and, jumping
boldly, increased his lead to four lengths at the finish.
Kushbaloo, who had won by 14 lengths last time at Carlisle, had to
settle for second place, while Kilcolgan, the 6-4 favourite, was a
disappointing fourth.
As Emerald Storm both jumps and stays well, Monteith and the owner is
now considering whether to enter him for the Scottish version of the
Grand National, if not the Aintree marathon itself.
Harvey Smith overturned the formbook and shook the punters when his
handsome grey gelding Celtic Silver (50-1) won the LCL Pils Novices'
Handicap Chase, despite being overtaken by Killimor Lad at the last. He
battled back on the run-in to regain the lead 50 yards out.
* PETER Chapple-Hyam gained yet another big autumn race victory
yesterday when Polaris Flight held on by a short head to win the
Criterium de Saint-Cloud, France's last Group 1 race of the year.
After a dismal early pace, John Reid took Polaris Flight into the lead
entering the straight.At the post Polaris Flight's lead had diminished
to a whisker over fast-finishing Ragmar, with rank outsider Oliviero a
length back in third.
* WILD scenes of Cheltenham-style celebration engulfed Belmont Park,
New York, on Saturday as Ridgewood Pearl struck gold for Ireland in the
Breeders' Cup Mile.
The filly sparked the amazing scenes after she had secured the $1m
race, repeating the feat of Royal Academy here five years ago.
Owner Sean Coughlan danced into the winners' enclosure waving the
Irish tricolour after his star had beaten Fastness by two lengths with
Sayyedati a gallant third.
It was the one highlight of a meeting that otherwise yielded little
for the British challengers, with Halling trailing in a dismal last
behind the American star Cigar in the Classic.

LADY Sheriff has the able assistance of champion jockey Frankie
Dettori today in her attempt to defy top weight in the Ashington
Handicap at Newcastle.
Mick Easterby's filly has maintained an astonishing level of
consistency this season, boasting a record of four wins, five seconds,
and a third from 14 runs.
Those wishing to oppose her could point to her upwardly-mobile
handicap mark -- from a starting point of 45 at her season's outset to a
career-high 80 for this race.
However, concentrate too much on figures and you fail to appreciate
the filly's marvellous racing attitude.
Off a 2lb lower mark last time, she ran Insider Trader to
one-and-a-quarter lengths at Catterick, just finding the
well-handicapped winner too strong in the closing stages despite
battling all the way to the post.
If Dettori bounces this splendidly tough customer out of stall nine
she can get a favoured stand rails position and see off all challenges.
Mansab, fourth to Trafalgar Lady on his Goodwood debut, takes a drop
in class and is sure to be a popular order in the EBF Amble Maiden.
John Dunlop's juvenile, out of a dam who won the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile, held every chance at the distance at Goodwood, but just found
an extra effort in the closing stages beyond him.
With that experience under his belt, he should register his first win.
Mbulwa should go well in the Bedlington Claiming Handicap. The
consistent nine-year-old put up a good performance at Redcar when making
all to beat Admirals Flame one-and-a-quarter lengths but was not able to
dominate when third to Night Wink at the same course last week.
Trainer Richard Fahey has engaged Ian Balding's promising apprentice
Martin Dwyer and the 7lb that he takes off Mbulwa's back could make the
difference.

AS IN almost every specialist sports, rowing is just a wee bit
recondite in its rules and modes and fashions. You cannot imagine how
many differences there are.
For example, the most famous -- and perhaps least valued, among the
professionals at least -- oary-boat race in the world, the
Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race, is for eights, yet there are actually nine
on a boat.
They don't even oary what anybody would properly call a boat unless
they were oarsmen: it is more like a plank of wood these rowers sit on,
inches above the water.
But Saturday was not eights and it was not what you might call normal
racing in any sport. Saturday's Head of the River Race for scullers, to
youse out there who do not know, is for single rowers, and it is
staggered, with the No.1 chap starting and the No.2 following him
shortly, and then the No.3 top racer going after, and so on.
There were 53 racers at Strathclyde Park, a beautiful location, yet
lacking in the usual amenities because Strathclyde Region doesn't know
its port from its starboard, and not a cup of tea or nip of whisky or
sandwich was in sight, unless you count the Thermos flasks and hip jobs
and nice lassies with packed lunches.
It is said that the administration of this splendid recreation place
is in doubt after the changeover in local government to come, but be
that as it may, anxiety about Strathclyde Park should not be there
because, in the words of wur ain rowing specialist, Mike Haggerty -- a
judge on Saturday -- ''Strathclyde is the envy of the world, the top
rowing course of all.''
What rather worries rowing people is that, when the new local
government changes come into being, the rowing lanes one, two, and three
could be under the jurisdiction of North Lanarkshire, and four, five,
and six under that of the new South Lanarkshire. And you know what
bureaucracies can be especially imaginative about. They invent chaos.
This would be a pity, for next year sees the World Rowing Championships
coming to this stretch of water, with the junior and all the non-Olympic
teams competing.
Head of the River racing is a style which was invented some 60 years
ago to be rather a light relief from winter training. It originated on
the Thames and the two Glasgow Green clubs, Clydesdale and Clyde, have
run it now for nearly 30 years.
Saturday's event was to be especially enlived by the attempt of a new
record in time over the course on the River Clyde by four-times world
lightweight champion Peter Haining, of Balloch and the Loch Lomond club.
Sadly, the Clyde was in spate after the heavy rain over the few days
previously and the race switched to Strathclyde, where the record
attempt would be invalid.
The record for the Clyde scullers' Head course (which was set in 1967,
for heaven's sake) is currently held by none other than that personage,
Parsonage, George, he of the Humane Society, ex-art teacher and old chum
of mine from years back.
George claims, greybeard as he is, that he could hold on to the
record. Mind you, George has recently married, to a smashing girl called
Stephanie, and has a wee son now called Benjamin, showing that even old
artistes like me and George can yet perform. I meant in rowing,
actually.
But actually Peter, who is 34 as against George's 50-plus, is likely
to beat the Parsonage record eventually. Peter, who recently married
another competitor, Rachel (it was very romantic, on Loch Lomond just
last month), is a full-timer, much helped, he says, by Walter Scott of
the SAA Top 100 -- the Scottish Sports Aid Association for the top 100
athletes in their sports.
Parsonage's record is rather difficult to evaluate, because the
differences in the water are so immense from year to year, and because
handicapping for all categories, such as junior, or vets, or women, etc,
vary so much, it is practically impossible to know what a record is at
all.
It does not seem to worry the racers much. Rowers are perhaps among
the nicest people in sport, because they don't think winning is anything
other than a wee warm glow, and often aren't sure if they have won at
all.
Peter was going to attempt the Clyde course anyway, later on in the
afternoon, but the conditions proved impossible. He will try again. In
the meantime, he came in first anyway. Pretty damn good.
I spoke to some of the vets, including Gordon Day of Clyde Masters.
His usual cheery self he was, yet a bit miffed because the BBC, who
wanted to cover Haining's try at a new record, couldn't bother their
bums when the venue was switched.
He was right to be aggrieved. The race is still on, but all the
broadcasting boys want is headlines. The headline is that rowing is not
just for headlines. The Herald, in the shape of your author and chums,
got that right.

ATHLETICS
HOSTS Haddington ELP and East Lothian District Council provided a
course which was little more than a tour of the playing fields for the
National Cross Country Relays at Meadowmill Sports Centre near
Prestonpans on Saturday.
It was a convenient venue with the right adjacent logistics but as a
test of traditional of cross country it failed lamentably, and for the
better track runners it was a stroll in the park.
Tom Hanlon, Britain's top steeplechaser last season on two outings
anchored Leslie Deans Racing Club to their third victory in a row, but
never had to extend himself.
Hanlon who had been encouraged to take part by an impressive midweek
training session which caused no adverse reaction in his chronic back
condition, took over on the last 4000 metres circuit 16 seconds clear of
Shettleston Harriers' fourth runner Graham Wight and that is exactly how
he finished, so perfect was the 28-year-old former Scottish champion's
pace judgement.
He and Wight were timed at 11min 14sec., but the latter had to produce
a sprint to hold off fast-finishing Steve Wylie of Cambuslang Harriers
whose efforts were rewarded by the fastest time of the day, 11-07.
The women's event was less competitive. Inverness policewoman Sheila
Gollan had the fastest time of the day, 13-20, giving Edinburgh Woollen
Mill a narrow lead over Aberdeen for whom Debbie Kilner (13-22) was
second fastest, with Mary McClung giving the East team back the lead
after Carol Sharp had slipped to third behind Aberdeen and Dundee
Hawkhill.
Sandra Branney brought City of Glasgow up from fifth to third on the
last leg (13-44) but it was a shame to see fourth-fastest Ann Buckley's
13-33 contribution wasted on a Hunter's Bog Trotters outfit which failed
to provide a bone fide third runner. Leading results:

MICHAEL Schumacher, after his second victory in Japan, now heads for
the grand prix season's climax in Australia in two weeks' time seeking a
twentieth career victory which would make him the first driver to win 10
races in a year.
Schumacher equalled Nigel Mansell's record of nine wins in a season
with his Suzuka triumph -- and sent the champagne corks popping again in
the Benetton camp as they celebrated their first constructors' crown.
An Adelaide victory, along with another non-finish from Damon Hill,
also would break Mansell's 1992 mark for the biggest margin between
champion and runner-up, as well asthe Englishman's aggregate record of
108 points. Mansell won by 52 points during his year of domination.
Schumacher, who won last year's title by a single point, now totals 102,
43 more than Hill.
''It's been like a dream season for me to have so much happening so
perfectly,'' said the champion.
Meanwhile, Hill, who, along with Williams team-mate David Coulthard,
spun off and out of contention, later admitted his Formula One career
was at its lowest ebb, declaring: ''I have never felt as bad as this.
''The most tempting thing to do is give up and do something else, but
that's not the way forward. That's not what makes me tick.
''Just when you think it couldn't get any worse, it does. There is no
easy way out of this, but we will have to keep pressing on.
''I have made mistakes,'' added Hill, who was also fined #6600 for
speeding in the pit-lane.
The Williams camp was a scene of intense disappointment. Williams
technical director Patrick Head, who is reported to have rowed with both
Hill and Coulthard during a poor qualifying period, said: ''As a team,
collectively, we just weren't good enough. It was as simple as that.''
Schumacher's quest for records has benefited from an extra race, but
as his third convincing win in succession showed, he has no equal.
Once Jean Alesi's challenge had faltered when the Frenchman's Ferrari
engine gave way in the twenty-fifth of the 53-lap race, there was never
any doubt who would be the winner.
Schumacher only gave up the lead briefly, when he pitted for the
second time, with all the drivers having been forced into an unexpected
earlier stop to change from wet to slick tyres because of the variable
weather.
It then began to go wrong for the Williams challenge as Hill found the
gravel at the treacherous Spoon Corner on lap 37 and was forced back
into the pits for repairs.
On the way out, Hill incurred a penalty for speeding, but before he
could serve it, he spun into the gravel at the same spot after 41 laps.
This time his departure was permanent.
Coulthard had exited one lap earlier, having inherited second place,
fallen back to third as he found gravel at Spoon, then hit the tyre-trap
after spinning at the next corner.
''There was a lot of rain in that corner and I just ran wide and into
the trap,'' he explained. ''Then, when I got to the fast corner, I
dabbed my brakes, all the gravel came out of my pods and I spun.''
Schumacher took the chequered flag nearly 20 seconds ahead of
McLaren's Mika Hakkinen with Benetton team-mate Johnny Herbert third.
Herbert, as he did with his victories at Silverstone and Monza, took
advantage of the mayhem in front of him to move up to third and maintain
his hopes of finishing in that position in the championship. He is now
just four points behind Coulthard as the teams head for Australia.
Results:
1, M Schumacher (Germany), Benetton, 1hr 36min 52.930sec (average
speed 120.2mph); 2, M Hakkinen (Finland), McLaren, at 19.337sec; 3, J

ACCORDING to the experts in this field -- Peter McLean of Celtic and
Alistair Hood of Rangers -- precisely 1807 football supporters will
arrive in Glasgow this week with Paris St Germain and Juventus. What
such small numbers show is that Johnny Foreigner has a lot to learn
about the business of placing body and soul in the service of his club.
To make matters worse, they will jet in and out rather quickly,
bringing precious little benefit to our indigenous economy. They will
head from the airport to Parkhead and Ibrox, pausing but briefly at the
Y-front counter of Marks and Sparks.
How unlike our own, dear 8000 Old Firm fans who are still swopping
tales of audacious raids behind enemy lines in Turin and the French
capital. I am indebted to a Rangers friend for his inside story of what
happened among the 5000 who were pinned down in the Stadio Del Alpi.
There is, it appears, a ritual which is conducted among many Scottish
fans when visiting countries with whom were were engaged in hostilities
between 1939 and 1945. It involves grown men running around in small
circles with their arms outstretched while loudly chanting the refrain
from the Dambusters March -- ''Dada, dada, dededa dada.''
It is their way of showing that the Scottish educational system is
pretty damn hot on modern history. However, my Rangers friend thought
that, on grounds of accuracy, he ought to point out to them that Guy
Gibson VC and his squadron of Lancasters were engaged in taking the plug
out of waterworks many hundreds of miles to the north of Turin, indeed
in another country of the Axis powers.
''Mussolini. Fat Tally Fascist. 1942. Okay,'' was the reply. This
seemed to become the lasting mantra of the evening, combined with
repeated shoutings of ''it's going to be eight, it's going to be nine,
it's going to be 10 in a row.''
At the end of this sporting pageant, when the referee blew his final
whistle to deny the Rangers fans further enjoyment of the splendid
Juventus play, they were asked to remain on the terraces for a further
15 minutes.
Rather ungallantly, the authorities had decided not to rely totally on
the supporters' good natures to ensure this request was observed.
Confronting our troops was a party of 500 riot police, their helmets
gleaming, their perspex shields polished and batons drawn. A
state-of-the- art water cannon was placed where the cavalry used to be.
''We're going to charge them,'' said the leading Dambuster. My Rangers
friend opined that this was a display of raw courage much to be admired
but advised him that it was likely to end up in the same undignified
fashion as the British expeditionary force on the beaches of Dunkirk.
''Besides,'' he added, ''I only had my pacemaker fitted last March.''
It has to be reported that the charge did not take place, proving that
the loss of Empire has finally led to the emasculation of our young men.
My young Celtic friend was leaving the Parc des Princes the following
night when approached by a supporter from Wishaw. It turned out that,
earlier in the day, a slight misunderstanding with the gendarmerie near
the l'Arc de Triomphe had meant he had spent many hours in custody,
missed the match and his bus.
This pathetic wretch stood there sans passeporte, sans argent, and
sans porter-hors (carry-out, to the linguistically challenged). My young
Celtic friend took pity on him and managed to persuade a travel agent
that he should be allowed to hitch a lift on his plane, which was not
full. This was duly arranged.
During the flight, he was aware of a certain commotion several rows
behind him and saw that the wretch from Wishaw was engaged in a furious
argument with the stewardess. ''This chicken's tough. Bring me something
better or I'll report you,'' he said. There's gratitude for you.
I hesitate to draw a moral from these snapshots, although it dawns on
me that any self-important politico who believes that there are votes to
be gained by advocating a more integrated Europe, let alone a single
currency, is barking mad. This column sure should make Teddy Taylor's
day.
Or, to paraphrase David Findlay, vice-chairman of Rangers Football
Club: ''We are Scottish. No-one likes us. We don't care.''

LET'S do something off the wall here. Let's open our own ''Hall of
Infamy, a pantheon to the hoary, gnarled legends of football. The truly
grizzly figures like Dave Mackay, Billy Bremner, John Greig and David
Hay.
Real people, and not at all like the cissies who play the game today.
You would never have caught any of the above walking into a dressing
room carrying one of those girly handbags full of deodorants,
aftershave, and styling gel.
It was Brylcreem and a mixture of liniment and Old Spice for them, and
no-one would have dared look in a mirror when they were around, unless,
of course, it was to check the scars.
Recent interest in the sorry tale of Duncan Ferguson and incidents
involving Alan Lawrence and Sean Sweeney proves the old game is short of
more than quality players. It is also shy of another kind of hero -- the
genuine hard man.
You know the type -- he played with clenched fists and teeth, provided
he still had any, gritted. They didn't have necks, probably because they
spent a lot of time shrugging deeply with arms outspread in a display of
innocence -- ''Honest, ref, I never even touched him.''
These players would have laughed at the likes of Ferguson, Lawrence
and Sweeney, and told them to come back with an army. There are no real
hard men left and not even the obnoxious Vinny Jones qualifies. He is
hardly of the same stuff as Mackay or Bremner, tough guys who who sent
shivers down the spines of opponents. They were a breed apart.
If Ferguson had head-butted Mackay he would be in the Royal Infirmary
with a broken cranium and not Barlinnie; had Sweeney tried to kick
Bremner, the Airdrie player would have had his foot bitten off; Jones
might have tried to touch up Greig, but the Englishman would never have
played the piano again.
Like most men of menace, the old-timers had a code of honour. They
didn't take advantage of wimps, although they could laugh at them, as
Baxter and Crerand and co. often did with Alan Ball.
The SFA have their Hall of Fame, in which hangs the portraits of those
internationalists who have gained 50 caps or more, and some pretty
decent footballers smile out from their frames. But not every hero
dangles from a hook within the game's HQ, the players who added colour
and character to the game in their own way.
It is time, I think, to open up a gallery in recognition of the tough
guys, men who tackled head on and didn't sneak in from the side.
In the Hall of Infamy will be pictures of those players who took mince
from no-one, who protected themselves and their own. Mackay, Bremner and
Greig go straight in, and so, too, must Kenny Burns, Gregor Stevens,
Sean Fallon, Don Emery (Aberdeen and East Fife), former Arbroath manager
Albert Henderson, and the late Jim Holton. No frills, just kills.
Some of the above were thoroughly decent human beings away from their
work, but when they pulled on their boots, a metamorphosis more
terrifying than anything that happened to Dr Jekyll came over them.
My own hero was Willie McPheat, who used to play for Airdrie and who
would make a Sweeney or a Jones or even a Julian Dicks look like a
choirboy, or someone even softer like football's own mummy's boy, Gary
Lineker. When McPheat played, there always seemed to be defenders
hanging around . . . usually from their own crossbar.
McPheat was a throwback, but not one totally without consideration for
others. Maybe the older players were just trying to frighten me when I
arrived at Broomfield as an S-form signing, but I was told Big Willie
steeped the toes of his boots in iodine -- so that anyone he tackled
received treatment at the same time.
Where are they today, when our players can be knocked about even by
Italian footballers with the sort of playboy good looks which instantly
would have riled the small, barrel-chested, bent-legged Scots of
yesterday? If we can't have a genuine player, let's at least have a real
hard man in the traditional mould.
In the meantime, the doors to the Hall of Infamy are open.

CRICKET
DEVON Malcolm finally let rip yesterday after having been sent away
for extra lessons. England's troubled fast bowler was dispatched to a
ground 25 miles outside Johannesburg while his team-mates headed in the
opposite direction.
When he returned to Soweto Oval several hours later, 32-year-old
Malcolm produced the sort of accurate fire against a South African
Invitation XI that manager Ray Illingworth and captain Mike Atherton
want to see from him this winter.
He sent down the best bouncer of the tour so far, only to have Mickey
Arthur dropped by keeper Jack Russell as the ball ballooned off the
batsman's glove. Malcolm's next delivery struck Arthur in the rib cage
and, during his third over, Arthur had to change protective helmets
after ducking into another lifter.
The bemused opener must have wondered what he had done to upset
England's No.1 paceman. The answer is nothing. Malcolm simply decided to
respond to some thinly-veiled criticism from inside his own camp.
The decision to send Malcolm to Centurion Park, venue for next month's
first Test, for a net session yesterday morning made a lot of sense,
given that the home side were nine wickets down overnight. But it is
still rare to pull a player out of a match, even for a few hours, and
England would not have done it had they been happy with Malcolm's
progress.
The fast bowler refused to comment, other than saying: ''You'll have
to speak to the manager.'' Illingworth was a little more forthcoming,
saying: ''There didn't seem much point in him hanging around and doing
nothing. Devon needs plenty of bowling to get him off his full run and
bowling properly quick. There are only two more matches after this one
before the first Test.''
Malcolm was not the only England player causing concern. Robin Smith,
with earlier tour scores of 12, 33, and 4, fell for an eighth-ball duck
when he nibbled at a delivery outside off stump from seamer Henry
Williams. He edged a catch behind and headed straight to the Soweto Oval
nets.
But it was by no means all doom and gloom at Soweto. Alec Stewart
followed Friday's 94 with an unbeaten 101, Graeme Hick crunched four 6s
and four 4s in his 55 after Atherton had retired hurt because of a minor
hamstring niggle, and Russell oozed confidence while making 43. It all
enabled England to declare at 282 for five, setting their hosts 405 to
win. Scores:
England 332 (A J Stewart 94, J P Crawley 85, M A Atherton 59; M J G
Davis 4-68) and 282 for 5 decl (A J Stewart 101no, G A Hick 55), SA
Invitation XI 210 (W J Cronje 56, R K Illingworth 6-76) and 25 for one.
* PAKISTAN faced a heavy defeat in their opening first-class tour
match in Australia after a dismal batting performance against Western
Australia. In reply to the home side's 402 for five declared, Pakistan
stumbled to 164 all out yesterday, losing their last six wickets for the
addition of just seven runs.
At close of play on the second day at the WACA ground, Western
Australia were 34 for one in their second innings, a lead of 272 with
two days remaining.
''Whenever we come to Australia, we have to get used to the extra
bounce in the wickets,'' said Aamir Sohail afterwards. ''I think we were
still getting used to that and we also played a couple of irresponsible
shots.'' Scores:
Western Australia 402 for 5 decl (Mike Hussey 146, Brad Hogg 101no)
and 34 for one, Pakistan 164 (Salim Elahi 54, Moin Khan 56).

England 8, Australia 16
I'D STARTED, so they said I should finish. The Halifax Rugby League
Centenary World Cup was lifted, as these wise old souls the bookmakers
insisted it would be, by the Kangeroos, and Matilda went waltzin' down
Wembley Way.
Just three weeks ago, I had watched England turn the tables in the
opening game -- but that was a skirmish, this was the war. Quite
clearly, the better side won in the final and, something the English
must surely ponder, the Aussies became world champions for the fifth
successive time, with many of their best players having never left their
native shores.
Those who are going to play for R Murdoch Esq in the forthcoming Super
League were omitted from this competition. Those who were left were good
enough to complete the task at hand. That does not suggest a lot of
progress in English standards to me.
The home team's tactics in the final bordered on the absurd. England
have two wonderful wingers in the silky speed merchant Martin Offiah and
the pocket rocket, Jason Robinson. Give them the ball wide with a sliver
of daylight and they will shaft the best defences. So, for the entire
first half, they never received the ball wide.
Many times I have seen England exhibit this kind of stupidity in the
union game, playing to their own weaknesses. Is it some strange kind of
national characteristic, one wonders?
Mind you, going to rugby league internationals is about more than just
the game, particularly if you are a neutral. They are decidedly jolly
occasions. I knew where to look for the VIPs this time and observed them
at lunch.
Prince Edward was the chief guest -- I was going to ask him for 10p to
give Buckingham Palace a ring but thought better of it -- and Ken Clarke
was doing to the meat what I hope he does to income tax. Alf Roberts of
Coronation Street was just saying . . . enough, you know how I hate
name-dropping.
For the pre-match singalong we had Status Quo this week, looking about
as old as me but still able to belt out a great Rockin' All Over the
World to a TV audience of 300m. A long burst of Land of Hope and Glory
and we hootered off.
A fourth-minute penalty by Bobby Goulding gave England the start they
had craved. They were so delighted nobody bothered to gather the
re-start kick, Andrew Johns put a grubber past Robinson, and Rod Wishart
was in for the try. To a stunned silence from the home fans Johns
converted from the touchline.
From that moment on England would be playing catch-up.
Goulding gave them hope with a second penalty, but Jones kicked two at
the other end.
At last, with the oranges being sliced, Offiah was given an opening.
It was not even a wide pass, but he burst through three men near his own
line and set sail for the other end.
A metre short, Tim Brasher, the Australian full back, forced him into
touch, but it was quite the most thrilling passage of the day.
The most amazing participant was the England centre, Gary Connolly,
who had been laid low with pneumonia three weeks earlier. He had eaten
mounds of chocolate to put back on the stone he had lost and here he was
tackling anything that twitched.
Paul Newlove gave England new hope with a try three minutes after the
resumption. There was nothing delicate about it -- he simply barged
three defenders out of his way.
A streaker, definitely female, appeared, contributed a couple of good
points, and was led off to the cop shop.
Australia were suitably uplifted and proceeded to score the crucial
try. Frankly, it was a wee bit lucky.
A Brasher kick-through bounced awkwardly for young Tim Radlinski, the
home full back. He thought he had touched it down, but was short of his
line, and while the rest of the defence stood mesmerised Brasher trotted
in for a gift score. Johns, named man of the match, kicked the
conversion.
Johns is actually a scrum half, but turned out at hooker. Can't quite
see that happening in union.
Brad Fittler, the Australian captain, reputed to earn #750,000 per
annum -- eat your heart out, K Logan -- told us: ''This is a very fine
England side and the game could have gone either way.'' Yeah, yeah.
England's leader Denis Betts commented: ''A few mistakes cost us the
game. But we gave everything we had and I was proud of the boys.'' Wish
I had a quid for every time I have heard that quote.
Everyone insisted it had been a wonderful tournament, that more
nations, including Scotland, will emerge to play this game, that a
merger of league and union is inevitable. We'll see.
Jonathan Davies appeared from the television studio, where he had been
summarising. Any word on his future? ''I have a meeting on Monday.''
Good luck, maestro.
In a glorious autumn sunset, the trees were green and gold. So were
the world champions.

I HAD occasion to listen to your chief sports writer James Traynor
while wearing his broadcasting hat on Wednesday evening and providing
comment on the previous evening's Coca-Cola Cup semi-final at Hampden
between Rangers and Aberdeen.
While enthusing about Eoin Jess, the eagle-eyed Traynor threw in the
gratuitous comment that the performance of the Aberdeen player was
stupendous, bearing in mind that in the course of the second half, the
Hampden pitch was cutting up and becoming waterlogged.
This comment is complete nonsense. An inspection of the pitch
immediately after the game showed that despite the amount of rain that
had fallen prior to, and during the match, it was in excellent
condition. Rain has fallen almost incessantly since Tuesday evening and
the pitch is still in tip-top shape.
At Queen's Park, one thing that can never be justifiably criticised is
the playing surface, which is undoubtedly the finest in the country and
has proved that it can withstand almost anything the Scottish weather
can throw at it.
Could I respectfully suggest that if Mr Traynor from his eerie in the
Hampden press box was genuinely of the opinion that the playing surface
was causing problems on Tuesday evening, he should seek the services of
a reliable optician.

THE current debate on whether boxing should be banned, or at least
modified, to make it safer for participants highlights the ''can of
worms'' opened up by the involvement of the police in sporting incidents
such as the Duncan Ferguson case.
How can it be right to jail a footballer for a head-butting incident
when it is not an offence to knock a boxing opponent senseless (or
worse)? It seems to me to be, at the very least, an inconsistency worthy
of further investigation.
Both are contact sports. It is against the rules to head-butt an
opponent at football but head-butting is also against the rules of
boxing yet nevertheless occurs regularly (sometimes not by accident,
either). It may be argued that to knock an opponent senseless is a key
element of boxing, but does that make it any less a crime?
I would suggest that unless consistent and fair guidelines can be
established and published on exactly what constitutes a criminal act in
relation to contact sports, without favour between one sport and
another, then the forces of law and order would be well advised to steer
clear and leave any retribution to the disciplinary bodies of the sport
itself.
In conclusion, can I advise those who justify the dangers of boxing on
the basis that it provides ''working-class kids'' with the opportunity
to make some money, that many people find such a defence deeply
objectionable. I would ask them to consider what they are implying. Is
it all right to damage someone's health if they were poor to start with
and they received a few pounds for the inconvenience? I thought that
type of thinking went out with the private mine owners!

AS ONE of the smaller nations in Europe, achieving sporting success
against the larger countries will always be a tall order.
Why, then, when our countrymen are so successful in what is arguably
the most expensive, demanding, and glamorous sport in the world, do the
popular press condemn them to a few meagre column inches?
The rest of the world envies our achievement in motor sport -- Colin
MacRae contending for outright victory in the World Rally Championship
next week, and David Coulthard demonstrating his abilities as a driver
in Formula One. Alan McNish, through sheer determination in F3000, will
undoubtedly progress and Dario Franchitti, from Whitburn, is the toast
of Europe after his outstanding races in the DTM and International
Touring Cars.
Let's give them recognition. The success of any Scot in any field
raises our international profile and can do nothing but good.

MANY eyes in racing were firmly fixed on the outcome of the Breeder's
Cup in America on Saturday. Prizes of $1m would be considered almost
chicken feed at Belmont Park in New York. But amid the rolling hills of
the Scottish Borders a much less hectic but just as enthralling day was
unfolding. However, prizes were measured in thousands rather than
millions.
Kelso Races is an experience. Punters from all over make their way
there for a day out at the cosy racecourse with its rickety old members'
stand. Everything seems stuck in a time warp.
Of course, National Hunt racing attracts all kinds of people and on
Saturday they converged on the douce Border town. Geordies in their
hundreds flocked in minibuses for a clash of culture with the local
county set. Shell suits went side by side with well worn tweeds and
waxed jackets; Burger King rubbed shoulders with smoked salmon
sandwiches; Jimmy Nail's Spender came face to face with Jane Austen's
Pride and Prejudice.
A glance down the list of stewards revealed a duke and a couple of
double-barrelleds. Even the clerk of the course is a Mr
Fenwicke-Clennell.
For a meeting at Kelso is like no other. It has a particular charm of
its own. The parade ring, the unsaddling enclosure, the bars and
restaurants, and even the bookies are all very close together and the
bubbly enthusiasm of the Newcastle crowd makes the atmosphere special.
And where else can you go to the races and find a huge comforting coal
fire in the stand and soup and sandwiches in constant supply?
For the toffs, there was an opportunity to gossip as well as assess
the chances of the many local trainers with runners in races sponsored
by, among others, a timber company, a local hotel, and a food firm.
There was talk of a summer tennis party and a look forward to a
forthcoming ball.
Junior toffs trailed behind their parents with lottery tickets in one
hand and plastic binoculars in the other. You can never start too early,
it seems.
In the cheap seats, one couple enjoyed a picnic, oblivious to events
around them, while a strange-looking group of men looked on.
At first it appeared they had taken a wrong turning on their way to a
Conan Doyle convention. But then it became clear that they were fans of
one of the world's other great mysteries: Channel 4 Racing's John
McCririck. Certainly they had stick-on sideburns, a couple of monocles,
the great coats, and the fore-and-aft hats usually sported by their
colourful hero.
Apparently one of their number wasn't able to find an appropriate
outfit for he came dressed, as a label around his neck proclaimed, as a
horse's arse. But his advice came from elsewhere.
''What's the point of getting good odds if the horse is a loser?
You're better getting bad odds on a winner,'' he told the McCriricks.
Certainly there was a deafening silence when 50-1 shot Celtic Silver
managed to win the second race at the meeting. ''How could a donkey like
that win?'' one disconsolate punter seemed to ask the gods. The only
people smiling were the bookies with their bulging bags.
The favourite in the race, Vavasir, is trained by one of the most
interesting newcomers to the Scottish racing scene. Lucinda Russell, 28,
has had a licence for only two months but already she has made a
considerable impact. The whisky broker's daughter, who trains in
Kinross, has notched up some notable victories. But although Vavasir has
already won twice, it wasn't to be her day.
But it did bring three wins for Irish jump jockey Tony Dobbin. His
surname suggests that a career in racing was inevitable, but he was
delighted with his successes on Wild Rose of York, Emerald Storm, and
Thistle Princess. Two of his wins were for local trainer Peter Monteith,
a popular figure at the Border course.
Meanwhile the Geordies were enjoying the racing from around the
country on screens in the unfortunately named Tatt's Bar. Newcastle
Brown Ale was very much the order of the day.
There were plenty of newcomers, too. One man asked his friend how many
laps the horses had to do in a particular race. ''You're not at an
athletics meeting,'' he was told. ''This is the sport of kings, not some
hop, skip, and a jump.''
For those bored with the racing there were stalls selling jackets and
thick socks -- very useful for the hunting, shooting, and fishing
contingent. Another had an array of racing books.
From Rags to Riches was one title. For many at the end of the meeting,
from Riches to Rags would have been more appropriate.

Live football is being shown all the time and there is little control
over it any longer
THE other week in Paris was just like old times for veteran
commentator Archie McPherson. A change of locale, of course, but still
the friendly taunts from Celtic fans as they strolled along the
boulevards followed the man who was for so long the voice of Scottish
football.
''They must have long memories,'' joked McPherson, as group after
group of supporters yelled their barbed greetings. ''I didn't honestly
think so many of them would remember me.''
They did remember, of course. It may be five years since McPherson
ended his quarter-of-a-century stint as BBC's main football commentator,
but his continuing spell with Radio Clyde and his major involvement with
Eurosport has made certain he remains in the public consciousness.
Now McPherson spends four days a week in Paris, where Eurosport
maintains its hi-tech headquarters. He flies there at the start of each
week and returns to catch up with the Scottish game every weekend.
And, while he may have stepped out of the parochial limelight,
McPherson's constituency now covers huge areas of the world.
He explains: ''Our programmes are sent all across Europe, right over
as far as the Urals, and many of them are sold on to the Middle East and
the Far East, and the United States, too.
''I get letters from Ethiopia and, at Hampden earlier this year, a
girl came up to ask for my autograph. She turned out to be the Player of
the Year in women's football in the States and she had followed our
World Cup coverage.
''I had had no idea, at the time, that the commentaries were being
sent across the Atlantic.''
More than 65 million homes now take Eurosport and the added audiences
for programmes sold across the world gives McPherson a massive audience
-- many, many millions more than he ever had with the BBC.
He left the Beeb after the World Cup finals in Italy. In all the
finals Scotland played in from l974 onwards McPherson's was the voice
which carried the news of the team back to an anxious nation.
From the unbeaten games in West Germany, to the fiasco of Argentina
and on through Spain, Mexico, and Italy, it was McPherson who chronicled
the country's adventures. Then he quit.
He says now: ''It was a wrench because I enjoyed my time with the BBC
and I believe strongly in public broadcasting. But I was working in
London as well as Scotland and I did not enjoy that. Being down there
for most of the week was not the most enjoyable time of my life. So I
decided after Italy it was time for a change and the Eurosport
opportunity came up and suddenly, instead of London, I was working and
living in Paris.
''That's something you dream about and here it is happening to me.
There is a style about this city, an elegance, and it's a joy to be
based here as the major English-speaking commentator.
''I work alongside several other broadcasters who operate in their own
languages -- French naturally, German, Dutch, Spanish, Swedish, and
Czech. But English remains the lingua franca and our research shows that
even in Germany, around Dusseldorf, in particular, the English language
commentary has a big audience.''
The most popular of McPherson's programmes -- away from live match
commentaries -- is the European goals' programme, which goes out on
Monday nights and features all the strikes from around the Continent.
''That takes something like six hours to put together,'' he reveals.
''You have to edit all the goals into the one programme and I have to
sit there in the booth linking them together. It is difficult but the
end result is a very, very successful show.''
McPherson works mainly from the Paris studios, but he does make forays
to cover live games, too. He was at the Parc des Princes for the Paris
St Germain-Celtic Cup-winners' Cup clash and, a couple of weeks earlier,
he was in Nantes for a Champions' League game.
''I did that match in Nantes live,'' he grins, ''and then went
straight into the studio to dub commentary to pictures coming in from
another country. It was a hectic night.''
McPherson fought his corner often with the late Sir Robert Kelly when
the Celtic chairman forecast that television would kill football as a
spectator sport. But now as the floodgates open, he has these fears
himself.
He explains: ''Back when Bob Kelly used to say that television would
kill the game, I argued against him. He had been to the United States
and seen empty baseball parks because of too much live television and he
thought the same would happen to soccer. But I think I have been proved
right, because football has been robust enough to keep its public. Now,
though, things are changing.
''Live football is being shown all the time and there is little
control over it any longer. The more television techniques improve --
and they are improving all the time -- then the harder it will become
for football or any sport to hold on to its massive live audience.
''I did not have these worries years ago, but I have them now and they
are very real concerns. Billions will watch the next World Cup on
television and I am sure that many of the stadia here in France will
still be full. But that is for the biggest event. Club football could
soon face a crisis, because people will watch at home and eventually
they will lose the habit of going to their local grounds, and that would
be a tragedy . . .''
Meanwhile, McPherson sends his Scottish-accented commentaries around
the world, building a new public for himself as the game he loves loses
the mass appeal it once had. It is an irony he recognises.

HE WAS there in spirit, if not presence. While the Brazilian miracle
worker, Juninho, who has fired the imagination on Teesside, was winging
his way to England along with his international clearance papers,
Middlesbrough's supporters were making their way to Manchester. All
their chatter was about their very own superstar and it made the
prospect of a first visit to Old Trafford in three seasons much less
ominous.
All along Sir Matt Busby Way vendors were earning their Christmas
money, selling T-shirts with the young South American's face smiling out
from them, and, for a few hours at least, they were bigger sellers than
the merchandise which helps immortalise another foreigner, Eric Cantona.
Shirts with his coupon on them bear such legends as ''I'm back,'' and
they tell of fishing fleets and seagulls. The French enigma would have
relished the chance to strut his stuff in competition to Juninho, but
even Cantona, the existentialist who has been imbued with superhuman
powers by the minds of Old Trafford's disciples, found it difficult to
deal with an absent force.
There were times during Saturday's Premiership match when Cantona
appeared to be wandering around the pitch looking for something, or
someone. He sensed a presence, but he could not quite track it down.
While searching for Juninho, Cantona would occasionally come into
contact with the ball and he would flick it or stab it into the path of
another red shirt. It was all so very easy. The imperious Cantona, even
when pre-occupied, continues to bestride the English game.
If anyone should have been able to understand the heady sense of
anticipation caused by Juninho's impending arrival it was Cantona,
because, while he was serving his long ban imposed as punishment for
having introduced a Crystal Palace fan to his studs, United and their
fans longed for the sight of him. In his absence, sometimes the team
could look ordinary. With him, United give the appearance of a team
looking down their noses at the rest.
However, Saturday was about two others who command their own places in
United's folklore. This meeting was as much about the master, Alex
Ferguson, and the pupil, Bryan Robson, who returned to Manchester for
the first time as a manager and one who had his team playing with enough
spirit on which to form a base for greater things.
In traditional, uncluttered fashion, Robson, who admits to speaking
with his Old Trafford mentor at least once a week, has built from the
back through the middle, and now he seeks to weave in the inspiration.
Nick Barmby, a diminutive, constantly mobile player who flits between
the front line and the space between the attack and midfield, was bought
in at a club record of #5.2m, and once Juninho -- #4.75m -- has settled
in, it is reasonable to assume Middlesbrough's scoring rate will become
as impressive as their defensive record.
However, the former Celtic player, Derek Whyte, again was unfit, and,
for the second time in succession, the 'Boro defensive system, which had
given up only four league goals, was altered, with Phil Whelan making
his debut. He looked cumbersome and, for the first time this season,
Middlesbrough conceded more than one goal in a league match.
The first in their 2-0 defeat was scored only three minutes before
half-time by Gary Pallister, who directed a looping header into the net
just under the bar, and Andy Cole, who has still to convince the Old
Trafford support that he is a top-class striker, took the second goal
near the end of the game. It was typical that the ball, which keeper
Gary Walsh almost smothered, seemed to slow down and think about
entering the net.
''It seemed to take three days to go in,'' said Ferguson afterwards,
''but it did, and that goal will help Andy. He deserved it because of
the work he puts in. Also, someone with his movement will score goals.''
Movement, in fact, is a large part of United's success and, even when
they were left short after Roy Keane was dismissed in 29 minutes, they
appeared unperturbed. Paul Scholes was kept indoors at the interval and
Brian McCair was sent on to play in the centre of midfield, a function
he performed remarkably well.
The Scot -- ''a man of genuine substance,'' according to Ferguson --
had a significant influence on the game, using his experience to great
effect and allowing Ryan Giggs to express himself. There are few more
impressive sights in the game than Giggs in full flight and the United
faithful rising slowly to their feet in increasing expectation.
It is such moments which make it easy to accept the boast, which from
a distance seems to be rather outlandish, that Old Trafford is the
Theatre of Dreams. It is a wonderful arena in which to watch the game,
and playing there must also be special.
''It is,'' said Viv Anderson, Middlesborugh's assistant manager. ''A
lot of our players had never played at Old Trafford and you can talk to
them as much as you want about what to expect, but until they have
experienced it for themselves they never really know.''
They do now, even with only 35,000 inside, because the three-tier
North Stand which stretches above the ground and almost into the clouds
is still being constructed, but by Christmas the capacity will rise to
40,000. When work has been completed Old Trafford will hold 55,000 --
and what will freshman footballers think then?
Middlesbrough themselves have a totally new ground, Riverside Stadium,
which attracted 8000 supporters on Saturday to watch the game in
Manchester on huge screens. Robson's people believe he will lead them to
great things, although much will depend on Barmby and Juninho, and
perhaps also the striker, Jan-Aage Fjortoft. It was he who was involved
in the incident which led to Keane's second dismissal this season and
his third this year, which suggests that Ferguson, who was unwilling to
elaborate on the matter, will have to deal with another
career-threatening suspect temperament.
United can't afford further disciplinary problems which will tarnish
their name and also undermine their challenge.
Fjortoft committed a foul on Keane, but it was nothing serious and
certainly didn't merit the United player's reaction. He got up and
appeared to swing a playground punch, leaving the referee with only one
option.
''I made a foul, that was all,'' Fjortoft said. ''People set their own
limits in terms of anger and I think he overdid his reaction a bit, but
he didn't hurt me.''
However, the Norwegian, who was booked for his part in the
confrontation, was hurt by the chants of ''cheat'' from United's fans.
''I think it was unfair of them to call me a cheat because I didn't do
anything.''
Neither Fjortoft nor any of his team-mates thought it fair when Jaimie
Moreno was fouled by Pallister inside United's box in the second half
but was denied a penalty. Still, they didn't make much of a fuss about
the one that got away and they left to regroup for the challenges ahead,
and also the arrival of Juninho.
''We will have to help him,'' said Fjortoft. ''He is slight, but he
has already handled the physical side of the game, so we won't really
have to behave like a lot of Mother Teresas towards him, although that
he doesn't know any English might be a problem for a while.''
Fjortoft then thought for a moment and corrected himself. ''Well,
maybe he does. He probably knows some words: pound, thank you, and
goodbye.''
And, as the vendors folded Juninho, Cantona, and Giggs away, and the
last of the fans, who had started arriving at 10am, disappeared into the
darkness, so ended another day at the Theatre of Dreams. There is simply
no other place like Old Trafford anywhere in Britain.

AS bitter sprint rivals during the late seventies and early eighties,
Drew McMaster and Allan Wells regularly exchanged Scottish 100 metres
titles. Yet they detested one other so intensely that neither could be
persuaded to swop a relay baton.
This presented problems for Frank Dick, first as Scottish national
coach, and later in the same role at the head of British athletics.
It restricted his options when arranging relay quartets, but it did
not prevent him putting out a Scottish team -- McMaster, Cameron Sharp,
Wells and David Jenkins -- which shattered the UK record to win
Commonwealth gold in the 1978 Edmonton games.
Now the old emnities have boiled over, with McMaster sacrificing his
own integrity, admitting to the use of illegal performance-enhancing
drugs before and after that Commonwealth triumph, in an attempt to
tarnish the career of Olympic champion Wells. Jenkins has already
confessed his use of the same drugs.
It smacks of paranoia, but financial problems after business
difficulties are the more probable reason for his despicable muck-raking
and setting up of former team-mates which have led to allegations
against an Edinburgh doctor, James Leddingham, and Dick.
It was Leddingham, claims the 38-year-old McMaster, who provided his
drugs, advised dosages, and told him how to avoid detection.
Prescribing steroids for an athlete would have contravened the
morality of the sport, but was not illegal.
When Jenkins admitted his steroid abuse, and was jailed in the USA for
trafficking in them, the Scottish Amateur Athletic Association decided,
wrongly in my view, not to expunge Jenkins' national 400 metres record.
It remains to this day.
Now the SAAA has gone, replaced by the Scottish Athletic Federation.
Their general committee will meet next week to discuss the implications
of McMaster's confession.
They have the opportunity to review the 4 x 100m record, and to
expunge it, and I believe they should do so. Failure to act will send
the wrong message: that you can set a record and carve a niche in
history dishonestly.
Worse, athletes' proximity to record performances is the yardstick for
selection to future Games.
On the basis that Jenkins' record was allowed to remain, honorary
secretary Bob Greenoak said last night that he doubted whether that
precedent would be altered. ''After all, that relay team would be tested
after they won gold, and everyone passed.''
Cameron Sharp, however, the youngest member of that quartet,
confirmed: ''We were never tested in Edmonton.'' On that basis alone,
the record should be deleted.
The next issue is the gold medal, about which SAF can do nothing. That
is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Games Federation, whose
council meets in Kuala Lumpur this week. Scotland took a lead in the
federation's adoption of tighter anti-doping legislation, and should do
so again.
Colin McEachran, the Edinburgh QC who is the Scottish council's
chairman will be in Kuala Lumpur, and I believe he should raise the
matter, even if it means the innocent Wells and Sharp being deprived of
their gold.
Dick says he plans to sue, and is confident of victory.
There is little point in either the Scottish or British federations
holding an inquiry into the allegations, for they have already had one.
In 1987, following newspaper articles, an independent inquiry was
established under the chairmanship of Peter Coni QC. He found the then
BAF promotions officer, Andy Norman, an unreliable witness, and
acknowledged that there had been drug abuse problems in British
athletics in the 70s and early 80s, the years McMaster and Jenkins were
active.
As a direct consequence of that report, lifetime bans and random
out-of-season testing was introduced. The bans have been reduced under
pressure from the world governing body. Last year, the BAF was able to
report that only 12 positive samples had been found from 2896 tests from
April 1991.
McMaster has confirmed that he was corrupt, and became so chasing his
dream. There was no serious money in the sport then. He did what he did
in the pursuit of glory, in the belief that some of who stood in his way
were also cheating.
Now that millions can hang on gold medals, only Draconian punishment
-- life bans, expunging of all tainted records, and forfeiture of medals
-- will send the correct message to those who would destroy sport for
their own gain.

THE Aberdeen and Kincardine area of the National Farmers' Union of
Scotland is to be congratulated for its initiative in holding a debate
on the issue of land tenure, posing the question of whether it is an
appropriate time for change.
Folk really did come from near and far to Pittodrie House Hotel, by
Inverurie. There were tenants from Midlothian and from from the Island
of Bute where the death of their former landlord -- the Marquis of Bute
-- has brought fears that a more demanding regime might be about to be
unleashed on the tenant farmers.
Tenants there are convinced that the estate will be seeking to move
away from granting leases with security of tenure to a system where
leases are for a fixed term.
Some who took part in the debate were quick to acknowledge that they
had good landlords who encouraged them to grow their businesses and were
apparently quite happy to see the tenancy pass down through the
generations. There were others who were cautious about any suggestion
that the law in Scotland should be changed to allow greater freedom of
contract, which would mean fixed-term leases.
Before the debate, members of the audience were given the opportunity
to indicate whether they believed there was a need for a change in
legislation, and 53% were in favour of change and 47% supported the
status quo. Three hours and many thousands of words later the same
question was put and there had been a 1% shift in favour of the status
quo.
That is not to say the exercise was without value. The arguments were
certainly well rehearsed. The legal position was outlined by Sir Crispin
Agnew QC, who specialises in agricultural law. The landlords were
represented by Robert Balfour, a member of the North East Region of the
Scottish Landowners Federation, who is a chartered surveyor and also has
a hand in managing 5000 acres of family land. The tenants case -- which
was broadly a plea for the status quo -- was put by Gordon Taylor,
president of the Banff area of the NFUS.
It was hardly a David and Goliath scenario. The Taylor family farms
about 1800 acres in Banffshire.
In most landlord-tenant arguments, rent levels would be expected to be
an issue but they were hardly mentioned. The sticking point was security
of tenure, with landlords seeing it as a disincentive to letting out
land and tenants arguing that they could hardly be expected to invest in
a business which could be snatched away from them at the end of a lease.
There was much talk of son following father -- and yet at other times we
hear of the unwillingness of the younger generation to stay on the land.
The NFUS official position is that they are against any dilution of
security of tenure. Short-term arrangements, they point out, can be made
through the use of limited partnerships where landlord and tenant
combine to form a partnership. The lease can be terminated by winding up
the partnership, which is regarded in Scotland as a legal entity in its
own right.
Sir Crispin was less sure about placing trust in limited partnerships.
Any device which was set up simply to evade security of tenure could be
regarded by the courts as a sham, he warned. If the court took the view
that an agreement was meant to deny a tenant the protection which
Parliament intended to provide it was entitled to look beyond the
agreement, he said.
He managed to keep a note of financial satisfaction out of his voice
as he confided that he was involved in litigation in four cases where
limited partnerships were being challenged. ''I know of many cases where
a secure tenant has been persuaded to enter into a limited partnership
with a landlord -- for reasons I have never entirely comprehended.''
In England, with the introduction of farm business tenancies it is no
longer competent to reach a agreement which gives security of tenure.
''I think you should be entitled to enter into a secure tenancy if you
want to,'' said Sir Crispin. If there was to be a change in Scotland
perhaps it should be to allow a contract covering the tenant and his
heirs until the end of the lease, he suggested. ''I wonder if we need
anything as complicated as the English have foisted on themselves.''
Robert Balfour emphasised that any change in legislation would not
affect existing secure tenants. The rental system was in decline, he
claimed, because landlords were not prepared to let out land if they
felt they were letting it away for the rest of their lives. Radical
reform, including the dropping of security of tenure, would encourage
landlords to release more land for rent. Fears of the imposition of
short-term lets were unfounded, he argued. ''It is in our interests to
find tenants who are willing to invest and make long-term commitments --
and that won't happen with short-term lets.''
Gordon Taylor in his rallying call to tenants warned that their future
livelihood was under threat. ''Now is the time to attend NFU meetings
and to write to your MPs arguing the case for security of tenure and the
right for tenants to buy their farms,'' he urged. ''They did it for
council house tenants, they did it for crofters, they can do it for
us.''
If financial reward is to be the measure of success, farmers might be
wise to encourage their sons to study law rather than agriculture. Sir
Crispin indicated there were rich pickings to be made out of disputes
between farmers. A friendly gesture allowing a neighbour to keep sheep
in a field could lead eventually to dispute over security of tenure, he
warned. ''That one makes me a fortune.'' Maybe he was joking, but nobody
laughed.

QUESTION: ''If it takes one man an hour to plough a five-acre field,
how long will it take 60 men to plough that field?'' Answer: ''One
minute.''
I don't suppose the children get that sort of puzzle at school these
days. It's all new maths now and it is just as well. Whatever new maths
is it is bound to be better than teaching them lies.
Merciful heavens. Anybody can see that it would take at least half an
hour to get 60 men and their tractors into the field in the first place.
And how would they turn at the end of each drill? There wouldn't be
enough room to get all going at once and even if you did you would end
up hours later with the field half ploughed, a tangle of expensively
crashed metal, and the 60 ploughmen at one another's throats.
Yet we used to sit there in the solemn days of school working those
problems out. ''If it takes a man and a half a day and a half to build a
chain and a half of wall how much wall will two and a half men build in
a week and a half?''
Did you ever hear such nonsense? Where are you going to get half a man
anyway? Doesn't it matter whether the extra man you take on is as good
as the original man? And won't the two men fall out over who bullies the
halflin? And will the halflin still be with you after a week and a half
of treatment like that?
We saw last week what happened when Pennywashers applied the principle
to baling the last field of wheat straw. Question: ''If a man working at
five miles an hour can bale a field in three hours how long will it take
him to bale a field at 15 miles an hour?''
Answer: ''He will cause the wheel-bearing to seize and set fire to the
field. It will be two weeks before he can finish the field.''
Amazingly, despite all my years of seeing through the principle, I
have been caught in the same trap. It was on the advice of Mossie. He
who coined the phrase ''More acres less profit'' persuaded me to alter
my crop-sprayer so that it would spray 60ft at a time instead of 40.
Question: ''If a 40ft sprayer takes two hours to spray 30 acres, how
long will it take a 60ft sprayer?''
Answer: ''Disaster.''
I know you get good sprayers designed to cover 60ft at a time or even
more. They work well I have no doubt. But what I have done is to take a
thing designed to spray 40 and added 50% to each wing. Instead of each
arm having one joint for folding up for transporting, we have a new
section 10ft long and an extra joint.
The first problem is that it is so heavy. Unlike the automatic
ram-operated affairs Mossie and the Red Rooster work, my sprayer, a
snatch at #1500, has to be made ready for transportation manually. I
didn't like doing it when it had 40ft booms but at 60 it is really
heavy.
But it is when you are all set to go that the extra weight really
makes itself felt.
Have you ever seen a partan half way between the sea and crab salad?
Without the sea to support it, the poor animal's body is far too heavy
for its legs. The spindly shanks just collapse.
So it was with my sprayer this week.
Mind you, I was proud of its sheer scale after I had got the great
wings spread. At 60ft a time I would soon be finished and away down to
the Salmon Inn to tell them that I too had a big sprayer.
But the great bird did not fly. I was maybe a bit rough with the
clutch but when I set off my right wing was left behind and crumpled. I
banged on the brakes. The left wing kept going and crumpled forward. I
was left there sitting in the wreckage of a partan out of water.
There was nothing broken. It was just that there wasn't enough
strength in the sprayer to keep it in shape. I got the back wing forward
and the forward wing back and set ever so gingerly off again. This time
I got about 200 yards before disaster struck again.
My fields are so hilly that at 60ft there is always one wing or the
other almost touching part of the ground if you try to operate it two
feet above the crop. At the merest brush of the ground she crumpled
again. That was fairly easily sorted. My new sprayer has to be set five
feet above the crop which will be alright in a windless day.
The next hazard was a steep knapp. When I went uphill the giant partan
collapsed backward. I got her going again only for her to collapse
forward when we went down the other side.
If it takes a man with 40ft booms two hours to spray 30 acres it takes
a man with 60ft booms a whole day. At the end of that he is feeling
extremely glad that he only has three years to go to retirement.
Several days and three trips to the smiddy later I have the thing
stabilised a bit.
I now have lugs on the elbows and wrists of the great wings, and bolts
through them to stop them breaking. Then I have stays that run from the
booms to the chassis to stop it collapsing on the braes.
It is not ideal.
All that extra metal weighs, for one thing. And the wings of the
sprayer are supposed to bend when you hit anything to save damaging the
machine. The next time I hit a telephone pole it is going to be either
the sprayer or the pole.

<HEADLINE>Bad advice on OP dips blamed for scab rise</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975634562</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
IGNORANCE and bad advice have been blamed for the continued spread of
sheep scab in Britain following its elimination in 1952.
The media and the Health and Safety Executive have been selected for
special criticism by a leading veterinary surgeon for their parts in
blocking effective control of the complaint, which affects a million
sheep a year.
Speaking at a British Veterinary Association seminar in London, Chris
Lewis, a former president of the BVA's sheep veterinary society, and a
practising vet in Cheshire, said that despite the broad range of
treatments available scab had reached epidemic proportions.
''I believe the answer lies partially in the nature of the disease,
its perception among farmers, and an almost universal misconception on
the best way to treat and prevent it.
''Add to this some well publicised, ill-founded, ill-informed and
misleading press comment and it is little wonder the industry is riddled
by scab. Unless attitudes change drastically, the situation will at best
remain static and at worst deteriorate further.''
Dipping techniques and equipment and injection techniques used by
farmers left a lot to be desired. But it was not all the farmers' fault.
Labelling requirements were excessive and difficult to read, he said.
He then went on to lambast the Health and Safety Executive for causing
''misinformation and ill-informed comment'' on the leading treatment by
organophosphorous dips.
''I believe that the HSE are in no little way directly responsible for
the continued high incidence of scab in the national flock. They took it
upon themselves, without any shred of scientific evidence, to tell
farmers considering fly control in the summer period not to use OP dips
since under COSHH regulations they possessed greater hazards.''
The attendant publicity was accepted by farmers at face value and many
believed it was illegal to use OP compounds as summer dips.
''Lurid press reporting, non-scientific articles in the tabloids and
farming press have resulted in an unwarranted fear of these compounds.''
He pointed out that OP compounds had been used for more than 25 years
in a variety of domestic situations and even by fishermen in the north
who sprayed their skin with OP-containing compounds to keep midges at
bay while fishing.
''Too frequently they have not been handled correctly and people have
exposed themselves unnecessarily, but please do not ban the OPs on
quasi-scientific grounds,'' he said, adding that other treatments were
also available.
He urged British sheep farmers to adopt techniques used by farmers in
New South Wales in Australia where peer pressure and penalties are
brought to bear on producers who do not treat their stock.
* The Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh has been awarded
#500,000 for research into the possible long-term human health effects
of OP sheep dips.

ROWING
* THE Clydesdale Scullers' Head of the River Race went ahead on
Saturday and was won, as expected, by the current world lightweight
champion Peter Haining of Loch Lomond.
The race was switched to Strathclyde Park from Glasgow Green because
the torrential rain of the previous week had made the River Clyde too
fast and unsafe for racing.
Haining's time of 13min 08sec left second placed Kevin Plank of
Stirling, himself an international standard performer, well in his wake,
more than 30 seconds adrift. Third place overall was taken by
Clydesdale's Joe Kelly, who also took the Restricted 1 pennant. His
clubmate Mark Hely, who won the Restricted 2 event, was in fourth place
overall.
In the various veteran age group categories, both Willie Brown of
Stirling and George Parsonage of Clydesdale, who holds the course
record, were winners, while Nicki Fitpatrick of Clydesdale just beat
Cathie Mordaunt of Inverness as the fastest woman.
To keep it in the family, Peter Haining's new wife Rachel won the
women's Restricted pennant.

WHAT would really happen to food prices and farm incomes if the CAP
was thrown away? Earlier this year Mr Jonathan Aitken, then Chief
Secretary to the Treasury, claimed to know at least part of the answer.
He declared that the CAP was costing UK consumers #28 a week for a
family of four.
This was so absurd that Mr Waldegrave, then Minister of Agriculture,
was moved to publish a document that rubbished his colleague's claim. It
so happened that he had just set up a ministerial think-tank to look
into CAP and the consequences of removing agricultural support. A few
months later Mr Waldegrave left the Agriculture Ministry and took up
another post -- Mr Aitken's.
The farm policy review group published its findings in the summer
European Agriculture: The Case for Radical Reform. M.A.F.F. The message
was clear enough. Traditional arguments for any form of farm support are
no longer valid. A free market will produce the best results.
A little public money might go to areas where abandoning the land
would have serious social consequences or to farmers for providing
''environmental benefits.'' Apart from that, farmers and farm workers
should look to a future where farm prices are determined by world market
forces and nothing else.
The transition might take some time but a completely free market must
be the objective.
The review group, to its credit, made bold forecasts of what this was
likely to mean for farmers, farmworkers, and the sectors supplying
agriculture and processing and distributing food.
Assuming that CAP disappeared under a multilateral trading
arrangement, world market prices for several farm products would rise
substantially. Even so, producers' returns from cereals and most
livestock products would be cut by 30-50% since they would lose the
direct subsidies which are not part of their present market returns.
The estimated loss to the UK agricultural sector would be #5600m
compared with the present total income from farming (farmers' and
farmworkers') of #4000m.
It is then suggested that because of the lower use and prices of
inputs the actual net loss would be between #2000m and #3000m, reducing
agricultural incomes to between one-quarter and one-half of their
present level. Adjustments to farm production might reduce that effect.
The group estimates that wage rates would fall by 5%, land values
would be nearly halved, and other asset values would also fall sharply.
Astonishingly, the think-tank forecasts that the rate of decline of
the agricultural labour force would not be much faster than in recent
years. About five-sixths of the present agricultural population would be
content to share less than one-half of the present total income from
farming.
At every stage of the analysis every negative consequence of the
policy is minimised and not one possible advantage is granted for any
form of market intervention, however modest or financed. Even
stabilisation measures are dismissed as unnecessary. World market forces
will prevent prices from fluctuating too much and even if they do not a
''wide range of options is open to farmers to protect their businesses
against uncertain returns''. Farming derivatives perhaps.
The huge increase in agricultural productivity in Europe in recent
years is all attributed to research findings -- a denial that their
application on the farm is to any important extent dependent on labour
skills or willingness to invest.
What about the consumers and the #60bn a year we spend on food to eat
inside or outside the home? Where are the great savings we have been
promised when the CAP is finally thrown away? You have to look hard for
any mention of the consumer. There no attempt to estimate the possible
size of any effect on retail food prices.
If they had made such an attempt they would have found that, with
world food prices rising, farm-gate prices falling steadily as a
proportion of retail prices, and several foods unaffected by CAP, its
gradual removal would hardly be noticed at the shop level or take-aways.
The main reduction would not be in food prices but in public
expenditure and we may soon hear how much could come off the base or top
rates of tax if we reduced farming incomes to a quarter of their present
level.
The farm think-tank has done agriculture a disservice by trying to
promote extreme free market policies at the expense of other
alternatives to present policies. As a result the industry is not likely
to take its findings seriously and will be less prepared for the changes
which are likely to come -- especially if and when the EU is enlarged.
As the importance of real world forces grows so the relevance of a CAP
of quotas, of set-aside, and all the rest will disappear without trace.
By then let us hope we have found ways of adapting world food production
to meet increasing world needs.

Glasgow University.

BOWLS:
HOPES of a confidence-boosting Scottish victory in this week's Hong
Kong classic singles disappeared at Craigengower Cricket Club yesterday
when Alex Marshall bowed out at the quarter-final stage.
The Gorgie Mills man was left regretting the one that got away after
having gone down 25-24 to England's John Ottaway.
Marshall, trailing 14-5 after 11 ends, grasped a lifeline on the
twelfth when he scored 3 to close to 14-8. From there, he went on to
lead 17-15 and 21-17 before Ottaway picked up doubles to square at
21-21.
On the next end, the Scot missed a great chance to close out the
match. Lying three, he had five feet to add to a match-winning fourth
with his last, but missed and Ottaway hit back with a 3 on the next end
followed by a single for victory.
Scotland's other hope, Kirkliston's Kenny Logan, lost out on Saturday
when he went down 25-19 to Simon Chan from the Royal Hong Kong Police
Club.
Ireland's Noel Graham took the title when he beat South Africa's
Commonwealth gold medallist Neil Burkett 25-24 in the final.
Graham, who had beaten Ottaway 25-20 in the semis, saw a 21-11 lead
disappear as Burkett recovered to square at 24-24, but a single on the
thirty-second end gave Graham the title. Results:
Quarter-finals -- N Burkett (South Africa) 25, N Kennedy (Hong Kong)
11; D Piketh (South Africa) 25, P Rowlands (Wales) 16; N Graham
(Ireland) 25, J Smyth (Ireland) 17; J Ottaway (England) 25, A Marshall
(Scotland) 24.
Semi-finals -- Burkett 25, Piketh 23; Graham 25, Ottaway 20.
Final -- Graham 25, Burkett 24.

Dundee High FP 16, Currie 22
HAD Currie's coach Bruce MacNaughton been aware of the other second
division results when he was interviewed shortly after the game, then he
might not have been so cagey.
He refused to be drawn on the likelihood of promotion, and even
winning the league, stating simply that ''if we beat West next week,
then we'll feel comfortable about going up.''
While his side had been collecting two difficult points from Dundee,
two other challengers -- Jed and West -- were losing to teams at the
foot of the table.
MacNaughton was delighted with his side's performance. Currie's game
plan effectively closed down Dundee's fluid style, and although Currie
were willing and able to move the ball, Ally Donaldson was wise enough
not to put his side under pressure by taking chances.
Dundee, for the second successive week, lost a game that was there for
the taking. Had Chris Robinson slotted a straightforward penalty just
before the hour, he would have put Dundee 19-9 ahead. Maybe then
Currie's patience would have been tested.
Instead, following the miss, Donaldson struck a huge kick to the
Dundee end, forcing the home side also to drop out. Currie gained a
penalty which Donald goaled, Robinson fluffed his restart kick and from
the centre field scrum, Dean Sheppard scored a well-taken if somewhat
fortunate try. Breaking blind side from the scrum, he chipped delicately
into space but could not have expected the ball to bounce wickedly away
from the Dundee cover and into his hands.
Donaldson's conversion and a subsequent drop goal gave the Edinburgh
side a six point cushion and the wily stand-off then closed down the
game, denying Dundee a chance to hit back.
The lively Derek Milne notched Dundee's try from a back row ploy at a
five-metre scrum. Arran Whitney hit a 45-metre penalty and Chris
Robinson the conversion and two penalties -- but the one he'll remember
is the one which slipped past a post.

THE Private Finance Initiative is not a theoretical exercise for Ian
Dickson, senior corporate partner of MacRoberts, the Glasgow- based
solicitors.
Ian Dickson is at present deeply involved in tendering for three major
projects in Scotland -- a sewage treatment plant in Inverness and Fort
William, the Highland and Islands airport at Inverness, and an extension
to the M74.
''We have a team of four partners dealing with PFI,'' explained Ian
Dickson, ''and we believe we are leading this field in Scotland.''
The company, which had its original roots in Paisley before moving to
Glasgow in the mid eighties, has been involved in a host of takeovers,
and Ian Dickson has personally been involved in more than 200 deals.
Dickson takes satisfaction that a substantial number of these have
involved Scottish based companies acquiring companies in the south.
He recalls that when he first became involved in the corporate legal
scene the trend was for Scottish companies to be absorbed by English
companies, and cited as examples two major whisky companies, Wm Teachers
&amp; Sons being taken over by Allied Distillers and Glenlivet by Seagrams.
''A whole flood of companies,'' said Ian Dickson, ''went out of
Scottish control,'' said Ian Dickson,'' but the trend has been reversed
in recent years.''
To back this statement up he points to the work his company has done
for Johnston Press plc, the local newspaper group which has expanded
from its Falkirk base to purchase titles throughout England including
the Halifax Courier (Holdings) Ltd.
''Seventy per cent of Johnston's titles are now in England,'' he said.
It is not surprising the Ian Dickson describes himself as a ''man of
business'' who assists companies in buying and selling from a Scottish
base.
MacRoberts at present employs 145 people including 20 partners, and
sees this number expanding.
Ian himself who enjoys hillwalking in the Arran hills and listening to
jazz music, including the voice of Scots singer Carol Kydd, said his
firm's expertise in construction, employment legislation, and PFI
matters would help in this expansion.
Already MacRoberts is among the top six legal firms in Scotland and
with customers such as Railtrack(Scotland) and Scottish Nuclear he is
looking to strengthen this position.

Stewart's-Melville 20,
Jed-Forest 12
JED-FOREST coach Donald Millar was a perplexed man after he watched
his team crash to a lively Stewart's-Melville side at Inverleith. ''I
can't come to terms with how we can play so well one week and so poorly
the next. It's totally beyond me,'' he mused.
Stewart's-Melville, currently propping up the second division, had
recorded only their third league victory, successfully reversing the
result of their earlier meeting with Jed when the Borderers had handed
out a 43-0 drubbing. But this was no fluke result. Colleges deserved
their victory.
Gary Armstrong was returned to the fray after his most recent injury
and played his usual stormer, although perhaps at times overdoing his
ninth forward role.
His initial promptings had helped put Jed into a threatening position
from which, when Stewart's-Melville transgressed, Chris Richards kicked
his first penalty goal.
Colleges' willingness to spread the ball wide soon brought its reward
when Niall Gallagher pounced on a chip ahead by fellow centre Julian
Scott to score the first of three tries by his side in the space of 10
minutes. Full back Graham Stirling's place kicking was wayward but he
carved through the Jed cover for a fine try.
Jed were stung into response but just as they had worked their way
dangerously close to the enemy line, Colleges snapped up a loose ball,
returning play to the other end. From the ensuing scrum, Graham Burns
flipped a pass up to Mark Tweedie who went over for the third try,
converted by Stirling.
For the next 60 minutes the home side could not add to their tally,
but the long haul back for Jed was to prove too great, although Richards
added three penalties to bring them within one score.
With two minutes to go, Jed-Forest looked like they might just make it
as Steve Turnbull was released in the clear, but a thumping tackle ended
their hopes, and in the second minute of injury time, Stirling capped
Colleges' victory with a penalty.
Stewart's-Meville -- J Stirling; A Huett, N Gallagher, J Scott, M
Tweedie; F Pollock, G Burns; R McNulty, A Cadzow, J Conlin, M Paton, W
Faulds, E Thomson, N Penny, D Clark.

WORLDWIDE:
CROATIA'S national coach, Miroslav Blasevic, was arrested in
Switzerland last week as fresh allegations of corruption rocked French
football.
The new claims of bribery and match-rigging were made at a court in
Valenciennes, where Olympique Marseille's disgraced owner Bernard Tapie
is appealing against a one-year jail sentence.
Tapie, central figure in bribing a Valenciennes player to ease
Marseille's path to the French championship, was in a tears as he heard
his former aide, Jean-Pierre Bernes, admit further crimes.
Bernes, general manager at Marseille during Tapie's tainted regime,
said Blasevic accepted #50,000 when he was at Nantes to ensure victory
over Bordeaux. At that time in 1990, Bordeaux were the main threat to
Marseille in the championship.
Bernes also stated that Blasevic was the go-between in fixing other
games and money was deposited for him in a Swiss bank.
It was in Geneva last Tuesday that Blasevic was seized by police and
will appear in court on Thursday to answer the charges.
* OPTIMISM surrounds the latest attempt to establish football in the
USA, with Alan Rothenburg, chief executive of Major League Soccer,
announcing that it will get under way next April.
So far, 53 players out of the 180 required have been contracted. Among
them are US player of the year Alexei Lalas, -- currently playing in
Italy's Serie A with Padova -- goalkeepers Tony Meola and Mexico's Jorge
Campos and striker Hugo Sanchez.
Clubs such as LA Galaxy, Colorado Rapids, and New Jersey Metro Stars
will be allocated their quota of players on a draft basis.
* JOHAN Cruyff is considering an offer to remain with Barcelona for
life. His son Jordi has already agreed a four-year extension to his
contract which indicates Cruyff will accept.
The success of his youth programme, similar to the one he founded at
Ajax, is now being seen, with five teenagers appearing regularly in the
the first team.
The weekend defeat at Campostela, which cost Barcelona their
league-leading position, and the fine and six-match suspension imposed
on Cruyff for swearing at a referee, were dismissed yesterday as
temporary setbacks by president Luis Nunez.
''He is still the best coach in the world,'' Nunez insisted. ''I want
him to stay here as long as he wants, then further success will be
guaranteed.''
* DIEGO Armando Maradona attracted a crowd of more than 4000 to watch
him train last week. Nothing surprising in that, except that the player
in question was just nine years old. He is the son the Argentinian
superstar has never seen. But all that may change if Diego Jr's career
continues its meteoric rise.
Stefano Serra, a scout with Napoli, said: ''Not only does he look like
his father, he plays like him. Already he knows every trick in the game.
It is clear football is in his blood.''

West of Scotland 9, GHK 10
THIS local derby had been billed in some quarters as the match of the
day. God help us if that is how it turned out to be and the
entertainment on offer elsewhere was as bad or worse.
What promised to be a clash of two emerging rugby sides, with young
talent in large measure, turned instead into a disjointed affair with
little to offer either the local supporter or casual visitor.
And lest there should be any lasting doubt among the West ladies who
sit in front of the press box, this correspondent is totally neutral.
Instead, all support is aimed at the game of rugby football and there
was little to cheer on a perfect afternoon for its execution at
Burnbrae.
To be blunt, it would be better if both teams remained in the second
division. To climb any higher to the Tennent's Premiership for the
foreseeable future would be only temporary advancement.
Another neutral asked if there was a difference between the first and
second divisions. Oh, yes. And this kind of naivety and failure to
execute basic moves would be cruelly punished in the top flight.
Having said all that, there was a degree of excitement in the closing
stages as two poor teams battled for supremacy and much needed points.
But there is sometimes confusion between excitement and quality in
this game of ours and the flashes of the former were outweighed by the
sad absence of the latter.
GHK had travelled up the road determined to avenge the defeat by West
of Scotland in the first half of the league programme.
That they did was due to stout defensive work against opponents who
signally failed to turn possession into points, particularly in the
first half.
The young West lock pairing of Scott McKechnie and Guy Perrett had the
upper hand in the lineout battle with the colonial giants Andy Pope and
Cecil du Plessis.
The GHK faithful must hope that the big South African polis is
suffering from a touch of jet lag after his return and that his work
rate will pick up for the vital four games to come.
West have relied much in recent successes on their back row but they
met their match in a GHK trio which included the two ends of the club
spectrum in newcomer Ian Sinclair and veteran Walter Malcolm flanking
the influential Murray Wallace.
The wily Fraser Stott pipped Alan Kerr in the battle of the scrum
halves but David Barrett had one of those days where he drifted too far
and too slowly to allow his willing midfield to have a tilt at the
opposition without facing overwhelming odds.
And, once again, his boot, as was that of opposite number John McLeod,
was used in aimless punting which offered neither defensive nor
attacking options.
The whistle seemed to blow endlessly but let us be fair to the referee
and instead ask players to try to stay on their feet and not guddle
about on the ground leaving the official no option.
It was one such guddle from the GHK pack which led to the opening
penalty goal from Alan Williamson.
West appeared to have the upper hand, but a series of dunts by the GHK
forwards led to good possession and quick ball transfer through McLeod,
Bassi, Sanderson, and Hawkes before George Breckenridge appeared to
cross in the corner for a try which Bassi converted.
Williamson narrowed the gap to a single point with his second penalty
goal.
The second half was a similar harum-scarum affair but GHK pressure
gave Breckenridge a chance to stretch the lead with a penalty goal.
Barrett matched that, and again there was a single point in it and all
to play for.
West attacked, GHK defended, and vice versa, but in the end that point
was to be enough to send the visitors back to Anniesland happy but with
much to ponder as the final games approach.

Kelso 30, Selkirk 11
KELSO'S impressive rise up the second-division table continued with
this emphatic victory at Poynder Park, their fourth win in a row.
Stuck at the bottom of the league just a few weeks ago, the
Tweedsiders could well be challengers for promotion if they maintain
their current form. But while Selkirk's forwards' coach Mick Craig
praised Kelso as a much improved team from when the clubs met last
month, he was disappointed that the visitors contributed so much to
their own problems.
''We had enough possession at the scrum and lineout to win the game,''
he said, ''but we made basic errors. We gifted three scores from
mistakes, although Kelso took their chances well.''
Kelso led by a Graeme Aitchison penalty before they scored the opening
try in 27 minutes. Selkirk, initially put under pressure when Scott
Tomlinson missed touch with a penalty, were caught unawares by a quick
throw-in from Steven Ross. Ben Mannion set up a ruck in the 22, and from
Iain Fairley's pass, Stewart Bennet sent in Adam Roxburgh for the try.
Jeremy Brett and Aitchison swopped penalties before half-time, and
Aitchison added the conversion when an excellent drive by the pack
resulted in a score for Bennet.
Brett landed a penalty in 51 minutes, but seven minutes later
Tomlinson attempted to run out of defence following an awkward
up-and-under by Scott Tait only to pass straight to Jim Thomson. The
Kelso left winger promptly gave Roxburgh a clear run to the corner, and
Aitchison converted from the touchline.
Scott Nichol, having looped Brett, floated out a superb pass for
Darren Hulme to touch down in 76 minutes, but right at the end Mannion
made yet another fine tackle deep in Selkirk territory, enabling Ross to
escape for a try.
While Kelso are on the way up, Selkirk need to arrest their descent

AT Dundee Football Club they remember the last time their elusive
chairman Ron Dixon was seen in the city.
The visit from his native Vancouver was to observe the innovation of
greyhound racing at Dens Park in association with Dundee Leisure, his
other local business interest. The next morning he was driven to
Edinburgh airport for his flight home. That was a year ago this week.
Since then the official line is that Mr Dixon has gone off the radar.
It is not that nobody at the club bothered to get in touch with him last
Wednesday night to pass on the news that Dundee had beaten Airdrie to
reach the Coca Cola Cup Final against Aberdeen on November 26. More a
case that they have given up trying to get through to him.
If they were using the mobile phone number as we obtained last week,
they would get the same British Columbia Termobility recorded
announcement: ''The cellular customer you have dialed is away from the
phone or temporarily out of the service area. Please try again.''
Everyone gives up eventually.
''He gave me six phone numbers the day I drove him through to
Edinburgh airport, and they are all discontinued,'' says Dundee FC
managing director, Mr Nigel Squire. ''So, if he's not wanting to get in
touch with me, there's no way I can get in touch with him. There's no
point in me trying to phone him if all his numbers are switched off.''
One of the last successful contacts by phone was in February this year
when members of the board discussed with Mr Dixon an offer of #500,000
from Blackburn Rovers for player Jim Hamilton. Mr Dixon is said to have
given the board a free hand in the decision over whether or not to sell.
The Blackburn offer was eventually turned down.
In another phone call Mr Dixon stated an intention to return to Dundee
in mid-May. This never materialised. That was the last anyone heard from
him.
Since then all lines of communication have gone dead, and the only
reports of the chirman have been through hearsay rumoured sightings.
''We hear different stories,'' says Mr Squire. ''There was a guy through
in Dundee from Edinburgh a couple of weeks ago who said his brother saw
him regularly in Vancouver. Somebody else claimed to have seen him in
Tasmania. You know, he's like Elvis. People claim to spot him every
place. Somebody else said they spotted him in Venezuela. Who knows.''
There is no firm expectation at the club that Mr Dixon will make
contact to announce his intention to attend the cup final next month.
''He might never come back,'' is the startling suggestion from Dundee FC
vice-chairman Malcolm Reid.
Numerous theories attempt to explain Mr Dixon going incommunicado.
Some dismiss Dundee FC as a very small priority interest in his alleged
international business empire, a multi-millionaire's whim that was
relegated when his high publicity plans for a #5.5m combined football,
ice rink, and conference centre failed to get off the ground. Others
speculate that he is keeping a close scrutiny on affairs from a distance
through unidentified sources, while a series of separate writs over
previous deals and disputed fees from leading Scottish law firms remain
pending.
Two solicitors who have acted in this country for the Canadian
entrepreneur, Mr Tony Caplan at Levy and McRae in Glasgow and Ms Pamela
Loudon at Macbeth Currie in Edinburgh, declined to comment on Mr Dixon's
legal affairs last week. Asked if there might be a difference between
being uncontactable, and not wishing to be contacted, Mr Caplan replied:
''Correct. Correct.''
He added: ''There are pending issues, yes. Beyond that I wouldn't like
to say very much. But you don't make investments at the level that Mr
Dixon's made and just lose interest.''
The mystery is not merely over a chairman who may be completely
unaware that his football club have reached a major cup final, but also
over an absentee creditor who has almost #2m tied up as an interest-free
loan, without a fixed repayment date, in the latest Dundee FC accounts.
The balance sheet to May 31, 1994, shows that from that date Dens Park
Stadium was signed over as standard security, in the form of a bond and
floating charge, to Continental Commercial Systems Corporation. A note
identifies the company as ''registered in Canada'' and gives Mr Dixon as
its appointed nominee. The latest figures follow the settlement by Mr
Dixon's company of a bank loan to Dundee FC of almost #500,000 three
weeks before.
''We are in an absolutely super position,'' says Mr Reid, a business
partner of Mr Dixon in Dundee Leisure who was among his board
appointments following his taking control of the club in 1992. Mr Reid
estimates the cup final appearance will bring Dundee FC a conservative
#250,000 to ease ''financial restraints'' of recent seasons.
He maintains that the absence of Mr Dixon gets more attention than it
merits. ''No doubt today Ron's sitting looking at the news saying, 'Oh,
they're through to the final. Smashing!' But then he'll be away to work
on shiploads of mahogany from Venezuela, or aggregates from his mines in
Romania, or Czechoslovakia, or his bank in Moscow. I know a few of the
guys who work for him in Russia. They're the same. They see him twice in
a month and then they don't see him for another six months. It's just
his worldly business that keeps him a very busy person.''
Mr Reid was with Mr Dixon the day in 1991 when he got the impulse to
add Dundee FC to his takeover of Dundee Angus Ice Rink and the eventual
disposal of the Kingsway rink to the William Low supermarket chain in a
#1.9m deal, leaving the Tayside Tigers (formerly Dundee Rockets) ice
hockey team without a home.
The story is remarkable. ''We came out of a radio interview at Radio
Tay,'' recalls Mr Reid. ''The driver turned left and we went past Dens
Park. Ron Dixon asked what it was. I said it was Dundee FC, an ailing
club but once a tremendous force in Europe, and I pointed to the then
chairman Angus Cook with his white Rolls-Royce. I told him he was the
owner. Ron Dixon's words were 'Go and ask him if he'll sell it?'
''This puts it all in context when people ask why he's not worked up
about the club. He's not worried about it at all. It's just a small
thing to Ron. He's not careless, he's been very clever. He has a lot of
valuable assets here in players that manager Jim Duffy has nursed
along.''
The club claims to have rejected seven bids for seven separate players
in recent seasons, but the potential precariousness of the position with
Mr Dixon as a creditor who could call in his loan at any time is
rejected. ''Why would he want to pull the plug?'' asks Mr Squire. ''If
he was wanting his money back he would have told Jim Duffy to sell Jim
Hamilton to Blackburn. He would have been on the phone by now to tell
Duffy to sell Neil McCann, Paul Tosh, and Michel Pageaud. He seems quite
happy to let that money lie, let us run the club, and let the young
players develop.
''Ron's got #2m on the balance sheet. It's a personal loan, so I
suppose you could argue we were #2m in debt, but we're in debt to the
man who owns the thing. If a man owns the club, I wouldn't regard that
as a debt.''
One man who believes it is not a debt is former club chairman Angus
Cook, who sold out in 1991 to solicitor Andrew Drummond. Mr Drummond was
later struck off by the Law Society of Scotland for professional
misconduct and fined #1500 at Dundee Sheriff Court last month for
illegal share dealing in Dundee FC. It was Mr Drummond who sold the club
on to Mr Dixon. Mr Cook had previously rejected a deal for the club
directly from Mr Dixon.
''I believe Mr Dixon is not far away from what's happening at Dens
Park,'' says Mr Cook. ''I believe he's in communication with someone. He
has a bond and floating charge on the stadium and if anything goes wrong
with the football club, financially, his company will have control of
the stadium. Whatever he's trying to do, he doesn't have to be here to
achieve it.
''Why should a public limited company like Dundee Football Club be at
the mercy and whims of an absentee landlord? That's the point. If he
wanted Dundee Football Club to repay his loan, in my view they would
have a problem. If they couldn't pay he could put in a receiver and call
up the security.
''That would mean the club would be ravaged, with no stadium to play
in. They would be left with membership of the Scottish Football League,
no stadium to play in and a load of liabilities, players' contracts and
wages to meet. The fundamental question has always got to be if Mr Dixon
is so relaxed on this loan, why has it got to be secured?''
The absence fuels the speculation. Mr Dixon has survived at least one
smear campaign in Dundee in 1992 when he denied Vancouver mafia
connections in a newspaper interview. ''I have never done anything
illegal,'' he said. ''I have probably cut a few corners here and there.
I probably left some blood on the table when I was younger.''
Mr Squire offers the last word: ''The board and the players are still
respectful of the man because he's had the decency to leave his money
within the club. If I went to Canada and bought an ice hockey team and
it didn't work out for whatever reasons the way I wanted it to work out,
I'd close the thing down and take all my money back.
''Dixon has left his money there and he's given the local board and
the manager the beauty of no overdrafts and no interest charges to worry
about. It would have been nice if he'd left us with a wee nest egg for a
rainy day because it gets tight at times. But hopefully this cup success
will give us that.''

Edinburgh Academicals 13, Stirling County 16
IT WAS eminently missable at fully 45 metres out and a genuine
pressure penalty at 13-13, as almost certainly the last act of a Raeburn
Place contest that came aflame only in the last quarter. Mark McKenzie,
however, put the finishing flourish to his own splendid performance by
whacking it dead centre, his second penalty success, as compensation for
early misses and to revive Stirling County's championship challenge
while consigning the gallant Edinburgh Academicals to the task of
survival.
The youthful Academicals had reason to feel miffed. They had
threatened a shock outcome by battling back from 13-6 down to parity
with the try of the match. They mounted a series of threats culminating
in Mike Duncan, who had stroked over two penalty goals and a conversion,
pushing fractionally wide a penalty for the lead, whereupon a ground
offence provided McKenzie with his moment of glory.
Whereas the mature grizzlies in the County pack, average age 32, were
expected to call the tune, they were mostly matched by the vigour and
cohesion of their youthful rivals, except in the realms of stealing ball
at contact points and in conceding, at the fourth attempt, a scrummage
pushover try to Gareth Flockhart. While occasional lineout deflections
were miscued by each side, Malcolm Norval vied with Scott Murray and
Malcolm McVie for honours on their own throw. Those aged Stirling
warriors still proved remarkable, and their youngest member, Flockhart,
took some holding.
The most influential forward afield, however, was Rob Hoole, the
father figure of the Academicals pack at 27, with his nose for the
action points and dynamic application once there.
Stirling should have brought more of their ball to fruition but they
were generally stifled in midfield by the wholehearted efforts of Chris
Simmers, Craig Murray, and their loose forwards. Kenny Logan, however,
made heavy imprint by seeking work and proving a hot handful for Aidan
Dow. Craig Sangster was alert for counterattack but once was unable to
latch on with Logan at full throttle outside him and clear.
Academicals relied heavily on Simon Burns who seems in his element on
the old fullback stand and whose adventurism gave the proceedings much
needed pep. There were also several tactically sound touches from
Simmers. It was encouraging, too, that McKenzie, Duncan, and the
replacement, Sammy Dow, all showed that, even against organised
defences, stand-off halves can make enemy alarm bells ring.
The other Stirling try was by that 20-year-old thoroughbred Colin
McRobert, who chased his own kick ahead to get upper-body pressure on
the ball after McKenzie had switched narrow off a scrummage and had
timed his feed to perfection.
The Academicals' try stemmed from Allan's lineout burst, a change of
angle by Duncan, regeneration by Hoole, an improvised one-handed pass
from Waite to Burns, who pulled in the last defence remnant before
setting George McKinlay free to score. Duncan iced the cake with a
touchline conversion that raised Academical hopes of at least a draw
until that spot-on McKenzie strike.

AT NETHERDALE
Gala 18, Boroughmuir 26
IN THE parlance of the dime novel, Gala were never going to come
quietly and make it easy for themselves. If, indeed, second-division
rugby lies in wait at the end of November then on Saturday they went
down with all guns blazing, heads held high, and all the other B movie
lines uttered whenever the hero is holed up in the hideout and
surrounded by the cops.
But go down they probably will. This was Gala's best display of the
season, but still it was not good enough in the face of a determined,
yet by recent standards, edgy performance from Boroughmuir, who have
opened up a three-point gap at the top of the Premiership table and who
can now afford one defeat in the four games remaining and still retain
one point in hand.
To a large extent the game was overshadowed by the dismissal of
Boroughmuir captain Peter Wright, and the knock-on consequences for
Scotland against Western Samoa in just under three weeks' time, but the
unpalatable morsel for Gala to digest is that, if they had played like
this from the start of the season, then they would never have been in
the parlous state they now find themselves in.
The Maroons competed with fiery passion up front, where Isaac, Stolz,
and the back-row put themselves about, and then some. Behind the
forwards, Gala always looked dangerous when the ball was spread wide but
they never secured overall control at crucial periods.
Gala coach Peter Dods was more than happy with the commitment his
charges had displayed. ''The passion was back and that was pleasing in
itself. But that was a game we could have won and with four games left
and eight points on the table we just have to go hell-for-leather for
it. It's just a pity the season wasn't starting now,'' he confided
later.
His Meggetland counterpart Henry Edwards was just glad to have secured
the win and despite the fact that his side led 17-10 at the turn, he
felt that they had made too many mistakes in the first half.
He reckoned, too, that a disallowed Peter Wright try following a
try-line scramble -- which had been, at least, the catalyst for some of
the nonsensical verbals which led to the Scotland prop's dismissal --
had been good.
He was, though, making no excuses for Wright. ''Peter is innocent
until proved guilty but he has to learn to keep his mouth shut. You can
only go so far,'' said Edwards.
Gala had suffered disruption to their playing personnel, David
Paterson departing with a neck injury, with van Rooyen taking over the
scrum-half duties and David Changleng being replaced by brother Michael
with 25 minutes left after suffering an ankle injury.
The major disruption, however, was to Boroughmuir, flanker Neil
Dickson having to leave the field to accommodate replacement prop Lewis
Graham after Wright's sixty-fourth-minute departure.
Boroughmuir's international aspirant Stuart Reid did not enjoy the
kind of barnstorming game that he did against Melrose last weekend. His
hands let him down a few times, which was a pity in view of the fact
that the team to play Western Samoa is to be picked tonight, and the
more so because forwards' coach Richie Dixon was an onlooker. But Reid
still has been one of the most improved players of the season and one
who is almost always guaranteed to breach the gain line.
Boroughmuir were 10 points up within 12 minutes, Bryan Easson kicking
a penalty goal and adding the conversion to a Derek Stark try. Gala
clawed back to level-pegging with a penalty and a converted try from
Dalgleish but in a lean spell before the interval, when possession had
all but dried up, Dickson had a try for the visitors and Easson
converted to provide a flattering lead at half-time.
Easson kicked Boroughmuir further ahead with a penalty and then came
the disallowed Wright try which saw referee McCartney award three
penalties in quick succession for ''talking''. Dalgleish missed a
crucial penalty kick after 55 minutes but was on target eight minutes
later. Just a minute after that Wright had gone and Gala's tails were up
with a vengeance.
Scott Patterson squeezed over in the corner for a try which cut the
gap to two points but two further penalties from Easson eased
Boroughmuir into a championship pole-position lead despite a last-gasp
foray to the line by Patterson.

Hawick 10, Melrose 9
IF YOU want to hear about classic, entertaining rugby, forget it. If
you want drama and excitement, read on. We had it all at Mansfield Park.
Punch-ups, all-in wrestling, an injury-time winner, and a sending-off.
The ordering-off was the final distasteful act in a nasty, niggly game
that could not be dismissed as some would have it as ''something you can
expect when Border rivals meet.''
There were so many off-the-ball incidents the referee would have
needed eyes in the back of his head. In 79 minutes a linesman came to
his assistance, not for the first time, when he spotted Melrose flanker
Nick Broughton kicking Hawick's Cameron Murray on the ground. Stand-in
referee John Steele, having already warned the Kiwi forward, had no
alternative but to send him for the first shower.
The match was peppered with trivial dust-ups, and on occasion some
vicious punching, but justice was done when Hawick picked up the
winners' points, albeit in the first minute of injury time.
Melrose had to take the field without their international half-backs
Craig Chalmers and Bryan Redpath, both of whom were injured. Stand-in
scrum half Lee Haldane had little chance to show his mettle for he
rarely saw the ball without a green jersey attached to it, and Graham
Shiel, switched to fly-half, suffered in a similar fashion, for the
Melrose pack in the first half could not cope with the enthusiastic
Hawick eight. So outplayed were the visitors that, had they turned round
20 points in arrears, they could not have grumbled.
But because of missed opportunities and kicks Hawick led by only 7-3 .
. . a try by Kevin Reid goaled by Scott Welsh coming six minutes after
Gary Parker's first-minute penalty for Melrose.
The visitors showed a vestige of improvement after the interval, with
Doddie Weir looking more like his international self. Parker put over a
penalty in 44 minutes then put Melrose ahead again with a third kick on
the hour. It would have been a travesty had they held out to win. And it
seemed they would, when Scott Welsh missed a kickable penalty for the
fifth time in the match.
The game had really deteriorated by now, with fumbles, mis-passes, and
petty misdemeanours disrupting the play. Parker missed a good chance to
seal it for Melrose with a penalty but was wide for a third time.
Hawick finished with another flourish of handling, with Keith Suddon
and David Grant being held out. But with the match in injury time, the
Melrose backs drifted offside and the nail-biting kick was left to
Welsh. The fly-half's nerves held out and he slotted it. The game
drifted four minutes into injury time and Gary Parker had a futile
attempt at a penalty from almost 50 metres.
So in the end justice was done.
Hawick -- C W Turnbull; D Grant, C A Murray, A G Stanger, G L Suddon;
W S Welsh, K Reid; B J McDonnell, J A Hay, M Russell, A Imray, I Elliot,
D J Turnbull, B L Renwick, G L Allott. Replacement -- R Allott for
Stanger (12 min).
Melrose -- R Shepherd; G Parker, D Bain, A Purves, N White; G Shiel, L
Haldane; M Browne, S Scott, D Lunn, R Brown, G Weir, S Aitken, I
Feau'nati, N Broughton.
Referee -- J Steele (Dumfries).
SCORERS: Hawick -- Welsh, 1p, 1c; Reid, 1t. Melrose -- Parker, 3p.

AN extra two hours' appreciation of Manchester Airport was hardly a
pre-holiday bonus, but with that delay now history it was good at last
to get out of the figure-hugging tube that had been home for the past
nine hours. The weariness brought on by the journey was not helped by
Orlando's humidity and a seat in the air-conditioned bus that took us to
collect our hire cars brought cool relief.
The coach journey was short but long enough for our driver to have
enough time to plead the case for tipping. Valuable information was
offered and we learnt that 15%-20% on top of the bill should be given to
a waiter and that a porter might expect $2 per piece of baggage handled.
Our driver's expectations lay in the latter category and there followed
an interlude where the sound of rustling notes (# accepted) assured that
we British would do what we could to ease the American low wage ethos.
We were also warned that the car hire people were smart cookies and to
be careful not to upgrade to a Mercedes.
The driver unpacked his bus and exchanged baggage for dollars, leaving
a swarming case-laden public to find a clearing while the driver joined
the queue for the car.
Our booking was for three persons on fly-drive that qualified us for
an economy car, a Metro, which in America is like a baby Cavalier but
nevertheless quite useless for three adults with suitcases and hand
luggage. The first car that was suitable, two upgrades later, would cost
$11 each day. Weariness to be bothered with a fight put $154 in the
hands of the hirer, but there was more.
Collision damage waiver I had been warned about by my travel agent and
when $209.86 was calculated there was no argument. However, I did manage
to battle my way out of paying additional insurance which I had been
advised was unneccesary. Because the hire took place in Florida there
was a surcharge of $2.05 per day. This was to help the state keep its
environment clean and a princely $0.05 of this charge went towards
battery and tyre recycling.
Wilting in the humid heat, I wondered what other penalties lay ahead.
My wait was not long. A handling fee was required which amounted to $2
per day. This fee includes ''administrative and billing costs for
handling vouchers, service of valeting and explaining function of
vehicle, busing, handling of luggage and movement of vehicles'', but
there was more.
An access fee set at $3.23 per day was the next little surprise. The
$45.29 handed over was to ''assist in covering all or part of the
airport concession fees, plus additional cost of doing business on
airport''. To this add $19.03 for fuel, a sales tax of 6% and my
fly-drive holiday cost $501.43 before I had my first hotdog.
Costs such as collision damage waiver and state tax are to be
expected, however, the cars offered are generally not big enough to take
passengers and luggage which means a costly upgrade. The ideal would be
to hand over a car voucher at the hire desk and be given a car key
without being cornered and inflicted by sharp and costly jabs by a an
insensitive clerk.

Watsonians 14, Heriot's FP 23
THERE was a time earlier this season when conversations with Heriot's
officials frequently included references to the continued absence
through injury of Andy Macdonald. The 6ft 8in lock, it was frequently
argued, would have guaranteed lineout possession for Heriot's and with
it the chance to play creative rugby.
Well, Macdonald has not materialised at Goldenacre this season but
that has not stopped Heriot's shaping their game round a strong pack in
which the front five are steadily exerting a greater influence. Whether
that will allow them to survive in the first division remains to be seen
but certainly it seems that Heriot's, making a late charge in the
championship, are not counting themselves out.
Nor should they. Against Watsonians on Saturday, Heriot's scrummaged
much more powerfully -- earning further credits for the steadily
improving Stuart Paul -- and crucially they were the more efficient in
winning ball from the rucks. And behind a winning front five, Graham
Dall produced a timely display, the young flanker using his dynamic pace
repeatedly to win loose ball for Heriot's.
All of which again puts question marks over the collective ability of
the Watsonians' pack, perhaps lulled into believing, because of success
in early games, that their backs would deliver win after win.
Watsonians' back division, however, was manifestly not operating on all
cylinders on Saturday, Scott Hastings suffering the effects of flu and
Duncan Hodge giving the impression that he had returned to rugby with
imprudent haste following his ankle injury in Cyprus.
Sadly for Watsonians, Scott Hastings was forced to retire with a
concussive injury three minutes into the second half and only a minute
after fellow centre Andrew Garry had also departed, suffering a
hamstring twinge. Heriot's, too, suffered a costly loss with a leg
injury to their stand-off Terry Rahui. The Aucklander had made a telling
contribution in the first half with two penalty goals and the conversion
of an opportunist try by Dave Stoddart following Gavin Hastings'
ill-fated attempt to run the ball in his own 22-metres area.
The elder Hastings, however, atoned with three penalty goals, to
narrow Heriot's lead. Watsonians then took the lead when Fergus
Henderson, appearing on his opposite wing, took an inside pass from
Gordon Hannah to score a finely worked try. But the Myreside men enjoyed
only a brief advantage, Ken Milne retilting the balance with a typical
try, the result of a series of short-range drives by the Heriot's
forwards. Cameron Glasgow converted and then added a penalty goal in a
strong finish that, who knows, might mirror Heriot's league campaign.

Rahui, F McMillan; M Livingstone, K Milne, S Paul, J Turnbull, P Young ,
S Elliott, T McVie, G Dall. Replacements: Proctor for Rahui (42min).

A MAN called Peter. No, not the Galilean fisherman but the Bonnyrigg
blacksmith. Wright of that ilk. It was always going to take the
dismissal of a high-profile player, and especially on the virtual eve of
a Test match, to run a coach and horses through the Scottish Rugby
Union's disciplinary procedure. Not so much the procedure itself but,
certainly, the manner in which the edicts of the Murrayfield
disciplinary panel are communicated to the outside world.
Correction. That should read the manner in which the edicts of the
Murrayfield disciplinary panel are not communicated to the outside
world. To recap, what happens is this. A player is sent off and if he
chooses to plead his case in person before the panel (which, by the way,
comprises Graham Young, Alan Hosie, and Lorne Crerar, splendid chaps
all) then he can expect to appear before the beaks within around three
weeks.
He can compress the timescale by opting to accept the contents of the
referee's report and the whole thing is handled courtesy of the Royal
Mail, but, at the end of the day, the upshot is the same. The referee
will be told the sentence. The player and his club will be told the
sentence. And that is it. All of those who were at the game or those who
just have a passing interest in this kind of thing will have to rely
upon the media squirrelling the information from what we like to refer
to as ''usually reliable sources'' -- usually the player's club or, in
some cases, the player himself.
The policy -- and we do hear that there are senior and influential
figures within the SRU who agree -- is a nonsense. As the game aspires
to a hitherto unheard of profile, that profile will inevitably contain
elements of the bad as well as the good.
Perhaps the SRU have stuck to their guns on this policy of
non-disclosure as part of a misguided attempt to protect the referee.
Listening to the touchline comments up and down the land, you could be
excused for thinking otherwise, but referees are only human. Sometimes
they do get it wrong. If the Union has hitherto decided that sentences
should remain official secrets on the basis that, sometimes, dismissal
was not warranted and that the least said about a token sentence the
better, then this is a policy which will not hold water.
Nevertheless -- and none of the immediately foregoing is applicable in
this case -- the dismissal of Wright by Kenny McCartney on Saturday has
presented the Union with a dilemma. Perhaps the powers that be, who are
not as immune to public opinion as some of their most rabid and
unthinking critics would have you believe, are in the process of
reviewing the situation in any case, but the Wright affair -- bad news
though it is for Peter -- represents the ideal opportunity for a change
of heart.
Here is a high-profile player who was a certainty to play for Scotland
in a Test match in less than three weeks' time. He will probably be
dealt with within the next few days. In the meantime, he may have been
selected to play for his country and, if not, then maybe a vacant slot
will be left on the team sheet.
Either way, his fate at the hands of the disciplinary panel takes on
an aura of national significance. We shall all, surely, have to be told
officially of his fate in explanation for his appearance, or otherwise,
in a Scotland shirt.
Such weighty matters, of course, were the last thing on McCartney's
mind as he sent Wright to the changing room for persistent carping and
yapping at Netherdale on Saturday -- on which point I will say only that
Peter, who had a poor disciplinary record as a youngster, is now old
enough to know better and perhaps the sending-off (more sad than bad as
it was) will have served as a particularly brutal reminder of that fact
-- but if the incident serves to overturn a particularly unsustainable
stance at Murrayfield, then some good may come from it yet.

The Ball Season puts Vienna in a whirl from New Year to Lent, Margaret
Henderson reports
AT the end of the year it will be the Ball Season in Vienna once more.
Alles Walzer! Nightly the dancing-master's inaugural cry will echo
through the palaces of the departed Habsburgs and the mansions of a
vanished aristocracy. In grand hotels and gilded ballrooms all over the
city, the leader of the waltz-orchestra bows low and the surge for the
dance-floor begins, to the tantalising first bars of the dear old Blue
Danube.
Alles Walzer! From Hogmanay until Lent, it's as if the Habsburgs and
their court had come to life again. The glittering Kaiserball still
opens the Viennese carnival season exactly in the style to which their
imperial majesties were accustomed, and in the same place, the Vienna
Hofburg, their Winter Palace.
Crowds still gather in the courtyard of the Hofburg to spot
celebrities arriving in horse-drawn coaches with bowler-hatted coachmen.
Handsome hussars stand to attention on the Grand Staircase as the guests
ascend for a night of waltzing and feasting, and entertainment by
singers and dancers of the Vienna State Opera.
If the Kaiserball sounds too grand, there are at least a dozen less
formal New Year balls listed in the annual Viennese Ballkallender which
comes out in September. Be prepared for an old Viennese tradition at New
Year balls, an invasion of chimney sweeps carrying pigeons. Accept a
bristle from a sooty brush for luck and cross a palm with silver. And
welcome the New Year, when it comes, with a waltz. It will bring you
luck, so the Viennese say, for the rest of your days.
The Ballkallender has details of a couple of hundred balls throughout
the season. (The serious ball fan in Vienna can find a dozen balls to
choose from most nights, a lot of them with tickets sold on the night.)
About 30 of the balls are Grand Balls with tickets sold in advance. A
few are masked balls where fancy dress, though not compulsory, makes the
evening a lot more fun.
The Ball of the Vienna Philharmonic is one of the more prestigious
Grand Balls, held in the Golden Hall of the Philharmonic's concert
house, the Musikverein. The musicians play the first waltz, then step
down to dance the night away to the music of a Viennese ball orchestra.
The Hofburg Palace is the venue for the Army Officers' Ball, the Police
Ball, the Lawyers' Ball -- and the Ball of Viennese Coffee House Owners,
reflecting the importance of coffee houses as second homes to the
Viennese.
To the Viennese, the equivalent of our office party is the ball, a
night of waltzing and champagne, a surprise happening at midnight,
dancing again until dawn, a parting gift for each lady as the music of
the last waltz dies away, then the traditional Katerfrustuck. Throughout
the carnival season, the stately squares of Vienna come to life again at
first light, with thousands of couples in evening dress making their way
on foot to a favourite coffee house serving the ''hangover breakfast''
of beer and gulasch soup.
The origin of the Viennese ball goes back to the reign of the Empress
Maria Theresa. Vulgar parades of clowns and comics along the streets of
the Imperial capital displeased her and she commanded the plebs to take
their celebrations indoors. Imitating the Court festivities, they began
throwing balls of their own, never dreaming that their descendants would
be waltzing in royal palaces in the not too distant future.
The earliest balls were organised by the trades guilds. To this day,
each trade and profession holds its Carnival Ball. The Plumbers' Ball
has a long, proud history, like the balls of head waiters, haulage
contractors, school janitors, university professors, officers of the
Federal Army, Croats of the Burgenland, daughters and sons of Viennese
master butchers and many, many more. Viennese tax inspectors never fail
to make their annual return in mid-February to the Park Hotel,
Schonbrunn. Happy smiles spread across their faces -- I have it on good
authority -- as the dear old Blue Danube heralds a night of fancy
footwork.
A good choice for visitors to Vienna is the ball organised by the
city's florists and municipal gardeners, the Flower Ball. It is an
experience that remains vivid in the memory long after the night --
waltzing, waltzing to the intoxicating music of Strauss in the vast
ballroom of the neo-Gothic Town Hall flagrant with the loveliest floral
decorations you are ever likely to see; waltzing until the enormous
crystal chandeliers seem to be spinning around too; waltzing, waltzing
until the leader of the orchestra dips his violin and bows low and 3000
dancers circle to a halt . . .
To get the most out of a visit to Vienna at ball time, it's a good
idea to arrive a couple of days before your first ball and take a few
lessons on the Viennese waltz. It's a bit more stylish than the old
one-two-three, one-two-three of one's schooldays. Among the many famous
schools of ballroom dancing in Vienna, perhaps the most exclusive is the
old-established Elmayer school with rooms in the Pallavicini Palace,
across the road from the winter premises of the Spanish Riding School.
Elmayer's was founded by Colonel Willy Elmayer-Vestenbrugg, a cavalry
officer until the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, after which
he became better known as an authority on deportment and old-fashioned
etiquette.
Ladies should allow time for a visit on the day of the ball to a
Viennese hairdresser. For a special treat, try one of the famous salons
such as Werner Jost's with long experience of artistically arranging
chignons and other touches of Imperial style for celebrities attending
the Grand Balls.
Informality is creeping into the Viennese Carnival season -- some of
the fancy dress parties thrown by students are quite wild -- but
dressing up is still the order of the day at balls. A long dress for the
lady is essential. A Strauss waltz in a short dress just doesn't bear
thinking about. The Grand Balls are white-tie-and-tails and ball-gown
occasions.
Accessores favoured by the male Viennese ball-goer include top hats,
opera cloaks, even lorgnettes. Opera glasses also come in handy. With
some of the ballrooms the size of football pitches, how else would one
see who's there and, more important, with whom?
The Ball Season ends, officialy at least, with the glamorous Opera
Ball, a state occasion attended by the Federal President of Austria, the
cream of Viennese high society and stars such as Pavarotti who are not
averse to making impromptu contributions to the cabaret. For this one
night of the year, the stalls are removed from the auditorium and the
Opera House becomes a flower-bedecked ballroom. Tables with a view, and
boxes, cost the equivalent of #5000 and #6000 and even the cheapest
ticket will set you back about #100.
Unfortunately the waiting list for the Opera Ball is long, unless you
are very well connected. But don't worry, next season will soon come
round again; for there will be a next season and many more. Viennese
balls, once sampled, easily become an addiction. They really should
carry a government health warning. Go to just one, and every winter the
symptoms of ball-fever will return -- head spinning, itchy feet, twinkly
toes, strange voices in the head.
The Ballkallender for 1995-96 is available free of charge from the
Austrian National Tourist Office, 30 St George Street, London W1R 0AL,
telephone 0171 629 6146. The tourist office will give advice about
buying ball tickets in advance and help with social introductions at
professional balls.
In Vienna, tickets for most balls other than the Kaiserballand the
Opera Ball are available from hotels and tourist information centres,
from about #15.

GAVIN Fleming and Jim Sinclair (Heriot-Watt University), sailing an
Albacore, could be thankful that there was no racing yesterday at the
Yachting Life Scottish Champion of Champions regatta at Dalgety Bay, for
their Saturday score of a fourth, second, and a first place stood
unchallenged in the 47-boat, all title-winners' event.
Saturday's light breezes, which at best summoned eight or nine knots
from the west, expired entirely yesterday and left the fleet ashore for
the morning, waiting for wind. The regatta, which collects all
Scotland's dinghy champions for a head-to-head finale, is raced on
handicap, using average lap times.
Fleming won the opening contest, while, going on to second overall,
Don and Alan Gillies, in a GP 14, won the second race. The International
14 of Peter Bennet and Chris Lafferty won the third heat.
At Largs yesterday, the Macleman brothers took the top prize as the
Nardini's Autumn Series concluded. In Class 1 they retained their
unbeaten record yesterday, as did John and Hilary Connelly's Sigma 33.

Clydebank 2, Hamilton 0
KEN Eadie had a low-key celebration after collecting his 200th goal,
but he admitted: ''It is nice to get a landmark like that.
''It was a superb cross from Craig Flannigan and I got above the
defenders and got behind it to head it in.''
Clydebank coach Brian Wright added: ''That was a typical Eadie goal.''
The important strike came after 65 minutes and made sure of the three
points.
Revealed Wright: ''There was speculation a couple of weeks ago that
Ken had got his 200th, but James Grady claimed that goal. And Ken was
happy to let it go, for he wanted it to be a little special when he got
it.
''And that's just what he did, for he put it away in outstanding
fashion.''
Clydebank are now in a comfortable fifth position and are 14 points
ahead of bottom-placed Hamilton.
Accies' problems exist as they are still suffering from their lack of
a goalscorer and it is so painful for them.
Even Bankies' coach Wright -- a former Accies man -- was moved to
admit that his opponents had played the better football for periods, but
that was little consolation to Hamilton manager Iain Munro, who saw yet
another defeat add to his worries.Munro moaned: ''Surely, things can
only get better.
''I cannot fault my lads for lack of effort. We need to get ahead just
once in a game, but I can promise our fans that we will battle on.''
Their danger-man, Paul Hartley, set up a chance for Steve McCormick
when the sides were still scoreless, but after he had rounded the keeper
his shot was cleared off the line by Tom Currie.
During that first half, Hartley promised to give them the boost they
badly need as he came close on three occasions. Then former Bankies
defender Martin McIntosh came up to send a 20-yarder just over.
That was a good reply after losing the opener in 25 minutes when Joe
Robertson cut in from the right to collect a Grady through ball, and
sent a left-foot shot into the net.
Said Robertson: ''My left foot is my strongest and I cut in and had
only one thought in mind -- to shoot.''
But at the end, struggling Hamilton still prop up the division with
only three points from their 11 games -- and that league table tells a
true tale, for they have scored only five goals.
However, Wright is happy with his Bankies side and added: ''It was a
scrappy game, but these were two outstanding goals.
''At the start of the season some people were talking that we would be
involved in the relegation area, but our lads are showing a lot of
character and getting good results.''

Dundee Utd 3, Dunfermline 1
DUNDEE United are proving to be quick learners. The lessons of the
opening quarter of the first division have been learned, and although
manager Billy Kirkwood still has a ''could do better'' at the end of his
early-term report card, the Tannadice men proved with this victory that
they are ready to pass their prelims with flying colours.
And if they can defeat Clydebank in a rearranged league match on
Tuesday, they will go top of the league -- something neither management
nor players would have dared to think about only three games ago when
Dunfermline were no fewer than eight points clear.
But three straight wins, while the Fifers have faltered, have changed
all that. And the signing of Owen Coyle to partner Gary McSwegan up
front has had a major bearing on the United revival.
Their running, particularly off the ball, gives the experienced Jim
Bett, and wide players Andy McLaren and Robbie Winters, plenty of moving
targets at which to aim, and if Coyle in particular had taken half his
chances at Tannadice on Saturday, Dunfermline's heads would have been
much lower as they trooped out of the ground.
Although it may sound like carping after such an excellent result,
United's main weakness still is not finishing off opponents when they
have them on the rack.
Assistant player-manager Maurice Malpas said afterwards: ''It was only
in the last minute we got that third goal. One slip could have let them
back in.''
On Coyle and McSwegan, he said: ''The remainder of the team are
confident that they will score, and that takes the pressure off
defenders.''
A word with McSwegan and Coyle to learn their own views on how the
partnership is developing would have rounded off the day for the
assembled scribes, but manager Kirkwood decreed not one of his players,
outwith Malpas -- who, after all is management -- would be allowed to
speak to the media.
Kirkwood himself was equally cautious. ''There's a long way to go, but
it's a good result, and good for the league. Some of the football we
played, particularly in the first half, was the best I've seen.''
Dunfermline, with new signing Brian Rice in the side after his move
from Falkirk on Friday, had to play him wider than was intended after
Hamish French, due to return after a long absence, called off on
Saturday morning with a recurrence of a pelvic injury.
Rice, however, showed his class when setting up Dunfermline's opener
for David Bingham to head-flick on, and Greg Shaw to score from close
range.
United equalised just before the interval when Coyle touched home a
Steven Pressley header, and 10 minutes after the break, a delightful
McSwegan head flick from a Malpas throw-in sent McLaren through to put
his side ahead.
Ivo den Bieman was unlucky to receive a second booking for a shoulder
charge on Coyle, and off he went. As has happened in the past, the
10-man Dunfermline suddenly woke up, and they created a couple of
chances that could have seriously embarrased United before McSwegan
knocked home a cut-back from substitute Craig Brewster.
Dunfermline assistant manager Dick Campbell, while unhappy at den
Bieman's sending off, refused to make excuses. ''Even Stevie Wonder
could have seen today that the majority of possession was in United's
favour. We did not play well enough to warrant anything from the game.''
Campbell refused to use the fact that six first-team players were
sitting in the stand -- including the injured strike force of French,
Kenny Ward, and Andy Smith.
* UNITED'S bid to bring to bring their former midfielder Ray McKinnon
back to Tannadice failed yesterday. Manager Billy Kirkwood confirmed
that the club had tabled an agreed bid to Aberdeen, but the move broke
down, it seems, when it came to personal negotiations.

St Johnstone 0, St Mirren 0
HO, HUM. About a game that failed to start, it is hard to know how to
begin. Weary wisdom suggests to skip it. For once, though, some romantic
optimism may rest on firm ground. Although distant football parks, like
other fields, seem often greener, better days could lie ahead for both
teams.
While an empty encounter offered little to enchant the eye, without
going into sooth-saying it was possible to detect an improved shape of
things to come. Time could be on the side of both sets of Saints.
Improvement is unlikely this week or next month. But, yes, the
portents are favourable. There were encouraging signs. Anyhow, in such
bleak circumstances as both clubs find themselves, looking forward is
the only way.
Brighter tomorrows were mirrored by the pattern of the game, so far as
it had one.
St Johnstone ended well. A mesmerising run and cross by Kevin Twaddle
deserved better treatment than to be trundled past the far post. Ian
Ferguson, a late substitute, headed a corner against the crossbar.
After Ferguson's long absence, St Johnstone will soon expect more from
him than the four minutes he was asked to play. John Blackley, the
assistant manager, reckons he may be three reserve games from fitness.
More immediate encouragement lay in the sturdy performances in
midfield of Stuart McCluskey -- a mere 17 years of age -- and Danny
Griffin, who is all of a year older.
Partly, it was the youth of both teams that made for the naive
untidiness of the game. Yet its most mature moment came with a patiently
delayed shot by Griffin that Alan Combe did well to stop.
Now and again, Combe's goalkeeping was put to heroic test. One minute
he showed courage to dive at the feet of Roddy Grant, and the next
needed much athletic strength to save with an arm a scorcher from
Twaddle.
When ordinary, conventional skills can be added to Twaddle's
instinctive gifts, he will be a wonder.
Many natural good qualities were also shown by Mark Yardley for St
Mirren. He worked well, especially with his head, in close quarters and
passed coherently.
Jimmy Bone, the St Mirren manager, caught the dominant note of future
tense about the afternoon. ''It will be quite an interesting pairing of
Yardley with Barry Lavety when he comes back,'' he said. He hoped to
have six of his absent players available within a fortnight.
Of those present, Paul Archdeacon continued to impress. He loves to
have a go. Diddling two defenders on the edge of the box, he had a snap
shot over the bar, but only just.
Recalling such bright incidents suggests the occasion was not so dull
as it felt at the time, but it was. When promise is so much richer than
performance, fans start asking themselves what they are paying for now.

Airdrie 2, Dundee 3
THE referee supervisor's report promises fascinating reading and the
post-mortem is destined to run long after unprecedented scenes at
Broadwood.
Match officials required a police escort; five players were booked;
Dundee's assistant coach remonstrated with police, and Airdrie's captain
Jimmy Sandison was red-carded after the game.
Game? That's a misnomer for this backlash from Airdrie's midweek
defeat in the Coca-Cola Cup semi-final.
The re-run bitterness truly exploded after two Dundee goals which
referee Dougie Smith allowed despite looking offside.
During a curt review of proceedings later, an apoplectic Alex
MacDonald almost emulated Eric Cantona's obscure ''when seagulls follow
the trawler'' speech.
''We were climbing a mountain,'' said MacDonald. ''We were trying to
get up Mount Everest backwards with a mule carrying empty drinks.''
That enigma presumably meant the referee was an ass, or was aimed at
Dundee's much-publicised heady celebrations after the cup clash.
With an official protest likely, MacDonald wisely declined further
comment on having ''too much to fight against''.
Dundee scored in three minutes when a fluffed John Martin clearance
fell to Neil McCann, whose low cross was netted by Morten Weighorst.
Airdrie equalised in 15 minutes after a John Davies drive broke from a
post to Paul Harvey, whose cross, headed down by Sean Sweeney, was
prodded home by Peter Duffield.
Crowd troubles began within a minute of the interval when Kenny Black
hit the woodwork and Paul Harvey's rebound was blocked by the arm of
Roddy Manley.
Smith missed that -- but allowed Weighorst a second goal five minutes
later, although he and Gerry Britton looked offside. Keeper Martin was
booked for dissent.
Substitute Jim Hamilton added a third for the visitors in 65 minutes
when Britton was again presumed not interfering with play.
Duffield pulled one back in 69 minutes but Dundee hung on to the
depressing end when Airdrie fans screamed foul abuse at officials.
At least Sweeney, seen kicking a grounded Weighorst in the semi-final,
made up, shaking hands.
But Sandison was sent off -- in the referee's room -- for less
gracious behaviour towards a linesman.
Dundee's player-manager Jim Duffy, although delighted with victory,
said he didn't agree with the offside rule on forwards apparently not
interfering with play when behind defenders.
Danish internationalist Weighorst, praised by Duffy for adapting to
the Scottish game, said he had no hard feelings towards Sweeney after
Wednesday night -- and had replied ''in the best way possible'' with two
goals.

THE Auchinleck revival continued with a 6-2 victory over Beith in the
Stagecoach Western League.
Goals from Ellis, Paterson, and McDonald in a seven-minute spell
midway in the first half helped them to a 4-2 half-time lead. Talbot's
Gary Graham completed a miserable day for his former club with a double
in the second half.
A goal in 74 minutes from Milton Thompson gave Irvine Meadow the
points against Ardrossan and took them to the top of the Stagecoach
First Division.
In the Whyte and Mackay Cup, holders Shettleston had a narrow 4-3
victory over Irvine Vics. Town's Scott Miller took them through with a
well-taken hat trick.
In the same competition, Baillieston were reduced to seven men in
their game against Benburb, who ran out 10-0 winners.
With Vale of Leven on cup duty, Yoker took advantage to go top of the
Reebok First Division with a 4-0 victory over St Roch's.
Vale travelled to Saltcoats hoping to do the double over Ayrshire
teams in the Whyte and Mackay Cup, having beaten Ardrossan in the last
round. Vale led 1-0 at half-time from a Bryan Wardle goal, and further
goals from Grace and Russell took them through to the next round.
Glenafton progressed to the third round of the Irvine Times Cup at the
expense of Kilbirnie Ladeside. After a dull first half, the game came to
life a minute into the second half when Glens winger John Miller shot
home. Play raged from end to end and, with Kilbirnie pushing for the
equaliser, Glens substitute Billy Mullan broke through to put the tie
out of reach.
A Willie Elliott equaliser against nine-man Ashfield gave Neilston
their first league point of the season.
Tonight, Neilston will kick off their fiftieth anniversary
celebrations with a challenge game against a Celtic XI at Brig o' Lea
stadium.
Luncarty, without a win in the past two seasons, came within minutes
of beating Arbroath Vics in the Taycars Trophy. Arbroath equalised in
the final minute and went on to win 4-2 after extra time.
Hill o' Beath continue to lead the John Fyfe League following their

Dumbarton 0, Morton 2
MORTON midfielder Derek McInnes is likely to sign at last this week
for Rangers.
But not before an important meeting is held within 24 hours involving
the Greenock directors and McInnes and his agent Bill McMurdo.
The Greenock manager Allan McGraw was making no further comment
yesterday on the situation.
However, there is no doubt that the special clause inserted in the
McInnes contract when he re-signed last summer will enable the
midfielder to move on to the club he wishes.
That clause enables him to leave Morton if an offer of #250,000 is
received for him.
However, Morton are upset that this sum has been made known to other
clubs ahead of them agreeing a transfer fee.
McInnes was left out on Saturday and is ready to put his case to the
Scottish League management committee, who have a copy of his contract.
Despite the off-the-field speculation, Morton are in joint third place
after two-goal Warren Hawke again struck to earn them the points at
Boghead.
Said McGraw: ''That was an outstanding display when I consider the
hype of the past week at the club.
''My players put all the controversy behind them and concentrated on
the job in hand.
''We changed the style, playing only two in the middle with McInnes
missing, and I thought that Janne Lindberg and Alan Mahood were
outstanding in that area and worked so very hard.''
Hawke struck after 11 minutes when he collected a Marko Rajamaki cross
to drive in from 10 yards, and then added a second in 34 minutes.
But it was another day of disappointment for Dumbarton manager Jim
Fallon, who admits he has an uphill battle on his hands.
* TORQUAY player-manager Don O'Riordan has been sacked following the
8-1 home defeat by Scunthorpe on Saturday.
The 38-year-old Irishman helped United stave off relegation from the
League three seasons ago as a player and took them to the division three
play-offs in his first season in management.
But they have won just one of their past 14 games and Saturday's
defeat was their biggest in the league for 62 years.
''It is embarrassing to lose 8-1. It was the worst day of my 23 years
as a professional,'' said O'Riordan.

ELGIN City manager Chico McHardy may well have considered calling the
local constabulary on Saturday as Brora Rangers plundered an
ill-deserved three points.
In an amazing series of events, City had four efforts scrambled off
the line and also hit the woodwork as they tried desperately to claw
back a one-goal deficit.
McHardy said: ''That was definitely a case of daylight robbery. Brora
got away with murder.''
A strike after 44 minutes by Jocky Mackay gave the Sutherland men
victory.
A stunning Keith comeback denied title race rivals Peterhead full
points. The Blue Toon got off to a flier, with Doug Baxter scoring an
early opener, and despite an incredible Keith onslaught John McGachie
made it two in 59 minutes.
Justice was seen to be done, however, with Andy Lavelle and Scott
Taylor scoring for Keith to tie the scores.
The draw allowed Huntly to reassert a four-point championship lead
after a 3-0 win at Buckie, and Cove Rangers moved level on points with
Keith and Peterhead after a 3-0 win at Nairn.
In the Qualifying Cup replay, Fraserburgh booked a cup final place
after beating Lossiemouth in a penalty shoot-out.
Scott Clark was the hero when he hammered in the decisive spot-kick
after the teams were tied 1-1 at the end of extra-time.

SCOTLAND'S last unbeaten record ended on Saturday, when only 236 fans
saw Arbroath upset Jim Leishman's Livingston by 1-0 at Meadowbank.
It was against the run of play when Steve McCormick punished a mistake
17 minutes from time, but that would not worry Arbroath manager John
Brogan. The writing already was on the wall for Leishman's team when the
normally reliable Jason Young -- scorer of 10 goals so far this season
-- missed a penalty just before the break.
Livingston were quickly consoled by the fact that no team in the top
half of the table managed to secure three points. Brechin and the
high-scoring Caley Thistle cancelled each other out, with both keepers
largely responsible for the goalless draw.
There were 1646 fans at Dingwall, where Willie Furphy's 20-yard shot
after a corner gave Ross County the lead in the final quarter only for a
Murray Hunter lob to earn East Stirlingshire a draw.
Albion Rovers hit back to beat Alloa 2-1 but Queen's Park have dropped
to the foot of the table after their fightback just failed at
Cowdenbeath, who won 3-2.

Hibernian 2, Kilmarnock 0
ALEX Miller and his players are preparing for a make-or-break
premier-division spell, even though there are six months before the end
of the season.
The Edinburgh team moved clear of Aberdeen into third place behind the
Old Firm with Saturday's convincing win over steadily improving
Kilmarnock.
But longest-serving player Gordon Hunter possesses several video
copies of this movie, which he has collected since joining the Easter
Road club 12 years ago.
The 28-year-old central defender is in his testimonial year with a
team that are continually slick starters, but then tend to fade back
into the pack during November.
Last year at this time, their good early form had them just two points
behind Rangers, but their next seven fixtures did not include a single
victory.
The season before, they had actually led the league by the end of
October, but yet again the familiar slump came, with this time just one
win from their next seven games.
''It clearly has all been about consistency, but there are definite
signs this season that we are making real progress in that area,''
insisted Hunter.
''Our 4-2 win over Motherwell last week, and then Saturday's victory
against Killie, were exactly the type of games that have seen us trip in
the past.
''But we won both matches well and on Saturday I thought we stayed
very patient to register two successive wins for the first time this
season.
''Kilmarnock made it very hard for us with their industry, but our
players stuck to the game plan and produced good finishing when the
chances came along.''
Michael O'Neill sapped some of the spirit from Kilmarnock when he
stroked in a superb Darren Jackson pass just as referee Hugh Dallas was
checking his watch for half-time.
And when Keith Wright nodded in a second in 65 minutes after a smooth
build-up which involved Pat McGinlay and Kevin McAllister, it indicated
that the game had gone from Alex Totten's team.
Wright agrees that after breaking smartly from the blocks before
finishing down the field in previous seasons, Hibs do have a chance of
being involved in the finish this time.
''I'm not going to go shouting about our chances, but this is the best
team I've played with in five years at Easter Road,'' he said.
''A number of our players have recently had international experience
at full and Under-21 level, and I think that has added authority and
confidence to the team.''
Kilmarnock are clearly turning the corner after a dreadful start to
the season, and there was little wrong with their work at the back and
midfield, especially when they had lost possession.
But Totten desperately needs to add a similar level of proficiency to
his front players, who rarely did enough to trouble Jim Leighton.

Raith Rovers 2, Rangers 2
THE danger of their minds being elsewhere probably did not exist for
Rovers, who don't get the chance to play Rangers every week, but it
might have been a factor in the insipid showing of their opponents for
much of the game.
Raith have the virtually impossible task of trying to turn round a 2-0
deficit from the first leg of their UEFA Cup-tie against Bayern in
Munich tomorrow and maybe that fact has them relaxed and relatively
unconcerned, whereas Rangers, being Rangers, will be expected at least
to redeem their tarnished European reputation when they take on Juventus
in the Champions' League at Ibrox on Wednesday.
The Ibrox captain, Richard Gough, took a realistic stance when he
contemplated the big night in Glasgow, neither promising glory nor
warning of misery.
''In one sense there is less pressure on us because we are not
expected to win, but in another our fans will expect us to go out and
get a result at home,'' he said. ''A draw is no use to us. We have to
win and, obviously, that is a tough order against one of the best teams
in the world.''
Gough did not minimise the poverty of his team's show in Turin but did
point out that the three quick goals in the first half led to what might
have been a slightly flattering result.
''It is the kind of thing that kills a game, just like our own quick
goals against Hearts, but there is no doubt they are the best team I
have played against for a while.
''I had not played against Ravanelli before and I was very impressed
with his movement. Del Piero is one of those great talents which come
along only once in a while.''
Despite his clear respect for the skills of the Italian champions,
Gough is not ready to concede anything.
''They will obviously be favourites to beat us again but I hope we can
go out and play with a lot of heart and effort.
''If we can come off the field at the end, look in the mirror and say:
'We couldn't have given any more,' then we will be satisfied. It is
difficult with so many players injured or just coming back, but it is up
to those who come in to show they are worth their places in the side.''
The lost points at Stark's Park didn't do his team any favours in the
confidence department, whereas the gaining of a point lifted Rovers'
morale.
Their manager, Jimmy Nicholl, is never afraid of taking a gamble when
needs must and he threw two of his former YTS lads into the heat of the
premier division in the hope that they would prove they could handle the
big occasion.
Neither Ian McMillan nor Mark Buist let him down. In fact, they did
much more, turning on genuinely impressive performances.
McMillan, whose average stature may be a disadvantage against bigger
opponents than McCoist, Salenko, and Durie, had an oustanding game while
Buist was not far behind.
The fact that both Rangers' goals came from headers, by Gough and
Gordan Petric, however, is perhaps an indication that the Fife defence
could prove vulnerable in the air with this line-up.
Nicholl might still give one, or both, of the young lads a place in
the team that runs on to the Olympic Stadium tomorrow.
''Put it this way,'' he said. ''Before the game they were not even
going to Munich. Now, they will be on the plane.''
Nicholl, naturally, was thrilled with the new boys' showing.
''I think these two will save me a lot of money and help me cut down
the trips to England looking for players to strengthen the squad.
''They have been a waste of time, anyway. If these lads can handle
that baptism they can cope with anything.''
The manager believes Tony Rougier, who did well against Rangers, could
be a key player against the Germans.
''He is beginning to play for the team now and he is looking good. I
hear there won't be a big crowd in Munich. I hope there's just 10,000,
it buckets down, and Bayern think they are through.''
The Rovers manager was entitled to feel his team should have been in
front at half-time after they had given Rangers a hard 45 minutes.
Their best effort was a memorable ''del Piero'' free kick, taken by
Danny Lennon, which crashed off the bar with Andy Goram beaten after
just nine minutes.
Had that gone in, the Fife confidence might well have soared, although
the Ibrox manager, Walter Smith, did point out that his team did not
start playing until after Raith took the lead in the second half.
Lennon scored that goal but Rangers nullified it with Gough's header.
When Rangers, with the considerable help of substitute Charlie Miller,
managed to raise their game and took the lead through Petric, they
seemed likely to escape with a win they hardly deserved but Raith came
back inside a minute to level matters with a Colin Cameron goal.
Rangers might have snatched the winner in the late stages when Paul
Gascoigne hit exciting form, one mazy run in particular leaving a trail
of bewildered Fife defenders and ending a touch unfortunately when the
ball slipped over the bye-line just as he passed for Mikhailichenko to
put it in the net.

Partick Thistle 1, Motherwell 0
HE stopped dead in his tracks and flashed a smile when his name was
called. Ian Cameron again looks content with life.
The Partick Thistle midfield player shone like a beacon on the grass
on Saturday and, as the gloom gathered over Firhill in early evening,
the man was at ease as he chatted about his employer's success against
Motherwell.
Just a few days earlier, Thistle presented Cameron with an offer
which, in his eyes, was not derisory to an individual with his undoubted
ability, and scribbled his name to a contract which ensures he will be
kicking a ball around the Maryhill area until at least next June. And
the result of the deal was instantaneous.
Cameron directed play like a traffic cop, and had Thistle's strikers
been more lively, their supporters would not have had to wait until the
last moment before showing signs of much merriment after Stevie Docherty
had headed the winning goal.
''It had been a very upsetting time for me until Wednesday, and I got
a new offer,'' said Cameron. ''It affects your football but, hopefully,
we can settle down and play, and you can see from today that we can
play.''
Thistle's problem, until three o'clock on Saturday said Cameron, was
that they surrendered possession of the ball far too readily.
''We kept giving the ball away, and when you don't have possession it
can be very tiring. We deserved to score. We kept pushing forward right
to the end.''
And, on the lateness of the winner, Cameron added: ''Well, the game is
played over 93 minutes.'' He flashed the smile again and wandered off a
happy man.
It would have been interesting keeping company with Thistle manager
Murdo MacLeod during the week, to ascertain as to how he transformed his
men, whose form of late has not enjoyed the best of health, into
entertainers.
''A few words were spoken last week,'' said the manager.
No doubt utterances that could not be made in front of those with a
retiring disposition -- we will never know -- but the message must have
got home.
''There was a new confidence about the team today,'' said MacLeod.
''We worked hard in training during the week, and today everyone played
for the club. If someone doesn't want to play for the club they will not
be chosen, simple as that.''
And of his latest ''signing,'' the manager added just two words
''different class.''
Media people then kicked their heels, checked their watches three of
four times a minute, and muttered quietly among themselves the question:
''where is Alex McLeish.''
The Motherwell manager does not have his troubles to seek. His side's
form has been distinctly iffy of late, and if weekend form is a
yardstick, there is a lack of commitment coursing through the ranks.
With Firhill being locked up for the night the big man finally
appeared, found a table to sit on, and eventually spoke.
But one felt great pity for the manager, who was obviously hurting
inside.
McLeish was a credit to his profession as a player with Aberdeen and
Scotland, and the question must be asked of his Motherwell employees,
are they doing all in their power for the cause and earning the wages
being paid?
The Fir Park leader spoke quietly and deliberately about the
afternoon's goings-on, answering questions politely but perhaps just
wishing he could make his way into a darkened room and scream.
''I was disappointed by the overall display,'' said McLeish. ''We have
to start showing character. It's a kick in the stomach for me and it has
to hurt the players as well.
''We are not talking about there being a long way to go in the league.
They have to do it now.''
As McLeish was left to his serious thoughts, Cameron was spotted
jotting his name down on paper for some young Thistle fans outside,
still smiling.
Oh, the ups and downs of football.

Falkirk 2, Hearts 0
DEREK Ferguson and Maurice Johnston, two former Hearts players, were
the chief architects in bringing more misery to the Tynecastle doorstep
as Falkirk collected three points at Brockville on Saturday to send the
Edinburgh club to the bottom of the premier division.
Johnston hammered the cruellest blow with the second goal almost on
full time -- it was his 100th premier-division strike -- and that
followed an afternoon in which he displayed a cool professionalism,
leading his line superbly and giving Hearts a chasing they will not
quickly forget.
But it was the majestic touches of Ferguson, who arrived from
Sunderland in the summer, which had Falkirk in control for most of the
time. The lad, who was a teenage sensation for Rangers before drifting
off to Hearts then south of the Border, is now a mature 28-year-old, who
insists he intends to grab this chance of getting some fun out of the
game.
Ferguson, who played on Saturday only after a last-minute decision,
said: ''I'm not fully fit, because of tendon trouble in my ankle, and it
was virtually the last minute before it was decided I would play. I
decided to have the ankle strapped up and give it a go. I'm glad I did
that.
''When I first came to Falkirk I said I was going to enjoy myself and
nothing has made me change my mind. I know it's going to be a hard
struggle and we will probably be fighting near the bottom end of the
table rather than at the top, but I'm determined to enjoy my football.
''There isn't the same kind of pressure here as at the bigger clubs
like Rangers and Sunderland, but that doesn't mean you take things any
less seriously. All the lads at Falkirk get on well with one another and
we carry that kind of thing on to the pitch for matches, but I want to
enjoy what I'm doing and that is happening at the moment.''
Falkirk certainly took the game by the scruff of the neck from the
start and were better than Hearts in every aspect, and that must been a
shock to Tynecastle systems, especially since they hammered the
Brockville club 4-1 in an earlier clash in Edinburgh.
Said Ferguson: ''I was certainly a wee bit disappointed with Hearts.
They just didn't seem to have any spirit about them. There's a big
difference since they played us at the start of the season.''
And Hearts manager Jim Jefferies, who was given a roasting by the
Falkirk fans who felt that he had betrayed them when moving from
Brockville, said: ''Falkirk were the hungrier side right from the off. I
warned our players that this would be a battle, but they started badly
and were second to every ball.
''We've got plenty of ability in our squad, but unfortunately that's
not enough in this league. You must have hunger and desire, and we
didn't have those qualities today.
''I know what is wrong at this club and I know what I want to do. But
it would take cash and that isn't possible. We are also missing injured
players such as Craig Levein, Steven Frail, and Kevin Thomas, and it is
all so frustrating, because the players coming in aren't taking their
chances.
''It really hurts to see a club like Hearts go out and struggle as
they did today, but it makes me all the more determined to turn things
around.''
Falkirk won with a bit of style, taking the lead after 24 minutes when
Ferguson floated a free kick towards the back post and David Weir scored
with a header. Hearts rallied briefly in the second half, but Johnston
and substitute Nicky Henderson combined in the last minute for the blond
striker to score with another header.
Incidentally, Hearts must have created a premier-division record on
Saturday when Gilles Rousset turned out in goal for them. The big
Frenchman is the fourth keeper they have used and the season isn't three
months old. Henry Smith, Craig Nelson, and Gary O'Connor have all been
given a chance, but Rousset, currently on a short-term contract, looks
like the man to hold down the place.

Celtic 2, Aberdeen 0
ABERDEEN must have known how difficult it was going to be to rack up
back-to-back victories over the Old Firm in Glasgow, but the manner in
which they lost this premier-division game must give manager Roy Aitken
some cause for concern.
This performance -- particularly after Celtic went in front -- was
light years away from the one they had given at Hampden against Rangers
in the Coca- Cola Cup semi-final just four days earlier.
Then, Eoin Jess was back to international form and Paul Bernard looked
to be worth that record #1m fee which the Pittodrie club paid for him.
At the weekend, they were mere shadows of the men who had done so much
to destroy the Ibrox team.
They were, of course, given a more searching examination by the Celtic
midfield than they had been given in the semi-final. Skipper Paul McStay
and the experienced Peter Grant were in superb form, showing the skills
and determination which their team will need from them in Europe this
week.
That return clash with Paris St Germain, naturally, dominated the
after-match inquests and manager Tommy Burns had good reason to feel
confident.
He had seen his side underline their championship ambitions as they
defeated an Aberdeen team who had talked of their own title hopes before
arriving at Parkhead.
He had watched as his men mastered Aberdeen without several of their
most influential players -- John Collins, Andreas Thom, and Phil
O'Donnell were all missing, though they should return for the
Cup-winners' Cup tie second leg.
And he had seen Brian McLaughlin score a memorable goal five minutes
before half-time to send Celtic towards this important win.
Afterwards, Burns smiled: ''The first goal was quite exceptional. We
had a lot of very good passing movements around the box today against a
team who are playing as well as anyone in the country just now. They are
not an easy side to play against so I have to be happy with that result.
''Peter Grant was outstanding in midfield and was our best player
today. Now we have to hope the injured players will be fit.''
As well as the trio who missed this game, Celtic had two more players
injured against Aberdeen -- Simon Donnelly and Andy Walker. But both
weekend casualties are expected to shake off their injuries in time for
the Thursday game.
The most seriously damaged player in this match was Aberdeen keeper
Michael Watt, stretchered off after only three minutes following a clash
with Walker which left him with a gashed knee.
Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken snapped: ''It was a particularly nasty
tackle which left our goalkeeper needing six stitches in his knee cap.
''Apart from that, I felt we paid the price for Tuesday night. When we
lost the first goal we always looked that little bit short. The opening
goal was always going to be important and they scored it.''
It was an exceptional goal from McLaughlin and one the little winger
will treasure, not only for its delightful execution, which deceived
substitute keeper Theo Snelders, but also because it was his first
league goal at Celtic Park.
The second goal arrived after an hour when Pierre van Hooydonk scored
from a penalty after John Inglis had brought down Andy Walker in the box
with a clumsy challenge.
Later, the giant Dutchman was insistent that the Aberdeen result can
be a springboard for a follow-up win in Europe. He said: ''We have been
playing well for most of the season and today we added goals to our good
approach work.
''We will have to be just as good against Paris St Germain and we know
the crowd and the atmosphere can be a big help for us.
''This is an opportunity to push Celtic into the European spotlight
once again. If we can defeat the French side then the rest of the
Continent will take notice, because Paris have a strong reputation after
the way they played in the Champions' League last season.
''If we can score before half-time, like today, then we can go into
the quarter-finals.''
That dream has been reinforced by the way Celtic gained this win over
the Pittodrie side. Indeed, they might have won by more goals against
the team which had humbled Rangers at Hampden.
Burns has been preaching the passing game since arriving as Celtic
manager and when his players are able to add a cutting edge to their
play -- as they did at the weekend -- then he must be able to take some
satisfaction from his persistence and patience.
An additional reward may come on Thursday. If Celtic maintain the
discipline in defence they demonstrated at the weekend, allied to the
midfield mix of graft and genius, then the French Cup-holders will find
it difficult to cling to their single goal lead in front of the sell-out
Parkhead crowd.
Burns promised after the first leg that this was going to be ''one
helluva night.'' This win has simply emphasised that.

STIRLING Albion's fans were in good form on Saturday as their
favourites achieved a deserved 1-0 home win over Berwick Rangers. The
enjoyable banter added to the entertainment and those locals who stayed
away on Saturday could do a lot worse than go along to the next home
game and share in a good afternoon's fun.
Albion should have been further ahead by half-time but had to settle
for a single counter, when lanky Steve McCormick stole in behind the
defence to poke in a ball driven low across goal by John Gibson. The
home side lazily opted for a long-ball game in the second half and
manager Kevin Drinkell was disappointed that they ''stopped playing
football.''
He added: ''They seemed intent on holding on to the three points. But
the result was important, as the leagues are so tight now.''
A Robert Scott goal secured a fifth away win for the leaders, East
Fife, and kept Ayr still winless at home.
Referee Martin Clark did Clyde no favours at Forfar, where he awarded
the home side a penalty (which was missed), and booked six visitors,
with Jim Brown being sent off for a double booking. A shot by Forfar's
Gary Higgins brought the only goal.
Stranraer needed a late goal to see off Stenhousemuir 2-1 and Queen of
the South hit four goals in 11 minutes to beat winless Montrose 4-2.

THE 1995 PGA European Tour came to a tense and stirring climax
yesterday at Valderrama. The 10-month war over the Volvo Order of Merit
title was clinched by Colin Montgomerie, now the holder for a third
consecutive year, rather overshadowing the four-day battle for the Volvo
Masters won by Alexander Cejka.
At 42 and, therefore, in probably his last chance of winning the merit
title, Sam Torrance could not hold the narrow lead he held over
Montgomerie, his total of 285 eventually being tied for third place by
David Gilford. But they were well beaten by the 24-year-old German who
had five birdies in the last eight holes for 32 home, a score of 70, and
total of 282, two under par.
With this latest success in his eighth full year, Montgomerie -- who
finished two strokes behind Cejka -- took his career earnings through
the #4m mark, in these last three seasons exceeding #2m, compared with
the #140,000 Severiano Ballesteros accumulated when he became the last
to win three successive merit tables 17 years ago.
That was not much more than the #125,000 Cejka earned for his victory,
his third of this season and a total he shares with Torrance and
Bernhard Langer.
The 32-year-old Montgomerie, who in Europe this year has won twice and
had 11 other top 10 finishes, including three seconds and three thirds,
yesterday earned #208,400, #83,400 from the tournament itself and the
#125,000 first prize from the sponsors' bonus pool. With his European
total of #835,051 Montgomerie's worldwide earnings for 1995 exceed
#1.2m.
Montgomerie took particular trouble to pay tribute to the back-up he
has had from his caddie, Alistair McLean, his wife and family.
''Alistair is intelligent, calm and patient and he keeps me going,''
Montgomerie said and pointedly, given recent events, added: ''And to
play this game to the standard I perform at you need a consistent home
life.''
Torrance's considerable consolation was prize money of #42,225 and
#83,000 from the bonus pool. But despite his best efforts Torrance could
not prevent Montgomerie maintaining a remarkable record, that of never
having gone down in the Order of Merit, his record reading 52nd, 25, 14,
4, 3, 1, 1, 1.
When Torrance arrived in Spain he held an advantage of #3829 over his
fellow Scot and he made a most valiant effort to take the title he has
chased for 25 years.
With a brilliant outward half of 32 and score of 68, three under par
-- both the lowest respective figures of the final round -- Torrance set
the target just as Montgomerie was making his way up the tenth fairway,
knowing that having himself taken 37 to he turn he was now relatively
level with Torrance and would have to come home in one under to win.
Montgomerie, at one point, led the tournament by a stroke, but a rare
excursion to the trees and then to a greenside bunker at the eighth and
a second shot which flew far right of the next green cost him bogey 5s
and his prospects of matching Ballesteros's record looked dark.
But having saved par from 10 feet at the tenth he hit a No.5-iron shot
to 10 feet to birdie the short twelfth, a valuable gain, and made par at
each of the remaining holes.
There was a suggestion that Montgomerie's final drive clipped the
branch of a tree. Whatever, the ball fell clear and he hit his approach
some 20 feet short of the hole. Montgomerie's first putt drew up three
feet short, but without the faintest apparent signs of nerve, he firmly
holed to sustain a remarkable record.
Of their duel, Montgomerie said: ''I have to offer my congratulations
and commiserations to Sam, for he's played so well all year. It's most
unlucky that he did not win, but I had to do this job.'' Torrance,
although visibly disappointed, acknowledged: ''C'est la vie. He did what
he had to do.''
When he set out, Torrance was five strokes adrift of Montgomerie, the
only player who mattered to him and, after a faltering start, he was to
drop only one more stroke.
Torrance's strength lay in the long-handled putter which he adopted in
1988 and which has transformed his career. He used it a mere 26 times,
saving par on five occasions and making birdies at the same number of
holes. But no gain was finer than the one he made at the last.
At this dog-leg left of 454 yards, Torrance hit such a huge drive that
he had only 124 yards to the flagstick. A closing birdie was, he
believed, esssential if he were to have any chance of staying ahead of
Montgomerie and he achieved it brilliantly by hitting a wedge shot to
four feet.
''These were the toughest two shots of my life,'' Torrance later
declared -- and that from a player whose three victories this season
brought his total in Europe to 21 and whose golf which brought him eight
other finishes in the first 10 was accurately predicted by his father
Bob, the celebrated coach, to develop its fullest potential after Sam's
fortieth birthday.
All credit, however, to Cejka, who recovered from a miserable outward
half of 38 with a determination and ability which suggested that he will
become a considerable force to be reckoned with.
Certainly Cejka finished off his round with a flourish, a No.6-iron
shot to nine feet closing the door firmly on Montgomerie.

THE European opponents of Rangers and Raith Rovers had vastly
contrasting fortunes at the weekend, with Italian champions Juventus
slumping to a heavy defeat yesterday, while German giants Bayern Munich
won an eight-goal thriller on Saturday.
Juventus, who play Rangers in a Champions' League match at Ibrox on
Wednesday, suffered a humiliating 4-0 defeat to Lazio in Rome.
Two goals from Pierluigi Casiraghi plus one apiece from Giuseppe
Signori and Roberto Rambaudi sealed Juve's second defeat in less than a
week after last Wednesday's shock Italian Cup exit at Atalanta.
Although Ciro Ferrara, Fabrizio Ravanelli, and Gianluca Vialli --
returning from a month's lay-off through injury -- all struck the
woodwork, the champions were clearly below their best ahead of their
trip to Ibrox. ''A completely negative performance,'' said manager
Marcello Lippi. ''We looked down and out.''
Bayern, who meet Raith in the UEFA Cup in Munich tomorrow holding a
2-0 first leg lead, cast aside a week of squabbling with a dramatic 5-3
defeat of former champions VfB Stuttgart to keep their three-point lead
at the top of the German first division.
The Germans, whose preparations were overshadowed by comments from
chairman Franz Beckenbauer and coach Otto Rehhagel, gave away a 3-0 lead
before sealing the match with late goals from Alex Zickler and Mehmet
Scholl.
Reigning champions Borussia Dortmund, who also are in Rangers' group,
left it even later, Michael Zorc hitting a last-minute winner in a 2-1
victory at Schalke.
Bayern have been through a controversial time after former World
Cup-winning captain and coach Beckenbauer compared their last
performance to that of a ''school team''.
''With a 3-0 lead we should lock out our opponents, not let them get
back into the match,'' Rehhagel said.
Celtic's opponents in the European Cup-Winners Cup, Paris St Germain,
had a free weekend after defeating surprise French league leaders Metz
3-0 on Thursday.

SLUDGE disposal may be a headache in many parts of the country but in
Dumfries and Galloway it is bringing benefits to the farming industry.
Millions of tons of sludge are being injected into farmlands, cutting
costs for the farmers and getting rid of the by-product in an
environmentally friendly way.
Dumfries and Galloway water and sewerage department is among leaders
in the field of using sludge as a valuable organic manure which is
helping farmers to reduce their fertiliser costs and improve the
fertility of their soils.
Already this year 14 million gallons of undigested sewage sludge has
been injected into the land in Dumfriesshire and the Stewartry.
It is also removing the millions of tons of undigested sewage sludge
which would normally fill the huge lagoons at Laurieston and Lochar
Moss, near Dumfries, and transferring it back to the land.
Within the next couple of years the normal process of dumping sludge
at sea, practised by many authorities throughout the country, will have
been outlawed and replaced by new ways such as are being practised in
the South-west and in Tayside.
Sewage sludge is the natural by-product of sewage treatment works and
is a valuable organic manure supplied free to farmers. It can help
reduce their bills and improve the fertility of soils.
It contains nitrogen, phosphorous, organic matter and lime but only
small quantities of potassium and trace elements.
Dumfries and Galloway has been at the forefront of this pioneering way
to dispose of sludge, which is not the horrible mess that people come to
expect from the name. Several years ago it was spread on the land but
now it is injected using special equipment to a depth of seven inches.
Mr Eric Slaven, in charge of the operation from the department's
headquarters in Marchmount, Dumfries, says: ''Many people have the wrong
idea about sludge and what we are putting on the land. It is the
by-product of sewage treatments in the region.
''As well as benefiting farmers, it gets rid of the huge amounts of
sludge left over each year. Our lagoons at Dumfries and Laurieston are
almost empty and we are working flat out to keep up with demand from the
farmers.''
Already the demand has been such that newcomers will have to go into
landbank and wait their turn. So far farms in the Langholm, Annan,
Lockerbie, Dumfries, Southerness, Dalbeattie, and Castle Douglas areas
have received the sludge which is injected by a special contracting
firm, Copland Environmental Services, based at Perth.
The firm is brought in by the region under contract to carry out the
work with special equipment. The sludge is brought by the company's and
regional council tankers from the sewage treatment works. The firm moves
in with a large storage tank to the farm it is working on and the sludge
is pumped through pipes to the tractor which injects it into the land at
the rate of about 12,000 gallons per acre.
Mr Slaven said: ''Sludge is a problem which has to be dealt with, and
we have found that this is an environmentally friendly way of getting
rid of it. We have not been in the habit of dumping it out to sea, but
we stored it in lagoons. Now they are empty and we have a tremendous
demand for the product which is of great benefit to the farmers.''
He added that everything about using the sludge is recorded and
monitored and regular tests are made to see that the process is carried
out safely and efficiently.
''Once we get a request from the farmer, we pass this on to the
company and tests are carried out on the land. We have to be careful
with the application and the conditions at the time. If there is a
watercourse nearby then extra care has to be taken.''
In a report prepared for the regional council's water and sewerage
committee, Dumfries and Galloway's director, Mr Charles Schooling, says
that sludge injection operations on agricultural land have continued at
farms at Amisfield, Torthorwald, Dalton, Brydekirk, Cummertrees, and
Islesteps and almost all sludge is being recycled directly to
agricultural land with no sludge stored in the refurbished lagoons at
Lochar Moss.
''Consequently the revenue budget allocation for sludge disposal will
be overspent if recycling of sludge continues at this rate and I will
report on the overspend at a future meeting.''

PETER Wright will still be considered for the Scotland side to play
Western Samoa at Murrayfield on November 18, despite being sent off in
Boroughmuir's premiership game at Gala on Saturday.
The Scotland selectors meet tonight to pick the side amid an
unprecedented backdrop of injuries to key players, but Wright's
dismissal, the continuing injury problems of Kevin McKenzie -- favourite
to succeed retired hooker Kenny Milne -- and a potential suspension
looming for Wright's fellow prop Alan Sharp means that the front row is
one area which is causing headaches.
Wright's dismissal came after 64 minutes at Netherdale. International
referee Ken McCartney said later that he had sent the Boroughmuir
captain off for ''misconduct'' and for conduct ''not within the spirit
of the game.''
Wright, who trained at Murrayfield yesterday with the national squad,
had been spoken to by McCartney several times before he received his
marching orders.
An early altercation between the prop and Gala's South African lock
Mathias Stoltz was repeated in 63 minutes, following a Wright ''try''
which was disallowed.
The referee spoke to Wright on both occasions, and when, with Wright
on the ground after a ruck, there was another exchange between player
and referee, Wright was ordered to go.
Yesterday, as SRU director of rugby Jim Telfer surveyed an injury list
which includes Gary Armstrong (wrist), Jim Hay (knee), Bryan Redpath
(hip), Craig Chalmers (shoulder), Tony Stanger (groin), David McIvor
(hamstring), Alan Sharp (groin) and, most seriously, Scott Hastings, who
was concussed for Watsonians on Saturday and is definitely out for three
weeks, he said that Wright would still eligible for consideration.
''Whether he is picked is another thing but he must be considered,
certainly.
''The situation with Alan Sharp, who received a second yellow card
playing for Bristol on Saturday, is a wee bit different. His County
disciplinary panel must now decide what is to be done with him,'' said
Telfer.
SRU chief executive Bill Hogg added that, so far as the Wright
situation was concerned, they would await the official report from
referee McCartney and, depending on whether or not the player requested
a disciplinary hearing, the matter could be dealt with in a matter of
days.
It is virtually certain that Wright, whose reputation --
euphemistically put -- is for being one of the game's great talkers,
will receive a suspension of some degree.
Anything more than three weeks will put him out of contention for the
Western Samoan Test.
With the exception of Scott Hastings, all of the aforementioned
casualties expect to be playing next weekend.
However, when one adds to the list longer-term injuries to the likes
of Andy Reed, Jeremy Richardson, Shade Munro, Alan Watt, Craig Joiner,
and Peter Walton, and those of hooking candidates Martin Scott and
McKenzie, both of whom should be playing within a fortnight, the
situation adds up to, if not a crisis, then certainly a drama of
Emergency Ward 10 proportions.
Telfer added: ''Yes, the injury situation does concern me, and
especially so when you consider that two or three weeks ago we didn't
have any injuries to speak of.
''Maybe we should be thinking anew about the number of league games
player are having to play early in the season.''
* THE SRU and representatives of the International Players' Trust met
at Murrayfield yesterday for continuing discussions which will lead to
the players being placed under contract in time for the Western Samoan
international.
Senior vice-president Fred McLeod said there would be a further
meeting of the SRU professionalism working party tonight when draft
contracts were likely to be on the table, and that it was envisaged that
a deal might have been struck within the week.

STEPHEN Hendry emerged victorious from the battle of the Scots in
Sunderland last night, taking the #60,000 Skoda Grand Prix winner's
cheque with a 9-5 victory over defending champion John Higgins.
But the world champion admitted after his first professional encounter
with Higgins: ''Today was a bit of an anti-climax. To be honest, I found
it somewhat awkward playing John. I know him so well, and meeting for
the first time in such an important occasion made it doubly difficult
for us.''
Neither found top gear, with Hendry's best effort of 88 coming in the
second half of the contest. He finished with a run of 73 in the
fourteenth frame to claim the title and a #5000 bonus for the highest
televised break, his 138 clearance during Saturday's semi-final with
Steve James.
''Stephen didn't play well,'' said 20-year-old Higgins, who failed to
emulate Hendry and Steve Davis as the only players to make successful
Grand Prix defences. ''But I was terrible.
''The match was a real struggle and because of that I didn't enjoy
something I was looking forward to. There is no way you can go out and
play so poorly and expect to beat someone like Stephen.''
Higgins, who also struggled in his semi-final victory over fellow Scot
and close friend Alan McManus, led only once in the match, taking the
fifth frame 75-55 to go 3-2 up.
But by the end of the first session, Hendry had moved 5-3 clear,
allowing the world No.11 just 13 points in the closing frames.
Although Higgins reduced the arrears when they resumed last night,
there was no holding the world champion. Crucially, Hendry snatched
frame 11 after having trailed 56-1 when Higgins was unfortunate to go
in-off.
Higgins cut the lead to 7-5 but Hendry took the last two frames by
100-8 and 117-0 to wrap up his twenty-third ranking title and
fifty-sixth trophy in all.

BILLY Mayfair survived tough conditions to win the season-ending US
Tour Championship in Tulsa, Oklahoma, yesterday.
Mayfair started the day with a three-shot lead, and no-one was able to
challenge him in strong winds which made birdies a rare commodity at
Southern Hills.
The former US Amateur champion needed only a three-over-par 73 on a
day when Scott Simpson's 69 was the lone sub-par score.
Nick Faldo, the lone European in the 30-man field, tied for
thirteenth, 11 strokes behind after a 70. Scores:
280 -- B Mayfair 68, 70, 69, 73.
283 -- C Pavin 72, 70, 68, 73; S Elkington (Australia) 71, 72, 67, 73.
284 -- S Simpson 71, 70, 74, 69; W Austin 71, 68, 73, 72.
285 -- V Singh (Fiji) 69, 71, 72, 73.
286 -- J Leonard 70, 70, 72, 74; B Bryant 69, 68, 73, 76.
287 -- G Norman (Australia) 72, 70, 74, 71; D Duval 74, 69, 71, 73.
288 -- L Roberts 73, 68, 74, 73.
290 -- T Lehman 71, 70, 73, 76.

By Dr Mike Kelly, SAC Building Design Unit, Auchincruive.
THE cubicle has evolved over many years as the most popular system for
housing the dairy cow. Good design allows a cow to lie clean and
undisturbed, with a minimal risk of injury. Bedding costs are minimal
compared with bedded courts, and sawdust or chopped straw are popular
bedding materials. Waste is handled as a slurry, stored below slats, or
in above ground tanks.
Research has indicated that cubicles with good head lunging space are
preferred by cows over more conventional designs. However, it is
important to get division dimensions right in relation to bed size. This
will avoid instances whereby excessive freedom causes dirty beds or
injury by trapping. Alternatively restrictive divisions will not
encourage cubicle use.
Cubicle beds should slope from front to back by 5cm to 7.5cm to assist
in keeping cows dry and clean. The dimensions of the step into the
cubicle bed depends on the scraping system. For tractor scraping the
step should be 25cm, for automatic scraping the step can be below 20cm
and a step of 15cm is adequate from slats.
A pronounced kerb at the back of the cubicle is no longer recommended
as this can cause hock damage. A small lip may help in retaining bedding
but the vast majority of beds are now laid without any form of lip.
Comfort is provided by a combination of a cushioned floor and retained
bedding.
Recent work in the US has looked at rubber-filled mattresses as a
means of providing additional comfort. Construction comprises of a tough
woven nylon fabric covering filled with shredded rubber. Although costs
are higher than rubber mats the increased comfort may justify it.
Durability trials suggest a five-year life span.
Another bedding system involves bonding rubber particles to the cow
bed as a rubber screed. The rubber then forms a cushioned floor which
gives good low comfort, with minimum risk of injury.
Many of these techniques are being tried out by Scottish farmers who
are concerned about providing their cows with a comfortable yet durable
lying area. Comfort and a high degree of durability are not easy to
attain in practice.
To answer questions posed by these new products, SAC is holding a
meeting, Improving Cow Comfort in Cubicles, on Monday November 6 at
Auchincruive, Ayr. A range of cubicle finishes from mats to rubber
screeds to mattresses will be discussed, and examples of each can be
seen on the farms visited. The meeting starts at 10.10am and is geared
for farmers, and anyone interested in the welfare of the dairy cow.
Please phone Margaret Fagan, Building Design Unit, on (01292) 520331 or
FAX (01292) 520191 for details. Anyone with dairy cows should be
interested in this meeting.

I FIND it difficult to equate the stance of Mr Alan Montgomery,
Cumnock and Doon Valley District planning officer, on the issue of
open-cast working (October 20) with those of his peers, namely
Strathclyde region's director of planning and Scottish Natural Heritage.
I trust that these organisations will ensure that he is brought up to
date with the thinking and national strategy on the protection of the
environment.
In Stonehouse we are presently faced by a twin threat of open-cast
projects in our area, which local residents are vigorously opposing. We
are supported by our MEP, MP, regional councillor, the district council,
and the community council. Two well-attended public meetings confirmed
our view of total opposition to these developments.
If the Secretary of State can veto the wishes of the local residents
and their representatives where is democracy?
Contrary to Mr Montgomery's view that open-cast working brings jobs,
our experience of sites in adjoining villages shows clearly that the
promised jobs did not materialise, except for one or two low-paid
labouring or catering jobs.
While millions of pounds' worth of coal were extracted not a penny
went to the area where the despoilation took place.
Perhaps we should learn from the Shetlands where at least in the
beginning of the oil boom they were able to extract a percentage of the
revenue to benefit the local community.
I would challenge Mr Montgomery to produce figures to show any
substantial figures of jobs created for local residents in any open-cast
development in Scotland. He may be, of course, referring to the
increased workload for medical staff in local hospitals and clinics
dealing with the incidence of asthma and other dust-related diseases.
The choice depicted by Mr Montgomery of jobs or environment is a false
one. If we want properly to conserve energy resources for this and
future generations, why not sink or reopen pits, go to the bottom seams,
and work them out fully, then work towards the surface?
This would create many more jobs, make better use of the resources
available and protect the overall environment.
Mr Montgomery's attitude gives me great cause for concern, considering
his position in which he can influence decisions that could damage our
environment.
Nowhere in his defence of open-cast working does he mention the loss
of jobs to local communities. If you create a lifeless wilderness, you
lose tourist opportunities, the local economy suffers, hotels close,
shops lose trade, and businesses struggle. Past evidence is there to
verify this.
I would have thought in an area of such beauty as Ayrshire this would
have been self-evident.

PILLANS &amp; Wilson, the Edinburgh financial printers, has made more
progress in the past four years than the previous 216.
In 1991 when Bob Hodgson and Graham Bowstead bought the company it was
a subsidiary of the ailing Colorgraphic Group, and was managed from
Leicester.
Since then Pillans &amp; Wilson, founded in 1775, has purchased FPC
International in 1991 and this summer bought Greenaway Harrison from the
Lonrho Group for #2.4m.
The latest acquisition means that the enlarged company is the largest
printer of company annual reports in the United Kingdom with 400 plus
customers.
Combined turnover of the company this year will be in the region of
#27.5m, almost evenly divided between the Pillans and Greenaway ends of
the business.
The company has now been organised into three groupings, with the
London printing operation being renamed Pillans &amp; Wilson Greenaway while
FPC International becomes FPC Greenaway Corporate and the Edinburgh
operation Pillans &amp; Wilson Greenaway Scotland.
Managing director Bob Hodgson, however, stresses that the overall
control of the group will remain in Scotland.
The Greenaway purchase puts them in the major league of financial
printers, and will allow them to bid for any future privitisation
documentation.
''Until now we were not big enough to handle such contracts,''
explained Bob Hodgson, ''but we will be going after this work in the
future.''
Pillans &amp; Wilson will also be looking to increase its already
substantial annual reports business which he says has benefited from the
increased pagination required to meet the additional disclosure
companies now have to make.
The enlarged company will also be turning its eyes towards Europe
following the results of a survey they commissioned from Strathclyde
University.
''The survey showed that the services we offer in the UK are not so
well developed, and we will be looking to develop our business in
Europe. Our first market will remain the UK, and there is still a lot to
be gained in this market but we will be looking closely at the
multi-national companies in Europe,'' said Bob Hodgson.

I WAS disappointed at the article, Snarl-up over city centre ban on
private taxis, by Jack McLean (October 23). The coverage of the
treatment of private hire cars in the Glasgow City Centre Millennium
Plan transport strategy is ill-informed, out-of-date, and misrepresented
Strathclyde Regional Council.
Strathclyde Roads carried out a major public consultation exercise on
the transport strategy proposals which included discussions with the
Greater Glasgow Private Hire Association.
Following the public consultation, the regional council's roads and
transportation committee approved a revised transport strategy on
October 12, 1995.
It was recommended that the Traffic Regulation Orders for ''bus''
links and ''bus'' lanes should be promoted permitting access for private
hire cars providing that suitable additional livery identification can
be agreed with the private hire car operators, the licensing authority
(Glasgow District Council), and the Chief Constable, and that their
operation be closely monitored.
Other permitted vehicles in ''bus'' lanes and ''bus'' links would be
buses, taxis, and cycles.
John MacCalman reported in The Herald the revisions of the broad
strategy of the Millennium Plan (October 13).
This department has had useful and constructive discussions with
representatives of the taxi and private hire car operators. It is
misleading for The Herald to publish an article by Jack McLean using
out-of-date information to highlight proposals to ban private hire cars
and quoting selected extracts from initial correspondence.
The up-to-date situation was obviously not checked prior to the
publication of the article.

SNP Councillor Campbell Martin is somewhat premature in declaring that
the Labour Party is no longer a place for socialists (October 23).
His assertion that the SNP is the only socialist party in Scotland
will also no doubt come as a surprise to some of his own colleagues,
never mind Tommy Sheridan et al.
The Labour Party has always been a broad church. As with any healthy
democratic party there are bound to be differences of opinion.
The things that unite us, however, far outweigh those which divide us.
We won't let petty sniping from opponents distract us from our common
objective of defeating the Tory Government and beginning the process of
building a more just society.

HAVING seen my business premises under three feet of water in December
last year, and with the memory of the resulting devastation followed by
months of disruption still fresh in my mind, I watched with mounting
horror the rising level of the Kilmarnock Water throughout the day on
Thursday of last week.
My company's premises are situated on the junction of East Shaw Street
and Bentinck Street with the river some 30 to 40 metres away on the far
side of a brick retaining wall. Since the flooding in December 1994
occurred on a Saturday night I was not present when the river actually
breached its banks. This time therefore I made a point of spending some
time observing the retaining wall and the banks of the river very
carefully.
The most immediate obvious fact was that the wall was in a state of
some considerable disrepair, at one point almost completely down to
ground level. As the level of water in the river rose it seemed apparent
that this was going to be the point at which it would breach.
However, not long before it reached this level, the first water
started to escape, not over the broken wall but under the (subsequently
to be observed very flimsy) foundations. An hour or so later it reached
the level of the top of the broken wall and started to flow over at this
point also.
To my knowledge these were the only two points at which the river
breached to cause a repeat of the flooding to my company's premises.
When my fellow director, staff and I stood helpless, watching the
floodwater start to move into the newly refurbished ground-floor
showroom and offices, with the water level already 10 inches deep in the
stores and workshop, we could watch no more so we locked up and waded
home wondering how deep it would get this time.
As we discovered on Friday morning, it had risen a further three to
four inches before receding.
It was with some degree of disbelief and frustration that I read the
reports in The Herald on October 28 of all and any potentially
responsible parties firmly pointing the finger at each other. Even more
so when I read of the many millions of pounds deemed necessary to
rectify the problem.
I would estimate that the immediate problem in the East Shaw
Street/Bentinck Street area could be rectified next week for not much
more than #1000.
Whether this could also be the case in other areas I do not know.
However, it is apparent that no attempt whatsoever has been made since
the devastating floods of last year to identify and rectify the problem.
I am not suggesting that this type of small-scale maintenance and
repair to riverbanks and retaining walls is the long-term answer but
there is no doubt it would alleviate the problem for the businesses and
residents who suffer while the regional council, district council, new
unitary authority, Scottish Office, river purification board, et al
bicker about who is responsible.

JOHN R Stephen continues to be the only advocate of the Sheehy
Report's nonsensical recommendations on the police (October 25).
First, the Royal Commission of the early 1960s did not remove police
pay from the overtime-reliant position but simply raised it back to a
level from which it had drastically slipped.
As to his contention that the police salary has been at the front of
the public utilities ever since, this is untrue. Had the salary levels
been in such a favoured position the troubles of the early 1970s and the
necessity of the Edmund Davies Inquiry would have been avoided.
To say that the police always receive more than they beg for simply
shows that Mr Stephen is unaware of events at the Police Negotiating
Board since 1990. Indeed Mr Stephen is sadly out of touch with modern
policing.
Nowhere does this show more than in his comments regarding crowd
disorder at a boxing event. Yes, there was serious drunken hooliganism
evident, but this took place within a hotel and not in a public forum.
Entry was as restricted as in any other licensed premises. It is not
the duty of the police to attend and steward every function taking place
on licensed premises. Police presence at football and other sporting
events is partly paid for by the organisers and is at their request.
The organisers of the boxing event undoubtedly saw no need for a
police presence and were let down by some of the audience.
To suggest, as John R Stephen does, that the police who attended did
so from the comfort of office chairs illustrates better than anything
that he knows little of policing in Glasgow in the present day. He may
have spent a lot of his police service in such a comfortable position;
the officers who attended at the incident have little opportunity for
such splendid inactivity.
One last point: when was standing up at a boxing match ever an
offence?

BRIAN Meek is always both readable and humorous and is the kind of

entertaining.
But I, and I am sure some others, would like to know who left the case

READING Julie Davidson's attack on some charities' efforts at
marketing I was left with the impression that much of the validity of
some of her initial points regarding so called hard-hitting techniques
used occasionally by charities was lost due to the cynical analysis
which followed them and, particularly, the cheap jibe which rounded off
the piece (October 20).
While I can agree to a great extent with her views on the need for
charities to be ever-vigilant and acutely conscious of the images and
messages employed to promote their work and secure the public's support
for their chosen area of involvement, to make statements such as ''the
charitable donation is a kind of sleep-easier tax'' is to devalue and
rubbish the genuine concern for issues of justice inherent in much of
charitable work by the agencies themselves and their supporters.
In the case of SCIAF, Scotland's largest independent aid agency, this
concern is shown daily by people of all socio-economic backgrounds who
not only provide the agency with the means to fund projects abroad (just
under #2m in 1994) but also to raise awareness of the causes of poverty
and injustice through educatonal work and campaigns, many of them
jointly with Christian Aid and Oxfam in Scotland.
My principal objection, however, is reserved for her concluding
remarks on the issue of salaries for charity staff which imply that one
of the factors for not contributing to them is the supposedly high
salaries we earn.
All data available point to the fact that senior charity managers earn
significantly less than their equivalents in the real world.
In addition, organisations engaged in the promotion of the dignity of
the human person cannot but pay fair wages to staff members with
considerable responsibility, experience, and qualifications who work
very long hours, evenings and weekends when required, and have a
personal commitment to the work.
I would like to argue that the challenges of post-modern society
demand from charities a high degree of professionalism, a growing and
sophisticated understanding of the media, and appropriate methods of
promoting their work while informing supporters of the way in which
their money is spent.
Suggesting that people give funds to charities in order to sleep
better at night and that charitable organisations should be run by
volunteers flies in the face of reality and does nothing to advance the
case for accountability and transparency, on the one hand, and for
dignified, objective, and true representation of images in campaigning
on the other.

I NOTE the considerable correspondence regarding air fares between
Glasgow and London (October 26).
I required to spend a day in London on business and approached my
travel agent in Ayr. The walls of the office were festooned with
posters, ''Fly Prestwick (Glasgow) to London (Stansted), from #59''.
I asked if I could book a flight travelling to London in the morning
and returning in the late afternoon for #59.
I was informed that the operative word on the poster was ''from'' and
that to enjoy the air fare of #59 return required two nights' stay in
London, entailing no doubt a further outlay of something like #200 in
hotel bills, quite apart from the oncost of rapacious London taxi
drivers.
The suggestion by Ryanair of cheap flights, Prestwick/London, for #59
is really a myth. Because of the proximity of Prestwick Airport to my
home I eventually booked on the Prestwick-Stansted flight, going and
returning the same day.
The price involved, including airport tax, was #194, which is more or
less the same as British Midland or British Airways Apex fares.
The Ryanair flight has ''no frills'', so that no refreshments are
served on the flight or any other extras.
It appears to me that British Midland and British Airways are quite as
competitive as Ryanair, unless one stays for two nights in London, with
relatives, free of charge.

YELLOW cabs blared down the canyons of concrete and glass,
horse-carriages ambled through the falling leaves of Central Park,
Broadway buzzed and, in the warmth of an October day, I knew from the
spring in my step that I was back in a favourite city.
New York, New York -- so good they could have named it a thousand
times. Of course it is also the paradox which can stir such dislike in
many a civilised soul that they cannot escape its confines soon enough.
I just happen to be a sucker for its charm.
And charm tells you everything about the University Club of New York,
one of the city's most fabulous listed buildings, all wood panelling and
marble pillars reaching to heavenly heights, with a library of
breathtaking proportions.
In the spacious drawing room, gentlemen read their Wall Street
Journal, fully approving a notice which says ''Quiet please!'' -- as
they look out on Fifth Avenue, one of the world's noisiest
thoroughfares! New York keeps its sense of humour.
My engagement at the University Club (it welcomes graduates from all
over the world) was to address the American-Scottish Foundation, an
interesting body which not only promotes good relations between our
countries but offers practical support to ventures this side of the
ocean.
Alan Bain is its president, an influential lawyer-cum-businessman with
his base on Madison Avenue, a Dundee jute man's son who read law at
Cambridge where he became a firm friend of Calum Bannerman, son of that
great Scot, John M.
In the audience that evening was a fascinating cross-section of those
who fly the Saltire across the States. People like Deirdre Livingstone
from Argyll, combining a professional post of encouraging travel to
Scotland with a passionate desire to help her homeland.
Deirdre, incidentally, is writing a book about her grandfather, a
relative of David Livingstone, who went to Africa to run the estate of
the explorer's daughter and ended up by being murdered.
The spectre of assassination was closer at hand as I returned to the
Plaza Hotel to find it crawling with security men. Had I forgotten that
New York was playing host to the biggest-ever collection of world
leaders, gathered to mark the 50th anniversary of the United Nations?
With no embassies in New York, four main hotels were helping to house
the dignitaries, who ranged from Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin to Fidel
Castro and Yasser Arafat.
The King of Morocco was sleeping two floors below my room, having
taken over a considerable part of the hotel. With gun-totin' guards at
every bend of the corridors, it seemed there were security men to watch
security men.
No chances were being taken with revolutionary groups, including
Algerians, who had threatened trouble.
Down at the Palace Hotel on Madison you found yourself pursued by
sniffer dogs, preparing for the world's richest man, the Sultan of
Brunei, who also happened to own the place.
Back at the Plaza (Donald Trump's former pride and joy), my lady
companions came upon Queen Noor of Jordan having her hair done. Then, as
we walked into the evening air, along Central Park South, a familiar
frame ambled across the sidewalk from his hotel door to a stretch
limousine, easing himself into the luxurious seat with some difficulty.
''Luciano!'' we exclaimed in unison. Yes, it was indeed Pavarotti, who
acknowledged the spontaneous greeting. New York is just that kind of
town, stirring the adrenalin as no other place I know; a name-droppers'
dream -- but oh, what names to drop.
Down Broadway the lights were dancing their way to Times Square,
proclaiming a revival of Jerome Kern's Showboat and yet another revival
of Jerry Herman's Hello Dolly, this time starring Carol Channing.
Now it was time to hurry back to the hotel for a face-to-face
interview with Mary Ryan of Cable Television, a 30-minute programme
which went out last Tuesday night.
New York, in all its sultry attraction, leaves you pleasantly
breathless with excitement. Before leaving for home, however, there is
one sombre call I always try to make. It takes me up the west side of
Central Park to that block of luxury apartments known as the Dakota
Building.
It was there I passed, out of curiosity, one early winter's day of
1980, having gone to America for the presidential election which put
Ronald Reagan into the White House. That curiosity was to see the home
of John Lennon, who had found such peace, privacy, and apparent safety
in the bustle of New York.
I was scarcely home when I heard the newsflash which shocked the
world. Lennon had been shot dead by a young fan at that very entrance
where I had stood so recently.
Last week I stood again on that sidewalk spot from which the assassin
fired the gun, and tried to reconstruct those ghastly moments which
ended Lennon's life.
Across the street, in Central Park, they have laid out a garden of
peace, appropriately named Strawberry Fields, through which the people
pass in respectful silence, pausing to glance at the memorial plaque.
I remembered my favourite Beatles tune, The Long and Winding Road --
and prepared to take it, homeward to Scotland. But knowing always that I
would be returning at the first opportunity to this city which John
Lennon, and so many more of us, had come to love.

JIM Kean relies on an unusual economic indicator to tell him that
industrial and commercial activity is on the increase -- the sale of
vending machines.
''As more companies introduce night shifts and mid shifts into their
factories they come to us for vending machines as their canteens are
closed,'' explained Jim Kean who runs Vendcare's Scottish operation from
Cumbernauld.
And the signs are that Scotland's economy is on the move says Kean as
his company instal more vending machines in factories which has brought
about a 20% upturn in profits this year.
Sixteen months ago Jim Kean and his management colleagues at Vendcare
bought the company out from the GKN Group, and they have not looked back
since.
''We are a stand alone unit in Scotland,'' said Kean, ''and are a
profit centre in our own right. We have the best of both worlds. We
operate as a local company but have national back up.''
Vending machines are becoming more popular, and Vendcare have a site
in an office where there are five machines which between them issue
70,000 drinks a month.
''The company who installed these machines look upon them as a staff
benefit, and all drinks are free.''
Coffee remains by far the most popular drink from vending machines,
says Jim Kean.
It accounts for 65% of all drinks purchased from vending machines.
''This is partly because until recently tea from vending machines was
poor quality,'' admitted Kean, ''when it was made from granulated
grains, but most tea in vending machines is now free leaf.''
Jim Kean expects his Scottish operation to experience a big expansion
in 1996 and is anticipating a 25% growth in the business.
''This business was in pretty poor shape when I arrived here just over
two years ago,'' he explained.
The company recently became the first vending machine company to
achieve the Investors in People Award and are also the first in the
industry to be given the Silver Seal by the Royal Institute of Public
Health.
''Food safety is very important for us, and our operators are trained
to NVQ standards.''
New health and safety regulations could see the demise of the
traditional kettle point where staff in small offices made their morning
cuppa tea, and Jim Kean believes that this will mean a growth in demand
for table top machines which have a smaller capacity, and designed for
the smaller workplace.

THE recent letters regarding air fares are of particular interest to
my family in that when we wish to fly from Glasgow (Paisley) to East
Midlands we have absolutely no choice of airline.
British Midland makes full use of this monopoly and its fares in my
opinion are exorbitant for what is usually a 50-minute flight.
The full return fare returning the same day is #213; if one books two
weeks in advance there are a limited number of seats at #115 return (not
returning the same day). Again ''subject to availability'' they offer a
#75 return, but in the usual way one must stay over a Saturday.
My hope is that in the near future there will be some competition on
this route.
Incidentally, I have over the years wondered where all the Glasgow
businessmen went to who were so anxious to fly from Glasgow direct to
the United States. I seem to remember that this was their reason for
wanting Prestwick's ''International Gateway'' moved to Glasgow.

IT IS difficult to understand what persuaded Ms Clare Short to air her
opinions in public on the alleged benefits of considering the
legalisation of soft drugs. Sir David Frost is a skilled interviewer but
Ms Short is an experienced, able, and strong-minded politician. She was
not led into an indiscretion but appeared to volunteer herself for it
gladly, and if she does not regret it there is no doubt that the Labour
Party, and Mr Tony Blair in particular, will. It is no surprise that she
holds controversial beliefs on this subject; she is already on record as
one of a number of MPs who believe that there is a case for examining
legislation on drugs. It is not, however, Ms Short's speciality. She is
at the very beginning of a spell as Shadow Transport Secretary with
heavy responsibilities in a sector of national life which is of great
importance for the future. In an area of policy in which the Government
is floundering badly there is no doubt that Ms Short would have had
opportunity to fill her interview adequately with some of the many
essential points which need to be made on that subject. Why she should
allow herself to stray on to the issue of drugs is a question which only
she can answer.
To emphasise this is not to suggest that shadow portfolio holders
should concern themselves solely with their own particular subject.
Nevertheless, after a turbulent career in and out of shadow office she
appeared to have settled her differences with the Labour leadership in
recent months, even to the extent of delivering a substantial and
effective speech in support of the decision to stop the selection as
parliamentary candidate of a notably left-wing woman. This was followed
by Ms Short's election to the Shadow Cabinet for the first time. Her
long service, her intelligence, and her gritty determination to pursue
issues make her elevation to the Shadow Cabinet a reasonable and
sensible judgment. Unfortunately the silliness over the issue of drugs
must raise questions about her suitability for high office.
Some serious points proceed from this affair. The first is the
importance to the Labour Party of making its position on a variety of
issues more clear. We should, of course, expect a Shadow Cabinet member
to know that Labour policy is against the legalisation of cannabis and
other so-called soft drugs, even if he or she insists on peddling their
private views, but the effect of these private opinions would be
lessened if there was a wider understanding of Labour's position on the
issue. It is also clear that discipline within the new Shadow Cabinet is
not all that it could or should be. Ms Short was happy to reveal that
she will also defy Mr Blair on the ridiculous question of all-women
short lists. Apart from being an insult to women, this argument does
little for Labour's chances of election. Ms Short will have to comply
with policy in a manner befitting a senior politician or consider
leaving the Shadow Cabinet.

ABOUT five million voters will decide today whether to begin the
destruction of the Canadian Union. The mainly French-descended and
French-speaking population of the province of Quebec will vote in a
referendum to decide if their homeland should become ''sovereign''. That
word is not entirely clear in this context -- those campaigning for
''yes'' believed at first that it was compatible with a continuing
partnership, including a common currency, with the rest of Canada.
Supporters of ''no'' believe that what is implied is separation and an
independent Quebec, a notion which has been accepted, if gradually in
some cases, by the coalition of French Canadian political groups leading
the demand for change. Although the separatists want to begin immediate
negotiations for the future relationship between the two new entities,
the reaction of other Canadians to a ''yes'' vote will not be benign,
they will not be ''understanding'', or accommodating, especially
concerning the distribution of Canada's enormous national debt.
The outcome will be close, according to opinion polls; and support for
the ''yes'' camp is thought to have hardened significantly in the past
few weeks. Major constitutional change of this order is seldom dependent
on simple majorities; most written constitutions require at least
two-thirds majorities to affect a change in their own provisions. The
argument being that opinion is fickle and constitutions as
quasi-permanent arrangements need a large body of agreed opinion to
ensure their operation over time and the changing circumstances it will
encounter. In this case, however, a simple majority is assumed to be
enough. In fact previous referendums have shown substantial majorities
for the status quo, but opinion among French Canadians has been moving
steadily towards separation. Only a last-minute fear of the economic
consequences -- which could be dire for Quebec -- will prompt a change,
and in the nature of things that will occur only in the polling booth.
From the outside, Canada has many of the features of a model state,
successfully integrating its French and English-speaking communities
with new immigrants from Asia (particularly in British Columbia) and
Eastern Europe along with the earlier populations, the North American
Indian and Inuit (Eskimo) peoples. In reality French Canada has never
completely accepted its inclusion in what was at first a British colony
and then a mainly British state. From the conquest of French Canada in
1759 the British conceded complete cultural, religious, and linguistic
freedom to the French, who enjoyed also the full political rights
accorded to all Canadians when their independence of the United Kingdom
was made explicit in 1867. Before and after that date there was always a
French minority which could not be reconciled to the wider union, and
this alienation has steadily spread in spite of many concessions to
French sentiment in Quebec. The latest situation is therefore novel only
in its degree, and entitled to be called a crisis only because its
outcome is at once uncertain and momentous.
Separation is bound to throw into question the independent existence
of English-speaking Canada, all, or part, of which might be expected to
gravitate towards the United States. It will provoke an intense debate
about the division of Canada's enormous debt, and expose Quebec's
precarious financial position, as well as raising in acute form the
question of Indian and Inuit rights, including their possible rights of
secession from Quebec, in the vast territories of the north of the
province. There may also be immediate financial consequences -- some of
which were given a first run last week -- which are bound to have a
massive negative impact on the Canadian dollar and on any new currency
which might have to be called into being for Quebec, whose government
would have no say in the currency's management. In the light of problems
of that nature, no-one can be sure how the non-French elements in the
south of the province would react. Some certainly would leave, though
such a movement would need time to acquire a momentum which would be
financially damaging to the extent that it involved more than a few
persons.

RICHARD Bissland and his partner in the 999 Design Group, Bill
Gaughan, are proud of the #1m they bring into the Scottish economy from
other parts of the United Kingdom and Europe.
''This income goes directly to Scottish printers, reprocompanies and
photographers, said Richard Bissland, ''and together we prove that we
can provide a top quality service from Glasgow.''
Earlier this year the design company completed work on Reebok
International's 1996 catalogue which has been distributed throughout
Europe in six languages.
999 Design took a team of Scottish designers and photographers to San
Diego in California to shoot the leisure and footwear company's
catalogue.
The company has come a long way since 1982 when Bissland and Gaughan
performed a management buyout of 202 Design, at that time part of the
Rex Group.
''I don't really know why we chose 999, but although we took the
existing contracts we were not allowed to use the 202 Design title, but
we were obviously into numbers,'' said Richard Bissland.
Turnover last year was #1.85m, and this year will pass the #2m mark
with more than 50% of this turnover coming from clients based outside
Scotland.
Among their leading clients is the Manchester based CWS Retail Group
for whom 999 Design is carrying out a series of ''customer loyalty''
promotions throughout the UK.
The company is now planning to open a Manchester office to service
their clients in this area.
Among their latest clients is UBH, a specialist German computer
company who have engaged 999 Design to produce corporate and technical
literature highlighting UBH's involvement in devising tailor-made
hardwear and softwear packages for international manufacturing
companies.

The Queen will today honour the 33 surviving holders of Britain's
highest military award, the Victoria Cross. Ian Bruce examines the
phenomenon of courage
THEY say courage cannot be measured. Auctioneers would dispute that.
The rate for bravery against the odds can range from #10,000 to more
than #100,000 for a Victoria Cross, Britain's highest military award.
The more spectacular the circumstances, the higher the price tag.
But what motivates a man to rise deliberately into harm's way, fully
aware of the possible consequences of his action, and charge an enemy?
Some would call it lunacy or folly. Others might term it glory-hunting
or the murderous rage born of fear.
There are, indisputably, many kinds of courage. Most such actions,
particularly in war, are performed in the heat of the moment. Few are
calculated. Many more go unnoticed. Unsung heroes will always outnumber
those singled out for gallantry.
Take John Imrie, a printer from Dundee. In 1914 he was caught up in
the patriotic rush to enlist as the guns of August began to sound in
faraway France. But the young man's hopes were dashed when he was told
he had varicose veins, and was therefore unsuitable material for the
fighting services.
Undaunted, he saved his meagre pay from the local firm of Harley and
Cox until he had raised enough cash to finance a then almost-unheard-of
private operation. When he had recuperated from surgery, he returned to
the recruiting office. This time he was informed that his scarred legs
still rendered him unfit for the infantry.
Refusing to be beaten, he asked if he would be accepted for any kind
of active service. Yes, he was told, but only with the unarmed Royal
Army Medical Corps.
Less than two years later, his illusions shattered by the horrific
reality of trench warfare, young Imrie crawled out into No-Man's-Land on
a shell-torn stretch of the Somme, making his way from crater to crater
through the churned-up mud of the battlefield towards two wounded Irish
Guardsmen.
Hauling one man at a time on his back, he made his painful way back to
British lines under constant fire. Halfway home with the second
casualty, his legs were shattered by shrapnel from a German airburst
shell which exploded almost directly above him.
He spent the rest of the war in and out of hospital, receiving
treatment for infected wounds which defied all medical efforts. John
Imrie was awarded the Military Medal. He lived until the age of 78. But
20 minutes of selflessness in Flanders Fields cost him dearly. The medal
was poor reward for legs which never healed completely.
Big Bill Speakman is still a legend in the British Army, as much for
his drinking capacity as for the VC he won on a November night in Korea
in 1951. He was not renowned as a model soldier. He had attained the
exalted rank of sergeant on at least two occasions. His fondness for the
bottle and for resisting almost inevitable arrest by the Military Police
had reduced him repeatedly back to the ranks.
Attached to the King's Own Scottish Borderers, he was with a company
headquarters detachment when he learned that waves of Chinese infantry
were on the point of overrunning their forward positions.
Big Bill collected half a dozen men and led his makeshift
counter-assault up a hill and into the surprised ranks of the Chinese,
hurling grenades among them as he ran. In all, he mounted 10 separate
charges through machine-gun and mortar fire.
Wounded in the leg by mortar fragments and out of grenades, he took
his thinning band uphill in a final assault, throwing empty beer bottles
in the absence of anything more lethal. Legend has it that he drank the
contents rather than waste it on the enemy. Miraculously, he survived,
holding the crest of the hill long enough to enable his comrades to
withdraw.
There are, however, many examples of courage verging on the insane, or
at best, the ill-advised. British military history is filled with Boys'
Own tales of stupidity masquerading as bravery.
Colonel ''H'' Jones, the commander of 2 Para in the Falklands, was
awarded the VC for an act of vainglorious suicide during the assault on
Darwin Hill in 1982. It was later claimed that his death, announced by
the emotive radio code message of ''Sunray is down'', galvanised his
stalled battalion and proved the turning point in the fight for Goose
Green.
That is nonsense. Most of his scattered men were unaware that he had
foolishly hurtled forward up a defended gully in best Hollywood
tradition. When he was promptly cut down by an Argentine machine-gunner,
it made no difference to the situation of the unit under his command,
apart from depriving them of their leader. In other circumstances that
could have been disastrous.
Corporals command sections of eight or nine men to storm enemy
positions. On the whole, they do it rather well, and with minimum
casualties. They are the professionals. Colonels are supposed to be the
managing directors of the business, staying well back from the front
line. Jones was hailed as a hero for propaganda purposes.
There is another category of hero so far unmentioned. In wartime, men
sometimes die bravely because there is no other choice. The handful of
South Wales Borderers who defended Rorke's Drift against a 4000-strong
Zulu army in 1879 won 11 VCs in a desperate and apparently hopeless last
stand.
If the Zulu had overrun their flimsy and makeshift fortress, there
would have been no witnesses and therefore no medals. Men fought out of
a sense of despair. If they had to fall in a battle which was none of
their choosing, they would take as many of the enemy as possible with
them.
Courage, in the end, is a complex phenomenon. People fight, and
occasionally fight well, out of fear, hate, love, desperation or
determination. As the moustachioed colour-sergeant in the film Zulu
responds with measured calm when asked by a frightened squaddie the
eternal ''why us?'' question -- ''Because we're here, laddie. Just us
and nobody else. Now cut along back to the ramparts with your mates.''

AS honeymoons go, it was a particularly short one. Clare Short could
only manage 11 days in Tony Blair's Shadow Cabinet before the more
excitable sections of the Conservative Party were baying for her
dismissal.
They need a bogeyman in Labour's senior ranks with which to scare the
wavering voters. It used to be Tony Benn. For others it was Neil
Kinnock. Now it is Clare Short. They will probably call her a
bogeyperson rather than a bogeyman, as they like nothing better than to
mimic what they see as her political correctness.
In fact, rather than defend political correctness, she sees the phrase
as hostile. ''Political correctness,'' she once said, ''is a concept
invented by hard right-wing forces to defend their right to be racist,
to treat women in a degrading way and to be truly vile about gay people.
They invent this idea of people who are politically correct, with a
rigid, monstrous attitude to life so they can attack them.''
And attack Clare Short they do. While she is a warm, witty, passionate
human being to her friends, she has a great capacity for getting under
the skin of both Conservative politicians and the right-wing tabloid
press.
Politicians get where they are because they have thick skins. Short's
has to be thicker than most after being universally ridiculed by the
tabloids and the Hooray Henry division of the Tory Party for twice
introducing Bills to ban Page 3 pin-ups from newspapers.
She was making the point that semi-naked pictures of women every day
trivialised and degraded women. Many Opposition MPs simply did not
listen, believing they were funny by describing the Bill as a Booby
Prize and other such obvious puns.
So she became known as a killjoy, and inevitably as a loony feminist.
Curiously though, she is not always bitter about her opponents. ''You
only have to look at the House of Commons where you get these terrible,
left-behind, gawky blokes who have never had an equal relationship with
women. Poor things. They behave in this ridiculous, Hooray Henry manner.
I mean, you don't want a country peopled by men like that when you could
get men who are used to working with women, who are more comfortable
with themselves and with the world,'' she once said.
She was also proving difficult, though, for her own party's hierarchy
to control. On the basis that it is better to have difficult people
inside your tent than outside, Short was twice given Shadow
responsibilities by Kinnock -- and twice resigned.
The first was in 1988 when she could not follow Labour's abstention
policy on the Prevention of Terrorism Act. She voted against, and quit
as a Labour employment spokesman.
She soon returned to speak on social security matters, but resigned
again in 1991, appalled at Labour being so supportive of the
Government's gung-ho line over the Gulf War.
Short's background was always one of speaking her mind, without being
too frightened of the consequences. A member of a large family of
brothers and sisters with an Irish background, she studied at Leeds
University before becoming a civil servant. She found that period
difficult and was unwilling to subsume her own beliefs. So she left to
work in community organisations dealing with race and urban deprivation.
She married a Labour MP, Alex Lyon, very much her senior in years, and
ironically when she was elected to Parliament Lyon lost his seat and for
a while became his wife's secretary.
That did not last, and although they separated they remained close. He
later died of Alzheimer's disease. They had no family.
Parliament did not subdue her outspokenness as it has done to so many.
Within months of entering she caused palpitations for the Speaker by
accusing then Conservative Minister Alan Clark of being drunk while
giving a statement to the House. Not the done thing at all, and she was
reprimanded.
In his diaries published years later, Clark agreed that he was
''muzzy'' on the day.
When a constituent complained about her estranged husband taking their
13-year-old daughter to Germany, Short went for the direct approach, and
simply drove the woman to Germany to snatch her daughter back.
But people grow older. Firebrands can often lose their heat. So at the
age of 49, the MP for Birmingham Ladywood for the past 12 years may have
been expected to have mellowed when she was elected to the Shadow
Cabinet for the first time this month.
There were indications that she had. Her defence of Clause 4 weakened.
She had changed her mind on unilateral disarmament. And she shocked many
on the left of the party by speaking in favour at Labour's annual
conference of removing Liz Davies as a Labour candidate. She explains
her position by saying that ideas are not petrified forever.
Nonetheless, that resoluteness which made her resign twice before is
something that the Conservatives will continue to poke a stick at in the
hope of goading her into indiscretion.
''If I have to be calculating about what I say, I will cease to be a
proper human being,'' she once said.
Calculating about what you say, however, is what you have to be if you
are to avoid being the Conservatives' bogeyperson. Clare Short will now
have to make up her mind whether being in the Shadow Cabinet is worth
that sacrifice.

ELECTRA Fleming is acquiring the Personnel Hygiene Services washroom
services group for #42.9m and a contingent note loan of up to #7m on
behalf of institutional clients.
PHS has some 47,000 customers in the UK which it supplies with
hygiene, washroom equipment, and sanitary disposal facilities and also
air filtering, freshening, and dust mats.
It achieved an operating profit of #4.09m in the year to March 1995 on
turnover of #29m. It has 21 depots in the UK and is seeking to expand
overseas and already has 51% of Personnel Hygiene Services in the US.
As a significant proportion of the market is in the hands of local
operators, PHS is in a a strong position to make acquisitions with the
backing of Electra Fleming.
That itself was set up in July when merchant bankers Robert Fleming
paid #29.5m for a half share in Electra Kingsway, the investment
management company that manages the Electra Investment Trust which is a
major investor in private companies. One advantage of the deal is that
the new company now has the ability to underwrite deals with an equity
element of up to #150m.

Blair Jenkins argues that Scottish Television provides both quality
and diversity in pursuit of the widest audience
THERE is no denying that Scottish Television is a commercial
broadcaster. I suppose those advertisements between the programmes are a
giveaway. But it is precisely because we are funded by advertising
revenue that we could not afford to be the sort of station described by
Allan Laing in Tuesday's Herald.
According to his caricature, Scottish Television is about ''cheap,
low-brow, populist telly for the masses''.
Leaving aside what looks like an undercurrent of distaste for this
particular audience, Mr Laing's perception of our ambitions and our
viewership is inaccurate.
Scottish secures a significantly higher share of ABC1s (industry
jargon for upmarket viewers) than any other channel in central Scotland.
In fact, our share of the ABC1 audience is one of the highest of any of
the 15 ITV regions in the UK.
There is a very sound commercial reason for Scottish being one of the
most upmarket stations in ITV. Most of the significant advertisers
(particularly in the growth categories) are interested in placing their
products before ABC1 viewers.
It is interesting, therefore, that the two programmes Allan Laing
cites as exemplifying our downmarket tendencies are among our very best
performers when it comes to attracting those elusive younger and more
affluent viewers.
A Game of Two Halves was averaging 43% of all ABC1 viewers at 10.30pm
on Thursdays. This is not bad going in a four-channel fight; even more
impressive when you consider that one in five homes now has rather more
than four choices. The series also averaged a 61% share of 16 to
24-year-old viewing. In fact, one edition in August actually got close
to an astonishing 90% share of this target group.
And then there's Late Edition, which Mr Laing finds ''inane'' and
''tasteless.'' Frustratingly, it turns out that this show is even more
popular with upmarket Scots -- the ABC1 share is 49%. I guess that's the
trouble with the middle and professional classes; they will insist on
watching what they enjoy rather than what broadsheet theorists think is
good for them.
Television is different from newspapers, but the distinction has
always seemed to be a difficult one for print journalists to grasp. We
don't appeal just to one section of the population.
Everybody watches Scottish Television, but obviously not all of the
time. We construct schedules designed to match programmes to available
audiences, so that what we play in the late evening is different from
what we transmit in the afternoons.
Audiences like diversity; sometimes they want to think and sometimes
they want to laugh. We make both kinds of programme.
Earlier on the same night as Late Edition two weeks ago, we cleared
the network peak-time schedule to transmit a live debate on Scotland's
constitutional options. About a quarter of a million Scots spent an hour
watching their four party leaders examining the main issues. The
programming we replaced would have secured twice the audience. So why
did we do it? Because it was a timely and important debate and because
this is part of the service we owe to our viewers.
In a couple of weeks viewers in central Scotland will miss out on a
network movie because we'll again be taking an hour of peak-time for a
valuable Scottish programme -- this time the annual Scottish Book Awards
which give recognition to the best of our contemporary writers. No other
broadcaster in Scotland would or could do this.
It's difficult to square this kind of programming or scheduling (and
the list could go on and on) with the supposedly downmarket and low-brow
philosophy Allan Laing thinks he detects at Cowcaddens. I suppose The
Herald management must agree with me, or I don't suppose the paper would
be sponsoring The Home Show on Scottish, or allowing its distinguished
arts editor to present our Don't Look Down series.
As the clear market leader in the most powerful medium, Scottish
Television's programmes should be the subject of discussion, criticism,
controversy, even the odd rant.
Not everybody likes everything, and Allan Laing didn't like Late
Edition. But you can't turn a subjective reaction to one programme into
a misrepresentation of an entire station philosophy, and indeed a
mistaken analysis of an industry.
Our first priority is providing the best possible service to viewers,
to produce a schedule offering quality and diversity. We don't just
offer the biggest volume of local programmes anywhere in ITV; we also
offer the widest range. We take our business seriously and consult our
viewers constantly. So we know that it's a myth to imagine that upmarket
viewers don't want to be entertained.

SPECULATION is growing that Post Office chief executive Bill Cockburn
will become chief executive of the WH Smith newsagency, stationery and
records group.
He will replace Sir Malcolm Field, 58, who is expected to retire early
next year having been with the company since 1963 when his family owned
newsagency business was taken over.
Sir Malcolm became chief executive only in 1994 but has already
indicated that he was looking for a successor. He is also a
non-executive director of Scottish &amp; Newcastle and the MEPC property
group.
Edinurgh-born Mr Cockburn, 52, has been with the Post Office since
1961 and has worked his way up through the business, chiefly on the
financial side.
He was appointed to the top exective postition in 1992 and immediately
became a strong advocate of privatisation. However, when the then Trade
Secretary Michael Heseltine said in March that pivatisation of the Post
Office had been shelved for the lifetime of the present Parliament, Mr
Cockburn's discomfiture and annoyance immediately became well known.
He is already in the board of Whitbread in a non-executive role. That
was widely regarded as a first step to becoming even better known in the
City in his quest for a major executive role as he did not renew his
Post Office contract in September when it expired.
Smith has had a turbulent time in the last couple of years, having
both declining profits and also being forced to issue profit warnings.
It was able to encourage sentiment at the annual meeting with chairman
Jeremy Hardie cheering shareholders by telling them that sales for the
September quarter were ahead by 8%. But that was before the ending of
the Net Book Agreement and the more recent call from newsagents to
reduce newspaper wholesalers margins.

CLARE Short's suggestion that cannabis be legalised will be welcomed
by six in 10 Scots youngsters, many of them still at school, who are
reckoned to be using the drug regularly.
It is unlikely to be welcomed, however, by the majority of parents,
who still frown on their children smoking or drinking, much less taking
drugs, before the age of 18.
Thirty years after the Summer of Love wreathed San Francisco in clouds
of marijuana smoke, inspiring a generation of devotees, the debate goes
on -- is it harmful, does it lead to the misuse of hard drugs, is it any
worse than alcohol or tobacco? And should it be legalised to allow the
police to devote more time to pursuing the heroin and cocaine dealers?
While the politicians and the medical profession argue the pros and
cons, it seems the majority of young people have decided for themselves.
According to a survey in Glasgow last year, half of the respondents aged
between 14 and 25 admitted to smoking cannabis every day.
A Herald survey last month discovered that by the time they reach
university, almost 80% of students have taken ''recreational'' drugs.
While freshers in the eighties tried marijuana for the first time in the
halls of learning, those in the nineties are arriving with their own
plants.
Nor is the practice confined to young people. A Home Office survey of
18 to 25-year-olds in Newcastle revealed more than eight out of 10 men
and women have taken illegal drugs. Another study showed the biggest
consumers were not schoolchildren but young white males from the
professional and middle classes.
If the drug ever does become legal in Britain it will be because of
the sheer weight of such statistics, which indicate a threefold increase
in smoking ''pot'' since 1989. However, Ms Short, and more outspoken
campaigners in favour of legalising it, face an uphill battle.
Last year Home Secretary Michael Howard increased the maximum fine for
possession of the drug from #500 to #2500. The tabloid press lambasted
the Liberal Democrats for debating a motion to decriminalise (as opposed
to legalise) marijuana; and it was only a few months ago when Ms Short's
party attacked the Lib-Dems for being ''soft on drugs''.
On the other side of the debate, the head of the main
government-funded body dealing with young people called this year for
the decriminalisation of cannabis. Janet Paraskeva, director of the
National Youth Agency and a magistrate, told a drug policy forum in
London that tax generated by legal cannabis could be used for better
control of hard drugs and treatment of addicts.
The essence of her argument was that the authorities, and the police
in particular, were wasting time and money prosecuting people found in
possession of small amounts of the drug for their personal pleasure. She
said many police officers were not convinced that enforcement of the
present law was possible or desirable.
Although no exact figures are available, it is known the Government
spends about twice as much on policing and prosecuting drug offenders as
it does on education, prevention, and rehabilitation. Despite all this
effort, however, it has manifestly failed to stem the tide of drugs
inundating the country; which is a point cited repeatedly by those
calling for a more liberal attitude to cannabis.
According to Mike Goodman, the director of Release, which has
campaigned against British drug laws since the sixties, police attitudes
vary from region to region.
''It depends where you get caught,'' he says. ''There are parts of
Wales and various rural areas where you'll certainly go to court for
possessing cannabis and get a fairly stiff fine. In other areas, such as
London, you'd be unlikely even to get a caution.''
In the capital, he suggests, the response is usually 'informal
disposal' -- which means the police throw the confiscated drugs down the
drain.
Despite this ambivalent attitude, however, Goodman says increasing
numbers of people are being prosecuted for cannabis offences every year.
The latest figures are around 50,000 this year, compared with about
20,000 in 1985.
While Britain continues to agonise over the issue, attitudes are
changing more quickly in other parts of Europe. Smoking cannabis is now
officially tolerated in parts of Germany and Switzerland, as well as in
Amsterdam where hundreds of coffee houses have been selling it openly
over the counter for almost 20 years.
In the United States, many cancer specialists have ignored stringent
anti-marijuana laws by advising patients to smoke the drug to control
vomiting brought on by chemotherapy.
Proponents of legalisation overseas argue that it breaks up a thriving
black market and brings the problem into the open. They say it improves
the health and safety of users, because government licensing allows some
control over the purchaser's age and drug quality. Income from tax on
cannabis also helps to pay for the treatment and rehabilitation of hard
drug users.
The counter-argument is that to legalise cannabis is to embark on a
slippery slope of encouraging the use of drugs that involve serious
health risks. The millions of deaths attributed to alcohol and tobacco
are cited as a warning.
Scots children may continue to pass around ''joints'' covertly in
school toilets and playgrounds, but it is unlikely they will be
permitted to do so openly for a long time yet.

SPENDING on tourism in Scotland is expected to exceed #4100m a year
early in the next century, according to a comprehensive report published
today from Business Strategies, a London-based economic forecasting
group.
Once adjusted for inflation, the figure is a rise of more than 21% on
the 1992-94 average.
Although the tourism industry is expected to grow, its growth rate is
not expected to be as high as that for the economy as a whole. Last
year, tourism accounted for 5.2% of Scotland's output of goods and
services. By 2004, the forecast shows that this will have fallen
marginally to 5.1%.
Bridget Rosewell, joint managing director of Business Strategies, said
that Scotland, benefiting from a high ''Hollywood'' profile, has made
considerable advances in luring tourists away from London.
Britons account for half the money spent by tourists in Scotland,
foreign visitors a quarter, and day trippers a further quarter.
Seventy-four per cent of spending by British tourists in Scotland goes
on holidays, 7% on visting friends and relatives, and 19% arises from
business trips. Spending per trip to Scotland at #194 is second only to
London's #337.
There are thought to be good opportunities to grow Scottish tourism on
the back of improved transport links. Ms Rosewell said that over the
next 10 years, overseas visitors, are likely to fan out across the
country and the Channel tunnel will make it easier for them to use their
own transport.
Overall, earnings from the British tourist industry are set to hit
#48bn a year sometime between 2002 and 2004.
The report has been sponsored by a number of organisations including
Scottish Enterprise and The Royal Bank of Scotland.
Tourism in the UK Regions, Spending &amp; Prospects'' is available from

BUSINESS optimism among small and medium sized enterprises has fallen
for the first time in three years after a continued slowdown in output
and new orders. And Scottish SMEs manufacturing output growth over the
last four months has slowed to a similar rate to the overall UK results,
a survey showed today.
The quarterly survey by the Confederation of British Industry and
accountants Pannell Kerr Forster shows that smaller Scottish firms are
less optimistic than the medium size ones about their business
prospects.
This contrasts with the recent CBI Sottish Industrial Trends Survey
where export growth is still evident. Although growth in Scotland is
expected to rise on the back of exports, unit prices will also increase
so that the squeeze on profit margins will not ease.
For the first time since October 1992 -- the month after the pound
crashed out of the European exchange rate mechanism -- overall more
manufacturers employing less than 500 people were pessimistic rather
than optimistic about the business situation.
The UK figures indicate that the decline in business optimism was
particularly marked among medium sized companies, where the pessimists
outnumbered the optimists by 10%. Output and new orders grew at their
slowest pace for two years in the last four months.
But unlike big manufacturers, SMEs reported a rise in employment which
is expected to continue over the next four months in firms employing
less than 200 people. Medium sized manufacturers anticipate a small cut
in jobs for the first time since July 1994.
However Scottish SMEs are indicating strong investment intentions,
particularly in training and retraining.
Mr Alistair Owen, Pannell Kerr Forster's director of advisory services
in Edinburgh, said efficiency needed to be inceased by investing in
training and development of staff. The survey shows that Scottish firms
have taken this on board as one of the ways of establishing a more
flexible and responsive work force.
Mr Andrew Cubie, chairman of the CBI Scotland, said the survey
suggests a trend of cautious underlying optimism in the future as
initiated by SMEs strong intentions to invest in plant and machinery,
training, and retraining.
* Interest rates appear to be on hold until 1997, according to an
analysis by senior bank economists published today.
The Government uses the cost of borrowing to maintain its inflation
target and the economists from Lloyds Bank believe the inflation outlook
is probably slightly better than data a few months ago suggested.
''In 1996, some signs of inflation pressure will surface, on our
projections, but these are likely to be short-lived,'' they says.
* SLUGGISH consumer spending is continuing to depress confidence in
the property market for shops -- but better times may be just around the
corner, according to two reports.
A survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed that
slightly more of its members were more optimistic about an upturn in
demand for shop premises.
A report by market research company Verdict said consumer spending had
now reached a turning point and would be boosted by tax cuts in the
Budget next month.

Foster is a world famous architect but surely only his most ardent
admirers would suggest that this building comes anywhere near his best
work
Alan Dunlop argues that Glasgow must abandon short-term architectural
fixes which lead to long-term problems and adopt a visionary strategy
NEWS that the Post Office building in George Square, Glasgow, could
yet be sold off to a private developer and not used to house the
National Gallery of Scottish Art appears to have thrown the city into
further confusion.
The inevitable outcome of poor planning, it is not a surprise to those
demanding a coherent strategy and regeneration plan for the city; a
strategy to include long-term civic and cultural development, to
position Glasgow as a forward-looking and thriving city and not subject
to the vagaries of short-term political or economic intervention.
Despite declaring ''clear public support'', does anyone outwith the
GDA, district council and trustees of the National Gallery really know
what is proposed for this new gallery? The Post Office building is
certainly an excellent site but access to the project objective is
difficult to obtain and apart from a vague reference that ''it will be a
bit like'' the Musee d'Orsay in Paris there is little clarity on the
aims and how the project fits into any plan for the city.
The Musee d'Orsay is certainly worth emulating, housing as it does
prestigious art within a monumental building, the vast central space of
which was once the grand concourse for the Gare d'Orsay. Sadly, it is as
unlike the Post Office building as it is possible to get.
Any new bid for 1-5 George Square now requires a postal museum, a
further twist which may rule out one developer who had in mind a
''multi-million pound shopping mall''. Any retail development will
require massive car parking and increase traffic in an already badly
congested area of the city.
It could also have a significant impact on the proposed 600,000 sq ft
shopping mall which will adjoin the Royal Concert Hall, just in time for
the UK City of Architecture and Design in 1999, and dilute the ''Grand
Thoroughfare'' proposal for Buchanan Street. How easy it is to throw the
apparent plans for our city into disarray.
Yet another developer intends a bid which incorporates a postal museum
into a large office development. The final decision will be made in two
weeks by the Scottish Postal Board and will inevitably have important
consequences for Glasgow.
Apart from the embarrassment caused by losing out on another building
earmarked for the gallery project, there are fundamental issues which
arise from the sale of the Post Office building which need to be
addressed. Should business interest and private money have such
overriding influence on critical public space and dictate urban
development?
Remember, the original idea was to house the new gallery in the
Sheriff Court, a much grander and more imposing building which, I
suggest, is much better suited to the project. However, that building
was sold on our behalf by the GDA to a hotel company and the opportunity
lost.
There are, admittedly, other schemes which have attempted to revive
civic and cultural interest and which could stimulate activity around
them but few have achieved the high standards sparked at their
inception.
The Royal Concert Hall is, arguably, one such project. Conceived
almost 30 years ago as a major cultural centre, it has been altered to
yet another shopping complex, this time with a concert hall attached.
The auditorium sits inside a fortress-like wall and is now a ''mix and
match'' option within a retail area of vast scale. The grand foyer
spaces and banqueting suite envisaged in Sir Leslie Martin's original
proposals and which could have breathed much-needed life into the
moribund elevation on Sauchiehall Street have been removed.
The venue is popular because people are interested in live performance
and enthusiastic about music but visiting the building itself is not
viewed as an event, and that is a great pity.
Yet another incident which highlights the need for an overall strategy
for development was the international competition for a Millennium Tower
at St Enoch Square. The brief for the competition, won by the British
architect Richard Horden with an elegant design, was for a site-specific
proposal to create a landmark for the new Glasgow and provide interest
and challenge to visitors to the city centre. It has now been removed to
the highly controversial Pacific Quay development, out of context and
cut off from the rest of the city and a car ride away across the
Kingston Bridge. Bad enough, but moves are afoot to replace the winning
tower with a more ''populist'' design from the 1930s.
Does Glasgow have more faith in the past than in its future?
Consider also the new extension to the SECC opposite Pacific Quay,
currently being designed by Sir Norman Foster. Foster is a world-famous
architect but surely only his most ardent admirers would suggest that
this building comes anywhere near his best work.
Architects practising in the city and the people of Glasgow want to
know why? Little is known, certainly in the public domain, about the
process leading to the commissioning of Foster or the development of the
design for the building, which is known as the ''burrowing armadillo''.
Why was debate not encouraged and why was there no consultation or
discussion within the wider architectural community? Glasgow has some
very talented architects, yet such a design jewel was withheld.
The thought was obviously that a building designed by a famous
architect would be enough to focus world attention on the city and place
it firmly on the architectural map. Such a tactic may have worked, but
not without a first-class design.
Supporters of the building point to the blandness of its surroundings
and the lack of architectural quality of adjoining buildings as
justification for the uninspiring design. Others, in contrast, have
compared the proposed extension to that of Jorn Utzon's architectural
masterpiece the Sydney Opera House, which was recently voted one of the
wonders of the twentieth century and which has become a potent symbol of
Australia. I am sure that was the intent for Glasgow. Whatever the
merits or otherwise of the building people will soon be able to judge
for themselves, and it will be a long-term influence on Clydeside.
Which brings me to the waterfront. What are the city's intentions
here? Delegates at the recent Liberal Democrat conference in the SECC
noted the dearth of activity on the Clyde.
''Where are the riverside cafes and floating restaurants?'' they
asked. The degeneration of a great river which was the lifeblood of the
city is another indictment of the absence of long-term planning and lack
of vision.
It is an issue that piecemeal ''design and build'' solutions and
opportunistic development finance cannot deal with, for such approaches
inevitably lead to competing interest, divisive attitudes and provide
little opportunity for commissioning coherent public space.
Certainly not all speculative development is poor and the Atlantic
Quay development at the Broomielaw is a well-designed building which
uses high quality materials yet, at the moment, sits in splendid
isolation on the river's edge. It could be a great asset to the city as
catalyst for change in that area and both the developer and architect
must be given credit.
However, the civic purpose has failed because of the widespread
dereliction around it and the lack of infrastructure support. Large
companies considering moving into the riverside area have been dissuaded
by employees, unhappy about being cut of from the city centre and
worried about leaving the area at night. Perhaps their concerns would
have been mitigated if a long-term and public strategy was in place to
provided a tangible vision of how it will be revitalised.
Sadly, no such vision exists but perhaps the opportunity of Glasgow as
UK City of Architecture and Design in 1999 will galvanise people into
action and provide the impetus for direction and leadership.
To this end, head-hunters have put forward 10 names for the position
of festival director for the year-long event.
None of the 10 is a Glasgow architect, though some apparently have
their ''roots in Glasgow'' and one is described as an ''architectural
consultant''.
What is going on? Of the 110 ''opinion formers'' invited to the City
Chambers last November to come up with a ''vision statement'' for
Glasgow, most were from local government, a goodly number were from
quangos, many from social services and one was from Friends of the
Earth. There was a real paucity of architects and perhaps this is a
measure of how the profession is regarded.
Yet Glasgow has two excellent and internationally recognised schools
of architecture which specialise in urban development, and, not to
labour the point, some excellent architects.
As chairman of the UK City of Architecture and Design steering group
for the Glasgow Institute of Architects and a representative of their
environment committee, I confirm that we have now picked up the gauntlet
and have begun a programme of work aimed at stimulating development in
key areas and are preparing our vision for the future. Our first
objective is the Clyde. There are many other areas of interest; however,
the river and its environs offer the greatest challenge and is in most
immediate danger of abuse through the adoption of short-term commercial
fixes.
Visitors to the recent Bilbao 2000 exhibition in Princes Square were
impressed by the coherent vision in that city's plans for the new
millennium. People in Bilbao are interested in the bigger picture and
visualise their city as an important European destination in the next
century. They now have a vision of the future which they can all get
behind and, most importantly, get excited about. Can't we do the same?
It will be a huge task for the community, but the Glasgow Institute of
Architects have instigated a year-long programme, involving both schools
of architecture, which includes a major exhibition on the river in
Princes Square in February 1996. A diary of conferences, exhibitions and
seminars is being put together where developers, planners, architects
and the people of Glasgow will be invited to put their ideas across.
Architects in Glasgow have a fundamental role to play in urban
regeneration and more than any other professional group are specifically
trained to address the challenges facing the city and provide
imaginative solutions. So why not use them?
In the run-up to 1999, the GIA intends to take the regeneration
message to the wider community, to prepare workshops for community
centres, town halls and shopping malls and to address specific problems
in local areas. A programme for schools is also under way which will
provide information about development in Glasgow in an accessible
manner.
We will also promote our view that pure economics and the search for
short-term gain lead inevitably to a lack of a coherent approach,
resulting in a problematic environment with substandard buildings. From
this activity we will prepare a vision for the future of Glasgow and
instigate a workable regeneration strategy. But we do not intend to do
it alone!

HISTORY, according to David McWhinnie, has to be the ultimate saleable
product.
The interest it inspires is as international and timeless as it is
consistent. And now, the hunch he backed in 1986 when he set up Lamancha
Productions Ltd -- an Edinburgh-based company making factually based
programmes on 20th century history -- is reaping its reward.
Bought by the Public Broadcast Service (PBS) for screening in America,
Lamancha's Battlefield series was seen by up to thirty million people in
the United States during the summer. The series is also in line for an
Emmy award scheduled to be announced in November.
Raised in Motherwell, McWhinnie came to film via a circuitous route.
Having studied graphic design and film at St Mark's Art School in
London, he spent eight years in promotions and advertising with Island
Record. There he worked with Bob Marley, Cat Stevens, and Paul McCartney
among others.
''The record business hadn't got commercial yet. It was smallish,
almost naive -- an interesting period,'' he recalled.
It was also extremely hectic. Feeling the need for a slower-paced
life, McWhinnie returned north -- to Edinburgh -- and diversified again,
this time into period fireplaces.
It was not until 1980 with the launch of his In Video company that Mr
McWhinnie established himself in the film business, running a production
facility for advertisers. Soon he was capitalising on being the only
person around with facilities to produce low-budget TV commercials for
industry.
In Video filled a gap in the market. Six years on, Lamancha
Productions set up to fill another. With funding from the Scottish
investment group, Castleforth, McWhinnie established a business -- at
first low-key -- which now boasts two edit suites equipped with
technology for producing first-rate documentaries for export round the
world.
To source the archive footage frequently used in his work, McWhinnie
travels once a year to the former Soviet Union and to the USA, visiting
military academies and meeting with private collectors.
One of his most exciting discoveries (incorporated into Battlefield)
was 20 minutes of film shot in Berlin in 1936 in, most unusually for the
period, colour. ''It shows a lot of places that no long exist,'' he
said. ''I got it from a collector in East Germany.''
Lamancha (named after an estate near Edinburgh which was once home to
a man with a vineyard in Spain and is now owned by Mr McWhinnie) prides
itself on being an international operation. Decisions are directed to
its office in Bromley, managed by former head of Thames Video, Ken
Maliphant. It is not that Lamancha eschews the UK market on principle;
it is more that UK television demands too broad a base.
McWhinnie makes history programmes for specialists -- and he prefers
to retain editorial control. He cites a hypothetical case by way of
explanation. ''Suppose Channel Four wanted a series, say, on women at
war. They might as us to put it in the context of how an 18-year-old
might feel. We'd have a problem selling that elsewhere.''
PBS, on the other hand, America's equivalent of BBC2, appears to have
no problem with screening special programmes for general consumption.
Over the last decade, Lamancha has broadcast 140 hours of programming,
screened in total by 26 countries in innumerable languages. PolyGram
Film International in the USA act as intermediaries with all buyers,
including PBS. PolyGram part financed the award-winning Battlefield and
is distributing the series in all forms, including video.
The company's success -- turnover is #1m -- amply confirms Mr
McWhinnie's early instincts that his market serves the same discerning
customer as the specialist historical book market. While the appetite
for history in such quarters seems unquenchable, the other side of the
coin is that afficionados are extremely knowledgeable and ready to
pounce on the slightest inaccuracy. ''The toughest thing is that one
mistake and we are dead,'' he said. ''Historians will crucify you. But
we would deserve it.''
He receives constant faxed feedback (especially from Americans) and
strives to maintain high standards through consultation with
half-a-dozen of the UK's top historians.
Mr McWhinnie, 45, who is also finding the time to produce The Bruce,
has no fears that the sources of his genre may be in danger of drying
up. There is, he believes, ''substantial material'' in Russia covering
the civil war. Secreted by Stalin, this footage is still kept under lock
and key by the KGB in Moscow.
Of more immediate concern is the increasingly competitive nature of
his business. ''Like anyone else, we want the best possible images,'' he
stressed. ''It's more complicated than eight years ago. We paid #30,000
for the Berlin footage; we might get 15 minutes of something else for
#10,000.''
The company was paid ''hundreds of thousands of dollars'' by PBS for
the Battlefield series which runs to six two-hour, two-part programmes,
featuring such conflicts as the battles of Midway, Stalingrad, Berlin,
and Normandy. Every aspect of assembly is done, in-house, in Edinburgh
by Lamancha's staff of 12.
McWhinnie is aware of the market for dubious videos of the Great
Tyrants and Great Executions variety and is at pains to disassociate
himself from sensational rubbish of this kind. ''We have to be very
careful. PBS is the most politically correct company in the world. We
try to bring something new to the table or to look at an underexplored
area,'' said the director, who plans to develop into CD Rom programmes.

Andrew O'Hagan knows how to unearth inspiration on home ground. John
Linklater profiles a writer whose debut book explores the missing and
the unmissed.
IT started for Andrew O'Hagan with an investigation into the Barlinnie
Special Unit. As a student journalist on the Strathclyde Telegraph he
had been torn between two ideas of what the business should be about.
Was it getting on a plane to New York to interview Cher, or trying to
find stories that surrounded him, describing the undescribed in the next
street?
In a Barlinnie rooftop protest there was a prisoner's blanket with the
slogan ''Slasher Gallacher''. That prompted curiosity, three months'
research, a published story and a direction that has kept him on course
ever since.
His Barlinnie piece won him the Glasgow Herald's Student Journalist of
the Year award in 1988.
''Even the sight of the newspaper's letterhead fluttered me,'' he
recalls. ''It meant there was an Emerald City called journalism.'' He
picked up his first cheque for writing. It was for #50, a kind of
promisory note for the success that is being generated around
publication of his debut book, The Missing.
The genesis of that book is vindication of the idea that the starting
point for a piece of work should present itself close at hand, rather
than 4000 miles away. As a child he had uncovered a photograph of his
grandfather. ''He looked like Glasgow,'' he writes in the book. Like
Glasgow, perhaps, because Glasgow had been lost to the young O'Hagan, an
overspill child in the move to the New Town of Irvine, and because his
grandfather Michael O'Hagan had been lost at sea, a victim of a U-Boat
attack on HMS Forfar in the North Atlantic in 1940. He was missing,
presumed dead.
Andrew explains how the idea germinated: ''If I could understand the
life that he had lived, and then that quick and unknowable end, then I
might be able to understand something about what conditioned our lives
in Glasgow and Ayrshire. Not only his life, but the lives that
surrounded him. He had a difficult and quite troubled life here. But a
lot of that life is unknown to me. Even on graduating at 21 I knew that
was something I wanted to work through.''
If that resolve was clear, his route towards it was complicated by the
immediate need to learn his trade. The day after he graduated with a
starred first and the #60 year prize from the Strathclyde University
English department, he bought a ticket at Buchanan Street bus station.
It was for London. ''I wasn't in a position to be unemployed,'' he says.
''I needed to work. I was also bursting to write.''
It was an unconventional start in professional journalism. He saw an
advert and found himself co-editing the St Dunstan's Review, a
charitable magazine for the war blind, founded in 1923. His duties
included a perfectionist's desire to lay-out pages that no reader would
ever see, and taking parties of blind people on outings to describe to
them what could be seen. He also found himself engrossed in interviews
with veterans in their 70s and 80s, victims of mustard gas attacks and
shrapnel blindings.
''The frivolity and light-headedness that had carried me through my
last student days in Glasgow was suddenly levened by their
experiences,'' he said. ''I spent a lot of time trying to find different
ways to describe the colour blue. And reading to them.''
His next test of personal resources was a rigorous interview for the
post of assistant editor at the London Review of Books. He got the job
through ''cheek'', he claims. It was there he was encouraged to start
writing some of the subjective pieces that began to shape the book, and
broaden its field of inquiry. His piece on boyhood cruelty, in the wake
of the Bolger case, was reprinted in The Guardian, the Independent, and
Harper's magazine in America. The phone never stopped ringing. Agents
and publishers were writing every other day. It was time to engage with
that book he'd had in mind for years.
The Missing is an unusual division of memoir and reportage in its
separate halves, exploring a common theme of the missing and the
unmissed. It locates the Glasgow of O'Hagan's grandfather, looks at the
worlds of Peter Manuel and Bible John, and threatens at times to present
a No Mean City Revisited.
It is also a book which examines the 30,000 persons reported missing
annually, and the many more who remain unreported. O'Hagan's treatment
of the memoir sections has drawn something from Rebecca's Vest by Karl
Miller, his former editor at London Review of Books, and the reportage
is in the tradition of Greenwood and Orwell.
The original run of 10,000 copies, a generous enough vote of
confidence for a first-time author, sold out on orders alone before
publication. Within a week of its launch on Monday it has been
short-listed for The Esquire non-fiction award.
''There's a fantastic tradition of subjective reportage that is
especially Scottish in character,'' says O'Hagan. ''People over the last
few weeks have been mentioning Truman Capote to me, Joan Didian and
Norman Mailer, but the books that really energised me, and sensitised me
to this business of other people's lives, and the dimensions of lives
not your own, were people like Boswell and John Galt and Stevenson, and
the Ayrshire writers like Burns and the great hymn writer James
Montgomery.
''I've tried to excavate something of these people's lives and
writings in the book, as a way of trying to deal with a place like
Ayrshire that is dramatically underdescribed in contemporary writing.
It's as if it doesn't fully exist. I've learned from Alasdair Gray's
business that you don't live there properly until the place has been
used in literature and you live there imaginatively.''

WITH that urbane mixture of erudition and lust, the art historian
Kenneth Clark would stroke the buttocks of some alabaster Venus to
assure his Civilisation audience that the nude was central to any
understanding of aesthetics. That was 25 years ago, but who could doubt
his premise? From cave drawings onwards the unencumbered truth was there
for all to see.
Reclining, lolling, musing, sometimes frolicking or spreadeagled in a
sulk, the naked body had transcended spasms of common outrage to travel
through centuries. And so it has also been with photography, the soft
focus nude hogging the snapshot, in one pose or another, almost from
that moment in 1839 when Louis Daguerre invented the camera.
But now a meddlesome curse is active once again. That censuring
vexation we call political correctness is not enthralled by the play of
light on intimate angles and curves, and demands the days of the
masterly nude be numbered. Political correctness likes its Venus fully
clothed.
Yet even this does not explain why, today, the photographer king of
opulent exposure is himself giving nudes the push.
''I don't want to see another naked woman for the rest of my life,''
says Helmut Newton, his hangdog features sliding further into gloom. As
it happens we are sitting in the Hamilton Gallery in Mayfair, where
every wall is dominated by Amazons, Newton's monumental black and white
images of women strong and undaunted in their nakedness.
Some, the Domestic Nudes, are satirically mocking, embellished only by
the photographer's signature stilettos. Others, although beautifully
composed, offer a parody of menace while the Landscape Torsos, serenely
modest, still and vast, could nicely accommodate Asia in their laps.
But Newton is adamant: these photographs, which form his latest London
exhibition, mark his farewell to nudie-rama, and since this has been his
subject matter for 30 years his boredom with it, he says, must surely be
understandable. Can it be true, then, that nudes really are like ancient
ruins -- once you've seen one, you've seen the lot?
Newton's face takes on the expression of someone who has just
swallowed a bad oyster. ''What are you saying?'' he chides. ''Believe
me, old as I am I can still tell every girl is different, and thank God
for that. But you know, I am like a doctor when I look at them. The
girls, too, say that I study them with a distant eye.''
He is 74, an old iconoclast in remarkably good shape but still
signalling defiance of convention. Today he subverts his pinstripe suit
with a white sweatshirt and a pair of Puma running shoes, and when he
walks his movements carry a slight reminder of Groucho Marx's loping
gait, the result, he says, of sciatica. ''I am healthy but for my bad
back.''
During conversation his hands and shoulders shift about excitedly, but
in those rare moments of quiet Newton has a knack of falling into a
silence so profound it somehow suggests he has stopped breathing
altogehter. Then, suddenly, he clicks out of silent reflection and fast
forwards into speedy chatter.
''I would never dream of calling my pictures art, although I have some
photographer friends who claim to be artists. Well, that's their
business.'' The gravelled voice cannot hide its disbelief.
''Me, I take pictures. I'm a hired gun, a voyeur, and any photographer
who tells you he's not a voyeur, don't listen. He's talking bullshit.''
The German accent is barely discernible now, but Newton's New York
intonation, which adds the raciness to his speech, is a keepsake from
long years of working with American Vogue.
''Nudes, I tell you, I've had enough of them. Last year for my Paris
exhibition I worked so hard to make nude women appear new that
afterwards I decided that stage of my life was over. Well, maybe
sometime I'll do a few in colour for a change, but now I'm much more
interested in seascapes and architecture.
''Of course, when I tell people this, they say: 'Very nice, Helmut.
Now show us the nudes.' Perhaps they'll hang the seascapes when I'm
dead.''
He roars with laughter, the glum features exploiting that other
Groucho trick of playing up the morose and punctuating disclosure with a
drawn-out operatic groan.
At the start of his career he used to say: ''I'm just a guy who shoots
clothes for a living,'' and even though clothes became the very least of
it, his influence on generations of fashion photographers has been
colossal. The sexually ambivalent shots of predatory Jezebels, the S &amp; M
accessories and all that undulating skin were, whatever his disclaimers,
porno-chic to some, high-art to others.
Either way, the style has been endlessly plagiarised, although
Newton's imitators rarely achieve the visual echoes and baroque grandeur
which tipify his work; that peculiar narrative alliance between irony
and aggression.
Does the copying annoy him? Newton has threatened legal action in the
past, but in the end that is rather like an author claiming nobody must
quote him, and anyway the line between appropriation and homage is
fiendishly difficult to discern.
''Photography is a metier, a method of self-expression. It's the way I
want people to observe how I see the world. If established photographers
pinch ideas, that's stupid. If the young, starting out, do so, that's
understandable.''
As for political correctness, Newton will never cease to rail against
it. ''It reminds me, most unpleasantly, of Nazi Germany, and my aim as I
grow older is to become more and more politically incorrect. People who
insist on that kind of control make for a very poor society. They seek
to build something that is already dead. My attitude has always been not
to do as I am told. It's gotten me into trouble but it has also enriched
my life.''
Yet Newton has never been an all-out anarchist. He grew up in Berlin
during the twenties and thirties, then went to Melbourne during the
Second World War, and it was in Australia that his photographic career
began with inauspicious commercial shots of baby bootees, and weddings.
Maybe it was the juxtaposition of such subjects which drove him
towards the bizarre, but even though he remained in Australia until 1956
it was his memory of the kitschy decadence of pre-war Berlin which was a
compelling influence. That cultivated his voyeurism, his fetishism, and
the use of the symbolic monocle so often seen in his pictures.
As for other inspirational forces, the most potent was Brassai, of
whom he once wrote: ''He is the master of night light, the streets of
Paris, the night cityscapes, the interiors of brothels.''
Newton insists that most of his own work is intended to be funny. He
also maintains that despite his wild ideas, timidity dictates his own
behaviour.
''I would never force anyone to do anything. In fact, I would rather
talk a girl out of taking her clothes off rather than co-ercing her to
do so. Really I'm quite prudish, easily shocked and often more
embarrassed than the girls themselves. For instance I would never touch
them, but I say to them: 'Just think of yourselves as dressed', and that
makes everyone feel less self-conscious.''
There has always been one steadfast Newton's law: no nude receives
payment for posing for his pictures because he thinks an exchange of
money in this context would carry wrong connotations.
''What they get is a signed gallery print and a written guarantee from
me that the pictures will never be sold for commercial purposes, unless
the girls are consulted and are agreeable.''
But if Newton has always been so anxious and shy about such ventures,
why endure them in the first place? His arms strike the air in playful
exasperation: ''Are you serious? Why not do it when painters and
sculptors have been portraying the nude for ever? It's a natural thing.
But I must say all my big nudes are very pure. In black and white
nakedness becomes abstract and that's what makes it acceptable. Indeed,
I don't think my big nudes are erotic or sexy in any way. They are like
documentation. A passport picture, very matter-of-fact.''
If there is something personal in such photographs, it exists, he
says, in the face, although Newton admits he always remembers women's
clothes more than facial features. And that is the maddening thing.
After all these decades of voluptuous flesh (Newton abhors the preening
skeletons who pass for catwalk mannequins today), he would still prefer
to be known for his frock shots. Plus those seascapes, of course.
''I'm keen now to get back to fashion photography because that has
always been the first love. But designers today, they're lazy. All this
business of re-creating the sixties -- it just proves a lack of
imagination. The sixties were dreadful. Hair was awful, clothes were
awful. Now, the seventies, they were good looking.''
As a portrait photographer Newton regards Faye Dunaway, the actress,
as his most impressively sensual subject.
''She's a big woman, which I love, and she has the best legs of any
female on earth. Only my mother had better legs. Or maybe they weren't
as good as I remember, but she would say to me: 'Helmut, your father
fell over my legs and into marriage.' I always thought that was a nice
way to put it.''
In a realm of life where relationships often last no longer than the
seasonal mode, Newton's own marriage to June Brown, alias Alice Springs,
the photographer, has been outstandingly durable. They met and married
in the forties, and, despite Newton's aura of glamorous gallivanting,
they have succeeded in staying together because he is an old fashioned,
monogamous husband.
In fact, with his global perspective on most things, he describes
himself as the most faithful, thoughtful and clean-living person in the
world.
''I'm a sweetheart, an angel, a perfect person. I never have a dirty
thought, and I've never done drugs in my life.''
Equally, his wife has observed that the man she calls Helmie is
nothing like his work: ''That's another side,'' she has said. ''The
darker side, and I know nothing about that.''
Their home today is Monte Carlo, where the Newton apartment, with its
wrap-around terrace, offers views of the casino, Monaco's peach-coloured
palace, the marina buoyant with yachts, and Karl Lagerfeld's villa. A
vintage starriness hangs about that kind of real-estate inventory and --
who knows? -- some day the terrace may carry a plaque locating it as the
spot where Newton shot his sensational Dressed/Undressed pictures of
women naked/women clothed, but each in an identical pose.
And his advice now, to all young girls: ''Don't be a model. It's a
dead-end job. Good for making money, if you're very lucky, but that's
about all. It's a cruel world rife with drugs, and it will chew you up
and spit you out.''
But will any young girl listen? He doubts it.
Meanwhile, that man on the riviera beach, the one with the comic
gravitas and low-slung stride, that's Helmut Newton. The only Monte
Carlo photographer ignoring the topless to point his camera at the sea.
* Helmut Newton will give a rare illustrated lecture, Gun For
Hire, in the Blackburn Lecture series, at the Glasgow Film Theatre on
November 20 at 10.30am. The event will be open to the public and is
being held in conjunction with Glasgow School of Art. His exhibition at
the Hamilton Gallery, Carlos Place, London, runs until November 18.

Clare Henry talks to artists Alison Harper and Helen Flockhart about
the influences in their work.
PEOPLE? Love them or hate them, they are all that really matters in
life. However men and women do have very different ways of expressing
their emotions. Does that matter? Do foreign countries and cultures
provide the key? Certainly they jolt us into a new perspective.
''The West seems to view the intellect as the supreme power.
Intuition, instinct and nature are no longer valued, nor respected. Here
the efficient running of our external life is paramount whereas in
India, where I've spent the past two years, the 'inner-life' is still
considered important and motherhood is at least celebrated,'' says
Alison Harper, who is currently exhibiting at Glasgow's Compass Gallery.
''India is not perfect, and superstition is the restrictive downside,
but people there are enriched by ritual, myth and magic which is
definitely missing from our European lives.''
It was her interest in Buddhism, began in 1983 while at Glasgow School
of Art, which took her to India. ''Meditation has played a profound role
in the development of my work, particularly in relation to the search
for its emotional authenticity and intensity. I aim to be truthful and
to produce pictures that are deeply felt.
''There's too much order in conceptual art. In India chaos is
complete; a rigid mentality wouldn't work there. You have to accept the
melody of impermanence; that life is messy. The recent Surat plague and
Baroda floods demonstrated that.''
Art with feeling? So is it purely a female thing? Harper's Compass
exhibition, Angels Wear Silver, of expressionist oils and drawings
inspired by her Indian experiences, comes close on the heels of Helen
Flockhart's impressive show at the same gallery, which explored the
psychological inscapes of relationships, some with a bittersweet,
dreamlike quality. ''I hope people respond to my work like they would to
music, inwardly, from the soul,'' says Flockhart.
The women graduated from Glasgow School of Art within a year of each
other in the mid-1980s. By 1987/8 Harper was exhibiting in group shows
conveniently titled The Glasgow Girls which also included Margaret
Hunter, Karen Strang, and Mary McLean. The girls never enjoyed the same
attention of the same generation of boys, but the label did give them a
national springboard.
Harper went off to Oslo, then London 1989-93, and left for Baroda in
1993 on a two-year Commonwealth scholarship. Now she's teaching
part-time at GSA. India gave her ''an astonishing, humbling education,''
jolted her into new perspectives and taught her to appreciate warmth,
generosity, and hospitality despite the nearness of poverty and death.
Harper, a most articulate artist, explains: ''Tenderness is necessary
when looking at people. Before I went to India nature in its raw state
appeared to me as if across a crowded room, neatly parcelled behind a
glass cabinet. There it seemed two inches from my nose.''
Her pictures include the more obvious images of the country, but I
prefer her more abstracted charcoal drawings with their compelling but
ambivalent unity of wild destruction and metamorphosis. In Grief, yellow
flowers float from the corpse like the spirit emanating from the body,
the start of an inventive philosophical use of pattern which, if not
quite resolved as yet, opens up interesting ideas.
In Goddess With Knife and Roses and Temple Where Love Dreams Are Made,
Harper uses repetitive patterns as a visual example of how we too often
adopt the easy formula, thereby limiting ourselves. ''My patterns are a
metaphor for that recipe for happiness which offers cosy comfort.
Patterns are impersonal, contained, blueprints -- but they inhibit
dreams. If one does not dream one becomes a monster.''
One large oil, Burning Woman, stems from a horrific incident when her
neighbour was burned to death, allegedly by her husband. ''Death by
burning -- a supposed oil-cooking accident -- is not uncommon in India
where daughters-in-law without adequate dowries are treated like
servants or conveniently wiped out; in fact murdered.
''I saw my neighbour run screaming, naked and peeled and red, from the
house, her hair a frizzy mess. It was the middle of the night. We put a
wet sheet round her and took her to hospital. She took six days to die.
''The police refused to take a statement from me and the Indians were
afraid to speak out. In the painting I put her on top of a building with
smoke coming from her head with the city tinged totally blood red.
Meanwhile there are pockets of life going on as normal, that will
continue after she's gone.''
0 This is a difficult show; it is not pretty or easy, but it aims to
say something important. As yet Harper's message comes across best in
her writings and her teachings -- but I am absolutely sure that with
both Harper and Flockhart we are witnessing the maturing of two
important Scottish artists.
* Harper's show runs at Glasgow's Compass Gallery till November 15.
Flockhart's pictures can be seen by appointment.

AT Edinburgh's Fruitmarket Gallery in two crate-sized boxes,
nineteenth-century Koreans face nineteenth-century Scots. On a sheet of
glass, which carries the reflected Scots over into the Korean space,
artist Cho Duck-Hyun has written the words ''Gleg at the uptak''.
''Quick on the uptake'' -- what the Edinburgh traveller Isabella L Bird
wrote of the Koreans in 1894. Indeed.
We can never reach a point of absolute or even adequate knowledge from
which we can, finally, begin to consider an artwork, though we keep on
trying. If the work is an old master, we attempt to discover that
mythical beast, ''the sixteenth-century viewer'' to help our
understanding.
If the work was painted yesterday, in the street we live in, we
imagine that we need a massive amount of biographical information about
the artist. We are always delaying looking. Always telling ourselves
that understanding lies outside it. But all understanding must
ultimately spring from looking even if to look is always also to
misunderstand, to recreate for oneself meanings that have never been
stable.
In looking at the work of the Korean artists represented in
Information and Reality, we are confronted by a series of combinations
-- of what is familiar -- the lingua franca of contemporary art, the
image climate of multi-national capitalism, what is familiar, but
familiar as exotic -- the signifiers of ''Asia'' which we would notice
and buy into as tourists such as ''Buddhism'' or ''costume'' or the
''exquisite''; and a cultural and political context strange to us which
we can read about but not share.
Co-curator Yongwoo Lee's catalogue helpfully explores many of these
issues of context and origin and interrelation. And, even more
importantly, it illustrates other work by the artists represented here,
which allows us to grasp the precise context of, for example, Kim
Soo-Ja's quiet intervention in the cafe area.
What becomes absolutely clear is that we are offered here work by
major artists, using video, installation and performance. I was
particularly struck by Ahn Sung-Keum's halved Buddhist, Lee Bul's I Am A
Friendly Asian Woman, Oh Sang-Gyel's installation The Prisoners' Hair,
Moon Beom's Blossom and Possession, and Jheon Soo-Cheon's Tou 1.

THE first thing to say about the performance on Saturday night of the
Liverpool Oratorio, co-written by Paul McCartney and Carl Davis, and
conducted by the latter, is this: it was the wrong work in the right
place at the wrong time.
From every point of view -- the nature and style of the piece, and the
type of audience at which it might have been aimed -- this music should
have been a summer Prom concert. It almost certainly would have reached
a bigger audience, and it would have been more appropriate to the
eclectic crowd that tends to gather for the Proms.
As it was, the presence of the Oratorio in the heart of the winter
season decimated the audience. Most of the RSNO diehards simply didn't
turn up. Upstairs, there wasn't too bad a crowd; downstairs there were
acres of empty space.
I have to say that I didn't find the work quite as cringe-worthy as
some (whose views were explicit). The music is very light and
accessible, becoming embarrassing only when it gets really pretentious
-- as at the end when it attempts to invoke the shades of Mahler
(symphonies number two and eight, for reference).
Those moments apart, the work is full of really quite attractive
melodies. Some of them are very McCartney, so if -- like me -- you spent
the sixties living and loving his stuff, then that perhaps explains why
I didn't find it as excruciating as some obviously did.
Additionally, the performance itself featured some first-class
singing, beautifully articulated by the RSNO Chorus and Junior Chorus,
with superb and committed performances from the top-notch team of
soloists: treble Tommy Williams, Rosa Mannion, Christine Cairns, Paul
Charles Clarke, and Gerald Finley.

WELL, you can't knock success. As one who questioned the concept of
classical music concerts for kids when the Children's Music Foundation
was launched a few years back (I think I said it was archaic and not
viable), I'm still eating my hat.
The second series opened on Saturday afternoon, and I'll need to order
another bunnet; while there were a few empty seats, another huge crowd
turned out. Actually, it's not just the size of the crowd; it's the buzz
and atmosphere in the place. Few concerts in this genre generate such a
sense of occasion, and, however decrepit you might be, it's infectious
and hard to resist.
Atarah Ben-Tovim, presenting the opening concert, has, admittedly, a
way about her. She's completely over the top, but does command and
involve the attention of the motley crowd (young and old) -- though the
best moment came when one tot vociferously refused to close her eyes and
listen, which disintegrated both audience and orchestra.
The concert formula, which seems to continue working brilliantly, was
the usual race through bleeding chunkettes of light classics from
Strauss's Champagne Polka (complete with bottle) to one of Brahms's
Hungarian Dances. The inclusion of a set of extracts from Stravinsky's
Pulcinella was daring.
And it was appropriate that the orchestra for the first show should be
that of Scottish Opera, stepping straight off the news pages into the
musical limelight. And doubly appropriate that their conductor for the
day should be Scottish Opera's music director, Richard Armstrong, in
rarely-seen unbuttoned mode, and clearly enjoying himself.

AN unusual project and an ambitious venture. But one thing that this
lady deserves, as one of the best female vocalists of our time, is, as
she called them: one hell of a backing band.
Looking better than ever -- thanks to 18 months in a gym and a
beautiful green velvet suit -- Horse MacDonald opened the set with her
two most requested numbers, Careful and Somebody. Could it have been to
prevent the ever-enthusiastic audience from shouting out for their
favourites like they usually do? Or was it to get them on her side,
perhaps with doubts as to whether they would accept her new-found
companions?
Whatever the reason, she did the right thing, and in offering her fans
the ''chance to hear something a bit different'', won their immediate
approval. The Scottish Chamber Orchestra have never played in the
Barrowland ballroom before, and the chances are that the majority there
on Saturday will never have heard them before, but their repertoire was
carefully chosen: well-known pieces such as Barber's Adagio, which film
fans will know as the sad tune from Platoon.
Horse's tastes are as diverse as her talents, shown in her beautiful
verisons of the Gladys Knight classic The Look of Love and Dusty
Springfield's I Close My Eyes, and each song, whether her own or by
someone else's pen, is embraced like a lover: gently caressed, stroked
and teased to a spectacular climax. It takes only one note to send the
appreciative crowd into frenzy, and every single one is undoubtedly
perfect.

MORE social anthropology for the gentle folk of Perth as they're
treated to the second helping of working-class comedy on the trot.
Straight after Willy Russell's portrait of inner-city deprivation in Our
Day Out, director Andrew McKinnon takes us to France and back in John
Godber's two-hander about a low-income, little-travelled couple who win
a magazine holiday competition for a trip to Paris.
Russell and Godber share similar concerns. Both are interested in the
way the underprivileged are denied opportunities, the way lack of
experience circumscribes the imagination, the way poverty affects not
just your pocket but your whole social being. Both writers choose to
treat this material with humour, and both like to believe they're
pitching it at the very people they're writing about.
But it strikes me that where Russell works a theme out until it has a
tremendous dramatic, comedic and emotional power, Godber will merely
tinker with it. There are several moments in April in Paris when you
think he is about to launch us into the meat of an argument, but always
he backs off as if nervous about disturbing us with anything too heavy.
As a result, I frequently find Godber's writing banal, happy to reflect
the language and the life of working-class experience but reluctant to
make very much of it.
Amanda Beveridge and Ian Grieve do a perfectly sound job of bringing
to life this travel-broadens-the-mind tale, give or take the odd
fluctuating accent, and it's gently amusing and economically staged on
Robin Mitchell's essentials-only set. All pleasant enough, except by the
end you don't feel you've travelled nearly as far as the characters.

WILDLY fluctuating though audience numbers these days tend to be, I
was still surprised by the relatively small turnout at last night's
Hallowe'en special by the Glasgow Phil. I tend to be critical about the
longwindedness and verbosity of conductor Iain Sutherland, but he does
have a large catchment area of support for his chat and charm. Even his
presence, however, failed to attract a big crowd last night.
Which was a pity, because the stage of the Royal was treated to a
lavish lighting display (during perfomance) that was entirely
appropriate to the occasion -- deep reds, blues, and opulent green.
Coloured lighting has been used effectively before during concerts, but
this one was bathed in the stuff, adding immeasurably to the atmosphere.
Contributing in a different way was a cadre of special guests -- a
score or so of the Undead -- fully-fledged (fully-fanged?) members of
the Vampyre Society, wisely coralled behind the orchestra, and in for an
appetising aperitif of suitable sounds before flying off for a
late-night bite.
The music, by and large, was apposite, from the spectral and
atmospheric to the chilling and the riotous. What struck me about some
of it -- notably Dukas's Sorcerer's Apprentice, Saint-Saens's Danse
Macabre, and Malcolm Arnold's Tam O'Shanter (the last one receiving an
uproarious performance from the Phil) -- is that these fine pieces seem
to have fallen out of the concert repertoire other than in pop
programmes, shows for kids, or educational programmes. Perhaps they're
passe now. But we do rather take them for granted.
Some of the other music -- Geoffrey Toye's The Haunted Ballroom and
his arrangement from Ruddigore -- was less inspired, but Iain Whyte's
Reel O'Tulloch, complete with whirling bagpipe finale, never misses the
mark.

KATIE Mitchell is a remarkable director. When it comes to intensity,
there is no-one to touch her. But with this production of Euripides's
The Phoenician Women, it is as if she has reached some kind of apogee --
so pure, so simple yet so complete is every aspect of the production.
For two hours we are drawn irrevocably into a suffering so familiar,
so pitiable we could be watching scenes from Bosnia or Rwanda on our TV
screens. Ostensibly about Oedipus and the fates that befall him, his
children and his mother/wife, Jocasta, events are not so much dramatised
as reported -- a living newspaper told through Jocasta's eyes and the
chorus of Phoenician women.
But what momentum Mitchell and her company create as the costs of war
are counted in the grief and sorrow of a mother seeing her sons tearing
each other -- and their community -- apart.
A lamentation for the pity and the horror of war and the pride and
ambition of men, the play in David Thompson's cannily accessible
translation also cries out for a greater altruism. ''If men would only
give, each in his power, their good for the good of all, this world
might suffer less, go forward hoping,'' implores Daniel Goode's tender
young Menoeceus.
In a cast of extraordinary commitment, Lorraine Ashbourne's gritty,
northern Jocasta is a towering, human figure who could have stepped
straight out of Brookside or Coronation Street. As in other Mitchell
productions, the strength too lies in the chorus, male and female --
creators of mood, reflectors of the action and singers who perform with
the beauty and discipline of secular priests. Stunning.

A GENERATION ago it seemed the important battles had been won. The
southern states version of apartheid had been dismantled. Civil rights
legislation heralded by Kennedy but actually enacted by Lyndon Johnston
was firmly in place. America, it appeared, was set to let the scars of
racial division heal and celebrate its wondrous multi-cultural
diversity.
Yet now, in the quintessential melting pot that is New York, the signs
of subterranean tensions breaking through the facade of harmony have
never been more visible. The fact is that almost every facet of life is
now being re-examined in the context of its racial implications.
The most recent and most seismic of these inter-racial eruptions, of
course, were the reactions to the verdict in the O J Simpson trial,
where disbelief in the jury's ''not guilty'' pronouncement was largely
coloured white, while black and brown America took little trouble to
disguise their glee. It was, writ even larger, the mirror image of the
Rodney King affair where white policemen caught beating a black suspect
on video tape were initially freed.
But it has become clear that these are just the most prominent marker
beacons in a much more all-encompassing breakdown in understanding than
anyone could have believed.
Just last week a fresh row broke out over the sentencing policy for
people using cocaine. It was vigorously pointed out that long spells in
jail were the norm for people caught using the subtance known as
''crack'', while people sniffing it recreationally in powder form were
invariably treated leniently.
The largely white US judiciary claimed this was a logical way to clean
up neighbourhoods terrorised by crack dealers. Largely, black critics
pointed out that the result was that most people winding up in jail were
black, and most evading a custodial sentence were white despite both
being caught with the same drug.
Then there was the protracted fever over the arithmetic of the grand
march.
Louis Farrakhan, self-appointed high priest of the reborn black
radical Islamic movement, claimed his Million Man March on the
government houses in Washington was just that. Police and park
authorities, and TV stations, made the head count considerably less. The
argument ran unabated for days and resulted in an agreement to play back
TV tapes using the most sophisticated aids available to come up with new
estimates.
The numbers game, it seemed, was a very important virility symbol for
Mr Farrakhan as he sought to convince black America that integration is
a mug's game played by losers. The alarming thing about this bow-tied
prophet is not just his chilling history of anti-Semitism and misogyny
dressed up as female protection, but his skilful ability to mix sound
advice with the worst kind of separatist demagoguery.
So when he says that black men should stop being victims, should major
on self-reliance, should get back to their neighbourhoods and get wired
into social and economic reconstruction; should pay their bills and love
their families, he preaches a gospel with which few people could
disagree.
The problem is that there is a sub text, and it is not savoury. A
writer in the New York press this last week had the wit to surf the
Internet to seek out the home pages of both Mr Farrakhan's Nation of
Islam, and groups led by the white far right. Both revealed a remarkable
similarity in their prejudices. Both had anti-Jewish material, both
regarded the emancipation of women as a dangerous development, and, most
significantly, both favoured the re-drawing of the American map to
create all-white and all-black states.
A few years ago, perhaps even a few months ago, all of this could have
been dismissed as the loopier ends of the political spectrum whose
matching set of intolerant demands could be assumed unlikely to impinge
on mainstream consciousness. And indeed much of it is still unthinkable.
But there are enough straws in the American wind to make you feel it's
essential for the US to put out these increasingly frequent brush fires
before they flame out of control. Already the radical white right has
gained real political muscle and is well enough funded to throw money at
any candidate who will espouse its brand of simplistic certainties.
Meanwhile Louis Farrakhan has demonstrated a appeal wider than anyone
could have envisaged. Neither is that appeal just to poor blacks who
feel disenfranchised from the American dream as they lose out on jobs,
homes, and health care. Day after day after the march middle-class
blacks queued up to testify that while they might have no truck with his
more fanciful political pronouncements, the Islamic leader had allowed
them for the first time to be open about their own feelings. To admit
after years of pretence and apparent assimilation that they still felt
essentially second-class citizens in a country where they paid the same
taxes as anyone else.
So while their heads told them that Johnnie Cochran going over the top
in a court room or Louis Farrakhan ranting from a podium was bound to be
counterproductive in a world striving for racial harmony, their heart
could not be restrained from giving two cheers for the guys sticking it
memorably to whitey.
Nobody who hasn't suffered from racial intolerance or discrimination,
nobody who hasn't been patronised on account of their skin colour or
their roots will ever be able to understand that paradox fully. But
nobody who hasn't suffered should miss the message that we ignore that
disenchantment at our peril.
In the sixties black America thought that riding on the front of the
bus would be enough to file the years of prejudice safely in the history
books. Now some have concluded that if they don't get a shot at driving
as well, that divide will never really heal and they might just as well
run a rival service.
It's not a route likely to be taken by General Colin Powell as he
looks increasingly certain to start the race to be the first black
President. He has already distanced himself from both white and black
fundamentalism. And he too is a black icon with charismatic appeal. But
also a black man accused of submerging his birthright to win white
approval. The cure for thinking British politics is complex is
invariably a week in the States tuning in to the transatlantic variety.

IAN FLEMING.
Andrew Lycett.
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, #20
THE Bond phenomenon didn't begin with a gold-plated typewriter in a
Jamaican pad, but with a quill in a Dundee counting house. Robert
Fleming, a clerk from that city's slums, developed the concept of
investment trusts, forerunners of unit trusts, so that small investors
could participate in companies' growth. He crossed the Atlantic several
times a year by fast liner to push his democratic business plan in the
new world where the railways (the investors' dream) were dispossessing
the native American.
From the Victoria era onwards, wealth, even from despised trade, could
buy you into society. The residence Robert built in brick in Oxfordshire
had 44 bedrooms, with a plaque on the front wall affirming the family
motto: ''Let the deed shaw''.
This was the wet-nursed world Ian Fleming was born into in 1908, the
second son of Valentine, Robert's son, a serving soldier, and Evelyn St
Croix Rose, a solicitor's daughter. Andrew Lycett describes her as
''frivolous, snobbish, and vain''.
Val had acquired the estate of Arnisdale in Argyll for the stalking.
Eve claimed that the ''wild Roses'' were true Highlanders, unlike the
parvenu Lowland Flemings, and she dressed Ian and his brothers in Rose
tartan kilts. It didn't enhance his love of Scotland, and his memory of
Arnisdale was of ''all those dripping evergreens''.
At Eton (where else for Eve?) Fleming excelled athletically but not
academically. He entered Sandhurst, but after he caught gonorrhoea in
Soho Eve despaired of him becoming an officer and a gentleman. She
pushed for a place for him in the Foreign Office, but though he passed
the exam he wasn't admitted. He had a good tutor in his mother in
exploiting social connections, and she made him write to the head of
Reuters to beg a job. He also learnt from her that sex could be
exploited. Eve wanted a child by Augustus John, perhaps for the artistic
genes, and Amaryllis was the result.
Since leaving Eton Fleming had spent his ample spare time at house
parties in the shires and in chalets in Switzerland with society
friends. No wonder so many Scots despise the English upper classes,
finding the literature that emerged from their activities so alien and
offensive.
This biography drips with the names of the rich and socially superior:
dense aristocrats, power-driven newspaper barons like Rothermere and
Beaverbrook, quintessential English belles like Joyce Grenfell, the
obnoxious Evelyn Waugh, the deviants, the kept poets. When Ian wearied
of London there was the prime 90,000 acre Black Mount deer forest in
Argyll which Robert Fleming rented in 1924 and later bought outright
from the financially embarrassed Breadalbanes.
Ian Fleming had been to Russia for Reuters in 1933. He returned in
1939, meeting Fitzroy Maclean, a junior diplomat in the British Embassy
in Moscow. When ''nice young Mr Fleming'' was invited to dinner by a
minister's wife, ''Maclean went to Ian's hotel room and found him in bed
with a young lady from Odessa. The young diplomat returned to the
minister's wife with the reply that Ian was sorry he could not accept
her invitation as he was ''very, very busy''.
The Second World War gave these hedonistic young people a focus for
their energies. England's ''green and pleasant land'' seen from a
country house ha-ha had to be defended. Ian's father Val had fallen in
France in 1917. Lycett writes: ''Within the Fleming family the
respectful eulogies soon gave way to hagiography.
''Val became the paragon of manly virtues. The boys learned to finish
their nightly prayers with the words, '. . . and please, dear God, help
me to grow up to be more like Mokie'.''
Fleming knew Europe through his travels, and had studied German in
Munich. He joined naval intelligence and had, as they say, a good war.
He devised a strategy to help break the German code system and save our
shipping from the U-boats. If he and a few others could don some German
uniforms and wait in a boat in the Channel, pretending to have ditched
from a bomber, a rescue boat would come to pick them up. The British
could then overpower the Germans and capture the boat and the latest
German code books it would be carrying.
After the war Fleming worked as foreign manager of Kemsley Newspapers.
He had interests in other papers as well, particularly the Daily Mail,
because he was cuckolding the proprietor Lord Rothermere. For 15 years
Fleming had refused to marry Rothermere's ruthlessly ambitious wife
Anne, even after Lord O'Neill, her first husband, was killed in the war.
They continued a passionate relationship which resulted in their
marriage only after Anne had become pregnant by Fleming for a second
time.
Fleming built a house on Jamaica called Goldeneye, and spent a
considerable time there. It was a popular island, particularly for
expatriate pederasts. Angus Wilson's lover wore his mother's pearls, and
Noel Coward wrote lyrics there. Coward didn't like Anne, who was growing
apart from Fleming. The darling of London's cocktail set complained: ''I
am really surprised that Ian doesn't sock her in the chops and tell her
to shut up.'' Anne had marks enough already, since Fleming was a
flagellater of women. He fell for Blanche Blackwell, and Anne found
solace in the inept arms of Hugh Gaitskill, the Labour leader.
It was on Jamaica that Fleming wrote his first Bond novel, Casino
Royale, and bought himself the gold-plated typewriter. But the book was
no overnight success. Fleming bowed and scraped to his acquaintances. He
primed the newspaper owners as well as the book critics to promote the
Bond stories, and keep pushing for the big film deal. Sean Connery was
the first Bond. ''Ian remained equivocal about the choice; he was not
sure if a working-class Scotsman had the social graces to play his
hero.''
This biography links the Bond stories to Fleming's own life. In From
Russia with Love, Bond flies across the Alps and sees himself again, ''a
young man in his teens, with the leading end of the rope round his waist
. . .'' Bond's code number, 007, was based on naval intelligence's great
triumph in the First World War in breaking German diplomatic code.
Fleming, like Bond, was obsessed with firearms. James Bond was the
author of the 1947 Macmillan edition of The Field Guide to Birds of the
West Indies bought by Fleming to amuse his guests at Goldeneye.
At the end, having made so much money, Fleming wasn't a happy man. He
used to slink upstairs to avoid his wife's soirees, an admission that he
had wasted his life among unworthy people whose talents have been
inflated out of all proportion by each other. Caspar, only child of
Fleming and Anne, could have featured in a Bond story.
He developed an obsession with guns and, drug dependent, committed
suicide.
They made the right noises when Fleming died, until, as Lycett
recalls, Malcolm Muggeridge described Ian as ''an Etonian Micky
Spillane, the creator of a shadowy and unreal character who was
''utterly despicable; obsequious to his superiors, pretentious in his
tastes, callous and brutal in his ways, with strong undertones of
sadism, and an unspeakable cad in his relations with women, towards whom
sexual appetite represents the only approach''.
Muggeridge was right about Fleming. In a book that is much too long
for such an unworthy subject at least Andrew Lycett is not obsequious.

EVENTS are closing in on the Government. There could still be 18
months to go till the next General Election but its plight looks
increasingly desperate.
Mr Major won the last contest with his party between four points
behind or one point in front of Labour, depending on which opinion poll
you read. The Tories are currently 29% or 30% behind. It is rather a lot
of ground to make up and more voters now think Labour is the moderate
party and expect it to win.
When I mentioned events I did not just mean things like the Scott
Report which the judge will doubtless finally manage to produce some
time in 1996. The Government has, I think, prepared a heavyweight
counterattack on its findings concentrating on the way Lord Scott
conducted the proceedings and the naive way it expects him to comment on
the handling of policy. Whether this succeeds or not the average voter,
who may not be preoccupied with the niceties of an exceedingly complex
argument, will probably just see rather a lot of Ministers in trouble
and could also be unimpressed with the spectacle of perhaps several of
them protesting they have no intention of resigning even if, in fact,
they are right to say this.
Rail privatisation is looking quite likely to live up to the
expectations of one of its Tory critics, the late Robert Adley, who said
it would prove ''a poll tax on wheels''. Some Tories, maybe even some
Ministers, must be torn between hoping that Commissioner Kinnock may
find a last-minute way of thwarting the sale and saving them from
further public relations nightmares and fear that, if he does, the
Chancellor will find it even harder to find things to give away in his
1996 Budget.
The desperate hunt for cash from sell-offs of almost anything goes on.
The family silver has all been disposed of or pledged. Harassed
Ministers are virtually down to holding boot sales of what is left. As
Her Majesty's Stationery Office is not, unfortunately, nailed down they
are planning to sell that. This is all in the name of tax cuts. Mr
Portillo has played the patriotic card, Mr Howard the law and order one.
Mr Major will wrap himself in the folds of our unwritten constitution.
But many think that only hard cash will do the trick. Hence the scraping
of every Whitehall barrel as Mr Clarke seeks ways of returning to voters
a respectable amount of their own money.
Much has been made recently of the Tory lurch to the right and in some
respects that is correct. But on tough issues like the social security
budget the Government will only succeed in making gestures. These will
sustain Labour's charges of meanness without making any radical
curtailment of that budget at all. That will have to wait for a Blair
government. In health and education Mr Major will promise extra spending
even if some of it is promised, like more tax cuts, after an election he
is unlikely to win.
The sense of a Government flailing around looking for ways of heading
off impending nemesis grows weekly at Westminster. The exodus of Tory
MPs for retirement, another career, or a, hopefully, safer seat is the
best indication of what they think is going to happen.
My own view, and I acknowledge that Mr Major proved several pundits
wrong in 1992, is that what the Tories have left to fight for is the
50-60 seats that will make the difference between defeat and disaster.
Labour has been on the crest of the wave for so long now that some of
its members are worried that it cannot possibly last another 18 months
and that something will go terribly wrong at the worst possible moment.
The Tories can yet mount a useful counterattack based on a Labour
sell-out to Europe, jobs lost through adoption of the Social Chapter,
alleged secret deals with the unions, restriction of choice in
education, Labour's supposed lust for raising taxes, and so on. With a
firm Labour promise of a Scottish parliament if it wins Mr Major may
find defence of the Union plays well in England if not Scotland. A good
campaign can jack up the Tory vote well above its current derisory poll
levels.
But the last Tory conference, which was supposed to produce a stream
of radical new policies, delivered instead tired or minor variants on
the present lot. Some Ministers, not least the Chancellor, who has most
cause, seem fed up. Others, like Mr Forsyth in Scotland, show all the
enthusiasm of new brooms, although the Scottish Secretary has yet to
demonstrate that frantic activity amounts to a strategy. However, I
imagine he will enjoy himself as we plunge ever deeper into the detail
of the Opposition's constitutional proposals.
Though of the first importance for Scotland and, indeed, the Union,
they will not dominate or decide the next election. That will be done by
voters, as willing to see the back of this Major Government as they were
the last one, deciding whether or not they can trust the other lot.
Some Tory Ministers may be hoping that Miss Short's public musings on
a policy issue completely unconnected with her Shadow Cabinet portfolio,
will be followed by similar gaffes. Coupled with Mr Straw's conspicuous
failure to destroy Mr Howard and Mr Blair's poorly judged attempt to
help him, it has done something to cheer them on their return to
Westminster.
Perhaps, if Dr Cunningham is daft enough to promise that Labour will
cap the National Lottery jackpot at #1m, the Tories would find their
support in the country swelling. But he won't. Miss Short is almost
certainly that swallow that doesn't make a summer. If the public give
the Chancellor's Budget the thumbs down next month Mr Major, who has
already led as many counterattacks as Field Marshal Haig in the First
World War, will be, like him at one point, in danger of running out of
ammunition.

MICHAEL FORSYTH came to Europe last week and, in the words of W S
Gilbert, did nothing in particular and did it very well. His visit was
so brief that we blinked and missed him.
For the first time in his role as Secretary of State for Scotland Mr
Forsyth was attending the Council of Ministers. He is an old hand at
these gatherings, of course, but in the past his appearances have been
in the role of junior minister in other departments.
On this occasion he was in Luxembourg (this being October when the
council escapes Brussels for a month) as a fully-fledged member of the
Cabinet. His task was to help decide how to police the EU's fisheries
agreement with Spain and Portugal as the Iberian fleets head for the
fishing grounds off western Britain and Ireland.
The unwritten agenda was less obvious. He was there to score a point
on the Scottish domestic political scene, particularly over the SNP. Mr
Forsyth is far less a European than his immediate predecessor, Ian Lang,
whose first speech in the job was devoted to making Scotland
''proactive'' in Europe and whose legacy is the Scotland Europa Centre
in Brussels.
But, like Mr Lang, Mr Forsyth is a staunch defender of the Union (the
one with England) and he came determined to demonstrate that Scotland's
position in the United Kingdom gives us direct and influential access to
the EU's top table. Hence he took care to announce in advance he would
be taking his seat in the community's most powerful decision-making
institution. This was his answer to nationalists who complain that
Scottish ministers are there only once in a blue moon and then only for
show.
By Mr Forsyth's side for the talks was Mr Tony Baldry, the fisheries
minister, whose writ runs, to all intents and purposes, only in England
and Wales. Mr Forsyth on the other hand was there to represent the Scots
fishing fleets which take three-quarters of the entire UK annual catch.
So who had most at stake?
Seeking after truth, as ever, your reporter inquired of the lady from
the Scottish Information Office if Mr Forsyth, being the Cabinet ranker,
would be doing the speaking or would it be his subordinate? She looked
uncomfortable and replied firmly that the two ministers were ''in
partnership''. The cautious spokesman from the UK permanent
representation in Brussels had obviously had his card marked and
appeared disapproving of the question. The man from the ministry in
London looked blank.
Well, let the record show that Mr Forsyth returned to Scotland having
signed up for an evidently much better deal than most of the Scottish
fishing fleet had hoped for. The fishermen said so themselves. But there
is rather more to it. The record also shows that he said nothing. The
talking -- and not much of it at that -- was done by Mr Baldry despite
being new to the job and plainly in deep difficulty with the
technicalities of the brief, witness his confusion about what it would
mean for British (mainly English) and Irish fishermen in the Irish Box.
Mr Forsyth briefly met fishermen's leaders, did some quick networking
with his ministerial colleagues, and hopped on the plane back home.
But he will be able to claim truthfully that he attended a council and
fought Scotland's corner at the top table -- and in a way he did just
that.
I recall Mr Lang in his day as Scottish Secretary on one of these
trips to Europe. He arrived with, if memory serves, Gillian Shephard who
did all the talking. Mr Lang's only contribution, we were told later,
was to allow himself to be seen on the telly at the top table during a
break in the proceedings. In fairness it is also true that Mr Lang and
Sir Hector Monro, in his day as a Scottish Office fisheries minister,
have been known to attend council meetings where they represented the
whole of the United Kingdom.
While Mr Forsyth was in Luxembourg the Scots Euro-MPs in Strasbourg
were at war again. The two SNP members, in patriot mode, were smarting
at the failure of their six Labour colleagues (nowadays always known
contemptuously as Labour's Unionists) to attend a celebration of the
700th anniversary of the Auld Alliance. The Labour Euro-MPs said they
had not been invited and, anyway, it was just an SNP stunt. The truth,
as usual, lies somewhere in between.
Other simmering disputes, including a legal action raised by Mrs
Winnie Ewing over Labour criticisms of her voting record, have helped to
sour the atmosphere as never before between the only two Scottish
parties represented in Strasbourg.
Altogether an uninspiring week in Europe for Scotland. There must be a
better way.

Controversial author and journalist Maureen Freely believes that the
women's movement is well able to withstand criticism. Which is just as
well for, as Sue Innes discovers, she has much to say about it.
I was supposed to shut up, to sink back into the ghetto where mothers
never discuss politics.
IT WAS getting more complicated by the minute. First I was to do a
reading at James Thin's main Edinburgh bookshop from my own book. Then
that was changed to ''an event'' along with Maureen Freely who, I was
told neither tactfully nor truthfully, was bringing out a book along
much the same lines as mine. Then I was asked to interview her.
Furthermore I was feeling cross with her.
It is so easy to knock feminism. Accuse it of what you like; of
neglecting mothers -- as she does -- or going mushy about mothers,
appealing only to community workers, overlooking race and class and
sexuality, being in thrall to sexuality, making women victims, making
women aggressive, to take a few recent examples.
Because it is no one movement with no one line to sign up to you can
find chapter and verse to back any account, and the opposite. And, like
others who begin in knocking mode, Freely then says we need good
childcare, better employment protection, decent pay . . . Now where have
I heard that before? Surely not from some feminist?
And she'd probably roll right over me, I thought. Only the previous
week she'd called Naomi Wolf a loudmouth with a B-grade brain; she later
said herself, she's ''not a particularly tolerant person''. As a writer
her certainty makes me feel mealy-mouthed, reasonable to excess. And not
only that she has four children, aged from 16 to two, via two
relationships, plus two stepchildren, so must know more about almost
everything than me.
Even more infuriating, when I met her I liked her. Thinner than it's
fair for a multiparent to be at 42, she is a nervy, troubled, friendly
American ex-pat with a raw edge to her voice, more thoughtful and
tentative in person than in print. Born in New Jersey (in the next town
to Bruce Springsteen) she was brought up in Turkey where her physicist
father taught, but has lived in England for 20 years, on and off, and
knows how we feel about being lectured to by Americans.
She is, though, playing it both ways. By her account deeply committed
to feminism -- ''I know who to blame and it isn't us'' -- she also says
the way the book's been picked up in the media has made it seem more of
an attack than it is. She cannot, however, be unaware that saying
feminism's got it all wrong has a strong appeal to many editors. To me
she's the good feminist who wants only to advance debate, but to the
Daily Mail she's someone who stands up for mums against misguided people
-- well, like me.
''By reducing procreation to the status of a costly optional extra,''
she says, ''the women's movement has left mothers in the lurch.''
Hang on -- who has done that? Nothing to do, it seems, with the cold
winds blowing through the global economy, competition, long hours and
pressures of work, absent fathers, 16 years of Tory Government, the
erosion of the welfare state, the limited respect in our culture for the
work of bringing up children and its ambivalence towards children . . .
Freely is right, however, to say the second-wave women's movement is
surely mature enough to withstand criticism -- nor will it thrive
without it. There's method in her approach; not just an angry rant, but
an intentionally angry rant. ''It's deliberately intemperate -- you
don't wake up people who are sleep-walking without some raw emotion or
root out a deep-seated prejudice by being meek.''
The feminism she attacks is one in which ''abortion has come to be
celebrated as our single most important right''. From my perspective it
isn't -- my copy of her book is already peppered with exclamation marks
and ''not true''. But set up that definition and it is straightforward
to show it as narrow and negative and anti-maternal. Equally, to
selectively quote Simone de Beauvoir's contempt for childbearing women
as ''fowls with high production'' and Germaine Greer's youthful dreams
of a counterculture farmhouse where children could roam wild and the
neuroses of possessive parenting be avoided, makes a case which is
extremely one-sided and limited.
Feminism as so defined consists of a handful of writers and her
friends in London media-land, inclined to ''sigh and roll their
eyeballs'' when she mentions anything as un-post-modern as kids. See it
that way, then campaigning for improved employment rights for part-time
workers, for extended maternity rights, for the right to stay in the
family home after separation caused by violence, for child benefit to be
paid to mothers and for one parent benefit, and (less successfully) for
more and better childcare -- all of which put maternal realities in
centre-frame -- can be conveniently overlooked.
But, she said, it is a personal case. ''These are the books that
influenced me and I felt personally betrayed -- they'd sent me in a
direction and following their advice I ended up undervalued again.''
Writing it she realised that the feeling of betrayal was as much to do
with her own psychological make up, and her relationship with her mother
-- ''why did I feel I couldn't talk back to them? Why did I expect so
much of them?'' Why, you want to add, didn't she know that theory needs
to be tempered with experience?
The book is the story of finding that out; an autobiography with life,
novels, loves, and births interspersed with criticisms of the
''femstars'' who led her astray.
It is her ''report from the trenches'' -- 16 years bringing up
children and working, (in succession) as wife, stay-at-home worker,
working mother, single parent, unmarried mother, stepmother, sole
breadwinner for a family of eight -- and member of (though I'm still
trying to untangle the simile) a ''generation of warrior guinea-pigs''.
I found it in equal parts infuriating, entertaining, and self-indulgent.
Where I find her argument most interesting is the suggestion that the
generational problems in feminism, the problems of inheritance and
continuity, are mother and daughter problems: ''The promise of feminism
was that you don't have to become your mother.''
So what happens when you become a mother? Feminism is, she suggests,
''a cult of Lost Girls''. Family-free utopias (in her sights now is
cyber-feminism) ''satisfy a need that active, real-world feminism cannot
meet. This is the need not to grow up''.
But if growing up means settling down to cleaning the loo, pairing
socks and finding lost homework books, don't they have a case?
Her ideal, she says, would be part of our time in ''the realm of
necessity'', part of it in the ''agora'', the abstract realm of thought
and debate -- but taking to it a concrete understanding ''of what it is
to be tied down, responsible for other people''.
We need somewhere new, poised between domesticity and autonomy, and
the ability to think about yourself ''without staying as selfish as a
16-year-old''. A wholesale reconsideration of the value of unpaid work
is in order, she thinks, and it's a role in society, as well as
families. ''It is not just a women's issue, but unless this comes from
feminism it's not going to happen.''
We need, she believes, ''to look at this prejudice against talk of
nurseries and day care and maternal leave and quarrels over what fathers
can and cannot do, and look at the larger picture, at what children need
from their parents, and what parents need for themselves and their
children, at patterns of paid work and unpaid work, as they exist now,
and as they could become if things were arranged in such a way that all
people who worked for pay had enough time left over for their unpaid
responsibilities.
Which is also her reply to the Independent on Sunday editor who cut
her column when she refused to learn that ''mothers don't talk about
politics'' and said she must choose between writing seriously, and
therefore for an audience ''who did not want to hear about mothers'', or
writing for mothers who were, he said, ''interested in shopping, and
clothes and child psychology and affairs of the heart.
''I was supposed to give in and shut up, to sink back into the ghetto
where mothers never discuss politics.'' There was never any serious
possibility of that.

BEWARE the nursery school which sends your child home with a request
to look after the resident livestock, either for the weekend or just
overnight. Being asked to give Samantha the Snail -- who came complete
with a converted Chicken Tonight jar, a couple of lettuce leaves and a
piece of paper -- houseroom for a weekend seemed like child's play.
But we had no idea of the trauma that would ensue when Mary, aged
four, and totally taken by her new nursery school mornings, discovered
the squashed remains of Samantha, lying, splintered shell and slightly
twitching body tissue, outside our back door.
Worse still, the imprint of our 19-year-old's walking boots, and the
tell-tale marks of his bike tyres spelled out all too clearly how
Samantha had met her untimely end: it had been a crunch and run
accident.
What you have to realise is that livestock, kept in humane conditions
in nursery schools, exerts an enormous influence on the hearts and minds
of the pupils.
Mary, in her first term at nursery, has become a snail expert. She
wears a snail badge, draws pictures of the creatures and, much to the
horror of our teenage boys, picks up examples of the species in the
garden, or in the country, and pontificates about them.
You can have no idea of just how lovable the slimy creatures that eat
the leaves of our best garden plants can be.
And when Samantha came home, Mary took her for ''walks''. These
started on the lettuce leaves beside the jar, spread, with resultant
silvery trail all over our carpet, for Samantha proved to be
turbo-charged.
You came to doubt all the claims made by the protagonists of pre-five
education, as you watched your hitherto sensible daughter, conversing
earnestly with a snail.
But, when Samantha made her last ''walk'', before being squashed for
all time, Mary fully expected the snail to take a trip round the garden,
and to return, on a voluntary basis, to her jar, ready to be carried
back to nursery on Monday morning.
But it was not to be. Mary stood in floods of tears. What would she
tell the nursery? What would she tell the other members of the Samantha
Fan Club? And, what about poor Samantha?
I did what every parent has to do in these circumstances. I got a
shovel, scraped up the remains, and, with full approval of Mary,
committed Samantha RIP back to the garden earth from which all snails
spring.
And, then, after a quick hunt round the garden, three fine snails were
enrolled in the nursery school, by giving them house room in the Chicken
Tonight jar recently vacated by the late Samantha.
But there is a lesson here. Replacing a snailwas easy. But what if the
livestock brought home is a hamster or some other furry friend?
My advice to anyone considering giving houseroom to nursery beasties
is stop and think. Can you shoulder the responsibility of being the
parent of the child in whose home the nursery pet met an untimely end?
And, most of all, check to see what's coming next term.
In Mary's nursery it's dinosaurs, difficult to give houseroom to as
guests. But at least you couldn't stand on one without hearing about it.
You have been warned.

ALL I can say is, it seemed a good idea at the time. Wiser heads might
have deemed it inadvisable, if not downright reckless, even to
contemplate a two-day holiday in a caravan, in October, in the rain, in
a spot so far-flung that the journey itself took half the available
time, with a gaggle of ailing children.
But on that dreich afternoon, with the children wondering dolefully
why it was that everybody, absolutely everybody in their class would be
going away somewhere and they were always stuck at home, I found myself
impulsively ringing up a carvan park in deepest Argyllshire and booking
us in the next day.
I washed clothes until midnight, arranged a complicated dog-feeding
and key-hiding routine with my mother, restrained the children's
attempts to pack their entire worldly goods and, more ominously,
administered Calpol to the eldest who was looking a bit flushed. For the
first time, a little bubble of doubt broke the surface of my enthusiasm.
I ignored it.
The next morning, two things became clear. One was that you need as
much gear for a two-day expedition with five children as you do for a
month, and possibly a year. The second was that the eldest was ill,
probably with the same throat infection for which No 4 was currently
working his way through a bottle of penicillin. Off he went to the
doctor, while I continued to assemble enough supplies for an assault on
K2.
I packed: two bags of bed-linen, one bag of towels, two bags of
rain-wear, one bag of wellingtons, one large bag with clothes for four
children, one small bag with clothes for two grown-ups, one enormous bag
with clothes for one baby plus nappies, wet-wipes, nappy-sacs and bottom
cream, one travel cot, one buggy, one baby walker, one bag of assorted
rattles, one bottle-steriliser, a selection of toys, Beano annuals,
cuddly animals and cash-boxes, one bag of games, one box of food, one
box of baby-food along with baby-milk, baby-plates and baby-spoons, two
rugs, one box of medicines including penicillin, Calpol, Calpol
Six-Plus, gripe-water, eczema cream and asthma inhalers, one nebuliser
in case of asthma emergency, two packets of tissues, a bumper bag of
crisps and one book for me.
This little lot was awaiting my husband when he and No 1 returned from
the doctor's armed with yet another prescription for Erythroped.
''We can't possibly need all that stuff,'' he groaned. I challenged
him to remove anything we could conceivably do without, bearing in mind
that it had started to rain and would probably do so for the next two
days.
''Right, I will.'' He strode to the teetering pile, cast a keen eye
over it, barked a few questions about contents, and finally removed the
baby-walker. He then added -- added, mark you -- some reading material
of his own (oh the unquenchable optimism of this couple) and a flask of
whisky which he placed with exaggerated tenderness in among the nappies.
He began to load the car in the driving rain.
It was at this point that the five-year-old, who had been absorbed in
writing a story at the kitchen table, announced that she too had a sore
throat. Sure enough, it proved to be as red and raw as the others, and
her forehead was hot. This is undoubtedly the moment at which we should
have aborted the mission, and I opened my mouth to say so. But just then
I happened to glance at her essay. It began: ''We are goowing fro ar
holl'days AND I think ti will BE fun.''
I melted. I reasoned that they might as well all be ill in a caravan
as at home. I missed the moment. And frankly, anyone with that degree of
sentimentality on top of the terminal impulsiveness which launched the
adventure in the first place, deserves the kind of holiday we ended up
with.
Anyway, I phoned the doctor for advice and he said the latest invalid
could share the penicillin until we got back. He wished us, without a
trace of irony, a happy holiday.
So we set off in the driving rain, with one child convalescent, one
confirmed ill, one heading that way, one suspiciously sneezy baby and --
let's count our blessings -- the family asthmatic rather smugly oozing
health. Three-quarters of the day was gone already and we had a
three-hour drive ahead.
''So. Seven hours after we planned to leave and by jove, we've made it
to Anniesland,'' said my husband, sounding just a shade brittle, as we
parked outside the chemist to collect the prescription. ''I know. How
about when we get back there we unpack, then I'll have a cup of tea and
start packing again.''
We got there in the end, and I would love to be able to report that we
actually had a wonderful time. But let's face it, despite an idyllic
location only a few yards from the beach, a wonderfully dinky caravan
and the warmest of welcomes, the holiday turned out much as anyone with
an ounce of sense could have predicted.
The sun, which had been making a few feeble attempts to shine for us,
flopped finally into the slate grey sea that evening and was never seen
again. The rain became so torrential that we were trapped for most of
our one full day inside the caravan, tripping over wet anoraks,
sprawling bodies and muddy shells.
The children coughed and bickered, the baby -- stuffed with cold and
wind -- couldn't sleep, the sea worked itself up into a most uninviting
lather and the Monopoly money fell off the table once too often.
Oh, and I crashed the car. In a bid to lull the baby to sleep, I
embarked on a fairly unnecessary trip along miles of twisty single-track
road to the nearest shop, returning with a tin of Heinz Fisherman's Pie
for Infants and without a significant section of the car's bonnet.
Next morning we took all the linen back off the beds, packed the bags,
loaded the car and limped home.
One day we'll look back and laugh. But maybe not quite yet.

<TEXT>
A MOUNTAIN rescue team leader, who has had his busiest year, warned
novice hillwalkers to stay off the mountains this winter after an
inexperienced hillwalker was rescued after spending the night on a
Highland mountain.
Mr Angus Jack, leader of Dundonnel Mountain Rescue Team, also advised
veterans to get fitter.
Mr Jack said Miss Jane Butcher, an asthmatic, of Kenilworth in
Warwickshire, had been ill-equipped but weather conditions had been
favourable.
''Although it was bitterly cold, it was dry. If it had been wet, if
could have been much more serious,'' he said.
Miss Butcher, 24, a child care assistant, became separated from a
group of seven ascending Stac Pollaidh in Wester Ross on Saturday.
A helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth, Dundonnel Mountain Rescue Team, and
three search dogs and handlers carried out a 12-hour search before she
was found sheltering under a rock and picked up by the helicopter.
Mr Jack said: ''After being separated from the group, she tried to
make her own way down. But she showed her inexperience by coming down
the wrong side of the hill. She could not make it, so she sheltered
under a large rock.''
He added: ''When she was found, she said she had seen the rescue team
and torch lights through the night but her shouts were not heard.
''Our search area was fairly close to where she was and it was
surprising we did not find her earlier.''
Mr Jack went on: ''She was remarkably well. She was a bit cold but not
hypothermic.''
Mr Jack said 1995 had been the team's busiest year, with 25 call-outs
so far, almost double last year.
He predicted a busy winter: ''There is certainly an increase in the
number of people taking to the hills and that has an effect on us.''
He stressed: ''People should always be prepared, especially coming up
to the winter months.''
He said that inexperienced people should always go with an experienced
partner and that they should have an ice axe, crampons, and helmet and
know how to use them.
He added: ''People should also be much fitter for winter hill walking.
The shorter days cause problems, so there is a requirement for
navigation skills.''
Another woman was airlifted off Ben Alligin in Torridon yesterday.
Edward and Tess Stroud of Ardenair, Dyke, in Forres, were hillwalking
when Mrs Stroud was overcome by fatigue and sore ankles.
Mr Stroud went for help and an RAF helicopter took Mrs Stroud off the
hill and took her to Broadford Hospital in Skye. She was released after
treatment.

New Delhi
FOREIGN guerrillas holding four Westerners, including two Britons,
hostage in Kashmir have begun turning control of the tourists over to
local militants as they move the captives to a more populated area.
''We believe the Afghans and Pakistanis are being replaced by
Kashmiris,'' said a senior Indian government official.
Since the Western tourists were kidnapped in early July, the Indian
Government has claimed Pakistan was behind the abductions and that
shadowy Al-Faran guerrillas were mostly Afghans and Pakistanis.
Islamabad has denied any involvement and denounced the kidnappings,
which have also drawn criticism from Kashmiri separatist groups who say
Al-Faran has harmed their five-year-old uprising against Indian rule.
Some 20,000 people have been killed in the uprising.
Britons Keith Mangan and Paul Wells were captured along with Americans
Donald Hutchings and John Childs on July 4 near the mountain resort of
Pahalgam.
German Dirk Hasert and Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe were picked up
in the same area on July 8, the day Childs escaped to safety. On August
13, Ostroe was found beheaded in a remote forest.
Authorities said the apparent move by foreign guerrillas to turn
control of the hostages over to Kashmiris could be a hopeful sign,
although they cautioned there was no indication that the four-month
ordeal would end soon.
''We believe there have been fresh inductions of Kashmiris into the
group holding the tourists, and the foreigners are being replaced so
eventually they can claim Pakistan was not involved,'' said an official.
The hostages' wives and girlfriends left India for home last week
after renewing an appeal to Al-Faran to release their menfolk. A
diplomat said the women had not given up hope, but wanted to be with
their families.
''Their mood is determined but patient,'' the diplomat said.--Reuter.

Athens
A GREEK publisher, locked in a vicious battle with the wife of Prime
Minister Andreas Papandreou, vowed to print more pictures of her
allegedly in the nude this week.
George Kouris, formerly an ardent follower of Papandreou and his
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), has recently launched a campaign
through his daily Avriani against Dimitra Liani to force her to withdraw
from public life.
He caused an uproar by publishing a front-page picture supposedly
showing Liani in an intimate nude pose with another woman. The daily
Onoma also printed the same beach-scene picture, but said it did so to
show it was fake.
The socialist government and Liani, 40, a former Olympic Airways
flight attendant who is now Papandreou's chief of staff, denounced the
photograph as a fabrication.
A public prosecutor ordered the arrest of the papers' four publishers
and editors on charges of ''unprovoked insult''.
Kouris and two others are still at large. By avoiding arrest for more
than 48 hours the publishers cannot be tried immediately, but must face
a long legal process.
The publisher of Onoma, Makis Psomiadis, was arrested, tried and
sentenced on Saturday to 16 months in jail. Under Greek law, he can pay
a fine instead of serving his sentence.
His sentence was seen as a stern warning, especially to Kouris, who
claims to have scores of similar photographs and has vowed to use them
until Liani quits her post.
An Avriani spokesman insisted the paper would continue ''to publish
all the evidence it has on Mrs Liani''.
Liani issued a statement expressing her ''deepest contempt'' for what
she called a dirty campaign to blackmail her.
The uproar is not new to Liani, who emerged from obscurity seven years
ago, shocking the nation when Papandreou publicly flaunted their
extra-marital affair.
They met in mid-air as Liani was serving the prime minister drinks.
They married shortly after he lost the 1989 election.
She was tolerated as Papandreou's wife during his years in opposition,
but gained instant enemies when he returned to power in 1993 and made
her his chief of staff.
Her power obvious ambition to run for parliament have enraged many of
Papandreou's socialists, who see her as a political upstart.
Papandreou, 76, frail since heart surgery in 1988, insists he is in
charge and has said he would support her if she chose to run for office.

Gaza City
ANGRY Palestinians today burned American and Israeli flags and swore
to avenge the assassination of Islamic Jihad leader Fathi Shqaqi.
Gaza City students called for revenge against Israel's secret service
agency Mossad, which both the Israeli press and Palestinian sources
claimed carried out the killing.
Islamic Jihad, which bitterly opposes the PLO-Israeli peace deal,
warned: ''This ugly crime will make every Zionist on the face of the
Earth a target for our painful strike.''
It confirmed that the man gunned down in Malta on Thursday was Shqaqi.
A gunman on a motorcycle, using a silenced pistol, shot him five times
in the head outside a hotel in Malta's capital Valetta.
The assassination threatened a new cycle of Middle East violence, just
as Israel's peace agreement with the Palestinians reaches fruition.
However the removal of a top terrorist also buys time to let the
agreement work.
The Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad has about 250 to 300 hard-core
followers in Lebanon and a similar number of guerrillas in the Gaza
Strip and is expected to be hard hit by the loss of its leader.
''This was definitely a harsh blow for Islamic Jihad,'' said Gideon
Ezra, a former top official in the Shin Bet security service.
''Every action was under the control of Shqaqi, who was the commander,
the trainer, and also the man who raised money for the organisation,
mostly in Iran.''
A Palestinian source said Islamic Jihad was split between members who
wanted to reach some kind of compromise with Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority, and hard-liners like Shqaqi, who refuse to contemplate
anything short of a Palestinian state covering all of Israel and the
occupied territories.
The source said Shqaqi was the only one who could hold the two sides
together.
Islamic Jihad banners in Gaza City today threatened new attacks
against Israel, which has already suffered suicide raids. One banner
said: ''We will explode Israeli blood and travel with it to heaven.''
PLO chief Yasser Arafat, in Jordan for an economic conference, refused
to comment on the killing today, but ministers of his Palestinian
Authority condemned it.
Asked whether Israel was involved, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
answered: ''Not that I know of.''
However he added: ''The Islamic Jihad is a murderous organisation and
he headed it. He was someone who killed and was proud of it, and whoever
deals in murder is taking the risk of being murdered.''
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Shqaqi ''had a lot of enemies''. ''I
bet he even had Palestinian enemies,'' he added.
The new leader of Islamic Jihad was named as Ramadan Abdullah, 42, a
former business administration professor who left Gaza in 1991 and is
now based in the Syrian capital Damascus.--AP.

Bacolod
TROPICAL storm Zack killed nearly 100 people, forced 60,000 others to
flee their homes, and sank a passenger ferry in a devastating sweep
across the central Philippines.
The storm flattened more than 2000 houses, downed power lines, knocked
out telephones in eight provincial cities, and triggered floods that
ravaged sugar cane plantations in the Visayas region.
More than 5000 other houses were partially damaged, relief officials
said.
In Manila, President Fidel Ramos declared a state of calamity in
Visayas, to enable the release of emergency funds to rebuild the area.
Relief agencies reported at least 89 dead, but officials said they
expected the toll to rise when they heard from interior villages cut off
after Zack's 65mph centre winds hit 10 provinces in the area yesterday.
Many families climbed to the roofs of their homes as rivers swelled,
sending floodwaters through 100 villages in Iloilo province on Panay
island, provincial governor Arturo Defensor said. He added: ''We have
three major problems, food, power, and water. We need immediate massive
assistance.''
At least 57 people died in Negros Occidental, many of them drowned,
while another 23 were missing. Fifteen people were killed in Iloilo, and
17 on Cebu island. About 30 others were injured.
Today, the provinces of Negros Occidental and Iloilo, with a combined
population of almost 5 million, remained without power.
The 352-tonne inter-island Cebu Diamond ferry sank off Camotes island,
46 of its 51 crewmen were rescued by passing foreign ships or swam to
safety, the coast guard said. Five are missing.
The storm is today headed towards the South China Sea, where it is
expected to intensify.--Reuter.

FISHERMEN are to be issued with thousands of waterproof cards telling
them what to do if they catch giant turtles from South America and
Africa. The reptiles can weigh as much as a small family car.
Last week, a 4ft specimen was found drowned in a lobster pot line off
Skye.
The leatherback and loggerhead turtles have been following jellyfish,
their main diet, up the Gulf Stream from Mexico after initially swimming
from South American and African coasts, where they were born.
They are the only reptile to be warm-blooded and have a layer of
blubber. That is believed to be why they survive in the colder Scottish
waters.
The biggest yet found in the world, weighing more than 2000lb and
measuring more than 9ft, was recorded on the Welsh coast in 1988.
It is their fondness of jellyfish that has got them into trouble in
Scotland -- either ending up in nets or choking to death on discarded
white plastic containers, which they mistake for food.
Scottish Natural Heritage is now asking fishermen to log any sightings
or contact with turtles, and is issuing them with advice on how to deal
safely with the creatures.
Dr Martin Gaywood, an SNH ecologist in charge of the turtle project,
said: ''The leatherbacks in particular have a nasty bite that can take
fingers off and they cause a lot of damage with their flippers.
''They will not attack but do need to be handled very carefully. That
is why the card will include advice if fishermen catch one in their nets
or find one stranded.''
Dr Gaywood said that global warming could be responsible for the
increasing number of turtle sightings in Scotland but thought more
research was needed. Although only 10 sightings were logged last year,
the SNH knows that many more were seen without being reported.
The main turtle-spotting season is between June and August.
Mr Calum Macaulay, a Great Bernera fisherman, came across one giant
leatherback entangled in ropes.
''Unfortunately, it was drowning and we could not save it,'' he said.
''It was over 6ft long and was so heavy it needed the boat's hauling
gear to get it aboard. It weighed well over 400lb.
''At first we were going to stuff it as a souvenir but we could not
find anybody locally who could stuff it, so it was disposed of.
''I personally think it is a bit of a waste of money to issue all
these turtle cards -- we don't see that many. But when you do, you
think, 'What on earth is that doing here?' It's a bit different to the
normal lobster and crab catch.''

Washington
THE US Government has sent the war crimes tribunal at The Hague
reconnaissance photographs of six more mass graves in eastern Bosnia,
and photographs of Bosnian prisoners-of-war herded together at the sites
where, later, the graves were dug. It has also supplied other
intelligence evidence of the worst atrocities in Europe since 1945.
The Serbs overran Srebrenica on July 11. The first reports of
atrocities came two weeks later, as survivors of Muslim men who tried to
escape reached safety. Between 3000 and 10,000 were killed on the spot
or were captured by the Serbs and later massacred.
The American intelligence agencies did not attach a high priority to
looking for signs of atrocities immediately after the fall of
Srebrenica. They were more concerned with evidence of the Serbs' future
intentions. Were they going to attack Zepa, another Muslim enclave in
eastern Bosnia, and where was their heavy artillery?
However, after the reports of massacres, the CIA and
photo-intelligence agencies began to examine the immense mass of
photographs that U-2 planes and satellites had taken of Srebrenica and
its surroundings.
By early August, there was clear evidence of mass graves, and the
first photographs were released. Madeleine Albright, the American
ambassador to the UN, made the charge formally to the Security Council
on August 10.
These reports finally persuaded the British and French Governments to
agree to a Nato bombing campaign against Serb military positions, to
protect the remaining ''safe zones''. The bombing campaign, followed by
the Croat offensive in the Krajina and the Croat-Bosnian offensive in
western Bosnia, obscured the extent of the war crimes and the detail of
the evidence.
The latest details have been revealed four days before the peace talks
between Bosnians, Croats, and Serbs are due to open in Ohio. The New
York Times today follows the Washington Post last week in giving a full
and harrowing account of the massacres.
Its report includes interviews with Serbs living in villages around
Srebrenica who confirm the massacres. The Post, meanwhile, publishes one
of the new aerial photographs of mass graves. It says that photographs
of Muslim prisoners under guard in fields, who were then shot, have not
yet been released.
In other developments, the first buses rolled along the main road west
out of Sarajevo today in a sign of the painstakingly slow steps towards
normality in the city.
However the long-closed Brotherhood and Unity bridge to the Serb-held
suburb of Grbavica remained barricaded to civilians despite UN pledges
that it would be opened today.

ABERDEEN is not isolated from drugs dangers, as many residents think,
and in fact is one of the biggest problem areas in the UK, a senior
police officer has revealed.
In a Grampian Television documentary to be broadcast tonight,
Detective Inspector Donnie Struthers also predicts that it is only a
matter of time before there are gangland shootings on the streets of the
Granite City.
Mr Struthers also said that drugs were not confined to less well off
communities.
''Drugs don't respect postal codes,'' he said. ''You will get drug
abuse in just about every community in Grampian, be they large, small,
urban, rural or coastal. We would go as far as to say you will not find
a drugs-free secondary school in Grampian region.
''We have a heroin problem in Aberdeen which is probably second only
to Strathclyde in Scotland. Per head of population, as far as registered
addicts are concerned, the region ranks about seventh in the whole of
the UK.
''There's obviously a market for heroin here and, in the long term, it
will undoubtedly attract dealers from Liverpool and Glasgow.
''They may want to bypass the couriers and dealers in this area and
come up themselves to start dealing. You have only got to look at the
violence that happens in those cities to realise we will very soon have
gangland shootings in our streets.''
He said they were coming upon children as young as 11 using heroin and
at 13, 14, and 15 they were supplying.
He said that, in the last 18 months, jail sentences totalling more
that 120 years had been handed out to drug dealers in Grampian, but
police say they are only ''Scratching the Surface'' the title of the
documentary for which Grampian Television shadowed the drugs squad for
12 months.
Drugs counsellor Ian Hyslop appeals for more funding to help ease the
problem and says: ''We don't need window dressing and fancy posters and
fancy campaigns. There is nothing in Grampian of any note that deals
with drug users.''
He calls for new ideas and initiatives and for a drug rehabilitation
centre in the area. He also favours decriminalisation of soft drugs.
Former addicts tell of the scale of the problem and of their
experiences and one claims he could ''score'' drugs in any city pub
within five minutes.
A mother also tells how her 17-year-old son was turned into a thief
because of his addiction, before being found dead from an overdose.
The programme is broadcast tonight at 10.30 on the evening of a
National Drug Seminar being organised by Grampian Police.
Among the speakers will be the Metropolitan Police director of
intelligence, Commander John Grieve, who will outline the scale of drug
problems nationally and internationally; Mr Tony Higgins, secretary of
the Scottish Professional Footballers Association, who will outline the
dangers of players being involved in drug misuse, and Mr Tom Farrell,
from Aspen, Colorado, who will detail his American experience in drug
prevention programmes in schools.

Johannesburg
FORMER South African Defence Minister Magnus Malan is among 11 top
apartheid-era officials who were today facing arrest over a 1987
hit-squad attack that killed 13 blacks.
''These individuals will be formally arrested by a team of detectives
at the Durban regional court on Thursday morning,'' said Safety and
Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi.
Earlier the attorney general of KwaZulu-Natal province, Tim McNally,
said warrants for the arrests of Malan and the other officers had been
issued but not yet executed.
The issuing of the warrants looked certain to escalate tensions
between President Nelson Mandela's government and white right-wingers.
They have demanded extensions of an earlier amnesty for crimes of
violence that preceded apartheid's demise.
Deputy President and National Party leader F W de Klerk said he had
been shocked to learn of the impending arrests, adding that most of the
men named had been ''indispensable in the process of the birth of the
new South Africa''.
He insisted that there was an absolute right to amnesty for crimes
committed with a political motive before December 6, 1993.
Prosecuting former leaders and commanders widely respected in their
communities would exacerbate wounds that had only just started to heal,
he warned.
The Security Minister said that Malan, former South African Defence
Force chiefs Jannie Geldenhuys and Kat Liebenberg, and former navy chief
Vice-Admiral Dries Putter would be charged with the murders of the 13
people at KwaMakhutha in KwaZulu-Natal.
They would also face charges related to their alleged roles in
establishing a paramilitary force for the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party,
which was claimed to be responsible for the massacre.
The charges are in connection with the 1987 attack on an the home of
United Democratic Front activist Victor Ntuli in KwaMakhutha, about 18
miles south of Durban.
Thirteen people, several of them women and children who were attending
a prayer meeting, were killed in an attack on the Ntuli homestead. Ntuli
was killed by unknown gunmen three years later.
Former military intelligence officer Brigadier John More, former
security policeman Colonel Louis Botha, Inkatha's deputy
secretary-general Zakhele ''M Z'' Khumalo, and four KwaZulu policemen
are due to appear in Durban's Regional Court tomorrow in connection with
the attack.
ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa said the party ''believes that
all those implicated in the mass murder of our people in KwaMakutha and
the other massacres must be brought to book to face the due process of
the law''.
He added: ''Such possible prosecution can only expose the nature and
extent of Third Force involvement in the current and previous violence
against communities in an attempt to undermine the ANC and its allies.''
In recent years evidence has emerged of senior security force members
involved in hit-squad activities, including eliminating political
opponents and particularly those linked with liberation movements.
Last week, the right-wing Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) said it
could no longer guarantee peace in South Africa after Mandela's failure
to extend the amnesty date.
Mandela ruled out amnesty for right-wingers standing trial for
bombings in the run-up to last year's all-race polls after meeting wives
and lawyers of some of the 26 men accused of planting bombs in
Johannesburg, Germiston, and Pretoria.--Reuter.

A LABOUR MP yesterday welcomed cuts made by the Scottish Homes housing
agency in its public relations and marketing budget.
Mr Brian Donohoe has previously attacked the agency for spending
''absolutely scandalous'' amounts on public relations with only
''minimal'' expenditure on informing its tenants about transferring to
other landlords.
However, the Cunninghame South MP said yesterday that the agency had
cut its public relations budget from #1,149,000 in the 1993-94 financial
year to #989,000 in 1994-95, with a further reduction to #800,000 in the
current financial year.
He added that the agency had spent only #15,000 in 1993-94 on
informing tenants about stock transfer and this had increased to only
#28,000 in 1994-95.
''The fact that Scottish Homes has cut its PR budget by nearly a third
in the last two years from well over #1m is a clear admission that the
organisation's spending priorities were geared towards boosting its
public image at the expense of its tenants,'' he said.
''The major task facing it over the next couple of years is the
disposal of its housing stock. The fact that only a paltry #28,000 was
spent last year on informing its tenants, out of a total of #900,000,
demonstrates the warped priorities that the organisation is
implementing.''
A spokesman for Scottish Homes said last night: ''Our PR budget
reflects a whole range of priorities, not just the transfer of our
houses.''
As well as communicating with tenants on this and other matters, the
agency also had to communicate with many organisations about grants and
other aspects of funding new housing developments, and had to produce a
wide range of research reports.
''A great deal of our money in the last financial year was spent on
making our tenants more aware of the services we provide as a landlord,
including #160,000 on a new tenant's handbook.
''Everything we do in PR is aimed at increasing the amount of
information that is available on housing in Scotland and that can only
be a good thing. We are always conscious that the money we have is
public money and we use it as prudently as possible.''
He added that the amount of money specifically being spent on
informing tenants about stock transfer was being increased as the
programme gathered momentum. This year, about #60,000 would be spent.

ONE of Scotland's leading police officers, Detective Superintendent
Gordon Ferrie, has been appointed head of security at The Royal Bank of
Scotland.
Mr Ferrie moves from Strathclyde Police, where he has been deputy head
of CID operations and where his career has included the Lockerbie
investigation and major inquiries into fraud, large-scale extortion, and
bank robberies.
Mr Ferrie began his police career in Glasgow in 1967.
In his new role, he will have responsibility for maintaining and
developing all aspects of the Royal Bank's physical and financial
security, working with the bank's senior management team responsible for
security and fraud prevention.
Mr Ferrie will continue to chair a number of influential Scottish
groups, including the Police/Bank Security Liaison Group.
Announcing the appointment, Mr Norman McLuskie, managing director of
the Royal Bank's operations division, said: ''Gordon Ferrie is one of
Scotland's most admired detectives who has an unrivalled experience in
key areas of crime-fighting and security. His appointment is
confirmation of our continuing commitment to the safety and security of
our staff, customers, and premises.''
Mr Ferrie takes over from another former police officer, Mr Ron Hardy,
who retires later this year after 17 years with the bank.

Montreal
CANADIAN Prime Minister Jean Chretien made a last desperate appeal
today for the province of Quebec to reject independence in a referendum
tomorrow, saying secession was unthinkable.
Fighting the political battle of his life to avert the gravest threat
to national unity in Canada's history, Chretien told a final rally in
Hull, Quebec, that he was convinced the French-speaking province would
vote to remain part of the federation.
''Canada without Quebec is unthinkable, and Quebec without Canada is
unthinkable,'' he said.
Not since Canada was founded by English and French settlers in 1867
have French-Canadian nationalists been so close to the dream of creating
their own country in Quebec.
Up to five million voters will choose in the referendum whether Quebec
should ''become sovereign.'' If the answer is yes, it will set off a
chain of events that could lead to the disintegration of the world's
second largest country.
''Tomorrow night a people will be born,'' said separatist leader
Lucien Bouchard, who single-handedly rescued a faltering campaign.
''Tomorrow night, each country in the world will know that they have a
new friend, Quebec.''
The final opinion poll before the vote showed separatists are within
reach of a majority. The survey put their support at 46.8% among decided
voters, a lead of 5%.
Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau has said he needs only 50% plus one
vote to proceed with secession.
The outcome appeared to hinge on the 10% or so of the electorate who
have nervously sat on the fence all through the two-month campaign.
''We have a chance to win, my friends,'' Bouchard said. ''We do not
have a right to let this chance slip through our fingers -- God knows
when we'll get the chance again.''
French speakers appear to be responding to an impassioned call from
Bouchard, leader of the opposition Bloc Quebecois party in Canada's
Parliament, for Quebec to take charge of its own destiny.
The separatists fear most of the undecided will not want to take the
risk of independence. They lost a 1980 referendum on sovereignty by 60%
to 40%. Taking this fear of change into account, the latest poll put the
race as a dead heat.
Both sides campaigned furiously to sway voters in the final hours
before the vote.
The referendum question requires that Quebec try to negotiate a new
economic and political arrangement with Canada before declaring
independence.
Chretien says Canada would reject a new partnership with Quebec and a
sovereignty vote is a one-way ticket out of Canada.
Even if Quebec does vote for sovereignty, it is far from clear that
the federal government will let it go, especially in the event of a
narrow victory.
Chretien has not ruled out holding a federally sponsored referendum
with a more direct question on separation, nor has he ruled out legal
challenges to the vote.
''We have learned that never, never should we take our country for
granted,'' Chretien told a rally today.
The tight race has alarmed many Canadians, unable to understand why
Quebec would want to leave a country rated by a UN agency as having the
world's best quality of life.

AUSTRALIA today denounced British sympathy for France's South Pacific
nuclear tests as ''appalling'' and ''compliant''.
Australia and New Zealand want the issue put high on the agenda of the
Commonwealth heads of government meeting set for Auckland on November
10-13.
Ralph Willis, Australia's Treasurer, warned that Prime Minister John
Major could be isolated at the 52-nation summit.
France detonated a 60-kiloton bomb on Friday, its third in two months,
in an underground test at Mururoa Atoll in French Polynesia day in
defiance of overwhelming international condemnation.
Yesterday Mr Major said he was sure French President Jacques Chirac
only ordered the tests ''because he was persuaded he had to''.
Mr Willis said he was disappointed but not surprised by Mr Major's
comments.
''John Major, of course, has been totally compliant with the French
nuclear testing all the way along,'' he said on television.
''The British have made no criticism whatever to my knowledge of
President Chirac's government for its nuclear testing programme. And so
for him to say that is just in conformity with their fairly appalling
record on this matter.''
Mr Willis added that Mr Major's position was ''totally out of line
with most of the other nations in the Commonwealth''.--AP.

A TELEVISION advertisement featuring lookalikes of star couple Liz
Hurley and Hugh Grant was banned from children's television yesterday.
The commercial for Rowntree's chocolate bar Toffee Crisp included
images of a gun and a noose which appeared around the man's neck.
Thirty-one viewers complained to the Independent Television
Commission, which last night said it should not be shown between
children's programmes.
The advertisement showed a comic encounter between a girl and her
jilted boyfriend using a combination of real film and superimposed
cartoon images.
During the course of the commercial, the chocolate bar magically
transforms into a bright orange character which then changes into other
images supposedly dreamed of by the girl.
One was a pistol which changed into a rope noose around the man's
neck, ending up as a taxi in which the girl was driven away.
In a ruling published yesterday, the ITC said: ''Some people who
complained commented on possible dangers of children copying the
behaviour in the advertisement.''
The ITC said its programme code banned images of hanging before the
9pm adult watershed.
However, the watchdog group said that, because of its cartoon nature,
it would be inappropriate and excessive to ban the advertisement
completely.
However, it said television companies should apply a timing
restriction.

Zagreb
CROATIAN President Franjo Tudjman's ruling nationalist party took a
commanding early lead in today's parliamentary elections, early results
showed.
The election, being held at the height of efforts to bring peace to
the region, was called nine months early to try to capitalise on summer
military victories against rebel Serbs.
Although Tudjman is not running for re-election, he has campaigned
heavily on behalf of his majority Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ).
Many voters indicated they were confused by the campaign. ''Franjo,''
answered one elderly man when asked who he had just voted for.
Croatians last voted in 1992 when they swept Tudjman's HDZ to a solid
majority in Parliament.
In an emotional campaign speech on Friday, Tudjman promised to win
back all the land claimed by Croatia.
Two offensives drove Serbs from their separatist region in western
Slavonia and the Krajina region earlier this year and Tudjman has sworn
to do the same in eastern Slavonia if talks aimed at peacefully
reintegrating the region do not work out.
UN negotiator Thorvald Stoltenberg said that talks on the region would
continue both in Croatia and at wider peace talks due to start in Ohio
on Tuesday.
''I expect lengthy and difficult negotiations, which will probably
result in peace because there has been enough war,'' Tudjman said
today.--Reuter.

THE Prince of Wales will visit the former East Germany next month. He
wants to see how Germany is tackling the deep-seated problems of the old
communist state areas.
He has a series of engagements over four days concerned with the
future of trade and cultural links between Britain and Germany.
Soon after flying into Berlin on November 13, he will head away from
the bright lights of the tourist and commercial areas to a gloomy inner
city area.
His determination to see the grimmer aspects of countries he visits
was seen last year, when he went to South Central Los Angeles, among the
most notorious inner city areas in the US.
This time he has asked to see the Hellersdorf estate, where 100,000
live in bleak blocks of decades-old flats in what, until the fall of the
Wall four years ago, was East Berlin.
Two days later, he will see another kind of bleakness in the old East
Germany, on a farm in the flat lands south of Rostock, near the Baltic
coast.
The interest is caused by the fact that the farmer has used organic
methods for years but now faces increased pressures to adopt modern
methods.
The prince will also visit the village of Krummenhagen, where people
have got together to launch their own ''ecological employment
initiative'', using traditional building methods and rural crafts.
There will be a brief stop-over at Riga, Latvia, on the way back.

THE homeless charity Shelter Scotland has criticised a Government
proposal to put all new council tenants on probation for a year, a move
designed to combat the problem of anti-social tenants, writes ALISON
DANIELS.
The Scottish Office proposal is to be discussed today by housing
organisations and tenants associations at a Scottish Affairs Committee
meeting in Glasgow.
Shelter said housing groups had greeted the proposals with dismay
because the plan ignored the fact that only a minority of tenants
indulged in so-called anti-social behaviour.
The organisation's Kate Caskie said the move attacked the rights of
all public-sector tenants in Scotland. She said that in spite of a
number of high-profile cases there was no evidence to suggest that the
problem of nuisance neighbours was on the increase.
She pointed out that anti-social behaviour was not restricted to
council tenants. ''Much of the current debate has focused exclusively on
remedies available to council landlords, which has the effect of
stigmatising council tenants as the most likely group to be
anti-social.''
Shelter said there were already a number of schemes in operation to
tackle the problems of nuisance neighbours, such as mediation, and that
greater use should be made of these.
The organisation said the Government proposals would assist local
councils only in evicting tenants. ''The proposals will contribute
nothing to the problem where the perpetrator is an owner-occupier or
private tenant.''

<RECORDNO>975634678</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MANY local authorities and housing associations in Scotland may be
regularly carrying out unlawful evictions and laying themselves open to
claims for damages.
The claim has been made by Mr Mike Dailly, a solicitor with the
Scottish Legal Services Agency and Shelter Scotland's housing law
service.
In an article to be published in the next issue of the Journal of the
Law Society of Scotland, Mr Dailly urges all local councils and housing
associations to re-examine their eviction policies.
He points out that evicting a sitting tenant without the authority of
the court has been a civil wrong at common law since at least the
sixteenth century.
That has now been supplemented by legislation such as the Rent
(Scotland) Act 1984 and the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988, but the common
law remains as an important safeguard of tenant's rights.
Mr Dailly claims: ''Individual landlords in the private sector
regularly carry out unlawful evictions but, as will be argued, so do
many of Scotland's local authorities and housing associations.
''Occupiers of the numerous homeless hostels located in Scotland's
major cities pay rent and electricity charges in return for occupation
of a room and the shared use of living room, kitchen, and bathroom
facilities. It is not uncommon for such occupiers to remain in residence
for several years.
''Yet, when it comes to eviction, these occupiers are routinely put
out by their local authority or housing association landlord without the
usual decree for recovery of heritable possession obtained from the
Sheriff Court.''
Mr Dailly says landlords of hostel accommodation generally believe
they are entitled to eject occupiers without due process of law because
they are exempt from the Rent Act and because no secure or assured
tenancy has been created.
However, he adds: ''Unfortunately, the legal position is not at all
straightforward and landlords of certain homeless hostels who eject
occupiers (without the court's authority and permission) may well be
committing a criminal offence and exposing themselves to a civil
claim.''
He points out that the Act provides a general ban on eviction without
due process of law and that landlords who fall foul of the Act may be
liable to a civil damages claim, based on the assessment of a
professional surveyor.
''In my experience, the loss of accommodation in a homeless hostel can
easily produce a statutory damages figure between #5000 and #10,000.
''The purpose of this method of quantification is to act as a strong
deterrent to any landlord contemplating unlawful eviction.''
Mr Dailly says some landlords are exempt from the provisions of the
Act but that it is still a criminal offence to evict unlawfully and
harass a residential occupier.
In some cases, hostel accommodation may be offered for a night and
brief period, in a hotel-type arrangement, without giving rise to any
inference that a tenancy has been created.
''In contrast, many hostels offer accommodation for a lengthy or
indefinite period of time, in return for the periodic payment of rent
and heating charges.''
Mr Dailly's understanding is that most local authorities and housing
associations in Scotland operate on the basis that hostel occupiers can
be evicted without due process of law.
''This may be correct for transient occupiers but not for the more
settled occupier who has exclusive occupation of a room and pays
periodic rent.''
That kind of occupier might well be staying under a common-law tenancy
or an assured tenancy.
''Common-law tenants can only be evicted following decree for recovery
of heritable possession. Any other method will be a criminal offence and
may give rise to a civil claim for statutory or common law damages.
''All local authorities and housing associations would be wise to
re-examine their current hostel eviction policies.''

Judge Tumim, the outgoing Chief Inspector of Prisons, backed
criticisms made of Home Secretary Michael Howard's plans by the Lord

''I think what puts off the burglar is not whether he is going to get
another six months from some slimy magistrate or judge,'' he told BBC1's

''He is concerned whether he is going to get caught and therefore I

FIVE medals awarded to Scottish footballer Ian Crawford, who played in
the triumphant Heart of Midlothian team of the mid to late 1950s, are to
be sold at a Christie's sale of football memorabilia in Glasgow on
November 8.
The medals for two League Championships, two League Cups, and one
Scottish Cup are expected to fetch up to #3500.
Crawford joined Hearts in 1955 and played 350 league and cup games for
the club until his transfer to West Ham in 1962. He made five
appearances for Scotland at Under-23 level.
Hearts won the 1957-58 title with 62 points, winning 29 games, drawing
four, and losing only once.
Also part of the sale is the 1920 League Championship medal won by
James Paterson, of Rangers, estimated to fetch up to #700, and the FA
Cup winner's medal won by Edinburgh-born Jimmy Dunn for Wolverhampton
Wanderers in 1949 is set to fetch up to #3000.
Dunn is the son of the famous Everton and Scotland international
''Ginger'' Dunn, one of the Wembley Wizards who beat England 5-1 in
1928.
Scottish international David Harvey's European Cup Winners' Cup
runner's up medal, which he won with Leeds United in 1973, has a
pre-sale estimate of #500 to #700.
Meanwhile, former England centre forward Tommy Lawton, 76, who played
for Arsenal, Burnley, Everton, and Notts County in the 1930s, 40s, and
50s, has had a sporting medal returned after it was discovered recently
in a box of memorabilia -- 46 years after it was stolen.

DOZENS of regimental museums across the country could disappear in a

The warning came from Shadow Defence Secretary Dr David Clark, who is
urging the Government to announce its plans.
The MoD review into the museums follows an investigation by the
Director of Infantry into their finances. The final report has not been
published.
Dr Clark said yesterday: ''I am concerned this is a cost-cutting
exercise and there may be attempts to close them. It is disgraceful
because regimental museums are a reminder of military history and it is
important they survive.''
A spokesman for the MoD said: ''The report has not yet been received
by Ministers but, in due course, they will be studying it with great
care.
''Ministers believe the military heritage of the United Kingdom is
extremely important and are anxious that it should be presented as well
as possible.''

the top 10 players in the world, all of whom have won major prizes at
other leading events throughout the year.
New Zealand-born Murray Henderson, from Kirriemuir, won the
piobaireachd to give him runner-up prize in the over-all event, and
reigning Glenfiddich champion Willie McCallum, from Campbeltown, took
third place in the piobaireachd and fourth place in the march,

THE Queen will have taken the telephone hoax call from Canadian disc
jockey Pierre Brassard in good humour, according to constitutional
expert Lord St John of Fawsley.
Lord St John, the former Cabinet minister Norman St John-Stevas, said
the system for vetting calls at the palace should be reviewed but there
was no need for heads to roll or for action to be taken against the DJ.
''Her Majesty behaved absolutely correctly. She gave her opinion
privately to a person she believed to be her prime minister.
''The incident shows Her Majesty's desire to be accessible to all her
prime ministers, whether they are from the UK, Canada, New Zealand or
wherever,'' said Lord St John.
''The Queen has a very good sense of humour and I am sure that she
will have seen the funny side of it.''
Brassard rang the Queen on Thursday, claiming to be Mr Jean Chretien,
the Canadian premier. He declined to say how he obtained the Queen's
phone number or managed to get through to her.
Meanwhile, the Queen is due to arrive in New Zealand on Wednesday for
a 10-day visit intended to heal a deep wound felt by Maori radicals over
a land grievance.
Under the #70m deal, the Tainui Federation of Tribes in the North
Island's Waikato region, will be given back the territory over five
years and receive #26m.

THE Barclay brothers look set to add the Scotsman newspaper to their
hotel, property, and newspaper empire.
Industry insiders believe once the deal is finalised, the twins,
Frederick and David Barclay, will consider moving the paper's present HQ
from North Bridge and turn the landmark building into a top hotel.
Printing of the Scotsman and its sister titles Scotland On Sunday and
the Evening News moved to Newhaven from North Bridge around five years
ago.
The present management and many east-coast financiers have long
believed that moving out completely from the historic building to either
a green-field site or smaller offices makes financial sense.
Such a move would leave the way clear for the Barclays, who bought the
Ritz in London's Piccadilly for #75m earlier this month, to turn the
North Bridge building into a five-star hotel.
Last night, it was becoming clear that the brothers were close to
finalising the deal to buy over newspapers put on the market by the
Canadian-based Thomson corporation.
As well as the flagship Scotsman newspaper and its sister titles, the
deal also involves the Aberdeen Press and Journal and Evening Express.
Other bidders, including The Royal Bank of Scotland, Associated
Newspapers, and a consortium backed by the merchant bank Deutsche Morgan
Grenfell, are thought by industry observers to be out of the running.
The Thomson Corporation was hoping to raise around #230m from the
Scottish titles but the Barclays are not expected to pay more than
#200m.
Last week, the Barclays raised about #70m by selling their 24% stake
in the casino group London Clubs International.
That deal added to their already considerable financial resources that
have in the past brought them the European newspaper, which they saved
from collapse following the death of its founder Robert Maxwell, and the
prestigious Ritz hotel.
The Barclays are based in Monaco but are building a multi-million
pound new home on their own small island off Guernsey.

THE leader of the Moonies has been banned from entering the UK by the
Home Secretary, Mr Michael Howard.
Sun Myung Moon is leader of four million followers worldwide.
Korean-born Moon had been due to arrive in London next weekend for his
first visit to Britain since 1978 to address 1200 disciples.
The Home Office said: ''The Home Secretary has personally directed
that the exclusion of the Rev Sun Myung Moon from the UK is conducive to
the public good.
''He has taken account of representations from MPs and others about
the undesirable activities of the Moonies.''
The Home Secretary has the power under immigration laws to exclude
anyone from the country if their presence is considered not conducive to
the public good.
Sun Myung Moon, 75, who was jailed in the US in the early 1980s for
tax fraud, has been accused of encouraging the break-up of families and
of brainwashing recruits.
His followers take part in mass wedding ceremonies involving thousands
of couples, and give up all their possessions.
The Moonies, officially called the Unification Church, had already
booked the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in Westminster and
advertised tickets at #5 for next week's proposed visit.

BRITAIN'S oldest and longest-serving licensee has finally hung up her
apron. Eighty-eight-year-old Mary MacBain has spent a lifetime
dispensing drams and ''good wholesome Scottish fare'' at the Suie Hotel
at Kincraig near Aviemore.
Now she has handed the license of the 11-bedroom hotel at the side of
the ''old'' A9 to her 61-year-old son Farquhar.
The hotel, originally a granite-built mansion which took about seven
years to complete at the turn of the century, was gifted to the
blacksmith's daughter and her late husband Farquhar senior, a farm
grieve, by a wealthy uncle of Mary's . . . on one condition.
Mrs McBain said yesterday: ''My married name was MacTavish but my
uncle wanted the MacBain name to continue as owners of the place. So my
husband had to change his name to MacBain, keeping MacTavish as his
middle name.''
That was in the mid-twenties but, thanks to an anti-drink clan chief,
it was another 10 years before the couple were able to get a drinks
license for their hotel.
''The property's fedual superior was the local estate owner, the
MacIntosh of MacIntosh,'' said Mr McBain. He was a Wee Free and against
the hotel getting a license.''
Only after his death were the MacBain's able to get one.
The hotel gets its name from the adjacent Suie Hill, from where the
granite blocks used to build it were quarried.
''Donkeys attached to pulleys were used to lift the blocks up the
outside walls as the hotel was built,'' he said.
''The place cost #1100 to construct. To insure its replacement value
you would be looking at #2.6m nowadays.''
Accommodation costs, too, were a far cry from today's prices. A week's
stay with dinner each night cost just #3.15. You may even have shared a
table with the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Princess Royal, both
guests at one time.
As a boy of 15, Mr McBain was given a #10 tip by a shipping line
millionaire. ''I chased after him with the note, thinking he had made a
mistake. I'd never ever seen a #10 note, never mind owned one.''
The hotel had its own cows and hens to provide milk and eggs. The
vegetables came from a croft Mr McBain Sr also worked.
The hotel's heydays were during the war, when Canadian and Indian
troops billeted nearby plus the Highland Light Infantry, which was
resting after Dunkirk. Times were also good in the sixties and early
seventies, said Mr McBain, when grouse shooters would book the entire
hotel for six weeks.
However, But the recession began to bite in the eighties and trade
suffered.
The by-passing of the village by the ''new'' A9 Perth to Inverness
road in 1983 also put paid to a lot of daytime trade.
''But we'll still soldier on,'' said Mrs McBain with a twinkle in her
eye as she examined an old sepia coloured brochure of the hotel with its
telephone number -- Kincraig 14.

COUNCILLORS in new local authorities must be prepared to leave the
running of services to managers and concentrate on broader
policy-making, the Scottish Local Government Minister, Mr George Kynoch,
will stress in a speech this week.
His ''slim down your structures'' message will be pressed home when he
addresses The Herald's Challenge of Change local government conference
in Edinburgh on Thursday.
Mr Kynoch said yesterday that there was still time for unitary
authorities to cut back on their committee structures and special
responsibility payments to councillors, and concentrate instead on
efficient delivery of services.
''It isn't too late. They still have not completed their appointment
procedures and committee arrangements are not set in stone. They should
think again and I hope they will do so.''
Mr Kynoch plans to review the reorganisation process so far when he
speaks at the Challenge of Change conference.
Cosla figures show there is a wide discrepancy between the sort of
structures being set up by different authorities. Dumfries and Galloway
will have eight committees and South Ayrshire six. Glasgow will have 24
and Dundee 18.
Some of the arrangements being made, Mr Kynoch said, were top-heavy
and outdated. In addition the number of committees planned in some
authorities allowed the payment of special responsibility allowances to
a very large number of councillors from the ruling group. This was not
what had been intended when councils were given more flexibility on such
payments, he said.
''What we are saying is that some councils have used the money they
have been given in a more sensible way than others.''
Last week Mr Peter Peacock, Cosla's vice president, called for an end
to political jibes by the Government about reorganisation. He said
constructive dialogue was vitally needed to address the grave financial
problems faced by the new councils.
Mr Kynoch said he too wanted dialogue but the Government had a
responsibility to payers of council tax. Ministers would continue to
cajole and criticise when they believed councils were not acting
responsibly.
Ministers were ''very disappointed'' that the actions of some were
spoiling the situation for the others who were trying to be
forward-looking and efficient.
The Challenge of Change conference at the Carlton Highland Hotel in
Edinburgh will also be addressed by the Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr
George Robertson. Other speakers will include Cosla president Rosemary
McKenna and the convener of the new Edinburgh council, Mr Eric Milligan.

SKYE councillors will meet this week to frame a motion, calling for
the abolition of tolls on the Skye bridge, to be put before the new
Highland Council in November.
At the first meeting of Skye and Lochalsh Area Committee, Highland
councillors Gavin Scott Moncrieff, Drew Millar, Allan Beaton, John
Farquhar Munro, Farquhar MacLennan, and chief executive David Noble will
phrase a motion in time for the Highland Council's meeting on November
24.
Regional council convener Duncan MacPherson has also asked for a
meeting of the independent Skye Bridge Working Group which he chairs.
The Highland Council convener, Mr Peter Peacock, asked Skye and
Lochalsh councillors to bring forward the motion to have the tolls
removed by the time of the next meeting, but members are obliged to have
it ready by November 13 when the agenda is set.
Meanwhile, Ross, Cromarty, and Skye MP Charles Kennedy endorsed the
non-payment campaign but made it clear he would not be joining it.
Mr Kennedy was speaking yesterday following the election on Friday of
Lochalsh councillor John Farquhar Munro, a stern critic of the bridge's
toll regime, as the chairman of the new Highland Council's
transportation committee.
On the same day in Kyle of Lochalsh, the statutory transport watchdog
body, the Railway Users Consultative Committee for Scotland, which also
operates as the Caledonian MacBrayne Users Consultative Committee, were
being told by local people that a ferry service should be run as an
alternative to the bridge.
Its chairwoman, Mrs Helen Miller, made it clear after the meeting that
the committee would be submitting a report to the Secretary of State
recommending that a ferry service should be run between Kyle of Lochalsh
and Kyleakin.
Mr Kennedy said yesterday both developments were significant for the
anti-toll campaign: ''I congratulate and welcome Councillor Munro's
clear-cut victory. This creates the opportunity for a new co-operative
campaign against tolls between local MPs and the new Highland Council.
''Equally, the RUCCS has been left in no doubt as to the strength of
local feeling. That, I hope, will lead to some firm recommendations
being made to the Secretary of State.''
On the question of the ''Freedom Runs'', which campaigners claim have
resulted in more than 100 people being reported to the procurator fiscal
at Dingwall for non-payment of the tolls, Mr Kennedy said: ''Councillor
Munro and myself both view sympathetically the campaign of civil
disobedience. We have explained to the non-payment campaigners, however,
that in our elected positions, we shall be pursuing our campaign
activities within the law.''

Young people in Scotland over the past 15 years or so have been
performing well and I can say with some certainty that there has been no
deterioration in standards
Brian Boyd
THE standard of mathematical
skills among Scottish schoolchildren is not falling, despite a survey
which shows that many teenagers are leaving school unable to do basic
sums without the aid of a calculator, it was claimed yesterday.
A report to be published later this week will warn of a sharp decline
in standards among British school pupils and conclude that they fall
well behind children in other countries.
However, Mr Brian Boyd, co-director of the Quality and Education
Centre at Strathclyde University, yesterday contradicted the study's
findings.
''Young people in Scotland over the past 15 years or so have been
performing well and I can say with some certainty that there has been no
deterioration in standards,'' he said.
A newspaper reported yesterday that the study, by three eminent bodies
of academics, concludes that school mathematics has failed to provide
''the necessary foundations to maintain either the quantity or the
quality of mathematically competent school-leavers.''
Education and Employment Secretary Gillian Shephard will be urged by
the London Mathematical Society, the Royal Statistical Society, and the
Institute of Mathematics, to act immediately on what they describe as a
crisis.
A lack of basic knowledge of arithmetic, algebra, and geometry has
been blamed on progressive teaching methods and the introduction of the
national curriculum.
Research has also shown that the mathematical ability of Scottish and
English schoolchildren has fallen well behind that of children from
Singapore, Poland, Germany, and other countries.
In Singapore, 70% of schoolchildren could express the fraction one
eighth as a decimal (0.125), while 54% in Poland, 32% in Germany, 8% in
England, and just 5% in Scotland could do the same.
However, Mr Boyd, one of Scotland's leading education researchers,
dismissed the report as ''alarmist'' and said recent surveys and
examination results indicated that Scottish schoolchildren were, in
general, not becoming less adept at mathematics.
He said the evidence of the Assessment of Achievement Programme (AAP)
-- which HM Schools Inspectorate uses to assess the skills of a sample
of primary four, primary seven, and second-year secondary pupils in
mathematics, English, and science every three years -- contradicted the
study's findings.
''In general terms, the information coming from that (the AAP) is that
standards have remained fairly steady over that period of time in
mathematics as well as the other two subjects so there is nothing to be
alarmed about as far as that is concerned.
''Young people in Scotland over the past 15 years or so have been
performing well and I can say with some certainty that there has been no
deterioration in standards in these three subjects since 1981 (when the
AAPs were introduced).''
Mr Boyd, who said this was supported by examination results in
Scottish schools, added that the question of whether British
schoolchildren were doing as well in mathematics as those in Pacific Rim
countries, for example, was closely linked to the culture of countries
such as North and South Korea.
''Countries such as those which are seeking to become industrialised
and compete in a global economy might want to heavily weight their
curriculum for youngsters on what we might call the basics. In a country
like ours, where we feel that the basic skills in general are being
handled very well, the curriculum becomes much broader.''
Despite his confidence in general standards, Mr Boyd warned against
complacency in education -- where there is presently considerable debate
about teaching methods and what should be included in the mathematics
curriculum -- and said standards of mathematical skills among children
could be further improved.
''About 20 years ago, we tended to be taught mathematics in a very
traditional way but there has been a revolution since then towards
individualised learning and quite a number of people in mathematics are
concerned that the pendulum has swung too far and that these
individualised programmes with a kid working for hours on end on their
own don't quite meet the needs of the kids.''
He added: ''If you asked a sample of the adult population which
subject they like the least or are most afraid of, most would probably
say mathematics. So, there is something about the way we teach
mathematics that doesn't seem to quite grab the attention and
imagination of people.''
Mr Boyd said he believed many mathematicians looked at mathematics in
an academic way and regarded it as a ''linear subject'' with which
pupils would struggle unless they understood it from the start.
''I personally don't accept that and I think that, if we employed more
imaginative teaching methods, a lot more people would be better at
mathematics.''

YACHTSWOMAN Samantha Brewster yesterday started her historic bid to
become the first female to sail solo around the world ''the wrong way''.
The 28-year-old left her mooring in Southampton to cheers from her
family and crowds of supporters.
Miss Brewster is to attempt the toughest endeavour in yachting --
sailing single-handed 28,000 miles from east to west. She will be
heading straight into prevailing winds and strong tides.
Attempts to sail the wrong way round the world have been successful
only twice before.
Chay Blyth held the record for 22 years until 1994, when Mike Golding
cut the record by 125 days in an identical boat to the one Miss Brewster
will sail.
She aims to smash Mr Golding's record of 161 days on her yacht Heath
Insured, a steel, 67ft cutter-rigged sloop.
Miss Brewster has sailed in the boat before when she was part of a
crew of 13 in the British Steel Challenge 1992/93.
Her boyfriend, Godfrey Owen, who works with Miss Brewster at an
outdoor activities centre at Ambleside in Cumbria, said: ''I am very
proud of her.
''Of course I will miss her but I know she is really looking forward
to this and I hope she can break the record.''
The Heath Insured has been redesigned for Miss Brewster trip.
Sails have been altered to make them easier to handle and a
self-steering mechanism has been fitted. Her only luxury will be a CD
and tape player to record her diaries.
She will not be allowed to stop, take on board provisions or use
anybody's physical assistance if she is to officially complete the
voyage alone.
Miss Brewster said: ''My main concern is to get round the world but
there is a record to break and I am going to break it. I love sailing
and this is a personal challenge I have set myself. I have no fears
about being on my own for six months. I am a solitary person and I am
looking forward to my own company.''

THE Government yesterdayfaced the risk of fresh embarrassment in court
over allegations that it turned a blind eye to the illegal supply of
arms to Iraq.
Four businessmen, convicted more than three years ago of conspiring to
evade controls on the export of military equipment, are asking the Court
of Appeal to clear their names.
They say they acted with the Government's knowledge and tacit approval
and with the active involvement of the security services.
The four say they pleaded guilty at their trial at Reading Crown Court
in February 1992 only because the Crown destroyed their defence by
threatening to issue Public Interest Immunity (PII) certificates banning
disclosure of material relating to the activities of MI5 and MI6.
Stuart Blackledge, Paul Grecian, and Bryan Mason, who worked for
Reading-based military engineering firm OrdTech until it collapsed as a
result of the prosecution, received suspended sentences.
Colin Phillips, who worked for a shipping firm, was fined #1000.
The case concerned the export of fuses for heavy artillery shells to
Iraq through Jordan.
Most of the material restricted by the PII certificates has now been
disclosed to the appeal judges and to Sir Richard Scott, whose inquiry
into the Arms to Iraq affair was sparked off by the Matrix Churchill
case at the Old Bailey.
The background to the appeal, before Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief
Justice, and two other judges, bears a strong resemblance to the Matrix
Churchill trial, in which defence lawyers successfully challenged the
use by Ministers of PII certificates to suppress sensitive information
indicating that the Government knew about the arms exports.

<HEADLINE>Singer's campaign funds an 'electric heart'</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975634714</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A PIONEERING project into electronic heart transplants, which saved
the life of a chronically ill man last week, has received #750,000 in
funding from a group led by singer Frankie Vaughan.
The singer, who has had heart surgery himself, raised the money with
friends to give Londoner Abel Goodman a mechanical heart using a new
transplant device.
Mr Goodman underwent the operation to implant the artifical device at
Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital after being told he was unsuitable for
a heart transplant due to his age and kidney problems.
Mr Goodman, who also celebrated his 64th birthday last week, is
recuperating despite suffering a slight stroke on Saturday.
It is the first of what is hoped to be a series of three similar
operations funded by the show business star and his friends. They
launched a fund-raising campaign a year ago after learning of the work.
Doctors have hailed the latest surgery as a world's first for the
modified device.
An operation was carried out last year at Papworth Hospital,
Cambridge, which involved a very similar piece of equipment.
Dr Steve Westaby, who carried out last week's intricate operation,
said that around 500 patients had received similar implants in the US
but these had been used as an intermediate device for those waiting for
human hearts for transplant.
''Our device was modified to make it suitable for long-term
implantation.'' said Dr Westaby.
Dr Westaby, who has been involved with American research on artificial
hearts for a number of years, said Mr Vaughan, a personal friend and
patient, had approached other associates, including Mr Jim Marshall,
boss of the Marshall Amplifier Company, and Sir Kirby Laing, the
building company boss, to help fund the project.
He said: ''Between them, they have funded the Oxford Artificial Heart
Unit to the tune of #750,000.''
Dr Westaby denied there was any race between his medical team and
Papworth Hospital within the field of artificial hearts.
He said although Papworth had implanted devices into patients on a
permanent basis, the operation he carried out was the first time a more
sophisticated device had been used.
''Both Papworth and ourselves decided that it was time that this type
of device was used as a permanent artificial heart. The devices are
completely different although the intention is the same.
''We are not interested in any sort of race but we both have new ideas
as to how heart failure should be treated.''
Mr Goodman is partially mobile and in a stable condition after having
the device, the size of a grapefruit, inserted on his heart.

<TEXT>
CONSUMER representatives today criticise British Gas for giving
bonuses to service engineers for persuading householders to buy central
heating.
Engineers receive between #5 and #20 for each boiler or heating system
installed.
The Gas Consumers Council says it is wrong for workers carrying out
annual inspections and service checks to be encouraged to try to sell
new equipment.
Its director, Mr Ian Powe, said: ''It seems to me that there's a
conflict of interest here. The annual service is as important as an MOT
test on a car because both can be lethal if improperly maintained.
''We are uneasy about the emphasis on cash incentives which seem to
use a safety check as a sales opportunity.
''Sadly, this does seem to be symptomatic of the new British Gas,
where profit has a higher priority than the public service.''
A British Gas official defended the policy, saying: ''We have been
doing it for 30 years and we do not see any conflict of interests.''
Customers had complained that, instead of work being carried out free
of charge to boilers under a service agreement, they were being told
parts were not available and new units should be installed at costs
ranging from #890 to #1500.
The British Gas spokesman said: ''In many cases, the boilers are very
old and we cannot find parts. Boilers do have to be replaced eventually
and most people prefer us to give them advice.''

<HEADLINE>Leeson decides on trial in Singapore</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975634716</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE man alleged to havecaused the multi-million pound collapse of
Barings Bank, Mr Nick Leeson, has given up his fight against extradition
to Singapore.
In a statement issued yesterday via his Singapore-based lawyer John
Koh, Mr Leeson apologised to the people of the Far East country for
suggesting he would not face a fair trial there.
He said: ''After consulting my legal advisers, I am satisfied that I
will be fairly tried and judged in Singapore.''
Mr Leeson added: ''I wish to apologise to all Singaporeans for having
doubted that I could receive a fair trial.
''I have decided to return voluntarily to Singapore and I will
therefore not be pursuing my appeal against the extradition order in
Germany.''
A representative of Leeson's London lawyer Kingsley Napley last night
refused to comment on the statement.
Mr Leeson, 28, has been in Frankfurt's Hoechst prison since his arrest
at the city's airport in March.
He faces 11 charges of fraud and forgery in Singapore, where he will
probably be held at the notorious Changi Prison to await trial. He is
expected to return to Singapore by the end of next month.
Mr Leeson's family said last night that they were aware of his
decision but had been asked by his lawyers not to comment on it.
Interpol was called in to find Mr Leeson when he left Singapore but is
no longer involved.
Yesterday's development may have been the fruit of negotiations over a
possible plea bargain between Mr Leeson and the Singaporean authorities.
Those authorities have indicated that they would be open to a deal in
the hope of receiving information about the role of Mr Leeson's seniors
in the Barings collapse.
It is believed Mr Leeson plans to fund his defence with the #450,000
proceeds from a book deal sealed at the recent Frankfurt Book Fair.
Film rights for his story have been secured by Sir David Frost.

BRITISH Rail believes it has at last got the right sort of equipment
to deal with the notorious annual autumn problem of leaves on the line.
BR and Railtrack are trying, for the first time, ''one-shot sanding''
-- a new technique which sprays sand on to the line.
If the driver finds the train cannot get a proper grip on the track,
he pushes a button which sends a blast of sand on to the track.
The rail companies are also countering the usual autumnal difficulties
by getting specific leaf ''blackspot'' warnings from the Meterological
Office.
As usual, Sandite trains, which spread a sandy paste on to the track
to prevent leaves sticking to the lines, have been in operation.

THE former director of UK athletics coaching, Frank Dick, said
yesterday he will sue for ''punitive damages'' from a Sunday newspaper
which claims he acquiesced in the use of banned performance-enhancing
drugs.
Commonwealth Games medallist Drew McMaster, the former Scottish 100
metres champion and Olympic sprinter, made the allegations against the
53-year-old Scot, who resigned his post with the British Athletics
Federation early last year.
He also alleged that an Edinburgh doctor, James Ledingham, had
supplied competitors, including himself, with drugs, and advised them on
how to avoid detection.
Dr Ledingham was heavily involved with the British Olympic Association
for almost a decade until 1987, with Scottish athletics, and is team
doctor for Hibs.
A member of Edinburgh Athletic Club while a competitor, McMaster says
he used illegal drugs himself before and after 1978, when he was a
member of Scotland's 4 x 100 metres relay squad which set a British
record in winning gold at the Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Canada.
His admission, added to a similar confession from David Jenkins, means
that half of that team are now confirmed doping cheats. There is no
suggestion that the two other members of the quartet, Olympic 100m
champion Allan Wells and European 200m silver medallist Cameron Sharp,
were implicated.
McMaster's primary target, however, was neither Dr Ledingham nor Dick,
but Wells, his bitter rival during their track career. Dick confirmed to
The Herald that the thrust of his questions were directed at trying to
smear Wells.
On the pretext of researching a book, McMaster travelled the length of
Britain interviewing athletes, doctors, and coaches. While secretly
wired to recording equipment, his tactics were to admit his own guilt
regarding drugs in the hope of provoking revealing or incriminating
comments.
Dick says that when McMaster visited him he was more preoccupied with
McMaster's fragile health than in paying particular attention to what he
said. ''I just thought he was being stupid, and told him so,'' said
Dick.
Formerly Scottish national coach, Dick spent 15 years with the British
Athletic Federation, receiving the OBE for services to coaching.
''I absolutely refute all of these allegations,'' Dick said yesterday.
''I am most upset that for the sake of a story somebody should be
damning the sport again, trying to tarnish an incredible period in
British athletics history.
''Throughout my career, when asked, I educated athletes as to how
these drugs worked, and the damage they do, whilst also forcefully
pointing out that taking such drugs is cheating -- and in my opinion
such cheats should be banned for life.''
Wells said yesterday: ''I'm disgusted that McMaster should be raking
the gutters like this, attempting to make money by smearing people like
myself and Frank Dick.
''I have been offered six figures to say that I was involved in drugs.
The truth is that McMaster turned to steroids because I started beating
him -- and I was not using drugs.
''Frank phoned me and warned me about what McMaster was doing, and I
even had a phone call from somebody in Edinburgh whom McMaster had
approached, asking them to say they had supplied me with drugs, which,
of course, they had not,'' he said.
McMaster also went to the home of Cameron Sharp, who still suffers
physical and mental impairment from injuries sustained in a car crash.
His wife Carol, a former international 800m runner, said: ''Both
Cameron and I are outraged by the way Drew McMaster has tried to take
advantage of someone with a brain injury. You can't sink much lower than
that.
''McMaster, wired to a concealed recorder, attempted to provoke some
kind of revelation or damning statement.
''Drew said: 'We all had an agreement that we would do what we had to
do, to get where we wanted to go. We all had to go on the gear (i.e.
anabolic steroids). We were all being sorted out, at our end, but you
had your own arrangements in the West, didn't you, Cameron?''' Sharp was
then based in Kilmarnock, and was coached by Dick.
''Cameron told him he was wrong, and that if there were people in the
team who were dirty, he certainly was not one of them,'' she added.
''Cameron has said he never wants to see or hear from Drew again. If
he comes to our door, he will not be allowed into the house.''
The Scottish Athletic Federation was horrified to learn of the
allegations, and its president Peter Carton confirmed last night that he
would press for the deletion of all drug-tainted performances from the
Scottish record books.
Tony Ward, spokesman for Dick's former employers, the BAF, said: ''We
don't comment on specific allegations of this nature, because that would
invoke trial by media. But the sport is extremely disapointed that the
Sunday Times has devoted so much space to a matter which does not relate
to what is happening in the sport today.''
Dr Ledingham, who has practised in Edinburgh for more than 23 years,
yesterday was said to be spending the day with friends in the Borders
and was unavailable for comment.
McMaster, aged 38 and said to be unemployed, also was unavailable for
comment.
In Tranent, East Lothian, his mother said he had gone to England for
several weeks.

The Chancellor should not see air passenger duty as an easy target. If
he does then many communities in the Highlands and Islands will suffer
Mr Scott Grier, managing director of Loganair
AN increase in the level of air passenger duty anticipated in next
month's Budget would have a serious effect on the economy of the
Highlands and Islands, politicians and aviation industry leaders fear.
Pressure is growing on Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to leave the duty at
its present level of #5 for flights within the UK and #10 for
international services. There are strong indications he is looking at a
rise of #2 on the former and #5 on the latter.
MPs of all parties are to press the point home in the coming weeks and
the chairman of British Airways, Sir Colin Marshall, has urged Mr Clarke
to set his face against any increase.
When the duty was brought in amid controversy last autumn there were
warnings that Highlands and Islands services could be affected
adversely.
Now fears are resurfacing that not only could some ''thin'' routes --
those which produce a small profit at best -- be under threat but that
business in already difficult areas may be faced with a doubtful future.
There is also concern that the charter airline market, which suffered
a reduction in demand during the long hot summer, would suffer further.
Mr Jim Wallace, MP for Orkney and Shetland, said the warnings made
when the duty was introduced went unheeded and requests to exempt
Highlands and Islands services were ignored.
He said: ''I hope that the Chancellor will keep his hands off the
national duty as it could make life even more difficult for industry and
commerce in my constituency and elsewhere in the Highlands and Islands.
''I do not want to indulge in doom and gloom but in areas which are
finding it hard enough to prosper, the last thing that is needed is
another burden.
''It does not appear to be fully appreciated that these are essential
services not luxuries. There are many parts of Orkney and Shetland, as
well as the Western Isles, which depend on air services for essential
journeys within a reasonable time frame.
''This is already a tax on essentials and to increase it at all would
be intolerable.''
Sir Colin Marshall has told Mr Clarke that he considers the tax
damaging to an important national industry. To impose a discretionary
tax on success seems contrary to Conservative Party ideals, he said.
He has warned that the damage would fall particularly on British
Airways regional services which were financially fragile but important
to the regional economies. The airline has already been forced to
withdraw four Manchester services and one out of Birmingham in the past
12 months.
Sir Colin says the tax distorts competition as it does not apply to
ferries or the Channel Tunnel and is increasingly unpopular. There is no
concept of value for money as transport budgets have been cut despite an
extra #350m extracted from air passengers in the past year.
Mr Ian Reid, general manager for British Airways in Scotland, said:
''There is no doubt that the services operated in the Highlands and
Islands are important to the economy of the area. We resisted the
imposition of the tax without success and we will continue to resist any
form of increase.
''While there has been no downturn on the routes north of Glasgow,
they have stood still against the national trend and the air passenger
duty has been a factor.''
He added: ''These services are a lifeline to many remote communities
as they carry not just tourists or business people but hospital
patients, visitors, doctors, the police, and the judiciary. They are an
essential part of life in the Highlands and Islands and must be
protected.
''We cannot hide the fact that many of these services are marginal and
while we are fully aware of our responsibilities to the communities we
serve we also have to take a sensible commercial approach to the
routes.''
Mr Scott Grier, managing director of Loganair which operates the bulk
of the Highlands and Islands network under the British Airways Express
banner, has written to Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth urging his
support for the duty to be left alone and for further consideration to
be given to exemption for more routes.
He said: ''At present, only our Islander and Twin Otter aircraft are
exempt from the duty and that affects just 20,000 of the 250,000-plus
passengers carried on the network.
He said: ''It has been estimated that the Highlands and Islands
services raised just under #1m last year and frankly that is a row of
beans to the Treasury when compared to the total amount raised.
''The Chancellor should not see air passenger duty as an easy target.
If he does then many communities in the Highlands and Islands will
suffer.''

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH National Party leader Alex Salmond has written to the Prime
Minister complaining about what he claims is the latest injustice to
Scots with the sell-off in England and Wales of the National Grid.
The flotation of the National Grid company in December will lead to a
#50 rebate for every customer in England and Wales. The company though
does not operate in Scotland so there will be no rebate for electricity
users north of the Border.
That alone, Mr Salmond believes, is unjust as all taxpayers, including
those in Scotland and Northern Ireland, had paid for the setting up of
the National Grid.
But now he has uncovered what he believes to be a second injustice
with far more long-lasting implications. His investigations have shown
that when the rebate is applied to electricity bills in England and
Wales, it could have an effect on the Retail Price Index -- the official
indicator that the Government uses to track whether the cost of living
is going up or down.
The RPI is not just of interest to economists. It is used by the
Government to calculate whether a whole range of benefits and pensions
are increased or not in the future.
The worst scenario would be if the #50 rebate was applied in the one
month when the RPI is calculated for the changes to benefits and
pensions. This could have the effect of reducing the RPI by just over
1.1%, and consequently pensions and benefit rises would be kept
artificially low for the whole of the UK.
Calculations show that it could mean #880m worth of benefit rises
being lost.
In his letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Salmond states: ''It is
possible that we could have the extraordinary injustice of people in
Scotland and Northern Ireland receiving less pensions and benefit as a
result of the impact on the RPI of a payment they had never received.''
The SNP leader wants to know if this impact had been properly assessed
before the rebate was agreed, and wants consideration of the rebate
being extended to Scotland.
He added in his letter: ''I hope I can have your early assurance that
whatever the superficial attractions of massaging the RPI figures, you
will not allow Scottish pensioners to be left out in the cold yet again
by your administration.''

suicide because she was suffering from a terminal illness.
The bodies of 46-year-old Patricia Bearne and 23-year-old Spencer
Binningsley, were found at their cottage in Polbathic, east Cornwall, on
Saturday.
Two suicide notes were found, together with a number of containers of
pain-killing drugs, said a Devon and Cornwall police spokesman.
''The indications are that the couple took their own lives, the deaths
are not being treated as suspicious,'' he said.
Police were alerted by concerned neighbours who had not seen the
couple around the village for some time.
Their bodies were taken to the Derriford hospital mortuary at Plymouth

A SYNDICATE of three women from the Borders is believed to have won
almost #1.6m in Saturday's National Lottery.
Mrs Myra McCombe, of Renwick Terrace in Hawick, her daughter Sandra
McCombe, and daughter-in-law Jill McCombe, are expected to share
#1,594,352, after matching all six balls in the weekly draw.
A Camelot spokesman would not confirm the details of the win yesterday
but the scoop is believed to be the biggest National Lottery win in
Scotland since a Fraserburgh fisherman and his wife won #3.8m in August.
Mrs McCombe, 61, yesterday left the home where she lives with husband
David to join 35-year-old daughter Sandra at her flat less than a
quarter of a mile away at Gladstone Street.
Mrs McCombe's daughter-in-law Jill, 30, was also at Gladstone Street
for the celebrations.
A representative from Camelot said members of the family would be
travelling to Glasgow for a presentation today. ''There will be no
interviews or statements tonight,'' said the spokesman.
The family refused to make any comment about the lottery win. It is
understood Mr McCombe, 63, was made redundant several years ago.
The winning numbers were 7,16,27,33,35 and 44. The bonus number was 5.
The estimated jackpot was #9.3m.

CONSERVATIONISTS yesterday called for tougher seal protection laws
after 25 seal pups were found shot dead on an Orkney beach.
Police made house-to-house inquiries in South Ronaldsay yesterday in
an attempt to find the person responsible for the slaughter.
The pups, some just two days old, had been shot in the head at
point-blank range and were found by a distraught family at a remote bay
near Burwick.
Mrs Eva Budge, of Deerness, said it had been a family tradition for 30
years to go to the cove to see the new-born pups.
''We're in a state of shock,'' she said yesterday after visiting the
beach with five grandchildren aged from one to 12.
''It's been wonderful in the past for the children to see such fluffy,
cuddly creatures.
''This time it was carnage. It was the most terrible experience and
some of the children were in tears all the way home -- this was nothing
less than murder.''
Orkney Seal Rescue volunteer Maureen Bain said the Budge family had
found 10 pups and a suckling mother shot dead at one cove.
She had then discovered 15 more dead pups huddled together in a
neighbouring bay.
''Each one had been shot in the eye area,'' she said. ''It's been a
devastating experience to see them like this.
''It was the most cowardly act to kill them in this way. They were
totally vulnerable -- some still had their umbilical cords attached to
them.
''They couldn't have defended themselves. It's a harrowing sight and
there can be no justification for violence like this.''
The rescue group's chairman, Mr Ross Flett, said the killing of the
pups was totally illegal. The Conservation of Seals Act allows fishermen
and fish farmers to shoot seals seen interfering with gear.
''The Act needs to be strengthend to make it easier to prosecute
people who kill seals like this and to offer the courts far tougher
penalties.''
Orkney Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
inspector Mike Lynch said post mortem examinations would be carried out
on four pups in the hope of recovering bullets as evidence.
Police were making house-to-house inquiries and he was hopeful that
the gunman would be found.

TWO members of the same Dundee family, a woman and an 18-month-old
baby, died when the car they were travelling in went out of control
yesterday. A young child and two other adult occupants were injured when
the Vauxhall Cavalier left the A92 Arbroath to Montrose road and
overturned at Hawkhill lay-by near Inverkeilor.
The injured three-year-old girl was described as suffering serious
injuries. Passing motorists went to the aid of the family and police
cars took the injured to Arbroath Infirmary for treatment.
A police spokesman said: ''We are withholding the identities until
relatives are contacted.''
In England, two people were killed and at least one other person was
feared dead last night after their car was involved in a crash with two
lorries, police said.
The incident happened on the A34 on St John's roundabout at Newbury,
Berkshire.
The car driver and passengers were trapped in the wreckage of the
vehicle after the smash and doctors later confirmed that at least two of
them had died.
At least one other person was still trapped an hour after the crash,
which happened at 8.35pm, but a Thames Valley police spokesman said
later it was feared all had died.
It was not thought that either of the two lorry drivers was injured in
the crash.
A police spokesman said: ''It is an unbelievable scene of horror down
there, with two cars buried underneath two lorries.''
The victims were thought to have been killed instantly when the 38-ton
lorry landed on top of the roof, crushing it to a tangled wreck less
than a foot high.
The driver of the Mercedes 18-wheeler was taken from the scene to a
nearby police station, though it was not known whether he had been
arrested.
Another lorry, travelling alongside on the dual carriageway skidded as
the accident happened and hit a Vauxhall Astra car.
A spokeswoman for the Royal Berkshire ambulance service said five
other casualties, who were ''not serious and all conscious'', had been
taken to Basingstoke Hospital.
A fleet of five ambulances raced to the crash scene -- the exact spot
where campaigners are fighting against the proposed Newbury bypass.

A MAN who found #1600 worth of National Lottery scratchcards and
handed them in to police was angry after lottery organisers Camelot
repaid his honesty by sending him a plastic keyring worth about 50p.
Mr Darren Balfour, 26, a machinist engineer said: ''I've always
believed honesty pays. Now I'm not so sure.''
Returning from holidays, Mr Balfour found a Parcel Force package
containing eight packs of 200 #1 Aces High scratchcards, which carry a
#5000 jackpot, by the side of the road.
A spokeswoman for Camelot said yesterday they were grateful but the
cards had already been rendered void.
Mr Balfour's answer was: ''I'll probably send them the keyring back
saying, 'Thanks but no thanks'.''

A SCOTTISH council has been attacked over its handling of a land sale
and its treatment of a woman with whom, according to the country's Local
Government Ombudsman, they were ''less than open in their dealings''.
Ombudsman Mr Frederick Marks said Stirling District Council's handling
of the matter amounted to maladministration and it should pay #500
compensation for her considerable distress.
''Instead of 'coming clean' they subjected her to many weeks of
uncertainty while they sought to recover their position and regularise
the situation.''
Mr Marks said the apology the woman received from the chief executive
was not, in his view, sufficient to redress the injustice.
The Ombudsman's criticism followed an investigation into the woman's
complaint about the district council's handling of negotiations for the
disposal of a strip of land it owned.
She proposed to buy the land for use as an access to a site she owned
and intended to develop for housing.
She was aggrieved that, having offered last year to sell her the
access on terms previously agreed in 1992, the council belatedly revised
its position, greatly increased the price, and proposed that the council
would acquire her site for development by itself.
The 1992 negotiations stopped short of a legal bargain being concluded
and, when two years later the woman reactivated the development plan and
asked to purchase the access, the matter was treated merely as an
administrative task and no adequate check was done to find out the
background to the earlier agreement.
''She sought and received, in the form of a formal offer, confirmation
from the council that they remained willing to sell the access strip at
the price previously agreed. That is the basis on which she was entitled
to expect matters to proceed.''

Brussels
A SIGN that the European Commission has little faith in stopping
conflict between Spanish and British fishermen next year was given
yesterday by the EU Fisheries Commissioner, Mrs Emma Bonino.
She is still smarting about the rejection last week of her masterplan
for policing western waters and the Irish Box conservation area.
Fisheries Ministers of Spain, Britain, and other states unanimously
threw it out, against the Commission's wishes, in favour of a set of
simpler rules.
At the weekend, she said that the compromise agreed in Luxembourg was
a ''blank cheque'' which could lead to conflict and over-fishing.
Her comments add to confusion about who will be the losers when the
big Spanish fishing fleet enters sensitive waters off western Britain
and Ireland from January 1.
Fisheries Minister Tony Baldry said after the talks that British
fishermen would continue to fish up to their quotas in the Irish Box --
an area around Ireland where stocks are conserved and catches strictly
limited.
However, if all existing fishermen continue to catch their quotas and
the Spanish newcomers do the same, the fear is that stocks will be
diminished. That is specifically ruled out under the new arrangements,
which insist that ''relative stability'' must be respected and there
must be no overall increase in the total fishing effort.
Mr Michael Forsyth, Scottish Secretary, who attended the talks, hailed
the deal as good for the Scottish fleet, which takes 70% of the UK
annual catch. However, there are fears that the English fleet will
suffer even though the Spanish and Portuguese are banned under the new
deal from the Irish Sea, Bristol Channel, and North Sea.
Mrs Bonino had wanted to employ sophisticated computer technology to
track boats and monitor catches. Instead, Ministers simply agreed to
step up log book rules and spot checks as well as insisting that the
Iberians must check in and out of Irish or British waters.
Mrs Bonino told reporters after the deal was struck that she had
decided ''not to stand and fight'' for her ideas but to wait and see how
the new arrangements worked -- or did not work.
She is now saying that the compromise is much weaker than her own
proposal and will allow Spanish and French fishing boats based along the
British coast to come and go virtually unchecked if they leave port,
fish, and return within a 72-hour period.
The deal allows up to 40 Spanish boats at any one time in the Irish
Box and up to 220 at any one time in western waters, which stretch from
west of Shetland to the Bay of Biscay.
Under the Commission's proposal, fishermen claimed, about 900 British
boats would have had to make 170,000 separate calls to authorities each
year, plus a further 5000 reports to other member states, at an annual
cost of more than #800,000.

<HEADLINE>Report finds draft libel Bill to be 'illogical and unfair'</HEADLINE>

NEWSPAPERS and broadcasting organisations in Scotland could become the
preferred targets of defamation actions if a draft Bill published by
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, becomes law.
The University of Glasgow School of Law has warned that a reform of
the law in England, while leaving Scots law largely untouched, would
lead to confusion and make it more attractive to pursue libel actions in
Scotland.
This would lead to a complete reversal of the present situation where
England is the favoured venue because libel damages awards are much
higher than in Scotland.
The university's centre for research into law reform issued a report
today in response to a consultation paper and draft Bill issued by the
Lord Chancellor's Department.
The principal argument in the report is that it would be illogical and
unfair to embark on a wholesale change in the law in England and Wales
while leaving the law in Scotland in its present form.
In England and Wales, the draft Bill proposes a one-year time limit
for the raising of a defamation action. In Scotland, the time limit
would remain at three years.
The university points out: ''As most newspapers circulate and radio
and television broadcasts take place within both jurisdictions, it would
be possible for pursuers to raise proceedings in Scotland for two years
longer than the cut-off point in England and Wales.''
News organisations in England would also be able to take advantage of
a new defence of an offer of amends which involves the publication of a
correction or apology in a case of unintentional or accidental
defamation.
The defence applies, for example, in a case where a newspaper carries
a scurrilous story about someone with a fictitious name but, by a
complete fluke, there is a real person with the same name.
Scotland would be left with the existing offer of amends defence which
is contained in the 1952 Defamation Act and is widely regarded as
useless.
''It is the view of the centre (for research into law reform) that
this will lead to 'forum shopping' on the part of pursuers who will find
it more attractive to raise proceedings in Scotland where the old offer
of amends defence was all that was available to defenders,'' the
university report says.
''The result of the Lord Chancellor's Bill becoming a statute in its
present terms would be to create an illogical legal situation within the
United Kingdom.''
Massive jury awards in libel cases have become notorious in England
and the university urges Lord Mackay to consider abolishing jury trial
altogether in defamation actions south of the border.
In Scotland, juries are extremely rare in defamation cases and the
highest award is #50,000.

<RECORDNO>975634730</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
PANIC may have been the main cause of the high death toll.
In comments to Itar-Tass news agency, one expert said the fact the
train halted in a tunnel may also have complicated matters because
normal procedure was to try to reach a station.
Anatoly Reznik, duty officer at the Moscow Metro Safety Board, told
Tass: ''About 300 people were killed. This may have been caused by a
fire in three to four coaches and an ensuing panic because of a lack of
light, the carriage doors being closed, and fire raging all around.''
Valentin Ageyev, spokesman for the State Department on Fire Control at
Moscow underground facilities, said the carriages being used in Baku
appeared to be particularly fire-prone. He said smoke could have risen
from the traction motor and, in this case, the fire would have spread
from one carriage to another through ventilation hatches.
He said a traction motor had caught fire in a Moscow underground train
on April 20, 1987, as it approached the Paveletskaya station. The driver
slowly drove to the station and all passengers got out before the fire
gutted two carriages within 12 minutes.
Initially, it was thought that only two people had died. But the toll
climbed steadily and television stations were put off the air.
By Sunday morning, Interior Minister Ramil Usubov said at least 289
people had died, including 28 children.
However, officials at mortuaries said they counted at least 303 bodies
and the independent Azerbaijani news agency Turan quoted medical
officials as putting the death toll at 337.
Azerbaijan's health minister Ali Insanov said 269 people were injured.
Of the injured, 62 remained in hospital yesterday.
Hundreds of people were trapped underground but it was not knownhow
many people were on the train, the Azerbaijani interior ministry said.
Rescuers battled the blaze until early Sunday, later pulling the
injured and the dead, wrapped in rugs and blankets, from the tunnel.
Axes reportedly were used to break the doors of one car and take the
corpses out. Police and security forces sealed off the area, barring
journalists.
Turkey's Anatolia news agency said around 400 people were rescued from
the subway, adding that three rescue workers had died.
Insanov said: ''The main reason was carbon monoxide poisoning, which
paralyzes the respiratory system and causes emphysema and death.''
President Geidar Aliev set up a government commission to investigate
the accident.
Last year, around 20 people were killed in two separate terrorist
attacks on the Baku metro. Both cases are still under investigation.
Immediately after Saturday's accident, rumours began circulating
around Baku that the fire was also a terrorist act. Authorities insisted
that there was no indication of terrorism in Saturday's fire.
Azerbaijan, an oil-rich Turkic nation on the eastern Caspian Sea
shores which borders on Georgia, Iran, and Armenia, has been weakened by
economic and political turmoil and war with Armenia over the
Nagorno-Karabakh enclave since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
Aliev, the country's former communist leader who returned to power in
1993, has cracked down on opposition parties and independent media.
The Baku underground system was opened in Soviet times in 1967 and now
has 19 stations. It has about 18 miles of track.

BRITAIN'S underground railway systems boast stringent safety measures
designed to ensure that a tragedy on the scale of the one in Azerbaijhan
would not happen here.
London Underground has spent #1000m on state-of-the-art
fire-prevention systems following the King's Cross disaster which
claimed the lives of 31 people in 1987.
Many of the safety measures ordered as a result of that tragedy had
already been incorporated in the Glasgow Underground system when it
underwent a complete modernisation before re-opening in 1980.
The hundreds of deaths in Baku make the disaster far bigger than the
world's previous worst underground railway blaze -- on the Paris Metro
in 1903, when more than 80 people died.
Until yesterday, the King's Cross fire had been the second-worst in
history. Many of those who died there were caught in the inferno which
started as ''smouldering'' on an escalator caused by a dropped
cigarette. Others perished in thick smoke which filled station
passageways.
A major safety review which followed that tragedy has led to many
improvements on the London Underground, including replacing virtually
all flammable or smoke-producing materials in stations, trains, and
tunnels.
Yesterday, an LU spokesman declared: ''It is inconceivable that the
Baku tragedy could happen here.''
Despite the high standard of fire-prevention measures in Glasgow, a
spokeswoman for Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive said last
night: ''We are never complacent and safety is always a paramount
concern.''
Full-scale exercises involving all emergency services dealing with a
variety of scenarios, including fires, were staged regularly, she
pointed out. By coincidence, the latest exercise took place last night
at the city's Kelvinbridge station.
Safety features on the Glasgow system include the use of
closed-circuit television cameras at each of the 15 stations and the
fact that all of the stations are staffed.
In a rare incident, fire broke out in the Underground system in
October, 1993. Eleven people were treated in hospital for smoke
inhalation following an electrical fault at Cowcaddens station. Fire
chiefs later praised Underground staff and their own crews for the
''textbook'' handling of the emergency.
British railway experts yesterday said that, like London and Glasgow,
Britain's other underground systems -- the Tyneside Metro and the
metro-style section of Merseyrail -- also had modern, fire-safe
materials.
They had no hesitation in blaming the Baku disaster on the relatively
primitive state of the Soviet-built metro system. One of nearly a score
built in cities of the old Soviet Union, mainly in three decades from
the mid-50s, it was opened in 1967.
''The technical standards lag far behind the West,'' railway
consultant Richard Hope said. ''The Soviet Union went for quantity
rather than quality.
''This would include materials used for cable insulation for instance.
Older insulation produces smoke and toxic fumes.''
Mr Hope, former editor of Railway Gazette International, added: ''As
with their nuclear power stations, the Russians simply don't in any
field give the importance to public safety that we do in the West.''

LABOUR leader Tony Blair last night moved to reimpose tight party
discipline, after Tory Ministers challenged him to sack his Shadow
Cabinet colleague Clare Short -- or back her call for a re-examination
of the drugs laws and the possible legalisation of cannabis.
Faced with the embarrassment caused by Ms Short's frank assessment of
the Government's drugs policy, Mr Blair will order his Shadow Cabinet
colleagues at their weekly meeting on Wednesday to avoid expressing
potentially dangerous personal opinions.
A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ''He will remind them all of the need
to express party policy and not make personal statements that can be
used against us by the media and by our political enemies.''
As Labour scrambled to undo the unintentional damage caused by Ms
Short's morning remarks on BBC television, the Government moved swiftly
to take political advantage of the situation.
Home Secretary Michael Howard, warning of the ''tremendous damage''
that legalising cannabis would do to society, said: ''Clare Short has
shown once again what lies behind the mask of new Labour. It is clear
they are at sixes and sevens on this subject as they are on so many
others.''
He was joined in the attack by the Tory Party chairman, Dr Brian
Mawhinney, who called on Mr Blair to act. ''She has set a test for Tony
Blair -- will he legalise cannabis or fire Clare Short?'' he said.
In reply, the Shadow Home Secretary, Mr Jack Straw, sought to play
down the embarrassment caused. He was forced to deny any change in party
policy. Ms Short, he said, had been speaking strictly in a personal
capacity.
Ms Short, a left-winger appointed Shadow Transport Secretary 10 days
ago on her election to the Shadow Cabinet, has a reputation for plain
speaking. Her remarks have proved a gift to the Government, which is
enjoying its new-found aggressiveness towards Labour.
In comments further likely to embarrass the Labour leadership, she
also called for legislation to outlaw Page Three girls and warned that
she was prepared to defy Mr Blair over all-women short-lists which he
wants to scrap after the next election.
Speaking on Breakfast with Frost, Ms Short said the Government's
efforts to stem the spread of drug use had been a ''disaster'', and
called for a re-examination of the issue.
''Lots of people in the police have said we should look at that and I
think we should look at it and I think we should not be cowards. I think
we should get some archbishops and former chief constables and see if we
can't organise the whole thing better and maybe that includes taxing and
selling cannabis in a separate place than hard drugs,'' she said.
Ms Short argued that medical opinion now regarded cannabis as
relatively harmless compared to alcohol. However, because it was
illegal, young people who used it found themselves drawn into trying
illicit hard drugs.
''I think the fact that a lot of young people use cannabis and say it
is relatively unharmful but it is sold by the same people who sell the
most vile and destructive drugs is a major problem,'' she said.
Hours later, Mr Straw disowned his colleague, by insisting Labour had
no plans to reopen the debate.
''She is entitled to her personal opinions. She made it very clear it
was an entirely personal opinion but it is not party policy. Labour's
position on drugs is very clear. We are against the legalisation of
cannabis and other soft drugs,'' he said.
The redoubtable MP for Birmingham Ladywood, once described as having a
fuse the length of her name, has become a strong supporter of Mr Blair.
She proved it earlier this month when she publicly backed the leadership
in its decision to bar the radical Liz Davies from standing as
parliamentary candidate.

TO USE one of author Alasdair Gray's own titles, it is an Unlikely
Story, Mostly, but true and none the less farcical for that.
The story surrounds his best-selling novel Lanark. It is, however,
unfolding on a less parochial stage as Scotland and England slug it out,
with Glasgow and Edinburgh lined up in one corner and London in the
other.
Two of Scotland's biggest bookselling firms -- John Smith and
Waterstones -- had intended mounting a big display of Gray's books to
exploit the sales stimulated by the TAG stage production of Lanark,
which opens on Wednesday at the Citizens' Theatre in Glasgow.
However, Smith and Waterstones have been put in an embarrassing
position by the London publishing firm of Pan Picador, which means that
Lanark will be the only Gray novel which won't be on sale in the shops.
Lanark, which Gray describes as probably his best seller, was brought
out in hardback in 1981 by the Edinburgh publishing house of Canongate.
It later leased the paperback rights to Pan Picador under terms which
required the paperback to be kept in print.
However, as Ms Belinda MacDougall of Waterstones told Mr Gray's wife
in a letter: ''Because of the success of the production at the Edinburgh
Festival, not to mention its continuous all year round demand, our three
Edinburgh branches have virtually sold out. The same situation is true
for all the wholesalers in Britain.
''Despite numerous calls to the publisher, they can tell us no more
than a reprint is under consideration. Even when I asked why such an
important book should ever have been in that position and that surely
demand from Scottish booksellers alone would warrant a speedy reprint if
ever stocks became low, they could still only repeat that a reprint is
under consideration.''
A spokesman for John Smith in Glasgow said it did not have any copies
of Lanark in stock. ''We were trying to get hold of copies to mount a
big window display to coincide with the Citizens' production.
''We phoned the publishers but were told there were no stocks and no
date for reprinting. This is the worst thing you can hear from a
publisher.''
She said Mr Gray, an author who ''ticks over'' in sales terms was
''not a chuffed man about the situation''.
Mr Gray said yesterday from his home in Glasgow: ''Pan Picador did not
mean to miss a big sales opportunity but its headquarters are in the
south of Britain. Directors are bound to make mistakes when dealing with
outposts. I hate to be seen to be taking things badly but I'm a wee bit
annoyed.''
Last night, Mr Jamie Byng, joint managing director at Canongate, said
it was insane that Lanark was not available to coincide with the Tag
play. The company had been reassured that the book would be reprinted in
November.
No-one was available for comment from Pan Picador.

AT least 500 anti-nuclear protesters, some in radiation suits,
yesterday stormed the gardens at Chequers, the Prime Minister's official
residence, ahead of the arrival of President Jacques Chirac for a
two-day Franco-British summit.
There were 12 arrests, during what Greenpeace and CND claimed was a
successful protest aimed at reminding Mr Chirac of widespread opposition
to France's continuing programme of nuclear tests in the South Pacific.
Spokesmen for the organisations said the protest had been peaceful and
urged Mr Major to ''stand up to Chirac'' over the nuclear issue. Britain
has steadfastly supported France's right to test its independent nuclear
deterrent.
Of the protest, CND's Eddie Goncalves said: ''It was a great
embarrassment for John Major and for his guests and it has put nuclear
testing at the top of the political agenda.
''There were about 1000 people surrounding the building of Chequers
and they got very close. All of the visiting dignitaries will have got a
very clear view of the protesters and their banners and will certainly
have heard the noise they made.''
CND has promised a campaign of action against Mr Chirac during his
visit, the first since his election this summer. Demonstrators will
gather today outside the Foreign Office in London, where he will have
further meetings with Mr Major, to continue their protest.
A Greenpeace spokeswoman said Mr Major was ''isolated'' by his support
for Mr Chirac. ''John Major's welcoming to Britain of Jacques Chirac,
just days after the third in the current series of nuclear tests, is a
slap in the face to the 85% of British people who want the tests to
stop,'' she said.
''He has isolated himself as a world leader, openly supporting
President Chirac's nuclear testing programme.''
Mr Chirac arrived yesterday, aware that his visit would attract
hostile attention from those determined to force France to halt the
tests. The French president, whose decision to renew testing has drawn
international condemnation, has already indicated fewer tests than
intended would be carried out.
The leaders were due last night to discuss military matters. Today,
they will fly to RAF High Wycombe to inaugurate the new Franco-British
Euro Air Group, an initiative agreed last year to strengthen the
capacity of the two countries' air forces to undertake combined
operations, particularly humanitarian and peacekeeping.
Mr Chirac is expected to express his gratitude for the support he has
received from Britain. In a weekend interview with French newspaper Le
Monde, the Prime Minister reiterated Britain's view that the tests were
a matter for the French Government alone.
''When you have the responsibilities of a nuclear power and when your
best scientific advisers tell you that more tests are needed, I am not
sure that you have much choice. I don't think criticising France is the
best way to attain our long-term goal, which is the prohibition of all
nuclear tests,'' he said,
On Friday, France carried out its third test in the programme at the
Mururoa atoll testing site in French Polynesia. Mr Chirac has promised
to sign a treaty banning all future tests after the current series is
completed by May 31.
Mr Major is expected to come under intense pressure next month at the
Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Auckland.

OFFICIALS in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku were still trying today to
assess the death toll from one of the world's most serious underground
railway disasters.
Around 300 people were known to have been killed and about 270 injured
after a packed train caught fire between two stations in the city. Among
the dead were 28 children.
Throughout the night, hundreds of people streamed to Baku's main
mosque to try to identify victims and prepare friends or relatives for
burial.
''This is the worst day in the history of our city,'' said Eldar, an
elderly man who came to pray and pay his last respects to victims.
Azeri Health Minister Ali Insanov said 289 people were killed and 269
injured, 62 of them seriously. Hospital officials said 337 died and 270
were injured, most of them suffering burns or smoke inhalation.
Firemen who battled the fumes to bring bodies to the surface told the
independent Azeri news agency Turan that they feared the death toll
might reach 600.
Men at the mosque's entrance unloaded wooden coffins from a large
lorry. Muftis blessed bodies wrapped in elegant, hand-woven national
carpets. The bodies were then gently lifted into simple coffins and
taken away by relatives for burial.
Weeping women dressed in black mourned over the bodies of relatives in
the stone-walled rooms of the mosque overlooking the Caspian Sea. Smoke
killed many of the victims and its acrid smell pervaded the atmosphere.
Interior Minister Ramil Usubov dismissed any suggestions of sabotage.
Police said a spark from a high voltage cable might have started the
fire and survivors reported seeing sparks as soon as the train entered a
tunnel.
Unable to escape from the packed train, caught between stations, most
of the dead were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning from burning
materials in the carriages, officials said.
Survivors said there was panic when the lights went out and smoke
began to fill the carriages after the train came to a halt between the
Narimanov and Ulduz stations in central Baku during Saturday's early
evening rush hour.
''The train went on for a bit and then stopped. The driver came back
but couldn't open the doors. Then the lights went out. After a while we
started to suffocate from the smoke and we realised we had to open the
doors,'' said Gennady Nikiferev.
''The car was packed with people and when we opened the doors, half
the people just fell out on top of each other.
''We started to run towards Narimanov station,'' Nikiferev said. For
100 or 200 metres the whole metro was full of smoke. People were walking
and they were all vomiting.''
Most of the dead were trapped in the middle cars where a panicking
stampede of passengers could not get to safety.
Manish Gurbanov, 53, who was in the second carriage, said he climbed
through a ventilation duct to escape.
''We couldn't break the windows so we climbed out through a
ventilation duct. I got through the tunnel by grabbing a cable on the
top of the tunnel, but they say a lot of other people were electrocuted.
People were dying all over the rails.''
''As soon as the train entered the tunnel I saw a flash,'' said Tabil
Guseinov, 45. ''Then the flames enveloped the train car, there was a
sound of breaking glass, and the lights went out.''
''People started breaking windows to get out. We were starting to
suffocate,'' he said.
Valentin Ageyev, spokesman for the State Department on Fire Control at
Moscow underground, said the driver may have been at a loss what to do
and stopped the train.
Under normal procedures, drivers should drive slowly to the nearest
station and avoid the possibility of fanning the fire, he said.
''Stopping the train in a tunnel might pose a death threat to
passengers because inflammable materials account for 98% of the coach's
finish,'' Ageyev said.
''If they are ignited, paint, wire insulation, the laminated-paper
plastics of the interior's finish, floor linoleum and seat padding
release deadly hydrocyanic acid along with carbon monoxide.''
President Haydar Aliyev declared two days of national mourning in
Azerbaijan, a predominantly Muslim, oil-producing state of seven million
people bordering Russia, Iran, Georgia, Armenia and the Caspian Sea.
Normal services resumed yesterday on the 19-mile underground network
of 19 stations, opened in 1967. Residents of Baku, a city of over two
million, say it is heavily used and the interiors of some trains are in
a bad state.
Aliyev set up an investigating commission headed by Deputy Prime
Minister Abbas Abbasov. It has yet to report its findings but, in a
message of condolence read out on television and radio, it said a
''technical fault'' caused the fire.
The President promised victims' families compensation of a million
manats, the local currency, which works out at #140.
